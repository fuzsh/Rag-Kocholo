        "text": "IDENTIFYING CIVIL AIRCRAFT\n\nHEARD FLYING IN THE VICINITY OF THE MARITIMES\n\nCALL SIGNS, REGISTRATION MARKS AND IDENTIFICATION CODES\n\nBill's Radio Site\n\nLast updated January 24, 2017\n\nThis web article is intended for use as part of listening to civil aircraft flying over the Maritimes or landing or departing at our airports.\n\nIt is also useful in conjunction with following aircraft on sites such as flightradar24, Planefinder and flightaware.\n\nAircraft are identified on the radio, on the web and in timetables in a number of different ways.\n\nREGISTRATION MARKS (\"INTERNATIONAL CALL SIGNS\" OR \"CALL LETTERS\")\n\nAmericans may refer to these as 'tail numbers'. Canadians might refer to these as the 'civil' or \"civil registration\".\n\nAll civil aircraft have registration marks. In theory, in most cases, these are equivalent to the official radio call letters of the aircraft as a radio station, but even aircraft without radios will have these marks. In today's world these registration marks are painted on all civil aircraft but are used in an obvious way only by non-airline aircraft. The military equivalent of these registration marks are the serial numbers commonly seen painted on military aircraft.\n\nStandard Type (Five-Character Registration Marks) [First two characters indicate country; then three letters for the individual aircraft]\n\nIn this pattern the registration marks system adheres to the International Telecommunications Union (UN) radio call sign allocation table that states that aircraft radio call letters consist of 5 characters, consisting of a two-character country identifier, followed by 3 letters. The country identifier could be two letters, a number followed by a letter, or a letter followed by a number.\n\nCanada's currently-used two-character identifiers are CF, CG and CI. CI is only used for ultralight aircraft. You may be interested to know that the CH-xxx series was formerly in use as well, for hovercraft, but these are now identified differently. These are drawn from Canada's total allocation of two-character prefixes (CF, CG, CH, CI, CJ, CK, CY, CZ, VA, VB, VC, VD, VE, VF, VG, VO, VX, VY, XJ, XK, XL, XM, XN, XO). Note that Canada does not have all the C prefixes. For example CC is Chile and CM is Cuba. The evolution of who got what is a whole other story, and a complicated one at that. Note that some countries do have all the combinations that commence with a particular letter. For example the United Kingdom has all the G's and all the M's and France has all the F's.\n\nRegistration marks are technically just the five characters in a row but in practice, they are usually shown as the two country characters, then a hyphen, then the three specific letters, such as YG-ABC. For countries that have a complete letter series, so that in effect that single letter identifies the country, they are written this way: G-ABCD or F-HWRX. Out of all the countries that use the standard pattern, Canada is the only one without a full letter series that uses the second convention, so that Canadian registration marks look like this: C-GMRD or C-FTCH. How this came about I do not know but it does give the implication that C means Canada whereas in reality it is the CF/CG/CI that does that task. Certainly a country like Chile uses marks such as CC-GHR, which is the approved way to do it. Some vintage aircraft do retain the old and proper way of doing things, so you may see something like CF-TCH (but there cannot be both a CF-TCH and a C-FTCH, as they are actually the same thing.)\n\nIn Canadian usage, pilots refer to the full five letters on initial contact with a particular controller (and vice versa), then both commonly in subsequent conversation use only the final three letters. For example: First contact: Charlie Golf Alpha Bravo Charlie... Subsequently: Alpha Bravo Charlie\n\nAmerican Type:\n\nThe USA formerly used aircraft markings of the 5-letter type but they appear to be unused since the 1930's. All one can say now is that the US markings begin with N followed by at least two numbers, and then usually by various combinations of numbers and letters, which seem to add up to a total of three to seven characters in all. Very often in modern times the final two characters are a pair of letters that relate to the owners corporate name. An example for Western Pacific Airlines might be N232WP. Americans refer to their registration marks as \"N-numbers\". There are certain patterns that are reserved for US government use. For example N23 would be only on a federal government aircraft.\n\nIn on-air usage the first time an aircraft is in contact with another station the complete N-number is used, and normally prefixed by the type of aircraft. In subsequent parts of the conversation, only the part that follows the N is spoken. So an American aircraft approaching Halifax would on first contact with the tower identify like this: Halifax Tower this is Cherokee November 434 Mike Tango (N434MT), but then would be referred to as 434 Mike Tango.\n\nRussian Type:\n\nThe Russian pattern is a letter or two followed by numbers. For Russia itself the first two characters are RA. As you can see from this list, quite a few countries use this pattern, and of these there are several that begin their registration marks with letters that are not theirs according to the ITU table of call sign prefixes. These have been marked with a double asterisk (**). Note that all the former Soviet Union components (other than Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia) use the system inherited from the unified country.\n\nChina (in general) B\n\nHong Kong BH\n\nMacau BM\n\nBolivia CP\n\nArmenia EK\n\nMoldova ER\n\nBelarus EW\n\nKyrgyzstan EX\n\nTajikistan EY\n\nTurkmenistan EZ\n\nS. Korea HL\n\nPanama HP\n\nSaudi Arabia HZ (but does have some 5-letter)\n\nJapan JA\n\nMongolia JU\n\nPeru OB\n\n** N Korea P\n\nUzbekistan UK\n\nKazakhstan UN\n\nGeorgia 4L\n\nAzerbaijan 4K\n\nUkraine UR\n\n** Vietnam VN\n\nMarshall Islands V7\n\nCambodia XU\n\nOther types (oddball types):\n\nLetter Letter ## Letter: Venezuela ( YV # # Letter)\n\nLetter Letter # # # Letter: Colombia (HK # # # Letter)\n\nLetter Letter # # # Letter Letter: Dominican Republic (HI # # # Letter Letter)\n\nLetter Letter Letter plus numbers: ** Philippines (RPC # # #) and Cuba (CUT or CUH # #)\n\nZ plus four letters (may conflict with other countries that use Z as the first character): Zimbabwe\n\nFLIGHT NUMBERS\n\nThis refers to the numerical designation of a flight but will always be preceded by a spoken or written prefix to identify the company. Scheduled passenger and cargo airliners are generally identified by a flight number. This flight number is used in concert with the airline name or code or voice call sign to indicate the route and timing of a regular flight, regardless of the identity of the particular aircraft flying it at any particular time. For example Westjet's flight from Halifax to Calgary, leaving every morning at around 7:30 is identified on air and practically everywhere else as Westjet 229 even though the actual aircraft used varies from day to day. Behind the scenes the civil registration marks of the particular aircraft are still used on the flight plans, and you might hear the clearance controller asking the pilot for the \"civil\" which means the registration marking on the aircraft as described above.\n\nFlight numbers are most closely associated with regularly recurring commercial flights, but any airline flight, even a one-off flight such as to move an aircraft from one place to another to replace another or other reason, will still have a flight number, even if it is only used that one time (but can be re-used for an entirely different flight some other day). Flight numbers are also used by many corporate aircraft even if itinerant, and in some cases the same flight number is used for a single aircraft no matter where and when it is going. An example is the Irving corporate jet which identifies as KC1 no matter where it is going, instead of using its official civil call letters painted on the side. Military flights also use flight numbers similar to civil counterparts.\n\nFlight numbers do have some variety in a few cases. This always relates to another airline being involved. For example all of the Jazz flights operating as Air Canada Express have two flight number variations. Jazz aircraft will identify on the air as Jazz 861 or similar, but on timetables and departure boards used by the public that will appear as Air Canada 8861. Most airlines do not vary the number however, so that for example Republic Airlines 3336 from Halifax to Philadelphia will appear as United 3336 with no change in the numerical part.\n\nA further variation in flight numbers occurs with code sharing. Generally this will not be seen on FlightAware or planefinder but is seen in airline timetables and sometimes on departure boards. If United and Westjet are code sharing on the Halifax to Calgary flight mentioned above it could be published additionally as United 7932 or similar (this is a fictional example) but it would never be used on-air. Occasionally some of these do appear on FlightAware with the giveaway being that two flights with the same aircraft type leave at the same moment and are scheduled to reach the same destination at the same time. This almost certainly means that there really is just one flight with one of the flights indicated being a sort of phantom, code-share designation for the real flight.\n\nOccasionally with flights passing over the Maritimes you will hear spoken flight numbers that vary somewhat from what you wold see in a schedule or on the screen. For example a British Airways flight that is identified in the schedule or on your planefinder screen as 326 or 326 might be heard on-air as 32K. The use of 32K is an ATC-only identification, and appears to be a European \"thing\" in response to concerns there that there was confusion between airline flight numbers being used simultaneously by several airlines in those crowded skies.\n\nAIRLINE CODES and CALL SIGNS\n\nIn the preceding section I wrote as if the flight number consisted only of numbers when in fact they consist of the numbers preceded by the Airline name or code. These come in three varieties: ICAO codes, IATA codes, and oral call signs or names.\n\nIATA Airline Codes\n\nThe IATA is the International Air Transport Association, headquartered in Montreal, presumably to be close to the ICAO, mentioned next. It is the industry association made up of most of the passenger and cargo airlines of the world. IATA gives out codes to airlines, but theirs are only two characters long rather than three. Unlike ICAO which uses only letters, IATA uses either two letters or a number and a letter for airline codes. These are the abbreviations or codes you see on airline timetables, on tickets, and on departure boards. It is one of the mysteries of life why there are two different systems, but there are! Because there are only so many two character combinations it is possible for these to be duplicated in far-apart regions of the world.\n\nICAO and ATC Airline Codes\n\nThe ICAO is the International Civil Aviation Organization, a United Nations agency with headquarters in Montreal. This is the official agency for intergovernmental cooperation and standardization of aviation practices. The ICAO assigns three-letter codes to all airlines that operate internationally, or might do so. It is necessary for there to be distinct codes or abbreviations for all airlines and similar organizations, with no duplications in the world. Unlike airport codes that have regional and national prefixes, the airline codes have no relationship to the country of ownership or operation, so that while ACA is Air Canada, AZA is Alitalia. I am not certain how the process works but it is obviously not arbitrary, in the sense that the airlines do get to apply for something that relates to the airline name. In FlightAware and planefinder you will see most commercial flights identified by ICAO codes. Some corporate and military flights also utilize such flight codes. To see full lists of such codes you should check the web. I have included in the chart below those of the airlines that regularly operate in our area.\n\nSpoken Call Signs\n\nCall Signs in this context refer to the spoken name of the airline, or a recognized substitute for that name. These are used on-air for communications with Air Traffic Control and similar entities. In most cases the call sign is at least part of the name of the company. Examples are \"United\" or \"Air Canada\" or \"Delta\" or \"Air France\". In a few cases the spoken call sign is a different word entirely, such as \"Speedbird\" for British Airways or \"Brickyard\" for Republic Airlines.\n\nA few words about military flights:\n\nNote that the military may also use ICAO airline codes and flight numbers for transport aircraft, and all military aircraft use spoken call signs. In the case of military transports they will sound much like the airline type. Examples are \"Canforce\" for Royal Canadian Air Force transports and \"Reach\" for the USAF counterparts. In North American skies at least, most foreign air force transports identify by the name of the air force, such as \"Norwegian Air Force\". Combat type military aircraft use spoken call signs that vary with the squadron or formation to which they are attached or in fact can vary from day to day."
