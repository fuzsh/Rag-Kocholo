        "text": "I wonder how I can make ATC address me by my correct callsign. AI traffic is always addressed as “Lufthansa 123” or whatever it is. But when I use LH123 or DLH123, ATC will not use “Lufthansa” when talking to me. I have seen videos where other users seemed to make this work. How can I do that?\n\nAnother question is that in my A320FlyByWire, I use Simbrief to import my Flightplan and when ATC addresses me, they always append a “1123” after my callsign. When my callsign is “BAW123”, they call me “BAW123 1123” and I do not know why this happens. When I select the Airbus in the Main Menu, all ATC settings are blank but I do not get rid of this “1123”.\n\nYou can still use the ICAO airline code with flight number on SimBrief. If you’re using the FBW A32NX aircraft, once you pull the flight plan from the SimBrief integration. Just change the flight number on the MCDU INIT A page. And the ATC will use that number instead.\n\nFor example: You create a SimBrief flight plan with DLH123. When you integrate the flight plan, the flight number will automatically set as DLH123. Then in that same Init A page, just type 123 and enter it to the Flight No. field, and it will replaced into 123.\n\nAs long as that field is entered, the ATC will use that number from that point on. So that way, you’re still technically be flying at DLH123, but ATC will refer you as “Lufthansa 123” as long as your ATC airline is filed with the correct callsign.\n\nSee how I do it in my flight video that I did earlier today.\n\nI would actually keep the atc_id assigned in each livery’s aircraft.cfg file. This is so that all the livery that you fly, automatically inherits the proper tail number fit for that livery. So that you don’t have to change tail number every time you change liveries.\n\nIt’s also recommended to fill in the atc_airlline field as this is what you use as callsign for the ATC. The problem with the customisation page in the MSFS menu is that, it’ll always Full Caps and you can’t enter space.\n\nSo if you want to use Air New Zealand livery, the proper callsign is “New Zealand”. But when you enter it through the Callsign in the customization menu, you’ll end up with NEWZEALAND. When this happens, the ATC will think that it’s an abbreviation, so it’ll call you as “En Ee Double You Zealand”.\n\nInstead, you can fill in the proper callsign in the atc_airline field in each of your livery’s aircraft.cfg so with my example above, you can enter it as atc_airline = “New Zealand” and the ATC will call you properly by saying “New Zealand”.\n\nYou also don’t need to keep filling in the customisation menu all the time. As long as you assign the proper atc_airline field in every livery’s aircraft.cfg file, you can change liveries whenever you want, and the callsign will automatically inherit as well."
