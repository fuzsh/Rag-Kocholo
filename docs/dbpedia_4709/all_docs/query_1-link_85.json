        "text": "HISTORY: CHINA SOUTHWEST AIRLINES was an airline with its head office on the property of Shuangliu Airport in Shuangliu County, Chengdu, Sichuan, People's Republic of China. On 28 October 2002, China Southwest Airlines was merged into Air China. Air China was established and commenced operations on 1 July 1988 as a result of the Chinese government's decision in late 1987 to split the operating divisions of Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) into six separate airlines: AIR CHINA (which inherited the IATA and ICAO code of the original CAAC) CHINA SOUTHWEST AIRLINES (merged with Air China in 2002, originally based in Chengdu) CHINA EASTERN AIRLINES (based in Shanghai) CHINA NORTHWEST AIRLINES (merged with China Eastern in 2002, originally based in Xi'an) CHINA SOUTHERN AIRLINES (based in Guangzhou) CHINA NORTHERN AIRLINES (merged with China Southern in 2003, originally based in Shenyang)"
