        "text": "The main reason for this is to avoid callsign confusion. I seem to recall that there is a computer in Eurocontrol somewhere which analyses the proposed callsigns and flags up if there is likely to be a clash between flights with similar callsigns operating at the same time in the same sectors (e.g. BAW123 vs AFR123, BAW123 vs BAW213, BAW123 vs BWA123 etc -- the potential for confusion should be obvious if those were on the same frequency at the same time). If necessary, the callsigns are then changed (which is why you end up with the alphanumeric callsigns like BAW12AB). Eurocontrol also recommend that no more than three digits are used for all-numeric callsigns, which is another issue for the particular flight mentioned!\n\nAlso, many flights are operated under a variety of different Flight Numbers, one for each of the partners in the group sharing the route. In these groups like \"One World\" and \"Star Alliance\" one of the group only actual operates the flight, but it is sold to passengers according to whichever airline they booked with. And although it usual is, it isn't necessarily the same operator every time, depending on resources, positioning and other assorted factors.\n\nYou can see this would be no good for unambiguous identification for ATC purposes.\n\nPete\n\nThe prefix in the call sign is specific to the carrier and subject to the issues noted above for flight number used for the suffix in the call sign. It's not always readily identifiable unless you're familiar with it. For example, British Airways flight 123 looks like BAW123 on your ticket, but the call sign used to and from ATC is \"Speedbird 123,\" Speedbird being BA's very classy call sign prefix. So call sign denotes what's used in radio communication with ATC. See the link for what's used for flight plans in the computer as opposed to the radio (called telephony in the link) and some detailed explanation. Here's a link to a list of company call signs.\n\nOne from the past is \"Clipper\" for Pan Am. Pan Am's once a day around the world flight westbound was \"Clipper 1\" and \"Clipper 2\" in the eastbound direction. It was flown at times with more than one aircraft type in the string of flights, and there were times when more than one \"Clipper 1\" was in the air, though of course at 747 speed or less, not in the same airspace."
