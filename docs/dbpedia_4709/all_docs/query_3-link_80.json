        "text": "Funny airport codes around the world\n\nUMM, OMG and FAB might sound like a text conversation on your middle school daughter’s phone. Believe it or not, these are real airport codes belonging to Summit, Alaska; Omega, Namibia; and Farnborough, England, respectively. Some airport codes are really straightforward, like ATL (Atlanta, Georgia). Other names like CAN (Guangzhou) and BOM (Mumbai) are the results of historical name changes for the destination, making them a little less intuitive to figure out. Then, of course, there are those airport codes that are just outright hilarious (LOL – Derby Field, Nevada) or really unfortunate (DIE – Arrachart, Madagascar). These are a few funny airport codes that had us laughing!\n\n1. GRR – Grand Rapids, Michigan\n\nWatch out for grrrizzlys.\n\n2. YUM – Yuma, Arizona\n\nSatisfactory dining not guaranteed.\n\n3. IOU – Île Ouen, New Caledonia\n\nOur first guess was Tightwad, Missouri.\n\n4. PEE – Perm, Russia\n\nWhy some travelers prefer the aisle seat.\n\n5. WOW – Willow, Alaska\n\nPrepare to be amazed!\n\n6. GAG – Gage, Oklahoma\n\nHow you feel when the person next to you on the plane whips out their egg salad sandwich.\n\n7. FUN – Funafuti, Tuvalu\n\nA beautiful, Polynesian atoll where fun means kicking back and relaxing in the sun.\n\n8. AWK – Wake Island Airfield\n\nLocated somewhere between your 7th-grade class photos and your high school prom.\n\n9. BUM – Butler Airport, Missouri\n\nMost elegant airport name–least elegant code.\n\n10. DAD – Da Nang, Vietnam\n\nWe’re still waiting for a great deal on flights from DAD to MOM (Letfotar Airport, Mauritania).\n\n11. COW – Coquimbo, Chile\n\nAptly named for the farm animals frequently blocking the landing strip.\n\n12. BRR – Barra, Scotland\n\nBarra’s climate is surprisingly mild.\n\n13. IDK – Indulkana, Australia\n\nYour recommendation for the next client who is unsure of where they want to travel.\n\n14. SAD – Safford, Arizona\n\nBecause SFO was already taken.\n\n15. EEK – Eek, Alaska\n\nNot for travelers with a serious fear of flying.\n\n16. BOO – Bodø, Norway\n\nSee above.\n\n17. DOH – Doha, Qatar\n\nWe’d like to see this as the airport code for Homer, Alaska.\n\n18. ODD – Oodnadatta, Australia\n\nProudly, the hottest, driest town in Australia.\n\nWhether you’re sending your travelers to YEP (Estevan Point, Canada) or NAH (Naha, Indonesia), we can all agree this job is much easier if you have a sense of humor!\n\nDid we miss any funny airport codes?
