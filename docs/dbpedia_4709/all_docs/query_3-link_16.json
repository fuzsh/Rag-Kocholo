        "text": "I have always wondered how airline came up with their radio calls signs for example; British Airways call is: \"Speedbird\", Virgin America's call is: \"Redwood\", Republic's call is \"Brickyard\", ExpressJet is now \"Acey\" but use to be \"Jet Link\" (which sounds more cooler) and Pinnacle call is: \"Flagship\"....\n\nI can understand a few of them.....\n\nVirgin America's HDQ is near Redwood California or something like that and Republic is out of the Indy area which has the \"yard of bricks\" @ Indianapolis Speedway.\n\nMy favorite was USA3000's callsign which was \"Get-away\" and their ICAO code was GWY. One the jokes floating around, and I hope no one takes offense to this, was the \"real\" callsign was \"Ghetto-way\" because their fares were so low at one point.\n\nThe weirdest one I can recall was when Xtra Airways went from \"Casino Express\" to \"Ruby Mountain\" for a year or so back in the late 2000s. Made no sense, especially since they kept the CXP ICAO code, and was a true mouth full on the radio.\n\nIIRC, \"Red Rock\" was based on something in the LAS area. Their ICAO was ROK.\n\nThere is an outdoors state park (actually it's called a National Conservation Area) near Las Vegas called Red Rock. National was already taken as a call sign so that is why another one had to be chosen. And actually, they kept flying until November 2002 - although I am sure that their business model wouldn't have survived today's fuel prices.\n\nCommutAir is CommutAir on the radio. Real creative, right.\n\nI think we should switch our callsign to Vibrator or Rough Ride, much more accurate description of our flights.\n\nOur ICAO is UCA and no one knows why.\n\nThere is a company out there with Rough Rider. I heard another one called Stalker which was interesting.\n\nCould be a military call sign\n\nSent via teletype\n\nYa, I'd guess Stalker is Military. Same with Vader, Crusher, etc. If it sounds really cool, it's probably military.\n\nWith Seaport and Sasquatch, they're on the same 135 cert as Wings of Alaska(out of Juneau), who I'm pretty sure came first, so that probably has something to do with their callsign."
