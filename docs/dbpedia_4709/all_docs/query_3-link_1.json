        "text": "Four-letter code designation for aviation facilities around the world\n\nFor a list of ICAO airport codes, see Lists of airports by IATA and ICAO code.\n\nNot to be confused with IATA airport code.\n\nThe ICAO airport code or location indicator is a four-letter code designating aerodromes around the world. These codes, as defined by the International Civil Aviation Organization and published quarterly in ICAO Document 7910: Location Indicators, are used by air traffic control and airline operations such as flight planning. ICAO codes are also used to identify other aviation facilities such as weather stations, international flight service stations or area control centers, whether or not they are located at airports. Flight information regions are also identified by a unique ICAO-code.\n\nICAO codes are separate and different from IATA codes, the latter of which have three letters and are generally used for airline timetables, reservations, and baggage tags. For example, the IATA code for London's Heathrow Airport is LHR and its ICAO code is EGLL. IATA codes are commonly seen by passengers and the general public on flight-tracking services such as FlightAware.\n\nIn general IATA codes are usually derived from the name of the airport or the city it serves, while ICAO codes are distributed by region and country. Far more aerodromes (in the broad sense) have ICAO codes than IATA codes, which are sometimes assigned to railway stations as well. The selection of ICAO codes is partly delegated to authorities in each country, while IATA codes, which have no geographic structure, must be decided centrally by IATA.\n\nThe first one or two letters of the ICAO code indicate the country; the remaining letters identify the airport. ICAO codes are used partly for geographical context. For example, the ICAO code for Heathrow International Airport in London, is EGLL, with its first letters reflecting that it is based in the United Kingdom. On the other hand, IATA codes do not provide geographic reference. For example, LHR, representing Heathrow, does not enable one to deduce the location of the airport LHV with any greater certainty; it is William T. Piper Memorial Airport in Lock Haven, Pennsylvania in the United States.\n\nThere are a few exceptions to the regional structure of the ICAO code that have been historically for political or administrative reasons. RAF Mount Pleasant air base in the Falkland Islands, for instance, is assigned the ICAO code EGYP as though it were in the United Kingdom, but nearby civilian Port Stanley Airport is assigned SFAL, consistent with South America. Saint Pierre and Miquelon is controlled by France, and airports there are assigned LFxx as though they were in Europe. Kosovo is assigned the code BKxx grouping it with Greenland and Iceland rather than its geographical neighbors which have Lxxx (described below). Jerusalem International Airport was assigned both LLJR (its Israeli persona) as well as OJJR (its Jordanian persona), but the airport itself fell into disuse.\n\nIn the contiguous United States and Canada, many airports have ICAO codes that are simply copies of their three-letter IATA codes, with the geographical prefix added on (e.g., YEG and CYEG both refer to Edmonton International Airport, while IAD and KIAD both refer to Washington Dulles International Airport). This similarity does not extend to Alaska (PAxx), Hawaii (PHxx), or U.S. territories. Kahului Airport on Maui, for instance, has an IATA code of OGG and an ICAO code of PHOG.\n\nICAO airport codes do not begin with I or J or X or Q, though the Jezero Crater on Mars is assigned the special ICAO code JZRO.[1] Codes beginning with I (Ixx and Ixxx) are often used for navigational aids such as radio beacons, while the Q code is reserved for international radiocommunications and non-geographical special use.\n\nIn Russia, Latin letter X, or its Morse/Baudot Cyrillic equivalent Ь, are used to designate government, military, and experimental aviation airfields in internal airfield codes similar in structure and purpose to ICAO codes but not used internationally.[2] ZZZZ is a pseudo-code, used in flight plans for aerodromes with no ICAO code assigned.\n\nICAO codes are sometimes updated. Johannesburg Airport in Johannesburg, South Africa, for instance, was formerly known as Jan Smuts International Airport, with code FAJS. When the airport was renamed O. R. Tambo International Airport, its ICAO code was updated to FAOR.\n\nSome airports have two ICAO codes, usually when an airport is shared by civilian and military users. Frankfurt Airport in Frankfurt, Germany, for instance, has been assigned ICAO code EDDF while Rhein-Main Air Base was assigned ICAO code EDAF until its closure. Sion Airport in Switzerland has code LSGS while its military facilities have the ICAO code LSMS. Brussels Airport in Brussels, Belgium, has the ICAO code EBBR for its civilian facilities, and Melsbroek Air Base has been assigned ICAO code EBMB, even though the two airports share runways and ground and air control facilities.\n\nIn small countries like Belgium or the Netherlands, almost all aerodromes have an ICAO code. For larger countries like the UK or Germany this is not feasible, given the limited number of letter codes. Some countries have addressed this issue by introducing a scheme of sub-ICAO aerodrome codes; France, for example, assigns pseudo ICAO codes in the style LFddnn, where dd indicates the department while nn is a sequential counter. The French Federation of Ultralight Motorized Gliders was formally named the keeper of these codes. Aerodrome de Torreilles in France, for instance, has code LF6651.[3] In Antarctica many aerodromes have pseudo ICAO-codes with AT and two digits, while others have proper codes from countries performing air control such as NZ for New Zealand.\n\nPrefix code Country A – Western South Pacific AG Solomon Islands AN Nauru AY Papua New Guinea B – Greenland, Iceland, and Kosovo (European Alternate) BG Greenland BI Iceland BK Kosovo C – Canada C Canada D – Eastern parts of West Africa and Maghreb DA Algeria DB Benin DF Burkina Faso DG Ghana DI Côte d'Ivoire DN Nigeria DR Niger DT Tunisia DX Togo E – Northern Europe EB Belgium ED Germany (civil) EE Estonia EF Finland EG United Kingdom (and Crown Dependencies) EH Netherlands EI Ireland EK Denmark and the Faroe Islands EL Luxembourg EN Norway EP Poland ES Sweden ET Germany (military) EV Latvia EY Lithuania F – Most of Central Africa, Southern Africa, and the Indian Ocean FA South Africa FB Botswana FC Republic of the Congo FD Eswatini FE Central African Republic FG Equatorial Guinea FH Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha FI Mauritius FJ British Indian Ocean Territory FK Cameroon FL Zambia FM Comoros, France (Mayotte and Réunion), and Madagascar FN Angola FO Gabon FP São Tomé and Príncipe FQ Mozambique FS Seychelles FT Chad FV Zimbabwe FW Malawi FX Lesotho FY Namibia FZ Democratic Republic of the Congo G – Western parts of West Africa and Maghreb GA Mali GB The Gambia GC Spain (Canary Islands) GE Spain (Ceuta and Melilla) GF Sierra Leone GG Guinea-Bissau GL Liberia GM Morocco GO Senegal GQ Mauritania GS Western Sahara GU Guinea GV Cape Verde H – East Africa and Northeast Africa HA Ethiopia HB Burundi HC Somalia (including Somaliland) HD Djibouti HE Egypt HH Eritrea HJ South Sudan HK Kenya HL Libya HR Rwanda HS Sudan HT Tanzania HU Uganda J – Mars J Mars[dubious – discuss] K – Contiguous United States K Contiguous United States L – Southern Europe, Cyprus, Israel, Palestine and Turkey LA Albania LB Bulgaria LC Cyprus LD Croatia LE Spain (mainland section and Balearic Islands) LF France (Metropolitan France; including Saint-Pierre and Miquelon) LG Greece LH Hungary LI Italy (and San Marino) LJ Slovenia LK Czech Republic LL Israel LM Malta LN Monaco LO Austria LP Portugal (including the Azores and Madeira) LQ Bosnia and Herzegovina LR Romania LS Switzerland and Liechtenstein LT Turkey LU Moldova LV Palestine/Palestinian territories LW North Macedonia LX Gibraltar LY Serbia and Montenegro LZ Slovakia M – Central America, Mexico and northern/western parts of the Caribbean MB Turks and Caicos Islands MD Dominican Republic MG Guatemala MH Honduras MK Jamaica MM Mexico MN Nicaragua MP Panama MR Costa Rica MS El Salvador MT Haiti MU Cuba MW Cayman Islands MY Bahamas MZ Belize N – Most of the South Pacific and New Zealand NC Cook Islands NF Fiji, Tonga NG Kiribati (Gilbert Islands), Tuvalu NI Niue NL France (Wallis and Futuna) NS Samoa, United States (American Samoa) NT France (French Polynesia) NV Vanuatu NW France (New Caledonia) NZ New Zealand, parts of Antarctica O – Southwest Asia, including Gulf States, Iran, Iraq, Pakistan OA Afghanistan OB Bahrain OE Saudi Arabia OI Iran OJ Jordan and the West Bank OK Kuwait OL Lebanon OM United Arab Emirates OO Oman OP Pakistan OR Iraq OS Syria OT Qatar OY Yemen P – most of the North Pacific, and Kiribati PA US (Alaska) (also PF, PO and PP) PB US (Baker Island) PC Kiribati (Canton Airfield, Phoenix Islands) PF US (Alaska) (also PA, PO and PP) PG US (Guam, Northern Mariana Islands) PH US (Hawaii) PJ US (Johnston Atoll) PK Marshall Islands PL Kiribati (Line Islands) PM US (Midway Island) PO US (Alaska) (also PA, PF and PP) PP US (Alaska) (also PA, PF and PO) PT Federated States of Micronesia, Palau PW US (Wake Island) R – Japan, S.
