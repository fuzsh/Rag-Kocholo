For instance, flightaware.com/live/flight/RLK8077\n\nThis flight doesn’t exist. RLK is Air Link, which is the ICAO callsign for Air Nelson. The IATA flight code is NZ8077, but the callsign used on the radio and on the radar is RLK77, or perhaps RLK077.\n\nMount Cook Airlines is another good example:\n\nflightaware.com/live/flight/NZM5221 NZM (Mount Cook) 221. The correct ICAO callsign is NZM221. The correct IATA callsign is NZ5221. But the CORRECT callsign is NZM221.\n\nSo, why is the data showing on here a blend of the two callsigns, creating one that is incorrect on both counts? What was wrong with the old way, which was to always display the ICAO code that came straight from the feed provided by Airways New Zealand?\n\nThis is actually by-design. That particular flight indeed operated with a callsign on ATC as RLK77, but we have published flight schedule information from the airline that specifically lists the flight number from CHC-IVC as being flight number 8077. Therefore, we combine the data together and use the official flight number that the schedule information is published as using.\n\nThis is the same case. We have actual flight schedule information from the airline that says their AKL-PMR flight is numbered 5221, even though the callsign that they operate over ATC might be 221.\n\nIt’s common for airlines to use a slight variation of their flight number when generating the callsign used with ATC. Sometimes it’s a variation that involves removing digits or sometimes it is appending extra letters. This is typically done for brevity or to avoid a confusing conflict between similarly numbered flights that might be operating at the same time. Since our users are typically interested in finding the flight based on the scheduled number that they booked their ticket using (not off of the ATC callsign), that is what we canonicalize our flight idents to. We have plans to store the original ATC callsign and allow users to search for a flight using either, but that’s not quite ready yet."
