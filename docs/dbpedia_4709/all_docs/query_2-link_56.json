        "text": "special\n\nThrough check-in\n\nPassengers are automatically checked in for flights with direct service (one or more stops with no change of aircraft). Passengers making a connection will need to check in again at their point of transfer with an agent at the gate. Checked luggage will be checked through to the passenger's final destination at their point of origin.\n\nSeat requests\n\nSouthwest Airlines has an open seating policy. If you have a condition which requires a special seating arrangement, please speak with a Customer Service Agent when checking in at the ticket counter. Pre-boarding is available to nonrevenue passengers who qualify only if a boarding pass can be issued to the passenger prior to general boarding.\n\nInfant safety seats\n\nAll infants must have a ticket to use an infant safety seat on an aircraft.\n\nProper use of a Child Restraint Systems (CRS) enhances child safety onboard the aircraft. For this reason, Southwest Airlines and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) strongly recommend that infants and small children who weigh under 40 pounds be secured in an appropriate CRS when traveling by air.\n\nBe sure to check the width of your CRS. Although the width of aircraft seats varies, a safety seat wider than 16 inches is unlikely to fit, even if the armrests of the aircraft seats are moved out of the way. An ill-fitting safety seat will not provide adequate protection for your child.\n\nThe FAA has banned the use on board aircraft of certain types of CRSs that may be harmful to a child in the event of an aviation emergency. These include backless booster seats, safety belt extensions (commonly referred to as 'belly belts'), and vest or harness devices that attach to an adult. Although some that were manufactured before the FAA's ban may carry an insignia and/or language indicating they are approved for aircraft use, please understand that they are no longer permitted.\n\nApproved Child Restraint Systems\n\nMany of these carry the FMVSS.213 insignia and/or language indicating that they are 'approved for use in motor vehicles and on aircraft'.\n\nAny CRS manufactured between January 1, 1961 and February 25, 1985, must have the following label: 'This child restraint device conforms to all applicable federal motor vehicle safety standards'.\n\nAny CRS manufactured since February 26, 1985, must have both of the following labels: 'This child restraint device conforms to all applicable federal motor vehicle safety standards' and 'This restraint is certified for use in motor vehicles and aircraft'.\n\nHarness-type devices approved by the FAA:\n\nAt this time, the FAA has approved only the AmSafe Aviation CARES, which is appropriate for children weighing between 22 and 44 pounds.\n\nThe AmSafe Aviation CARES must have a label indicating 'FAA Approved in Accordance with 14CFR 21.305(d), Approved for Aircraft Use Only'.\n\nUnaccompanied minors\n\nChildren ages five through 11 traveling without an accompanying Passenger age 12 or older must travel as an Unaccompanied Minor (UM) on Southwest Airlines.\n\nSouthwest Airlines will charge $50 each way ($100 roundtrip) in addition to the air fare per child for UMs to travel.\n\nUMs may only travel on nonstop flights.\n\nSouthwest will not transport UMs on flights that may be diverted or cancelled due to inclement weather or other operational abnormalities.\n\nWhen making a nonrevenue listing for an Unaccompanied Minor, please make sure to have the following information available:\n\nThe child's full name\n\nYour relationship to the child\n\nAddress\n\nTelephone number(s), including area code\n\nChild's date of birth\n\nInformation about both the parent/guardian dropping off and the one picking him/her up.\n\nContact information for an alternate designee at the child's destination.\n\nMake copies of the UM's itinerary for both the UM and the parent/guardian picking up the child in the destination city."
