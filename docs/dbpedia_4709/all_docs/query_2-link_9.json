        "text": "Our Purpose\n\nTo connect People to what's important in their lives through friendly, reliable, and low-cost air travel.\n\nOur Vision\n\nTo be the world's most loved, most efficient, and most profitable airline.\n\nHistory\n\nWe weren't just airborne yesterdayâtime flies when you're having fun!\n\nThe Southwest Airlines Code of Conduct outlines our commitments to our Employees. We strive to operate our airline safely, efficiently, and with integrity. Every individual affiliated with our airline is expected to uphold the standards set in our Company policies and guidelines. Southwest is the airline with Heart, and our work should also demonstrate our Companyâs Values and policies.\"\n\nSouthwest has been in LUV with our Customers from the very beginning. Therefore, it's fitting that we began service to San Antonio and Houston from Love Field in Dallas on June 18, 1971. As our Company and Customers grew, our LUV grew too! With Flight Attendants serving \"Love Bites\" on our planes and determined Employees issuing tickets from our \"Love Machines,\" we changed the face of the airline industry throughout the 1970s. Then in 1977, our stock was listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol \"LUV.\" Over the ensuing years, our LUV has spread from coast-to-coast and border-to-border thanks to our hardworking Employees and their LUV for Customer Service."
