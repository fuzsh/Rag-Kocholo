        "text": "¶ Introduction\n\nAs an aircraft has the possibility to use radio communication as a transmitting station on the air, it must have a unique designation named call sign.\n\nThis call sign must be normally used during air band radio transmissions.\n\nA call sign shall be one of the following types:\n\nThe characters corresponding to the registration marking of the aircraft.\n\nThe telephony designator of the aircraft operating company or agency, followed by the last four characters of the registration marking of the aircraft.\n\nThe telephony designator of the aircraft operating company or agency, followed by the flight identification.\n\nThe aircraft operating company or agency type is the most widely used within commercial aviation. The flight identification is usually the flight number or flight identification.\n\n¶ Radio usability\n\nOn initial contact, a pilot must spell his complete call sign, usually at the end of his message. Always pronounce each digit separately.\n\nAfter good communication has been established, the abbreviated call sign may be used when initiated by ATC\n\n¶ Aircraft Abbreviated Callsign Rules\n\nAfter satisfactory communication has been established, and provided that no confusion is likely to occur, aircraft call signs may be abbreviated as follows:\n\nthe first and at least the last two characters of the aircraft registration;\n\nthe telephony designator of the aircraft operating agency followed by at least the last two characters of the aircraft registration;\n\nNo abbreviated form.\n\nA pilot shall use his abbreviated call sign only after the air traffic controller has taken the initiative.\n\nAir traffic controllers can use abbreviated call signs only after satisfactory communication has been established and no confusion with other aircraft on your frequency is possible.\n\nAny aircraft in the heavy wake turbulence category shall include the word \"HEAVY\" immediately after the aircraft call sign in the initial contact between such aircraft and ATS units. The word \"SUPER\" shall be used for an Airbus 380 aircraft.\n\n¶ Example of abbreviated call signs\n\nAircraft call signs may be abbreviated with the first and at least the last two characters of the aircraft registration.\n\nOOFWA OSCAR _ _ WHISKEY ALFA N202PY NOVEMBER _ _ _ PAPA YANKEE\n\nNOVEMBER _ _ TWO PAPA YANKEE\n\nEither the name of the aircraft manufacturer or the aircraft model may be used instead of the first character.\n\nOOFWA Robin _ _ _ WHISKEY ALPHA\n\nRobin _ _ FOXTROT WHISKEY ALPHA OOTMG Piper _ _ _ MIKE GOLF\n\nPiper _ _ TANGO MIKE GOLF\n\nThe telephony designator of the aircraft operating agency or company call sign followed by at least the last two characters of the registration.\n\nSpeedbird (BAW2595)\n\nRegistered as GBOAC SPEEDBIRD _ _ _ ALPHA CHARLIE\n\nSPEEDBIRD _ _ OSCAR ALPHA CHARLIE\n\n¶ Call sign confusion\n\nAir traffic controllers must pay attention to call sign confusion when two or more flights with similar flight numbers fly close to each other.\n\nExample: KLM685 and KLM689 / BAW556 and BAW665 / AFR 324 and AFR 342\n\nAir traffic controllers must pay attention that they do not use duplicate abbreviated call signs when 2 or more aircraft share the same. In that case, you must use the complete call sign.\n\nExample: DEHLB and DAHLB share the same abbreviated call sign D_LB\n\nWhen there is any risk of confusion, the full call sign shall be used all the time.\n\n¶ Aircraft registration call sign (country based)\n\nAll aircraft have a unique registration call sign based on the home country.\n\nThe aircraft registration call sign is a group of characters and it is constructed with:\n\n- a prefix : the nationality or common mark\n\n- a suffix : registration mark\n\nSpell the call sign on frequency using the NATO Alphabet only.\n\nCallsign Prefix Callsign spelling Country OOTWA OO OSCAR OSCAR TANGO WISKEY ALFA Belgium DEDJF D DELTA ECHO DELTA JULIETT FOXTROT Germany FCYAB F FOXTROT CHARLIE YANKEE ALFA BRAVO France N04252 N NOVEMBER ZERO FOUR TWO FIVE TWO USA\n\n¶ ICAO airline designator\n\nThe ICAO airline designator is a code assigned by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) to aircraft operating agencies, aeronautical authorities, and services related to international aviation.\n\nICAO formatted call signs start with the 3 letter ICAO code of the airline (prefix) followed by a telephony designator. Each aircraft have a unique call sign with ICAO designator.\n\nCallsign ICAO Code Prefix spelling Full callsign spelling VIP 418 VIP Freewings Freewings FOUR ONE EIGHT SVA 011 SVA Saudi Saudi ZERO ONE ONE BCS 666 BCS Eurotrans Eurotrans SIX SIX SIX DLH 1EE DLH Lufthansa Lufthansa ONE ECHO ECHO BAW 4212 BAW Speedbird Speedbird FOUR TWO ONE TWO\n\nBe careful that the prefix spelling can be very different from the real company name. Example: BAW = Speedbird (prefix spelling) = British Airways (company)\n\n¶ IATA airline designators\n\nIATA airline designators are two-character codes assigned by the International Air Transport Association (IATA) to the world's airlines.\n\nAirline designator codes follow the 2 alphanumeric characters (letters or digits). It can be followed by an optional letter.\n\nThese IATA airline designators are used in real aviation for company flight tickets and at check-in desks.\n\nExamples: SN2268 TV884 KL1722 AF301\n\nIn real life IATA abbreviations are NOT used by ATC, pilots and in flight plans. Only ICAO call signs are used.\n\nDo not mix IATA designator and reduced ICAO prefix from 3 characters to 2 characters. In real aviation, some airlines use reduced ICAO prefix for their flights."
