I’d also be interested if maybe anyone could personally suggest a realistic aircraft delivery route that you’ve tried in IF…\n\nThanks.\n\nDon’t know if I’m wrong, but I’ve seen several ferry/delivery flights use one 9 or two at the beginnings of their flight numbers, usually four digits.\n\nExample: DAL9922. A 777-200LR Delivery from Paine Field (KPAE) to Atlanta (KATL)\n\nTest flights should be the manufacturers name. Like Boeing is BOE and Airbus is AIB, but when delivering it’s always different. Some airlines have it the same like their callsign but with the aircrafts number as the flight number. But if you replicating one in real life. Look it up and track it. It will help. Not a lot of activity during these times though :)\n\nLufthansa use 99XX for such flights normally.\n\nSWISS uses 5XXX if I am not mistaken…\n\nFor test flights at Airbus they use Airbus and some kind of alphanumerical number (e.g. Airbus 04BX or Airbus 01BM are currently flying)."
