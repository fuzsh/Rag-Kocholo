        "text": "If you have already made a written complaint to an airline or airport and you are not satisfied with the outcome or have not received a reply within 8 weeks, the CAA's Passenger Advice and Complaints Team (PACT) may be able to help.\n\nPACT is only likely to consider your complaint if the airline or airport you've complained to is not a member of a CAA-approved ADR body.\n\nFollowing a review of our complaint handling activities the Passenger Advice and Complaints Team (PACT) will only handle complaints related to:\n\nUK261 for delayed and cancelled flights, downgrade and denied boarding,\n\nUK1107 about assistance for disabled and reduced mobility passengers,\n\nand\n\nThe Montreal Convention for cases of lost, delayed or damaged baggage.\n\nPACT will advise on whether we think you have a valid complaint, and if so will take it up with the business concerned, but we do not have the legal powers to impose a solution on an airline.\n\nIf you are dissatisfied with the opinion the CAA has provided, you can take legal action against the airline or airport, but you cannot appeal against the CAA's decision.\n\nIn addition, there are strict time limits in relation to taking legal action therefore, we will not handle complaints where there is less than a year to take legal action.\n\nHow to submit a claim to the CAA\n\nPlease use our online form to send us the details of your complaint against the airline or airport, this will tell you if your complaint is one that we can help you with. You don't have to fill it out all in one go.\n\nIn order for us to progress your complaint, we will need copies of your supporting information:\n\nCopies of letters or emails to the airline/airport\n\nCopies of the letters the airline/airport sent to you\n\nDetails of your flight (flight number, date, time, route, airline reference, number of passengers on the booking)\n\nFor expenses claims, copies of receipts\n\nFor baggage claims specifically:\n\nProof of address\n\nA copy of your Property Irregularity Report (if you have one).\n\nIf your bag was delayed: A list of the first need, essential items that you purchased while without your delayed baggage, along with associated dated and itemised receipts (if your banking details are visible, please ensure they are redacted).\n\nIf your bag was lost: A list of the lost items with associated dated and itemised receipts (if your banking details are visible, please ensure they are redacted). If you no longer hold receipts for these items, please provide information relating to the manufacturers name, product name, product cost, age of the item and further product information from the website of the manufacturer.\n\nIf your baggage was damaged: A list of the damaged items with photos of the damage, as well as associated dated and itemised receipts (if your banking details are visible, please ensure they are redacted). If you no longer hold receipts for these items, please provide information relating to the manufacturers name, product name, product cost and further product information from the website of the manufacturer. If you prefer the item to be repaired, we would require a copy of the repair invoice/estimate.\n\nScans of these can be uploaded and attached to the online form.\n\nWe will send you a response by email to let you know we have received your complaint, but we will be unable to progress it until we have received all of the relevant supporting documentation.\n\nYour complaint will be managed in our iCasework system. For information on the accessibility status of this system please refer to the iCasework Accessibility Statement.\n\nIf you are visually impaired and require assistance with logging your claim please do not hesitate to contact the team via email on passenger.complaints@caa.co.uk or via phone 0330 022 1916\n\nClaim application form\n\nWhat to expect\n\nPlease note that the below timeframes are a guideline and due to a large increase in the demand for our services our response times are taking longer than usual for us to process your complaint. We appreciate your patience while we work to reduce this.\n\nOur initial assessment of your complaint will take about one week if we have received all of the correct supporting documents from you. If your complaint is within our scope, we will then ask the airline or airport to reassess it in light of the relevant legislation and guidelines.\n\nWe should receive a response from the airline or airport within four weeks, although this may vary, and if we challenge the airport or airline for further information it can take another two weeks.\n\nOnce we have received all the information we require it will take us five weeks to contact you with a final assessment of your situation. For a visual representation of this process, see our process diagram.\n\nIf you are dissatisfied with the opinion the CAA has provided you can take legal action against the airline or airport, but you cannot appeal against the CAAâ€™s decision.\n\nSpecific circumstances\n\nIf you have been booked on a flight in the last three years that was cancelled or delayed by over 3 hours, we would like to hear how satisfied you were with your airline's response by filling in our survey.\n\nFurther information"
