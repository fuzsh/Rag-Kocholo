        "text": "Airport Data Dictionary ElementDescriptionCallsign\n\nA call sign is used to uniquely identify an aircraft using the airspace around a particular airport. Call signs in aviation are derived from several different policies, depending upon the type of flight operation. In most countries, unscheduled general aviation flights identify themselves using the call sign corresponding to the aircraft's registration number. Commercial operators, including scheduled airline, air cargo and air taxi operators, will usually use an ICAO or FAA-registered call sign for their company. These will typically consist of the ICAO code of the operating airline followed by a flight identification. The flight identification is very often the same as the flight number, but could be different due to call sign confusion, if two or more flights close to each other have similar flight numbers (i.e. KLM649 and KLM645 or BAW466 and BAW646).\n\nFlightId\n\nIATA based identifier for this flight, usually issued long before the flight actually takes place.\n\nFlightId is normally the concatenation of OperatingAirlineIATA, FlightNumber and OperationalSuffix.\n\nFlightId typically identifies a flight to the majority of systems, but it is not unique across time. It's unique only in conjunction with FlightDepartureDate.\n\nException: Some airlines use their ICAO code (OperatingAirlineICAO) instead of OperatingAirlineIATA. This might be because they aren't an IATA member or because they just prefer the ICAO code. Regardless, this means that it is allowed to use OperatingAirlineICAO as part of FlightId.\n\nFlightId is then defined as the concatenation of AirlineIATAorICAO, FlightNumber and OperationalSuffix.\n\nOperatingAirlineICAO\n\nUse the ICAO code for the helicopter operator if that is available.\n\nThe ICAO code of the airline operating the flight. See AirlineICAO for definition of term.\n\nOperatingAirlineCodeSome code, typically neither IATA nor ICAO, for the operating airline. System specific content.OperatingAirlineNameThe name of the operating airline.FlightRouteOperator\n\nThe party operating the flight route. This will often be a company that has hired the airline to operate a given route.\n\nHelicopterTypeA code indicating which type of helicopter this is. Not standardized.HelicopterTypeDescriptionDescriptive text for HelicopterTypeAircraftICAOType\n\n3-4 character code as designated by International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) to uniquely designate Aircraft Type. Local (non-ICAO) codes can be added as required as long as they are unique for aircraft types within the defined context.\n\nReference Document: ICAO document 8643.\n\nAircraftConfigVersion\n\nDetailed information about the aircraft configuration, received in the aircraft_conf_version field in the ASM and SSM IATA messages.\n\nAircraftTailNumber\n\nTail number painted on the tail used by some carriers as an aircraft identifier. Often the last 3 characters of AircraftRegistration.\n\nHelicopterFlightStatusA code indicating the status of the whole helicopter flight, from departure to final arrival if this was a multi hop flight. Not strictly standardized.FlightLegStatusThe status of a \"FlightLeg\". The following values are defined: \"SCH\", \"FPL\", \"FLS\", \"ACT\", \"CAN\", \"LAN\", \"RER\", \"DIV\", \"DEL\", \"UNK\"FlightIsCancelledSet to true if the flight operation is cancelled. For flight as with code share it's possible to only cancel the code shared flight.FlightServiceTypeIATA\n\nIATA SSIM Appendix C Service Types.\n\nFlightServiceTypeExtended\n\nInstallation/customer specific set of flight service types. Typically used when the defined set in FlightServiceType isn't specific enough. Encoded as integer to clearly separate it from FlightServiceType.\n\nFirst departureThe following elements are for the first departure (if multi hop)DepartureAirportIATA\n\nEither the departure airport or the arrival airport must be a \"proper\" IATA airport.\n\nDeparture airport IATA code (see AirportIATA for description of term).\n\nDepartureHeliportNameName of the departure heliport.DepartureHeliportTypeType of the departure heliport. Not strictly defined.SOBTScheduled Off-Block Time. The time that an aircraft is scheduled to depart from its parking position. Always UTC time.EOBTEstimated Off-Block Time. The estimated time at which the aircraft will start movement associated with departure. Always UTC time.TOBTTarget Off-Block Time. The time that an Aircraft Operator or Ground Handler estimates that an aircraft will be ready, all doors closed, boarding bridge removed, push back vehicle available and ready to start up / push back immediately upon reception of clearance from the TWR. Always UTC time.AOBTActual Off-Block Time. Time the aircraft pushes back / vacates the parking position. (Equivalent to Airline / Handlers ATD – Actual Time of Departure & ACARS=OUT). Always UTC time.ETOTEstimated Take Off Time. The estimated take off time taking into account the EOBT plus EXOT. Always UTC time.ATOTActual Take Off Time. The time that an aircraft takes off from the runway. (Equivalent to ATC ATD–Actual Time of Departure, ACARS = OFF). Always UTC time.GateUniquely defines one gate at the airport.MailWeightLoadedWeight in Kilos of mail loaded onto the aircraft.CargoWeightLoadedWeight in Kilos of cargo (freight) loaded onto the aircraft at the current airport.PaxBoardingThe number of \"seated passengers\" boarding the aircraft, infants excluded.\n\nPaxBoarding = PaxAdultBoarding + PaxChildBoarding Last arrivalThe following elements are for the last arrival (if multi hop)ArrivalAirportIATA\n\nEither the departure airport or the arrival airport must be a \"proper\" IATA airport.\n\nArrival airport IATA code (see AirportIATA for description of term).AIBTActual In-Block Time. The time that an aircraft arrives in-blocks. (Equivalent to Airline/Handler ATA –Actual Time of Arrival, ACARS = IN). Always UTC time.ELDTEstimated Landing Time. The estimated time that an aircraft will touchdown on the runway. (Equivalent to ATC ETA–Estimated Time of Arrival = landing). Always UTC time.ALDTActual Landing Time. The time that an aircraft lands on a runway. (Equivalent to ATC ATA –Actual Time of Arrival = landing, ACARS=ON). Always UTC time.MailWeightUnloadedWeight in Kilos of mail unloaded off the aircraft.CargoWeightUnloadedWeight in Kilos of cargo (freight) unloaded off the aircraft at the current airport.PaxDisembarkingThe number of passengers and passive crew disembarking the plane, infants excluded.\n\nPaxDisembarking = PaxAdultDisembarking + PaxChildDisembarkingViasIf multi hop the structure below describe the via helipads"
