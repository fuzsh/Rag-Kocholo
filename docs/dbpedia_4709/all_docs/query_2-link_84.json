        "text": "Update: Some offers mentioned below are no longer available.\n\nIn the week that keeps on giving, Southwest Airlines is offering customers up to 40% off base fares for select travel from Jan. 30 to May 22.\n\nFlights must be booked by Thursday, and blackout dates and routes apply.\n\nBased on a test search for this story, one-way flights are available starting at $39.\n\nDeal basics\n\nAirline: Southwest\n\nRoutes: Across the Southwest network\n\nHow to book: Directly with the airline, using the code \"WOW\"\n\nTravel dates: Jan. 30-May 22\n\nBook by: 11:59 p.m. PST on Thursday\n\nBlackout dates: Blackout dates vary based on the route, including over spring break. See here for the exact dates.\n\nFor this sale, the discounted percentage amount depends on the day of travel. For travel within the continental U.S., get up to 40% off fares for travel on Tuesday and Wednesday. Get up to 30% off fares for travel on Monday and Thursday, and up to 25% off for Saturday travel. Fares for travel on Friday and Sunday are up to 20% off. Fares for travel to Hawaii and Puerto Rico are up to 30% off.\n\nThis sale is for one-way and round-trip Wanna Get Away and Wanna Get Away Plus fares. Both types of fares include two free checked bags and two free carry-on items and can be canceled up to 10 minutes before departure for free changes. However, Wanna Get Away fares are not refundable. Both fares also include free inflight entertainment and messaging.\n\nIn addition to cash bookings, Rapid Rewards redemptions are discounted. You'll save 50% on the regular award rate before the mandatory September 11 Security Fee.\n\nSample flights\n\nTo search for this deal, filter for flights from your desired airport and enter the promo code \"WOW\" to get the applicable discount. You'll see a green pop-up message indicating the promo code has been applied.\n\nFor example, this round-trip, nonstop flight from Chicago's Midway International Airport (MDW) to New York's LaGuardia Airport (LGA) in late January is available starting at $106.\n\nYou can book this same flight for 6,060 points plus $11.20 in taxes and fees.\n\nRemember, travelers can apply the discount code to any route Southwest flies, with one-way flights starting as low as $39.\n\nMaximize your purchase\n\nTo book this deal, use a credit card that earns bonus points on airfare purchases. Southwest frequent flyers should use the Southwest Rapid Rewards Priority Credit Card or the Southwest Rapid Rewards Premier Credit Card to earn 3 Rapid Rewards points on Southwest purchases or the Southwest Rapid Rewards Plus Credit Card to earn 2 points.\n\nThe information for the Southwest Rapid Rewards Premier has been collected independently by The Points Guy. The card details on this page have not been reviewed or provided by the card issuer.\n\nOtherwise, consider using:\n\nChase Sapphire Preferred Card: 2 points per dollar spent on travel\n\nAmerican Express® Gold Card: 3 points per dollar spent on airfare when booked directly with the airline or through American Express Travel\n\nThe Platinum Card® from American Express: 5 points per dollar spent on airfare when booked directly with the airline or through American Express Travel, on up to $500,000 of these purchases per calendar year\n\nChase Sapphire Reserve: 3 points per dollar spent on airfare\n\nCiti Strata Premier℠ Card (see rates and fees): 3 points per dollar spent on air travel\n\nBottom line\n\nThough this sale is not quite as discounted as the 50% off flights we saw with September's \"WOW\" sale, it's still worth considering for domestic travel within the U.S. through spring. Also, this sale is appealing for Southwest travelers with a Companion Pass since a friend or family member can join you on your discounted flights for just the cost of taxes and fees.\n\nIf you've already booked travel for this winter and early spring, it may be worth re-pricing your reservations since Southwest doesn't apply change fees. If you change your existing flights for lower fare as part of this sale, you'll receive a credit for the difference.\n\nTo take advantage of this sale, book your flights by the end of the day Thursday.\n\nRelated reading:"
