        "text": "From Nicole Yang in Paris: The US women’s basketball team won Olympic gold Sunday afternoon, continuing its reign of dominance on the international stage.\n\nThe game wasn’t pretty and the stats weren’t impressive, but Team USA held off a pesky French squad, 67-66, at Bercy Arena to earn an eighth consecutive gold medal.\n\nNeither the US nor France could buy a bucket in the first half, as both teams shot under 30 percent from the field. France made 11 of its 40 attempts, while the US made 8 of 28, to head into halftime tied at 25 apiece.\n\nFrance opened the second half with a 10-0 run, its largest of the game, but Team USA answered with a 8-0 run of its own. The teams then proceeded to trade baskets until the very end, as neither led by more than 4 points at any point in the fourth quarter.\n\nTeam USA, which had averaged 89.8 points per game headed into Sunday, scored its lowest point total of the Games.\n\nCenter A’ja Wilson once again was Team USA’s leading scorer, with 21 points on 6 of 14 shooting (43 percent) in 33 minutes. The US finished with its worst field goal percentage of the Games, making just 34 percent of its shots.\n\nThe French certainly gave the American women their toughest game of the Olympics, as the US had won their previous five games by an average of 18.6 points. Sunday’s game featured 11 lead changes and six ties.\n\nCheering on Team USA courtside were Derrick White, LeBron James, and Bam Adebayo from the gold medal-winning men’s basketball team.\n\nWith Sunday’s win, the US has now won 61 straight games at the Olympics. The American women have not lost since 1992, medaling in every Olympics they’ve participated in since 1976. Their run of eight straight Olympic gold medals is the longest streak in a traditional team sport. Read more here from Yang.\n\nMedal alert! American Jennifer Valente won gold in the cycling track women’s Omnium points race.\n\nUS wins bronze: Adrian Weinberg made 16 saves in regulation and denied Vince Vigvári in the penalty shootout, helping the United States beat Hungary 11-8 on Sunday for the bronze 🥉 medal in men’s water polo. It’s the first medal for the US men since the team lost to Hungary in the final of the 2008 Olympics. The US also won bronze the last time Paris hosted the Summer Games in 1924.\n\nUS settles for silver in women’s volleyball: Italy beat the defending champion US team Sunday to win gold. The victory came in straight sets, 25-18, 25-20, 25-17. The Italians ended a dominant tournament having lost just one set. It’s the first medal in the sport for top-ranked Italy and sends the Americans home in disappointment after they won their first Olympic title in Tokyo.\n\nSifan Hassan traded elbows with Tigst Assefa with 150 meters left in the women’s marathon, then passed her along the railing to win the race for her third distance medal of the Paris Games on Sunday.\n\nHassan, an Ethiopian-born racer who runs for the Netherlands, finished in an Olympic record time of 2 hours, 22 minutes, 55 seconds. Assefa won silver for Ethiopia, three seconds behind, and Kenya’s Hellen Obiri took the bronze.\n\nThe Ethiopian team lodged a protest to have Hassan disqualified for obstruction, but it was rejected by the Jury of Appeal. It looked as if Assefa was blocking Hassan, who was twice impeded before they traded elbows.\n\nHassan raised her hands and yelled as he crossed the line, then wrapped the Dutch flag around her head as she celebrated. Wearing an orange bucket hat, she put her arm around Nepal’s Shantoshi Shrestha, whose smile was as bright as the sun pouring down on them.\n\nThen, taking in the enormity of her win, Hassan plunged her head in her hands and appeared to weep with joy.\n\nThe 31-year-old Hassan also won bronze in the 5,000 and 10,000. By simply completing the marathon, she ran more than 62 kilometers. She now has six Olympic medals. In Tokyo, Hassan won the 5,000 and 10,000 and finished third in the 1,500.\n\nOther medals awarded today: Denmark beat Germany for gold in men’s handball. ...

The French had momentum and hope, but they did not have Stephen Curry.\n\nIn a dazzling and historic shooting display, Curry drained four 3-pointers over the game’s final 2 minutes, 47 seconds, sending the US to a 98-87 win and its fifth consecutive Olympic gold medal.\n\nCurry made 8 of 12 3-pointers in the game and finished with 24 points, following up his 36-point masterpiece in the semifinal escape against Serbia. LeBron James added 14 points and 10 assists. Victor Wembanyama had 26 points to lead France, which certainly made the host country proud with a riveting tournament performance.\n\nJayson Tatum, who did not play in the Americans’ semifinal win over Serbia, had stints off the bench in each half and finished with 2 points on 1 of 3 shooting.

Forward Mallory Swanson scored the only goal, off of a perfectly placed feed from midfielder Korbin Albert in the 57th minute.\n\nThe 26-year-old Swanson, who earned her 100th cap in Saturday’s match, finishes the Olympics as Team USA’s leading goal scorer (4). Read more from Nicole Yang here.\n\nWomen’s 4x400 relay: Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone and Mass. native Gabby Thomas teamed up for America’s 14th gold and 34th overall medal at the track Saturday, wrapping up the Olympic action at the Stade de France with a 4.23-second runaway in the women’s 4x400 relay.\n\nThe gold medalists in the 400 hurdles and 200 meters took care of legs two and three for the United States, handing a 30-meter lead to Connecticut’s Alexis Holmes, who didn’t lose any ground.\n\nMcLaughlin-Levrone, who owns the world’s fourth-fastest time in the 400 to go with her latest world record in hurdles, ran her leg in 47.71. That was .91 seconds faster than the next fastest woman in the field, Femke Bol, who took the Netherlands to silver.\n\nThe US finished in 3 minutes, 15.27 seconds, only .1 short of the world record set by the Soviet Union in 1988.\n\nThe 34 track medals were the most for the US at a non-boycotted Games since the early 20th century, when there were more events and fewer countries. The 14 golds are the most in a non-boycotted Olympics since Bob Beamon, Tommie Smith and John Carlos led the US to 15 wins in 1968.\n\nMen’s 4x400 relay: Rai Benjamin held off Letsile Tebogo on the anchor leg to give the United States a gold medal and an Olympic-record time in the men’s 4x400-meter relay.\n\nBenjamin added this Olympic title to the one he claimed in the 400-meter hurdles a night earlier and prevented 200-meter champion Tebogo from giving Botswana another triumph over the Americans.\n\nIt was Tebogo, the 21-year-old sprinting sensation, who stole the spotlight — and the gold — from the US in the 200 on Thursday, relegating Kenny Bednarek to silver and Noah Lyles, who tested positive for COVID-19, to bronze.\n\nThe US quartet of Christopher Bailey, Vernon Norwood, Bryce Deadmon and Benjamin completed the four laps in 2 minutes, 54.43 seconds, nearly a second faster than the American 4x400 team ran at the 2008 Beijing Olympics. And Saturday’s time was just .14 seconds off the world record set by the United States in 1993.\n\nWomen’s 1,500 meters: Vermont native Elle Purrier St. Pierre got off to a strong start in the women’s 1,500 meters but faded in the back half, finishing eighth in 3:57.52, one spot behind fellow American Nikki Hiltz (3:56.38). Reigning Olympic champion Faith Kipyegon, of Kenya, left no doubt that she would defend her title, stretching her lead to more than a second by the time she reached the finish line in 3:51.29, an Olympic record. Australia’s Jessica Hull (3:52.56) won silver, just barely ahead of Great Britain’s Georgia Bell (3:52.61).\n\nOther track medals on Saturday: Hamish Kerr of New Zealand won gold in the men’s high jump; American Shelby McEwen took silver. Kenya’s Emmanuel Wanyoni won gold in the men’s 800 meters. Japan’s Kitaguchi Haruka took gold in the women’s javelin. American Masai Russell took gold in the women’s 100m hurdles. Grant Fisher of the US snuck on the podium, winning bronze in the men’s 5,000 meters.\n\nEthiopian runner Tamirat Tola won the men’s marathon to end Kenya’s dominance of the race. Tola finished in an Olympic record time of 2 hours, 6 minutes and 26 seconds, with Belgium’s Bashir Abdi finishing 21 seconds behind and Benson Kipruto taking bronze for Kenya, 34 seconds back. The 32-year-old Tola looked back as he neared the line, but he was well clear and had time to soak up the applause. Two weeks ago, he entered the Olympic marathon as a substitute for injured teammate Sisay Lemma.\n\n“I was the reserve in the Ethiopian team, but when Sisay had injuries then I had a chance,” Tola said. “I was fully prepared and knew I could fulfil my dream. I am very proud, very happy.”\n\nEliud Kipchoge, the two-time defending champ, dropped out after 18 miles.\n\n“This is my worst marathon,” said the 39-year-old Kenyan who walked for two kilometers after giving up the chase. “I have never done a DNF. Like a boxer, I have been knocked down, I have won, I have come second, eighth, 10th, fifth. Now I did not finish. That’s life.” Read more from John Powers.\n\nSabrina van der Sloot scored with .7 seconds remaining, and the Netherlands beat the United States 11-10 for the bronze medal in women’s water polo on Saturday.\n\nIt was the second women’s water polo medal for the Netherlands after it won gold at the 2008 Olympics. It also won the European championships in January.\n\nThe U.S. was looking for an unprecedented fourth consecutive gold medal going into the Olympics. Then it blew a 5-2 halftime lead in a 14-13 loss to Australia in a penalty shootout in the semis.\n\nIt struggled to score once again after Jenna Flynn’s power-play goal made it 10-7 with 4:26 left.\n\n“We didn’t handle that very well,” US coach Adam Krikorian said. “Yeah, you know it’s a big moment and it seemed a little bit too big at times, to be honest. ... Sometimes, in these big games, it’s about who’s able to play with the courage and just be able to execute kind of towards the end of the game, and obviously they did a much better job of that.”\n\nThe US had been the only country to medal in each women’s water polo tournament at the Olympics since it started in 2000. Spain beat Australia to win gold.\n\nLess than 40 hours after enduring one of the most gut-wrenching losses in its history, Serbia had found its way back to the the Olympic medal podium. Nikola Jokic produced the fifth triple-double in Olympic history and Serbia beat Germany 93-83 on Saturday to win the men’s basketball bronze medal at the Paris Games.

Lin routed Julia Szeremeta of Poland, 5:0, in the final at Roland Garros, capping her four-fight unbeaten run through Paris by winning Taiwan’s first Olympic boxing gold medal. “I feel incredible,” Lin said after her fourth consecutive 5:0 win. “I want to thank everyone who has supported me, and thanks to my team and everyone in Taiwan. They gave me the power.” Here’s a look at the other boxing medals.\n\nMedal alert! American Brooke Raboutou took silver 🥈 in the women’s sport climbing boulder and lead final.

Here’s a rundown of the taekwondo medals.\n\nThe team of Gabby Thomas, Sha’Carri Richardson, Melissa Jefferson, and Twanisha Terry won gold in the women’s 4x100-meter relay in the pouring rain.\n\nTheir time of 41.78 seconds beat out Great Britain (41.85) and Germany (41.97).\n\nRichardson, the anchor, received the baton with ground to make up and closed it out in the final 100 meters. Terry, who ran the second leg, had the fastest split of the Americans, running the 100-meter distance in 9.98 seconds.\n\nThomas, who hails from Massachusetts, already has one gold medal after winning the 200-meter race, and in the individual 100 meters, Richardson won silver, and Jefferson won bronze.\n\nOn the men’s side, Team USA struggled on the first baton exchange and was disqualified.\n\nThe American team, a medal favorite entering the race, was without 100 meter gold medalist Noah Lyles, who has COVID-19. With the Americans out of contention after 100 meters, Canada won gold in 37.50, followed by South Africa (37.57) and Great Britain (37.61).\n\nWatch the races here.\n\nAmerican sprinter Rai Benjamin convincingly beat world-record-holder Karsten Warholm and Brazil’s Alison dos Santos in the 400-meter hurdles final at the Paris Olympics on Friday.\n\nBenjamin clocked 46.46 seconds to win gold, finishing several strides ahead of Warholm (47.06) and Dos Santos (47.26). Benjamin was able to win despite landing awkwardly coming over the eighth hurdle in a race between the three fastest men in history.\n\nBenjamin won silver behind Warholm when the Norwegian set the world record at the Tokyo Games three years ago.\n\nIn other action, Germany’s Yemisi Ogunleye took gold in the women’s shot put.

The US will play the winner of France vs. Belgium, which tips off Friday at 3 p.m., for a chance at its eighth-straight Olympic gold medal.\n\nBreanna Stewart led the Americans with 16 points, 6 rebounds, and 5 assists, while Jackie Young added 14 points and 5 assists.

Read more here.\n\nWhat else to know about Friday’s action ...\n\nThe Americans are thrilled to be taking home men’s volleyball hardware, outlasting Italy in a wild, back-and-forth battle for bronze on Friday. It went 25-23, 30-28 — a sensational second set in which each country had multiple chances — and 26-24 at a rocking South Paris Arena. The Americans had to regroup in a hurry from the heartbreak of a five-set loss to No. 1 Poland two days earlier. And this was a long time coming after they failed to even advance from group play in Tokyo three years ago. “I’m really proud of them, it’s taken a lot of time. Time builds trust, and there’s a lot of trust in one another to go out there and perform in these moments,” coach John Speraw said. “They went out and they played for their families, they played for each other. I think the amount of time that they’ve spent together over the years is meaningful for all of us.”\n\nThe US men’s water polo team was bounced in the semifinal by Serbia and will play for bronze against Hungary on Sunday. That means both American teams won’t have a chance at gold after the US women lost on Thursday.\n\nBreaking made its debut on Friday, and Japan’s b-girl Ami won gold by spinning, flipping and toprocking past a field of 16 dancers. Ami, legally named Ami Yuasa, won all three rounds in a battle against b-girl Nicka (Dominika Banevič) from Lithuania to clinch the gold, wrapping up a long day of breakers putting hip-hop culture on the Olympic stage with their flow, rhythm and skill at Place de la Concorde stadium. “Breaking is my expression,” Yuasa said. It’s an “expression, an art, but I want to say that breaking also could be part of sports.” But the sport may not return for future Games — it’s already off the list for 2028.\n\nSpain is the first European gold medalist in men’s soccer at the Olympics for the first time in 32 years, when they won at home at Barcelona 1992. The French couldn’t bring in another medal in front of a friendly crowd at Parc de Princes.\n\nMedal alert! US wrestling had a great day: Spencer Richard Lee (silver 🥈), Aaron Marquel Brooks (bronze 🥉), and Helen Louise Maroulis (bronze 🥉) took home some hardware Friday.

Her time of 50.37 was 1.50 seconds ahead of fellow American and silver medalist Anna Cockrell.\n\nMcLaughlin is the first American to win back-to-back gold medals on the track since Michael Johnson in 1996 and 2000.\n\nGrant Holloway and Daniel Roberts made it another hurdling 1-2 for the Americans, taking gold and silver in the men’s 110-meter hurdles later in the afternoon.\n\nIt was a more difficult day for Noah Lyles, who couldn’t complete the sprint double in the 200-meter final, his best event. He was upset by Botswana’s Letsile Tebogo, who became the first African gold medalist in the event and the fifth-fastest man in history over 200 meters.\n\nAfter the race, Lyles, who settled for bronze, revealed that he had tested positive for COVID-19 earlier in the week. Fellow American Kenny Bednarek claimed a second consecutive Olympic silver in the event.\n\nPakistan’s Arshad Nadeem made history in the javelin, setting a new Olympic record with an incredible throw of 92.97 meters (305 feet) and becoming the first Olympic track medalist in Pakistan’s history.\n\nThe US made it eight medals (three gold) on the day with two more in the long jump, where Tara Davis-Woodhall took gold and Jasmine Moore took silver.\n\nFrom Adam Himmelsbach: For the past month the US men’s basketball team has acknowledged the talent gap in international basketball has shrunk. Still, the Americans entered these Paris Olympics as massive favorites and had mostly rolled over their competition entering Thursday’s semifinal against Serbia.\n\nBut once the game began, it became clear this would not be like the others. The Serbians sprayed 3-pointers from all angles and relied on NBA MVP Nikola Jokic to conduct their offense.\n\nSerbia led by as many as 17 points and still held a dangerous 13-point advantage at the start of the fourth. Then the US charged back with the finish that it needed, closing the game with a dominant 32-15 surge to secure a 95-91 win and avoid one of the biggest upsets in international basketball history.\n\nStephen Curry had 36 points to lead the US, and LeBron James had a triple-double with 16 points, 12 rebounds, and 10 assists. Celtics forward Jayson Tatum did not appear in the game.\n\nThe US will play France for gold on Saturday at 3:30 p.m. EDT. Read the rest here.\n\nFrance, aided by old friend and former Celtics first-round pick Guerschon Yabusele, snuck past Germany to play in front of a home crowd at Bercy Arena against the Americans. Read more here.\n\nHere are some other highlights on Thursday:\n\nThe US women’s water polo team was eliminated by Australia in the semifinals, ending its run for a fourth consecutive gold medal. Australia went 6 for 6 in a penalty shootout and goalkeeper Gabi Palm denied Maddie Musselman on the last attempt of the tiebreaker, sending the Aussies into the final. The US blew a 5-2 halftime lead in its second loss of the Paris Games and third loss at the Olympics overall since it dropped the 2008 final against the Netherlands. It went 5-0-1 in London, 6-0 in Rio de Janeiro and 6-1 in Tokyo. Read more here.\n\nUS women’s volleyball advanced past Brazil with a 3-2 win. As Brazil’s fans waved flags, chanted and sang from every corner of South Paris Arena, the US women edged their fellow world powerhouse in a five-set thriller, a compelling rematch of their Tokyo final won in straight sets by the US. That marked the Americans’ first Olympic title, and now they can make it two in a row.\n\nThere was history and pride on the line when Morocco and Egypt faced off in the bronze-medal men’s soccer game, and Morocco emerged victorious with a 6-0 win.\n\nNetherlands outlasted Germany in the men’s field hockey gold-medal game after playing to a 1-1 tie in regulation. The Dutch snuck three of their five shootout attempts past the German goalie to take gold. It’s the Netherlands’ first gold in men’s hockey at the Olympics since 2000 and the third in the country’s history.\n\nGolf: Morgane Metraux of Switzerland had eight 3s on her card on the front nine — an 8-under 28 — until getting slowed by the wind and a bad shot at the wrong time. She still had a 6-under 66, giving her a one-shot lead over Ruoning Yin of China at the halfway point of the women’s golf competition. Play resumes at 3 a.m. on Golf Channel.\n\nMedal alert!

Here’s a look at all the boxing results and all the taekwondo medals.\n\nIt was another huge day at Stade de France for the Americans, who picked up medals in both of the track finals on Wednesday.\n\nFirst it was a thrilling run for gold 🏅 from Quincy Hall in the men’s 400-meter final, the first in the event for the American men since 2008. Hall looked out of it with 100 meters to go before reeling in the field down the home straight, edging Great Britain’s Matthew Hudson-Smith at the line in 43.40, the fifth-fastest time in history.\n\nHall was considered a strong medal contender, but the same couldn’t be sad for Kenneth Rooks in the 3000-meter steeplechase final. Rooks toed the line with the second-slowest personal best in the entire 16-man field but never showed it, making an extremely gutsy move to sprint away from the field down the backstretch of the final lap. With some carnage on the barriers behind him, Rooks kept the pedal down as the field thinned to three, and hung on for an incredible silver medal 🥈 against the best in the world.\n\nIt was a massive nine-second personal best for Rooks, who is just the second American man to medal in the event in the last 40 years.\n\nThe US also picked up a medal in the field, with Katie Moon clearing 4.85 meters (15 feet, 11 inches) to claim silver 🥈 in the women’s pole vault, her second Olympic medal after taking gold in Tokyo.\n\nHere are some other highlights on Wednesday:\n\nTeam USA women’s basketball led by as many as 30 in the third quarter before easing off the gas late in the game to coast to a comfortable 88-74 win over Nigeria. A’ja Wilson was the star for the US, registering a double-double with 20 points and 11 rebounds. Jackie Young put up 15 points, and Breanna Stewart added 13 to lead the Americans in scoring. Promise Amukamara scored 19 to lead Nigeria, but her team’s surprise run in these Games ended in the quarterfinal. See the rest of the women’s basketball scores and the rest of the schedule here.\n\nThe US men’s volleyball team was bounced out of the Olympics by Poland, 3-2. The gold-medal drought continues for the Americans, who haven’t won the Olympic tournament since 2008. But the US men’s water polo team stayed alive with its victory over Australia on Wednesday.\n\nThe US women’s cycling pursuit team of road race Olympic champion and Harvard grad Kristen Faulkner, Chloe Dygert, Jennifer Valente, and Lilly Williams held on through a ragged finish to beat New Zealand in the race for gold. The Americans led by more than a second a quarter of the way through the 4,000-meter race and stretched the lead at one point to nearly two seconds. But they began to come apart from their single-file, aerodynamic draft with about two laps to go, and they had to hang on to the finish to give their nation its first gold in the event after 12 years of close calls. Read more here.\n\nAndy Macdonald, who is from Melrose but, at 51, competed in the skateboarding park final on Wednesday for Great Britain. He didn’t reach the medal competition, but it didn’t change his experience in Paris: “The audience has been second to none,” Macdonald said, according to ESPN. “There are very few things that bring the world together. Sport is one of them at the Olympics. It’s incredible. Walking around the village seeing athletes from all over the world coming together for sport is a beautiful thing.” Read more from Emma Healy.\n\nMiles Partain and Andy Benesh could not stop the slide and the United States is leaving beach volleyball at the Olympics without a medal. Their 21-14, 21-16 defeat to Qatar’s Cherif Younousse and Ahmed Tijan on Wednesday made it the first American medal shutout since the sport joined the Summer Games in Atlanta in 1996.\n\nMedal alert! American Hampton Morris won bronze 🥉 in the men’s 61kg weightlifting competition. And Team USA’s Tom Schaar won silver 🥈 in the men’s skateboarding park final.\n\nIn weightlifting, American Sarah Hildebrandt took gold 🏅 in the freestyle 50kg final.\n\nAnd the US artistic swimming team, which includes North Andover’s Ruby Remati, won silver in the competition in Paris. China dominated in the absence of Russia, which had won every gold medal in artistic beginning with the 2000 Sydney Games. China finished with 996.1389 points, ahead of the Americans’ 914.3421 and Spain’s 900.7319. It was the first US medal in the sport since 2004.\n\nOther medals awarded Wednesday: Spain’s wiggliest mixed marathon race walk relay team took gold in that event. ...

Here are Wednesday’s taekwondo winners.\n\nWhat a day on the track.\n\nThe Americans cleaned up on Tuesday, winning gold and bronze in both of the day’s biggest track finals.\n\nMassachusetts’ Gabby Thomas delivered in the women’s 200 meters, running a brilliant bend and sprinting away from the field to become an Olympic champion 🏅 for the first time. Fellow American Brittany Brown came through for bronze, her first Olympic medal. 🥉\n\nIf Thomas’s gold medal was an expected coronation, Cole Hocker’s was a stunning revelation. In a men’s 1,500-meter final that was expected to be a showdown between defending Olympic champion Jakob Ingebrigtsen and reigning world champion Josh Kerr, the 23-year-old Hocker shocked them both with a lethal kick down the stretch to win an unlikely Olympic gold 🏅 and set an Olympic record in the process.\n\nHocker had to check his stride with 100 meters to go with Ingebrigtsen blocking his path, but the Indiana native and former Oregon star recovered and re-accelerated to run down both Ingebrigtsen and Kerr and become just the second American in over a century to win gold in the men’s 1500 meters.\n\nFellow American Yared Nuguse also earned his first Olympic medal with an impressive bronze. 🥉 It’s the first time two Americans have been on the podium in the event since 1912.\n\nElsewhere on the track, Annette Nneka Echikunwoke took silver 🥈 in the women’s hammer throw.\n\nOther track results: Greece’s Militadis Tentoglou won gold in the men’s long jump and Bahrain’s Winifred Yavi took gold in the women’s 3000m steeplechase.\n\nSophia Smith’s extra-time goal earned the United States a spot in the gold medal match at the Paris Olympics with a 1-0 semifinal victory over Germany on Tuesday.\n\nThe Americans, undefeated in France under new coach Emma Hayes, will be vying for their fifth gold medal in their sixth appearance in the Olympic women’s soccer final.\n\nThe United States will play Brazil, which defeated Spain, 4-2, in the late match, in the tournament final on Saturday in Paris. Read more here.\n\nFrom Adam Himmelsbach: The US men’s basketball team’s minor struggles in its five-game exhibition slate appear to be a distant memory now, and it seems increasingly unlikely that any opponent will be able to stop one of the most talented squads ever assembled.\n\nOn Tuesday night, the Americans rolled to a 122-87 win over Brazil in an Olympic quarterfinal at Bercy Arena. They will face Serbia in the semifinals on Thursday night. The US crushed Serbia, 110-84, when these teams met in a group play-game in Lille last week.\n\nOn Tuesday, Devin Booker led the US with 18 points, Anthony Edwards at 17, Joel Embiid had 14 points and 7 rebounds, and LeBron James added 11 points and 9 assists.

They screamed and waved Algerian flags. They took out their phones to capture the moment.\n\nThe 25-year-old Khelif didn’t hide her excitement, either. After defeating Thailand’s Janjaem Suwannapheng to advance to the gold-medal match of the women’s welterweight (66-kilogram) bracket, a grinning Khelif danced a celebratory jig and hugged her coaches.

The US won silver 🥈 in the mixed team triathlon relay, which was held despite concerns over water quality in the Seine once again. The plan to hold the swimming portion of the triathlons and the marathon swimming events in the Seine was an ambitious one — swimming in the river has, with some exceptions, been off-limits since 1923 because it has been too toxic. In a very close sprint finish, the team from Germany won the gold medal and Great Britain took bronze. And in shooting the US mixed skeet team took silver 🥈 in the gold-medal match.\n\nMedals awarded Monday: China’s Li Yuehong took gold in the shooting 25m rapid fire men’s final. ...

Jon Rahm of Spain had a four-shot lead over Tommy Fleetwood when he stepped on the 11th tee. Fleetwood caught him in two holes as the Spaniard had a stunning collapse.\n\nThat opened the door for six players — including Victor Perez of France, who came within one shot of the podium.\n\nThe bronze went to Hideki Matsuyama, in the mix on the back nine until closing with six straight pars for a 65.\n\nScheffler becomes the second straight American to win gold in men’s golf, following Xander Schauffele in the Tokyo Games.\n\nSchauffele was tied for the 54-hole lead with Rahm until he had a collapse of his own.

But in adding a sixth career medal to her collection Sunday afternoon with a bronze 🥉 on the uneven parallel bars, Lee more than earned this day in the solo spotlight, writes Tara Sullivan.\n\nAlgeria’s Kaylia Nemour took gold. Nemour was born and still trains in France but switched to compete for Algeria following a dispute with the French gymnastics federation and Nemour’s club of Avoine Beaumont, which has led the gymnast to embrace her father’s Algerian nationality. Her victory was the first gymnastics gold for an African nation.\n\nOf all of Novak Djokovic’s achievements, of all of the championships and Grand Slams and trophies, the best feeling of his career actually transpired nowhere near a tennis court.\n\nIn 2012, he carried the Serbian flag during the London Olympics Opening Ceremony.

But on Sunday, the 37-year-old checked one last box by securing a 7-6 (3), 7-6 (2) win over Spanish sensation Carlos Alcaraz to claim his first Olympic gold.\n\n“This kind of supersedes everything that I imagined, everything that I hoped I could experience and feel,” Djokovic said. “Representing my country has always been my greatest priority for me . . . When I take everything into consideration this is probably the biggest sporting success I’ve ever had.” Read more from Adam Himmelsbach.\n\nDouble world records!\n\nThe US contingent, on the cusp of finishing No. 2 on the medal count for the first time since 1988, ensured Team USA’s dominance continued by blowing the competition out of the water on the final day of swimming in Paris.\n\nFirst it was Bobby Finke, setting a world record 🏅 in the 1,500-meter freestyle. Finke was under world-record pace the entire race and really turned it on coming to the finish. He touched in 14 minutes, 30.67 seconds to break the record of 14.31.02 set by China’s Sun Yang at the 2012 London Games.\n\nThen it was the women’s 4x100 medley relay team — Lilly King, Torri Huske, Regan Smith, and Gretchen Walsh — who edged out rival Australia on the final race of the Games. 🏅\n\n“Just an awesome way to cap off the meet,” said King, who will retire.\n\nChina stunningly won the gold in the men’s 4x100 medley relay, ending the American run of dominance that stretched back to the introduction of the event at the 1960 Rome Games. The only time the US didn’t win gold was in 1980, when it boycotted Moscow. The US took silver 🥈 in the event.\n\nThe US finished with eight gold medals to edge out Australia, which won seven events. Still, it was the lowest victory total for the Americans since the 1988 Seoul Games, when they were beaten by a doping-tainted East German program. They finished with 28 medals overall, two shy of their total three years ago in Tokyo.
