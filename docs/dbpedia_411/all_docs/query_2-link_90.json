        "text": "The Olympic Games are always a special time. The pomp, the circumstance, the competition, the heartbreak — it’s what sports fans tune in for every four years. Between Simone Biles’ historic gold medal moments and Team USA’s hoop dreams, to Snoop Dogg and Flavor Flav’s infectious fandom, this year’s Paris Games have been exciting to watch.\n\nDespite all of the stars, one of the preeminent events of the Games is track and field. This year, sprinter Sha’Carri Richardson is making her Olympic debut, Noah Lyles is attempting to win his first gold medal on the world’s biggest stage, and Jamaican track star Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce is looking to cap off her career with another win.\n\nWhile we wait to see how the competition plays out, we wanted to take a look back at one of the Olympic Games’ most fashionable sports. From Florence Griffith Joyner’s iconic fits and Michael Johnson’s golden track cleats, to Ato Boldon’s goggles and Gail Devers’ signature nails, track athletes have been showcasing their style on and off the field for decades.\n\nBritni Danielle is the Senior Culture Editor for Andscape. A die-hard Lakers fan, she can't wait for the day they win one more championship than the Boston Celtics.\n\nJessi Dodge is a photo editor at ESPN."
