In total, the U.S. has currently qualified six out of a possible eight quota spots in the individual events, in addition to qualifying a team for three of the four synchronized events. The athletes filling those quota spots were determined at U.S. Olympic Diving Trials, which took place June 16-23 in Knoxville, Tennessee. Carson Tyler, 20, will be the first U.S. man to compete in both individual events at the Olympics since 2000. Brandon Loschiavo was a late addition to the roster, earning an Olympic spot on the day of the Opening Ceremony.\n\nMen's 3m Springboard\n\nAndrew Capobianco\n\nCarson Tyler\n\nMen's 10m Platform\n\nCarson Tyler\n\nBrandon Loschiavo\n\nWomen's 3m Springboard\n\nSarah Bacon\n\nAlison Gibson\n\nWomen's 10m Platform\n\nDelaney Schnell\n\nDaryn Wright\n\nMen's Synchronized 3m Springboard\n\nTyler Downs\n\nGreg Duncan\n\nWomen's Synchronized 3m Springboard\n\nSarah Bacon\n\nKassidy Cook\n\nWomen's Synchronized 10m Platform\n\nJessica Parratto\n\nDelaney Schnell\n\nEquestrian\n\nThe U.S. successfully qualified for all three team events (dressage, jumping, eventing), and as a result, will also have three entries in each of the individual competitions. The eventing and dressage rosters were announced in June, with the jumping team named in July. On the day of the Opening Ceremony, it was announced that Liz Halliday will replace Will Coleman on the eventing team. A surprise late-minute substitution also saw Karl Cook replace Kent Farrington on the jumping team.\n\nDressage\n\nAdrienne Lyle (riding Helix)\n\nMarcus Orlob (riding Jane)\n\nSteffen Peters (riding Suppenkasper)\n\nEventing\n\nLiz Halliday (riding Nutcracker)\n\nBoyd Martin (riding Fedarman B)\n\nCaroline Pamukcu (riding HSH Blake)\n\nJumping\n\nKarl Cook (riding Caracole de la Roque)\n\nLaura Kraut (riding Baloutinue)\n\nMcClain Ward (riding Ilex)\n\nFencing\n\nThe U.S. qualified for five of the six team events, only missing out on men's epee.

That means that five men and five women were named to the U.S. Olympic gymnastics team. As part of the selection process, Olympic Trials were held June 27-30 in Minneapolis. Only the top-ranked athlete in the all-round competitions for both men and women earned an automatic spot on the Olympic team, however; the rest of the women's team was decided by discretionary selection, and mathematical scoring data was used to select the men's team.\n\nMen\n\nAsher Hong\n\nPaul Juda\n\nBrody Malone\n\nStephen Nedoroscik\n\nFrederick Richard\n\nWomen\n\nSimone Biles\n\nJade Carey\n\nJordan Chiles\n\nSuni Lee\n\nHezly Rivera\n\nHandball\n\nThe U.S. did not qualify a men's or women's handball team for Paris 2024.

However, the majority of qualification quotas became mathematically locked in after the conclusion of the world championships in May.

Countries will be limited to no more than four players in men's and women's singles. It's not uncommon for some players who qualify to end up skipping the Olympics, and that ended up being the case for several U.S. players.
