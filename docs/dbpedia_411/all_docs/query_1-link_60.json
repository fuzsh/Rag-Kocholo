        "text": "Reigning champions Canada were eliminated from the Olympic women’s football on Saturday, going down 4-2 on penalties to Germany after their quarter-final ended 0-0.\n\nThe Canadians had made it through the group stage despite being docked six points following a drone spying scandal.\n\nKatie Ledecky capped another stellar Olympics by becoming only the second swimmer to win an event at four straight Summer Games, holding off Ariarne Titmus to win the 800-meter freestyle Saturday night.\n\nIt was Ledecky’s second gold medal in Paris and ninth of her remarkable career, which marked another milestone. She became only the sixth Olympian to reach that figure, joining swimmer Mark Spitz, track star Carl Lewis, Soviet gymnast Larisa Latynina and Finnish runner Paavo Nurmi in a tie for second place.\n\nThe only athlete to win more golds: swimmer Michael Phelps with 23.\n\n-AP\n\nThe Vatican said Saturday it was “saddened by certain scenes” at the Olympics opening ceremony that gave “offence” to Christians, as controversy rages over a segment some say lampooned Jesus’ Last Supper.\n\nThe July 26 show included a scene featuring dancers and drag queens that some said was reminiscent of depictions of the Last Supper, the final meal Jesus Christ is said to have shared with his apostles.\n\nAlthough organisers have said they intended to portray a pagan feast led by the Greek god of wine, Dionysus, that explanation has not dulled the criticism.\n\n“The Holy See was saddened by certain scenes at the opening ceremony of the Paris Olympic Games and can only join the voices that have been raised in recent days to deplore the offence given to many Christians and believers of other religions,” said the Vatican in a statement written in French.\n\n“In a prestigious event where the whole world comes together around common values there should not be allusions ridiculing the religious beliefs of many people,” it said, adding that “freedom of expression... finds its limit in respect for others.”\n\n-AFP\n\nCanada’s Summer McIntosh won the women’s 200 metres individual medley on Saturday in an Olympic record time for her third swimming gold of the Paris Games and fourth medal overall.\n\nKate Douglass of the United States won the silver and Australian Kaylee McKeown the bronze after U.S. swimmer Alex Walsh was disqualified.\n\nThe gold completed a medley double for the 17-year-old McIntosh, who won the 400 IM last Monday. She also won the 200 butterfly on Thursday and took silver in the 400 freestyle on the opening Saturday.\n\n-Reuters\n\nDebutant Nishant Dev (71kg) bowed out of the Olympic Games following a heartbreaking defeat to Mexico’s Marco Verde Alvarez in the men’s 71kg quarterfinal here on Saturday.\n\nThe 23-year-old world championship bronze medallist Indian lost by a 1-4 split verdict to his second seed Mexican opponent in the quarterfinal at the North Paris Arena.\n\nNishant is the fifth Indian boxer to exit the Olympic Games.\n\nA former University of Central Florida rower with epilepsy who won Lithuania’s first medal at the Paris Olympics on Saturday hopes her achievement will help motivate others with the disorder.\n\nViktorija Senkute, who attended the Florida college from 2015-18, won the bronze medal in the women’s singles class. It was also the first medal for any Baltic country at the 2024 Paris Games.\n\n“This is insane, I still feel like I’m dreaming,” Senkute said.\n\n“It’s a very big day for Lithuania, for all Baltic countries and for UCF. Everybody from UCF was watching and cheering, everybody from Lithuania. This unites so many countries, so many people.” Senkute said she wants to use her Olympic success to help show that people with epilepsy can live their lives normally and compete at a high level.\n\n“It means nothing to me. It’s not a limitation at all,” she said.\n\n-AP\n\nThe only things that slowed Remco Evenepoel on his way to Olympic history were a flat tire and the finish line.\n\nThe Belgian cyclist has become the first rider to sweep the road race and time trial at the Summer Games, relentlessly attacking over three climbs of Montmartre and building such a lead on the run-in to the finish at the Pont d’Iéna that Evenepoel was able to swap out bikes in the final kilometers and still begin his celebration early.\n\nHe raised his arms in triumph as he crossed the bridge over the River Seine on Saturday, stopping a foot or two past the finish line to soak in the cheers, the Eiffel Tower providing one last picturesque backdrop to the road race at the Paris Games.\n\n“Too much drama,” Evenepoel said with a smile. “Being almost sure with four kilometers to go and then having a flat doesn’t help the stress and the excitement of the moment. But it’s a dream come true once again.”\n\n-AP\n\nTrinity Rodman scored a stunning goal in extra time as four-time gold medallists the United States edged Japan 1-0 on August 3 to reach the last four of the Olympic women’s football.\n\nThe daughter of former NBA superstar Dennis Rodman struck in stoppage time at the end of the first half of extra time to finally break the deadlock, and Japan’s resistance, at a packed Parc des Princes in Paris.\n\nIt takes the USA through to a semifinal on Tuesday in Lyon, where they will face either reigning Olympic champions Canada or 2016 gold medallists Germany.\n\nThe USA remain on track under new English coach Emma Hayes to win a record-extending fifth women’s football gold, and a first since defeating Japan in the London Olympic final in 2012.\n\nThat silver remains Japan’s only medal in the competition and they go home after thwarting the USA for most of a tense quarter-final, where they failed to take what few chances came their way on the break.\n\nZheng Qinwen became the first Chinese player to win an Olympic Games tennis singles gold when she defeated Croatia’s Donna Vekic in the final on August 3 in straight sets.\n\nThe 21-year-old Zheng came through 6-2, 6-3 for China’s second tennis gold after Li Ting and Sun Tiantian’s women’s doubles triumph at Athens in 2004.\n\nThe Algerian boxer embroiled in a major gender controversy guaranteed herself at least bronze at the Paris Olympics after winning her quarterfinal on August 3 on unanimous points.\n\nImane Khelif, who has found herself in the eye of a global storm along with another boxer from Taiwan, comfortably beat Hungary’s Anna Luca Hamori to reach the semi-finals of the women’s 66kg category.\n\nCape Verde boxer David De Pina clinched his island nation’s first Olympic medal with a quarterfinal victory on Friday at Paris Games. Cape Verde had never taken home a medal in its previous seven appearances in the Games. But De Pina has won twice in the men’s 51kg division to secure at least a bronze for his country.\n\nFrench swimming superstar Leon Marchand won his fourth gold medal of the Paris Games with an emphatic victory in the men’s 200m individual medley on Friday. Marchand won in 1min 54.06sec, the second-fastest time in history and an Olympic record, with Britain’s Duncan Scott taking silver and China’s Wang Shun third\n\nIndia has shifted gears at the right time. A robust challenge to defending champion Belgium and a historic win over Olympic silver medallist Australia in its last two pool matches has set up the Craig Fulton-coached side nicely to take on another tough rival, Great Britain, in the quarterfinals of the hockey competitions in the Olympics at the Yves du Manoir Stadium in Paris on August 4.\n\nIndia had lost to Great Britain in their last two meetings in the FIH Pro League in London in June. But the Harmanpreet Singh-led outfit has lifted its game steadily in the Olympics and is likely to throw a different challenge against the same rival at a different venue.\n\nIndia has shown coordination among its defence, midfield and forwardline.\n\nParis Olympics: Men’s hockey team peaking at right time, faces Great Britain in quarterfinals\n\nSimone Biles soared to women’s vault gold on August 3, her gravity-defying Yurchenko double pike propelling her to a third triumph of the Paris Games and her seventh career Olympic crown.\n\nBiles, who led the United States to team gold before grabbing all-around gold, produced a pair of stunning vaults to notch a resounding victory over Olympic and world champion Rebeca Andrade of Brazil. American Jade Carey took bronze.\n\nAfter 10 Olympic Games and 36 years, Nino Salukvadze says she’s finally done.\n\nThe pistol shooter from Georgia has been ever-present at the Summer Olympics since Seoul 1988, when she competed for what was still the Soviet Union. At the 2024 Olympics, she became the first female athlete ever to compete at the Games 10 times.\n\nSalukvadze considered retiring after her first Olympics 36 years ago, after she’d won gold and silver medals as a 19-year-old. She nearly walked away in the 1990s, when she struggled to support her family financially in newly independent Georgia. She announced her retirement after the Tokyo Games.\n\nThis time, though, she says she is done “for sure.”\n\nComing to the Paris Olympics was about honouring her father Vakhtang, who was also her coach. After the Tokyo Olympics, he talked her out of retirement for one last push.\n\n“He was my mentor not only in sports, but also in life. He was a wise man,” she said.\n\nSalukvadze’s father died earlier this year at the age of 93, but lived to see his daughter qualify for a Paris Olympic spot for Georgia.\n\nFrom her 10 Olympics, Salukvadze has three medals: one gold, one silver and one bronze. At the 2024 Olympics, she placed 38th in the 10-metre air pistol event and 40th in the 25-metre pistol.\n\nSalukvadze’s last Olympic medal — and her first for an independent Georgia — was in Beijing in 2008. At the time, Georgia was at war with Russia. Salukvadze won bronze and embraced Russian silver medallist Natalia Paderina on the podium.\n\nSalukvadze may not be totally done with the Olympics yet. She’s a coach at her own shooting club in Georgia, and is a vice-president of the national Olympic committee.\n\nEven after 36 years, nothing quite matches the feeling of winning an Olympic gold medal as a teenager back in 1988.\n\n“When I won at the Olympics and stood on the podium, it was indescribable. Even now, I can evoke these feelings in myself in the same way, feel it just the same.”\n\nNovak Djokovic insists Carlos Alcaraz will be the “favourite” for Olympic gold on Augut 4 in the latest instalment of tennis’s generational power grab.\n\nAt 37, Djokovic would be the oldest Olympic tennis singles champion since the sport returned to the Games at Seoul in 1988.\n\nAt 21, Alcaraz would be the youngest of all time.\n\nA win for the Serb would be his first gold medal at the fifth attempt and represent a significant upgrade on the bronze he won at Beijing in 2008.\n\nVictory would also allow Djokovic to become only the fifth player to complete the Golden Slam of all four majors plus an Olympic title.\n\nOnly Andre Agassi, Rafael Nadal, Serena Williams and Steffi Graf can make similar boasts.\n\nParis Olympics: Djokovic and Alcaraz eye power and glory in Olympic gold medal duel\n\nCarlos Yulo won the second Olympic gold medal ever for the Philippines, edging defending champion Artem Dolgopyat of Israel in the men’s floor exercise finals at the Paris Games on August 3.\n\nThe 24-year-old Yulo scored 15.000, just ahead of Dolgopyat, the defending champion at 14.966. Jake Jarman of Britain claimed the bronze with a 14.933.\n\nYulo stuck his triple-twisting dismount during his final tumbling pass. He stuck his arms out and roared inside a packed Bercy Arena before walking off the podium.\n\nYulo joins weightlifter Hidilyn Diaz as Olympic gold medalists from the Philippines. Diaz earned gold in the women’s 55-kilogram division in Tokyo three years ago.\n\nThe event finals continue later on August 3 with the women’s vault final, where American star Simone Biles will look to become the second woman in Olympic history to win vault twice. A medal by Biles would give her 10 in her Olympic career, tied for the third most ever. Biles could add to that total if she finishes in the top three on balance beam and floor exercise on Monday.\n\nThe men’s pommel horse final is also later on August 3. American Stephen Nedoroscik and Rhys McClenaghan of Ireland tied for the top score in qualifying.\n\nHimself an Olympic medallist, Indian contingent Chef de Mission Gagan Narang on August 3 hailed the shooting team’s three bronze-winning campaign in the Paris Games as the best show in the country’s Olympics history.\n\nThe sensational Manu Bhaker became the first Indian after the country’s independence to win two medals — both bronze — in a single edition of the Games. She first won a bronze in women’s 10m air pistol, and then paired up with Sarabjot Singh to clinch another medal of the same colour in the 10m air pistol mixed team event.\n\nOn Saturday, she narrowly missed another bronze, finishing fourth in the women’s 25m sports pistol event.\n\nSwapnil Kusale was the third shooter to win another bronze -- in the 50m Rifle 3 Positions event.\n\nSouth Korea’s Lim Sihyeon won gold in the women’s individual archery event at the Paris Olympics on August 3, taking home her third title during the Games.\n\nLim’s compatriot Nam Suhyeon took silver, ensuring their country dominated the podium. But France’s Lisa Barbelin fought off South Korea’s Jeon Hunyoung for the bronze, winning France’s first medal in the event to a wild roar from the crowd.\n\nWeather conditions at Esplanade des Invalides varied throughout the afternoon, as overcast skies alternated with bright sun and the archers dealt with both wind and still air, likely forcing them to constantly adjust their aim.\n\nIn the gold medal competition, Lim and Nam were well-matched and each had one set with a perfect score. The two archers helped South Korea win their 10th consecutive gold medal in the women’s team event earlier during the Games.\n\nBut Lim, who also won gold in the mixed team event, overtook her teammate 7-3 to win the individual medal.\n\nSpectators backing France and South Korea rivalled each other for support on Saturday, waving flags and banners and stomping their feet during the bronze medal competition.\n\nSpain’s Carolina Marin moved into the Olympic badminton semifinals on August 3 and said it had been a long journey back since missing the Tokyo Games with a serious knee injury.\n\nMarin, the 2016 women’s singles champion, beat Japan’s Aya Ohori 21-13, 21-14 at La Chapelle Arena to set up a final-four showdown with China’s He Bingjiao.\n\nCarolinaMarin.jpg\n\nMarin was hot favourite for the title at the Tokyo Olympics three years ago until she suffered a cruciate ligament knee tear just months before the tournament.\n\nThat kept her out for a year and came just two years after she ruptured the ligament in her other knee — an injury that sidelined her for eight months of 2019.\n\nMarin said it “means a lot” to be back in medal contention on the Olympic stage.\n\n“Three years ago, I couldn’t think that I would reach a semi-final here in Paris,” she said.\n\n“The journey has been a long way but I am here and I feel really proud of myself.”\n\nSouth Korea’s world number one An Se-young also progressed with a 15-21, 21-17, 21-8 win over Japan’s two-time world champion Akane Yamaguchi.\n\nAn’s semifinal opponent will be Indonesia’s Gregoria Mariska Tunjung, who beat Thailand’s Ratchanok Intanon 25-23, 21-9.\n\nMarin beat eighth seed Ohori in 52 minutes and looked in control of their match from the off.\n\nKorea’s Lim Sihyeon won the gold medal at the women’s archery individual event and the silver went to her compatriot Suhyeon Nam in one of the intriguing final match.\n\nItaly’s Marta Maggetti grabbed Olympic gold in the women’s windsurfing final on August 3, staging a comeback in the final stages of the high-speed race with a smart strategic split.\n\nMaggetti, 28, pumped her fist as she crossed the line and then leapt off her board into the Mediterranean in celebration.\n\nThe Italian’s break away from her rivals in the third leg of four proved decisive, giving her the lead from Britain’s Emma Wilson, who had dominated the early stages of the race, during which their iQFOiLs flew over the sea at more than 20 knots.\n\nIsrael’s Sharon Kantor, 21, who had been in second place for most of the chase between the three ‘foiling’ windsurfers around the bay off Marseille, secured silver.\n\nWilson, 25, who had dominated the fleet during the qualifying stages, crossed the line some way behind her rivals. The Briton, who also won bronze in Tokyo, looked distraught.\n\nMaggetti swam over to her rivals to hug them in the water as the result of the race began to register. She was greeted back on the beach with an Italian flag and ran over to embrace friends and family waiting for her.\n\nThere were emotional hugs ashore too for Wilson, whose tears were interspersed with occasional smiles.\n\nFrance’s Lisa Barbelin clinched the bronze in the women’s archery event. She defeated Korea’s Jeon Hunyoung in the bronze medal match\n\nMatt Ebden and John Peers won Australia’s second tennis gold medal in Olympic history on August 3, beating Austin Krajicek and Rajeev Ram of the United States 6-7 (6), 7-6 (1), 10-8 in a match tiebreaker in the 2024 Games men’s doubles final.\n\nOlympics doubles uses a first-to-10, win-by-two tiebreaker in place of a traditional third set.\n\nEbden and Peers trailed by a set and 4-2 in the second before breaking Ram’s serve to begin the comeback. Their tennis gold follows the one won for Australia by Todd Woodbridge and Mark Woodforde in men’s doubles at Atlanta in 1996.\n\nEbden drew attention at the start of these Olympics when he was a fill-in in singles and lost to Novak Djokovic 6-0, 6-1 after moving into that bracket when other players withdrew. Djokovic said he doesn’t think someone like Ebden — a 36-year-old doubles specialist who hadn’t competed in a tour-level, main-draw singles match since June 2022 — should have been on the court without a teammate at the Summer Games.\n\nWhen Saturday’s match ended, the children of Peers and Ebden climbed out of the stands to hug their fathers. Ebden draped a replica gold medal around the neck of his son, whom he then tossed in the air and caught.\n\nThe 40-year-old Ram, who is based in Indiana, was trying to become the oldest player to win an Olympics tennis gold — for men or women, in singles or doubles — since the sport returned to the Summer Games in 1988.\n\nHe and Krajicek, a 34-year-old who lives in Florida, also were trying to become the third U.S. duo to win a men’s doubles gold. The most recent had been twins Bob and Mike Bryan at London in 2012. The brothers were in the stands Saturday — Bob is the country’s men’s tennis coach in Paris, and Mike has been serving as a hitting partner and helping coach doubles.\n\nInstead, Ram and Krajicek — who eliminated Rafael Nadal and Carlos Alcaraz in the quarterfinals — will head home with silvers.\n\nIt is indeed another heart-breaking day for India as Deepika Kumari lost to Korea’s Som in the quarterfinals of the women’s singles archery.\n\nDeepika Kumari loses in individual archery quarterfinals; India’s archery campaign over at Paris Games\n\nOne set to go, Deepika Kumari and Korea’s Som are engaged in an intense contest at the women’s singles archery event at the Paris Olympics\n\nAfter losing the second set point, Deepika Kumari held her nerve and won the third set. It is indeed an intriguing contest for a quarterfinal\n\nIndia’s Deepika Kumari wins the first two set points to go ahead in the women’s singles archery event at the Paris Olympics\n\nFormer World Champion and four-time Olympian Deepika Kumari will be seen in action in the quarterfinals in a few minutes. India’s Deepika Kumari will be up again Korea’s Suhyeon Nam\n\nOlympic chief Thomas Bach said on August 3 boxing should be in the next Games in Los Angeles despite a furore over the gender of two women boxers in Paris — but urged the sport to get its house in order fast.\n\nAlgerianImane Khelif’s bout with an Italian opponent that only lasted 46 seconds and Taiwanese fighter Lin Yu-ting’s progress in Paris have sparked a row because both were disqualified from last year’s world championships after failing eligibility tests. Khelif fights again on August 3.\n\nThe issue has been complicated by boxing’s governance structure — the IOC seized control of the management of the programme from the International Boxing Association because of concerns about the way the body operated the sport.\n\nIOC chief Thomas Bach says boxing should be in LA Olympics, with conditions\n\nSouth Korea’s Yang Ji-in won the gold in the women’s 25 metres pistol event at the Paris Olympics after a shoot-off with France’s Camille Jedrzejewski on August 3.\n\nYang and Jedrzejewski were tied on 37 points at the top forcing the shoot-off in which the Korean prevailed 4-1 in her Olympic debut at the Chateauroux Shooting Centre.\n\n“This gold medal has proved I am the world’s best right now,” said the bespectacled Yang. “I will have to train harder to try to put the flag highest once again in LA (in 2028).”\n\nLocal favourite Jedrzejewski said she struggled to control her emotions in the final shots.\n\n“I lost maybe because my emotions were running very high, but I’m happy with my silver,” she said. “There was a lot of emotion in the hall, and it was a really intense competition.”\n\nHungary’s Veronika Major won the bronze also via a shoot-off, denying India’s Manu Bhaker a third Paris Games medal.\n\n“I was very happy to go to the final in the first place,” Major said. “This is the greatest moment of my career so far.”\n\nNoah Lyles finished second in his opening heat of the Olympic 100 meters on August 3 but still advanced and kept alive his hopes for the sprint double.\n\nThe American got off to a sluggish start and finished in 10.04 seconds, which was .06 behind Louie Hinchliffe, a British sprinter being trained by Carl Lewis.\n\nThe second-place finish means Lyles, the reigning world champion at 100 and 200 meters, won’t have the premier lane choice when he races in the semifinals Sunday. If he advances from that, he’ll race for the gold medal later in the evening.\n\n“It is difficult,” he said. “I downplayed my competitors for sure. I was like ‘there’s no reason to really put any emphasis on it.’ But these guys proved to me that they’re ready to compete. I said ‘alright, I can’t do that anymore.’ I promise that will not happen again.”\n\nAlso advancing in the early heats were Kishane Thompson of Jamaica, who jogged the last 20 meters and won his heat in 10 seconds flat; Ferdinand Omanyala of Kenya, who won his in 10.08; and Oblique Seville of Jamaica, who won his heat in 9.99.\n\nSeville has a victory over Lyles at a race in Jamaica earlier this year.\n\nIndia’s double-medal winner at Paris Olympics Manu Bhaker on August 3 said there was no pressure on her for a third podium finish here after she narrowly missed out on a bronze in the women’s 25m pistol competition.\n\nBhaker finished fourth and signed off from the ongoing Olympics as the first-ever Indian to have won two medals in a single edition of the Games after Independence.\n\nBhaker, who shot 28 in the shoot-off, said the experience will only add to her skills along with a “lot of motivation”.\n\n“Did I? No, I don’t think I did because as soon as the last matches were over, my coach was like, ‘You know what? history is history. Now live in the present and then later on you can sit down and think about how everything went’,” Bhaker said at the mixed zone.\n\nManu Bhaker: There was no pressure on winning third medal, will try to overcome this in next cycle\n\nMen’s pole vault, discus throw, 100m heats are being held at the Paris Olympics 2024.\n\nMathias Boe, the coach of Chirag Shetty and Satwiksairaj Rankireddy, on August 3 announced his retirement from coaching following the ace Indian badminton pair’s exit from the ongoing Paris Olympics.\n\nSatwik and Chirag lost to Malaysia’s Aaron Chia and Soh Wooi Yik in the men’s doubles quarterfinals 21-13, 14-21, 16-21 on August 1.\n\nMathiasBoe.jpg\n\nBoe, a silver medal winner in the London Olympics, had joined Chirag and Satwik as their coach ahead of the Tokyo Olympics.\n\n“For me, my coaching days ends here, I’m not going to continue in India or anywhere else, for now at least. I have spent too much time in a badminton hall and it’s also pretty stressful to be a coach, I’m a tired old man,” the 44-year-old from Denmark wrote on his Instagram account.\n\nSatwik and Chirag were hot favourites to go the distance in the men’s doubles section at Paris, and Boe consoled them.\n\n“I know the feeling all too well myself. Pushing yourself to the limit every day, to be in the best shape of your life, and then things doesn’t go as you would have hoped for.\n\n“I know you guys are gutted, I know how much you wanted to bring a medal back to India, but this time it wasn’t meant to be,” Boe said.\n\nBoe, however, said he is leaving the position as a satisfied man despite his wards failing to return from Paris with a medal.\n\n“You have everything to be proud of, how hard you have worked in this Olympics camp, battling injuries, even taken injections to reduce the pain, that is dedication, that is passion and that is a lot of Heart,” he wrote.\n\nIndian archer Deepika Kumari won 6-4 against her German opponent in the Round of 16 match today. Deepika will compete against the second seed Nam Suhyeon of South Korea in the quarterfinal at 5.09 pm IST.\n\nInternational Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach said on August 3 that the “hate speech” directed at boxers Imane Khelif and Lin Yu-Ting at the Paris Olympics is “totally unacceptable.” “We will not take part in a politically motivated … cultural war”.\n\nKhelif of Algeria and Lin of Taiwan have been subjected to days of global scrutiny about their gender. Both women were disqualified at the 2023 world championships.\n\n“We have two boxers who are born as women, who have been raised as women, who have a passport as a woman and have competed for many years as women,” Mr. Bach said. “Some want to own a definition of who is a women.”\n\n- PTI\n\n“I got really nervous about it, but again, I was trying my best to keep calm and to just try to do my best.
