        "text": "Olympic Games\n\nThe Olympic Games: A sports phenomenon unlike any other!\n\nThe Olympic Games have become one of the biggest sporting events of our time. Athletes from the entire world take part. Their achievements are watched from both near and far by hundreds of millions of spectators.\n\nWhat makes the Olympic Games different from any other sports events is the fact that they are held every four years. They are the largest sporting celebration in terms of the number of sports on the programme, the number of athletes present and the number of people from different nations gathered together at the same time in the same place.\n\nThe Olympic Games include the Games of the Olympiad (i.e. the Summer Games) and the Olympic Winter Games.\n\nThe word Olympiad designates the four-year period that separates each edition of the Summer Games. The Summer and Winter Games originally took place in the same year, but since 1992, the Winter Games have been held two years from the Summer Games. The Summer Games and the Winter Games continue to be organized once every four years.\n\nIn the Summer Games, athletes compete in a wide variety of competitions in a total of 28 sports. The Winter Games, on the other hand, feature seven sports practiced on snow and ice, both indoors and outdoors.\n\nHistory:\n\nIt was Pierre de Coubertin of France who dreamt up this ambitious project, although others before him had tried to revive these Games during the 19th century, without having Coubertin’s success. Drawing inspiration from the ancient Olympic Games, he decided to create the modern Olympic Games. With this purpose, he founded the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in 1894 in Paris. The new committee set itself the objective of organising the firstÂ Olympic Games of modern times. The date of the first Games, 1896, marked the beginning of an extraordinary adventure that has now lasted for over a century!\n\n(Resource: The Modern Olympic Games, publication of the Olympic Museum, 2nd edition 2007)\n\nFor more information about the Olympic Games, visit the official IOC Website.\n\nEgypt at the Olympic Games\n\nMedals by Summer Games\n\nMedals by Winter Games\n\nList of medalists\n\nEl Sayed Nosseir\n\nBirth Date: 31 August 1905 in Tanta\n\nDied: 11 October 1968\n\nAchievements: Nosseir was a weightlifter who won the Gold medal in the heavyweight class at the 1928 Summer Olympics in Amsterdam. 22 years old Nosseir lifted 355 kg to book a new world record winning Egypt's first Olympic gold medal ever.
