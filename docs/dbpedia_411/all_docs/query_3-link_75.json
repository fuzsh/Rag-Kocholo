        "text": "A roadmap to follow for the archery competition during the 2024 Summer Olympic Games in Paris.\n\nAthletes to watch\n\nMarcus D’Almeida, Brazil: Ranked No. 1 in the world, D’Almeida was the World Archery Federation Archer of the Year in 2023. He earned the bronze medal at the world championships last year and claimed the South American title in March.\n\nMete Gazoz, Turkey: He is trying to repeat as an individual Olympic gold medalist. Gazoz recently won the European championship after claiming the world championship in 2023.\n\nKim Je-deok, South Korea: He won gold as part of the men’s team competition and the first-ever mixed team competition in Tokyo at just 17 years old.\n\nCasey Kaufhold, United States: The 20-year-old is ranked No. 1 in the world. She qualified for Tokyo and competed at age 17. She was a silver medalist at the 2021 world championships.\n\nLim Si-hyeon, South Korea: The 20-year-old is ranked No. 2 in the world and has emerged as South Korea’s top female archer.\n\nKim Woo-jin, South Korea: The veteran won gold in Tokyo as part of the men’s team competition.
