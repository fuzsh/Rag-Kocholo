Two athletes shoot against one another, and the loser leaves the competition while the winner advances to the next round. Archers have 20 seconds to shoot each arrow, shooting in turns of one arrow each. Athletes win two points if they have the highest score in the set, and each athlete is awarded one point if the set is a draw. The first athlete to six points wins the match. During the gold medal final, two athletes remain. They shoot a match, and the winner is awarded the gold medal while the loser will receive a silver medal. The two semifinal losers compete for the bronze. 11 Team Competition Each team is made up of three athletes of the same gender from the same country. The combined ranking round score of the three athletes is used to rank the teams from one to 12, giving the seeding for the elimination brackets. These brackets progress like the individual competition. Team matches are also decided using the set system, but with six arrows instead of three. Arrows are shot in groups of three, alternating between each group. Every athlete in a group must shoot an arrow, but they can fire in any order. After the first team completes its group, the second team shoots. Finally, both teams repeat the process for a second group. The team with the highest score receives two set points. If tied, each team receives a point. Like in the individual competition, the first team to six set points wins the match. The match consists of four ends of two arrows each for each archer. This means a total of 24 arrows are shot. The team has two minutes to shoot all six arrows. In the event of a tie, each team is allowed one minute for each team member to shoot an arrow. The team with the highest total score is the winner.\n\nEquipments -Bowstring Tbapemaaiatmwnrrrheoqarccpderwuooyhhfoiwopeebatmsrmrsrronsmayyo.ndwienbsaewnastlHneeaetrpictdorncqoohetwdrutrowio,ottiepuaaismmcvomrtt.acrepiauooeloarticnw,nnmpimhbttiepoe.aoaizcefnrrweceetaImtthesnhattoecehhnorreiieeiedssnfr, -Bow -Arrows -Gloves -Finger Tabs -Quivers -Chest guard -Nock - Sight -Specialist archery insurance from Gunplan.\n\nGlossary of Terms Bow The bow and arrow is a ranged weapon system consisting of an elastic launching device and long-shafted projectiles.
