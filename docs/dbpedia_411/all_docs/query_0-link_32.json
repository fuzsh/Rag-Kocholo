        "text": "The 2024 Olympics are here.\n\nThe Olympics are being held in Paris for the third time ever and first time in a full century. Instead of the usual four-year wait between Summer Olympics, the Paris Games are commencing just three years after the Tokyo Games, which were pushed back from 2020 to 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe 2024 Olympics will feature events at Paris landmarks, competitions between the world’s greatest athletes and around-the-clock coverage on NBC and Peacock.\n\nAs the clock counts down to the Opening Ceremony, here is a full guide to get you prepared for the 2024 Paris Olympics.\n\nHow to watch the 2024 Olympics in Paris\n\nThe 2024 Paris Olympics will go from July 26 to Aug. 11, 2024.\n\nThe Games will officially kick off with the Opening Ceremony on July 26, but several events begin before that. Handball, rugby and soccer matches were scheduled for July 24 and 25, and archery will also get going on July 25. Here's how to watch.\n\nNBC and Peacock will present live Olympic events each morning and afternoon. Coverage will include the finals in highly anticipated events in track and field, swimming, gymnastics and more.\n\nNBC will air at least nine hours of daytime coverage each day during the games. It will also deliver an enhanced, three-hour primetime show each night with behind-the-scenes access, new technology and insight from marquee athletes.\n\nPeacock will stream every sport and event live throughout the Games, a first for the streaming service when it comes to the Summer Olympics.\n\nUSA Network, Golf Channel, CNBC, E!, Telemundo and Universo will also air event coverage throughout the Olympics.\n\nWhat is the time difference between Paris and the U.S.?\n\nWith Paris six hours ahead of Eastern Standard Time, American fans can expect the competition to begin around 3 a.m. ET and end around 6 p.m. ET each day.\n\nTeam USA medal count\n\nTeam USA may be red, white and blue, but at the Olympics, it takes home plenty of gold, silver and bronze.\n\nThe U.S. has won 2,629 Summer Olympics medals in its history: 1,061 gold, 830 silver and 738 bronze. It owns more gold medals than any other country has total medals.\n\nTeam USA has led the medal count at each Summer Olympics dating back to the 1996 Atlanta Games. Its dominance continued in Tokyo, as it led the pack in golds (39), silvers (41), bronzes (33) and total medals (113).\n\nAmerican athletes medaled in 25 sports and won gold in 14 of them. Swimming was Team USA’s top sport, as it won 30 medals in the pool. Athletics (26), wrestling (9), gymnastics (6) and shooting (6) were next on the list.\n\nThe U.S. women have been especially dominant. They won 58% of the country’s medals in Tokyo, marking the third straight Olympics in which U.S. women won more than half of Team USA’s medals.\n\nTeam USA Olympians in 2024 Olympics\n\nTeam USA is once again bringing a loaded group of nearly 600 athletes to the Olympics that includes gold medalists, up-and-comers and sporting icons.\n\nBeginning in the pool, swimmer Caeleb Dressel won five gold medals — three individual and two relays — giving him the most medals of any U.S. competitor at the Tokyo Games. Katie Ledecky wasn’t far behind, earning two swimming golds, an individual silver and a relay silver. Ryan Murphy, Lilly King and Regan Smith each won three swimming medals and eight more swimmers won two medals in Tokyo.\n\nIn 2024, Dressel will compete in his third Olympics and Ledecky will continue to swim for history. Katie Grimes and Nic Fink are chasing their first Olympic medals, while Gretchen Walsh could make a splash as an Olympic newcomer.\n\nSimone Biles entered the Tokyo Olympics as a four-time defending gold medalist for her performance at the 2016 Rio Games. Her time in Tokyo took a dramatic turn as she experienced the “twisties.” She later made a triumphant return and wound up earning two medals (one silver and one bronze).\n\nSuni Lee stepped up for Team USA gymnastics in Tokyo en route to individual all-around gold. Her three medals (one gold, one silver and one bronze) were the most of any non-swimmer on Team USA.\n\nSeveral Americans ran onto the scene on the track. Sydney McLaughlin took home two gold medals, Rai Benjamin got a gold and a silver, Fred Kerley landed silver in the men’s 100m, Kenny Bednarek got silver in the men’s 200m and Noah Lyles got his first taste of Olympic glory with bronze in the 200m. Lyles, Kerley and Bednarek will be among those competing for the title of “the world’s fastest man” in Paris.\n\nThe stars will also be out for Team USA on the court. The men’s basketball team has earned four straight Olympic golds, and it is getting a legendary boost in Paris. LeBron James, Steph Curry, Kevin Durant and more future Hall of Famers are teaming up this summer. The women’s basketball team, meanwhile, is chasing its eighth straight gold at the Olympics with WNBA champions A’ja Wilson and Breanna Stewart leading the way.\n\n2024 Olympics sports\n\nThe 2024 Paris Olympics will feature 329 medal events across 32 sports.\n\nThe Games will include one brand new sport: breaking. It is an urban dance style originated in New York City and was added for the Paris Olympics in December 2020.\n\nAdditionally, skateboarding, sport climbing and surfing are back after debuting at the Tokyo Olympics.\n\nHere is a breakdown of each sport’s competition schedule, medal events and rules:\n\nAquatics\n\nCompetition schedule: July 27-Aug. 11\n\nMedal events: 49 (35 swimming, 8 diving, 2 artistic swimming, 2 marathon swimming, 2 water polo)\n\nSwimming rules, diving rules, artistic swimming rules, marathon swimming rules, water polo rules\n\nArchery\n\nCompetition schedule: July 25-Aug. 4\n\nMedal events: 5\n\nArchery rules\n\nAthletics\n\nCompetition schedule: Aug. 1-Aug. 11\n\nMedal events: 48\n\nTrack and field rules\n\nBadminton\n\nCompetition schedule: July 27-Aug. 5\n\nMedal events: 5\n\nBadminton rules\n\nBasketball\n\nCompetition schedule: July 27-Aug. 11\n\nMedal events: 4\n\nBasketball rules, Basketball 3x3 rules\n\nBoxing\n\nCompetition schedule: July 27-Aug. 4, Aug. 6-10\n\nMedal events: 13\n\nBoxing rules\n\nBreaking\n\nCompetition schedule: Aug. 9-10\n\nMedal events: 2\n\nBreaking rules\n\nCanoeing\n\nCompetition schedule: July 27-Aug. 1, Aug. 3-10\n\nMedal events: 16 (10 sprint, 6 slalom)\n\nCanoeing rules\n\nCycling\n\nCompetition schedule: July 27-Aug. 11\n\nMedal events: 22 (12 track, 4 road, 2 BMX freestyle, 2 BMX racing, 2 mountain biking)\n\nTrack cycling rules, road cycling rules, BMX freestyle rules, BMX racing rules, mountain biking rules\n\nEquestrian\n\nCompetition schedule: July 27-Aug. 6\n\nMedal events: 6 (2 dressage, 2 eventing, 2 jumping)\n\nEquestrian rules\n\nFencing\n\nCompetition schedule: July 27-Aug. 4\n\nMedal events: 12\n\nFencing rules\n\nField hockey\n\nCompetition schedule: July 27-Aug. 9\n\nMedal events: 2\n\nField hockey rules\n\nGolf\n\nCompetition schedule: Aug. 1-4, Aug.7-10\n\nMedal events: 2\n\nGolf rules\n\nGymnastics\n\nCompetition schedule: July 27-Aug. 5, Aug. 8-10\n\nMedal events: 18 (14 artistic gymnastics, 2 rhythmic gymnastics, 2 trampoline)\n\nArtistic gymnastics rules, rhythmic gymnastics rules, trampoline rules\n\nHandball\n\nCompetition schedule: July 24-25, July 27-Aug. 4, Aug. 6-11\n\nMedal events: 2\n\nHandball rules\n\nJudo\n\nCompetition schedule: July 27-Aug. 3\n\nMedal events: 15\n\nJudo rules\n\nModern pentathlon\n\nCompetition schedule: Aug. 8-11\n\nMedal events: 2\n\nModern pentathlon rules\n\nRowing\n\nCompetition schedule: July 27-Aug. 3\n\nMedal events: 14\n\nRowing rules\n\nRugby\n\nCompetition schedule: July 24-25, July 27-30\n\nMedal events: 2\n\nRugby rules\n\nSailing\n\nCompetition schedule: July 28-Aug. 8\n\nMedal events: 10\n\nSailing rules\n\nShooting\n\nCompetition schedule: July 27-Aug. 5\n\nMedal events: 15\n\nShooting rules\n\nSkateboarding\n\nCompetition schedule: July 27-28, Aug. 6-7\n\nMedal events: 4\n\nSkateboarding rules\n\nSoccer\n\nCompetition schedule: July 24-25, July 27-28, July 30-31, Aug. 2-3, Aug. 5-6, Aug. 8-10\n\nMedal events: 2\n\nSoccer rules\n\nSport climbing\n\nCompetition schedule: Aug. 5-10\n\nMedal events: 4\n\nSport climbing rules\n\nSurfing\n\nCompetition schedule: July 27-30\n\nMedal events: 2\n\nSurfing rules\n\nTable tennis\n\nCompetition schedule: July 27-Aug. 10\n\nMedal events: 5\n\nTable tennis rules\n\nTaekwondo\n\nCompetition schedule: Aug. 7-10\n\nMedal events: 8\n\nTaekwondo rules\n\nTennis\n\nCompetition schedule: July 27-Aug. 4\n\nMedal events: 5\n\nTennis rules\n\nTriathlon\n\nCompetition schedule: July 30-31, Aug. 5\n\nMedal events: 3\n\nTriathlon rules\n\nVolleyball\n\nCompetition schedule: July 27-Aug. 11\n\nMedal events: 4 (2 volleyball, 2 beach volleyball)\n\nVolleyball rules, beach volleyball rules\n\nWeightlifting\n\nCompetition schedule: Aug. 7-11\n\nMedal events: 10\n\nWeightlifting rules\n\nWrestling"
