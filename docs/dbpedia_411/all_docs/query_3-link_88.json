        "text": "Seoul 1988 Olympic Games, athletic festival held in Seoul that took place September 17–October 2, 1988. The Seoul Games were the 21st occurrence of the modern Olympic Games.\n\nAfter boycotts had marred the previous two Olympiads, political problems threatened to return to center stage at the 1988 Games. Violent student riots took place in Seoul in the months leading up to the Games. North Korea, still technically at war with South Korea, complained bitterly that it should have cohost status. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) made some concessions to North Korea, but North Korea did not find them satisfactory and boycotted; several other countries, notably Cuba and Ethiopia, stayed away from Seoul in solidarity with North Korea. The boycott did not have the effect of previous ones, and the Seoul Games proved to be extremely competitive.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nThe Olympics Quiz\n\nNearly 8,500 athletes from 159 countries participated. The Olympic rule requiring participants to be amateurs had been overturned in 1986, and decisions on professional participation were left to the governing bodies of particular sports. This resulted in the return of tennis, which had been dropped in 1924, to the Games. Table tennis and team archery events were also added.\n\nCanadian Ben Johnson, champion of the 100-meter run, and several weightlifters tested positive for steroid use and were disqualified. In all, 10 athletes were banned from the Games for using performance-enhancing drugs. In the track events the Kenyan men’s team won four of the six distance races. Soviet pole-vaulter Sergey Bubka won his first gold medal. The women’s competition featured Americans Florence Griffith Joyner, winner of three gold medals, and Jackie Joyner-Kersee, who earned gold medals in the heptathlon and the long jump. Weightlifter Naim Suleymanoglu of Turkey won the first of his two career gold medals in the featherweight division. Soviet Greco-Roman wrestler Aleksandr Kareline, competing in the super heavyweight division, also won his first gold medal."
