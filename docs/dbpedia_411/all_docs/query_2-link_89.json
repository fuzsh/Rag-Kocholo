        "text": "Although introduced in the 1896 Olympic Games, gymnastics competitions were standardized years later in the 1928 Olympics. Women also began competing in the sport during the 1928 Olympics.\n\nEvents in men’s gymnastics include floor exercise, pommel horse, rings, vault, parallel bars, horizontal bar, and combined (individual and team). Women’s artistic events include floor exercise, vault, uneven bars, balance beam, and combined (individual and team).\n\nRhythmic gymnastics became an Olympic sport practiced only by women in 1984. Events in women’s gymnastics include rope, hoop, ball, clubs, and ribbon, with awards based on team, group, all-around, and individual competitions.\n\nTrampoline gymnastics was first introduced at the 2000 Olympic Games as both a men’s and women’s individual event.\n\nShannon Miller is one of the most decorated gymnasts in the United States, with seven Olympic medals. She competed on the 1996 Olympic Women’s Gymnastics Team, also called the “Magnificent Seven,” who came together in competition to win the team gold medal in the Olympics that year. She was later inducted into the U.S. Olympic Hall of Fame in 2006 for individual achievements and in 2008 for her team achievements.\n\nAs you enter the Hall of Fame, be amazed and inspired by the portraits and biographies of legendary gymnasts like Shannon Miller. You can also look at what she considers the most personal piece of her memorabilia – her famous scrunchies.\n\nLook at other United States Olympic gymnasts and explore the stats of some of the top gymnastics competitors, like Mary Lou Retton, Nadia Comaneci, Simone Biles, Kerri Strug, Bart Conner, and many more.\n\nEmbark on a journey through the incredible history of gymnastics by visiting the Hall of Fame in the U.S. Olympic & Paralympic Museum. Plan your visit to the USOPM today!"
