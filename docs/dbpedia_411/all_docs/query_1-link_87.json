        "text": "Japan takes dramatic gold over China in men's team gymnastics final, USA takes bronze\n\nIncredible drama in the men’s team gymnastics final.\n\nJapan has snatched gold on the final rotation having outscored China on the horizontal bar, finishing on 259.594 points overall to China’s 259.062. The US takes bronze with 257.793, the team’s first medal in this event for 16 years.\n\nChina was in pole position to claim gold heading into that final rotation but some costly mistakes dented the team’s chances, with a visibly upset Su Weide scoring just 11.600 after falling twice.\n\nChina’s final athlete, Zhang Boheng, needed to score 15.266 for his country to win gold, and he has a history of doing so after scoring more than that in qualification.\n\nBut after a solid routine, a slight step on the dismount seemed to cost Zhang and he was scored 14.733, relegating China to silver.\n\nThere’s plenty of Japanese fans inside the Bercy Arena, and they’re making a huge amount of noise with that result.\n\nMen's gymnastics team final in full swing at the Bercy Arena\n\nThere’s a packed house at Paris’ Bercy Arena for the men’s gymnastics team final, which is approaching its conclusion.\n\nChina currently leads ahead of Japan and the USA, which has lots of support inside the arena. Chants of “USA! USA!” ring out as Fred Richard completes his floor routine, scoring 14.466.\n\nWill there be a change in the current podium standings with the final rotation? We’ll find out soon enough.\n\nHere's what to watch next at the Olympic Games\n\nMonday continues to be a jam-packed day at the 2024 Olympics.\n\nIt’ll be a big day for swimming with five gold medals up for grabs. Meanwhile, Team USA is feeling the pressure to keep up their streak of being number one in women’s basketball.\n\nHere’s what to watch:\n\nSwimming: Swimmers from all over the world will be vying for gold medals at five events beginning at 8:30 p.m. local time (2:30 p.m. ET). Women’s 400m Individual Medley, Men’s 200m Freestyle, Men’s 100m Backstroke, Women’s 100m Breaststroke and Women’s 200m Freestyle.\n\nWomen’s basketball: USA women’s basketball team is under great expectations to maintain their impressive streak. With seven Olympic gold medals in a row, a 55-game Olympic winning streak and a roster full of incredible talent — all the pressure will be on one of sporting history’s greatest-ever entities to continue its run. US women’s basketball plays at 9 p.m. local time (3 p.m. ET).\n\nOlympics commentator dropped over sexist comments about women’s swim team\n\nOlympics commentator Bob Ballard was dropped from Eurosport, the European pay TV company, on Monday after the veteran sportscaster made sexist comments about the Australian women’s swim team.\n\nFollowing the conclusion of Sunday’s 4x100 meter freestyle relay, during which the Australian team won the gold medal, Ballard commented on the team’s apparent delay in exiting the Paris Aquatic Centre as they celebrated.\n\n“Well, the women just finishing off. You know what women are like, hanging around, doing their makeup,” Ballard said.\n\nLizzie Simmonds, the former Olympian and Ballard’s Eurosport co-host, immediately rebuffed his comments.\n\n“Outrageous, Bob,” Simmons said, as Ballard laughed. “Some of the men are doing that as well.”\n\nA spokesperson for Eurosport, which distributes the Olympic broadcast in Europe and shares the same parent company as CNN, confirmed Ballard had been dropped over his comments.\n\nBallard, a veteran commentator who has reported on sports since the mid-’80s, has covered several Olympic games. He also works as a music and news presenter for BBC Local Radio.\n\nIn a statement posted Monday on social media, Ballard offered an apology for his remarks.\n\n“The comments I made during the Australian freestyle relay victory ceremony on Saturday have caused some offense. It was never my intention to upset or belittle anyone and, if I did, I apologize. I am a massive advocate of women’s sport,” he wrote.\n\nJapan's Yuto Horigome defends men's street skateboarding title\n\nJapan’s Yuto Horigome defended his Olympic title in the men’s street skateboarding in dramatic fashion Monday at the 2024 Paris Games.\n\nSitting in seventh place in the eight-man competition before his final trick, the 25-year-old registered the best score of the event with 97.08 points. He would finish with a total score of 281.14.\n\nUSA’s Jagger Eaton and Nyjah Huston earned silver and bronze, respectively. Eaton finished with 281.04 points. Huston had 279.38.\n\nThis event made its Olympic debut at the 2020 Tokyo Games.\n\nChrista Deguchi wins Canada’s first gold of the Paris Games and first ever Olympic judo gold medal\n\nChrista Deguchi won Canada’s first ever Olympic judo gold medal in a thrilling women’s 57kg final Monday with South Korea’s Huh Mimi.\n\nThere was nothing between Deguchi and Huh during regulation time which meant it went to a golden score – an additional period to try and find a winner.\n\nAnd in the extra period, Huh was given her third shido – a warning – for a false attack. Three shidos are equivalent to an automatic ippon, awarding the gold medal to Deguchi, with the Canadian appearing almost disbelieving at the ending.\n\nThe gold medal is Canada’s first gold of the Paris Games.\n\nBronzes were won by Japan’s Funakubo Haruka and France’s Sarah Léonie Cysique.\n\nFrance’s Nicolas Gestin wins gold in men’s canoe slalom\n\nFrance’s Nicolas Gestin won gold in the men’s canoe slalom Monday, finishing over five seconds ahead of Adam Burgess of Team GB in second.\n\nAfter Burgess had laid down an emphatic marker with a time of 96.84 seconds, the pressure was on Gestin to beat the time at the Vaires-sur-Marne Nautical Stadium who was going with the last attempt of the day having finished first in qualifying.\n\nAnd the 24-year-old didn’t disappoint the home fans, producing a remarkably quick run down the course to finish with a time of 91.36 seconds and claim gold.\n\nBurgess won silver while Slovakia’s Matej Beňuš won bronze.\n\nRafael Nadal says he's at peace if Monday's loss to Novak Djokovic was his last\n\nNovak Djokovic defeated Rafael Nadal in a memorable match in the second round of the Olympics.\n\nHe finished the match with an exclamation mark ace. The 24-time grand slam singles champion won the final two games of the second set after Nadal had won four straight, sending the Roland Garros crowd into raptures.\n\nFollowing the match, Nadal said, “I cannot complain. I have been playing on this (court) for 20 years, fighting for the most important things. I have achieved much more than what I could have dreamed. If that was the last match here, or when(ever) the last match will be, I am going to accept (it) in peace.”\n\nNadal is still competing with Carlos Alcaraz in the men’s doubles draw.\n\nCanada Soccer appeals FIFA's Olympic six-point deduction\n\nThe Canadian Olympic Committee (COC) and Canada Soccer are appealing FIFA’s six-point Olympics sanction imposed to the national women’s soccer team with the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) amid the drone-spying scandal at the 2024 Paris Games.\n\nOn Saturday, football’s world governing body FIFA deducted six points from the team in group play and suspended coaches for one year.\n\n“The appeal is based on the disproportionality of the sanction, which we believe unfairly punishes the athletes for actions they had no part in and goes far beyond restoring fairness to the match against New Zealand,” COC said in a statement.\n\nA hearing is expected to take place Tuesday, according to Monday’s CAS press release, with a decision to be issued Wednesday.\n\nCNN has reached out to FIFA for comment.\n\nThe COC formally apologized Wednesday after the New Zealand Olympic Committee lodged a complaint that its women’s soccer team practice was recorded by a drone in Saint-Étienne.\n\nCanada, the defending Olympic champion, has won its first two matches of the Games – a 2-1 victory against New Zealand on Thursday and a 2-1 win over France on Sunday.\n\nWith the points deduction, Canada currently sits tied for third with New Zealand, behind Colombia and France in Group A.\n\nCanada plays Colombia at Nice Stadium on Wednesday, still with a chance to advance to the knockout stage.\n\nSouth Korea men's squad wins third team archery Olympic gold medal in a row\n\nThe South Korean dominance over the sport of archery continued on Monday as the nation’s men won the team competition event in Paris.\n\nSouth Korea thoroughly beat host France 5-1 in the final to claim its third Olympic gold medal in a row and seventh in 10 total Summer Games.\n\nThe team – comprised of Kim Je-deok, Kim Woo-jin and Lee Woo-seok – was dominant en route to the final, easing past Japan in the quarterfinals and China in the semifinals.\n\nAnd in the final, the archers showed no sign of nerves, romping to the gold medal with extremely accurate shooting, missing out on the top score of 10 with just four of their 18 arrows.\n\nThey wrapped up the top spot with scores of 57-57, 59-58 and 59-56, not needing a decisive fourth set such was their margin of victory.\n\nThe men’s victory came a day after their women counterparts won their 10th consecutive gold medal in the team event – tied for the longest active gold medal streak at the Olympic Games.\n\nTeam GB silver medalist Tom Daley doesn't rule out a 2028 Summer Games return\n\nOn Monday, famed British diver Tom Daley said he was thrilled to win silver alongside partner Noah Williams in the men’s synchronized 10-meter platform.\n\nThat marked the fourth medal of Daley’s long Olympic career, dating all the way back to the Beijing Games in 2008 when he competed as a fresh-faced 14-year-old.\n\nDaley didn’t rule out competing in Los Angeles for the 2028 Games.\n\n“I live in LA now, so there are chances to do a second home Olympic Games. But right now, I just want to enjoy this moment, and we’ll see how it goes after that.”\n\nDjokovic dominates in an epic tennis match and China picks up more gold. Catch up on the latest\n\nTop tennis stars dominated the early competitions at Monday’s Olympic Games in Paris with Serbia’s Novak Djokovic advancing to the third round and Team USA’s Coco Gauff making easy work of her opponent.\n\nIf you’re just catching up, here’s what happened at the Games so far, today:\n\nDjokovic defeated Rafael Nadal in a tense showdown in the second round of the Olympics, putting the Spaniard away in straight sets 6-1, 6-4. He finished the match with an exclamation mark ace. The 24-time grand slam singles champion won the final two games of the second set after Nadal had won four straight, sending the Roland Garros crowd into raptures. But the top-seeded Serb would not be denied in his quest for a first gold medal and the completion of the career golden slam. Afterward, Nadal wasn’t in the mood to discuss whether this was his last match at Roland Garros.\n\nCoco Gauff advanced to the third round of the women’s singles tournament after a straight sets victory over María Lourdes Carlé. The No. 2 seed raced into a 5-0 lead in the first set on Court Suzanne-Lenglen, eventually winning 6-1. And clinched the next round berth with a 6-1 win in the second set. Gauff has already shown she is formidable on Paris’ clay courts this year, having won the women’s doubles title at the French Open in June. Iga Świątek of Poland, the top-ranked player in the world, is also through to the third round.\n\nMore gold for China: Not long after Chinese divers Lian Junjie and Yang Hao picked up gold in the men’s synchronized diving, 19-year-old Sheng Lihao took the top podium spot in the men’s 10-meter air rifle final. It’s the teenager’s second gold medal of these Games after he was also crowned Olympic champion in the 10-meter air rifle mixed team event alongside Huang Yuting. It was a dominant performance from China’s Lian Junjie and Yang Hao in the men’s synchronized 10m platform final. The duo, which have previously won three world championship titles, was making its Olympic debut in Paris and recorded the highest score in every round to win the gold medal. Check here for the latest medal count.\n\nBoost for US gymnastics: USA Gymnastics announced that Simone Biles will compete in all four events – vault, uneven bars, balance beam and floor exercise – in Tuesday’s women’s team final. “Grateful to be doing what I love,” Simone Biles said Monday in an Instagram post, a day after fighting through a calf injury flareup during women’s gymnastics qualification.\n\nTelecom sabotage: France said authorities have identified several people who carried out Friday’s attacks on its high-speed railway system.

In an interview with CNN, Katerine said his song “Nue” – or “Naked” – was a message for peace, inspired by war, such as those in Gaza and Ukraine.\n\nOlympic organizers have already apologized for the scene after it was criticized by the Catholic Church and Christian groups.\n\nYou can read more here.\n\nThree-time Olympic gold medalist Adam Peaty tests positive for Covid\n\nThree-time Olympic gold medalist Adam Peaty has tested positive for Covid, Team GB said in a statement on Monday.\n\nThe 29-year-old began to feel unwell before his men’s 100m breaststroke final on Sunday, according to the statement, with his symptoms worsening in the hours before the race. He went onto finish 0.02 seconds behind race-winner Nicolo Martinenghi of Italy to win silver.\n\n“He is hopeful to be back in competition for the relay events later in the swimming programme,” the statement continued. “As in any case of illness, the situation is being managed appropriately, with all usual precautions being taken to keep the wider delegation healthy.”\n\nSunday’s silver medal takes Peaty’s tally of Olympic medals to six: three golds and three silvers.\n\n\"Grateful to be doing what I love,\" Simone Biles says, a day after fighting through a calf injury flareup\n\n“Grateful to be doing what I love,” Simone Biles said Monday in an Instagram post, a day after fighting through a calf injury flareup during women’s gymnastics qualification.\n\nDespite the apparent discomfort Sunday, she still ended up on the top of the leaderboard, with Biles in first place in the all-around rankings and with Team USA in first place in team standings.\n\nAfter her performance on the balance beam, Biles landed awkwardly while warming up for her floor routine and exited the arena before reemerging to get her lower left leg heavily taped.\n\nCecile Landi, her coach, told reporters after the competition that Biles had been dealing with calf pain a couple weeks before Paris that flared up again during Sunday’s competition.\n\nThe men’s team final takes place Monday, while the women’s team final is Tuesday.\n\nMichael Jung wins eventing individual gold for Germany\n\nMichael Jung won gold for Germany in the eventing individual final, becoming the first rider in history to win the Olympic title three times.\n\nThe 41-year-old finished with a score of 21.80, just ahead of Australia’s Christopher Burton on 22.40 in silver medal position.\n\nTeam GB’s Laura Collett picked up the bronze medal just hours after winning team gold.\n\nHang it in the Louvre – quite literally\n\nParis is known for its historical artifacts and world-renowned art.\n\nOne group of fans today showed their appreciation for the French capital’s traditions in a unique fashion.\n\nThe quartet dressed in images of Leonardo da Vinci’s Mona Lisa, which hangs in the city’s Louvre museum, with holes cut out to show their faces as they watched Germany’s men’s handball match against Japan.\n\nWith the four looking on, Germany was victorious 37-26 in their Group A encounter.\n\nTeam USA to finally receive figure skating gold medals from Beijing 2022 on August 7 in Paris\n\nTeam USA’s figure skating team will finally receive the gold medals it earned from the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics on August 7 in a special reallocation event in Paris following the Kamila Valieva doping case fallout.\n\nOn Monday, International Olympic Committee spokesman Mark Adams announced the delayed ceremony will occur at the Paris Games’ Champions Park, where 2024 Summer Olympics’ medal winners receive their hardware.\n\nInitially, Valieva and the other members of the Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) squad were awarded first in the team figure skating event. However, the results were removed when Valieva was disqualified after being found guilty of an anti-doping rule violation.\n\nThe reallocation also means the team from Japan will be awarded silver.\n\nIt is unclear who will receive bronze. Earlier this year, Canada filed an appeal with the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) seeking to move up to bronze position. CAS said last week it is still considering Canada’s appeal. As of now, the ROC sits in third after the reallocation.\n\nAdams also said that another allocation ceremony will take place in Paris on August 9.

South Africa’s Alan Hatherly finished in third to claim bronze.\n\nPidcock – who turns 25 on Tuesday – becomes just the second man to win two Olympic mountain bike gold medals after France’s Julien Absalon.\n\nAfter the race, Pidcock described his race as “suffering, suffering.”\n\n“I enjoy the races where I put the work in and it’s kind of easier – Tokyo was better in that respect because I was in control.\n\n“Here, I was not in control, I was fighting to come back. I made two mistakes, I punctured and fell off the course in the same place, so it was a battle out there.”\n\nHere are the official race times:\n\nPidcock: 1:26:22\n\nKoretzky: 1:26:31\n\nAlan Hatherly of South Africa: 1:26:33\n\nThis post was updated with remarks by Great Britain’s Tom Pidcock.\n\nNovak Djokovic puts an end to Rafael Nadal's comeback and moves on to the third round\n\nNovak Djokovic defeated Rafael Nadal in an epic showdown in the second round of the Olympics, putting the Spaniard away in straight sets 6-1, 6-4.\n\nHe finished the match with an exclamation mark ace.\n\nThe 24-time grand slam singles champion won the final two games of the second set after Nadal had won four straight, sending the Roland Garros crowd into raptures.

Świątek has looked strong, keeping her French opponent – the 59th ranked player in the world – off balance with a series of powerful serves and deft volleys.\n\nParry seemed to come into the match during the last two games of the first set, leading to loud cheers from the crowd.\n\nTeenager Sheng Lihao wins gold for China in the men's 10-meter air rifle\n\nIt’s turning out to be a brilliant start to the week for Chinese athletes at the Olympic Games.\n\nNot long after Chinese divers Lian Junjie and Yang Hao picked up gold in the men’s synchronized diving, 19-year-old Sheng Lihao took the top podium spot in the men’s 10-meter air rifle final.\n\nIt’s the teenager’s second gold medal of these Games after he was also crowned Olympic champion in the 10-meter air rifle mixed team event alongside Huang Yuting.\n\nSheng is already putting together a formidable Olympic record at such a young age, adding the two golds to a silver medal he won in the 10-meter air rifle as a 16-year-old at Tokyo 2020.\n\nTo make his victory even more impressive, Sheng took the win with a new Olympic Record score of 252.2.\n\nSweden’s Victor Lindgren, the reigning world champion, narrowly lost out to take second place with a score of 251.4 in what was a nail-biting battle right until the end.\n\nCroatia’s Miran Maričić took bronze, but was incredibly emotional at realizing he won a medal.\n\nThis post was updated with remarks by Croatia’s Miran Maričić.\n\nChina wins diving gold in men's synchronized 10m platform\n\nIt was a dominant performance from China’s Lian Junjie and Yang Hao in the men’s synchronized 10m platform final, with the pair tallying a mammoth score of 490.35.\n\nThe duo, which have previously won three world championship titles, was making its Olympic debut in Paris and recorded the highest score in every round to win the gold medal.\n\n“It has taken many years to get to this level. We have been doing this for six years,” Yang told reporters, speaking about his teammate Lian.\n\nBritish pair Tom Daley and Noah Williams picked up the silver medal, making Daley the first diver to win three Olympic medals in the men’s 10m synchronized platform.\n\nDaley made his Olympic debut back in 2008, when he was just 14. His husband and two children were in the crowd to watch his latest achievement.\n\n“It was so special to see them here. I can’t wait to go and spend the rest of the afternoon with them,” Daley told reporters after receiving his medal.\n\nMeanwhile, Canada’s Rylan Wiens and Nathan Zsombor-Murray made history by claiming the bronze medal, marking the nation’s first podium finish in this event.\n\nThis post was updated with remarks by China’s Yang Hao and Great Britain’s Tom Daley.\n\nWhy some key tennis stars bow out of the quest for Olympic gold\n\nThe Olympic tennis tournament is underway, but the red clay of Roland Garros is missing some of the sport’s biggest stars, including world no. 1 Jannik Sinner.\n\nWhile some are sidelined by illnesses and injuries, others are abstaining as a result of the professional circuit’s brutal schedule this summer.\n\nBetween the French Open, Wimbledon and the US Open, summer is always a busy season for those chasing an elusive Grand Slam title. Though the rest of the sports world sees the Olympics as the ultimate competition, the Games’ anthem falls flat amidst the prestigious yearly summer tournaments in Paris, London and New York.\n\nBen Shelton, the rising 21-year-old US star ranked No. 14 in the world, said the Olympics fall at a tough time in the tournament schedule, as he will be coming off a stint in Europe and wants to prepare for the US Open.\n\nRead more on why this edition of the Olympic tennis tournament is a tough task for the world’s best players.\n\nRoland Garros is loud ahead of epic clash between Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic. Here's how to watch.\n\nThe first match of the day is about to get going at Court Philippe-Chatrier here at Roland Garros and it is going to be an electric afternoon in the Paris sunshine.\n\nToday’s first contest is a second-round encounter in the women’s tournament between France’s Diane Parry and Poland’s Iga Świątek. While the home nation’s crowd will certainly be behind Parry, it’s the second clash on the schedule that has everyone’s mouths watering.\n\nRafael Nadal, the “King of Clay” and 14-time winner of the French Open held annually on this court, is the sentimental favorite. Nadal has endeared himself to the Paris faithful over the years with his dominance of the French Open and is attempting to make one final run for gold on what could potentially be one of his last runs on these famous clay courts as he alludes to a career which is slowly winding down.\n\nMeanwhile, for Novak Djokovic — the winner of 24 grand slams, the most all-time in the men’s game — Nadal is a major obstacle to the one title he hasn’t won: an Olympic gold medal. The Serb has been open about his desire to win his first gold.\n\nNadal eked out a win in three sets on Sunday in his first-round match while Djokovic cruised on Saturday in his opening contest. The Spaniard has fought injuries for much of the last two years and his opponent will be favored — but there’s just something different about the Spaniard playing on Roland Garros’ clay.\n\nHere’s how to watch this epic match:\n\nUS: Peacock\n\nBrazil: Globo\n\nCanada: CBC\n\nChina: CCTV\n\nFrance: France Télévisions\n\nGermany: (MRHs) ARD/ZDF\n\nJapan: Fuji TV/NHK/Nippon TV/TBS/TV Asahi/TV Tokyo\n\nNew Zealand: SKY NZ\n\nSouth Africa: SuperSport\n\nUnited Kingdom: BBC Sport\n\nAcross rest of Europe: Discovery Eurosport\n\nUS superstars were front and center yesterday at the Summer Games. Catch up here\n\nWelcome to our Monday coverage of the 2024 Paris Olympics.\n\nFans saw plenty of standout performances at the Summer Games yesterday, from South Korean archers to newly crowned French swimming royalty. But the US in particular brought the star-power during an exciting day of action in Paris.\n\nIf you’re just catching up, here’s what happened at the Games on Sunday:\n\nGymnastics:\n\nMany Americans were just waking up when two things became clear: Simone Biles was feeling some pain during her long-awaited return to Olympic gymnastics — and it wasn’t going to stop her. Biles, who is considered one of the greatest gymnasts of all times, dealt with some calf pain after an awkward landing during warmups for her floor routine, but powered through it to ace each apparatus and register the top all-around score of 59.566.\n\nBacked by strong performances from Americans Suni Lee, Jordan Chiles and Jade Carey, Team USA finished on top of the women’s gymnastics qualifying scores, putting them in a confident position ahead of Tuesday’s medal round. Individually, Lee and Biles will compete for gold in all-around, while Chiles qualified for the floor exercise and Carey has qualified for the final in vault.\n\nBasketball:\n\nLeBron James, Kevin Durant and Anthony Edwards led the “Re-Dream team” to an emphatic win over NBA MVP Nikola Jokić and Serbia. James, Durant and Jrue Holiday showed this US team still runs through its veterans, but the 22-year-old Edwards made his presence known — on the court, and with sideline antics — in his Olympics debut.\n\nTennis:\n\nBritish legend Andy Murray, who has said he will retire after these Games, extended his career at least another match with a thrilling comeback win alongside doubles partner Dan Evans.\n\nSpain’s Rafael Nadal won in his return to singles action on the familiar clay courts of Roland-Garros, and set up a tantalizing second round match with Novak Djokovic. Nadal had previously suggested he may not compete in the singles tournament at all, and the crowd roared with approval at the veteran’s presence even before the match began.\n\nSwimming:\n\nFrench prodigy Leon Marchand set an Olympic record and crushed the field in the 400m individual medley. Marchand entered the Games widely considered the host nation’s top hope for gold in the pool, and the atmosphere was electric in La Défense Arena as the 22-year-old finished up his swim.\n\nAmerican swimmers Torri Huske and Gretchen Walsh finished in first and second place respectively in the women’s 100m butterfly final. The 21-year-old Huske finished with 55.59 to take home Team USA’s first individual gold medal of the 2024 Paris Olympics.\n\nOther key moments:\n\nThe US women’s soccer team brushed aside Germany in its second game of the Olympics, using a dynamic three-goal first half to cruise to a 4-1 victory. Forward Sophia Smith had two goals and the USWNT looks on track to shake off several frustrating tournaments.\n\nFrench cycling superstar Pauline Ferrand-Prévot claimed a gold medal in the women’s cross-country mountain bike race — then announced her retirement from the discipline to focus on road racing.\n\nThe South Korea women’s archery team is now tied for the longest active gold medal streak in an event at the Olympic Games, after defeating China in a thrilling shoot-off.\n\nJapanese teenage phenomenon Coco Yoshizawa won gold in the women’s street skateboarding. The 14-year-old was joined by two other teens on the podium: Liz Akama, also from Japan, and Brazil’s Rayssa Leal.\n\nSouth Korea’s Ban Hyo-jin becomes teenage gold medalist\n\nBan Hyo-jin is only 16, but she’s already got an Olympic gold medal to her name.\n\nThe South Korean teenager claimed victory in the women’s 10m air rifle final, beating China’s Huang Yuting in a shoot-off.\n\nBoth had equaled the Olympic record of 251.8 set at the Tokyo Games, before Ban held her nerve to take the gold.\n\n“I did not expect for the last two shots to be that close but after the last two shots I thought this was a great chance for me to prove I could get a gold medal. So I focused very intensely on the last shot,” Ban said after the final.\n\nHuang picked up the silver medal, while Switzerland’s Audrey Gogniat claimed bronze.\n\nThe post was updated with some remarks from Ban after her win.\n\nOrganizers apologize after church groups criticize alleged \"Last Supper\" parody during opening ceremony\n\nOrganizers of the Paris Olympics have apologized for what some critics described as a parody of “The Last Supper” during the lavish opening ceremony on Friday.\n\nThe scene featured drag artists and dancers and was widely criticized by the Catholic church and Christian groups.\n\nThe French Catholic Church said the festivities “included scenes of derision and mockery of Christianity.”\n\nWhile the scene has come under criticism, the opening ceremony was also widely praised, with some users pointing out that the scene was more reminiscent of other works, like “The Feast of the Gods” by Johann Rottenhammer and Jan Brueghel.\n\nThomas Jolly, the director of the opening ceremony, insisted that “The Last Supper” wasn’t the inspiration behind the scene in an interview with CNN affiliate BFMTV on Sunday.\n\n“Dionysus arrives at the table because he is the Greek God of celebration and that sequence is called ‘festivity,’” Jolly said.\n\n“The God of wine, which is also a French jewel and father of Sequana, the Goddess linked to the River Seine.The idea was to create a big pagan party in link with the God of Mount Olympus — and you will never find in me, or in my work, any desire of mocking anyone.”\n\nIn a post on X, formerly known as Twitter, the official Olympics account said the “interpretation of the Greek God Dionysus makes us aware of the absurdity of violence between human beings.”\n\nOrganizers says triathlon will go ahead despite growing worries over water quality in Seine\n\nThe rain that drenched Friday’s opening ceremony may have moved out of Paris, but its effects are still being felt in the River Seine, with water quality concerns throwing the triathlon competition into uncertainty.\n\nThe decision to hold some swimming events in the river that splits Paris raised eyebrows when it was first announced. Swimming in the Seine has been illegal for a century but, in their desire to put the host city on full display, organizers worked up a plan to clean up the river so the world’s best athletes could use it during Paris 2024.\n\nIt was a risky move: Pollution in the Seine typically jumps after heavy rains like the ones that fell on the French capital throughout Friday and most of Saturday. Training was canceled for a second straight day on Monday after water quality testing deemed the water unsafe for athletes.\n\nStill, organizers are confident the race will go ahead. The men’s triathlon is scheduled for Tuesday and the women’s triathlon for Wednesday. The contingency dates for those races are Thursday and Friday.\n\n“Given the weather forecast for the next 36 hours, Paris 2024 and World Triathlon are confident that water quality will return to below limits before the start of the triathlon competitions on July 30,” Paris 2024 and World Triathlon said.\n\nThe Paris area is also set for its first heat wave of the summer this week, which will hit at the same time as the triathlon.\n\nRead more about the Seine’s water quality.\n\nSurfing can be a contact sport, just ask France's Johanne Defay\n\nPicture surfing in most scenarios and usually you think of beautiful locales with people riding the waves, usually in laid-back or stress-free atmospheres.\n\nBut this isn’t any normal scenario on the water. The Olympic surfing competition — located very, very far from the River Seine and the picturesque atmosphere of Paris all the way in gorgeous Teahupo’o in Tahiti — features the top athletes on the planet competing fiercely for the one of the most coveted prizes in the sport.\n\nAnd sometimes, surfing can prove to be a rough, or even dangerous, sport.\n\nFrance’s Johanne Defay was surfing on day 1 of competition on Saturday when she fell off her board on her first wave, colliding with the rough coral reef and cutting her head.\n\nDefay required four stitches but returned, donning a helmet, and made it through the rest of the day before qualifying for the round of 16 on Day 2, taking down Australia’s Molly Picklum to lead the entire contingent of French surfers into the knockouts.\n\n“Yesterday on my first wave I had a fall… it just went so big, I went straight into the coral with my head, I had four stitches,” Defay said after qualifying for the round of 16.\n\n“They made me go through the concussion protocols and the results were so-so, so they made me go through them all again this morning… There’s no trauma, so we’re happy.”\n\nSo next time you watch surfing, just remember, behind the artistry and athletic ability on the water, it can be a contact sport.\n\nFirst heat wave of the year in France will coincide with the Olympics\n\nWith the 2024 Paris Games in full swing, a very hot air mass from Spain will spread into France this week, with Wednesday expected to be the hottest day of the sequence on a national scale.\n\nBoth high temperatures and low temperatures are expected to be well above average for the next several days, leading France’s meteorological department, Meteo-France, to issue orange heat warnings beginning Monday and Tuesday for 39 separate locations.\n\nHere are temperatures expected in some Olympic venue cities:\n\nIn Paris and the Paris region, maximum temperatures will reach 34 to 36°C (93 to 97°F) on Tuesday and Wednesday.\n\nIn Bordeaux, maximum temperatures will be close to 40°C (104°F) on Monday, still 38°C (100°F) on Tuesday, then drop more sharply afterward.\n\nIn Lyon, the maximum temperatures will approach 39°C (102°F) on Tuesday and Wednesday.\n\nIn Marseille, the maximum temperatures will reach 35°C (95°F).\n\nParts of southern France reached 100 degrees yesterday as the heat wave moved north.\n\nAnd today temperatures could reach as high as 104 near the Mediterranean and the southwestern portion of the nation.\n\nParis has a high of 86 degrees today and could see a high of 95 degrees tomorrow.\n\nIn pictures: Day two of the 2024 Paris Olympics\n\nThe Paris Olympics kicked into full gear this weekend.\n\nAs day three gets underway, catch up with some of the best photographs from the second day of competition.\n\nSee more of the best photos from the 2024 Paris Olympics."
