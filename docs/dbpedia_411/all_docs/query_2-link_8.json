        "text": "Atlanta 1996 Olympic Games, athletic festival held in Atlanta that took place July 19–August 4, 1996. The Atlanta Games were the 23rd occurrence of the modern Olympic Games.\n\nSelected over Athens to host the Centennial Summer Games, Atlanta staged one of the most extravagant Games in Olympic history. With a five-hour opening ceremony and the creation of a “country fair” atmosphere complete with booths, amusement park rides, and concerts, the 1996 Olympics cost nearly $1.7 billion. For the first time, the Games received no governmental financial support. Instead, corporate sponsors—including Coca-Cola, which supplied more than $300 million—and television rights were relied upon to defray costs. The result, many claimed, was excessive commercialization, and few believed that a privately funded Games would be held in the future. The Games also experienced transportation and accommodation problems, and, though extra security precautions were taken, a pipe-bomb explosion in Centennial Olympic Park caused one death. The perpetrator, American Eric Rudolph, also later bombed a gay night club in 1997 and an abortion clinic in 1998. He was sentenced to multiple terms of life imprisonment in 2005.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nThe Olympics Quiz\n\nFor the first time, all national Olympic committees (NOCs) invited to compete sent athletes, including each of the former Soviet republics, Burundi, North Korea, the Palestinian Authority, and Hong Kong, which won its first (and last) gold medal before its reunification with China (1997). A record 197 NOCs sent more than 10,000 contestants. The number of events reached 271 as women’s football (soccer), beach volleyball, lightweight rowing, women’s softball, and mountain biking (cross-country cycling) made their debuts.\n\nStandouts at the Atlanta Games included Carl Lewis (U.S.), who won his ninth gold medal in track and field, and Fu Mingxia (China), who won the women’s platform and springboard diving events. The 200-meter and 400-meter sprints were swept in the men’s and women’s competitions by Michael Johnson (U.S.) and Marie-José Pérec (France), respectively; Svetlana Masterkova (Russia) won the 800- and 1,500-meter titles."
