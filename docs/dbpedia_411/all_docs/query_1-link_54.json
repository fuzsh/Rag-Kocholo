        "text": "News\n\nSports News\n\nOlympics 2024\n\nParis Olympics 2024: A comprehensive list of summer sports\n\nParis Olympics 2024: A comprehensive list of summer sports\n\nThe 2024 Summer Olympics commenced in Paris with a grand opening featuring Celine Dion's performance. Athletes chose a unique entrance by sailing along the Seine River instead of the traditional stadium parade. The games include various sports like archery, athletics, badminton, and breakdancing, among others. Notably, karate is excluded this year.\n\nThe most awaited athletic event in the world, the 2024 Summer Olympics, finally kicked underway in Paris today. The event, which took place on a lively Friday night, presented Paris in all its beauty and set the stage for what looks to be an incredible Olympic Games. Renowned performer Celine Dion had a breath taking performance that stole the show at the celebration.\n\nThe athletes broke with convention by skipping the traditional parade through the stadium. Rather, they opted to sail along the Seine River on exquisitely decorated boats that gracefully meandered through the lovely scenery of Paris. These athletes will compete in various sports on behalf of their countries. However, which sports were part of the original ancient Olympics? Which games are currently included in this yearâs Olympics and which arenât. Find here.\n\nThe International Olympic Committee (IOC) organised the first ancient Summer Olympics, which took place in Athens, Greece, in 1896. The French nobleman Pierre de Coubertin established the committee, and the games were held from April 6â15, 1896. About 241 athletesâall of whom were menâfrom fourteen different countries competed in the game at that time. The competitors participated in 43 different games, which included boxing, sprinting, long jump, shot put, javelin, and equestrian competitions. The spirit of competition and the evolution of sports have since shaped the modern Olympics into the grand event we see in 2024.\n\nList of sports included in the Paris Olympics 2024\n\nS.No.\n\nName of the Sport\n\n1\n\nArchery\n\n2\n\nAthletics\n\n3\n\nBadminton\n\n4\n\nBasketball 3x3\n\n5\n\nBeach Volleyball\n\n6\n\nBoxing\n\n7\n\nBreak dancing\n\n8\n\nCanoe Slalom\n\n9\n\nCanoe Sprint\n\n10\n\nBMX Cycling\n\n11\n\nDiving\n\n12\n\nEquestrian\n\n13\n\nFencing\n\n14\n\nFootball\n\n15\n\nGolf\n\n16\n\nGymnastics\n\n17\n\nHandball\n\n18\n\nHockey\n\n19\n\nJudo\n\n20\n\nModern Pentathlon\n\n21\n\nRowing\n\n22\n\nRugby Sevens\n\n23\n\nSailing\n\n24\n\nShooting\n\n25\n\nSkateboarding\n\n26\n\nSport Climbing\n\n27\n\nSurfing\n\n28\n\nSwimming\n\n29\n\nTable Tennis\n\n30\n\nTaekwondo\n\n31\n\nTennis\n\n32\n\nTriathlon\n\n33\n\nVolleyball\n\n34\n\nWeightlifting\n\n35\n\nWrestling\n\nSports included in Olympics\n\nArchery\n\nThere are five medal events in the current Olympic archery competition: mixed team recurve, which is making a comeback following its debut in Tokyo, men's individual, women's individual, men's team, and women's team.

Competitors can make their own dives or select from a list of dives that have been evaluated based on difficulty. Approach, takeoff, elevation, movement execution, and entry into the water all result in points.\n\nEquestrian\n\nAt the moment, there are three horse sports offered at the Olympics: eventing, dressage, and jumping.

In addition, there is a mixed team competition with six athletes competing in three weight classes each gender.\n\nModern Pantheon\n\nSince the Stockholm Games in 1912, modern pentathlon has been a part of the Olympic program. The current Olympic movement was started by the French baron Pierre de Coubertin, who invented the sport.

The rugby sevens contests will begin two days ahead of the opening ceremony for the first time.\n\nSailing\n\nSince the inaugural Olympic Games, sailing has been a featured sport (although it was referred to as yachting until 2000).

Additionally, there are now 340 shooters competing instead of the previous number of 360.\n\nSkateboarding\n\nThe International Olympic Committee (IOC) took a vote in 2009 over the inclusion of roller sports in the 2016 Olympic schedule. Skateboarding was a strong competitor, but rugby and golf were chosen instead. Roller sports were included on the list of eight sports for the Tokyo Olympics in 2020 in 2013. Skateboarding and inline speed skating were included in the 2015 shortlist; however, only events involving street and park skating were allowed.\n\nSport Climbing\n\nThree disciplines comprise the Olympic climbing competition: bouldering, lead climbing, and speed climbing. A mixed speed, bouldering, and lead climbing competition was added for Tokyo 2020. The speed event was split off from the lead and bouldering events in Paris 2024, bringing the total number of medal events and competitors up to 68. Male and female competitors can compete for gold medals in the combined bouldering and lead event.\n\nSurfing\n\nTogether with four other new sports, surfing was eventually added to the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games schedule after years of fighting for inclusion. It will be back on schedule in 2024, but this time held in French Tahiti.\n\nSwimming\n\nThere are 35 swimming events in the pool for the 2024 Games in Paris, including the 4 Ã 100m mixed medley relay and 17 events for men and women. The 10km open-water swimming marathon for men and women is the other swimming competition at the Olympics.\n\nTable Tennis\n\nSince 1988, table tennis has been a feature of the Summer Olympic Games. Both men's and women's singles and pairs competitions are held. Chinese competitors have dominated the table tennis medals throughout Olympic history. Five things happen. Men's and women's teams, mixed doubles, and men's and women's singles are all open to competitors.\n\nTaekwondo\n\nOne of the two Asian martial arts that are part of the Olympic program is Taekwondo; the other is Judo. Since its debut as an official Olympic sport in the 2000 Games, taekwondo has been a part of the athletic schedule.\n\nTennis\n\nIn addition to the men's and women's singles and doubles competitions, there has been a mixed doubles event since London 2012. Tennis has five medal events: a mixed doubles competition in addition to men's and women's singles and doubles competitions. Roland-Garros will host the clay-court competition.\n\nTriathlon\n\nThe first triathlon competition took place during the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney. While there are differences in the competition durations used in triathlons across the globe, the Olympic distances consist of a 1.5-kilometer swim, a 40-kilometre cycle, and a 10-kilometre run. Three triathlon competitions are held in the Olympics: a mixed relay competition (a new event in 2020), a competition for men and women. Every competition has just one race with no heats for all participants.\n\nVolleyball\n\nBeach volleyball and indoor volleyball are the two types of volleyball played at the Olympics. Since 1964, it has been a recognised sport at the Olympics. In 1996, beach volleyball made its formal debut.\n\nWeightlifting\n\nAthletes are given three chances to complete each action in the current competition format: the \"snatch\" and the \"clean and jerk.\" The winners are determined by adding together the best performances in each lift. There are ten categories instead of fourteen (two fewer for men and women) than there were in Tokyo.\n\nMale categories: 61 kg,73 kg, 89 kg, 102 kg and +102kg\n\nFemale categories: 49 kg, 59 kg, 71 kg, 81 kg and +81 kg\n\nWrestling\n\nIn addition to being a competition in the ancient Olympic Games, wrestling debuted in the 1896 Summer Olympics. Wrestling has been a part of every Olympic program since these original Games, 1900 being the exception.\n\nGames excluded from the Paris Olympics 2024\n\nKarate\n\nGiven that boxing, judo, taekwondo, fencing, and wrestling are already among the combat sports offered at the Olympics, it was thought that Karate would have a difficult time getting accepted.\n\nAlso Read: |Paris Olympics 2024: know the dates, venues, news events and where to watch\n\nEnd of Article\n\nFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA\n\nVisual Stories\n\nParis Olympics: Records that have been broken\n\nsports\n\nManu Bhaker, Lakshya Sen, hockey team headline India's Day 7\n\nsports\n\nTop Olympic champions throughout history\n\nsports\n\nManu Bhaker scripts history with second medal on Day 4\n\nsports\n\nFastest fifty in test cricket\n\nsports\n\nIndian shooting stars: Olympic medal winners\n\nsports\n\nHeartbreak for India as Arjun misses medal on Day 3\n\nsports\n\nStars galore at India House's inauguration ceremony\n\nsports\n\nIndiaâs youngest cricketers to score 1000 runs in a year\n\nsports\n\nAll medals won by Manu Bhaker in her shooting career\n\nsports"
