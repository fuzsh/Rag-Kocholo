        "text": "Here are the athletes from North Texas who have either qualified for Team USA or heading to Olympic trials this summer in hopes of earning a spot for Paris.\n\nSHA’CARRI RICHARDSON - TRACK & FIELD\n\nSha’Carri Richardson, from Dallas, was crowned the fastest woman in the world on the track in the 100-meters. Richardson will represent Team USA in the 100m and 4x100m relay at the Paris Olympics after a first place finish at Trials in June.\n\nIn December of 2023, she won gold in Budapest for the world championships record. Richardson crossed the finish line at 10.65 seconds, just shy of Florence Griffith-Joyner’s world record that has stood for the last 35 years.\n\nRichardson graduated from Carter High School in Dallas.\n\nSCOTTIE SCHEFFLER - GOLF\n\nScottie Scheffler, from Highland Park, has officially qualified for the Paris Olympics in men's golf.\n\nLocal\n\nThe latest news from around North Texas.\n\nThe decorated golfer just celebrated his second Green Jacket win at the Masters in April 2024. Just after winning the Masters, he went on to win the coveted plaid jacket from the 2024 RBC Heritage tournament in South Carolina. The current world number one is the first player from the U.S. to be mathematically guaranteed qualification for the 2024 Olympics.\n\nIt will be Scheffler’s first Olympics after failing to qualify for the Games in Rio de Janeiro in 2016, when golf made its return to the Games or in Tokyo in 2020, which was postponed to 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe qualification period for golf ended on June 17 for men. Team USA will be made up of Scheffler, Xander Schauffele, Wyndham Clark and Collin Morikawa.\n\nHEZLY RIVERA - GYMNASTICS\n\nHezly Rivera, from Plano, has dedicated her entire life to gymnastics.\n\nHer sacrifices come with her family’s as well. The 15-year-old's family moved from New Jersey earlier in her career so that she could start training at WOGA Plano with world champion coaches Valeri and Anna Liukin. The Liukins are the parents of five-time Olympic medalist, Nastia Liukin.\n\nAt U.S. Olympic Trials, Rivera made the five-woman team headed to Paris and in the process became the youngest person on Team USA at 16 years and 26 days.\n\nSAM WATSON - SPORT CLIMBING\n\nSam Watson, from Southlake, is the reigning world record holder in sport climbing in the discipline of speed.\n\nThe 18-year-old recently broke the world record twice at the World Cup competition in China.\n\nWatson has been in the conversation as one of the favorites to win gold at the Paris Olympics as he has already qualified for a spot on Team USA.\n\nASHER HONG - GYMNASTICS\n\nAsher Hong of Plano will make his first Olympic appearance in Paris in 2024.\n\nHe was the 2023 U.S. Championship all-around champion and in the same year, he earned NCAA team and vault champion honors with Stanford University. That win made him the youngest U.S. men’s all-around gymnastics champion in 34 years.\n\nAt trials in June, Hong and four other men were named to Team USA.\n\nBRYCE HOPPEL - TRACK & FIELD\n\nBryce Hoppel is the reigning world indoor champion in the 800-meter. Hoppel ran a personal best and U.S. Olympic Trials record of 1:43 at the end of June to win first place in the men's 800m and secure his spot on Team USA for his second Olympic appearance.\n\nHoppel, who is from Midland, but lives in Dallas now, competed in the Tokyo Olympics in 2021 finishing 16th in the men’s 800m.\n\nWhen running for the University of Kansas, he won first place in both the indoor and outdoor NCAA championships in 2019.\n\nNIC FINK - SWIMMING\n\nNic Fink is headed to his second Olympics after his recent win in the 100-meter breaststroke at the U.S. Olympic Trials.\n\nThe now Dallas resident, who does some of his training at SMU was a grad student at Georgia Tech and spent his undergrad at the University of Georgia as a decorated athlete.\n\nFink finished fifth in Tokyo in 2021, hoping for a medal at the Paris Olympics.\n\nFink is originally from New Jersey and is married to 2016 Olympic gold medalist Melanie Margalis-Fink who is an assistant coach for SMU women's swimming.\n\nVINCENT HANCOCK - SKEET\n\nVincent Hancock, who lives in Argyle, is trying to do what no skeet shooter has done before. Paris will be his fifth Olympics (2008, 2012, 2016, 2020, 2024), and hoping for his fourth Olympic gold.\n\nThe decorated skeet shooter owns Northlake Shooting Sports in Denton County, where he coaches two other members of Team USA’s skeet shooting team.\n\nAusten Smith and Conner Prince both credit much of their success to Hancock’s teaching. North Texas skeet shooters are three of the four-member team.\n\nJASMINE MOORE - TRACK & FIELD\n\nMansfield Lake Ridge High School alum Jasmine Moore looks to make her second USA Olympic team at the U.S. Olympic Trials. Moore will be competing in triple jump and long jump.\n\nMoore, a Grand Prairie native, won the 2023 NCAA indoor championships with the University of Florida. As a senior at UF, Moore became the second woman to clear both 15m in the triple jump and 7m in the long jump indoors. Moore set the American and collegiate record in the triple jump and the collegiate record in the long jump at the NCAA Indoors on her way to her fifth and sixth national title as a Gator.\n\nMoore has been training on the East Coast ahead of the track and field trials in Eugene, Oregon June 21-30. When asked what's going through her mind as she tries to make it to her second consecutive Olympics she said, \"I am just focused on executing, seizing the moment and just trusting in the Lord and my training.\"\n\nMATT KING - SWIMMING\n\nMatt King trains at Texas Ford Aquatics in Frisco.

The swimming competition in Paris is scheduled to commence on July 27th and conclude on August 4th.\n\nJOURDAN DELACRUZ - WEIGHTLIFTING\n\nJourdan Delacruz was born in Wylie, but now calls Atlanta, GA home. Delacruz hopes to be one of three women to make the U.S. weightlifting team for the Paris Olympics. Delacruz, who is a decorated weightlifter, just missed the medal podium at the Tokyo Olympics.\n\nThe 25-year-old hopes that the previous Olympics experience paired with extensive training alongside Tokyo silver medalist Kate Vibert will be the perfect recipe for success in Paris. The two also mentor some of the best up-and-coming junior lifters in the country at the gym they workout at outside of Atlanta.\n\nDelacruz started her athletic career as a competitive gymnast before getting into CrossFit with her parents and eventually finding weightlifting.\n\nHer competition personal records include: 91 kg snatch, 116 kg clean & jerk, 207 kg total.\n\nUPDATE: Delacruz is headed to her second Olympics being selected on Team USA weightlifting in June.\n\nDAVID JOHNSTON - MEN'S SWIMMING\n\nDavid Johnston, a rising senior at the University of Texas at Austin and Dallas native, is heading to the Paris Olympics.\n\nHis runner-up finish in the 1500-meter freestyle at the U.S. Olympic Team trials earned him a spot on the 46-person team in swimming. Generally, the first-place finisher which was Bobby Fink, in the individual swimming events earns an automatic spot and the runner-up waits to be confirmed by USA Swimming. That confirmation came soon after the conclusion of Sunday’s final.\n\nUT has five current or former swimmers that will represent Team USA at the Paris Olympics.\n\nHAILEY VAN LITH - 3x3 BASKETBALL\n\nTCU guard Hailey Van Lith, Cameron Brink, Rhyne Howard, and Cierra Burdick will look to defend the United States gold medal performance at the Tokyo Olympics in 2021 in 3x3 basketball at the Paris Olympics this summer.\n\nVan Lith transferred to TCU this past spring after a season at LSU.

Burdick, Brink and Van Lith are all ranked that high.\n\nAUSTEN SMITH - SKEET\n\nAusten Smith, from Keller, is heading to her second Olympics in women’s skeet. Her first Olympic showing was in Tokyo.\n\nSmith's coach, Vincent Hancock, who is also on Team USA for skeet shooting says she is one of the best he has ever seen.\n\nIn a first of its kind at the Paris Olympics, the two will have the chance to medal twice -- once in the individual competition and again in the mixed-doubles team competition.\n\nJOSEPH BROWN - DISCUS\n\nJoseph Brown, Mansfield High School alumni, can now add Olympian to his resume. It wasn't without drama at the U.S. Olympic trials in Eugene, OR though. Going into his final throw, he was in eighth place. It was that sixth throw that was good enough to put him in third place. That third place earned him a spot on Team USA.\n\nBrown, who still lives in North Texas, also had a decorated college career at Texas A&M-Commerce, highlighted by an NCAA Division II national championship in 2019.\n\nCHIAKA OGBOGU - VOLLEYBALL\n\nChiaka Ogbogu, from Coppell, won gold at the Tokyo Olympics with USA Volleyball.
