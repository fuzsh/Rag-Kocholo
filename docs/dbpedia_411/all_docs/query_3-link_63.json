        "text": "The beach volleyball court has an incredible view of the Eiffel Tower\n\nThe beach volleyball court at the Paris Games has an iconic backdrop: The Eiffel Tower looms over the stadium, which was built on the Champ de Mars.\n\nAs the sun set over the tower and stadium, France’s Lezana Placette and Alexia Richard defeated Germany’s Laura Ludwig and Louisa Lippmann as the sun.\n\nAnd later at night, US duo Taryn Kloth and Kristen Nuss defeated Australia’s Taliqua Clancy and Mariafe Artacho as the Eiffel Tower’s glittered in the background. During that match, CNN’s Coy Wire reported that a party vibe broke out in the stadium, with music blasting, spectators dancing and cheering in the stands.\n\nUSA women’s basketball defeats Japan in quest for another Olympic gold\n\nThe USA women’s basketball team defeated Japan in its first Olympic game in Paris on Monday. Team USA came out on top after leading all game, 102-76.\n\nThis is the 56 consecutive Olympic win for the USA women’s basketball team, USA Basketball said in a post on X.\n\nJapan kept itself in the game during the first half by hitting nine three-pointers, but USA pulled away by the third quarter — leading by more than 20 and scoring most of their points inside. That trend continued for Team USA through the fourth quarter.\n\nUSA assistant coach Kara Lawson told NBC at halftime that the team was focused on exploiting the size advantage inside the paint and sharpening up defense in the second half.\n\nA’ja Wilson and Breanna Stewart led the way for the USA. Wilson has been the WNBA’s best player for years now and helped Team USA win gold at the Tokyo Olympics. Sabrina Ionescu contributed three three-pointers to the win.\n\nBelgium and Germany, the other teams in the group, are next on the USA’s Olympic schedule in its hunt for another gold medal.\n\nThe USA women’s Olympic team has won a total of nine gold medals, boasting an undefeated record since 1996. If they are able to take home gold again this year in Paris, it will be the team’s eighth gold medal in a row, according to USA Basketball.\n\nUkraine wins its first medal of the Paris Olympics\n\nUkrainian fencer Olga Kharlan won her country’s first medal of the Paris Summer Olympics, claiming the bronze medal Monday in the women’s sabre individual event at the Grand Palais in the French capital.\n\nFrance took gold and silver in the event, as Manon Apithy-Brunet defeated Sara Balzer by a score of 15-12. Apithy-Brunet won the bronze medal in this event at the Tokyo Olympics in 2021.\n\nIn a thrilling bronze medal bout against South Korean Choi Sebin, Kharlan prevailed by a score of 15-14.\n\nChoi led the match 11-5 before the 33-year-old Ukrainian reeled off seven consecutive points to take the lead.\n\nChoi retook the lead at 13-12, but Kharlan showed nerves of steel as she once again rallied to secure her fifth Olympic medal.\n\nKharlan is a veteran of five Olympic Games, having previously won two team and two individual medals including team sabre gold at the 2008 Beijing Games. This was Kharlan’s third career bronze medal in individual sabre, equaling her result at London 2012 and Rio 2016.\n\nThree-time Olympic gold medalist Adam Peaty tests positive for Covid\n\nThree-time Olympic gold medalist Adam Peaty has tested positive for Covid, Team GB said in a statement on Monday.\n\nThe 29-year-old began to feel unwell before his men’s 100m breaststroke final on Sunday, according to the statement, with his symptoms worsening in the hours before the race. He went onto finish 0.02 seconds behind race-winner Nicolo Martinenghi of Italy to win silver.\n\n“He is hopeful to be back in competition for the relay events later in the swimming programme,” the statement continued. “As in any case of illness, the situation is being managed appropriately, with all usual precautions being taken to keep the wider delegation healthy.”\n\nSunday’s silver medal takes Peaty’s tally of Olympic medals to six: three golds and three silvers.\n\n\"Grateful to be doing what I love,\" Simone Biles says, a day after fighting through a calf injury flareup\n\n“Grateful to be doing what I love,” Simone Biles said Monday in an Instagram post, a day after fighting through a calf injury flareup during women’s gymnastics qualification.\n\nDespite the apparent discomfort Sunday, she still ended up on the top of the leaderboard, with Biles in first place in the all-around rankings and with Team USA in first place in team standings.\n\nAfter her performance on the balance beam, Biles landed awkwardly while warming up for her floor routine and exited the arena before reemerging to get her lower left leg heavily taped.\n\nCecile Landi, her coach, told reporters after the competition that Biles had been dealing with calf pain a couple weeks before Paris that flared up again during Sunday’s competition.\n\nThe men’s team final takes place Monday, while the women’s team final is Tuesday.\n\nMichael Jung wins eventing individual gold for Germany\n\nMichael Jung won gold for Germany in the eventing individual final, becoming the first rider in history to win the Olympic title three times.\n\nThe 41-year-old finished with a score of 21.80, just ahead of Australia’s Christopher Burton on 22.40 in silver medal position.\n\nTeam GB’s Laura Collett picked up the bronze medal just hours after winning team gold.\n\nHang it in the Louvre – quite literally\n\nParis is known for its historical artifacts and world-renowned art.\n\nOne group of fans today showed their appreciation for the French capital’s traditions in a unique fashion.\n\nThe quartet dressed in images of Leonardo da Vinci’s Mona Lisa, which hangs in the city’s Louvre museum, with holes cut out to show their faces as they watched Germany’s men’s handball match against Japan.\n\nWith the four looking on, Germany was victorious 37-26 in their Group A encounter.\n\nTeam USA to finally receive figure skating gold medals from Beijing 2022 on August 7 in Paris\n\nTeam USA’s figure skating team will finally receive the gold medals it earned from the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics on August 7 in a special reallocation event in Paris following the Kamila Valieva doping case fallout.\n\nOn Monday, International Olympic Committee spokesman Mark Adams announced the delayed ceremony will occur at the Paris Games’ Champions Park, where 2024 Summer Olympics’ medal winners receive their hardware.\n\nInitially, Valieva and the other members of the Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) squad were awarded first in the team figure skating event. However, the results were removed when Valieva was disqualified after being found guilty of an anti-doping rule violation.\n\nThe reallocation also means the team from Japan will be awarded silver.\n\nIt is unclear who will receive bronze. Earlier this year, Canada filed an appeal with the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) seeking to move up to bronze position. CAS said last week it is still considering Canada’s appeal. As of now, the ROC sits in third after the reallocation.\n\nAdams also said that another allocation ceremony will take place in Paris on August 9. Ten other athletes will be awarded medals following retroactive results decisions from three previous Summer Olympic Games.\n\nHere is the latest medal count for this year's Olympic Games\n\nCNN is tracking every country in the race for the most gold medals in Paris at the 2024 Summer Olympic Games.\n\nCheck back throughout the two weeks of events for the number of golds by country.\n\nBelow is the medal count, so far:\n\nTeam GB's Tom Pidcock recovers from puncture to retain his mountain bike Olympic title\n\nTeam GB’s Tom Pidcock put in a heroic performance to recover from a puncture and still retain his mountain bike Olympic title on Monday.\n\nPidcock’s race looked to be over when he suffered a front wheel puncture on the third lap which cost him approximately 26 seconds and saw him slip down to ninth.\n\nBut the 24-year-old dug deep and clawed his way back despite falling almost 40 seconds behind the leading rider, France’s Victor Koretzky.\n\nAnd in an astonishing finish, Pidcock passed Koretzky with just over a lap to go, with the pair going head-to-head all the way to the finish line.\n\nPidcock staved off a late charge from the Frenchman but in the end, had enough to finish 9 seconds clear to complete a remarkable race for the reigning Olympic gold medalist.\n\nHe was joined in celebration by his family, while Koretzky could be seen in tears having won silver. South Africa’s Alan Hatherly finished in third to claim bronze.\n\nPidcock – who turns 25 on Tuesday – becomes just the second man to win two Olympic mountain bike gold medals after France’s Julien Absalon.\n\nAfter the race, Pidcock described his race as “suffering, suffering.”\n\n“I enjoy the races where I put the work in and it’s kind of easier – Tokyo was better in that respect because I was in control.\n\n“Here, I was not in control, I was fighting to come back. I made two mistakes, I punctured and fell off the course in the same place, so it was a battle out there.”\n\nHere are the official race times:\n\nPidcock: 1:26:22\n\nKoretzky: 1:26:31\n\nAlan Hatherly of South Africa: 1:26:33\n\nThis post was updated with remarks by Great Britain’s Tom Pidcock.\n\nNovak Djokovic puts an end to Rafael Nadal's comeback and moves on to the third round\n\nNovak Djokovic defeated Rafael Nadal in an epic showdown in the second round of the Olympics, putting the Spaniard away in straight sets 6-1, 6-4.\n\nHe finished the match with an exclamation mark ace.\n\nThe 24-time grand slam singles champion won the final two games of the second set after Nadal had won four straight, sending the Roland Garros crowd into raptures. But the top-seeded Serb would not be denied in his quest for a first gold medal and the completion of the career golden slam.\n\nTelecoms operators in parts of France hit by \"major sabotage,\" internet provider CEO says\n\nTelecommunication operators in six parts of France were hit overnight, after fiber optic lines were damaged in what is described as “major sabotage,” three days after Friday’s railway infrastructure attack.\n\nFrench internet provider Netalis CEO Nicolas Guillaume said in a post on X, that the “major sabotage” occurred at 2:15 a.m. local time Monday and that several operators were hit.\n\nImages shared on X by Guillaume show at least four cables that appear to have been sliced through.\n\nGuillaume said that the damage affected long-distance cables, adding that back-up routes were allowing traffic to be rerouted although latency was affected.\n\nHe said that it was a failure of the French state to unify small and large operators in France, which would have better protected the network infrastructure. “I am particularly angry,” Guillaume said.\n\nFrench digital affairs minister Marina Ferrari said that the center for electronic defense communications is cooperating with carriers until communications and services are fully restored.\n\n“I condemn these cowardly and irresponsible acts in the strongest possible terms,” she said.\n\nCNN has reached out to local prosecutors for comment.\n\nThe incident comes three days after saboteurs targeted high-speed railway lines in an attack coinciding with the start of the Olympics, affecting thousands of travelers.\n\nDjokovic breaks Nadal and is now serving for the match\n\nNovak Djokovic just put a halt to Nadal’s incredible second set rally after a hard-fought game.\n\nWith a break point, Djokovic is up 5-4 and just one game away from advancing toward his long-sought gold medal.\n\nNadal had all the momentum with him here at Roland Garros after Djokovic dominated the first set and the opening of the second. His back is now against the wall as he faces elimination in the second round of the tournament.\n\nNadal draws even with Djokovic in the second set, 4-4\n\nRafael Nadal has now taken four consecutive games from Novak Djokovic as the top-seeded Serb is reeling.\n\nRoland Garros is rocking and Nadal looks a completely different player from earlier in the match.\n\nDjokovic still is only two games away from taking this match but all the momentum is with his longtime rival.\n\nCoco Gauff reaches 3rd round of women's singles tournament with straight sets win over María Lourdes Carlé\n\nCoco Gauff advanced to the third round of the women’s singles tournament on Monday after a straight sets victory over María Lourdes Carlé.\n\nThe No. 2 seed raced into a 5-0 lead in the first set on Court Suzanne-Lenglen, eventually winning 6-1.\n\nThe US player broke Argentina’s Carlé in the opening game of the second set to continue to assert her control, racing away to clinch her spot in the next round 6-1.\n\nGauff has already shown she is formidable on Paris’ clay courts this year, having won the women’s doubles title at the French Open in June.\n\nShe will now face Croatia’s Donna Vekić in the next round after the 28-year-old beat Bianca Andreescu in straight sets earlier on Monday.\n\nVekić’s run to the third round continues her excellent form this season, after reaching the semifinals of Wimbledon earlier this month, her career-best performance at a grand slam.\n\nNadal takes 3 straight games and the mood has completely changed at Roland Garros\n\nThe cheers of “Rafa!” began feeling a little half-hearted here in Paris as Novak Djokovic built a 4-0 lead in the second set, threatening to run away with this one.\n\nBut Rafael Nadal and Paris have a special relationship. And he’s riding that wave of love to a remarkable surge in momentum.\n\nIt’s now 4-3 in the second set and we are set for a crucial game. If Nadal breaks Djokovic here, then it’s all to play for. But if this wave of momentum breaks, then Djokovic is just one set away from victory.\n\nNadal breaks Djokovic and is clawing back into this match, down 4-2\n\nWell, don’t look now but Rafael Nadal isn’t quite done yet.\n\nThe Spanish great has a tall mountain to climb against Novak Djokovic but he’s taken two straight games in the second set and now trails 4-2. He just broke Djokovic after the Serb double faulted.\n\nIf he takes this third game, expect Roland Garros to explode.\n\nSweat is pouring from Nadal as he tries to stop Djokovic's momentum\n\nRafael Nadal was just shown on the big screen here with sweat pouring off his face in between games.\n\nIt’s a bright and warm day here in the French capital and Nadal seems to be wilting under the combination of the heat and Novak Djokovic’s power. He’s now down 4-0 in the second set after dropping the first set 6-1.\n\nThis court has been Nadal’s playground for the better part of two decades. This might end up being one of his worst days here as Djokovic is doing whatever he wants.\n\nDjokovic looks unstoppable as he jumps out to second set lead\n\nNovak Djokovic just powered an ace past Rafael Nadal and is threatening to steam roll the Spaniard here in the second round of the Olympics.\n\nThe Serb is seeking a golden slam – something only accomplished by four other players in men’s and women’s tennis – by adding a gold medal to his career grand slam. He’s up 2-0 in the second set after winning the first.\n\nHe’s one of the all-time greats and he’s making another member of that club – Nadal – look like the oft-injured 38-year-old that he is. Djokovic, just a year younger, just feels a bit stronger at this point.\n\nDjokovic takes the first set in his bout with Nadal\n\nNovak Djokovic is one set away from clearing a major hurdle in his quest for a first gold medal.\n\nWith a 6-1 shellacking of Rafael Nadal in the first set, Djokovic has looked overpowering for much of this match so far.\n\nNadal looked a little better in the last two games of the opening set, but he’ll need all of the energy from the partisan Paris crowd to help him back into this one.\n\nThe heat might also become a factor here as the early afternoon sun beats down here in Paris. It’s a picture perfect day with not a cloud above Roland Garros – but it’s also in the mid-80s in Paris as the City of Light faces its first heat wave of the summer this week.\n\nBoth players are relaxing under the shade of umbrellas in between sets here.\n\nThe crowd cries for \"Rafa!\" and Nadal is trying to answer as he trails Djokovic\n\nHe’s the King of Clay and beloved here in Paris, but Rafael Nadal started off this match seeming overwhelmed by Novak Djokovic.\n\nThe crowd favorite in Paris has won the French Open an unbelievable 14 times, more than anyone else, and might as well be charging rent to other players who take Phillipe-Chartrier Court.\n\nWith every point he scores, the crowd here explodes and chants of “Ra-fa!” follow most points.\n\nHe just won his first game of the match, but is down 5-1 to his longtime rival in the first set. But with the crowd on his side, momentum could switch quickly.\n\nWorld Triathlon president says she's confident that men’s event will go ahead on Tuesday\n\nMarisol Casado, president of World Triathlon, told CNN on Monday that she was confident the men’s event would go ahead as planned on Tuesday, after training was suspended for the second straight day amid concerns over the water quality in the River Seine.\n\nQuality testing deemed the river unsafe for athletes on both Sunday and Monday after heavy rainfall on Friday and parts of Saturday.\n\nThe men’s triathlon is scheduled for Tuesday and the women’s triathlon is scheduled for Wednesday. The contingency dates for those races are Thursday and Friday, respectively.\n\nDespite this, Casado did not rule out the possibility of the race being moved if water quality does not improve to the required level, adding that the swimming leg of the triathlon could be eliminated in the “worst scenario,” converting the competition into a duathlon with a run, cycle and another run: “I hope we’re not going to arrive to this point.”\n\nAsked how confident she is that the event will be held as planned on Tuesday, Casado said that her confidence level is 8 out 10 and that weather conditions are improving.\n\nDjokovic breaks Nadal again to take a 4-0 lead\n\nThe all-time men’s grand slam leader is flying out of the blocks here.\n\nHe just took the third and fourth games of the match, breaking Nadal’s serve a second time to take a commanding lead in the first set – including not allowing Nadal to take a point in the third game of the set.\n\nIt’s probably a little earlier for a pressure moment than Nadal would have wanted, but he’s facing a crucial game.\n\nDjokovic has also displayed a bit of sportsmanship: on a close shot that got by him on his left, the Serb went over to the ball mark to show it had landed in play.\n\nDjokovic breaks Nadal in 2nd game of their match\n\nIt didn’t take long for a major moment in the match to take place.\n\nNovak Djokovic just got the first break of the match in only the second game. He’s now up 2-0 over Rafael Nadal in the early going.\n\nUnlike in grand slam play, Olympic men’s matches are only three sets. That means there’s little margin for error from either competitor as the match gets going.\n\nDjokovic takes the first game as epic clash against Nadal gets underway\n\nTop-seeded Novak Djokovic has taken the first game in his match against Rafael Nadal as this clash of the titans gets going at Ronald Garros today.\n\nIf the first game is any indication, we are in for a treat. The power of both men has been on display so far with both sending rockets past one another in the opening game.\n\nWhile the crowd is mostly pro-Nadal, with loud chants of “Ra-fa!” after most points, bursts of noise follow every winner in this nearly 15,000 seat stadium.\n\nTeam GB defends team eventing title to secure first gold medal of Paris Olympics\n\nTeam GB defended its team eventing title Monday to earn the nation’s first gold medal of the Paris Olympics.\n\nRider Laura Collett – teamed up with Rosalind Canter and Tom McEwen – put in a near-faultless final round to secure back-to-back Olympic titles ahead of host nation France, whose riders were overjoyed with securing silver.\n\nIt’s only the second time Team GB has successfully defended the team eventing title after also doing so in 1972, according to the BBC.\n\nTeam GB now has five Olympic golds in team eventing, the most in history.\n\nJapan took the bronze medal, its first equestrian medal since 1932.\n\n“Unreal feeling,” Collett said of retaining gold. “It felt so special in Tokyo, but this is blowing it out of the water.”\n\nMcEwen added: “Humans. Spectators. It’s been amazing. From yesterday’s cross-country with the noise as you were going around, it’s like a world of noise following you around. Today’s shown off the best of this sport’s abilities.\n\n“These horses have been incredible and these people in this team is even better.”\n\nThis post was updated with remarks by Great Britain’s Laura Collett and Tom McEwen.\n\nDjokovic and Nadal take the court and Roland Garros explodes\n\nThe anticipation is off the charts here. Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal just posed for the prematch photo and are warming up to roars from Roland Garros.\n\nFew people are sitting as the two men knock the ball back and forth across the clay. They’re both wearing the red shirts of their respective countries and Nadal is in his trademark white headband.\n\nNadal and Djokovic set for their 60th matchup\n\nIt’s one of the most storied rivalries in world tennis over the last two decades.\n\nMonday’s match will be the 60th time Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal have faced each other, extending their record. Over their previous matches, Djokovic has the slimmest of advantages over Nadal, 30-29.\n\nThey’ve met before in the Olympics, in the 2008 semifinals that Nadal won on his way to a gold medal. Their last meeting was in 2022 at Roland Garros in the French Open, which Nadal also won.\n\nThe crowd here in Paris is absolutely amped in preparation for this renewal of a legendary matchup, with Djokovic looking for his first gold medal in his career.\n\nOlympic Games officials say they are confident triathlon events will go ahead Tuesday\n\nOlmpic officials remain confident that triathlon events will be able to go ahead despite concerns over the water quality of the River Seine.\n\nSpeaking at the daily International Olympic Committee press conference, Thobois said that “as you could see there’s been quite a lot of rain in the last couple of days, but we are monitoring very closely,” adding that the forecast is improving.\n\n“We are very respectful of the athletes and they are the heart of the Olympic Games,” Thobois added when pressed on how he feels about the athletes going to bed tonight not knowing whether they will be able to compete when they wake up.\n\nThe Paris 2024 chief reiterated that everything possible has been done “to achieve the level quality to swim in the River Seine.”\n\nAsked whether authorities are concerned about the current of the river, Thobois said that although “it’s been much higher than normally this time of the year,” there are no issues in this regard.\n\nIga Świątek cruises past France's Diane Parry in straight sets\n\nIga Świątek of Poland, the top-ranked player in the world and one of the favorites for a gold medal here in Paris, is through to the third round.\n\nŚwiątek eased past Diane Parry 6-1 6-1 and never really let the Frenchwoman into the match.\n\nThe three-time defending French Open champion will face China’s Wang Xiyu after she defeated Russian Diana Shnaider, who participated as an “Individual Neutral Athlete,” in the third round.\n\nNext up at Roland Garros: Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic in the day’s most-anticipated matchup.\n\nWhat to watch out for today\n\nIt was another action-packed day at the Games yesterday and Day 3 shows no signs of slowing down.\n\nNadal vs Djokovic: A huge moment at this year’s Games is almost underway in the men’s singles tennis tournament. Two of the greatest players of all-time, Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic, are facing each other in the second round at Court Philippe-Chatrier with play set to begin very shortly.\n\nTeam USA women’s basketball: Much is expected of the US women’s basketball team at this year’s Olympics, as it bids to win an eighth consecutive gold medal. The squad’s campaign gets underway against Japan, with action due to start at 3 p.m. ET (9 p.m. local).\n\nMen’s skateboarding final: We saw a 14-year-old win gold in the women’s street skateboarding final yesterday and it’s now over to the men. The men’s street skateboarding final is due to start at 11 a.m. ET (5 p.m. local) and defending Olympic champion Yuto Horigome is one to watch out for.\n\nGymnastics team final: The men’s team gymnastics final is set to begin at 11:30 a.m. ET (5:30 p.m. local). The US will be looking to win its first team medal in the event since 2008.\n\nSwimming finals: A total of five gold medals are up for grabs in the pool later today. The finals will get underway at 2:30 p.m. ET (8:30 p.m. local) and will feature the likes of Australia’s Ariarne Titmus, who is looking for yet more glory in the women’s 200m freestyle.\n\nWorld No. 1 Iga Świątek takes first set over France's Diane Parry\n\nThe partisan crowd here at Roland Garros is loud and behind its favorite Diane Parry, but the world No. 1 Iga Świątek is showing her quality.\n\nThe Polish star took the first set 6-1, with Parry only taking the penultimate game. Świątek has looked strong, keeping her French opponent – the 59th ranked player in the world – off balance with a series of powerful serves and deft volleys.\n\nParry seemed to come into the match during the last two games of the first set, leading to loud cheers from the crowd.\n\nTeenager Sheng Lihao wins gold for China in the men's 10-meter air rifle\n\nIt’s turning out to be a brilliant start to the week for Chinese athletes at the Olympic Games.\n\nNot long after Chinese divers Lian Junjie and Yang Hao picked up gold in the men’s synchronized diving, 19-year-old Sheng Lihao took the top podium spot in the men’s 10-meter air rifle final.\n\nIt’s the teenager’s second gold medal of these Games after he was also crowned Olympic champion in the 10-meter air rifle mixed team event alongside Huang Yuting.\n\nSheng is already putting together a formidable Olympic record at such a young age, adding the two golds to a silver medal he won in the 10-meter air rifle as a 16-year-old at Tokyo 2020.\n\nTo make his victory even more impressive, Sheng took the win with a new Olympic Record score of 252.2.\n\nSweden’s Victor Lindgren, the reigning world champion, narrowly lost out to take second place with a score of 251.4 in what was a nail-biting battle right until the end.\n\nCroatia’s Miran Maričić took bronze, but was incredibly emotional at realizing he won a medal.\n\nThis post was updated with remarks by Croatia’s Miran Maričić.\n\nChina wins diving gold in men's synchronized 10m platform\n\nIt was a dominant performance from China’s Lian Junjie and Yang Hao in the men’s synchronized 10m platform final, with the pair tallying a mammoth score of 490.35.\n\nThe duo, which have previously won three world championship titles, was making its Olympic debut in Paris and recorded the highest score in every round to win the gold medal.\n\n“It has taken many years to get to this level. We have been doing this for six years,” Yang told reporters, speaking about his teammate Lian.\n\nBritish pair Tom Daley and Noah Williams picked up the silver medal, making Daley the first diver to win three Olympic medals in the men’s 10m synchronized platform.\n\nDaley made his Olympic debut back in 2008, when he was just 14. His husband and two children were in the crowd to watch his latest achievement.\n\n“It was so special to see them here. I can’t wait to go and spend the rest of the afternoon with them,” Daley told reporters after receiving his medal.\n\nMeanwhile, Canada’s Rylan Wiens and Nathan Zsombor-Murray made history by claiming the bronze medal, marking the nation’s first podium finish in this event.\n\nThis post was updated with remarks by China’s Yang Hao and Great Britain’s Tom Daley.\n\nWhy some key tennis stars bow out of the quest for Olympic gold\n\nThe Olympic tennis tournament is underway, but the red clay of Roland Garros is missing some of the sport’s biggest stars, including world no. 1 Jannik Sinner.\n\nWhile some are sidelined by illnesses and injuries, others are abstaining as a result of the professional circuit’s brutal schedule this summer.\n\nBetween the French Open, Wimbledon and the US Open, summer is always a busy season for those chasing an elusive Grand Slam title. Though the rest of the sports world sees the Olympics as the ultimate competition, the Games’ anthem falls flat amidst the prestigious yearly summer tournaments in Paris, London and New York.\n\nBen Shelton, the rising 21-year-old US star ranked No. 14 in the world, said the Olympics fall at a tough time in the tournament schedule, as he will be coming off a stint in Europe and wants to prepare for the US Open.\n\nRead more on why this edition of the Olympic tennis tournament is a tough task for the world’s best players.\n\nRoland Garros is loud ahead of epic clash between Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic. Here's how to watch.\n\nThe first match of the day is about to get going at Court Philippe-Chatrier here at Roland Garros and it is going to be an electric afternoon in the Paris sunshine.\n\nToday’s first contest is a second-round encounter in the women’s tournament between France’s Diane Parry and Poland’s Iga Świątek. While the home nation’s crowd will certainly be behind Parry, it’s the second clash on the schedule that has everyone’s mouths watering.\n\nRafael Nadal, the “King of Clay” and 14-time winner of the French Open held annually on this court, is the sentimental favorite. Nadal has endeared himself to the Paris faithful over the years with his dominance of the French Open and is attempting to make one final run for gold on what could potentially be one of his last runs on these famous clay courts as he alludes to a career which is slowly winding down.\n\nMeanwhile, for Novak Djokovic — the winner of 24 grand slams, the most all-time in the men’s game — Nadal is a major obstacle to the one title he hasn’t won: an Olympic gold medal. The Serb has been open about his desire to win his first gold.\n\nNadal eked out a win in three sets on Sunday in his first-round match while Djokovic cruised on Saturday in his opening contest. The Spaniard has fought injuries for much of the last two years and his opponent will be favored — but there’s just something different about the Spaniard playing on Roland Garros’ clay.\n\nHere’s how to watch this epic match:\n\nUS: Peacock\n\nBrazil: Globo\n\nCanada: CBC\n\nChina: CCTV\n\nFrance: France Télévisions\n\nGermany: (MRHs) ARD/ZDF\n\nJapan: Fuji TV/NHK/Nippon TV/TBS/TV Asahi/TV Tokyo\n\nNew Zealand: SKY NZ\n\nSouth Africa: SuperSport\n\nUnited Kingdom: BBC Sport\n\nAcross rest of Europe: Discovery Eurosport\n\nUS superstars were front and center yesterday at the Summer Games. Catch up here\n\nWelcome to our Monday coverage of the 2024 Paris Olympics.\n\nFans saw plenty of standout performances at the Summer Games yesterday, from South Korean archers to newly crowned French swimming royalty. But the US in particular brought the star-power during an exciting day of action in Paris.\n\nIf you’re just catching up, here’s what happened at the Games on Sunday:\n\nGymnastics:\n\nMany Americans were just waking up when two things became clear: Simone Biles was feeling some pain during her long-awaited return to Olympic gymnastics — and it wasn’t going to stop her. Biles, who is considered one of the greatest gymnasts of all times, dealt with some calf pain after an awkward landing during warmups for her floor routine, but powered through it to ace each apparatus and register the top all-around score of 59.566.\n\nBacked by strong performances from Americans Suni Lee, Jordan Chiles and Jade Carey, Team USA finished on top of the women’s gymnastics qualifying scores, putting them in a confident position ahead of Tuesday’s medal round. Individually, Lee and Biles will compete for gold in all-around, while Chiles qualified for the floor exercise and Carey has qualified for the final in vault.\n\nBasketball:\n\nLeBron James, Kevin Durant and Anthony Edwards led the “Re-Dream team” to an emphatic win over NBA MVP Nikola Jokić and Serbia. James, Durant and Jrue Holiday showed this US team still runs through its veterans, but the 22-year-old Edwards made his presence known — on the court, and with sideline antics — in his Olympics debut.\n\nTennis:\n\nBritish legend Andy Murray, who has said he will retire after these Games, extended his career at least another match with a thrilling comeback win alongside doubles partner Dan Evans.\n\nSpain’s Rafael Nadal won in his return to singles action on the familiar clay courts of Roland-Garros, and set up a tantalizing second round match with Novak Djokovic. Nadal had previously suggested he may not compete in the singles tournament at all, and the crowd roared with approval at the veteran’s presence even before the match began.\n\nSwimming:\n\nFrench prodigy Leon Marchand set an Olympic record and crushed the field in the 400m individual medley. Marchand entered the Games widely considered the host nation’s top hope for gold in the pool, and the atmosphere was electric in La Défense Arena as the 22-year-old finished up his swim.\n\nAmerican swimmers Torri Huske and Gretchen Walsh finished in first and second place respectively in the women’s 100m butterfly final. The 21-year-old Huske finished with 55.59 to take home Team USA’s first individual gold medal of the 2024 Paris Olympics.\n\nOther key moments:\n\nThe US women’s soccer team brushed aside Germany in its second game of the Olympics, using a dynamic three-goal first half to cruise to a 4-1 victory. Forward Sophia Smith had two goals and the USWNT looks on track to shake off several frustrating tournaments.\n\nFrench cycling superstar Pauline Ferrand-Prévot claimed a gold medal in the women’s cross-country mountain bike race — then announced her retirement from the discipline to focus on road racing.\n\nThe South Korea women’s archery team is now tied for the longest active gold medal streak in an event at the Olympic Games, after defeating China in a thrilling shoot-off.\n\nJapanese teenage phenomenon Coco Yoshizawa won gold in the women’s street skateboarding. The 14-year-old was joined by two other teens on the podium: Liz Akama, also from Japan, and Brazil’s Rayssa Leal.\n\nSouth Korea’s Ban Hyo-jin becomes teenage gold medalist\n\nBan Hyo-jin is only 16, but she’s already got an Olympic gold medal to her name.\n\nThe South Korean teenager claimed victory in the women’s 10m air rifle final, beating China’s Huang Yuting in a shoot-off.\n\nBoth had equaled the Olympic record of 251.8 set at the Tokyo Games, before Ban held her nerve to take the gold.\n\n“I did not expect for the last two shots to be that close but after the last two shots I thought this was a great chance for me to prove I could get a gold medal. So I focused very intensely on the last shot,” Ban said after the final.\n\nHuang picked up the silver medal, while Switzerland’s Audrey Gogniat claimed bronze.\n\nThe post was updated with some remarks from Ban after her win.\n\nOrganizers apologize after church groups criticize alleged \"Last Supper\" parody during opening ceremony\n\nOrganizers of the Paris Olympics have apologized for what some critics described as a parody of “The Last Supper” during the lavish opening ceremony on Friday.\n\nThe scene featured drag artists and dancers and was widely criticized by the Catholic church and Christian groups.\n\nThe French Catholic Church said the festivities “included scenes of derision and mockery of Christianity.”\n\nWhile the scene has come under criticism, the opening ceremony was also widely praised, with some users pointing out that the scene was more reminiscent of other works, like “The Feast of the Gods” by Johann Rottenhammer and Jan Brueghel.\n\nThomas Jolly, the director of the opening ceremony, insisted that “The Last Supper” wasn’t the inspiration behind the scene in an interview with CNN affiliate BFMTV on Sunday.\n\n“Dionysus arrives at the table because he is the Greek God of celebration and that sequence is called ‘festivity,’” Jolly said.\n\n“The God of wine, which is also a French jewel and father of Sequana, the Goddess linked to the River Seine.The idea was to create a big pagan party in link with the God of Mount Olympus — and you will never find in me, or in my work, any desire of mocking anyone.”\n\nIn a post on X, formerly known as Twitter, the official Olympics account said the “interpretation of the Greek God Dionysus makes us aware of the absurdity of violence between human beings.”\n\nOrganizers says triathlon will go ahead despite growing worries over water quality in Seine\n\nThe rain that drenched Friday’s opening ceremony may have moved out of Paris, but its effects are still being felt in the River Seine, with water quality concerns throwing the triathlon competition into uncertainty.\n\nThe decision to hold some swimming events in the river that splits Paris raised eyebrows when it was first announced. Swimming in the Seine has been illegal for a century but, in their desire to put the host city on full display, organizers worked up a plan to clean up the river so the world’s best athletes could use it during Paris 2024.\n\nIt was a risky move: Pollution in the Seine typically jumps after heavy rains like the ones that fell on the French capital throughout Friday and most of Saturday. Training was canceled for a second straight day on Monday after water quality testing deemed the water unsafe for athletes.\n\nStill, organizers are confident the race will go ahead. The men’s triathlon is scheduled for Tuesday and the women’s triathlon for Wednesday. The contingency dates for those races are Thursday and Friday.\n\n“Given the weather forecast for the next 36 hours, Paris 2024 and World Triathlon are confident that water quality will return to below limits before the start of the triathlon competitions on July 30,” Paris 2024 and World Triathlon said.\n\nThe Paris area is also set for its first heat wave of the summer this week, which will hit at the same time as the triathlon.\n\nRead more about the Seine’s water quality.\n\nSurfing can be a contact sport, just ask France's Johanne Defay\n\nPicture surfing in most scenarios and usually you think of beautiful locales with people riding the waves, usually in laid-back or stress-free atmospheres.\n\nBut this isn’t any normal scenario on the water. The Olympic surfing competition — located very, very far from the River Seine and the picturesque atmosphere of Paris all the way in gorgeous Teahupo’o in Tahiti — features the top athletes on the planet competing fiercely for the one of the most coveted prizes in the sport.\n\nAnd sometimes, surfing can prove to be a rough, or even dangerous, sport.\n\nFrance’s Johanne Defay was surfing on day 1 of competition on Saturday when she fell off her board on her first wave, colliding with the rough coral reef and cutting her head.\n\nDefay required four stitches but returned, donning a helmet, and made it through the rest of the day before qualifying for the round of 16 on Day 2, taking down Australia’s Molly Picklum to lead the entire contingent of French surfers into the knockouts.\n\n“Yesterday on my first wave I had a fall… it just went so big, I went straight into the coral with my head, I had four stitches,” Defay said after qualifying for the round of 16.\n\n“They made me go through the concussion protocols and the results were so-so, so they made me go through them all again this morning… There’s no trauma, so we’re happy.”\n\nSo next time you watch surfing, just remember, behind the artistry and athletic ability on the water, it can be a contact sport.\n\nFirst heat wave of the year in France will coincide with the Olympics\n\nWith the 2024 Paris Games in full swing, a very hot air mass from Spain will spread into France this week, with Wednesday expected to be the hottest day of the sequence on a national scale.\n\nBoth high temperatures and low temperatures are expected to be well above average for the next several days, leading France’s meteorological department, Meteo-France, to issue orange heat warnings beginning Monday and Tuesday for 39 separate locations.\n\nHere are temperatures expected in some Olympic venue cities:\n\nIn Paris and the Paris region, maximum temperatures will reach 34 to 36°C (93 to 97°F) on Tuesday and Wednesday.\n\nIn Bordeaux, maximum temperatures will be close to 40°C (104°F) on Monday, still 38°C (100°F) on Tuesday, then drop more sharply afterward.\n\nIn Lyon, the maximum temperatures will approach 39°C (102°F) on Tuesday and Wednesday.\n\nIn Marseille, the maximum temperatures will reach 35°C (95°F).\n\nParts of southern France reached 100 degrees yesterday as the heat wave moved north.\n\nAnd today temperatures could reach as high as 104 near the Mediterranean and the southwestern portion of the nation.\n\nParis has a high of 86 degrees today and could see a high of 95 degrees tomorrow."
