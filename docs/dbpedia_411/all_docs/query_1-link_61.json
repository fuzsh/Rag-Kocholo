Then after shaking hands with Italy, they all took turns giving long hugs to the coaches and support staff.\n\nNo doubt, No. 4 Italy vs. the fifth-ranked U.S. made for quite a matchup.\n\nMight Anderson consider making another run at the Olympics in Los Angeles four years from now at age 41?\n\n“We'll see,” he said this week, “we'll see.”\n\nKahleah Copper, Alyssa Thomas continue march to basketball gold 🏀\n\nThe U.S. women’s basketball team hasn’t lost in the Olympics since Nirvana topped the charts.\n\nThe Americans last lost at the 1992 Barcelona Games as their streak reached 60 consecutive wins with an 85-64 win over Australia.\n\nNow, Pennsylvanian natives Alyssa Thomas and Kahleah Copper are looking to keep the winning streak alive in Sunday's gold medal game.\n\nhe U.S. are trying to become the first team to win eight consecutive gold medals, breaking the tie with the American men's program that won seven in a row from 1936-68.\n\nA win Sunday would give Diana Taurasi a record six gold medals.

The fans in Philly are, in a word, passionate. And those years of being on stage for the 76ers’ faithful has prepared him for these Paris Olympics.\n\nIn a very odd way, that is.\n\n“Playing in Philly,” Embiid said, “they boo their own guys.”\n\nThat’s why hearing the boos in France — he’s gotten them throughout the Paris Games after choosing to play for the U.S. instead of the host nation — isn’t fazing him.\n\nThe U.S. will play Victor Wembanyama and France for gold on Saturday.\n\nUSA women spike Brazil to advance to volleyball gold medal game\n\nPenn State alum Haleigh Washington helped lead the U.S. women's volleyball team into the gold medal match by winning a dramatic five-set semifinal match against Brazil.\n\nThe U.S. defeated Brazil 3-2 in Thursday's match, which was a rematch of the gold medal match three years ago.\n\nBoth sides were even throughout the contest. The U.S. took the first (25-23) and third sets (25-15), Brazil won the second (25-18) and fourth (25-23).\n\nIt all came down to a decisive fifth set.
