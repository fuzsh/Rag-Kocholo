        "text": "Editor’s note: This story originally appeared Aug. 5, 2016.\n\nThe Olympics have historically included a wide array of Greater Cincinnati athletes, with a fair number taking home medals.\n\nHeather Mitts won three gold medals in soccer. Bryan Volpenhein won gold and bronze in rowing. Gymnasts Amanda Borden and Jaycie Phelps were part of the Magnificent Seven. Darrell Pace has two golds and a silver plus national and world titles in archery, earning him the honor of the World Archery Federation’s “Athlete of the Century.”\n\nBut three past Olympians from the area stand out for the mark they made not only on the Games but on their sport and, frankly, on the world.\n\nHere are their stories.\n\nDeHart Hubbard, long jump\n\nDeHart Hubbard leaped into the Olympic record books in 1924 as the first Black athlete to win an individual gold medal.\n\nThe Avondale native was well known in the neighborhood for his speed and athleticism.\n\nRobert Crawford, who attended the same all-Black Douglass School in Walnut Hills as Hubbard, told the Enquirer in 1996: “To us kids, DeHart was Superman. Still is, really. People have heard of Jesse Owens. They know Carl Lewis. But before Jesse, before Lewis, there was DeHart Hubbard.”\n\nAt Walnut Hills High School, Hubbard excelled at several sports but faced opposition.\n\nIn that 1996 Enquirer story, his teammate George Mason recalled a carload of men arriving at football practice to tell the only African-American player that he was ineligible. The team unanimously decided if Hubbard couldn’t play, none of them would play and they sat out the season.\n\nThe Cincinnati Enquirer had a hand in sending Hubbard to college. The newspaper held a contest awarding scholarships to the students who sold the most subscriptions. Hubbard placed in the top 10 with the help of Michigan alum Lon Berringer, who contacted his fellow Wolverines to buy Enquirer subscriptions.\n\nAt the University of Michigan, Hubbard concentrated on track. His best event was the long jump, and the university had to extend the long-jump pit beyond 25 feet to accommodate his leaps.\n\nHe qualified for the 1924 Summer Olympics in Paris with high hopes. Just before departing for Europe, Hubbard wrote to his family: “I’m going to do my best to be the FIRST COLORED OLYMPIC CHAMPION.”\n\nHis jump in the Olympic finals wasn’t his best (24 feet, 5.25 inches), but it was enough to win the gold and make history. The next year Hubbard set the world record for long jump (25 feet, 10.75 inches), which stood for three years.\n\nHubbard worked for the Cincinnati Recreation Commission, and in 1937 started the Cincinnati Tigers, a Negro League baseball team. He moved to Cleveland in 1941 to be the racial relations advisor to the Federal Housing Authority and passed away in 1976.\n\nWalter Laufer, swimming\n\nWalter Laufer and Harry Glancy were teammates on Cincinnati’s much-heralded Central YMCA swim team that trained at the Central Parkway YMCA and ruled the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) in the 1920s. Both swimmers went on to win gold medals in the Olympics.\n\nGlancy was part of the 800-meter freestyle relay team in the Paris games in 1924. Laufer was on the team that won the same event in the 1928 games in Amsterdam. A teammate on both of those champion teams was Johnny Weissmuller, the five-time gold medalist who went on to star as Tarzan on the silver screen.\n\nThroughout the 1920s, Laufer and Weissmuller were each other’s chief rival. As Weissmuller rewrote the record books, Laufer was constantly on his heels, sort of the Ryan Lochte to Weissmuller’s Michael Phelps.\n\nAs a student at Hyde Park’s East High School (which became Withrow), Laufer set numerous local swim records. He made a name for himself at the AAU Nationals in 1924 and 1925. Then, at the 1926 AAU meet in Chicago, he had one of the best Nationals swimming performances ever.\n\nHe won the pentathlon, a test of the best all-around swimmer in five events – 100 meters in backstroke, freestyle, and breaststroke, 500-meter freestyle and diving – with only a five-minute rest between each. Glancy was close behind in second place. Laufer individually scored more points than any other team.\n\nThe pentathlon was discontinued shortly after, so no one will ever quite dominate the AAU Nationals the way Laufer did.\n\nDuring a European tour in 1926, Laufer set world records in the 100-meter and 200-meter backstroke, and competed in 21 cities in 23 days, yet lost only one race, according to the website Sports Reference.\n\nHe also toured Hawaii and Japan and filmed underwater scenes for the classic Douglas Fairbanks swashbuckler, “The Black Pirate.”\n\nWhen he competed in the Olympics in 1928, conditions were quite a bit different than today. The entire U.S. team stayed onboard their ocean liner throughout the games.\n\n“They had a track on the deck for horses,” Laufer recalled to the Enquirer in 1972. “The boxers worked out on a ring on the top deck. The bicyclists used the same track the runners ran on.” As a reminder that sometimes things aren't so different from conditions in Rio today, the swimming team started training in Amsterdam’s canals, but they were filthy. “It didn’t last long,” Laufer said.\n\nLaufer also took home silver in the 100-meter backstroke.\n\nHe then settled in Cincinnati until his death in 1984. He is buried in Spring Grove Cemetery.\n\nLaufer remained modest about his accomplishments. “I didn’t lead an interesting life,” he told the Enquirer in 1970. “It’s hard for me to think of something that I did which people today might think outstanding.”\n\nJohn Anderson, discus throw\n\nLike Hubbard, John F. Anderson was a super athlete. At Hughes High School in Clifton Heights, Anderson starred on Ed “Red” Krueck’s football team and also lettered in basketball, track and tennis.\n\nHe was an All-American tackle on Cornell University’s football team. While in track, he focused on discus and shot put, winning the AAU Nationals in the discus for three years.\n\nAnderson qualified for the 1928 Olympics in the discus throw and came in fifth place. At the 1932 Olympics held in Los Angeles, Anderson threw the discus 162 feet, 4 inches, establishing an Olympic record and winning the gold.\n\nAnderson was the beneficiary of someone else's bad luck. During the discus competition, Jules Noël of France reportedly threw beyond Anderson’s record throw, but all of the judges were distracted by the heated pole vault event occurring nearby and none of them saw Noël’s discus land. Embarrassed, the judges allowed Noël to throw again, but he couldn’t duplicate his feat and he went home without a medal.\n\nIt was Anderson who returned as an Olympic hero. Cincinnati mayor Russell Wilson proclaimed “John Anderson Day” and declared that the Olympian represented “the best in American manhood, physically, mentally, and morally.”\n\nDescribed in The Enquirer as “one of the most formidable exponents of athletics ever to compete in any event,” the handsome, blond-haired giant won a few bit parts in movies but then moved back to Glendale.\n\nThough he was from a prominent Cincinnati family, Anderson left a job in advertising at Procter & Gamble, where his father was vice president, to teach math and coach at a California prep school, according to his obituary.\n\nIn the Navy during World War II, Anderson achieved the rank of lieutenant commander and served as a transport navigator in the Pacific.\n\nAfter the war, he used his training to work as a navigator for a fleet of fishing boats in Alaska. In 1948, while on an excursion to Naknek, 300 miles from Anchorage, Anderson died suddenly of a blood clot on the brain at the age of 41. He is also buried in Spring Grove."
