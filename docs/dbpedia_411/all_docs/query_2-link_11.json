        "text": "Soccer, also known as football, is loved, played, and watched by millions worldwide. It brings people together, ignites passion, and showcases incredible skill and teamwork. Soccer is widely known for its popularity in the FIFA World Cup and, time after time has viewers from all over the globe cheering on the competing athletes.\n\nOlympic soccer follows a traditional 11-a-side format, played on a full-sized field, and features both men’s and women’s competitions. Each soccer game is 90 minutes, with halftime at minute 45 and a chance to extend to overtime if the game ends in a tie at 90 minutes. A team wins if they score more goals than their opponent’s team. To score a goal, a soccer player from one team must kick the soccer ball into the goal past the opposing team’s goalie.\n\nThe U.S.A. men’s and women’s Olympic soccer teams have made an impression in the Olympic games with their athleticism, tenacity, and drive. However, the women’s national Olympic soccer team has dominated the Olympic medal count with an impressive collection of 4 gold medals (1996, 2004, 2008, 2012) and 1 silver medal (2000). The men’s national soccer team brought home the bronze medal in the 1992 Olympic Games.\n\nWhile Olympic soccer captures the essence of national pride, 7-a-side soccer offers a different experience altogether. This format is specifically designed for players with disabilities, allowing them to showcase their skills and compete at the highest level.\n\nThis version of soccer, featuring teams of seven players on the field, was a Paralympic sport from 1984 to 2016. It was first included in the Paralympic Games in 1984 in New York. Still, it was removed from the program after the 2016 Rio Games due to concerns about insufficient development and participation, particularly among women.\n\nWhile Paralympic 7-a-side soccer is no longer an official sport at the Olympic Games, it used to be a thrilling and unique competition, so here are some fun facts to remember it by:"
