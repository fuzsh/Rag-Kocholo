They both can become the first Americans to win an Olympic title in the sport since 1996.\n\nThis will be Ellison's fifth Olympic Games. He won silver at the 2012 and 2016 Games and also collected a bronze medal in 2016. For Kaufhold, this will be her second Olympic Games. Jennifer Mucino-Fernandez is also making her return to the Olympic Games. The full roster can be seen below.\n\nMen\n\nBrady Ellison\n\nWomen\n\nCasey Kaufhold\n\nJennifer Mucino-Fernandez\n\nCatalina Gnoriega\n\nCompared to its 2020 Games roster, the U.S. earned two fewer quota places for the 2024 Games. At the Tokyo Games, the U.S. was able to field a men's and women's team, but this time around, they are only able to field a women's team.\n\nJack Williams, who failed to earn a quota spot at the World Cup Stage 3 in Turkey, and Jacob Wukie will not be returning to the Olympics. As for the women, Mackenzie Brown will not return to the Games."
