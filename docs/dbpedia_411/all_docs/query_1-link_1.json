        "text": "Turkish Idol\n\nTurkish weightlifter Naim Suleymanoglu became the first weightlifter in history to win three consecutive Olympic titles. \"When he eats at a restaurant, nobody asks him to pay the bill; if he breaks the speed limit, he does not get fined, and the police wish him a pleasant journey,\" wrote a Turkish journalist.\n\nNOCs: 197\n\nAthletes: 10,318 (3,512 women, 6,806 men)\n\nEvents: 271\n\nVolunteers: 47,466\n\nMedia: 15,108 media (5,695 written press, 9,413 broadcasters)\n\nThe Vote\n\nDuring the 96th IOC Session in September 1990 in Tokyo, International Olympic Committee members voted in the final round for Atlanta (51 votes) over Athens (35 votes).\n\nThe Medals\n\nAthletes from a record-breaking 79 countries won medals and 53 countries won gold medals.\n\nTennis\n\nTennis player Virag Csurgo (HUN) was entered in the doubles event only. On the morning of 24 July, she was helping a team-mate to warm up when she was informed that one of the singles entrants had failed to appear and Csurgo could take her place if she showed up for the first round match which was to begin in five minutes' time. Wearing her practice shorts and a t-shirt, Csurgo hurried over to the court and actually won the match.\n\nWrestling\n\nIn the second round of the middleweight (82kg) freestyle wrestling tournament, Elmadi Jabrailov of Kazakhstan faced Lucman Jabrailov of Moldova. The two were brothers from Chechnya, but chose not to represent Russia because of its war against their homeland. Elmadi won the high-scoring but unusually friendly encounter by 10 points to 8.\n\nThe Professionals are Admitted\n\nProfessionals were admitted to the cycling events.\n\nFor Women Only\n\nA women-only sport was introduced: softball.\n\nProfessionals in Football\n\nEach team that qualified for the football tournament was allowed to include three professionals, regardless of age or olympic experience.\n\nElimination of Demonstration Sports\n\nSome demonstration sports were included in various editions of the Olympic Games up until 1992. The Organising Committees for the Olympic Games (OCOGs) could integrate demonstration sports into the Olympic programme. However, the organisation of these demonstrations created a lot of extra work for the OCOGs, which had to provide services that were almost identical to those for the sports on the Olympic programme. Therefore, at the 95th Session of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), held in 1989 in Puerto Rico, it was decided that demonstration sports would be eliminated definitively from the 1996 Atlanta Games onwards.\n\nCeremonies\n\nCelebration in the Olympic Stadium for the Centenary Games.\n\nOfficial Opening of the Games by:\n\nPresident Bill Clinton\n\nLighting the Olympic Flame by:\n\nMuhammad Ali (boxing)\n\nOlympic Oath by:\n\nTeresa Edwards (basketball)\n\nOfficials' Oath by:\n\nHobie Billingsly (diving)"
