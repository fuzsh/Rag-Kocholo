        "text": "Archery first appeared at the 1900 Olympics in Paris. There were archery events for the next few Olympics, but then it disappeared from the Olympic program for more than 50 years. It reappeared at Munich in 1972 and has remained a fixture of the Olympics ever since.\n\nEarly archery competitions varied in format. Since 1988, there have been men's and women's individual and team events.\n\nArchery at the Paris 2024 Olympics\n\nThe current Olympic archery competition consists of five medal events: men's individual, women's individual, men's team, and women's team, and the mixed team recurve returning after its debut in Tokyo. In all events, the distance from the archer to the target is 70 meters.\n\nmen's individual\n\nwomen's individual\n\nmen's team\n\nwomen's team\n\nmixed team recurve\n\nArchery Trivia\n\nThe best all-time performing archer at the Olympic Games is Hubert Van Innis of Belgium, who won six gold medals between 1900 and 1920.
