U.S. archers have competed in every Olympic event since the sport’s second appearance in 1904, and every Paralympic event since those Games began in 1960.

The Olympic Games has competition for men’s and women’s individual and team events, while the mixed team event was added to the program in 2020. The Paralympic Games has men’s and women’s individual competition and the mixed team event for recurve open, compound open and W1 classes.

Butch Johnson is among Team USA’s most experienced Olympic archers, competing in five Olympic Games between 1992 and 2008. Olympian Lida Howell won three golds in 1904 St. Louis and Paralympian Jack Whitman claimed gold in Tokyo 1960 to become the first U.S. champions. Andre Shelby became both the first Navy veteran and the first Black athlete to medal in Paralympic archery, when he won gold at Rio 2016.

In celebration of Father’s Day, we look at more than 50 U.S. Olympian fathers whose children also competed for Team USA.

The first Black American archer to compete at the Paralympic Games, he was seeded 12th in the compound open tournament at Rio 2016 but captured the gold medal.
