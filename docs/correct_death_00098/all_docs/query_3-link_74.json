Sir Robert Gordon Menzies, KT, AK, CH, QC, FAA, FRS, also known as 'Bob' Menzies, or 'Pig-Iron Bob',[1][2] [3] was Australia's longest serving Prime Minister; he held the position for a total of 18 years and five months.\n\nEarly in his first period in office, he announced the declaration of the Second World War to the people of Australia. In 1944 he helped start the Liberal Party, which in terms of winning elections, has been the most successful party in federal politics. He presided over Australia's longest period of prosperity and rising living standards this century.\n\nRobert Gordon Menzies was born in Jeparit, Victoria, on 20 December 1894,[4] the fourth of five children of Australian-born parents James Menzies, storekeeper, and his wife Kate, née Sampson. The forebears were Scots on the paternal side and Cornish on the maternal. Kate, of Cornish descent, was the daughter of a miners' union leader.\n\nThough lacking much formal education themselves, Menzies' parents were anxious that their children should have the best that could be afforded. Thus the eldest four-Les, Frank, Belle and Bob-were sent in turn to Ballarat's Humffray Street State School, boarding with their father's redoubtable Scots mother, the widowed Elizabeth. Bob did best, topping the State scholarship examination in 1907, and studying in consequence for two years at Grenville College, a Ballarat private school. It opened the way to another scholarship, which Menzies took at Wesley College, Melbourne. Success there won him an exhibition to the University of Melbourne (LL.B., 1916; LL.M., 1918). He was admitted as a barrister in 1918, built up a highly successful practice and became the youngest Kings Counsel in Victoria in 1929.\n\nHe married Pattie Maie Leckie in 1920,[5] and they had three children.\n\nHe was a member of the Victorian State Parliament (1928-34), serving as Deputy Premier and Attorney General (1932-4). Elected to Federal Parliament in 1934, he was immediately appointed Attorney General, until becoming Prime Minister on the eve of World War II in 1939. Reduced to minority government after the 1940 election, he was forced to resign as Prime Minister and party leader in August 1941. He launched a new party, the Liberal Party, in 1944, and won the 1949 election, the first of seven election victories. He retired in January 1966.\n\nExtract from Australian Dictionary of Biography\n\nQueen Elizabeth II appointed him K.T. (1963), and when (Sir) Harold (Baron) Wilson nominated him to succeed Churchill as constable of Dover Castle and warden of the Cinque Ports (1965), ceremonial titles which gave him a uniform and a residence at Walmer Castle. He had been appointed a privy counsellor in 1937 and C.H. in 1951. Among many additional awards and distinctions, he was appointed to the U.S. Legion of Merit in 1950.\n\nSir Robert died on 15 May 1978.[6]\n\nA portrait of him by Ivor Hele won the Archibald Prize in 1954.\n\nDNA\n\nAs at 10 September 2019, no DNA testers are currently shown on this page.
