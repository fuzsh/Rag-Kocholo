        "text": "There could be no better place to house this prestigious Institute than the Old Quad, the historic heart of the University of Melbourne’s main campus, where Sir Robert honed his philosophy of public life as a student more than a century ago.\n\nForty-nine years after his graduation ceremony, his public life ended at the university where he served as Chancellor from 1967 to 1972.\n\nThe university is already home to Sir Robert Menzies’ personal book collection, notebooks and memorabilia.\n\nThe Institute will:\n\nCurate Sir Robert’s papers, books and other significant items including 3,800 items already held by the University.\n\nCreate a digital hub for researchers.\n\nHost visits by schools and develop curricula.\n\nBecome a centre for research into Australian liberal democracy with a series of visiting professors.\n\nOrganise public lectures, discussions and exhibitions.\n\nRenovations of the East Wing of the University Quad, where the RMI will be housed, is expected to be completed in the second half of 2021. In the meantime the Institute has established a temporary office in the West Wing.\n\nThe establishment of the institute will ensure that Sir Robert’s accomplishments and the philosophy behind them is more widely understood. There will be a particular focus on his dedication to higher education and the reforms that extended the opportunity of enrolment to every Australian."
