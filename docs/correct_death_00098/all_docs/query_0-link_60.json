        "text": "The same year also saw the introduction of the world’s first mobile telephone, the first Space Invaders computer game, the first test-tube baby and the first Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras. International terrorism also came to Australia for the first time when three people died in an explosion outside the Hilton Hotel in Sydney during the Commonwealth Heads of Government Regional Meeting. The bomb was aimed at the Indian prime minister, who escaped unharmed, but it ushered in a new era of policing and pushed national security to the forefront.\n\nMenzies era ends\n\nMenzies’ death in May 1978 came at a significant moment. He had come to power in 1949 as the nation struggled to recover from the personal horrors and economic hardships induced by World War II. He had presided over a nation yearning for peace, quiet, stability and family life built on a quarter-acre suburban block. He had managed to deliver the electorate much of what it wanted, at least on the domestic front, although there was little he could do to ease the gloomy threat of nuclear war that hung over the heads of the post-war generation.\n\nBut Menzies’ brand of economic, cultural and social conservatism had been increasingly rejected by the electorate through the 1960s and 70s. Australia had been transformed by the awakening of the youth revolution.\n\nIn Britain, Labour prime minister Jim Callaghan was enduring his “winter of discontent” as strikes strangled the nation, garbage piled up in the streets and the dead remained unburied. The stage was set for the election of Margaret Thatcher and the beginning of her new brand of politics, centred on breaking the power of the collective and empowering the individual.\n\nIn Rome, pope Paul VI died and was replaced by Italian Albino Luciani. Thirty-three days later he, too, died and at another Vatican conclave the Pole Karol Wojtyla broke tradition by becoming the first non-Italian pope in centuries.\n\nFraser government\n\nWhile The Australian reported all the world’s major events, it continued to be immersed in national politics as the newly re-elected government of Malcolm Fraser wrestled with continued inflation, struggled to contain the power of unions and engaged in intense internal debates about the balance between taxation and spending.\n\nThis was the year that also saw the emergence of John Howard as a political force. As treasurer in the second Fraser government he argued for fiscal conservatism, driven by the need to repair the budget after the era of Whitlam profligacy. Most of his enemies were within — ministers demanding more, not less, spending for their portfolios.\n\nWielding influence\n\nLes Hollings was in his third year as editor of The Australian, growing in confidence and now flying solo without an editor-in-chief. I left News Limited to join Kerry Packer’s magazine publishing company in 1978 and Geraldine Paton took over as The Australian’s publisher.\n\nIn his National Library oral history, recorded in 1997, Hollings provides an insight into his influence on the course of national politics. Most editors are content to let their editorial columns do their talking, whether it be proposing changes to policy or commenting on current events. Hollings had a much more activist approach and agrees in his interview that he “fought battles” for Fraser.\n\nHe recounts a meeting with the PM in early 1977 when he urged the government to tackle tax reform in its August budget. Fraser did so, bringing down the tax rate for most taxpayers.\n\nDuring the 1977 election campaign Fraser trumpeted his low-tax policies but early in 1978, safely re-elected, began to worry about his capacity to deliver without inducing imprudent deficit levels. A temporary tax of 1.5 per cent was introduced and, in the lead-up to an autumn mini-budget, signals emerged that Fraser was preparing to lift it to 2 per cent and make it permanent.\n\n“Naturally, The Australian didn’t think much of this,” Hollings says. “We had got our tax reform and it was terrific, and he won the election on it, and now here we were with a temporary tax surcharge … which was going to be made permanent.\n\n“I thought we ought to fight this so I did an editorial right across the top of the front page, talking about the government going off the rails and so forth. Not content with that, the next day I did it again, right across the top of the page.”\n\nHollings flew to Canberra for the mini-budget and was invited to Fraser’s office. “He started by giving me figures on how many public servants he had cut off the payroll to demonstrate his commitment to smaller government,” Hollings says. “When it was my turn to speak I said, ‘Look, Prime Minister, I believed in you. I believed that you did believe in lower taxation, smaller government and a fair society. But tomorrow you are going to tell the people that they’ve got you wrong; that you don’t believe in a fair society, smaller government and lower taxation. You are a fraud!’”\n\nHollings says he left the office with nothing resolved, but as he waited for a copy of the public service figures, “Fraser came out of his office and bellowed at the top of his voice, ‘Get me the Treasurer.’ John Howard came steaming by. I hung on for the mini-budget lock-up the following day and the temporary tax surcharge was still a temporary tax. It had not been raised.\n\n“It is my belief that it was the campaign by The Australian that at least stopped that temporary tax surcharge being made permanent and if some of the other speculation was right, it also prevented it from being increased.”\n\nAlthough Rupert opposed me, he never stopped me – and he never stopped telling me I was wrong\n\nGST dropped\n\nHollings also claimed influence in having Howard’s plans for a broadbased goods and services tax abandoned. “I thought a GST was the wrong philosophy,” he says. “I ran a very strong campaign against Howard. Rupert Murdoch was on a visit from London and he said the (British) value added tax was terrific and we should copy it. I told him I disagreed and was running a campaign against Howard. Although Rupert opposed me, he never stopped me — and he never stopped telling me I was wrong.”\n\nHoward dropped his GST plans. Hollings says Paul Keating’s option C plan for a similar tax was also shelved in 1985 because the government feared another campaign by The Australian.\n\n“In hindsight, I would have to say that Rupert was right and I was wrong,” Hollings says. “But I ran a campaign for what I believed in. I ran it as vigorously as I could. I think that is what a newspaper has to do — you have to campaign on what you believe in.\n\n“It doesn’t matter so much whether the editor is right or wrong, but for goodness sake, let us have the debates. We certainly raised the temperature on a whole range of vital national issues.”"
