        "text": "THE former Prime\n\nMinister, Sir\n\nRobert Menzies, last\n\nnight in Melbourne\n\ndescribed Mr Holt's\n\npresumed death as a\n\n\"terrible tragedy and\n\na very great loss to\n\nAustralia\".\n\nSir Robert said, \"One is re-\n\nluctant to despair but it is\n\nonly realistic to think there is\n\nvery little hope now.\n\n\"Harold Holt devoted, by\n\nfar, the greatest part of his\n\nadult life to the service of his\n\ncountry.\n\n\"He gained very extensive\n\nparliamentary experience —\n\nmuch of it as a Minister of the\n\nGovernment and later as\n\nPrime Minister.\n\n\"He had great ability and\n\nintegrity which, anyone who\n\nknew him, would never have\n\nquestioned.\n\n\"That his services should be\n\nprematurely lost is sad for\n\nAustralia, his wife and family\n\nand for the thousands of men\n\nand women, like my wife and\n\nmyself, who knew him on a\n\npersonal basis\".\n\nThe Leader of the Opposi-\n\ntion, Mr Whitlam, said in\n\nSydney, \"I find it almost im-\n\npossible to express adequately\n\nmy sense of shock and grief\n\nat this news\".\n\nThe Anglican Primate of\n\nAustralia, Archbishop P. N.\n\nW. Strong, said in Brisbane,\n\n\"On behalf of the Church of\n\nEngland in Australia, I voice\n\na deep sense of sorrow and\n\ndismay at the tragedy which\n\nhas befallen our nation so sud-\n\ndenly, and deepest sympathy\n\nwith Mrs Holt, the members\n\nof the Prime Minister's family,\n\nhis colleagues, the Cabinet,\n\nand, indeed with the whole\n\nnation.\n\n\"If in fact Mr Holt is dead,\n\nthe nation, and the world have\n\nsuffered an irreparable loss.\n\n\"It is impossible to cal-\n\nculate what the loss of Mr\n\nHolt will mean to Australia at\n\nthis juncture of our history.\n\n\"He had become a highly\n\nrespected, and greatly\n\nhonoured world figure. By his\n\nvisits overseas, he has been\n\nperhaps the best ambassador\n\nAustralia has ever had, and\n\nhas certainly vastly improved\n\nthe image of our nation in the\n\nworld\".\n\nCardinal Gilroy issued a\n\nstatement in Sydney which\n\nread, \"With my fellow citizens,\n\nI feel deeply grieved at the\n\nsad news.\n\n\"Knowing that Mr Holt was\n\na man of piety, I feel certain\n\nthat Mrs Holt and the family\n\nwould appreciate the fact that\n\nwe of the Catholic Church\n\nare united with them in\n\nprayer\".\n\nThe NSW Governor, Sir\n\nRoden Cutler, commented in\n\nSydney last night, \"There\n\nwould not be a single person\n\nwho would not be happy for\n\nnews of Mr Holt's safety\".\n\nThe Premier, Mr Askin,\n\nsaid in a statement, \"If we\n\nhave lost our Prime Minister\n\neverybody in Australia is the\n\npoorer.\n\n\"Nobody in our history has\n\nlaboured more to create\n\ngreater understanding and\n\ngoodwill between Australia\n\nand her Pacific neighbours\".\n\nThe Victorian Premier, Sir\n\nHenry Bolte, said in Mel-\n\nbourne that all Victorians\n\nshared with Mrs Holt and her\n\nfamily their great anxiety.\n\n\"Let us not give up hope\n\nthat he will be found and\n\nalive\", Sir Henry added.\n\nThe Acting Premier of\n\nQueensland, Mr Chalk, said in\n\nBrisbane the news \"has\n\nstunned the nation and will\n\ncause profound sorrow and re-\n\ngret in many overseas capitals\n\nwhere Mr Holt was highly res-\n\npected for his own ability and\n\nintegrity as well as his en-\n\nlightened leadership of Aus-\n\ntralia\".\n\nThe Western Australian\n\nPremier, Mr Brand, said in\n\nPerth, today, \"Harold Holt\n\nwas a man of absolute honesty\n\nand sincerity who had the\n\ncharacteristics for a notable\n\ncareer.\n\n\"He had the stamina for\n\nleadership and a great quality\n\nfor making you feel you could\n\ngo to him if you needed to do\n\nso\".\n\nThe Premier, Mr Dunstan,\n\nsaid in Adelaide that for any\n\nnation to lose its leader in such\n\ntragic circumstances, it must\n\nbe a great blow to the coun-\n\ntry.\n\nThe Tasmanian Premier, Mr\n\nReece, said in Hobart, \"This\n\nnews comes as a profound per-\n\nsonal shock. The Tasmanian\n\ncommunity would want to join\n\nwith me in expressing pro-\n\nfound regret to Mrs Holt\".\n\nThe Dean of the Diplomatic\n\nCorps, Mr M. Ezpeleta, Am-\n\nbassador of the Philippines,\n\nsaid in Canberra, \"He is one\n\nof the hardest working chiefs\n\nof Government I know. We\n\nhope that he will be saved\".\n\nThe United States Ambas-\n\nsador, Mr Ed Clark, issued the\n\nfollowing statement:\n\n\"I cannot express how dis-\n\ntressed and shocked Mrs\n\nClark and I are at the news of\n\nour dear and personal friend\n\nthe Prime Minister, Mr Holt's\n\ndisappearance\".\n\nThe Federal president of the\n\nLiberal Party of Australia,\n\nBrigadier J. E. Pagan, in Mit-\n\ntagong said, \"We pray that he\n\nwill be found safe. This is a\n\nterrible, tragic and frightful\n\noccasion\".\n\n\"I was speaking to the\n\nPrime Minister by telephone\n\nyesterday. He told mc there\n\nwas a bad tide and a bad wind\n\nat Portsea.\n\n\"It turned out to be a bad\n\ntide and a bad wind for Aus-\n\ntralia\".\n\nSpeaking in Sydney on be-\n\nhalf of the Jewish people,\n\nRabbi Dr Israel Porusch said,\n\n\"The Australian Jewish com-\n\nmunity is deeply shocked and\n\ngrieved bv the frightening\n\nnews about our Prime\n\nMinister.\n\n\"Many a member ot my\n\nsynagogue has offered silent\n\nprayer for his safety and we\n\nall hope against hope that the\n\nworst did not happen\".\n\nMr Wilson shocked\n\nIN London a spokesman said\n\nthe Prime Minister, Mr\n\nWilson, was \"shocked and dis-\n\ntressed\" at the news.\n\nThe Leader of the Opposi-\n\ntion Conservative Party, Mr\n\nHeath, said: \"I am deeply\n\nshocked to hear that Mr Holt\n\nis missing and may have lost\n\nhis life\".\n\nThe Australian High Com-\n\nmissioner in London, Sir\n\nAlexander Downer, said, \"I\n\nam shocked and greatly dis-\n\ntressed\".\n\nA Buckingham Palace\n\nspokesman confirmed later\n\nthat the Queen and Prince\n\nPhilip had been informed of\n\nMr Holt's \"tragic dis-\n\nappearance\".\n\nObservers in the security-\n\nconscious US — where the\n\nSecret Service maintains vir-\n\ntually a 24-hour watch on the\n\nPresident and even members\n\nof his family — found it hard\n\nto believe that an Australian\n\nPrime Minister would be left\n\nout of sight.\n\nin Washington President\n\nJohnson, who once described\n\nMr Holt as \"my favourite\n\nPrime Minister\" was shocked\n\nat the news.\n\nMr Holt was regarded as\n\none of the President's\n\nstaunchest allies and one of his\n\nbest friends.\n\nThe White House and the\n\nState Department sent urgent\n\ncables to the US Embassy in\n\nCanberra asking for further\n\ninformation.\n\nPresident Johnson had ex-\n\npected to see Mr Holt later\n\nthis year at a summit confer-\n\nence of Vietnam allies. But\n\nthe summit was postponed —\n\nprobably until March — for a\n\nnumber of reasons. One was\n\nthe installation of a new gov-\n\nernment in Saigon.\n\nIn Wellington, the New\n\nZealand Prime Minister, Mr\n\nHolyoake, was anxiously await-\n\ning further news last night.\n\nThe Singapore Prime Minis-\n\nter, Mr Lee Kuan Yew, was\n\ninformed during the after-\n\nnoon.\n\nHis liaison officer, Mr Li\n\nVei Chen, said the Prime\n\nMinister's office was presently\n\ntrying to contact the Austra-\n\nlian High Commission to gain\n\nmore details.\n\nThe Secretary-General of\n\nthe Commonwealth Secre-\n\ntariat in London, Mr Arnold\n\nSmith of Canada, said, in a\n\nstatement, \"Mr Holt's death\n\nwould be a tragic loss for\n\nAustralia and the Common-\n\nwealth, where his open-minded\n\nand phlegmatic approach to\n\nproblems has been invaluable.\n\nHe will be seriously missed\".\n\nIN March, 1966, Mr Holt\n\nannounced that the Aus-\n\ntralian battalion in South Viet-\n\nnam would be increased to a\n\ntask force, and Vietnam be-\n\ncame the great issue of the\n\nyear for the general election\n\ndue in November. The Coun-\n\ntry Party lost the Dawson by-\n\nelection to Labor in Queens-\n\nland, but the Liberals com-\n\nfortably retained Sir Robert's\n\nold seat of Kooyong in a by-\n\nclection.\n\nThen came the first of the\n\nHolt trips to Asia and in June\n\nand July to London and Wash-\n\nington and the famous \"All\n\nthe way with LBJ\" utterance.\n\nBy October, Vietnam fever\n\nin Australia was reaching a\n\npitch with demonstrations and\n\nprotests and flat ALP opposi-\n\ntion to the war. Into this situa-\n\ntion Harold Holt dropped the\n\nbombshell of the announce-\n\nment that President Johnson\n\nwas to visit Australia, the\n\nfirst such visit by an American\n\nPresident in office.\n\nIt was a great success, as\n\neverybody remembers, despite\n\nrumblings offstage about in-\n\nterference in domestic elec-\n\ntions. Mr Holt went off to a\n\nManila summit on Vietnam,\n\nand returned to one of the\n\nmost violent election cam-\n\npaigns in the history of fed-\n\neration.\n\nHe campaigned in the face\n\nof wild and sometimes vicious\n\ndemonstrations. At Rockdale\n\nin Sydney one night demon-\n\nstrators spat on him; he was\n\njostled and shoved in a seeth-\n\ning crowd and his car was\n\nalmost overturned. The result\n\nwas a record majority in his\n\nown right. Harold Holt had\n\nreached the peak.\n\nCONTINUED\n\nON PAGE 5\n\nSTRAIN SHOWED\n\nCONTINUED FROM PAGE 2\n\nThe election, had, however,\n\nbeen fought on a minimum of\n\ndomestic promises; it was fol-\n\nlowed by only a few changes\n\nin an increasingly uninspired\n\nMinistry, and there seemed to\n\nbe a lack of purpose in the\n\nGovernment's domestic do-\n\nings.\n\nIn that first year Harold\n\nHolt had travelled 125,000\n\nmiles. Despite his remarkable\n\nphysical fitness for a man of\n\nhis age, he was looking his\n\nage under the pressure of long\n\nhours and decisions.\n\nIn February he went to New\n\nZealand for the first visit there\n\nby an Australian Prime Minis-\n\nter since 1954. In the same\n\nmonth came the event which\n\nwas to have greater and\n\ngreater effect as the year pro-\n\ngressed — the election of\n\nGough Whitlam to the Labor\n\nleadership.\n\nAgainst Arthur Calwell and\n\na divided ALP Harold Holt's\n\ntask had not been so difficult\n\nat home, and he had concen-\n\ntrated on foreign affairs to the\n\npoint where he had even been\n\naccused of usurping the func-\n\ntions of the External Affairs\n\nMinister, Paul Hasluck.\n\nBut as Mr Whitlam began\n\nto draw the threads of Labor\n\nunity slowly together during\n\n1967, so the Holt Govern-\n\nment began to appear less im-\n\npressive.\n\nMr Holt was appointed a\n\nCompanion of the Order of\n\nthe Companions of Honour in\n\nJune, 1967.\n\nIn March he went on his\n\nsuccessful visit to Cambodia,\n\nLaos, Taiwan and South\n\nKorea. Meanwhile the effect\n\nof the Government's minority\n\nin the Senate began to show\n\nin minor defeats for Govern-\n\nment measures.\n\nMay was a bad month. The\n\nSenate referendum was\n\nsoundly thrown out by the\n\nelectors and in the same month\n\nthe Government seriously mis-\n\ncalculated the political effects\n\nof its decision to increase pos-\n\ntal charges to the tune of $67\n\nmillion a year, although there\n\nhad been no mention of this\n\nin its official blueprint for\n\nfuture action, the Governor-\n\nGeneral's opening speech to\n\nParliament.\n\nBy June it was clear that\n\nBritain intended heavy defence\n\nwithdrawals from Malaysia\n\nand Singapore, a decision\n\nfraught with defence implica-\n\ntions for Australia. In Vietnam\n\nthe war continued to escalate.\n\nAt home, the Premiers beat\n\nthe drum of breakdown in\n\nCommonwealth-State financial\n\nrelations and the drought con-\n\ntinued.\n\nIn July the shock of the\n\nCorio by-election loss came\n\non top of Britain's final an-\n\nnouncement that she would,\n\nin fact, withdraw from east\n\nof Suez sooner than the Gov-\n\nernment had publicly ad-\n\nmitted.\n\nOver those winter months\n\nother political storm clouds\n\nhad been gathering. Electoral\n\nredistribution and some funda-\n\nmental questioning of the pro-\n\ntective tariff, involv not\n\nvery well-concealed differ-\n\nences between the Country\n\nParty Leader, Mr McEwen\n\nand the Treasurer, Mr\n\nMcMahon, occurred. The\n\nGovernment had also to face\n\nthe long-term defence and\n\nforeign policy questions posed\n\nby the British withdrawal.\n\nIn the Senate, the VIP air-\n\ncraft controversy — probably\n\na minor matter in itself —\n\nwas brewing, finally to mush-\n\nroom into a fullscale embar-\n\nrassment for the Prime Minis-\n\nter as it was allowed to drag\n\non without final and clear ex-\n\nplanations.\n\nWith the Senate election\n\nonly a few weeks off, the VIP\n\naffair dominated the last days\n\nof the Parliamentary session.\n\nFinally it came to the point\n\nof Mr Howson, the Minister\n\nfor Air, offering his resigna-\n\ntion, which Harold Holt re-\n\nfused.\n\nThis VIP controversy de-\n\nmonstrated the unsure grip of\n\nthe Government. Last-minute\n\ndecisions were announced on\n\nimportant irrigation schemes\n\nin Western Australia and\n\nQueensland, Mr McEwen was\n\nabsent from Australia, and the\n\nelection campaign developed\n\ninto a Whitlam-Holt confron-\n\ntation.\n\nDuring the campaign Mr\n\nHolt displayed several un-\n\naccustomed flashes of irrita-\n\ntion in public. In private he\n\ncomplained of a back ailment\n\nwhich made it necessary for\n\nhim to take sleeping tablets to\n\nget respite from the pain that\n\ntroubled him.\n\nMr Holt arid the sport he loved best.
