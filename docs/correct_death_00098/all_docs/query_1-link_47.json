However, he may be remembered by a contribution to Fellowship Hall (5140 Dunstan Road, Greensboro, NC 27405) or at https://www.fellowshiphall.com/contribute.php. A donation to any other life-saving organization would honor Robert’s legacy and commitment to serving others.\n\nRobert is survived by his beloved wife of 26 years, Cheryl Menzies, who was the light of his life; devoted parents, Priscilla and John Schuster, who chose to spend their retirement years with Robert and Cheryl in Greensboro; sister, Lexan O’Reilly who he loved dearly but couldn’t resist pushing her buttons; brother, Timothy Menzies, to whom he was the consummate big brother and eternal protector; and niece and nephew, Melissa and David Koenig with whom he shared his love of comfort food, baking and air cannons. Robert was also a devoted daddy to his three little furballs, Duff, Toby and Lisa.\n\nAll who knew Robert know that despite his imposing frame and gruff exterior, he was a softie who would give you the shirt off of his back. He was unfailingly generous beyond his means, and held all who were equally generous with their time, service or lives in the highest regard. He loved, he was loved, and he will be sorely missed."
