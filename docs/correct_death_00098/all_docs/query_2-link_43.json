The policy had broad support across the political spectrum for a variety of reasons. The Act introduced a dictation test to prevent the immigration of non-Europeans. The language test was required because the British Government was opposed to any direct mention of race, fearing it would offend non-white subjects of the Crown and her new ally, Japan.

Though a supporter of the war and, later, conscription, he does not enlist. It may be that his family decided having two of their eligible sons in the AIF was enough. His political enemies would later taunt him for not enlisting. Only two future Australian Prime Ministers served in the war, Stanley Bruce and Earle Page.\n\nWilliam Hughes becomes PM\n\nAndrew Fisher, worn out by ill health and the stress of party divisions, resigns.

Three weeks on the Western Front proves almost as expensive as the eight months on Gallipoli.\n\nFirst conscription referendum\n\nThe first conscription referendum is narrowly defeated. The debate reveals fault lines in Australian society based on class and religious denomination. The Labor Government is deeply divided.

The Australians experience 38,000 casualties.\n\nEgg thrown at Billy Hughes, leading to creation of Commonwealth Police\n\nEggs are thrown at the Prime Minister during a conscription rally. Hughes, enraged by what he saw as the inaction of the Queensland Police, later orders the creation of a Commonwealth Police Force, the predecessor to the Australian Federal Police.\n\nSecond conscription referendum fails\n\nThe AIF divisions in France are facing critical shortages of manpower, while enlistments are declining.
