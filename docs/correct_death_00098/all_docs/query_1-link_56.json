        "text": "The Rt Hon Sir Robert Gordon MENZIES, KT, AK, CH, FRS, QC was born in Jeparit, Victoria. Australia's longest serving prime minister, he was a barrister before being elected to the Victorian parliament in 1928.\n\nEntering federal parliament in 1934 as a member of the United Australia Party, he became Prime Minister in 1939 but resigned in 1941 because of dissatisfaction with his leadership.\n\nIn 1945 he formed a new Liberal Party which he led to victory in 1949, remaining Prime Minister until retirement in 1966.\n\nThe timeline is organised on three levels:\n\n(1) the life and times of Sir Robert Menzies;\n\n(2) people and events that shaped Australian history during that time; and\n\n(3) world events that took place during those years.\n\nLooking at the time line in any one year, the context of what was happening in Sir Robert's life, Australia and the world can be seen. For example, the year 1965 includes photographs of Sir Robert's appointment as Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports, photographs of anti-Vietnam war protests in Australia, and the death of Sir Winston Churchill in London, including a sound recording and transcript of Sir Robert Menzies' tribute broadcast from the crypt of St Paul's Cathedral.\n\nFurther information on Sir Robert's life and career can be found in this Menzies Virtual Museum and in:\n\nMartin, A.W. (1993) Robert Menzies: A Life, Vol 1, 1894-1943, Melbourne University Press, Melbourne.\n\nMartin, A.W. (1999) Robert Menzies: A Life, Vol 2, 1944-1978, Melbourne University Press, Melbourne.\n\nA more extensive bibliography can be found in:\n\nBunting, E.J.(1988) R.G. Menzies: A Portrait. Allen and Unwin, Sydney.\n\n(The Menzies Foundation has a small number of copies of this book which are available at a cost of $25.00 AUD, including postage.)\n\nSir Robert's own books include:"
