        "text": "Menzies managed to sell the party to Australians as non-sectional, and he also gave it its pragmatism. He realised, as he said, that the conservative forces had been too often in the position \"of the man who says 'no’.\"\n\nPerhaps Menzies' strongest personal trait was his ability to learn from his mistakes.\n\nWhen he was Prime Minister first, from April 1939 to August 1941, he failed disastrously, humiliatingly. He was unpopular with his colleagues and the people; he could not attain or hold the support of the Country Party.\n\nEventually he was forced to resign from the coalition's leadership, to be replaced by the Country Party's Arthur Fadden, whose government was quickly defeated in Parliament.\n\nA proud and imperious man, Menzies acknowledged years later: “I was still in that state of mind in which to be logical is to be right, and to be right is its own justification. I had yet to acquire the common touch ...\"\n\nHe never did acquire that touch, but transformed himself into a father figure, respected if not liked by colleagues, admired by the voters.\n\n\"Politicians, like athletes, seldom come back once they start to slide to oblivion. Menzies proved an exception,\" wrote veteran journalist, the late Don Whittington.\n\nHe overcame some early predictions that the new Liberal Party \"can't win with Menzies\", forged a strong Opposition, won Government in 1949, and built a lasting pact with the Country Party.\n\nSignificantly, at his final Press conference, Menzies named creation of the Liberal Party and maintenance of the CP alliance as the two achievements on the political side which gave him most satisfaction.\n\nWhen the Menzies Government is looked back on, perhaps its most remarkable feature will be its longevity.\n\nIt was a period of strong and stable rule, of some solid but few outstanding achievements.\n\nMenzies was a ruthless and skilled politician, but also had his share of luck.\n\nIn the Iate 1940s, Labor's unpopularity was indispensable to his return to power.\n\nIn 1954 his use of the Petrov defection was a combination of ingenuity, unscrupulousness and good timing which helped pull off a dicey election.\n\nIn 1961 his long-established Government held on by the barest one seat margin after bad economic decisions swung public support away.\n\nDisarray and bad leadership in the Labor Party of the 50s and 60s made Menzies' ability seem greatness, and the healthy, international and economic growth made government much easier than in the seventies.\n\nMenzies' total supremacy over his Government eventually did a disservice to the party he had fathered.\n\nHis first Prime Ministership made him determined to protect his own flank. Even when his authority was unquestioned, he encouraged or shunted out men of ability who might be rivals."
