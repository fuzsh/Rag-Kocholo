        "text": "(1894–1978). Lawyer and statesman Robert Menzies served two terms as prime minister of Australia—1939 to 1941 and 1949 to 1966. During his second term he helped promote mutual security ties with the United States through creation of the ANZUS alliance between Australia, New Zealand, and the United States in 1951. He also presided over the rapid growth of Australia’s economy in the 1950s.\n\nRobert Gordon Menzies was born in Jeparit, Victoria, on Dec. 20, 1894. He attended Wesley College and the University of Melbourne. After graduating in 1918 he went into law. He served in the state legislature from 1928 to 1934. In that year he was elected to the Australian Parliament, serving as attorney general until 1939, when, as leader of the United Australia party, he became prime minister. He was forced to resign in 1941, probably because of the role he played in mobilizing the country for World War II."
