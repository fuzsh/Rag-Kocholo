        "text": "The disappearance of Prime Minister Harold Holt will be remembered on Sunday.\n\nBut it was his appearance on the national stage in 1935 that heralded an extraordinary life in Australian politics.\n\nJust after turning 27, he won the Melbourne seat of Fawkner in a by-election, following the death of his United Australia Party colleague George Maxwell.\n\nHarold Holt entered Parliament under the wing of Robert Menzies but soon took flight on his own, advocating support for the League of Nations, the modernisation of divorce laws and tax exemptions for families.\n\nIt was the fallout of the first death of an Australian Prime Minister in office, Joseph Lyons, in 1939 that saw Harold Holt move into the first Menzies Ministry.\n\nHe worked alongside Richard Casey, the future Ambassador to the United States during World War II and Governor General in the 1960s.\n\nWith the outbreak of war in Europe and a change in political alliances in Australia, the 30-year-old Holt left the Menzies’s Ministry and joined the Australian Army in May 1940.\n\nHe remained a Member of Parliament while completing his artillery training at Puckapunyal and awaiting deployment overseas.\n\nBut fate intervened. On the 13th August 1940 in Canberra, a RAAF light bomber crashed killing all on board, including three Menzies Cabinet Ministers, in what is known as the Fairbairn Air Disaster.\n\nIt brought forward the Federal Election to September 1940. Referred to as “Gunner Holt” by the press, he won his seat comfortably but the Menzies Government was thrown into minority with the support of two independents.\n\nSworn in as the Minister for Labour and National Service, Holt had a strategic role in coordinating the war effort.\n\nHe recognised the need to give financial support to families during the downward adjustments to award wages during wartime.\n\nIt was Harold Holt’s lasting legacy that he introduced universal child endowment on behalf of the Menzies Government in early 1941.\n\nEven though he was praised as the Godfather to one million Australian children, his success could not save the Menzies or the United Australia Government.\n\nFirst Menzies was dumped by his party as Prime Minister and replaced with Arthur Fadden.\n\nThen 40 days later, in October 1941, the two independent Members of Parliament shifted their support behind the Australian Labor Party and John Curtin became Prime Minister.\n\nSwept from the Government benches for the first time in his career and the United Australia Party falling to bits, Holt followed Robert Menzies into the Liberal Party in 1945.\n\nWhen John Curtin became the second Prime Minister to die in office, in July 1945 it marked the half way point of eight years in Opposition.\n\nAt the 1949 election, the Liberal Party won Government for the first time.\n\nNow in the Melbourne seat of Higgins, Holt was sworn into Cabinet as the Minister for Labour, National Service and Immigration.\n\nIn the wave of post-war immigration, Holt increased the proportion of non-British migrants, extended the assisted-passage scheme to the non-British and added flexibility and humanity to hardship cases.\n\nHe also reformed the system of negotiation in wage and labour disputes with the creation of the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission which served Australia for a generation.\n\nWhen the position of deputy leader of the Liberal Party became vacant in 1956, Holt fought off two other contenders to become the heir apparent to Menzies.\n\nTwo years later, when Arthur Fadden retired, Harold Holt was sworn in as the nation’s Treasurer.\n\nBut he was blamed for the credit squeeze of 1960-61 and dipping the nation into recession. Holt described the period as the most difficult time of his public life. The Government received a rude shock in the 1961 election, just scraping in with a one seat majority.\n\nIn response, Holt hit the popularity button - cutting personal income tax, increasing unemployment benefits, reduced sales tax and more money for capital works.\n\nHolt carried the scars but the economy recovered and contributed to the Government winning its sixth consecutive election and increasing its majority in 1963.\n\nHe argued successfully that the nation should change from pounds, shillings and pence to decimal currency, which was introduced in 1966.\n\nThat was part of a big year for Harold Holt. Upon the retirement of Robert Menzies, he was sworn in as Prime Minister by his old colleague Richard Casey who was now Australia’s Governor-General.\n\nHe promoted the first woman to the ministry, Dame Annabelle Rankin.\n\nThe White Australia policy was effectively dismantled by the Migration Act 1966 by making skills and ability the selection criteria rather than race and national affiliation.\n\nAnd he forged a warm relationship with the President of the United States, Lyndon Baines Johnson but he was seen as sycophantic when he said in Washington, “All the way with LBJ.”\n\nBack home, Holt gained legitimacy by winning and increasing the Government’s majority at the 1966 election.\n\n1967 was a more challenging year with a scandal over VIP flights, a rift with Coalition partner and Country Party leader Jack McEwen, a serious slump at the November half Senate elections and the horrors of the Vietnam War being shown in Australian homes.\n\nBut the referendum to include Australian Aborigines in the national census and give the Commonwealth the power to make laws for the indigenous population was overwhelmingly endorsed.\n\nIt was his greatest political triumph, one that was remembered on its 50th anniversary earlier this year.\n\nThe 50th anniversary of Harold Holt’s disappearance should be remembered, as well, but it should not overshadow the 32 years in politics from when he first appeared."
