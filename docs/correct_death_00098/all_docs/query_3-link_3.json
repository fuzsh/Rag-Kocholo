        "text": "26 April 1939 to 29 August 1941, 19 December 1949 to 26 January 1966\n\nRobert Menzies – ‘Bob’ Menzies or Mr Menzies – was Australia’s longest-serving Prime Minister. He was Prime Minister twice: from 1939–1941, and from 1949–1966, spending a total of 18 years and five months in the position.\n\nEarly in his first period in office, he announced the declaration of the Second World War to the people of Australia.\n\nIn 1944 he helped found the Liberal Party, which in terms of winning elections has been the most successful party in Australian federal politics.\n\nHe presided over Australia’s longest period of prosperity and rising living standards this century.\n\nMenzie's beginnings\n\nRobert Gordon Menzies was born in Jeparit, Victoria, on 20 December 1894. His parents were James Menzies and Kate Sampson.\n\nJames, of Scottish descent, had been a coach painter in Ballarat before opening a general store in Jeparit. Kate, of Cornish descent, was the daughter of a miners’ union leader. James was elected to the Victorian parliament in 1909 as the representative for Lowan.\n\nRobert Menzies began his education at Jeparit State School before attending Grenville College, Ballarat, and then Wesley College, Melbourne, as a scholarship student. After an outstanding academic career at the University of Melbourne, he graduated with first class honours in Law in 1917.\n\nHe was admitted as a barrister in 1918 and built up a highly successful practice. He married Pattie Maie Leckie in 1920, and they had three children together. In 1929 he became a King’s Counsel, the youngest in Victoria.\n\nMenzies was elected to the Victorian state parliament as a Nationalist Party candidate for the Legislative Council seat of East Yarra in 1928; then resigned and was elected for the Legislative Assembly seat of Nunawading in 1929.\n\nHe served as Honorary Minister 1928–1929, Attorney-General and Minister for Railways 1932–1934, and Acting Premier in 1934. He quit state parliament in 1934 to contest the federal seat of Kooyong as a United Australia Party (UAP) candidate.\n\nPrime Minister Robert Menzies\n\nFirst prime ministership, 1939–1941\n\nMenzies was elected Leader of the UAP and became Prime Minister in April 1939, following the death in office of Lyons, and after the 18-day caretaker prime ministership of Country Party leader, Earle Page.\n\nHe suffered an immediate ferocious attack in parliament from Page, who had favoured the recall to parliament of former Prime Minister Stanley Melbourne Bruce.\n\nPage bitterly accused Menzies of disloyalty to Lyons and the government, and suggested he had been a coward for choosing not to serve overseas during the First World War, although he was a lieutenant in the Army Reserve. (Menzies said his first loyalty was always to the people of his electorate, and maintained that he had family reasons for not serving overseas, as two of his brothers had done.) Refusing to work with Menzies, Page took the Country Party out of coalition with the UAP.\n\nAs Prime Minister, Menzies announced the declaration of war against Germany on 3 September 1939. He formed a war cabinet on 15 September and oversaw Australia’s entry into the Second World War.\n\nThe Country Party re-entered a coalition with the UAP in March 1940, but losses to Labor at the general election in September severely weakened the Menzies coalition government. Continuing dissension with the coalition prompted Menzies to resign as UAP leader and Prime Minister on 28 August 1941.\n\nCountry Party leader Arthur Fadden replaced Menzies as Prime Minister, but held office for only 40 days before being defeated in parliament, making way for John Curtin’s Labor government on 7 October. Despite the instability in the coalition and his loss of office, Menzies had led a government which prepared the nation for war as well as its limited resources allowed.\n\nMenzies was re-elected UAP leader and became Leader of the Opposition in September 1943. In October–December 1944 he sponsored the formation of a new party, the Liberal Party, combining the UAP and 17 other non-Labor groups. He was subsequently elected Liberal leader.\n\nSecond prime ministership, 1949–1966\n\nFollowing increasing public dissatisfaction with Joseph Benedict Chifley’s Labor government, the Liberal and Country parties swept to power at the general election on 10 December 1949.\n\nThe fall of Chifley’s Labor government followed a series of Communist-inspired strikes, controversies over Labor’s wish to nationalise private banks, medical practitioners, transport and communications, and mounting public impatience with continuing wartime austerity measures.\n\nShaking off an earlier reputation for disdain of the public, Menzies proved to be a highly effective populist campaigner, appealing to ordinary citizens through slogans such as ‘Put value back in the pound’ and ‘Are the people the masters of government or government the masters of the people?’\n\nBy exchanging electoral preferences, the Liberals won 55 seats and the Country Party 19, to Labor’s 47.\n\nThe Liberal and Country parties formed a coalition government on 19 December 1949 with Menzies as Prime Minister and Country Party leader AW Fadden as Deputy Prime Minister.\n\nMenzies’ comeback as Prime Minister after the humiliating circumstances of his resignation from the position eight years previously was a great personal triumph. Menzies led the Liberal–Country Party coalition to victory at the next six general elections: in 1951, 1954, 1955, 1958, 1961 and 1963.\n\nA key policy was to stamp out Communist influence in the union movement and end disruption caused by strike action; goals to be achieved by abolishing the Communist Party. Parliament passed the Communist Party Dissolution Act in October 1950.\n\nThe Act was immediately challenged in the High Court by 10 trade unions, Labor’s deputy leader HV Evatt representing one of these. The Act was declared invalid in March 1951. Menzies then sought power to outlaw the Communist Party through a referendum in September 1951.\n\nEvatt successfully led a campaign for a ‘No’ vote to deny government such powers. The referendum on government power to ban the Communist Party occurred in a climate of mounting Cold War tension between Western and Soviet power blocs.\n\nMenzies’ government sent Australian armed services to the Korean War between 1950–1953 and signed the ANZUS treaty with USA and NZ in 1951, which became the basis of Australian defence planning for the next four decades.\n\nEconomic prosperity\n\nThe Menzies government presided over the longest period of economic prosperity in Australia’s history, lasting from the late 1940s to the early 1970s. This period was one of rapid development, almost continual economic growth, rising standards of living and very low (below two per cent) unemployment rates.\n\nTwo major public spectacles of the mid-1950s became the focus of national attention, prompting outpourings of national sentiment – the Royal Tour of Queen Elizabeth II and Duke of Edinburgh in 1954 and the Melbourne Olympic Games in 1956.\n\nBoth events were strongly promoted by the government. Menzies’ position was also strengthened by a split in the Labor Party during the 1950s.\n\nFrom the mid-1960s the ‘long boom’ continued with the discovery and exploitation of new mineral and petroleum resources."
