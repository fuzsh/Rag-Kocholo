        "text": "DOB 31.10.1931\n\nShort history in the life of Terry for his 90th Birthday.\n\nTerry - an only child - was born in Perth, to an Irish mother and Australian father. They were very social and he had a privileged upbringing. His mother played tennis with Sir Kingsford Smith and his father, managed the Perth Paper. Kerry Packer was in his class - when they were in kindergarten - and he remembers - \"they were rivals as they both liked the same girl\".\n\nThey moved to Sydney in 1934 and this was the first time he was able to cross the Famous 'Sydney Harbour Bridge' that has turned into a lifelong obsession - with the bridge. Terry has a huge collection of bridge memorabilia at his house.\n\nHis first education was in Sydney, during the war years and then his father was transferred back to WA, he states \"we arrived in Perth, by sea 1 week post the Japanese sneaking into Sydney Harbour in 1942\". He also remembers, Mary Durack and her family were at the Perth dock, and his father introducing them as 'distant cousins'. He was schooled at the exclusive boys' school - Wesley College.\n\nThey moved back to Sydney after the war and he started his career as an engineer. He also became a part of the Mosman Scouts and John Laws was in his group for a short time. After he served his apprenticeship he went to England in 1954 and met his first wife Jackie, a pretty lass from NZ. They moved to Canada and had a son Rolf. He worked for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation as a film projectionist and became friends with another Australia, actor Errol Flynn. Terry was also asked to show Prince Phillip the new 'colour projection camera' whilst his wife was busy doing something else at the studio, and the prince was extremely interested in it and they both enjoyed the meeting.\n\nIn 1961, the family moved back to Australia and Terry was working for Shell Australia. One of his jobs was the tour NSW showing a black and white movie, produced by shell, called 'The Back of Beyond' and much to Terry's delight, he saw it again on Netflix. He was asked to show the then Prime Minister of Australia, Sir Robert Menzies a private viewing at his home, where they enjoyed the movie and then afternoon tea together.\n\nTerry was also one of the engineers to work on the Mills Cross in Canberra, the World's largest radio telescope. It was a mile along each arm, in the shape of an X (cross). He then started his own plastics factory and they moved to Vaucluse in Sydney. They had two daughters and terry launched the 'Smiley Badge' onto the Australian Market. He and his wife Jackie divorced in the early 70's and they moved to Queensland, 2 years later Terry married Marion. He started to collect bottle openers and razors. He continues to enjoy this wonderfully large collection.\n\nTerry also made some items for the new Opera house that was being built at the time, and this enabled the huge glass windows to be put into place. His contribution enabled him to be invited to the exclusive 'Grand opening party' in 1973. He also worked on Australia's oldest clock at the Hyde Park Barracks Clock in Macquarie Street in Sydney, where they had to stop the clock to repair it. He was the first man to stop the clock since it was erected there in 1819. Terry has also collected an enormous collection of antique wood working tools, which he proudly displays at his home.\n\nTerry bought the 'first Mayor of Sydney' (John Hosking) home in Redfern, which housed a stable and a ball room. This enabled him to work on restoring antique furniture and his customers would visit him at his home. This included Paul Keating - premier at the time, Governor General - Bill Hayden (William George Hayden), Neville Wran - who was also the premier at the time and Bob Hawke, to name a few. He did this for many years, till he retired and then moved to Bruny Island, Tasmania in around 1996.\n\nHis reason for choosing Tasmania was for two reasons. Peace and quiet after living in the middle of Sydney for many years and his ancestors had been settlers in the early 1800's. They owned large amounts of land and help built the township of Richmond. They also supplied the 'locally quarried sandstone' to the convicts to build the 'Richmond Bridge', in 1825. Australia's oldest bridge. The hills surrounding Richmond are still called \"Butchers Hill's' by the locals.\n\nTerry made his final move to Flaxton, Sunshine Coast in September 2020, for the warmth and to be near his daughter Sasha and son-in-law Benno Fenger.\n\nTerry peacefully 'flew' away on the 17th of June.\n\nTerry's life story will be published later this year."
