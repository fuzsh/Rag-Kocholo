        "text": "Parliament\n\nWhen Robert Menzies was elected leader of the UAP, he inherited not only the prime ministership, but also leadership of a coalition. So, when Country Party leader Earle Page refused to work with him, the UAP was forced to act as a minority government until 1941.\n\nAfter being re-elected to government in 1949, Menzies was forced to seek a double dissolution election for April 1951, when the Labor controlled Senate refused to pass an act to repeal the nationalisation of the banking system. The Liberal Country Coalition was returned with a reduced majority in the lower house, alleviated by control of the Senate.\n\nThe 1954 election became the Petrov poll, which Menzies narrowly won. He improved his position winning a snap election comfortably in 1955 against a divided Labor Party, and winning the first televised election in 1958. Following a recession and a very unpopular budget, the Coalition suffered heavy losses in 1961, retaining a majority by only one seat. In 1963, the Coalition regained these losses in the House of Representatives.\n\nMenzies’ first term as prime minister had seen the passing of legislation such as the National Security Acts of 1939 and 1940, aimed at seeing Australia through the war. The early 1950s saw a continued focus on security and defence but, by the second half of the decade, Menzies presided over cultural, economic and social legislation including broadcasting legislation, various banking acts, uniform divorce laws and electoral reforms. Menzies was a parliamentary performer without peer; the Melbourne Herald journalist E.H. Cox described him as being ‘uniformly suave in the House of Representatives.’\n\nHe used language with eloquence and precision to convey an argument, but equally in service of a withering comeback against an opponent. Menzies record-breaking term in government ended with his retirement on Australia Day 1966, one of few Australian prime ministers to leave office on their own terms.\n\nParty\n\nAs leader of the UAP during the early years of World War II, Menzies battled to retain support. Earle Page and the Country Party consistently used Menzies’ lack of war service to undermine his authority. As leader of the Liberal Party, Menzies had no such trouble. He successfully secured a renewed coalition with the Country Party for the 1946 election.\n\nFor most of his lengthy tenure Menzies enjoyed a high degree of party loyalty, maintained stable ministries and never faced a leadership challenge. Menzies formed a close working relationship with John McEwen who became the leader of the Country Party in 1958.\n\nThe partnership brought ongoing stability to the Coalition and, despite occasional party differences, this was to be a source of great pride for Menzies. Menzies as the ‘founder’ of the Liberal Party received considerable respect from the party membership. His leadership of the Cabinet and party room has sometimes been portrayed as dictatorial and ruthless.\n\nThe reality appears to be somewhat different; a number of Menzies’ colleagues have noted that on important issues there was always full discussion in which anyone who wished to speak could do so and was listened to by Menzies. Paul Hasluck stated that ‘Menzies had a far better mind than anyone else in and around the government… he could see more quickly and more exactly and accurately reach a conclusion after hearing the arguments.’\n\nMenzies achieved his desired outcomes because he knew what he wanted, was a gifted proponent of his view and was recognised by many in his Cabinet and party as their best man."
