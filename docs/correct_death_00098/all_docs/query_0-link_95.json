        "text": "Education in Sydney started with Aboriginal society and the everyday learning and formal initiation of young Aboriginal people. Institutionalised education came with the Europeans, who first created schools for convicts' children, and later for the children of the new gentry and middle classes. Sydney became the centre of education in the colony, with a university, and eventually in 1880, universal education throughout the suburbs of the growing city.\n\nFCAATSI is best known for its work campaigning for a 'Yes' vote in the 1967 referendum which changed the constitution to allow the Federal government to legislate for Aboriginal people. In Sydney, it also raised awareness about the working conditions and disadvantage suffered by Aboriginal workers.\n\nOne of the large Lindsay family of artists and writers, Lionel Lindsay settled in Sydney from 1903, and became a well known art writer as well as a noted watercolourist and printmaker.\n\nSport has long been important in Sydney life, interwoven with its fabric and culture. The ritual contests and physical activity of the Aboriginal people gave way to the informal, disreputable and often cruel pastimes of the early nineteenth century. The late nineteenth century saw the development of formal codes and organised leagues, leading to the commercialised, professional sports of the present.\n\nThe process of suburbanisation is arguably one of the most important developments in Sydney's post-invasion history. Kilometres of suburbs have for decades dominated the physical evolution of Sydney and its ideological underpinnings."
