        "text": "Selected Speeches of Brendan Nelson\n\nEdited by David Furse-Roberts\n\nPaperback, 296 pages, $39.95\n\nRelease Date: August 2024\n\nOrders for this book will be fulfilled in Mid-August\n\nThe power of Brendan Nelson's speeches is found not only in his choice of words but in the passion and persuasion of their expression.\n\nThis volume captures Dr Nelson's timeless contributions to public life as an advocate for doctors, parliamentary leader and custodian of Australia's military tradition.\n\nThese are the unfiltered words of an extraordinary Australian who speaks with bravery and unwavering belief straight from his heart.\n\nEdited by David Stevens\n\nPaperback, 286 pages, $34.95\n\nRelease Date: June 2023\n\nDignity and Prosperity – The Future of Liberal Australia brings together, for the first time, Australia’s leading liberal luminaries or ‘grandees’ in one place for the purpose of reigniting a renaissance of the Liberal cause.\n\nThe distinguished contributors all have extensive experience in their respective fields, and now bring their expertise, knowledge, and insight to design a policy program based around the core values of liberalism – personal autonomy and personal responsibility, free market and entrepreneurship, opportunity and security, limited government and sound fiscal and economic management. They know that a strong economy leads to strong finances, which in turn provide for strong national defence and together create the foundations for a strong civic society. This is the virtue of a successful liberal democracy.\n\nPaperback, 100 pages, $19.95\n\nThis new biography by Sean Jacobs, based on years of research, explores Neville Bonner’s hardscrabble beginnings and rise to become Australia’s first Indigenous federal parliamentarian. Despite a difficult start, and only a year of formal schooling, Bonner turned discrimination and setback into success, overcoming hard days in northern New South Wales and Queensland to represent Queensland as a Liberal Senator for 12 years in the national parliament (1971 – 1983). Bonner’s towering dignity to be a full participant in Australian society, and his constant capacity to see the good in all Australians, make him not only a great Indigenous Australian but one of our greatest Australians.\n\nSean Jacobs is a Papua New Guinean-born Australian writer, government relations and public policy specialist. He has worked at all levels of government in Australia, New Zealand and PNG, and holds a BA (International Relations) from Griffith University and Postgraduate Certificate in Policing, Intelligence and Counter Terrorism from Macquarie University. His interest in Neville Bonner emerged after discovering Bonner’s story as a young policy adviser at the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. Jacobs currently lives in Brisbane.\n\nThe fifth and final volume of David Kemp’s landmark Australian Liberalism series explores how Australia's founding Enlightenment ideals were shaped into a unique national liberalism, embodied in liberal democratic institutions, political parties and shared values. Despite intense partisan loyalties, conservative and radical resistance, and a politics of unequal power and influence, inequality was addressed and personal freedom strengthened. The book examines the place of liberal ideas in governments from Harold Holt to Scott Morrison. It shows how reform urgency led to the nation's greatest political crisis in 1975, how prime ministers Fraser and Hawke struggled to manage an economy dominated by powerful union, business and global interests, how during twenty-four crucial years Hawke, Keating and Howard led one of the nation's greatest reform eras, and how social reform continued despite the leadership instability of the post-Howard era.\n\nAn unsettling assessment of how - and when - war with China might break out and the consequences for the world, from bestselling author and ex-major general the late Jim Molan\n\nWhat are Australia's options in confronting a rising and belligerent China?\n\nFor the first time in nearly 80 years, war on our doorstop is not just possible, it is likely. Former army major general and Liberal Party senator Jim Molan fought wars, reviewed intelligence, participated in government and conducted business in hotspots across the world, making him an expert in evaluating risk and reward in perilous military situations.\n\nIn this sober assessment, penned just before he died, Molan examines the present and growing danger of China's rise, not just to Taiwan, Japan and other countries in the immediate region, but also to the geopolitical balance of power as it has existed since the end of World War II. He suggests what China's endgame is, how war might start, what war with China would look like and, importantly, what Australia's best interests and options are. Acknowledging the increasing awareness of possible conflict, he stresses how important it is to prepare for the right war, not the war we would prefer to fight, or the one we think might never happen.\n\nFrom the standpoint of a true patriot and in the spirit of man to man, Sir Robert Menzies stresses, in The Forgotten People, both the rights and the duties of the people and of Parliament. He states clearly what the Liberal Party’s position is, what its aims are, and the part that every citizen must play if the war is to be won. He looks toward the future, the post-war world, and shows how we must work and plan today to combat the dangers that will inevitably beset tomorrow. He examines the meaning and achievements of democracy; he analyses the implications of President Roosevelt's four freedoms; and he upholds the dignity and the rights of the \"forgotten people\"--the middle classes, the \"backbone of this country.\"\n\nHow did Menzies develop as the giant of Australian politics?\n\nSir Robert Menzies is a towering figure in Australian history. As the nation's longest-serving prime minister, he transformed and ultimately dominated the political landscape, implementing policies that laid the foundations of modern Australia. The story of Menzies and his governments is essential to the Australian narrative: the centrality of political liberalism, the defence of democracy through trying times, and the expanding horizons of our identity, prosperity and appreciation.\n\nThe Young Menzies: Success, Failure, Resilience 1894-1942 explores the formative period of Menzies's life, when his personal outlook and system of beliefs that would help shape modern Australia were themselves still being formed. Contributors look at Menzies's ideas prior to their political practice and examine their context and origins. This period is also the time in which Menzies first attained power, though in difficult circumstances, when the focus of the nation was on survival. It was in losing office that Menzies was given the impetus to develop his vision for post-war Australia.\n\nThis is the first of a four-volume history of Menzies and his world, based on conferences convened by the Robert Menzies Institute at the University of Melbourne. Contributors include Frank Bongiorno, Troy Bramston, Judith Brett, Nick Cater, Justice James Edelman, David Furse-Roberts, Anne Henderson, David Kemp, Angela Kittikhoun, Greg Melleuish and Scott Prasser, with a foreword by Geoffrey Blainey."
