        "text": "In 1944, the Liberal Party of Australia was founded after a three-day meeting held in a small hall not far from Parliament House in Canberra. The meeting was called by the then Leader of the Opposition (United Australia Party) Robert Menzies.\n\nRobert Menzies had already served as Prime Minister of Australia (1939-41), but he believed that the non-Labor parties should unite to present a strong alternative government to the Australian people.\n\nEighty men and women from 18 non-Labor political parties and organisations attended the first Canberra conference.\n\nThey shared a common belief that Australians should have greater personal freedom and choice than that offered under Labor’s post-war socialist plans.\n\nRobert Menzies believed the time was right for a new political force in Australia - one which fought for the freedom of the individual and produced enlightened liberal policies.\n\nIn his opening address at that meeting, he said:\n\n...what we must look for, and it is a matter of desperate importance to our society, is a true revival of liberal thought which will work for social justice and security, for national power and national progress, and for the full development of the individual citizen, though not through the dull and deadening process of socialism.\n\nIt is often said that Robert Menzies stood for the ‘forgotten people’ of Australia; those mainstream Australians whose goals, needs and aspirations had been ignored by Government.\n\nOn October 16, 1944, the name The Liberal Party of Australia was adopted, uniting the many different political organisations. Two months later, at the Albury Conference, the Party’s organisational and constitutional framework was drawn up.\n\nThe name Liberal was chosen deliberately for its associations with progressive nineteenth century free enterprise and social equality. By May 1945 membership of the Liberal Party had swelled to 40,000.\n\nIt fought its first election in 1946 with some success and in 1947, the Liberal Party won State Government in Western Australia, South Australia and Victoria. In 1949 the Liberals, in coalition with the Country Party, were first elected to national government.\n\nSir Robert Menzies went on to lead Australia and the Liberal Party for 17 years, before he retired from politics in 1966.\n\nThe Liberal Party has become Australia’s most successful postwar party; it was elected to Government for 23 years from 1949 to 1972, and for another term of more than seven years from 1975 to 1983.\n\nIn 1996, the Australian people again re-elected the Liberal Party, in Coalition with the National Party of Australia, to govern Australia in a landslide win, and in 1998, 2001 & 2004 that government was re-elected.\n\nIn 2013, the Abbott Coalition Government took office. In September 2015, Malcolm Turnbull was sworn in as Australia’s 29th Prime Minister. In August 2018, Scott Morrison was elected leader of the Liberal Party and became Australia’s 30th Prime Minister.\n\nOur Leaders from 1944 Onwards\n\nRobert Menzies\n\n1944 - 1966\n\nPrime Minister (1949 - 1966)\n\nHarold Holt\n\n1966 - 1967\n\nPrime Minister\n\nJohn Gorton\n\n1968 - 1971\n\nPrime Minister\n\nWilliam McMahon\n\n1971 - 1972\n\nPrime Minister\n\nBill Snedden\n\n1972 - 1975\n\nLeader of the Opposition\n\nMalcolm Fraser\n\n1975 - 1983\n\nPrime Minister\n\nAndrew Peacock\n\n1983 - 1985\n\nLeader of the Opposition\n\nJohn Howard\n\n1985 -1989\n\nLeader of the Opposition\n\nAndrew Peacock\n\n1989 - 1990\n\nLeader of the Opposition\n\nJohn Hewson\n\n1990 - 1994\n\nLeader of the Opposition\n\nAlexander Downer\n\n1994 - 1995\n\nLeader of the Opposition\n\nJohn Howard\n\n1995 - 2007\n\nPrime Minister (1996 - 2007)\n\nBrendan Nelson\n\n2007 - 2008\n\nLeader of the Opposition\n\nMalcolm Turnbull\n\n2008 - 2009\n\nLeader of the Opposition\n\nTony Abbott\n\n2009 - 2015\n\nPrime Minister (2013 - 2015)\n\nMalcolm Turnbull\n\n2015 - 2018\n\nPrime Minister\n\nScott Morrison\n\n2018 - 2022\n\nPrime Minister\n\nPeter Dutton\n\n2022 - Present\n\nLeader of the Opposition\n\nOur Electoral Success - from Past to Present"
