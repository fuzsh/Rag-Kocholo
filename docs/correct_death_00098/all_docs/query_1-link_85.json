        "text": "[This is an edited transcript of the 2023 Charles Perry Lecture in Melbourne Evangelical History, delivered at Ridley College on 21 September 2023.]\n\nThe faith of the family into which Robert Gordon Menzies (1894–1978) was born was at once simple and intensely practical.\n\nMenzies’s father, James, served as President of the Milton Boys Home in 1926, a charity that succeeded the old Latrobe Street Ragged School and Mission to provide residential care for homeless boys in Melbourne. He was assisted by his wife, Kate, who served on the women’s auxiliary of the home. In honour of the Menzies’s service, the Milton Boys Home became known as the Menzies Home for Boys and, later, the Menzies Home for Children to accommodate girls as well. Robert Menzies’s eldest brother served as the President of the Home, and, when he was Prime Minister, Menzies visited the home himself in 1958.\n\nThe practical faith embodied by Menzies’s family came to define the essence of his own Christianity, which was theologically uncomplicated with an emphasis on self-giving service. Like the twentieth-century Anglican writer and apologist C.S. Lewis, Menzies would have viewed himself as an exponent of “mere Christianity” which rejected atheism to affirm the Christian essentials of a Trinitarian God, a divinely inspired Bible, and personal redemption through Christ.\n\nIn his Christmas messages, Menzies recognised the cross as the “figure of sacrifice” and acknowledged that Jesus Christ was “human as well as divine”. In his 1960 speech to open the Bible Society’s new headquarters in Canberra, he described the Bible as the “repository of our faith and our inspiration” and remarked that the “great gospel” and the “whole spirit of Christianity” is contained in this “great and immortal book”.\n\nThe wellsprings of Menzies’s Christian faith\n\nWhile the Christian orientation of Menzies was simple and practical, its origins were somewhat complex. His religious faith was drawn from multiple strands of Christianity, and here I will outline four of them. The first two were denominational — namely, Presbyterian and Methodist; the second two were trans-denominational — liberal Protestantism and evangelical.\n\nPRESBYTERIANISM\n\nFond of describing himself as a “simple Presbyterian”, the immediate source of Menzies’s faith was naturally the Scottish Presbyterianism from his father’s side of the family. To be sure, Menzies largely saw his Presbyterianism as part and parcel of his Scottish ethnicity, just as an Irish Australian would typically see their Catholicism, or a German Australian their Lutheranism. As such, he personified many of the cultural attitudes characteristic of Presbyterianism such as thrift, personal responsibility, a dedication to the Protestant work ethic, the importance of civic duty, and the integration of the sacred into the secular.\n\nIn terms of Presbyterian theology, Menzies was certainly familiar with the Westminster Confession of Faith and assented to its confession of the Christian fundamentals, but he did not necessarily hold firm to its more explicitly Calvinist teachings. This was for two main reasons: first, his doctrinally minimalist form of Christianity was not disposed to probing the finer points of theology; and second, there were some Calvinist doctrines with which he felt uncomfortable, owing to a combination of both Methodist and Enlightenment liberal sympathies.\n\nFor one thing, Menzies had a too optimistic view of human nature as a liberal to have accepted the Calvinist doctrine of “total depravity” which held human beings to have no innate capacity for good apart from God’s grace. In addition, Menzies’s universalist conception of God’s fatherhood would not have sat well with the Calvinist doctrine of “limited atonement”, the idea that God sent Christ to die only for the “elect”. While Menzies did not speak specifically on the atonement, he would have warmed more to the Wesleyan Methodist understanding that Christ’s death on the cross was for all of humanity and not just the elect. Thus, for all his Presbyterian identity and familiarity with the Westminster Confession, his theology was arguably more Methodist than Calvinist.\n\nMETHODISM\n\nTogether with the Scottish Presbyterianism of the Menzies lineage, the Cornish Methodism of his mother’s side coursed through his veins. His mother, Kate, later identified with the Presbyterianism of her husband, James, but her Sampson family background was of Methodist origin. Given Robert Menzies’s own upbringing in the Jeparit Methodist Church and his secondary education at Wesley College, it was not surprising that his faith assumed more of a Methodist flavour. His belief in human free-will, his optimistic view of human transformation, and his emphasis on the practical over the theological, more closely resembled the Methodist spirit of John Wesley than the Presbyterian tradition of John Knox.\n\nAfter leaving Wesley College, Menzies was not known to worship regularly at Methodist churches — yet, far from fading into obsolescence, the Methodism of his childhood and youth continued to infuse the flavour of his Protestantism well into his riper years. This was evident in the high praise he accorded the founder of Methodism, John Wesley, whom he credited for breathing life into a lethargic eighteenth-century English church.\n\nThe Methodist sympathies of Menzies helped explain the close association he enjoyed with the Rev. Sir Clarence Irving Benson, the leading Methodist cleric of post-war Melbourne, as well as his warm affection for the Salvation Army, a nineteenth-century offshoot of Methodism founded by the revivalist preacher William Booth.\n\nLIBERAL AND EVANGELICAL PROTESTANTISM\n\nAs to the broader pan-Protestant influences on Menzies’s faith, there were two seemingly conflicting streams of liberal and evangelical Protestantism.\n\nMenzies imbibed much of the liberal Protestant tradition through his involvement with the Melbourne University Student Christian Union (SCU), of which he served as president in 1916. The Melbourne SCU was part of the worldwide Student Christian Movement (SCM) founded by the American evangelist John R. Mott in 1895. Although it could be classified as broadly evangelical in origin, the movement assumed more of a theologically liberal nature in the early-twentieth century, —with a modernist approach to interpreting Scripture, together with an emphasis on ethics, practical Christianity, the universal fatherhood of God, and the teachings of the human Jesus.\n\nIn contrast to traditional evangelical Protestantism, liberal Protestantism tended to emphasise first the “Fatherhood of God” and the “Brotherhood of Man” before personal salvation through Jesus Christ. Menzies reflected this orientation himself as he saw God as the father of all human beings, and all people as brothers and sisters of one another. The liberal Protestant approach to interpreting Scripture also shaped Menzies. Despite his own high view of the Bible, he noted approvingly from his travels to England in the 1930s that “the literal interpretation of the Bible was now abandoned by all intelligent men, including most of the bishops”. In short, Menzies took the Bible seriously but not literally.\n\nFor all its theologically liberal orientation, however, it was evident that Menzies’s Protestantism also bore some unmistakable hallmarks of evangelicalism. The young Menzies absorbed this more conservative form of Protestantism through his reading of the Scottish evangelist and theologian Henry Drummond, as well as through his personal encounter with the Melbourne Church of England evangelical, Clifford Harris Nash, the founder of the Melbourne Bible Institute.\n\nAs a law student at the University of Melbourne, Menzies attended an evangelistic address by C.H. Nash where he had a personal encounter with the evangelist. Thirty years later, Nash crossed paths with Menzies again, and recalling their original encounter on campus, Nash said:\n\nThe Prime Minister of Australia, Mr Menzies, came to me at a meeting and said, “Did you give a lecture in Melbourne in a classroom there many years ago?” I said, “Yes I went several times.” He said, “Did you have a little black book in your hand, and did you hold it up and say, ‘In this book is all I know of Jesus Christ and all I need to know of what God has in store for me’?” I said, “Yes”, and produced the Book from my pocket — my Greek Testament. Mr Menzies said, “I was one of those who heard you and I have never forgotten the effect that your words had on me.”\n\nIn addition to C.H. Nash, Menzies attributed his practice of Bible reading to Dr Leland Wang, the Chinese evangelist and founder of the Chinese Foreign Missionary Union.\n\nWith regular Bible reading being the most obvious evangelical trait of Menzies’s faith, his Protestantism exhibited other evangelical characteristics. Unlike proponents of the social gospel movement, Menzies held to the evangelical understanding that Christianity started with the spiritual renewal of the individual rather than the restructuring of society. His appreciation of evangelicalism was evident also in his admiration for hearty expressions of faith. While not an evangelical revivalist in the mould of Billy Graham or Dwight L. Moody, he appreciated a Christianity that exuded spiritual life. From the diary entries of his visit to the UK in 1935, he evidently favoured church services with heartfelt worship and gospel preaching rather than perfunctory ones that simply went through the motions of the liturgy.\n\nPromoting a common Christianity\n\nThe sheer breadth of Christian traditions from which Menzies formed his faith enabled him as Prime Minister to project a common Christianity that transcended doctrinal divisions between Australia’s churches. In a speech to a Salvation Army citizens’ rally in 1958, Menzies said:\n\nI know that in the course of history there have been divisions in the Christian Church, and … no doubt we all have some differences among ourselves in terms of governments; sometimes in some points of doctrine. But I always like to feel that underneath all this there is one Bible; there is one message; and that the nearer we get to that, the less will we be concerned with dogma of any kind.\n\nViewing the Bible as the common wellspring of faith for Christians of all churches, Menzies observed that it was “better to seek the fountainhead than to divide up amongst the little streams”.\n\nThe ecumenism of Menzies extended also to Australia’s Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox communities. Since the late 1920s, in an age where sectarianism was rife in the aftermath of the Great War and amid the bitter public debate over conscription, Menzies had a long record of seeking to heal the Protestant-Catholic rift that had long blighted Australian society. In 1928, he defended his decision to attend the opening of a Catholic school in his Victorian state electorate of East Yarra in the face of opposition from some of his constituents. As the Victorian Attorney-General in the early 1930s, he attracted criticism for standing up to some Protestants who wanted to ban a large Catholic eucharistic procession through the streets of central Melbourne.\n\nAs Prime Minister in 1939, he addressed a Melbourne peace rally organised by Catholic Action, a lay advocacy organisation, and stressed the shared faith of all present by drawing attention to his presence, as a Presbyterian, on a Catholic platform. In Menzies’s second term as Prime Minister, his cooperation with Australian Catholics on the contentious state aid issue was recognised when he was invited as guest of honour to the annual Cardinal's Dinner in Sydney 1964. Essentially, Menzies saw Protestants and Catholics as different branches of the one Christian tree with its trunk grounded in Christ Jesus and the cross of salvation.\n\nWith the arrival of Eastern European immigrants after the Second World War contributing to a small yet growing Eastern Orthodox presence in Australia, Menzies made overtures to the Greek Orthodox community. Officiating at the opening of new Greek Orthodox Churches in Melbourne, Menzies applauded not only their spiritual and community contribution but also the Christian heritage they shared with Australians at large.\n\nCommitted to religious freedom\n\nAt the same time as fostering a common Christianity as part of Australia’s identity and heritage, Menzies recognised the diversity of post-war Australia’s faith communities and therefore promoted religious freedom, non-sectarianism, and interfaith harmony in the civic life of the nation.\n\nPrior to the growth of Islam, Buddhism, and other religious faiths in Australia from the 1970s, Judaism represented Australia’s second largest religious community. Menzies enjoyed an excellent rapport with Australia’s Jews, whom he admired for their resilience from centuries of persecution in Europe and elsewhere. He respected the Jewish legacy for its Old Testament origins and profound contribution to Western civilisation. He also admired the Jewish people for their cultural traditions of scholarship, civic-mindedness, and enduring sense of kinship. Frequently invited to speak at ceremonies organised by the Jewish community, Menzies praised the Jewish people for their contribution to Australia.\n\nWith his abiding commitment to religious freedom, Menzies affirmed the place of all faiths in Australia. In his address to the 1964 Cardinal’s Dinner, he remarked that:\n\nWe are all members one of another. This is something we must never lose sight of, and whether we be Catholic or Protestant or Jewish or Muslim, the end remains clear: We have an overwhelming duty to serve our country on the highest level and to the best of our talents.\n\nThis was premised on a long-held conviction in religious freedom for all citizens, including those of no faith. In a 1941 address on religious freedom, Menzies stressed that religious freedom was freedom for all: “Catholic or Protestant, Jew or Gentile, and that to deny it was to go back to the dark ages of man.” As unappealing as atheism may have been to Menzies as a belief-system, he nonetheless affirmed the freedom “to worship or not to worship”.\n\nOf atheists and agnostics, he remarked: “There have been honest and indeed noble men in this world who have never been able to find a God. Are we to deny them their place?” In Australia and elsewhere, different faith communities will never agree on the nature of the divine and the path of salvation, yet in civil society, they can find plenty of common ground with their appeal to human goodwill and the pursuit of the common good. The calling for Christians and others of faith in such a society, to quote the late Rabbi Jonathan Sacks, “is to be true to our faith while being a blessing to others regardless of their faith”.\n\nRobert Menzies and principles of public Christian engagement\n\nOf course, the cultural currency of Christianity and the public standing of the churches today is vastly different to that of Menzies’s time as Prime Minister. Yet even in our highly secularised society, there are principles from Menzies that we can contend for in the present time.\n\nCHERISH AUSTRALIA’S CHRISTIAN HERITAGE, YET SAFEGUARD A PLACE FOR ALL FAITHS\n\nMenzies saw no tension between a country such as ours being able to cherish and celebrate its Christian heritage, and being open and embracing of citizens from all religious or non-religious creeds.\n\nMenzies would have rejected the secularist myth that post-1788 Australia evolved in some kind of spiritual vacuum with no formative religious foundation. Rather, he would have accepted the sensible thesis of the historian Manning Clarke that modern Australia was forged primarily by the three traditions of Protestantism, Catholicism, and the Enlightenment. Indeed, he would have recognised that it was the Judeo-Christian impulses of hospitality, toleration, and love of neighbour, drawn from teachings such as the parable of the Good Samaritan, that made it possible for a society such as Australia to welcome newcomers of different backgrounds and faiths.\n\nArticulating this neighbourly ethic at a Citizenship Convention in 1950, Menzies said that “we should regard every migrant as our friend, and we should go to no end of trouble to make every migrant feel at home”. He understood also that immigrants were attracted to Australia for the very country that it already was, with those attractive features of freedom, peace, order, the rule of law, and good government being undeniable fruits of its Judeo-Christian inheritance. For Christian believers, this inheritance can be best understood as a providential blessing to be cherished with thanksgiving.\n\nAFFIRM FREEDOM OF POLITICAL CONSCIENCE FOR CHRISTIANS\n\nGiven Menzies’s toleration for a plurality of religious views in civic life, it was not surprising that he also exhibited a toleration for a plurality of political views within the Christian community. As attached as Menzies was to his own Liberal Party, he accepted that there was room in every political party for men and women of all schools of Christian thought. Believing in a faith that transcended political creeds, Menzies’s conception of Christianity was avowedly non-partisan. He remarked that: “It would be a poor day if we got to the stage of believing that in our particular church everybody must subscribe to a particular political party.”\n\nIn a speech to Sydney’s Wesley Mission in 1958, he warned against the temptation for Christians to express their faith in party-political terms, but insisted that this was different from expressing one’s politics in Christian terms. Essentially, this meant that instead of a person’s faith being informed by their political ideology, their political creed should be informed by their faith. This was because Menzies believed that as important as political ideas were, a religious faith such as Christianity was of greater and over-riding importance.\n\nPROMOTE A HOLISTIC VIEW OF HUMAN FLOURISHING\n\nThe importance Menzies accorded to personal religious faith formed part of his holistic view of human flourishing. As much as he welcomed the rising standard of living in the post-war era, with more Australian households owning homes, cars, modern appliances, and other consumer goods, he reminded his citizens that there was much more to the “good life” than material gain. In a 1962 address, he said:\n\nWe could easily become man for man, woman for woman, the richest country in the Southern Hemisphere, but it won’t matter very much unless we can say that we are the most civilised country … Civilised because we understand the unselfish duties of citizenship; civilised because we have come to understand the importance of the human being, the dignity of the human being, the dignity of labour, the responsibility of riches. These are the tests of civilisation, and our great task is to produce a civilised nation.\n\nLike the celebrated Russian intellectual and Soviet dissident Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, Menzies was awake to not only the tyranny of Soviet communism in the East, but also the danger of rising materialism in the West.\n\nIn a Western world preoccupied with materialistic imperatives such as economic growth, prosperity, and productivity, the high premium Menzies afforded to faith, moral character, freedom, civilisation, community, and personal relationships remain eminently instructive for today. It is a reminder for us not only as a nation, but as individuals, that it is the character of our hearts, the way we treat others, the relationships we build and the difference we make to our world that counts rather than our net worth, postcode or possessions. Menzies’s old friend, Winston Churchill, put it well when he said: “We make a living by what we get, we make a life by what we give.”\n\nSTRESS THE “IMAGE OF GOD” OF ALL PEOPLE\n\nFor Menzies, the ultimate source of an individual’s worth was their creation in the image of God. As foreign as this may sound to secular ears, we need to be reminded of Menzies’s insight “that there is in very human soul a spark of the divine” and that the souls of all “stand equal in the eyes of God”. His belief in the Imago Dei was thoroughly consistent, and when speaking about the importance of education in 1961, he said:\n\nWe must recapture our desire to know more, and feel more, about our fellowmen; to have a philosophy of living; to elevate the dignity of man, a dignity which, in our Christian concept, arises from our belief that he is made in the image of his Maker.\n\nBelieving that each individual, in the words of the Psalmist, is “fearfully and wonderfully made”, it is surely this sage truth of the Hebrew Scriptures that trumps any category of race, class, gender or sexuality as the source of our true human worth and identity. For believers in the Christian message, moreover, it is the cross of Christ that is the great equaliser and guarantor of our human worth. From the richest king to the naked thief who hung beside the crucified Christ, all could find redemption and restoration through the power of the cross.\n\nHow are Christians to engage their world today?\n\nWhere does this leave Christian believers in a public culture that has changed so radically since Menzies’s time? Going from an age of Sunday schools bursting at the seams, printed sermons in major newspapers and 88 per cent of Australians ticking a Christian denomination on the Census form, to one where only 44 per cent of people identify as Christian, where country churches are converted into pubs, and where Christian moral attitudes are viewed not simply as dated, but often even intolerable. Even in his day, Menzies appreciated that “Christianity was the greatest minority movement in human history”, and history in a sense has come full circle.\n\nIn a time when Christians feel like a besieged minority, it is tempting to despair and lose heart, but they are reminded from church history that their first forebears in the faith were here before and that God is a faithful shepherd to his people. Christians of all generations have been called to be salt and light, to love their neighbours, to do good to all, and to seek the good of the city. The Croatian theologian Miroslav Volf reminds us that:\n\nthe followers of Jesus Christ are sent into this world as he was sent, to love friends and enemies, co-religionists and infidels, and to rejoice in everything that is true, good, and beautiful wherever they encounter it.\n\nMore than two centuries earlier, John Wesley, sometimes referred to as the “Apostle of England” and a favourite of Menzies, reminded the people of God to do all the good they could, to all the people they could, by all the ways they could, in all the places they could, for as long as they could.\n\nAnd long before Wesley, the Apostle Paul reminded his fellow believers that they would find themselves at war with the powers, principalities, and darkness of this age. Menzies and his fellow travellers in the churches certainly understood this in their day as they stood firm for the ageless truths of Christianity against atheistic communism and then rising materialism and permissiveness.\n\nYet in this battle, believers must remember the words of G.K. Chesterton, that “the true soldier fights not because he hates what is in front of him but because he loves what is behind him”. For those who follow Christ, that means loving what Menzies called “the old yet new Evangel of the Sermon on the Mount”, loving our neighbour, whether friend or foe, and holding fast to all that is good, true and beautiful in God’s world for which He sent his Son to seek and to save all that was lost."
