        "text": "A revelatory biography of Australia’s longest-serving prime minister.\n\nRobert Menzies claimed the prime ministership in 1939 and led the nation during the early years of the war, but resigned two years later when he lost the confidence of his party. His political career seemed over, and yet he staged one of the great comebacks to forge a new political party with a new philosophy, and to craft a winning electoral approach that was to make him Australia’s longest-serving prime minister.\n\nThe lessons Menzies learned — and the way he applied them — made him a model that every Liberal leader since has looked to for inspiration. But debate over Menzies’ life and legacy has never settled.\n\nWho was Robert Menzies, what did he stand for, and what did he achieve? To find out, Troy Bramston not only researched the official record and published accounts, but also interviewed members of Menzies’ family, and his former advisers and ministers. He was also given exclusive access to family letters, as well as to a series of interviews that Menzies gave that had never been revealed before.\n\nNow with a new preface, Robert Menzies contains important contemporary lessons for the Liberal Party, and for those who want to understand and master the art and science of politics.\n\nTroy Bramston\n\nTroy Bramston is a senior writer and columnist with The Australian newspaper. He was previously a columnist with The Sunday Telegraph.\n\nHe is the bestselling author or editor of eleven books, including Bob Hawke: demons and destiny (2022), Robert Menzies: the art of politics (2019), and Paul Keating: the big-picture leader (2016). Troy co-authored The Truth of the Palace Letters (2020) and The Dismissal (2015) with Paul Kelly. He is currently writing a biography of Gough Whitlam.\n\nTroy’s biography of Bob Hawke was shortlisted for the Australian Political Book of the Year Award. He was the co-winner of the Australian Book Industry Award for The Dismissal. His biography of Paul Keating was a finalist for the Walkley Award, shortlisted for the National Biography Award, and longlisted for the Australian Book Industry Award. He was awarded the Centenary Medal for services towards the centenary of federation commemorations in 2001.\n\nHe lives in Sydney with his wife, Nicky, and two children, Madison and Angus."
