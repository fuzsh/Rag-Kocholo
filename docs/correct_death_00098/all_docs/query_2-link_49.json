        "text": "First published in The Age on August 28, 1991\n\nIt is half a century today from the climax of one of the most bitter feuds in Australian political history. GIDEON HAIGH explores the events that almost destroyed Robert Menzies' career and gave rise to the Liberal Party.\n\nAS HE moved serenely among the statesmen and savants of the Imperial War Cabinet in May 1941, Robert Menzies nursed an unspeakable dread.\n\nAfter four months of the intimate parlez he relished with the Empire's key figures, only in his diary could Australia's Prime Minister confide.\n\n\"A sick feeling of repugnance and apprehension grows in me as I near Australia,\" he wrote. \"If only I could creep quietly into the bosom of the family and rest there.\" Slender election victory in September 1940 had prolonged a troubled tenure, but he recalled his wife's words when first he had considered the trip. \"If you feel you must go, you will go,\" she had said. \"But you will be out of office within six weeks of your return.\" Her sense was acute. Menzies' year would end with him in exile, his United Australia Party beyond salvation, its coalition with the Country Party riven. Almost incidentally his country would be at war with Japan, as well as Germany.\n\nRecollection of Menzies' fall shows how memory deceives. As Norman Lee put it: \"It is hard for young people in Australia after more than a generation during which Sir Robert Menzies bestrode the political stage ... to understand the loathing with which counterparts 40 years ago regarded him.\" The young Menzies of 1941 was an adroit politician, but a wretched populist. Leaving Australia rudderless to spend four months in Europe was a gaffe that took years and his formation of the Liberal Party to redeem.\n\nPaul Hasluck put it delicately when he said Menzies \"forgot that in Australian politics as in domestic life, even the master of the house has to help with the dirty dishes\". Winston Churchill was more vehement: \"He loathes his own people. He wants to be in England. You cannot hope to be PM of a people you don't like.\" Menzies' reception on 28 May 1941 in the House can only have added to his Anglophilia. He saw again the two independents, Arthur Coles and Alex Wilson, whose support sustained his Government, and a derisory muster of half his ministers who deepened his isolation as he spoke.\n\nEven today political etiquette would not begrudge a returned PM one speech to lord it over his peers. But on 28 May, jaws slackened and chins sank along Government benches in attitudes of boredom. Menzies' nemesis, the CP's Earl Page, snored.\n\nMenzies again lamented the Lilliputian intrigues of party politics. \"When I stepped from the flying boat I said I felt sick that I had to come to Australia to political strife,\" he said, to Labor protests. \"These interjections prove the realities of war have not struck home.\" But Labor protested rightly. His nominal rival John Curtin had kept a delphic silence throughout Menzies' absence to preserve \"stability\", despite his colleagues' hunger to exploit the Government feud (and that his forbearance had almost cost him his seat in 1940).\n\nFor the next two months as he exhorted Australians to fight the distant war, Menzies spent as much time deflecting the barbs of Page and UAP apostles Bill McCall and Bull Hutchinson.\n\nBut he found sympathisers, including Arthur Coles _ a pillar of the great retail family and \"very independent\" member for Henty _ who began attending UAP meetings. Having like Menzies visited London that year, Coles amplified the \"Win the War\" message at rallies and kept a troth of support to the PM.\n\nSOME were less committed. In a 1971 interview for National Library archives, Coles told of an ingenuous \"sounding out\" by MHR Eric Spooner: \"What would be your attitude if the Prime Minister resigned?\" \"Has Bob indicated he's going to resign?\" asked a puzzled Coles.\n\n\"Few men had undergone and survived such a baptism of fire in the realities of political warfare as had Menzies\"\n\nW.F. Mandle\n\n\"No,\" Spooner replied. \"Not yet.\" Coles twigged. \"If you do this thing,\" he said, \"you will lose my support\". But blood was inevitable as Parliament resumed in August: the coalition war budget stalled and talk circulated that the PM might again \"need to go to England\".\n\nCurtin was needled into opposing the trip, and offers to share government. So on 28 August the fate of the budget, Menzies, and the coalition's tenure itself were in the hands of Page's band.\n\nIt still beggars belief that an administration should tear out its heart so deliberately. `The Age' commented on 28 August: \"The great majority of Australia wonder why any semblance of a crisis should have occurred.\n\nThey never wished it or saw need for it.\n\n\"There was only one course by which the Government could have saved itself,\" wrote Hasluck. \"That was to prove its solidarity and capacity to carry on. To that end it would have to sink differences, end dissension and submerge personal ambition.\" But the dissenters saw but one object to be sunk, ended and/or submerged: Menzies. Cornered by his Cabinet that evening, the PM finally asked: should he resign? \"Within half an hour I had my answer,\" he wrote. \"Not from all, but from enough.\" Menzies dissolved the meeting for dinner and, on a reflective walk in the garden of the Lodge, pondered compromises offering dignified withdrawal. When Cabinet reconvened at 9pm, he floated one: if members supported the budget, Menzies would \"offer himself for re-election\".\n\nFeet shuffled, a few shoulders shrugged, but a clear voice dispelled the whiff of consensus. \"I am not in agreement,\" said Bill McCall. \"I've heard clearly what you've said. I wish you to understand what I'm going to say and if you don't I'll repeat it: \"I will take the first opportunity to defeat on the floor of the house any Government of which you are the leader. Is that clear?\" MENZIES blanched: \"Perfectly. I feel like I've lived 100 years.\n\nGentlemen, I offer you my resignation.\" Menzies' exit was as dignified as his later account of events was sketchy. \"I have lived long enough to learn,\" he wrote, \"it is a great part of wisdom to know what to forget\".\n\nArthur Coles could not forget. When UAP members met to hear of the resignation, he rose to challenge the chairman, Sir Percy Spender: \"It has always been my opinion that a party elects its own leader. Now you've had the resignation of the leader without any reference to the party. I believe that it has been forced by his colleagues in the Cabinet ... May I move that I nominate Mr Menzies for the leadership so the party can vote on the question?\" \"No,\" came the reply. \"Mr Menzies has resigned. We are here to elect a successor.\" \"In that case, I resign,\" Coles snapped, turning on his heel. He told reporters: \"I witnessed a lynching organised by mass hysteria. It was something so unclean that it will never be erased from my memory.\" The coalition met at 10.30pm and Fadden was PM by midnight, welcomed by a unrepentant Billy Hughes: \"Menzies couldn't lead a flock of homecoming pigeons.\" But the plotters had miscalculated. As much by the cruelty of Menzies' dismissal as by advisers, Curtin had been turned. So had Arthur Coles.\n\nOn 1 October Parliament was reduced to a shambles by the enfilade of debate. A tense coalition hung on every twitch of Wimmera independent Alex Wilson _ known to have been wooed by Evatt _but Coles it was who broke the suspense at 2.40pm."
