        "text": "An encounter with history books, rather than political rhetoric, leaves one shocked at the jaundiced portrait of Sir Robert Menzies in the public imagination.\n\nI speak from experience. The Menzies of my childhood and adolescence was a faintly ridiculous figure. Throughout my education in the 1970s and ’80s, anyone holding cultural authority – teachers, parents, writers, filmmakers, all vastly different people with myriad perspectives on the world – shared one thing: they had seen the enemy and it was Robert Gordon Menzies."
