        "text": "The Menzies Foundation has used the occasion of its 40th anniversary to look back at achievements and to usher in a new era with some significant\n\nchanges to its strategic direction.\n\nToday is the 40th anniversary of the announcement of a memorial to Sir Robert Menzies by then Prime Minister, Malcolm Fraser.\n\nMenzies Foundation Chair, Peter Jopling AM QC, speaking at a 40th anniversary dinner at the Melbourne Museum, said the Menzies Foundation wanted\n\n“to re-imagine and reawaken Sir Robert’s vision for a strong, knowledgeable Australia.\n\n“We have a 40-year track record of backing outstanding Australian leaders who are willing to tackle intransigent problems – from mental health, cancer\n\nand autism, to global human rights issues and the depletion of natural resources.\n\n“On the occasion of our 40th anniversary we have reflected on how the Foundation can meaningfully contribute to the constructive dialogue to\n\nbuild a more successful nation. And it is that future we want to focus on if the Foundation’s work is to remain of value and benefit to the Australian\n\ncommunity of the 21st century,” Mr Jopling said\n\nThe Foundation has outlined three new areas of focus: entrepreneurship in science, leadership in our schools, and guiding Australia’s\n\nresponse to complex global legal issues.\n\nMr Jopling said the Foundation was committed to raising the profile and importance of support for\n\nAustralian entrepreneurial science and technology start-ups.\n\n“Over the next decade we will support a number of science entrepreneurs by establishing an incubator network and building a resource pipeline to support\n\nthese start-ups to go to market and then to scale.\n\n“In doing this we will build a greater understanding of what helps and hinders Australian science and technology start-ups. We will work with the science,\n\nbusiness and government sectors to share knowledge about the opportunities, barriers and impediments in this space to help others.\n\n“Our second area of focus is leadership in education.We aspire to dramatically improve student outcomes by enhancing leadership capability\n\nin Australia’s education sector,” Mr Jopling said.\n\nThe Foundation will soon release details of a partnership with the Graduate School of Education at the University of Melbourne.\n\nThe third area of focus sees a reshaping and modernising of the law scholarship named in honour of Sir Robert and former Governor General, High Court Justice,\n\nand Chair of the Menzies Foundation, the Right Honourable Sir Ninian Stephen.\n\nThe Sir Ninian Stephen Menzies Scholarship in Law will enhance Australia’s capacity to grapple with complex global issues.\n\n“We have sought to identify what are said to be the most pressing legal issues confronting Australia to ensure our scholars develop a practical capability\n\nto deal with such issues and share their knowledge widely.” Mr Jopling said.\n\n“For the next three years, the Sir Ninian Stephen Menzies Scholarship in Law will focus on the legal implications of cybersecurity breaches\n\nfor the nation. Cybersecurity breaches have grave implications for our citizens and community, the government and business sector.We very much look\n\nforward to our scholars making an important contribution in this field of endeavour.”\n\nMr Jopling, who was an associate of Sir Ninian, said he would have been intrigued by the complexity of this rapidly growing international challenge. The\n\nHonourable Justice Susan Kenny, also a former associate of Sir Ninian’s will chair the scholarship selection committee. The scholarship will open for\n\napplications later in 2018.\n\n“Like our namesake, the Foundation is committed to supporting leadership initiatives to make a difference. We will continue to strive for a stronger, more\n\ninformed and knowledgeable Australia,” Mr Jopling said.\n\nTo mark the 40th anniversary, the Menzies Foundation has also released ‘Taking the lead: 40 stories of impact’ focusing on the achievements of\n\nmany of its scholars and fellows as well as the significant contribution made to the establishment of the four Menzies health and medical research\n\ninstitutes.\n\nFrom peacekeeping in Iraq to leading research into finding the cure for Motor Neurone Disease or helping parents and children on this autism spectrum by\n\nidentifying their symptoms early, the Menzies Scholar and Fellows continue to make their mark as Australian leaders.\n\nResources"
