        "text": "The Shire of Menzies covers 128,353 sq. kms from just east of Payne’s Find to Tjuntjuntjara and the South Australian border. The town of Menzies is the administrative centre, with a population of 108 in the 2016 census. The total population of the Shire is about 570, including the local aboriginal people of the Kaburn Bardu group. Menzies is located 728 kms from Perth and 133 kms North of Kalgoorlie. Robert Leslie Menzies, for whom the town was named, was an American prospector, one of the first mining leaseholders in the district.\n\nThe first discovery of gold was in 1894, with the lease of the Lady Harriet Mine in September by Brown, Kirby and Jackman. In October, the larger Lady Shenton Mine opened and a major rush followed. The town soon boasted drapers, a general store, produce merchants and a carrier. The townsite was gazetted in August 1895, the rail from Kalgoorlie opened in 1898 and by 1900 the population was approximately 10,000, catered for by 13 hotels, 2 breweries and 4 churches. There were 320 mining leases within a 6 km radius of the Post Office. Water supply came from underground and nearby lakes, until the dam was constructed in 1901.\n\nThe rush lasted about 10 years with a decline from about 1901. By 1903, the Lady Shenton Mine had produced 132,000 ounces of gold. By 1910, the population had fallen to less than 1000. Current mining of reef gold continues at Riverina, Mt Ida, Lake Rebecca and Lake Carey. The pastoral industry is the other main employer in the Shire.\n\nThe cemetery (Reserve 3348), located 2 kms NW of the town, is one of the largest in the Goldfields and is of particular interest for the number of highly decorative tin memorials, made by local blacksmiths. This style of memorial is unique to Menzies and found only in Reserve 3348, surveyed 7 May 1896. The site was gazetted in August 1896. Until the last burial in 1939, a total of 575 interments had taken place. The graves bear testament to the harshness of life on the Goldfields, with numerous deaths from accidents, illness (mainly typhoid), alcoholism and suicide. The high number of childhood deaths are indicative of the difficulties of life here in those early times. There is also an older cemetery located just to the west of the town, where there are possibly as many as 30 graves.\n\nThere are many other small cemeteries in the Shire at Callion (Speakman Find), Comet Vale, Davyhurst, Edjudina, Eucalyptus, Goongarrie, Mount Ida, Kookynie, Mulline, Mulwarrie, Niagara, Pindinnie, Pinjin, Siberia (Waverley), Tampa, Ullaring, Yarri, Yerilla and Yundarindera. Numerous lonely graves are also dotted over the landscape and many more who were buried where they died, often of thirst or exposure, will never be found, as termites, weather, road construction, mining and the passage of time have erased any sign of their graves.\n\nDISCLAIMER:\n\n“Owing to the destruction of all Menzies records in the fire of July 1896, when the office of the Menzies Town Clerk was burned, this list has diligently been compiled from various sources by Deb Pianto, of the Menzies CRC. OGM is grateful for the opportunity to use this resource to help us in our work.”"
