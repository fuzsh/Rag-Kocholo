        "text": "Robert Menzies (20 December 1894 – 15 May 1978) was Prime Minister of Australia from 26 April 1939 to 29 August 1941 (succeeding Earle Page and preceding Arthur Fadden) and from 19 December 1949 to 26 January 1966 (succeeding Ben Chifley and preceding Harold Holt).\n\nBiography[]\n\nRobert Menzies was born in Jeparit, Victoria, Australia in 1894, and he graduated in law from Melbourne University, becoming a successful lawyer from 1918 and receiving the prestigious appointment of a King's Counsel in 1929. He became a member of the state parliament of Victoria as a member of the Nationalist Party of Australia and of the United Australia Party, and was attorney-general and solicitor-general for the state from 1932 to 1934. In 1934, he moved to national politics and was elected to the federal parliament, whereupon he was immediately appointed Attorney-General, while becoming deputy leader of the UAP in 1935. Increasingly frustrated by Joseph Lyons' style of leadership and his grip on power, he resigned from Cabinet on 14 March 1939, but became Prime Minister four weeks later after Lyons' sudden death. Unlike his predecessor, he did not command universal rank-and-file support. Squabbling within the Cabinet and with his coalition partner, the Country Party, led to his defeat at the 1941 elections, against the energetic John Curtin."
