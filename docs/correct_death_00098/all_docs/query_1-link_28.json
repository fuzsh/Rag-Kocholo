        "text": "Despite the general support for Australian involvement, in the early years the war still seemed distant. People were reluctant to make sacrifices. This was especially the case during the period between the Allied declaration of war in September 1939 and the beginning of major military operations, a time often referred to as the ‘Phoney War’. Menzies had called for a business-as-usual attitude during this period, but in mid-1940, as German troops marched through Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg on their way to Paris, the Prime Minister would have great difficulty shifting the nation’s outlook to that of a ‘total war’ home front.\n\nActivities\n\nAsk students about the nature of Australia’s relationship with Britain that led it to follow Britain into war.\n\nMenzies famously described himself as ‘British to my boot heels’. Have students investigate Menzies’ heritage. Ask them whether there was a perceived conflict between being ‘British’ and being ‘Australian’ at the time.\n\nDivide the class into groups and have them discuss the concept of ‘a ‘just war’. Ask them to investigate ‘just war theory’ as presented by Cicero and Thomas Aquinas.\n\nNext, have the groups consider the following questions:\n\n• Do you agree that a ‘just war’ can exist?\n\n• Was World War II ‘just’?\n\n• Does it differ from subsequent conflicts in this sense?\n\n• Would you have enlisted to fight the Nazis in World War II? What about Vietnam? Iraq? Afghanistan?\n\nAsk students to imagine they are speechwriters for a head of government in September 1939. They have been asked to draft an address to the nation, following the declaration of war against Nazi Germany. Ask them what types of words they would use and what the tone of the speech would be. Ask them how and why their speeches would be different from Menzies’ speech.\n\nAsk students to write a short speech and swap it with a classmate, who will then deliver it."
