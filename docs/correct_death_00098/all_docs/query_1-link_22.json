        "text": "In the death of Sir Robert Menzies, the United States has lost a firm friend and Australia a great leader.\n\nSir Robert's career of public service began half a century ago. He stood by the United States in three wars, and was instrumental in establishing the Australia-New Zealand-United States alliance (ANZUS).\n\nAfter his retirement from public life, he continued to work at strengthening the ties of friendship that bind our countries-serving for a year as scholar-in-residence at the University of Virginia.\n\nI join with Sir Robert's family and nation in mourning his passing."
