        "text": "Darwin had been a strategic port on Australia’s northern edge for decades, but in the mid-1930s a major military build-up began. By 1942, the population had more than tripled, with around 7,500 troops stationed in Darwin.\n\nThe military build-up prior to the Second World War triggered significant upgrades to the Stuart Highway. It was transformed from a rough dirt track to a major supply road.\n\nIn 1940, a booming economy saw the opening of two new banks on Smith Street in central Darwin, the Bank of New South Wales and the Commonwealth Bank.\n\nAfter Japan’s attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941, there was a growing realisation that an attack on Darwin was imminent. Under instruction from Prime Minister Robert Menzies' War Cabinet, over 2000 women and children were evacuated from the region by air, road and sea. The final evacuation aircraft left Darwin just one day before the first Japanese air raid.\n\nJust before 10am on 19 February 1942, 188 Japanese aircraft appeared over Darwin. The aircraft had taken off from four aircraft carriers in the Timor Sea. The air raid sirens were sounded too late to give much warning. The attack was led by Commander Mitsuo Fuchida, who had also led the Japanese raid on Pearl Harbour.\n\nThe Darwin Commemorative Wall Quilt features 1,600 patches recording the names of almost 2,000 civilians, defence personnel, nurses, police, volunteers and evacuees who spent time in the Northern Territory during the war years. It was developed by Jenny Armour, a former librarian at the Northern Territory Library in 1992 for the 50th Anniversary of the Bombing of Darwin.\n\nClick here to reveal a map of places of interest you might like to visit relating to the Bombing of Darwin."
