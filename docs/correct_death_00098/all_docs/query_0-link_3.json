        "text": "The Prime Ministers' Memorial Garden in Melbourne General Cemetery was built to house the remains of prime ministers and their spouses. Sir Robert Menzies was cremated at Springvale Cemetery in 1978, and liked Springvale as his final resting place but his remains did not end up there.\n\nWhen Dame Pattie died, senior Liberals decided something fitting had to be done to honour the couple.So they encouraged the cemetery trustees to establish the memorial garden and inter the cremation ashes of the couple there.\n\nThe memorial garden cost $300,000 and it is said to be the brainchild of Jeff Kennett and Ron Walker. Sir Robert Menzies was the longest serving prime minister in Australia's history, having served in that position in 1939–41 and from 1949 to 1966. The memorial garden was opened by Prime Minister John Howard and Premier Jeff Kennett on 7 June 1996.\n\nIn late 1997 a memorial to Harold Holt was erected. Holt became Prime Minister on Menzies' retirement in 1966. Holt drowned while swimming in the surf near Portsea in December 1967. So this is a symbolic grave. The memorial includes the inscription ‘He loved the sea’.\n\nSome people believe that this is odd considering the way he perished, and the naming of a swimming pool after Holt in Glen Iris is considered even more quirky. His wife Zara Holt is buried in the Sorrento Cemetery.\n\nThere were all sorts of rumours about Holt's disappearance, including the involvement of foreign countries, however an inquest concluded that Holt drowned. This was not Holt’s first brush with drowning, and it is known that he was suffering from a persistent shoulder injury when he went into the surf on that fateful day.\n\nSir John Grey Gorton entered federal parliament as a Victorian Senator in 1949. He became leader of the Liberal Party and Prime Minister in January 1968 following the death of Harold Holt. He was the only Senator ever to hold that position.\n\nHe resigned from the Senate and contested the by-election for Holt’s former seat. He was Prime Minister until March 1971 and then left politics in 1975. He died in May 2002.\n\nThis grave contains Gorton’s ashes. Gorton was considered a larrikin; he had a craggy face as a result of an injury in the Second World War. He was a strident nationalist, unlike many other earlier prime ministers, and he displayed this, for example, in encouraging the establishment of an independent Australian film industry.\n\nNot far from the Prime Ministers’ Memorial Garden, along Entrance Avenue, is another grave of a prime minister: James Scullin. James Scullin was the Labor prime minister during 1929–32, when the country experienced the full force of the world economic depression.\n\nJames Scullin was the first Australian-born Labor prime minister and Australia’s first Catholic prime minister, as well as the first Australian prime minister to come from an Irish background. His monument is fittingly topped with a Celtic cross.\n\nIn the face of overwhelming financial challenges, Scullin’s government was severely defeated at the election in December 1931. Scullin was elected the federal member for Yarra in 1922 and resigned the leadership of the Labor Party in 1935. Scullin's monument was erected by the Australian Labor Party and the Australian Council of Trade Unions."
