Sir John McLeay) took the chair at 2.30 p.m., and read prayers.\n\npage 51\n\nQUESTION\n\nREFERENDUMS\n\nMr CALWELL:\n\nMELBOURNE, VICTORIA\n\n– I ask a question of the Prime Minister. Does not section 128 of the Commonwealth Constitution provide that a proposed law for the alteration of the Constitution shall be submitted to the electors in each State not less than two nor more than six months after its passage through both Houses of the Parliament? Is not the Government, in abandoning the referendum to have been held on 28th May, flouting not only the mandatory provisions of the Constitution but the clearly expressed wish of both Houses?\n\nMr HAROLD HOLT:\n\nPrime Minister · HIGGINS, VICTORIA · LP\n\n– The Government examined the legal position very closely before coming to the decision that was recommended by me to the House last night and to which public reference was made some time ago. I can assure the honorable gentleman that the advice of our own legal authorities was to the effect that it was within the competence of the Government to refrain from the issue of the writ. The Government is not required in a mandatory sense to do so but, at the same time, it was, as I stressed in my statement last night, deeply conscious of the obligation it has to the Parliament in this matter. This was one reason why I included in what I knew to be a very lengthy statement a quite detailed account of the reasons for our action.\n\npage 51\n\nQUESTION\n\nSCHOOL CADETS\n\nMr COCKLE:\n\nWARRINGAH, NEW SOUTH WALES\n\n– I direct a question to the Minister for the Army. I ask: Has the Department of the Army set a ceiling for the number of school cadets to be trained? If so, is this ceiling influenced by financial considerations or the availability of instructors? Finally, is the cadet corps regarded as an integral and important segment of our defence organisation and, if so, is it to be further developed?\n\nMr Malcolm Fraser:\n\nWANNON, VICTORIA · LP\n\n– To answer the last part of the honorable member’s question first the Government and the\n\nArmy do regard the cadet corps as forming a significant part of the general defence framework of Australia. A number of cadets who go to the Royal Military College at Duntroon and to the Officer Cadet School at Portsea say they get their motivation for this kind of life and profession through the school cadet corps. The position is that the cadet corps does operate under a ceiling but it is a rising ceiling. The number this year is 41,700 and it will rise to 45,000 in 1967-68. There are two or three considerations involved in the limitation. Finance comes into the matter because the ceiling involves part of the overall defence framework. I do not think the numbers are decided purely by the Army, so finance is one consideration. With the current expansion the Army clearly has been stretched in supplying officers and non-commissioned officers. This is, and will be, another requirement that must be met. That is an additional limiting factor. In some areas appropriate facilities are not always available for cadets. But within these limitations, in general, the Cadet Corps is regarded as being important and valuable.\n\npage 51\n\nQUESTION\n\nIMMIGRATION\n\nMr DALY:\n\nGRAYNDLER, NEW SOUTH WALES\n\n– Has the attention of the Minister for Immigration been drawn to reports that trade relations may be terminated and Australians expelled from tha Philippines following the failure of tha Department of Immigration to approve an application for the admission to Australia of a prominent citizen of Manila? If so, will he give full details of the matter to tha House so that all may be fully informed on this important subject?\n\nMr OPPERMAN:\n\nMinister for Immigration · CORIO, VICTORIA · LP\n\n– I have seen statements of that kind, but always they have been attributed to newspaper correspondents. At the official level there has been nothing of that kind whatsoever. Mr. Locsin’s case was considered by the Department. It has been stated that he was a citizen of outstanding capacity and quality. We have nothing against Filipinos coming to Australia. As a matter of fact, some have been naturalised; some are living here now. Recently an outstanding Filipino citizen and his family were allowed in. There has been no actual prejudice against Filipinos as such.\n\nHowever, we have the right, under our immigration policy, to look at applicants for entry to Australia and the possibility of their obtaining satisfaction in this country. Just lately we have had the experience of a Filipino citizen who came to Australia on the basis that he was qualified for a certain type of work but who, when he arrived, was not satisfied with what was offered to him. He believed that discrimination had been shown. Although Mr. Locsin probably has some academic qualifications, they had not been proved in practical terms. He was employed with a banking institution as a clerk. Of course, we have nothing against that. But we in Australia do not advertise outside Australia for bank clerks; such employees are recruited from inside the country. When all the circumstances were taken into account, it was decided that the terms of our immigration policy did not permit Mr. Locsin to come as one who could be satisfactorily settled in Australia. No racial considerations entered into this particular case.\n\npage 52\n\nQUESTION\n\nBLUE TONGUE DISEASE\n\nMr MACKINNON:\n\nCORANGAMITE, VICTORIA\n\n– My question is addressed to the Minister for Health. I refer to an article that appears in a leading Sydney journal of today’s date and in which it is stated -\n\nBlue tongue disease was reported to have been found on a Queensland cattle property.\n\nIn view of the serious implication of this suggestion for Australia’s sheep population, is the Minister in a position to inform the House of the substance of the matter and confirm what I believe to be the truth, that is, that at no time was there an outbreak of blue tongue disease and that action taken by the veterinary authorities was purely precautionary?\n\nDr FORBES:\n\nMinister for Health · BARKER, SOUTH AUSTRALIA · LP\n\n– I saw the article in question. The honorable member’s belief about a reported outbreak of blue tongue disease is correct. There was not an outbreak. What happened was that some semen was illegally imported into Australia from Canada and several cows were inseminated with it. That semen could have contained blue tongue disease, and it would have been highly undesirable to take the risk of allowing the disease to become established and to spread. I should say that the determination of whether the disease is present involves quite a lengthy process. Because blue tongue is a virus disease that may be transmitted by biting insects, such as midges, there is a danger that before its existence can be established it will spread and never be capable of being brought under control. The tests in the present case proved to be negative. The semen did not contain blue tongue. Nevertheless, the immediate slaughtering of stock and the fogging action taken to get rid of the insects in the area were vitally important precautions, particularly when it is remembered that if this disease became established in Australia it is almost certain that it could never be eradicated. This has been the experience in the United States and it would almost certainly be ours. In view of the great dependence of this country on the sheep industry, which is the industry mainly attacked by blue tongue, I am sure that all honorable members will agree that the precautions taken in this case were vitally necessary.\n\npage 52\n\nQUESTION\n\nTERRITORIAL LIMITS\n\nMr BENSON:\n\nBATMAN, VICTORIA\n\n– My question to (he Prime Minister relates to the three miles off shore limit. Is the right honorable gentleman aware that many countries have extended the three miles off shore limit to 12 miles? As the Australian continental shelf extends in many places beyond the three miles limit, I ask the honorable gentleman: What steps would be necessary to preserve oil interests and fishing interests which lie beyond this limit?\n\nMr Harold Holt:\n\n– I will ask the Attorney-General to answer the question.\n\nMr SNEDDEN:\n\nAttorney-General · BRUCE, VICTORIA · LP\n\n– Different countries have different attitudes towards territorial limits. The territorial limit is quite a different matter to the continental shelf. The matter of territorial limits has been the subject of international discussion for some years. The continental shelf was the subject of a convention concluded a few years ago. It is pursuant to the international law expressed in that convention that the Commonwealth and the States are now coming towards the end of a project for joint legislation to deal with the exploitation of the submerged areas of the continental shelf.\n\npage 53\n\nQUESTION\n\nFILM ON CHANGI PRISONER OF WAR CAMP\n\nMr TURNBULL:\n\nMALLEE, VICTORIA\n\n– I address a question to the Prime Minister because I regard this matter as one of great national importance. Will the right honorable gentleman make investigations with a view to making known whether the film “ King Rat “, currently being screened in Australia, is a true record of events in Changi prison camp, Singapore, or a money making project to the detriment of the reputation of many Australians and others who served in Malaya and who were imprisoned in Changi? If the Prime Minister will make the investigations as requested, will he make his findings the subject of a statement in this House?\n\nMr HAROLD HOLT:\n\nLP\n\n– I have no personal knowledge of the film referred to. I have merely seen some references in the Press to the fact that it is being screened in this country. In my experience most films, whether they are documentaries or fictional, are money making projects, so I assume that the film referred to by the honorable member is being screened for purposes of profit. I shall see whether I can secure information for the honorable gentleman as to whether the film purports to be an accurate and factual account of conditions in Changi camp. If this is not the case I shall consider whether it is appropriate for me or some other member of the Government to give some publicity to this finding.\n\npage 53\n\nQUESTION\n\nAUSTRALIAN OVERSEAS SHIPPING LINE\n\nMr DUTHIE:\n\nWILMOT, TASMANIA\n\n– I direct a question to the Minister for Shipping and Transport. Has the Government yet decided to establish an overseas shipping line, a proposition which hit the headlines after the Parliament went into recess on 10th December? Is the Government asking private companies in Australia, such as the Broken Hill Pty. Co. Ltd., Howard Smith Ltd., the Adelaide Steamship Co. Ltd., and R. W. Miller (Holdings) Ltd., to operate jointly or singly a fleet of bulk cargo carriers for overseas service? What finally prompted the Government to start this examination of an overseas shipping line, which the Labour Opposition has been seeking for the past 17 years?\n\nMr FREETH:\n\nMinister for Shipping and Transport · FORREST, WESTERN AUSTRALIA · LP\n\n– On a number of occasions I have explained to honorable members opposite and to this House that the Australian Coastal Shipping Commission Act contains power for Australian National Line ships to trade overseas as and when the Commission sees fit. Legislative authority for Australian ships to trade overseas is already in existence. For quite a considerable time now the Government has been exploring ways and means of carrying cargoes overseas in Australian ships on a profitable commercial basis. Those ways and means are still being examined. As yet no final solution has been found.\n\npage 53\n\nQUESTION\n\nCOMMONWEALTH MOTOR VEHICLES\n\nMr BRIDGES-MAXWELL:\n\nROBERTSON, NEW SOUTH WALES\n\n– My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Supply. Is it a fact that Commonwealth vehicles have been directed not to use the new toll road between the Hawkesbury River and Mount White on the Pacific Highway? If this is so, could the Minister advise the House of the reasons for this decision? Alternatively, are negotiations at present under way with the New South Wales Government?\n\nMr FAIRHALL:\n\nMinister for Defence · PATERSON, NEW SOUTH WALES · LP\n\n– I am not precisely informed on the latest state of negotiations between the Commonwealth Government and the State Government in respect of this matter, but I believe that the Commonwealth is restricting its vehicles for the time being to preserve the status quo, pending discussions. I know that to this point of time Commonwealth vehicles, certainly cars, have been the guests of the State Government on the Sydney Harbour bridge, but in view of the extraordinary high cost of the expressway I should think that there has been a change of view there. However, in view of the fact that the State is constantly coming to the Commonwealth for additional funds and as its requests have always been met in the most generous fashion, I hope that the Premier of New South Wales will find it in his heart to agree that Commonwealth vehicles shall be the guests of the State Government on the expressway.\n\npage 53\n\nQUESTION\n\nWATER\n\nMr CONNOR:\n\nCUNNINGHAM, NEW SOUTH WALES\n\n– My question is addressed to the Minister for National\n\nDevelopment. I advert to the question which was directed to him yesterday by the honorable member for Mackellar relative to drilling for underground water in drought areas. Is the Minister familiar with the use by the United States Government geological survey of infra-red detector photographs taken from aircraft to locate fresh water hidden in natural underground reservoirs in arid regions by observing variations in heat radiations associated with such reservoirs? Will the Minister consider cooperating with the Governments of New South Wales and Queensland to finance the use of such established scientific principles in a systematic survey for undetected water in drought affected areas in those States?\n\nMr FAIRBAIRN:\n\nMinister for National Development · FARRER, NEW SOUTH WALES · LP\n\n– I am not personally aware of this particular method. I shall ask the Bureau of Mineral Resources to give me the details required by the honorable member and I shall pass them on to him. I point out that the search for underground water in Australia is conducted in the States by the State Governments, which have very competent bodies that are able to carry out this work, and in the Northern Territory by the Department of Territories. I understand that the New South Wales Government has just recently ordered one of the latest rigs available. I shall look at this other method and see whether we can get the States to carry out this work on those lines. I point out to honorable members that recently this Parliament made an allocation of some £500,000 to the States to enable them to carry out the search for underground water and also to carry out stream gauging. They should be able themselves, out of these funds, to carry out the kind of work mentioned by the honorable member.\n\npage 54\n\nQUESTION\n\nINVESTMENT INCENTIVES\n\nMr WHITTORN:\n\nBALACLAVA, VICTORIA\n\n– I address a question to the Treasurer. Has he seen the White Paper that was issued by the British Government in January of this year entitled “Investment Incentives”? Does the Australian Government intend to follow in whole or in part some of the very liberal incentives about to be given by the British Government to the manufacturing industries in the United Kingdom?\n\nMr McMAHON:\n\nTreasurer · LOWE, NEW SOUTH WALES · LP\n\n– I have not read the White Paper published by the United King dom Government on the new type incentives. I have had a resume of the Paper presented to me. 1 have ascertained that the United Kingdom Government has withdrawn the investment allowances from the taxation system and has instead decided on a selective method of grants, particularly in depressed areas, to build up investment and the capital equipment of companies. I have also asked the Treasury to investigate the merits of the Australian system as contrasted with the new system introduced by the British Government. If I find it necessary to do so, I will have no hesitation in making a statement to the House on this subject.\n\npage 54\n\nQUESTION\n\nORD RIVER PROJECT\n\nMr COLLARD:\n\nKALGOORLIE, WESTERN AUSTRALIA\n\n– My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Has a decision been reached regarding the request from Western Australia for further financial assistance for the Ord River project? If so, will the Prime Minister make the decision known within the next few days so that, if the request has been agreed to, full advantage can be taken of the coming dry season? Can the right honorable gentleman explain to the House why it has taken so long to analyse last season’s results if, as we were told previously, a very thorough examination was made of the economics of the whole project just prior to the Government’s refusal of financial assistance last year?\n\nMr HAROLD HOLT:\n\nLP\n\n– There has been no Cabinet consideration of this matter during my term of office. Honorable members will have gathered from the statement delivered to the House last night that we have been very heavily occupied on a variety of matters which, in point of urgency, have been more pressing for us than the Ord River project. However, we certainly retain our interest in this project and the possibilities associated with it. As has been pointed out to the House on earlier occasions, we expected to receive some guidance as to our future course of action from the information gained by those who were engaged in cultivation on the project. My colleague, the Minister for National Development, has been closely in touch with this matter. I expect to have some discussion with the Premier of Western Australia on Friday of this week and I assume that we will hear at an appropriate and not distant point of time from the Minister for National Development as to the next step the Government should take in its consideration of this matter.\n\npage 55\n\nQUESTION\n\nWATER STORAGE\n\nMr ARMSTRONG:\n\nRIVERINA, NEW SOUTH WALES\n\n– I direct my question to the Minister for National Development. In view of the serious limitation of water for irrigation in the Murray Valley, will the Minister, as a matter of urgency, call a meeting of the River Murray Commission to consider the construction of more dams to augment the supply of water available from the Hume reservoir and thus enable established irrigation areas to maintain full productivity?\n\nMr FAIRBAIRN:\n\nLP\n\n– The River Murray Commission is keeping a very close watch on the availability of water in the River Murray. The Commission will meet in just over a fortnight’s time to discuss this question. The honorable member referred to increased storages. I point out that four governments are involved in this matter. The Commonwealth has only a quarter share and, if a decision is reached to build a new dam, it must affect every one of the four governments. But I would point out also that we are building at the present moment at Chowilla a dam which will hold five million acre feet when it is completed in 1969, In addition, the first water has just been turned into the Murray from the Snowy River. When this scheme is operating fully I think an additional 800,000 acre feet per annum will be made available for irrigators in the Murray Valley. This water previously flowed to the sea. So it does seem to me that, in the immediate future, the position of the River Murray should improve quite considerably.\n\npage 55\n\nQUESTION\n\nNATIONAL CONSERVATION AUTHORITY\n\nMr LUCHETTI:\n\nMACQUARIE, NEW SOUTH WALES\n\n– I ask the Minister for National Development: In view of the tragic situation which has been brought about because of the disastrous drought affecting valuable country throughout Australia, will the Minister favorably consider now the establishment of a national conservation authority to deal with all the river systems of Australia? Will the Minister make such agreements with States and Territories as are necessary to implement this much needed proposal? Finally, will the Minister make a statement further indicating what action the Commonwealth Government intends to take with respect to the men who find that their services are no longer required on the Snowy Mountains project?\n\nMr FAIRBAIRN:\n\nLP\n\n– Mr. Speaker, I think the honorable member realises that the constitutional authority for developing and conserving water resources lies with the States and always has been with them. The Commonwealth has assisted in every possible way through the foundation of the Australian Water Resources Council and also considerable amounts of money have been made available for many projects throughout Australia. A great many of these projects have been financed by the Commonwealth Government. But unless and until we get any request from the States for action along the lines sought by the honorable member, this is a matter of policy and we would consider it only if asked to do so by a constitutional authority.\n\nThe honorable member mentioned the future of the Snowy Mountains Authority. Again, this is a matter of policy. All I can say is that, at the present moment, the Snowy Mountains Authority is very fully engaged. It is probably more fully engaged than at any time in its history. Many of the 1,500 or so men employed by the Authority will be engaged in work on the Snowy Mountains scheme for a long time to come. It is true that members of a very small branch - the Investigations and Research Branch in which there are about 40 people - are having to do, perhaps, a little less work on the Snowy scheme because this work is being reduced. But we have succeeded in finding most useful work for these men in many other projects. This Branch is at present designing a dam for the Liddell power station in northern New South Wales for the Electricity Commission of New South Wales. The Branch has done work in a number of other States in Australia and it is working also on roads in Bougainville, Thailand and in connection with the Mekong River. So, there is no shortage of work for these people at the present moment.\n\npage 56\n\nQUESTION\n\nMEDICAL SUPPLIES FOR VIETCONG\n\nMr Kevin Cairns:\n\nLILLEY, QUEENSLAND · LP\n\n– Is the Minister for External Affairs aware that a club at the Sydney University is to set up a fund known as the “ Vietcong Fund “ to supply medical supplies and assistance for the Vietcong? Will the Minister investigate this proposal and do his utmost to see that the very questionable intentions of this body do not give encouragement to the enemy, especially as the club is reported to be the Sydney University A.L.P. Club?\n\nMr Reynolds:\n\n– I rise to order, Mr. Speaker. That is quite incorrect. This is another organisation called the “ Labour Club “. The honorable member is misleading the House.\n\nMr SPEAKER:\n\n– Order! I call the Minister for External Affairs.\n\nMr HASLUCK:\n\nMinister for External Affairs · CURTIN, WESTERN AUSTRALIA · LP\n\n- Mr. Speaker, I have no personal knowledge of the facts alleged in the honorable member’s question but I will have some inquiries made. Any action that the Government takes will depend, of course, on the result of those inquiries.\n\npage 56\n\nQUESTION\n\nABORIGINES\n\nMr BEAZLEY:\n\nFREMANTLE, WESTERN AUSTRALIA\n\n– I desire to ask the Minister for Territories whether, in view of the decision of Sir Richard Kirby that certain categories of Aboriginal workers are to be paid in December 1968 wages equal to those paid to European workers, the Commonwealth Government is taking any steps to ensure the adequate nutrition of the families of these Aboriginal workers, as I think it is established that the wages paid to European workers in the Northern Territory are such as to enable them to meet the cost of living for their families. By definition, therefore, anything less does not meet the cost of living. Does the Commonwealth Government intend to take steps to ensure the adequate nutrition of the dependants of workers in the categories to which I have referred?\n\nMr BARNES:\n\nMinister for Territories · MCPHERSON, QUEENSLAND · CP\n\n– This decision of the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission was given only a few days ago. I have not had an opportunity to consider the whole judgment, but I point out to the honorable member that at all times the wellbeing of the Aborigines is of great concern to the Department of Territories.\n\nI believe that the delay which has been advised in the judgment of the Commission gives us a great opportunity, in a sense, to arrange for the transition of the Aboriginal employees of cattle stations, and to bring them up to the stage where we will have an organisation which will provide for their satisfactory assimilation into this system. Obviously a drastic change from their present standard to a much higher standard would cause considerable reaction.\n\nMr Beazley:\n\n– I know that, but I am talking about their dependants.\n\nMr BARNES:\n\n– This has to be considered along with the whole question. We will have to make a study of this matter. It is obvious that all Aborigines will not be employed on cattle stations. We may have to prepare our settlements to accept greater numbers to meet the needs of those who will not be adequately cared for. I can assure the honorable member that this matter is of great concern to the Administration. I have nothing further to add.\n\npage 56\n\nQUESTION\n\nHOUSING\n\nMr CLEAVER:\n\nSWAN, WESTERN AUSTRALIA\n\n– My question is addressed to the Treasurer. To stimulate finance for housing, as requested during the last few days by the Australia and New Zealand Bank Ltd. and also the Australian Clay Products Association Ltd., will the Treasurer inform the House when it is considered the effect of the $24 million to be released by the savings banks of Australia will actually be felt? I refer to the reference in the Prime Minister’s very helpful statement last evening. I ask further: What are the other measures to help housing to which the Prime Minister made reference? When approximately will detailed announcements of these proposals be made?\n\nMr McMAHON:\n\nLP\n\n– Already the Reserve Bank of Australia has asked the savings banks to make $24 million available during the balance of this financial year in order to get house building up to what we regard as a base or reasonable level. I cannot give precise figures, but it is hoped that within the first three months - that is the March quarter - there will be a substantial lift in both approvals and commencements. It is also thought that there will be a more significant lift during the last three months of this financial year. As to the second part of the honorable gentleman’s question, Treasury officers have been instructed to consider other ways and means of giving a boost to both approvals and commencements. I have not yet had a paper from the Treasury as to what we can do or, for example, as to whether it should be done through the Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement or through some other means. As soon as I have discussed the matter with my colleagues and the Prime Minister the House will immediately be informed.\n\npage 57\n\nQUESTION\n\nABORIGINES\n\nMr WHITLAM:\n\nWERRIWA, NEW SOUTH WALES\n\n– I direct my question to the Prime Minister. Now that the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission has made its award concerning Aboriginal employees in the pastoral industry in the Northern Territory, can he say when the Government will grant equal pay to Aboriginal employees of its departments?\n\nMr HAROLD HOLT:\n\nLP\n\n– I do not know what is involved technically in this matter.\n\nMr Bryant:\n\n– Money.\n\nMr HAROLD HOLT:\n\n– The honorable gentleman will discover that there are more things in life than money, and one of them is effective administration. Therefore, I shall see what information I can secure from the Public Service Board, if that is the appropriate body dealing with this matter -\n\nMr Whitlam:\n\n– There are civilian employees of the Army and the Air Force also.\n\nMr HAROLD HOLT:\n\n– I shall see what information can be secured from the appropriate authoritative source and shall give a considered reply to the honorable gentleman.\n\npage 57\n\nQUESTION\n\nRURAL FINANCE\n\nMr ROBINSON:\n\nCOWPER, NEW SOUTH WALES\n\n– My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Will speedy action be taken by the Government to implement the new policies relating to rural finance which he announced in the Parliament last night and which can be hailed as the beginning of a new era for primary industry in this country? When will banks have at their disposal the funds proposed to be made available under this new arrangement for long term lending? When will finance generally be available for the several categories to which he referred in his statement to the Parliament?\n\nMr Harold Holt:\n\n– The Treasurer will answer the question.\n\nMr McMAHON:\n\nLP\n\n– There have already been some negotiations with the Reserve Bank of Australia with a view to having the administrative arrangements completed so that the funds that were mentioned can be made available as soon as practicable. However, there first must be negotiations between the Prime Minister and myself and the Reserve Bank and the trading banks so that they can be acquainted with the Government’s wishes and so that we can get their full co-operation. We are already working on the details of the scheme which must, of course, be presented to Cabinet for final endorsement. We are treating this matter as one of great urgency and I hope that Cabinet and the Reserve Bank and the trading banks will be able to deal with it in the near future.\n\npage 57\n\nQUESTION\n\nQUARANTINE\n\nMr WENTWORTH:\n\nMACKELLAR, NEW SOUTH WALES\n\n– Has the attention of the Minister for Health been directed to the article in this morning’s “ Sydney Morning Herald” by Professor Campbell, Professor of Agricultural Economics at the University of Sydney, which criticises some aspects of the administration of the animal and plant quarantine service? Is the Minister aware that there is considerable dissatisfaction in regard to the difficulty of importing into Australia new strains of plants and animals for the improvement of our primary production? Has he any constructive suggestions to make as to the way in which these objections may be met without any breach of the security of quarantine or of the proper protection which quarantine gives us? Has he any plan to put before the House in relation to the valid and weighty points raised by Professor Campbell?\n\nDr FORBES:\n\nLP\n\n– I have seen the article but I do not agree with its conclusions. I note, for instance, that Professor Campbell is a Professor of Agricultural Economics, which no doubt qualifies him to speak expertly on some matters but his remarks do not necessarily carry great weight when he refers to matters which are more the province of, for example, a veterinarian or a plant breeder. The quarantine laws are based on the proposition that the admission into Australia of some of these exotic diseases - such as blue tongue, of which I spoke in answering the honorable member for Corangamite, and foot and mouth disease - could have an absolutely catastrophic effect on Australia’s livestock industries and therefore on the economic situation and prosperity of this country.\n\nI am afraid that I cannot go along with Professor Campbell’s statement that we in this country should learn to live with something like foot and mouth disease. As far as I know, there is no country which has either blue tongue or foot and mouth disease which would not be glad to be in our situation of not having them. I point out that it has been reliably estimated that production from livestock industries in a country with foot and mouth disease goes down almost immediately by 25 per cent. If we apply that figure to Australia and add the facts mat our meat trade with the United States, which is worth between $100 million and $150 million a year, would be cut off immediately and that our whole trade in livestock and meat with most places in the world would be cut off, I believe there is justification for a very strict and severe policy.\n\nProfessor Campbell suggests in his article that we have rather a static, unthinking approach to this matter and that the people responsible for quarantine do not recognise the value to the livestock industries and plant industries, for instance, of introducing new strains and new methods into Australia. I say that they do. It is a question of the balance of advantage in any particular case. To make the point I mention that in relation to blue tongue the quarantine authorities, together with veterinarians, have worked out a method by which bovine semen can be imported into Australia from the United Kingdom and New Zealand, provided that various precautions are taken for a period of two years.\n\nI make that point to show that there is not a static approach and that somebody who wants to improve the strains of our cattle in Australia can bring semen into the country. In relation to crossing Zebu cattle with northern cattle, a study is being undertaken in the hope of achieving the same purpose.\n\nMr Cope:\n\n– We want the previous Minister back.\n\nDr FORBES:\n\n– I have a reputation to live up to in this portfolio, and I intend to live up to it. I think I have said enough to show that the quarantine policy is necessary and that it is not static.\n\npage 58\n\nQUESTION\n\nABORIGINES\n\nMr BRYANT:\n\n– My question, which is addressed to the Minister for Territories, follows his answer, or lack of answer, to the question asked by the honorable member for Fremantle. Is the Minister satisfied that the Aboriginal employees who will be required to wait three years for adequate wages, presumably while they are qualifying as efficient workers, are in fact not qualified as efficient workers now? Could the Welfare Branch assess the qualifications of Aborigines and ensure that men who are already highly efficient are not being deprived of just payment? Will the Minister ensure that Aboriginal children are not being penalised in respect of education opportunities because of the low wages of parents? Why should these Aborigines have to wait three years?\n\nMr BARNES:\n\nCP\n\n– At the hearing by the Arbitration Commission the Commonwealth made very clear its ideas on what it required. It is our policy, of course, to bring Aborigines into complete equality with white Australians. We realise that there are problems after a very long period of inequality, but this Government has done more than any other Government before to bring about equality. It is no easy matter to advance people from a static position to equality with Europeans. We made our position clear. The union put its case for the Aborigines and the pastoralists put their case. The Commission, in its wisdom, has given these findings. I think it gave very close attention to this matter, which is a very important one, and I believe that we should abide by what is, in a sense, the umpire’s decision.\n\npage 59\n\nSIR ROBERT MENZIES\n\nRetirement\n\nMr HAROLD HOLT:\n\nPrime Minister · Higgins · LP\n\n– I move -\n\nThat to mark the retirement from this Parliament of our former colleague and member for Kooyong, the Right Honorable Sir Robert Gordon Menzies, K.I”., C.H., Q.C., after a distinguished public career encompassing six years in the Parliament of the State of Victoria, and over thirty-one years in membership of the House of Representatives, including sixteen consecutive years as Prime Minister, this House places on record its recognition of his long, able and devoted service to Australia, to the Commonwealth of Nations and to the institution of Parliament, and extends to bini and Dame Pattie Menzies its sincerest good wishes\n\nMr. Speaker, I am sure that members from all sections of the House, having learned of the retirement, after so long a period of service in this House, of Sir Robert Menzies, would welcome the opportunity which J now present to them of placing on record some expression of our appreciation of his services and of the admiration we feel for him and for his wonderful helpmate, Dame Pattie Menzies. As I indicated to the House yesterday, Sir, there will be an opportunity for the Parliament to meet Sir Robert and Dame Pattie personally at the dinner that we are tendering, as a Government, in their honour in this Parliament House on Thursday of next week. J felt - and my colleagues of the Government shared this feeling - that it would be appropriate if at the first available moment a resolution in the terms that I have put before the House were proposed, so as to provide an opportunity for some public expression of our sentiments in the Parliament itself and, in particular, in this House of Representatives, where the right honorable gentleman was such a distinguished member for so long a period of years.\n\nIt is not my intention, Sir, to give a detailed recital of the right honorable gentleman’s long record of achievement. There are in existence, of course, details of this kind in official and semi-official places. The “Parliamentary Handbook”, “Who’s Who “, the Press records of this country and the history of our times as written by various people all enshrine the achievements of the right honorable gentleman. To adopt a phrase which he himself sometimes employed, this is not an obituary occasion. The right honorable gentleman has retired from the service of this Parliament, but he is very much with us as a citizen of the Commonwealth - a very distinguished citizen. He will, I am sure, as long as breath abides in him, continue to seek ways in which he can be of some service to the nation he loves so well.\n\nSir, when one reflects on his life, one sees how remarkably long a period of our young Federation the public service of the right honorable gentleman has spanned. He came into this Parliament in 1934 but by that time he had already spent six years in the service of the Parliament of the State of Victoria. For more than half of the life of this Federation of ours he has been in a key political situation. He has been frequently at the centre of controversy. Indeed, it would be impossible to write a history of these times without having running through it, as a shining thread, the service and performance of Sir Robert Menzies. His retirement brings to an end what many people will regard - I number myself amongst them - as the most distinguished parliamentary career in the history of our nation - certainly a career which, in achievement of high office, has surpassed greatly that of any other Australian citizen. He had in the office of Prime Minister more than double the length of service of any other Prime Minister in the history of the nation. He served for 18 years as Prime Minister and for six years as Leader of the Opposition.\n\nAbout such a man - one of those rare persons who become legends in their own lifetimes - a certain mythology develops. I have read with some amusement from time to time, as I am sure he has, the descriptions of him which have appeared in either journals or the Press. As with other public figures - I am sure the Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Calwell) will agree with me on this - there is a similarity about some of these comments, as if they had proceeded from an authoritative source and had been taken up by other commentators as being authentic and accurately descriptive. But some of the comments which regularly have appeared about my former leader have been so far from the actualities as known by those of us who were close to him in the Cabinet that I thought I should make some reference to one or two of them.\n\nHe has been presented so often as an authoritarian figure, who left his Cabinet very little opportunity to make a contribution to the matters coming before it. Well, it is not customary to discuss what goes on in a Cabinet. Indeed, as Executive Councillors we are bound by oath not to disclose the details of our discussions, but I think I would not violate that principle in any degree if I made some mention of the manner in which the right honorable gentleman, as the head of the Government, saw his duties in the Cabinet. As my colleagues who have sat in the Cabinet of the nation know, far from discouraging the presentation of independent viewpoints around the table, he not only encouraged it but expected it. A great value we found ourselves deriving from his presence as Prime Minister was that as argument and debate unfolded around the Cabinet table he was able, with that calm, judicial quality of mind which is peculiarly one of his outstanding attributes, to pull the threads of argument together. With that mastery of exposition which has not been surpassed by any other public figure 1 have encountered anywhere in the world in my experience of public life, he would lay so clearly before us the pros and cons of argument that our task of decision became very much easier. We did not always agree with his judgment, yet he would accept cheerfully and readily the decision of his Cabinet when a majority opinion was obvious.\n\nSo one turns to other aspects of this mythology. There is the story that goes abroad about an aloofness of manner and a coolness of temperament. Again those of us who were close to him, as I was honoured to be for the whole period of my public life, know what a warm, friendly, charming companion the right honorable gentleman is to all who come intimately into contact with him. I know that in all sections of this Parliament, and certainly in the ranks of the Opposition in great number, there are those who are proud to call him friend and who can reflect today on many an incident in which they were personally involved in his friendship. His geniality, his good humour, radiated to all of them.\n\nI mention these things because here we speak as people who know him intimately and I would not have an unfavourable record linger any longer than public contradiction can prevent it from lingering.\n\nWhile discussing the conception that there was some aloofness or coolness of temperament associated with the Prime Minister I take my mind back - at a time such as this memories crowd into the minds oi all of us - to a time when he and I, in company with Dame Pattie, were making an inspection of the developments taking place at Weipa. While we were at the mission station at Weipa the Prime Minister called some Aboriginal children over to him. He sat there with an Aboriginal child on each knee, singing to them the song, “The Galloping Major “. I thought that if only we could have had the incident suitably recorded there would be many people around Australia who would entertain a very different view of this great man.\n\nThe oratory of Sir Robert Menzies has been the subject of admiring comment not only in his own country but around the English speaking world. I heard the former Presidential candidate Tom Dewey say - and I know that he had made this statement previously - that in Robert Menzies Australia had the finest orator in the English speaking world. A tribute of this kind, coming from a man who had been closely in touch with the great political figures of his time, was indeed a tribute worth recording. Lester Pearson, the Prime Minister of Canada, has described him as whole-souled and of an outgoing temperament, and the admiration which Sir Winston Churchill felt for our former colleague is, I think, widely known.\n\nThe right honorable gentleman had, as Australia realised throughout his years of national leadership and in the years when he was in Opposition, a mastery of exposition of the fundamental principles of our public life. He would, I think, regard as one of his own great achievements the foundation of a great political party which stands as a memorial giving expression to the high principles of public office for which he stood - the principles of policy and the principles of conduct. He stands in my mind as a man who has always kept his spirits high in adversity. I do not think I have ever admired him as much as I did through those years immediately following the election of 1961. His spirits seemed to rise with the challenge of near defeat and the prospect that defeat might face us in the future unless we could convince the community of the wisdom and appropriateness of our policies. Although this came towards the end of his long parliamentary career, he revealed a vigour, a strength of purpose, and an application of energy which were matters foi admiration by all of us who came closely in touch with him at that time.\n\nPolitics, it is said, is the science of the possible, and here is a science surely in which he greatly excelled. Cleverness, intelligence, wisdom - these are three terms which are not always clearly understood in their relation one to the other. We see cleverness in this place; we see some intelligence in this place, and more rarely we find wisdom. Not often do we find these three qualities embodied in the one man, but here is a man who embodies them, all in ample measure.\n\nHis political life covered a period of far reaching change in Australia, lt ran right from the period of the depression in the 1930’s, through the experience of war and into the era of national growth and peaceful development in the post-war years. He was a member of the Government which introduced the first £100 million Budget in Australia and was in the Parliament when the Budget of last year, amounting to more than £2,600 million, was introduced. This gives an indication of the enormous increase of the scope and diversity of the political activities of the Parliament in which he served.\n\nSir, if he had to specify those achievements in which he had found the greatest satisfaction, I think he would number amongst them the foundation of the Liberal Party and the alliances in the forging of which he had so important a part to play and which have strengthened the security of this country immeasurably. Then there is the love he has for Canberra, the capital of the nation, to the development of which he devoted so much of his time and thought. He must today be deriving great satisfaction from what he sees of the growth in beauty of the capital which is now attracting an increasing body of his fellow Australians as they come to see the work which we have performed here. Sir Robert Menzies must also have found great satisfaction in his achievements in the field of education which, until bis own time of leadership, had been regarded as almost exclusively a matter for the States. I am not overlooking, here, the valuable work which Mr. Dedman did in this field during his period in a ministry. But Sir Robert Menzies led the development of the Commonwealth’s interest in education and, in particular, the development of our universities and the provision of opportunities for young Australians to participate in the life of a growing number of Australian universities. This, too, would stand as one of the achievements he would prize.\n\nBut we, sir, think in our more reflective moments, of the contribution he has made to the quality of service and the rectitude of public service in this country. Here is a man for whom the word “ upright “ is so singularly appropriate that we found it running through the whole history of his administration. At no point of time can I recall an instance in which a member of his own Administration or, for that matter, a member of the Public Service, has come under public challenge for some impropriety. He, himself, insisted on the highest standards of integrity and rectitude, and he stands as a model for any member of Parliament or of an Australian Cabinet for the strict adherence he maintained at all times to what he regarded as the standards and requirements of his office. I mentioned earlier the great contribution which had been made to this notable parliamentary life by Dame Pattie Menzies. She has the affectionate admiration of all of us and on leaving the service of the Parliament for the pursuits that lie ahead of them he and she carry our warmest good wishes.\n\nThere was not a time when Sir Robert Menzies sought distinction for himself. I am quite certain he would have been very happy to have gone from the Parliament as Robert Menzies; but two distinctions very understandably possessed an irresistible appeal for him. One was the offer held out to him by Her Majesty the Queen of the Knighthood of the Thistle, this ancient Scots distinction of such outstanding order, the highest that has gone to any member of this country from a ruling monarch. Thc.i there was the distinction which, by virtue of its possession formerly by his old colleague Sir Winston Churchill - the Wardenship of the Cinque Ports - came his way as the result of an imaginative and friendly gesture from the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. This, too, he proudly received as a tribute not only to himself but also to the country he has been serving for all those years.\n\nWe hope that, in his retirement from the Parliament, and as he goes about his occasions which will in themselves bring great credit and distinction to Australia wherever he proceeds, he will carry the pleasure of these distinctions with him and we, in Australia, will be sharing in the happiness and the pride that he and Dame Pattie enjoy in them. Sir, a chapter of this notable life is concluded. There are many years ahead, we trust, for this great man, still in the vigour of mind and robustness of physique and temperament that saw him through so many arduous years of leadership in this Parliament. We shall, from all sections of the Parliament, be glad to join in the warmest good wishes to Sir Robert Menzies and Dame Pattie and it is with the greatest sincerity that we subscribe to the resolution I have put before the House.\n\nMr CALWELL:\n\nLeader of the Opposition · Melbourne\n\n– This, Mr. Speaker, is an occasion when even the ranks of Tuscany can scarce forbear to cheer. We are not speeding the departed guest. We have certainly no illusions about any mythology surrounding Sir Robert Menzies. To us he was a very real figure. He was tough. Hewas hard hitting. He was a brilliant debater. He was devoted to his cause and he fought for that cause. He fought against the Opposition of today as he fought, when Leader of the Opposition, against the Government of the day, for the things he believed in and we respect him for that fact. We were not so blind to reality on all occasions that we did not know that sometimes his argument was a little better than ours. But to use the vernacular, we mixed it with him and he mixed it with us. He was a doughty champion for his cause and, if we did not agree with all he said or did, we respected the way in which he put his case and the vigour with which he advanced his cause. When he retired quite recently I expressed the view that practically no member of the Opposition ever agreed with Sir Robert\n\nMenzies on any major issue of importance in the long and distinguished life be spent in this Parliament. I never agreed with him once on any issue of foreign affairs and rarely on any issue of domestic affairs, but that did not diminish my admiration for his qualities or my esteem for him personally.\n\nHe is the third Prime Minister of Australia to surrender the Prime Ministership. It is so bard a post to attain that nobody seems disposed to give it up too quickly. It might be said by some that he dallied longer than he should have. Perhaps in the interests of his own health he might have retired earlier. The three instances which I can call to mind of Prime Ministers voluntarily surrendering the Prime Ministership are those of Edmund Barton, who resigned to become a member of the first High Court of Australia; Andrew Fisher, who resigned to become Australian High Commissioner in London; and now Sir Robert Menzies, who has resigned to retire. There was only one Prime Minister in all our history who lost his seat while in office, and that was Stanley Melbourne Bruce. The rest retained their seats though their Governments were defeated, or died in office. In all, there have been only 17 to date.\n\nThe retirement of Sir Robert Menzies, because of his long career, has directed the attention of the Parliament and the people to a practice that could well be followed in future - the practice of the Parliament’s making some recognition for long and distinguished service. I am sorry that this idea was not adopted earlier, because I would have liked to see tributes paid to the Right Honorable Dr. H. V. Evatt for his services to this Parliament. When a man leaves the parliamentary sphere, whether to become Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of a State, to fill some other office or merely to retire, he is entitled, I believe, to the ungrudging respect and admiration of those who, while having been opposed to him during his career in politics, would like to savour in the life of politics some recognition of a man’s worth.\n\nThe motion contains some very fine sentiments. It seeks to place on record our recognition of the long, able and devoted service given to Australia by Sir Robert Menzies and also his services to the Commonwealth of Nations and to the institution of Parliament. 1 have always thought of Sir Robert Menzies most not for what he tried to do in foreign affairs - whether he failed or succeeded - and not for what he tried to do in domestic affairs, but for his record of service to the parliamentary institution. He sensed at all times that this institution must be guarded, that it must not be injured in the opinions of the people and that its dignity must be maintained. In that respect, he walked in the footsteps of the great parliamentarians in the tradition that we have inherited.\n\nThis motion also seeks to place on record a natural, normal, homely and human thing that ought to be said to all people everywhere who lay down their office, lt states that we wish Sir Robert and the good woman who stood beside him in adversity and success a long and happy life in retirement. What more could we wish them? What more could we want to wish them? We hope to hear from them occasionally. We know that they have merited their retirement and we trust that they will long be spared to enjoy it with their children and their growing family of grandchildren. I hope, too, that the former Prime Minister will find other opportunities to nurse children on his knee and sing to them the song “The Galloping Major”. I hope that he will have the opportunity to tell the people all that he wants to tell them at this particular time. As I said when Sir Robert Menzies retired, I hope that he will perform one last, enduring service to the political life of this nation by publishing his memoirs.\n\nMr McEWEN:\n\nMinister for Trade and Industry · Murray · CP\n\n– Mr. Speaker, I speak not only for myself but for all the members of my party - the Australian Country Party - in warmly supporting the motion proposed by the Prime Minister (Mr. Harold Holt). The day on which Sir Robert Menzies resigned from the office of Prime Minister of Australia will be recorded as a day of real significance in Australian history. His decision to retire was his own. It is not the privilege of every Prime Minister to go from that great office on his own decision. It is the fate of most to go involuntarily on the decision of others. But it is a matter for record that Sir Robert Menzies, having served this country as Prime Minister for 18 years - for more than 16 years continuously in his last period in office - himself voluntarily decided to call it a day. Surely he was entitled to do that. I think there would be few if any who would deny that his leadership of his party and of the coalition Governments that he led was really outstanding. Those of us who have served with him feel fortunate to have shared the lustre that attached to the period of office of himself and his Governments. We feel privileged to have enjoyed his friendship and to have absorbed the wisdom and experience of this very great man.\n\nIn personal terms, the period of leadership of Sir Robert Menzies was really phenomenal. He was completely preeminent on the political stage at home and he achieved, as few Australians have done or, maybe, will do, a stature of eminence as an international statesman - an elder statesman who was so regarded throughout the world, for he was widely regarded as an elder statesman not only in his own country and within the Commonwealth of Nations but beyond the bounds of that Commonwealth. This is due to many things. Not the least of them for a parliamentarian is the fact that his qualities of oratory are superb. Indeed, they are absolutely legendary.\n\nIt is undeniable, as I see it, that Sir Robert stood at the helm of the ship of state through a period of unparalleled growth and development. When one stands back and looks at what happened to Australia during the period of office of the Menzies Governments, this feature of unparalleled growth and development is the great factor. The period of the Menzies Governments will be remembered as a time of stable government. It undoubtedly has been a period of widespread prosperity for the nation and for all sectors of the people of the nation. These last 16 years will be recalled as those in which Australia really emerged in the eyes of the world as a proud, self confident nation - a respected nation in the community of nations. Under the Prime Ministership of Sir Robert Menzies, Australia was developed as a nation, balancing its devotion to the production of material wealth against its desire for educational and cultural advancement. One of the greatest things is that as it developed and grew richer it provided equal opportunity for every citizen. From our wealth as a nation, we contribute phenomenal sums to our own less fortunate people, be they less fortunate through age or through illness. Today, Australia speaks in the councils of the world on equal terms with the great powers, for Australia is providing leadership in contributing, from the resources that we have and the wealth that we produce, aid for the less fortunate people in foreign lands.\n\nWe now go along as a very homogeneous nation enjoying the leadership of unique, single purpose directed towards all those things which, fairly assessed, are good. All of this, be it remembered, has been achieved or has grown greatly under the Prime Ministership of Sir Robert Menzies. In his time as Prime Minister - this is a quite remarkable thing for me to be able to say - the population of the nation has grown by almost 50 per cent. Industrial development has taken place on a magnitude of scale completely undreamt of 17 years ago. Had one then predicted that 17 years hence Australia would be a great industrial country and the twelfth greatest international trading nation, one would, I think, probably have provoked derision. Today it is a fact. It is not a fact occurring by happy accident but has been achieved by planning, management and leadership.\n\nIn this context, I cannot refrain from recalling that during that period, Australia has achieved an efficiency in rural industry unmatched anywhere in the world in terms of production per unit of labour. These developments under Sir Robert’s leadership surely entitle him to take some relief from the burdens those labours have imposed. His retirement from office after such developments is indeed an occasion of real moment. It is also an occasion for those who have served with him in the Parliament, and indeed for the whole nation which has enjoyed the benefits of his great leadership, to express to him their appreciation of his many qualities. For myself and my colleagues in the Australian Country Party I say to him, “Thank you, Sir Robert Menzies “, and to Dame Pattie we extend our warm and affectionate good wishes.\n\nQuestion resolved in the affirmative.\n\npage 64\n\nSUPERANNUATION\n\nMinisterial Statement\n\nMr McMAHON:\n\nTreasurer · Lowe · LP\n\n– by leave - I am sure that all honorable members will be interested to learn how the work associated with the distribution of the surplus in the Commonwealth Superannuation Fund has progressed during the parliamentary recess. As my predecessor indicated when the enabling legislation was before the House late last year, the magnitude and complexity of this task is quite without precedent. It involves a complete reconstruction of contributors’ records, to take account of the reductions in rates of fortnightly contribution; a reassessment of the state of -the fund at 30th June 1962, having regard to those new contribution rates and the new assumptions about the Fund’s earnings in the future; and payments to contributors, to pensioners and to former contributors to the Provident Account.\n\nThe first payment, which honorable members may recall was foreshadowed in the second reading speech on the Superannuation Bill 1965, was an interim payment out of the surplus amounting to approximately $2 million to some 16,000 pensioners and I am happy to report that the target of commencing those payments before Christmas was realised. In fact, all the cheques were despatched within days of the Bill’s receiving royal assent and in time to reach pensioners about a week before Christmas.\n\nThe next step has been the recalculation of the accounts of all those who have contributed to the Provident Account, which forms part of the Superannuation Fund, since 1st July 1957, to give each contributor the benefit of the higher interest earnings actually achieved since that date. Benefits from the Provident Account are payable on termination of service and there are some 7,000 who have ceased to be contributors since 1st July 1957. They are being notified of the amount to which they are entitled and, because of the changes in address that take place over the years, they have been asked to confirm their current address on the claim form which is being sent to them. Notifications for contributors who ceased duty prior to 1st July 1965 have already been issued. The notifications for those who have retired since that date are being issued progressively over the next few weeks. Cheques for the amounts involved, ranging up to $1,040 and totalling some $806,000 will be posted on return of the completed claim forms to the Superannuation Board. Payment will be made to the widow or other survivor of those who have died. To enable prompt action to be taken as those who are now contributing to the Provident Account retire in the future, the additional amounts of interest since 1st July 1957 are also being credited at the same time to their accounts. In total, the sum involved is $1,034,000.\n\nAt the same time, but as a separate computer process, work has been proceeding on the adjustments that flow from the reductions in rates of contribution to the Superannuation Fund which have effect from 1st July 1962. This necessitates repricing the fortnightly contribution payable for each individual unit of pension taken up by the 120,000 current contributors during the period since the Fund was established - more than 40 years ago -and involves many millions of separate calculations. At the same time the new fortnightly contribution is being converted to decimal currency.\n\nThese new fortnightly rates of contribution for units held at 30th June 1965 will be introduced in the near future. The Superannuation Board has already circularised departments and statutory authorities to enable them to prepare for this task. Refunds of excess contributions will be calculated to 17th March and the new fortnightly rates of contribution will apply from 31st March 1966 onwards. The total to be refunded will amount to approximately $12,000,000 with individual payments averaging about $60. The arrangements for deductions from salaries at the new rates and for the individual refunds of excess contributions collected since 1st July 1962, will be made through normal departmental pay procedures.\n\nThe next step under the terms of the Superannuation Act 1965 is the recalculation of the surplus at 30th June 1962. The necessary statistical data for the actuarial calculations is being produced from the computer in association with these other calculations and the actuarial work of revaluing the fund and reassessing the surplus is expected to take about three months. The distribution to contributors of their share of the surplus assets at 30th\n\nJune 1962 and the final distribution of surplus to pensioners will then be made.\n\npage 65\n\nSOFTWOOD PLANTING\n\nMinisterial Statement\n\nMr FAIRBAIRN:\n\nMinister for National Development · Farrer · LP\n\n– by leave - On 24th February I announced the Government’s decision ito offer the States about $20 million in long-term loans over the next five years to help lift the planting rate in Government softwood plantations. Since forestry is a subject which will be new to many members I am making the following statement for the members’ information, to give them the background to the decision and the terms of the Commonwealth offer.\n\nForestry is a State matter and will always remain so, but now in the second half of this century we are realising that in forestry there is a national interest just as there is a State interest. Perhaps the greatest national interest from the point of view of the Federal Government is the effect that the timber industry has on our balance of payments. We have seen in the past year a tremendous demand for funds for the purchase of timber from overseas. In fact, I do not think there are many people in Australia who realise that we are spending over $200 million per annum on the importation of timber and forest products into Australia and this will rise substantially in the future.\n\nBefore I talk about the future, let me give the House the background of the present position in Australia. The area of productive native forests in use in Australia is approximately 30 million acres. Most of this area is hardwood forests, mainly eucalypts. There is less than half a million acres of native softwood forests. In addition there are about 700,000 acres of softwood plantations of which about 500,000 acres are governmentally owned and 200,000 acres are privately owned. About two thirds of the plantation area is pinus radiata.\n\nThe demand in Australia for timber and forest products is running at the equivalent of something like 500 million cubic feet of wood per annum of which about two thirds is produced locally and one third imported. This represents a factory door value approaching $600 million of which imports represent over $200 million. It is estimated that consumption will rise to 670 million cubic feet by 1975 and to over 1,100 million cubic feet by the year 2000. If forestry programmes are continued only at the current rate the annual yield of logs in Australia in 1975 would be less than 500 million cubic feet and would be of the order of 700 million cubic feet by the year 2000. On this basis it is estimated that the cost of imports required to maintain the supply of timber and other forest products, based on present costs, would be $280 million annually by 1975 and of the order of $600 million annually by the year 2000, the actual cost depending upon the rate of growth of population. However, it is most unlikely that future imports will be obtained at present day costs, lt is also by no means certain that overseas supplies will be available to fill our future requirements. Recent studies forecast increasing deficiencies between supply and demand for timber in the Asia-Pacific region and in Europe. A similar position will probably apply in Africa and it is likely that the United States of America will require virtually the whole of the exportable surplus from Canada by the end of this century.\n\nNew Zealand exports considerable quantities of timber and is the -main supplier of plantation softwoods to Australia. The Government recently concluded a free trade agreement with New Zealand which guarantees ultimate duty free trade between both countries for a wide range of products, including forest products. At present we obtain approximately 10 per cent, of our requirements in New Zealand and while we can look to increased supplies from New Zealand the estimated export availability from there in the year 2000 will still represent only 10 per cent, of the expected forest products market in Australia. Thus we cannot rely on ready availability of overseas supplies in the future and it is almost certain that the cost of imported supplies will increase substantially. I think all honorable members will agree that the Government would be remiss if it continued to count on overseas supplies to make up a deficiency as large as that at present forecast. This is the position facing Australia and it was basically because of this that the Commonwealth Government set up the Australian Forestry Council in consultation with the States. The Forestry Council is a national advisory body on forestry matters and a particular function is to look at ways of developing Australian forests to meet our requirements of timber and forest products both for our own use and for export. 1 had the great honour of chairing the first meeting in August 1964 which occurred shortly after I became Minister for National Development.\n\nThe Australian Forestry Council comprises the six State Ministers for Forestry, the Minister for Territories and the Minister for National Development. Under it is a standing committee consisting of the Director-General of the Forestry and Timber Bureau, the head of each of the State forestry services, and the chief of the Division of Forest Products, Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization. The first task which the Council undertook was an urgent examination of Australia’s present and future requirements and the potential for meeting these requirements from our own resources. As a result of this examination the Council reached the view that although the long term forecast was for a substantial deficiency in timber and other forest products this could be made good economically from timber produced in Australia. To meet the deficiency the Council estimated that Australia would require a softwood resource of about three million acres of plantations by the year 2000. It was estimated that such a resource together with improved production from the native forests would be likely to make Australia reasonably self sufficient as to total requirements for wood for the Australian population expected at that time.\n\nConsequently, the first recommendation of the Forestry Council was that the rate of establishment of softwood plantations should be stepped up from the present 40,000 acres per annum to 75.001) acres per annum for the next 35 years. The Council estimated that if this rate of planting were achieved the lag in production would be substantially overcome by the turn of the century. This is not to mean that we will no longer have to import. It is very difficult to estimate so far ahead. There are so many factors which can influence consumption and production. There will be deficiencies in particular types of timber and we will always need to import special purpose timbers which cannot be grown in Australia. However, with a softwood resource of three million acres of plantation, production would more nearly balance consumption and we would not face an import bill nearly as large as $600 million.\n\nIf we are to avoid dependence on substantial imports in the future it will also be necessary to concentrate our attention on increased production of timber and forest products from our native forests. This can be achieved by better management of the natural hardwood resources that we have and this is another avenue to which the Forestry Council has been turning its attention. However, our. most urgent need is to increase substantially our plantings of softwood timbers. There has been spectacular success achieved in Australia with the planting of pine species from overseas. This is particularly so in the case of pinus radiata plantations which have already been established in Australia. Average growth rates several times as great as those obtained in the traditional softwood exporting countries in the northern hemisphere have been achieved. In addition to the large balance of payments savings which would result from an increased planting programme there would also be substantial benefits in the contribution the programme would make to decentralisation. Forestry and forest industries by their very nature attract population to rural areas, and the establishment of new or larger saw mills and processing factories in country areas will provide increased employment opportunities and consequent benefits to business in country towns. Australia is fortunate in having more than sufficient suitable land to carry out the proposed programme. Following its investigations the Forestry Council estimated that an area of more than four million acres could be made available for planting softwoods without encroaching on the better areas of the hardwood forests.\n\nHaving reached a view that a planting programme of 75,000 acres per annum was necessary, the Australian Forestry Council turned its attention to the financing of such a programme. The Council estimated that private forest owners will contribute on the average at least 10,000 acres a year to the programme. This left 65,000 acres a year to be planted by the government forest services. At present the governments are planting at the rate of about 30,000 acres a year so ‘that the programme envisages an increase by them of about 35,000 acres a year or more than doubling their present rate of plantings.\n\nThe State Ministers on the Council indicated that their respective Governments were already allocating a substantial proportion of State funds to forestry. While supporting the programme as such they pointed out that they would have great difficulty in allocating additional funds to accelerate their planting programme and requested me as Chairman to approach the Commonwealth Government for additional funds for the expanded programme. As I have already announced, the Government has responded most generously to this request by the States. Forestry is a revenue earning activity, and our investigations have revealed that production of softwood in plantations can be a profitable operation in the long term. The emphasis is on the long term, since even with the fast growth rates achieved with pinus radiata in Australia it is 35 years before any substantial income is received and it can be over 40 years before all the trees are finally felled. The Government has consistently taken the view that Commonwealth assistance to revenue earning projects should be in the form of loans. However, in recognition of the long term nature of forestry and the long period between planting and income earning production, the Commonwealth has offered long term loans free of interest’ and repayment of principal in the first ten years.\n\nThe initial programme proposed by the States covers the next five years and it is estimated that the cost of the additional plantings over that five years will be about $20 million. The planting programme, of course, covers 35 years so that towards the end of the five years we need to have another look at the programme and consider the question of further support for future plantings. With the assistance of these loans T would expect the planting rate in the Government owned plantations to accelerate rapidly and we should be approaching the target rate of 65,000 acres of plantings a year by the end of the initial five year period. I feel that this is a most important step in the development of Australia’s natural resources. Many of us will probably not be here to see the effects of the plantings, but future generations will, I am sure, look back and thank us for the foresight which led to the acceptance of the Forestry Council programme.\n\nI present the following paper -\n\nSoftwood Planting in Australia - Ministerial Statement, 9th March 1966- and move -\n\nThat the House take note of the paper.\n\nDebate (on motion by Mr. Luchetti) adjourned.\n\npage 68\n\nIMMIGRATION\n\nMinisterial Statement\n\nMr OPPERMAN:\n\nMinister for Immigration · Corio · LP\n\n– by leave - As the Prime Minister (Mr. Harold Holt) has already informed the House, the Government has reviewed the operation of immigration policy affecting non-European people, taking into account the experience and changing circumstances of recent years. I wish to give the House details of the decisions and to discuss their significance. When in 1956 the Government reviewed the policy, which had been followed since Federation, of not admitting persons of non-European origin for permanent residence, it introduced several significant reforms. Those people already settled here became eligible to be naturalised; the admission for permanent residence of immediate relatives of Australian citizens was authorised; and it was made possible for highly qualified people to come here for indefinite stay, though under temporary permits. Then in 1957 it was decided that non-Europeans who had been admitted on temporary permits could be naturalised after 15 years’ stay. In 1964, the rules governing the entry of persons of mixed descent were eased.\n\nThe Government has now decided upon two further measures which the House will recognise as important but as not departing from the fundamental principles of our immigration policy. First, it has been decided that non-European people who are already here under temporary permits but are likely to be here indefinitely, should not have to wait 15 years before applying for resident status and for Australian citizenship, but should be able to apply after five years’ residence, so ending a situation often criticised for its effect on individuals and families. This does not of course mean that everyone admitted to Australia for limited temporary residence is entitled to stay here indefinitely. Every country makes separate provision for temporary entry as distinct from the entry of settlers. For example, I must emphasise it would be quite wrong and most unfair to the development of countries whence they came to offer to the 12,000 Asian students in Australia the right to settle here after five years’ study. The objective of admitting these young people, to use educational facilities which are both expensive to the Australian Government and in great demand, is to help the students’ homelands by increasing their numbers of qualified people.\n\nThe Government’s decision, therefore, does not relate to people expected to leave Australia after limited temporary residence but does apply to those who have been here for long periods or who are likely to be allowed to stay indefinitely. The two main examples of people affected by the elimination of the fifteen-year rule are the highly qualified Asians admitted in recent years for “ indefinite stay “ but on temporary entry permits; and Chinese admitted before 1956 who, if they left Australia, could go back only to Communist China. By a decision of the Government in 1956, they were allowed to stay on but, lacking the status of settlers and citizens, have been unable to bring their wives and children here. I am very glad to say that one important benefit of the Government’s decision to abolish the so-called fifteenyear rule will be to enable many families who have been separated for some years to be reunited much sooner than would have been possible under the previous rule.\n\nThe second decision is that applications for entry by well qualified people wishing to settle in Australia will be considered on the basis of their suitability as settlers, their ability to integrate readily, and their possession of qualifications which are in fact positively useful to Australia. They will be able after five years’ stay on temporary permits to apply for resident status and citizenship. They will be able to bring their immediate families with them on first arrival.\n\nNo annual quota is contemplated. The number of people entering - though limited relative to our total population - will be somewhat greater than previously, but will be controlled by the careful assessment of the individual’s qualifications, and the basic aim of preserving a homogeneous population will be maintained. The changes are of course not intended to meet general labour shortages or to permit the large scale admission of workers from Asia; but the widening of eligibility will help to fill some of Australia’s special needs.\n\nExamples of those who, under the new decision, will be admitted in numbers greater than previously are persons with specialised technical skills for appointments for which local residents are not available; persons of high attainment in the arts and sciences, or of prominent achievement in other ways; persons nominated by responsible authorities or institutions for specific important professional appointments, which otherwise would remain unfilled; executives, technicians, and other specialists who have spent substantial periods in Australia - for example, with the branches here of large Asian companies - and who have qualifications or experience in positive demand here; businessmen who in their own countries have been engaged in substantial international trading and would be able to carry on such trade from Australia; persons who have been of particular and lasting help to Australia’s interest abroad in trade, or in other ways; and persons who by former residence in Australia or by association with us have demonstrated an interest in or identification with Australia that should make their future residence here feasible.\n\nApplications by such persons and others in comparable circumstances will be eligible for consideration on an individual basis. Those admitted will be able to apply for resident status and citizenship after five years’ stay. Where the Governments of other countries may be concerned over loss of qualified people, there will be appropriate consultation, as Australia must not contradict the aims of the Colombo Plan and other efforts to help such countries’ development. With the same objective, the programme of allowing young people to come from other countries as students will continue. Greater effort is to be made to ensure that courses undertaken will be of recognised value to the students’ homelands when they return there. In view of the need to ensure most effective use of scarce places at our universities and other institutions, the intending student’s ability to undertake his course successfully will be examined carefully at time of application for entry, and his progress will be assessed annually.\n\nHonorable members on both sides of the House have frequently and generously stressed that humanity and discretion have marked the handling of individual cases in the immigration field generally. This, I can assure the House, will be continued, always with Australia’s interests in view, always in the hope of showing sympathy and consideration to men and women in difficulty, and always avoiding unnecessary disclosure of private confidences or misfortunes. Representations from any responsible source will be carefully considered.\n\nEvery country has not only a right to its own immigration policy but a heavy duty and a vital responsibility to administer it in the interests of its own people. Our neighbours and friends all have immigration policies that are based on their own interests and are intended to benefit their own people and future. All include elements of control of entry and residence, some with strict numerical and national limitations. No government is to be reproached for aspects of its immigration system developed for its needs and derived from its social history, political traditions and constitutional arrangements. No responsible government condones illegality or deceit, which are poor gateways indeed for the entry of new settlers.\n\nOur programmes and policies have likewise emerged from our history, our respect for law and order and our response to our special needs. Our primary aim in immigration is a generally integrated and predominantly homogeneous population. A positive element in the latest changes is that which will admit selected non-Europeans capable of becoming Australians and joining in our national development. Both the policy and the rules and procedures by which it is effected cannot remain static and must be constantly reviewed. Though redefined from time to time, they must be administered in accordance with the law, on principals decided by the Government, with justice to individuals and for the future welfare of the Australian people as a whole. These will continue to be the main elements in Australia’s immigration policy.\n\nI present the following paper -\n\nImmigration Policy affecting Non-Europeans - Ministerial Statement, 9th March 1966 - and move -\n\nThat the House take note of the paper.\n\nDebate (on motion by Mr. Daly) adjourned.\n\npage 70\n\nLABORATORIES FOR COMMONWEALTH SCIENTIFIC AND INDUSTRIAL RESEARCH ORGANISATION, INDOOROOPILLY, QUEENSLAND\n\nReference to Public Works Committee\n\nMr FREETH:\n\nMinister for Shipping and Transport · Forrest · LP\n\n– I move -\n\nThat, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1913-1965, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for investigation and report: - Proposed new laboratories for the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation at Indooroopilly, Queensland.\n\nThe proposal involves the provision of accommodation, facilities and services required for research and routine examinations in the fields of animal health and entomology. It is proposed to erect two separate three storey laboratory wings connected by covered ways to a central two storey administrative block to serve both laboratories.\n\nThe buildings will be in reinforced concrete and load bearing brick construction with appropriate finishes and associated engineering services. The estimated cost is Si, 150,000. 1 table the plan of the proposed works.\n\nQuestion resolved in the affirmative.\n\npage 70\n\nAUSTRALIAN COASTAL SHIPPING COMMISSION BILL 1966\n\nBill presented by Mr. Freeth, and read a first time.\n\nSecond Reading\n\nMr FREETH:\n\nMinister for Shipping and Transport · Forrest · LP\n\n– 1 move - That the Bill be now read a second time.\n\nThe purpose of this Bill is to amend the Australian Coastal Shipping Commission Act 1956-64 in order to meet the needs of the Commission for greater borrowing powers and to give it greater flexibility within its capital structure.\n\nThe Commission is faced with substantial capital expenditure over the next few years for the construction of new vessels which it has on order or intends to build and for the erection pf associated shore facilities. The Commission now has on order one 47,500 dead weight tons bulk carrier which is expected to be commissioned within the next few months and it is committed to the construction of a second 47,500 dead weight tons bulk carrier. It has ordered two roll-on roll-off cargo vessels for the MelbourneBrisbane and the Melbourne-Brisbane-North Queensland trades and has announced it has under consideration a proposal to construct a second Bass Strait passenger vessel. There is also a requirement for a new specialised vessel for the Darwin trade.\n\nFor some time the Commission has been concerned that it is disadvantageously placed in tendering for long term contracts, particularly for the carriage of bulk cargoes because of the restrictions the existing Act places on its capital structure. Other Australian shipowners can, through the availability of long term finance at reasonable rates of interest, set up a relationship of ordinary share capital to loan borrowings which permits them to achieve a higher earning rate on capital from a lower freight rate than would be the case if their capital were wholly in the form of share or equity capital.\n\nUnder the Act as it now stands the Commission has no such freedom. Its capital is determined by section 28 of the Australian Coastal Shipping Commission Act. Its borrowing powers derive from section 30 of the Act under which the Commission may, with the approval of the Treasurer, borrow such amounts as the Minister certifies are necessary for meeting its obligations or discharging its functions. The Commission’s borrowing powers are limited to $10 million - £5 million - under sub-section 6 of section 30, and moneys borrowed by the Commission do not form part of its capital.\n\nThe accepted commercial practice in these matters is to achieve an appropriate balance between equity capital, overdraft and some form of loan finance. The Commission is required to pay a reasonable return on its capital and is expected to play a competitive role in its operations. In these circumstances it should have the same freedom to vary the ratio between loan borrowings and equity capital as its competitors, and the purpose of this Bill is to place it in this position.\n\nWhilst the Commission now has access to basically the same methods of financing as are available to private shipowners, its borrowing powers are limited and, if it is to carry through its proposed capital works programme, it must have access to additional funds. This is necessary, particularly if the Commission is to maintain a competitive position in relation to private shipowners, including overseas interests which may wish to enter into Australian coastal trading.\n\nThe proposed deletion of sub-section 6 of section 30 will remove altogether the provision that amounts borrowed by the Commission and not repaid shall not at any time exceed $10 million. It will give the Commission greater borrowing powers and the required flexibility in its capital structure. The approval of the Minister and the Treasurer will still be necessary before any borrowings are made and this will provide a means of limiting or controlling the borrowings of the Commisison in the light of its approved requirements for ships and terminal facilities if this proves to be necessary. The House will appreciate, of course, that Parliament still exercises control over the funds available to the Commission through the normal budgetary processes, and through the fact that, by law, the Commission presents accounts and a report to Parliament annually.\n\nThe opportunity has also been taken to make provision for the conversion of references to money in the Act to decimal currency. The proposed amendments will result in the more efficient operation of the Commission and I commend them to honorable members.\n\nDebate (on motion by Mr. Crean) adjourned.\n\npage 71\n\nAUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY REPRESENTATION BILL 1966\n\nBill - by leave - presented by Mr. Anthony, and read a first time.\n\nSecond Reading\n\nMr ANTHONY:\n\nMinister for the Interior · Richmond · CP\n\n– I move -\n\nThat the Bill be now read a second time.\n\nThe purpose of this Bill is to provide that as from the date of Che first sitting of the next Parliament the member representing the Australian Capital Territory in the House of Representatives shall have the same voting rights as other members of this House. It will be recalled that the Australian Capital Territory has been represented in the House of Representatives since the beginning of the Nineteenth Parliament although, as members are well aware, the voting powers of the member for the Australian Capital Territory have been strictly limited. Broadly speaking, he is entitled to vote only on a proposed law which relates solely to the Territory, on a motion for the disallowance of an ordinance of the Territory, on an amendment to such a motion, on a motion for the disallowance of a regulation under an ordinance or on a motion for the disallowance of a modification or variation of the plan of layout of the city of Canberra. Over the yearsthere have been many requests that the member for the Australian Capital Territory be given full voting rights, but the Government has held firmly to the principle that this could be considered only when the enrolment for the Territory approached the average enrolment of the electoral divisions.\n\nWhen the first member was elected to represent the Australian Capital Territory, the number of electors for the Territory was approximately 11,800 and most people would agree that there could be no justification for the granting of full voting rights to the member until the number of electors for the Territory approximated the average enrolment for the States. Although that stage has not yet been reached, the number of electors enrolled for the Australian Capital Territory was 43,401 at the end of January last. At that time, the average enrolment for the electoral divisions, excluding the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory, was 49,236. It is expected that the Australian Capital Territory enrolment will reach 47,000 by the end of this year. The population of the Australian Capital Territory at 30th June last was 88,571 and will be approximately 100,000 by 31st December next. In the normal course, several months will elapse before the next House of Representatives election but the Government believes that this legislation should be put on the statute book without delay so that the people of the Australian Capital Territory, being aware of the Government’s intentions, will appreciate fully the important responsibility vested in them in choosing their future parliamentary representative.\n\nI know that there are many members in Parliament who feci that if the member for the Australian Capital Territory is given full voting rights, then a similar right should be given to the member for the Northern Territory. However. I would again emphasise that we are only giving this voting right to the member for the Australian Capital Territory because it conforms with the principle that we have always adopted. That is that the right should be given only when the enrolment for a territory approaches the electoral quota. The population of the Northern Territory as at 30th June 1965 was 34,803 plus about 20,000 Aborigines, while the number of electors enrolled for the Territory was 17,565 as at the end of January this year. I should, however, like to inform the House that it is the intention of the Government to re-examine the question of the voting rights of the member for the Northern Territory when the size of the Parliament has been determined after the proposed referendum has been held to break the nexus between the House of Representatives and the Senate. This referendum is intended early in the life of the next Parliament. I feel that the Bill will receive the ready support of all parties and I commend it to honorable members.\n\nDebate (on motion by Mr. J. R. Fraser) adjourned.\n\npage 72\n\nLOAN (AIRLINES EQUIPMENT) BILL 1966\n\nSecond Reading\n\nDebate resumed from 8th March (vide page 38), on motion by Mr. McMahon -\n\nThat the Bill be now read a second time.\n\nMr CREAN:\n\nMelbourne Ports\n\n.- On behalf of the Opposition I move -\n\nThat all words after “That” be omitted with a view to inserting the following words in place thereof^ “ this House, whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, is of opinion that the financing of the purchase of aircraft by the Australian National Airlines Commission and Qantas Empire Airways Limited should be met from revenue and not from a loan raised overseas.”\n\nIt will be remembered that on two fairly recent occasions we considered somewhat similar measures to this. One was introduced by the former Treasurer (Mr. Harold Holt) on 18th March 1964 and the other measure was introduced on 9th November 1964. Each of them enabled borrowing overseas on behalf of Qantas Empire Airways Limited. In those two instances we moved an amendment in similar terms to the one that is now before the House. We did so because we regarded the sums as relatively so trivial that it was virtually bad book-keeping and bad economics that when we had money in our reserves we should resort to borrowing and to placing ourselves under fairly restrictive conditions with overseas banking concerns.\n\nHonorable members will find the names of the concerns involved in this particular instance contained in the schedule to the Bill. They are the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company of New York, the Chase Manhattan Bank, the Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company, the Chemical Bank New York Trust Company, the Irving Trust Company, the United California Bank, the Northern Trust Company, the Bank of America National Trust and Savings Association and the Continental Illinois National Bank and Trust Company of Chicago. All of these concerns are to take a part of the loan that this Bill contemplates. The sum could be as high as SUS54 million - something under $A50 million.\n\nThe terms under which this loan is to be borrowed provide for payment at an interest rate in excess of 5 per cent. In fact, the Treasurer (Mr. McMahon) has indicated that the average interest cost over the full period of the borrowing is slightly less than 5i per cent. That means that with a period of repayment of seven or eight years probably nearly one-half as much again will have to be paid to extinguish the loan. In other words, a sum of from $25 million to $30 million will have to be paid by way of interest as well as the principal sum of $US54 million.\n\nQuite an interesting document entitled “ Supplement to the Treasury Information Bulletin “ was issued by the Commonwealth Treasury during the recess. It dealt with the Australian balance of payments. It indicated that Australia’s holdings of gold and foreign exchange at 31st December 1965 were $ A 1,278 million and that in addition Australia had what are known as second line reserves which aggregated S589 million. The relevant reference appears at page 43 of the document. At 30th June 1961 Australia’s gold and foreign exchange holdings had totalled $1,102 million and potential drawing rights on the International Monetary Fund amounted to $266 million. Thus first line and second line reserves taken together totalled SI. 368 million. By 30th June 1964 the first line reserves had risen to $1,708 million, second line r"
