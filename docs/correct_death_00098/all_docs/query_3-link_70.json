        "text": "Robert Menzies was famously a supporter of the Carlton Blues, but it turns out his real colours were Red & White. These have been the colours of clan Menzies since 300BC, with the family tracing its roots all the way back to the second son of King Fergus, the legendary first ruler of the Scots. Our Book of the Week documents the family history over the centuries, & reveals that Australia's Sir Robert Menzies is just the latest of many important figures to bear that name. https://zurl.co/PYrL\n\nIs migration a one-way street, or does its cultural impact flow in both directions? On Afternoon Light #155 Georgina Downer speaks with Professor Denis Byrne to discuss the China-Australia migration corridor. A phenomenon which saw Australian money, ideas, objects and people shape areas of the Chinese mainland from the 1840s onwards. https://zurl.co/Nvra\n\nDo independent schools save the government money? This is the point that 6 Goulburn area Catholic schools tried to prove On This Day in 1962, when they went on 'strike' and told their pupils to enroll in the public system. The incident would help prompt Menzies's landmark decision to introduce State Aid - though it was not a sudden change of heart, as Menzies had announced his support for the idea as early as 1943. For him, it was about principles more than savings, as independent schools embodied the liberal ideal of choice & diversity in education, as opposed to state-based homogenisation. https://zurl.co/N3hi\n\nAre we doomed to be consumed by technology? Published 100 years ago, Narcissus argues that humanity's obsession with fashion trends has replaced organic evolution - with the logical consequence being that we will become possessed, first by changing our bodies via plastic surgery, and then by replacing them altogether with machines. A curious history of clothes that descends into a warning about a dystopian future, it is one of the stranger volumes in the Menzies Collection, and speaks to a young Menzies's eclectic interests. https://zurl.co/vUgV\n\nWhen did the concept of ‚Äòpeacekeeping‚Äô emerge? And have its successes outweighed some glaring failures? On Afternoon Light #154 Georgina Downer speaks with Dr Peter Londey to discuss 77 years of Australian peacekeeping efforts. Never envisaged in the UN charter, the episode reveals how Australia has been at the forefront of how the practice first began and has continued to evolve. https://zurl.co/Dzoq"
