        "text": "Sir Robert Gordon Menzies, KT, AK, CH, QC, FAA, FRS (20 December 1894 – 15 May 1978) was a politician in the Commonwealth of Australia who was the 12th and longest-serving prime minister of Australia, holding office for over 29 years from 1932 to 1961. He played a central role during and following the Australian Civil War, helping rebuild the Commonwealth, defining its policies and its broad outreach. Menzies studied law at the University of Melbourne and became one of Melbourne's leading lawyers. After joining the United Australia Party, he was a member of the Victorian Legislative Assembly from 1929-1932, and then transferred to Federal Parliament, subsequently becoming Attorney-General of Australia and Minister for Industry in the government of Joseph Lyons. In the opening months of the Bad Years, Menzies orchestrated a spill against Lyons, becoming the nations 12th Prime Minister.\n\nAs an avid Anti-Socialist, Menzies would lead the Commonwealth through the Civil War, and would be instrumental in negotiating the Treaty of Singapore. Following the war, Menzies would move to Perth and continue on as Prime Minister. Menzies won nine consecutive elections during his term, eventually retiring as prime minister in January 1961. Despite his pre-war failures, his government is remembered for its development of the Commonwealth capital city of Perth, its expanded post-war immigration scheme, emphasis on higher education, and national security policies, which saw the Commonwealth become the Imperial protector of several British colonies in the Pacific, and contribute troops to the Korean War, the Malayan Emergency, the Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation, and the Vietnam War.\n\nSee Also[]"
