        "text": "Sir Robert Menzies (born Dec. 20, 1894, Jeparit, Victoria, Austl.—died May 15, 1978, Melbourne) was a statesman who, as prime minister of Australia (1939–41, 1949–66), strengthened military ties with the United States and fostered industrial growth and immigration from Europe.\n\nMenzies gave up a highly successful law practice in Victoria to serve in the state legislature (1929–34). He entered the federal Parliament in 1934, serving as attorney general (1934–39) under Joseph Lyons; and in 1939, as leader of the United Australia Party, he became prime minister. Pressure from various quarters forced his resignation in 1941, after he had initiated Australia’s mobilization for World War II. Organizing the Liberal Party in 1944, he regained control of the government in 1949, campaigning in opposition to the Socialist policies of the Labor Party.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nAustralian Government and Political System"
