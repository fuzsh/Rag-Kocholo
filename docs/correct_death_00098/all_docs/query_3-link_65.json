        "text": "A trip down to see Mum at short notice with Bev provided a chance to get to a relatively close cemetery in Bristol. As it appears to be my unique want, I of course marhed around about 30 graves before finding Normans. For anyone elses reference – in through the main entrance and about 30 meters right.\n\nNorman Gale, who rests now in Canford Cemetery, Bristol is the last member of military personnel to be recorded on the blog, who were killed on the night of the 8th of September when Stirling Mk.III BK809 JN-T, piloted by Ian Menzies crashed on take-off into houses on the edge of Mepal airfield.\n\nNorman and his crew arrived at Mepal on the 28th of August 1943, from 1657 H.C.U. Ian undertook, as was obligatory at that times it seems, 2 ‘2nd Dickie Ops’ prior to the crew becoming fully Operational on the 2nd of September.\n\n27/08/1943 – Attack Against Targets at Nuremburg\n\nNineteen aircraft were detailed to attack the above targets with incendiary bombs of 30lbs. and 4lbs. One aircraft failed to return, but the remainder successfully dropped their bombs in the target area. Good concentrated fires and heavy explosions were seen. A moderate barrage consisting of light and heavy A.A. fire co-operating with searchlights were encountered, and two aircraft received slight damage. Some enemy aircraft were seen, one short combat took place, but no damage was sustained by our aircraft. The weather was cloudy on the outward journey but clear over the target and visibility was good. Navigation was very good. The missing aircraft was Stirling Mk.III EE955 captained by F/Sgt. Higham.\n\nStirling Mk.III EH936 JN-W\n\nP/O Hilton Clifford Williams, RNZAF NZ416219 – Pilot.\n\nP/O Ian Robert Menzies, RNZAF NZ415002 – 2nd Pilot.\n\nF/S Trevor Gordon Dill, RNZAF NZ42292 – Navigator.\n\nF/S Adrian Leslie Bernard Carson, RNZAF NZ411347 – Air Bomber.\n\nSgt.

All aircraft with the exception of one which failed to return, successfully dropped their bombs in the target area. Very large fires which were well concentrated and spreading, were seen. All crews were of the opinion that this was a good attack. Moderate heavy A.A. fire and a few searchlights were encountered, which were ineffective. A great number of enemy aircraft were seen and some short combats took place. The aircraft captained by F/Sgt. Batger, H. sighted an enemy aircraft 600 yards away, ahead and the front gunner fired a long and short burst, the enemy aircraft then disappeared and was claimed as possibly destroyed. . The aircraft captained by F/S McGregor,K. sighted an Me110 astern, the rear gunner fired a long burst. The enemy aircraft replied and dived away with smoke pouring from its engines. It is claimed as a possible destroyed. There was 8/10ths cloud at the target approaches although it was clear in the target area. Navigation was very good. The missing aircraft was Stirling MK.III EH938 captained by Sgt. Parkin, T.\n\nStirling Mk.III BF434 AA-X\n\nP/O Arthur William Burley, RAFVR 1315375/ 147201 – Pilot.\n\nP/O Ian Robert Menzies, RNZAF NZ415002 – 2nd Pilot.\n\nF/S Reginald Hill, RNZAF NZ413216 – Navigator.\n\nF/S Ewen McGregor Elmslie, RNZAF NZ417200 – Air Bomber.\n\nSgt.

The remainder however, successfully dropped their mines in the allotted area, although the parachutes were not seen to open owing to 4/10th cloud. No A.A. fire or searchlights were encountered. One unidentified aircraft was seen and a short combat took place, but no damage was sustained to our aircraft. The weather was good on the outward route, but fog and patchy cloud was prevalent in the mining area. Navigation was very good.\n\nStirling Mk.III EE958 AA-V\n\nF/O Ian Robert Menzies, RNZAF NZ415002 – Pilot.\n\nP/O Derek Albert Arthur Cordery, RAFVR 136360 – Navigator.\n\nP/O Norman Hathway Gale, RAFVR 849986/ 151013 – Air Bomber.\n\nSgt.

They all successfully dropped their mines in the allotted area, and some of the parachutes were seen to open. A few searchlights and A.A. guns were encountered, but were ineffective. One enemy aircraft was seen but no combat took place. There was a clear sky in the mining area and visibility was good.

One aircraft had trouble shortly after take-off and was forced to jettison its bombs four miles north of CAMBRIDGE. The attack was well concentrated and large fires together with heavy explosions were seen. Moderate heavy A.A. fire co-operating with searchlights were encountered, which were ineffective. One aircraft on the return journey when near the FRENCH Coast was hit by A.A. fire. It received considerable damage and two of its engines were made unserviceable. The ENGLISH Coast was reached however, it belly-landed at Hunsden. Many fighters were seen and some combats took, place. The aircraft captained by F/Sgt. H.BATGER sighted an enemy aircraft on the port quarter which opened fire on them and our aircraft corkscrewed. The Mid-upper and Rear Gunner then opened fire and the enemy aircraft was seen to dive to the ground in flames. It was claimed as destroyed. Our aircraft received considerable damage and the Flight Engineer Sgt. R. DALKINS was seriously wounded. The aircraft captained by F/Sgt. R. WHITMORE sighted an enemy aircraft 100yds. astern, the Mid-upper and Rear Gunners opened fire, the enemy aircraft was seen to turn over and spin into the ground afire. It was claimed as destroyed. This was flowed by another enemy aircraft approaching from starboard to port astern, the Mid-upper and Rear Gunners again fired and the enemy aircraft broke away. One minute later an unidentified aircraft was seen firing at a Lancaster aircraft, which was afire. F/Sgt. WHITMORE’s Mid-Upper and Rear Gunners opened fire on the enemy aircraft, which disappeared. The Lancaster was then seen to break up. Some cloud was encountered on the way to the target, but there was a clear sky and visibility was good in the target area. Navigation was very good. One aircraft failed to return, it was captained by F/Sgt. WILKINSON, E.S.\n\nStirling Mk.III BK777 AA-U\n\nF/O Ian Robert Menzies, RNZAF NZ415002 – Pilot.\n\nP/O Derek Albert Arthur Cordery, RAFVR 136360 – Navigator.\n\nP/O Norman Hathway Gale, RAFVR 849986/ 151013 – Air Bomber.\n\nSgt.

The carried their maximum bomb load in bombs of 1,000lb., and 500lb.. One aircraft crashed whilst taking off and two returned early. The remainder successfully dropped their bombs in the target area. Not many fires were seen but numerous huge explosions were observed. Some heavy and light predicted A.A.Fire and a few searchlights were encountered but caused no trouble. A few enemy aircraft were seen, but no combats took place. The weather was good and visibility was clear except for slight ground haze. Navigation was excellent.\n\nThe aircraft that crashed during take-off was captained by F/O. I.R.MENZIES. Whilst taking off it swung off the runway and crashed into two houses on the far side adjoining the perimeter track. It caught fire almost simultaneously, and in the fire, various bombs exploded, causing the aircraft to be a total wreck. Three members of the crew, a W.A.A.F. Officer of R.A.F. Station MEPAL and an aircrew Sergeant, and 2 civilians were killed and other civilians were injured. The W.A.A.F. Officer and the aircrew sergeant lost their lives whilst trying to render assistance.\n\nStirling Mk.III BK809 JN-T\n\nF/O. Ian Robert Menzies RNZAF NZ415002. Pilot.

Navigator (Whitehead crew)\n\nF/Sgt Dobson was killed by exploding bombs as he went to the assistance of the aircrew crew and the occupants of the houses. Buried Cambridge City Cemetery, England.\n\nMention in Despatches (14 Jan 1944):\n\n“For bravery in action and meritorious fulfilment of duty”.\n\nSection Officer Joan Majorie Easton WAAF/RAF 2986.\n\nS/O Easton was killed when the bomb load exploded as she went to the assistance of the aircraft crew and the occupants of the houses. Buried Greenwich (Charlton and Kidbrook) Cemetery. London, England.\n\nAdditionally, another member of the Squadron came to the aid of the crash victims. Unlike Peter and Joan, Terence survived the incident and was awarded the British Empire Medal for his bravery that night.\n\nCpl Terence Henry King BEM RAF 610334. ELECT 1, Electrical Sect. Citation BEM (24 Dec 1943) “In September 1943, an aircraft which was taking off with a load of bombs crashed into two houses on the edge of an airfield and burst into flames. Corporal King hurried to the scene and, although fully aware that high explosive bombs were likely to explode at any moment, he went to the cottages a few yards from the burning aircraft to warn the occupants of their imminent danger and render assistance. An injured man was found and while Corporal King, with the help of a civilian, was taking him to safety a bomb exploded. The bravery shown by Corporal King was instrumental in saving a life and many more lives might have been lost had it not been for his prompt action in helping to warn occupants of the nearby houses. “\n\nThe crash of BK809 JN-T, 8th September 1943 – the aftermath can be read here.\n\nGreenwich Cemetery (Charlton and Kidbrook), London – S/O Joan Marjorie Easton WAAF can be read here.\n\nCambridge City Cemetery – Aircrew headstones recorded can be read here.\n\nBuxton Cemetery part 2 – Albert Leslie Mellor, killed 8th September 1943 can be read here.\n\nMany thanks to Peter for passing on via Dave, these news clippings of the time that report the events and aftermath of the take off crash of BK809 JN-T on the evening of the 8th September 1943.\n\nDave’s email regarding these news clippings also tells us a little bit about Peter and his recollections of the Squadron’s time at Mepal.\n\n“Peter lived at the top of the road when the crash happened and has fascinating memories of that time. He tells me that most of the houses in the road had all their windows blown out and some were damaged by shrapnel. In daylight nothing remained of the two houses except an enormous crater where they once stood. As a boy he called those dispersals his own and when nobody was about he regularly went through the fence to check for treasures left by the airmen during the day, broken perspex, .303 rounds and cases, etc. It would have been always the same aircraft parked there and he remembers AA-A in particular.\n\nThe villagers often listened in to the Tower radio and would count the aircraft out on a raid and check them back in again afterwards. He particularly remembers an intruder coming in with the bomber stream undetected until it opened fire! The radio English was forgotten he says and the language was BLUE!”\n\nThis story has been presented and added to a number of times on the blog and it has always been a source of personal frustration that the (Squadron) records I have, whilst providing details of the Squadron personnel who were killed in the crash and subsequent explosion, only refers to the deaths of the occupants of the houses as ‘civilians’\n\nPerhaps ‘pleased’ is not the right word, but now at least we can know the names of the non Squadron victims of this terrible accident. John Randall, who lived in one of the houses that was destroyed in the explosion after the crash and Edward Kirby, a member of the National Fire Service (N.F.S).\n\nThe newspaper clippings provide a remarkable commentary on the events of the night and are good enough quality to be able to read quite easily, so rather than unnecessarily transcribe it, or extracts of it, please take the time to read what follows.\n\nAlso in Dave’s email, he remarked that Peter had tried, unsuccessfully, to have a memorial for the civilians that died that night placed in the local Church. Dave wondered out loud – and I tend to agree with him – what the chances are and what would have to be done to get a memorial to all those that perished that night erected near the crash site of BK809 JN-T.\n\nIf anybody has any thoughts on this last idea – please get in contact with me.\n\nAs I said at the top of this post, this story has been discussed a few time already on the blog – if it interests you and you haven’t seen the previous related posts, here are some that you hopefully, will find of interest.\n\nTo read about the events of that night in September 1943, click here.\n\nTo see the gravestones of F/O. Ian Robert Menzies (RNZAF NZ415002), Pilot of ND809 and F/S Peter Gerald Dobson MiD (RNZAF NZ439022), a member of 75(NZ) Squadron RAF, who went to offer assistance after the crash, click here.\n\nTo view the gravestone of Sgt. Albert Leslie Mellor RAFVR 943914, Flight Engineer with Ian Menzies crew that night, click here.\n\nTo view the gravestone of Section Officer Joan Marjorie Easton (WAAF), who was also killed that night while attempting to help the survivors of the crash click here.\n\nA really big thank you to Adrian for taking the time to visit Cambridge City Cemetery to photograph the graves of the 75(NZ) Squadron aircrew who rest there. The 15 airmen that are buried in Cambridge Cemetery are from 8 crews, and were lost during operational and training flights and in one case owing to an extreme act of bravery.\n\nI have decided to group the stones and present the airmen relative to the crews they flew in and the fates that befell them. The are listed in chronological order.\n\nSgt Raymond Herbert John Broady (RNZAF NZ39691) was piloting a Stirling bomber on a night flight, on the 28th of November 1942, whilst based at RAF Oakington, where ‘A’ Flight were converting from Wellingtons to Stirlings. Whilst attempting to avoid a head on collision with another Stirling (not a 75(NZ) a/c), his aircraft stalled which resulted in it crashing near Trinity Hall Farm, Oakington. All crew were killed or fatally injured, including a Sgt. Stanley Lawrence Drayton, who it is believed was based on the crew at Oakington.\n\nInitially, Sgt. Robert James McWilliam (RCAF 93977) caused me some confusion – there being little sensible information in the Nominal Roll relating to him – only listing Kenneth Blincoe as his Pilot. The events of the training crash have been pondered over in the blog previously and the scant information regarding the crew on that night was based on hypothesis, based on the last recorded Op the crew flew. It strikes me now that the reason that 2 of these airmen were not killed in the crash is that they had actually left the Squadron – hence perhaps the presence of Robert McWilliam as the crews new Wireless Operator – also, though it seems obvious now – this is why I could find no other report of a crash on the 28th of November…\n\nSgt Alexander McIssac (RNZAF NZ412891), Rear Gunner, rests in Chevington Cemetery, Northumberland, England, as does the Air Bomber of the crew, Sgt. George Trueman Jobson (RAFVR 1287935). Rear Gunner Sgt Charles Thomas Rogers (RAFVR 1170921) is buried at Crowle (St. John the Baptist Churchyard) whilst the Flight Engineer of the crew, Sgt Ronald Oswald Dibben (RAFVR 1252627) is buried in Ham (St. Andrew) Churchyard.\n\nSgt. Stanley Lawrence Drayton (RAFVR 1331697), whose identity was the start of the initial research about this incident, rests in Newmarket Cemetery.\n\nMore information about the incident that night and the details of the crew that were lost can be read here.\n\nOn the night of 8th September 1943, whilst accelerating to take off, the Stirling bomber piloted by F/O. Ian Robert Menzies (RNZAF NZ415002) suddenly veered to the right of the runway and crashed firstly through a petrol bowser and then into two houses on the far side adjoining the perimeter track. It caught fire almost simultaneously, and in the fire, various bombs exploded, causing the aircraft to be a total wreck. Three members of the crew, a W.A.A.F. Officer of R.A.F. Station Mepal and an aircrew Sergeant, and 2 civilians were killed and other civilians were injured.\n\nAs well as killing Ian Menzies in the initial crash and explosion, F/O Norman Hathway Gale (RAFVR 849986/151013), the Air Bomber also died and now rests in Bristol (Canford) Cemetery. The Flight Engineer, Sgt Albert Leslie Mellor (RAFVR 943914) succumbed to his injuries and was buried in Buxton Cemetery, Derbyshire.\n\nThe aircrew Sergeant mentioned in this description was F/S Peter Gerald Dobson MiD (RNZAF NZ439022), who was killed by exploding bombs as he went to the assistance of the aircrew crew and the occupants of the houses.\n\nMention in Despatches (14 Jan 1944):\n\n“For bravery in action and meritorious fulfilment of duty”.\n\nSection Officer Joan Majorie Easton (WAAF/RAF 2986) was also killed when, on attempting to aid the rescue of the aircrew and occupants of the houses, the aircraft’s bomb load exploded. Marjorie rests in Greenwich (Charlton and Kidbrook) Cemetery, London.\n\nRead more about the events of that night here.\n\nF/Sgt Walter Hurdle (RNZAF NZ421279), Rear Gunner with Eric Witting’s crew was killed on the 4th of November 1943 during an attack by an enemy aircraft.\n\nThe combat report, as is perhaps inevitable for a ‘report’, is stunningly matter of fact, not only about the attack, but also the death of Sgt. Hurdle.\n\nStirling Mk.III EF163 JN-L was one of 4 aircraft from the Squadron that took off to lay sea mines around the Frisian Islands on the 16th December 1943. The aircraft, Piloted by P/O Colin John Kinross (RNZAF NZ417069) crashed at Bidington Farm, Sutton, Cambridgeshire, in part through bad visibility and also, it is theorised, a hung up mine, that may have effected the aircraft’s centre of gravity. Colin and his Navigator and Air Bomber, F/O Ralph Francis Jenkin (RNZAF NZ416119) and F/S Ronald Harry Emmerson (RAAF AUS.410330) lay in the cemetery.\n\nSgt Raymond Askew (RAFVR 1477972), Flight Engineer rests in Seaton Hirst (St John) Churchyard Ashington, Sgt Willis Arthur Savage (RAF 1503913), the crew’s Wireless Operator lays in Pendelbury (St. John) Churchyard and Sgt. John Albert Warner, Rear Gunner, rests in Bootle Cemetery, Lancashire. The Mid Upper Gunner, Sgt. S. Newman, survived the crash, injured.\n\nF/Lt. Terence Douglas Blewett (RNZAF NZ414376) and crew crashed on their return from an attack on Wanne Eickel on the 17th of January 1945. Lancaster PB761 AA-Y, in serious trouble, crashed into a barn at Wooditton, Suffolk. ‘Tim’ Blewett and the crew’s Air Bomber, F/O John Stanley Wilson (RNZAF NZ426234) were killed instantly on impact. The Navigator, F/S Bryant Thomas Cornell (RAFVR 139828) despite the valiant attempts of the surviving crew, succumbed to his injuries and is buried at Southgate Cemetery, Middlesex, England.\n\nRead more about the crash here.\n\nOn the 26th of February 1945 Lancaster ME450 AA-W crashed on its return from a raid on Dortmund. The aircraft returned with the rest of the Squadron and was seen flying in formation over Mepal, but for some unknown reason crashed soon after, very close to Chatteris gasworks. The crash killed 5 of the 7 crew. The Navigator and Air Bomber,Sgt George William McManus (RAFVR 1806217) and F/S Joseph McKenzie Alfred (RAFVR 1810280), respectively lay in Cambridge Cemetery. The crew’s Pilot, F/O Noel Humphrey Thorpe (RNZAF NZ428168) lays in Ilford (Barkingside) Cemetery, Essex,Sgt Frederick Henry Saffill (RAFVR 1882066) the Mid Upper Gunner, rests in Maldon Cemetery, Essex and the Flight Engineer, Sgt John Lawrence Duke (RAFVR 2210530), who was only 19 is buried at Stockport Crematorium, having succumbed to his injuries 2 days after the crash.\n\nAll these grave stone photographs and others I have already collected have been added to the respective sections of the alphabetical Roll of Honour.\n\nWhen my thoughts turned to a visit to Buxton cemetery, I obviously performed a search through Kevin King’s fantastic Roll of Honour. Details on the first 2 boys initially made me assume that all those resting in the cemetery were from the crash of Wellington Z1566 in 1942 (see previous post). It took me a minute and further searching to realise that the fifth airman that rests in Buxton was actually from another incident and one that I have already posted about.\n\nWhen I found Albert, away from the main grouping of CWWGC headstones, I was interested to see that a cross and what I took to be a Christmas wreath was laying on his grave. A long shot I thought, but I slid a 75nzsquadron card under the rubber band that held his flowers. Later discussions with Basil, who was born in Buxton, confirmed the fact that the surname Mellor is well known in the area – who knows, there might/ must be a relative still perhaps in the area – maybe I will hear something back……….\n\n75 (NZ) Sqn RAF Operations Record Book (ORB)\n\n8/9/43\n\nOperations.\n\nSeventeen aircraft were detailed to attack the above targets. The carried their maximum bomb load in bombs of 1,000lb., and 500lb.. One aircraft crashed whilst taking off and two returned early. The remainder successfully dropped their bombs in the target area. Not many fires were seen but numerous huge explosions were observed. Some heavy and light predicted A.A.Fire and a few searchlights were encountered but caused no trouble. A few enemy aircraft were seen, but no combats took place. The weather was good and visibility was clear except for slight ground haze. Navigation was excellent.\n\nThe aircraft that crashed during take-off was captained by F/O. I.R.MENZIES. Whilst taking off it swung off the runway and crashed into two houses on the far side adjoining the perimeter track. It caught fire almost simultaneously, and in the fire, various bombs exploded, causing the aircraft to be a total wreck. Three members of the crew, a W.A.A.F. Officer of R.A.F. Station MEPAL and an aircrew Sergeant, and 2 civilians were killed and other civilians were injured. The W.A.A.F. Officer and the aircrew sergeant lost their lives whilst trying to render assistance.\n\nPage 587, 1943. Form 540/ 541 AIR27/ 646 75(NZ) Squadron RAF, Mepal.

Citation BEM (24 Dec 1943) “In September 1943, an aircraft which was taking off with a load of bombs crashed into two houses on the edge of an airfield and burst into flames. Corporal King hurried to the scene and, although fully aware that high explosive bombs were likely to explode at any moment, he went to the cottages a few yards from the burning aircraft to warn the occupants of their imminent danger and render assistance. An injured man was found and while Corporal King, with the help of a civilian, was taking him to safety a bomb exploded. The bravery shown by Corporal King was instrumental in saving a life and many more lives might have been lost had it not been for his prompt action in helping to warn occupants of the nearby houses. “\n\nMany thanks to Dave for supplying an aerial photograph of Mepal airfield as a result of a query on the ‘Ask a ?’ section I set up yesterday.

A Stirling at almost takeoff speed, suffering a collapse, or partial collapse to its starboard undercarriage would probably have been impossible to control – its forward momentum taking it where ever it planned to go, irrespective of any attempts by the Pilot or Flight Engineer to rest control.\n\nI would be fascinated to hear anything else about this event………."
