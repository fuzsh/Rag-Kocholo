        "text": "Albert King (born April 25, 1923, Indianola, Mississippi, U.S.—died December 21, 1992, Memphis, Tennessee) was an American blues musician who created a unique string-bending guitar style that influenced three generations of musicians.\n\nHe was one of 13 children born to an itinerant Mississippi preacher and his wife. When he was eight years old, his widowed mother moved the family to eastern Arkansas, where he worked as a farmhand on a cotton plantation and later as a bulldozer operator. He was left-handed, but he taught himself how to play a right-handed guitar upside down by pulling the strings down."
