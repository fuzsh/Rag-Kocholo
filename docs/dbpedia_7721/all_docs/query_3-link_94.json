        "text": "What better way to celebrate the centenary of Albert King’s birth than with a special edition of his most iconic album? Of his generation of bluesmen, King is probably the one who, with his extrovert personality and Gibson Flying V guitar, seemed most in-step with the rock music of the ‘60s. There’s no greater evidence for that than this album itself; recorded in a series of sessions throughout 1966-7, backed by musicians including Booker T. & the M.G.s and Isaac Hayes, and released by Stax, it’s a funky take on the blues that fit perfectly with the R&B and soul music of the time, and showcased a guitar style that influenced the greatest rock players of the era. While King’s friend Jimmy Reed and blues legend B.B. King, who Albert sometimes erroneously claimed to be related to, had already attained an elder statesman-like stature and Elmore James, who died in ’63 seemed like a figure from musical history, Albert King, playing left-handed upside down on a right-handed guitar, seemed like an entirely contemporary artist.\n\nBorn Under a Bad Sign, recently reissued by Craft Recordings, wasn’t recorded as an album but as a series of five sessions, some featuring Booker T. & the M.G.s as the band and some with the Memphis Horns, but it nonetheless has the coherence that comes from an artist who has honed their craft long before entering the studio. King’s first album – which had similarly been compiled from disparate sessions – had been released five years previously, since when he had recorded a few singles here and there and played the club circuit to death. The result was that his particular delicate-but-forceful playing style and sensitive, soulful vocals had achieved an authority that was only hinted at in 1962’s The Big Blues and perhaps more importantly, the musical setting was every bit as vital and accomplished as King himself.\n\nKicking off with its immediately familiar title track, Born Under a Bad Sign is a smooth and assured record throughout. The track itself features the utterly solid but flexible backing of Booker T., who along with soul legend William Bell, wrote the song especially for King. The slinky bass/guitar riff and disciplined horn arrangement comes straight out of the M.G.s’ soul/R&B milieu, but it fits King’s playing like a glove, and the lyric presented a ‘60s-appropriate, astrological twist on the venerable hard luck blues theme; it just works. King offers a new take on a ‘40s blues standard with “Crosscut Saw,” which is given a light, nimble arrangement that has more soulful horns but leaves ample room for King’s searing guitar.\n\nOften, King’s songs have a beautifully low-key, everyday, modern charm compared with the primal, archaic Robert Johnson-style blues that have been in vogue ever since Johnson’s recordings were rediscovered at the beginning of the ‘60s. “Laundromat Blues” is a classic example that features some of King’s most expressive playing which somehow enhances the song’s beaten, down-to-earth, unglamorous charm. But if hanging round the laundromat hardly seems like typical rock star behaviour, check out the often overlooked “Personal Manager” in which King croons, “I wanna be your personal manager babe…” The blues boom of the late ‘60s may have ignited the careers of behemoths like Cream, Led Zeppelin and even Black Sabbath, but vast as the arenas they played were, they hardly had room for sentiments like “If you sign my contract baby/ You know all of your worries are over for you…” And yet a track like Cream’s “Strange Fruit” is unthinkable without the example of King’s fluid, incisive playing.\n\nBorn Under a Bad Sign is a surprisingly wide-ranging album for one so squarely based in the blues. The mellow flute, restrained horns and hard-hitting drums of “I Almost Lost My Mind” offset the funereal tone of King’s world-weary vocal and give the song an understated funkiness that’s irresistible. A beautifully sultry, late-night version of “The Very Thought of You” is more lounge/swing than blues, but again the performance is so disciplined and King’s vocals and guitar so assured that it doesn’t feel too schmaltzy, even during its spoken passage. “As the Years Go Passing By” has a different, jazzy, Henry Mancini kind of atmosphere with some nice sax and delicate piano complementing King’s searing guitar perfectly. There are of course classic blues tracks too, but they are never desolate or depressing.\n\n“Down Don’t Bother Me” is the closest Albert comes to B.B. King, a rolling, relaxed blues with a swinging horn section as the perfect foil for his expressive solo, while “Oh, Pretty Woman” and “The Hunter” are strident, innuendo-laden tracks in which King adopts the kind of predatory persona more associated with artists like John Lee Hooker. It’s these tracks which sonically set out a blueprint that would be picked up by the British blues boom and bands like Free and Bad Company in the 1970s. The album’s least impressive moment is a still very likable stroll through Leiber and Stoller’s “Kansas City” which is scarcely more rocking than Little Willie Littlefield’s 1953 original, and significantly less so than Little Richard’s by then decade-old version, but it has its own easy charm and a fun quotation from the “Peter Gunn Theme” in the horn part.\n\nAs a singer, Albert King makes for a warm and companionable figure, never haunted or remote, but relatable and consoling. As a guitarist, his tone cuts through the slick, smooth arrangements but never jarringly so. Both very ‘60s and timeless, Born Under a Bad Sign is a beautifully balanced record, the kind of blues album that probably sounded immediately familiar in 1967 and still sounds the same way now, but without ever being dull or run-of-the-mill. Albums are rarely praised for being solid and well-made rather than radical or incendiary, but the blend of professional skill and genuine feeling on Born Under a Bad Sign makes it easy to recommend."
