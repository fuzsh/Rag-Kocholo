        "text": "One of the founding fathers of electric blues and Memphis soul, Albert King had an unmatched sound and character and would go on to influence such giants as Otis Rush, Eric Clapton, Mike Bloomfield, Jimi Hendrix and many more.\n\nKnown to most as one of the “three kings” (four if you count Earl King), Albert bought his first guitar for $1.25 after listening to T-Bone Walker and began playing with a small group called The Groove Boys in the late 40s. By the 50s he started recording his first singles in Chicago and would later release his debut album via the King label (his only record on the label before moving to Stax) titled The Big Blues.\n\nThe Big Blues included sides taped as far back as 1959 with minor label Bobbin Records and is presented here as a reissue under the name Travelin’ To California, presumably because it features four bonus tracks (I’ll Do Anything You Say, Got To Be Some Changes Made, The Time Has Come and Blues At Sunrise) originating from the same 1962 sessions.\n\nIt’s always refreshing to find this music available on LP, allowing as it does a new audience to experience a guitarist who helped pave the way for Stevie Ray Vaughan and other major players."
