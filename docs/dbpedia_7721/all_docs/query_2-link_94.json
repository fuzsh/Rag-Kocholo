        "text": "As I said last time, I only had a handful of Albert King songs until pretty recently. I picked this one up on my first trip to Siren Records back in February 2020, just before the world went insane. They had some formidable blues records and I should have bought them all. I would have, had I known how long it would be before I’d get back there.\n\nThis was there, at a ridiculously low price, and despite how very ’70s it looked, or maybe because of it. It turns out there was a reason for that – this cover is by design legend Milton Glaser, who apparently did hundreds of album covers. $3.99 for this gem! I didn’t complain, even though I also have a commercial theory that I should only ever have to pay the lowest sticker price on the cover, and that big yellow sticker couldn’t be any clearer.\n\nThis doesn’t feature a single song written by Albert King, and the sound has a little soul disco tinge that isn’t much of a surprise given that it came out in 1976, but it’s a real solid album."
