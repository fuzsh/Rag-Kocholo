King (no relation), Albert King (1923–1992) was one of the most influential blues artists in history, revered for his deft artistry on the electric guitar (most famously on a Gibson Flying V) and his deep, husky vocals. Combining an urgent Delta blues style with contemporary soul rhythms, King redefined the genre for the modern era.\n\nHeavyweight audiophile vinyl produced by Craft Recordings in 2023. Remastered from the original stereo tapes by Jeff Powell at Take Out Vinyl.\n\nTRACKLISTING:"
