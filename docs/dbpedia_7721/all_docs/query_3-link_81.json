        "text": "Brick By Brick by Iggy Pop\n\nIggy kicked off the 1990s with this album and got Don Was to take on production duties\n\nAlthough his output in the 1980s was a little hit and miss, Iggy started the next decade strongly with this album. Preceded by the single “Living On The Edge Of The Night”, the album didn’t really gain traction until after the second single, “Candy”, the duet with Kate Pierson of the B-52s, received high rotation on MTV. He also received positive reviews from critics, probably his best since his 1977 David Bowie-produced albums.\n\nFavourite track: “Butt Town”\n\nStill Got The Blues by Gary Moore\n\nThe Jimi Hendrix poster in this album cover is a lovely salute to one of Gary’s idols\n\nGary Moore decided to return to his blues roots after producing a variety of rock albums in the 80s. I doubt even he expected the unprecedented success he would have. This album reinvigorated his career and set the blueprint for the majority of his 90s output, if not the rest of his career. Getting guest artists the calibre of Albert King, George Harrison and Albert Collins to perform on the album probably didn’t hurt either.\n\nFavourite track: The self-penned “Texas Strut” featuring former Thin Lizzy bandmate Brian Downey on drums\n\nPassion And Warfare by Steve Vai\n\nVai claims that the album is based on dream sequences he had when he was younger\n\nVai sums the album up as “Jimi Hendrix meets Jesus Christ at a party that Ben Hur threw for Mel Blanc”. What that means is anybody’s guess. For me this album remains the pinnacle of his career, not because it is his most successful, but because it is his most accessible. I enjoy every track on it and I had only heard of him prior to this in the context of being David Lee Roth’s guitarist. Boy was this album a nice surprise!\n\nFavourite track: “The Audience Is Listening”\n\nViolator by Depeche Mode\n\nViolator was the album that converted me into a Depeche Mode fan\n\nAlthough I had liked the odd single from Depeche Mode, I had never been swayed to go out and purchase one of their albums. This album changed everything, not just for me, but for the band too. It was an international success and was their first album to sell a million copies in the US on the back of four successful singles.\n\nFavourite track: Even though an obvious choice, I couldn’t go past “Personal Jesus”. I even like the cover versions by Marilyn Manson and Johnny Cash.\n\nRagged Glory by Neil Young & Crazy Horse\n\nRagged Glory is Young’s 18th studio album and the 6th recorded with Crazy Horse\n\nI have always found that my favourite Neil Young music is the stuff he records with Crazy Horse. In my opinion, the band hasn’t rocked this hard together since 1975’s Zuma. This is also their first album together since the Re·ac·tor album in 1981. Thankfully Young would record another two albums with them in the 90s and fittingly, one with Pearl Jam too.\n\nFavourite track: The rollocking “Fuckin’ Up”\n\nWelcome once more to my on-again off-again blog. Despite my best intentions to post more regularly, sometimes, sadly, life gets in the way. This post follows on from my post on Fifties Guitar Masters as we move on to the next decade.\n\nThe 1960s was a decade of unprecedented development in terms of recorded popular music and an era of constant change. Naturally this was a fertile breeding ground that created a whole new generation of innovative guitarists.\n\nKicking off the 60s it would be hard to go past the legendary Hank Marvin. With The Shadows he virtually defined the sound of the guitar in the early part of the decade and was an inspiration to many who came after him.\n\nChoice Pick: check out the international chart-topper “Apache” released in July 1960\n\nYou couldn’t have a list of guitarists from the 1960s without including Jimi. Renowned for being so extraordinarily gifted that the guitar was considered an extension of his body, his recordings are as exemplary as they are limited. For a career so brief he certainly shone brightly.\n\nChoice Pick: Hard to go past his cover version of Bob Dylan’s “All Along The Watchtower” originally released in September 1968. Even Mr Zimmerman considered it the definitive version of his tune.\n\nThe first of three incredible guitarists to have a stint in The Yardbirds, Eric Clapton’s career has been like no other. The amount of different genres he’s covered during his career combined with his longevity can only lead one to conclude that he is peerless. Just list the bands he’s been in and any one of them would look good on a guitarist’s c.v. The Yardbirds, John Mayall & The Bluesbreakers, Cream, Derek and the Dominos and his solo stuff too!\n\nChoice Pick: For me his finest hour was the Derek and the Dominos period, but his solo on Cream’s live version of “Crossroads”, from 1968’s Wheels Of Fire, is one of the finest ever.\n\nThe second Yardbirds guitarist to feature in this list and one who has a very unique playing style. From his faux-slide playing using only his hands and a whammy bar, to doing away with a pick sometime during the 1980s, he has certainly developed his own “signature sound” on more than one occasion.\n\nChoice Pick: “Beck’s Bolero”, the B-side to his 1967 single “Hi Ho Silver Lining”, displays his talents exceptionally well. The recording featured the Who’s Keith Moon on drums and future Led Zeppelin members Jimmy Page and John Paul Jones.It was during the sessions for the tracks that would form Beck’s first solo album, Truth, that Page first heard the term “lead zeppelin”.\n\nWhich brings us to Jimmy Page, the third of the guitarists from The Yardbirds to feature in this post. Page formed Led Zeppelin from the debris of The Yardbirds, even to the point of going out on their first tour as The New Yardbirds, to meet some outstanding contractual obligations.\n\nChoice Pick: Hard to go past the blistering “Whole Lotta Love” from Led Zeppelin II, released in 1969.\n\nClapton’s replacement in John Mayall & The Bluesbreakers came with a unique sound and style all his own. He also founded Fleetwood Mac by convincing first Mick Fleetwood, then John McVie, to join him. Sadly, his drug use caused many years of decline during the 70s and 80s, before returning in the 90s better, yet not quite what he was in his youth.\n\nChoice Pick: His work on the John Mayall & The Bluesbreakers track, “The Super-Natural”, released on A Hard Road in 1968, is nothing short of spine-tingling.\n\nQ: Has their ever been a guitarist like Frank Zappa?\n\nA: Yes, his name is Dweezil.\n\nChoice Pick: Hard to go past the 1969 Mothers Of Invention single “My Guitar Wants To Kill Your Mama”.\n\nKeith earns the nickname Keef Riffhard for a reason. His riffs are second to none. He’s been known to wake in the middle of the night, strum a riff into a tape recorder by the side of his bed, then roll over and go back to sleep. He then listens the next day to decide if the riff is a keeper or not. Its where the riff for “(I Can’t Get No) Satisfaction” came from and many more.\n\nChoice Pick: “Sympathy For The Devil” from 1968’s Beggars Banquet, the beginning of a four-album golden period, in my humble opinion.\n\nCarlos built a reputation for himself after his blistering performance with Santana at Woodstock in 1969. The unheard-of band were included as a favour to promoter Bill Graham, who insisted after being called in to help with logistics and planning for the event.\n\nChoice Pick: “Soul Sacrifice” from debut album, Santana, released in 1969, is an excellent example of his work, although the studio version doesn’t capture the wild majesty of the Woodstock performance.\n\nAlbert King was blessed with two things. Precocious talent and the Stax house band, Booker T & the MGs. Recording together on his second studio album, his first for Stax, saw the creation of one of the definitive blues albums of the decade.\n\nChoice Pick: “Born Under A Bad Sign”, the title track from the aforesaid album, released in 1967.\n\nOften, people are remembered on the anniversary of their death. In the case of musicians, I’m more likely to think of them when I hear their music. I was reminded of just how great a performer Gary Moore was, after playing a track on my radio show last weekend.\n\nHe started his career with a band called Skid Row where he first met a young Phil Lynott. He would go on to have an on again-off again relationship with Lynott’s band Thin Lizzy during the 1970s. However, he only appeared on one studio album as a fully-fledged member of the band, the magnificent Black Rose from 1979.\n\nI can’t remember when I first heard Gary Moore solo but I remember obtaining his 1985 album, Run For Cover,on vinyl based on the strength of the single he performed with Phil Lynott, “Out In The Fields”. I wasn’t disappointed.\n\nHe was a very technically gifted guitarist and during his early solo albums he concentrated on a hard rock sound. He had success in the UK, and to a lesser extent in Australia, but he was idolised in Japan. He released a live album recorded in Japan in 1983 and seven studio albums during the course of the eighties. The most successful of these was 1987’s Wild Frontier and featured a cover version of the Easybeats track, “Friday On My Mind”.\n\nIn the 1990s he reinvented himself as bluesman, by returning to the kind of music that inspired him in his youth. “Still Got The Blues”, released in 1990, turned out to be the most successful album of his career and featured two legendary bluesmen in Albert King and Albert Collins.\n\nHis next studio album, After Hours, featured another blues legend in B.B. King before he formed a supergroup of sorts, with Jack Bruce and Ginger Baker of Cream fame. They called themselves BBM (Bruce-Baker-Moore) and released one album, Around The Next Dream in 1994.\n\nMoore would return to the blues on his tribute album to Peter Green, Blues For Greeny, released in 1995. Peter Green, founding guitarist of Fleetwood Mac, was an idol of Moore’s and he had sold Moore his 1959 Gibson Les Paul after Moore got to play support for Green with his first band, Skid Row. Blues For Greeny was recorded using that very same guitar on material composed by Green and originally recorded during his tenures with Fleetwood Mac and John Mayall & The Bluesbreakers.\n\nMoore then chose to modernise his sound on his next studio album, the excellent Dark Days In Paradise, released in 1997.\n\nIn the 21st century Moore once again focused on the blues, releasing another five studio blues albums between 2001 and 2008.\n\nIf you’ve never considered owning any of his albums there are plenty of compilations available for you to sample his wares, or you could dive right in with both feet and get hold of some of the albums featured in this blog post.\n\nWhat better way to remember a musician then by playing their material?\n\nI was fortunate enough to see several of my favourite blues guitarists/performers live in concert. The first was B.B. King at a gig at the Canberra Theatre in 1989. It was the first gig I can remember going to where the age groups ranged from 18 to 60 plus and the man himself was 63 at the time. An excellent live performance.\n\nThe next was Albert King in 1992 at the same venue, with Canned Heat as support. Another excellent gig but sadly Albert was dead six months later. I was extremely pleased to have taken the opportunity to see him when I did.\n\nThe next blues guitarist I got too see was Albert Collins with his band the Icebreakers in 1993. The man was the consummate professional and his performance that night could only be desrcibed as “blistering”. Six months after seeing him in concert he was dead too.\n\nIt was at this time I started to believe in the “Albert” curse. Two magicians seen live in concert dead within 6 months of me seeing them. I am very worried about the next musician I see live called Albert."
