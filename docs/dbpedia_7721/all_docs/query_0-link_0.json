During the earlier part of his career, he recorded several singles for smaller record labels. In 1966, he began an association with Stax Records, where he enjoyed his greatest commercial success with both singles and albums. His 1967 album, Born Under a Bad Sign, has been acknowledged as one of the most important blues albums.[1][2][3]\n\nAfter Stax's bankruptcy in 1975, King recorded for several smaller labels. Meanwhile, his former record companies issued a number of live recordings, compilations, and re-packaged material. This trend accelerated after King's death in 1992, resulting in some charting releases as well as the inevitable redundancies.\n\nAlbums 1962–1992\n\n[edit]\n\nStudio albums\n\n[edit]\n\nList of studio albums with year, title, label, and chart peak Year Title Label (Cat. no.)
