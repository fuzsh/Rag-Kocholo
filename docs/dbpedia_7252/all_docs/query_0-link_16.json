        "text": "What is immediately noticeable is that the plot of the film and the book are almost identical, and that the narrative structure is very similar with very little out of place. The main difference however is that the various meetings that take place throughout the film, as Carter tries to get information from people, take place in the book mainly in nondescript pubs, whereas the film uses its Newcastle location to excellent effect.\n\nThe book, by general consent, is set in Scunthorpe, although the town itself is never named. There are several clues to this. The book begins with Carter on the train from Euston to Doncaster, where he has to catch a connection. There is a train service from Doncaster to Scunthorpe, and the timing is about right - Carter arrives in Doncaster at 5pm and is in a pub in the town at 7:15pm. But of course the one thing that is constantly mentioned throughout the book is that the town (or rather \"Too big for a town, too small for a city\") is a steel town, so it could only be Scunthorpe.\n\nIn the film, when Keith asks Carter who Brumby is, Carter asks \"Ever been to Westsea? Ever been to an arcade there and put a penny in the slot machine? \" whereas in the book instead:\n\n'Cliff Brumby?' I said. Ever been to Cleethorpes?'\n\nKeith nodded.\n\n'Ever walked into an arcade and put a penny in a slot machine?'\n\n'Yes,' said Keith.\n\n'Well, ten to one the slot machine belongs to Brumby and like as not the bloody arcade as well. Same in Brid and Skeggie...\" [referring obviously to Bridlington and Skegness].\n\nAgain, although Bridlington is up the coast towards the North-East, the references to Cleethorpes and Skegness make it clear that the book is set in this area of North=East Lincolnshire. There is even more confirmation when Carter has to go to Grimsby to get heroin from a dealer.\n\nIt is fascinating to hear why the location was changed from Scunthorpe to Newcastle, and Mike Hodges, who wrote the screenplay from Lewis's novel as well as directing, is wihout doubt the best person to explain how this happened:\n\n\"I can't remember why I didn't locate the film in a steel town. Maybe because I didn't know any...[whilst in the Navy] they took me to...every fishing port in the British Isles...I melted into a world of brutal Hogarthian intensity, and was mesmerized. These were the places I kept thinking of as I read 'Jack's Return Home'.\n\nLowestoft. Grimsby. Hull. Each had been decimated by developers.The pubs, cafes and dodgy boarding houses gone. Thirteen years had passed. The producer, Michael Klinger, had insisted that he, his driver and Yank car take me on my recce up the east coast.\"\n\nHodges however describes how he remembered one last place:\n\n\"On the brink of returning south, I remembered sailing into North Shields. My memories of it were vivid. We pressed on and came to Newcastle. The visual drama of the place took my breath away. Seeing the great bridges crossing the Tyne, the waterfront, the terraced house stepped up each side of the deep valley, I knew that Jack was home. And although the developers were breathing down Scotswood Road, they hadn't yet gobbled it up. We'd got there in time. But only just.\"\n\n(from Mike Hodges's Preface to the screenplay, published by ScreenPress Books 2001)\n\nThis goes a long way to explain Get Carter's appeal, and the reason that it plays such an important part in North-East film culture, and why there are so many websites and tours devoted to the subject of Get Carter's locations.\n\nOne minor aspect of the film which I have always wondered about is the (brief) element where Carter asks Doreen what she is going to do now, and offers her the chance to go to South America with him and his fiancee (referring to Anna). Doreen does not seem very keen and the matter is dropped (indeed, he only sees her one more time in the film, when he gives her some money and she returns to a cafe with her friend - see above). I have read articles where this offer is described as 'fantasy' and 'wish-fulfilment', but the book makes it clear (unless Carter is deluding himself, and he is not a character who suffers from delusions!) that it is an idea very grounded in reality. In the novel Carter says to Doreen:\n\n'I'm off to South Africa next week. With a woman I may or may not end up marrying. We're flying on Wednesday. I've got three tickets. Why don't you come with us?'\n\nThere is clear evidence that this is not just a fantasy - later, Carter returns to the house where Doreen is asleep, and he starts thinking:\n\nI tried to see something of Frank in her but I'd stared at her for too long: she was just a young girl I'd met for the first time that morning. A young girl I'd been to a funeral with.\n\nAnd now in a way, it didn't matter who she was. If she came to South Africa with me and Audrey then it was up to me to take up where Frank'd left off. Mine or not, like it or not. Whatever she felt about me wouldn't matter all that much: she'd never be short of anything if she came with us. If she came. If she didn't I wasn't going to make her. She could suit herself. I always had done. If she didn't come I'd make arrangements for her to have set amounts of cash from time to time.\n\nThe offer is repeated later, but Carter refers to it again when he rings a contact, Maurice, during which call the latter tells Carter that Audrey (Anna in the film) has been 'got at' by Gerald. Carter speaks first in this section of the book:\n\n'What's she like?'\n\n'A write-off.'\n\nSo that was that. Now there was Gerald as well as the others. Eventually Maurice said:\n\n'Jack?'\n\n'Yeah, listen. You get her out of it, right? Tomorrow, Monday, whenever she can be moved. Same plan. But get her away.'\n\n'Right. What shall I tell her about you?'\n\n'Nothing.'\n\n'She'll want to know. She might not go if I don't tell her something.'\n\n'All right. Tell her I'll follow her next week. Tell her it's taking longer than I thought. But make it sound good. Make her believe it's the truth. Otherwise she won't go and that won't do.'\n\nMy interpretation of this is that, firstly, Carter intends to kill Gerald Fletcher as well now, and secondly, that the phrase 'same plan' means they really were going to South Africa (not South America, as in the film, a less likely destination) but that Carter is now not going, or at least not until he sorts out the others, including Gerald. This gives a very clear idea of what Carter's plans are once he sorts out Frank's killers, whereas in the film this is something of a forgotten loose end (which becomes irrelevant anyway due to the introduction of Kinnear's hitman who shoots Carter dead). In the film the offer to go to South America is made twice, this clip places the two scenes together:"
