        "text": "My first brush with Get Carter was a late night TV broadcast that was preceded by some words that, thankfully, we don’t hear any more: “The following film has been edited for TV audiences”.\n\nThat meant not only was it pan-and-scan (everything was in those days) but it was censored for violence and nudity. I, of course, understood that it was not a complete film, but had no idea what had been removed, and the film was still mesmerising. A violent, gritty revenge drama about a seemingly unstoppable thug who terrorises a northern gangster ring that ends suddenly and shockingly. I was hooked.\n\nIt was a few years later, when Alex Cox was hosting his ‘Moviedrome’ show on BBC2 and in his introduction to the film proudly stated that this was the uncensored theatrical release and was not for the fainthearted, and I was thrilled to see it, again, for the first time. Now this was a film, with the reinstated violence and nudity, though still pan-and-scan, the film suddenly had a raw power that was missing from the sanitised version, not only was it violent and gritty, but it was urgent, desperate and visceral. Jack was as relentless as a Terminator in his pursuit of those that killed his brother, scheming to bring down the entire mob while taking vicious, bloody revenge. It has been a firm favourite of mine ever since.\n\n... now regarded as the pure classic it has been all along\n\nAlthough uncredited as such, star Michael Caine acted as co-producer on the project, and it is largely due to his influence, based on personal experience, that the character of Jack was so thoroughly disreputable and mean. Director Mike Hodges wanted a gritty feel, and with Caine putting in perhaps his best performance to date, it really felt like a lightning in a bottle moment. Indeed, Hodges made sure of it by ensuring Jack couldn’t come back for more, unlike the book where he had two more ‘adventures’ the cinematic incarnation is one strike and you’re out, it making the character and the film everlasting, the purest case of less is more.\n\nAlthough touted as a tough gangland ‘gangster’ film, it really isn’t; sitting more in the murder/revenge camp with mystery thriller overtones, Get Carter crosses genres. Wolfgang Suschitzky’s cinematography, along with Hodges' directing style gave the film a hard, cold look, perfectly matching the tone of its lead character. Jack is not a hero, he’s barely an anti-hero, and it is tough to root for him due to the uncompromising attitude he has. It’s this trait that gave the film such a hard time on its initial release; thankfully, cooler heads prevailed and it is now regarded as the pure classic it has been all along.\n\nGet Carter was shot on 35mm film using Panavision R200 cameras, and for this release the BFI has newly scanned the original camera negative in 4K (16bit), and then extensive colour grading, manual cleaning and restoration has taken place, with director Mike Hodges being consulted and signing off all through the process.\n\nThe disc presents a native 3840 x 2160p resolution image, in the widescreen 1.85:1 aspect ratio, uses 10-bit video depth, High Dynamic Range (HDR), a Wide Colour Gamut (WCG) and is encoded using the HEVC (H.265) codec for Dolby Vison and HRD10.\n\nWe reviewed the Region free UK Ultra HD Blu-ray release of Get Carter on a Panasonic TX-65HZ1000B Ultra HD 4K TV with a Panasonic DP-UB450 Dolby Vision HDR10+ 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray player.\n\nLike seeing it for the first time\n\n“Like seeing it for the first time”, might be a clichéd saying, but with regard to this new print, it really is.\n\nDetail is stunning throughout; from skin texture to clothing weaves, grimy streets, to crumbling brickwork, peeling paint to car dashboards, newspaper headlines to bingo posters, everything is clear, clean and keen. Check out how stark and defined the cranes are against the sky, the city vistas, the sharpness of headlights against dark, the carving in the shotgun; simply stunning.\n\nWCG and HDR give the naturally dour colour palette a naturalistic boost and maintain the gritty realism while bringing out the natural richness of the primaries; check out the flashes of deep red, clothing, lights or the bingo hall. There is very little green, but the odd patch of grass is beautifully natural, while blues maintain their coolness.\n\nBlack level is deep and strong, hiding good shadow detail but being impenetrable when required. The whole picture is a tad darker than before, bringing out the sombre tone more, while the white scale pushes the image; bright lights, highlights, metallic sheen etc.\n\nDigitally there are no compression issues, the original print is in magnificent shape, being clean with no signs of damage, and the grain structure is intact, being rich, full, heavy at times, but maintaining an incredibly filmic presentation. Outstanding\n\nThe extras package is amazing, with all new features and interviews as well as legacy material; the limited (to 10,000 copies) set has a whole bunch of extra material including a very readable booklet.\n\n... the extras package is amazing\n\nLimited edition 2-disc set (10,000 copies)\n\nNewly recorded introduction by Michael Caine (2022, 3 mins)\n\nAudio commentary featuring Michael Caine, Mike Hodges and Wolfgang Suschitzky (2000)\n\nNewly recorded audio commentary featuring Kim Newman and Barry Forshaw\n\nIsolated score by Roy Budd\n\nMike Hodges in Conversation (2022, 60 mins): the director discusses his career in this interview recorded at BFI Southbank\n\nThe Sound of Roy Budd (2022, 17 mins): film music expert Jonny Trunk explores the varied career of Roy Budd, and revisits Budd’s iconic, minimalist score for Get Carter\n\nRoy Budd Plays ‘Get Carter’ (1971, 4 mins)\n\nBBC Look North location report (1970, 5 mins): surviving footage of a 1971 report on Get Carter’s making, from the BBC’S regional news programme\n\nDon’t Trust Boys (2022, 22 mins): actor Petra Markham reflects upon her career on stage and screen, and recalls her role in Get Carter\n\nKlinger on Klinger (2022, 24 mins): Tony Klinger recalls and evaluates the career of his father, Michael Klinger, producer of Get Carter\n\nThe Ship Hotel – Tyne Main (1967, 33 mins): Philip Trevelyan's wonderful film about a pub on the banks of the River Tyne\n\nInternational trailer (1971)\n\nRelease trailer (2022)\n\nMichael Caine's message to premiere attendees (1971, 1 min)\n\nScript gallery\n\n80-page book featuring new writing by Mark Kermode, Tim Pelan, John Oliver and Jason Wood.
