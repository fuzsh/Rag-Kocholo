        "text": "Is there anything better than reading outside? With sunlight beaming down on the pages, a breeze riffling your hair and a frosty drink close to hand, it feels like a precious treat to get lost in a great novel. To make sure that your summer reading list is full of hits—without a hint of the duty read that sometimes accompanies a looming TBR pile—we, the Kit team, picked our favourite reads of the summer, from spicy romances to family sagas that never feel like a slog. Time to crack one open, or cue it up, and fall down the rabbit hole.\n\nLong Island Compromise by Taffy Brodesser-Akner\n\nSince developing an audiobook habit six months ago, I’ve listened to almost 50 novels that could be classified as “beach reads.” In search of escapism while cooking, cleaning and commuting, I’ve enjoyed the ouvres of Emily Henry, Carley Fortune, Ali Hazelwood, Tessa Bailey, Tia Williams, Jackie Lau and Yulin Kuang (I’d especially recommend Henry’s People We Meet on Vacation and Kuang’s How to End a Love Story.)\n\nBut this summer, the book I’ve become obsessed with reading, as opposed to listening to, is Long Island Compromise, the latest novel by Fleischman Is In Trouble author and celebrity magazine-profile writer extraordinaire Taffy Brodesser Akner. It’s a study of a wealthy Long Island Jewish family’s intertwining neuroses, which all stem from the patriarch’s days-long kidnapping ordeal when the kids were very young. It’s about how a traumatic event can rear its head throughout our lives in ways both profound and silly (the oily film producer brother can only seem to come up with movie ideas that involve a kidnapping). And it’s about rich people problems, like the wildly pessimistic brother’s lavish kitchen renovations that reveal his entire house is in danger of falling down, or the sister who rebels against the family’s factory-derived fortune and becomes a passionate union organizer. There is so much to wince and chuckle over in this book, and it never feels like a slog—it’s a true delight to read, in summer or anytime. —Rani Sheen\n\nBook Lovers by Emily Henry\n\nThis book brought me so much joy. On the surface, it’s a classic tale of opposites attract—sworn enemies who, through a series of misadventures, realize they’re soulmates—an enduring rom-com trope, for a reason. But with its wit and warmth, it’s so much more interesting than it needs to be. The plot is straightforward: Nora Stephens is a cut-throat New York book agent, an unapologetic career woman who wears heels and French lingerie and would do anything for her authors. Charlie Lastra is a scowly, sexy book editor with a complicated past. (Are they both misunderstood? What do you think?) Somehow, they find themselves in Sunshine Falls, a tiny North Carolina town. Hijinx, puns and steamy situations abound. If you’re a book lover yourself, it’s a must-read. —Laura deCarufel\n\nLies and Weddings by Kevin Kwan\n\nWhen it comes to picking a book, I’m always looking for an escape–one that whisks me away from reality, preferably somewhere joyful and glamorous. And no one paints a better escape with words than author Kevin Kwan. It’s been four years since his last book, Sex and Vanity, and I realize now how much I missed his storytelling. His latest book, Lies & Weddings, revolves around the same crazy rich world where Kwan name drops luxury fashion brands, locations and It spots, so you know exactly what each character is wearing, eating and driving in any scene. While also serving as glam travel guide to some of the most fabulous destinations (Hawaii, Marrakech, Venice, Hong Kong–to name a few), the book is another satirical study of the crazy rich (and Asian) that will leave you rolling your eyes and laughing out loud at the outrageousness of it all. (As a Chinese-Canadian reader, it’s especially entertaining for me to see how spot-on Kwan is depicting the culture. #iykyk) But it’s not a Kevin Kwan book without some scandal and shocking plot twists to put the main players in their places. If you’re obsessed with his Crazy Rich Asians series or love a bit of rom-com laced with mystery, you’ll be thoroughly entertained by his latest read–guaranteed. —Renée Tse\n\nKnives, Seasoning, and a Dash of Love by Katrina Kwan\n\nIf you’ve spent three seasons of The Bear pining for something to happen between Carmy and Sydney, allow this delicious debut to curb that craving instead. He’s a hot shot in haute cuisine in his lukewarm era; she’s the sous chef with an uncanny ability to make anything if she’s seen it demonstrated once but a resumé whose details don’t bear scrutiny. Add a few Nigella-level sensuous descriptions of food and heat in an oven warmed to the temperature of five chili peppers on BookTok’s spicy scale, and you’ve got yourself the perfect romance read, ready to be served just in time for Labour Day. As a further garnish, this is by a Vancouver-based author publishing under her own name after ghostwriting romances for other people. —Sarah Laing\n\nThe Paper Palace by Miranda Cowley Heller\n\nThe former books editor at Cosmopolitan and former head of drama series at HBO, working on such shows as The Sopranos and The Wire, Miranda Cowley Heller knows a good story. In her debut novel, from 2021, The Paper Palace, the story she tells—a love triangle, a memoir, an examination of mother-daughter dynamics, an account of sexual abuse survival—is one I could not, as they say, put down. On one hand, it’s the story of Elle Bishop’s entire life, reaching back to her ’70s childhood, and the story of her mother’s life, and the abuse they both endured (which pops up early and very graphically, be warned). At other times, it’s a present-day account of her emotional struggle of being torn between her lovely marriage and a lifelong friendship that it has become impossible to deny is actually a lifelong romantic love. And they’re all together at the cottage! I read it in bed, on transit, at every meal, at my kitchen counter waiting for the kettle to boil—basically any time I wasn’t moving. When I finished, my mother read my copy in just two days, at which point, we breathlessly convened to discuss the ending—heatedly. In fact, in Google search, “the Paper Palace ending,” comes right after “the Paper Palace book,” such is its polarizing, and for many, mysterious and confusing, conclusion. Did I read that right? What did that mean? Did she…? —Eden Boileau"
