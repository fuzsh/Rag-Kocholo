        "text": "2000\n\nCity Locations\n\nWashington: Seattle, Tacoma; Nevada: Las Vegas; Canada: Vancouver, British Columbia\n\nLocation Types\n\nApartment, American, House, Buildings/Offices, Clubs/Bars, NatureScapes\n\nLocation Styles\n\nAmericana/Anywhere America, Foreign, Federal Building, Hotel/Motel Style\n\nAbout Get Carter\n\nIn the opening Get Carter film scene, Jack Carter, a mafia henchman, comes back to Seattle upon hearing the news that his brother Ritchie died in an unfortunate drunk driving collision.\n\nWhile attending his brotherâs funeral service, Jack encounters his niece Doreen and a friend of Ritchieâs named Eddie. They inform Jack that Ritchie was not a drinker and would never drive when drunk. Eddie also states that Ritchie would not involve himself in illegal things. Carter speaks to a lady named Geraldine who will not share her relationship with his brother. Carter continues to try to find out information about his brotherâs death, enraging Eddieâs widow Gloria.\n\nCarter speaks to the owner of the club where Ritchie worked. His boss, Brumby, does not suspect foul play in Ritchieâs death but does confirm an affair with Geraldine who is the girlfriend of the local mob boss, Paice. Jack speaks to Paice who reveals nothing. He tails Paice to Jeremy Kinnear, a computer magnate Paice sourced women for. Paice is now using this information against Kinnear to force him to run pornographic sites for him. Without any answers, Jack begins scrutinizing the camera footage from Brumbyâs club.\n\nHe finds out about Paiceâs home porn films that feature women that were drugged and then sexually assaulted by both Eddie and Geraldine. Doreen is one of the victimized women. Geraldine discovered Doreen was Ritchieâs daughter and gave him the footage, but Ritchie was killed before he could take the tape to the authorities.\n\nCarter embarks on a journey for revenge. Geraldine apologizes and informs Carter about Paiceâs plans to kill her. Carter discovers her dead body and then seeks to find Paice. Eddie informs him he is at Kinnearâs, and Carter throws Eddie from the balcony.\n\nMcCarty, Carterâs former partner, finds Carter, and a car chase ensues. McCarty crashes his car, and it is presumed that all in his vehicle are dead. Carter corners Paice who implicates Kinnear in Ritchieâs death. Carter tries to attack Paice from behind, but Paice ducks the blow. Paice beats him and tells him that Ritchie fought harder than he is now, an admission of his involvement in Ritchieâs murder.\n\nPaice leaves for the dance floor with Carter following him. The fight continues. Carter beats him to death. Carter finds Kinnear who informs him that his only role was in asking Paice to get the tape back from Ritchie. He tells him Paice and Brumby murdered his brother.\n\nCarter finds Brumby in a parking lot trying to steal the tape from his car. Brumby admits to his part in the murder but tells Carter that murdering him will mean he will spend the rest of his life on the run. Brumby starts to walk away from him. Jack calls his name, but Brumby keeps walking, so Jack shoots him.\n\nCarter walks into a darkened building. He faces a stairway leading up. He walks up the stairs and finds Eddie upstairs. Eddie immediately tries to back away from an angry Carter, blaming Paice and Kinnear for killing his brother Ritchie. The following conversation takes place in this action scene in Get Carter.\n\nEddie (being thrown against a wall by Carter): Ah! What? They knew what they were f*cking getting intoâ¦\n\nCarter: Donât play me!\n\nEddie: I thought it was Cyrusâ deal, man. He probably killed your brother. Right? It wasnât fcking me! Heâs at a fcking party right now. Thatâs the fcking fancy club or something with Kinnear, alright? I was just playing. I was just fcking playing around. Go get them, man, I donâtâ¦\n\nCarter: Iâm having a real hard time understanding something Eddie. What could she have done to you that was so bad that youâd want to do this to her? Hmmm? Because what you did doesnât go away! She trusted you, and you raped her. She was my brotherâs daughter, my family, and itâs my fault. Because if I had been here, this NEVER would have gone down. So now I gotta make it right, I gotta do that. I mean what would you do if it was your daughter?\n\nEddie: Jack, donât kill me, man.\n\nCarter: You killed yourself.\n\nCarter throws him off the balcony and exits the building.\n\nTo visit this Get Carter location which is now the site of a business known as Town Pantry, take bus lines 3 or R4 or board the SkyTrainâs Canada Line.\n\nCarter goes to Kinnearâs house and finds a party in full swing. He walks through the halls of the house until he discovers Paice with some women. Paice tells the girls to go in the back while he talks with Carter. This conversation ensues in one of the best scenes in Get Carter.\n\nCarter: Did you know who she was?\n\nPaice: Excuse me?\n\nCarter: Did you know she was my blood?\n\nPaice: Jack, are we gonna go through this gddmned moondance again? Go ahead. Take out your gun, Jack, take out your gun in front of all of these people here and put one right between my eyes. I donât think you could handle jail for the rest of your life, Jack. I want to tell you something, slick, the man you want is that little pssass Kinnear.\n\nTo get to this former Get Carter film set, you can take bus lines 19, 22, 246, 250, or R5 or board the SkyTrain routes Canada Line or Expo Line. A short walk will take you to the Fairmont. Hotel, formerly known as the Mercer Hotel. One of the suites found in this iconic property provided the set for this well-known Get Carter scene.\n\nCarter trails Paice and a lady friend as they enter a private property. He approaches the gate, and the guard asks him if he is a member. He informs the guard he is with a âMr. Franklinâ and is granted entrance to the property.\n\nHe walks to the golf green where he spies Paice threatening Kinnear. When Paice notices Carter, he immediately takes off. The following conversation takes place between Carter and Kinnear.\n\nCarter: Nice stroke!\n\nKinnear: Who the f*ck are you?\n\nCarter: Tiger Woods.\n\nKinnear: Iâm gonna get security, alright? Hey, can I help you, sir?\n\nCarter: I donât know.\n\nKinnear: Are you from the club? Is there a problem?\n\nCarter: My brother died the other night, and now Iâm here.\n\nKinnear: Listen Mrâ¦\n\nCarter: Carter.\n\nKinnear: Mr. Carter, um, Iâm real sorry about your brother. That, that sucks, but I canât help you here, so what I suggest you do is contact my outreach program over at the officesâ¦\n\nCarter: Mind if we talk a minute?\n\nKinnear: Uh, yes, yes, I mind. I was under the impression this was a private club.\n\nCarter: I think we should go someplace and talk.\n\nKinnear: Okay, listen, scary manâ¦\n\nCarter: Do I scare you?\n\nKinnear: Okay, whatever this is, it isnât going over real well, Soâ¦\n\nCarter: Look, Iâll tell you what, why donât you drive me over to my car? We can talk on the way. Is that a problem?\n\nKinnear: Yeah, it is a problem.\n\nCarter: No, no, itâs a problem if you donât.\n\nLocated just 43 minutes from downtown Vancouver, you can easily reach this former Get Carter film set by traveling along BC-99N directly into Furry Creek and then taking the exit for Furry Creek Drive. Continue along this route until you reach the turn for Country Club Road. Your destination can be found just up the street."
