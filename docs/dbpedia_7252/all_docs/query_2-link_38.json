        "text": "“You’re a big man, but you’re in bad shape. With me it’s a full time job. Now behave yourself” Jack Carter\n\nOf all the films covered so far in this blog Get Carter is probably the most highly praised. It features in a number of lists of the top British films and even comes out on top in some of those. At its heart Get Carter is a revenge thriller. Caine stars as the eponymous Jack Carter a mid-level East-end gangster who returns to his native Newcastle when he is unconvinced by a verdict of suicide following his brother’s death. When his suspicions of foul play are confirmed he quickly sets to exacting his own revenge on the local underworld involved in the conspiracy.\n\nThe revenge thriller isn’t generally a genre particularly highly critically regarded in the world of cinema. What sets Get Carter apart is the way that it tackles the subject. It consciously avoids any glorification of the violence on show and there is significantly more subtlety than other films of a similar theme. Crucial to that is the character of Jack Carter himself. While there may be a few reviews of the film that describe Carter as an anti-Hero the reality is that there is nothing heroic about the character at all. Yes the people he is hunting down and delivering his own brand of justice to are unpleasant criminals engaged in deplorable activities, but there is little doubt he is equally as bad. There are moments in the early part of the film when he does seem to show some nicer qualities, but what the film does so well is to slowly erode them and show just how unpleasant he really is. This can be seen in his relationship with Keith, played by a young Alun Armstrong and also Edna played by Rosemarie Dunham. Edna is the unlucky lonely landlady who Carter rents a room from as he arrives in Newcastle. When they first meet Carter is charming towards her and offers to pay for the first night he is there despite not needing the room immediately. What is obvious very quickly though is that Carter has no sense of conscience about the chaos and violence that he is about to bring into her world. His offer to pay extra is also cheapened as we discover throughout the film that his response to any discomfort caused to others is just to throw some money in their general direction. That is clearest in his response to Keith after he is the victim of a brutal beating after being left by Carter to fend for himself. He is shown no loyalty and despite the help that he has given to Carter he receives no sympathy and instead just another offer of a handful of notes for his trouble.\n\nThe scene where Carter visits a bed ridden Keith suffering the after effects of his beating are another example of the subtlety in the storytelling. As Keith is left by Carter he yells out after him, berating him for his selfishness and in among his accusations it is stated that Doreen, who we are first introduced to as Carter’s niece may in fact be his daughter as a result of an affair with his brother’s wife. It’s a possibility that is only mentioned that once and is never confirmed or denied, but it adds an extra layer to the moment when Carter realises that Doreen is at the centre of events that led to his brother’s death. In a poorer film the audience wouldn’t have been trusted to remember the link and the possibility would have been laid on with a trowel. Here it is handled with much more delicacy and that is a tribute to the storytelling of director Mike Hodges who also wrote the screenplay based on the original source novel.\n\nGet Carter was Hodges’ first feature film after a decade working in television and it’s a remarkable debut. It’s initial scene as Carter sits with his East-End gangster bosses has more than a touch of The Ipcress File with its tinkling soundtrack and camera focusing in on a projector showing a slide show of images. From the point of the opening titles and Carter heads off to Newcastle the film shows a style all of its own though that in turn would influence countless future films and directors. The most oft-quoted example is its influence on Quentin Tarantino who has described it as his favourite British film. As Carter makes his journey dressed smartly in his suit with a funky soundtrack in the background that influence is noticeable whether you are aware of the quote or not. Hodges skill as a director is particularly noticeable in the way he frames two of the more sexually charged scenes in the film. The first sees Carter engaging in a sexual phone conversation with his secret lover who is romantically entangled with his East-End mob boss. Britt Ekland plays Anna and the scene is made more notable by the fact Carter makes the phone call on the main telephone in his rented accommodation with the lonely and sexually frustrated Edna gently rocking on her chair also in the room with him. The intercuts between Anna and Edna with the slowly quickening squeaks of her rocking chair make for an entrancing scene while also giving another window into the character of Carter and his own confidence in himself as being at the centre of the universe. The second comes as a sex scene between Carter and Glenda is intercut with her wild and dramatic driving. It’s another classy piece of direction that helps to build a stylish and believable world. There are other moments that don’t work quite as well. Our first introduction to Kinnear as played by playwright John Osborne at a card game and the attempts to frame the shot with players just visible over the shoulders of others doesn’t work as well and feels a little like it is trying too hard to make the game visually striking. That is an exception though and overall Hodges’ direction is key to the glowing reputation the film still enjoys nearly five decades after its release.\n\nThere is no doubt that the casting of Caine in the main role was a huge help to Hodges’ who makes great use of the visual contrast he creates. Seeing his imposing figure dressed in expensive suits set against the often grim industrial background of early seventies Newcastle makes for some genuinely iconic imagery, even if one of the most iconic moments involves Caine wearing nothing at all, but holding a shotgun. Caine is simply outstanding in the role. Carter is a figure who saunters into a city and brings chaos and disaster to pretty much everybody he meets. It’s right then that Caine seems to have an ability to draw the camera. The scene where he visits a busy racecourse is the perfect example of this as even in a bustling crowd he seems to stand out on the screen. The tone of his performance is perfect throughout. From the very beginning he exudes a quiet menace that even before his first act of physical violence leaves you in little doubt of the threat he carries. When he does eventually start to exact his revenge it is brutal, calculated and efficient. There is no long protracted glamour to the violence. Carter is professional about how he does things and doesn’t use two strikes when one will do. That coupled with Caine’s understated performance means that when much later in the film as he loses his cool and becomes increasingly angry and brutal it is doubly effective. Even then though there are still room for more subtle quiet moments, such as the little smile Caine delivers as Carter watches the bond between a young girl and her mother.\n\nThough Caine is the undoubted star of proceedings the remaining cast are equally strong. As well as those already mentioned there’s a wonderful partnership between George Sewell and the always terrific Italian Job alumni Tony Beckley as the heavies sent to usher Carter back to the capital. It’s a classy cast even in these minor roles with Armstrong in his first feature film particularly effecting and regular Caine co-star Glynn Edwards following up roles in Zulu and The Ipcress File with a typically solid outing. After Caine it’s possibly Ian Hendry who makes the biggest impression though as he delivers a brilliantly unsympathetic turn as Eric the chief villain of the piece.\n\nHodges’ makes great use of the whole cast as he creates a grim and unforgiving world (given the grim realistic tone of his film debut it makes the change in tone for his other most famous work the camp cult classic Flash Gordon all the more dramatic). Crucially thanks to his direction and the nature of Caine’s performance they manage to maintain the sense that the violence on show is ultimately self-defeating without any sense of heroism. None of the large cast of characters come out from the events in the film unscathed with even those who at least make it out with their lives nonetheless damaged in some other way. Most importantly though is the realisation that even after all the violence and killing Carter still doesn’t come out a winner. Meeting his end friendless and alone with the end credits playing without music, just the sound of the wind and waves.\n\nGet Carter fully deserves its place on any list of the most highly regarded British films. It is undoubtedly one of Caine’s finest performances and influenced an enormous amount of British and Hollywood crime films for decades to come. For all it’s imitators though Get Carter remains the jewel in the crown. A genuine classic."
