        "text": "Paul McCartney is giving fans a closer-than-ever look at the historic recording sessions for his 1974 live in-studio One Hand Clapping album with Wings in a new documentary film, set to arrive this fall.\n\nPaul McCartney and Wings - One Hand Clapping premieres September 26 in an exclusive cinema event. The film dives in the making of the seminal album, featuring rare footage from the performance restored in 4K, interviews with band members and more.\n\n\"It's so great to look back on that period and see the little live show we did,\" McCartney said in a statement. \"We made a pretty good noise actually! It was a great time for the band, we started to have success with Wings, which had been a long time coming.\"\n\nThe full documentary, directed by David Litchfield, also features the previously unreleased Backyard Sessions, a live solo acoustic performance by McCartney, in which the singer-songwriter performs highlights from his catalog and a selection of other important songs from his life."
