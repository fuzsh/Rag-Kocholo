        "text": "It's 50 years since Get Carter was first shown in British cinemas.\n\nStarring Michael Caine, the dark, brooding gangster flick was a seminal influence on the likes of The Long Good Friday and Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels which followed in later years.\n\nBut aside from its undoubted cinematographic merits, it remains a fascinating time capsule, capturing locations in Newcastle and the wider North East on the cusp of change as the 1970s dawned.\n\nWith a budget of £750,000, the movie employed the people and places of the region as a dramatic backdrop to the action.\n\nThe plot is well-documented. Based on the 1970 Ted Lewis book, Jack's Return Home, London mobster Jack Carter returns to his home town to avenge the killing of his brother and unleashes a wave of violence and death.\n\nThe book was originally set in Hull and Scunthorpe, but director Mike Hodges transferred the action to Tyneside, having visited the area and been impressed with it in the 1950s during his two years' national service in the Royal Navy.\n\nThe bulk of the action was filmed in the North East during 1970 and there was much press interest in the presence of 36-year-old Michael Caine, the big-name star of such movie hits as Zulu (1964), Alfie (1966), and The Italian Job (1969).\n\nGet Carter enjoyed its European premiere at the ABC cinema in Newcastle's Haymarket on Sunday, March 7, 1971. The screening was preceded by an official reception at Newcastle Civic Centre, hosted by the Lord Mayor of Newcastle.\n\nThere was no sign of Caine, but two of the stars of the film, Rosemarie Dunham who played the lonely guest house landlady Edna, and Geraldine Moffat who portrayed the ill-fated gangster's moll, Glenda, were in attendance.\n\nWhen the film opened to the public at the Haymarket that week, it carried an 'X' certificate and was screened four times each day.\n\nThe verdict of the local newspapers after the first showing was uniformly positive.\n\nThe Chronicle reported: \"The film has been showing in America for some weeks and is doing good business.\n\n\"Caine is good. There is plenty of sex and violence - all well done and tastefully photographed.\n\n\"Tyneside, thanks to the arty-type filming comes out of the film well. The warts are made use of, but then all industrial cities have warts.\"\n\nOur sister title, The Journal, declared: \"Michael Caine heads the cast but the real star is Newcastle.\n\n\"The place and its atmosphere are as much a part of the film as Paris was in Rififi or San Francisco in Bullitt.\"\n\nCertainly the scenes capturing Newcastle's West End, the River Tyne ferry at Wallsend, and the bookmaker's shop in Hebburn, among others, recall a gritty depiction of old Tyneside that has since been consigned to history.\n\nDirector Mike Hodges was grabbed by the tough urban environment. “The visual drama took my breath away,” he said. “Seeing the great bridges crossing the Tyne, the waterfront, the terraced houses stepped up each side of the deep valley… We’d got there in time. But only just.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the film's producer Michael Klinger pointed out: \"It's not just the marvellous locations. It's the faces as well. There are no tired old agency extras in this film. All the crowd are characters.\"\n\nEnjoy our first 10 then-and-now Get Carter location shots. Watch out for parts two and three of our feature on ChronicleLive in the coming days."
