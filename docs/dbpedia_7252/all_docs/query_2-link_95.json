        "text": "The following topic of conversation came up recently: \"What was the first news story you remember following as a kid?\"\n\nMy answer was the Iran hostage crisis from 1979 through 1981 which lasted for 444 days. Later, however, I remembered the breaking news of August 16th, 1977. I'll never forget programming being interrupted with the news of the death of Elvis Presley. That was, in fact, the first time I ever remember seeing some form of \"Breaking News\" announcement come across the TV screen.\n\nA monumental news item if ever there was one, the news of Presley's passing was a gut punch. Yes, celebrities--BIG ones--had died before, but Elvis's death was just...different. It felt weird. It kept feeling weird. And, for some, it felt SO weird that they didn't accept it. And during the 47 years since his passing, theories about him still being alive have frequently resurfaced.\n\nInside Edition even devoted a segment to a belief that a bearded man at Graceland on Elvis's 82nd birthday was Elvis himself:\n\nFast forward to 2024, and we have an 89-year-old Kentucky man named John Burroughs whom Pulaski County residents or anyone who's seen him really believe is Elvis Presley. The fact he's the same AGE as Presley would be only fuels the theory.\n\nBurroughs is a quiet man, rarely venturing into town, but he HAS been asked about his uncanny resemblance to the rock icon, and he just laughs it off.\n\nNow...check out the source of this story:\n\nThe Somerset Insider is an accomplished satire site on Facebook. With the Elvis lookalike story, I believe they have accomplished a mission. In the comment sections of both, you'll see references to artificial intelligence. And when I saw the \"John Burroughs\" image, that's what I thought, too.\n\nThis image reminds me of all those \"here's what they would look like if they were still alive\" images that pop up in my feed all the time.\n\nBut, wait a minute, this isn't Elvis. It's John Burroughs, right? ðŸ˜‰"
