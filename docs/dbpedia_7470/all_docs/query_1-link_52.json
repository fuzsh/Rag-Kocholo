        "text": "Bernadette Nwokeji is a senior enrolled in Riverview High School's International Baccalaureate Program in Sarasota, Florida. Bernadette has maintained a natural inclination towards public health and politics since her youth, and engages in activities that highlight the intersection of the two — including, but not limited to, serving in leadership roles with Youth Council of Sarasota, the Boys and Girls Clubs of Sarasota and DeSoto Counties, WSLR-LP 96.5, the League of Women Voters, Teen Court, Riverview High Student Government, Speech and Debate, and Mock Trial. With her ultimate goal being to establish racial equity within her community and beyond, Bernadette drafted legislation that tackles the invasive and visible remnant of racial segregation: food deserts. After meeting with and receiving the Florida Department of Agriculture Consumer Services' blessing, Bernadette petitioned all throughout summer 2021 and received bipartisan sponsorship from Senator Shevrin Jones and Representative Amber Mariano for her bill, now titled the Healthy Food Financing Initiative (HFFI). HFFI entered the 2022 Florida legislative session as two identical bills in the Florida House (HB 1311) and Senate (SB 1450), and aims to provide nonprofit organizations and community development financial institutions with ready access to education, funding and other information beneficial for dismantling these geographic fate-sealers. Moreover, through grassroot efforts, Bernadette created SHARE Wholeness, her nonprofit organization that alleviates food hunger and insecurity at the local level. Since Bernadette credits her success to education, as she believes it is the cornerstone of advocacy, the vessel from which change is forged, Bernadette is spearheading a girls’ mentoring program, where she aims to instill them with the confidence that equipped her with the ambition to pursue her passions. In the fall, Bernadette plans to attend college and will be continuing her education on racial disparities and methods to resolve them through studying health policy and engineering."
