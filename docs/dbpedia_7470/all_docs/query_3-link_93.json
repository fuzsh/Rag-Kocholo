My mother, Anne Van\n\nArsdall Poore, took the photos for the Los Alamos Monitor, I think. I wasn’t really that into the\n\nDead, but went along just for fun, with my Mom and Uncle and brother. Anyhow, enjoy the shots!\n\nREVIEW: 101782\n\nOne of the best of ’82 imo. Thank you.\n\nREVIEW: Missed the first time around…not the next infinity!\n\nAt 16 years old in Albuquerque, my friends were more turned on to the Grateful Dead than I was,\n\nsince, as a teenager, I liked punk rock. I spat a haughty “pshaw” at the mention of a trip to Santa\n\nFe to catch the “immortal Dead” so I missed what was in store….until I turned on to the GD in\n\ncollege and, lo and behold, the Downs at Santa Fe was my first ever bootleg tape. I’ve\n\ninternalized all of it since, except, of course, those juicy d/s bits that the tape, bless its heart, was\n\ntoo small to contain. Would that my mind had been ready so that I could have been there!\n\nREVIEW: agree\n\none of my first boot tapes. always loved this one.very hot for a early 80’s.way underated, even in\n\nthe old tape trading days nobody ever had this on thier tapelists. i always wondered why this\n\nshow was not more popular! GREAT 1st set with (LOCAL COLOR TUNES)coming after\n\ncandyman. 2nd even better. by the way jerry fans, the man sounds great after the first verse of 1/2\n\nstep (minor sound adjustment)& i actually think there is smoke bioling off his guitar for most of\n\nthe show. the band really shines on this one! one of those gems i find myself digging out of my\n\ncollection quite often. well recorded aud.\n\nREVIEW: Must check in on this one\n\nThis show is significant in that the boys were never the same after this show. Garcia was “nobody\n\nhome” at the year end Oakland shows having finally fallen prey to the Persian. The band\n\nover-compensated for his lack of focus for the next two years. At this show, Jerry’s voice was\n\nstrong and the band was clearly pumped to play in Sante Fe. Significant show in Dead history.\n\nREVIEW: excellent recording\n\nAlthough it exhibits a few tech glitches, this is just an excellent recording of a really fun show.\n\nThis recording has the same outdoor vibe that Manor Downs (7/31/82) has; mellow but fantastic\n\nenergy throughout the performance; something about racetracks I guess. The show has some real\n\ngems; listen to minute 3:00 – 4:00 during the space segment, into Throwing Stones. It is\n\nabsolutely sublime Jerry, with Bob or Brent throwing in a little slide note over and over; very\n\ncool; Then into GDTRFB-Wheel_Other One-Wharf Rat-Good Lovin; whew, I’m exhasuted\n\nlistening to this. Phil just ROARS into The Other One, igniting the rest of the guys into a frenzy,\n\nan excellent version. Real nice sound too. A must have by all means.\n\nREVIEW: one of the best!\n\n26 years ago, right about this time of the afternoon, we were all basking in the late afternoon\n\nlow-angle sun on the plateau south of town. The Grateful Dead were playing one incredibly fine\n\nshow. We were all happy, smiles everywhere. One of the best shows of 1982, and one of the best\n\nshows of the early 80s.Listening to it today I couldn’t be happier that I made the sacrifices I did\n\nback them to be on the road seeing GD shows. Cause every now and then one like this happened\n\nand it kept you going forward in your life, inspired by positive energy and pure joy.\n\nREVIEW: awesome..\n\nkiller show, excellent recording…..\n\nREVIEW: First Show\n\nThis show has wonderful energy and is full of Jerry magic. Mississippi-Franks!!!!!!!!!!!!! I was fifteen…\n\nREVIEW: WE STOPPED OVER IN SANTA FE\n\nWhat a great show, and the sound is great as well.. This was the day that The Who, and Jethro\n\nTull were playing at Folsom Field at CU in Boulder (my hometown at the time), and half of\n\nBoulder showed up in Santa Fe instead!!! The first set was just epic and the second set was even\n\nbetter. 11 songs in the second set, 6 after the drums!!! Brent added a special Santa Fe verse to\n\nNever Trust a Woman. This was the 10TH Throwing stones in a row, they would eventually\n\nreach 12 consecutive shows. After drums is awesome, it was equal to 2 seperate shows of after\n\ndrums, Throwing, wheel, GDTRFB, Other one, wharf Rat, Good Love. Just a great Fall day in\n\nSanta Fe.\n\nREVIEW: One for the books\n\nI think this show was a “you had to be there show” like so many other classics but the rainbow,\n\nthe rain, Phil’s sombreero hat, the roses at the opener, the campground,front and jerry doesn’t get\n\nany better. Oh I forgot the setlist which keep just kept going and going. It was powerful I think\n\nthe China Doll really came through best of all. Music opener with all the roses or tulips being\n\nthrown on stage into they love each other to start getting things into gear. THen the China/rider\n\nset closer I think that was after it rained? Then the coup de gras Saturday Night Cold Rain\n\nencore. You had to be there!!!!\n\nREVIEW: Grateful Dead 1982\n\nThe concert was a little fuzzy as my sister was married the night before the show and I think I\n\nwas still up from that. This recording sure brings back memories and the pictures! I think I can\n\nspot me and my friends in one photo. Great show, high times.
