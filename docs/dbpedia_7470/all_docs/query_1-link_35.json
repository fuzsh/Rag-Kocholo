        "text": "I can't believe my service here is more than half over. I love this job. I wish I could spend another year working here. There are some projects here I've started, that I know will take longer than my term of service to finish. Right now, I'm working on an NEA grant, and we won't even see that money, if we win, until next January.\n\nI've also been here long enough to watch the organization grow and develop. I've also spent some time thinking about what would need to be done in order to help build a stronger base such as strategic planning, developing future staff positions (ie write out job descriptions, think about necessary income to support more full time administrative staff, and so many more ideas.)\n\nI also really like the environment. We try to work collectively here to create a program we can all support. This means I usually end up doing stuff outside of my job description, but we all do it together, so I don't mind. Right before Christmas, we had a baby grand piano donated. My job, with the ED and one of my housemates was to become \"piano movers.\" We moved it out of a tiny house and into our performance space. When I got back from the holiday break, I photographed it for our seasonal mailing.\n\nI'm working on one proposal now, to create a winterized community room upstairs that can function as a classroom space. I'm also working on a few other proposals and adding the old membership database slowly to the new one. Our youth media program is growing and getting a space where they can meet regularly would really help the program and organization's capacity.\n\nWe haven't had much luck getting grants this year otherwise. I know it is a tough year all around to find funding. I get a little frustrated every time we get a rejection letter, but I know it has a lot to do with the economy and not us necessarily. We keep getting emails that say the foundation is going through a \"re-organizing process\" and they aren't able to let us apply right now.\n\nI'm going to keep plugging away though. We did make a t-shirt order and I'm going to work on a planned giving campaign. I also drafted an annual report and we used the text in our next season's brochure. There are other ways to raise money and now seems like a good time for out of the box thinking.\n\nOur next season looks like it is going to be amazing. The Yes Men! are coming to to a presentation on culture jamming and there work. The filmmaker Patricio Guzman is coming to show his new film \"Nostalgia for the Light,\" David Zirin is coming, and so many other cool folks.\n\nHope you all are well!\n\nI've almost completed my first goal in developing a system to manage incoming/outgoing technology. I've done some research with how other media centers, libraries, universities, and public access stations do this, and found a useful and free system. Now I'm learning how to become a savvy website administrator!\n\nThe system I found is a module within Drupal. It's called MERCI, or Manage Equipment Reservations, Checkout and Inventory. This was developed by the genius minds at OpenMediaProject.org who's core mission is to bring people more control of their public access channels. In fact, many of you may be using Open Media's tools. (BAVC, Brookline, Access Humboldt?).\n\nWhat I need to make sure of is that I will not leave a burden of a system that no one understands how to change, update, or improve. To set up anything besides the basic functions will require an IT position to be staffed at the organization. Expect a screencast or other documentation to help beginner developers get this up and running as a simple, in-house resource for tracking inventory. Any help or collaboration with this is encouraged!\n\nNow that we have visiting instructors that are from outside our organization, the need for educational curriculum on a web-based structure is growing. Google Apps have been a great way to ween off our internal server. Google Docs is used to host reports, curriculum and handouts, and share PDFs onto our blog, macsddiy.posterous.com . Our best program feedback is collected using Google Forms. An email is sent after every workshop that asks to identify what we need to to improve workshop and what the community wants to see more of. I also began a workshop proposal form available on the blog so outside instructors can submit their ideas to us.\n\nThis week has been by far, the most intense because we host the San Diego Latino Film Festival March 10-20. I realize that the media lab is a reality thanks to the festival, but right now it's a major thorn in my side. I'm constantly resolving annoying IT issues\n\ndue to outdated equipment and our overuse of printers and bandwidth. I cannot wait to rebuild some infrastructure when this festival is all done with and get back to why I'm here!\n\nI'll leave on this note: Mozilla Drumbeat. Amazing. DrumbeatSD was an event organized by NewMediaRights.org and Mozilla a few blocks from here. \"Some of the spaces included open data visualization and discussion, open source music and video experimentation, and using technology to enhance our community's connection with local farms and farmer's markets.\"\n\nLong time no field report. In the past few months, there has been a lot of progress and change. Tiffany is our new and awesome VISTA, and with her added support, DIY Media (a program to train youth in documentary filmmaking, social media, etc) has launched. I've been working with her and staff to develop the curriculum for this project.\n\nWe're also moving along with DIY Productions. As we build our base of creative and motivated teens through the DIY Media program, we hope to draw from this pool and build a social enterprise where teens make media for non-profits. I made a promo that will become one in our portfolio of films to show potential clients. You can view it here:http://www.youtube.com/user/digitalhistories#p/u/5/sp0t6U0PUJU\n\nI've also been working on a website for DIYP. There was a little hiccup where we had disagreement on colors/design (of course, after building out the whole site...yarrgh) but I think it's now settled and we're running with the attached mockup.\n\nMoving forward, I surveyed residents at one of our low income housing buildings and it seems that most are very pro-internet and don't want us to cut it off... so these results could support an effort to raise capital for wired internet at our buildings... I'm not sure it's feasible to do this in the remaining months, but we'll see. It will be difficult to get organizational support for what could be a lengthy and expensive project. But given that most of the residents surveyed cannot afford internet service and yet use and need it...well... I think it'd be worth it!\n\nSince the L@TCH program is now in full swing, it's been a while since my last update here. I've been directing my blogging energies (which I don't have much of due to other tasks) to the L@TCH blog: http://blog.everyfamilyconnected.org/\n\nHere you can go back in time and read all the ups and downs I've experienced with the L@TCH program so far.\n\nAll the pieces seem to be in place to distribute home computers to Baltimore City public school families, except the families... We've only distributed about 20% of our targeted goal (500 computers) and we are almost at the deadline we had previously set to have all computers distributed. The problem seems to be that parents are not receiving information about the program from the schools. We've come up with a couple of strategies to help our school partners reach more families:\n\n1. Phone calls home to parents: We hope that by directly contacting parents we can provide them with the information they need to sign up.\n\n2. In class demonstrations for the students: Our initial idea was to give the students flyers to take home to their parents. The paradox here being, one of the reasons the L@TCH program was created was because we know students often forget to take notes home to parents. Now we are going to get our volunteers to go into the schools and demonstrate some of the educational games that come loaded on the L@TCH computers. Hopefully students will be so pumped about the prospect of getting a home computer with sweet games they will give their parents the flyer and tell them to sign up.\n\nBeing the coordinator of this project requires that I keep a lot of people and tasks straight and here is where my weakness lies. Currently, I am working on breaking down all the information in my notes and reviewing everything from the beginning in order to compile it into one document. I'm hoping as I do this it will keep me more organized as I continue the year.\n\nAlthough we have not had as many workshops as we had hoped at this time, the planning and execution of the workshops we have had is going very well. My favorite part of the job is to see the students and the parents engaged and having a great time at our workshops!\n\nMarketing\n\nJanuary 2011 is the first month of my redesign of our workshop brochure. The original lacked our image of who we are- a MEDIA ARTS center. It looked more like a school lunch calendar, or a hospital manual. I added images, descriptions, and tried to make it easy to look at. Please!! Any input is appreciate on what works and what doesn't with this design.\n\nThis is my first attempt with Adobe InDesign. It's a great program for designing print material, and has plenty of add-on scripts users can share with one another. I would like to have a template designed so that you can just drop in new images, and paste new descriptions for each workshop without knowing anything about graphic design. The time and skills needed for the task will be cut tremendously.\n\nMeetup.com helps incredibly with organizing events.\n\nMost of our ShareSD jammers have found us through meetup.com\n\nVolunteer Recruitment\n\nOur members and visitors are growing. We've had visits from high school and university classes, independent artists, and local residents attending events and workshops. Thankfully, we are receiving more interns, donations, and volunteer instructors to help with all the new attention.\n\nOne goal is to have a migration of our curriculum onto a web-based system. Our server is slow, old, and has duplicates of everything running around all over the place. Google docs is my current stomping grounds for keeping new curriculum and managing new and potential volunteers to teach workshops.\n\nI just created a Google Form so potential instructors can submit their workshop proposals to us. It clearly defines their goals and outcomes, while creating a contact database of those interested in volunteering. The form is a spreadsheet in disguise, so this information can be visualized, redirected, and published in several ways. Here is a copy of the form I've created: Proposal Form And here is how I want the information presented and archived (on its own): Doc View.\n\nTracking our Technology\n\nAs we approach closer to our annual 10 day film festival, the need for a reliable and organized system to track our equipment grows. We have seven screenings that happen simultaneously, and it all happens outside our walls. I discovered a Drupal program called MERCI(Manage Equipment Reservations, Checkout and Inventory), it can extend any content type into a list of unique reservable items (like studios) or buckets of interchangeable items (like DV cameras).\" Developed by Chad Phillips for Open Media Project. (Thanks to Gavin for directing me to MERCI contacts!) This has everything I've been looking for, BUT...\n\n1. Do I have the time to learn Drupal and fix any bugs before I leave?\n\n2. Will anyone have the ability to maintain/update MERCI once I leave?\n\nBefore I step into uncharted territory, I'm going to see if I can Excel my way through this assignment. I recently took advantage of my IST and had a six-hour excel training, which gave me a few tricks to try out.\n\nCMS\n\nWe have Kintera. And I do not like it. I had to call tech support. Their solution to my problem was that I had to be on Internet Explorer, clear my cookies, and restart IE in order for my duplicate contacts to update. Not exactly good workflow, especially when you are working in a Mac lab. I'd like to hear your thoughts on Kintera. Email me if you have any!\n\nA growing community: http://macsddiy.posterous.com\n\nLast month's Videographer's Lounge,a free gathering, was hosted by video artist Ilan Katin. This is a video mapping demo. Photo by Miguel Vega: portfolio.accent.tv/\n\nThings got a little busier over November and December. Expectedly I had an increase in phone calls/e-mails during the \"Storming Phase\" but nothing too out of control. I've been lucky that major issues with different VISTAs have not overlapped so I haven't had to juggle too many concerns at the same time. I've also gotten into a basic routine of e-mailing people about a month after I've last heard from them and that seems to be working alright. Everyone definitely has a different way they like to communicate and I construct my e-mails according to whatever standard thats evolved naturally with that person. I'd like to read more field reports but there has been a lot of artifacts and tangibles sent over so I think we are doing alright.\n\nHowie and I finished this huge database of all 400 and some odd Digital Arts Service core members over the past 10 years and I'm now working on how to best display the database on the transmission project's website. I've been toying around with different custom google map icons but haven't yet settled on anything.\n\nIn November I attended Edward Tufte's class on information design and it had a very big effect on me and how I design things. I'd highly recommend going to one of his classes if you can get someone else to pay for it.\n\nProjects Completed: Some info-graphics and normal-graphics, database of past DASC members and host sites, some google map icons, transmission project website redesign but not implementation, secret DASC swag design, increased Drupal knowledge, some conflict management action and some dealing with sticky situations action.\n\nProjects in the works: Implement Transmission project redesign, more swag, increase Drupal knowledge further, do all that I can to help people when they ask.\n\nResolution of the Year: No TV (sit-coms/dramas mainly)\n\nField report time!\n\nI have been putting this report off in hopes to have some great media and artifacts to present, but this will have to wait until my next report. I found some time to give a quick status update of what I've been up to. We really need more activity on here!\n\nI have been working on two major goals right now: developing programming for our evening workshops and establishing a system to track our technology that both stays in-house and are rented out to the community.\n\nFor our evening workshops at Media Arts Center, we've slowly been reaching our goal of having our calendar ready 3 months in advance.\n\nWe have just reached having it all set one month- the workshop type, instructor, goals, marketing, scheduling, etc are currently ready one month in advance. We have had great turnouts for Final Cut workshops and build-it-with-others workshops like the DIY Steadycam. New volunteers are increasing, thanks to new volunteer recruiting/policies we have established. The next step for our workshops is to redesign our brochures/marketing. We need to be more appealing to younger audiences, cut costs, and create new job descriptions for volunteers/interns. This begins mid-december.\n\nAs for tracking technology, I had to start from the very beginning. The current inventory spreadsheet was missing crucial information including serial numbers and price values. I was able to finally utilize the snazzy barcode scanner I purchased to make the task a lot easier. The information is almost 100% entered in and will benefit accounting, identifying outdated technology, and our equipment rental process. Audits? Easy. Grantwriting? Simple! Equipment rental? Sure, let's see what's available! By the end of January, I hope to have finalized a working rental system that incorporates barcodes into our equipment inventory and member databases. I'm hoping by the end of my year here, we can have a reservation system available on our website, and maybe even a mobile app.\n\nOn Tuesdays, FabLab offers design workshops of all sorts. They have vinyl cutter, laser engraving, 3D scanners...man!!! I joined their fun last tuesday @ Intro to Interactivity. We made IR pens to make DIY smartboards. It really works!!\n\nMore to come,\n\nChris\n\nL@TCH got a grant from the Abell Foundation and we think we've found someone who is interested in helping us evaluate the program, this means we can really put L@TCH into motion. My supervisor, Gayle describes it like someone has suddenly opening the gates and we are off running!\n\nI've written some web content, our website is now finished: everyfamilyconnected.org\n\nMy supervisor and I have been busy meeting with the school coordinators/principles to discuss how many students will be needing computers. Our goal is to distribute 75 per school. We may start looking for another school because we want to distribute 500 computers overall. We've also drafted a plan concerning how we will implement the program. I've made a checklist to help the schools we are working with stay organized, now if only could stay more organized myself!\n\nOrganizing the information I need to know about each school is becoming difficult but I'm definitely getting better at it and finding different ways to keep it all straight. My supervisor just asked one of her web developers to make us a database which will be very useful in this regard. Also, we now have a L@TCH blog and our updates (once we write them) will eventually show up on the website. One thing I have learned for certain, it takes time to get to know the organization you're working for, for them to get to know you and to figure out the ways you work well together.\n\nWe want to keep the teachers informed throughout the program so we can get their help and input but tracking down the school coordinators in order to schedule teacher meetings is no easy task. All the coordinators are wonderful people but also very busy people... We are in the process of drafting a survey for the teachers so that we can gauge how many home technology lessons they assign and how comfortable the students are with computers before and after the program. One of the teachers we met with said only three parents have emailed her all school year. I hope by May we can change that so it's every parent.\n\nSo far, everyone we've met with seems really excited about L@TCH starting at their school, now we've got a lot of work to do!\n\nQueridos compañeros de DASCorps, (any takers on translating my greeting?)\n\nI apologize for disappearing for a while, but things have been pretty busy with Latinitas. I have, however, been behind the scenes keeping up with the field reports and I’m really glad to find out that everyone seems to be doing fairly well in their new environments. I’ve noticed that most of you have been provided with these great work spaces and as you can see in the pictures I’ve posted above, our WHOLE OFFICE would probably fit inside one of your great work spaces! Lol! But I really don’t mind it because even though we have limited personal space we have so much room to build camaraderie with the interns and volunteers, plus it’s a lot easier to check on their progress since their computer screen in literally less than a foot away from mine!\n\nMoving on from the subject of our cute little office, the school year has commenced and that means that our after-school clubs and fall internships have begun as well. We had our Fall Club Leader Training on August 20th and I must say that preparing for it was much more challenging than actually leading it. I am really glad my supervisor and some of our summer interns were still there to help. The training consisted of five club leaders (3 of them are in charge of one after–school club and 2 of them are in charge of two clubs, all around different areas of town) and we went over an 80 page packet explaining numerous things such as, the mechanics of the club, how to be a good mentor, club leader duties, different methods on how to motivate their girls to express themselves, etc. I will conduct bi-weekly meetings with these club leaders to check the progress of their clubs and to assign them media related activities/lessons to do at their clubs throughout the semester.\n\nAs for our fall interns, we only have two, a Public Relations and Marketing Intern and I am working on bringing in at least two more. Except that I feel a little apprehensive about bringing in more interns because my supervisor is the one who usually assigns them their projects and she is out on maternity leave right now, given that she just delivered a cute baby boy on Friday. That is the reason why I have been so swamped this month, because since our staff consists of only her and I, we have been trying to go through most of the essential tasks and information as fast as possible before she’s out for month and half. So as of this past Friday (Sept. 3rd), I have been the person everyone turns to... and I must say that kind of pressure is pretty intimidating! Although, I have to add how impressed I am at my supervisor’s incredible ability to accomplish so much up until the last day of her pregnancy, I mean she really did not leave anything pending and she even made a list called “While I’m Out” which consists of useful phone numbers, tasks, events that are scheduled for the following 2 months, intern and volunteer projects, etc. She has truly done a tremendous job at preparing for her temporary departure. Let’s just hope I can keep it that way!! Wish me luck everyone...stay tuned for this month’s field report maybe I’ll be able to talk about all the wonderfulness I accomplished on my own!\n\nPS. I also forgot to mention that on August 31st Latinitas was interviewed live on an NPR affiliate Spanish station called Radio Bilingue, and guess who they interviewed...Me! The interview questions dealt with the basics like who we were, why we were important, when we started…etc. They also interviewed one of our teen writers and she did an amazing job at expressing all of the great things she has learned and accomplished since she has been with Latinitas.\n\nHere is brief description of Radio Bilingue:\n\nRadio Bilingue is the first Spanish-language radio network to broadcast news over the public radio satellite system in the United States. Our national program Linea Abierta reaches hundreds of thousands of listeners nationwide and is the only Spanish-language news show aired on the national public radio network. The program is aired in Chicago, Los Angeles, San Diego, Tucson, and dozens of other cities, as well as numerous rural areas across the country. Furthermore, Radio Bilingue has a decades-long tradition of providing in-depth coverage to special events involving Latino civic participation.\n\nOk then friends, ta-ta for now :)\n\nLove, peace and elbow grease!\n\nI took a quick poll of my co-workers this morning, asking what I should post a picture of that would make you all want to come work with me at the Advancement Project. The resulting photograph incorporated most of their feedback:\n\nExercise balls (I wasn’t kidding about office yoga).\n\nPuppies (Beretta has been dubbed the “office dog”).\n\nJuice squeeze (All you can drink, baby).\n\nAdd that all up (plus a gorgeous Rock Band session in the conference room last Wednesday… not pictured unfortunately) and I would say everything at the Advancement Project (or “Poject” as our entryway said until recently when someone tacked the ‘r’ back on) is moving along just fine.\n\nMy supervisor got back from vacation mid-last week, so we were finally able to go over my VAD and hash out a game plan. She let me choose the areas I wanted to focus on and I made a handy little time line to get the ball rolling. (Now I can stare at my computer screen with purpose). I’ll upload a pdf for anyone who might need to make a timeline for their project; I’ve fallen in love with the format’s utility.\n\nIn other news, I was able to attend a workshop that Healthy City (my branch of the Advancement Project) put on at The California Endowment this past week, and it was a great opportunity to see people using the sight and observe what aspects give them trouble. Now I have a better sense of what areas of the website I should start with for usability testing, etc.\n\nWell, that's pretty much it for now. I'm looking forward to hearing about what projects everyone else has been working on.\n\nPeace y'all.\n\nAttachmentSize UCDTimeline_Aug23.pdf80.28 KB\n\nI have something to show for my time with the Transmission Project so far. Today I published an article on past Corps members' experiences working with Salesforce databases. I would like to thank Billy especially for creating the graphics and prepping the document for PDF format.\n\nThe article is available to download as a pdf below, and you can read my introduction on the current page of the Transmission Project website.\n\nThe article's intended audience is really other organizations, but I encourage anyone who is working with Salesforce -- or any CRM -- to take a look at what we've learned. Anyone interested in how the Transmission Project approaches its past partnerships may also find something useful.\n\nI found that, in conducting my research, having access to other VISTAs' field reports is extremely helpful when trying to get a sense of your perspectives on the projects you are tackling. I was able to search through field reports to learn not only when Corps members encountered problems with Salesforce and what they had to say about it, but also when they felt they had been successful.\n\nWhat I'm trying to say is don't stop reporting because what you say here can actually provide an important resource for me (and others, but do you really require any reason to post other than that it will make my job easier?).\n\nOver and out,\n\nHowie\n\nAttachmentSize Transmission Project - The VISTA and the Database.pdf347.69 KB\n\nNew Start…\n\n…in many ways\n\nMy first day on the job I was assigned a little office (and a MacBook Pro to work on!). It’s very officey seeming, not so much hip. Two desks, four really fantastic seeming office chairs, 2 giant CISCO phones, two little trash bins, and two tiny windows. I put together a detailed calendar of my VAD goals and tacked it to the wall. I’m not so good at decorating.\n\nI went over my VAD with my boss. Like we’d all been told at PSO, my boss stressed how important it was to take several weeks to get accustomed to how things run around here. We talked about a permanent work schedule for me and discussed a couple of things I could do to explore the building, the organization, and the town. Each member of the small staff is extremely supportive and I’m confident that it will be easy to get comfortable in my new job.\n\nBy Wednesday I was feeling productive, getting to know people and compiling a mini database with info on local organizations, when I began to feel quite ill. I had to leave work early and on Thursday I went to the doctor. Turns out I had some weird but super intense viral thing that unfortunately kept me out of work the entire rest of the week. I almost emailed Billy and Ben because I was worried it was going to turn into a crisis if I was still not back on my feet by today. Anyhow, virus gone. I’m back to work today (Monday 8/9/10)! And, as part of “shadowing” individual employees, I helped film a show this morning! How exhilarating! My first time behind the camera!!\n\nWelp, hope you’re all well. I’ll report more next time I do something cool.\n\nWhat an amazing welcome to Albuquerque, NM and the Media Literacy Project.\n\nThe Media Literacy Project is a pretty comprehensive media justice organization that serves Albuquerque, NM and its region. It's a pretty exciting time for me to come in because MLP is looking to restructure itself and really define itself as a media justice organization. They're looking at how they want their internal structure to look, what kinds of campaigns they want to lead and how, who their base is, etc. They're also looking to \"brand\" themselves and \"market\" themselves as real experts on media policy and how it affects the local community. This is especially exciting for me because I get to do all the nerdy things I like to do: research, think and envision new framing. Yes!\n\nThis kind of language would normally turn me off, but the Executive Director and the staff are really aware of STRATEGY. The same questions they're really dishing out and I\"m always thinking about are: how we can really sustain an organization given limited resources? how can we be an effective and legitimate influence over media policy without compromising our political intentions or the communities we represent? how can we learn to frame an issue in a creative way that doesn't recreate stereotypes and distorted representations of our community's realities?\n\nOn the same note, I'm really looking forward to getting involved in groups outside of MLP and the non-profit world. I don't want MLP to be the only work I do by the end of the year. I need some balance and I think getting involved in something outside of work would be just what I need.\n\nAside from thinking over these questions and getting settled into my new job, I got to attend and help out with a community event MLP hosted this week. The event could have been a little better, but like I mentioned MLP is learning to do things differently which is going to be a bit of a bumpy ride. Aside from some of the logistical challenges of the event, I got to meet a few amazing people and see how much political work is going on here in Albuquerque. I got invited to a celebration at the Zia Pueblo's reservation and to someone's home. It was such an honor! And I met a woman from Young Women United, a woman of color led organizing project. The woman I met was so sweet and kind. Everyone has been so warm and welcoming.\n\nEven though my living/housing situation is a bit of stress, things feel really right. I'm excited to see how the rest of the year pans out.\n\nMy first week at Common Frequency began with a small informal gathering at DAM House, marking my arrival & birthday, as well as the replacement of a dude who lived in the house with one of Common Frequency's board members. For now I'm working out of a punk rock & experimental noise venue that has been inhabited by Common Frequency's program director on-and-off for 10 years. See Todd in the photo.\n\nI have made numerous calls and typed out tons of emails, setting up visits to community groups who are working toward getting their radio stations on the air. Common Frequency helps groups compete with out-of-town religious broadcasters for community access, specifically by filing petitions to deny when the FCC makes technical mistakes on applications. I'm not writing filings, but I am helping to track down applicants whose projects have been on hold for years and they are so excited to find out I'm here to support them!\n\nOn my first day, I had a good meeting with the steering committee at KDRT-LP, which will be my home radio station until some of our projects get closer to launching. Next week I'm participating in a conference call organized by Prometheus, meeting with an operations training person at KDRT, deciding what kind of smart phone to buy, and starting a (dreaded) spreadsheet to keep track of everyone I've contacted so far. I also have community visits to Santa Cruz and Stockton planned now.\n\nMeanwhile, this weekend we'll be looking at my job description, trying to update it to make it as realistic as possible. Funding levels really make a difference in terms of how much the org can get done. So I think getting the timelines to be more realistic on a few points will be key to success. I want the service I do to fit into what is acceptable to Transmission Project, and most important of all is the community groups I'm serving. I really want to deliver, you know?\n\nHello!\n\nMy first week at CAMP has flown by! I am living in Santa Cruz and commuting over to Gilroy (which, yes, occasionally smells like garlic or onions)with Kathy, the Executive Director. My first day at the office was pretty standard, except for one large snafu. I was walking through the Master Control room and there was a dying ivy sitting in a pot next to the sink. One thing I learned at our DASCorps orientation was to be proactive, so I took it upon myself to water it. While I was giving it a good soaking, one of the women I work worth came into the room and yelled, \"You shouldn't be doing that!!\". It turns out another woman I work with is a master gardener and the ivy was going through a \"dry cycle\" that I was quickly putting an end to. Oops.\n\nJohn Haffner, my DASCorps predecessor at CMAP, has been around the office my first week to help orient me to my new job, the organization, and the communities I will be working with (not directly, don't worry). He also gives me the skinny on office politics, tried to show the the feral chickens running around San Juan Batista (one of the communities we work with), and takes me out to lunch. I feel very fortunate that I am coming into a project that is in its second phase. I am able to hit the ground running with clear action items, milestones, and goals. My main task this week was to draft an introductory email to send to the EDs at the seven collaborating organizations as well as create a survey for them to take in order for me to get to know them and better understand their goals for this project. I sent both documents out today and have a great feeling of accomplishment. I also set up my voicemail account, so if any of you want to call and leave me a message, the number is 408-846-4983 x 8.\n\nOther than that, not much to report. I'm thinking about redecorating this office. I'm thinking posters with kittens. You know the one where the kitten is hanging from the branch and it kind of looks like it's doing pull ups with the caption \"Hang in there\"? That would be perfect.\n\nThe photos I have included are: 1. The CMAP logo 2. John passing the \"torch\" (aka garlic stress relief ball\") to me 3. A piece of spontaneous art on top of a garbage can overlooking the ocean\n\nOver and out.\n\nWow, what a week. Fresh from the PSO I started my first day at KBCS Radio on Monday. The public transportation is still something I have to conquer, how confusing. I ended up in downtown Bellevue because a bus driver told me to take the wrong bus! The News Director Joaquin was nice enough to come pick me up and drive me to the station. He gave me a tour of Bellevue and the first thing he told me is something about the history here: the land used to be owned by Japanese farmers before the internment during WW2 when a lot of them lost their land and houses. Then someone bought up all the land from under them and started making Bellevue the land of corporate headquarters (Microsoft, Starbucks, Amazon). So this place was built on the backs of Japanese farmers. Pretty intense stuff.\n\nAnyway, I've been working all week on researching a new CMS system for KBCS and finding partner/affiliate orgs to help raise the profile here and become part of the regional news network we are trying to make (my project). This work fits in nicely with the asset mapping project which is great. I am familiarizing myself with the station (it's in a house!) and all the nice people here. Joaquin also showed me the board they use in case I ever want to host/live produce. Holy moly I am intimidated. I can produce radio in a studio pre-recorded no problem, but live...a whole different story. I'm going to wait until I make some headway with my project before venturing into these new waters!\n\nOn a personal note, I cannot wait to explore some of the amazing beautiful natural places here. I live right smack dab next to a park! I'll check in again soon. As Tigre says, TTFN."
