        "text": "A clear governance structure is the key to running a successful radio station. That way everyone will know who gets to make decisions and how, who to call when your transmitter breaks, who will keep track of those thousands of donations that are pouiring in, and how to involve new volunteers in. Some stations have a paid general manager who coordinates the most important issues at the station and other stations have decentralized committees where all people share decision making responsibiilites. You will have to figure out what is the best structure for the people involved with your station.\n\nEducational materials\n\nOrganizing Your Station: Building a Station Structure: Creating a community-based low power radio station takes more than engineering expertise.
