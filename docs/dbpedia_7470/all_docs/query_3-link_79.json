        "text": "This definitive 8-volume Encyclopedia is a comprehensive print and electronic resource covering the history of protest and revolution over the past 500 years – throughout the modern era of mass movements. From the rebellion against the Peasant's Revolt in Bolivia to the Taiping Uprising in China, and from the Enlightenment-inspired revolutions in Europe and America to the anti-colonial revolts of Pancho Villa and the Mau Mau, it covers every major revolution that has altered societies or changed the course of history on a local, regional, national, and international scale. It presents major uprisings and protest movements, and the ideas, ideologies, and activists that propelled them, chronicles the manner in which they unfolded, traces their roots, goals, tactics, and influence, and evaluates their successes and failures.\n\nBoard of Editors\n\nDario Azzellini, Johann Wolfgang Goethe - University of Frankfurt, Germany\n\nMarcelline Block, Princeton University, USA\n\nJesse Cohn, Purdue University North Central, USA\n\nClifford D.

The encyclopedia fills a critical void with its extensive examination of the progression of revolutions and protests throughout the world. The International Encyclopedia of Revolution and Protest is sure to become the definitive reference work in this area of study.\" Pat Newcombe, Western New England College School of Law Library\n\n\"[A] valuable resource for students of social movements and social change.\" Stephen H. Aby, University of Akron\n\nSome reviews:\n\n\"A helpful lexicon provides lists of entries by geography, chronological era, or broad topics such as \"Gender and Sexuality,\" \"Foreign Intervention,\" and \"Guerilla Tactics.\" No comparable work exists in the reference literature.\" (CHOICE, August 2009)\n\n\"A very user-friendly work, and one that can be used effectively at school and college level as well as at more sophisticated research levels … you get a lot for your money, above all if your resources in this cross-disciplinary field are limited and you feel pressure to build them up at one fell swoop … .The arrangement is clear and coverage wide-ranging, making use of the online and print versions equally attractive, each having its distinctive strengths.\" (Reference Reviews, December 2009)\n\n\"Not an area of the world or significant topic has been ignored.
