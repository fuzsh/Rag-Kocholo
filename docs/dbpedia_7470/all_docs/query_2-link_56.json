        "text": "WSLR-LP 96.5 FM’s broadcast community is growing with music and public affairs programming in Sarasota and Manatee Counties. The radio station’s offerings now include four new weekend voices which expand the most eclectic, all-volunteer radio schedule on the suncoast.\n\nAlternating Fridays from 9 pm – 11 pm, Sebastien Wegeng will be starting off the weekend with his fins in the water for his surf/psych meets garage-rock music program, Corduroy. Named after the colloquial surf lingo for a series of swells marching in from the horizon, Wegeng plans to bring a matching series of reverb-soaked wave forms to get listeners ready for a weekend at the beach.\n\nCommunity Conversations with Mel will join WSLR’s lineup of quality public affairs programming on alternating Saturdays from 3 pm – 4 pm. The program will be hosted by poet, spoken word artist, and activist Melanie Lavender, centered around interviews with leaders and influencers in Sarasota and Manatee Counties, while interweaving poetry and music that will make listeners think – as well as move their body.\n\nJay Ackermann bridges the expanse between ska, punk, and indie on his program, The In Between, Saturday nights from 9 pm – 11pm. Focused on building a music community, Jay has deep roots in the global ska and punk scenes – bringing hundreds of bands from all around the globe together to create friendships and awareness that the musical subculture is still alive and evolving.\n\nRounding out WSLR’s weekend is Discovery Road where listeners can hear new music from new artists, new music from some of their favorite artists, and lesser known gems that are not necessarily new. Host, Louise Coogan brings her extensive broadcasting and music industry background to create an entertaining and eclectic mix of unexpected musical treasures to WSLR’s frequency.\n\nWSLR provides a local platform for interested community members to ‘be the media’. No previous radio experience is required. If you are interested in hosting a radio show on WSLR, please visit WSLR to complete a program application. You’ll find the link under the WSLR 96.5 tab on the website.\n\nAbout WSLR+Fogartyville: WSLR + Fogartyville is a center for creative expression and community engagement that amplifies the voices of our diverse community and promotes peace, sustainability, democracy, and economic and social justice. In addition to the 100-watt Low Power Radio Station, WSLR-LP 96.5FM, the organization is also home to Fogartyville Community Media and Arts Center, a 120-seat listening room and event space for arts, cultural, and educational events.\n\nPhotos from WSLR"
