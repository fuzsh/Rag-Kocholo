        "text": "WSLR-LP, Sarasota’s homegrown listener-supported community radio station, will celebrate 17 years on-the-air this year. Over that time hundreds of local residents have had the opportunity to produce their own music and public affairs shows. With the help of a generous grant from the Selby Foundation and supporters that purchased engraved bricks, WSLR+Fogartyville has installed an outdoor pavilion and replaced the broken concrete on the patio with brick pavers and gravel. To celebrate the completion of the patio renovations – which were delayed due to Covid and supply chain issues – WSLR will host an Open House Celebration on Sunday, October 16th from 4-9pm. The event is free and all are welcome!\n\nTours of the radio station will be available throughout the day and attendees can enjoy music by Soul Purpose, The Strangeways and the Duane Freeman Trio. In a Pickle and the Chill Mobile will be on hand to satisfy hungry appetites and the Multicultural Health Institute will have a tent set up for health screenings.\n\nLed by Pat Monahan, Soul Purpose is a roots rock and reggae band playing original, unsigned music. Eclectic by nature and fiercely independent, this band of unschooled ruffians has proven over and over that people are interested in passion and excellence.\n\nWell-known in Sarasota, Saxman Duane Freeman has played with many noted musicians, including Charlie Daniels and Lou Rawls. He’ll be joined by Mean Gene on keys and Art Siegel on drums.\n\nThe Strangeways deliver a groove-laden mix of ska, reggae, dancehall, and rocksteady the way it’s meant to be served: with a full brass section.\n\nWEBSITE\n\nPhotos from WSLR"
