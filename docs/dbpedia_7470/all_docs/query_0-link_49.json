        "text": "Dear Readers: The latest e-newsletter from Sarasota/Bradenton's low-power community radio station WSLR (96.5-LP FM) had a surprising subject heading.\n\nIt read, \"Bible Broadcasting Network has turned off their translator.\"\n\nWSLR's \"ex-officio member of the board\" Arlene Sweeting (whose partner, David Beaton, is chairman), said that BBN's WYFO Bradenton signal (also on the 96.5 frequency) interfered with broadcasts in its already-limited local sphere. She said she spoke to the coordinator of that transmission, beamed from Lakeland's WYFO (91.9 FM), and learned that the Bradenton feed wasn't earning the company money.\n\nIt was suggested that WSLR listeners write complaints to be used as ammunition to break the lease, thus halting the BBN's Bradenton signal. Apparently, many people listened to the appeal. The e-text requested that listeners stop writing to the BBN now.\n\nThe semi-happy ending for 100-watt WSLR resolves only a small portion of its reception woes, because Orlando's 99,000-watt rock station, WHTQ (96.5 FM), also breaks into the signal. WSLR also needs higher ground to house antennas.\n\nYet, the signal is stronger now that BBN is gone. R.B. tunes in from the Gulf Gate area of Sarasota, about 10 miles from station headquarters on the New College of Florida campus.\n\nWSLR's 1-6 a.m. span generally is preprogrammed music, and several syndicated shows transmit during the daytime, but now more than half of the 24-hour, seven-day schedule is live and local.\n\nThere's such nifty, all-volunteer fare as: \"Focus on Sarasota & Bradenton,\" hosted by Murray Herman (2 p.m. Mondays); \"The Grassroots Local News Show\" (6 p.m. Tuesdays); Russ Mahan's \"Senior Moments\" (9 a.m. Wednesdays); \"Surreal News With Steve & Alan\" (9 a.m. Fridays); and \"Greek Themes,\" co-hosted by Dimitris Trovas and Brian Gomien (2 p.m. Saturdays).\n\nFor \"serious\" jazz lovers (who are constantly writing R.B.), two shows showcase the genre: Mike Finly's \"We Need More Jazz,\" on alternating Mondays from 7 to 9 p.m., mixes all styles, from big band, solo piano and classic jazz to avant-garde; and \"Sunday Afternoon Jazz,\" with Bill Spielberg, 1-3 p.m. Sundays, swirls out postwar tunes focused on the '50s- and '60s-era bop.\n\nLive local news airs from 6 to 6:30 p.m. Monday and Friday.\n\nAdditionally, a \"Mr. Rhythm\" contacted R.B. about his new show from 7 to 9 a.m. Saturdays. He says he'll spin rock and R&B oldies from the '50s and '60s, but outside the commercial range.\n\nThe unnamed (at press time) program will, he says, \"feature the long-forgotten that makes you say, 'Oh wow, I haven't heard that in years!'\"\n\nAnother show highlight is called \"First and Foremost,\" where he'll play a song by its originator(s), then its \"hit\" version.\n\nAs well, he'll air \"almost anything\" that's requested. (Call the studio at 894-6469.)\n\nMr. Rhythm also hosts Wednesday's hourlong blues program, \"This and That,\" at noon.\n\nThe detailed schedule for all shows is available online at the WSLR Web page, www.WSLR.org.\n\nIn keeping with the \"community\" part of \"community radio,\" WSLR continues to raise necessary capital from \"we, the people.\"\n\nBoston folksinger/songwriter Jake Armerding headlines the latest benefit at 8 p.m. Friday at Bradenton's Fogartyville Caf√© (741-9755), along with The Wirebeaters bluegrass band.\n\nTickets are $10 in advance, $12 at the door.\n\nAlso, organizers plan a yard sale from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. Dec. 10 at 3706 Royal Palm Ave., Sarasota, off Myrtle Street across from the Winn-Dixie, and is accepting donations of sellable items today through Saturday (call to arrange drop-off).\n\nAll money raised goes into the station.\n\nNot to worry about BBN. The Bible broadcasters still maintain four base stations and six other translators -- including Sarasota's WYFO (97.3 FM) -- elsewhere around Florida.
