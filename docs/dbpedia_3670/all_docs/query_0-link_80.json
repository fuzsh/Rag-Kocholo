        "text": "Editor’s note: Quoted stories are taken from Motor Cycle unless stated otherwise. ‘Nitor’ was a well-respected columnist. Readers will also find references to editor Harry Louis, technical editor Vic Willoughby, Midlands editor Bob Currie , sports editor Mick Woollett and staff writers including John Ebbrell, David Dixon and Stuart Burroughs. As time allows I’ll include essays on them in the A-Z. They were fine journalists who, in their different ways, did a lot for motor cycling and they should not be forgotten. This was the year I took to the road, on a 1959 Villiers 2T-powered Ambasador,. It was also the year I went to my first bike show, the Racing & Sporting Motorcycle Show at the Horticultural Halls in Westminster. There I stood in my brand new Pride & Clarke leatherette flyining jacket complete with 59 Club badge secured by shiny studs, holding my Stadium Project 4 skidlid, among a crowd of older, wiser motor cyclists. We gazed up at a shiny ‘Candy Gold’ Honda CB750 as it revolved slowly, displaying its four-pot ohc lump, electric starter and disc brake. Life would never be the same again.\n\n“JAPAN’S TOP CONTENDER FOR America’s booming big bike market, the new 750cc Honda four, will soon be on sale in the States. And it will cost between £100 and £150 less than the BSA and Triumph three-cylinder 750s, Britain’s main USA export challengers. The five-speed Honda four, fitted with an electric starter, was unveiled by the company’s chief, Soichiro Honda, at a dealer convention held in Las Vegas last week to mark 10 years of marketing in the States and the sale of one million Honda’s in North America.”\n\n“HONDA’S FABULOUS FOUR—THE CB750 roadster—made its British debut in front of television cameras at Beaulieu, Hants. With it, also in England for the first time, was the 1,200cc Munch Mammut, as well as other big-capacity machines lined up for a BBC Wheelbase recording session…The 736cc Honda, with bore and stroke of 61x63mm, and compression ration of 9:1, is claimed to develop 67bhp at 8,500rpm—less power than originally rumoured…tyres are Japanese Bridgestones, 3.25x19in front, 4.00×10 rear. The Beaulieu machine was specially flown in from America…The mighty 1,200cc Mammut has a modified sohc NSU engine which, says Friedl Munch, produces 92hp at 5,800rpm…Other machines at Beaulieu were a 750cc BSA Rocket 3, a 750cc Norton Commando and a 500cc Suzuki Cobra.” A Motor Cycle columnist commented: “The recording session at Beaulieu gave a splendid opportunity to compare different approaches to accommodating a multi-cylinder engine between two wheels. Viewed side on the Honda CB750 must be one of the most beautiful motor cycles ever, taut and well-proportioned as a girl athlete. But step round to the front and the lissom maiden becomes a busty, brassy blonde. In other words, the across-the-frame straight-four engine looks a bit out of proportion…other four-cylinder configurations have their problems, such as overheating of the rear pots in a square or vee formation or a too-long wheelbase, Perhaps a good try would be a shallow-angle vee with the cylinders staggered, so each was directly exposed to the air-stream.” BTW, the ‘CB’ in CB750 stood for City Bike, which is an odd choice for the fastest (124mph) production bike in the world\n\n“SO MUCH SPECULATION HAS PRECEDED the arrival of the Honda CB750 that anticipation could have outstripped realisation,” wrote David Dixon. “It hasn’t. After tests in Germany I would say that, assuming production models match the demonstration job I rode, the bikes will more than live up to what we expect…A tiny electric-starter button by the twistgrip growls the 67 horses into life. A downward dab with the left foot selects bottom gear noiselessly. Experience starts. Any sense of heaviness and bulk which you may have when sitting astride the model is forgotten within the first few yards. The bike is beautifully balanced. The petrol tank is no wider than that of the average 500. Footrest width matches knee width; the reach of the handlebar gives a relaxed position and you feel, immediately, part of the machine…Docile and tractable, the engine purrs happily at 3,000rom in top gear; that is about 45mph. Tweak the grip and the pick-up is unhesitant; it is so deceptively smooth that you are forgiven for thinking it almost sluggish until the speedometer and wind pressure tell the truth. A combination of complete smoothness and effortless torque waft you up to the nineties so rapidly that only the alarming speed at which you rush up to the corners dispels the illusion. The characteristics are quite different from those of super-sports twins of the same capacity. The feeling of violent acceleration of the twins is absent though the rate of acceleration of the four is even swifter. Moreover, the four is still galloping upward after the twins have run out of breath. For instance, at 105mph the Honda is still accelerating ‘with the\n\nrider sitting bolt upright’, where most other big roadsters I have ridden responded above this speed only when I tucked in as much as possible…On a standing start a good 650 twin would probably lead for the initial 100 yards. But then the CB750 would overcome its higher weight (around 60lb) and as the xtra horses got into full gallop, the twin would be overhauled. The terminal speed of 101mph at the end of the quarter-mile is among the highest recorded by Motor Cycle. To achieve this, I found it best to drop the clutch lever around 7,000rpm and spin off. The longest unbroken black mark stretched for about 15ft before the rear tyre bit…With the full 14.2-mile Nurburgring grand-prix circuit at my disposal, I did not spend too much time exploiting the docile half of the bike’s character. The lure of the famous lap beckoned and it was here that the Honda bared its racing background. Screwing the twistgrip until the revs soared to the 8,500 limit in each gear, I enjoyed some of the most exhilarating miles I have ever known. The Nurburgring might have been designed by a demented snake charmer. It has a bewildering assortment of corners and the intervening straights have switchbacks with blind crests, over the final brow of which the road may switch right or left. One of the fastest sections is downhill with flat-out right-left-right-left swoops between pine trees…Acceleration, roadholding and braking were stressed to the limit…Tucking in as best I could in a Barbour suit, foiled to some extent by the high-level handlebar, I let the revs soar into the red at 8,600rpm before notching top. On a slight depression the needle moved swiftly to 8,000rpm—equivalent to 118mph—before dropping back to a steady 7,800rpm (116mph)…lower drag might have given a speed over the 125mph mark. With a sports fairing probably another 10mph…All this was achieved without any trace of mechanical fuss and with the minimum of exhaust noise…For a machine of its bulk the Honda handled well. Occasionally I entered corners faster than I should have done and had to keep the brakes on. Extra effort was then required to lay the model over and this caused some tail-wagging. But normally cornering was extremely steady, with the model leeching to whatever line I chose…The single-disc front brake, though not as potent as other disc types I have tried, was smoother than usual with a twin-leading-shoe drum brake. And the sensitivity of the hydraulic action was reassuring on the dodgy surfaces…the Honda four ranks as one of the most outstanding machines I have ever ridden. The more I rode it, the more it grew on me.”\n\nAN ITALIAN FILM COMPANY wanted Giacomo Agostini to star in a major movie. Ago agreed—provided filming could be scheduled to work round his racing commitments. Mile Hailwood remarked: “I don’t know why he doesn’t take up acting with his looks. He’d make more money and I’d have nothing to worry about!” Soon after, Hailwood retired from motor cycle racing to concentrate on four-wheelers (though he would race on the Island again). In an extensive eulogy Motor Cycle said: “Nine world championships; a dozen TT wins; countless other victories plus lap and race records on practically every major motor-cycling circuit in the world—the statistics alone stamp the hallmark of greatness on Mike Hailwood. But, it was the way in which those statistics were piled up, above all the phenomenally few short seasons it took him that made Mike a living legend: probably the greatest racing motor cyclist of all time.”\n\nYAMAHA STARTED THE YEAR by quitting the road-racing world championship, despite dominating the 125 and 250cc classes in 1968 with in-line fours. However, Phil Read and Phil Ivy were offered 250 and 350cc twins for production racing.\n\nKAWASAKI LAUNCHED A POTENT 500cc two-stroke triple and entered the Daytona 200 with a Brit, Dave Simmonds, in the saddle (he went on to ride a 125cc Kawasaki to first place in the Lighgtweight TT). The first examples to reach Europe were put through their paces on the Zandvoort circuit courtesy of Dutch importer Henk Vink, who used one in the first sprint of the Dutch season. He won the stock machine class (400m standing start) in 13.48sec/104.82mph. Motor Cycle noted: “The exhaust note on full throttle is reported to be like that a a racing four-cylinder Yamaha.” Even in the open class only two bikes were kwika than the Kwaka: a 998cc JAP (12.08sec) and a 650cc Triumph (12.91sec).\n\nA ROADTEST OF THE BSA A65L Lightning recorded a two-way mean top speed of 104mph and a one-way top speed of 112mph “with a strong following wind”. The Lightning was described as “the most potent model for home buyers”, Rocket 3s being export only. “Big bike fans may feel they are deprived by the absence of the Rocket 3 from the British market…but the Lightning in its 1969 guise is a first-rate substitute and, for British roads on which the full performance of the three can rarely be used, could be a better proposition.”\n\nRIDERS HEADING TO THE DRAGON Rally were offered free overnight accommodation by the Double Zero Club in Coventry. Snow was forecast; promised entertainments at the site included a torchlit parade (a la Elefantentreffen), bonfire sing-song and a “beat-group performance”. John Ebbrell, Motor Cycle’s man on the spot, reported: A 59 club party, on the way to the Dragon Rally on Friday, had stopped at Watford Gap after a brisk run up the M1. “We’ve come some 80 miles, one-third of the way, said Father Graham Hullett. “And it looks like being the best third,” retorted Jacquie Blendell as the first flakes of snow came flurrying down the motorway. How right she was. All three days pf the Dragon were reminiscent of Napoleon’s retreat from Moscow. On Friday, slushy sleet became a raging blizzard; main roads were soon blocked with slithering lorries. Many baffled rallyists sought relief at the Double Zero Club, whose young members did sterling work running an all-night buffet. Those who made a start early on Saturday morning were lucky, particularly if they were from the West Country. Tudor Rees of Bristol, a Harley sidecar driver, left home at 5am, crossed the Severn Bridge and encountered little serious snow until Shrewsbury. Norton Villiers teamsters John McDermott (Commando) and John Wood (Mercury) made the 250-mile journey from London in 12 hours flat. However, Saturday did bring mini-blizzards of astonishing ferocity. The Llanberis Pass was officially closed to traffic when Jean-Marie Debonneville reached Pen-y-Gwryd with his BMW-VW special at 1am. But this lion-hearted Frenchman recruited a\n\ngroup of like-minded sidecarrists and together they heaved each other’s outfits to the summit. “It took us four hours to make 12 kilometres,” exulted Jean-Marie when he and his friends reached the rally site. By the afternoon conditions in the pass were easier, thanks largely to the sturdy efforts of the RAF Mountain Rescue Team who hacked a rideable trail through hard-packed snow and frozen slush. Under such conditions they were indeed a hardy band at Glyn Padarn. The final count, nearly 1,900, was the smallest ever recorded, but as Yorkshireman Colin Bembridge succinctly pointed out, “Every one you expected to get here has, and those you didn’t couldn’t.” As the traditional bonfire flames crackled skyward in the frosty night air, snowballs flew in tremendous volleys. Everyone joined in the glorious battle, Sunday morning came, and bikes had to be dug out of still more snow. Yet another struggle over the Llanberis Pass glissade lay ahead. Across the wild moorland by Cerrigydrudion snow squalls reduced visibility to a matter of yards. Yet still occasional headlights would loom out of the murk, pressing steadily into the mountains towards Glyn Padarn. These stragglers had fought long, desperate battles against weather and mechanical disasters. And the Conway Club kept the control open long after sunset to award that covered prize—badge of the Dragon 69, fiercest rally of them all.”\n\nAwards: Overall long distance, H Klaus (BMW R60) from Hanover; British long distance, R McCullah Triumph 650) and D Milligan (Honda 450) from Irvine; women’s long distance, J Stevens (Maicoletta 250) from Surbiton; veteran machine, S Rogers (1937 Rudge 500) from Hanworth; oldest rallyist, L Star, 69 (Triumph 200) from Gosport; club turnout, Guildford (57% of membership).\n\nNITOR SUBSEQUENTLY OPINED: “If this year’s Dragon Rally wasn’t the best of the lot, I’ll eat my new American bone-dome, detachable peak and all. The clerk of the weather obliged with blizzards on all three days; as one rallyist put it, with enough snow to make it an achievement to get there, yet not too much to drift everything solid…Sidecarrists should really take a modest back seat, for they had little to worry about save the odd snowblocked pass to push their outfits through. It was tough for most of those who rode solo. Colleague Stewart Burroughs did just that on his Super Rocket, but by happy chance he chose to go by way of the Severn Valley where the snowfall had been less intense. Some heroes actually dared the adventure on customised roadsters, complete with clip-ons, rearsets and ribbed front tyres. Among this select company was our new Midlands advertising man, Howard Middleton, who rode his Velocette Thruxton. As for Ron James of Llangollen, he pulled off the feat on a 1916 2.5hp Clyno with belt drive. It’s perhaps a pity there wasn’t a special plaque to clip on to the souvenir badge, like that awarded for the beach ride in the Dutch Starfish Rally. Imagine the hush in the clubroom when the battle-seasoned warrior proudly displays his Dragon badge with clasp, campaign of 69!”\n\nJOHN EBBRELL ALSO REFLECTED on his expedition to the Dragon, reporting that he started his run north on a roadtest BSA Rocket 3 “that glorious snorting stallion…After Watford Gap the snow began to settle and my speed fell to a mere 20mph trickle in second; on the Coventry Bypass I found myself confronted by the first jack-knifed artic”. He wisely detoured to Small Heath and swapped the shiny 500lb solo for a a well-worn Lightning-Palma outfit which had to be taken through Birmingham where “every main-road junction in that city of little hills seemed choked solid with its queue of grinding, slithering, helpless lorries and cars”. Ebbrell made it through, with “the priceless advantage of direct power drive and turn-on-a-sixpence manoeuvrability, a sidecar outfit is well-equipped to wriggle through snowbound traffic.” Following a freezing ride, taking refuge with a chum and problems the next morning restarting the well-worn Lightning he made it to the site where “old friends had many stirring tales to relate about their adventures…As we were going home on Sunday, even in late afternoon, there were still bikes heading in the opposite direction, struggling to reach Llanberis. However long had they been on the road? What lessons in winter riding must they have learned?”\n\n…AND THERE’S MORE! MY CHUM FANFAN (who has supplied most of the pics you’ll find in the Illustrative Melange) wrote thusly in the impossible-to-overpraise rally/touring website lpmcc.net: “A few months ago, my old friend, the venerable Jean-Marie Debonneville, a role model for so many rallyists, sent me some interesting pictures to add to my already burgeoning archives, all taken during his ‘polar expedition’ to the 1969 Dragon rally. These pictures depicted one of the most brutally icy years of this legendary Welsh winter meeting. Although he has now given up riding for health reasons, his passion for motorcycling and rallies remains as strong as ever and has never faded. The same however cannot be said for the thousands of archive photos, some now over 50 years old. These photos provide a unique record of his travels around the world on two or three wheels. He is now well over 80 years old, but he continues to travel enthusiastically down memory lane, from rally to rally, using the medium of photography in the albums he has created, discovering a new hobby along the way: that of keeping a scrapbook. He doesn’t show any signs of slowing down. He has thousands of slides, prints and 8mm films documenting his motorcycle accomplishments and it will take him many more years to complete his artistic endeavours. So, I wish him long life and time enough to enjoy the beautiful years he still has ahead of him, making us dream by sharing his memories and experiences of the past as he has now enabled us to share his memories through this site. The photos he took of the 1969 meeting were a superb record of events encapsulating the conditions at the time. Not only that but they are in colour, which was then becoming popular, taking over from simple monochrome. So here they are shared with me… and now with you. My initial idea was to write a straightforward report on this meeting, inserting Jean-Marie’s photos along the way. To do this effectively, I just needed to call him and interview him over the phone to get a better, more in-depth understanding of the rally itself. I already had a few questions prepared, and wondered if his memory would be good enough to recall anecdotes that took place 53 years ago. I needn’t have worried. For his part, Jean-Marie sent me a press article that he’d written upon his return from the rally in order to promote it to French motorcyclists. So rather than use my words I’ve decided to use his… almost verbatim, but with some edits. It’s a brilliant report recounting his epic winter ride in Wales in February 1969.”\n\n“THE DRAGON RALLY IS CERTAINLY the most popular rally in Great Britain, a bit like the Elefantentreffen that many French people know. On the other hand, this gathering, which can attract up to 3,*000 people, is much less popular for the French. Yet what a marvellous rally, and what an unusual sight. I believe I was the first Frenchman to have taken part, back in 1965 and this year I went for the fifth time, astride my special VW with Jean-Pierre Mullier as my friend and passenger. We took no special equipment other than good waterproofs for the almost incessant rain in Wales in February. Alas, snow equipment would have been more useful this time around. There were several options to cross the Channel from France, but I preferred the 2.30am departure from Dunkirk, which disembarked around 7am, allowing us a full day in the UK upon arrival. So, on Thursday, we arrived at the port and had a pleasant surprise: two German riders, (on 650 AJS and 450 Honda solos) from Wupperthal, and three Frenchmen from the BMW Club de l’Ouest (on R69S solos). We all arrived in Dover together but there we left each other, each of us having a different schedule. We had no problems until around Friday noon when we left Birmingham on the A5 towards the Dragon. There the snow storm began and in less than an hour the snow lay so thickly that any progress on four wheels or more proved impossible. We drove without interruption for almost 18 hours covering hundreds of kilometers. Lorries stuck sideways in the hills caused queues of cars sometimes 20km long. We had to ride on the verges or on the pavement, or sometimes even against the flow of traffic on the dual carriageways. In short, we were trying to skirt around the delays, getting stuck and bogged down nonetheless, and generally trying to avoid all the stranded vehicles, abandoned by their owners who left on foot to seek shelter. The best part of the journey was crossing the Llanberis Pass, located just prior to the finish, which we did in the early hours of the morning, from 1am to 5am. We later found out it had been closed to traffic, although we’d missed the sign announcing its closure as it was completely covered in snow. Whilst ascending Llanberis we passed two completely stranded BSA 650S combos. However, my VW having a 4.50 tyre and enormous torque at low revs had a clear advantage over them. We completed the journey ahead of the rest, sometimes with the help of a shovel, and sometimes with all six of us having to push as well. The storm was so intense at the top of the pass that the path we had cleared in the VW was obliterated in less than 15 minutes, and the following bike, a BSA, had to clear a path all over again. That proved the downfall of the BSA. It was completely ‘drowned’ and refused to start, instead letting itself be pulled to Llanberis. At dawn the army cleared the road and all day the ‘Dragonists’ arrived solo or with sidecars. During that day a disparate world of motorbikes assembled itself, resembling a weird collection of enthusiasts and their machines. On Saturday evening a tour of the local pubs meant copious amounts of beer were drunk. Needless to say, some glasses got broken and there were many people worse for wear. On Sunday the roads that had been ploughed and salted were much smoother but also more aggressive for the machines themselves. This 1969 Dragon is finished and for us it was the best rally ever. Hopefully next year there will be a contingent of Frenchmen to rival that seen at the Elefantentreffen. At the Dragon rally, the entry or participation of cars is strictly prohibited. This rule is enforced in respect of pseudo rallyists who came this year by car to the Nürburgring, disguised as motorcyclists, and who are sounding the death knell of the great German rally.\n\nReport: Jean-Marie Debonneville\n\nImages: JM Debonneville & JF Helias”\n\nMANY AN ELEPHANT RALLYIST must have sniffed last week’s mild breezes and groaned, “ This year it’s going to be just too easy.” But the great German get-together did not completely fail its reputation. Christmas snow still lay thickly about the Nürburgring road-racing circuit. At dusk on Friday an iron-hard frost clamped down on the Eifel Mountains, turning the steep, hairpin roads into dicey skating rinks. For some Britons, adventure began even before they left England. This mournful catalogue of misfortunes befell Stockport Clubman Alun Turner’s Norton-Steib outfit. At Luton the speedo broke; in the Dartford Tunnel the primary chain came off; before Dover, clutch slip set in. Things went no better on the other side. “My petrol tank sprang a leak in Bruges, and the exhaust pipe split near Liege,” he was heard to complain. “Oh yes, and the sidecar fell off at the German frontier.” This year will surely go down as the biggest Elephant Rally ever. Official estimates of the attendance ran to five figures. One of the best-ever club turn-outs from Britain was provided by the Conway Club: 18 rallyists out of a membership of 49. A capacity crowd thronged the trade stands, talking, shouting, laughing and haggling in a dozen languages, turning the racers paddock into a cross between an Eastern bazaar and a super-cosmopolitan Earls Court Then imagine the sensation when a large truck from a Nuremburg circus rolled up to disgorge (yes, you’ve guessed it!) a real, live baby elephant. At nightfall, Ernst Levercus performed that solemn and very German ceremony, the oration for riders who have passed on since the last rally, and lit the torches of remembrance which are borne in procession round the circuit. Spectators who’d climbed the towering battlements of the Nürburg castle enjoyed a truly grandstand view as the spectacular headlight parade set out. And what a caper it became, as machines skated and slithered round 14 miles of snow-packed curves and frozen gradients. Leverkus, father of this great event, will long cherish the memory of this Elephant. At an informal ceremony round one of the many camp fires, a group of German admirers presented him with an exact replica of an 1807 Prussian dragoon’s carbine, hand made specially for the occasion by gunsmith-motor cyclist Karl Johnsdorf. Leverkus collects antique firearms. It is common for riders to codge up an old bike just to do the Elephant. Most of the Ashfield (Southampton) Club’s contingent arrived in one body, mounted on no fewer than eight solo BSA Bantams—but only 7½ went home. As Terry Endein’s bike reached the Ring, the rear hub collapsed irreparably. But the engine-gear unit was still in good order, so they brought it home in a fellow member’s sidecar and left the rest to rot! [You’ll find comprehensive coverage of this Elephant Rally (and many others) with an astonishing selection of pics at lpmcc.net.]\n\n“A RIPE SLICE OF NOSTALGIA comes from reader Eddie Ricketts, of Ware, Hertfordshire,” Nitor reported. “It is a long paean of praise for the dear, departed Panther. ‘The greatest bike ever made in England,’ he says. His 1957 six-hundred served him well—70,000 miles pulling a Busmar Devon “complete with six cwt of humans and half cwt of wife’s stuff”. Now Eddie has bought a six-fifty Panther and looks forward to another 15 to 20 happy years. ‘My point is this,’ he goes on. ‘Can anyone visualise a Japanese buzzbox working, pulling like a Panther?’ All very charming, we appreciate, but the gigantic long-stroke single had become a dead duck long before the famous Cleckheaton manufacturer stopped production of bikes a few years ago. Everything was against it, including fashion. Farewell to the days when an ignition advance-retard lever was as good as a second gear pedal! Most popular sidecar today is the single-seat sports; and, for that, a potent parallel twin makes the best sort of workhorse.”\n\n“‘BORN 1880 AND STILL GOING STRONG’ could be a fitting slogan for 88-year-old George bucket of Knighton, Isle of Wight, particularly when he is astride the Triumph which he has owned for the past 41 years. He bought his first machine—a single-cylinder belt-drive Clyno—in 1906. In 1927 the spanking new 494cc Triumph outfit was delivered to his cottage door by George Siggery, now managing director of Borrough Hall Newport, Isle of Wight, who was then a mechanic for Stanley Russell, motor-cycle distributors. George Bucket well recalls his first trip on the Triumph, with his wife in the sidecar. It was a tour of Devon; he did 160 miles on the first day. During the Second World War he was a member of Ryde Home Guard and inevitably ended up as company despatch rider. That grand old Triumph even served on occasion as a Bren gun carrier! George works for The Ryde Borough Council’s water works department. After 70 years’ continuous service he has no thought of retiring; nor, it seems, from his motor cycling. Last November he drove over from his Isle of Wight home to Reading. He says he does his own routine maintenance and has no difficulty getting insurance. So is George Bucket Britain’s oldest active motor cyclist?”\n\nMAJOR DAVID GOODEM, FORMER secretary-general of the FIM, warned: “Unless drastic action is taken quickly, the FIM as we have known it in the west for over 50 years is a dead duck. It is fast becoming a political tool of the Russians. With the bloc vote and support from fellow-travellers, the Russians are pushing our sport around.”\n\nEVEN THE NUMBER 8 HATS at Motor Cycle couldn’t get it right all the time: “The facts are that the Japanese factories went into roadracing to gain publicity and, having done just that, they have quit. It is no good whining and asking them to come back. They have gone, and in my opinion they have gone for good. The few remaining Japanese manufacturers are fighting to keep in business and can no longer afford grand-prix racing…Racing will go ahead as well as ever without the Japanese.”\n\n“I AND MANY OTHERS ON their way to the Elephant Rally really appreciated the free soup served up at the docks in Dover by a couple of local riders. It went down a treat,\n\nPeter Gannet, London SE2.”\n\nCOMMENTING ON ADS FOR a 1939 990cc V-twin Matchless at £100 and a Series B Vincent Rapide at £190 (by comparison a new Bonnie was listed at £395) ‘Nitor’ of the Blue ‘Un opined: “Prices are kept up by a passion for good old-fashioned quality and character against the garish yet drab world of mass production.”\n\nBMW CEASED PRODUCTION OF its 500 to concentrate on the 600, 750 and 900. Electric starts became standard on 750s and 900s; a 12V alternator replaced the dynamo.\n\n“SPEED STARVED FANS who braved the near-zero temperatures to watch the first road-race meeting of the season, at Brands Hatch on Sunday, were rewarded with five hours of top-class short circuit dicing.”\n\nSAMMY MILLER WON THE CALTEX Motor Sport Award (for Ireland’s most successful contestant in two and four-wheel sport), not least for winning the British solo trials championship for the 10th year running.\n\nPIG FARMER ANDREW CHAPMAN, 19, entered his first sidecar race (at Brands Hatch); for his passenger, Bob Rowden, this was his first race of any kind. They were up against some of Britain’s fastest charioteers so, inevitably, they won.\n\nAS PART OF A GOVERNMENT austerity campaign the Department of Transport ordered local authorities to cut their road maintenance budgets by 15%.\n\nA BRACE OF BSA ROCKET 3s Ridden by Dick Mann and Yvon Du Hamel set American Motorcycle Association stock-machine records at Daytona. Du Hamel averaged 127.95mph over 10 miles and 127.6mph over 50 miles. Mann set 100 and 200-mile records at 125.99mph and 123.41mph respectively. A Rocket 3 also carried Darrell Triber of Spokane, Washington on a 1,393-mile run from Blaine, on the US-Canada border to Tijuana in 23hr 35min to average just under 60mph, knocking more than four hours off the 28hr 7min ‘three-flag’ record which had been set in 1936 by Fred Ham on a Harley. The first three-flag record was set by the legendary Cannonball Baker, who took 81hr 15min in 1915. Meanwhile in Austria a university techie Peter Karlau rode a Trident 767 miles from Vienna to Hamburg in 9hr 40min, an average of 79.2mph. That included fuelling stops and a broken chain. Actual riding time was 8hr 37min (88.5mph).\n\nBSA GROUP CHIEF ENGINEER Bert Hopwood explained why he had designed a triple, rather than a four: “Width and cost. We decided the engine should be as narrow as possible. Besides, the more cylinders, the more expensive the engine is to produce…The Triumph engine was readily adaptable to three cylinders by reason of its camshaft layout…The BSA twin, with its single camshaft and cast-in pushrod tunnel, was a less suitable basis.” Hopwood added that he had stuck to an ohv configuration because he felt a move to ohc as a way of boost power output was unnecessary: “Surely 60bhp—say 75 with further development—is power enough? Who is going to use more performance than that anyway?”\n\nCALIFORNIAN PUBLISHER FLOYD CLYMER announced plans for a range of bikes to be built in Germany and Italy for the UK market. Munch would supply its 1,200cc four-pot Mammoth, and would build a bike round a modified Horex 600cc ohc vertical twin using Ceriani forks. There was talk of a vee-twin to be marketed as an Indian but at the heart of the range were Indians powered by 500cc Velocette and 750cc Royal Enfield engines. The Enfield Interceptor chassis was designed and built in Bologna by Leo (Italjet) Tartarini who also chipped in with three ‘US-style’ 50s: the Papoose, the Ponybike and the Boy Racer. Munch, also developed a 500cc dohc vertical-twin racing engine with a bolt-on gear box and sent it to be framed at Rickman Bros. Fewer than 20 Interceptor-powered Indians had been completed when Clymer died a few months later; the remaining Enfield engines were put to good use by the Rickman Brothers.\n\nTHE AMERICAN MAGAZINE CYCLE condemned the TT course as “full of treacherous decreasing radius and off-camber bends and bordered by solid, saw-toothed walls and fences”.\n\nIN HIS ROADTEST OF the MZ ES150 Willoughby remarked: “You only have to look at the distinctive lines of the ES150 to recognise it’s an MZ, the marque that carried the East German Trophy Team to an incredible sequence of five victories in the International Six Days’ Trial from 1963-1967…The MZ reflects its rugged cross-country heritage in traits that appeal strongly to the all-purpose rider.” Handling, he described as “magnificent”; top speed was 67mph. “Lines of the RS150 are saucy and it looks gay with its tank and headlamp shell, red seat, gold lining and ample chromium plating…all in all a remarkably fine lightweight for the no-nonsense rider.”\n\n“THE MAN WHO PROMOTED the world’s first speedway meeting, Johnnie Hoskins, is to be made president of Britain’s second division. Hoskins, who now organises meetings at Canterbury, ran the first speedway meeting at an agricultural meeting in West Maitland, Australia, in 1923.” (You’ll find more details in 1923.)\n\n“WERE HE STILL IN HARNESS, Edward Turner, Britain’s outstanding designer for some 30 years from 1936, would plump for a 500cc four-in-line with 40bhp, vivid acceleration up to some 70mph (the speed limit not on in Britain but in much of the US too) and a top whack of 100mph for unrestricted roads.” Turner shared his ideas during a talk to the Ringwood MCC. “Turner is dismayed at the extent of recent American influence on design. Today’s high-performance machines, the threes and fours, are too expensive, he said, and 750cc is too large a capacity for a vertical twin…two-strokes he dismissed on account of the difficulty of combining high performance with reasonable fuel economy.”\n\nPUCH LAUNCHED THE twist-and-go automatic Maxi moped in the UK but warned that licensing legislation was hindering sales. Motor Cycle editor Harry Louis agreed: “For years now there has been talk of lowering the licence age to 15—even 14—and waiving the driving licence, provided mopeds were limited in performance to, say, 30mph, so bringing Britain into line with the practice in many other countries. This would be a real safety boost, with young people getting used to power on the simplest and most easy-to-ride machines.”\n\nFOR THE FIRST TIME since it was established in 1966 the ice racing world championship was held outside Russia. The new venue, at the West German ski resort if Inzell, in the Bavarian Alps, made no difference to Russian champion Gabdrakman Kadyrov who became world champion for the third time. Britain’s first-ever world ice finalist, Andy Ross, British 500cc grasstrack champion, was runner-up in the last heat after bouncing back from two spectacular crashes. He finished equal 10th and announced: “I’ve ridden my last race on ice now that I’ve reached my ambition of competing in the world final.” The 1967 world champ, Russian Vladimir Zibrov, was disqualified from a heat after touching the start tapes. “The crowd erupted against the decision, jeering and throwing bottles and can cans until the police moved in to restore order.” East German riders were absent—they were refused visas for travel to West Germany.\n\n“THIS YEAR’S SHAMROCK RALLY was a great success, I gather from Gerry Kennedy,” Nitor reported. “Entries were up to 300 (200 of them from across the Irish Sea, by the way); Ireland’s greatest road-racer Stanley Woods added lustre to the gathering, pleasing his hosts mightily by declaring that if he were a younger motor cyclist again it’s rallying he’d be going in for, not racing. Even the weather played its part magnificently by providing Co Kerry with the most brilliantly sunny weekend of the year. “It only rained once,” said Gerry. “That was at 2am Sunday. I remember the time because the pubs had just started to close.”\n\n“MY WIFE AND I have returned to motor cycling after a gap of 10 years. Our last machine was a Tiger 110, but now we have a couple of 150cc Hondas, and excellent little machines they are—though we wish the importers were a little more co-operative and quicker off the mark when asked for technical information. But where have all the real motor cyclists gone? Where’s all the old friendliness, the readiness to help, the camaraderie? This morning I had a minor breakdown. It took only 20 minutes to put right but in that time 11 bikes went by, not one stopping to assist. And the number of burn-up merchants is startling. In the two weeks we have been riding we have seen the most appalling behaviour—deliberate cutting-up of other road-users, unnecessary throttle-blipping and noise, and dangerous showing off. We’re not old-timers but from all we’ve noticed in the past two weeks, we feel like a couple of over-cautious old fogies who still believe in safe riding. The whole fraternity seems to have changed beyond all recognition.\n\nDave and Dusty Wiseman, London W3.”\n\n“I AM DISTRESSED by the lack of information in Motor Cycle about the current range of Phoboph motor cycles. I heard a rumour that a new model was to be announced at the Brighton Show; the Phlexidrive. Phoboph’s answer to the Norton Commando. As well as the engine being rubber-mounted, the crankshaft, con-rods and pistons are made of rubber. This breakthrough in engine design is said to give a far more phlexible power-band than for any previous engines. The new Phoboph uses a constant-mesh gearbox. In fact it is so constant that it can’t be got out of mesh. Hence the need for a more phlexible power band.\n\nMC Cox, Brighton, Sussex.”\n\nAs well informed readers will know, the Phoboph range featured some remarkable models, including the turbocharged Phlatulent, the 18cc Phoetus and the 2,500cc single-cylinder Phearsome—Ed.\n\n“SIDECARS SURVIVE, BUT ONLY JUST, Nitor warned. “Watsonian soldier on as Britain’s last manufacturer, and the position on the Continent is no better. Even Steib have ceased production. Nevertheless, through the cloth-cab, rock-bottom-price family transport brackets seems to have shifted to three-wheelers, a hard core of dyed-in-the-glass-fibre sidecar enthusiasts remain. And a keen lots they are, comparable in their enthusiasm with the vintage brigade.”\n\n“YORKSHIREMAN BILL WILKINSON achieved his greatest victory last week when he powered a works 250cc Greeves to his first win in the Scottish Six Days Trial after one of the most dramatic and closely fought weeks in the event’s 60-year history. Wrecking British and European champion Sammy Miller’s bid for his sixth Scottish win and the hat-trick, Wilkinson winkled Miller and his Bultaco from the lead during Saturday’s final stage of the 692-mile Highland international…ending a run of mechanical failures in his previous nine Scottish rides. His effort brought Greeves their first victory in the trial after about 15 years of effort—and the first British machine success since 1966…Still without a production trials machine on the market after Villiers engine supplies were axed two years ago, Greeves sent no mechanic or executive in Support. And when Greeves director Derry Preston Cobb was telephoned with the news of Wilkinson’s win, he did not believe it….all but one of the next nine places were filled by Spanish Bultaco, Ossa and Montessa machined or British-modified Japanese Suzukis…the Montessa trio of Gordon Farley, Don Smith and Lawrence Telling aced the Barcelona factory’s first Scottish success by winning the manufacturer’s team prize after a week-long ding-dong with the Suzuki team…Mick Andrews (250cc Ossa) stole up from fourth place on the final day to seize second spot under Miller’s nose…Miller finished one mark down on Andrews with Don Smith, the leader for the first two days, taking fourth place, seven marks behind Miller. Best 150cc rider was 17-year-old Martin Lampkin (126cc G aunt Suzuki) , with Miller (252cc Bultaco) leading the 350cc battle from start to finish and Rob Edwards (170cc Cotton), 10th overall, having a runaway success in the 200cc class. Top newcomer was 21-year-old Darrell Stobbart (250cc Bultaco) from Barrow-in-Furness…The Edinburgh Club’s event is run against the clock, with average speeds ranging between eight and 24mph and a one-mark-per-minute penalty for riders outside a one-minute allowance at time checks…The course, which started and finished in Edinburgh but was centred 150 miles away on Fort William during the week, turned out to be less gruelling than those of the past two years. But the sections were plenty tough.”\n\n“WORLD-CHAMPIONSHIP ROAD RACING is at the crossroads,” Mick Woollett warned. “The Japanese have pulled out and it is now up to the European factories and private equipes to make a success of the series—just as it was when the championship began in 1949.”\n\nALEC ISSIGONIS, THE ITALIAN guru who designed the Mini, was contracted to design the next generation of bikes from Norton Villiers. “And it is believed that this brief does not even rule out the possibility of new road-racers going on the drawing board.”\n\n‘DETERMINED TO IMPROVE SPARES and service facilities, Lambretta-Trojan, new controllers of Suzuki (UK) Ltd, have flown a representative to Japan to bring back urgently needed parts to Britain. New Suzuki director Maurice Knight said he hoped that a spares service would be working within a fortnight.” Knight promised to “get the complete service up to Lambretta standard”.\n\nGREEVES WORKS MOTO-CROSSER Richard Hughes was forced to put his racing career on hold for 18 months because his mum and dad wouldn’t sign his contract. Hughes, 19, left home, near Maldon, Essex “to stand on his own two feet”; he planned to ride for Greeves again as soon as he turned 21. However, within a few weeks Motor Cyccle reported: “Teenage scrambler Richard Hughs may bid to become a ward of court in an attempt to beat the racing ban imposed by his parents. He is holding on to his Greeves works machines until he has had legal advice. Nineteen-year-old Hughes cannot ride without parental permission until he is 21. And his mother and father refused to countersign his entry form after a family row over the young landscape gardener’s girlfriend. If Richard does become a ward, the court could give permission, as his legal guardian, for him to race.”\n\n“SACKED BY GREEVES AFTER an on-off parental ban on racing, 19-year-old Maldon, Essex, scrambler Richard Hughes rode a 250cc AJS into second place in the 250cc allcomers’ race at the Stourbourne scramble at Wratling, Suffolk on Sunday. It was his first outing on the AJS, which he collected from the Andover, Hants factory on Friday. In recent years he has been racing a 250cc Husqvarna…AJS director Peter Inchley said: ‘We are lending Richard a bike to see how he gets on with it. If he likes the machine and goes well we might enter him in some of this winter’s TV meetings.'”\n\nMOTOR CYCLE’S MIDLANDS ADVERTISING rep Howard Middleton rode a 1966 Velocette Venom Thruxton. Top-of-the-range Thruxtons were selling so well that the Hall Green factory would not spare one for roadtest. Motor Cycle was particularly keen to test the latest Thruxton. And that’s why Middleton’s bike was stripped, refurbished and rebuilt to 1969 spec at the factory (the main changes concerned cylinder-head tracts and valve diameter). Velo singles had been about for decades but in 1967 Neil Kelly had ridden a Thruxton to victory in the 500cc Production TT at 89.89mph with a 90mph-plus lap. With a spec including an Amal GP carb, twin-leading-shoe front brake, close-ration box, ally rims, rearsets and clip-ons “the Thruxton is, in essence, a road-going racer…traditionalists to a man, Velo fans were dismayed when, a few months ago, the factory abandoned the hallowed magneto and…installed direct-current coil ignition. It was an enforced choice following a stop to magneto manufacture by Lucas, yet…as a result the Thruxton has become much more civilised. Formerly, starting was an acquired art, the secrets of which were passed down from Velo-owning father to son. Now, it is a first- or second-kick exercise calling for nothing more in pre-kick drill than a flooded float chamber and a gentle easing over compression…This particular Thruxton was used by Middleton for the 1969 Dragon Rally…plodding along through deep snow at 15 to 20mph without missing a beat…Many times on that trip the coil ignition showed its worth, keeping the engine pulling strongly and happily from as low as 1,500rpm…The semi-racing crouch defeats wind pressure without placing too much strain on the wrists and arms. The Velo is. above all, an enthusiast’s machine and, given an experienced rider, can out-perform most other models on the road, six-fifties not excepted…with its two-way damped front fork the Thruxton is superior even to the Venom. It can be cranked over safely until the footrest ends touch down, and that is way beyond the limits of lean found in normal riding…The legal 70mph limit can be held indefinitely, the engine turning over lazily at a mere 4,000rpm…Given freedom from speed limits, as at the MIRA circuit, and the bike cruises comfortably in the nineties. Top whack? Our two-way 104mph figure was recorded on an exceptionally windy day, and though an exhilarating 114mph was recorded when running with the breeze, the opposite-direction run came down with a bump to just under 95mph…under calmer conditions the two-way speed could well have been a couple of miles an hour higher…The Thruxton brakes were first class…offering plenty of feel and a reassuring freedom from fade…Big surprise of the test was the meagre fuel consumption…the recorded 96mpg at a steady 30mph would have done credit to a touring 250 (even at 60mph consumption was 63mpg)…To condemn it to a life among city streets would be sheer cruelty to machinery, but owner Howard Middleton is a long-distance rally addict, and for fun of this nature the Thruxton must come very close indeed to the ideal mount.”\n\n“DESPITE BEING CUT TO A ONE-DAY event with no overnight camping , Sunday’s Brith Motorcyclists’ Rally at Woburn Abbey, Beds, attracted over 2,500 entries. Voted Miss Federation 1969 was Vincent Owners Club member Heather Benyon of Trowbridge, Wilts. Outright long-distance award went to Canadian C Cuthbert (BMW), who started from Munich. Ladies’ long-distance award winner was Hillary Musson of Grimsby, and NHJ Shaw of Bromsgrove topped the veteran-vintage distance contest with a 75-mile run. Concours d’Elegance class winners were Robert Tucker (250 BMW), Ian Lane (1,000 Vincent), Michael Green (350 BSA, 1927), Alexander Ayers (350 Velocette, 1937) and Ron Payne (500 Triumph, 1926). Special-of-the Year award went to David Blanchard (EMC Excelsior.”\n\n“THREE OF THE MOST IMPRESSIVE outfits on the British grass-track sidecar championship trail this year are the unorthodox car-engined specials of Nobby Golden and Dave Langley and the immaculate 998cc V-twin JAP plot of the Miell brothers, John and David. All three made their title debuts at Easter’s Yeo Valley meeting. But it was Golden’s Renault-powered machine, finished at only 2.45am that day, which caused the biggest stir. This was mainly because of its twin rear wheels, which consist of two 3.50x16in Dunlop rims spoked to a common hub and shod with two Dunlop knobblies. Mounted transversely, exhaust ports facing to the rear, in a frame of mixed channel and square-section members, its 845cc four-cylinder engine drives from a sprocket on the left end of the crankshaft, through a four-speed AMC gearbox. Robbed from his own Ford van, Dave Langley’s 998cc engine is mounted in the sidecar…A large part of the outfit’s frame also originated in the four-wheeled world—as propshafts. A Dodge shaft was used as the backbone and the front downtube is part of a Ford Consul shaft. The Miells’ rare JAP unit…is mounted in the duplex frame with the front cylinder vertical and the other sloping rearward. This arrangement will allow the brothers to install their 650cc Triumph engine as a spare if the JAP blows up in a big way.”\n\n“THRUXTON SIZZLED WITH SPEED on Sunday when Motor Cycle’s international 500-mile Grand Prix d’Endurance returned to the Hampshire circuit. Overcast skies and a spattering of rain midway through the race did not stop Percy Tait and Malcolm Uphill on the winning 650cc Triumph Bonneville from shattering all previous records with a searing average of 84.3mph. It was the first time in the 15-year history of the event that it has been won at over the 80mph mark. The factory prepared Triumph led almost throughout the race, but at one stage Welshman Uphill abandoned all hope of victory. ‘The engine seized and locked the back wheel. I pulled the clutch in and coasted for a while. My heart sank. I said that we were out of the race,’ said Malcolm. After coasting almost to a standstill he dropped the clutch. The engine fired and he toured into the pits. There, under the vigilant eyes of Triumph development chief Doug Hele, the plugs were changed, the bike was refuelled and Percy Tait took over. After a couple of cautious laps Tait opened up and from then on the Triumph ran faultlessly to the end…the bike bikes dominated the dominated the race, taking the first five places with Triumphs first second and third. Sixth home and winner of the 500cc class was yet another Triumph, the Daytona entered by Hughes and ridden by Ray Knight and Martin Carney…Pickrell, lying second to the Tait-Uphill Triumph, arrived at the pits on the pillion of a marshall’s bike. He reported that he had abandoned the Triumph after it had clanked to a standstill with a gaping hole punched through the crankcase by a broken con-rod…Minutes later a completely exhausted Tony Smith staggered into the pits area pushing the works BSA Spitfire that he was sharing with Pat Mahoney. He had run out of fuel and had shoved the 400lb BSA for well over a mile. He collapsed in the pits, the bike was refuelled and Mahoney got away as a BSA mechanic carried Smith to the ambulance room…Barnett, on the other factory Lightning, came in only a lap after taking over from Spencer. The BSA was jumping out of gear; the bike was withdrawn. This incident was quickly followed by news that the Ossa that was leading the 250cc class by a lap had been eliminated by a crash. In the 500cc class the Knight-Carney Triumph continued to run perfectly. It was four laps clear of the Suzuki Cobra ridden by Dave Browning and Grant Gibson with the Whiteways-Woods Suzuki Suzuki a similar margin ahead of the Ducatis of Clive Thompsett and Ron Baylie and Ken Watson and Chas Mortimer.”\n\nResults\n\nOverall: 1, P Tait/M Uphill (650 Triumph) 212 laps, 5hr 55min 39.2sec; 2, JH Cooper/S Jolly (650 Triumph) 208 laps, 5hr 55min 40sec; 3, L Phelps/C Carr (650 Triumph) 207 laps 5hr 56min 17.4sec; 4, AJ Smith/P Mahoney (650 BSA) 200 laps, 5hr 55min 53.6sec; 5, K Buckmaster/G Collis (650 Triumph), 199 laps, 5hr 56min 36.2sec; 6, R Knight/M Carney (500 Triumph) 199 laps, 5hr 56min 52.8sec. 750cc: 1, JH Cooper/S Jolly (650 Triumph) 208 laps, 5hr 55min 40sec; 2, L Phelps/C Carr (650 Triumph) 207 laps 5hr 56min 17.4sec; AJ Smith/P Mahoney (650 BSA) 200 laps, 5hr 55min 53.6sec; 4, K Buckmaster/G Collis (650 Triumph), 199 laps, 5hr 56min 36.2sec; 5, R Avery/C Dixon (750 Triumph), 198 laps, 5hr 56min 37.6sec; 6, A Jeffries/J Barton (650 Triumph), 193 laps, 5hr 56min 50.4sec. 500cc: R Knight/M Carney (500 Triumph) 199 laps, 5hr 56min 52.8sec; 2, D Browning/G Gibson (Suzuki), 196 laps, 5hr 56min 41.4sec; 3, P Butler/D Dixon (Triumph), 188 laps, 5hr 55min 46.8sec; 4, G Green/R Guy (Triumph), 187 laps, 5hr 56min 40sec; 5, P Smart/T Dickie (350 Ducati), 187 laps, 5hr 56min 58.2sec; 6, C Williams/A Peck (441 BSA), 183 laps, 5hr 57min 5sec. 250cc: 1, F Whiteways/S Woods (Suzuki), 191 laps, 5hr 57sec 35.2sec; 2, K Watson/C Mortimer (Ducati) 187 laps, 5hr 55min 46.8sec; 3, C Thompsett/G Hunter (Ducati) 186 laps, 5hr 57min 5sec; 4, T Loughridge/P Walsh (Suzuki) 174 laps, 5hr 56min 32.6sec; 5, E Pitt/C Bond (Yamaha), 173 laps, 5hr 57min 11.6sec; 6, H Kist/T Lablans (Honda) 173 laps, 5hr 57min 18.6 sec.\n\nFOLLOWING THE THRUXTON 500-MILER Mick Wollett noted: “Quite a lot of resentment was generated when the two works-prepared Norton Commandos appeared with brand new disc front brakes which hardly anyone, let alone the average clubman, had ever seen before. Yet the Norton entries were in order, for there is a loophole in the regulations through which you can drive the proverbial coach and horses. This bypass to more exotic equipment comes under the heading of optional extras, and it seems to me time it was plugged…it gets a bit naughty when special equipment, not on sale, is used.” (The ACU also took a lot of interest in the Commando discs when they appeared at the Production TT; you’ll be able to read all about it as soon as I’ve finished writing it. But that will have to wait until the new clutch plates are in the GS850 combo…first things first.)\n\n“AS A SUBJECT FOR METICULOUS RESTORATION, a vintage speedway Rudge might seem an odd choice,” Bob Currie admitted. “As Dave McMahon of Coventry, who spent nine years on the project, admits: ‘There’s not a lot I can do with it, now the job is finished. There are no brakes, so I can’t even use it for vintage grass-track meetings—and it’s too big to sit on the mantlepiece!’ However, there’s a historical angle. This is a 499cc four-valver with iron barrel and head, dating from 1928, the infancy of British speedway. At that time nobody had a clear idea of what sort of bike was needed, hence the abundance of extra frame struts to give absolute rigidity. Only later was it discovered that a degree of frame whip was, in fact, an advantage. Details include an ML racing magneto…and a genuine quick-action twistgrip with rack-and-pinion operation. The fuel tank is of polished brass. The centre-stand is quite authentic. No neutral is available with the Rudge single-speed countershaft and clutch unit; the practice was to warm up the engine in the pits on its stand and with the rear wheel spinning. Immediately noticeable is the vast area of chromium-plating, on the front fork, frame struts and mudguards. Again, this is as should be. Chromium-plating was a none-too-successful novelty in 1928, but the Rudge factory had their bright parts plated by a specialist cutlery firm in Sheffield.”\n\n“ALLEGING BAD SPORTSMANSHIP by Giacomo Agostini and MV, Innocenzo Nardi-Dei, team manager of Benelli, withdrew works rider Renzo Passolini from the 350cc class of Sunday’s Spanish Grand Prix [the opening round of the world road-racing championships]. When Benelli arrived at the Jarama circuit, near Madrid, on Friday Agostini was practising although the official training did not start until Saturday. Anxious to learn the circuit, being used for the first time, Pasolini asked track officials if he could practice also. He was told that MV and Ossa had the exclusive use of the course and that he must ask them. His request was turned down and Benelli immediately withdrew. ‘If Agostini wants to practice alone he can race alone,’ said Nardi-Dei. Agostini replied: ‘For weeks we have tried to book the circuit and finally came to an agreement with Ossa. If we had let Passolini on all the others would have wanted to join in.'” After the event Motor Cycle’s Mick Woollett reported: “Two crashes and two wins—that was MV-ace Giacomo Agostini’s score after the Spanish Grand Prix. The first spill came in practice when the double world champion dropped his 350 and went bowling end over end down the track. Within five minutes he was out on his reserve machine…The second came in the 500cc race, soon after he had won the 350cc class…he was pressing Kel Carruthers (Aermacchi) hard when Kel slid off right under the MV’s front wheel. Down went Agostini. ‘I helped him pick the MV up and give him a hand starting it. That was the least I could do,’ said Kel, whose 382cc Aermacchi ended up jammed under a wire fence.” Carruthers was runner up to Agostini in the 350cc race; Bergomonti was runner up in the 500cc race on his Paton…As the field reeled off the last of the 40 laps a touch of drama returned to the race as Bergomonti’s Paton slowed almost to touring speeds. His engine coughing and banging, he completed the distance with the Paton’s rear tyre sliced through to the tube by a dangling right-hand megaphone which had broken completely away from the pipe.”\n\n“BY THE NARROW MARGIN of one mark in 50 Jaquie Blendell of London’s 59 Club became the popular winner of the Miss Mermaid competition in Holland’s Starfish Rally. She rode Bumble, her blue-and-white 500cc Triumph. The seven-mile beach ride made the big adventure of the weekend gathering on the Dutch coast. Hundreds of riders sped along hard going, squelched through quicksand, rode carefully round the tide pools and fought their way up through the dunes—with garlands of flowers and special badges for reward. This race was followed by a conducted tour round the tulip fields before the return to the Zandvoort road-race circuit for the bonfire. But, as happened last year, a nervous burgher, alarmed at the red glow on the skyline, called the fire brigade—who formally doused the flames! Though organised by only a small group of Amsterdam enthusiasts, the Starfish always provides a crowded programme.A sprint succession concluded this very successful weekend. Exactly 622 machines booked in. As last year, the British contingent, 37 bikes strong, were second only to the Dutch.”\n\n“REPEATING HIS EIFELTREFFEN form of the previous weekend, Karl Hoppe (Urs Metisse) dominated the 500cc class of the Austrian Grand Prix at Salzburg on Thursday. Not only was his race speed a record. He also shaved 0.7sec off Giacomo Agostini’s record lap made on the MV four in 1967, and must now be considered a leading contender for 500cc honours in the classics…Under ideal racing conditions the 125cc class set the ball rolling with a fierce battle between last year’s winner Lazlo Szabo (MZ) and Silvano Bertarelli on a factory five-speed Aermacchi two-stroke. The little air-cooled Italian stroker…seemed a match for the swift MZ rotary-valve six-speeder. Not far behind them till he struck trouble was the Finn Jarno Saarinen on his very neat and fast Puch Tunturi…Having his first big race on the Eddie Crooks Cobra Suzuki, Frank Perris was dogged by ignition bothers and never really got going before being forced to retire. But in the 250cc race he led from the start until three laps from the end.Then his Crooks Suzuki lost an exhaust tail pipe and 1,000rpm. That let Ralph Bryans on a Honda four borrowed from a museum into first berth…Rain on one part of the circuit, which comprises two legs of an autobahn, caused havoc among the midfield men in the 350cc race…veteran Lewis Young (Aermacchi) showed all the youngster’s the way by grabbing a secure second spot ahead of Ulsterman Phil O’Brien (Aermacchi)…Young’s chance of a win evaporated when last year’s winner, the Czech Bohumil Stasa (CZ) slipped past into the lead just before the finish…The gearbox of Helmut Fath’s four-cylinder Urs failed in the last practice session and he arranged to use the gears from Hoppe’s Urs. So the organisers obligingly leapfrogged the sidecar race over the 250 and 350cc races to last on the programme to give the world champion a chance to fit the replacements. Fath repaid by a dazzling play of speed, shaking off ex-champ Klaus Enders (BMW) to win easily…with the rest of the field trailing far behind.”\n\nHERE’S AN OBSCURE TITBIT of motor cycling trivia: the first examples of the BSA Rocket 3 and the Triumph Trident were both bought by George Lazenby, who played James Bond in On Her Majesty’s Secret Service. Fearing for their star’s safety producers Harry Saltzman and Cubby Broccoli reportedly confiscated both triples during shooting. Lazenby said: “People think motor bikes are dangerous but, quite frankly, I’d rather be on one than on a gorse. I’m in full control of the brakes and engine. But if a horse decides to go wild, there is nothing I can do about it.”\n\n“TRADITIONAL FLYING-BANANA LOOK of MZ roadsters (tank and headlamp shell styled in one) is abandoned in this new version of the East German MZ ISDT-bred two-fifty. The bulbous tank is recessed for the rider’s knees. and, replacing the pivoted front fork, a gaitered telescopic fork carries a conventional headlamp. Chain enclosure and light-alloy rims are retained and the engine is tuned to give 21bhp at 5,200-5,500rpm, tested with air filter, silencer and all accessories. A 243cc two-stroke single, it has a bore and stroke of 69x65mm and compression ratio of 10 to 1. The claimed maximum speed is approximately 80mph. First importers of MZ road machines, not previously available in Britain, are to be Green Motorcycles Ltd, of 369 Abbeydale Road, Sheffield, 7. A limited quantity of ES150 models will be imported at first, followed by the new ETS 250. The two-fifty will cost less than £300.”\n\n“SINCE JUST AFTER THE WAR, former wall-of-death Herbert ‘Speedy’ Brooker has yearned to own one of the mighty 750cc Zundapp sidecar outfits which acted as mobile gun posts for Rommel and the Afrika Corps’ thrusts across the desert against the Eighth Army. Speedy, who barnstormed around the country fairs with a 1924 Indian after the war…a few months ago the 20-year search was over. The son of a former Luftwaffe officer wrote to Herbert and offered him a complete machine. Now the Clacton, Essex enthusiast is rebuilding the BMW-like twin to its former glory…The half-ton monster is 7ft long and was built to carry two gunners. It has eight forward gears and four reverse speeds. Brake operation is a combination of hydraulic and mechanical systems. The engine drives to the rear wheel and sidecar wheel via a differential.”\n\n“THE TOP TWO PLACED machines in the Welsh Three-Day Trial give the widest possible variation in ISDT-type bikes. Scott Ellis’ winning 125cc Dalesman Puch is a spindly ultra-light model with a highly stressed engine giving fantastic performance for its size. The second-placed 504cc Triumph of Six Days veteran Ken Heanes is a traditionally British ISDT machine relying on a big Beefy engine to provide the last word in reliability and counter the weight handicap…Search parties were sent out from Trial headquarters in Llandrindod Well, Rads to try and fine Surbiton rider Roy Smith, lost somewhere on the bleak mountains during a storm…As the section on which he had stopped was not approachable by a normal road vehicle, forest rangers were called out to join the search parties which included competitors and Mid-Wales officials. Smith was eventually found 11 hours after he had stopped, huddled in a forest hut, down to his last cigarette and barley-sugar sweet.”\n\nA DOZEN NEW 455CC FIVE-SPEED Ducati singles are to be imported by Vic Camp. Basically an over-bored three-fifty, the 86x75mm engine has desmodromic valve gear and a compression ratio of 9.3 to 1. Peak-power revs are 6,500rpm and the claimed to speed is 113mph. The new model, Ducati’s biggest ever single, which shares the frame and cycle parts of the 250 and 350cc bikes, tips the scales at only 287lb.\n\n“VANDALS TORE UP COBBLESTONES at the top of the West Leeds Club’s freak climb, Post Hill, shortly before Sunday’s open-to-centre scramble. Now club officials have cemented the stones back in an attempt to make the famous old one-in-two hill vandal-proof.”\n\n“SHATTERED RECORDS…SUSPECTED SABOTAGE…searing pace…a surprise exclusion—the Saturday and Monday TT races had all the action, drama and excitement the crowds could want…Confounding the cynics, West Germany’s Siegfried Schauzu romped away with the winner’s laurels in Saturday’s 750cc Sidecar TT—twice in 16 hours! They said he had been lucky to win the 1967 and 1968 500cc Sidecar TTs, taking over after others had retired. But this time, ‘Sideways Sid’ left no room for doubt. He led the three-lap race for every one of its 113.2 miles to notch a new race record of 89.83mph—0.72mph faster than Chris Vincent’s 1968 lap record with a 650cc BSA. After that, no one questioned that Schauzu had earned his victory—until the ACU disqualified him! They said he had failed to stop his engine when, goggles smothered with dead flies, he and passenger Horst Schneider had picked up fresh pairs at their pit as they started the final lap.” He appealed, the ACU accepted that “there was insufficient evidence that he had kept his engine running” so he was reinstated. Chris Vincent’s Beeza stopped with transmission problems on the last lap but Peter Brown was runner-up his 750cc BSA twin ahead of Bill Currie on a 650cc Triumph. “A newcomer, he was aiming only to\n\nfinish and had not arranged for signals so he was astonished to be ushered into the winners’ enclosure…Of the 69 starters, only 33 went the full distance…Klaus Enders beat his Isle of Man jinx—and suspected sabotage—to win the 500cc Sidecar TT. Foiled by a broken con-rod with four miles to go last year, he led all the way this time to notch a race record of 92.48mph…He won despite being forced to strip and rebuild his BMW’s engine on the eve of the race when he and Georg Auerbacher both found sand or something similar in their combustion chambers…Enders’ mechanic Dieter Busch said: ‘Someone put abrasive powder in the carburettor intake. It was sucked into the engine and scoured a piston.’ Auerbacher’s engine was more extensively damaged. He alleged that a sparking plug had been removed and the powder poured in…As a result, both had to weigh in late, but Auerbacher was less fortunate than Enders. Lying third for a time, he stopped briefly on the first lap and then retired on the second, suspecting dirt in his BMW’s fuel line. As expected, the race was completely dominated by West Germans. Early challenger to Enders was Helmut Fath on his home-built four-cylinder Urs. But as the race progressed so his pace slackened, letting 750cc winner Siegfried Schauzu (BMW) into second place. Enders reported a trouble-free race, but criticised the course: ‘Every year it gets bumpier. This year it was very bad in Ramsey, but I am happy to have won at last.’…On a factory four-cylinder Benelli, offered to him during practice week, Australian Kel Carruthers led the Lightweight 250cc TT virtually all the way. It was his first TT win and Benelli’s first success in the Isle of Man since Dario Ambrosini won the 250cc race 19 years ago…Carruthers set the\n\nfastest lap at 99.01mph and averaged 95.95mph for the six-lap, 226.4-mile race…For the first three laps…there was a tremendous dice between Carruthers and Phil Read, also on a works Benelli, and Rod Gould, on his rather special Yamaha.” Gould’s juicy Yam ran dry on lap three; Read’s Benelli let him down at the end of lap five. This left Frank Perris as runner-up on a Crooks Suzuki with Santiago Herrero third on an Ossa. “Without any serious opposition, Giacomo Agostini had only to stay aboard his MV three to canter away with the Junior TT for the second successive year. And that was just the problem. Staying aboard was dead tricky because of molten tar on many sections of the Mountain lap. And the unusually hot day reduced the damping of his rear suspension units. Ago thought they, and not the tar, were the cause of many hectic moments on the opening lap. So he eased off and his winning average of 101.81mph was nearly 3mph slower than the record he set last year. From eighth on the opening lap, Belfast’s Brian Steenson (Aermacchi) benefited from a swarm of retirements until, on the last lap, he snatched second place from Jack Findlay (Aermacchi). Of the eight TR2 Yamahas which started, only two survived to finish in the first dozen and of the 53\n\nfinishers out of 100 starters, the vast majority were four-strokes. The flaming sunshine took an inordinately heavy toll of the two-strokes. The manufacturers’ team prize went to the Seeley trio—Tom Dickie, Steve Jolly and Mick Andrew. Obviously enjoying himself, the Duke of Edinburgh was introduced to the riders on the front ranks of the grid before the off…Prince Phillip heard the cheer as Alan Barnett (Kirby Metisse) out-accelerated Giacomo Agostini’s MV three in the opening 200 yards. Then Ago was gone, on the headlong dash to Ballacraine…Twice topping the ton lap, and hoisting the race average to a new high at 99.99mph, Welsh ace Malcolm Uphill blasted his works-entered Triumph Bonneville to an all-the-way victory in the 750cc section of the Production Machine TT. Though troubled by unwanted neutrals when changing down on the first of his three laps, Paul Smart (Norton Commando) improved his timings each time round to run home second, 25.8sec astern of Uphill. Third place went to consistent Darryl Pendleberry on another Triumph. Overshadowed by the bigger machines the five-hundreds and two-fifties fought their own battles—and provided the drama. Leader of the 500cc class during the opening lap, Tony Dunnell crashed his whispering three-cylinder Kawasaki through the fencing at the 33rd Milestone on lap two, collecting facial injuries and a broken arm; that left Graham Penny on a Honda CB450 to get home ahead of last year’s 500cc winner, Ray Knight (Triumph Daytona). Main upsets came in the two-fifty section. There was a fresh leader on each lap. First time round it was Charles Mortimer ahead, but his Ducati was to suffer a whole catalogue of misfortunes before he eventually finished third. Then\n\nJohn Williams (Honda) took over, only to run out of petrol and push in from Hillbery for 10th and last in the class. So in the end it was a very surprised Mike Rogers on his four-year-old Mach 1 Ducati who gained the 250cc laurels. He had not seen leader Williams drop out and no idea of his placing until waving programmes gave him the clue…There was nothing unexpected about Dave Simmonds’ fine win in the Lightweight 125cc TT. He and his Kawasaki disc-valve twin, on loan from the factory, had led the practice leaderboard. In the race, he was out front from flagfall throughout the three laps, finally finishing nearly six minutes in front of Aussie Kel Carruthers (Aermacchi). With no one to push him, Simmonds’ 91.08mph average and fastest lap at 92.46mph were well down on the records made last year—99.12mph for the race by Phil Read (Yamaha) and 100.32mph for the lap by Bill Ivy, also on a Yamaha. (However Simmonds could not afford to nurse his water-cooled eight-speed engine, for unless it was buzzing in the 12-14,000rpm power band it was prone to oil a plug). The real drama came more than three hours after the race was finished. Fred Launchbury, the 37-year-old Raynes Park, London dealer, rode the race of his life to run home third on his Bultaco, but when the engine was stripped for measuring it was found to be 1.2cc over 125cc! The clerk of the course had no option but to exclude him and\n\naward third spot to the smallest rider on the island, Gary Dickinson (Honda). Said Launchbury afterwards: ‘Because of seizures I had to rebore the barrel to 0.010in oversize and fit a stock piston. It never occurred to me to calculate the capacity. I assumed it would still be within the limit as the standard capacity is 124.88cc.’ As in the other races of the week the retirement rate was highish and only 25 of the 46 starters finished.” (Among them, in 22nd place, was Rodney Gooch on a BSA Bantam, ahead of two Hondas, a Bultaco and a Kawasaki)…”‘Forza Ago’ proclaimed the cup-final-style banner waved aloft by a group of excited Italian enthusiasts as Giacomo Agostini crossed the line on a three-cylinder MV Agusta to win the Senior TT. The reigning world champion had little need of encouragement from his supporters. The ultra-reliable MV being by far the fastest bike in the race he able almost to cruise to victory. Minutes after finishing the six-lap 226-mile race he admitted with a smile: ‘I did not go fast today. It was not necessary.’ This was the dashing Italian’s fifth TT victory and it completed his second Junior-Senior double in succession—a feat previously achieved by only two legendary racing characters, Stanley Woods and John Surtees. The winning average of 104.75mph was within 1mph of the record set two years ago by Mike Hailwood (Honda) while fighting a desperate duel with Agostini, which\n\nended only when the Italian’s chain broke on the fifth lap. But while Agostini’s win was the biggest certainty in TT racing since the days of John Surtees, the battle for the places behind the Italian maestro were tremendous. With a sizzling lap of 100.03mph, just a fifth of a second inside the magic ton-up figure, Alan Barnett consolidated second place on lap two. And, on the special Tom Kirby-prepared Matchless-powered Metisse, the 25-year-old Iver mechanic gauged his place like a veteran and held the place to the finish. Runner-up to Giacomo Agostini with the only single-cylinder lap of the race at over a ton, Alan Barnett might be expected to be reasonably pleased with his performance in the Senior TT. Not so this rider of Tom Kirby’s immaculate scarlet-and-white Metisse racers. ‘With its engine lower and farther forward, the new-style Metisse handles so much better than the one I raced last year that I was confident I could beat any time I’d done then,’ he says. ‘In practice for the 1968 TT I lapped at just over the 100 mark, so I was aiming for 102 this year. But unfortunately, the engine was just a little off song and things didn’t work out the way I’d hopped.’ Behind Barnett the 1966 Senior Manx GP winner, Tom Dickie, on a Gus Kuhn Seeley, fought out a terrific duel with Isle of Man specialist Derek Woodman on another Seeley, one of three in the race fitted with the new extra-long megaphone. Both lapped at over 99mph and only 7sec separated them at Ballaugh halfway round the last lap. But brake trouble was slowing Woodman, and Dickie clinched third place. This, combined with his fourth in the Junior, won him the Joe Craig Trophy for the most successful rider on British machines.”\n\nMOTOR CYCLE’S PEERLESS TECHNICAL EDITOR Vic Willoughby wrote a two-part technical review of the TT machinery, including a review of the 350cc Jawa V4 two stroke: “When Honda quit racing 18 months ago, the Senior and Junior four-valve MV threes were left without serious opposition, and there has been no apparent development in them. In cool air, the 347cc (56x47mm) engine gives 68bhp at 14-15,000rpm, though race-chief Arturo Magni estimated that the hot weather of Junior race day took 4bhp off the peak. For the 489cc (62x54mm) engine, peak power is about 85bhp at 12,500rpm. In the 125 and 250cc classes, however, Honda’s withdrawal at first left the Yamaha two-stroke vs four-stroke battle that had raged so fiercely for years on a purely technical front. Yamaha’s subsequent withdrawal, at the end of last season, left the four-stroke Benelli four as the best two-fifty on the Island. And, though Derek Woodman’s MZ and Rod Gould’s private Yamaha TD2 beat it for speed, Benelli are sitting pretty. They won in spite of their better bike, Phil Read’s four-valver, being below par from the start; and they hope to have their much lighter and more potent air-cooled V8s raceworthy for 1970. There are signs, however, of a revival of the struggle between four-stroke and two-stroke—and in the 350cc class at that. For though it failed to survive its first TT practice lap, the new Jawa V4 was timed at 143mph past the Highlander while far from full out, and that compares well with Agostini’s 150mph in the Junior race. Given thorough development and the right rider, the Jawa could well challenge the MV three and Benelli eight in the 350cc class…top speed is little short of 160mph and the engine is already giving 70-74bhp at 13,000rpm. Translated into bhp/litre/1,000rpm, an excellent measure of breathing and burning efficiency, this works out at about 16. And good though that is, it shows scope for improvement, for MZ, past-masters at efficiency, have passed the 20 mark in their 125cc single and 250cc twin. The Jawa four promises to make its mark soon on the faster circuits. Slimmed, lightened and piloted by a world-class jockey, it could be so competitive all round as to send the four-stroke designers scurrying back to their drawing boards.” Some years later I was in the Island covering the road riding events that were held on non-race days, and serving as a gopher during race days. As always Motor Cycle (by now renamed Motor Cycle Weekly) was based in the Sefton on Douglas Prom; I was billeted with Vic. After the first night he pointed out, not unkindly, that he had a busy week ahead of him and needed his beauty sleep, which he was denied by my snoring. I spent the rest of the week sleeping in the bath. Happy days—Ed.\n\nGREEVES DIRECTOR BURT GREEVES broke a collarbone and three ribs during the TT, and he wasn’t racing. Greeves was en route to Ballacraine to watch the racing when his combo, powered by one of his factory’s 360cc moto-cross engines, was involved in a collision with a car.\n\n“HOPES OF NEW FINANCIAL BACKING for motor cycling and other sports on the Isle of Man were dashed last week by the Island’s Legislative Council. They rejected a proposal already approved by the House of Keys to use money from a betting-shops tax to subsidise sport.”\n\nNOT EVERY TT ENTRANT rode an exotic racer. Godfrey Benson’s Suzuki Super Six completed the 250cc Production TT and was quick enough to earn him a Bronze replica. It cost him £70 and had covered 21,000 miles with four previous owners, two of whom used it to pass their L-test. The only race preparation was the fitting of a new piston.\n\n“OUR DICTIONARIES AREN’T ALWAYS so out of date as you might suppose. Take the word gear, for instance. According to my dictionary, one definition is ‘whatever is prepared for wear, hence dress or ornaments’ and that derives from the Anglo-Saxon gearwe, meaning habiliments or equipment.”\n\n“AS A LONG TIME READER of Motor Cycle in both magazine and newspaper format, I welcome anything that helps to balance the racing reports and pictures that nowadays fill the issues. I cannot help thinking that all your readers must be either racers or want their mounts to seem as if they were. Those of us who have an interest in all things connected with motor cycling now have to look elsewhere to obtain an overall picture. If we are to have only news and reports, then at least let us have all the news that affects us. There was not a mention of the weekend at the seaside resorts when, apparently, the last of the rockers were on the rampage, yet I imagine that rockers also read Motor Cycle. Because it’s nasty and detrimental to our image does not mean it isn’t news. If certain places are good to keep away from, then this is news as well. Similarly, certain disgraceful incidents at the Brighton Show were swept under the carpet. I am firmly of the opinion that the motor cyclist wants to know everything that’s going on which may affect him, his sport, his image, and to see both sides of the coin. If there is a nasty smell, simply ignoring it won’t make it go away.\n\nJohn A Neave, London W10.”\n\n“I WAS THOROUGHLY revolted by the bike-riding hooligans at the Brighton Show who were decked out in imitation Nazi helmets and insignia. Even so long after the war there are plenty of people for whom such tasteless aping will evoke painful and unpleasant memories. I don’t blame the clods who wear this stuff with such satisfaction; they probably know no better. But whatever organisation is selling it should be put out of business as soon as possible.\n\nD Harvey, Eastbourne, Sussex.”\n\n“AFTER READING THE PUBLICITY given recently to ‘swastika-bedecked thugs’ I should like to express my utter disgust at the childish attitude which some motor cyclists display on the subject. I should have thought that after the idiotic mods-and-rockers era, there would have been a little more give and take over the dress of motor cyclists…people have the right to dress exactly as they see fit. I’m no Hell’s Angel on a chopper; I’m a rocker on my idea of transport, and I like to be left alone to live my way, not someone else’s.\n\nNorman Reed, Brundall, Norfolk.”\n\n“NOW THAT A NATIONAL NEWSPAPER has carried a full-page article on the Hell’s Angels I am sure thousands of its readers will equate all motor cyclists with the immature people depicted in the feature. As motor cyclists we are by now cynical about our public image, but it is beyond a joke to be labelled as Nazis, perverts and mentally-retarded exhibitionists.”\n\nJohn Best, Springfield, Essex.\n\n“I’D LIKE TO EXTEND a warm welcome to Bill Shergold, who recently made the move from Paddington to St Bartholomew’s, Dover.

After all, everything they make is for the Americans. All we can hope for are the bits left over from the export market. I bought a BSA because I thought it would be easy to maintain with such a large dealer network. But what do I find? Agents show me parts order forms sent to Small Heath six months previously and still not honoured. Now, to crown it all, I am told there is no longer an exchange service for BSA units.

Runner-up, just a lap behind the Triumph, was a 250cc Bultaco ridden by Juan Bordons and Benjamin Grau.

The 125 class was won by Frenchman Hubert Auriol on a Yamaha. Top of the 250s was a Spanish Ossa ridden by Spaniard Santiago Herrero. Not surprisingly the 500 winner was Giacomo Agostini on his MV Agusta, both Italian, of course. And equally unsurprisingly, sidecar honours went to German ace Helmut Fath on his URS.\n\nMOTOR CYCLE EDITOR HARRY LOUIS was not best pleased with the Beeb: “In the past three months or so, the BBC seem to have gone out of their way to ruffle our feathers. We had that episode in The First Lady series which rehashed all the old rubbish about rockers. Then, a few days later, came another showing on the rocker theme in a 24 Hours programme. Next, Edward Wilson, on behalf of motor-cycle manufacturers, felt obliged to protest to the BBC about the preparation of a documentary film on—yes, rockers! Now we come right up to date. To the time given to the TT on television and radio…it was absurdly inadequate. What goes on the ivory tower of the BBC? There seems to be plenty of programme time for publicising the antics of a tiny and objectionable proportion of the motor cycling community but next to none for the magnificent sport to be see in the Isle of Man…It is manifestly unfair to give a distorted impression of motor cyclists by featuring rockers, and equally unfair to provide such scant coverage of the TT races.” Columnist Nitor also had his say: “I go all the way with those fans who berate the TV people for their miserable coverage of the TT. The brutal truth, I suspect, is that the motor cycling is not a sport followed by the Best People. You think I exaggerate? Very well—go to your local library and get down that weighty tome, Who’s Who. Moss, Stirling, who didn’t win a world championship in his entire career and hasn’t raced for seven years rates no further than 62 lines. Hailwood, Stanley Michael Bailey, nine times a world champion and Britain’s greatest racing motor cyclist of all time, is not even mentioned!”\n\n“PRICE OF THE FRENCH VELOSOLEX moped has been cut by the importers, Motorised Cycles Ltd, to £39 10s, including purchase tax.

Previously this was unobtainable at any price, despite Transport Minister Richard Marsh’s intention to make such cover obligatory…British Motorcyclists’ Federation secretary Jack Wiley said: ‘Our worst fears are confirmed. These premiums are excessively high for the average motor cyclist.’ And at the BMF annual meeting delegates from the 82 member clubs called for an early meeting with the British Insurance Association to ask for lower rates.”\n\n“THE MODERN MOTOR CYCLIST is fast becoming akin to the car driver, and rides without even a plug-spanner in his tool kit.

He will be riding a pre-1960 bike with character. He will have with him a complete set of spanners, spare inner tube, plugs, files, grinding paste, spring links of all sizes, string, wire and a tow rope.

The other members of the three-man team, Sergeant Len Farmer and Inspector Alec Smith, both on 650cc Saints, scored 385 and 471. Outright individual winner was Vega Carmoa (230 Ossa).”\n\n“A FIVE-HOUR RIOT by drunken youths who invaded the normally peaceful town of Assen, headquarters of the Dutch TT, on the eve of Saturday’s races, was finally quelled at four in the morning after the police had made 80 arrests…they finally won control after mounted police and tear gas had been used.”\n\n“RIDING THE FOUR-CYLINDER JAWA with typical verve and dash, Bill Ivy gave Giacomo Agostini and his MV Agusta a real run for their money in the 350cc class of the Dutch TT…Urged on by a record crowd of over 150,000, Ivy hurled the Czech two-stroke around the magnificent 4.8-mile circuit to such good effect that he caught and passed the Italian world champion at the end of the first lap. He clung to the lead for two laps. Then the Jawa started to misfire slightly on one cylinder. Agostini regained first lead and pulled away. The dice seemed to be over. But the Jawa chimed back on to four pots and was in business again. With the bike flying, Ivy whittled Agostini’s lead away and gaining 100 yards a lap, flashed into the lead on lap 12. Agostini, in trouble with cramp in his throttle wrist, looked a beaten man as Ivy drew away. Not for long, though. The Jawa ignition system played tricks again and, back on three cylinders, Ivy had no\n\nanswer as Agostini, with a record lap at 91.38mph, regained the lead and went on to win. Agostini’s task in the 500cc class was very much easier. In fact, the fastest lap of the whole day was his 350cc round when chasing the Jawa! It was a good meeting for Italy, for Renzo Pasolini (Benelli) recovered from his broken collarbone, scored a fine win in the 250cc race, his first world-championship success of the year. But Rod Gould and his Yamaha gave the Italian bikes a run when he led the race for the first six laps with Pasolini and Yamaha new-boy Kel Carruthers screaming in hot pursuit. Then Gould’s luck, which had deserted him when he was holding third place in the 350cc race with just over a lap to go, let him down again. After a pit stop to change a plug, he eventually finished fourth behind Santiago Herrero (Ossa), who holds his league in the 250cc title table. British riders dominated the lightweight classes, with Dave Simmonds (Kawasaki) scoring his third 125cc classic win of the year and Australian Barry Smith outpacing the strong Dutch contingent to finish first in the 50cc race on a Derbi.”\n\n“RIDING A BRACE OF SPECIALLY PREPARED Moto-Guzzi V-twins on the banked circuit at Monza, three Italians established three world records in the 1,000cc class and another three in the 750cc. For the larger class, the machine was basically a 757cc (83x77mm) Ambassador. On it, Remo Venturi, one-time second string to John Surtees on MVs, pushed the 10km record to 129.45mph before quitting as a result of rear-tyre chunking. The bike was then taken over by hill-climb champion Angelo Tenconi, who set a 100km record at 129.65mph and put 130.22 miles into the hour. The previous 1,000cc records were: 10km at 118.64mph by Bert Le Vack (Brough Superior-JAP) in September 1929; 100km at 111.26mph by Joe Wright (Zenith-JAP) in July 1929; 101.98mph in an hour by Claude Temple (OEC-Temple) in September 1925. Machine for the 750cc records was a 740cc (82x70mm) V7 ridden by Vittorio Brambilla, younger brother of Ferrari racing driver Ernesto. Vittorio also experienced tyre chunking but managed to break Rex Butcher’s 10km, 100km and one-hour records, set on a Dunstall Norton two years ago. After lunch, however, Brambilla’s machine was fitted with a Dunlop racing rear tyre and he improved his figure to 125.95mph (100km) and 133.26 miles (one hour). Butcher’s figures were 120.78mph, 126.88mph and 126.75 miles respectively.”\n\n“THERE IS A GRAND OLD PIECE of motor cycling folklore we’ll call the Maximum Cruising Speed Myth. An irrefutable law of nature is supposed to declare that id you exceed more than Xmph for Y miles your engine is doomed to catastrophic blow-up. This is a lot of baloney. A modern engine of any capacity, provided it is in sound condition, properly run-in and efficiently maintained, should be able to hold full-throttle rpm from one end of our longest motorway to the other. Like all good folklore, the cruising myth has a basis of fact. In bygone times, when material standards were inferior and design far less scientific, it was truth indeed. As a safeguard against over-driving, designers would push the low frequency vibration period up to the top end of the rpm scale. It was too darn uncomfortable to hold full throttle for anything but short periods!”\n\nPETER WILLIAMS, RUNNER-UP in the 1967 TT, was promoted from the Norton-Matchless drawing office to run a new road-racing department.\n\nTHE PRICE OF REFRESHMENTS IN the growing network of motorway service station was scrutinised by a parliamentary committee. When a Transport Ministry mandarin appeared before the MPs he produced a British Rail buffet menu and pointed out the motorway prices were lower. A committee member retorted: “Sir, you are comparing the outrageous with the ridiculous.”\n\n“TAKING THE LEAD within the first few minutes, a prototype 360cc Bultaco completely dominated the world’s toughest road race, the international 24-hour event on the tortuous Montjuich park circuit in Barcelona…Brilliantly ridden by Salvador Canellas and Carlos Rocamora, the Spanish two-stroke averaged 67.48mph, beating the previous record by 22 laps of the sinuous 2.3-mile circuit. Equalling the old record, the works 650cc Triumph Bonneville shared by Malcolm Uphill and Steve Jolly finished second, four laps ahead of the Spanish-crewed Ossa which won the 250cc class.”\n\nA RIDER PASSING THROUGH EDENBRIDGE, Kent was charged with speeding on the evidence of two bobbies on foot patrol who estimated his speed at 50mph in a 30mph limit although it was dark and the street lighting was “not very good”. The rider’s brief told the cops they were “scraping the bottom of the barrel”. Case dismissed.\n\n“HAVE AT YOU, LORD ROLLO! Honda owner the Earl of Denbigh lurks inside this medieval-looking American helmet. He is sure he is the first British motor cyclist to adopt the dramatic headgear familiar from Stateside racing. The helmet is a Bell-Toptex Star model…We are told the interior of the plastic face screen is free from draughts and misting, thanks to cleverly contrived face padding.”\n\n“WHO THOUGHT UP THE FIRST dolphin fairing?” Nitor wondered. “As we all know, roadracers in the early 1950s got this particular ball rolling in a big way, but leafing through our bound volumes the other day I turned up a proposal for a roadster fairing, dated 6 October 1938, under the title ‘Luxury of Necessity?’ It was an advanced conception. The author, JK Carter, prophetically saw that the handlebar-attached screen had its limitations. So he proposed a neat half-fairing ‘mounted on a frame, supported above the tank, with room for the handlebar to swing beneath’. His windscreen looks surprisingly modern. ‘Shape is more important than mere size,’ Carter went on, and it would be easily moulded from one of the new transparent materials used on aeroplanes.’ Well, two decades went by before the development of glass-fibre made stylish and inexpensive frontal fairings a commercial proposition. What’s more, we are still waiting for the fulfilment of one concept in this 31-year-old pipe dream—the twin headlamps.”\n\nBUCKINGHAMSHIRE’S FARNHAM ROYAL CLUB are the country’s first local club to train successfully 1,000 learner riders in the RAC-ACU Training Scheme…a record reached only by the Crystal Palace scheme, organised by RAC headquarters, some years ago.”\n\nTHREE DUTCH ROAD RACERS were interviewed by the cops following the theft of a 50cc Suzuki racing engine from the national motor museum at Leidsendam. It was alleged that they had and tried to sell it to the Kreidler sponsor, Van Veen Imports.\n\nBILL IVY WAS KILLED during practice for the East German Grand Prix when his Jawa V4 two-stroke seized. He slid into a concrete post that lacked straw-bale protection; witnesses said his helmet came off just before the accident. Before the start of the 350cc race at the Sachsenring 200,000 spectators stood in silence as a wreath was laid on Ivy’s vacant place on the grid. Dave Simmonds clinched the 125cc world championship on his ‘semi-works’ Kawasaki twin; his fifth GP win in seven outings gave him an unassailable lead. Giacomo Agostini rode his MV Agusta triple to victory in the 500cc class, winning his fourth successive world championship and equalling Mike Hailwood’s record. Following a race-long duel Santiago Herrero (Ossa) snatched a last-lap 250cc win from Renzo Pasolini (Benelli). The 50cc race was also a nail-biter, with Angel Nieto (Derbi) pulling ahead of Herrero (Derbi) on the last lap. They were followed over the line by a trio of Kreidlers. No-one was surprised when Agostini’s MV was first past the flag in the 350cc class; Rod Gould was runner-up on his Yamaha; Heinz Rosner pleased the home crowd with third place on an MZ.\n\n“DESPITE COMPLAINTS LAST YEAR and an FIM request that competitors be given at least a month’s notice, many who applied to ride in the East German Grand Prix were not told until eight days before the meeting whether or not their entries had been accepted…Bultaco works rider Ginger Molloy, fourth in the 350cc class at the Sachsenring last year, applied weeks ago. But it was only at the Belgian that he received a cable saying he had not been accepted this year….So what about it FIM? The East Germans have ignored your plea and they should be disciplined.”\n\n“WORLD 500CC MOTO-CROSS CHAMPION for the past three years, East German Paul Friedrichs (380 CZ) finally broke his duck in this year’s title series when he won his first 1969 classic, the seventh-round West German GP. In a tense and dramatic meeting, Friedrichs won overall by only two seconds from Sweden’s Bengt Aberg (400 Husqvarna) after twice stopping in the second leg to straighten a bent gear lever. BSA team leader John Banks, who took the championship lead at the last round, in Russia, was right out of luck on the twisty Beuern circuit, 60 miles from Frankfurt. He suffered ignition problems during the first race and, failing to score overall, was ousted from the head of the table by Aberg, the former leader.”\n\n“OVER 250 RIDERS FROM AN ORIGINAL entry of 566 tied for first place with 668 maximum marks in the ACU 24-hour National Rally, which ended at Stoke-on-Trent’s Trentham Gardens pleasure centre on Sunday morning. After the 600-mile road run, with each mile counting for a bonus point and each control visited adding two more marks, ties were settled by an 11-mile timed section over the south Pennine hills. Riders were told to average exactly 22.5mph and overall winner Metropolitan policeman Jack Chatfield (500 Triumph) was only 0.8sec out. Among the class winners was one-legged Yorkshireman Brian Atkinson, who took the 250cc three-wheeler award with his Invacar…There were only 71 checkpoints compared with 85 last year but there was no lack of enthusiasm. Alec Furness of the Buxton Club, manned his windy hilltop control almost single-handed for nearly 24 hours non-stop. With a weekend of perfect weather and some of the most enthusiastic motor cyclists in Britain competing, it was little wonder that there were few stories of breakdowns. Best club team, Birmingham Scooter; runner up, Wessex Norton Owners; third, Midland Triumph OC; fourth, Coventry Antelope MCC.”\n\nWHEN BMF NATIONAL COMMITTEE member Patrick Howell asked his insurer fir a quote on unlimited liability passenger cover for his bike and car the price demanded was £120. All of Howell’s insurance was handled through a single underwriter; he suggested they think again or he would transfer his business elsewhere. A revised quote duly arrived: three quid.\n\nON THE SUBJECT OF INSURANCE, there was a real problem with bikes and scooters in urban areas being vandalised. Motor Cycle reported: “The overworked police shrug off vehicle vandals as just one of those things. Insurance companies gleefully fasten on the small print on the policy which excludes malicious damage unless the bike or car is stolen completely.”\n\n“AS USUAL, BRITISH RIDERS in the Stella Alpina rally made up the second-largest contingent after the 200-plus Italian home team. We had 42 rallyists present, beating the French by one body. Frequently, in overseas rallies, the second-biggest group is from Britain—at one recent continental get-together the UK contingent outnumbered the locals.”\n\n“BEARING AS IT DOES the badge of one of Italy’s most famous factories, the Moto Guzzi 125cc Sport has a high tradition of engineering excellence to maintain. This it does superbly. Throughout our test it behav"
