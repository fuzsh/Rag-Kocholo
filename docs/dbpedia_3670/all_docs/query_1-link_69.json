        "text": "I am currently a senior at McNary High School in Keizer, Oregon. I have a 4.0 GPA and am an active member of the National Honor Society. I have been playing sports since I was five years old. I currently play baseball and football for my high school, and I am looking to continue playing baseball in college.\n\nI have played baseball all of my life, and I am a very well-rounded ball player. Growing up, I was typically catching. After one year of club baseball, I discovered my love for the outfield. I love the challenge of diving for balls and making great catches. With the comradery in high school baseball and watching my cousin become a professional baseball player, I have found my passion and inspiration for the game.\n\nThe trait I value most about myself is my smarts for the game. I understand the mental element of baseball. Physically, Iâ€™m still growing stronger and faster. I continue to see big improvements in my arm and my swing as I continue to participate in high level hitting classes\n\nI am currently focused on my future goals as a college student. While looking for a quality education for my career, I have a strong desire to play baseball and be a part of a team."
