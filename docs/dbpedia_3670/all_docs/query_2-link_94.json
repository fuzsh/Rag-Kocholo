        "text": "BALTIMORE -- The Baltimore Orioles didn't get a base hit until the sixth inning in their 5-2 loss at the Toronto Blue Jays on Tuesday.\n\nJackson Holliday broke up a no-hitter with a home run in the top of the sixth, and the Orioles managed just three base hits.\n\nAlejandro Kirk gave the Blue Jays the lead with a three-run home run in their five-run bottom of the sixth inning.\n\nBaltimore (67-47) had the bases loaded in the top of the eighth with no outs and scored only one run on Austin Slater's RBI walk.\n\nRyan Mountcastle, Holliday and Eloy Jimenez had the Orioles' lone hits.\n\nStarting pitcher Albert Suarez, who took over after Grayson Rodriguez was scratched, allowed no runs on two base hits in five innings.\n\nGregory Soto gave up four runs in relief.\n\nThe teams resume the series at 7 p.m. on Wednesday. Trevor Rogers will make his second Orioles start."
