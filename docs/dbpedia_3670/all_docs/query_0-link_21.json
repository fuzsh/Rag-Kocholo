Joseph Edward Gadston. 1968-69.\n\nBorn, 13.9.1945, Hanwell.\n\n5’ 9”; 11 st 5 lbs.\n\nDébut: 17.8.68 v Walsall.\n\nCareer: Middlesex Schools; April 1961 West Ham United (amateur); August 1964 Brentford; 1966 Corby Town; 17.11.66 Cheltenham Town; May 1968 Bristol Rovers (£1,500) [10+1,5]; 5.11.69 Exeter City [85,31]; July 1972 Aldershot [2+2,0]; 2.2.73 Hartlepool United (loan) [1,0]; 1973 Wimbledon; 1975 Hillingdon Borough; 1976 Walton and Hersham; 1977 Slough Town; 1978 Hayes; 1979 Ruislip Manor (player-manager); 1980 Hanwell; 1993 Brentford (Football in the Community Officer); 1999 Exeter City (director); Swanage Town and Herston (general manager).\n\nScoring twice against Bournemouth in his third Rovers game, but injured against Crewe in his fourth, Joe Gadston had an impressive goals-to-games ratio at Eastville. An apprentice toolmaker and Ron Greenwood’s (1921-2006) first signing at West Ham, he scored regularly in the reserves at Griffin Park and represented a London Youth XI but, unable to break into Brentford’s League side, made his Cheltenham début in a 2-1 victory over Burton Albion and scored for fun at Whaddon Road. Player of the Year and top scorer in 1967-68, his 39 goals in 83 matches in all competitions included 32 in 71 Southern League outings. This tally included a Southern League hat-trick against Bath City in April 1967 as well as three goals past Cambridge City and four past Barnet in the spring of 1968. Thereafter he was in the Exeter side which opposed Rovers in the League Cup in August 1971 and his sole Hartlepool appearance was in the goalless draw at home to Chester in February 1973. The youngest of four children to Thomas Gadston and his wife Rose Osborne, who had married in 1931, he was a games coach in a sports centre in Southall between 1966 and 1968, trained as a Football association coach and could lay claim to an impressive career in non-league circles. Basing himself in Dorset, his business plans grew and he was recorded as investing £50,000 into OTR Ltd, a company set up to launch and operate St James’ Park for Exeter City; in January 2001 he introduced his former Brentford colleague Steve Perryman to Exeter, who managed the club to a narrow escape from dropping out of the Football League the following May and that November Gadston tabled a bid to buy out the Grecians. Living in Swanage and married to Maria, with a daughter from a previous marriage, Joe Gadston taught sport at Sunninghill Prep School in Dorchester until July 2014.\n\nNo 874. Rory Nicholas Gaffney. 2015-18.\n\nBorn, 23.10.1989, Tuam, County Galway, Republic of Ireland.\n\n6’; 12 st 4 lbs.\n\nDébut: 28.11.15 v Exeter City.\n\nCareer: 2009 Mervue United [53+6,13]; 30.7.11 Limerick (free) [76+9,28]; 25.11.14 Cambridge United (free) [3+3,2]; 26.11.15 Bristol Rovers (loan); 14.1.16 Bristol Rovers (undisclosed fee) [66+34,21]; 15.6.18 Salford City (£70,000) [33+12,11]; 31.8.19 Walsall (loan) [11+4,1]; 24.2.20 Shamrock Rovers (free) [42+17,13].\n\nJoining Rovers on a one-month loan in the build-up to Christmas 2015 was tall, ginger-haired goal-scorer Rory Gaffney. He started well, appearing lively and effective alongside Matty Taylor and having three shots on target well-saved by Exeter goalkeeper Bobby Olejnik on his first appearance. As Rovers form improved, the tall striker found his scoring boots, his two goals against both Orient and Luton Town over New Year setting Rovers up for a potential promotion push, before his mother club recalled him. Spurred on to sign the affable Irishman in the dash to promotion to League One, Rovers fought for his signature and Gaffney responded with a critical goal at home to Yeovil Town, as Rovers ended the campaign with promotion dramatically secured on goal difference. Armed with a first-class honours degree in Accountancy from the Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology and having made his League of Ireland First Division bow with Mervue United in a 1-0 home defeat against Athlone Town in March 2009, he had registered braces against Salthill Devon, Finn Harps and Wexford Youths before a high-profile move to Limerick, whom he helped secure promotion to the Irish Premier League in 2012, a season in which he was First Division Player of the Year. Gaffney’s spell at Limerick included a hat-trick in a 4-1 home victory over Bray Wanderers in August 2014, amongst his nineteen goals in 44(+6) Premier League appearances. He was Limerick’s top scorer in the 2014 season with fourteen goals. A foot injury prefaced his time at Cambridge and his League début came in September 2015 at the Abbey Stadium when, despite only playing the last nine minutes, he set up the only goal of the game against Stevenage. The following month, his first full start enabled him to score two first-half goals as Yeovil Town were defeated 3-2 at Huish Park and he played the final twenty minutes against Rovers the following weekend. Despite a slow goal-scoring start to 2016-17, his work-rate continued to impress and the popular striker was rewarded with a brace of goals as Crawley Town were defeated 4-2 after extra-time in a first round replay in November 2016. In the penultimate game of the season, he scored two late goals at Peterborough to become the fifth Rovers substitute to score a brace after coming on the field in a League fixture. Prior to the start of the 2017-18 campaign, Gaffney scored a hat-trick in Rovers’ 6-1 victory at Melksham Town. His eleven goals in 32(+11) Conference matches took unfashionable Salford City to the play-offs in 2019, where Gaffney appeared as a late substitute at Wembley, as City defeated Andy Bond’s Fylde side 3-0 in May 2019 to gain election to the Football League. However, he soon re-joined his former Rovers manager Darrell Clarke, to play for League Two Walsall, scoring a consolation goal in a defeat at Swindon in November 2019 before returning to Ireland, where he added a goal for Shamrock Rovers at Derry City in April 2021. He was in their side which lost in finals of the 2020 Football Association of Ireland Cup and 2021 Football Association of Ireland President’s Cup, but they secured their nineteenth consecutive league title in October 2021, the Irish Times (article by Gavin Cummiskey, 30 October 2021) crediting Gaffney’s close-range winning goal in a 1-0 victory at Sligo Rovers the previous month as being a pivotal moment in the successful campaign.\n\nNo 671. Kevin Alexander Gall. 2000-03.\n\nBorn, 4.2.1982, Merthyr.\n\n5’ 9”; 11 st 1 lb.\n\nDébut: 31.3.01 v Stoke City.\n\nCareer: Cardiff City; 1988 Newcastle United (professional, 1.8.00); 22.3.01 Bristol Rovers (free) [28+20,5]; 28.1.03 Yeovil Town (trial); 4.2.03 Yeovil Town (free) [90+44,26]; 1.6.06 Carlisle United (free) [54+12,9]; 28.1.08 Darlington (loan) [16+2,2]; 21.3.08 FC Toronto (loan); 28.7.08 Lincoln City (loan) [6+3,0]; 24.2.09 Port Vale (loan) [7,0]; 22.8.09 Darlington; 5.11.09 York City (loan); 22.1.10 York City (free); 28.6.10 Wrexham (free); 1.8.11 FC Dallas; 9.9.11 Workington; 12.10.11 Guiseley; 28.12.12 Stockport Sports.\n\nAmidst Rovers’ relegation to the basement division in the spring of 2001 was a bright ray of hope in the potential of young Welsh striker Kevin Gall. A début goal two minutes from time after coming on as a substitute at Stoke gave the first glimpse of his talent and the young striker continued to impress after Rovers had dropped a division. Impressive club form earned a first Welsh Under-21 cap against Norway in Drammen in September 2001 and he scored from eight yards in a 1-0 win in Azerbaijan in November 2002, the Welsh Under-21 side’s first victory in five-and-a-half years. When they lost 8-1 to Italy in Parma in September 2003, their side included not just Gall, but also future Rovers players in Matt Somner and David Pipe. Kevin Gall, who scored once in his eight caps at that level, had scored twice in 3(+1) games for Newcastle reserves, including a spectacular scissor-kick goal, as a substitute to convert a losing position into a 3-2 victory over local rivals Sunderland and he scored in a 4-1 victory over Blue Star in the Northumberland Senior Cup Final of 2001. He was to contribute a hat-trick in Yeovil’s friendly against Torquay and help the Huish Park side score 100 goals to become Conference champions in 2002-03, seventeen points clear of Morecambe, and secure their Football League status. Prior to the following League campaign, Gall scored after just 28 seconds as Brighton were defeated at Huish Park in a pre-season friendly. Gall scored Yeovil’s first ever League goal, played in the first League meeting with Rovers, as Rovers lost 1-0 to ten-man opposition over Christmas 2003 and was Yeovil’s joint top scorer in their inaugural League campaign. Yeovil secured promotion to League One in 2004-05 before Gall played against Rovers in a Carlisle shirt. There followed spells in North American football, suffering the loss of League status with Darlington and playing alongside Scott Shearer and Gareth Taylor at Wrexham, before a Workington début in the 3-0 home defeat against Hyde and a Guiseley début, alongside Ciarán Toner and Nathan Ellington’s brother Lee, in a 2-0 victory over the same opposition. He played in 0(+4) Conference games for York, scoring once, 3(+2) matches with Wrexham, 1(+3) times at Workington and in 4(+1) fixtures at Guiseley. Engaged to Kirstie Davies, Kevin Gall lives in Manchester, where he runs Academy Soccer, which is backed by every League club in England. He has endured over forty hours of tattooing with religious symbols over both arms, testimony to his Christianity to which he converted after the suicide of three friends in Merthyr.\n\nNo 239. Robert Gardiner. 1937-39.\n\nBorn​, 2.9.1912, Dundee.\n\nDied, April 1993, Dundee.\n\n5’ 4”; 10 st 4 lbs.\n\nDébut: 28.8.37 v Watford.\n\nCareer: Elmwood; Dundee East Craigie; 1933 Broughty Ferry Ex-Servicemen; 3.1.34 Dundee United [77,35]; August 1936 Dartford; 14.7.37 Bristol Rovers (£1,500, later reduced to £250) [67,10]; October 1939 Dundee United; August 1940 Hibernian; September 1940 Morton; August 1941 Clyde [52,5]; 1942 Dundee United [82,29]; 1946 Union Sportive Valenciennes (player-coach); July 1947 Arbroath; 11.9.47 Brechin City.\n\nFor two years, and specifically in the 1935-36 season, “The Mighty Midgets” were greatly feared in Scottish domestic football. Arthur Milne (1914-97), the holder of one wartime cap for Scotland, and Bobby Gardiner both measured five-feet-four-inches, but their left-wing partnership helped Dundee United to great heights. Gardiner was second highest scorer at the club that season, with fifteen of the side’s 108 goals; United scored forty-two goals in the final six games that campaign, apparently a British record. The Scotsman reported that “the greater cohesion in the Dundee forward line could be traced to the constructive ability of Gardiner”, who scored twice for the club against St Bernard’s, Leith Athletic, Dumbarton and Edinburgh City, as well as in an 8-0 victory over Brechin City. On the day in April 1936 Joe Payne (1914-75) rattled in ten goals against Rovers, Gardiner scored once in Dundee United’s 12-1 victory over East Stirlingshire. A baker by trade, he was to give Rovers two seasons’ service, seven of his ten League goals coming away from home. He scored against the future England international goalkeeper Bert Williams (1920-2014) as Rovers lost 5-2 at Walsall in December 1937 but, despite forging a good understanding with Danny Tolland, was unable to prevent Rovers having to apply for re-election the following campaign for the only time in the club’s history. His six goals in 35 wartime games at Dundee United included that elusive hat-trick, as Milne scored four and Gardiner three in a 10-2 Scottish League East victory over Stenhousemuir in April 1940, his Hibernian début came against Queen’s Park at Easter Road that August, he scored twice as Morton defeated Albion Rovers 4-0 in October 1940 and the solitary goal in ten matches for Clyde was their second in a 2-2 draw with Airdrieonians at Shawfield in September 1941. Arguably the greatest game, though, was saved for wartime football, as he played in the Dundee United side which lost the 1940 Wartime Cup Final to a seventy-fifth-minute Rangers goal before a 75,000 crowd at Hampden Park.\n\nNo 70. James Richard Gardner. 1925-26.\n\nBorn, 29.7.1899, Peckham.\n\nDied, 7.10.1964, Felixstowe.\n\n5’ 6”; 11 st 2 lbs.\n\nDébut: 29.8.25 v Charlton Athletic.\n\nCareer: Walton United (Felixstowe); 1919 Ipswich Town; 1921 Norwich City (trial); 31.8.22 Yeovil and Petters United; 5.8.25 Bristol Rovers (£50) [32,4]; June 1926 Orient [31,17]; September 1929 Lovell’s Athletic; 1930 FC Basel; 11.2.33 Newport County [16,12]; 1933 Lovell’s Athletic; 29.8.34 Felixstowe Town; 27.11.34 Parkland’s Welfare (West Hartlepool); 6.12.35 Billingham; 1936 FC Basel (coach).\n\nThough born in Peckham, even if the date quoted above is open to some debate, Jimmy Gardner, the second child of an engineer James Gardner and his Bristolian wife Elizabeth Martin, lived at 3 Hilmer Street, Kensington until his early teenage years, then in Felixstowe. A regular at non-league Ipswich Town for three years, he made several appearances for Suffolk and represented the Southern Amateur League on three occasions. “A snap shot and a terrier in attack”, he came to Rovers’ attention when he played for Yeovil against the Eastville side in the FA Cup in November 1924. By that stage, he had been a regular in their side for three campaigns, after making his Southern League début in a 2-2 draw against Southend United reserves in September 1922 and he scored the goal against Bath City in April 1924 which secured the Western League championship. Despite missing eight games through injury in the autumn of 1925, he marked his return to Rovers’ side with two goals against Plymouth Argyle in his first game back. Following Second Division football with Orient, his final game being a 2-0 defeat at Southampton in April 1929, interrupted by a serious car crash near Colchester in August 1927, and a peripatetic stint in Switzerland, Gardner made his Newport County début on the day he signed and added two first-half goals as Rovers were defeated 3-1 in April 1933 at Somerton Park. “A dashing, high-scoring leader”, as The South Wales Argus pictured him, he had also scored four times as Lovell’s Athletic beat his former Yeovil side 7-1 in January 1932 and represented the Welsh League against the Irish Free State. Gardner is remembered fondly at Orient, as his eight goals in eight matches at the tail end of the 1926-27 season, which included the only goal of the game, a penalty, in the final match with Reading, helped retain the London’s side’s precarious Division Two status. He married Hilda Anne Bullock (1901-90) in 1921 and is buried in the Town Municipal Cemetery in Felixstowe.\n\nNo 611. Brian Wilbert Gayle. 1996-98.\n\nBorn, 6.3.1965, Kingston-upon-Thames.\n\n6’ 2”; 13 st 12 lbs.\n\nDébut: 29.3.97 v Peterborough United.\n\nCareer: Tooting and Mitcham; 1.7.82 Wimbledon [76+7,3]; 2.1.84 Napier City Rovers (loan); 6.7.88 Manchester City (£325,000) [55,3]; 19.1.90 Ipswich Town (£325,000) [58,4]; 17.9.91 Sheffield United (£750,000) [115+2,9]; 14.8.96 Rotherham United (free) [19+1,0]; 10.10.96 Exeter City (loan) [10,0]; 27.3.97 Bristol Rovers (loan); 3.7.97 Bristol Rovers [23,0]; 19.12.97 Shrewsbury Town [66,1]; 21.3.00 Telford United (to 31.5.01).\n\nIn April 1992, central defender Brian Gayle scored the goal which won the League title for Leeds United. Unfortunately for him, it was an own goal, the scourge of many experienced defenders’ lives, as he was wearing the striped shirt of Sheffield United in this Yorkshire derby. Strong and determined, Gayle had played at the top level for several clubs, earning Manchester City exactly what they paid for him, so his arrival at Rovers injected a wealth of experience and know-how into the back four. His dismissal against Northampton Town in a 1-1 draw in November 1997 makes him the second oldest Rovers recipient of a red card in the Football League. Promotion to the top flight with Wimbledon preceded two FA Cup quarter-final appearances, although a red card against Watford prevented his participation in the 1988 semi-final and final and he also enjoyed promotion to the top division whilst at Maine Road. Club captain at Bramall Lane, he played alongside Phil Kite as United reached the FA Cup semi-finals in 1992-93, losing agonisingly after extra-time to local rivals Wednesday, and suffered relegation the same season. Further relegation followed with Rotherham, where he played against Rovers in his second game for the Millers, whilst Exeter lost six of his few Division Three matches for the club. Own goals followed for Shrewsbury against both Hull City and Orient and his dramatic last-minute own goal at Millwall in February 1997 proved costly for Rotherham. He also scored at the other end regularly enough, opening the scoring when Ipswich defeated Rovers 2-1 at Portman Road in September 1990. Knee injuries in 1994-95 and the following campaign, after being sent off at Oldham after just twenty-six minutes of his first game of the 1995-96 season, restricted his football, but Gayle played under Dave Bassett at Sheffield United and Wimbledon, where he played alongside Ian Holloway, who bought him for Rovers. A team-mate of Devon White at Shrewsbury, he played as the Shrews were knocked out of the FA Cup in November 1998 by non-league Rushden and later made 27 Conference appearances with Telford. He was later reported to have moved into the film industry, playing a minor rôle in “Mean Machine”, alongside Vinny Jones, a film along the lines of “The Great Escape” about footballers pitting their wits against prison guards, and works for Beta Engineering in Rotherham.\n\nNo 721. Alistair Stuart Gibb. 2003-06.\n\nBorn, 17.2.1976, Salisbury.\n\n5’ 9”; 11 st 6 lbs.\n\nDébut: 27.3.04 v York City.\n\nCareer: 1987 Southampton (schoolboy); 1993 Norwich City (professional, 1.7.94); 22.9.95 Northampton Town (loan); 5.2.96 Northampton Town [112+124,8]; 17.2.00 Stockport County (£50,000) [157+8,1]; 25.3.04 Bristol Rovers (free) [45+19,1]; 31.8.06 Hartlepool United (free) [16+15,0]; 11.1.08 Notts County (loan) [9,0]; 22.6.08 Bath City (free); 10.12.08 Newport County; 27.7.09 Almondsbury Town; 2.2.09 Yate Town; 9.2.09 Newport County (loan); 16.2.09 Almondsbury Town; 10.7.14 Stockport County (assistant physiotherapist); 16.8.15 Shrewsbury Town (Head of Sports Science and Medicine); 9.1.17 Bolton Wanderers (Senior Academy Physiotherapist).\n\n“It would be nice to look back after my career has finished and be able to say I kept Bristol Rovers up”, said swift, right-sided midfielder Ali Gibb; he did precisely that. Working under Ian Atkins at both Northampton and Rovers, the young man from Durrington, who later lived in Chepstow, scored Rovers’ third goal on his début, from the edge of the box moments after half-time from Lee Thorpe’s through-ball, and became a crucial cog in Rovers’ machine during his stay in Bristol. His only other goal for the club came in the FA Cup against Port Vale in December 2005; indeed, after November 1997 he scored just twice in the League. With Jamie Cureton at both Southampton and Norwich, Gibb made his League bow in the Cobblers’ 3-0 defeat at Torquay in September 1995 and played alongside Lee Maddison at Northampton. A key part of their side which gained promotion to Division Two through the play-offs in 1996-97, Gibb appeared against Rovers in both fixtures for the next two seasons, as well as in a fixture in the LDV Vans Trophy in January 2000. Alongside Lee Jones, Neil Ross and Aaron Lescott at Stockport, where his only goal came against Blackpool, he was sent off in November 2001 against Norwich City and, amongst various relegation struggles at Edgeley Park, suffered relegation to Division Two in 2001-02. Appearing against Rovers in both fixtures of 2006-07, Hartlepool being promoted along with Rovers that campaign, his late goal-line clearance on the final day almost deprived Rovers of their play-off place. Suffering posterior cruciate ligament damage in 2004-05, Gibb also missed seven months at Bath City with a broken ankle. He later played in one Southern League game with Yate Town in February 2009 before, making use of his degree in Business and Finance, working in financial planning for Barclay’s Bank and Lloyd’s TSB; graduating as a physiotherapist from the University of Salford in 2015, with the highest marks in his year group, he had returned to football with Stockport County, where he worked under Rodger Wylde.\n\nNo 169. William Vivian Talbot Gibbins. 1932-33.\n\nBorn, 10.8.1901, Forest Gate.\n\nDied, 21.11.1979, Herne Bay.\n\n5’ 10”; 11 st 10 lbs.\n\nDébut: 27.8.32 v Crystal Palace.\n\nCareer: Godwin Road School; 1919 Clapton; 12.12.23 West Ham United [129,58]; January 1931 Clapton; 11.2.32 Brentford [8,5]; 8.6.32 Bristol Rovers [37,15]; 24.8.33 Southampton [2,0]; 1934 Leyton; 1934 Catford Wanderers (retired, 1939).\n\nDebonair, sophisticated and dashing, Viv Gibbins cut a fine figure at Eastville in the 1930s. “One of the last great amateurs imbued with the Corinthian spirit”, he was a famous centre-forward and headmaster with a fine reputation. This was such that Rovers were known to charter aeroplanes to ensure their leader of the line could attend midweek fixtures. Gibbins, naturally, responded with two hat-tricks in a calendar month for Rovers in October 1932. The winner of twelve England amateur caps, his seven goals including a brace as Wales were defeated 5-0 at Bournemouth in February 1931, he had twice won full international honours, scoring two first-half goals (the first with “a fine shot, following a free-kick”) in a 3-1 victory against France in May 1924 and once more after twenty-five minutes against the same opposition twelve months later, even though he left the field injured after just thirty-five minutes. Gibbins also played in a match in aid of the East Ham branch of the British Legion at the Boleyn Ground in December 1930, a fixture watched by the Prince of Wales, later King Edward VIII (1894-1972). Top scorer at West Ham in 1930-31, and top-flight hat-trick scorer against Newcastle on Christmas Eve 1927, at Everton in April 1929 and against Manchester United in October 1930, his club form at Upton Park was an extension of earlier success, as he and his Hammers team-mate Stan Earle had both helped Clapton to successive Amateur Cup Final victories in 1923-24 and 1924-25, whilst playing simultaneously for West Ham. In 1933-34 he was in the Leyton side which reached the Amateur Cup Final. He played in the celebrated Amateurs of the South against Professionals of the South game in 1924, 1925 and 1927, scoring twice in a 6-3 defeat at The Den in the third of these matches, whilst he and Claude Ashton, whose brother played for Rovers, appeared for England against The Rest at Dulwich in January 1932. The third of five children to a schoolmaster John Gibbins and his wife Amy Lambert of 21 York Road, Forest Gate, Viv Gibbins married Frances Mabel Ashworth in Brighton on 26th May 1928. He was headmaster of Harold Road School in West Ham for many years, retiring in the early 1970s. His legacy is remembered, as the entrance to the Old Spotted Dog Ground at Disraeli Road in Newham is named the Vivian Gibbins Memorial Gate.\n\n979.\n\nJames Gibbons.\n\nBorn 16.3.1998 Trentham, Stoke-on-Trent.\n\n5’ 9”; 9 st 11 lbs\n\nDébut: 30.7.22 v Forest Green Rovers.\n\nCareer: 2009 Port Vale (20.4.16 professional) [95+16,3]; 17.9.16 Leek Town (loan); 22.6.22 Bristol Rovers (free) [20+17,0]; 31.1.24 Cambridge United (loan) [12+1,0]. Reeased by Bristol Rovers, 1.5.24. Versatile defender James Gibbons, having achieved promotion to League One with Port Vale in 2022, arrived at newly promoted Rovers for the start of the new season. He had played for Vale when they won 2-1 at The Mem in December 2021, Rovers having Sam Finley and Cian Harries both sent off, and his side had been part of the complex end-of-campaign equation through which Rovers’ final day 7-0 victory over Scunthorpe United had earned a remarkable promotion. Gibbons’ signing, as a left-back or central defender, was designed to ensure that Joey Barton’s side could also thrive in third-tier football. “A little terrier”, as his former Val manager Rob Page described him, Gibbons had made his first appearance at Vale Park in December 2016, appearing as a substitute with his side already 4-0 up against Hartlepool United in an FA Cup-tie. Loaned out to Leek Town, he made the first of five appearances in a 2-1 defeat at the hands of Sheffield FC in September 2016. When he made his League bow for Vale, alongside former Rovers goalkeeper Kelle Roos, he received two yellow cards, an indication of his commitment in games. This first red card, in a 1-1 draw at Huish Park against Yeovil Town in August 2017 was swiftly followed by another on the same ground later that season, as Vale crashed out of the FA Cup, Cristian Montaño being sent off in the same game; he was also sent off in a goalless draw with Newport County in January 2019. Young Player of the Year at Vale Park in 2017-18, he was to stake a claim for a regular place in Vale’s side, despite a string of injuries, hamstring issues forcing him to miss half of the 2020-21 campaign, the start of 2021-22 and a month early in 2022. Goals were a are commodity too, a consolation goal in defeat at Morecambe in January 2020 being followed by strikes against both Colchester United and Oldham Athletic in the autumn of 2021. Nonetheless, as Darrell Clarke’s Vale pushed for promotion from League Two in 2021-22, Gibbons was a pivotal part of the side; “his performances at left wing back have been a highlight of the season”, reported The Stoke Sentinel. In that newspaper, James Baggaley reported that, in the 3-0 Wembley play-off final victory over Mansfield Town in May 2022, Gibbons “had a fine game …. [a] quality player who proved it again when it mattered”. At Melksham Town in a pre-season friendly in July 2022, Gibbons managed to score with a rasping drive, with his first touch in a Rovers shirt, but he was soon ruled out with a longterm injury. He was also in the Rovers side which was beaten 2-0 at home by non-league Boreham Wood in November 2022. Gibbons scored for Rovers in a Football League Trophy tie against Cheltenham Town in September 2023, a diving header from Jevani Brown’s cross, and also conceded an own goal in that game, before being sent off at Crawley Town in the same competition.\n\nNo 406. Carl Graham Gilbert. 1969-71.\n\nBorn, 20.3.1948, Folkestone, Kent.\n\n6’; 12 st 8 lbs.\n\nDébut: 26.12.69 v Reading.\n\nCareer: Royal Sussex Regiment; October 1965 Gillingham [28+2,11]; 22.11.69 Bristol Rovers (exchange for Ken Ronaldson) [38+7,15]; 11.3.71 Rotherham United (£17,000) [78+16,37]; July 1974 Margate (£2,500); 1974 Thanet United (trial); July 1976 Folkestone; Canterbury City (coach); Herne Bay (coach); Folkestone (coach).\n\nBlond-haired, lively striker Carl Gilbert bought himself out of the Army to join Gillingham and scored in his first three home matches with Rovers. The only son amongst four children to Percival Gilbert (1918-2001) and Hilda Hessing, the daughter of George Hessing (1867-1941) and Annie Thomson (1877-1964), Carl Gilbert followed his father into railway work, becoming a contractor manager but, keen on football, cricket, basketball, swimming and cross-country, he eschewed his Army band career as a clarinettist and trombonist to take up professional sport. It was just as well that he did, for he made a success of his time in football. He scored on his League début for Gillingham, against Mansfield Town in April 1968, added the winning goal against Rovers in September 1969 and played for the reserves against Rovers’ second string just weeks before scoring again on his Rovers début that Boxing Day. In fact, his final appearance in a Gills shirt saw him sent off in a reserve fixture at Ashton Gate. Living in Kingswood, he was a success at Eastville, scoring inside the first minute in one home fixture against Orient. That Rotherham came for him with good money was little surprise and he did not disappoint at Millmoor either. Scoring all the goals in a 4-0 thumping of Swansea in September 1971, adding hat-tricks against Port Vale in Division Three and Frickley Athletic in the FA Cup, he also played on four occasions against Rovers. Perhaps the most bizarre game came in October 1972, when he scored twice before conceding three as an emergency goalkeeper in a 7-2 defeat at Bournemouth, Brian Clark scoring a hat-trick past three different goalkeepers of whom Gilbert was the second. Being tracked by York, Stockport and Doncaster, Gilbert instead returned to his native Kent in 1974, commanding Margate’s club record transfer fee before breaking his leg a few games into his spell at Folkestone. Later studying for his coaching certificate, Carl Gilbert lives in Folkestone, he and his wife Joyce having three children, Graham, Matthew and Katie.\n\nNo 811. Matthew James Gill. 2011-14.\n\nBorn, 8.11.1980, Cambridge.\n\n5’ 11”; 11 st 8 lbs.\n\nDébut: 6.8.11 v AFC Wimbledon.\n\nCareer: Peterborough United; 3.5.04 Notts County (free) [45+12,0]; 16.1.06 Exeter City (free); 9.6.09 Norwich City (free) [5+7,0]; 23.9.10 Peterborough United (loan) [125+30,5]; 21.1.11 Walsall (loan) [8,2]; 6.6.11 Bristol Rovers (free) [41+3,0]; 18.10.13 Exeter City (loan); 7.1.14 Exeter City (free) [169+8,14]; 29.5.14 Tranmere Rovers (player-coach) (free) [8,0] (8.9.14 assistant manager); 3.11.14 Vineyard FC; July 2015 Takeley; January 2016 Stansted; March 2016 Tilehurst YM; 25.7.15 Norwich City (professional Development Phase Coach; 24.2.17 Under-23 manager); 27.10.18 Ipswich Town (youth coach); 7.5.21 MK Dons (youth coach); 2.8.21 Swansea City (technical development coach; 19.5.22 assistant head coach).\n\nCaptain of the Rovers side which struggled to re-establish itself in the basement division following relegation from League One in the spring of 2011, Matt Gill brought a wealth of experience to the side. Following his Peterborough début in a 3-1 defeat against Torquay United in April 1998, he had enjoyed regular football at various clubs. He scored twice in 51(+3) Conference games at Exeter before adding an impressive tally in the Football League. In May 2007 he became the first player to receive a red card at the newly re-opened Wembley Stadium, after he had supposedly head-butted Morecambe’s Craig Stanley, later a Rovers team-mate, in Exeter’s play-off final, but he recovered from this setback to score four goals in September 2008, thereby being voted League Two Player of the Month, and helping the Grecians to promotion at the end of the 2008-09 campaign. Gill’s Norwich début was the calamitous 7-1 home defeat against neighbours Colchester United in August 2009, but the Canaries recovered to win the return fixture 5-0 and run away with the League One title; he played in their 3-0 victory away to Rovers on the final day of the season. A loan spell with Walsall included a goal as the Saddlers defeated relegation rivals Rovers 6-1 in January 2011. Thereafter, he embarked on a career as a holding midfielder with Rovers, brought to a premature close when a knee injury in December 2012 ruled him out for the rest of that season. Out of favour under manager John Ward at The Mem, Gill was loaned back to the Grecians in the autumn of 2013 before taking Eliot Richards, Dan Woodards and Clayton McDonald with him to Tranmere Rovers, in their final Football League season, which he left in the week prior to their FA Cup meeting with Rovers. He headed his first goal for Stansted in their 2-2 draw at Clapton in April 2016 and scored twice when Tilehurst defeated Barton Rovers 6-0 in December of that year. Married to Bethan, and with children James and Holly, Matt Gill lives in West Kirby.\n\nNo 856. Steven Gillespie. 2013-14.\n\nBorn, 4.6.1985, Liverpool.\n\n5’ 9”; 11 st 3 lbs.\n\nDébut: 8.2.14 v Oxford United.\n\nCareer: Liverpool Schools; 1.7.03 Liverpool; 27.5.04 Bristol City (free) [4+8,1]; 11.1.05 Cheltenham Town (loan); 31.1.06 Cheltenham Town (free); 7.7.08 Colchester United (£400,000) [46+52,25]; 18.6.12 Fleetwood Town (free) [9+13,4]; 15.8.13 Cheltenham Town (loan) [66+26,29]; 6.2.14 Bristol Rovers (free) [3+9,1]; 19.7.14 Altrincham (free); 4.5.15 Warrington Town (free); July 2016 Liverpool (Under-12 coach); 29.11.16 Wigan Athletic (Under-14 coach); 12.1.17 Skelmersdale United (loan); 21.9.17 Liverpool (International Academy).\n\nOnce Liverpool Schools’ record goal-scorer, overtaking Robbie Fowler’s record until his own was bettered by Wayne Rooney, Steven Gillespie is an exciting striker whose career has fluctuated between north-western and south-western clubs. A Bristol City bow in a 2-2 draw at Bournemouth in August 2004 and a goal against Nottingham Forest kick-started a career which flourished under John Ward at Cheltenham, Colchester and Rovers. “A real bits-and-pieces player around the penalty area [who] can sniff out what is going to happen next” (John Ward), Gillespie arrived at The Mem on a short-term contract with an impressive goal-scoring pedigree. He scored in his first two Cheltenham games, including a 38th-minute strike at The Mem and helped the Robins to the League Two play-offs in 2005-06 before adding sixteen goals in the 2007-08 campaign. A club record signing at Colchester, he starred under the former Rovers player Aidy Boothroyd but suffered a string of injuries prior to appearing in newly-promoted Fleetwood’s first Football League fixture, a goalless draw with Torquay United in August 2012. Sent off three times with Cheltenham and once at Colchester, he had appeared in Bristol City’s calamitous 7-1 defeat at Swansea in September 2005 as well as Colchester’s 6-1 loss at home to Stevenage on Boxing Day 2011. He had appeared in nine League fixtures against Rovers, four each with Cheltenham and Colchester and one with Fleetwood, scoring twice for the Robins. With Ryan Brunt side-lined for the rest of the season, John Ward signed up the fast striker, despite the fact that he had scored only twice all season, a brace in the Johnstone’s Paint Trophy tie between Cheltenham and Plymouth in September 2013. He headed Rovers’ last-gasp equaliser at table-topping Scunthorpe, but it proved to be his only goal for the club and he was released when Rovers surrendered their Football League status, playing for Altrincham against Rovers the following campaign. His last-minute penalty was saved by Alfreton goalkeeper Cameron Dawson as Alty lost 1-0 at home to the Derbyshire outfit in November 2014 and his August 2014 goal at Southport proved his only strike in 8(+14) Conference appearances with Altrincham. In 10(+10) Northern Premier League matches with Warrington, he scored three times and missed a penalty in October 2015 against Harrogate Railway Athletic, although his season was blighted by a long-term shoulder injury; returning to the side in the spring, he helped them secure the divisional title. Later appearing in eleven Northern Premier League matches with Skelmersdale, without scoring, he also coached at Wigan Athletic.\n\nNo 467. Donald George Gillies. 1980-82.\n\nBorn, 20.6.1951, Glencoe.\n\n5’ 10”; 11 st 5 lbs.\n\nDébut: 16.8.80 v Orient.\n\nCareer: Inverness Clachnacuddin; 1.11.71 Morton [45+2,23]; 8.3.73 Bristol City (£30,000) [183+17,26]; 23.5.80 Bristol Rovers (£50,000) [56+3,0]; 26.10.83 Paulton Rovers; 8.7.85 Trowbridge Town; 15.7.85 Anorthosis, Cyprus; 25.7.86 Trowbridge Town; 14.8.86 Yeovil Town; 1987 Clutton; 2.4.88 Bristol Manor Farm; December 1993 Clevedon Town (commercial manager, to 1.2.94).\n\nSites of celebrated historical battles do not feature to any great extent amongst footballers’ birthdays, but one exception to this rule is right-back Donnie Gillies. One Scottish cap at Under-23 level and fourteen League goals for Morton in the 1972-73 season caught the eye of the management team at Ashton Gate and Gillies was soon one of three former Morton players, Joe Jordan and Gerry Sweeney being the others, to feature in an astonishing period of time for Bristol City. Remarkably top scorer in 1974-75, Gillies helped City gain promotion to Division One in the spring of 1976, returning to a division the Robins had last graced in 1911. He also scored the only goal of the game at Leeds in an FA Cup replay in 1974 from Keith Fear’s through ball. “Everyone remembers the goal I scored at Leeds but, in fact, there was a goal much more important than that – the one that kept us in the top flight”, he recalled of a late equaliser in May 1977 when City, requiring a point to survive and relegate Sunderland, drew their final game of a traumatic campaign 2-2 with Coventry City. Better still, he registered a hat-trick against Mo in May 1975 on City’s tour of Norway. A cricketer with Southville Wayfarers, Gillies became one of the rare breed of footballer to play regularly for both Bristol clubs, although his consistent appearances at full-back were insufficient to prevent Rovers’ relegation along with City to Division Three in the spring of 1981. Thereafter, he enjoyed a year of Cypriot football, his team being managed at that time by a former Bristol City colleague, Peter Cormack, and made his Yeovil bow in a 2-1 victory over Bromley. He also had the unlikely experience of twice signing for Trowbridge, yet never playing a game for the club. “I loved playing football”, Gillies reminisced, “and am glad I had the chance to play at the level I did” (Bristol Independent, 2004). Having lived in Temple Cloud, he lives in Wells with his wife Louise and they have a daughter and two grandchildren; he runs Chew Valley produce, supplying fruit and vegetables to pubs and cafés in and around the Bristol area.\n\nNo 674. David Miles Gilroy. 2001-04.\n\nBorn, 23.12.1982, Yeovil.\n\n5’ 11”; 11 st 1 lb.\n\nDébut: 25.8.01 v Luton Town.\n\nCareer: Bristol Rovers (professional, 1.8.01) [6+13,0]; 1.3.02 Bath City (loan); 29.7.03 Exeter City (trial); 8.8.03 Forest Green Rovers (loan); 12.9.03 Clevedon Town (loan); 8.12.03 Barnet (trial); 31.12.03 Weston-super-Mare (loan); 7.1.04 Weston-super-Mare (free); 20.10.04 Bath City (free); 12.11.04 Chippenham Town (loan); 15.2.05 Chippenham Town (£1,000); 12.5.07 Bath City; 30.4.09 Newport County (free); 2.10.09 Weston-super-Mare (loan); 15.2.10 Bath City (loan); 2.6.10 Woking (free); 1.7.11 Cirencester Town; 17.9.12 Frome Town (free); 1.9.13 Cribbs (free).\n\nDespite not scoring in the League, striker Dave Gilroy contributed seven in six pre-season friendlies in 2001 and scored a last-minute goal in the FA Cup-tie at Runcorn in November 2002. The following month, he contrived to head an own goal and then score twice at the correct end as Rovers’ reserve side beat Oxford United reserves 3-1 at Cossham Street. He had scored a hat-trick for Rovers in an FA Youth Cup-tie in October 2000, as Tonbridge Angels were defeated 4-0 at the Memorial Stadium. A long career in local non-league football included seventeen goals in 42 games during two spells at Weston, 55 in 108 matches at Chippenham, 43 goals in 78 fixtures in two Bath stints, ten games and two goals for Newport and four goals in just three matches at Woking. Gilroy, a team-mate of Mark McKeever, Billy Clark, Jon French, Lewis Hogg and David Mehew at Weston, scored on his début against Merthyr on New Year’s Day 2004 and his hat-trick in a 5-1 victory over Stafford Rangers in April 2004 secured his club’s Nationwide South status; further hat-tricks came for Chippenham against Cirencester Town in February 2005 and for Bath against Bognor and East Thurrock in consecutive weeks in September 2007 as well as against Braintree Town at Twerton Park in April 2009. Dave Gilroy was the Southern League Premier Division top scorer in 2005-06 and scored over twenty goals in consecutive seasons for Chippenham, adding two goals as they won the Wiltshire Senior Shield in April 2005, overcoming a 3-0 deficit to defeat Swindon Town 6-4 after extra time, before spending a season as a team-mate of Neil Arndale at Cirencester. He added three goals for Frome Town in 25(+11) appearances during the 2012-13 campaign and an impressive 51 goals in 81 Western League fixture over three seasons with Cribbs.\n\nNo 934. Joshua Lloyd Ginnelly. 2019-2020.\n\nBorn, 24.3.1997, Coventry.\n\n5’ 8”; 10 st 4 lbs.\n\nDébut: 18.1.20 v Rotherham United.\n\nCareer: 2006 Aston Villa; 2013 Shrewsbury Town (professional, 9.4.14) [0+3,0]; 15.7.15 Norwich City (trial); 28.7.15 Burnley (trial); 10.8.15 Burnley (free); 8.1.16 Altrincham (loan); 28.7.16 Walsall (loan); 30.1.17 Lincoln City (loan) [8+7,2]; 12.1.18 Tranmere Rovers (loan); 5.6.18 Walsall (free) [22+8,2]; 1.1.19 Preston North End (free) [0+6,0]; 16.1.20 Bristol Rovers (loan) [5+4,1]; 2.9.20 Heart of Midlothian (loan); 17.6.21 Heart of Midlothian (free) [19+18,8].\n\n“Bringing down a long ball with his first touch before showing ambition by taking on two Luton defenders” (Shropshire Star), exciting midfielder Josh Ginnelly certainly attracted attention on his Shrewsbury League bow as a seventeen-year-old in August 2014. He also scored four times the following month, as Chasetown were defeated 13-0 in the quarter-finals of the Midland Youth Cup. Swift and skilful, he managed thirty-one minutes of League action for the Shropshire side and was their Young Player of the Year for 2014-15, before embarking on a string of loan spells from Burnley. In 19(+1) Conference matches with Altrincham, all five of his goals came at Moss Lane, Alty being relegated at the end of the 2015-16 campaign. He was also the victim of racial abuse during the game against Barrow in March 2016, prompting a police investigation. Successive promotions followed, both at Lincoln, where his 7(+6) goalless Conference appearances helped the Imps back to the Football League (Ginnelly promptly scored in their first game back, a 2-2 draw at Wycombe in August 2017) and with Tranmere, for whom he started at Wembley in May 2018, Rovers defeating Boreham Wood 2-1 to return to League Two. He had scored on his Tranmere début, a victory over Maidenhead United, and scored against Tranmere when Walsall defeated them 3-1 in a League Cup-tie. It was at Walsall that Ginnelly forged an effective partnership with Luke Leahy, the pair starring as the Saddlers left The Mem in October 2018 with a last-minute win, and this partnership was rekindled, after a brief spell alongside Billy Bodin at Preston, when Ginnelly signed for the Gas. He struck Rovers’ late winning goal against ten-man Blackpool at The Mem in February 2020 to end an eleven-match run without a League win, but soon returned to Preston with a hip injury. Heading north of the border, Ginnelly scored in the delayed 2020 Scottish Cup Final in December of that year, crashing the ball home from close range nine minutes fron the end of extra time, after a deep cross had been headed back across goal by Man of the Match Stephen Kingsley; Hearts, though, despite drawing 3-3 with Celtic, lost the final on penalties. In so doing he became, after Jackie Chalmers in 1910 and Willie Culley ten years later, the third Rovers player to score in this showpiece match. In December 2021 Ginnelly was sent off in the home League fixture against Rangers. He then appeared as a substitute in the 2022 Scottish Cup Final against Rangers, replacing Scottish international Barrie McKay for the final eight minutes as well as extra-time in a tie which ultimately resulted in a 2-0 defeat, and set up one of Lawrence Shankland’s three goals in an enthralling Scottish Premier League match in October 2022, in which Hearts lost 4-3 at home to Celtic. The former Hearts defender Allan Preston commented: “Josh Ginnelly, when he is on his game, is a real threat; he can put good balls in the box, he's lightening quick and is great with the ball at his feet.”\n\nNo 661. Matthew William Glennon. 2000-01.\n\nBorn, 8.10.1978, Stockport.\n\n6’ 2”’ 14 st 9 lbs.\n\nDébut: 16.9.00 v Wigan Athletic.\n\nCareer: 1994 Bolton Wanderers (professional, 1.8.97); 10.9.99 Port Vale (loan); 18.1.00 Stockport County (loan); 15.9.00 Bristol Rovers [1,0]; 10.11.00 Carlisle United (loan); 6.6.01 Hull City (£50,000) [35,0]; 18.12.02 Carlisle United (free) [105,0]; 20.7.05 Falkirk (free) [21,0]; 29.1.06 St Johnstone (free) [12,1]; 16.6.06 Huddersfield Town (free) [109,0]; 13.1.10 Bradford City (free) [17,0]; 20.8.10 Stockport County (free) [60,0]; 24.2.12 Chester FC; 17.7.12 FC Halifax (free); 1.1.16 Buxton (free); 8.3.16 Scarborough Athletic (free); 28.1.17 AFC Emley (free).\n\nPowerful and tall, dominating his penalty area, Matt Glennon’s extensive career in football began with a solitary performance for Rovers, pleasurably enough for a goalkeeper in a goalless draw where he was awarded the Man of the Match accolade. His career took off at Hull, where a successful 2001-02 campaign was followed by an appearance against Rovers in August 2002, and he and Lee Maddison played together for Carlisle against Rovers before the 2002-03 season was out. Indeed, Glennon became a household name at Carlisle, who reached the LDV Vans Trophy Final of 2003, which was lost 2-0 to Bristol City, surviving relegation to the Conference by a solitary point in 2003, only to drop twelve months later and return to the Football League via the play-offs in May 2005. As a consequence Glennon, sent off at Rochdale in March 2004, appeared in what was temporarily Carlisle’s final League fixture and can add 38 Conference outings to his impressive career tally at Brunton Park. Having conceded an own goal in Falkirk’s 3-1 home defeat against Dundee United in October 2005, Glennon scored at the right end in St Johnstone’s 2-2 draw at Ross County in March 2006 to join the rare breed of goal-scoring goalkeepers; having come forward for a corner two minutes from time, he fired home from ten yards out to earn a late point. Another unusual achievement came at Huddersfield, where he saved three penalties in the home game with Crewe in February 2007, first from Ryan Lowe four minutes before the interval, then from Gary Roberts eleven minutes from time and, having been adjudged to have moved, the re-taken penalty from Julien Baudet. One of two Terriers sent off at Southend in a 4-1 defeat in December 2007, he played three times against Rovers before playing in Stockport’s final League fixture, a 2-0 defeat at Crewe, as they lost their Football League status in 2011. Twelve games for the re-formed Chester side helped them to the Northern Premier League title in 2011-12 and 35 matches with Halifax took his side to the Nationwide North play-offs, where they defeated Brackley Town in the final to reach the Conference. An unused substitute as Halifax secured the West Riding Cup, defeating Guiseley at Valley Parade in May 2013, he was sent off after just 21 minutes at Cambridge in August 2013, conceding the second penalty of nine-man Halifax’s game. Glennon having 111 Conference appearances in all to his name whilst at The Shay, Halifax reached the Conference play-offs in the spring of 2014, losing over two legs to Cambridge United, whilst he was in the opponents’ side for both Halifax’s Conference games with Rovers during the 2014-15 season, as well as a 7-0 crushing at Grimsby in October 2015. Halifax were relegated to the Conference North in the spring of 2016, and Glennon missed the Wembley FA Trophy Final, as Grimsby Town were defeated 1-0. Matt Glennon, who played four times for Buxton and in one match each for Scarborough and Emley, is married to Nicola with daughters Alannah and Imogen and he runs a hairdressing salon in Emley, called G27.\n\nNo 411. Brian Cameron Godfrey. 1971-73.\n\nBorn, 1.5.1940, Flint,\n\nDied, 11.2.2010, Nicosia, Cyprus.\n\n5’ 9”; 11 st 11 lbs.\n\nDébut: 14.8.71 v York City.\n\nCareer: Wrexham (trial); Chester (trial); Tranmere Rovers (trial); August 1955 Flint Alexandra; 1956 Everton (professional, May 1958) [1,0]; June 1960 Scunthorpe United [87,24]; October 1963 Preston North End (£8,000) [121+1,52]; 1.9.67 Aston Villa [139+4,22]; 26.5.71 Bristol Rovers (exchange for Ray Graydon, plus £35,000) [79+2,16]; 9.6.73 Newport County (£10,000) [117+1,14]; 27.4.75 Portland Timbers (loan) [20,3]; July 1976 Bath City (manager); January 1979 Exeter City (manager); July 1983 Bath City (manager); 12.12.83 Weymouth (manager); 5.6.87 Gloucester City (manager to 5.11.91, re-appointed, 1.2.92 to April 1994); 20.1.95 Cinderford Town (coach; assistant manager, 10.5.96; manager, 28.2.97); July 1998 Shortwood United (manager); Newport County (scout); Gloucester City (scout); July 1999 Cinderford Town; July 2000 Gloucester City (assistant manager, to 12.6.03).\n\nExperienced Welsh midfielder Brian Godfrey arrived at Eastville toward the end of a successful career, shortly after captaining Villa in the 1971 League Cup Final against Spurs. They had defeated Rovers in a quarter-final replay on their way to Wembley. Tough and effective in the middle of the field, he scored a hat-trick in the opening twenty-five minutes of the home game with Bradford City in September 1971, scoring after one, six and 25 minutes; five goals ahead by that stage, Rovers won 7-1. Rovers were one of three clubs for whom he had registered a League hat-trick, for he also scored three times in Preston’s 5-1 win at Ipswich in August 1964 and three goals in a four-minute burst during a 9-0 home win against Cardiff City in May 1966, as well as in Newport’s 4-0 home victory over Workington in March 1974. Godfrey, who had played once for Everton in a 2-0 defeat at Fulham in January 1960, was reserve for Preston at the 1964 FA Cup Final, in an era when substitutes received no medal, and helped Scunthorpe to their highest ever placing, fourth in Division Two in 1961-62, as well as playing against Stanley Matthews (1915-2000) in the FA Cup. He was Preston’s first goal-scoring substitute, in a 5-1 defeat against Coventry City on New Year’s Day 1966. Twice Villa’s Player of the Year, he had scored once in three League games for Scunthorpe against Rovers and his arrival at Eastville was something of a coup. Godfrey, the holder of a Welsh Under-23 cap from the goalless draw in Northern Ireland in February 1962, had three full caps for Wales to his name and had scored twice for his country, against George Best’s (1946-2005) Northern Ireland in April 1964 and in a 4-1 defeat in May 1965 against Italy in Florence. He was to win the Western Division with Portland Timbers, in addition to playing in the NASL League Cup Final against Tampa Bay Rowdies and he led Bath to the Southern League title in 1977-78 as well as two Anglo-Italian Cup Finals, and Exeter to the FA Cup quarter-finals in 1980-81, where they lost 2-0 to eventual winners, Spurs. Under his care, Gloucester drew in the FA Cup with Cardiff City, were Midland Division champions in 1988-89 and only missed out on promotion to the Conference in 1991 because Farnborough scored at Atherstone three minutes from time on the final day. The elder of two sons to Archibald Cameron Godfrey (1905-58) and his wife Frances Roberts, he married Judy and they had three daughters, Judith, Rebecca and Rachel, and seven grandchildren. Awarded a testimonial in 2003, when Villa visited Gloucester City, Brian Godfrey was a stationery and office equipment delivery driver around Cheltenham before retiring to Cyprus in June 2003; he died in Lefkosa Hospital in Nicosia of leukaemia, aged sixty-nine, and is buried at the British Cemetery in Girne.\n\nNo 560. Colin Kenneth Gordon. 1990-91.\n\nBorn, 17.1.1963, Stourbridge.\n\n6’ 1”; 12 st 12 lbs.\n\nDébut: 26.2.91 v Burnley.\n\nCareer: Stourbridge; 1981 Worcester City; 1982 Halesowen Harriers (trial); 1982 Oldbury United; 1.11.84 Swindon Town [70+2,34]; 3.7.86 Wimbledon (£80,000) [2+1,0]; 15.2.87 Gillingham (loan) [4,2]; 17.7.87 Reading (£80,000) [23+1,0]; 24.3.88 Bristol City (loan) [8,4]; 7.10.88 Fulham (£100,000) [12+5,2]; 29.6.89 Birmingham City [17+9,3]; 13.9.90 Hereford United (loan) [6,0]; 19.12.90 Walsall (loan) [6,1]; 23.1.91 Bristol Rovers (loan) [1+3,0]; 19.7.91 Leicester City [18+6,5]; January 1993 Kidderminster Harriers (free) (player-coach); 1993 Gloucester City (loan); May 1994 Stourbridge (player-manager); 1996 Walsall (youth team coach); 1998 Wolverhampton Wanderers (youth team coach) (to 1999); 29.4.15 Kidderminster Harriers (board of directors; 24.7.15 Under-21 coach; 22.9.15-9.10.15 caretaker manager; 8.1.16-21.4.16 manager; 2.11.15-22.10.19 chairman).\n\nThough still not thirty years of age, free-scoring Colin Gordon had performed in the League for nine separate clubs before joining Rovers. After one substitute appearance at Stourbridge and one goal in six games at Worcester, he made his mark at Swindon, where he had been talent-spotted by the veteran Bert Head, and scored a hat-trick against Hereford United in April 1985. Six goals in a four-match spell for Reading in October 1987 could not prevent the Berkshire club’s relegation to Division Three that campaign. An understudy at Wimbledon to John Fashanu, he played in the Bristol derby in April 1988, which Rovers won through a Gary Penrice goal, and contributed the goal against Doncaster Rovers which took City to the 1987-88 play-offs, having missed a penalty and broken his wrist earlier in the same game. Featuring in both Fulham’s fixtures against Rovers in 1988-89, he then contracted blood poisoning at Birmingham, after being accidentally bitten on the arm by a Swansea player. He was a temporary response to an injury crisis in Rovers’ first campaign back in Division Two, starting for the only time against his former club Swindon and he later scored for Walsall against Wrexham over Christmas 1990. Groin and hip issues suffered whilst at Leicester eventually led to a hip replacement at the age of thirty-seven, although only after Gordon had scored twice in three minutes for Kidderminster against Yeovil Town in March 1993, scoring three goals in sixteen Conference games and he lost the managerial post at Amblecote after Stourbridge had won only once in ten games. The elder child of Ken Gordon and the Italian-born Pia Gobbi, and now married to Karen with two sons and a daughter and living in Stourbridge, Colin Gordon left football in 1999 to focus on a career in sports goods and later set up Key Sports Management, an agency which employs seven people and enjoys over sixty clients. Amongst the figures he represents are Steve McClaren, Theo Walcott and David James, whose transfer to Ashton Gate in 2010 he co-ordinated, and this rôle has allowed him to present well-supported allegations against corruption within football finance. Tempted back into football onto the Kidderminster board, he found himself in temporary charge in the autumn of 2015, as the Aggborough club endured a torrid start to their Conference campaign which was to end in relegation, and became the major shareholder of the club that November. He helped Harriers to the play-offs in Nationwide North in 2016-17.\n\nNo 868. Jake Gosling. 2015-17.\n\nBorn, 11.8.1993, Oxford.\n\n5’ 9”; 10 st 7 lbs.\n\nDébut: 22.8.15 v Barnet.\n\nCareer: Godolphin Athletic; 2003 Swindon Town; 2004 Plymouth Argyle; 2009 Hartpury College; 1.4.11 Exeter City (professional, 17.4.12) [6+9,1]; 1.9.12 Dorchester Town (loan); 13.3.14 Gloucester City (loan); 24.6.14 Bristol Rovers (free) [8+10,0]; 26.2.16 Newport County (loan) [2+4,0]; 18.8.16 Cambridge United (loan) [3+1,0]; 16.1.17 Forest Green Rovers (loan); 6.6.17 Torquay United (free); 22.11.19 Sporting Khalsa; 6.11.21 Bristol Manor Farm.\n\nForty-eight hours after opposing Robert Lewandowski’s Polish side in international football, winger Jake Gosling appeared as a substitute in Rovers’ 1-0 home victory over Wrexham. Oxford-born but brought up from 2004 in Newquay, he nonetheless enjoyed international football thanks to a family connection with Gibraltar. Once the rock nation was accepted into FIFA’s fold, Gosling scored on his international début, his goal in a 1-1 draw in Estonia in May 2014 being the first competitive away goal scored by his country and won twelve caps in all, conceding a penalty against world champions Germany in June 2015. His consolation goal against Poland in September 2015 marked him out as the rock nation’s all-time leading scorer (with two goals), a fact which Rovers’ manager Darrell Clarke seized upon in a filmed celebratory act similar to that put on by Manchester United after Wayne Rooney had become England’s all-time leading scorer just a few days earlier. He qualified to represent Gibraltar as his father, a Royal Air Force serviceman, had been born there. During the 2014-15 campaign, as Rovers pushed hard for an immediate return to the Football League, Gosling appeared in 15(+8) Conference matches and added three goals as the Gas finished one point behind champions Barnet; it was his right-wing corner which led to Ellis Harrison’s goal in the Wembley play-off final in May 2015 as Rovers dramatically secured promotion back to League football. The following campaign saw him play just a bit-part, and indeed was sent out on loan, but he was involved in the move from which Lee Brown scored Rovers’ very late final-day goal at home to Dagenham, to secure back-to-back promotions in May 2016 and elevate the club into League One. More parochially, he had scored an 83rd-minute goal as Exeter defeated Northampton Town 3-0 in March 2013, appearing alongside Jamie Cureton, Pat Baldwin and Danny Coles at St James’ Park, and opposing Rovers the same month as a half-time substitute for Bristol-born Tommy Doherty at The Mem. His twelve Nationwide South appearances with Dorchester were goalless, although he did score from ten yards out as the non-league side defeated Plymouth Argyle in an FA Cup shock in November 2012, and his twelve games in the same division for Gloucester included goals against Harrogate Town, Brackley Town and Telford. He played in 4(+3) Conference matches with Forest Green Rovers during their promotion season, although he had left The New Lawn before their Wembley play-off victory over Tranmere Rovers and later played up front at Torquay alongside Rory Fallon, where he played in 9(+5) matches without scoring as The Gulls were relegated from the Conference. He later added four goals in twenty games with Manor Farm.\n\nNo 343. Anthony Michael Gough. 1958-59.\n\nBorn, 18.3.1940, Bath.\n\n6’; 12 st 2 lbs.\n\nDébut: 30.4.59 v Sheffield Wednesday.\n\nCareer: West Twerton Youth Club; 7.8.56 Bath City; 10.5.57 Bristol Rovers (professional, May 1958) [1,0]; 11.8.60 Trowbridge Town; 8.5.61 Bath City; 1961 Frome Town (loan); 13.7.70 Swindon Town (£500) [24+1,2]; 23.7.71 Hereford United; 14.7.72 Torquay United [2,0]; Bath City (loan); 11.5.73 Bath City; 1974 Welton Rovers; Cinderford Town; Melksham Town.\n\nPlaying League football in the 1950s and the 1970s, but not in the Sixties, Tony Gough was Hereford’s captain for their memorable FA Cup victory over Newcastle United. The young man from Bath, the elder child of Ernest Gough and Dorothy Swift, had scored when the reserves drew 5-5 with Brighton reserves before a crowd of 3,331 at Eastville in March 1959, and was a teenage débutant when Rovers beat Wednesday 2-1 (“Gough had an intelligent opening half, but later showed he is not ready for this class of football”, as the local press observed) and next appeared in the Football League eleven years 121 days later, scoring against Sunderland on his Swindon début; in the return fixture with the Black Cats, Gough was stretchered off the field and never played for the Robins again. In the meantime Gough, who lived in Oldfield Park, had made a name for himself at Bath City where, with 481 appearances to his name, he remains the club’s record appearance maker. Alongside Brian Carter, he was in the side which drew 1-1 with Bolton Wanderers at Twerton Park in an FA Cup third round tie in January 1964. He was awarded a testimonial game against League champions Manchester City in 1969 and scored twice in a 5-5 draw. As late as August 1970, a headed goal six minutes before half-time against Sunderland was the first of Gough’s League career, his second goal coming the following March, as Blackburn Rovers were defeated 3-0. In 1971 he moved to Hereford, where his nineteen goals in 64 games included a tally of nine in 35 Southern League appearances. It is for the Bulls’ exploits in the FA Cup, though, that this spell is best remembered, for Hereford pulled off an astonishing 2-1 victory over Newcastle in the spring of 1972, oft-replayed television footage showing a sprightly Ronnie Radford (1943-2022), socks around his ankles, celebrating a wonder goal and captain Tony Gough appearing in the aftermath. Signed for both Swindon and Torquay by the former Rovers manager Fred Ford, and working under Malcolm Allison (1927-2010) at Bath, Gough’s career took another dramatic twist when the veteran scored the goal against Andover in April 1974 which secured the Southern League title for the Romans.\n\nNo 446. Robert Alfred Gould. 1977-79.\n\nBorn, 12.6.1946, Coventry.\n\n5’ 10”; 11 st 5 lbs.\n\nDébut: 15.10.77 v Blackburn Rovers.\n\nCareer: St James’ Youth Club; June 1964 Coventry City [78+4,40]; 2.2.68 Arsenal (£90,000) [57+8,16]; 2.6.70 Wolverhampton Wanderers (£55,000); 15.9.71 West Bromwich Albion (£66,666) [52,18]; 15.12.72 Bristol City (£70,000) [35,15]; 23.11.73 West Ham United (£80,000) [46+5,15]; 4.12.75 Wolverhampton Wanderers (£30,000) [63+11,31]; 14.10.77 Bristol Rovers (£10,000) [35+1,12]; 13.9.78 Hereford United (£10,000) [42+3,13]; November 1979 Chelsea (player-coach); 1981 Aldershot (player-coach); 22.10.81 Bristol Rovers (manager); 16.5.83 Coventry City (manager); 16.5.85 Bristol Rovers (manager); 26.6.87 Wimbledon (manager); November 1990 Queen’s Park Rangers (coach); 25.2.91 West Bromwich Albion (manager); 24.6.92 Coventry City (manager); 17.8.95 Wales (manager); 3.2.98 Cardiff City (acting trainer; manager, 7.8.00; club manager, 16.10.00); 22.1.03 Cheltenham Town (manager); 18.10.03 Gloucester United (manager); 10.2.04 Peterborough United (coach); 2006 Hawkes Bay United, Australia (assistant manager); 12.4.09 Weymouth (manager, to 15.5.09); October 2012 Wanderers (manager); 16.11.13 Portishead Town (caretaker manager).\n\nHat-trick scoring débutant and twice club manager, Bobby Gould could count Rovers on the extensive list of clubs listed in his impressive career record. Accepted by many as unlucky not to have won an England cap, Gould certainly scored goals freely during his playing career. Top scorer in the division as Coventry were promoted from Division Two in 1966-67, his tally including a hat-trick against Ipswich Town that December, his large transfer fee to Arsenal led to a Fairs Cup goal against Glentoran in September 1969 as well as a goal in the 1969 League Cup Final at Wembley. On a Wembley pitch recently churned up by the Horse of the Year Show, the Gunners were surprisingly defeated by third-tier Swindon Town, even though, with four minutes remaining, “battling Bobby Gould powered through the mud to ram in an equaliser” (Norman Giller). He scored the goal against Hull City in September 1973 which put Bristol City top of Division Two, won the Texaco Cup with Wolves, was an unused substitute as West Ham defeated Fulham in the 1975 FA Cup Final and was Hereford’s leading scorer in 1978-79. He had registered a League Cup hat-trick when the Hammers defeated Tranmere Rovers 6-0 in the autumn of 1974. Gould’s arrival at Eastville sparked a surge in interest in the club, a trend justified when the accomplished striker scored a hat-trick on his début in a 4-1 victory, equalling the record of Jimmy McCambridge and Joe Riley; Gould’s hat-trick was registered before half-time, David Staniforth adding a second-half goal in a 4-1 home victory. The veteran striker’s second appearance in a Rovers shirt, though, was the televised 9-0 defeat at White Hart Lane. A measured lob after 21 minutes at Roker Park enabled Rovers to knock illustrious Sunderland out of the FA Cup 1-0 in January 1978. Bobby Gould turned his hand to football management, although his playing career never quite ended; he made a substitute appearance for Backwell against Bath City in the Western League in February 1985, he scored for Coventry reserves against Bolton in September 1993, aged forty-seven, and played for Hereford reserves the following spring. Gould proved an adept and talented manager, taking an under-rated and under-funded Wimbledon side to an FA Cup Final in 1988 when, to the astonishment of the footballing world, all-conquering Liverpool were defeated 1-0. He was manager of the Welsh side before resigning in the aftermath of a 4-0 World Cup defeat in Italy in June 1999, he managed Cheltenham when they were relegated to Division Three in 2002-03 and brought his side to The Mem in September 2003, all the time working as a football consultant at Hartpury College, and he worked at Peterborough under Barry Fry before resigning at half-time of an LDV Vans Trophy game at Ashton Gate. Bobby Gould turned down a managerial job with Rovers in 1980, but led the side in two spells, masterminding re-establishing the side in third-tier football following relegation and later being in charge for the final Eastville campaign and the traumatic move to Bath, where he started the team-building process which was to lead to the Third Division title in 1989-90. Roy Gould and Helen Morton, who married in Coventry at the end of World War Two, had two footballing sons, Trevor who played for Northampton Town, and Bobby; he and Margery had two sons, Jonathan playing for Coventry City (and winning two caps for Scotland, against Lithuania in 1999 and Norway the following year) and Richard working as Chief Executive first at Somerset CCC, later with Surrey and more recently at Bristol City. Jonathan’s son Matt was in goal for Stourbridge, when they reached the FA Cup third round in 2016-17 and was called up at the age of twenty-eight to the New Zealand squad for the spring 2022 fixtures with Jordan and Uzbekistan. Bobby Gould, who took brief charge at Weymouth after the club had lost eleven consecutive Conference matches and not scored in 716 minutes, now lives in Portishead.\n\nNo 857. Alan Gow. 2013-14.\n\nBorn, 9.10.1982, Clydebank.\n\n6’; 11 st.\n\nDébut: 8.2.14 v Oxford United.\n\nCareer: Yoker Boys’ Club; 24.11.00 Clydebank [3+4,0]; 30.8.02 Airdrie United (free) [67+17,25]; 1.6.05 Falkirk (free) [64+6,13]; 1.2.07 Rangers (free); 1.9.08 Blackpool (loan) [10+7,5]; 2.2.09 Norwich City (loan) [8+5,0]; 14.8.09 Plymouth Argyle (£200,000) [8+6,2]; 1.2.10 Hibernian (loan) [3+4,0]; 2.9.10 Motherwell (free) [9+6,1]; 14.1.11 Notts County (free) [12+4,1]; 15.8.11 East Bengal (free); 7.2.12 Rah Ahan (trial); 22.3.12 Exeter City (free) [45+13,14]; 7.2.14 Bristol Rovers (loan) [4,0]; 2.8.14 Inverness Caledonian Thistle (trial); 20.2.15 St Mirren (free) [7+9,0]; 8.6.16 Airdrieonians (trial); 4.10.18 Stirling Albion (trial) [1,0]; 12.12.18 Queen’s Park (free) [9+6,0]; 28.8.20 Falkirk (Head of Football Operations, to 2.11.20).\n\nMercurial forward Alan Gow joined Rovers alongside Steven Gillespie as the club attempted to halt a potential freefall into Conference football in the spring of 2014. An experienced forward or attacking midfielder, he had a “habit of bamboozling defences from a roving rôle between the lines”, according to the Exeter City website, and was the Grecians’ top scorer at the time of his transfer. Following a Scottish League bow, as a substitute for goal-scorer Johnny Walker, in Clydebank’s 1-1 draw at Queen’s Park in November 2000, Gow helped Airdrie secure the Division Two title in 2004, scoring twice in the opening twenty minutes as Berwick Rangers, five goals down inside 24 minutes, were defeated 6-0 that April. Two Premier League campaigns at Falkirk included a 26-minute hat-trick in the 5-1 New Year’s Day 2007 victory against Dundee United, whose centre-backs were David McCracken and Garry Kenneth, but a move to Rangers brought just two cup-tie appearances, at East Fife in the League Cup and East Stirling in the Scottish Cup. Club form earned an appearance for Scotland B against Finland B at Rugby Park, Kilmarnock, coming off the bench to score in a 2-2 draw. South of the border, Gow’s first goal came for Blackpool against Cardiff City in October 2008 and, following a Norwich début in a 3-3 draw at Wolves, he scored against Cardiff City and Sheffield Wednesday in his first two Argyle appearances. Returning north, he scored for Motherwell at Inverness in November 2010, as well as Scottish Cup goals both at Hibs, against Montrose, and for Motherwell against Dundee United. Gow was in the Notts County side which faced Rovers in the spring of 2011, as well as helping County draw with a strong Manchester City side in the FA Cup; his solitary goal proved the winner at Hillsborough, although he also “scored” in the abandoned game with Tranmere Rovers. After five games and two goals working under Trevor Morgan in India, plus an Iranian trial, he enjoyed success with Exeter, appearing three times against Rovers after his first two goals, in an eight-minute spell, had eased the Grecians to a 4-2 victory over Walsall. St Mirren were relegated after completing the 2014-15 campaign at the foot of the Scottish Premier League, Gow scoring in a League Cup-tie at Annan Athletic the following August. After two years out, he played in Stirling’s 1-0 defeat at Cowdenbeath before resurrecting his career with Queen’s Park; he was sent off in March 2019 in a 2-0 defeat at Edinburgh City for two bookings in three minutes, the second for a late foul on Liam Henderson. Alan Gow had his driving licence revoked in February 2014 and was then caught by police, driving his Land Rover with personalised number plates through Drumchapel in August 2019, whilst his license remained revoked.\n\nNo 941.Josh Grant. 2020-\n\nBorn, 11.10.1998, Brixton.\n\n6’; 13 st 3 lbs.\n\nDébut: 12.9.20 v Sunderland.\n\nCareer: 2007 Chelsea (professional, 1.7.19); 11.1.19 Yeovil Town (loan) [8,0]; 8.8.19 Plymouth Argyle (loan) [17+5,0]; 18.7.20 Bristol Rovers (free) [51+4,4].\n\nYeovil Town were in their final Football League season when a young defensive midfielder featured alongside Alfie Santos in a 1-0 victory against Mansfield Town at Field Mill in January 2019; it was Josh Grant’s first League appearance. During the following campaign, the Londoner helped Plymouth gain promotion from League Two, playing alongside Dom Telford and Byron Moore in a team captained by Gary Sawyer. Plymouth in fact played Rovers three times that campaign, Grant appearing in all three, a Football League Trophy tie and two FA Cup clashes ultimately decided by Alex Rodman’s winner at Home Park in a game in which Argyle fielded three unrelated players with the surname Grant. A prodigy at Chelsea, Grant had played in 24 youth games in 2014-15 before captaining the side the following season to the South-West Section title and success in the FA Youth Cup; he was named Chelsea Scholar of the Year. Armed with six caps for England at Under-18 level, he won four Under-20 caps at the 2017 Toulon Tournament, helping England defeat the Ivory Coast in the final and followed this up with thirty games in 2017-18 for Chelsea’s Under-19 side. His last-minute goal against Porto in the semi-final secured a UEFA Youth League Final against Barcelona, which was lost, and Grant also played in 6(+3) League Trophy games for Chelsea Under-21, scoring seven minutes from the end of a 3-1 victory at Exeter City in November 2017, a game in which he played alongside England winger Callum Hudson-Odoi as well as Kylian Hazard. Josh Grant slotted into Rovers’ League side at the start of the 2020-21 campaign and registered the final League goal of Ben Garner’s stint as Rovers manager, a consolation goal in the demoralising 4-1 home defeat to Fleetwood in November 2020, but missed the end of the season through injury. He was to score again twelve months later, the winning goal at home to Northampton Town and was on the field as Rovers secured a dramatic final-day promotion to League One, in defeating already-relegated Scunthorpe United 7-0 at The Mem. However, the following campaign he managed just one substitute appearance, in a 1-0 home victory over Oxford United in the August sunshine, before being ruled out for the rest of the season with a knee operation.\n\nNo 380. Raymond Jack Graydon. 1965-71.\n\nBorn, 21.7.1947, Frenchay, Bristol.\n\n5’ 7”; 11 st 5 lbs.\n\nDébut: 25.9.65 v Swansea City.\n\nCareer: Greenbank School; Begbrook and Beechcroft; Hambrook; June 1963 Bristol Rovers (professional, 22.9.65) [131+2,33]; 26.5.71 Aston Villa (£25,000, plus Brian Godfrey) [188+4,68]; 2.7.77 Coventry City [17+3,5]; March 1978 Washington Diplomats [26,4]; November 1978 Oxford United (£32,000) [36+6,10] (youth team manager, December 1980; coach, 8.5.81; assistant manager, July 1986); 28.3.88 Watford (youth coach); 1989 Southampton (reserve team manager); 6.7.96 Queen’s Park Rangers (technical co-ordinator of youth football); 6.4.98 Port Vale (coach); 14.5.98 Walsall (manager); 26.4.02 Bristol Rovers (manager); 8.3.04 Shanghai Shenhua, China (coach); 20.2.06 Leicester City (coach, to May 2006).\n\n“Powerful runs and scorching shots” (Don Veale) were the trademark of searing runner and talented winger Ray Graydon, who used his career with Rovers as a springboard to further success before returning to manage his home-town club. An apprentice electrician and store-man living in Stapleton and an England cap at Youth and Under-18 level, he became a regular in Rovers’ side in the late 1960s after making the breakthrough as a teenager. Second highest scorer in both 1969-70 and 1970-71 behind Robin Stubbs, registering thirteen League goals both seasons, the fair-haired, raiding winger scored twice in games at Reading, after three and 43 minutes, and Shrewsbury as well as at home to Bury and Bournemouth. Ray Graydon’s two brothers, Mark and Alan, both also played for Hambrook; they were the sons of local footballer William Graydon and his wife Violet Guest, who had married in Bristol in 1941; in his turn, William was the son of the former Bath City player Bill Graydon and his wife Lilly Bridle, whilst Violet’s parents were Harold Guest and Maria Western. Success at Eastville led to further glory whilst at Villa Park. Villa were Division Three champions in 1971-72 and Graydon top scored as promotion to first-tier football was achieved in 1974-75, scoring on Boxing Day 1974 in one of four appearances for Villa against his former club. He also added a hat-trick in the 3-0 victory over Millwall in September 1974 and contributed twelve goals in the top flight in 1975-76. Known for his speed and ability to cross the ball on the run, he scored the only goal of the 1975 League Cup Final, knocking home the rebound after Norwich City’s Kevin Keelan had saved his penalty and won this tournament in both 1975 and 1977 with Villa and in 1986 at Oxford. He also scored in European football, claiming the consolation goal as Antwerp were successful 5-1 on aggregate in a UEFA Cup-tie in September 1975 and his time at Villa Park led to his induction in Birmingham’s Broad Street Walk of Stars, alongside Frank Skinner and Ozzy Osbourne. During a stint in the States, Graydon scored a début goal in a 3-0 victory at Philadelphia Fury and marked the former Rovers central defender Graham Day as Diplomats played Portland Timbers in the semi-final of the Championship play-offs. As a coach, Graydon was in charge of the Watford side, including David James and Jason Drysdale, which secured the 1989 FA Youth Cup, led Walsall to two promotions and a 4-3 win at The Mem in October 1998 and worked under Howard Wilkinson in China. He will also be remembered by Rovers’ supporters for his two years at the helm after the Pirates had dropped into the basement division, during which time he was unable to deliver the hope of a swift return to League One. Now a Premier League referees’ supervisor, Ray Graydon lives in Southampton; he and his wife Sue, married for over forty years, have a son, a daughter and two grandchildren.\n\nNo 690. Giuliano Stefano Luigi Grazioli. 2002-03.\n\nBorn, 23.3.1975, Marylebone.\n\n5’ 11”; 12 st 11 lbs.\n\nDébut: 10.8.02 v Torquay United.\n\nCareer: Finchley Catholic High School; 1992 Wembley (professional, 1.8.95); 19.10.95 Peterborough United (free) [23+17,16]; 1.11.95 Yeovil Town (loan); February 1996 Enfield (loan); 14.10.96 Woking (loan); 23.12.97 Stevenage Borough (loan); 17.6.99 Swindon Town (free) [45+33,18]; 1.7.02 Bristol Rovers (free) [28+6,11]; 1.7.03 Barnet (exchange deal with Junior Agogo) [27+2,7]; 7.9.07 AFC Wimbledon (loan); 31.7.08 Crawley Town (trial); 10.8.08 Braintree Town; 1.11.08 Dover Athletic; 4.6.09 Bristol Rovers (scout; Community Development Officer, 7.4.10); 24.3.11 Barnet (8.4.11 caretaker manager; 13.5.11 assistant manager, to 16.4.12); 9.9.12 Gillingham (scout); 2016 Leicester City (fitness coach).\n\nIn September 1998, Peterborough United travelled to Barnet for a Third Division game and won 9-1, this unusual score-line being largely down to five goals from their young striker Giuliano Grazioli. Incredibly, Grazioli then became a hero at the victims of his goal-scoring spree, Barnet, scoring 53 goals in 74 Conference games to earn their return to League football in 2005 as champions, twelve points clear of Hereford United, then being the caretaker manager as they engineered a remarkable final-day escape from relegation in the spring of 2011. He had also played against Rovers in August 2005 in Barnet’s first game back in the Football League, hit the woodwork twice at The Mem in the return fixture and played against Manchester United in the League Cup. Born in London to a father from Parma and a mother from Turin, “Graz” scored in his first two games for Rovers and was top-scorer for the club in 2002-03 before leaving the professional game to pursue further education. Signed by John Still at Peterborough, Grazioli scored as a substitute débutant on his twenty-first birthday before missing fourteen months with a foot injury. He scored seven times in six Conference games on loan at Stevenage, six in five matches at Woking and, impressively, nineteen in thirteen with Yeovil. He also, as a team-mate of Simon Stapleton, scored for the Stevenage side which drew 1-1 with Newcastle United in the FA Cup in January 1998, before losing the replay 2-1. Despite his excellent overhead kick goal against QPR in March 2000, he suffered relegation to Division Two that campaign at Swindon, where he played alongside Wayne Carlisle. At Barnet, hat-tricks against Halifax and Leigh RMI in the 2003-04 season, when he was playing alongside Chris Plummer and Lewis Hogg and was named in the Non-League XI squad, preceded Grazioli’s nomination as Player of the Season in the Conference in 2004-05, during which time he scored a first-half hat-trick as Farnborough Town were defeated 7-1. At Wembley in 2007 to watch Rovers get promoted, he then played against the Pirates in the FA Cup in January 2008, scored in his sole appearance on trial with Crawley and subsequently scored twice in twenty games for Dover, during which time his wife Laura gave birth to twins.\n\nNo 412. Michael Clive Green. 1971-74.\n\nBorn, 8.9.1946, Carlisle.\n\n6’ 1”; 12 st 4 lbs.\n\nDébut: 14.8.71 v York City.\n\nCareer: Cumbria Schoolboys; Carlisle United (professional, September 1964) [2,0]; July 1968 Gillingham [131+1,24]; 5.7.71 Bristol Rovers (free) [74+3,2]; 22.7.74 Plymouth Argyle (£19,000) [108,8]; 8.3.77 Torquay United (£5,000) (player-manager) [88,7]; August 1981 Newton Abbot; August 1984 Hele Rovers (to 1987).\n\nHaving captained Rovers to promotion from Division Three in 1973-74, Mike Green did exactly the same with Argyle the following campaign. It was an extraordinary achievement for the young defender and showed the strength of his mental approach to the game as well as his undeniable leadership qualities. During his first extended run in the Rovers side, the team had recorded five straight League victories. Following a 5-0 victory over Bristol City on his Carlisle début in September 1965, he had played against Rovers on five occasions in Gillingham’s colours before arriving at Eastville. A Watney Cup winner in 1972, he was appointed club captain, playing in the historic 8-2 victory at Brighton in December 1973 and even replacing the injured Jim Eadie in goal against Port Vale in February 1974 as Rovers, unbeaten in 32 games at one stage, regained their second-flight status. He also scored that season, with a header from Colin Dobson’s left-wing free-kick nine minutes from the close of a 1-1 draw at Oldham in November 1973. An accomplished defender, he scored in Rovers’ 2-0 home victory over Wrexham in September 1972 and in the 1-1 draw at Oldham in November 1973. He returned to Eastville with the Plymouth side that drew 1-1 in a Second Division fixture in October 1976. Green married June, who worked at Marks and Spencer in Broadmead and they lived at this stage in Nailsea with their pet Labrador, Adam. Captain at Home Park, Green again helped his side to promotion, his subsequent three games against Rovers preceding a stint as player-manager at Plainmoor. Having briefly run a fish-and-chip shop in Cornwall, he ran Sherwell Road Post Office in Torquay from 1982, whilst living in St Catherine’s Road.\n\nNo 498. Ronald Rex Green. 1984-86.\n\nBorn, 3.10.1956, Birmingham.\n\n6’ 2”; 12 st 10 lbs.\n\nDébut: 2.3.85 v Hull City.\n\nCareer: Alvechurch Town; June 1977 Walsall (£2,000); 31.8.79 Scunthorpe United (loan); 15.3.84 West Bromwich Albion (loan); 2.6.84 Shrewsbury Town (£12,500); 1.3.85 Bristol Rovers (loan); 22.6.85 Bristol Rovers (£15,000) [56,0]; 21.8.86 Scunthorpe United (£12,000) [78,0]; August 1988 Wimbledon [4,0]; 30.9.88 Shrewsbury Town (loan) [36,0]; December 1988 Manchester City (loan); 23.3.89 Walsall (free) [230,0]; May 1991 Alvechurch Town; August 1991 Kidderminster Harriers; November 1992 Colchester United [4,0]; December 1992 football in Hong Kong; January 1993 Bromsgrove Rovers; July 1994 Cambridge United (trial); July 1994 Shrewsbury Town (trial); July 1994 Walsall (trial); August 1994 Hereford United (trial); August 1994 Redditch United; 1995 Moor Green; 1996 Oldbury United; Coventry City (Community Officer).\n\nFive consecutive clean sheets through March 1985 endeared goalkeeper Ron Green to Rovers’ supporters and helped stave off the increasingly remote threat of relegation. Tall and agile, Green had been in the Walsall side which conceded four goals at Eastville in February 1984 amongst three games for the Saddlers against Rovers, and his three appearances for Rovers against Walsall included the 6-0 thrashing in March 1986. Often in a side leaking goals, Green also had the misfortune to be between the sticks when Rovers crashed 6-1 at Bournemouth in October 1985 and an injury at Lincoln in April 1986 caused him to be replaced between the sticks by striker Trevor Morgan. He lived in Clevedon for his year on Rovers’ books. Green’s two spells at Walsall included promotion in 1979-80, a season as an ever-present in 1981-82 and a League Cup semi-final against Liverpool in February 1984, before he played in Scunthorpe’s narrow 3-2 defeat at White Hart Lane in the FA Cup in January 1987. Scunthorpe missed out on promotion to Division Three by one point in the spring of 1988, before losing to Torquay in the play-offs, after which Green played in 40 Conference games for Kidderminster and in 32 Beazer Homes League fixtures with Moor Green. Latterly, he played alongside Peter Cawley in the Colchester side which drew 4-4 with Rochdale in November 1992. He had been selected to represent a Non-League XI against the British Students XI in November 1991. The eldest of three children to Rex Green and Dorothy Terry, Ron Green is married to Maureen with two sons and a daughter, and now works for the Royal Mail.\n\nNo 751.

Green, the youngest Welsh cap and the man whose goal took Hereford back into League football, was a popular figure with Rovers, who recovered from a foot injury to star at Wembley and then suffered a broken jaw in November 2007. In fact, the son of a Merthyr striker, Phil Green, he had won full international honours before appearing in the League, his first of two Welsh caps being awarded in the summer of 1998 against Malta when he was still seventeen, breaking Ryan Giggs’ national record, although Green’s has also since been surpassed; he also won sixteen caps for Wales Under-21. A Wolves début alongside Keith Curle against his future club Sheffield Wednesday in November 1998 preceded a red card at West Brom in October 2000, he suffered relegation to Division Two with Wednesday and, unable to make Cardiff’s League side, Green played alongside Martyn Margetson in their 3-0 Football League Trophy victory at Exeter in November 2002. A team-mate at Edgar Street of Alex Jeannin and Guy Ipoua, he played in 185(+10) games in the Conference and Football League for Hereford in two spells, including a 7-1 win at Forest Green Rovers in December 2003 and a 9-0 victory at Dagenham in February 2004, but being sent off in his first spell on two occasions, both against Tamworth. Having lost out in play-offs two seasons in succession, Hereford were promoted back to the Football League in May 2006 by beating Halifax Town after extra-time at the Walker’s Stadium, Green firing home the winning goal after 108 minutes. Once back at Edgar Street, he played for the Bulls at the Memorial Stadium in August 2011, but was unable to prevent his side losing their hard-fought League status in 2012. During his second spell at Edgar Street, Green had scored at Macclesfield and at Cheltenham, but had been sent off at Rochdale, Shrewsbury and Lincoln. In two seasons with Port Talbot Town, he appeared in 52(+2) Welsh League fixtures, scoring a last-minute goal in the 6-1 drubbing of Afan Lido in December 2012. His 39 appearances, as Merthyr secured the Southern League First Division title, included goals against Clevedon Town and Taunton Town, and he appeared in their first three games of the following campaign before being sent off during Hereford’s FA Vase match at Hartley Witney in February 2016. Hereford, managed by the former Rovers striker Peter Beadle, were Midland League champions in 2015-16, Green playing in 44 matches in that division, and reached the FA Vase Final, where they were defeated 4-1 at Wembley by Morpeth Town. The following campaign, he was sent off in both Southern League fixture with Didcot Town, the away game in March 2017 being abandoned when there was a pitch invasion two minutes from time, He was also sent off against Evesham United, but played in 38 Southern League First Division matches as Hereford ran away with the title, accumulating 107 points and 108 goals in the process. In 365 matches with Hereford, he scored nine goals, was sent off nine times and was named as the club’s Player of the Year in 2017-18 when, under his captaincy, the Bulls won their third successive promotion. He was awarded a testimonial match in July 2019, when Hereford took on a Wolves Under-23 side. Ryan Green lives near Cardiff with his girlfriend Hannah. Green suffered an Achilles injury whilst playing for Westfields at Long Eaton in an FA VBase tie in April 2021, his game against Hereford Pegasus in August 2022 marking a return to the side after an sixteen-month absence.\n\nNo 465. Ashley Russell Griffiths. 1979-81.\n\nBorn, 5.1.1961, Barry.\n\n5’ 9”; 10 st 6 lbs.\n\nDébut: 3.5.80 v West Ham United.\n\nCareer: St Cadoc’s School, Barry; Barry Schools; July 1977 Bristol Rovers (professional, January 1979) [6+1,0]; 28.6.81 Torquay United; 28.7.81 Yeovil Town; 20.3.82 Gloucester City (free); July 1982 Enfield Town (trial); July 1982 Leytonstone and Ilford (trial); March 1983 Barry Town; 15.12.90 Newport County; 1991 Barry Town; 1992 Inter Cardiff; 1993 Barry Town (assistant manager, 24.11.04); 21.8.05 Barry FC.\n\nCaptaining Rovers reserves at the age of sixteen, Ashley Griffiths won Welsh Schoolboy and Youth caps and hit the post on his début as West Ham warmed up for the 1980 FA Cup Final, where they defeated Arsenal at Wembley through Trevor Brooking’s early close-range header. He added 36 games and six goals for Rovers’ reserve side the following campaign, whilst making sporadic first-team appearances and later added one goal in 33 games at Gloucester. Sent off on his Yeovil début, a 2-0 home defeat against Gravesend in August 1981, he also scored an own goal against Dagenham the following month. Between his début in a 4-0 victory over Caerleon in February 1983 and 1989, he scored 21 goals in 177(+4) appearances as Barry won the Welsh League in six out of seven seasons, scored in the Welsh League Cup Final of 1983 and captained Barry in the Southern League in 1989-90, scoring once in 38 matches. He later added 41 games and a goal with Newport and six goals in 36 matches with Inter Cardiff before returning to Barry to play in the 1996 Welsh Cup Final, which was lost on penalties to Llansantffraid and secure the Welsh League title again in 1995-96. He also represented Wales against England in a semi-professional international played at Newtown during the 1983-84 campaign. When the Barry club split in 2005, the veteran Griffiths, now living in Cliffwood View, Barry, scored the new side’s first ever goal with a seventeenth-minute penalty against Ragged School. A keen tennis player in his youth, who won a major Under-15 tournament in Swansea, Ashley Griffiths was named after the Australian tennis player, Ashley Cooper (1936-2020), by his sports-mad parents, Michael Griffiths, a former Villa and Newport reserve player, and Dulcie Stacey, the seventh of nine children to William Stacey and Violet Perrett. Currently a social worker in Bridgend, he is married to Gaynor Matthews and has two children, two step-children and several grandchildren.\n\nNo 585. Andrew Robert Gurney. 1993-97.\n\nBorn, 25.1.1974, Bristol.\n\n5’ 9”; 10 st 7 lbs.\n\nDébut: 2.4.94 v Reading.\n\nCareer: Marlwood School; Northavon Schools; Yate Town; Kingsmead; St Valier; Bristol Rovers (professional, 10.7.92) [100+8,9]; 15.1.93 Weymouth (loan); 7.7.97 Torquay United (trial); 7.10.97 Torquay United (free) [44,9]; 13.1.99 Reading (£100,000) [5+3,0]; 21.6.01 Swindon Town (free); 31.8.04 Swansea City (free) [25+3,1]; 26.8.05 Swindon Town (loan); 18.1.06 Swindon Town (free) [158+4,23]; 28.12.06 Clevedon Town; 22.2.07 Weston-super-Mare; 25.5.07 Havant and Waterlooville; 22.12.07 Weston-super-Mare; 12.2.08 Newport County; 30.5.08 Weston-super-Mare (manager, 2.2.09); 1.8.10 Mangotsfield United; 13.12.10 Bridgwater Town; 2012 Flowerpot Wanderers; 24.10.14 Roman Glass St George (player-manager).\n\nStrong, dependable full-back and central defender Andy Gurney made his League bow in David Pritchard’s absence in a 2-0 defeat against his future club, Reading. A keen snooker player brought up in Pilning and later in Stoke Gifford, Gurney was captain of Rovers’ youth side and scored in home fixtures with Peterborough in consecutive seasons as well as the opening goal, after eight minutes, before conceding a penalty as Bradford City were defeated 3-2 in October 1995. The Supporters’ Club Young Player of the Year for 1994-95, he was also sent off against Stockport in March 1995, after 59 minutes at York that September and in conceding a 64th-minute penalty from which the experienced Bobby Davison scored at Hull in January 1996. A Wembley appearance in May 1995, although Rovers lost 2-1 to Huddersfield in a play-off final, with Gurney hitting his own crossbar at one stage with an attempted clearance, was counter-balanced by the demoralising 2-1 FA Cup defeat that autumn at Hitchin Town. He was also sent off in Rovers’ colours on four occasions in an eighteen-month spell. A goal after just nine minutes of his Torquay début, the first goal Macclesfield ever conceded in the Football League, kick-started a season in which the Gulls lost to Colchester United in a Wembley play-off final, Gurney’s second successive such experience. Top scorer at Plainmoor in his first season, he was then sent off in the autumn of 1998 against Cambridge United and at Barnet and soon left for Reading. Whilst Gurney’s Rovers début had been against the Royals, so too was his Reading début against Rovers, Jamie Cureton and Jason Roberts spoiling his day as Rovers ran up six goals after half-time to win 6-0 at the Madejski Stadium. He scored League goals for the Royals against Oldham Athletic, Brentford and Cambridge United. Sent off for Swindon at Bournemouth and Plymouth, his missed penalty handed a play-off tie to Brighton and with Swansea he was dismissed in a 5-1 win at Kidderminster and booked against Rovers in November 2004. Alongside Ijah Anderson, Lee Thorpe and Kevin Austin with the Swans, where his only goal came in a 2-2 draw with Rochdale in March 2005, Gurney enjoyed promotion to League One with Swansea in 2004-05, only to suffer relegation with Swindon the following campaign, where he played alongside Jerel Ifil, Sammy Igoe and Rory Fallon. A member of the Havant side which won 1-0 away to Notts County in an FA Cup shock in December 2007, he scored five times in 21 games for Weston and suffered relegation from the Conference South in the spring of 2008. He also added two goals in eight matches at Clevedon and nine in 28 with Newport County. The veteran Gurney showed he had not lost his touch, though, by scoring an excellent trademark free-kick as Bridgwater won 2-1 at Wimborne Town in January 2011 and added a hat-trick as Flowerpot defeated Lebeq Tavern in March 2014. St George, under his management, finished third from bottom of the Toolstation Western League Division One in 2014-15 and he even appeared as an emergency goalkeeper in a 2-0 defeat at Calne Town in the Toolstation League in April 2016. He works alongside his father in a car delivery service.\n\nNo 714. Lewis Oliver Haldane. 2003-08.\n\nBorn, 13.3.1985, Trowbridge.\n\n6’; 11 st 3 lbs.\n\nDébut: 27.9.03 v Cheltenham Town.\n\nCareer: Southampton (schoolboy); Trowbridge Town; 1.7.02 Bristol Rovers [90+57,15]; 2.4.03 Weston-super-Mare (trial); July 2003 Clevedon Town (trial); 30.3.05 Forest Green Rovers (loan); 12.8.05 Forest Green Rovers (loan); 8.7.08 Oxford United (loan); 1.9.09 Port Vale (loan); 27.1.10 Port Vale (free) [43+20,3]; 2.8.13 Yate Town (free); 7.11.14 Frome Town (free); 3.1.16 Yate Town (free; retired, 12.9.16).\n\nA Wiltshire winger at Under-12, Under-13 and Under-14 level, Lewis Haldane won a Welsh Under-21 cap in the goalless draw with Turkey in September 2006. Fast and incisive, he had the crowd on its collective feet, although he also had a tendency to try to beat his man repeatedly. A hat-trick against Oxford United reserves prompted a League call-up seven days later and, on as substitute for the final five minutes of his début, he was fouled by Shane Higgs to earn a penalty. Haldane scored in three consecutive games in October 2003, the first after 61 minutes at Doncaster, and added Rovers’ goal of the month that November, with a twenty-five-yard strike in front of the South Stand to give the side a short-lived lead at home to Bury, whilst his final-minute goal sealed victory in the LDV Vans Trophy semi-final against Orient in 2004-05. Out of favour under Ian Atkins, he appeared 9(+4) times for a Forest Green side only spared relegation when others stumbled financially, and his long-range strike at home to Notts County in March 2006 was his first League goal in over two years. Haldane’s revival encompassed games at the Millennium Stadium, as Rovers lost the Johnstone’s Paint Trophy Final 3-2 to Doncaster Rovers in April 2007, and at Wembley the following month, Rovers sealing promotion to League One by defeating Shrewsbury Town 3-1. He also played in the FA Cup quarter-final against West Brom in March 2008, although his only goal of the 2007-08 season was a last-minute header against Millwall, the first headed goal of his career. With Chris Carruthers at Oxford, he scored the Conference Goal of the Month for September 2008, accumulating 34(+9) Conference games and three goals before re-booting his career at Vale Park. Haldane “gets the crowd off their seats”, boasted the Stoke Sentinel and, appearing alongside Sean Rigg and Justin Richards, he played in Vale’s 5-0 win at Chesterfield in March 2010 and was sent off against Hereford United. \"Lewis is a confidence player, the type who needs people to have belief in him ... quick, but he's not the finished article. His final ball lets him down at times but when he is in full flow he can be quite exciting\", said Vale’s manager Micky Adams. Hospitalised for ten days in July 2010 after an insect bite at pre-season training, Haldane lost three stone in weight and, on his return, a double fracture of the leg against Tranmere Rovers necessitated his retirement from professional football. A testimonial game at The Mem in May 2013 saw Rovers’ Under-18 side beat Rovers Legends 3-0, an 800 crowd raising £3,000. He subsequently scored the winning goal against Wimborne Town in Yate’s first home game of the 2013-14 campaign and was top scorer at the club with thirty goals in 38 Southern League appearances during 2013-14. Ten goals followed in 39(+5) Southern League Premier Division matches with Frome Town, prior to a return to Yate Town, before a broken leg prompted his retirement. Lewis Haldane lives since January 2013 in Chippenham with his girlfriend Michelle, a beautician, and their young daughter Indianna and works in Bristol for a lorry components company.\n\nNo 361. Bernard Raymond Hall. 1961-67.\n\nBorn, 8.7.1942, Bath.\n\n5’ 9”; 11 st 2 lbs.\n\nDébut: 20.4.62 v Charlton Athletic.\n\nCareer: West Twerton Youth Club; 1958 Bristol Rovers (professional, 2.9.59) [163,0]; 6.4.59 Salisbury City (loan) (retired, 1967).\n\nFifty-four minutes into Rovers’ game with Middlesbrough on New Year’s Eve 1966, talented goalkeeper Bernard Hall collided accidentally with Boro’s John O’Rourke and was carried from the Eastville pitch. For sixteen days he lay unconscious in Frenchay Hospital, before recovering, although his footballing career was ended on medical grounds. Courageous and strong, Hall had previously appeared in 115 consecutive League fixtures for Rovers, being an ever-present in both 1963-64 and 1965-66, and his reputation was such that a testimonial against West Ham drew a 9,000 crowd in October 1967. Harry Redknapp and Geoff Hurst both scoring as the Hammers defeated a Combined Bristol XI 4-3. The second of five sons to Kenneth Hall and Violet Hancock, Bernard Hall had captained Somerset Schools at cricket, as an accomplished wicketkeeper and opening batsman, and he had a Sunday average of 77.25 in 1964 with St George as well as scoring a century for Optimists against Clevedon. Yet it was at football that “this brave, fearless goalkeeper” excelled, signing for Rovers at a transport café in Pens"
