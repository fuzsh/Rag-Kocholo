        "text": "Netta Franklin was born in 1866 into one of the leading British Jewish families. Her father, the banker Samuel Montagu MP, became the first Lord Swaythling in 1907. He founded the Federation of Synagogues, which brought into one organisation the chevras – small synagogues – established in the East End of London by refugees from Czarist Russia.\n\nBrought up in a very Orthodox home, Netta joined her younger sister Lily in founding a Liberal Jewish movement in Britain. In 1902 Netta hosted in London the first ever meeting of the Jewish Religious Union for the Advancement of Liberal Judaism. This movement saw Judaism as evolving and progressing, and emphasised the ethical teaching of the Hebrew prophets.\n\nNetta became a national figure in the campaign for political rights for women. She was elected President of the National Union of Women’s Suffrage Societies in 1916. She once declared: “Judaism has taught the world to do justice…they had no right to be here at all, unless they tried to make the world better.”\n\nThe main cause in Netta’s life was educational reform. She became the secretary of the Parents’ National Educational Union, a post she held for 70 years. Despite having a disability, she undertook speaking tours across USA, Europe and South Africa.\n\nNetta’s connections with Co. Donegal can still be seen today. Glenalla House, near Milford, is an 18th century home set in 250 acres of beautiful grounds which she and her family acquired in 1913. The garden is described as “a hidden world surrounded by native woods and moorland.\" The grounds include the rockery, rose beds, arbour and a stone edged lily pond which Netta helped develop and loved.\n\nThere is a curious PS to the story. In 2017, 15 rabbis of the Federation of Synagogues in London – the organisation founded by Netta's father, Lord Swaythling – held a two-day retreat at Glenalla.\n\nDo you want to know more? A biography of Netta was written by the Irish writer, Monk Gibbon, but it was published in 1960 and is long out of print. She also has an entry in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography and of course on Wikipedia.\n\nStephen Poliakoff, playwright and Netta's great nephew: \"I was once taken to visit Netta at her house in Donegal, a sleepy Chekhovian sort of place, where I had to read prayers to her in English as she consumed artichokes — which I'd never seen before — for breakfast. She was very formidable; she even had a wooden leg\".\n\nSteven Jaffe\n\nThe Jewish community in Londonderry was established in 1893. A number of Jewish families gathered at the home of Mr Welsky at 17 Harvey Street and agreed to form themselves into a congregation under the authority of the Chief Rabbi in London.\n\nBy the following year, the first synagogue was opened at 18 Abercorn Road. There were about 43 Jews living in the city. By 1901 a Zionist group was founded. For a number of years the synagogue was in rented premises on Hawkin Street.\n\nFamily names included Robinson (originally Rubinstein), Edelstein, Harris, Frieslander, Ruben, Jacobs, Watchman, Watson, Gay, Caplan and Tuck.\n\nThe late Trevor Danker said: “Life in Derry revolved around the shool (synagogue). All families lived within a few minutes walk from Hawkin Street.” The Dankers, with six adult males, often secured the minyan, the quorum of ten men needed for communal worship.\n\nIn 1929 a new synagogue was acquired at 4 Kennedy Place. The Jews of Derry, being \"poor hard working men\" appealed to the readers of the Jewish Chronicle to help them meet the costs of converting the building.\n\nThe late teacher Fred Logan recalled: “These Russian Jews were very orthodox. They observed Saturday as their holy day and worshipped in the synagogue every week...I know this because I was teaching in First Derry School, and all the Jewish children attended school there largely because it was more or less in the centre of the Jewish quarter. They settled around the Bishop Street, Fountain Street and Abercorn Road area.”\n\nHere are some of the characters who made up the community...\n\nBy 1917 David Spain, a native of Kovno (today Kaunas, Lithuania) had become President of the congregation. He manufactured mattresses and lived on Abercorn Road. He died in Derry in 1971, aged 93. He was remembered for his “single-minded piety and uprightness”. David's wife Ray kept a home which was \"an oasis of Jewish traditional life,\" in a city separated by over 70 miles from the nearest Jewish centre (in Belfast).\n\nCecil Bloch was born in Londonderry in 1908. He claimed descent from generations of Lithuanian rabbis. He went into the ministry and served congregations in Manchester and Portsmouth, was an army chaplain in Burma and Malaya, and after the war was minister in Swansea and South East London.\n\nA well-known local personality was Michael Fredlander, who was a horse breeder and owned a stud farm in Eglinton. Ephraim Gordon is said to have set up the Empire Picture Frame Works in Newmarket Street as early as 1860 (but it was probably later than that). Nat Gordon owned the Art Shop in Bishop Street, and his son, Richard Gordon, until recently ran the Gordon Gallery at Pump Street.\n\nLudwig Schenkel, along with his brother Paul, left Vienna in 1938 just before the Anschluss – Hitler’s invasion of Austria – with 10 shillings between them. Paul eventually moved to England and Ludwig remained in Derry, joining cultural and social groups. He set up a leather bag and umbrella-making business, but his recreational passion was the new Kodachrome colour film. Over the next 40 years he took thousands of photographs in both Derry and Donegal where he had a holiday home. Schenkel’s legacy is an important collection of images which have been restored and reflect not just the landscape, sea and sky, but the spirit of local life in the countryside. He left a large collection of photographs of the North West of Ireland and an equally large collection of cacti which went to the Botanic Gardens in Belfast.\n\nDuring the war the Jewish population rose to over one hundred. Refugees from Nazi persecution found work in the shirt factories. Amongst those who assisted their arrival were Professor Thomas Finnegan, president of Magee College, and Archie Halliday, who ran a private business school.\n\nOne of the refugees was Otto Goldberger, a proud Austrian who swam for his country in international competitions. After Kristallnacht, in November 1938, he was being lined up to be sent to a concentration camp, when he noticed the Nazi officer in charge had gone to school with him. He dared to step out of line. The officer angrily ordered Goldberger to stand with his face to the wall. For what seemed like hours Otto heard the lorries coming and going taking people away. The officer eventually came back and told him to leave Vienna immediately. His sister Freda had already escaped and was working in a place called Londonderry, which Otto believed was a suburb of London. Otto got a job at Faulkner's shirt factory. He was later a much-loved member of the Belfast Jewish community and a strong supporter of the Ulster Orchestra.\n\nThe last minister of the congregation, Rev. Heshel (Harris) Freeman, left Derry by 1946. The final service is believed to have taken place on Yom Kippur in 1947. The congregation’s Sepher Torah (scroll of the law) was donated to a synagogue in Rechovot, Israel, and the balance of funds went to support the new synagogue at Kibbutz Lavi in the Galilee.\n\nIn 2013 the former synagogue building at Kennedy Place collapsed. It had been derelict for many years. Fortunately no one was hurt.\n\nIf you would like to know more about the Jews of Derry-Londonderry:\n\nThe JCR UK web site has a page on the former Londonderry Hebrew congregation, compiled by David Shulman and Steven Jaffe. Assistance was provided by Philippa Robinson.\n\nAn excellent article on Ludwig Schenkel by Sean Beattie features in the 2021 edition of Due North, the journal of the Federation of Ulster Local Studies. A war-time refugee, Ludwig spent the rest of his life in Derry and was prominent in its commercial, social and cultural life. See also Ludwig Schenkel's remarkable story recounted in Ken McCormack's Derry, Vol Two: The Blackbird and the Canary (Colmcille Press, £10).\n\nTrevor Danker's warm article on the Jews of Derry was published in the Belfast Jewish Record, October 1960. It is available on line, courtesy of Queen's University Belfast,Special Collections.\n\nPatrick Comerford, an Anglican priest from Dublin, has blogged about the Derry community here.\n\nSteven Jaffe\n\nBrigadier General Ambrose Ricardo was born in 1866, a great grandson of David Ricardo the famous economist. He was of Sephardic Jewish descent - meaning his ancestors were Jews who lived in Spain in the Middle Ages. The Sephardi Jews comprised the leading Jewish community in Medieval Europe for both learning and culture.\n\nThe expulsion of the Jews from Spain in 1492 was described as the biggest disaster to have befallen the Jewish people since the capture of Jerusalem by the Romans. It took place in the year Columbus set sail across the Atlantic.\n\nThe Ricardo family took up residence in Italy and then Amsterdam where there was a large congregation of Sephardi exiles. In the eighteenth century family members had moved to England and prospered. Ambrose grew up at Gatcombe Park in Gloucestershire, now the home of the Princess Royal (Princess Anne). His family had long relinquished its Judaism by the time of his birth.\n\nRicardo served in the Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers and saw service in India and during the Boer War.\n\nHis marriage in 1893 to Elizabeth Alice Herdman (in Burma) led Ricardo to later retire from military life. In about 1904 he took up the post of Director of Herdman’s Ltd. in Sion Mills. The Herdmans founded the village in 1835 and established a flax spinning mill there. The name Sion is derived from the Irish ‘Sidhean’ meaning fairy mound. However, the Herdmans were very religious and may have wished to associate their model village with establishing a \"new Zion\" in the north west of Ulster.\n\nAmbrose Ricardo went on to co-found the annual Londonderry Feis (an arts and cultural festival). He was instrumental in the building of the eye-catching Church of the Good Shepherd in Sion Mills. He was a senior layman in the Church of Ireland and was to lead the Scout movement in Ulster. He was also president of the North West cricket union.\n\nDuring the third Home Rule Crisis (1912 to 1914) Brigadier Ricardo helped recruit, train and arm a unionist militia in Co. Tyrone opposed to home rule. Following the outbreak of World War I, he is said to have recruited 130 men from the Tyrone village and surrounding areas who were to fight at the battle of the Somme in 1916.\n\nBrigadier General Ricardo died in 1923. The circumstances of his death - he was found drowned in a reservoir near the village - gave rise to concern that he had committed suicide. He was known to have felt the heavy burden of surviving the war when many of the men he led had been killed.\n\nIn 2019 a blue plaque was unveiled by the Ulster History Circle at the stables in Sion Mills commemorating Ambrose Ricardo's life as \"a soldier, philanthropist and founder of the Londonderry Feis\".\n\nThis story is adapted from an article by Stephen Nimmons in the on-line Times of Israel (2013).\n\nAmbrose Ricardo is the subject of this edition of the BBC Radio Ulster podcast, Your Place and Mine. Anne Marie McAleese is in conversation with Ricardo's great niece, Celia Ferguson.\n\nIn 1938 Maurice Komjat, at the age of 40, with his wife Clara and daughter Eve, left Budapest, where antisemitism was on the rise. He’d been a textile manufacturer.\n\nThe Daintifyt Brassiere Company Ltd was registered in Belfast in January 1940 as \"manufacturers, buyers, sellers, importers and exporters of and dealers in corsets, brassieres, underwear and garments of all kinds\" with Maurice Komjat and Lazslo Horvath as directors. They started production in College Street, Belfast before moving to a garage in Cookstown in May 1941 because of the wartime bombing.\n\nDuring the war years the Daintifyt premises and production expanded. The family also actively supported many local fund-raising causes including The Tyrone Warship Week. Maurice was also on the Cookstown War Savings Committee. The family was very involved with the social life of Cookstown, including the chess and bridge clubs.\n\nIn December, 1944 Daintifyt formally opened a Social Club & Canteen in the presence of local dignitaries – bringing in a \"new era in the social life of workers in provincial towns\". 160 workers were employed at the time, mostly female. In March 1945, the factory was visited by Lady Montgomery (mother of General Montgomery) . She was \"highly pleased\" with the staff facilities. A donation of £29 7s. 6d. to the Eighth Army Comforts fund, collected by the workers, was presented to her.\n\nIn July 1945, the Mid-Ulster Mail announced a new Cookstown factory for the \"manufacture for new hats and ladies’ handbags (with the renovation of old hats as a sideline)\" in William Street, \"employing about 60 workers to start with\". This was founded by Jacob Muskat (Messrs. J. Muskat & Co.) who had been building up the industry over the previous 5 years and now needed larger premises. But in the previous week, both Mrs. Muskat and Maurice Komjat received information from Budapest that their fathers had died, and it is suspected they were Holocaust victims - over half a million Hungarian Jews were deported and murdered during the Second World War. The Mid-Ulster Mail wrote: \"we are sure that the community who welcomed these strangers within our gates, who have been the victims of Nazi persecution, will sympathise with them in their double bereavement.\" It appears that Clara Komjat was the daughter of the Muskats and hence the appearance of both families in Cookstown. The Muskat hat business ran from 1942 to 1948 judging by ‘situation vacant’ notices in the local newspapers.\n\nIn 1946 a new Komjat factory, the Ulster Corsets Manufacturing Company was officially opened at Cookstown - employing 50 ‘girls’ initially. Mrs. C. Komjat was appointed as managing director - an unusual position for a woman in those times. She announced the provision of modern premises with \"electric heating, floodlights and American machinery\" and looked to expanding the company’s export market.\n\nIn June, 1947 a presentation of crystal was made to the Komjats marking their departure for a \"long vacation after years of unremitting hard work\". It was given in appreciation of the provision of \"happy and congenial employment under healthy conditions\". On their return, the Komjats said they would take up residence in Newforge Lane, Belfast.\n\nBy 1953, \"450 Ulster girls were busy sewing dainty garments\" made under the name of ‘English Rose’. Another factory (government-built) opened later in Limavady making a total of three factories by the mid 50’s. These employed over 1000 workers, 95% of whom were female. As well as the home markets, output was also exported to France and Switzerland. Most employees, coming direct from school or domestic service, lived within a 15-mile radius of the factories. Work was piecework and £7 per week could be earned for fast workers. Management provided tea and toast in the morning, free lunches to the under-16s and some payment of bus fares. The factory’s employment over the years was a huge boost to the economy of the area.\n\nBy 1961, the company had gone public and paying dividends to shareholders. The Investors’ Chronicle noted that \"competition is keen in the corsetry trade\", but Mr. Komjat envisaged further expansion and the shares were \"fairly valued\". In 1965, Daintifyt was taken over by Northgate English. One reason for the merger was that the Ulster factories, even though employing about 1400 workers, were unable to increase production enough to meet demand.\n\nThe Komjats meanwhile had moved to Hampstead, London - continuing their charitable and social work, and were active in Jewish and Israel-related organisations. Their daughter Eve was called to the bar in 1957. Clara died in 1963 and Maurice in 1981.\n\nNothing more is known of the Muskats, except for a death notice for Jacob Muskat placed in the Jewish Chronicle by Clara Komjat in 1953.\n\nFurther Reading and Links:\n\nMid-Ulster Local History Journal Vol. 4, \"Daintifyt and Ulster Corset Manufacturing Co. Ltd\", pp 19-24. https://coaghinww1.co.uk/docs/b014.pdf\n\nBelfast had been severely blitzed by the Luftwaffe in April and May 1941. Over 1,000 were killed and 56,000 houses were damaged or destroyed. Tens of thousands of citizens had taken to the countryside for safety, and were in urgent need of accommodation.\n\nBusinessman Nat Goorwitch strove to establish a community for up to 1,000 evacuees from Belfast, irrespective of their faith or background. He wanted this community to provide city dwellers with experience of rural life, offer vocational training, and ensure each individual and family would contribute to the needs of the community.\n\nHe may well have been inspired by the example of the Millisle refugee farm, which was being run along the lines of an Israeli kibbutz. The kibbutz was a rural community based on the principle from each according to his ability, to each according to his need. Goorwitch was born in Odessa where many ideas of social reform were formulated.\n\nThe Earl of Castle Stewart provided his Ulster home, Stuart Hall (located near Stewartstown, Co. Tyrone), for the new scheme. Nat Goorwitch secured the support of the local gentry, Unionist and Nationalist MPs, and the Northern Ireland government.\n\nGoorwitch was the proprietor of a chain of stores across Northern Ireland which had revolutionised the sale of women’s fashion on the Ulster high street. He was a man of vision, determination and organising ability.\n\nBy August 1941, 200 evacuees were living at Stuart Hall, which now included about 50 Nissen huts in the grounds. The Prime Minister of Northern Ireland and other dignitaries came to inspect the new settlement. Nat Goorwitch set about providing additional living accommodation and the necessary facilities. There was to be a school on site, a sick bay with a matron, and a shop in the former stables. He insisted on using only local labour and wanted to integrate the scheme into the local community. He initiated plans for vocational training in horticulture and garment making.\n\nThere was no settlement for evacuees quite like it anywhere else in the UK. However, the scheme was destined to fail. Some local opinion - including notably Viscount Charlemont - turned against Nat Goorwitch. There were allegations of mismanagement and that he was using the scheme for his own advancement. There was also delay from Government in releasing grants which prevented the vocational training from developing as quickly as planned.\n\nViscount Charlemont, as chair of the board of supporters of the Stewartstown scheme, felt sidelined by Goorwitch's management style. Having resigned, he campaigned behind the scenes to have Goorwitch reined in. Charlemont wrote in April 1941:\n\n\"… I think it’s strange that the Government should have given such extraordinary powers to a – well, to a non-Aryan; in view of feeling about such persons themselves and also the natural idea that Ulster people are best fitted for Ulster positions...\"\n\nCharlemont had perhaps forgotten that the Earl of Castle Stewart, on whose land the settlement was built, was married to a \"non-Aryan\", Eleanor May, daughter of Solomon Guggenheim. Also that a former Countess of Charlemont had converted to Judaism.\n\nThe number of residents at the Stewartstown scheme never came close to the thousand aimed for, and the settlement proved not to be self-sustaining. The scheme of Nat Goorwitch got caught between the urgent need for short-term housing in response to the blitz and the longer-term vision of its founder which was never fully realised.\n\nThis story is based on the excellent articles about the Stewartstown scheme in The Bell. The journal of the Stewartstown & District Local History Society, No. 14, by Pat Castle Stewart and Aidan Fee. The articles are illustrated by photographs provided by members of the Goorwitch family.\n\nFor more pictures, see https://niarchive.org/owner/dungannon-and-south-tyrone-borough-community-archi/\n\nA convert to Judaism, the Countess of Charlemont (1834-1882) is buried in the small graveyard attached to the Anglican Church of St James at Moy, Co. Tyrone, close to her family home at Roxborough Castle. Many years later the grave of a small baby was placed beside the Countess’s grave, the tiny headstone etched with a Star of David.\n\nLady Charlemont was born in Co. Meath, the daughter of Lord Athlumney. In 1856 she married James Molyneux Caulfeild, the third Earl of Charlemont. They had a daughter in 1866, who sadly died the day she was born.\n\nWhen in London, Lady Charlemont worshipped at the fashionable Bayswater and Central synagogues. When at home at Roxborough Castle she travelled 40 miles to attend services at the Great Victoria Street synagogue in Belfast. Her first Hebrew teacher was the minister to the Belfast Jewish community, Rev. Dr. Joseph Chotzner.\n\nLady Charlemont was involved in many charitable works around Moy. According to the Jewish Encyclopedia: \"She was an excellent linguist, a good musician, and possessed a remarkable gift for recitation, which she utilized on behalf of charitable institutions.\"\n\nShe took great pleasure in the company of Jewish people and according to the Jewish Chronicle was “more fervid in her practice of the Jewish rites than the most devout members of the Jewish race themselves.” Sir Moses Montefiore, the lay leader of British Jewry, was a friend and mentor of Lady Charlemont.\n\nThe Countess died in 1882, aged 47. According to some press reports, the Jewish observances at her funeral caused “general astonishment” to the local gentry who attended.\n\nIntriguingly, immediately beside Lady Charlemont’s grave is a tiny plot, the gravestone of which has a Star of David etched onto it. But until recently, no one knew for sure the nature of the Jewish connection.\n\nThe grave belongs to Frances Margaret Jacobs ( who died 16th December 1942). Research by church member, Lila Jackson, and genealogist, Sid Katzen, has shown that the deceased was a baby, born in Belfast in September 1942 to Solomon Sydney Jacobs and Agnes Jacobs. Agnes was from Pomeroy, Co. Tyrone, and her maiden name was Sinnamon. At the time of the baby’s death the family lived near Benburb.\n\nIn Orthodox Jewish tradition, Jewish identity is taken from the maternal line. Agnes Sinnamon was not Jewish, and her baby was buried in the Church of Ireland graveyard.\n\nHowever, the Star of David on the grave suggests Solomon and Agnes (or whoever installed the headstone) wanted to honour the baby’s Jewish heritage. And perhaps someone knowing the tragic story of the Countess of Charlemont, whose only child died at birth, arranged for the Jacobs baby to be placed next to the Jewish Countess.\n\nResearch so far has failed to identify any descendants of Solomon and Agnes Jacobs. However, the former Rector of the church, Aonghus Mayes, observed small stones on occasions placed with care on the headstone – this signifies that someone familiar with Jewish customs has visited the grave and placed the stones in the traditional Jewish mark of respect.\n\nSteven Jaffe\n\nSoprano Susan Nelson has recorded a number of compositions by the Countess of Charlemont. Here Susan sings Alas!\n\nThe Jewish Encyclopedia entry on the Countess of Charlemont is available on line and can be read here\n\nJewish Chronicle 2 June 1882.\n\nThank you to Lila Jackson and Sid Katzen for their help in researching this article.\n\nIt would be fair to say that prior to compiling this map it is unlikely any person alive was aware that a Jewish community ever existed in Armagh, a city famous for being the ecclesiastical capital of Ireland. But buried away in the archives of the Jewish Chronicle are the details of a tiny congregation which barely survived a year.\n\nA notice appeared in the Jewish Chronicle, 26 April, 1895 as follows:\n\nA CONGREGATION AT ARMAGH.\n\n\"A MINYAN for regular Jewish Service was started at Armagh, Ireland on March 5th, 1895. A general meeting was held on Sunday, April 7th, 1895 for the purpose of electing Officers and making other arrangements\".\n\nThe notice goes on to reveal that Mr. Samuel J. Parks was elected President; Mr. Abraham Glickman Treasurer; and Mr. Bernard Glick Secretary. The committee comprised Messrs Bernard White; Hosea Parks and Isaac and Henry Glick. Special thanks were accorded to Mr A Glickman \"for his valuable services.\"\n\nHowever, the Jewish Chronicle in London disapproved of the new congregation and others like it. The newspaper's editorial on 2nd August, 1895 remarked:\n\n\"what is especially surprising is that such large numbers of immigrants are settling in the Sister Isle, and in addition to joining the congregations long established in Dublin, Belfast and Cork are forming small colonies; in the towns of Limerick, Armagh, Londonderry, Dundalk and Waterford. We must confess that we cannot view without some misgiving the settlement of the foreign immigrant in towns such as these, which unfortunately, cannot be described as prosperous. We think that our Boards of Guardians, both here and in the provinces, should strongly dissuade their applicants from proceeding to any of these towns\".\n\nDespite such disapproval, Jewish services were held in Armagh in the following year. The Jewish Chronicle 9 October, 1896 reported:\n\nARMAGH\n\n\"Many Jews from a distance made Armagh their temporary home during the recent festivals in order to attend public worship. The services were read by Mr. Samuel J. Parks and Mr. Abraham Glickman.\"\n\nNo further record has been found of a Jewish congregation at Armagh. By the early 1900s there were more Jews living in Lurgan, about 16 miles away, and they soon formed their own small congregation.\n\nThe 1911 census records that Abraham Glickman was by then living in Dublin. Born in Russia in about 1871, and married to Sarah, his eldest children: Molly, Phillip and Laurence were born in Armagh city in the 1890s. His next two children were born in Dundalk - where there was also a tiny community at around the same time - and the family had moved to Dublin by 1903.\n\nThe obituary to Abraham Glickman (Jewish Chronicle 26 June, 1942) reads as follows:\n\n\"THE REV. ABRAHAM GLICKMAN (Manchester), aged 71, was a Shochet [slaughterer] in Dublin for twenty years, and a Shochet under the Manchester Shechita Board for twenty-one years, and was a former President of the Agudas Hashochtim [association of Kosher slaughterers], Manchester. He conducted Shiurim [religious classes] at the New, South Broughton, and other Synagogues, and was respected for his piety and Talmudical knowledge. He leaves a widow, four daughters, and four sons, one of whom is the Rev. L. Glickman, [First Reader] of the Holy Law Congregation.\"\n\nBy the time of his death, Rev. Glickman's early years in Armagh and in Dundalk had been forgotten. His son, Rev. Laurence Glickman MA, who was born in Armagh in about 1896, was a noted Hebrew scholar, cantor and headmaster at the Holy Law synagogue, an important congregation then situated in Redbank, Manchester.\n\nSteven Jaffe\n\nMordechai’s son, Kasriel and his wife Carola, came a long way from Kalisz. After marriage they settled in Danzig, a port city on the Baltic sea, which at that time was a Free State (it is now Gdansk in Poland). Kasriel had a number of business interests there and also a factory in Bydgosz, a city in Poland, which produced fishing nets. He also handled his father's export trade and supplied lace products to Mayfair Manufacturing in the UK (who in turn supplied Marks & Spencer).\n\nIt was Kasriel’s foresight and energy which made emigration to Ulster possible. Hitler had come to power in Germany, threatening war and spewing hatred against Jews. Kasriel sensed time was short and was prepared to sacrifice all he had in Poland to start a new life elsewhere. A conversation in 1937 with his principal customer in Britain, Jack Posnansky, persuaded him to start a manufacturing business there. Fortunately the Northern Ireland government was on the look-out to establish new industries and Kasriel was able to interest them in his family's experience of lace manufacture.\n\nKasriel headed to Portadown, with his brother-in-law Jack Shanik, to re-create from scratch the family business. At the end of August 1939 the rest of the family travelled in haste by overnight train from Warsaw through Germany to Ostend, and then to Dover. On the morning they arrived in Britain they saw the newspaper headlines that Germany had invaded Poland. By the time war was declared on the 3rd September, Carola and sons Richard and George, had joined Kasriel and Jack in Portadown.\n\nGeorge Bloch recalled: “Unknowingly, we were on the last transcontinental train from Warsaw through Berlin to Belgium. I can clearly remember the journey. A sleepy frontier post on the Polish side. Once in Germany mile after mile of railway trucks with troops and armoured vehicles.”\n\nKasriel’s new business, Ulster Laces, was incorporated in November 1939. During the war it made uniform badges for the armed services. Later the firm’s largest customer was Marks & Spencer. At its height the firm employed nearly 750 workers at three different sites - a new factory on the Loughgall Road was opened in 1954 and later extended so that all the production could be concentrated there. Changing demand and fashion caused the gradual phasing out of lace, and embroidery production followed the installation of the most modern knitwear plant. Ulster Laces designed in-house and produced over a million cardigans a year.\n\nThe people of Portadown took the Bloch family to their hearts. They had escaped from Poland with next to nothing. According to one Portadown resident who came across Richard and George Bloch at Portadown college, they exuded “Old world European charm, stoicism, generosity and interest in others.”\n\nUlster Laces was forced to close in 1984 in the face of foreign competition – to the great regret of the Bloch family, the workers and the whole town. “The Ulster Laces now lies silent and bleak” wrote D. Errol McCrory, in his poem “A sentimental walk” (1995).\n\nHere are some memories posted on the Portadown “Back In The Day” Facebook Page:\n\n“Loved the Ulster Laces. Made so many friends there. Very sad day when it closed.”\n\n“Loved working there - good times, best stitching factory going.”\n\n“Mother worked there sporadically & my aunts too when it was on Thomas [street].”\n\nThe biographer and historian, Michael Bloch, son of the late Richard and Ruth Bloch, was educated at Portadown College and St John's College, Cambridge.\n\nThe last word goes to George Bloch: [as a child in Europe in the 1930s] “I experienced more antisemitism in one week than in the many years that I have lived in Northern Ireland.”\n\nAn oral history interview with George Bloch, conducted on behalf of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in 2018, provides much detail on the family in Europe before the war and can be viewed here\n\nSteven Jaffe\n\nLurgan is a market town about 18 miles south west of Belfast, near the southern shore of Lough Neagh.\n\nFrom at least 1916, 49 North Street, Lurgan, served as the “minyan rooms” of the Lurgan Hebrew congregation. A minyan is the quorum of ten adult men required for communal worship. A minyan room is therefore a Jewish prayer room – a little too small to be called a synagogue.\n\nThe first known services in Lurgan were held as early as 1903 at the private home of Joseph and Sarah Hammel in William Street. Worshippers came from Newry, Banbridge and Enniskillen to celebrate Rosh Hashana, the Jewish New Year, and to fast on Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement. According to the 1901 census, about 40 Jews were living in Lurgan. Except for one family, all lived in adjoining North, Ulster and William streets. The 1911 census shows over 70 Jewish residents.\n\nThe dominant figure in the Lurgan Hebrew congregation was Joseph Herbert who arrived before 1891. He came from Tukum, Latvia. Joseph set up shop at 16-18 North Street selling furniture and household goods. The family traded there for over a century. Joseph Herbert was a Poor Law Guardian and in 1913 he topped the poll in municipal elections.\n\nIn 1904 the members of the community formed a society to buy a precious Sepher Torah – the scroll of the law, which contains the first five books of the Bible. Hand written in Hebrew on special parchment, a portion from the Sepher Torah was read each Sabbath at the minyan rooms. The congregation employed its own ministers – including the quaintly named Rev. Salem Turtledove. A resident, Louis Rosenberg (d. 1938), acted as honorary chazan, or cantor, for many years.\n\nLevin Road in Lurgan is said to have been named after Robert Levin, who in 1901 was a 20 year old draper boarding with two other Jewish men in the town. He became well known as a trade union organiser for the Lurgan weavers and is remembered for his work to alleviate poverty.\n\nThe Lurgan Hebrew congregation folded in 1926, shortly after the death of Joseph Herbert. Lurgan by then had two Sefer Torahs which were presented to the Belfast synagogue. During the Second World War Jewish services were once again held in the town, by evacuees from Belfast. In 1941 the military authorities let them use a hall in Lurgan to conduct their services.\n\nThe Herberts traded on North Street over three generations, Joseph – who came to Lurgan from Latvia in the 1880s, his son Abraham (Abe) and then grandson Alan. The shop closed when Alan retired in 1999.\n\n“Who remembers the Herbert’s shop?\" Lurgan people on Facebook were asked recently – here are some responses:\n\n“I loved Herbert’s shop growing up.”\n\n“It was a pleasure to go into Alan’s shop. He was a true gentleman.”\n\n“Alan was brilliant, great fun.”\n\n“Got loads of furniture off them, paid weekly, a brilliant shop.”\n\nDo you want to know more about the Lurgan Hebrew congregation?\n\nSee the Lurgan Hebrew congregation page on the JCR UK website compiled by David Shulman and Steven Jaffe here\n\nLocal historian Jim McCorry has written an excellent article about the congregation in the Craigavon History Society Review (2010/11).\n\nStanley Shapiro, who ran a shop in Lurgan called Robinsons (R Robinson & Son), wrote movingly about the community. His article in the Belfast Jewish Record (April, 1961) has been digitised by Queen's University Library, Special Collections.\n\nSteven Jaffe\n\nIn 1960s Lurgan, Linda Fullerton accompanied her father to Church on a Sunday. They passed a shop on Union Street, the door of which was half open for trade. They are Jews – her father explained – they have their Sabbath on a different day. Linda’s curiosity was aroused.\n\nMany years later Linda attended a cultural event at Belfast synagogue. Two elderly men in front of her proclaimed in loud mid-Ulster accents they hadn’t heard a word of the performance but it must have been very good. Linda asked: “Would one of you by any chance be Elliot Mathews?”\n\nFrom the conversations and friendship that followed, Linda wrote the book, More than a Suitcase of Memories. This gives a priceless insight into the life of a Jewish family in an Ulster market town around the Second World War.\n\nLinda takes the story back to eastern Europe. Some time in the 1880s, the family was forced out of their shtetl – or village –in Lithuania, and moved to the nearby town of Zhager. Zhager was overcrowded with displaced Jews and making a living there was hard. The Jews were penned in by restrictions and discrimination, and by the fear of deadly pogroms which were breaking out elsewhere in the Czarist empire.\n\nIsaac Mathews – the name originally was probably Matthaus – escaped Russia aged 20. He headed west as far as he could go, ending up in Co. Armagh in 1890. Isaac settled first as a lodger at Gusman Clark’s (possibly a relative). In 1896 he established his own business as a credit draper. By 1901 he was living at William Street. He eventually got married, to Gertrude Morris from Belfast in 1917, and raised a family of four boys and two girls, all Lurgan born and reared.\n\nLurgan synagogue had long closed and the Matthews family visited Belfast for festival services. Some of the boys stayed with their grandmother in Belfast so that they could receive a Jewish education and be prepared for their Bar Mitzvah ceremony on their 13th birthday.\n\nThe Matthews were members of the Tribe of Levi. This was a designation that they and their ancestors had proudly maintained for well over twenty centuries, from Biblical Judea to Lurgan, Co. Armagh.\n\nFirst Isaac hawked goods door-to-door on foot – carrying his wares in a pair of battered suitcases across the town and surrounding villages like Moira five miles away. The family eventually set up a small shop in the front room of their home in Union Street, where local people remembered being served by Benny and sister Ray. Many years later Sammy acquired his first car which made travel for business a lot easier, and enabled the family to sell bigger and heavier items, like rolls of carpet, oil cloth and window blinds. The motor car also enabled the Matthews boys to live in Belfast on getting married, while retaining the business in and around Lurgan. Their father Isaac had died at the home on Union Street in 1955.\n\nThe business was principally in credit drapery and house furnishings – but the Matthews were required by their customers to be jacks of all trades. They had the good-natured patter to be successful salesmen. The youngest Elliot set off on his own career path, trained at the Optical factory in Lurgan and got his first job at the Sirocco works in Belfast.\n\nThe Matthews were loved for their down to earth common sense, hard work, and a deadpan sense of humour. They were born raconteurs, loved music and took great joy in their yiddishkeit – their Jewish faith and culture.\n\nWhen in 2018 the Facebook page Old Lurgan Characters asked who remembered Benny Matthews, almost 100 responded - all positively. Here is one comment:\n\n“My Mum’s was his last stop. On Saturday nite/ early hours of Sunday… he had a sandwich and a wee beer with my parents…sometimes a sing song…for absolute years he done that…left us kids sweets…so I was always first up Sunday morning! A true gentleman.”\n\nThe book, More than a suitcase of Memories, was published by Linda Fullerton in 2013. Sammy, Elliot and Sammy's son, Alan Matthews featured in a BBC True North Programme, The Last Minyan – A Belfast Jewish Story (2014).\n\nBenny Matthews wrote humorous stories which were published in the Belfast Jewish Record, including: \"I'm a man of many talents but no shochet [slaughterer]*.\"\n\n\"Far away from troubles and strife in the townland of the Birches amongst the apple and plum trees, there stood a small cottage with a roof of straw and the aroma of turf burning on the fire. Contented and relaxed dwelt old age pensioners Sarah Ann and husband Willie.\n\nI called every fortnight and received either a dozen eggs or a stone of potatoes freshly dug. There was no electricity, no running water and a television was never heard of. A double burner oil lamp provided light and the turf fire was their only means to provide heat or to cook their meals. They had no education and I often had to read their correspondence and fill in their forms and voting papers.\n\nIt was during Chanuka and a week before Christmas, I will never forget the duty they asked me to do. There were two large roosters one in each basket crowing loudly. \"I am waiting for you, I want you to ring those roosters necks, one is for my Christmas dinner and the other is a gift for you,\" said Sarah Ann. I told her \"you might as well ask me to wring your neck, I think I would make a better job of it\". She insisted, \"Take the one in the basket and ask a neighbour to kill it\". I must have spent an hour explaining the kosher doctrine. In the end I accepted a dozen eggs and we wished each other a happy festival\".\n\n*A shochet is a slaughterer. In Jewish law only a highly trained shochet is permitted to kill animals for kosher food.\n\nSteven Jaffe\n\nA tiny item in the London Jewish Chronicle, on 6 March 1903, records that Lill Saether’s great grandfather, Abraham Freeman, originally from Russia, but then of Mill Street, Newry, had naturalised as a British citizen.\n\nLill doesn't know for sure why her family arrived in Newry. They were East European Jews who like millions of others were escaping persecution and seeking a better life. For most the goal was New York rather than Newry.\n\nThere was a tiny cluster of Jewish families in the town - but not enough to form a synagogue. Leonard Abrahamson, a pupil at the Abbey Christian Brothers school, was a brilliant Gaelic scholar and future president of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland.\n\n\"My family were also well received in Newry\" Lill says. \"My great grandparents, Abraham and Rhoda, were living at Cecil Street at the turn of the century - Abraham was a tailor, general dealer and commercial traveller. My grandmother, Florrie, was married at 30 Mill Street, one of her sisters got married at Newry Town Hall. Her youngest brother was born in Newry and qualified as a doctor.”\n\nLill's grandmother began married life with her husband Joseph at 7 Kilmorey Terrace and was rearing three young children when in 1911 the family moved to Norway. Joseph, opened a shop in Trondheim, where two more children were born. The business failed - \"Newry is better than Norway\", the family complained, and by the early 1930s they had moved to the capital, Oslo.\n\nIn April 1940 Germany invaded Norway and occupied it for the rest of the war. The Nazis brought with them their hatred of the Jews. Even though the Norwegian Jewish community numbered only two thousand, they were targeted for persecution.\n\nOppression in Norway started with executions of trade union leaders and those accused of resistance, as well as legal restrictions and random attacks against the Jews. The persecution of Norway's Jews intensified when the pro-Nazi collaborator and leader of the Norwegian Nazi party, Vidkun Quisling, became premier in February 1942.\n\nJews were issued special identity cards, they were made to fill in four-page forms detailing all their property and business interests, and the authorities demanded membership lists of all Jewish associations.\n\nIn October a group of fleeing Jews were challenged by border police on a train. They had neither identity cards nor permission to travel. The non-Jewish guide, who was to take them across the border to Sweden, panicked and shot one of the policemen dead. Both he and the fleeing Jews were arrested and killed.\n\nThe Nazi-controlled press spewed out hatred against the entire Jewish community and called for revenge. On 26 October the Norwegian police and SS came to arrest all Jewish men across the country and seize Jewish property on an unprecedented scale.\n\nLill says \"This was an enormous bureaucratic exercise. In the state archives I've seen the lists drawn up by civil servants of arrested Jews, Jews yet to be arrested, Jews in hospitals etc. There is also a list of my own family's possessions - down to individual items of my grandparent's furniture.\"\n\nWhat the family could save from the confiscations they gave to their gentile lodger - a shipyard worker, who took away jewellery, family photographs and documents. Every item was returned after the war.\n\nWhen the police and Gestapo arrived in the flat to arrest the males none were present. Lill's grandfather, Joseph, was in hospital recovering from an operation. Her uncle, Harry Isidor - a musician – was working in another town. The police warned that unless their son gave himself up to the authorities immediately the whole family would suffer.\n\n\"The next morning Harry Isidor came to the family home to say goodbye to his mother, looking so sad,\" Lill says. \"He also came to the shop where his sister Elsie - my mother - was working and to the hospital where his father was admitted, to say goodbye”. Later that day Harry Isidor gave himself up at the police barracks.\n\nPrior to the 26th November the news leaked that the Nazis were going to round up the entire Jewish community that day, including women and children. While often described as a \"German round up\" Lill points out the action required widespread collaboration - Oslo's police, the State Police and the Norwegian Ministry of Justice participated in it. But many also risked their lives to try and warn Jews.\n\nThat morning the police and Gestapo returned to the family flat. All four women - Lill's grandmother and her three daughters - were at home. But Lill's mother protested. \"We are British citizens\", she said, \"you have no right to arrest us.\"\n\nLill had learnt that citizens of certain nations would not be taken away immediately until the Nazi authorities had worked out what to do with them.\n\nThe police ordered the daughters to prove their citizenship. They produced the passports issued to them years before in Newry, following Abraham's naturalisation. But the youngest daughter, Esther, who had been born in Norway, had no British passport . She was arrested and taken away.\n\nThe photographs of the Jews at the quay can't convey the violence and fear as they were forced onto the deportation ship, the Donau. Esther and Harry Isidor - Lill's uncle and aunt - were on board that ship. It took the Donau four days to reach the Polish port of Stettin, in rough seas and in terrible conditions.\n\nOn arrival the Jews were brutally forced onto the waiting trains - each wagon, designed for cattle, was crammed full with people, without seats or even enough space to sit on the floor.\n\nNearly 28 hours later, without food or water, the trains arrived at Auschwitz.\n\nWithin hours of arrival on December 1st, Esther was gassed, with all the other women and children in the transport. Harry Isidor, with the other men, underwent a selection procedure. Those deemed unfit for hard labour would be killed. As a disabled man who could not disguise his limp, he too was murdered on the 1st December.\n\nOf 773 Jews who were deported from Norway, only 38 men survived the war. Altogether six million Jews were murdered, about one and a half million of them were children.\n\nBack in Norway Lill's grandfather, Joseph, was hiding in the hospital. The doctors and nurses saved Jewish patients. They induced fevers and even rendered some unconscious so that the Nazis would not take them away. Lill has discovered the various dates the Germans arrived at the hospital to arrest her grandfather.\n\nOn 8 December, Lill's mother arrived at the hospital. Her best friend was in the Norwegian resistance and she also had contacts at the hospital. A nurse with a torch led her through a back entrance and up some stairs. She entered the ward through a side door. She collected her grandfather and another Jewish patient. They crossed the hospital grounds and passed through a hole in the fence where a car was waiting to take them away.\n\nA group of Norwegians, including an ex police officer, had organised an escape route for Jews and others in danger. Every evening two lorries left Oslo carrying 20 fugitives, hiding under sacks and packaging. Police and guards were everywhere but somehow the escape operation worked for two months.\n\nThe leader of the escape operation was present on every trip. He spoke fluent German, knew the backroads to the border region, and managed to evade checkpoints and patrols or talk his way out of the situation if they were stopped.\n\nAfter a four-hour journey, in the bitter cold, they walked the last 500m through a forest clearing and across an unfenced stretch of the border. Swedish border police welcomed them with hot drinks, food and warm clothes. From there they were transported to different parts of Sweden where they were safe for the rest of the war.\n\nLill feels it extremely important to share her family's story. She frequently visits Ireland on holiday. She is drawn to the scenery and the people. But the country means much more to her. Because of the family's time in Newry her grandparents and mother were saved from the Holocaust. Otherwise she wouldn't be here today.\n\nAdapted from an interview with Lill Saether by Steven Jaffe, published in the Irish News, 20 January 2021.\n\nTo watch a presentation by Lill Saether to the Killeeshil & Clonaneese Historical Society click here\n\nEdith Sekules, born Edith Mendel in 1916, made the most of her youth in Vienna. While she had little money, she was happy to skip meals to be able to buy tickets for concerts and the theatre. But in 1938, when she was 22, Austria was annexed into Nazi Germany. Edith discovered even people she knew well were declaring Nazi sympathies.\n\nAs a result of anti-Jewish race laws, Edith lost her job at the Hotel Bristol – one of Vienna’s top hotels, where she had worked for six years. They sent her home with a note: “Dismissed - reason: Jewish.”\n\nEdith was married to Kurt, a radio engineer, and was seven months pregnant. They fled from Vienna – leaving behind her father who didn’t survive the war. They arrived in Talinn, Estonia, an independent country which didn’t require a visa to enter.\n\nIn 1940 Estonia was invaded by the Soviet Union. As German passport holders, Edith, Kurt and their two young children found themselves treated as enemy aliens by the Soviet authorities.\n\nThey were arrested and imprisoned. They were then transported hundreds of miles eastwards on cattle trucks across the Soviet Union, spending time in notorious prison camps in Siberia. Edith recalled the unbearable heat and thirst of these journeys during summer. But worse still was the intense cold of the Siberian winter.\n\nThe family ended up in Kazakhstan in Central Asia where they would remain for over five years. They were kept at labour camps surrounded by barbed wire and watch towers and under snow until April. Many prisoners did not survive the harsh conditions.\n\nIn May 1945 Edith greeted the news that the war had ended with jubilation and prepared to return to Vienna. But they were held in forced labour in Kazakhstan for another two years.\n\nKurt began to correspond with family members who immediately before the war had escaped Vienna for a place called Londonderry. Kurt’s father had secured visas under a government scheme to encourage new industries in Northern Ireland. They part-owned an artificial flower and feather manufacturing business. In 1948 Kurt, Edith and family secured a visa to join them.\n\nBy January 1950 the family had moved to Kilkeel in the opposite corner of Northern Ireland, where Edith set up a knitting factory. At a time when women entrepreneurs were far from the norm, Edith soon employed 16 full-time staff. The Kilkeel Knitting Mills made its own label knitwear and commissioned Arran handknits. The firm supplied prestigious stores around the world.\n\nGiven her remarkable story, it is not surprising to learn that Edith’s four children were born in Vienna, Estonia, Kazakhstan and Northern Ireland respectively – she called them her “little United Nations.”\n\nEdith once said: “The camps weren’t pleasant, certainly, but looking back now I can see that by keeping us captive, the Russians actually saved our lives. They kept us away from the Nazis. Often in life from the darkest night comes the brightest dawn.”\n\nEdith died in Kilkeel in 2008, aged 91.\n\nDo you want to know more? Edith told her story in her book Surviving the Nazis, Exile and Siberia (2002). Her son Walter recalls his childhood in a Soviet concentration camp here:\n\nThe model industrial village of Shrigley lies less than a mile from Killyleagh, near the shore of Strangford Lough. The village was established in the 19th century by the Martin family, with well-designed houses, a school and plenty of recreational facilities. The mill produced cotton, then linen, and grew to become one of the largest flax spinners in the world. The demise of Irish linen in the 20th century was a catastrophe. The mill shut in 1930 which left the villagers without jobs and dependent on meagre state handouts and on charity. In the Hungry Thirties the Shrigley villagers protested at Stormont. “This way to hunger land,” was an improvised sign placed at the village entrance in 1933.\n\nThe Utitz brothers, Alfred and Jacob, came from a family with 144 years of experience in tanning leather. Their factory in Czechoslovakia was placed under pressure to increase exports and the brothers were on the lookout to open an operation overseas to assist this. They were pointed to two depressed regions in the UK, the North East of England and Northern Ireland. They were taken to see the abandoned five storey mill in Shrigley, but it was much too large for what they intended.\n\nThen Hitler intervened. Nazi Germany annexed the Sudetenland in 1938 and invaded the Czech lands in 1939. As they were Jews the factory was taken away from the Utitz family. The urgent priority for Alfred and Jacob was to get loved ones out of the country. Their plans changed radically, and by November 1939 the old spinning mill at Shrigley was adapted and began tanning leather. The United Chrome Tanners (UCT) was born, taking on initially 90 workers.\n\n“The villagers not only had to be taught an entirely new kind of work; they had to be taught to work at all…years of total unemployment had bred total despair.” (the Guardian newspaper, 1956)\n\nThe sheepskin and cattle hides processed at Shrigley were used to make leather shoes, fancy bags and clothing. As well as giving much-needed work to local people, the Utitz brothers endeavoured to help fellow Jews escape Nazi persecution by securing work permits for them. Nicholas Vermes, a tannery worker from Hungary, owed his life to receiving a letter from Killyleagh, Co. Down in 1940, which offered him a job at Shrigley. After a dangerous six day trek across Nazi-occupied Europe, Nicholas arrived in Belfast to “the fresh breath of freedom.”\n\nOther refugees connected with the business included Walter Weineger from Austria, who opened the Marybag factory in Belfast which finished the handbags. The first managing director of UCT was a Mr. Horenovsky.\n\nIn the late 1960s the tannery was employing over 400 people.\n\n“And out from Killyleagh goes suede to all the leading makers of shoes on the Rome-Paris-London fashion axis…” (the Guardian).\n\nA crowning achievement of the firm was winning the Queen’s Award for Exports in 1966 – the first Northern Ireland company to do so. In 1973 Erik Utitz OBE, son of Alfred and managing director of the firm, was elected President of the Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry. His brother Gerhard worked outside Northern Ireland in charge of sales.\n\nBut in the 1970s the increase cost of the raw materials, competition and changes in fashion took their toll. In 1972 the factory closed its doors despite only a year or two earlier planning for expansion. Chris Hagan attributes UCT’s demise in part to the Troubles. Poliitcal instability and violence dented foreign confidence in doing business in Northern Ireland and led some banks to withdraw credit facilities. A new tannery under international ownership opened a new chapter in the history of the village.\n\nThanks to the work of Chris Hagan and others the remarkable contribution made by the Utitz family, and fellow refugees, to the people of Shrigley will not be forgotten.\n\nHere are two Shrigley men speaking:\n\nHugh Cochrane: “The opening of the tannery was a gift to the people of Shrigley, for in the years between the closure of the mill and the opening of the tannery there was little work other than on the farms.”\n\nGeorge Watson: the Utitz tannery: “was a God-send to the people. Eventually there were six bus loads coming from Downpatrick alone [to work in the factory].”\n\nFor more information see Farewell to Dear Old Shrigley by Chris Hagan (Amazon Kindle, 2013). Thanks to Chris for generous permission to quote from his book.\n\nSteven Jaffe\n\nOn board the plane from Prague were over 100 children, squatting patiently and silently on the floor. The flight by all accounts was noisy, bumpy and cold, but the children were used to much worse conditions. On their way to Northern Ireland in February 1946 were some of the few surviving orphans of Auschwitz concentration camp.\n\nThe pilot, Denzil Jacobs, recalled the reception which greeted them at Belfast airport.\n\nThe local Jewish community had received advance warning about the flight. A fine tea was laid out on a table, and a somewhat embarrassed crew, together with the children, were embraced as conquering heroes.\n\nThe children well deserved the accolade. Against the odds they had survived the unspeakable evil of Nazi genocide. Hitler's Holocaust had consumed six million Jews, and well over 1.5 million of the dead were children.\n\nThe child survivors often owed their escape to looking older and tougher than their years. At selections for extermination only the fittest were consigned to slave labour, the rest (including the elderly, young and infirm) were gassed. Most of the slave labourers were themselves worked to death, alongside gypsies, prisoners of war and others, and many succumbed to disease or starvation.\n\nOne of the children brought to Northern Ireland was Victor Greenberg, a 16-year-old veteran of Auschwitz. From Nutts Corner, Victor and the rest of the children were whisked off to the refugee farm at Millisle, Co. Down.\n\nVictor recalled his first meal in Northern Ireland. Bread was brought to the table and one of the boys asked how much they were allowed to eat. The unbelievable response was \"as much as you want.\" The children spirited away the bread to hide under their bedclothes. \"Who knows when we will be able to eat again,\" they reckoned.\n\nThe local people of Millisle were by then well used to having refugees in their midst. What was known locally as Gorman's farm, located just to the south of the village, had been a haven to German, Austrian and Czech Jews since 1939. Seventy acres of land had been leased to leaders of the Belfast Jewish community (including Barney Hurwitz, Leo Scop and Maurice Solomon). The farm – one of several in the UK – was established by teenage members of the religious Zionist Bachad movement to prepare them for a career in agriculture in a future state of Israel. Taught by local instructors, including Robert Muckle, the teenagers from Berlin, Prague and Vienna brought the land back into cultivation, built new farm buildings, dormitory accommodation and workshops, and laid drains. They established horticulture and reared chickens.\n\nAfter the Belfast blitz the children of the kindertransport, who were living at a hostel on Cliftonpark Avenue in north Belfast, were brought to Millisle for safety. Many attended Millisle Primary school and schools in Bangor or Newtownards. They were active in the local Air Training Corps and Scouts. The farm was also home to many other refugees, including the Kohner family from Czechoslovakia who administered the farm, Eugen Patriasz from Hungary, a qualified agriculturalist, and Adolf Mundheim, a civil engineer from Hanover, who oversaw the building project. Another refugee, Erwin Jakobi, was responsible for the welfare of the children at the farm. While the farm became more self sufficient, it still required subsidy and support by the Jewish communities of Belfast and Dublin.\n\nThe farm provided refuge for around 300 adults and children and at any given time up to 80 people lived there. According to a Belfast Telegraph news report, in 1940 the farm had two Clydesdale horses, seven cows, 2,000 chickens and included 16 acres of vegetables and dairy farming. In addition to agriculture, there were workshops for shoe and brick making.\n\nVictor Greenberg remembered the daily regime at Millisle after his arrival in 1946. The day started with religious worship in the farm's synagogue and the morning was taken up with English lessons. In the afternoon the children played sports and games, and the sturdier were expected to do their share of market gardening. The fresh food (much of it grown on the farm) and exercise \"helped to develop our bodies, which we desperately needed.\" No doubt the bracing fresh air rolling off the Irish Sea also helped.\n\nThe highlight for the children was being let loose in the bright lights of Donaghadee. The local cinema proprietor allowed the refugees cut price admission, and pocket money was squandered in the amusement arcades. Greenberg never forgot the day he was taken to Belfast to choose the pattern for a Burton's suit.\n\nFor some of the children the trauma of losing parents and siblings, and of the unspeakable brutality that they had witnessed, hit harder in later life. But incredibly many of the Millisle children went on to live useful and well-adjusted lives. Wilem Frischmann was on the flight from Prague. He qualified as a structural engineer, and was instrumental in the construction of some of London's best known landmark buildings (for which he was awarded the CBE).\n\nMost of the Northern Ireland contingent of child survivors had grown up in very religious homes in Eastern Europe. It was decided to move them on to the larger Jewish communities in Manchester and London. There they could receive a religious upbringing more in line with what they would have received at home, had Hitler not intervened.\n\nBut their first taste of freedom in Ulster was never forgotten. In the early 1980s the late MP, Harold McCusker, ventured into a New York jewellery shop to buy a present for his wife.\n\nHe was taken aback when the shopkeeper crossed the counter to greet him: \"You are from Northern Ireland!\" he exclaimed in a heavy continental accent, \"tell me is Donaghadee lighthouse still as beautiful as ever?\" Alex Friedman, jeweller, of 47th Street, had also passed through Millisle.\n\nThis story is adapted from an article by Steven Jaffe published in the Belfast Telegraph.\n\nTo find out more:\n\nThe inspiring story of the orphans who were brought to the United Kingdom in 1946 (including those who came to Northern Ireland) is told by Sir Martin Gilbert in his book The Boys, Triumph over Adversity (Weidenfeld & Nicolson).\n\nThe BBC drama The Windemere Children tells the story of child survivors who were brought to the Lake District. Some of the filming was at Millisle.\n\nRachel Levy was on the flight from Prague to Northern Ireland in 1946. In a presentation by Scott Edgar of the Linen Hall library, Rachel speaks about her family's experiences in the Holocaust. Rachel came to Millisle aged 15, having spent over a year in Auschwitz and Belsen. She described her time in Millisle as like a dream.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywIWYMkklBk&t=267s\n\nIn 2018 Rachel returned to Millisle: https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1778088035556410\n\nMore on the Millisle Farm:\n\nAn interview about the farm with Steven Jaffe on NVTV: https://www.nvtv.co.uk/shows/in-focus-steven-jaffe/\n\nInterview with Ruth Kohner (Aug, 2018) about the Millisle Farm: https://collections.ushmm.org/search/catalog/irn694077\n\nHistory Ireland Magazine: https://www.historyireland.com/millisle-county-down-haven-from-nazi-terror/\n\n(Imperial War Museum) Edith Jacobowitz and the Millisle Refugee Farm: https://www.iwm.org.uk/history/edith-jacobowitz-and-millisle-refugee-farm\n\nA Kinder Place, a Different World - a video made by the children of Millisle Primary school :\n\nWalter Kammerling, one of the kindertransport, speaks with Dr Katy Radford MBE:\n\nExcellent resources about the farm can be found on the websites of Down County Museum, Millisle Primary school and Wartime Northern Ireland.\n\nThe children’s novel, Faraway Home, was published by Marilyn Taylor in 1999 combines fact and fiction to tell the story of the child refugees in Northern Ireland.\n\nA documentary film and website about Alex Friedman, one of the orphans brought to Millisle after the war, made by his son Robert, is called More Precious Than Pearls.

Most of them were born in Holywood, [Co. Down].\n\nOn April 9th 1869, after the birth of their last child, James Jacob Mautner sat down in Belfast and wrote a very moving \"ethical will\" about his beliefs. This four-page document was written in German, except for one sentence in English, and a Blessing for his family in Hebrew, was addressed to his oldest, Max, who was ten years old at the time. It was not to be opened until after James Jacob's death, but not before Max's 14th birthday, and copies were to be given by Max to all his brothers and sisters.\n\nThe following is a translation of Jacob's ethical will:\n\nDATED APRIL 9TH, 1869, BELFAST\n\nTO MY SON MAX!\n\nWhenever this letter will be delivered to you, my son, you my dear boy, and my other dear children, will be fatherless orphans. May the Almighty Father in his wisdom decide to look after you and your brothers and sisters, who are all very close to my heart, for a very long time. Especially your Mother, so she would be able to look after all of you with her Motherly love. Amen.\n\nMy eyes are filled with tears at this moment while I'm writing this and I'm imagining placing my hands on the heads of my dear remaining children, G-d's blessing be upon you.\n\nHold on to your Jewish religion and even where there are circumstances under which you might not be able to fulfill one of the commandments or another, according to the laws, it should by no means enter your mind to leave your G-d revered religion. Do not waver or yield until the time when I can be reunited with my children in the great beyond.\n\nHonour, respect and love your mother who was always a good, loyal and honest wife throughout our lifetime. Show her always that you are good, loyal and loving children, which she deserves, and ease her life in the sad days of widowhood until the Almighty Father above has united us once again.\n\nBrothers and sisters should always stick by one another as if you were welded together. No matter in what circumstances in life one may find the other, help each other with advice and action, as genuine brothers and sisters should. I believe that this is the best memorial for your father, who has passed on.\n\nTo you, my dear boys, I would like to call your attention as to what course to follow later on in your lifetime. Choose your career with great care regarding your future and continue to follow it until you reach your goal. Do not be afraid whatever difficulties should arise, for you to get there. Only in the case that the chosen field was a mistake, either due to reason of health or locality etc, etc. or would not be profitable, then every effort should be made as quickly as possible to follow in anew direction with the utmost speed, and with extra enthusiasm and hard work, you must catch up on lost time. Choose your special road and stick to that. [this sentence is written in English]\n\nTo you my dear girls, I would like to suggest that you follow the caution and understanding of your good and loyal mother. She will raise you into religious, modest and proper housewives and she has the necessary knowledge to prepare you to fit into respectable society. Religion, modesty, unpretentiousness and purity is the mark of a maiden.\n\nDo not close your heart to the poor with each according to their ability. Abhor lies and admire truthfulness. Disregard sacrifices which will be asked of you to carry this out. But the truth makes you a decent human being. Always practice honesty and sincerity towards other people. Never display conceit and arrogance towards anyone else, whoever it might be.\n\nYou, my dear son, Max, will get this letter handed to you and as my firstborn, assume the responsibility to see to it that my herein enclosed wishes will be carried out, if possible. I sincerely hope that my wife, your dear mother, realizes how much importance I attach to this.\n\nAbove all, help her with the upbringing of your minor brothers and sisters. See to it that there always is harmony at home. You, my son, see to it that you and the rest of your brothers and sisters behave as good, loyal children towards your mother, and thereupon receive the blessings of the Lord.\n\n(THEN FOLLOWS THE AARONIC BLESSING, (Numbers 6:23–27) WHICH IS WRITTEN IN HEBREW\n\nLETTERS).\n\nBELFAST, APRIL 9, 1869\n\nYour Loving Father\n\nJACOB MAUTNER\n\nSource: The Mautner family from Nachod / Bohemia 1786 - 1997. A genealogical survey by Herb Mautner, which is available on line.\n\nWhat do we know about Jacob Mautner?\n\nOn Jacob's application for British citizenship, he declared that he was born in the town of Dessau, in Upper Saxony, in June 1825 (?). He is believed to have served as an apprentice at one of the weaving or spinning mills at Nachod in Bohemia belonging to members of the wider Mautner family.\n\nJacob spent a year in Dundee in 1853 and arrived in Belfast the following year - so along with Daniel Jaffe and Isaac Weinberg, he was one of the earliest Jewish settlers in what is today Northern Ireland. He became a British subject in1857, the year he married Rosalie Herz in Jessnitz, Germany (the birth place of his mother).\n\nHe first appears in the Belfast Directory in 1860, as James Mautner and Co., Linen Merchants, of 27 Victoria Street. His offices were later at 91 Abercorn Buildings. An observant Jew, he was described in a newspaper report as one of the \"most zealous\" members of the newly-founded Belfast Hebrew Congregation.\n\nJames Mautner prospered in the linen trade. He was the owner of a country estate, known as \"Amalie Croft \", on Marine Parade in Holywood. The house consisted of 10 bedrooms, 4 reception rooms, a large dining room and nursery and also contained pantries, baths, toilets, and gas heating throughout. Outside, there were stables, a coach house, a dairy, and a well-stocked garden of fruit and flowers. The estate consisted of nearly three acres of land.\n\nDespite their material success, Rosalie Mautner had persuaded her husband to return to Germany by 1873. They auctioned off their Holywood house and possessions. James Jacob opened a mechanized weaving mill in Nordhausen, Germany. He died there in 1899 and Rosalie died in 1911. As a result of Nazi persecution, descendants of Jacob and Rosalie today are scattered in South America, Israel, the UK and Ireland, and many places elsewhere.\n\nThe Anschluss (March 1938), the annexation of Austria into Nazi Germany, resulted in Austrian Jews desperately seeking to escape. Alfred Neumann had come to England from Vienna in 1936. He sought to facilitate the admission of Austrian refugees and soon his focus was on N. Ireland. He worked with the Belfast Jewish community to bring children to the Cliftonpark Avenue shelter, and in 1938 he established two enterprises, in Newtownards and Derry, to bring over skilled workers.\n\nIn August 1938, the dignitaries from the Ulster Development Council and the Ministry of Commerce lauded the arrival of a party of Jewish skilled key workers from Vienna, under the auspices of Neumann, who planned to set up an industry in Newtownards utilising home workers. The Jewish workers would teach local people Austrian handicraft skills of design, cutting and hand-finishing for the home-based manufacture of gloves, belts, handbags and crochet work based on leather and fabric. These would incorporate the widest use of Irish linen and Irish designs. With the aid of government grants, a training quarter in Court Square, Newtownards would provide tuition for about sixty workers at a time over 2-3 months to gain expertise.\n\nAt the reception to welcome the group of design and production managers from Vienna, Mr. Scott from the Ministry of Commerce noted that Mr. Neumann had \"grit and determination\" and had overcome well-nigh insurmountable difficulties. And he had \"the makings of a real Ulsterman!\" The workers had to be surreptitiously brought out of Austria because if the Nazis learnt the true purpose of their visit, they would not have been allowed to leave. (Northern Whig, 10 Aug 1938).\n\nNeumann explained that he wanted to:\n\n‘start a new handicraft industry of the type which Austria has been traditionally associated. And to help some of my own people who find their country has been changed for them. And to show that aliens and refugees can bring much good for the country that offers them a new home. Daily barbarism has made it impossible for my key workers, and thousands of others, to make a living in their country.’\n\nHe quoted from Psalm 118 : ‘The stone which the builders rejected has become the corner headstone’ !\n\nTrainees were to be paid 10s per week while training, and when proficient could expect to earn sixpence an hour working from home. A popular line was to be winter sports gloves with bright woollen embroidery – bold in design and not as detailed as the fine linen embroidery to which many trainees were accustomed to. Then they could progress to painted belts, crocheted string belts and collar sets. Also fans, tablemat holders, serviette rings, and hand-painted woodwork.\n\nLater the same year, Neumann was instrumental in setting up a company in Londonderry with David Gilfillan, a local hosiery and knitwear manufacturer. With the help of government loans, the company, Gilfallan and Neumann Ltd, leased part of the former shipyards and employed several Viennese refugees as workers. In January 1939 Neumann and others also founded the Londonderry Continental Novelties Ltd making footwear, toys, novelties etc.\n\nHowever the Newtownards project ran into problems in early 1939 and government funding was withdrawn. The scheme was taken up by Nathan Goorwitch becoming the Ards Handicrafts Ltd. According to an Ulster Development Council document, Goorwitch was instrumental in bringing over Zoltan Frankl and his wife Anny Lewinter from Austria to take over the scheme and late in1939 it was re-registered as Anny Lewinter Ltd. The company received various government grants and traded successfully until 1985.\n\nMeanwhile Neumann returned to England to further the rescue of more refugees. In 1940, with the threat of an imminent invasion, there was an outbreak of ‘spy fever’ and many so-called enemy aliens, even if they had not been previously classified as a security risk, were interned in various camps throughout the UK. They included Germans, Austrians and Italians – many who had lived in England for decades. But also included were Jewish refugees who had fled the Nazi occupation. According to a BBC Fact File on WWII Civil Internment, 80% of the internees in one of the Isle of Man camps were Jewish refugees.\n\nThousands of these internees were to be deported – many to Canada and Australia. The ex-cruise ship Arandora Star left for Canada from Liverpool on 2 July 1940 carrying ‘German and Italian’ internees. The ship was struck by a U-boat torpedo off the north west coast of Ireland and sank within an hour - around 800 people drowned out of about 1600 on board. Throughout the month of August, bodies washed onto Scottish and Irish shores. It later transpired that many of the internees were Jewish refugees who had fled to the UK from Nazi oppression. Questions were asked in Parliament about the tragedy and the seeming cover-up about the nationality of the victims. An outcry and subsequent enquiry ensued. The outcome was a relaxation of internment rules, and most of the Jewish refugees were released from internment.\n\nThis policy relaxation came too late for Alfred Neumann who had been interned when he returned to England, and then was sent to Canada on the Arandora Star. An unbelievably tragic end to a man who had saved many Viennese Jews and set up the template for a ‘cottage industry’ infrastructure based in Newtownards.\n\nFurther Reading and Links:\n\n“The Northern Ireland Government, the New Industries Act, and Refugees from the Third Reich, 1934−1940”, John Privilege, Centre for the History of Medicine in Ireland, Ulster University.\n\nCivil Internment: 1939-1945:\n\nhttps://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ww2peopleswar/timeline/factfiles/nonflash/a6651858.shtml\n\nhttps://www.hutchinsoncamp.com/\n\nThe Sinking of the Arandora Star:\n\n‘Men that came in with the sea’: the Coastwatching Service and the sinking of the Arandora Star.\n\nhttps://www.historyireland.com/20th-century-contemporary-history/men-that-came-in-with-the-sea-the-coastwatching-service-and-the-sinking-of-the-arandora-star/\n\nArandora Star victims: A supplement to the White Paper, 1941: (Response to Enquiry by Lord Snell)\n\nhttps://mrc-catalogue.warwick.ac.uk/records/TUC/A/11/911/62/1\n\nParliamentary Discussion: https://api.parliament.uk/historic-hansard/commons/1940/aug/06/loss-of-arandora-star\n\nAt the Zionist Congress held in Prague in August 1933, Franz Kohner and Edith Geduldiger met. Franz, a lawyer, had already visited the British Mandate of Palestine in 1926. They married the following year when Franz was thirty-five years old, and Edith was twenty-two. In 1936, Dinah was born and Ruth followed a year later. A son, William, was born in 1947 in N. Ireland.\n\nIn September 1938 the Munich Agreement permitted Hitler to occupy the Sudeten German territory in Czechoslovakia whereupon the family decided to escape. Within three weeks they had arrived in Northern Ireland. Their ability to speak several languages, their Jewish heritage, and Franz’s wide experience in setting up a youth recreation centre in the mountains of Bohemia, made them especially suited to the job as administrator at the Millisle Refugee Settlement Farm, and gained them the vital UK entry visa. Sadly many relations, including Franz’s mother, were unable to leave and were murdered in the Holocaust. Meanwhile Franz’s brother Rudi also escaped, later returning to Bradford where he had previously studied textile manufacturing with the expectation of taking on his father’s business in Podersdam, Bohemia.\n\nEdith related in an interview (Belfast Telegraph: June, 1955) that in Czechoslovakia her father was in the linen trade and there she had learned dressmaking and pattern cutting. After the war she “started on one machine at home. Then I sold a diamond ring I had managed to smuggle out – and with that I was able to buy two more machines”. And so in 1946 Belart Ltd. (Nursery Goods & Children's Wear) was incorporated. First they made dolls’ dresses and soft toys in a small terrace house at 203 Donegall Street, Belfast, as they did not have the necessary coupons to purchase cloth. When the Ministry of Commerce offered them coupons they switched to quality children’s wear using fine Irish handkerchief linen and other fabrics. Franz Kohner related that he heard once from a misinformed buyer that \"Belfast produced shoddy goods\", so he was determined that all his labels would incorporate the name ‘Belfast’ to show how wrong that was. He received special permission from Belfast City Council to use the Seahorse from the Belfast City Coat of Arms as the company’s trademark.\n\nAs business grew, a factory was opened in Trinity Street, Belfast. By 1960 Belart was producing ranges of children’s clothing and looking at export markets. The company had “an enviable reputation for good design, finish and imaginative use of linen and other fabrics”.\n\nNew premises were opened in 1961 on Northumberland Street between the Falls and Shankill Roads.\n\nHowever, in August 1969 at the outbreak of the Troubles, the Belart factory in Northumberland Street – then employing about 150 people - was burnt down by rioters. At this point Billy Kohner, aged 22, took over management of the firm due his father’s failing health. He organised the recovery, and factory relocation, and later expanded sales into new markets. Rallying round the recovery, the employees took items home to complete while others managed to work in a part of the damaged factory. Production then continued at temporary accommodation at the Adelaide Industrial Estate, Belfast and delivery deadlines were mostly met. Planning permission was soon given for a new, larger factory at Longlands Road, Newtownabbey. This was opened in 1970, complete with a canteen and social club and giving much local employment. The factory was bombed again in 1971 but managed to continue production.\n\nSo from small beginnings almost 30 years before, the factory now produced about 120,000 garments annually for children up to ten years of age – selling in the UK and exporting about 30% of its production to 19 other areas world-wide.\n\nBy this time the Kohner children, Ruth and Billy, were company directors. Ruth was already responsible for design and Billy Kohner became managing director in 1971, aged 24.\n\nIn June 1972 Dr Franz Kohner received the OBE in recognition of his work on the farm, with the forces during the War, and his services to Northern Ireland through the family business and the Belfast Rotary club. The staff at Belart presented him with a bannerette and silver salver to mark the occasion.\n\nFranz sadly died later that same year, aged 73. Billy and Ruth Kohner continued the business after Franz’s death. Edith later retired to Newcastle and died there in 2009 aged 94. She gave many talks to adults and children about her war-time experiences and the Millisle refugee farm.\n\nBelart continued until 2000, having expanded into several export markets, additional brands, and over twenty retail outlets in Britain. At this point the Company closed as the directors determined that both the retail market and supply markets had changed so rapidly as to make existing operations untenable.\n\nPostScript: Dinah Kohner\n\nFranz and Edith’s eldest daughter Dinah studied medicine at Queen’s University, Belfast graduating in 1959, with the Queen’s Gold Medal in paediatrics. She was awarded a Rotary Club scholarship to the Harvard Medical School and then worked at the Boston Children’s’ Medical Centre. She was invited to join the hospital ship SS Hope in Ecuador, and there she initiated an extensive programme of nutrition and preventative medicine where she was known as the ‘Queen of Hope’. She survived a serious plane crash, but tragically later died of her injuries in 1964.\n\nThanks to Billy Kohner and Ruth Kohner for helping with information.\n\nFurther Reading and Links:\n\n‘My Father's Roses’ by Nancy Kohner (Hodder Paperbacks, 2009) tells the story of the Kohner family in Europe before and during the War.\n\n• For more information on Dinah: http://www.newulsterbiography.co.uk/index.php/home/viewPerson/1926\n\n• Edith Kohner's story: https://wartimeni.com/person/edith-kohner/\n\n• Ruth Kohner Interview (Aug, 2018) about Millisle Farm: https://collections.ushmm.org/search/catalog/irn694077\n\nHenry Nathan was born in Bromberg, Germany in 1898. He married Betty Rosenthal and they had two daughters. He was managing director of Mechanische Weberei Krüger, a company manufacturing furnishing fabrics in Reutlingen, Baden-Württemberg. The company was sympathetic to the Jewish family's situation in Nazi Germany and in 1937 transferred him with his family to their London branch where the company had showrooms and an office in Dean Street. The family settled in Hendon, north London. But with the advent of war, business with Germany was finished.\n\nAn Internment Exemption record states that he was 'exempt from registration whilst serving in H. M. Forces'. He served in the Royal Pioneer Corp (the only unit possible for ‘enemy aliens’).\n\nIn 1947, with the help of government financial aid and factory premises, Henry started his own business, Tapestry Weavers (Ulster) Ltd in Crevilly-valley (near Ballymena) for the production of carpets, upholstery and tapestry. He commented that he liked Northern Ireland, the people, and the traditional craft skills available, and also the stately trees and picturesque river of Crevilly-valley . A key craftsman was brought over from Italy, and taking advantage of the local weaving skills, production soon started with one loom and half a dozen workers in a requisitioned RAF storage unit.\n\nTapestry patterns were period reproductions of century-old French and Italian schools, and used woollen, linen, worsted and nylon threads as well as cotton thread from Lancashire. Some home-spun yarn made locally on old-style spinning wheels were also incorporated into fabrics. The firm concentrated on high-quality production and so had a limited output.\n\nBy 1948, the Northern Whig reported that fabrics made by the company were ‘decorating royal palaces, and furnishing palatial embassies throughout Europe, as well as ocean-going liners and stately homes’. About 80% of production was for export and local purchase tax made the cost quite prohibitive for the home market. By this time, 70 local women were employed in skilled production.\n\nQueen Mary (the grandmother of Queen Elizabeth) visited the company’s stand at the Wool Secretariat London exhibition in 1948. She was impressed by the product quality and chose some cotton and worsted fabric for use in Marlborough House. This was delivered just in time for her 80th birthday.\n\nIn 1951 the NI Prime Minister Sir Basil Brooke visited the factory. Henry Nathan spoke of their export success and the importance of the high standard of craftmanship. A presentation of hand-sprayed cushion covers was made to the dignitaries.\n\nQueen Elizabeth and the Duke of Edinburgh visited Ballymena on Friday 3 July 1953 (coronation year) as part of the NI state visit just one month after her coronation. The visitors were greeted by cheering crowds with many people staying up overnight to get the best views. The Queen was presented with a Royal blue box containing six cushion covers with a hand-painted floral design set against a woven mushroom background made by Tapestry Weavers Ltd.\n\nThe early 1950’s saw steady company growth and a multitude of ‘situations vacant’ adverts for Jacquard weavers, tapestry weavers, winders, warpers, darners and other associated technicians – with offers of transport to/from Belfast.\n\nBut in May 1955, the factory announced its imminent closure due to ‘practical and economic reasons’ – namely, the cost of transporting raw materials in and finished goods out was too high. A merger was planned with a similar Burnley factory closer to the centre of a cotton producing area. Machinery was to be dismantled and transferred over to Burnley and about 70 workers to be laid off. Henry Nathan died in 1959.\n\nSee Wiener Holocaust Library Ref.1702/1: https://wiener.soutron.net/Portal/Default/en-GB/RecordView/Index/71135\n\nIn the 1950s there were still many English landladies who displayed that infamous welcoming sign on their boarding house doors: \"No Irish, no Jews, no theatricals\". For the then budding actor, Harry Towb, that sign spelt trouble. He found himself barred on all three counts.\n\nHarry Towb (1925-2009) was born in Larne – a seaport just over 20 miles north of Belfast. His father had a small shop in the town which supplied Irish linen.\n\nAt the age of two his family moved to England, but they returned to Northern Ireland in the early 1930s. Harry Towb grew up between the Oldpark and Crumlin roads, in north Belfast.\n\nThe family's circumstances were far from comfortable, even before tragedy struck. In 1943 Towb's father died when Harry was barely 18. The teenager found himself the chief bread-winner for the family.\n\nAn education which began at Finiston PES and continued at Belfast Technical College came to an abrupt halt. Harry frankly acknowledged he struggled as a businessman. But, ironically, it was only once he began to turn things around that he decided to jack it all in, and become an actor.\n\nHarry Towb came into the theatre as a result of one amazing week in his life. He had made a name for himself in some amateur productions when, to his immense surprise, he received three openings for professional acting all in the space of seven days. He opted for a five-week stint with a Dublin touring company. Looking back, he marvelled that his mother and sister didn't try to talk him out of it.\n\n\"I owe my acting career to the generous spirit of my mother\" Towb recalled. \"When I announced I was off to London to seek my fortune on the stage, my horrified mother made me swear only one thing. If I hadn't made the grade in a year, I would come back home to Belfast\".\n\nTowb, aged 21, left Ulster with £20 in his pocket and wearing an awful bottle green suit with heavily padded shoulders, which he took for metropolitan fashion.\n\nIt took him much more than a year to make the grade, but thanks to his ambition, tenacity and talent, make the grade he did. He enjoyed over 50 years of work on the stage, in films, and on the radio. By the 1950s he had made the breakthrough into television as well, which fell into his lap almost by accident.\n\n\"In about 1951 I had my first audition for a real part in a stage play. It was after this audition that the director caught sight of the back of me walking through a door.\n\n\"I was wearing my awful bottle green suit which I had bought years before in Belfast. The director called me back and said I had just the look of the person they needed to play a spiv in a new television drama\".\n\nHe enjoyed guest starring roles in popular TV series like Dr Who, The Avengers, Callan, The Professionals, and The Saint.\n\nAs an Ulster Jew Harry Towb had two cultural traditions to fall back on to save himself from being typecast. He even managed to combine his Irish Jewish background by playing George Nathan, the \"Jew finder in chief,\" in the 1991 sit-com, So You Think You've Got Troubles. In this programme, Towb, as president of the ailing Belfast Jewish community, seeks to persuade the militantly atheist Warren Mitchell, recently arrived from London, to join the local synagogue.\n\nTowb took much pride in his award-winning short story, Cowboys, (1981) which he adapted into a television play. It’s about a Belfast-born American Jew who comes back to the city to revisit the streets where he grew up. Towb warmly evokes the innocence of his own Belfast childhood, touching on the mutual misunderstanding which he acknowledged existed between the Jews and their non Jewish neighbours. But in Cowboys he also celebrated the warm friendships which emerged across Belfast's other, less well-known, religious divide.\n\nHarry Towb died in 2009.\n\nAdapted from an interview with Harry Towb by Steven Jaffe, published in the Belfast Telegraph 4 July 2008\n\nBelfast’s City cemetery, opened in 1869, was intended to have different Protestant and Catholic sections. An underground wall was built to separate them. A third tiny section is the Jewish burial plot which has its own wall around it, above ground!\n\nThe Jewish community first requested a burial ground in 1870, and permission was granted by Belfast Corporation the following year. The Jewish section had a separate entrance from the Whiterock Road – which has been bricked up for many years. But still visible is a Hebrew inscription which reads Bet Ha Chayim – which can be translated as House of Life. The Jewish section had its own Tahara House, or chapel, where the body was prepared for burial and prayers were recited.\n\nIn all 295 Jews are buried here. About half that number are stillborn and young children who died under the age of 13. The small burial ground reflects a proud religious and cultural identity. But also apparent is the stark reality of class differences.\n\nThe dominant monument is the obelisk to Daniel Joseph Jaffe, who founded the Belfast Hebrew congregation and was the father of the Lord Mayor, Sir Otto Jaffe. Daniel died at his holiday villa in Nice in 1874 and his family brought his body back to Belfast for burial. The cremated remains of Daniel’s wife Frederike have also been placed here.\n\nBut many of the burials are in that part of the Jewish section known as the Jewish Poor Ground. In 1884 the cemetery authorities prohibited the erection of headstones on graves for “the poorer class of Jews” who were unable to pay for their funerals (this mirrored the by laws in the rest of the cemetery).\n\nOne of the babies buried in the Jewish Poor Ground was called Lesbia Smith. She died in 1910 aged seven weeks. In 2016 a family member, Rabbi Alex Goldberg, reflected: “She was born the daughter of persecuted migrants. She could only be buried in that section of the Jewish cemetery where the city would not allow those buried to have gravestones. It must have been very hard for her family to leave her in an unmarked grave.”\n\nLesbia Smith was born and died in poverty. Rabbi Goldberg believes her death was associated with poor nutrition and lack of free medical services.\n\nIn 1931 Rabbi Shachter obtained permission to erect a single monument to commemorate all those buried in the Poor Ground.\n\nThe first burial at the Jewish section was in 1873 of a stillborn child named Herschman from 57 Divis street. The last was Abraham Herbert, a well-known shop keeper from Lurgan, who died in 1964. Those buried include Jews from Dundalk, Lurgan, Armagh and Derry as well as Belfast.\n\nThe Jewish section of City Cemetery has long been the scene of vandalism – as has the cemetery as a whole. By the 1980s the Tahara house had been destroyed. In more recent times gravestones have been overturned and graves desecrated. Former Lord Mayor Tom Hartley, has been instrumental in recording the history of the Jewish section - which comprises a chapter on his book on the City Cemetery - and also in ensuring its proper maintenance and repair. Now Belfast City cemetery has attracted heritage funding it is hoped the story of its Jewish section will become better known in the local and wider community.\n\nWould you like to know more?\n\nTom Hartley’s book, Written in Stone, on the history of City Cemetery includes a full chapter on the Jewish section, and lists the names of all those buried there. The chapter provides an excellent account both of the burial ground and the congregation it served.\n\nIn 2009 Stanley Coppel presented a video record of the Jewish section which can be watched here:\n\nA listing of the above headstones, with corresponding photographs can be found by clicking on here.\n\nBurial records for the City Cemetery Jewish section can be searched on line by clicking here.

This is a valuable source for those gravestones which have since been vandalised or destroyed.\n\nIn the early 20th century, Josef Sochor and his wife Paula (née Bauer) established a textile print factory in Dvur Králové, Czechoslovakia. The company quickly became a world leader in pioneering new printing technologies, and by the 1930s employed over 1500 people. Josef's son Zdenek took over management in 1924 and Josef died in 1931. Zdenek designed textile machinery and had several patents to his name. After the German occupation of Sudetenland, the company was confiscated. Of Paula and Josef ’s five sons, only two survived the Holocaust.\n\nZdenek was in England just before the outbreak of war. He had already received a grant from the Ministry of Commerce to establish a textile printing company in Belfast when the war broke out. He managed to obtain visas for his wife Eliska (later Elizabeth) and son Pavel b. 1933 (later Paul). He also brought over some of his key workers. The Belfast Silk and Rayon Company in Waterford Street, west Belfast (near the Royal Victoria Hospital) was established in 1939. A cousin, Alfred Landsberger, who had also escaped from Czechoslovakia and was in the textile industry, was a co-director.\n\nSilk-screen printing was a very skilled operation and the company had soon trained about 140 local employees. It printed and produced tablecloths and tea-towels for many outlets including Lamonts, Ulster Weavers, and also indirectly to Marks & Spencer via Ewart-Liddell, a local linen textile company. The company also had an active social side and football team.\n\nHenri Matisse, in collaboration with Zika Ascher, produced in 1948 a pair of Irish Linen hangings (Océanie - Le Ciel and Océanie - La Mer) based on wall compositions by Matisse. The Belfast Silk and Rayon Company was commissioned to formulate the dye to replicate the exact colour of the wallpaper in Matisse’s bedroom. (ref: 'Matisse and Decoration' by John Klein: Yale University Press, 2018).\n\nZdenek then diversified into weaving cloth – a mixture of linen and synthetics - for dress printing and established Crepe Weavers Ltd. in 1948. According to the Northern Whig (April,1948): “Factory premises at Newtownards Aerodrome, previously used by Miles Aircraft Ltd., are to be adapted for the manufacture and weaving of crepe yarns. Operations will be run by a new company, Crepe Weavers Ltd., a branch of the Belfast Silk and Rayon Co. which currently employs 300 people. One of the directors, Mr. Sochor, expects the company to have about 100 employees.” The factory was operational by the end of the year. Customers included Ulster Laces in Portadown (trimming for Ladies Underwear) and also Daintyfyt of Cookstown - companies that were also established by Jewish refugees.\n\nHe worked together with Josef Mladek and his son Milan, who had patented a new way of weaving crepes. The families knew each other through their textile businesses in Czechoslovakia. The Mladeks had suffered political persecution after the communist take-over in 1947/8 and so also then relocated to N. Ireland. Josef Mladek was became a director of Crepe Weavers and later, in 1951-52, the company was sold to him. Meanwhile the Sochors kept on with Belfast Silk & Rayon.\n\nAround this time Zdenek’s son Paul completed a textile technology degree at QUB and joined Belfast Silk & Rayon. The company was taken over by Carrington and Dewhurst in 1966. Paul Sochor stayed on for several years as marketing director. By then, his father Zdenek had retired with Elizabeth to Montreaux, Switzerland.\n\nIn the 1970s Belfast Silk & Rayon moved to a new site at Whitehouse, Newtownabbey. Waterford Street was retained as a design office. The company at that time employed about 300 people.\n\nZdenek died in 1988 in Montreux, and his wife Eliska some years later. Both were cremated and their ashes are buried in Roselawn Cemetery, Belfast. Paul died in Belfast in 2021 where he was also cremated.\n\nThanks to:\n\nJenny and Mandy Sochor for photographs and information.\n\nFurther Reading and Links:\n\nTestimony and Textiles - Czech Republic: https://sfi.usc.edu/content/textiles-czech-republic\n\nLinen - the story of Mladek and Sochor in Northern Ireland:\n\nhttps://sites.google.com/site/zebras54gbbo00/bohemian-library/works-by-guests/linen\n\nThe History of Crepe Weavers, Newtownards - Interview with Milan Mladek:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or6FgQvHWS4\n\nLiving Linen Interviews:\n\nhttps://www.nmni.com/collections/history/sound-and-visual-media-archives/living-linen/hoyfmr2002104\n\nhttps://www.nmni.com/collections/history/sound-and-visual-media-archives/living-linen/hoyfmr2001150\n\nThe following list of Jewish doctors from Northern Ireland is not complete - plea"
