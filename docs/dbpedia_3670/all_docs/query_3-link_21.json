        "text": "Trevor Thompson, a three-year starter at quarterback for Thousand Oaks High, has made an oral commitment to play next season at California, he said Thursday evening.\n\nIn addition to Cal, Thompson, 17, took recruiting trips to Fresno State and New Mexico, and he has another visit scheduled to Colorado State that he said he will cancel. Thompson, who said he scored 1,120 on the Scholastic Aptitude Test, plans to major in business and minor in music.\n\nHe said the prestige of the Pacific 10 Conference was a major factor.\n\n“Playing in the (Pac-10) is something I’ve thought a lot about,” Thompson said. “The people at Fresno were nice, but (the area) reminded me too much of the (San Fernando) Valley.\n\n“The coaching staff (at Cal) really made me feel like they care about my development. The guys there also made me feel like I belong.”\n\nThe 6-foot-5, 189-pound Thompson is the prototype Division I-A quarterback, which is why he topped many recruiters’ lists despite a lackluster season.\n\nA severe shoulder injury ended Thompson’s high school career six games into his senior campaign.\n\nDuring a Marmonte League game Oct. 15 at Agoura, Thompson suffered a third-degree separation of his right shoulder after a collision with an Agoura player near the sideline. Thompson completed 50% of his passes (61 of 122) for 672 yards with three touchdowns and eight interceptions.\n\nThompson had surgery Oct. 23 and has made a rapid recovery. He began throwing a football two weeks ago.\n\nIn three seasons, Thompson completed 46% of his passes (137 of 301) for 1,579 yards with 14 touchdowns and 21 interceptions.\n\n“He didn’t pass for 3,000 yards but he is an athlete who is going to fill out,” Lancer Coach Bob Richards said. “The colleges see a talent they can develop.”"
