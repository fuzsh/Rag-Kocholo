        "text": "FSN Detroit (formerly known as Fox Sports Net Detroit) is a regional sports network that covers local sports teams in the state of Michigan. It is available in all of Michigan, northeast Indiana, northwest Ohio, some portions of northeast Wisconsin and nationwide via satellite. The FSN Detroit studios are based out of the FSN Northwest facility in Bellevue, Washington, and the control room for the network is located in Houston, Texas[1].\n\nHistory[]\n\nFSN Detroit originally launched as a competitor to the Post-Newsweek Stations' PASS Sports. After a surprise bid in 1996 to pick up the rights to the Detroit Pistons, FSN Detroit began planning to launch the network by 1997.\n\nHowever this changed when Detroit Red Wings and Detroit Tigers TV rights were up for bid. FSN Detroit decided to bid for the rights against PASS Sports and won them both. The Red Wings beginning with the 1997-98 NHL season and the Tigers beginning in 1998 MLB season. Washington Post sold the Tigers' and Pistons' contracts, and the contract of John Keating to FSN Detroit. [2].\n\nOn December 12, 2006, FSN Detroit became the first United States television station to have its play-by-play commentator at ice level when Detroit Red Wings play-by-play man Ken Daniels broadcasted the Wings-Senators game from between the benches, while color commentator Mickey Redmond remained in the booth. This will continue in the 2007-08 season as Larry Murphy will often provide his analysis from ice-level, with Ken Daniels and Mickey Redmond remaining in the booth. Murphy also retains his role as a studio analyst and fill-in color analyst.\n\nOn May 24 and May 25, 2007, legendary Tigers broadcaster Ernie Harwell filled in for Rod Allen as color commentator for games against the Los Angeles Angels. It was Harwell's first appearance on FSN Detroit as a live commentator since June 1, 2003, when he also filled in for Allen. [3].\n\nOn September 17, 2007, FSN Detroit celebrated its 10-year anniversary as a network. Currently, fans can vote for their favorite FSN Detroit moments in an online poll. [4] Options include the first program ever aired (A Red Wings preseason game), the \"Cold War\" hockey game played between Michigan and Michigan State, Justin Verlander's no-hitter against Milwaukee, and several other memorable moments. A 10-year anniversary special is scheduled for December.\n\nSports Coverage[]\n\nRed Wings: FSN Detroit has the rights to cover at least 65 Red Wings games in the regular season as well as some preseason games and the first two rounds of the playoffs.
