C. Work, in an opinion handed down yesterday in the estate of Charles Bernard Nelson, Wharton township, who died November 26, 1920, refused to admit testimony of Attorney W. R. Johnson in the claim of Clara Speers for $1,820.40 for services rendered as housekeeper for the deceased from April 1, 1917, till November 26, 1920. Attorney Johnson had driven to the home of the deceased to draw up his will and in the presence of his son the deceased stated that he did not know how much he owed his housekeeper but that she would know as she kept an account of it. He said he had paid her less than $100.\n\nClara Speers claimed $10 per week for services but had no written agreement or oral testimony outside that of the attorney and his son and this was not allowed in testimony. In the will, the deceased bequeathed $1,000 to My housekeeper, Clara Speers, who was named as executrix of the estate. In commenting upon the case, Judge Work stated, Where the client is dead and the communications to be testified to are such as would prejudice his estate, we think that as the clients lips are sealed by death the attorneys lips are sealed by law.\n\nThe assets were both real and personal. The personal amounted to $1,283.72. In settling the bills the personal estate was not sufficient to meet the debts and the executrix secured an order of Court to sell certain real estate. The total amounted to $7,432.05 and the balance $5,310.64. Testimony showed that the executrix not only took care of the deceaseds home but that she was in charge of his 134 acre farm of which 25 acres was cleared and that she worked on the farm the same as a man, sawing wood, farming, etc.\n\nThe Morning Herald, Uniontown, PA, Tuesday, May 22, 1923, page 3, column 3\n\nContributed by Brenda Turner Luckey < brenda.e.luckey at gmail.com>\n\nCharles S.
