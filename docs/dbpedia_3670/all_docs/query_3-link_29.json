        "text": "MOORE — Trevor Thompson's passing statistics last year weren't too bad — more than 1,100 yards and 10 touchdowns on 102 completions.\n\nJust what Westmoore needed, considering the offense was mostly based in a power run game that produced nearly two-thirds of the team's total yardage.\n\nBut this year, coach Billy Langford needed a little more from his quarterback, and Thompson has delivered — and then some.\n\nThompson threw for 283 yards and three touchdowns in a 28-12 win over Putnam City on Friday, vaulting the Jaguars into the Class 6A top 10 while earning The Oklahoman's City-Area Football Player of the Week honor.\n\nThrough eight games, Thompson has nearly doubled his touchdown total from a year ago with 19. He already has thrown for 300 more yards. He has attempted fewer passes, but completed more (119 of 208), hitting on better than 57 percent of his throws.\n\nLangford describes the growth of the passing game from last year to now as “night and day,” and it's a big reason why the Jags are 6-2 and in good position to secure another playoff bid this year.\n\n“Trevor has done a good job of taking care of the ball, and the receivers have done a good job of catching it,” the second-year coach said. “It's been a really good progression from those guys.”\n\nWith the boost in passing production, Westmoore has seen its scoring average rise from less than 21 to 33.0 points per game this year.\n\n“Just in the last two years, we've turned into a passing team,” Thompson said. “I have great receivers to throw to — two big 6-foot-4 guys on the outside, and good slot receivers on the inside. I've got a number of guys to throw to.\n\n“The average secondary we've faced this year is about 5-foot-11, so with those two big guys on the outside (Dalton Craig and Austin Bowling), if I'm ever in trouble, I know I can throw it up to them and they'll go make a play.”\n\nOf course, the Jags haven't completely abandoned the run, either. Austin Richards went over the 1,000-yard mark for the season in last week's win at PC, and he has scored 13 touchdowns.\n\nAdd to that a defense that has only allowed more than 17 points twice all year, and you can see why Westmoore is gaining confidence as the postseason approaches.\n\n“We've gained a whole lot of confidence as a team,” Thompson said. “We're really coming together as a whole, and growing as a family. It's been great for us.”"
