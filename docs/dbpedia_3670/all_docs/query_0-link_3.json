        "text": "Aaron William Hughes (born 8 November 1979) is a Northern Irish retired professional footballer who played as a defender. Hughes played mainly at centre back, but was also used at right back or left back, as well as anywhere in midfield. He is renowned for his disciplined defending, having made 455 Premier League appearances without getting sent off, which is the second-most in the history of the league, behind only Ryan Giggs.He began his career with Newcastle United, making his debut in 1997 and playing 279 games for the club across all competitions. He remained with the club until 2005, when he was transferred to Aston Villa for £1 million, and two years later he was signed by his former international manager Lawrie Sanchez to play for Fulham. He spent six-and-a-half seasons at Fulham, reaching the UEFA Europa League final in 2010. After leaving the club in January 2014, he had brief spells in the Championship with Queens Park Rangers and Brighton & Hove Albion, and abroad with Melbourne City FC and Kerala Blasters FC. Hughes made his full international debut aged 18 in 1998 and has earned 110 caps for Northern Ireland, the second most in the nation's history, behind goalkeeper Pat Jennings. He captained the national team from 2003 up to international retirement in 2011, but returned to the team the following year and was included in their squad for UEFA Euro 2016.\n\nAdrian Coote (born 30 September 1978 in Belton, near Great Yarmouth) is a former professional footballer. Coote, a striker, came through the youth system at Norwich City, for whom he scored 3 goals in 61 appearances. While at Carrow Road, he won six full international caps with Northern Ireland. Norwich sold Coote to Colchester United for £50,000, but was unable to establish himself in the side, and, after a loan spell at Bristol Rovers where he scored once against Leyton Orient, he was released by Colchester shortly after the start of the 2003-04 season. Since leaving Layer Road, Coote has played for a series of non-league clubs in Norfolk including Wroxham. Coote, who is now a sales manager for Brighthouse, said: \"I did have some injury problems. I just fell out of love with football and am now moving on with my life - which is a good life.\"\n\nAidan John Davison (born 11 May 1968) is an English-born Northern Irish former professional footballer and Goalkeeping Coach of Pune City. As a player, he played as a goalkeeper from 1987 until 2008. Having started his career with non-league side Billingham Synthonia, he moved on to Notts County and subsequently spent loan spells with Leyton Orient and Bury before joining the latter on a permanent deal. He went on to play for Chester City, Blackpool and Milwall before earning his biggest break yet by signing for Bolton Wanderers and in 1995 gaining promotion to the Premier League. Loan spells with Ipswich Town and Hull City followed before joining Bradford City permanently. In 1997, he signed for Grimsby Town where he arguably played some of his best football having won promotion and a domestic cup in his two years at the club. He went on to Sheffield United and then returned to Premier League football when he re-joined Bradford City in 2000. In 2003, he returned to Grimsby Town for a year before finishing his career with a four-year spell at Colchester United. In his career, he was capped three times by Northern Ireland. In 2009 following his retirement he joined the coaching staff of Premier League Hull City and became the club's reserve team manager. In 2010, he briefly came out of retirement and signed as a player to add to the club's goalkeeping cover, however he only made the substitute bench for the reserve team he managed. In 2011, he became head coach of American side FC Jax Destroyers. In 2018 December he appointed as goalkeeping coach of Pune City in Indian Super League."
