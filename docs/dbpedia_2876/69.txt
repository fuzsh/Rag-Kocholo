The Health Facility Development Bureau (HFDB) of the Department of Health of the Philippines formulates policies and develops standards for the establishment, development, management and operations of health facilities in the country. The HFDB assumes technical leadership and coordination of health facility development initiatives of the government and its partners. Improving delivery of health services and determining critical areas for continuous improvement of patient-centered quality care are the Bureau's utmost priorities.

The HFDB is part of the Health Regulation and Facility Development Cluster (HRFDC), one of the clusters that comprise the functional organizational structure of the DOH for the Implementation of the 8-Point Action Agenda: Medium-Term Strategy for the Health Sector, 2023-2028. As part of the HRFDC, the HFDB takes the Office of Health Laboratories (OHL) and the Health Facilities Enhancement Program (HFEP) under its management.
