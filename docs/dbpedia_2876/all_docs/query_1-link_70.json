        "text": "Use the Healthy Travel Packing List for Philippines for a list of health-related items to consider packing for your trip. Talk to your doctor about which items are most important for you.\n\nWhy does CDC recommend packing these health-related items?\n\nItâ€™s best to be prepared to prevent and treat common illnesses and injuries. Some supplies and medicines may be difficult to find at your destination, may have different names, or may have different ingredients than what you normally use.\n\nIf you are not feeling well after your trip, you may need to see a doctor. If you need help finding a travel medicine specialist, see Find a Clinic. Be sure to tell your doctor about your travel, including where you went and what you did on your trip. Also tell your doctor if you were bitten or scratched by an animal while traveling.\n\nIf your doctor prescribed antimalarial medicine for your trip, keep taking the rest of your pills after you return home. If you stop taking your medicine too soon, you could still get sick.\n\nMalaria is always a serious disease and may be a deadly illness. If you become ill with a fever either while traveling in a malaria-risk area or after you return home (for up to 1 year), you should seek immediate medical attention and should tell the doctor about your travel history.\n\nFor more information on what to do if you are sick after your trip, see Getting Sick after Travel."
