        "text": "Overview\n\nSecurity status\n\nHigh Degree of Caution\n\nGeneral Travel Advice\n\nIrish citizens do not require a visa to enter the Philippines for an initial period up to 30 days.\n\nA valid passport is required for travel to the Philippines. Irish passports should have a minimum validity of 6 months. Citizens must also have a valid return or onward ticket within thirty (30) days of arrival in the Philippines. Passport cards cannot be used.\n\nIrish citizens travelling to the Philippines are required to register their intention to travel to the Philippines on this website. Citizens may do so at any point from 72 hours before their arrival in the Philippines until the departure of their flight.\n\nFor more information on visas and passports, please see the Philippine Bureau of Immigration website here.\n\nVisitors to the Philippines are advised to follow the guidance of national and local authorities and stay fully informed of what's going on by monitoring local news and social media.\n\nCitizens can also follow the Embassy on social media (Twitter@IrlEmbManila and Facebook ) to ensure access to relevant updates and alerts.\n\nEmergency Assistance\n\nThe best help is often close at hand so if you have problems, try talking to your local contacts, tour operator representative or hotel management.\n\nYou can contact the emergency services in the Philippines by dialling 911.\n\nOur tips for Safe Travels:\n\nGet comprehensive travel insurance that covers all your planned activities.\n\nRegister your details with us so that we can contact you quickly if there’s an unforeseen crisis like a natural disaster or a family emergency.\n\nFollow us on twitter @dfatravelwise for the latest travel updates.\n\nRead our ‘Know Before You Go’ guide.\n\nSafety and Security\n\nSafety and security\n\nUnrest\n\nWe advise against all travel to the BARMM area of South West Mindanao and the Sulu Archipelago and advise a high degree of caution to the remainder of Mindanao and to the south of Cebu province, up to and including the municipalities of Dalaguete and Badian. If you’re travelling to the Philippines, always keep yourself informed of what’s going on around you by monitoring local media and staying in contact with your hotel or tour organiser. Avoid demonstrations and public gatherings, which can sometimes turn confrontational. The Philippines Bureau of Immigration has specifically warned foreign nationals against participating in public protests and political rallies. Foreign nationals who participate in these activities may be detained and deported for violating Philippine immigration laws.\n\nTerrorism\n\nThere is a risk of terrorism in the Philippines. Terrorist groups continue to plan attacks and have the capacity and the intent to carry out attacks at anytime and anywhere in the country, including in Manila. Attacks could be indiscriminate, including in places frequented by expatriates and foreign travellers like airports, shopping malls and places of worship. Be aware of the risk of terrorist attacks to all forms of public transport: road, rail, sea and air. Terrorist groups have threatened to attack passenger ferries and other vessels, particularly those operating from Mindanao. You should avoid using public transport throughout Mindanao.\n\nKidnapping\n\nThere is a threat from kidnapping, particularly in the southern Philippines. Kidnapping could occur anywhere, including on coastal and island resorts and on dive boats and sites in the Sulu Sea. Foreigners have been targeted in rural, urban and coastal areas in the past.\n\nCrime\n\nThere’s a high level of violent crime, including gun crime. Criminal gangs sometimes use terrorist tactics like kidnapping. Explosions attributed to criminal organisations have caused fatalities.\n\nThere is a high incidence of street crime and robbery. Some taxi drivers and their accomplices have robbed and harmed passengers. Be particularly vigilant when travelling on public transport. Armed hold-ups have occurred on ‘jeepneys’ and buses. In some cases these have resulted in fatalities.\n\nYou should take sensible precautions.\n\nArrange to be met at the airport or use a hotel transfer service. Only use taxis from a reputable company.\n\nDon’t carry your credit card, travel tickets and money together - leave spare cash and valuables in a safe place.\n\nDon’t carry your passport unless absolutely necessary and leave a copy of your passport (and travel and insurance documents) with family or friends at home.\n\nBeware of strangers offering drinks or confectionery that may be spiked.\n\nAlways be careful about your personal safety. Get advice from local contacts, avoid travel off the beaten track and always leave travel plans with friends, colleagues or relatives. Safety standards on taxis, buses and boats can be low.\n\nReporting a crime\n\nIf you’re a victim of a crime while in the Philippines, report it to the local police immediately. And you can contact us at the Irish Embassy in Manila if you need help.\n\nDriving\n\nIf you’re planning to drive in Philippines, bring your full Irish driver’s licence and your international driving permit driving license and make sure you have adequate and appropriate insurance\n\nHiring a vehicle\n\nIf you’re hiring a vehicle, we advise you not to hand over your passport as a form of security. If you’re allowing your passport to be photocopied, keep it in your sight at all times.\n\nCheck that you have adequate insurance and read the small print of the vehicle hire contract (particularly any waiver that will come into effect if the vehicle is damaged).\n\nAir travel\n\nWith the exception of Philippine Airlines (PAL) and Cebu Pacific Air, all air carriers from the Philippines have been refused permission to operate services to the EU due to safety concerns.\n\nSea travel\n\nAvoid travel on ferries if possible. Ferries are often overloaded, lack necessary lifesaving equipment, are not adequately maintained and have incomplete passenger manifests. Storms can develop quickly.\n\nThere is a high level of piracy and armed robbery against ships in and around Philippine waters.\n\nMaritime rescue services in the Philippines may be limited.\n\nLocal laws and customs\n\nRemember, the local laws apply to you as a visitor and it is your responsibility to follow them. Be sensitive to local customs, traditions and practices as your behaviour may be seen as improper, hostile or may even be illegal.\n\nIllegal drugs\n\nDon’t become involved with drugs of any kind. Penalties for importing and using illegal drugs are severe.\n\nPersonal identification\n\nYou must be able to show some identification if requested by the police. A photocopy of the relevant pages of your passport will suffice. Leave details of your travel plans, passport and credit cards with friends and family and make sure the next of kin details in your passport are up to date.\n\nLaw enforcement\n\nPhilippine law on paedophile activity is severe, and strictly enforced. A child is defined in Philippine law as a person under the age of 18. Entrapment may also occur where strangers with children have befriended single male tourists; allegations of abuse are then made in an attempt to extort money.\n\nRecruitment\n\nAny foreign national planning to recruit Filipinos for employment overseas must carry out due diligence, comply with local legislation and be licensed. The laws relating to illegal recruitment are strict. Foreign nationals have been known to spend more than two years in prison on remand while their cases are processed.\n\nAdditional information\n\nEntry requirements (visa/passport)\n\nVisas\n\nUnder normal circumstances, Irish passport holders can enter the Philippines without a visa for an initial period of 30 days. Entry to the Philippines may be refused if you are unable to produce evidence of return or onward travel - for example an onward or return air ticket. You can apply to extend your stay at the offices of the Bureau of Immigration Overstaying without the proper authority is a serious matter and can lead to detention pending payment of outstanding fees and fines and voluntary deportation at your own expense.\n\nIf you’re unsure of the entry requirements for the Philippines, including visa and other immigration information, ask your travel agent or contact the nearest Embassy or Consulate of the Philippines.\n\nPassport\n\nMake sure your passport is valid for a minimum of six months after the conclusion of your trip to the Philippines (or other countries within South East Asia).\n\nDuring your stay you should carry a photocopy of your passport and your arrival card at all times so you can show evidence of your identity if asked, for example, by the police.\n\nChildren travelling to the Philippines without their parents\n\nForeign minors (under 15 years of age) who are not travelling with one or both parents, or not coming to join a parent in the Philippines are required to carry a copy of their parents’ resident visa. Parents of children travelling unaccompanied to the Philippines must file an ‘affidavit of support’ with the nearest Philippines Embassy or Bureau of Immigration. Contact the nearest Philippine Embassy or Consulate for further information.\n\nHealth\n\nMedical facilities\n\nThe availability of medical care varies across the Philippines, and may not meet the standards of care in the Europe. Although adequate in major cities, medical care is limited in more remote areas. Treatment can be very expensive. Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation.\n\nIf you need emergency medical assistance during your trip, dial 117 and ask for an ambulance. You should contact your insurance/medical assistance company promptly if you are referred to a medical facility for treatment.\n\nWater-borne diseases\n\nWater-borne diseases, including typhoid and cholera, are endemic in the Philippines. You should use only boiled or bottled water and avoid ice in drinks.\n\nRabies\n\nThere is a risk of rabies throughout the Philippines."
