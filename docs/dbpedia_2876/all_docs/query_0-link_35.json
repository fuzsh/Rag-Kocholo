        "text": "Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) pose one of the main health challenges of the twenty-first century; of the estimated 57 million global deaths in 2008, 36 million (63%) were due to NCDs.1 From the Global Burden of Disease projections, an estimated 2.6 million people died from NCDs in the 10 Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries, and the mortality rate adjusted to age per 100 000 population is high in low-income countries.2,3 The largest proportion of NCD deaths is caused by cardiovascular disease (48%), followed by cancers (21%) and chronic respiratory diseases (12%).\n\nTobacco use is an important behavioural risk factor that is responsible for 12% of male deaths and 6% of female deaths in the world.4 Exposure to second-hand smoke (SHS) is estimated to cause more than 600 000 premature deaths annually. These include 166 000 deaths from lower respiratory infections, 35 800 from asthma (1100 from asthma in children), 21 000 from lung cancer and 379 000 from ischaemic heart disease in adults. This disease burden amounts in total to about 10.9 million disability-adjusted life years. Of all deaths attributable to SHS, 28% occur in children and 47% in women.5 Tobacco use is the leading cause of preventable death, and is estimated to kill more than 5 million people each year worldwide; if current trends persist, tobacco will kill more than 8 million people worldwide each year by the year 2030, with 80% of these premature deaths in low- and middle-income countries.6,7 In the Philippines, tobacco kills at least 87 600 Filipinos per year (240 deaths every day); one third of these are men in the most productive age of their lives.8\n\nThe most effective tobacco control policies are contained in the World Health Organization (WHO) Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC),9 which is the first global health treaty, and encapsulated in the corresponding MPOWER policy package.10 In the Philippines, the FCTC was ratified in 2005 by the Senate and signed by the President, i.e., the ratification itself went through a legislative process. Parties to this legally binding international treaty must enact new laws or amend existing ones so that they are consistent with the FCTC. Progress in implementation of the FCTC is monitored and reported by the WHO.6,7,11 The South-East Asia Tobacco Control Alliance also publishes reports on FCTC implementation (http://www.seatca.org/). Since 2007, Bloomberg Philanthropies has supported the implementation of proven policies to accelerate the reduction of tobacco use worldwide; as of 2012, the total commitment confirmed under this initiative is more than US$600 million;12 the Philippines has received some US$5 million through grants to government and civil society under this initiative.13 Discussion in the peer-reviewed literature of tobacco control and related issues specifically with respect to the Philippines has been limited to date, with some noteworthy exceptions.14–23 This article provides an overview of progress in the country since the 2005 ratification of the WHO FCTC to the end of 2012, and provides a particular focus on the grants programme funded under the Bloomberg Initiative.\n\nPROGRESS IN TOBACCO CONTROL IN THE PHILIPPINES\n\nThe Philippines started to implement tobacco control efforts in 1987 and has intensified them over time. Since then, despite the strong lobbying of the tobacco industry, the country has successfully passed the Republic Act 9211 (Tobacco Regulation Act of 2003); despite several shortcomings, this Act was designed to promote a healthy environment and protect citizens from the hazards of tobacco smoke, inform the public of the health risks associated with cigarette smoking and tobacco use, regulate and subsequently ban all tobacco advertisement and sponsorships, except at point of sale, regulate labelling of tobacco products, and protect young people from being initiated to cigarette smoking and tobacco use through access restrictions.\n\nThe country ratified the WHO FCTC in 2005.8 In 2009, the WHO Regional Office for the Western Pacific released a Regional Action Plan (RAP) for the Tobacco Free Initiative in the Western Pacific. The RAP had four overall indicators to be achieved by 2014: 1) all countries to have developed a national action plan and national coordinating mechanism, 2) all parties in the Region to have ratified all WHO FCTC protocols, 3) reliable data on adult and youth tobacco use to be available in all countries, and 4) the prevalence of adult and youth current tobacco use (smoking and smokeless) to be reduced by 10% from the most recent base-line. The RAP set out specific actions for countries and suggested country-level indicators; it was and remains an important influence on tobacco control activities within countries in the Region, including the Philippines.28\n\nThe Bloomberg Initiative to Reduce Tobacco Use was designed to accelerate the reduction of tobacco use worldwide through the implementation in particular of WHO FCTC/MPOWER strategies. One important stream of investment under this initiative is the Grants Program, which is jointly managed on behalf of Bloomberg Philanthropies by the International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease (The Union) and the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids. Details about grants awarded, on the publicly available Program website, indicate that for the funding period commencing July 2007 and ending June 2014, some 23 grants were awarded to both non-governmental and governmental organisations in the Philippines, with a total investment in excess of US$4.9 million.13 The key historical progression points of tobacco control in the country are illustrated in .\n\nIn mid-2011, a group of national, international and WHO health experts, in collaboration with a team from the Republic of the Philippines Department of Health (DOH), assessed the country’s tobacco control efforts in implementing the WHO FCTC. The assessment considered existing tobacco epidemiological data, as well as the status and present development efforts of key tobacco control measures undertaken by the government in collaboration with other sectors. The report of this Joint National Capacity Assessment on the Implementation of Effective Tobacco Control Policies identified some of the key achievements as well as significant challenges to the continued progress of tobacco control in the country.8 , showing the Philippines tobacco control timeline 1987–2012, is adapted from the report of the Joint National Capacity Assessment. Points of progress since FCTC ratification include the 2009 Food and Drug Administration (FDA) law RA9711, which allowed for the FDA to regulate tobacco and tobacco products; the 2010 issuance of CSC-DOH No. 2010-01 ( Joint Memorandum Circular Civil Service Commission [CSC] and DOH, which promulgates the policy on protection of the bureaucracy from tobacco industry interference, covering all national and local government officials and employees); the 2011 issuance of DOH DO (Department Order) 2011–0029, which established the National Tobacco Control Coordinating Office (NTCCO) within the DOH, and the 2012 launch of the Philippines first National Tobacco Control Strategy (NTCS).\n\nThe achievements and challenges of tobacco control in the Philippines from the perspective of Joint National Capacity Assessment are presented in . Note that the challenge of addressing tobacco industry interference in government policy through full implementation of Article 5.3 is in addition to those identified explicitly in the Joint National Capacity Assessment; the report does nonetheless point out (page 19) that it was ‘clearly stated by interviewed stakeholders that the tobacco industry’s ubiquitous presence in the decision-making process could be the main obstacle in taking effective tobacco control measures to protect the health of the Filipinos’. We agree with this perspective, and felt that the addition of a specific item on tobacco industry interference was justified. Another addition is the amendment of the national tobacco control act RA9211 to be consistent with WHO FCTC; central issues here are as follows: 1) the composition of the Interagency Committee on Tobacco (created by RA 9211) is inclusive of the Philippine Tobacco Institute and thus blatantly in conflict with WHO FCTC Article 5.3; 2) the current law allows the establishment of designated smoking areas, either indoors or outdoors, in public places, which not only creates a challenge for enforcement but also fails to protect public health effectively; 3) the definition of public places needs to be refined to include confined and open public places (the law has a definition for an enclosed area but none for a confined area); and 4) the current provisions on health warnings and advertising bans are not FCTC-consistent.\n\nTABLE 1\n\nAchievements in tobacco controlSignificant challenges remainingRatified FCTC (2005); introduced new law (2012) to simplify tobacco tax structure, raise tobacco product excise taxes and increase tax by 8% every 2 years from 2018Amend national law to be fully consistent with FCTC, especially on smoke-free policy and TAPSCommitted to controlling non-communicable diseases, many of which are attributable to tobacco use, under an MDG framework as part of the universal health coverage strategyReduce uptake through stronger prevention efforts; develop a coordinated national cessation infrastructure that incorporates both population and clinical approachesCommitted officials for tobacco control in DOHStrengthen whole-of-government commitment to tobacco control and to FCTC implementationPassed RA 9211, which was an achievement for its timeAmend national tobacco act RA9211 for full consistency with WHO FCTC* (for example, the need to disallow designated smoking areas)Introduced important restrictions in TAPSMove from partial to comprehensive TAPS ban; strengthen mass media activities—implement sustained public awareness campaigns with effective contentImplemented smoke-free indoor environments in many government agenciesExtend to offices of the presidential appointees, cabinet members, executive service officers, elected officials, members of constitutional commissions and judiciarySubstantial efforts on strong graphic warnings (court case pending)Graphic health warnings on all tobacco packages (DOH AO2010-13) need to be implementedProduced good tobacco surveillance data for both adults and youthEnsure surveillance is ongoing, sustainable and institutionalisedIntroduced effective mechanisms to monitor and prevent the influence of the tobacco industry on governmentAddress tobacco industry interference in government policy through full and strict implementation of Article 5.3*Achieved great progress at the local government level in passing smoke-free ordinancesAddress lack of financial and technical support for sustained countrywide reach; increase the number of local government units with 100% smoke-free policy initiativesStrong and vibrant civil society organisations devoted to tobacco controlNeed for sustainability and ongoing coordination; need to strengthen monitoring and prevention of industry interference\n\nProgress can also be considered in terms of the level of implementation of FCTC and MPOWER strategies (http://www.who.int/tobacco/mpower/en/); data on the status of global tobacco control policy implementation and the countries’ level of attainment of the six MPOWER measures have been produced by the WHO in 2011,11 with previous iterations in 20097 and 2008.6 Based on these data and on the report of the Joint National Capacity Assessment,8 it is our view that partial implementation has been achieved across all MPOWER components, except in O (offer help to quit tobacco use) and E (enforce bans on tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorship), where implementation has been minimal. It is our view that full implementation has yet to be achieved in any one of the six components.\n\nThe framework of the NTCS ( ) and a summary description of the grants awarded under the Bloomberg Initiative to Reduce Tobacco Use ( ) are shown here. More details on the specific grants and organisations are available online.13\n\nTABLE 2\n\nBloomberg grant recipientsStrategic focus of the grantsFramework Convention on Tobacco Control Alliance Philippines (non-governmental)Leadership, capacity and network development; promotion of stronger taxation policy, smoke-free public places, health warnings, strict ban on TAPSDOH–Regional Focus Centre for Health Development Metro Manila/DoH Policy Development & Planning Bureau (governmental)Intensified implementation of tobacco control legislation (RA9211) in selected regions and cities; emphasis on 100% smoke-free public placesAction for Economic Reforms (non-governmental)Secure the passage of a law to reform and increase tobacco taxation in the PhilippinesHealth Justice Foundation (non-governmental)Legal and technical support to government as necessary for full implementation of WHO-FCTCMetropolitan Manila Development Authority (governmental)Enforcement of 100% smoke-free environment in Metropolitan ManilaNew Vois Association of the Philippines Inc (non-governmental)Mobilisation of grassroots support for tax reform through civil society organisations, building capacity of tobacco victimsCivil Service Commission (governmental)Protection of civil service against tobacco industry interference (as per Article 5.3 of the WHO-FCTC)University of the Philippines College of Law Development Foundation (non-governmental)Capacity building among responsible agencies and officials for better enforcement of legislationDepartment of Health: National Center for Health Promotion (governmental)Establishment of National Tobacco Control Coordinating Office and National Tobacco Control StrategyADD+Vantage Community Team Services Inc (non-governmental)Enforcement of 100% smoke-free ordinances within the Province of Albay\n\nNote that the purpose of one Bloomberg grant described in was to support the establishment of the NTCCO within the DOH and the development of an NTCS, both of which were achieved. In addition, the grant to Action for Economic Reforms had a specific focus on taxation reform which, with the consolidated efforts of the Filipino tobacco control constituency, was substantially achieved on 11 December 2012, when Congress ratified the so-called ‘Sin Tax’ bill.30 President Aquino signed the Sin Tax reform bill into law on Thursday 20 December 2012, and it came into effect on 1 January 2013. For cigarettes (machine packed) the tax rate prescribed in the first year of implementation is 1) PHP12.00 (1 Philippine Peso [PHP] = US$0.024) per pack if the net retail price (excluding the excise tax and the value-added tax) is PHP11.50 and below per pack, and 2) PHP25.00 per pack if the net retail price (excluding the excise tax and the value-added tax) is more than PHP11.50 per pack. The Act stipulates higher tax rates in subsequent years, and also states that ‘the proper tax classification of cigarettes, whether registered before or after the effectivity of this Act, shall be determined every two (2) years’.31\n\nThe Union has also, under the Bloomberg Initiative, recently negotiated a new grant with the CSC of the Philippines. Working to ensure protection of the civil service against tobacco industry interference (in line with Article 5.3 of the WHO-FCTC), the CSC will use a policy instrument known as CSC-DOH Joint Memorandum Circular 2010-01 as a cornerstone, drawing also on recently developed resources such as the FCTC Article 5.3 Toolkit: Guidance for Governments on Preventing Tobacco Industry Interference, published by The Union in 2012 and available online.32 It should be noted that this Joint Memorandum Circular applies to elected officials as well as the rest of the civil service."
