        "text": "ACCESS Health is a trusted partner of the Philippines Department of Health in their effort to close gaps in access to affordable and high quality healthcare. Under the government’s leadership, ACCESS Health led efforts to understand the impact of corporatization of public hospitals in the Philippines, evaluating the impact of corporatization on the efficiency, equity and quality of services of care in the public hospitals. Our work informs both national and local governments as they explore proposed reforms to federalize the country. ACCESS Health Philippines also supports the Philippines Department of Health Policy Development and Planning Bureau and the Health Facility Development Bureau as they formulate policies and define rules and regulations for all health initiatives across the country.\n\nACCESS Health Philippines leads our tuberculosis work in the region. The Philippines team is working on a new public private partnership that will bring much needed tuberculosis counseling, screening, diagnostic testing, and treatment to a select city in Metropolitan Manila. The project is funded by TB REACH, a funding mechanism under the Stop TB Partnership and supported primarily by Global Affairs Canada, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), and the Indonesian Health Fund."
