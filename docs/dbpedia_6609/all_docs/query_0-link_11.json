A rich variety of subjects, which are showing the possibility of archeology, characterizes published texts. Articles dedicated to issues between archeology and other disciplines (mainly history, history, science and technology) are often inserted. Chronological frameworks embrace a wide range of the Stone Age to the present day. [1]"
