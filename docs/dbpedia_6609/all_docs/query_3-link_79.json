Through the excavation of sites and by the analysis of the physical evidence those sites contain (structures, objects, human, animal and plant remains), archaeologists reconstruct past human lives, activities, and environments.

How has historical colonialism impacted Indigenous identities today? As an interdisciplinary major, Archaeological Studies, sits at the nexus of science and culture, exploring human society through its material remains.\n\nFaculty Mentorship, Fieldwork, and Collections Research\n\nFaculty mentors connect each student to opportunities for real, hands-on experience, from fieldwork projects around the world to curatorial research with collections right here on campus. Plus, you can bake cuneiform cookies with an active student-run archaeology club. Our approach to material culture studies emphasizes collaboration, ethical approaches to cultural heritage, and data management skills. Graduates go on to work as academics, researchers, curators, librarians, and educators."
