        "text": "The question of the origins of the Sámi people of Northern Scandinavia and Russia has long been contentious. How did they come to speak a Finno-Ugric language? A promising explanation has recently been put forth by Ante Aikio, viz. that speakers of Proto-Sámi merged with and assimilated ancient hunter-gath-erers who had long inhabited the interior of the Scandinavian peninsula and whom Aikio calls Palaeo-Europeans. The present paper finds anthropological, archaeological and genetic evidence that helps corroborate Aikio's theory. There are numerous examples of mutually beneficial contacts between Sámi ancestors and other dwellers on the Scandinavian peninsula; for example, the Sámi produced commodities that were in demand among Germanic (Norwegians, Swedes) peoples living in Scandinavia. The Saami siida system of relatively small groups opened them to outside influence from Proto-Sámi speakers. Finally, phyloge-netic evidence confirms the widespread contacts between the Sámi and others as well as the mutual influence between groups.\n\nAny historical study of Sámi religions links religion to the history of the language. Here, Proto-Sámi language spread is reviewed and the fundamental (and often implicit) assumption that religion spread with Proto-Sámi language is challenged. An alternative model that language spread as a medium of communication adopted by different cultures is proposed and tested against the Common Proto-Sámi lexicon. The finding is a lack of positive evidence for the spread of religion with Proto-Sámi language, while the name of the central sky-god / thunder-god in Sámi languages on the Kola Peninsula is identified as a loan from an indigenous language, indicating some degree of religious continuity through language change. The lack of positive lexical evidence for a spread of religion combines with evidence that vocabulary and apparently traditions linked to ritual and belief spread through the Proto-Sámi language networks subsequent to its spread. In addition, the archaeological record does not present positive evidence of spread of religion with the language and instead archaeological cultures seem to exhibit continuities through the relevant period. The paper concludes that religion formations documented among later Sámi language groups cannot be assumed to derive from a common Proto-Sámi religion or even to have an Uralic background. Instead, it is possible or even probable that the diversity in later Sámi religions could be an outcome of multiple other linguistic cultural groups shifting to Proto-Sámi language while maintaining their vernacular religion, or at least parts of it. Consequently, generalizations about 'Sámi' religion, claims about common Sámi religious heritage, and also uses of Sámi evidence in comparisons with Uralic traditions should be built on arguments rather than assumptions."
