        "text": "Archeologists learn about cultures in the past through their material remains. A culture is a people's way of life. It consists of traditions, religions, laws, social structures, languages, and foodways.\n\nEvery culture is unique, but all humans share universal traits that typically contribute to their culture. One culture may recognize aspects of another culture, even if their objects, beliefs and values differ. This is true even for cultures living in different historical times. Think about how all people:\n\nHave families and communities\n\nGrow and collect food, prepare meals, and eat\n\nBuild, inhabit, and maintain shelters\n\nMake and use tools\n\nCreate iconography, shapes, and symbols\n\nGather together for ceremonies, celebrations, and special events\n\nMove from place to place\n\nHave traditions and objects representing them\n\nAppropriate old things for new uses\n\nAll these ways of life can be found at archeological sites because people were there, even though the evidence for them might vary from culture to culture, Comparing across sites shows the ways that people and cultures lived together and adapted to the world through different cultural means.\n\nArcheologists study material remains in their temporal, historical, social, and geographical contexts to understand the peoples and cultures assocated with them. Context is key!\n\nThink about what you believe and how your possessions represent your culture. What might an archeologist find in the future?"
