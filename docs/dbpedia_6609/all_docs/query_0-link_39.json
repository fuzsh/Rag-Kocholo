        "text": "This is the Table of Contents by topic for the 1st edition of the Encyclopedia of Global Archaeology. The second edition is currently underway, seeking to fill gaps in the first edition and to extend the work. This compendium is both a print reference and an online reference work. The 11-volume first edition provides a comprehensive and systematic coverage of archaeology that is unprecedented, not only in terms of the use of multi-media, but also in terms of content. It encompasses the breadth of the subject along with key aspects that are tapped from other disciplines. It includes all time periods and regions of the world and all stages of human development. Mostly importantly, this encyclopedia includes the knowledge of leading scholars from around the world. The Encyclopedia of Global Archaeology has two outstanding innovations. The first is that scholars were able to submit entries in their own language. Over 300,000 words have been translated from French, Spanish, Portuguese, German, Italian, Japanese, Turkish and Russian. Many of these entries are by scholars who are publishing in English for the first time. The encyclopediaâ€™s second major innovation is that it harnesses the capabilities of an online environment, enhancing both the presentation and dissemination of information. Most particularly, the continuous updating allowed by an online environment should ensure that the Encyclopedia of Global Archaeology is a definitive reference work for archaeology and archaeologists. The entries in this encyclopedia range from succinct summaries of specific sites and the scientific aspects of archaeological enquiry to detailed discussions of archaeological concepts, theories and methods, and from investigations into the social, ethical and political dimensions of archaeological practice to biographies of leading archaeologists from throughout the world. The different forms of archaeology are explored, along with the techniques used for each and the challenges, concerns and issues that face archaeologists today.\n\nThis is the Table of Contents for the 2nd edition of the Encyclopedia of Global Archaeology. At the top of the list are entries for which we still need authors. If you are able to write this entry or can recommend someone to do this, please email me at claire.smith@flinders.edu.au Please email me if you can identify gaps that still need to be filled. The 2nd edition will be published in hard copy in 2020. New entries will go online after that have been reviewed and finalised. Entries can be written by scholars in their own language. We will have them translated into English. Thank you for supporting this mammoth project! Professor Claire Smith"
