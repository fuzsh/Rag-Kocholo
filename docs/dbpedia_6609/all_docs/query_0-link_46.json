        "text": "An international peer-reviewed English-language journal specializing in synthetic articles and in long reviews, the Journal of Greek Archaeology appears annually each Autumn. The scope of the journal is Greek archaeology both in the Aegean and throughout the wider Greek-inhabited world, from earliest Prehistory to the Modern Era. Thus we include contributions not just from traditional periods such as Greek Prehistory and the Classical Greek to Hellenistic eras, but also from Roman through Byzantine, Crusader and Ottoman Greece and into the Early Modern period. Outside of the Aegean contributions are welcome covering the Archaeology of the Greeks overseas, likewise from Prehistory into the Modern World. Greek Archaeology for the purposes of the JGA thus includes the Archaeology of the Hellenistic World, Roman Greece, Byzantine Archaeology, Frankish and Ottoman Archaeology, and the Postmedieval Archaeology of Greece and of the Greek Diaspora.\n\nThe Seminar for Arabian Studies is the only annual international forum for the presentation of the latest academic research on the Arabian Peninsula. The subjects covered include archaeology, history, epigraphy, languages, literature, art, culture, ethnography, geography, etc. from the earliest times to the present day or, in the case of political and social history, to the end of the Ottoman Empire (1922).\n\nThe Proceedings are always published in time for the conference the following year – a record for the publication of conference proceedings. Between 50 and 60 papers are presented each year, together with many posters. Over 200 scholars and students from countries throughout the world attend the Seminar each year. Interested members of the public are also very welcome.\n\nSpecial Sessions\n\nAs well as the wide range of subjects covered in its main sessions, the Seminar also offers the opportunity for more detailed discussion of a particular area of research by invited speakers in a Special Session, lasting either half a day or a full day. The papers read at a Special Session will be considered for publication either in the Proceedings of the Seminar for Arabian Studies (PSAS) or in a separate volume as a Supplement to PSAS.\n\nThe Journal of Hellenistic Pottery and Material Culture - JHP - was launched 2016 in Berlin, Germany, by Renate Rosenthal-Heginbottom, Patricia Kögler and Wolf Rudolph - specialists working in the field of Hellenistic material culture.\n\nJHP is an independent learned journal dedicated to the research of ceramics and objects of daily use of the Hellenistic period in the Mediterranean region and beyond. It aims at bringing together archaeologists, historians, philologists, numismatists and scholars of related disciplines engaged in the research of the Hellenistic heritage.\n\nJHP wants to be a forum for discussion and circulation of information on the everyday culture of the Hellenistic period which to date is still a rather neglected field of study. To fill this academic void the editors strive for a speedy and non-bureaucratic publication and distribution of current research and recent discoveries combined with a high quality standard. The journal appears annually in print and as a free online downloadable PDF.\n\nEx Novo is a fully peer reviewed open access international journal that promotes interdisciplinary research focusing on the multiple relations between archaeology and society. It engages with contemporary perspectives on antiquity linking past and present, and encourages archaeology’s engagement with theoretical developments from other related disciplines such as history, anthropology, political sciences, philosophy, social sciences and colonial studies. Ex Novo encompasses prehistory to modern period, and by exploring interconnections between archaeological practice and the importance of the past in current society it encourages an exploration of current theoretical, political and heritage issues connected to the discipline.\n\nAreas and topics of interest include: politics and archaeology, public archaeology, the legacies of colonialism and nationalism within the discipline, the articulation between local and global archaeological traditions, the discipline’s involvement in memory and identity, museum studies and restitution issues. Ex Novo encourages dialogue between disciplines concerned with the past and its relevance, uses and interpretations in the present\n\nAntiguo Oriente (abbreviated as AntOr) is the annual, peer-reviewed, scholarly journal published by the Center of Studies of Ancient Near Eastern History (CEHAO). The journal publishes manuscripts related to the history of societies of the Ancient Near East and the Eastern Mediterranean from the Paleolithic to the Early Islamic Period. Antiguo Oriente publishes articles and book reviews in Spanish, English and French.\n\nThe journal is indexed and/or ranked in AWOL - The Ancient World Online; Bielefeld Academic Search Engine (BASE), Bielefeld University; Bibliographie biblique informatisée de Lausanne (BiBIL), Université de Lausanne; Clasificación Integrada de Revistas Científicas (CIRC), Universidad de Granada; CLASE, Universidad Autónoma de México; DIALNET, Universidad de La Rioja; Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI), Web of Science (WOS), Thomson Reuters/Clarivate Analytics; ETANA - Electronic Tools and Ancient Near East Archives; Fuente Académica Premier, EBSCO; European Reference Index for the Humanities and Social Sciences (ERIH PLUS), Norwegian Centre for Research Data; Index Copernicus International (ICI World of Journals); LATINDEX (catálogo); LatinREV, FLACSO Argentina; Matriz de Información para el Análisis de Revistas (MIAR); Old Testament Abstracts (OTA), Atla - Catholic Biblical Association; Online Egyptological Bibliography (OEB), Griffith Institute, University of Oxford; RAMBI, Jewish National and University Library; SCImago Journal & Country Rank, Elsevier; Scopus, Elsevier; The Serials Directory, EBSCO; Ulrich’s; Núcleo Básico de Publicaciones Periódicas Científicas y Tecnológicas Argentinas, CONICET.\n\nAbout the Acta\n\nThe Society's journal has been published, generally at two-year intervals, since 1958. The papers included have mostly (but not exclusively) been those presented at the corresponding congresses. It has grown from 37 pages in A5 format for the first volume, to 619 pages of A4 size in 2020; its scope includes all types of ceramic material (excluding building material) attributable to the Roman period or immediately before, and all parts of the world where Roman pottery has been found. It thus constitutes an important resource for this field of study.\n\nFor author guidelines and details of how to submit a paper, see the associated page Submissions. Accepted languages are English, French, German, Italian and Spanish. Papers are peer-reviewed prior to acceptance.\n\nThe journal is now published simultaneously in print and in digital form. Earlier volumes are also in the process of being digitized.\n\nAbout Fautores\n\nThe RCRF is an international learned society specialising in the field of Roman pottery. Its main aim is to establish contact between scholars of different countries and the field of interest is interpreted in its widest sense. The Society was jointly founded in 1957 by Howard Comfort (1904-1993) and Elisabeth Ettlinger (1915-2012), and now has over two hundred and fifty individual members in some twenty-five different countries. Libraries and institutions may also become affiliated members, and there are currently nearly one hundred of these who receive our publications and notice of our activities. Congresses are held every two years, in different countries and at the invitation of members who offer to host them. It is not, however, necessary to become a member of the RCRF in order to participate. Papers are generally presented in English, French, German, Italian and Spanish and may be published (subject to peer review) in the Acta."
