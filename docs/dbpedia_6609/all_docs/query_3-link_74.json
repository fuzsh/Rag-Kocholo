        "text": "The archaeologists of the movies live a life of constant action and imminent danger in their quest to uncover ancient archaeological relics. They must solve riddles, decipher ancient texts, dodge deadly snares, and outwit their rivals who are trying to ambush them and steal their treasure. Do the archaeologists portrayed in the movies really reflect the lives of real-life archaeologists? In this unit, you will be introduced to the world of archaeology. We will discuss the science of archaeology, its history, and its relevance in our world today. You will learn about the many aspects of an archaeologist’s job, from the mundane tasks to the thrilling discoveries.\n\nWhat will you learn in this unit?\n\nDiscuss archaeology as a field of study.\n\nDifferentiate between science and pseudoscience.\n\nDescribe the relationship between archaeology and anthropology.\n\nDiscuss the history and development of the field of archaeology.\n\nUnderstand why archaeology is still relevant today.\n\nAnalyze the many aspects of an archaeologist’s work.\n\nDiscuss the career options of an archaeologist.\n\nArchaeologists interpret our past and help shape our future, but exactly how do archaeologists gather and record information? In this unit, you will learn how archaeologists record the past and reconstruct ancient lifeways. We will discuss how archaeologists conduct field research, excavate sites, and date artifacts.\n\nWhat will you learn in this unit?\n\nList and understand the goals of archaeology.\n\nDiscuss what culture is and how archaeologists reconstruct ancient lifeways.\n\nDescribe how the archaeological record is used to date artifacts.\n\nDiscuss the process of archaeological research.\n\nUnderstand how preservation conditions affect the characteristics of a site.\n\nWhile each excavation site is unique, archaeologists everywhere follow a standard procedure to unearth the artifacts hidden beneath the surface. These artifacts help us better understand the time period they were used in and the people who used them. In this unit, you will learn how archaeologists work as a team to dig up these artifacts and how they classify them. We will also take a look at the most exciting archaeological finds in history and how they have shaped our view of the cultures who left them behind.\n\nWhat will you learn in this unit?\n\nDiscuss what each member of an archaeological team is responsible for.\n\nDescribe the obstacles archaeologists commonly face during an excavation.\n\nUnderstand the similarities and differences between a land excavation and an underwater excavation.\n\nDescribe the characteristics of the five major time periods in which artifacts are classified: Paleolithic,\n\nMesolithic, Neolithic, Bronze Age, and Iron Age.\n\nDiscuss the most significant archaeological discoveries of the past five hundred years.\n\nArchaeologists seek to understand where humankind began and how it has evolved and expanded over the ages. Factors such as farming, changes in technology, and written language made the first civilizations possible. In this unit, you will learn where civilization started and explore how humankind has evolved as a result of civilization. You will also learn how human language emerged over time to make civilization possible.\n\nWhat will you learn in this unit?\n\nLearn where the first people and culture originated.\n\nDiscuss the societal importance of sustenance.\n\nExamine early laws.\n\nInvestigate how trade routes encouraged expansion.\n\nExplore how language may have emerged over time.\n\nArchaeologists use the fossil record to date artifacts and sites. The fossil record refers to the preserved remains of plants, animals, and humans, which provide us with a history of life. It is not a complete record; rather, there are holes and unexplained oddities found within it. In this unit, you will learn how archaeologists use the fossil record to record and reconstruct human behavior. You will explore its importance as well as investigate its limitations.\n\nWhat will you learn in this unit?\n\nUnderstand what the fossil record is.\n\nDiscuss where the fossil record begins.\n\nDiscuss the holes in the fossil record.\n\nDescribe oddities found within the fossil record.\n\nUnderstand how archaeologists use the fossil record to reconstruct human behavior.\n\nArchaeologists seek to piece together and understand the social organization of the societies they study. While there are commonalities to all societies, each has many unique attributes as well. In this unit you will investigate the structure of ancient societies by taking a look at their political, social, and economic structure.\n\nWhat will you learn in this unit?\n\nDiscuss the four political classifications of societies.\n\nShow how settlement patterns help archaeologists draw conclusions about a society.\n\nDescribe how social ranking emerged in ancient societies.\n\nDescribe how burial practices differed based on societal status.\n\nDiscuss how economic structures were defined in ancient societies.\n\nScrolls, codices, ostraca, annals, defixiones, and maps are all examples of ancient text. These written records are priceless clues which provide archaeologists with details about ancient life that could never be extracted from material evidence alone. In this unit, you will investigate the most important ancient texts to have been discovered. You will learn how they have helped piece together the details missing from material evidence.\n\nWhat will you learn in this unit?\n\nDiscuss how the alphabet has evolved through the centuries and its significance.\n\nDiscuss how maps are used to learn more about the societies they were created by.\n\nUnderstand how ancient text help archaeologists learn more about a society.\n\nDescribe the different materials used to record text.\n\nDiscuss important texts found by archaeologists.\n\nArchaeologists are the public relations agents of the past. Public archaeology includes all the elements of archaeology that are of importance to modern society, including education, archaeo-tourism, and media representation. Archaeologists manage the resources of a site and work to protect what they uncover. We will also discuss how they share what they have found with the public.\n\nWhat will you learn in this unit?\n\nUnderstand the role of cultural resource management (CRM).\n\nDiscuss how historic sites are preserved and restored in order to educate the public.\n\nDiscuss the legal and ethical issues that guide the field of archaeology.\n\nDescribe the effects of looting and the public measures archaeologists employ to discourage it.\n\nRelate the methods archaeologists use to share their findings with the public."
