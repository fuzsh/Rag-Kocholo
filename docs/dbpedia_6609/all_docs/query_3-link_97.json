        "text": "Contribution starting at $2,750\n\nExported from Streamline App (https://app.streamlineicons.com)\n\n7+ days (avg. $393 a day) Includes accommodations, food, and all related research costs\n\nBOOK WITH A $500 DEPOSIT\n\nArchaeology\n\nUnearthing Ancient History in Tuscany\n\nLocation\n\nPopulonia Archaeological Park, Piombino, Tuscany, Italy Map it\n\nLead Scientist\n\nActivity Level\n\nModerate\n\nAccommodations\n\nHotel/Resort/Lodge\n\nFood\n\nDinner at local restaurants\n\n.\n\nLearn About Teen Teams\n\nThe goal of this expedition is simple: to help experts reconstruct the complex past of Populonia as fully as possible.\n\nFor hundreds of years, Populonia dominated the ironworks industry in the Mediterranean. The city's transfer from Etruscan to Roman rule around 250 B.C. did not halt its metalworking activities; iron exports supported the Roman expansion in Africa, so the ruling class had important economic interests in the area’s industrial production and commerce.\n\nTo reconstruct the economic and social history of the city of Populonia, researchers must answer many complicated questions: When and where did iron smelting occur? How did metalworking and trade shape the society of the city? Who were the ancient people who lived and worked in the harbor, the mines, and the iron smelting industry?\n\nBy joining this expedition, you’ll help fill in gaps in knowledge about the Populonia area. Your team will excavate the Roman settlement of Poggio del Molino.\n\nLive the life of a professional archaeologist as you unearth artifacts, then clean and study them. You might also try rebuilding original objects from the fragments you’ve discovered. You’ll have an unparalleled chance to get close to Italy’s ancient past.\n\n.\n\nA Typical Itinerary\n\nDAY 1: Arrival, travel to accommodations, welcome presentation\n\nDAYS 2–6: Excavations, catalog artifacts, map excavation sites\n\nDAY 7: Departure\n\nYou also have the option of joining the expedition for two weeks.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nHOW WILL YOU HELP\n\nMost days will begin with a morning briefing, and then you’ll head out to the excavation site, where you will:\n\n.\n\nExcavate artifacts\n\nYou'll spend most of your time removing the earth around objects with trowels, brushes, and other tools.\n\nMap excavation sites\n\nTo help record the layout, excavations, and where objects have been uncovered, you will help draw features of the site.\n\nRecord, analyze, and preserve artifacts\n\nHelp clean and catalog the finds you uncover and analyze the source and age of stones used as building materials. When you find bits of pottery, you'll try to reconstruct the original vessel. You'll also draw and do some basic conservation of building decorations, such as mosaics.\n\nField conditions and research needs can change the itinerary and activities. We appreciate your cooperation and understanding.\n\n.\n\nFEEDBACK & QUESTIONS\n\n7 Reviews on this Expedition\n\nIf you have been on this expedition, others considering attending would love to hear about your experience.\n\nDawn Hibbard |\n\nMy husband and I joined the Tuscany archaeological expedition looking for an adventure outside of our normal experiences. It did not disappoint. The daily activities were engaging, the archaeologists that we worked with were patient with the volunteers, guiding us, explaining everything clearly, and articulating its relevance to what they were researching. A pleasant surprise was that there were six other people very much like us, interested in the topic, curious about the world, and passionate about learning new things. The archaeological team went out of their way to make the experience special, including helping us book after hours excursions, and sharing with us the long-term impact of their work.\n\nPaul Stout |\n\nEverything about this project was fantastic - our team was able to be engaged in every aspect of an archeological dig, including unearthing buried strata, documenting finds, cleaning and attempting to assemble artifacts, and assisting in preserving ancient mosaics and frescoes. And what a site - intriguing evolution through early to mid-Roman occupation, transitioning from a fort policing and protecting the rich iron ore processing of the region to a farm adapted to produce the much-prized garum for the fuddy-duddies of Rome, to a nobleman's villa complete with baths, massage rooms, and an extensive garden. And every footstep echoed the shadows of that procession through time. The field staff were also incredible - knowledgable, patient, positively energetic, and great cooks of our evening meals! They helped make the work fun and helped create a strong bond among the volunteers - and of course some good local wines helped. I can't wait to return next year!\n\nChristina Myrianthous |\n\nWhat a great experience it was to be part of the wonderful team of archeologists at Populonia, Tuscany. I have only the highest praise for these dedicated people that made us all feel so welcome. With absolutely no previous experience in the field, except a 'burning' desire to join a dig, this was a superb way to see if archeology is something for me. We were digging at a Roman villa where we assisted in the restoration of mosaics and frescoes and in cleaning of pottery. The site was closing up for the winter and so the cleaning of finds was needed for the catalogisation and storage. We even got to try to put pottery pieces back together. I thoroughly enjoyed every part of this experience, being outdoors the whole day with physical work, finding (or not finding) pottery pieces and then to clean and piece them together. It was such a fantastic introduction to the whole archeology process which I found very interesting. I can highly recommend everyone who has ever thought about volunteering at a site to go on this trip, you will not regret it! I would also like to take this opportunity to thank Karolina, Giulia, Alessandro, Marco and the rest of the team for taking so good care of us and for being so enthusiastic and willing to share your knowledge with an wannabe archeologist!\n\nSupported stories\n\nBlog Post\n\nCommunity Fellows Investigate Climate Change in The Mackenzie Mountains\n\nSince 2003, Earthwatch has partnered with the Alcoa Foundation to engage employees in scientific research and environmental learning…\n\nRead More\n\nBlog Post\n\nArchaeology: It Isn’t Just About The Digging\n\nThis summer, Heather Motta traveled from her home in Los Angeles to Crow Canyon, Colorado to work alongside archeologists uncovering ancestral Pueblo great houses…\n\nRead More\n\nBlog Post\n\nWhen I Was 17, My Life Changed.\n\nAt age 17, Taormina Lepore boarded a plane for the very first time on her way to an archaeological excavation as an Earthwatch student fellow, funded by the Durfee Foundation.\n\nRead More"
