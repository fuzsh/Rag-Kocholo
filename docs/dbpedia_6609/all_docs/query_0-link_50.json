It concerns the analysis of human osteological remains of archaeological interest. Bioarchaeology is an integrative, holistic field that combines different theories, methods, and studies to offer a comprehensive interpretative framework of archaeological contexts. Interdisciplinary aspects are aimed at improving data upon biological findings in the archaeological record. The JBR addresses bioarchaeological methods from field studies, laboratory analyses, to data interpretation.\n\nAims and Scope\n\nThe aim of the JBR is to provide a platform for the publication of scientific papers concerning all the aspects related to bioarchaeology. The journal publishes worldwide original articles, case reports, short communications, and letters to the editor.
