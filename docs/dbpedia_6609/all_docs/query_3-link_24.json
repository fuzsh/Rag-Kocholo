        "text": "Preliminary Fieldwork\n\nThe first stage of collecting archaeological data is called preliminary fieldwork. Preliminary fieldwork involves the discovery and recording of sites and their initial examination. Many sites have been found by pure luck. The famous 20,000-year-old wall paintings in Lascaux, France, for example, were discovered by boys who climbed into a hole to find their missing dog. Some sites have been uncovered in the course of preparation for construction projects or as the result of bombing. Today, however, most sites are located by careful and well-planned survey programs.\n\nThe exact methods of finding archaeological sites vary, primarily because there are so many different types of sites. Some sites—such as mounds, temples, forts, roads, and ancient cities—may be easily visible on the surface of the ground. Such sites may be located by an individual or group going over the ground on foot, in a vehicle, or on a horse, mule, or camel. This kind of survey can be comprehensive—that is, the entire area may be covered—or it can involve the technique of sampling. In sampling, a limited number of strategic spots in the region are checked for signs of an underlying archaeological site.\n\nTo find sites that have no surface traces, archaeologists may use aerial photographs taken from airplanes, drones, or satellites. The archaeologist checks these photographs for clues—such as variations in soil color, ground contour, or crop density—that may indicate the existence of a site.\n\nArchaeologists may simply probe the ground with sound. This method checks for variations in the reflection of sound that would indicate the presence of structures or hollows in the ground. A probe, or periscope, may be inserted into the ground to locate walls and ditches. Archaeologist Carlo Lerici used such a probe to locate and photograph Etruscan tombs in Italy in 1957.\n\nOther modern devices use electricity and magnetism to locate buried structures. Instruments called magnetometers or even mine detectors may be used to force currents through the earth. The currents record any unusual features, such as a large, solid object, that lie beneath the soil. Similar magnetometers are dragged through water to locate sunken ships or structures. In the 20th century the American archaeologist George Bass and the French ocean explorer Jacques Cousteau both had considerable success using this technique. In the early 21st century more advanced, handheld magnetometers helped researchers find items from the wreckage of the English pirate Blackbeard’s flagship, Queen Anne’s Revenge (see below).\n\nBefore 1860\n\nThe interests and objectives of the first archaeologists are the most difficult to define. Many of them may have acted more out of curiosity than for any well-defined, scholarly goal. In Europe a landmark event in early archaeology was the removal of ancient Greek sculptures, now known as the Elgin Marbles, from their site in Athens, Greece. Scottish diplomat and art collector Thomas Bruce, 7th earl of Elgin, took them from the Parthenon and other ancient buildings and brought them to England in the early 1800s. This acquisition aroused violent controversy, and Bruce was widely denounced as a vandal.\n\nBy 1812 a national museum of archaeology had been established in Denmark. By 1818 its curator, Christian J. Thomsen, had developed the three-part chronological system that divides human prehistory in Europe into the Stone, Bronze, and Iron ages. Thomsen was assisted by Jens Worsaae, whose subsequent discovery of ancient human remains established the Paleolithic (Old Stone Age) as a period of prehistory.\n\nIn 1837 French archaeologist Jacques Boucher de Crèvecoeur de Perthes discovered Stone Age tools and other remains in France. He was the first to draw scientific attention to evidence that humankind had lived on Earth much earlier than had been previously thought.\n\nEnglish archaeologist Austen Henry Layard was responsible for two milestones in early archaeology. During the 1840s he excavated two important sites—Calah and Nineveh—in what is now Iraq. Calah (modern Nimrud) was the capital of Assyria under King Ashurnasirpal II. Nineveh was the oldest and most populous city of the ancient Assyrian empire and its capital for hundreds of years. At both sites Layard discovered the remains of palaces, including the palace of the Assyrian king Sennacherib. He also found a large number of significant artworks. Perhaps most important, however, was his discovery of many clay tablets with cuneiform, a kind of writing. Scholars and scientists have learned much about Assyrian and Babylonian culture and history from these tablets.\n\nOther archaeological milestones occurred during the first half of the 1800s. French scholar Jean-François Champollion translated the Rosetta Stone. It is an ancient Egyptian stone slab with inscriptions in several languages and scripts, including hieroglyphics. This translation provided the key to deciphering the writings of ancient Egypt. Henry Rawlinson, a British army officer, translated the cuneiform inscriptions on the Bisitun rock. The inscriptions, carved into the rock face of the Zagros Mountains in Iran, celebrated the ascent of Darius I to the Persian throne in 522 bc. Rawlinson’s work helped in the deciphering of other writings of ancient Mesopotamia.\n\nIn the Americas the father of American archaeology was Thomas Jefferson. He excavated burial mounds in Virginia in the late 1700s to determine if the mound builders were Native Americans. American archaeologist and writer John Lloyd Stephens and English artist Frederick Catherwood conducted other early research in the Americas. Their work included the mapping of Maya ruins in Central America and Mexico.\n\n1930–69\n\nThe Great Depression, the worldwide economic downturn, helped to advance archaeology in the 1930s in the United States. As part of his program to employ American citizens, President Franklin D. Roosevelt established the Civilian Conservation Corps and the Works Progress Administration. Professional archaeologists and students worked for both organizations, investigating archaeological sites throughout the United States. Their work helped popularize the field of archaeology among the public.\n\nArchaeologists from various countries continued to explore in the mid-20th century. Benjamin Irving Rouse concentrated his studies in the Caribbean. In South America, Wendell Bennett, Junius Bird, and J.C. Tello established the basic chronologies of ancient cultures in Peru. J.M. Cruxent did similar work in Venezuela. In Mexico and Central America, Alfred Vincent Kidder continued Sylvanus Morley’s investigation of Maya sites on the Yucatán Peninsula and in Honduras and Guatemala. George Vaillant, Paul Tolstoy, and others continued reconstructing chronologies in the Valley of Mexico, which was home to several early civilizations, including the Aztec. In Palenque, Mexico, Alberto Ruz Lhuillier opened the tomb of Maya ruler King Pakal in the Temple of the Inscriptions. Richard MacNeish and Paul Mangelsdorf began their long search for the origins of the farming of corn (maize). Corn was central to the diets of Meso-American cultures.\n\nWorld War II followed close on the heels of the Great Depression. In the Old World, achievements in prehistoric archaeology declined considerably. British archaeologists Grahame Clark and V. Gordon Childe dominated the field of Mesolithic and Neolithic studies. Paleolithic studies flourished worldwide with the work of French archaeologist François Bordes and American archaeologist Hallam Movius, Jr., in Europe. Kenyan archaeologist Louis Leakey and his wife, Mary Douglas Leakey, made several fossil discoveries in Africa that are of great importance to the understanding of human evolution. Canadian anthropologist Davidson Black worked in China. American archaeologist Robert J. Braidwood and British archaeologist Dorothy Annie Elizabeth Garrod concentrated their studies in the Middle East.\n\nDevelopments in classical archaeology continued, though also on a reduced scale. British archaeologists were involved in some of the most notable events. Kathleen Kenyon excavated Jericho to its Stone Age foundations, and Michael Ventris deciphered Mycenaean script. Other finds were simply accidental. A shepherd boy, for example, found the first of the ancient manuscripts known as the Dead Sea Scrolls in a cave along the shores of the Dead Sea in 1947. Archaeologists continued to find pieces of manuscripts in other caves through the 1960s.\n\nMore generally, underwater archaeology—the study of underwater shipwrecks and settlements—began during this period. In addition, various technological improvements aided archaeological efforts. These included satellite photography, radiocarbon dating, and the use of computers and metal detectors to locate sites and to record data.\n\n1970–99\n\nIn the second half of the 20th century, there was an emphasis on theory in archaeology. Of particular interest was the question of why cultures change. Other trends in modern archaeology include an increasing reliance on computers and other technological advances. Universities organized well-planned interdisciplinary programs designed to answer specific archaeological questions.\n\nIn the United States the government began to strengthen the laws pertaining to archaeology. The Archaeological Resources Protection Act (ARPA) of 1979, for example, was enacted to protect archaeological sites from being looted. The act defined criminal activities related to archaeological resources on public lands and provided penalties for offenders. It also detailed the requirements for obtaining a permit to begin archaeological investigations in an area.\n\nThe 1970s and ’80s produced some sensational finds worldwide. These include the discovery in Ethiopia of a three-million-year-old skeleton called Lucy. Many scientists regard Lucy as intermediate between ape and human. In 1977 archaeologists discovered the tomb of Philip II of Macedon, father of Alexander the Great, in northern Greece. The tomb was undisturbed and contained numerous artifacts from the time period. Later archaeologists began to excavate and study Nakbe in northern Guatemala. The site is thought to be one of the earliest known ceremonial centers of Maya culture.\n\nMajor finds in the late 1980s included the unearthing in Oklahoma of stone tools thought to have been made by some of the earliest groups of humans to inhabit North America. In Iraq archaeologists discovered one of the world’s oldest known statues, an 11,000-year-old stone. It is 4 feet (1.2 meters) high and covered in plaster to form the shape of a human. In London archaeologists uncovered the remains of the Globe Theatre, where William Shakespeare staged his plays in the late 16th and early 17th centuries.\n\nA mummified body of a man from the late Stone Age was discovered in the Austrian Alps in 1991. The body was so well preserved that it still had its skin, internal organs, and fingernails as well as its clothes, shoes, and weapons. Dubbed the Iceman, or Ötzi, the body is thought to be at least 5,300 years old.\n\nIn 1996 a team of archaeologists announced that they had discovered the ancient birth chamber of the Buddha (Prince Siddhartha Gautama), the founder of Buddhism. The chamber is beneath the Mayadevi (Maya Devi) Temple in southwestern Nepal. The site is located in Lumbini, more than 200 miles (350 kilometers) southwest of the Nepalese capital, Kathmandu. The findings appeared to settle an international debate over whether the Buddha was born in India or Nepal.\n\nIn the late 1990s a team of American and Russian archaeologists announced the findings they recorded during the lengthy excavation of a series of ancient tombs. The tombs, discovered along the westernmost border of Kazakhstan, date back to the 6th century bc. Most surprising among the findings were the contents found within tombs of females. The women had been buried along with swords, daggers, bows, and arrows. Many of the archaeologists preliminarily concluded that at least some of the female members of Sauromatian and Sarmatian nomadic tribes, to which the tombs had been traced, served as warriors. However, later evidence showed that the women had few signs of having been injured by violence, suggesting that they probably were not involved in constant warfare. Instead, they possibly guarded herds or territory.\n\nSeveral finds of the late 20th century are major and well publicized. They include the shipwreck of the Queen Anne’s Revenge, Roman shipwrecks in the Mediterranean Sea, and the Hindu temple Angkor Wat.\n\nQueen Anne’s Revenge\n\nFor more than 270 years, the final resting place of one of history’s most notorious sea vessels remained a mystery. In 1718 Queen Anne’s Revenge ran aground and then sank off the Atlantic coast of the American colonies. Queen Anne’s Revenge had been the fleet flagship of the infamous pirate Blackbeard (Edward Teach). Blackbeard escaped from the sinking vessel along with his crew. Legend has it that they were able to save the vast treasures that they had accumulated while plundering ships and towns along the Eastern seaboard.\n\nThe whereabouts of the ship—and the rumored treasure—had remained unknown. In the 1990s marine archaeologists working off the coast of North Carolina discovered what they thought to be the sunken remains of Queen Anne’s Revenge. The hull of the ship apparently settled near where it was reported to have sunk, in water about 20 feet (6 meters) deep and less than 2 miles (3.2 kilometers) from the coast. The location of the ship had remained undetermined mostly because of the hundreds of other ships at the bottom of the ocean in that area. The team of marine archaeologists, however, consulted a rare book from 1719 that chronicled the story of the sinking of Blackbeard’s notorious ship. The book provided an exact description of the location where the ship went down. Marine archaeologists were able to locate what they assumed was the Queen Anne’s Revenge, using that information and a device designed to detect large amounts of metal. This device made it possible for the archaeologists to detect the ship’s numerous cannons.\n\nAfter a team of divers salvaged several artifacts from the hull, including the bell of the ship, they were able to conclude that the ship in question was most likely Blackbeard’s legendary vessel. (The bell had been inscribed with the date 1705, dating the ship to the correct time period.) In the following decades archaeologists recovered thousands of artifacts from the site. These items include navigational devices, cannons, and a sword hilt. In 2011 authorities officially confirmed that the wreck was Queen Anne’s Revenge.\n\nDeep-Sea Roman Treasure Found\n\nIn 1985 American oceanographer Robert Ballard located the remains of the ocean liner Titanic. It had sunk in the North Sea in 1912. In 1989 Ballard led a research team in the first deep-sea probe of the Mediterranean Sea. The team, searching off the eastern coast of the island of Sicily, discovered the remnants of a Roman vessel from the 4th century ad. In the hull of the ship the researchers found amphorae—clay containers used to ship and store goods—and other trading items.\n\nIn 1997 Ballard and his team returned to the Mediterranean Sea. They used a sophisticated U.S. Navy nuclear submarine for further exploration. The marine archaeologists located five ships in the depths of the Mediterranean that had sunk over a period of 2,000 years. Three of the wrecks are relatively modern. One, thought to be a relic of the Ottoman Empire, dates back to the 18th or 19th century. Two more ships, thought to be of European origin, also date back to the 19th century, the archaeologists estimated. Two other ships discovered at the bottom of the sea, however, are thought to have originated in the classical world. One of the ships was a Roman shipping vessel that sank in the rough waters in the beginning of the 1st century bc. The other ship, also a Roman shipping vessel, dates to the 1st century ad.\n\nThe two Roman ships were each roughly 100 feet (30 meters) long. Both of the vessels had undergone significant decomposition during their many centuries under the sea. However, the sections of the ships that were embedded in the ocean floor remain well preserved. The hulls of both ships remained largely intact, and both were filled with a wealth of objects. Using the robotic deep-sea probe, archaeologists recovered more than 100 items from the two ships. The oldest ship contained glass artifacts similar to kitchenware as well as numerous amphorae that once carried perishable goods such as wine and oil to foreign lands. Contained in the hull of the second ship were slabs of granite and pieces of columns, apparently bound for the Roman Empire or neighboring lands.\n\nAncient Ruins Discovered in Cambodian Jungle\n\nA team of archaeologists announced in 1998 that they had discovered a series of previously unknown temples and a human-made mound in the jungle of northwestern Cambodia. The temples are part of the ancient Khmer civilization. The temples predate by as much as 300 years the nearby temple of Angkor Wat. Angkor Wat is a well-known Hindu temple that the Khmer people constructed in the middle of the 12th century.\n\nThe newfound archaeological structures were first detected during a space shuttle mission conducted by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) in 1994. In December 1996 NASA members worked in coordination with archaeologist and Khmer civilization expert Elizabeth Moore of the University of London. They surveyed the densely vegetated region using advanced microwave radar imaging. The radar images produced enough evidence to suggest that some sort of hand-built structure existed deep beneath the thick foliage.\n\nIn December 1997 Moore led a team of archaeologists through the Cambodian jungle in search of the structures depicted in the radar surveys. The archaeologists eventually discovered the remains of six additional temples in the area near Angkor Wat, as well as a mound that was built as early as the 6th century bc. The newly discovered ruins were estimated to have been built at some point in the late 9th or early 10th century.\n\nThe discovery of the new temples profoundly changed archaeological conceptions of the Khmer civilization and the ancient Khmer city of Angkor. At the height of its power, the city of Angkor was thought to have spanned some 100 square miles (260 square kilometers). As many as 1,000,000 people probably inhabited the city. More than 1,000 temples are thought to have been built in Angkor. In the 15th century the city was mysteriously abandoned. The jungles slowly encroached on the ancient city, burying the ruins beneath a thick carpet of vegetation.\n\nWestern scholars first became familiar with the ancient city of Angkor during the middle of the 19th century. At that time, France claimed the country—then known as Indochina—as a colony. About the beginning of the 20th century, French archaeologists began excavating the massive temple of Angkor Wat. Archaeological accounts of the early excavation recorded only one other temple near Angkor Wat, and no structures were known to have existed from before the 12th century. Moore stated that the discovery of the six temple ruins, as well as the human-made mound, indicated that the region was probably regularly inhabited for much of the 1,000 years preceding the construction of Angkor Wat.\n\n21st-Century Discoveries\n\nArchaeologists, professional treasure seekers, and amateurs continued to search for and find historical artifacts into the 21st century. In 2009 an amateur explorer with a metal detector found some gold pieces in a field in Staffordshire, England. Archaeologists investigated, and the site turned out to hold the largest collection of gold ever found. Archaeologists attributed the gold to the Anglo-Saxon people and dated it to the 7th century. Among the thousands of items were coins, weapons, and Christian crosses.\n\nIn 2015 marine archaeologists uncovered the wreck of the Spanish galleon San José. The British had sunk the ship in 1708 off the coast of Cartagena, Colombia. The San José was filled with gold, silver, and jewels. A group of explorers supposedly found the ship in 1981. However, disagreements between the Colombian government and the American-backed search company led to several legal disputes. These disputes halted all investigations. Years later researchers from Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts joined other explorers on a Colombian ship and relocated the San José. Recovery of artifacts was postponed as the governments of Spain and Colombia, as well as private parties, fought over control of the treasure.\n\nIn 2019 researchers dated a cave painting on the island of Celebes (Sulawesi) in Indonesia to some 45,000 years ago. The painting is possibly the oldest to tell a real-life hunting story. It depicts small human figures with animal features hunting a large wild boar. The previous year scientists revealed that they had found the oldest known rock painting in a cave on the southern coast of South Africa. The painting is abstract, showing crossed lines (resembling the modern number, or hash, symbol) in a red pigment. Some scientists, however, argue that the so-called painting is a marking rather than art. It is dated to 73,000 years ago.\n\nBy the early 21st century the loss of data at archaeological sites had become one of the most pressing challenges in modern archaeology. Causes of the loss range from humans looting to extreme weather that destroys the sites. With the cooperation of governmental authorities, archaeologists hope to find a way of stopping such destruction and of preserving the traces of humankind’s ancient history."
