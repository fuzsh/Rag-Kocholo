It has been published as an annual for more than half a century. A rich variety of subjects, which are showing current research possibilities and new trends in archeology, characterizes published texts. Articles dedicated to issues of link between archeology and other disciplines (mainly: history, history of science and technology, architecture, art history) are often inserted. Chronological frameworks embrace a wide time range from the Stone Age to the present day."
