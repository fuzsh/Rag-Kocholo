        "text": "The American Journal of Archaeology (AJA), the journal of the Archaeological Institute of America (AIA), is one of the oldest and most widely circulated journals of archaeology in the world. Founded in 1885 as The American Journal of Archaeology and of the History of the Fine Arts, it began its second series in 1897.\n\nThe Governing Board of the AIA, on 1 May 2021, approved the following expanded statement of purpose for the AJA, with an expansion of the temporal scope approved on 7 May 2022:\n\nThe AJA publishes original research on the diverse peoples and material cultures of the Mediterranean and related areas, including North Africa (with Egypt and Sudan), Western Asia (with the Caucasus), and Europe, from prehistory through late antiquity and beyond.\n\nManuscripts that address the history of the discipline, archaeological methodologies, theoretical approaches, pedagogy, and the politics and ethics of archaeological heritage are welcome. The AJA encourages submissions that are broadly relevant to scholars of the ancient Mediterranean, including those that explore the intersections of Mediterranean cultures with other regions and periods, the reception of these cultures in later times, and their ongoing significance in the present.\n\nIn accordance with the AIA’s Statement on Archaeology and Social Justice, the AJA is committed to advancing equity and inclusion in archaeological publication. The journal seeks to publish diverse viewpoints, especially from members of historically underrepresented groups, to acknowledge and examine the appropriation of Mediterranean archaeology by racist, nationalist, and colonialist ideologies, and to address critically the biases that have shaped the discipline.\n\nThe AJA affirms the critical importance of archaeological context and the responsibility to provide documentation of provenance in archaeological publication. Submissions should follow the AJA’s policies regarding the citation of excavated objects and objects in public and private collections.\n\nThe AJA Editors-in-Chief welcome the submission of manuscripts on any subject within that definition. Submissions that announce discoveries, present new information, or break new theoretical ground are especially welcome, as are articles that deal with methodological issues, offer theoretical frameworks for interpretation of archaeological data, or explore the symbiosis between field methodology and the analysis of material culture. In addition to articles, the AJA publishes field reports and newsletters on the archaeology of various regions, comprehensive reviews of the state of the discipline, forums, archaeological notes, necrologies, museum exhibition reviews, book reviews, and review articles (see the editorial statements of the Book Review Editor and Museum Review Editor in AJA 121 [2017] 3–4 and in AJA 122 [2018] 3–4; see also Guidelines for Book Reviewers and Guidelines for Museum Reviewers). Awards presented at each annual meeting of the AIA are no longer published in the April issue, effective 2016. They are available on the AIA website. Pre-2016 published AIA awards are available on AJA Open Access.\n\nAll submissions should follow the AJA Policy on the Publication and Citation of Unprovenanced Antiquities.\n\nSubmissions considered for publication in the AJA are reviewed by appropriate experts without exception. While AJA Editorial Advisory Board members often serve as reviewers, manuscripts are also screened by outside experts. Most submissions are read by three scholars in addition to the Editors-in-Chief.\n\nOn 4 January 2020, the Archaeological Institute of America revised its policy on the presentation and publication of undocumented antiquities (www.archaeological.org/about/governance/policies: “AIA Policy on the Presentation and Publication of Undocumented Antiquities”). The following explains, first, the details of the AIA policy and, second, the policy of the AJA regarding the citation of objects in private and public collections.\n\nAIA Policy on the Presentation and Publication of Undocumented Antiquities\n\nThe AIA policy states:\n\n“The publication and presentation venues of the Archaeological Institute of America will not serve for the initial scholarly publication or announcement of any object in a private or public collection acquired after December 30, 1973, unless its existence is documented before that date, or it was legally exported from the country of origin. An exception may be made if, in the view of the Editor or Program Committee, the aim of publication is to emphasize the loss of archaeological context or acquisition history.”\n\nAccording to this policy, an object in a private or public collection may appear in a publication or presentation venue of the AIA if (a) the object was acquired by the collection before 30 December 1973, or (b) the existence of the object is documented before that date, or (c) the object was legally exported from the country of origin, or (d) the object has previously received appropriate initial scholarly publication or announcement, or (e) it was legally excavated. The revised policy of the AIA defines the kind of vehicle or venue in which an appropriate initial scholarly publication or announcement must appear and specifies what information the initial publication or announcement must include.\n\nAccording to the revised AIA policy, the vehicle or venue of the initial scholarly publication or announcement of an object in a private or public collection must be one of the following:\n\nA peer-reviewed or similarly vetted publication in a scholarly book or journal, either in print or online.\n\nThe permanent and accessible record (e.g., published abstract or conference proceeding) of a peer-reviewed or similarly vetted presentation (either a paper delivered orally or a poster) at a meeting of a learned society.\n\nA peer-reviewed or similarly vetted publication in a scholarly catalogue, either in print or online. “Scholarly catalogue” in this context refers to a catalogue of accessioned objects produced by an academically affiliated or educationally oriented organization (e.g., a museum catalogue) and not to a catalogue produced by a for-profit and/or commercial organization (e.g., an auction house catalogue).\n\nThe initial scholarly publication or announcement of an object in a private or public collection must include (1) an illustration (e.g., a photograph, a drawing, or a similar graphic), (2) commentary specific to the object (such as its dimensions and a description that includes, as applicable, material(s), details of ware, decoration, production technology, etc.). Initial scholarly publication or announcement of epigraphic material should also include (3) a transcription, and (4) if appropriate, a translation.\n\nAn object in a private or public collection that was acquired after 30 December 1973, that is not documented before that date, or that was not legally exported from the country of origin is considered unprovenanced. Such an unprovenanced object, if it has received prior initial scholarly publication or announcement, may be mentioned in a publication or presentation venue of the AIA. However, each mention of such an unprovenanced object must include the designation “[unprov.],” and the first mention of an unprovenanced object must be accompanied by a reference to the initial scholarly publication or announcement and by the following statement: “This object was acquired after 30 December 1973; there is no evidence of its documentation before that date or its legal export from the country of origin.”\n\nCitation in the AJA of Objects in Private and Public Collections\n\nAn object in a private or public collection may be mentioned, cited, discussed, and illustrated in the AJA if (a) it was acquired by the collection before 30 December 1973, (b) its existence is documented before 30 December 1973, (c) it was legally exported from the country of origin, (d) it has previously received appropriate initial scholarly publication or announcement, or (e) it was legally excavated.\n\nAn object may not be mentioned, cited, discussed, or illustrated in the AJA if it was acquired by a private or public collection after 30 December 1973 and its existence is not documented before that date, or it was not legally exported from the country of origin, or it has not previously received appropriate initial scholarly publication or announcement. An exception may be made if, in the view of the AJA’s Editor-in-Chief, the aim of publication is to emphasize the loss of archaeological context or acquisition history.\n\nHow to cite an object in a private or public collection\n\nA chart summarizing if and how an object in a public or private collection may appear in the AJA is reproduced below and may be separately downloaded here.\n\nThe citation of any object in a private or public collection must include the basic identification of the object and additional information as required by the documentation of the object.\n\nThe basic identification consists of the city in which the collection is located, the name of the institution or collection, the accession or inventory number, and the year in which the object was acquired by the collection. (The acquisition date should be stated separately even when a museum accession number includes the year in which an object was acquired.) If the year in which the object was acquired is unknown or not available, the citation should include “acq. date n/a.”\n\nThe following abbreviations appear at the end of the table of contents of each print issue and can be used when giving information about the object:\n\nacq. = acquired\n\nacq. date = acquisition date\n\nexcav. = excavated\n\nn/a = not available\n\n[unprov.] = acquired after 30 December 1973 and not documented before that date\n\nqual. pub. = initial scholarly publication, meeting requirements as defined above by the AIA and the AJA\n\ndoc. = documentation of the object’s existence before 30 December 1973\n\nThe following examples illustrate the types of citation needed depending on the date of acquisition, prior documentation, evidence of legal exportation, and previous initial scholarly publication or announcement.\n\nThe object was acquired before 30 December 1973. The first mention of the object should be accompanied by a footnote with the basic identification of the object.\n\nFootnote: City, Museum of Ancient Art 1965-632, acq. 1965.\n\nThe object was acquired after 30 December 1973, but its existence is documented before that date. The first mention of the object should be accompanied by a footnote with the basic identification and the citation of the documentation of the object’s existence before 30 December 1973. The citation of the documentation should follow the standard AJA format for references (see www.ajaonline.org/submissions/references). If the documentation meets the standards listed above for initial scholarly publication, use “qual. pub.” before the citation; for all others, use “doc.”\n\nFootnote: City, Museum of Ancient Art 1984-632, acq. 1984; qual. pub. Smith 1955.\n\nWorks cited: Smith, J. 1955. “An Object in a Private Collection of Antiquities.” Journal of Ancient Art 26:19–31.\n\nThe acquisition date of an object in a private or public collection is not available, but the existence of the object is documented before 30 December 1973. The first mention of the object should be accompanied by a footnote with the basic identification and the citation of the documentation of the object’s existence before 30 December 1973. If the documentation meets the standards listed above for initial scholarly publication, use “qual. pub.” before the citation; for all others, use “doc.”\n\nFootnote: City, Museum of Ancient Art GR-632, acq. date n/a; qual. pub. Smith 1955.\n\nWorks cited: Smith, J. 1955. “An Object in a Private Collection of Antiquities.” Journal of Ancient Art 26:19–31.\n\nThe object was acquired after 30 December 1973, but the object was legally exported from the country of origin. The first mention of the object should be accompanied by a footnote with the basic identification and the citation of the evidence for the object’s legal exportation.\n\nFootnote: City, Museum of Ancient Art GR-632, acq. 1985; legally exported from Greece on 15 February 1985 (Permit for Export of an Antiquity #84723).\n\nThe object was acquired after 30 December 1973 (or the acquisition date is not available), and there is no documentation of the object before that date or evidence that the object was legally exported from the country of origin. However, the object has received initial scholarly publication or announcement (as defined by the AIA) after 30 December 1973. In this case, the object is considered unprovenanced. The first mention of the object should be accompanied by a footnote with the basic identification followed by the designation “[unprov.],” the statement of no provenance (“This object was acquired after 30 December 1973; there is no evidence of its documentation before that date or its legal export from the country of origin\"), and the citation of the initial scholarly publication or announcement of the object. If the object also appears in the Association of Art Museum Directors (AAMD) Registry of New Acquisitions of Archaeological Material and Works of Ancient Art, the reference should include a link to the relevant entry. In subsequent discussions of the object in the text or notes, the object should consistently be accompanied by the designation “[unprov.].”\n\nFootnote: City, Museum of Ancient Art GR-632, acq. 1985 [unprov.]. This object was acquired after 30 December 1973; there is no evidence of its documentation before that date or its legal export from the country of origin. Qual. pub. Smith 1988. https://aamd.org/object-registry/new-acquisitions-of-archaeological-mate....\n\nOr: City, Museum of Ancient Art GR-632, acq. date n/a [unprov.]. This object may have been acquired after 30 December 1973; there is no evidence of its documentation before that date or its legal export from the country of origin. Qual. pub. Smith 1988. https://aamd.org/object-registry/new-acquisitions-of-archaeological-mate....\n\nWorks cited: Smith, J. 1988. “An Object in the Museum of Ancient Art.” Journal of Ancient Art 59:19–31.\n\nSome objects will not correspond to any of the examples above. For instance, objects scientifically and legally excavated may as a matter of course become the property of a museum in the country of origin. Such legally excavated objects that are acquired after 30 December 1973 by a museum in the country of origin do, of course, have a provenance and may be mentioned, cited, discussed, and illustrated in the AJA. The first mention of such an object should be accompanied by a footnote with the basic identification and the documentation of its excavation.\n\nFootnote: City, Archaeological Museum of Ancient Art 2012-632, acq. 2012; excav. 2011, Project or Excavating Authority Name, Site Name (if unclear from project/authority name); qual. pub. Smith 2015, 498.\n\nWorks cited: Smith, J. 2015. “Excavations at Site Name.” Journal of Archaeology 119:482–512.\n\nSome legally excavated objects remain in the storage facilities or collections of the project or excavating authority; these objects have a provenance and may be mentioned, cited, discussed, and illustrated in the AJA. The first mention of such an object should be accompanied by a footnote with the basic identification and the documentation of its excavation.\n\nFootnote: Ancient City Archaeological Project 2011.108, excav. 2011, qual. pub. Smith 2015, 498.\n\nWorks cited: Smith, J. 2015. “Excavations at Site Name.” Journal of Archaeology 119:482–512.\n\nFor objects not covered by the examples above, authors should consult with the editorial staff of the AJA.\n\nUpdated: 3 May 2021\n\nEditorial Policy\n\nMuseum exhibitions make important contributions to archaeological scholarship and are one of the most important ways that our field communicates with the wider public. For these reasons, museum exhibitions deserve examination by specialists. The AJA seeks to publish critical reviews of important exhibitions, museum installations, and other public displays of archaeological knowledge in the United States and abroad. Museum reviews are usually published in the printed journal and always appear as open-access content on the AJA website (www.ajaonline.org). Each museum review is part of a quarterly issue of the journal and appears in the table of contents for that issue.\n\nAn AJA museum review should not simply offer a listing of the contents of an exhibition or new gallery installation but should instead assess its strengths and weaknesses and locate the exhibition or installation within current scholarship and museum practice. Reviewers should draw attention to serious problems of selection, interpretation, and errors of fact. It is also helpful for reviewers to indicate the audiences for which the exhibition seems appropriate. Comments are encouraged on the value of the catalogue as a permanent record of an exhibition and as a work of scholarship. Comments are also encouraged on the value of the website or other electronic publications. Additional suggestions about museum reviews can be found in “A Letter from the Editor of the Museum Reviews” (AJA 122.1 [2018]).\n\nMuseum Reviews follow the AJA’s Policy on the Publication and Citation of Unprovenanced Antiquities (AJA 124.2 (2020) 175-7; www.ajaonline.org/submissions/antiquities-policy). When mentioning a specific object, reviewers should follow the same requirements as authors of articles, reports, and notes. In addition, reviewers should state whether or not the exhibition contains objects acquired after 30 December 1973 that lack prior documentation or evidence of legal export from the country of origin. Reviewers should also provide a link to the acquisitions policies of the museum or exhibition venue.\n\nReviewers are invited by the Museum Review Editor or the Editor-in-Chief, but suggestions of appropriate exhibitions for review are welcome. Publication of reviews is contingent upon acceptance by the Museum Review Editor and Editor-in-Chief. The AJA reserves the right to edit reviews for content and length. Examples of reviews in past issues of the AJA may serve as models (see open access museum reviews).\n\nMuseum Review Submission\n\nA museum review should be submitted as an MS Word file, should be typed double-spaced in 12-point Times New Roman font with 1-inch margins on all sides, and should conform as much as possible to AJA Museum Review Format and Style.\n\nA museum review will not be accepted and scheduled for publication until a signed author warranty and written permission to reproduce any copyrighted figures have been received.\n\nWhen a museum review has been accepted for publication, it will be copyedited, typeset, and proofread. The AJA will communicate with the reviewer during the copyediting stage; page proofs will then be emailed to the reviewer with instructions for making any final corrections. While the reviewer may clarify or modify page proofs in minor ways, no major revisions are permitted. Corrected proofs should be returned within one week of receipt.\n\nThe reviewer will receive one electronic PDF copy of the review. Reviewers may also print copies of their reviews directly from AJA Open Access.\n\nMuseum Review Format and Style\n\nHeading\n\nReviews of temporary exhibitions should be preceded by a heading listing the exhibition or gallery installation to be reviewed. For example:\n\nUnearthing the Truth: Egypt’s Pagan and Coptic Sculpture, Brooklyn Museum, Brooklyn, 13 February–10 May 2009, curated by Edna R. Russmann.\n\nRoma: La Pittura di un Impero, Scuderie del Quirinale, Rome, 24 September 2009–17 January 2010, curated by Eugenio La Rocca, Serena Ensoli, Stefano Tortorella, and Massimiliano Papini.\n\nIf the exhibition is accompanied by a catalogue, the bibliographic information should be included. For example:\n\nUnearthing the Truth: Egypt’s Pagan and Coptic Sculpture, by Edna R. Russmann. New York: Brooklyn Museum 2009. Pp. 91, color figs. 44. ISBN 978-0-87273-162-2 (cloth). $19.95.\n\nRoma: La Pittura di un Impero, edited by Eugenio La Rocca, Serena Ensoli, Stefano Tortorella, and Massimiliano Papini. Milan: Skira 2009. Pp. 333, b&w figs. 71, color figs. 172. ISBN 978-88-572-0425-3 (paper). €38.\n\nReviewer Information\n\nAt the end of the review, reviewers should include their name in the exact format in which they would like it to appear, department (optional), institution, location, and email address. Or, if the reviewer is an independent scholar: their name in the exact format in which they would like it to appear, Independent Scholar, location, and email address. Authors who wish to present their information differently are welcome to discuss it with us.\n\nText and References\n\nA review should run approximately 4,000 to 5,000 words. Notes and accompanying bibliography are permitted. See also the list of AJA abbreviations of titles of periodicals and standard reference works. Works not listed should be written in full.\n\nFigures\n\nA museum review may be accompanied by up to five figures. Authors may include up to five additional figures to appear as online-only supplementary material. No figures will be published without written permission from the copyright holder. See Figure Preparation on the AJA website for more information.\n\nAdditional Formatting and Style Information\n\nFor other matters of style and format, AJA Museum Reviews should follow the guidelines for all contributors to the AJA: http://www.ajaonline.org/submissions."
