Here at the School we believe that archaeology can play a crucial role in this endeavour.\n\nArchaeology gives us the tools to examine and explain human behaviour, understand how society functions, learn from the past and apply those lessons to the present, and analyse the drivers and implications of a changing world and how different countries, places and cultures interact.\n\nWe have challenged our staff and students to tell us why they think archaeology matters. We will continue to post their responses below."
