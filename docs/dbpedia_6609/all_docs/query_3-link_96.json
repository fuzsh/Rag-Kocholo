        "text": "WHAT IS BIBLICAL ARCHAEOLOGY?\n\nBiblical Archaeology is the study of archaeological sites in the land of Israel. Its main task is to explore history and culture through excavation, collection and interpretation of ancient settlements and its artifacts, architecture, and material remains. It is concerned with the recovery and interpretation of artifacts from the past. Through careful study of these material remains, archaeologists are able to learn a great deal about the peoples and cultures of ancient times.\n\nWhat can it tell you about the Bible?\n\nWhat doesn't it tell you about the Bible?\n\n\"What archaeology cannot do, however, even at its best, is to prove the Bible in any senseeither by demonstrating that the events claimed by the biblical writers as central to the salvation history actually happened, much less by validating the theological inference s that are drawn from these events, whether ancient or modern. The notion that historical proofs can confirm, or even enhance, religious faith is a contradiction in terms.\"\n\nWilliam G. Dever in The Anchor Bible Dictionary, Freedman, David Noel, ed., (New York: Doubleday) 1997, 1992 CD Rom Version."
