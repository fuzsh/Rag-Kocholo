With respect to this point of view, nowadays, comparative and interdisciplinary disciplines are also collaborated to each other. Archaeological investigations followed by related scientific methods would try to get answer to the problems which were mentioned by archaeologists due to the know-how in antiquity. Archaeometry means, the use of new instrumental, statistical methods for interpreting the technology based on collected archaeological data. In another word, archaeometry is a methodology for data management which has been collected via different expertise of each scientific discipline. Archaeometrical studies focus mostly on generate and development of common language for linking human science with another discipline such as science, engineering and medicine."
