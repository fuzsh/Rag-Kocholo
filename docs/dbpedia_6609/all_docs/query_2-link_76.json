        "text": "JINAN, China, March 31, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Recently, the Key Laboratory for Archaeological Sciences and Technology of Shandong University has been approved by the Ministry of Education of China. This is another significant research platform approved by the Ministry of Education for the discipline of archaeology at Shandong University, following the approval of the \"Joint International Research Laboratory for Environmental and Social Archaeology\" in 2016.\n\nThe discipline of archaeology at Shandong University is based on field archaeology and stresses interdisciplinary integration and internationalization. It has played a pioneering and leading role in the discipline transformation towards settlement archaeology over the last two decades, showing strength and great achievements in the fields of human origins and evolution, environment and resources, technology and economy, settlement and society, and conservation techniques of cultural relics.\n\nIn 2010, the \"Environmental Archaeology Innovation and Intelligence Introduction Base\" was renamed \"Environmental and Social Archaeology Innovation and Intelligence Introduction Base\" and was approved as the first innovation and intelligence introduction base of the humanities in China. Besides, the experimental teaching center was listed as one of the first batches of the national demonstration centers for archaeology in 2009, which marks the further increasing significance of archaeological science in the professional training system. In 2016, the \"Joint International Research Laboratory of Environmental and Social Archaeology\" founded by Shandong University and Yale University was approved by the Ministry of Education, becoming the only international joint laboratory in the humanities in China. In 2020, the \"Shandong Key Laboratory of Cultural Heritage Conservation and Archaeological Science\" was approved. In addition, Shandong University Museum was selected as a national first-class museum in 2020, which is the only national first-class museum of History and Archaeology based at a university in China.\n\nBuilt upon the teaching and research platforms mentioned above, the discipline of archaeology at Shandong University has attracted and nurtured many talented scholars in recent years. There are 53 faculty members in the Department of Archaeology, forming a well-structured, powerful, innovative, and collaborative academic team. Based on fieldwork and focusing on evidence-based research, eight projects led by Shandong University were awarded \"China's Top 10 New Archaeological Discoveries\".\n\nSince 2018, the Department of Archaeology has been awarded six national-level major and key projects, one second prize for Excellent Achievement Awards in Institution of Higher Education announced by the Ministry of Education, five first prizes for the Shandong Provincial Social Science Outstanding Achievement Awards (including one special award), and one project as \"2020 Top 10 World Archaeological Discoveries\". Besides, they have published 16 monographs and more than 300 research papers, including several high-level papers published in the top journals of China and abroad, such as Nature, Science, Cell, PNAS, Acta Archaeological Sinica, and Archaeology, etc."
