        "text": "Most of humanity’s accomplishments predated writing. Delve deep into the trenches in search of the origins of technology, art, agriculture, social complexity, and the very beginning of our own species.\n\nExplore the rise and fall of vast empires that once stretched from the Atlantic across the Mediterranean to the Black Sea. Uncover the expansive cities, forts, villas, and temples that still dot these ancient landscapes today.\n\nThe massive Near Eastern mounds (tels) hide clues to contested narratives that still shape our world. Grab a trowel and a canteen, and join our experts as they shed new light on the ancient past.\n\nStudy cultures and people of the ancient and more recent past, for which we have detailed written and pictorial records in addition to material remains.\n\nThe dead tell fascinating tales. Use methods of biology and forensics to study archaeological human remains to reconstruct past populations’ migrations, activities, diet, health, and death.\n\nMuch of our world heritage lies along coastlines, below the world’s oceans and lakes. Dive beneath the waves to discover, document, excavate, and preserve submerged settlements and fragile shipwrecks.\n\nThe past is a non-renewable resource. Gain training in the evaluation, management, protection, and preservation of cultural heritage sites from an applied perspective, one of the fastest-growing specializations in archaeology today.\n\nWhere the ancient past meets the digital future. Learn to develop tools and applications for digitization, analysis, and visualization of large datasets generated by field research and museum collections.\n\nFind clues on how humans modified and interacted with their natural environment, and what these ancient landscapes can teach us about climate change today.\n\nLearn from and work with local communities surrounding the field site. Engage in community activities from local museums to elementary school science fairs, and practice methods of communicating research to the public.\n\nTransport back to your period of study by practicing past technologies of the time. Empirically analyze methods and test hypotheses by replicating materials that appear in the archaeological record.\n\nApply methods from the earth sciences to archaeological investigation. Learn about soil science, hydrology, geomorpholocial processes, and use remote sensing technologies such as LiDAR, magnetometry, and ground penetrating radar (GPR) for geophysical survey.\n\nResearch the many civilizations and cultures that thrived in the Americas before the arrival of Columbus and other colonists in 1492.\n\nSpanning a time period from the fall of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century to the Renaissance in the 15th century, Medieval Europe saw the rise of various cultural groups and conflicts from the Vikings to the Black Death.\n\nCollaborate with and learn from Indigenous peoples who claim heritage to archaeological sites. Engage in relevant discussions about the valuable contributions indigenous knowledge brings to scholarship."
