It is an important early Neolithic site and dates from round 10,000 BP. During three seasons of excavation in 2001, 2003 and 2005, tombs, ash-pits, fireplaces and other vestiges were revealed along with abundant objects, including chipped stone implements, microliths, polished stone tools and pottery, bone and shell artifacts, as well as various animal and plant remains. The well-preserved human skeletons from the tombs constitute a batch of valuable data to studying early Neolithic man in the Beijing area and even the whole North China. The discovery of the site also has great significance to further research into the evolution of early Neolithic cultures in North China and the relationships between them.\n\nHunan Provincial Institute of Cultural Relics and Archaeology, Neolithic Gaomiao Site in Hongjiang City, Hunan\n\nKEY WORDS: Hunan Gaomiao site Gaomiao culture Daxi culture\n\nABSTRACT: The Gaomiao site lies at Yanli Village of Chatou Township in Anbian Town, Hongjiang City, Hunan Province. In 1991, 2004 and 2005, the Hunan Provincial Institute of Cultural Relics and Archaeology carried out here three seasons of excavation by revealing an total area of 1,700 sq m. This is a Neolithic shell-mount site with a lower and an upper cultural layers. The lower deposits belong to the âGaomiaoâ culture and date from ca. 7800â6800 BP. The remains include a large-sized sacrificial place, tombs and house-foundations, as well as a large amount of fine pottery of white ware and that with complex designs. The upper layer can be attributed to the Daxi culture and dated to ca. 6300â5300 BP. It contains a lot of house-foundations and tombs, including two joint side-by-side burials with jade grave goods. Among the unearthed objects are quantities of pottery vessels and stone and bone implements.\n\nShanxi Provincial Institute of Cultural Relics and Archaeology et al., Western Zhou Cemetery at Hengshui in Jiangxian County, Shanxi\n\nKEY WORDS: Shanxi Hengshui cemetery Western Zhou period\n\nPeng State\n\nABSTRACTS: The Hengshui cemetery is situated in the west of Hengbei Village of Hengshui Town in Jiangxian County, Shanxi Province. Since December 2004, the Shanxi Provincial Institute of Cultural Relics and Archaeology and other institutions has carried out there a large-scale excavation. By the end of 2005, above 110 tombs had been revealed,and a great number of bronze ritual objects and horse-and-chariot trappings, pottery vessels, lacquered wooden articles and jades had been unearthed. Tombs M1 and M2 are side-by-side joint burial pits for a couple. They are large in scale and rich in grave goods, with a well-preserved âburial curtainâ remaining in M1. According to the inscribed bronzes unearthed, the owner of M2 must have been the Peng earl of the middle Western Zhou period, approximately the late Mu king reign, and that of M1, his wife. The whole cemetery can be firmly attributed to the Peng State.\n\nInstitute of Archaeology, Nanjing Museum, et al., Earthen-mounted Tombs of the Zhou Period in Jurong and Jintan Cities, Jiangsu\n\nKEY WORDS: Jiangsuearthen-mounted tombs Zhou period\n\nABSTRACTS: In April to September 2005, the Institute of Archaeology, Nanjing Museum, carried out a large-scale excavation to explore earthen-mounted tombs at Jurong Tianwangsi and Jintan Xuebu. They excavated 40 earthen mounts, revealed 233 tombs, unearthed 229 groups of sacrificial objects, discovered the remains of 14 burial buildings, and found more than 3,800 celadon vessels and other cultural relics. The excavation results greatly enriched the knowledge of the cultural connotation of earthen-mounted tombs in South China, clarified a lot of previously unsolved mysteries in academic circles, made important breakthroughs in the shape, structure and burial and sacrificial customs of earthen- mounted tombs, and at the same time provided detailed reliable first-hand material for studying the origin, evolution, periodization and regionalization of these burials.\n\nXinjiang Archaeological Team, IA, CASS, Liushui Cemetery of the Bronze Age in Yutian County, Xinjiang\n\nKEY WORDS: Xinjiang Liushui cemetery stone-barrowed tombs\n\nStone-enclosed tombs Bronze Age\n\nABSTRACT: In 2003 to 2005, the Center of Archaeological Researches on Borderland, IA, CASS, carried out excavation in the Liushui cemetery in Yutian County, Xinjiang. The excavated 65 tombs are all earthen pits with stone barrows or enclosures on the surface, and contain multi-person secondary burials in most cases, generally with animal bones as remains of funeral objects. Among the rest of grave goods are pottery vessels with incised design, metal ornaments in the Skythian style and distinctive bronzes, jades and stone artifacts. The cemetery is the first group of Bronze Age tombs and the earliest cultural remains archaeologists have discovered at the northern foot of the Kunlun Mountains. It provided scientific data for researching into the cultural aspect of the local inhabitants in the first millennium BC.\n\nXiâan Tang City Archaeological Team, IA, CASS, Danfengmen Gate-site of Daminggong Palace, Tang Changâan City in Xiâan City\n\nKEY WORDS: Xiâan Tang Changâan CityDaminggong Palace\n\nDanfengmen Gate-site\n\nABSTRACT: In September to December 2005, the Xiâan Tang City Archaeological Team, IA, CASS, excavated the ruined Danfengmen Gate, the middle southern gate of Daminggong Palace in Tang Changâan City, by revealing an area of nearly 8,000 sq m. The gate was of five-passageway structure, in the super-grade city-gate style in ancient times. Its remains include the vestiges of rammed-earthen platforms, passageways, partition walls, raised roads and city walls, suggesting that the gate might have been destroyed in a catastrophic fire. Most of the unearthed objects are bricks, cylindric and flat tiles, tile-ends, glazed tiles, chiwen owl-tail ridge ornaments, button-shaped iron nails, and white porcelain shards. The excavation clarified on the whole the form of the gate and provided first-hand scientific material for studying the history of ancient Chinese architecture.\n\nZhang Xuelian, 13C and 15N Analyses Applied in the study of Ancient Human Diet and Their New Advances\n\nKEY WORDS: 13C15N ancient manâs diet\n\nABSTRACT: Analyses of the stable isotopes 13C and 15N remaining in ancient human bones provide direct information on man himself for studying ancient manâs diet. 13C analysis can be applied to infer manâs staple food, i.e. to determine which plant they ate, while 15N one offers evidence on manâs meat and the grade of their nutrition. The combination of 13C and 15N analyses and archaeological researches on the background of analyzed samples can rather objectively reveal ancient manâs diet. Presently, the two methods are being increasingly perfected and playing an active role in archaeological studies.\n\nCorrespondent of the Present Journal, A Summary of the âArchaeological Forum, CASS: New Discoveries in Chinese Archaeology during 2005â and the âConversation on the Archaeological Forum and the Propaganda and Exchange of Archaeological Accomplishmentsâ\n\nKEY WORDS: Chinese archaeology Archaeological Forum\n\nnew discoveries new accomplishments\n\nABSTRACT: To exhibit the newest major accomplishments in the field excavation and study of Chinese Archaeology and to promote academic exchange, the âArchaeological Forum, CASS: New Discoveries in Chinese Archaeology during 2005â was held in Beijing on 10th January, 2006. At the academic lecture speakers reported the six important archaeological discoveries from the prehistoric Donghulin site in Beijing City, the Neolithic Gaomiao site in Hongjiang City, Hunan, earthen-mounted tombs of the Zhou period in Jurong and Jintan cities, Jiangsu, the Western Zhou Hengshui cemetery in Jiangxian County, Shanxi, the Bronze Age Liushui cemetery in Yutian, Xinjiang, and the Danfengmen Gate-site of Daminggong Palace in Tang Changâan City, Xiâan, as well as recent advances in the application of 13C and 15N analyses for the study of ancient manâs diet, on all of which the attending scholars carried out deep-going discussions. At the âConversation on the Archaeological Forum and the Propaganda and Exchange of Archaeological Accomplishmentsâ held on 11th January, 2006, a summary was made on the successful experiences in the propaganda and exchange of archaeological achievements.\n\n14C Laboratory of the Archaeological Science and Techniques Experiment and Research Center, IA, CASS, 14C Dates (XXXII)\n\nKEY WORDS:14C dating half life of 14C archaeological sites\n\nABSTRACT: The present report publishes the chronological data of 21 specimens dated by the 14C Laboratory of the Archaeological Science and Techniques Experiment and Research Center, IA, CASS, in 2005. These specimens came from the following sites: Gaohongcun in Liulin Countyï¼3 piecesï¼ and Gaolouhe in Jixian County (1) of Shanxi; Xishuipo in Puyang of Henan (4); Fourth Sun Yat-sen Road in Guangzhou of Guangdong (2); Niulanshi (2), Dingshishan (3) and Lingwu (2) in Yongning County and Qiujiang in Hengxian County (2) of Guangxi; and Yongxing in Mianyang of Sichuan (2).\n\nHu Yaowu et al., A Study of the Depollution of the Hydroxyapatite in Ancient Human bones\n\nKEY WORDS: ancient human bones hydroxyapatite XRD Raman\n\nspectrum ICP-AES\n\nABSTRACT: The present paper reports a study of human bones unearthed from Tomb M11 on the Xigongqiao site of Dawenkou culture in Tengzhou City, Shandong. The selected samples were definitely divided into polluted and unpolluted by means of XRD and Raman spectrum analyses. Then a series of physical and chemical treatments were made on the polluted samples. The results of an ICP-AES analysis show that the Sr content in them is roughly the same as that in the unpolluted sample. This study provided a rather effective method for the depollution of the hydroxyapatite in Ancient human bones, which has important value to the investigation of ancient manâs diet.\n\nZhang Jun and Zhu Zhangyi, Examination of Late Neolithic Human Bones from the Shijiefang Site in Chengdu City\n\nKEY WORDS: Chengdu Shijiefang site late Neolithic Age\n\nhuman bones custom of tooth extraction\n\nABSTRACT: The Shijiefang site in Chengdu City belongs to the late Neolithic Baodun culture and dates from ca. 4000 BP. 13 adult individuals have been identified from the human bones discovered in the tombs of the site and identified in the paper. Among the 10 examinable jaws, three of the four male adult individuals are tooth-extracted, and for the other six female samples, only one individual shows this custom. The extracted teeth are unexceptionally a pair of upper second incisors, which shares the same form with the extraction prevailing among Neolithic peoples in other areas of China and seems to have been more popular among males.\n\nLi Xiaoqin and Han Rufen, Analysis of the Technology of Bronzes from the Haimenkou Site in Jianchuan County, Yunnan, and Their Date\n\nKEW WORDS:Haimenkou site bronze artifacts technology\n\nlate Spring-and-Autumn period\n\nABSTRACT: This paper presents the results of a compositional analysis of some bronze artifacts unearthed from Jianchuan Haimenkou site of Yunnan. Pure copper and Cu-Sn and Cu-Pb alloys were identified in these artifacts by means of SEM, with the second as the dominant component. Metallographic microscope examination showed that a series of making techniques, such as casting, forging and cold working after forging, had been used by that time. It can be concluded that the artifacts analyzed belong to the Bronze Age. Based on relevant radiocarbon dates and other archaeological evidence, the paper argues that the bronze artifacts unearthed from the Haimenkou site should be attributed to the late Spring-and-Autumn period.\n\nWu Xiaoping, Book Review: Archaeo-geography in the Lower Yangtze River Valley\n\nKEY WORDS: archaeo-geography archaeological remains lower Yangtze River valley ecological environments"
