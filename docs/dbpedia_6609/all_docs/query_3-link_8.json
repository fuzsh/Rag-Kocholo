        "text": "Home | Learn | Connecting Archaeology and History\n\nArchaeology in Oklahoma\n\nConnecting Archaeology and History\n\nHow are history and archaeology related?\n\nHistory and archaeology both study ancient people and things. Specifically, historians study older documents and artifacts and create an interpretation of the past for the public. Archaeologists excavate artifacts that both the archaeologists and historians study. Archaeologists also look at historical documents, but they typically use them for background information on a site. The fields of history and archaeology study very similar things but do so from different viewpoints.\n\nHow are history and archaeology different?\n\nHistory and archaeology are different in that they study the artifacts from different perspectives. Archaeologists are more concerned with the physical evidence (artifacts); historians rely more on documentary evidence to support their work.\n\nWhy is this important?\n\nEven though historians and archaeologists study the past differently, they are connected. It is important to remember that when studying early history, the evidence historians use most likely comes from an archaeological site discovered by a professional. When an archaeologist is preparing for a dig, they do background research and use historical archives to help estimate who might have lived there.\n\nImpact on today?\n\nArchaeology sites are found all over the world every day leading to new insights of the past. The artifacts the archaeologists find, after being analyzed, go to museums all over the world to share the past with their visitors. Maybe one day the toy you played with as a child will be found in an archaeological site and be put on display for the world to see and interpret.\n\nHow does this connect to museums, and where can you learn about the field of archaeology?"
