        "text": "1. Introduction\n\nScience maps are a way of representing the nature of academic research based on networks of relationships identifiable from the metadata of academic documents. They visualise the relationships created by, for example, patterns of authorship, the choice of words used and the ties created from one document to others through citation. Science maps provide a mechanism for visualising the shape and examining the structure of a discipline in an age when academic research results in many millions of research outputs being published each year (see Petrovich 2021). Like an aerial survey of a landscape, science maps offer a perspective of breadth (of topic) and time depth that can identify aspects of a discipline's nature that will merit further investigation through more detailed reading and data collection. Despite the enormous potential of science mapping, and the persistent interest in the history and development of archaeology demonstrated by archaeologists over decades, the technique has been rarely used to map the discipline of archaeology. The first visualisation of archaeological research, based on the metadata of more than 20,000 documents published between 2004-2013, appeared in 2016 and provided a series of three maps based on co-citation relationships between source titles and between authors, as well as the co-occurrence relationships between terms extracted from titles and abstracts (Sinclair 2016). The current study, still only the second attempt to map archaeological research at a discipline level, examines the subsequent period, from 2014 to 2021. It is based on metadata from more than 50,000 documentary research outputs.\n\nOngoing developments in science-mapping software have increased the range of maps presented to include additional aspects of archaeological research such as co-occurrence networks based on author keywords, as well as the collaborations created by networks of co-authorship between individuals and their institutions. Moreover, an online version of the mapping software used now makes it possible to provide online examples of these maps so that readers can explore them in detail rather than having to zoom in and out of large, stitched images. In so doing it is now easy to search for individual authors, institutions, or terms, and to adjust the clustering parameters of nodes and to adjust the number of links represented between them.\n\nThis article will proceed with a brief discussion of the use of document metadata to reveal relationships between documents and provide a window on aspects of academic practice. It will be followed by a longer description of the dataset and the software used. A series of six science maps will then be presented and briefly described. At the end a series of larger issues are identified for more detailed discussion. These include reflections on the growth of archaeological research in terms of its documentary corpus, its academic diversity and the language of archaeology, made possible by comparing the maps presented for the first time here with new maps for the period 2004-2013 covered in the earlier study.\n\nIn brief, the maps demonstrate strong continuity in the discipline through time, along with important changes. Archaeology is revealed to be an extraordinarily diverse field of research with multiple specialties across the sciences while retaining strong connections into the social sciences and the humanities and arts. It is the nature of archaeology's engagement with approaches and methods from across the natural, formal and life sciences as well as the research collaborations that are necessary to this work that drives the shape of the discipline. Archaeological research is, in many cases, an inherently multidisciplinary and international activity creating extensive collaborative ties that span continents, between individuals as researchers as well as their institutions. The total number of research documents published is still increasing dramatically and as fast as any other scientific field measured; it is now also dominated by the production of journal articles. Women researchers are more visible among the most cited researchers, particularly in certain research specialties. However, there are certain research specialisms where these maps identify that this process is less visible or even absent. The language used by archaeologists in titles and abstracts presents archaeology as a multidisciplinary field with multiple named specialisms poorly classified within the wider research infrastructure. The impact of archaeology's engagement with other sciences is highly visible. The keywords used by archaeologists emphasise new types of data and technique over the essential processes of dealing with fragmentary and sampled data. Variability in the use of even basic methodological and conceptual terms suggests that archaeologists may need to think carefully about an active curation of their terminology as a controlled vocabulary, if only to aid future researchers in locating their work.\n\n2. Academic Documents as a Window on Knowledge Creation\n\nScience mapping uses the metadata for sets of related academic documents extracted from one of the major bibliometric databases such as the Web of Science and Scopus. These metadata are read and analysed as networks of relationships and then graphically represented as two-dimensional images (see Chen 2017 for a recent review of the field). The mapping process identifies academic elements within this metadata as nodes and the relationships between them as edges. Nodes might be authors, institutions, countries, funding bodies, individual documents or source titles - such as journal names, etc. Edges, or links, are the relationships between nodes as revealed by forms of citation, co-occurrence, co-authorship or funding, etc. (see Mickel et al. in press. for a discussion). A clustering process ('community detection') is then used to identify groups of more closely related nodes and these clusters can on occasion be evaluated in terms of their centrality within and betweenness across clusters according to standard network analysis (see Newman 2018). Time-slicing of data makes it possible to examine change through time.\n\nThe interpretation of science maps depends upon how relationships between nodes in the map can be interpreted as forms of academic practice (sociological relations) or as forms of intellectual structure (intellectual relations) within a research specialty, through the lens of the effect that these relations have on the nature of the documents produced - the documentary level (see Petrovich 2019). While science mapping itself has only become popular in the last 20 years, the method builds upon an established body of research starting in the 1950s that set out to study the nature and growth of science as both a social and intellectual enterprise, using the quantitative methods of science itself (scientometrics). Science maps explore the nature of the network links between elements of document metadata as a mechanism for examining the changing relationships between sets of academic communities and the knowledge networks they create.\n\nA series of basic document to document relationships are usually at the basis of most science maps. For example,\n\nDirect citation - from one document back to a source document(s) generates a quasi-'genealogical' relationship - an 'algorithmic historiography' in Garfield et al.'s terms (Garfield et al. 2003, 400) - from one knowledge claim back to its prior influences if we presume that citation records influence (but see Sinclair 2016 section 3, box 2, for a discussion of the alternatives).\n\nEgo-Alter Citation - a particular type of direct citation - distinguishes between the references that an author uses in the course of their research, and the way in which their own documents are made reference to by others (White 2000; 2001) . Ego-alter citation allows us to explore how the cited references of an author (or research group, institution) as 'ego' chart the influence of other work on ego's own knowledge claims. This is ego's 'citation identity'. And in reverse, it allows us to explore how an author(s) work is cited by others (as 'alter') and what this may reveal about how the author's knowledge claims have become incorporated/had an influence upon the work of others around them. This is the author's 'citation image'. (See Sinclair 2020 for the only example of this approach used in archaeology.)\n\nBibliographic coupling links together two or more citing documents that share a number of cited references in common (Kessler 1963). Since most cited references in any academic document usually date to within a few years of the publication date of the citing document, two bibliographically coupled documents might be interpreted as knowledge claims related to the same, active research topic. Importantly, bibliographic coupling relationships do not change over time since reference lists are fixed at the publication of a document. Clusters of bibliographically coupled documents, therefore, have been interpreted as literature sets for specific research problems - a 'research front' (Persson 1994). Bibliographic coupling can also be applied to authors (individuals appearing together in the same list of cited references), allowing clusters of bibliographical coupled authors to be interpreted as the active scientific community working on a specific research problem.\n\nCo-citation links together two or more cited documents (or authors, institutions, etc.) that are referenced together in another document(s) Marshakova 1973; Small 1973). Co-citation relationships are likely to change over time since a document can be co-cited with any other in a subsequent publication. As the cumulative total of academic literature in a field grows and specific research topics change, co-citation relationships will change. Since two documents may be co-cited by other documents related to different research topics, co-citation aggregates a greater set of documents. It is assumed that co-citation relations, therefore, represent the basic knowledge - the intellectual base - of a research domain or discipline for the time period under examination or the broader community of researchers within a domain.\n\nCo-authorship links people who collaborate as research partners. Co-authorship, per se, can inform us about the degree to which specialists need to work together in order to complete a knowledge claim in their research domain. This might result from the need to include specialists with research expertise across multiple disciplines (possible evidence of multidisciplinary or interdisciplinary research), or perhaps the need to subdivide research work into smaller parts to be completed by multiple individuals. At a higher level, the affiliation(s) of an author make it possible to observe how collaboration between specialists creates links between larger academic units (institutions, departments, or even research groups). In so doing co-authorship ties also identify national or international relationships, or professional and academic collaborations. By definition, co-authorship-based science maps cannot represent the work or the possible, informal collaborations between specialists who publish on their own. There may be significant differences in the pattern of solo-authored versus co-authored-research work between research domains (we might contrast, for example, the document-based research of literature scholars versus the laboratory- or fieldwork-based research of environmental scientists). These same differences might also exist within a single research domain.\n\nCo-occurrence relationships identify academic elements that occur together such as terms used for describing the research of a discipline. Science maps showing clusters of co-occurring terms can be interpreted as the set of language terms that is used to investigate a thematic research area. Change in the use of terms through time can inform us about the introduction of new research problems or the introduction of new methods, the loss of older terms or the greater use of terms that might once have been the language of a restricted group of specialists to a more common pattern of usage. Terms can be extracted from titles, abstracts or full texts of documents using techniques of natural language processing (NLP) or they can be read directly from lists of author keywords or index keywords (keywords appended to the document metadata by the bibliometric database itself).\n\nScience mapping has become increasingly popular in the last 20 years because the enormous number of documents published has made it almost impossible for individual scholars to write histories of a discipline through the reading of individual documents, while the development of specialist software for the analysis of networks in bibliometrics data has resulted in the ability to analyse the relationships within and between documents quickly and at scale.\n\n3. The Dataset\n\nScience maps would ideally be based on metadata for the full set of documents produced within the area of academic research under investigation. While this may be possible where the focus is narrowly defined (the documents published within a specific journal, for example), as the area of investigation expands, to a research domain for example, the reality is that only a sample of that set will be available. The key requirement for such a sample will be the coverage of a field's literature, the quality of the key metadata (authors, affiliations, dates, titles, abstracts) available. Cited reference information is essential since many forms of science mapping are visualisations of network relationships generated through forms of citation. An additional factor is the ease with which the required bibliometric data can be identified, and then downloaded for visualisation using mapping software.\n\n3.1 The best bibliometric database for archaeology\n\nMost science mapping studies rely on data from the two long-established, subscription-based bibliometric databases (or citation indices). The Web of Science (hereafter WoS), now owned by Clarivate Analytics, traces its origins back to the original Science Citation Index created by Eugene Garfield. The original index was augmented by a Social Science Citation Index in 1973 and an Arts and Humanities Citation Index in 1978 to form the Core Collection. The other major index, Scopus, started in 2004 based originally on data derived from the journal publications of its owner, Elsevier. The scale of publication of academic literature, the original limitations of technology and labour in the process of creating citation databases and initial beliefs about the relative impact of different journals meant that both WoS and Scopus were highly selective in the journals and books they chose to index (see Garfield 1972; 1979; 1996 for the selection rationale behind the production of the WoS Citation Indices). It is widely acknowledged that both index a moderate percentage (15-20%) of journals published when the number indexed is compared to the broader, but still selective, listing of periodical publications compiled by Ulrich's (2022). Selection has a significant impact on all aspects of literature search, research evaluation and science-mapping. WoS and Scopus index many more journals and other documents from publishers based in the USA and Western Europe, along with documents in the English language (at least in terms of a translated title and abstract). Subject-wise, they are both more orientated towards research publications in the Sciences and Social Sciences. WoS and Scopus also require their indexed material to have been peer-reviewed (Delgado López-Cózar et al. 2019). Studies examining relative coverage have shown that Scopus is the larger database with a better representation of documents and books in the Social Sciences and the Arts and Humanities (Martín-Martín et al. 2018; 2021). Both WoS and Scopus have expanded greatly, especially in the last 20 years. This includes an increase in the number of journals indexed (see Bordignon 2019 for a summary of Scopus index additions by subject area) as well as in the range of academic literature indexed. WoS has added a Book Citation Index, an Emerging Sources Citation Index, as well as expanded its Science Citation Index; it has also added a number of specifically regional indices including a Chinese Science Citation Index, a Russian Science Citation Index, an index for South and Latin America, South Africa, Spain and Portugal (the SciELO Citation Index) and, most recently, a Korean Citation Index and an Arabic Regional Citation Index. WoS and Scopus actively curate their indices to ensure the reliability of their metadata. Beside WoS and Scopus, Google Scholar, which gathers document metadata from web pages during the process of indexing those pages for Google searches, is still recognised as holding information on the largest number of academic documents. However, it has always been difficult to use Google Scholar for bibliometric studies since there is no application programming interface through which to download datasets including cited reference data (Delgado López-Cózar et al. 2019; Visser et al. 2021). While there has been some progress in the ability to extract data from Google Scholar (Else 2018) and there is software available that allows for extraction of basic document data (without cited references) for individual scholars (i.e. Publish or Perish software, Harzing 2007), it is still not possible to identify and extract large sets of document metadata. Consequently, Google Scholar remains largely unused as a data source for science mapping. Microsoft Academic, created in 2005 and modified thereafter, provided a comparative dataset to Google Scholar and was compiled in the same way. It has been possible to download data from Microsoft Academic, where available, and it has been used in some science mapping (e.g. Chen 2020), but direct access to this dataset ceased at the end of 2021.\n\nSince 2016, two other databases have become widely available: Dimensions (app.dimensions.ai) and Lens (lens.org). Dimensions has commercial subscriptions for institutions that allow complex analysis of science data, but, importantly, it is free for individual researchers to search for literature and download metadata sets of up to 2500 documents in size, useable for science mapping. Research on database coverage (Martín-Martín et al. 2018; 2021; Visser et al. 2021) demonstrates that Dimensions and Scopus are currently very similar in size and probable coverage. Lens aggregates metadata from a number of sources (including CrossRef, Semantic Scholar, OpenCitations and Microsoft Academic Services). It is free to use and allows downloads of metadata for sets of up to 50,000 documents. Lens now includes data from Microsoft Academic and as a result currently contains much more data on archaeological documents than WoS, Scopus or Dimensions. At first sight, Lens looks like the best source of data for science mapping archaeology. This may certainly prove to be the case in the future, but an examination of a set of downloaded metadata for a set of 50,000 documents in archaeology (collected in January 2022) revealed that more than 50% of the individual document records were missing information on cited references. In 2022, therefore, either Scopus or Dimensions is the best data source for science mapping archaeology. Scopus has been used here owing to its extensive coverage of archaeology in terms of journals and especially in terms of the better coverage of metadata for monographs.\n\n3.2 Identifying a document set for archaeology\n\nThe most common procedure used to locate a document set for discipline-specific science mapping is to undertake a search based on a specific subject category or for a set of journals indexed to a subject category. In Scopus, journals and books are assigned to one of 313 subject categories grouped into 27 larger thematic areas. The assignment of journals to subject categories is not static. New subject categories have been created and existing categories modified, allowing extra subject categories to be added or sometimes deleted from individual journal classifications. The complicated nature of research subject categories and the assignment of journals to such categories have been recognised as a problem for decades since changes (or not) of subject categories affect perceptions of the growth and importance of specific science areas (see Wang and Waltman 2016). This ought to be less of a problem for archaeology since its categorisation(s) by subject has remained essentially static, but it is particularly problematic for multidisciplinary or interdisciplinary research in a field that gets published in journals indexed in another subject category, and archaeology is one such discipline. This is further exacerbated by the increasingly multidisciplinary publication strategies of many high-profile and high-impact journals (e.g. Nature, PLoS One, PNAS, Science among others) that are difficult to assign to any subject category or set thereof but which are highly prized as venues for publication of a wide range of research, including archaeology. Subject categorisation within the bibliometric databases is potentially a significant problem when collecting data on archaeological research outputs; a search based on subject category alone identifies a much smaller number of documents â perhaps as little as 40% of the total (see discussion in Sinclair 2016). Fortunately, one route out of this problem lies in the distinctiveness of the term archaeology itself and its derivatives. Therefore, a document set was identified using a search for \"archaeol* OR archeol*\" in the title, keywords or abstract. It would also be possible to include the full text of documents in such a search, but this was rejected on the ground that the term archaeology might be mentioned in the full text of documents across multiple research fields as a metaphor for a form of study. The search identifies a series of documents related almost exclusively to archaeological research, but with one clear exception; a small number of documents in the subject categories of astronomy and physics are also included in search results. These documents relate to a research topic called 'stellar archaeology' or 'galactic archaeology', which is the study of galactic evolution through the study of stellar populations, using relative spatial position. These documents were eliminated prior to download by excluding all documents in sources categorised as astronomy or physics.\n\nTable 1: Bibliometric metadata for archaeological research outputs published between 2014 and 2021 available in Scopus, Web of Science, Dimensions and Lens (Data collected 31 January 2022). Documents listed as 'early access' are not included Document TypeScopusWeb of ScienceDimensionsLens 2004-132014-212004-132014-212004-132014-212004-132014-21 Articles23,51737,40518,14742,97911,75134,82747,885112,094 Reviews3,6415,2071,3331,281 Conference Papers3,4643,0143,7934,074361582721,075 Book Chapters4,3785,8911,7642,8711,6156,3577,93536,761 Books1,4381,7502273195191,5474,2274,834 TOTAL36,43853,26725,26448,07513,92142,88960,319157,764\n\nA full set of document metadata including the cited references was downloaded for more than 53,000 documents as a series of comma-separated values (CSV) format files. This is a larger set of data than available from either WoS or Dimensions, but smaller than the set identified by Lens (Table 1). Research outputs have been identified as journal articles, books, book chapters and conference or proceedings papers. Journal articles are usually described as either research or review articles. In contrast to the earlier study, metadata for review articles has also been downloaded for mapping. Considerable variation in the number of both types of journal articles between Scopus and WoS, despite similarity in the total number of journal articles, indicates that the long-standing distinction made between review articles and research articles is not reliable, suggesting that research articles in archaeology now include a significant review of prior research as a requirement for acceptance in a peer-reviewed journal. Metadata from documents that are not necessarily research-related (i.e. book reviews, datasets, films, editorial material, and some poetry) were not downloaded.\n\nFinally, as noted in 2016, apart from the absence of metadata for documents published in academic journals but indexed by Scopus, the most significant omission for visualising archaeological research relates to publications deriving from research conducted through the process of professional, developer-related archaeology. Most, though not all, of this research is not published in an academic venue and, even though its findings are beginning to be cited in documents that are academically published, indexed and research evaluated (REF 2022 66-7), remains invisible owing to its exclusion from the major bibliometric databases used for science mapping.\n\n4. The Process of Science Mapping\n\n4.1 Pre-processing of bibliometric metadata\n\nOnce downloaded, document metadata are still not fit for mapping and analysis in their raw state. Despite the curated nature of metadata in a database such as Scopus (Baas et al. 2020), there remain, for example, variations in the names of authors owing to the variations in the recording of first name, initials or full first names and initials, or variations deriving from errors in the placement of commas between parts of names and so forth. Variations of the same author's name need to be reconciled to a single form prior to analysis and mapping. Without reconciliation, all variants will be recognised as separate nodes for analysis, clustering and mapping, leading to a fragmentation and possible misrepresentation of relationships. In addition to author names, variations exist in publication source titles, in author's institutional affiliations (due to the complexity of address details), and even to some extent with country names.\n\nThe problem of variation is more complicated for maps that hope to represent the language used in a research domain. Lists of terms extracted from titles and abstracts, as well as author keywords include singular and plural versions as different terms (i.e. ceramic, ceramics), letter acronyms along with fully expanded acronym names (i.e. 3rd, x ray diffraction, x-ray diffraction), compound terms (i.e. sediment, archaeological sediment), and so forth. These lists of terms also contain variations in site names (sometimes whole and sometimes fragmented; e.g. sima de los hues; los huesos, sima; sima de), variations in the form of date terms (fifth century bc, 5th century bc), and so forth. They also contain non-content related terms such as publisher names and places, page numbers and so forth. The identification of terms to be mapped must not only reconcile variants to a single form as is the case with authors, institutions, source titles, etc. but should also exclude non-relevant terms that do not help identify discipline-specific terminology. The process of reconciliation requires appropriate subject expertise and judgement concerning the purpose of the interpretive map. For these maps advice has been sought from colleagues with subject expertise in specific areas of archaeological research.\n\n4.2 Visualising the bibliometric metadata\n\nSeveral free-to-use software packages exist specifically for science mapping, of which the best known are currently VOSviewer, CitNetExplorer, CiteSpace and Bibliometrix (van Eck and Waltman 2010; 2014a; Chen 2016; Aria and Cuccurullo 2017). VOSviewer, created by van Eck and Waltman at the Centre for Science and Technology Studies at the University of Leiden, is now the most widely used science mapping software (Pan et al. 2018). It has been employed in more than 200 published studies. VOSviewer's key strengths lie in the quality of its visualisation of large datasets (up to 10,000 - nodes or edges), and the ease with which users can refine their maps by varying the number of nodes and edges to be mapped or by exploring the possible clusters of nodes through an iterative adjustment of clustering parameters. VOSviewer also provides a mechanism for pre-processing data prior to mapping. VOSviewer has received regular updates over the last ten years. In 2022, it can use datasets from a greater range of sources: WoS, Scopus, Dimensions, Lens, CrossRef, Semantic Scholar. It can map direct citation, co-citation, bibliographic coupling and co-occurrence relationships. It is now able to recognise the full set of authors from multi-author documents, and to read both author and index keywords where they exist. An online version of VOSviewer was launched in July 2021. Readers can now access the maps presented here online and interrogate these maps directly (zoom in on, search for particular nodes, adjust clustering parameters, etc.) rather than explore large image files, or having to download the datasets and run them within their own version of the program. The online version of VOSviewer has also made it possible for users of Dimensions to generate science maps to examine the metadata of sets of documents they have identified through searching the database â although these maps will have no pre-processing of these metadata to reconcile any of the possible variation problems described above. For this study, maps were created using VOSviewer 1.6.18, released in January 2022.\n\nScience maps involve the identification of a complex set of multi-dimensional network relationships between nodes and their representation in two dimensions. Van Eck and Waltman have published extensively about the processes used by VOSviewer (van Eck and Waltman 2007; 2009; 2010; 2011; 2014b; Waltman and van Eck 2013; Waltman et al. 2010; Perianes-Rodriguez et al. 2016), and a manual is available for users (van Eck and Waltman 2022). A few aspects of the processes used are worth noting. VOSviewer starts by generating an adjacency matrix of relationships between nodes (authors, institutions, documents, sources, terms, etc.) based on forms of citation or co-occurrence and using a measure of association strength on normalised data. Mapping and initial clustering happens using the VOS (Visualisation of Similarities) mapping technique, and a form of weighted and parametrised, modularity-based clustering; both processes are derived from the same underlying mathematical principles, thereby avoiding potential conflicts that can arise if based on different principles. VOSviewer allows users to refine the clusters initially identified by adjusting the clustering resolution and/or the minimum cluster size. The manual recommends that this be done using subject expertise and an iterative refinement of the clustering resolution between 1.0 and 2.0. In each visualisation, VOSviewer scales the size of nodes according to citations, occurrences, or link strength (in co-authorship relations for example). It presents labels for nodes to the extent that the labels will not overlap and obscure each other. The number of labels offered will be partly determined by the maximum number of characters in any label specified by the user. Here, this has been set at 30 characters for all maps. Please note, VOSviewer only presents labels in lower case and without character accents.\n\nWhen mapping the relationships between authors, VOSviewer allows users to specify a maximum number of authors to be considered in case of multi-author documents (set at 25 for this study), and whether author relationships should be based on full or fractional counting. In full counting, each author of a multi-author document is given a weighting equivalent to a single author document (1.0); in fractional counting, authors of multi author documents are given a weighting proportionate to the number of authors of the document (0.2 for an author of a five-author document). Fractional counting is recommended to eliminate the impact of multi-author documents on the mapping of author relationships and this has been used here since the document dataset for archaeology includes both single, joint- and multi-author documents. Terms maps can be constructed using either keywords (author and/or index) attached to a document, or using terms extracted from titles and/or abstracts by natural-language processing (NLP). NLP-extracted terms can be fully counted recording the many times that a term might be used in the text examined, or binary-counted to record the presence/absence of a term. Binary counting is used here.\n\nVOSviewer offers a simple and effective system for pre-processing bibliometric data: the thesaurus file. This is a two-column spreadsheet that helps VOSviewer read an item of metadata (as a potential 'label' for a specific node) and, if necessary, change this to an alternative - 'replace by', or to ignore it if the 'replace by' column is left empty. In this way, a thesaurus file reconciles the variations in metadata discussed above for authors, institutions and so forth. The thesaurus file is used when reading the metadata prior to the recognition of any citation or occurrence relationship and the subsequent creation of any adjacency matrix upon which a science map is drawn. Since thesaurus files exist independently from the mapping of any single dataset (not the case for all other science mapping software), they can be improved over time for mapping particular areas of research. The creation of thesaurus files becomes an ongoing iterative process with the possibility for future development. The thesaurus files used in this study are a development of files first developed in 2016 but now addressing many thousands of variations (author names â 3600+ variations; source titles â 2000+ variations; terms â 2300+ variations; institution names â 4800+ variations). Even so, on detailed inspection of the maps readers will still find examples of variants on author, source and institution names that will be improved upon in future.\n\nIn the maps presented in this article, author labels are reconciled to the family name and the maximum number of identifiable initials (to distinguish between authors sharing the same family name). Institutional affiliations are reconciled to the institution rather than a department or research group within, since the inclusion of this more detailed information is highly variable. Source title names are now abbreviated according to the internationally agreed list for the abbreviation of words in serial publication titles set out in ISO 4 of the International Standards Organization. No list of agreed abbreviations exists for the title words of monographs; these maps use a form of abbreviation that will, hopefully, allow specialists to recognise the monograph easily from its label. For maps of terms, thesaurus files are used to change plural to singular forms and to standardise terms such as variants of method terms. Where necessary, term labels have been abbreviated to reduce node label length to less than 30 characters (i.e. geographical information system to 'geogr. inf. system'). Thesaurus files have also been used to eliminate geographical terms, country names and site names wherever possible to focus on the type of evidence, methodology, the interpretive language and the period.\n\nFinally, and perhaps counter-intuitively, the terms 'archaeology'/'archeology' and 'archaeological'/'archeological' have been excluded from these maps using a thesaurus file. These terms were the basis for the selection of documents in the set, so their inclusion and level of use is not a surprise. However, as the most common terms, used in all types of archaeological research, they are difficult to cluster, while the relative size of their nodes will obscure others. Where these terms would have been mapped is noted in the discussion, below, on the basis of a trial mapping using a modified thesaurus file.\n\nA series of six different forms of science map have been prepared. These cover the intellectual base of archaeology by means of two co-citation maps of cited sources and of cited authors; the conceptual language of the discipline through two co-occurrence maps of terms, one of terms extracted from titles and abstracts by NLP; and, finally, the nature of collaboration through two co-authorship maps representing individual authors, and institutions linked through co-authorship. For most maps, readers will find an annotated figure that presents a screenshot image of the map, with separate colour-coded clusters identified, along with a table listing the clusters and cluster colours identified. The most visible clusters in the maps have been labelled in the same colour as the cluster nodes to provide an interpretation of what they represent. In certain maps, the key dimensions that affect the layout of the maps are identified in one of the upper corners of the map. In addition, readers can access the online version of the map to explore. For each map, figures, tables and online maps use the same series of colours for clusters allocated by VOSviewer in order of decreasing cluster size. For the co-citation maps of sources and authors, and the co-occurrence maps of terms, clusters have been given an interpretive description based on a review of the nodes contained within the cluster. The screenshot figures include these same interpretive descriptions presented close to the most visible clusters. For all maps, the number represented has been chosen to facilitate legibility of node labels: readers can adjust this number in the online map. When discussing change over time reference is made back to the period 2004-2013 covered in the earlier study (Sinclair 2016) and an equivalent map for that period is also presented. Since the maps for the original study were fewer in number and based on WoS data, a new dataset for the period was downloaded from Scopus to ensure comparability and these data were pre-processed using the same set of thesaurus files as used for 2014-2021. Figures, tables and online maps are made available here for both the earlier and later periods.\n\nHere the maps will be presented and described in brief, along with a comparative map covering the earlier period from 2004-2013. In Section 6, there is a longer discussion examining the shape of archaeology between 2004 and 2021 through three themes: (1) the growth of archaeological research, (2) changes in the representation of women as highly cited researchers, and (3) the language of archaeology.\n\n5. Science Maps of Archaeology\n\n5.1 The intellectual base of archaeological research 2014-2021: sources\n\nInteractive maps:\n\nThe map of cited sources presents the 1800 most referenced titles from more than 1 million cited. These have been grouped into 19 separate clusters using a minimum cluster size of 35 items, a clustering resolution of 2.00 and a threshold for inclusion set at 80 citations (Figure 1, Table 2). A series of well-known journals are visible as nodes, and the majority of the strongest co-citation links - the edges - links these major titles. The most cited 20 sources are all serials, with 12 of these being focused on archaeological research. The major general science journals (Nature, Science, PLoS One and PNAS) are all present in this group. The Journal of Archaeological Science, situated in the centre, provides not only the most documents in the dataset but is also most cited, with more than 70,000 citations recognised in Scopus. The first monographs do not appear until much later, with the Encyclopaedia of Global Archaeology and then Palaeoamerican Odyssey, A History of Archaeological Thought, Archaeological Theory Today, and Outline of Theory of Practice. All have fewer than 650 recognised citations.\n\nTable 2: Clusters and example nodes for the co-citation map of source titles referenced in archaeological research outputs published between 2014 and 2021.

These science-based titles occupy about two-thirds of the map's distribution of nodes. There are four major clusters of archaeological publications visible dealing with Europe and its prehistory, the Near East and the Classical World, archaeology in the Americas with a clear interest in interpretive debate, and a cluster that can be interpreted as more about the interpretation of the record. In the science side of the map, we can see clusters related the analysis of the human body and populations, genetics, climate change, the plant world and environmental change, landscapes and geophysics and materials analysis. The exception to this division is a cluster of titles related to the study of human evolution typified by the Journal of Human Evolution and Quaternary International. Within the map, but less immediately visible are smaller clusters of nodes that relate to the archaeology of specific regions (Africa, Australasia and the Pacific, and China and the Far East, and the earliest colonisation and occupation of North America) as well as a science cluster related to behaviour and cognition within which Current Anthropology, Evolutionary Anthropology and Science are clustered. The relative placing of science-focused titles also points to a second broad division between research that relates to the human body and its associated life sciences at the top, and research related to the environmental and material sciences at the bottom.\n\nTable 3: Clusters and example nodes for the co-citation map of source titles referenced in archaeological research outputs published between 2004 and 2013.

While science was identified as a significant side to the nature of the intellectual base for archaeology in 2004-13, the influence of the sciences is still growing, together with the major high-impact science journals. Of the 2000 most highly cited sources in archaeology visible in these co-citation maps, in both cases more than 700 titles (~40%) are science sources that would not be classified as archaeological in nature.\n\n5.2 The intellectual base of archaeological research 2014-2021: authors\n\nTable 4: Clusters and example nodes in the network of collaboration between authors derived from aggregated co-authorship relations in archaeological research outputs published between 2014 and 2021 Node ColourCluster ThemeExample Authors within Cluster Cluster 1 (234 authors) The Archaeology of Early Hominins (Europe) Andrews, P.J., Arsuaga, J.L., Bahain, J.-J., Bermudez de Castro, J., Blasco, R., Boeda, E., Carbonnell, E.

Authors have been grouped into 19 clusters using a minimum cluster size of 30 authors along with the 800 strongest links between them visible, using a clustering resolution of 2.00 and a threshold for inclusion set at 150 citations (Figure 3, Table 4). The most cited authors are researchers whose work relates to aspects of science in archaeology including absolute dating (Bronk-Ramsey, Reimer, Higham, Bard and Blackwell), the analysis of sediments and minerals (Goldberg, Weiner), the microscopic analysis of bones (Dominguez-Rodrigo), residue analysis (Evershed), stable isotopes (Hedges, M.P. Richards), proteins (Collins) and plant remains (Fuller). There are several frequently cited authors present whose work is not focused on archaeological material, but anthropology (Foucault, Ingold, Bourdieu and Latour). At a broad scale this map recognises a clear difference between researchers based on their temporal interests, and on whether their research focuses on the animate or the inanimate. To the far left we can see two major clusters of researchers looking at the record of the earliest hominins and pre-agricultural societies, with a distinction made between those working in Africa and those working elsewhere. To the right we can see researchers who consider settled societies and issues of the nature of social complexity, with a distinction drawn between scholars examining the Americas and others. We can also see distinct small clusters related to aspects of scientific research (luminescence dating, organic residues, DNA and ancientDNA, and human remains) and three clusters that possess a clear regional or time focus (China and the Far East, the Near East, and the colonisation of the Americas). The intellectual base of archaeology rests on the research of a number of authors who stopped publishing research some time before the period under analysis (Binford, Childe, J.D. Clark, Foucault). Remarkably, Binford remains the third most cited author after Bronk-Ramsey and Reimer. His location in the centre of the map reflects the number of citations received, since the mapping process of VOSviewer usually places the largest nodes in the centre. Relative to other prominent authors, this central placing also clearly captures the citation of Binford's work across a wide range of archaeological research including by scholars examining the archaeology of early hominins, by those exploring an evolutionary approach to human behaviour and finally by those examining the social and symbolic side of archaeology. Hodder and Dominguez-Rodrigo, however, are cited almost as often as Binford but are placed on opposite sides, reflecting their considerably more circumscribed citation catchments.\n\nTable 5: Clusters and example nodes in the network of collaboration between authors derived from aggregated co-authorship relations in archaeological research outputs published between 2004 and 2013 Node ColourCluster ThemeExample Authors within Cluster Cluster 1 (263 authors) The Archaeology of Early Hominins Behrensmeyer, A.K., Carbonnell, E.

There is a similar high-level structure in terms of timespan from research on earliest humans on the left to research examining later more complex societies on the right, and from chemical analysis of inanimate materials at the top to the analysis of animate evidence (bones, plant remains and DNA at the bottom). The increase in the number of documents published in archaeology and the number of references made has led to an increase in the citation threshold for inclusion in the map of cited authors. In 2004-2013 160 citations were needed for inclusion in the map; for 2014-2021, more than 300 citations are needed. Likewise, the highest number of citations received by any author has more than doubled from nearly 3000 to more than 7500.\n\n5.3 The conceptual language of archaeological research: NLP-extracted terms\n\nTable 6: Clusters and example nodes in the networks of NLP-extracted terms from archaeological research outputs published between 2014 and 2021 Cluster ColourCluster Theme: The Language of...Examples of Terms Within Cluster Cluster 1 (299 terms) Interpretation & Theory actor, agency, artist, capitalism, colonialism, concept, cultural history, dialogue, ethnicity, gender, hierarchy, ideology, materiality, narrative, nationalism, ontology, polity, power, prestige, science, social identity, social process, subjectivity, temporality, theory Cluster 2 (200 terms) The Classical & Historical Worlds acropolis, ancient world, architecture, basilica, Byzantine, cathedral, christianity, classical antiquity, construction phase, crypt, empire, epigraphy, Etruscan, forum, fresco, goddess, iconography, manuscript, monumentality, pilgrimage, public space, road, Roman Empire, textual source, urban space Cluster 3 (186 terms) Physical Landscapes, the Environment & Climate Change altitude, anthracology, arid environment, basin, biodiversity, climate change, deforestation, dendrochronology, erosion, firewood, forest, geoarchaeology, historical ecology, holocene, human impact, irrigation, landscape change, palaeoenvironmemt, sea level, sedimentation, terrace, vegetation change Cluster 4 (178 terms) Scientific Analysis of Artefacts & their Manufacture alloy, analytical study, bronze, calcite, chemical analysis, clay, cluster analysis, corrosion, craftsman, X-ray fluorescence, elemental analysis, firing temperature, geochemistry, glass, ice mass spectrometry, laboratory, microscopy, non-destructive technique, petrography, pottery, provenance, recycling, slag, workshop Cluster 5 (154 terms) Professional Practice & Heritage Management architectural heritage, audience, authenticity, citizen, cultural resource, developer, digital archaeology, expertise, field research, funding, government, guidance, heritage, infrastructure, legislation, museum, professional, public engagement, regulation, sustainability, tourism, world heritage Cluster 6 (148 terms) Survey, Mapping & Forms of Visualisation (esp. digital) 3D model, aerial photography, augmented reality, camera, cartography, digital elevation model, drawing, geographic information system, global positioning system, lidar, machine learning, photogrammetry, remote sensing, satellite imagery, unmanned aerial vehicle, virtual reality, wreck Cluster 7 (133 terms) Human evolution (species, cognition & technology) Acheulean, assemblage, biface, blank, bone tool, butchery, chaine operatoire, debitage, flake, formation process, functional analysis, geological context, Levallois, lithic artefact, lithic technology, Oldowan, palaeolithic, prey, sequence, site formation process, taphonomy, use wear Cluster 8 (125 terms) Domestication & Food Production of Plants and Animals agriculture, animal, anthropology, archaeobotany, cattle, crop, cultivation, domestication, economic system, farming, food production, harvest, hunter-gatherer, intensification, neolithic, phytolith, plant use, starch, subsistence, wild animal, wild plant Cluster 9 (111 terms) The Development of Social Complexity (esp. in Prehistory) 1st millenium bc, archaeological culture, arrowhead, bead, burial, cemetery, cremation, cultural contact, elite, figurine, grave, hill fort, hoard, kurgan, mirror, ornament, rank, ritual, Scythian, social complexity, social inequality, sword, symbolism, warrior, weapon Cluster 10 (103 terms) Human Remains, Forensics & Human Health adult, anatomy, ancient Egypt, bioarchaeology, body size, computed tomography, cranium, diagnosis, exhumation, forensic, fracture, geometric morphometric, health, infancy, inhumation, injury, juvenile, mass grave, mummy, palaeopathology, sexual dimorphism, tuberculosis, vertebra, victim\n\nInteractive maps:\n\nThe co-occurrence map of NLP-extracted terms from titles and abstracts contains more than 1900 terms grouped into 15 clusters, using a clustering resolution of 1.5 and a minimum cluster size of 30 terms (Figure 5, Table 6). The terms are arranged in a clear ring shape with terms related to archaeological interpretation and theory as the largest cluster situated on the lower left-hand side next to terms related to professional practice in archaeology and heritage management. If the term 'archaeology' is included it would be the largest node and located in cluster 1. Terms associated with survey, mapping and digital visualisation are also on this left-hand side, intermingled with terms related to the archaeology of the classical and historical worlds. On the right-hand side we can see clusters of terms related to the physical environment and climate intermingled with the conceptual language of the archaeology of early hominins. There is a clear cluster of terms related to the scientific analysis of archaeological artefacts. In the lower part of the map, we can see terms associated with the analysis of human remains and human health and the origins of domestication and food production, with a cluster related to genetics and ancient populations in between. Smaller clusters of terms related to absolute dating, the isotopic analysis of diet, the analysis of organic residues and geophysics are recognised but less visible. The low-density spread of terms in the centre of the map includes terms related to the study of social complexity and especially the analysis of finds from cemeteries. This map presents a very clear image of the extraordinary breadth of conceptual language that encompasses archaeological research today, as well as highlighting some of the clear distinctions that exist between the natural and built environments, the animate and the inanimate.\n\nTable 7: Clusters and example nodes in the networks of NLP-extracted terms from archaeological research outputs published between 2004 and 2013 Cluster Colour Cluster Theme: The Language of...Examples of Terms Within Cluster Cluster 1 (196 terms) Environmental Change (incl. dating & climate change) basin, climate, dating, climate change, correlation, deposit, holocene, layer, occurrence, radiocarbon date, rate, sediment, soil, transition Cluster 2 (194 terms) Theory & Interpretation agency, argument, anthropology, biography, concept, debate, discipline, historian, idea, life, materiality, material culture, meaning, narrative, notion, past, perspective, practice, story, theory, warfare, world Cluster 3 (190 terms) Chemical Characterisation & Provenancing of Artifacts ceramic, characterisation, clay, composition, concentration, determination, fragment, glass, manufacture, metal, object, pigment, pottery, provenance, sample, spectroscopy, technique, X-ray diffraction Cluster 4 (159 terms) Survey, Mapping & Visualisation of artefacts & Space accuracy, acquisition, application, detection, documentary, geographic information system, imagery, map, photogrammetry, photograph, procedure, remote sensing, representation, resolution, satellite imagery, science, solution, topic Cluster 5 (147 terms) The Classical World (incl.

The essential structure and shape of this map is the same as that discussed previously, though with some slight differences. On the right-hand side, the largest cluster of terms relates to the language of environmental change closely associated with the language of the impact of humans on plant communities. The language of stable isotopes is clearly visible and located close to the chemical analysis of artefacts. At the top there are four related clusters covering the languages of geophysics, survey, mapping and visualisation, preservation and cultural heritage and the built environment. The language of theory and interpretation, the classical world and social complexity are located close together to the left-hand side. Archaeology, if included, would be placed in the cluster of terms related to interpretation and theory. The centre of the ring contains more terms across a range of clusters. While the essential pattern remains the same between early and later periods, we can see some subtle developments through time. Research in the classical and historical worlds now embraces survey, geophysics and digital visualisation (digital photography, 3-D modelling and unmanned aerial survey work) in 2014 to 2021, where text was a central concern in 2004 to 2013. Genetic analysis is present across both periods but has changed from a focus on the biological changes that characterise domestication to understanding human populations, perhaps reflecting the significant change in the availability of ancientDNA data for multiple human individuals and the use of these data to address long-standing research questions about the movement of human populations (Kristiansen 2014).\n\n5.4 The conceptual language of archaeological research: author keywords\n\nTable 8: Clusters and example nodes for the co-citation map of author keywords referenced in archaeological research outputs published between 2014 and 2021 Cluster Colour Cluster Theme: The Language of...

At first sight this is a very different science map to the map of extracted terms; all the terms are mapped into one dense concentration in contrast to the clear ring shape of the map of extracted terms. A closer look, however, reveals stronger similarities with the basic structure of terms remaining the same. Terms associated with interpretation and theory, heritage, survey, mapping and visualisation and the classical and historical worlds are to the left-hand side, while terms associated with the scientific analysis of artefacts, environmental science, human evolution and domestication are on the right. The top of the map contains terms that are about the analysis of artefacts, while the bottom contains the terms associated with the animate world. Most of the same terms are present and clustered into similar groupings to the map of extracted terms.\n\nTable 9: Clusters and example nodes for the co-citation map of author keywords referenced in archaeological research outputs published between 2004 and 2013 Cluster Colour Cluster Theme: The Language of...

The map presents 1200 keywords grouped into 17 clusters using a clustering resolution of 1.8, a minimum cluster size of 30 items and a threshold for inclusion of 30 occurrences (Figure 8, Table 9). The same single concentration of terms is present, along with the distinction being drawn between the language of interpretation and theory and the classical worlds and environments, domestication and early hominins on the other. The language of scientific analysis of artefacts and of diet with stable isotopes is placed close together at the top. The language of genetic analysis is still present, and still associated with studies of domestication, though there is less of it.\n\n5.5 Collaborative networks in archaeological research: co-authors\n\nInteractive maps:\n\nThe science map of co-authorship for the period 2014-2021 (Figure 9) presents nearly 1500 authors. The nodes in this map are not clustered because the number of clusters generated varies enormously, with just a small change to the clustering resolution and/or a change to the minimum number of individuals within a cluster. Indeed, at any clustering resolution above 1.0 the number of clusters is greater than the number of colours that can normally be assigned to clusters by VOSviewer. The same problem exists for the map of co-authors for the earlier period 2004-2013 (Figure 10), which presents approximately 1400 co-authors. Both maps present a single, very large concentration of co-authors in the centre along with a series of separate co-author clusters tightly networked together but separated from the main concentration. Within the main concentration, individuals demonstrate a wide series of co-author relationships; in 2014-2021, examples of such widely connected individuals include Bahain, J.-J., Boivin, N.L., Chen, F., Collins, M.J., Dominguez-Rodrigo, M., Higham, T.F.G, McPherron, S.J.P, Moncel, M.H. and Petraglia, M.D. A noticeable feature of the maps of co-authors for both 2004-2013 and 2014-2021 is the presence of a distinct, large cluster of Chinese authors to be found in the top left-hand side of both maps. This group of co-authors was not evident in the co-citation map of authors created form the WoS data for the earlier study (Sinclair 2016) but, as noted above, since the publication of that study WoS has started a specific Chinese Citation Index, and Scopus will have increased its indexing of Chinese research.\n\n5.6 Collaborative networks in archaeological research: co-authorship between institutions\n\nTable 10: Clusters and example nodes in the network of collaboration between institutions derived from aggregated co-authorship relations in archaeological research outputs published between 2014 and 2021 Cluster ColourExamples of Universities & Institutions Cluster 1 (35 items) Oxford, York, Durham, Leicester, Queensland, Sheffield, Wollongong, Bristol, Flinders, Edinburgh, Historic England, British Geological Survey, Vrije - Amsterdam, National Museum of Australia Cluster 2 (35 items) Arizona, Pennsylvania-State, Aberdeen, New Mexico, Oregon, Washington-State, California - Santa-Barbara, Oklahoma, Notre-Dame, Santa-Fe Institute, Crow Canyon Archaeology Center, American Museum of Natural History Cluster 3 (33 items) Cambridge, Missouri, Southern Methodist, Aarhus, Washington - St. Louis, Copenhagen, Cleveland Museum of Natural History, Tulsa, Auckland, Neanderthal Museum, MR Ltd Auckland Cluster 4 (33 items) Chinese Academy Sciences - Beijing, IAE - Novosibirisk, Peking, Stanford, Novosibirisk-State, Natural History Museum - London, National Museum - Denmark Cluster 5 (32 items) Max Planck - Institute for the Study of Human History, Witwatersrand, Australian National University, Sydney, Otago, Michigan, Bologna, Oslo, Pisa Cluster 6 (28 items) Haifa, Simon-Fraser, Tel Aviv, Hebrew, Israel Antiquities Authority, British Colombia, Alberta, Dublin, Sapienza, Utah, Geological Survey Israel Cluster 7 (26 items) Max Planck - International Energy Agency, Harvard, Toronto, Cape Town, Smithsonian, Tubing, Pennsylvania, Colorado - Boulder, Boston, Stony Brook, Eberhard Karls, Johannesburg Cluster 8 (25 items) UCL-Institute of Archaeology, Rovira-Virgili, IPHES-Taragona, Complutense-Madrid, IRCEA-Barcelona, CENIEH-Burgos, Reading, Southampton, Liverpool Cluster 9 (22 items) Brown, Georgia, Trent, Cincinnati, McMaster, Tulane, Cornell, George Mason, South Carolina, Kentucky, Central-Florida Cluster 10 (19 items) Russian Academy of Sciences-Moscow, Leiden, Calgary, Exeter, Helsinki, Stockholm, Gothenburg, Lund, Groningen, Vanderbilt Cluster 11 (14 items) California - Berkeley, Warsaw, Polish Academy of Sciences - Krakow, La Trobe, Texas-Austin, Tehran, Tokyo, Polish Academy of Sciences - Warsaw Cluster 12 (13 items) Florida, Glasgow, Uppsala, Yale, Chicago, Maryland, Dartmouth, Rice, Victoria, DePaul\n\nInteractive maps:\n\nThe map of collaborating institutions presents 315 institutions, grouped into 12 clusters using a clustering resolution of 1.8, a minimum cluster size of ten institutions, and a threshold of five published documents (Figure 11, Table 10). There is a single concentration of institutions in the centre of the map with a series of smaller concentrations of institutions around it. Some of these smaller concentrations have a clear national focus, identifiable as indicated in the screenshot. The number and composition of clusters of institutions in this map is sensitive to change, with changes in the clustering resolution. It is noticeable, however, that, with the exception of cluster 9, whose institutions are primarily based in North America, no cluster has a specifically regional or national identity. There are also institutions based in all geographical regions that demonstrate a very wide range of collaborative links. Examples include Cambridge, Durham, the Institute of Archaeology, Oxford and York in the UK, the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing, the Max Planck Institutes, the Australian National University and the University of Queensland in Australia, Harvard in the USA, and the University of the Witwatersrand in South Africa. The map for 2004-2013 contains 248 institutions grouped into 9 clusters with a clustering resolution of 1.0 and a minimum cluster size of 15 institutions (Figure 12, Table 11). The threshold for inclusion is the publication of five documents. Most of the same institutions are visible in both maps, but there is a striking difference in the overall shape of the map through time. The single dense concentration of institutions in the later period has developed out of two clear concentrations, with a primarily North American concentration to the left, and concentration of institutions from the UK and Australia to the right. Between these two there is a small grouping of institutions based in Israel and two small concentrations from Spain and China in the upper half of the map. Through time, archaeological research, where it requires collaboration, has become a fundamentally international activity no matter where researchers are based.\n\nTable 11: Clusters and example nodes in the network of collaboration between institutions derived from aggregated co-authorship relations in archaeological research outputs published between 2004 and 2013 Cluster ColourExamples of Universities & Institutions Cluster 1 (45 items) Arizona-State, Florida, Haifa, Harvard, Institute-Archaeology, Simon Fraser, Royal-Holloway, Smithsonian, Washington Cluster 2 (39 items) Arizona, California-Santa-Barbara, Colorado-Boulder, Leiden, Oregon, Pennsylvania-State, Southern-Methodist, Stony-Brook Cluster 3 (34 items) Aberdeen, Bradford, Bristol, Cambridge, Durham, Leicester, Oxford, natural-History-Museum-London, Sheffield Cluster 4 (25 items) Chicago, Florida-State, Maryland, Ohio-State, Reading, Texas-Austin, Washington-St-Louis Cluster 5 (25 items) British-Columbia, California-Davis, Minnesota, Missouri, New-Mexico, Pittsburgh, Trinity-College Cluster 6 (23 items) Australian-National, Monash, Queensland, Sydney, Witwatersrand, Wollongong, York Cluster 7 (22 items) Boston, Cape-Town, Complutense-Madrid, Max-Planck-IEA, Rovira-Vigli, Toronto, Wisconsin-Madison Cluster 8 (18 items) Berkeley, Berkeley-GeoChron-Center, CAS-Beijing, George-Washington, Peking Cluster 9 (17 items) Auckland, California-Berkeley, Santa-Fe-Institute, Southampton, Stanford, Washington-State\n\n6. The Shape of Archaeology 2004 to 2021\n\nScience mapping and scientometrics more generally offer incredible opportunities for detailed exploration of a discipline, but to make a genuinely valuable contribution they must offer some insight that is not easily achieved by other means. In the final sections below three such aspects will be discussed. The first considers the rate and manner of growth of archaeology as a discipline. The second continues an examination of diversity in the authorship of the most cited knowledge claims. Discussion ends with a consideration of the nature of language use in the discipline. In all cases, it is the opportunities raised by a perspective of the discipline as a whole that is important.\n\n6.1 The growth of archaeological research\n\nScopus data reveal that there has been a clear and steady increase in the number of archaeological research documents published each year since 1960 (Figure 13). A possible slight plateau is visible for the last four years along with a slight decrease in the number of documents published in 2021, but not sufficiently different to confirm any impact related to COVID-19 - yet. Derek Price, a pioneer of scientometrics, argued that, over the long term, scientific research grew at a quasi-exponential rate based on journal and document numbers as a proxy measure (Price 1961; 1963). Considering the number of archaeological outputs published by year as a cumulative total (Figure 14) there has been an extraordinary increase in the corpus of academic research published since 1960. Previously it was argued that the cumulative total of archaeological outputs doubled approximately every seven years (Sinclair 2016 box 1); the addition of more recent data indicates that this cumulative rate of increase has not changed. However, we might want to examine this growth in more detail and consider its impact upon how scholars draw on the increasing corpus of knowledge claims available to them. This is possible by looking at variations in the growth of types of documents, the rate of growth of archaeology in relation to other areas of science, and the nature of citation back to the accumulated corpus of work.\n\nGrowth in archaeological research outputs clearly varies by document type (Figure 15). Since 2004, articles published in journals have more than tripled in number. There is also an increase in the number of books, book chapters and conference/proceedings papers published, but it varies from year to year. This difference in growth between document types may result from several factors including the length of time necessary to write or edit books, a practical limit to the number of books that can be published in any year, and possibly choices made by the citation indices in the indexing process â especially for books.
