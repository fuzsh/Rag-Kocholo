In the words of archaeologist David Hurst Thomas: \"it's not what you find, it's what you find out.\"\n\nWhy Study the Past?\n\nTo be human is to be curious, questioning, and inquisitive. We know that our ancient ancestors looked to nature with wonder. They experienced fear as the sun disappeared during solar eclipses and joy at its return. They saw cycles of births and deaths, seasons and years, and for all these events they sought explanation and meaning. The search for and discovery of explanations and meaning contributed to the development of human culture. Culture is the shared body of acquired knowledge that humans live by and pass on to each generation. Human curiosity and ingenuity have allowed cultures to evolve and flourish almost everywhere on the earth."
