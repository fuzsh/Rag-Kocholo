        "text": "Ricardo Bofill Abroad: The International Projection of the Taller de Arquitectura.\n\nFollowing Ricardo Bofill’s passing in 2022, the aim of issue 15 of Histories of Post-War Architecture Journal is to analyse the international trajectory of the Taller de Arquitectura (RBTA) from 1970 to the present day. This will be achieved through a critical, up-to-date approach. The architectural output of Ricardo Bofill outside Spain is the subject of a case study that aims to contribute to academic and public debate. Bofill’s work is cross-cutting, bold, and polemic, making him a controversial yet indispensable figure in the recent history of international architecture.\n\nThe following are potential areas of research that can be explored without limitations:\n\n- RBTA beyond Spain: relations between Spanish and international works.\n\n- The reception of the work of RBTA in international mass media.\n\n- The “French Years” of RBTA: between urban planning, political management and relations with power.\n\n- The international networks of members of the Taller’s professional team.\n\nPapers should be submitted in English using https://hpa.unibo.it/user/register\n\nThe guidelines for paper submission are available at https://hpa.unibo.it/about/submissions#authorGuidelines\n\nPlease, send your full-paper proposals (20,000 and 25,000 characters with up to six images) before December 31, 2024.\n\nHPA also looks for contributions for the review section: https://hpa.unibo.it/about#sectionPolicy\n\nTo address questions to the editors: redazione.hpa unibo.it\n\nAuthors must submit directly full papers by December 31, 2024\n\nAccepted authors will be notified by February 28, 2025\n\nPublication is expected to be in June 2025\n\nThis Call for Papers is promoted by the research project RETRANSLATES01. Reflections, from Europe, on architecture in Spain: urban projects, public facilities, design and interventions in heritage (1976-2006), PID2022-138760NB-C21 funded by MCIN /AEI/10.13039/501100011033 DOI/ FEDER, EU."
