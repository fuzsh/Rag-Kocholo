        "text": "Attractive, controversial, admired and inimitable, Ricardo Bofill was the world's first star of Spanish architecture. Because of his brilliant conception of architecture and his legendary career, Kronos Homes commissioned some of his most emblematic projects. If you are not familiar with this universal Catalan, here we review the career of a unique and unrepeatable character.\n\nRicardo Bofill, the blood ties of architecture\n\nSon of the architect Emilio Bofill and the Venetian Maria Levi, Ricardo Bofill was born on 5 December 1939 in Barcelona and trained at the Barcelona School of Architecture and at the School of Architecture in Geneva (Switzerland).\n\nIn 1963 he formed a multidisciplinary group made up of the most diverse profiles (architects, philosophers, engineers, poets, sociologists...), which laid the foundations of the mythical Taller de Arquitectura (RBTA). From there, his singular vision of urban planning soon materialised in projects such as the flat block on Calle Nicaragua in Barcelona (1965), the Gaudí neighbourhood in Reus (1968) and La Muralla Roja in Calpe (1973). His sister, Anna Bofill, even participated in the design of iconic buildings, such as Walden 7 in Sant Just Desvern (1975).\n\nAfter those beginnings in our country, at the end of the 1970s, Bofill opened a studio in Paris. In neighbouring France he was involved in numerous works, from the urban neighbourhood of Les Arcades du Lac (1982), on the outskirts of the French capital, to the Antigone neighbourhood in Montpellier (1999). However, Bofill's work was not limited to Spain and France. The architect left his mark all over the world: he was just as likely to design an office building in Moscow as in Chicago.\n\nIn Spain, his latest creations include the National Theatre of Catalonia in Barcelona (1997), the Miguel Delibes Cultural Centre in Valladolid (2007), the Exhibition and Conference Centre in La Coruña (2003), and the hotel popularly known as the Hotel Vela in Barcelona (2009).\n\nIn short, the architect stood out for a truly prolific work that has been continued by his sons: Ricardo Bofill Jr. and Pablo Bofill, currently in charge of the Taller de Arquitectura.\n\nDeath of Ricardo Bofill\n\nOn 14 January 2022, Ricardo Bofill died of COVID-19. The 82-year-old architect was unable to survive the complications of the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. Reactions to his death were swift. Among them, those of another star of Spanish architecture: Rafael de La-Hoz. \"When Bofill burst onto the scene in Spain, so young, he represented a gleam, a flash, an electric shock for the things he did and told us about. And for the way he worked,\" he said in the film El sentido de la arquitectura produced by Kronos Homes.\n\nThe legacy of Ricardo Bofill Jr.\n\nToday, the family business is run by his sons Ricardo and Pablo. The former, the fruit of the architect's relationship with the Italian actress Serena Vergano, was born in Barcelona in 1965 and in his youth gained notoriety when he married Chábeli Iglesias. His marriage to Julio Iglesias' daughter lasted barely three years. He was later romantically linked to Mexican singer Paulina Rubio.\n\nFor a time, Ricardo Bofill Jr. became a very popular media personality. A regular on television and in the tabloids, he published several books and directed films. Now, after deciding that he \"wanted to put an end to that\" in order to forge a \"serious career\", he is focusing on his work as an architect.\n\nAs for his brother Pablo Bofill (1980), originally from Paris, he is the son of the multifaceted French artist Anabelle d'Huart, with whom his father had both a sentimental and professional relationship.\n\nThe works of Ricardo Bofill\n\nTo speak of Ricardo Bofill's works is to speak of an immense portfolio. \"I have done about a thousand projects, I have worked in many countries and I have built in many cities\", he said in El sentido de la arquitectura.\n\nAmong others, these are some of the most outstanding projects led by the Barcelona architect:\n\nNicaragua Apartments. Barcelona (1965).\n\nGaudí Quarter. Reus (1968).\n\nCity in Space. Madrid (1970).\n\nXanadu Apartments. Alicante (1971).\n\nLa Petite Cathédrale, Cergy-Pontoise (1971).\n\nThe Red Wall.

He contributed to making them more sustainable and habitable by creating green spaces such as the Turia Garden (Valencia), the Riouxa Park (Vigo) and the Manzanares Park (Madrid).\n\nIn short, a great oeuvre that is embodied in books such as Visions of architecture. A definitive volume that reviews his works and his particular interpretation of architecture."
