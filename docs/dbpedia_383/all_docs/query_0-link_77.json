        "text": "Three historic portraits of the great Spanish architect Ricardo Bofill, posted on the Instagram feed of his studio Ricardo Bofill Taller de Arquitectura (RBTA), announced to the world his death today, 14 January 2022, at the age of 83.\n\nBorn in Barcelona in December 1939, the legendary architect began his career studying at an architecture school in Barcelona. In an early show of the political leanings that would later define much of his work, he was kicked out for opposing Franco’s dictatorship, before moving to continue his studies at the Geneva University of Art and Design in Switzerland.\n\nIn 1963 he founded RBTA (at the age of just 23) and quickly became known for his projects that became known for their scale, complexity and optimism. One of his early works, La Muralla Roja, a postmodernist seaside fortress containing 50 homes on the cliff’s of Spain’s Costa Brava, set out the radical style that would define his career.\n\nLater projects, such as the Walden 7 in Catalonia and Les Espaces d'Abraxas housing complex near Paris (so striking it was chosen as the backdrop for scenes in dystopian film franchise The Hunger Games) would continue Bofill’s interest in creating unique public housing.\n\nHis own home and studio La Fábrica, located just outside Barcelona, is no less groundbreaking. A former cement factory, the property retains its industrial majesty – he once described it as being ‘something halfway between a ruin and a cloister’.\n\nMore recent work, such as the sail-shaped W Hotel in Barcelona, completed in 2009, and the Mohammed VI Polytechnic University in Morocco, opened in 2016, showed a continued desire to push the boundaries of architecture.\n\nBofill leaves behind two sons, Ricardo Emilio Bofill and Pablo Bofill, both of whom have worked at Ricardo Bofill Taller de Arquitectura."
