In the sequel, “Manon des sources,” Jean de Florette’s daughter Manon seeks revenge for her father after discovering the water source. This moving story is a diamond of French culture and will give you a glimpse of some regional variations in the French language, vocabulary and accent.

This timeless short film weaves its spell with simplicity and captivating visual storytelling. In the bustling streets of Paris, a young boy named Pascal stumbles upon a mystical red balloon on his way to school. The balloon seems to have a life of its own, following him through the city streets and becoming his faithful companion through challenges and obstacles.

The French characters in the film will stop at nothing (despite sometimes lacking in motivation and conviction) to help the American and English soldiers that have parachuted into Paris and must get south and out of the German-occupied part of the country.

The movie plays on stereotypes and clichés, making it a gem of cultural insight. You’ll learn a lot from the characterizations of the different nationalities and the interactions between them, though perhaps considerably less about how to be inconspicuous in an occupied war zone!

Before “Glee” started filling up high school choir rooms with burgeoning stars, “Les Choristes” captured the hearts of the French. It’s the timeless tale of the arrival of a new teacher at a remote boys’ school in post-WWII France.

With disciplinary problems rampant, and the policies of the strict, old-fashioned headmaster not helping, Monsieur Mathieu decides to introduce choral singing as a way to bridge the gap with his students. The songs from Les Choristes will stick with you, and you might even be tempted to download the soundtrack to sing along yourself!

Through a gentle and patient approach, Lopez imparts not only academic knowledge but also life lessons and values. The film beautifully captures the daily routines, challenges and joys of both the teacher and his students.

In the numerous lessons that Georges gives his children, it’s easy to comprehend and learn tidbits about the French language. The movie also offers an interesting view of the French schooling system.

10. “Le vent se lève” (“The Wind Rises”)

Year Released: 2013

Genre: Animated Drama

While not strictly a French film, Hiyao Miyazaki’s “The Wind Rises” enjoyed a French language release with widespread acclaim. Telling the story of aero engineer Jiro Horikoshi, the film plays out the airplane designer’s life and influence on Japanese fighter planes.

As with all Miyazaki films, the narrative is engaging from the start, and the dialogue is very easy to follow. The characters in the film quote the same piece of French poetry throughout, and it’s a fun way to get a peek at the world of creative French without getting confused.

11. “Le roi et l’oiseau” (“The King and the Mockingbird”)

Year Released: 1980Genre: Animated Fairytale

He manages to trap and cage a bird (oiseau) in his castle. Soon, paintings start coming to life and strange creatures make themselves known.

Like many other animations, the film balances dialogue and physical comedy very well, making it perfect for beginners to follow. The events on screen are a bit strange, but with the help of the dialogue, it’s not hard to get your bearings.

12. “La gloire de mon père” (“My Father’s Glory”)

Year Released: 1990

Genre: Drama/Biography/Adventure

Adapted from the novel by Marcel Pagnol, “La gloire de mon père” is a classic French tale and a great way into rural French history. The film follows the fate of a family and village in the heart of a farming community during the early 20th century. Largely a family drama, the movie is a great example of more traditional conversation, presented in an easy-to-digest manner.

If you enjoy this film or “Jean de Florette” (#3 on this list) and its sequel, check out “Le château de ma mère,” another film adapted from a Marcel Pagnol novel.

13. “La marche de l’empereur” (“March of the Penguins”)

Year Released: 2005

Genre: Documentary

This is a very common French movie recommendation because it’s frankly really good. It’s very different than the well-known English version with a voice-over by Morgan Freeman. This one is the original, and it provides a unique viewing experience.

In this version, the penguins themselves narrate, with voice-over actors speaking as the mother, father and infant birds. It has everything a French learner needs: a relatively simple story, clear narration and one voice at a time. You can spend some time with each narrator, letting your ears get used to it.

14. “Kirikou et la sorcière” (“Kirikou and the Sorceress”)

Year Released: 1998

Successful enough to spawn two sequels, Kirikou has a simple plot and dialogue but draws on a setting and mythology that are rich enough to hold your interest. The film also offers a great insight into the African-French accent.

15. “Le jouet” (“The Toy”)

Year Released: 1976

Genre: Drama/Comedy

This delightful French comedy film revolves around François Perrin, a struggling journalist who takes a temporary job as a plaything for a wealthy industrialist’s young son, Eric. The film humorously explores the social and class differences between François, who’s treated like a toy, and the boy’s father, Pierre, portrayed by comedy legend Louis de Funès.

The film offers both laughs and social commentary, making it a timeless classic of French cinema. Although some of the speech is a bit fast at times, the context of the scene can assist in your understanding.

16. “Un air de famille” (“Family Resemblances”)

Year Released: 1996

Genre: Drama/Comedy

If you want to find out what French family life is like, then you might want to take a look at this film by Cédric Klapisch. The film portrays a dysfunctional family gathering at a local café to celebrate a birthday.

As the evening progresses, old wounds, secrets and familial tensions come to the surface. The characters, brilliantly portrayed by a talented ensemble cast, navigate their complex relationships with humor and pathos. The dialogue in the film is very easy to follow as long as you’re prepared to listen to an argument or two.

Suddenly, she’s faced with a big dilemma: should she chase her dream of becoming a professional singer or stay back to support her family’s farm? It’s a journey of self-discovery and tough choices, as Paula finds herself torn between her passion and her responsibilities.

19. “Jour de fête” (festival day)

Year Released: 1949

Genre: Comedy

French mime, actor and filmmaker Jacques Tati is like France’s version of Mister Bean. Tati’s “Jour de fête”is set in a small French village and takes place leading up to and during the yearly town fête (festival). Tati plays the village postman who gets into more than his fair share of tumbles.

The film uses a lot of physical comedy, which makes for clear and simple language. The combination of physical action and exclamative speech makes the plot very easy to follow, even for beginner French learners.

But when the moon rises, Dino transforms into his trusty alter ego: Nico, a masterful burglar. Hold on tight as the film takes you on a thrilling and humorous escapade, scaling Parisian rooftops, delving into art heists and forming unexpected alliances.

23. “L’arnacoeur” (“Heartbreaker”)

Year Released: 2010

Genre: Romantic Comedy

“L’arnacoeur” is a light, heart-warming film starring Vanessa Paradis and Romain Duris. It follows the standard rom-com formula so the story is easy to follow, but there’s an interesting twist that will keep you hooked.

The film is incredibly entertaining, engaging and interesting to watch. While the dialogue does run away with itself a little from time to time, the narrative is perfectly easy to follow.

Tips for Using French Movies to Learn French

Before you embark on your French cinematic odyssey, here are a few pointers to make your viewing a little more enjoyable (and effective):

Subtitles are your friend. If you need to, set the subtitles to French while you watch the film. Getting accustomed to the French accent can be challenging at first, so the subtitles will greatly aid your comprehension. Think of it as a fun way to improve your listening and reading skills simultaneously.

Rewind, rewind, rewind. If you need to go back and take things in again, go for it! While you might not have the same option in real life, it’s good to take advantage of this feature when watching films.

Take notes as you watch. If there are any new words that you hear a lot, or that are necessary to understand the plot, try and jot them down as you go. Google is great at deciphering rough spellings in a foreign language, so don’t worry about getting it wrong—though here’s another reason why French subtitles are useful.

Make it your routine. Watching a film in French is a really wonderful accomplishment, but if you really want to get better, you’ve got to do it regularly. Set aside one day every week when you’ll watch a movie in French. It can replace an evening in which you would normally watch something in your native language.

Film and TV are treasure troves of authentic French lessons. For one example, check out the video below to learn grammar, pronouns and other key French language components from the film “C’est Tout Pour Moi”:

There are a huge number of French films out there that you can use to learn the language.
