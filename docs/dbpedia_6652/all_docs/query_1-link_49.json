        "text": "“I chose this course to get a better understanding of something I feel so passionately about. I have always loved film and television, but more often than not I had a very onedimensional outlook on the things I was watching seeing them just as forms of entertainment. With this course my perspective completely changed. I now see how important media is at representing and creating culture. The historical perspective and understanding you gain is also something I didn’t expect. Through the wide and varied catalogue of films and shows you interact with, you can broaden your horizons tenfold, whether it be culturally, historically or theoretically. You will learn about culture and more specifically, how media is a significant tool in understanding it.”\n\nJack Fleming, Student"
