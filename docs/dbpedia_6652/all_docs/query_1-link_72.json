Retrieved 1 May 2021\n\nNational cinema\n\nAn influential organizing principle in film studies, locating films and cinemas within their national contexts and/or treating a country’s cinematic output as a distinct object of study. There are two underlying assumptions: firstly, that films produced within a particular national context will display some distillation of the historical, social, and political culture of that country; and secondly, that cinema (as one aspect of popular culture) plays a role in the construction of national identity. Until the 1980s, studies of national cinemas for the most part tended either to record histories of filmmaking in different countries; to document—and often to celebrate—the work of key auteur-directors whose films could be grounded within a particular national milieu; and/or to focus on a canon of ‘great’ films putatively embodying a national spirit. Ingmar Bergman’s films, for example, have been seen as coterminous with the cinema of Sweden, or at least as expressing something fundamental about the Swedish national character. Alternatively, particular themes, film styles, and genres have been read as in some sense ‘national’: the western in the US, for example; or cinéma vérité in France. Studies of national cinemas have also charted the ways in which cinema has been used purposefully as a means of consolidating—and even as constructing—national identities following independence struggles and decolonization (see Africa, film in; Arab cinema; postcolonialism) or social upheavals and revolutionary changes, as for example in Cuba and Iran. ..."
