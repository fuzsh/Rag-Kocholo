        "text": "No one knows those technicolor feelings of a first love (and a first heartbreak) like the teenagers in teen romance movies. It’s a genre that never gets old because no matter your age, we can all remember and relate to those messy feelings of figuring yourself out and figuring out how to love someone else — if only for a while — at the same time.\n\nTeenage romance movies, like high school movies writ large, may have earned a bad reputation for being silly. And sometimes, they are (to which we say: so what?). At their core, though, the best teen movies represent the variety of experiences that come from discovering yourself (and others) at this age. And thankfully, as Hollywood changes for the better, there’s even more diversity to come from teen romance movies. Ideas around who’s considered to be leading character-worthy or who gets to be a love interest are (finally) changing, and we feel secure enough to say there are both teen rom-coms and tissue-worthy romantic teen movies for everyone today.\n\nBelow, we’ve put together a mix of recent romantic teenage movies that are well worth a stream as well as some of the best teen-focused love story movies to pass the test of time. Consider this the start of your ultimate young-love movie marathon.\n\n1. 10 Things I Hate About You (1999)\n\nArguably the best subgenre of teenage rom-coms is inspired by classics, and as far as that goes, 10 Things I Hate About You has it all. Inspired by Shakespeare’s Taming Of The Shrew, the plot follows bad boy Patrick Verona (Heath Ledger)'s attempt to win a bet by convincing undateable Kat Stratford (Julia Stiles, for not the last time on this teen movies list) to give him a chance. It has enemies-to-lovers, charming side characters, and most importantly, the line: “I guess in this society, being male and an asshole makes you worthy of our time.” It still, and we’re pretty sure always will, holds up.\n\nStream it on Hulu, Fandango At Home, Amazon Prime, or Disney+.\n\n2. Easy A (2010)\n\nAdmittedly, there’s a lot about this movie that feels dated between the undertones of homophobia and performative feminism, but at the time of its release, it actually was pretty sexually liberating. A lot of people needed to hear being slut-shamed in high school is, in fact, something you get over. Stanley Tucci and Patricia Clarkson are so endearing as her parents, and if you’ve never seen the iconic “Pocketful Of Sunshine” scene, you should watch it for that alone.\n\nStream it on Apple TV, Amazon Prime, or Google Play.\n\n3. Rye Lane (2023)\n\nIf you're a fan of classic rom-coms like Notting Hill or Love, Actually, then you have to watch Rye Lane. It made our list of most best 2023 Sundance premieres for good reason. It's a love story in all of its dreamy, messy, magnetic glory. Plus, the chemistry between leads David Jonsson and Vivian Oparah cannot be denied.\n\nStream it on Hulu.\n\n4. Lisa Frankenstein (2024)\n\nWho says irreverent and downright-ridiculous movies can’t also make you feel something? With a delightfully ‘80s soundtrack and a closet full of costumes Helena Bonham Carter could shop from, this quirky horror-comedy is oddly endearing. It’s got a genuinely sweet love story between Lisa (Kathryn Newton) and the Victorian-era corpse she accidentally reanimates (Cole Sprouse), and it manages to make a nostalgic nod back to high school love stories of yore without that nostalgia feeling gratuitous or gimmicky. In short, it’s a lot of fun, and among new teen romance movies, it’s worth a watch.\n\nStream it on Amazon Prime, Apple TV, or Google Play.\n\n5. Clueless (1995)\n\nAnyone that grew up in the ‘90s with this movie will tell you that Cher’s outfit-building computer is something they probably still dream about to this day. The movie itself is plenty funny and charming, and the romance aspect — to our point about riffing off the classics earlier — borrows from Jane Austen’s Emma to cute effect. As one reviewer on Letterboxd called it, Clueless is “cinematic comfort food.”\n\nStream it on Paramount+, Apple TV, or Amazon Prime.\n\n6. John Tucker Must Die (2006)\n\nWe support women’s rights, but more importantly, we support women’s wrongs — isn’t that how that meme goes? We’re not saying revenge is the best course of action in any given situation, but where this movie is concerned? Kind of. It’s got romance, but it also has girls supporting girls, and that’s the real love of this movie.\n\nStream it on Hulu, Apple TV, Amazon Prime, or Google Play.\n\n7. She’s the Man (2006)\n\nWe wanted this to be gayer. You’ll probably want this to be gayer. Frankly, even the Shakespeare play it was based on is gayer. But this movie is still an icon of the genre and definitely worth a watch. And if it doesn’t have you quoting “girls with asses like mine do not talk to boys with faces like yours” for the rest of time… are you okay?\n\nStream it on Tubi, Apple TV, Fandango At Home, or Amazon Prime.\n\n10. She’s All That (1999)\n\nThis is 10 Things I Hate About You meets A Walk To Remember — a similar bet situation, except he’s the popular guy and she’s the nerdy girl — but the ending won't make you sad. It's a fun time, and Matthew Lillard is a hidden gem – between Freddie, him, and a Sarah Michelle Gellar cameo, it almost feels like a little Scooby Doo reunion. (But if you want to cringe a whole lot more, watch the gender-bent remake He’s All That on Netflix.)\n\nStream it on Hulu, Amazon Prime, or Paramount+.\n\n11. Warm Bodies (2013)\n\nSo maybe a zombie movie isn’t exactly what you’d picture in a list of rom-com movies for teens, but that’s exactly why we’re including it. Not only does it (a bit ironically) breathe new life into both genres, it’s actually genuinely charming and funny to watch.\n\nStream it on Hulu, Amazon Prime, or Apple TV.\n\n12. A Cinderella Story (2004)\n\nAs far as fairytale retellings go, this one is especially worth a watch. Sure, it has some “I’m not like other girls” vibes, but it also has Jennifer Coolidge being an absolute icon, so we think it evens out? That and Hilary Duff’s speech about waiting for rain in a drought make it worth the watch.\n\nStream it on Amazon Prime, Fandango At Home, or Apple TV.\n\n13. To All The Boys I’ve Loved Before (2018)\n\nDiversity in film is so important, and this movie (and the book series that inspired it) definitely has had a major impact on the industry in that regard. But To All the Boys is also a vital addition to the teen romance movies canon — the story is extremely heartwarming, the relationships are all pretty healthy and no less compelling for it, and the sisterly bond between the Covey sisters alone is worth watching it for, romance aside. Make it a whole marathon with the full trilogy and see why To All the Boys so quickly earned its place as one of the best romantic comedies of all time. (Are we exaggerating? We honestly don’t think so.)\n\nStream it on Netflix.\n\n18. Grease (1978)\n\nWe can’t make a list of teen rom-coms and not include the original blueprint! Sure, none of the cast looks like teenagers (because they weren’t, but are we surprised?), but there’s a reason this movie is still so widely known today. If you’ve never seen it, definitely put it on your watchlist.\n\nStream it on Hulu, Apple TV, Fandango At Home, or Amazon Prime.\n\n19. Save The Last Dance (2001)\n\nFirst, a fun fact: Julia Stiles got her role in Save The Last Dance after the director saw her 10 Things I Hate About You table-dance. (It’s a small world for teen romance movies, apparently!) Second and more importantly: This movie’s treatment of its central interracial relationship (between Stiles’ Sara and Sean Patrick Thomas’s Derek) carries a bit of a mixed legacy. Some applaud the movie for calling out harmful white-girl behavior — as Chenille (Kerry Washington) does in a memorable monologue — while others say it feeds into “bitter Black woman” tropes and ultimately still rewards whiteness. (If you remember Sara’s high-stakes dance sequence with The Chair, you know what we mean.) Still, for its time, Save The Last Dance said things about interracial relationships, racism, and classism that most other teen movies weren’t saying.\n\nStream it on Amazon Prime, Apple TV, or Google Play.\n\n20. Love, Simon (2018)\n\nSpeaking of representation, Love, Simon excels in telling a gay romance story that, while touching on some traumatic aspects of the LGBTQIA+ experience, never lets the trauma be the center of its story. Not only that, but it’s genuinely a romance and doesn’t end with the protagonist destroyed by circumstances at the end. Cute, cliché in the best way, and certainly worth watching!\n\nStream it on Amazon Prime, Fandango At Home, or Google Play.\n\n21. Never Been Kissed (1999)\n\nIf you’re watching this movie for the first time in 2024, your jaw might drop at the realization this was a top pick for love story movies in its day. More to the point, it’s still one of the first movies people think of when asked to name teen rom-coms. Why is that so bonkers, you ask? In broad strokes, Never Been Kissed is about a journalist (Drew Barrymore) who goes undercover as a high school student, because Investigative Journalism. Because she’s actually an undercover adult, what happens next isn’t technically about a romantic connection between a high school student and her English teacher, but only technically. What matters is that one of the two characters spends 95% of the movie thinking that’s what’s happening, and — ew? We’re leaving it here less as a romantic movie recommendation and more because it did undeniably influence the teen movie genre.\n\nStream it on Starz, Hulu, Apple TV, and Amazon Prime.\n\n22. The Duff (2015)\n\nWe won’t try to convince you this movie is the critics’ pick for best teen romance movie — it’s not. But it is a fun, guilty pleasure rom-com to throw on in the background when you feel like watching something where the leads actually have very good chemistry despite the script’s shortcomings. Still, let it be known that Mae Whitman is neither fat nor ugly, and even if she were, those aren’t bad things, and they don’t disqualify anyone from being deserving of love. If you can get past that, though, the main characters actually work really well together.\n\nStream it on Hulu, Paramount+, Amazon Prime, or Apple TV.\n\n23. Saved! (2004)\n\nThere’s so much to unpack with this movie in terms of the problematic language used throughout — definitely, it was a product of its time. Still, it has a lot of clever dialogue to go with it, too many iconic lines to quote, and a heartwarming found-family dynamic that may just be better than any of the romantic aspects. (Did we mention it also has Mandy Moore, Jena Malone, and Macaulay Culkin?)\n\nStream it on PlutoTV, Tubi, Fandango At Home, or Amazon Prime.\n\n24. Do Revenge (2022)\n\nEverything about this movie was a little unhinged, but it was still very fun to watch. Do we think the romance aspect of it was perhaps a bit misplaced? A little bit. But even then, the romance we do get is still cute, and a lot of the themes shown can spark a lot of meaningful conversation — it’s definitely a sleepover-movie-night kind of watch.\n\nStream it on Netflix.\n\n25. The Princess Diaries (2001)\n\nThe thing about The Princess Diaries is that it’s not outright a romance movie. Still, if you’ve ever watched it before, there’s no way you can convince us that Mia and Michael didn’t literally invent love. The foot pop? Simply iconic. “Because you saw me when I was invisible?” We’re reaching for the tissues. The M&Ms pizza? If we’re not proposed to that way one day, we aren’t getting married. Now, our secret hot take: While it isn’t a teen love story, if you’re really on the hunt for some romance, go for Princess Diaries 2. It was the world’s introduction to Chris Pine’s blue peepers, and if the in-development Princess Diaries 3 has even half the sequel’s delightfully cheesy charm, we’ll stream it faster than you can say Amelia Mignonette Grimaldi Thermopolis Renaldo, Princess of Genovia.\n\nStream it on Disney+, Amazon Prime, Apple TV, or Google Play.\n\n26. The Half Of It (2020)\n\nThe Half Of It is definitely more coming-of-age movie than rom-com, but here’s the thing: it still delivers a lot of complex emotions, portrays a platonic relationship between people of different genders and, while the romance aspect could definitely have been more front and center, it’s still a beautiful story.\n\nStream it on Netflix.\n\n27. Sierra Burgess Is A Loser (2018)\n\nThe good parts about this movie: a romantic lead who wears something other than a 2-6 pants size and the role female friendship plays. The bad part: centering your whole premise around catfishing someone. Lest we give the movie an undue amount of flack though, it drew its inspo from something that far predates Catfish: The TV Show: the 1897 play Cyrano de Bergerac. And it’s not like it’s the only teen rom-com out there — or on this list, even — that relies on the hidden-identity trope. Ultimately, it’s just a fun one to watch when you don’t want something super serious.\n\nStream it on Hulu, Amazon Prime, or Google Play.\n\n32. Love & Basketball (2000)\n\nOkay, okay. Unfolding over 12 years, this movie doesn’t only take place when its leads, Monica (Sanaa Lathan) and Quincy (Omar Epps), are in their teens. But it still solidly feels like a teenage romance movie, and an exceptionally good one at that. When creating Love & Basketball, writer-director Gina Prince-Bythewood was inspired by two things: her own life (the movie is semi-autobiographical) and her dream of making, as she later put it, a “Black When Harry Met Sally.” The end result is a forever-classic, and we kind of want to know who IRL Prince-Bythewood “played for their heart” because honestly, that’s an incredible line.\n\nStream it on Amazon Prime, Google Play, or Apple TV.\n\n33. A Walk to Remember (2002)\n\nBe honest. If you were a conscious human around the time this movie came out, you at least thought about singing “Only Hope” in your school talent show. Adapted from a Nicholas Sparks novel of the same name, the story of Jesus-y Jamie Sullivan (Mandy Moore) and headed-nowhere-fast Landon Carter (Shane West) has spent years tear-staining many a pillowcase at sleepovers. It feels like an unsubtle call to go to church, but hey, it’s also got all the teen romance we need.\n\nStream it on Amazon Prime, Apple TV, or Google Play.\n\n36. Cruel Intentions (1999)\n\nLike Heathers, this definitely isn’t the movie to stream if you’re looking for heartwarming teen love and cathartic romance. Cruel Intentions is so not that. It gets billed as a teenage romantic drama, but depending on how you watch it, this movie is either unpardonably problematic or it’s a trove of over-the-top camp beloved by some queer viewers. Regardless of which side you fall on, know there are some irrefutably Not Good Things in this movie — for one, Cruel Intentions should come with a content warning for sexual assault. Make sure your friends know what’s up before streaming this together, and skip it for a different pick if anyone feels uncomfortable.\n\nStream it on Amazon Prime, Apple TV, or Fandango At Home.\n\n37. What a Girl Wants (2003)\n\nIt’s got Amanda Bynes at the height of her comedic powers. It’s got a “cool American girl takes on London” plot, and it has Colin Firth in leather pants. Sold? While What a Girl Wants is primarily a fun, heartwarming look at a father-daughter (Firth-Bynes) dynamic, it’s got some teen romance, too. Bynes’ Daphne catches the eye of leather jacket-wearing musician Ian (Oliver James), and believe it or not this, Gen Z, is the hairstyle we thought cute boys had in 2003.\n\nStream it on Amazon Prime, Google Play, or Apple TV.\n\n38. Romeo + Juliet (1996)\n\nIs it even a romantic teen movies list if we didn’t have the OG teen love story on here? Baz Luhrmann’s super-stylized adaptation gives us Romeo (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Juliet (Clare Danes) as two Verona Beach teenagers in the business of falling in love and, well, we’re pretty sure you know what happens. If you want a little pathos with your pleasure, Romeo + Juliet delivers, and the iconic costumes alone make it worth a watch.\n\nStream it on Hulu, Apple TV, or Amazon Prime.\n\n39. Everything, Everything (2017)\n\nOne of those rare book-to-movie adaptations fans actually liked, Everything, Everything isn’t light on the melodrama. But with a premise like the one we’re about to describe, why would you expect it to be? The story centers on Maddy Whittier (Amandla Stenberg), a teenager with a rare illness that essentially makes her allergic to the world, forcing her to be confined at home. Next door, in moves Olly Bright (Nick Robinson). Feelings are caught, perspectives are changed, and characters come of age. Is it corny? Yes. Do we really care? Not so much.\n\nStream it on Amazon Prime, Apple TV, or Google Play.\n\n40. The Sun Is Also a Star (2019)\n\nAgain: If you’re not into corniness, keep it moving. If you’re here to watch pretty people make increasingly extended eye contact, this might be your movie. Set in New York City, it follows a day’s worth of unexpected events that unfold when pragmatic Natasha Kingsley (Yara Shahidi) meets starry-eyed Daniel Jae Ho Bae (Charles Melton). Complicating things? They’ve met just hours before Natasha and her family are set to be deported. If you’re on the fence about watching this one, just look up photos of Shahidi and Melton, then decide.\n\nStream it on Amazon Prime, Google Play, Apple TV, or Fandango At Home.\n\n41. Before Sunrise (1955)\n\nMaybe this Richard Linklater film is more of an early 20s romance than it is a teen romance. If you watch it, though, we don’t think you’ll blame us for the suggestion. Before Sunrise is a 24-hour portrait of a spontaneous connection between two young people — an American, Jesse (Ethan Hawke), and a French student, Céline (Julie Delpy) — who meet on a train. Deciding to impulsively hop off and spend a free day together in Vienna, they walk, they talk, and they feel things. If you do too, you’ll be happy to know there’s also a Before Sunset and Before Midnight movie, each picking up with the characters (and the actors) left off nine years later.\n\nStream it on Amazon Prime, Apple TV, or Google Play.\n\n44. Submarine (2010)\n\nCharmingly offbeat — think Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind vibes, but as a teen rom-com — Submarine follows Oliver Tate (Craig Roberts), an eccentric Welsh 15 year old with a very non-eccentric goal: to lose his virginity before his next birthday. He hopes to achieve that goal with classmate Jordana (Yasmin Paige), the aloof-girl object of his infatuations. And before you ask, yes, she has bangs. What aloof girl in 2010 didn’t?\n\nStream it on Tubi, Pluto TV, or Amazon Prime.\n\n45. Let the Right One In (2008)\n\nSwedish horror-drama, anyone? Let the Right One In may not be a teen movie in the same way that high school-set flicks are. But make no mistake: it’s absolutely a teen love story, and a haunting one at that. Set in wintry 1980s Stockholm, it tells the story of 12-year-old outcast Oskar and Eli, the mysterious girl who moves into the next building. Masterfully blending elements of horror, coming-of-age drama, and romance, it’s a deeply felt movie that’ll get into your veins, if you catch our drift."
