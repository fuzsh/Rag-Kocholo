        "text": "From Valentine’s Day to getting over a breakup, there is never a bad time to watch a great romantic movie. Romcoms are great, but sometimes you just need a good swooning, crying, yearning type of night. The best romantic movies capture the heartbreak and splendor of love. These films feature iconic love stories, romance and passion. The history of romantic films dates back to at least 1896 with The Kiss. Since then, love and romance films have become a thriving genre. But what are the best romantic movies of all time? Let’s break down our top picks for the best romance films and where to watch them.\n\nBest Romantic Films (30-11)\n\nThere are many different kinds of romance films on this list: historical romances, romantic thrillers, musicals, classics, and, yes, even a romcom or two. Directors such as Ang Lee, Frank Capra, and Barry Jenkins have made this list for their contributions to the genre.\n\nFrom 1946 to 2023, films on this list not only range in genre but also era. The highest-grossing romance film, Titanic (1997), is currently also the 4th highest-grossing film of all time with an over $2.2 million global box office (and yes, you can find where to watch in on this list.)\n\n30. Doctor Zhivago (1965)\n\nThis film should come with a warning, given that it is over three hours. Don’t trust this film or the novel it was based on for historical accuracy. The CIA used the novel, also called Doctor Zhivago, as anti-soviet propaganda. Critics also noted the lack of historical accuracy in the film. The film is really best remembered for its epic romance.\n\nDoctor Zhivago follows a poet, lover and physician as he lives through the Russian Revolution and World War II. Staring Omar Sharif and Julie Christie, the film is truly an epic. The picture was nominated for 10 Academy Awards and won five. It is currently available to stream on Tubi and Sling.\n\n29. The Way We Were (1973)\n\nThe Way We Were is not the highest-rated movie on this list, nor is it the best remembered. However, it is a classic 1970s romance drama. Similar to Love Story, A Star is Born, or even later films like Making Love, there is something nostalgic to this era of romance films.\n\nThe film follows two people with nothing in common, played by Barbra Streisand and Robert Redford, as they fall in and out of love. This film is best enjoyed in tandem with its soundtrack, which peaked at number 20 on the Billboard 200 in 1974. It is available to rent on Amazon Prime, Google Play, Apple TV, and VUDU.\n\n28. Like Water for Chocolate (1992)\n\nAlfonso Arau’s Like Water for Chocolate or Como Agua Para Chocolate is based on the 1989 book of the same name by Arau’s wife, Laura Esquivel. The film is set in the early 1900s and follows protagonist Tita as she struggles with family, tradition, and love.\n\nThe picture was selected by Mexico to be the country's nomination for Best Foreign Film at the Oscars. It was not chosen by the academy, but the film won 10 Ariel awards and was nominated as Best Foreign Language Film at the Golden Globes. Like Water for Chocolate captures the magical realism popular in the Mexican romance genre and delivers on love and tragedy. The film is currently available on Pluto TV.\n\n27. ​​Ever After (1998)\n\nThe fairytale—and by extension, the fairytale-reimagined—is a mainstay of the romance genre. Ever After is Cinderella, but with a twist: What if Cinderella was historically accurate? Well, at least as historically accurate as most period romances.\n\nSet in 1500s pastoral France and starring Drew Barrymore, Ever After is a dreamy and aesthetically pleasing retelling. Anjelica Huston also shines as the evil stepmother. The film boasts a 91% on Rotten Tomatoes and also enjoyed box office success. Ever After is currently streaming on Hulu and Disney+.\n\n26. ​​The Best Man (1999)\n\nMalcolm D. Lee’s directorial debut, The Best Man, walks the line between romcom and romance. The film follows a group of friends reconvening for a wedding, but problems arise when the best man’s new novel sounds a lot like the sordid past of the bride and her friends.\n\nStarring Taye Diggs, Nia Long, Morris Chestnut and Terrence Howard, the film garnered a 2013 sequel, The Best Man Holiday, and the limited series, The Best Man: The Final Chapters in 2022. The movie won three NAACP awards, including Outstanding Motion Picture. It is available to stream on Sling.\n\n25. ​​​​​​It’s a Wonderful Life (1946)\n\n“What do you want? You want the moon? Just say the word, and I'll throw a lasso around it and pull it down.” It’s a Wonderful Life is usually remembered for just the final 20-ish minutes. However, there is a lot more in its over 2-hour run time: anti-capitalism, war, the American dream, and, of course, romance.\n\nChristmas romance movies usually don’t stand the test of time, but It’s a Wonderful Life is different. Directed by Frank Capra and starring Jimmy Stewart and Donna Reed, the film was nominated for 5 Academy Awards, including Best Picture. However, it received mixed reviews, and some, including the FBI, thought the film was too communist in its messaging. It is currently streaming on the Roku Channel and Amazon Prime.\n\n24. ​​Lust, Caution (2007)\n\nProbably the steamiest movie on this list, Lust, Caution was given an NC-17 rating. Based on the 1979 novella of the same name by Eileen Chang, the film follows a young student as she is tasked with seducing and assassinating a political figure in WWII-era Japanese-occupied Shanghai.\n\nDirected by Ang Lee, the film earned mixed reviews, but it received an 84% audience score on Rotten Tomatoes. It is currently available to rent on YouTube, Apple TV, VUDU, and Amazon Prime.\n\n23. ​​Sleepless in Seattle (1993)\n\nDirected by Nora Ephron, Sleepless in Seattle stars romcom royalty Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks. The film follows Ryan’s Annie as she falls for the recently widowed dad, Sam, after he shares his story on the radio.\n\nThe movie was well-received by critics and audiences. While the film walks the romcom line, it has the yearning and sentimentality that delivers on romance. Because, as Annie says, “Destiny is something that we’ve invented because we can’t stand the fact that everything that happens is accidental.” The movie is available to rent on Apple TV, Amazon Prime, Google Play, and YouTube.\n\n22. ​​​​​​The Story of a Three-Day Pass (1967)\n\nWhile Melvin Van Peebles’s The Story of a Three-Day Pass might not be top of mind for many romance fans, it's a beautiful film that deserves a watch. The movie follows a Black American G.I. on a three-day leave to Paris and a star-crossed affair with a French shop clerk.\n\nThe film captures the feeling of the French New Wave in a unique way. The Story of a Three-Day Pass was selected to be at the Cannes Classics at the 2020 Cannes Film Festival and was championed as \"among the great American films of the sixties” by The New Yorker and Richard Brody. It is currently available to stream on Max.\n\n21. ​​​​​​Thirst (2009)\n\nThe Romantic Horror sub-genre isn’t for everyone. However, it has been popular, especially in books since the 1800s. The Gothic Horror and Romance genre often leads to period pieces or monster movies, and Thirst is certainly the latter.\n\nThis Korean vampire film directed by Park Chan-wook features a priest, an extramarital affair and blood. Warning: It’s a little more Dracula than Twilight, so if you aren’t looking for something dark, it might be worth skipping. The film won the Jury Prize at the 2009 Cannes Film Festival and stars Parasite’s Song Kang-ho​​ and Kim Ok-bin. It is available to rent on Google Play, Apple TV, Vudu, and Amazon Prime.\n\n20. An American in Paris (1951)\n\nAn American in Paris combines romance with the big-budget musicals of Hollywood’s golden age. The film is visually spectacular and directed by Vincente Minnelli. Much of the romance comes from the palpable chemistry when stars Gene Kelly and Leslie Caron dance together.\n\nThe picture ends with an impressive closing dance/ballet sequence that clocks in at 17 minutes. The film won six Oscars, including Best Picture. It is available to rent on YouTube, Google Play, VUDU, Apple TV, and Amazon Prime.\n\n19. ​​​​​​Your Name (2016)\n\nYour Name is an animated Japanese film. The movie follows two high school students who intermittently swap bodies after viewing a comet. The two fall in love after living each other's lives but must learn how to go back.\n\nThe picture is extremely well reviewed both for its animation and story, with a 98% on Rotten Tomatoes. There are two versions of the film: one in the original Japanese and a dubbed version in English. Additionally, Japan’s Toho Studios is working on a live action adaption. It is currently available to stream on Crunchy Roll.\n\n18. Moonstruck (1987)\n\nAfter a Brooklyn widow accepts a marriage proposal, she finds herself falling for her fiancé’s hot tempered younger brother in this 1987 classic dramedy. Moonstruck earned Cher an Oscar for best lead actress and earned co-star Nicholas Cage critical success.\n\nThe movie is extremely quotable, with lines like “Snap out of it!” and “I lost my hand! I lost my bride! Johnny has his hand! Johnny has his bride!” It is currently available to watch on Tubi, Pluto TV, and the Roku Channel.\n\n17. The Princess Bride (1987)\n\nThe Princess Bride follows the romance between a farmhand turned pirate and a young maiden set to be married to an evil prince. This family-friendly film is a comedy and fantasy, but the romance comes through, even in some of its siller moments, because \"Death cannot stop true love. All it can do is delay it for a while.\"\n\nBased on the 1973 novel of the same name, The Princess Bride stars Cary Elwes and Robin Wright and was directed by Rob Reiner. The film has gained an almost cult status and enjoys a 98% on Rotten Tomatoes. It is currently available to stream on Disney+.\n\n16. ​​​​​​Moonlight (2016)\n\nBarry Jenkins’s Moonlight is about a lot more than just a romance. It is a look into sexuality, identity, manhood, parenthood and the Black experience. However, the romance between Chiron and Kevin is a heartbreaking and poignant examination of Black queer romantic love.\n\nWhile there are other movies about how society keeps men in love apart, like 1987’s Maurice or 2005’s Brokeback Mountain, Moonlight feels genre-defining. The film was nominated for eight Oscars and won three, including Best Picture (making it the first LGBTQ film to do so.) It is currently available to stream on Max.\n\n15. ​​​​​​Past Lives (2023)\n\nThe most recent movie on this list, Past Lives, follows two childhood friends as they reconnect as adults over a few days in the course of 24 years.\n\nThe directorial debut for Celine Song, the film was loosely based on Song’s own life. It also stars Greta Lee and Teo Yoo. It is currently nominated for two Oscars in 2024, Best Original Screenplay and Best Picture. It is available to rent on Amazon Prime, Google Play, and Apple TV.\n\n14. Before Sunrise (1995)\n\nBefore Sunrise follows two strangers as they choose to spend the day together in Vienna. The film is 90s in the best way, starring Julie Deply and Ethan Hawke. The picture premiered at Sundance and was inspired by a real-life romantic run that director Richard Linklater had as a young man in Philadelphia.\n\nThe film currently boasts a 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoes and inspired two sequels, 2004’s Before Sunset and 2013’s Before Midnight. While each movie has the same basic premise, the characters grow and change throughout the nearly 20-year run. The trilogy is worth watching in its entirety, as each captures love at different points of life. Before Sunrise is available to rent on Amazon Prime, Google Play, YouTube, and Apple TV.\n\n13. Carol (2015)\n\nCarol follows a love affair between the titular Carol, played by Cate Blanchett, and Therese, a young photographer and shop girl, played by Rooney Mara. Set in the 1950s, the film explores love, motherhood, homophobia and the repression of the time.\n\nWriter Phyllis Nagy started writing the project in 1997 based on the 1952 romance novel The Price of Salt by Patricia Highsmith. The picture earned six Academy Award nominations and nine BAFTA Film Award nominations. It is currently available to stream on Netflix.\n\n12. Titanic (1997)\n\nIt feels silly even having to explain Titanic. The film was the highest-grossing film of all time until 2010, when James Cameron surpassed himself with Avatar (2009). The movie follows two lovers, played by Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio, on the tragic maiden voyage of the RMS Titanic in 1912.\n\nWhile the film includes some historical characters, such as the “unsinkable” Margaret “Molly” Brown, the film’s protagonists are fictional. The picture was nominated for 14 Oscars and won 11, including Best Picture. It is currently streaming on Paramount+.\n\n11. Shakespeare In Love (1998)\n\nShakespeare In Love is one of those unique movies that has comedy and romance but isn’t really a romcom. It fully feels like a romance and is light on the melodrama while still being a period piece.\n\nShakespeare In Love stars Gwyneth Paltrow and Joseph Fiennes. In the film, Paltrow’s Viola, the daughter of a wealthy merchant in 1500s England, dons drag to act in a new play written by William Shakespeare. The two fall in love and the fictitious romance leads to Shakespeare writting Romeo and Juliet. The film controversially won seven Oscars, including Best Picture, which many thought should have gone to its competitor Saving Private Ryan. It is currently streaming on Max.\n\nTop 10 Romantic Movies\n\nWhile all the films on this list deliver swoon-worthy romances, the top 10 give us something more. These romances stick with you even after the credits roll. Many of them have been referenced in other films and have served as inspiration for new love stories. Others have helped define genres or started renewed interest in romance films. These films are iconic for good reason and make the top of the list of the romance movie genre.\n\n10. The Notebook (2004)\n\nIt might be a little cheesy, but that’s part of what makes it great. Based on the novel of the same name, the Notebook is just one of many movies based on Nicholas Sparks’ romance books. However, it’s probably the best one.\n\nThe Notebook features a story within a story as an elderly Noah, played by James Garner, tells his wife Allie, played by Gena Rowlands, their own love story to try to combat her dementia. In flashbacks, younger versions of the couple, played by Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams, fall in love even as Allie’s family tries to keep them apart. The movie has always been met with mixed reviews and even became some what of a meme. However, it connected with its demographic, sweeping the Teen Choice Awards. It is now streaming on Hulu.\n\n9. Monsoon Wedding (2001)\n\nMonsoon Wedding’s director, Mira Nair, knows how to make a romance film. Her movies Mississippi Masala and Kama Sutra: A Tale of Love are also favorites of many romance film fans. Monsoon Wedding follows a hectic wedding week for an arranged marriage in a modern Indian family.\n\nVasundhara Das and Parvin Dabas star in a story about love, family, breaking tradition and adultery. Roger Ebert said, “[Monsoon Wedding] is one of those joyous films that leaps over national boundaries and celebrates universal human nature.” It is available to rent on Amazon Prime and Google Play.\n\n8. God’s Own Country (2017)\n\nGod’s Own Country is a sensitive love story between a young English farmer, Johnny, and Gheorghe, a Romanian migrant worker, during the lambing season in Yorkshire, England. Written and directed by Francis Lee, the film stars Josh O'Connor and Alec Secăreanu.\n\nThe picture premiered at the 2017 Sundance Film Festival and won their world cinema directing award. God’s Own Country wrestles with the themes of intimacy, masculinity, loneliness and place. The film earned a 98% on Rotten Tomatoes and is currently available on Tubi and AMC+.\n\n7. An Affair to Remember (1957)\n\nStarring Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr, An Affair to Remember is a blueprint for so many other melodramas. It is even heavily and directly referenced in Sleepless in Seattle. The film includes a meet on a transatlantic crossing, a meeting at the empire state building, and grave injury.\n\nAn Affair to Remember was nominated for five Oscars but did not win any. While critics have given it mixed reviews, it earned an 87% audience score on Rotten Tomatoes. It is available to rent on Amazon Prime, Google Play, VUDU, and Apple TV.\n\n6. Pride and Prejudice (2005)\n\nWho doesn’t want someone to tell them that they love them “most ardently”? There have been many films based on Jane Austen’s Pride and Prejudice, but Joe Wright’s 2005 adaptation is simply dreamy.\n\nStarring Keira Knightley and Matthew Macfadyen, the film follows one of the most famous literary love triangles of all time. Between the score and the cinematography, this picture is probably the most romanticized version of the classic novel. It was nominated for four Academy Awards and has been credited as an influence on the resurgence of the period romance genre in the 2000s. Pride and Prejudice is available to rent on Amazon Prime, Google Play, Apple TV, and VUDU.\n\n5. The Umbrellas of Cherbourg (1964)\n\nA French New Wave opera might sound like a hard sell, but The Umbrellas of Cherbourg is a masterpiece. The film follows the star-crossed love story of Geneviève and Guy, two young lovers in a small city in Normandy. The movie stars Catherine Deneuve and Nino Castelnuovo and was written and directed by Jacques Demy.\n\nThe Umbrellas of Cherbourg won the Palme d'Or at the 1964 Cannes Film Festival and has been a favorite of film lovers and filmmakers. Both Damien Chazelle and Greta Gerwig have cited The Umbrellas of Cherbourg as an influence for their films La La Land and Barbie, respectively. It is currently streaming on Max.\n\n4. Roman Holiday (1953)\n\nRoman Holiday follows a young princess, Audrey Hepburn, as she takes a day off to see Rome and encounters an American reporter, Gregory Peck. Cary Grant was originally offered the role but turned it down as he thought he was too old to play opposite Hepburn.\n\nThe film earned Hepburn both a Golden Globe and an Oscar for her role as Princess Ann. Roman Holiday has a noted legacy and was selected for preservation in the Library of Congress in 1999 for being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\" The film is currently available to rent on YouTube, Amazon Prime, Google Play, Apple TV, and VUDU.\n\n3. Portrait of a Lady on Fire (2019)\n\nWritten and directed by Céline Sciamma, Portrait of a Lady on Fire follows an 18th-century affair between two women on a small French isle. Marianne, a painter, is tasked with secretly painting Héloïse’s portrait to send to the man she is intended to marry. While Marianne paints the portrait, she loses the girl.\n\nThe film is pure heartbreak and takes an unflinching look at art, the female gaze and unspoken love. It won the Queer Palm at the 2019 Cannes Film Festival and received a 97% on Rotten Tomatoes. It is currently available on Hulu.\n\n2. In the Mood For Love (2000)\n\nIn the Mood For Love follows two neighbors as a friendship turns into a strong bond outside of their respective marriages. The film takes place in 1960s Hong Kong and delivers on both style and substance.\n\nDirector Wong Kar-wai has directed many notable romance films, including Chungking Express and Happy Together, but In the Mood For Love has a lush quality that is undeniable. Sofia Coppola credited the film as inspiration for Lost in Translation, and the Daniels, aka Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert, used it as inspiration for an alternate universe in their film Everything Everywhere All at Once. In The Mood For Love is currently available to stream on Max.\n\n1. Casablanca (1942)\n\n“Here’s looking at you, kid.” This film is start-to-finish iconic. Casablanca follows a night club owner, Rick, as he decides to help the leader of the Czechoslovak Resistance, Victor Laszlo, escape Morocco and the Nazis even though Laszlo is traveling with an old flame of Rick’s, Ilsa Lund.\n\nThe film was directed by Michael Curtiz and starred Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman. Roger Ebert said of Casablanca, “This is a movie that has transcended the ordinary categories. It has outlived the Bogart cult, survived the revival circuit, shrugged off those who would deface it with colorization, leaped across time to win audiences who were born decades after it was made.” And in that way, we will always have Paris. The film is currently available to stream on Max.\n\nBottom Line\n\nIt’s ok to yearn for a good romance plot. Grab the tissues and the popcorn because these films won’t disappoint when it comes to love."
