        "text": "Whether you’re looking to learn French or just hoping to mix up your movie nights, you’re in luck – you’re in luck – there are tons of great French movies to watch on Netflix in 2024.\n\nWhen it comes to finding French films on Netflix, you’ll be spoiled for choice. Provided, of course, that you know where to look.\n\nRevelation, we know. You can get French movies on Netflix – they’re just not always easy to find. Fortunately, Netflix has added a feature where you can search ‘French’ and then filter down to French movies or French television series.\n\nTo help you find the right French flick, we’ve compiled a list of the top French films on Netflix right now, with movies from France and the wider French-speaking world.\n\nWhether it’s a rip-roaring comedy or a tear-jerking drama you’re after, trust us – there’s no better way to learn French and familiarize yourself with the French accent than a great film.\n\nNote: We’ve marked which country each film comes from, and included films with actors from a variety of places. Just like with our articles on Spanish movies on Netflix and Netflix’s Spanish series, different French speaking countries have different accents and phrases.\n\nExpand your horizons with these 10 French movies on Netflix\n\n1. Friendzone – 2021\n\nTomatometer: 90% (audience only)\n\nGenre: Rom-com\n\nCountry of origin: France\n\nFriendzone is a light-hearted, fairly run-of-the-mill romantic comedy about a man who tries to change himself to attract his crush but ends up pushing her away instead. If you’re looking for something fluffy with a French twist, Friendzone will do the trick!\n\n2. Athena – 2022\n\nTomatometer: 86%\n\nGenre: Action, drama\n\nCountry of origin: France\n\nThis certified fresh action flick follows a family thrown into chaos – and danger – after the unexpected death of their youngest sibling. A fast-paced thriller with car chases, tension and even hints of social commentary, it’s perfect for action fans looking for a heart-pounding way to work on their French.\n\n3. Mademoiselle de Joncquières (Lady J) – 2018\n\nTomatometer: 85%\n\nGenre: Period drama\n\nCountry of origin: France\n\nMademoiselle de Joncquières is a visually striking period romance for fans of Les Liaisons dangereuses and Atonement. Inspired by a story from the novel Jacques the Fatalist by Denis Diderot, the story follows a widow who tries to exact revenge on a womanizer who breaks her heart by making him fall in love with someone of lower social standing. The film was nominated for six César Awards including Best Screenplay, Best Cinematography, Best Actress and Best Actor.\n\n4. Anelka: Misunderstood – 2020\n\nTomatometer: 76%\n\nGenre: Sports documentary\n\nCountry of origin: France\n\nAnelka: Misunderstood profiles the career of the one-time bad boy of French football, Nicolas Anelka, and has him weigh in on his own rise and fall. One of Netflix’s original offerings in the French language, fans of The Last Dance looking for another sports doc about a highly competitive, capable player will find an interesting profile of a controversial yet talented football (soccer) player.\n\n5. Atlantics – 2019\n\nTomatometer: 96%\n\nGenre: Drama, romance\n\nCountry of origin: Senegal, France, Belgium\n\nRendered in a combination of Wolof and French, Atlantics takes place in a suburb of Dakar, following a pair of young lovers and the looming construction of a new high-rise tower. A rare drama that successfully weaves together themes of romance, revenge, migration and a touch of the supernatural, Atlantics made waves (no pun intended) both for its universal acclaim and as the first film made by a black woman to be featured in competition at the Cannes Film Festival.\n\nWhile the Senegalese accent may be a bit tricky at first for French learners, it’s a good challenge. Just make sure you have the subtitles on – unless you speak Wolof, too!\n\n6. Bon Cop, Bad Cop – 2006\n\nTomatometer: 78%\n\nGenre: Action, Comedy\n\nCountry of origin: Canada\n\nThis hilarious Québécois action comedy follows two police officers – one English and one French speaking – who are forced to work together to stop a serial killer. While its critical score is somewhat low, it was popular enough to spawn a sequel, which is also available on Netflix (if not as widely loved).\n\nThe French in Bon Cop, Bad Cop is Québécois through and through, so it could be tough to understand if you’re used to the French spoken in France.\n\n7. La Femme la plus assassinée du monde (The Most Assassinated Woman in the World) – 2018\n\nTomatometer: 86%\n\nGenre: Mystery and thriller, period drama\n\nCountry of origin: Belgium, France\n\nSet in the 1930s at the Grand Guignol Theatre in Paris, La Femme la plus assassinée du monde loosely portrays the life of real-life actress Paula Maxa. In the film, Paula – who has been murdered on stage thousands of times as part of her work with the famously gruesome theater company – finds herself being stalked by a real would-be assassin.\n\n8. Je ne suis pas un homme facile (I Am not an Easy Man) – 2018\n\nTomatometer: 80%\n\nGenre: Comedy, satire\n\nCountry of origin: France\n\nThis fantastical rom-com takes a chauvinist man and plops him in a matriarchal world, where women rule and men get catcalled. While the territory of a person getting hit on the head and awakening to find themselves in a topsy-turvy world is well-trodden in the rom-com space, reviewers and audiences agree that Je ne suis pas un homme facile does it with a fresh take and a sparkle that many similar films have lacked.\n\n9. Les Affamés (Ravenous) – 2017\n\nTomatometer: 87%\n\nGenre: Zombie, thriller\n\nCountry of origin: Canada\n\nIdiosyncratic, nuanced and laidback are not words usually used to describe zombie films. But this Canadian indie entry into the zombie apocalypse genre is exactly that. Set in a small town in rural Québec, Les Affamés has humor, philosophy and gore. The film premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival and was nominated for Best Motion Picture at the Canadian Screen Awards.\n\n10. J’ai perdu mon corps (I Lost My Body) – 2019\n\nTomatometer: 96%\n\nGenre: Animation, sci-fi, fantasy, drama\n\nCountry of origin: France\n\nAn original, creative and gruesome animated film, J’ai perdu mon corps follows a hand that’s been cut off, seeking its body. The hand remembers their life together (hand and body), including meeting a woman and falling in love.\n\nAnd there you have it!
