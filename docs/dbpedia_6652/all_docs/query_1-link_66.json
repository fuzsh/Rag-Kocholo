        "text": "Landscape in narrative cinema has silent enunciating power. The choice of location shots alone constitutes a set of complex considerations. We may wonder, why was Monument Valley featured in so many westerns? Is it only because of the site’s marvelous photogenicity, or its geographic location, or its social and historical significance? The formal and stylistic choices filmmakers made regarding how landscape is represented on screen, whether as a real or a fictional site, also reveal critical engagements with both social reality and the pictorial conventions of landscape art. Does it look barren or lush? sublime or banal? What is the concept of nature, what is a “view,” or picturesque, and how are these critical questions in representations of landscape framed and mediated in cinema? Does the representation of landscape work for or against the storyline unfolding on screen? What does it tell us about social reality, ecological concerns, and political commentary? This course examines landscape in narrative cinema not only as subject or part of the mise-en-scene but also as a way of seeing, a site of expression, and locus of social, historical, and political meaning. Each week we explore a film genre or a film movement, for example, Western, or Japanese New Wave, and study how landscape functions in that genre. Students are expected to watch films, read, and analyze both the readings and films carefully prior to coming to class. As a term project, each student selects a particular site (any site of their choice) for the focus of their study and research of cinematic landscape in the course. These sites can be a place personal to you, or a place you think is interesting or important in cinema. There will be workshops during the course of the semester to help complete the final project.\n\nDays/Times: T 1:30PM - 4:00PM\n\nInstructor: Liu, Yinxing\n\nRoom: MSE Library ERC\n\nStatus: Open\n\nSeats Available: 5/15\n\nPosTag(s): HART-MODERN, MSCH-HUM\n\nThis course offers a journey through the history of computer animation. We’ll start with an archaeology of the digital image, look at experimental animations by early computer artists, and sketch out the work of engineers in developing techniques of wire-frame modeling, texture mapping, shadowing, and facial animation. Beginning with short films and digital sequences in otherwise live-action movies, we’ll cover a wide variety of animation styles in an international context. Screenings will be drawn from a selection of fully computer-animated features, such as those from Studio Ghibli and Pixar; live-action movies with digital special effects in the mode of Tron (Lisberger, USA, 1982) and Terminator 2: Judgment Day (Cameron, USA, 1992); films that use computer software to aid traditional methods of animating, such as The Illusionist (Chomet, France, 2010) and Boy and the World (Abreu, Brazil, 2014); and animated documentaries, such as Waltz with Bashir (Folman, Israel, 2008) and Tower (Maitland, USA, 2016).\n\nDays/Times: M 2:00PM - 4:30PM\n\nInstructor: Stine, Kyle J.\n\nRoom: The Centre 208\n\nStatus: Open\n\nSeats Available: 1/15\n\nPosTag(s): FILM-CRITST, MSCH-HUM\n\nThis course explores film adaptation by considering how words, images, and sounds offer different affordances and constraints for creative expression. A central goal is to conceive of adaptation outside of typical discussions of fidelity to a source work and instead consider how different artistic media open up unique opportunities for storytelling. To this end, we will draw on a number of different intermedial translations, which may include from novel to film (The Night of the Hunter, from Davis Grubb’s book to James Agee’s screenplay to Charles Laughton’s film), from short story to film (The Turin Horse), from graphic novel to film (Ghost World) or television series (HBO’s Watchmen), from personal essay to documentary film (James Baldwin’s The Devil Finds Work and I Am Not Your Negro), from poetry to film (O Brother, Where Art Thou), from play to film (A Raisin in the Sun and My Own Private Idaho), from radio drama to film (Sorry, Wrong Number), and film-to-film homage (Far From Heaven and All That Heaven Allows). We will also delve into the vagaries of film-to-book novelizations and the curious case of concurrently writing film and book, as in Stanley Kubrick and Arthur C. Clark’s collaboration on the film and novel 2001: A Space Odyssey (both adapted from a short story).\n\nDays/Times: TTh 10:30AM - 11:45AM\n\nInstructor: Stine, Kyle J.\n\nRoom: Krieger 205\n\nStatus: Open\n\nSeats Available: 1/15\n\nPosTag(s): FILM-CRITST\n\nCourse is taught in ENGLISH. Did you know that one of the first Latin American actresses to conquer Hollywood was Brazilian? Did you know that cinema has existed in Brazil since 1895, just six months after the first screening in Paris? This course is an introduction to both the academic study of cinema as a communicative art and to Brazilian film. The films selected focus on the late 1950s to the present and highlight import episodes and challenges in the advancement of Brazilian society as well as its cinematic production. Film aesthetics are analyzed through a number of critical perspectives, including class, race, gender as well as ethnicity, nationalism or national identity, colonialism, social changes, and the politics of representation. In this sense, the films, and documentaries that we will be watching and studying encompass the period from the rise of New Cinema (Cinema Novo) up to films exploring the most recent trends, including movies launched up to 2022. Students wishing to do the course work in English for 3 credits should register for section 01. Those wishing to earn 4 credits by doing the course work in Portuguese should register for section 02.

Specifically, we will focus on learning the craft of screenwriting — strategies, processes, and philosophies that writers can develop, practice, and rely upon as they progress through a series of screenwriting exercises and write a 12-page screenplay, which will be critiqued in-class during weekly table reads and with the Instructor (one-on-one) during office hours. Select produced feature screenplays will be read and analyzed — and clips from select films viewed — to further explore what works well on the page, and how it translates to working well onscreen. (Scripts and clips often selected from American films from the '70s, '80s, and '90s.) A free 18-week trial of Final Draft software will be made available for all students who don’t wish to purchase it outright for $99.)\n\nDays/Times: T 11:00AM - 2:00PM\n\nInstructor: Rodgers, Adam F\n\nRoom: The Centre 206\n\nStatus: Approval Required\n\nSeats Available: 4/12\n\nPosTag(s): FILM-SCRWRT\n\nThis course offers an introduction to internet studies through the many ways digital culture has touched our everyday lives: memes, blogs, gaming, social networking, instant messaging, and more. From its origins in connecting scientific researchers to its present form as a multi-device, multi-platform web connecting us to everything from each other to our smart homes, the internet has proven that nearly our entire social world can be processed as data and linked up. While this has meant greater connection, it has also raised questions about how we learn, communicate, behave, and organize. The internet has long promised new avenues of personal expression, but it has also brought with it the quandaries of echo chambers, information silos, and disinformation campaigns. In response to these complicating effects, the course offers an opportunity for students to develop the critical mapping tools necessary to orient oneself within this vast cultural network and its rapid historical unfolding.\n\nDays/Times: M 2:00PM - 4:30PM\n\nInstructor: Stine, Kyle J.\n\nRoom: The Centre 208\n\nStatus: Open\n\nSeats Available: 12/30\n\nPosTag(s): FILM-CRITST, MSCH-HUM\n\nBefore film even emerged as a popular entertainment form, motion pictures were used to study the human body for purposes of scientific inquiry and medical practice. The present-day crossovers between imaging science and cinema—the inclusion of medical imaging in movies and television shows, the deployment of informational videos and animations in telehealth, and the myriad ways that digital imaging itself is spurred on by the needs of scientific investigation and the demand for cultural works—suggest that what we know about the human body is caught up in a complex web of technical representations and cultural meanings. This course explores the construction of the human body within this array of cinematic practice. Our approach will be twofold: First, we will consider scientific and medical images not merely as powerful means of seeing what would otherwise be unseeable but also as technically enabled and culturally influenced ways of knowing, that is, images, as in cinema, that are historical and could be otherwise. Second, we will examine representations of the human body in the history of film, focusing on how bodies are represented, what bodies are privileged, and how bodies are figured using medical imaging.\n\nDays/Times: TTh 10:30AM - 11:45AM\n\nInstructor: Stine, Kyle J.\n\nRoom: Krieger 306\n\nStatus: Open\n\nSeats Available: 6/15\n\nPosTag(s): FILM-CRITST, MSCH-HUM\n\nIntensive workshop course where students will write a first draft of a feature-length screenplay. Classes will focus on the specific challenges of the students’ works-in-progress, with an emphasis on developing a story idea that is suitable for a feature, and the craft to see it through to completion. Particular emphasis will be placed on the feature screenwriter’s central challenge: creating enough of a structure in the early writing stages to keep the screenplay on track, while remaining open to new ideas for scenes and sequences that inevitably arise as the characters, story, and themes come to life. Select produced feature screenplays will be read and analyzed — and clips from select films viewed—to explore what works well on the page, and how it translates to working well onscreen. Throughout the course, Instructor will also devote a portion of class time to discuss the business of screenwriting. Students will be required to purchase a license for Final Draft screenwriting software for $99 by Week 2 (if they have not already done so for a prior screenwriting course).\n\nDays/Times: M 11:00AM - 2:00PM\n\nInstructor: Rodgers, Adam F\n\nRoom: The Centre 206\n\nStatus: Approval Required\n\nSeats Available: 0/9\n\nPosTag(s): FILM-SCRWRT\n\nThis course explores various elements of film production and filmic expression through a somewhat nebulous field typically described as lost films. Lost films (or as they are sometimes called, \"orphan\" films) can be generally described as films that have, for a variety of reasons, fallen out of the public view. They frequently come from educational, scientific, medical, or industrial films from the 1950s and 1960s. Using these films as source materials, lost film filmmakers explore and expose cultural conventions, visual icons, and historical value materials. Each week, students are responsible for re-editing sources found on an internet archive site. The assignments follow thematic concerns related to film editing. Students complete a final project (4-8 minutes). All editing for the course is accomplished with non-linear software, generally Adobe Premiere or Final Cut.\n\nDays/Times: W 11:00AM - 1:30PM\n\nInstructor: Mann, John\n\nRoom: The Centre 206\n\nStatus: Approval Required\n\nSeats Available: 7/9\n\nPosTag(s): FILM-PROD\n\nFor the past fifty years, scholars and cinephiles have been drawn to psychoanalysis as a tool for understanding the unconscious effects films have on their viewers. However, over the past twenty years, since the dawn of television’s Second Golden Age, there has been significantly less psychoanalytic engagement with television as a medium. Marxist theorists and critics, on the other hand, have long been interested in television. But until relatively recently, this was usually to bemoan it as an ideological product of the “culture industry.” This course draws on central texts of media studies, as well as key texts in psychoanalytic and Marxist theory, to ask some of the following questions: What is formally unique about the television episode? Are series works of art or commodities, or both? What is Prestige TV, and is it over? What role have streaming services played in the evolution of the medium? What is binge watching, and why do we both love and hate to do it? We will watch episodes of many of the most lauded serial dramas of the past few decades, such as The Sopranos, Twin Peaks, Mad Men, The Wire, Breaking Bad, and Succession, as well as critically acclaimed comedies like The Simpsons, Seinfeld, The Office (UK), and Peep Show. We will read theorists such as Sigmund Freud, Jacques Lacan, Theodor Adorno, Walter Benjamin, Laura Mulvey, Jason Mittell, Mark Fisher, and Todd McGowan.\n\nDays/Times: TTh 12:00PM - 1:15PM\n\nInstructor: Meyer, Marshall\n\nRoom: Shaffer 202\n\nStatus: Waitlist Only\n\nSeats Available: 0/12\n\nPosTag(s): n/a"
