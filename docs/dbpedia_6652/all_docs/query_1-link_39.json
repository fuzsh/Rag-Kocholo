        "text": "Do you remember the movie or filmmaker that changed your life? When you realized film was more than entertainment? When you were moved so emotionally that you couldn’t shake the feeling you had when watching the movie? Veteran French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier, who directed such acclaimed films as THE CLOCKMAKER OF ST. PAUL (‘74); COUP DE TORCHON (‘81) and ‘ROUND MIDNIGHT (‘86), was just a boy when he fell in love with the films of such directors as Jacques Becker and Jean Renoir.\n\nTheir films gave him “tremendous emotion,” he told me in a 2017 interview for the American Cinematheque. “Tears and love. Because of them, I think, I understood my country. I think I fell in love with France because of those films. Not because of politicians, but because of Renoir, because of Claude Sautet, because of Marcel Pagnol.”\n\nIn 2016, he directed a valentine of a documentary, MY JOURNEY THROUGH FRENCH CINEMA. It’s a must-see for French film fans, as well as those who are just dipping their toes into the country’s cinema. The documentary looks at the works of Becker and Renoir, as well as Jean-Pierre Melville, Claude Sautet, the writer-director team of Jacques Prevert and Marcel Carne and the pioneering New Wave filmmakers Francois Truffaut and Jean-Luc Godard.\n\n“The main reason I decided to do the film is that I wanted to say, ‘Thank you’ to all of those people who changed my life,” noted the 79-year-old Tavernier. “I mean those directors, screenwriters, composers, actors and actresses. Some of those films gave me hope, gave me strength. You know there is a Chinese proverb which says that when you drink the water of the well, you must always thank the man who built it.”\n\nJean Renoir (1894-1979) didn’t build French cinema, but he was definitely one of the chief architects. The son of renowned Impressionist painter Pierre-Auguste Renoir, he is considered one of the greatest, if not the greatest, French filmmaker of the 20th century. He was also one of the most influential with the New Wave directors because he was what the New Wave considered an auteur, a filmmaker who exerts his personal influence and artistic control so that he is considered the author of the movie.\n\nRenoir made countless classic films both in France and in the U.S., where he fled when the Nazis took power of his country. Renoir earned his only Oscar nomination for Best Director for THE SOUTHERNER (‘45). But two of his greatest accomplishments are LA GRANDE ILLUSION (‘37) and THE RULES OF THE GAME (‘39). LA GRANDE ILLUSION, which was released in the states in 1938, was the first foreign language film to earn a Best Picture Oscar nomination and the New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Foreign Film.\n\nSet during World War I, LA GRANDE ILLUSION is a powerful anti-war statement as well as a look at the class structure in France. Renoir’s frequent collaborators, superstar Jean Gabin, Marcel Dalio and Pierre Fresnay, play three French officers who are captured and sent to a POW camp run by an aristocratic German commander played Erich von Stroheim. Though critics often have cited THE RULES OF THE GAME as Renoir’s masterpiece, I prefer GRANDE ILLUSION because he imbues his characters with empathy and sympathy.\n\nTHE RULES OF THE GAME opened 91 years ago this month in France, just a few months before the German occupation. Audiences, especially the wealthy, didn’t want to see this film as it satirized the ruling class. Renoir would later say that he tried to salvage the film by cutting it, “and to start with, I cut scenes in which I myself played too large a part, as though I was ashamed, after the rebuff, of showing myself on screen. But it was useless.” Renoir was figuratively bound and quartered by French audiences for RULES OF THE GAME because it skewers the aristocracy. The rich and spoiled have no morals bounding in and out of each other’s arms and beds during a hunting weekend at the country estate of a wealthy marquis (Dalio). The scene of the rabbit hunt is horrific, as these frivolous beings kill countless defenseless animals trying to escape their rifles. And the estate’s staff and workers are equally amoral.\n\nThe only character who has heart is Octave played by Renoir, a big bear of a man who is “friends” with the aristocracy but in the end is really alone. THE RULES OF THE GAME only stayed in theaters for three weeks and was actually banned as “demoralizing.” The shortened version did play in the country after World War II, but it wasn’t until 1956—when two French lab technicians found over 200 boxes with bits and pieces of the cut material— that the film restored to its originally glory.\n\nIn 1999, a The Village Voice poll placed it as the second-best film of the century after Citizen Kane. During the 1930’s, Jacques Becker (1906-1960) was an assistant to Renoir. And just as Renoir, he was very much admired by the New Wave. Truffaut once wrote that Becker “is an intimate and realistic filmmaker who is in love with verisimilitude and everyday realities.” Tavernier described Becker as “the finest French filmmaker of the ’40 and ‘50s the most even in quality, the smartest in his choices.”\n\nAmong his acclaimed films are the gangster noir TOUCHEZ PAS AU GRISBI (1954), starring Gabin, and the taut prison escape drama LE TROU (1959). But his loveliest, most emotional film is CASQUE D’OR (‘52), starring Simone Signoret, as the mistress of a ruthless gangster (Claude Dauphin), who falls passionately in love with a reformed ex-con (Serge Reggiani). Though it’s telegraphed early that their love affair will end tragically, it’s so well-acted, compelling and even suspenseful. Signoret won the BAFTA honor for Best Foreign Film Actress.\n\nEarly in his career, Tavernier worked with Jean-Pierre Melville (1917-1973), who was a mentor to the New Wave directors and was best known for his superb almost minimalist film noirs including BOB LE FLAMBEUR (‘56), LE DOULOS (‘62), LE SAMOURAI (‘67) and LE CIRCLE ROUGE (‘70). Tavernier notes in MY JOURNEY THROUGH FRENCH CINEMA that Melville was a bully, having squabbles with his actors and would also dress down his crew in front of everybody.\n\n“That was a nightmare for me,” he told me. “When I was coming to work, I was sick. I was young. It was demanding, as frightening as school. It’s only later on the set of other directors that I discovered the atmosphere was not like that. That doesn’t change anything about the talent of Melville, but he created an atmosphere which was frightening, especially for a young kid like me.”"
