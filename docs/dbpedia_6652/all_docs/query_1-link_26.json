        "text": "Continental Films\n\nFrench Cinema under German Control\n\nChristine Leteux\n\nWisconsin Film Studies\n\nPatrick McGilligan, Series Editor\n\nAwarded the Best French Film Book Prize by the Syndicate of French Film Critics\n\nCHOICE Outstanding Academic Title\n\n“Soon to become a classic among film books. . . . A real page turner.”\n\n—La SeptiÃ¨me Obsession, praise for the French edition\n\nFrom 1940 to 1944, the German-owned Continental Films dominated the French film landscape, producing thirty features throughout the Nazi occupation. Charged with producing entertaining and profitable films rather than propaganda, producer Alfred Greven employed some of the greatest French actors and most prestigious directors of the time, including Maurice Tourneur, Henri Decoin, Henri-Georges Clouzot, and Marcel CarnÃ©.\n\nChristine Leteux has produced the most authoritative and complete history of the company and its impact on the French film industry—both during the war and after. She examines not only the formation and management of Continental Films but also the personalities involved, the fraught and often deadly political circumstances of the period, the critical reception of the films, and many of the more notorious and controversial events.\n\nAs Bertrand Tavernier explains in his foreword, Leteux overturns many of the preconceptions and clichÃ©s that have come to be associated with Continental Films. Published to rave reviews in French and translated by the author into English, this work shatters expectations and will reinvigorate study of a lesser-known but significant period of French film history.\n\nPraise\n\n“[A]Â penetrating monograph. . . .Â Leteux writes with a trial lawyerâs precision, packing copious research into just over 200 pages. . . . Leteux has produced a detailed picture of an industry under duress that never bogs down in unnecessary details.”\n\n—Shepherd Express\n\n“The most accurate and dramatic account yet of this remarkable period. . . . Leteuxâs own detective work is extraordinary. With precise prose she illuminates a dark corner of film history where for too long rumours and lies have subsumed the facts.”\n\n—Sight & Sound\n\n“Well-informed and engaging. . . . Leteux deftly handles both the cinematic, moral, and political complexities which Continental had to navigate.”\n\n—Cineaste\n\n“Captivating. . . . Leteuxâs book is equally good at the wide-angle picture of a country and a film industry at war, and the small, unexpected detail. . . . One can only agree with Bertrand Tavernierâs enthusiastic foreword and share his âjubilationâ at this enlightening and, in spite of its dark and tragic setting, entertaining book.”\n\n—The Times Literary Supplement\n\n“In chapter after chapter, Leteux reveals astonishing facts about Continentalâs history, personnel, and productions. Her engrossing, impeccably researched book adds nuance to the picture of filmmaking in occupied France and is a necessary corrective to more simplistic treatments of the subject. . . . Highly recommended.”\n\n—CHOICE Reviews\n\n“[A] lively, fine-grained history. . . . Full of revealing personal, sometimes painfully insightful stories. . . . Â Continental Films reveals a nation and industry in turmoil, but it never reduces any institution or person to a simple summary or limited set of traits. The Occupation was a horribly messy affair and Leteux presents it in new light with her spell-binding historical study.”\n\n—The French Review\n\nPraise for the French edition\n\n“A striking 400-page âfeature filmâ as precise as the mechanics of a vintage Simplex projector. âIâve been waiting for such a book for years,â exclaims Bertrand Tavernier in the foreword. He is not the only one.”\n\n—Le Canard EnchaÃ®nÃ©\n\n“Provides a fascinating panorama, embodied, unexpected, confused, and illuminating.”\n\n—Le Figaro"
