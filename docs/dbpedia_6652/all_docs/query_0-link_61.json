        "text": "The Draw: A love letter to Montmartre, Paris' art/bohemian district, as told through the eyes of one of cinema's most bewitching ingénues.\n\nThe Fact: Yes, the views from the top of Sacré-Coeur really are that spectacular — even without Jean-Pierre Jeunet's ambitious color correction.\n\nThe Fiction: The new owners of Café des Deux Moulins have done some remodeling. So you can still dig into crème brûlée, but don't plan on buying a packet of smokes on the way out.\n\nThe Draw: Alex (Romain Duris) is a nice guy with a dirty job — breaking up unhappy relationships. His mission: Accompany Juliette (Vanessa Paradis) to Monaco and prevent her from marrying her English boyfriend.\n\nThe Fact: Here's hoping Alex is paid well for his work. A noted tax haven, the cost of living in Monaco is not for the faint of heart.\n\nThe Fiction: In one of the world's most beautiful principalities, who takes that long to fall in love with Romain Duris?\n\nThe Draw: Two pathologically shy chocolate makers fall in love. Can they keep it together and launch a new product line?\n\nThe Fact: France is a chocoholic mecca. (Names of note: Abanico, Valrhona, Richart.)\n\nThe Fiction: Belgium would dispute the superiority of French chocolate.\n\nThe Draw: It's 1958. A suave older man (Romain Duris) takes a younger village girl (Déborah François) under his wing with the hopes of turning her into the world's fastest typist. It's basically My Fair Lady en français.\n\nThe Fact: A fairly accurate representation of fashion and life in 1950s France. Who wouldn't want to live in a time when typing competitions were en vogue?\n\nThe Fiction: None. We're choosing to live in the world, kitsch be damned. Bye-bye, 2014.\n\nThe Draw: A fussy middle-aged bachelor gives into pressure from his overbearing mother and sisters to marry. He hires Charlotte Gainsbourg to be the ultimate fiancée from hell. You can probably guess where this one is going, but it's fun watching them get there.\n\nThe Fact: In France, marriages are only legally recognized if they're performed at city hall.\n\nThe Fiction: The capital of the Paris perfume industry isn't Paris, but rather Grasse, a small town northwest of Nice.\n\nThe Draw: Marion and Jack visit Paris after a disastrous trip to Italy. They may not be soulmates, but their long breakup over the course of two days features enough post-Woody Allen bon mots that you kinda wish they were.\n\nThe Fact: Jim Morrison's grave in Père Lachaise really does draw that many crazy fans. The French hate it and often threaten to posthumously deport the musician.\n\nThe Fiction: No cabbie in Paris is that talkative.\n\nThe Draw: A student from France travels to Spain to have the ultimate semester abroad. (And, oh yeah, learn the language too.)\n\nThe Fact: Only 10% of American students study abroad. (Really, guys? Look what you're missing out on!)\n\nThe Fiction: None. The film about sums up the exchange-student experience. (Sorry Mom, Dad.)\n\nThe Draw: Félix Mandel is a spacey astrophysicist prone to flights of fantasy. But even he is shocked when he gets a call (collect) from his late father with one final request.\n\nThe Fact: 39% of France claims to have no belief in life after death.\n\nThe Fiction: We always imagined the dearly departed were more likely to send a text message.\n\nThe Draw: A treasure trove of sight gags, The Fairy is the story of, well, a real-life fairy that drops into a lonely hotel clerk's life, grants him three wishes, and disappears. And that's just act one.\n\nThe Fact: Like near-silent comedy? This film has the DNA of Mon Oncle running in its veins.\n\nThe Fiction: Don't believe anyone who says magic isn't real — the French have a strong tradition of fairy tales.\n\nThe Draw: When a stripper's boyfriend vetoes the idea of having a child, she turns to the next best thing — her man's best friend.\n\nThe Fact: Director Jean-Luc Godard had his romantic priorities in the right place, once famously remarking, \"I don't think you should FEEL about a movie. You should feel about a woman. You can't kiss a movie.\"\n\nThe Fiction: Anna Karina plays a striptease artist, but evidence suggests that she wasn't comfortable with nudity. She turned down a bit part in Breathless, another of Godard's films, because she'd have to take her clothes off.\n\nThe Draw: When the fate of the Middle East is at stake, who are you gonna call? France's answer to James Bond, OSS 117.\n\nThe Fact: Recognize the two stars? Yup, that's The Artist's Bérénice Bejo and Jean Dujardin in their first on-screen meeting. (Here's to many more.)\n\nThe Fiction: As pointed out by IMDB: The film is set in 1955, but many of the cars we see are from the 1960s. Of course, it's a farce — so take inaccuracies with a grain of salt.\n\nThe Draw: A young man with a criminal record strikes up an unlikely friendship with his quadriplegic employer. Dare you not to cry.\n\nThe Fact: 5% of the profits from the film were donated to the Association Simon of Cyrene, an organization that creates shared living spaces for disabled adults and friends.\n\nThe Fiction: It's hard to fault a film so heartwarming, and François Cluzet's performance was certainly above reproach. But we would love to see more actors with disabilities.\n\nThe Draw: A plucky cat living a double life comes to the rescue of his little girl owner when she's kidnapped by a gangster. Toss this one on next time you're babysitting your precocious niece. The Academy Award–nominated animated film features both beautiful depictions of Paris and a truly charming story.\n\nThe Fact: Last year Paris opened its first \"Cat Café.\"\n\nThe Fiction: Paris is more of a dog city.\n\nThe Draw: A documentary about French pastry chefs. Do we really need to spell out the appeal?\n\nThe Fact: France is the birthplace of the dessert. The word \"dessert\" is derived from the French word \"desservir,\" meaning \"to clear the table.\"\n\nThe Fiction: French women do get fat. The obesity rates in the country doubled between 1995 and 2004.\n\nThe Draw: A love triangle? Child's play. Try tracking six star-crossed lovers.\n\nThe Fact: Google \"Why is France so romantic\" and you'll find 85 million hits. Clearly the country has a certain \"je ne sais quoi\" that can't be denied.\n\nThe Fiction: English is taught in French schools beginning at about age 6."
