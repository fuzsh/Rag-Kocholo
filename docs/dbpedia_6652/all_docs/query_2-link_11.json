        "text": "Harry Connick Jr - 'It Had To Be You' (When Harry Met Sally)\n\nHarry Connick Jr. - It Had to Be You\n\nThe soundtrack to this 1988 romcom staple featured many easy listening and jazz icons from Frank Sinatra to Ella Fitzgerald.\n\nA young Harry Connick Jr also provided covers of various standards, including this brilliant version of a classic.\n\nElvis Costello - 'She' (Notting Hill)\n\nElvis Costello 'She'\n\nElvis Costello recorded a cover of Charles Aznavour's classic ballad for the 1999 Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts romcom.\n\nThe song was featured in both the opening and closing credits, and perfectly summed up the mood of the film. Surreal, but nice.\n\nGlen Hansard and Markéta Irglová - 'Falling Slowly' (Once)\n\nGlen Hansard, Marketa Irglova - Falling Slowly (Video)\n\nFirst appearing on The Swell Season’s self-titled album, it was later used by the duo in their musical movie Once in 2007.\n\nThe song won the Oscar for Best Original Song, and was later used in the Broadway and West End stage adaptations. In the movie, the duo play the song in Walton’s music shop in Dublin, with Hansard on guitar and Irglová on piano.\n\nCeline Dion - 'My Heart Will Go On' (Titanic)\n\nCeline Dion - My Heart Will Go On (HD)\n\nTaken from the soundtrack to Titanic, this is Celine's most successful of all time, largely thanks to its use in the humongous romantic drama starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet.\n\nDion said retrospectively: \"'My Heart Will Go On' gave me the opportunity to be associated with a classic that will live forever\".\n\nDes'ree - Kissing You (Romeo and Juliet)\n\nRomeo + Juliet (1996) - Love at First Sight Scene (1/5) | Movieclips\n\nThis song was famously featured in Romeo and Juliet when Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes's title characters first meet at a ball.\n\nDes'ree herself featured in the scene performing the song, and it gave her one of her biggest ever hits. May we say, underrated?\n\nSixpence None the Richer - 'Kiss Me' (She's All That)\n\nSixpence None The Richer - Kiss Me (Official HQ)\n\nThis song was originally released in 1998, but received bigger attention after being used as the main them of teen comedy She's All That a year later.\n\nThis helped the song become one of the ultimate love songs of the 1990s, and takes us back to our imaginary American high school days.\n\nJoe Cocker and Jennifer Warnes - 'Up Where We Belong' (An Officer and a Gentleman)\n\nJoe Cocker & Jennifer Warnes - Up Where We Belong (Officer, Gentleman & Top Gun)\n\nIt's impossible to hear this song and not think of Richard Gere in his navy whites in An Officer and a Gentleman.\n\nThis duet topped the US charts and won an Oscar, though producer Don Simpson was apparently convinced it would be a flop. Hindsight, eh?\n\nLady Gaga and Bradley Cooper - 'Shallow' (A Star is Born)\n\nLady Gaga, Bradley Cooper - Shallow (A Star Is Born)\n\nBarbra Streisand already had huge success with her '70s version of A Star is Born, including the song 'Evergreen'. But Gaga and Cooper had their own triumph with their 2018 remake.\n\nRead more: The Story of... 'Shallow'\n\n'Shallow' was one of many hugely popular songs from the soundtrack, and the heartbreaking ballad reached number one in the UK.\n\nRoxette - 'It Must Have Been Love' (Pretty Woman)\n\nPretty Woman • It Must Have Been Love • Roxette\n\nIt's easy to forget that this song first found fame after its use in the classic Julia Roberts and Richard Gere romcom.\n\nIt helped give Roxette their biggest ever hit and brought them international fame.\n\nGoo Goo Dolls - 'Iris' (City of Angels)\n\nGoo Goo Dolls - Iris [Official Music Video]\n\nThe Story of... 'Iris'\n\nOne of the greatest '90s power ballads, this track was used in the Nicolas Cage and Meg Ryan drama City of Angels in 1998.\n\nSongwriter John Rzeznik said: \"I was thinking about the situation of the Nicolas Cage character in the movie. This guy is completely willing to give up his own immortality, just to be able to feel something very human.\n\n\"And I think, 'Wow! What an amazing thing it must be like to love someone so much that you give up everything to be with them.' That's a pretty heavy thought.\"\n\nPhil Collins - 'Against All Odds' (Against All Odds)\n\nPhil Collins \"Against All Odds\"\n\nPhil Collins wrote this song for the 1984 romance movie of the same name.\n\nRead more: The Story of... 'Against All Odds'\n\nCollins watched the movie on a videocassette recorder in his hotel room and agreed to appear on the soundtrack, and the song has arguably had more of a legacy than the film itself.\n\nBerlin - 'Take My Breath Away' (Top Gun)\n\nTop Gun • Take My Breath Away • Berlin\n\nThe ultimate '80s movie power ballad, this song was recorded for the Tom Cruise action classic in 1986.\n\nRead more: The Story of... 'Take My Breath Away'\n\nIt won Berlin an Oscar and Golden Globe for Best Song that year, and rightly so.\n\nWet Wet Wet - 'Love is All Around' (Four Weddings and a Funeral)\n\nWet Wet Wet - Love Is All Around\n\nWet Wet Wet nearly broke Bryan Adams' record of 16 weeks at number one, as they took over 1994 with their cover of The Troggs' classic.\n\nRead more: The Story of... 'Love is All Around'\n\nThe song was brought back (sort of) for director Richard Curtis's film Love Actually, with Bill Nighy's Billy Mack giving it a festive twist.\n\nThe Righteous Brothers - 'Unchained Melody (Ghost)\n\nRighteous Brothers - Unchained Melody ('Ghost' Soundtrack)\n\nMany artists recorded this ballad over the years, but The Righteous Brothers have the definitive version.\n\nRead more: The Story of... 'Unchained Melody'\n\nIt found a new lease of life in 1990, when it was used in Ghost starring Patrick Swayze and Demi Moore. Pottery was never the same again.\n\nOlivia Newton-John - 'Hopelessly Devoted to You' (Grease)\n\nGrease - Hopelessly Devoted to You [1080p] [Lyrics]\n\nOut of all the classic songs from Grease, this one still makes us feel all warm inside.\n\nHalfway through shooting the movie, Olivia's contractually-entitled vocal solo had yet to be written.\n\nJohn Farrar, Newton-John's producer, wrote the song and gave it to the film's team. Although reluctant, they eventually approved it, and recorded the scene after the other parts of the film had been completed.\n\nBryan Adams - 'Everything I Do (I Do It For You)' (Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves)\n\n(Everything I Do) I Do It For You (Official Music Video)\n\nYou can't argue with 16 weeks at number one, which is still the record the consecutive weeks at the top to this day.\n\nRead more: The Story of... 'Everything I Do'\n\nBryan Adams recorded the song for the Kevin Costner action caper, and you couldn't escape it in 1991.\n\nPatrick Swayze - 'She's Like the Wind' (Dirty Dancing)\n\nDIRTY DANCING \"She's Like The Wind\"\n\nPatrick Swayze wrote this ballad for another movie, but it was eventually used for the soundtrack of arguably his biggest film, Dirty Dancing.\n\nRead more: The Story of... 'She's Like the Wind'\n\nThe song features in the film when Johnny (Swayze) and Baby (Jennifer Grey) part ways in the middle of the film, and became a surprise hit for the actor.\n\nSeal - 'Kiss From a Rose' (Batman Forever)\n\nSeal - Kiss From A Rose (Official Music Video 720p HD) + Lyrics\n\nThis song was written in 1987, but weirdly, Seal felt “embarrassed by it” and “threw the tape in the corner”.\n\nRead more: The Story of... 'Kiss From a Rose'\n\nIt was later used in the soundtrack for Batman Forever in 1995. Director Joel Schumacher called Seal to request the song to play over a love scene. However, it was instead used to play over the end credits, which helped it reach number one in the States that year.\n\nAerosmith - 'I Don't Want to Miss a Thing' (Armageddon)\n\nAerosmith - I Don't Want to Miss a Thing (Official Music Video)\n\nNo-one saw this one coming, a sudden top five hit from stadium veteran rockers Aerosmith.\n\nRead more: The Story of... 'I Don't Want to Miss a Thing'\n\nThe power ballad featured in frontman Steven Tyler's daughter Liv Tyler's latest movie Armageddon, and it remains their all-time biggest hit in the UK."
