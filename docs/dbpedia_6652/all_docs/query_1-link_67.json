        "text": "In French, you use specific subject pronouns for it/he/she/they depending on what they refer to.\n\nThe subject pronouns \"it/he/she/they\" in French\n\nIl means he or it (for a masculine noun)\n\nJean travaille dans le club. - Il travaille dans le club.Jean works in the club. - He works in the club.\n\nLe stylo est sur la table. - Il est sur la table.The pen is on the table. - It is on the table.\n\nElle means she or it (for a feminine noun)\n\nLa fleur est jolie. - Elle est jolie.The flower is pretty. - It is pretty.\n\nIls means they (for masculine or mixed plural nouns)\n\nJean et Paul vont au cinéma. - Ils vont au cinéma.Jean and Paul are going to the cinema. - They are going to the cinema.\n\nElles means they or them (when every one of the group are female or feminine nouns)\n\nLes fleurs sont jolies. - Elles sont jolies.The flowers are pretty. - They are pretty.\n\nSee also \"C'est\" vs \"Il/Elle est\" to say it is/she is/he is in French\n\nGrammar note: Pronouns are general words that replace specific nouns in sentences. A verb has a subject (the person or thing doing the verb), and may have an object (the thing being done to). Subject pronouns are usually different to object pronouns, so you cannot use one to replace the other (in English it can be either, but French uses distinct words) .\n\nSubject - Verb - Object\n\n(sub) Jean (verb) kicks (obj) the ball > (subj pron) He (verb) kicks (obj pron) it\n\nWant to make sure your French sounds confident?
