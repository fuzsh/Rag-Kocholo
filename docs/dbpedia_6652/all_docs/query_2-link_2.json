It is an international co-production between the United Kingdom and the United States. Set in 1989, the film's plot follows the lesbian relationship between a reclusive gym manager, who is part of a crime family, and an ambitious bodybuilder who gets wrapped up in organized crime.\n\nLove Lies Bleeding premiered at the Sundance Film Festival on January 20, 2024. It was released theatrically in the United States by A24 on March 8, 2024, and in the United Kingdom by Lionsgate UK on May 3, 2024. The film received positive reviews from critics.\n\nPlot\n\n[edit]\n\nIn a rural New Mexican town in 1989, reclusive gym manager Lou manages relationships with her sister Beth, Beth's husband JJ, and flirtatious friend Daisy. One night while at the gym, Lou is approached by FBI agents in search of information about Lou’s estranged father, Lou Sr., and his criminal ties. Shortly after, Lou meets Jackie, a bisexual bodybuilder staying in town while preparing for a competition in Las Vegas. Lou offers Jackie steroids to enhance her training and though she initially refuses, Jackie agrees. After a night of lovemaking, Jackie and Lou move in together. They fall in love over the following weeks as Jackie uses increasingly high doses of steroids during her training.\n\nJackie and Lou attend an awkward dinner with JJ and Beth, during which Lou threatens JJ over his abusive behavior towards Beth. In retaliation, JJ reveals he and Jackie had sex during her first night in town in exchange for a waitressing position at Lou Sr.’s gun range. Disgusted and angry, Lou tells Jackie that she wants to kill JJ because of his abuse of Beth, who is the only reason Lou hasn’t left town.\n\nThe next day, Beth is hospitalized due to severe abuse inflicted by JJ. At the bedside, Lou Sr. promises to protect Beth and deal with JJ. Unable to contain her rage due to steroid use, Jackie secretly breaks into Beth and JJ's home and brutally beats the latter to death. Lou discovers JJ's body, and fearing Jackie will be arrested, plots to frame her father for the murder. With Jackie's help, Lou drives JJ's car and body into a ravine revealed to be a disposal site for the bodies of Lou Sr.'s various criminal enemies. The pair light the car on fire, creating a massive smoke plume that successfully attracts authorities to the site the following morning.\n\nThe next day, Lou returns to JJ and Beth's home to clean up evidence of the murder while Jackie continues her steroid use, growing more agitated. After an argument, Jackie leaves Lou and hitchhikes to Las Vegas for the bodybuilding competition. During her individual routine, Jackie hallucinates vomiting up a fully grown Lou before assaulting another contestant, leading to her arrest.\n\nMeanwhile, armed with knowledge of Lou and Jackie's involvement with JJ's murder after spotting the duo driving to the ravine the night before, Daisy blackmails Lou into a relationship. After Daisy intercepts her phone call to Lou, Jackie contacts Lou Sr. to bail her out of jail. After doing so, Lou Sr. coerces Jackie to kill Daisy, the sole witness to the murder. After shooting Daisy at Lou's apartment, Jackie returns to Lou Sr., only to be knocked unconscious. Lou Sr. calls Lou and tells her that he has arranged for Jackie to take the rap for the deaths of JJ and Daisy, but Lou, who has helped her father kill in the past, announces her intention to cooperate with the FBI investigation if he sets Jackie up.\n\nLou Sr. sends a police officer on his payroll to kill Lou, but she overpowers him before driving to her father's home to rescue Jackie. At Lou Sr.'s manor Beth, who has learned about her involvement with JJ's death, denounces Lou to her face. Lou finds and frees Jackie, but as they try to escape, Lou Sr. shoots Lou in the leg. Jackie, having grown to a gigantic size due to the steroid use, pins down Lou Sr. Lou considers killing him but decides to leave him for the police.\n\nLou and Jackie drive off. The next morning Lou realizes that Daisy is still alive in the truck bed despite her near-fatal wound. She strangles Daisy and dumps her body in a nearby field while Jackie sleeps.\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nKristen Stewart as Louise \"Lou\" Langston, a reclusive gym manager[8]\n\nKaty O'Brian as Jackie Cleaver, a rising bodybuilder[9]\n\nJena Malone as Beth Langston, Lou's sister\n\nAnna Baryshnikov as Daisy, a woman who is obsessed with Lou\n\nDave Franco as J.J., Beth's husband\n\nEd Harris as Lou Langston Sr., Lou's estranged father\n\nProduction\n\n[edit]\n\nLove Lies Bleeding is a co-production between A24 and Film4.

Cain, Jim Thompson, David Lynch, and the Coen Brothers, \"For the most part... manages to transcend its influences enough to remain engaging; sometimes it does something even more interesting with its reference points... Glass borrows liberally but not mindlessly.\"[24] Saffron Maeve, for the Toronto Star, gave the film 3.5 stars out of 4, writing that \"Love Lies Bleeding becomes increasingly convoluted [...] But this narrative estrangement is grounded in intention\".[25]\n\nAccolades\n\n[edit]\n\nAward Date of ceremony Category Recipient(s) Result Ref.
