        "text": "Whether in your personal life or at work, you've probably experienced what itâs like to have people reject your requests. To be told that what you want is unfair, or heavy-handed. And you've likely been in the opposite position as well â pushing back against requests that step on your freedom. This week, we talk to psychologist Benjamin Rosenberg about how we respond to infringements on our sense of autonomy, and how we can avoid sparking this resistance in our interactions with other people.\n\nWhen we meet new people, weâre often drawn to those with a commanding presence or a dazzling personality. But it turns out that a very different trait â humility â is important in the long term. This week, in the first of a two-part discussion, we talk with psychologist Daryl Van Tongeren about different kinds of humility, and how this overlooked quality can play a powerful role in workplace dynamics and romantic relationships.\n\nIn part one of our conversation with psychologist Daryl Van Tongeren, we heard about the power of humility to improve our relationships, make us better leaders, and give us a more grounded sense of self. If you haven't yet heard that episode, it's titled \"The Cure for Self Importance\" â we recommend you start there. In this second part of our conversation with Daryl, we talk about existential humility. He shares how a personal tragedy shaped his thinking about the world, and we explore the challenges and the benefits of being humble when it comes to the biggest questions we confront in life.\n\nIn this episode, Shankar and Daryl talk about an idea known as \"terror management theory,\" which looks at how our fears of death shape how we live, often in extremely subtle ways. Our episode about terror management theory is called \"We're All Gonna Die,\" and you can find it in this podcast feed or at our website: https://hiddenbrain.org/podcast/were-all-gonna-die/\n\nWhen we think about misinformation, we often focus on blatant errors or deliberate attempts to deceive us. But in recent years, social scientists have found that misinformation comes in many flavors â many of which are far more subtle than obvious falsehoods. These forms of misinformation prey on our mental blindspots, and take advantage of our passions and loyalties. This week, economist Alex Edmans explores the many insidious forms of misinformation, and how we can all get better at separating fact from fiction.\n\nUnstructured play gives children the opportunity to imagine, to develop independence, and to learn how to cooperate with others. But over the past few decades, our culture has moved away from this sort of open-ended playtime. We talked about this recently with psychologist Peter Gray,Â and he returns to the show today to answer listeners' questions about how to reintegrate more unstructured playtime into our children's lives.\n\nIf you missed our initial conversation with Peter Gray, you can find it here: https://hiddenbrain.org/podcast/parents-keep-out/\n\nAnd for more on the topics discussed in this episode, check out our episode \"Kinder-Gardening\" with psychologist Alison Gopnik: https://hiddenbrain.org/podcast/kinder-gardening/\n\nWe're always told to reach for that next ring, work that third job, go to that boisterous party after a long day at work. You only live once ... right? But psychologist Netta Weinstein says that when we constantly engage in achievement and distraction, we lose something essential about ourselves. This week, she makes a case for solitude, and examines what happens when we seek a quieter, more reflective interior life."
