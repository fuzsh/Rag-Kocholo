Our courses enable you to explore aspects of French and Francophone culture across a range of complementary course units throughout all years of study.\n\nOur extensive library resources, which include rare manuscripts, a vast French literature collection, and contemporary digital media, will enrich your learning experience.\n\nWhy French Studies at Manchester?\n\nResidence abroad\n\nStudy, work or teach English during your year abroad, thanks to our wide network of partner universities across the French-speaking world, and benefit from our dedicated Residence Abroad support team.\n\nAlongside opportunities to study in France, Belgium or Switzerland, you can also study in Quebec.
