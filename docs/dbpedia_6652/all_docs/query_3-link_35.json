        "text": "Hello! Long time, no chat!\n\nSorry for the silent treatment, guys, school has been American History X curb-stomping the frak out of my brain…metaphorically, of course. Not to worry, though, for Easter candy has revived me!\n\nOn that note, let’s talk about film! Specifically, let’s talk about my semester-long project for film class, Cleo de 5 a 7 (Cleo from 5 to 7).\n\nCleo from 5 to 7 is a French film (if you do not know of my adoration for foreign films, please see my previous blog on “For the Love of Movies!”). The film centers on the two hours that a young singer, Cleo, must wait to hear from her doctor to find out if she has cancer. The young woman spends those two hours contemplating her own mortality and seeking an empathetic ear from her friends, but she receives only apathy and detachment. She finally finds someone to share her fears and thoughts with openly when she meets a soldier who understands what it is like to live under the looming threat of death.\n\nCleo was released in 1962, at the height of the French New Wave, by notable New Wave/Left Bank Movement director, Agnès Varda.\n\nWhat is the French New Wave? Why, I thought you would never ask!\n\n(Disclaimer: I’m about to go all film-major on you guys. Brace yourselves.)\n\nThe term “La Nouvelle Vague,” or “French New Wave,” was coined by journalist Françoise Giroud in 1957 in the journal L’Express through a series of articles published by the magazine.\n\nMichel Marie writes in The French New Wave: An Artistic School that when this term first was introduced to the scene, it was not exclusively linked to cinema, as “the label appeared in a sociological investigation of the phenomenon of the new postwar generation.”\n\nThe term “New Wave” became widely used to describe a group of young French directors new to the scene towards the end of the 1950s. They are best known for their experimental approach in terms of editing and filming techniques. Certain techniques, such as the jump-cut and a tendency towards capturing footage through handheld cameras, were generally identified with the French New Wave directors.\n\nVarda, director of Cleo, is closely affiliated with a subgroup of filmmakers connected to the French New Wave, known as the “Rive Gauche” or the “Left Bank Movement.”\n\nWhile linked to the New Wave, Left Bank directors were known for their own experimental techniques and approaches to film, such as incorporating other art forms into their films (most particularly literature and music) and the extreme long-take. Cleo exemplifies these two classic Left Bank Movement elements.\n\nWhew! Okay, that was tough, I know, but it had to be said so I can explain some things to you guys about this film, and why these two things incorporated into it make it AWESOME.\n\nFirst of all, the incorporation of other art forms.\n\nThe most blatant and noticeable art form outside of film that Varda incorporates into Cleo is music. Throughout the entire film, snippets of songs are imbedded diegetically into the movie, mostly Cleo’s own songs. The diegetic inclusion of Cleo’s music makes it clear that, within society, she is consistently present (Cleo’s music can be heard in a taxi she rides and a coffee shop she walks into) but instead of being a monumental figure, she is simply a cultural flare. Cleo is just like any other pop-singer that we as a society quickly embrace, and then just as rapidly discard for something/someone new.\n\nAs she dejectedly discovers herself, Cleo possesses a fleeting claim to fame, one that might not even leave a lasting impression on the world. As a woman who could be approaching an untimely demise, this is a terrifying prospect, and a very relatable one to the audience. (Who, after all, has not pondered what lasting effect our lives will have on the world, one that could live on after death?) Cleo’s confrontation with her fleeting and seemingly meaningless success and fame parallels the anxiety she feels over her impending death, which she fears will occur much sooner than she had believed it to be.\n\nOne song in particular, entitled “Sans toi” (Without You), shows this conflict within Cleo (the anxiety of death and the fear of leaving no significant effect on the world) as well as how artfully Varda uses the long-take to convey Cleo’s fear.\n\nThe scene, which has no cuts and is one long-take, begins with the camera showing Cleo standing beside a piano as her pianist sits before the instrument and her songwriter stands behind it; out of the three characters in the frame, Cleo is the farthest away from the camera. Once the pianist begins to play the introduction to “Sans toi” and signals for Cleo to sing, however, the camera pans to the left behind the pianist and slowly tracks forward towards the young woman, cutting out the other two and finally settling on Cleo’s profile in a striking extreme close-up. By keeping the camera focused on Cleo’s face alone, Varda forces the audience to confront the young woman’s inner turmoil.\n\nThis is shown further as Cleo breaks the fourth wall and turns her face to look directly into the camera as she sings; the audience is able to see a tear rolling down her cheek. This film technique works with Varda’s overall goal of achieving complete focus on Cleo’s anxiety, but Varda also demonstrates another element of the Left Bank movement by fusing non-diegetic sound with diegetic sound to make a song that only the audience can hear in its full spectrum.\n\nAs the camera zooms closer towards Cleo’s face, non-diegetic instruments are added to the piano. Violins begins to strum along with “Sans toi,” and then flutes are added, until finally it sounds like an orchestra complete with brass and other wind instruments are playing the accompaniment to Cleo’s voice. The song ends, and immediately the camera abruptly zooms out to a standing long-shot of Cleo and the two men; the non-diegetic music disappears, and Cleo stops breaking the fourth wall, inserting herself seamlessly back into the film.\n\nThere are other various things that make this film stand out as one of the greatest examples of the New Wave/Left Bank Movement, such as the incorporation of a short-film “Anna” and experimental camera movements that were typically used with handheld cameras for documentaries, but overall, the coolest tidbit associated with this film that I’d like to leave you with is the fact that the entire film is exactly 90 minutes long…which means that yes, it is set in real time, and it depicts every excruciating minute that Cleo must wait to find out the results of her test. How banging is that? The answer is, “very.”\n\nSo, there you have it, reader. Cleo from 5 to 7. You know I’m a big advocate of foreign film, but this is most certainly one of the oldest ones I’ve ever seen, and needless to say I love it just as much as I love any other foreign film. Which means, a lot.\n\nWith that note, au revoir!\n\n(That means “see you again,” or “til next time,” so, yeah, come back real soon now, ya’ll.)"
