        "text": "We’ve said this before, but it bears repeating: Netflix subscribers love action movies. That’s why The Union is on top of the list of the most popular movies on Netflix for the second week in a row. For a Netflix original, that’s a rare feat. Just ask Zack Snyder about that. Animation is a big draw as well, and Illumination’s Migration is also flying up the charts in its first few days on Netflix.\n\nSpeaking of animation, seven out of the top 10 titles on Netflix are animated films, including the perennial favorite The Super Mario Bros. Movie. That flick has rarely left the top 10 since it arrived on Netflix in December. But it’s only going to be hanging around through October before heading back to Peacock.\n\nKeep reading for the rest of our picks for the best movies on Netflix right now. We update this list every Friday so you’ll always have fresh options when planning out your weekend movie nights.\n\nLooking for something else? We’ve also rounded up the best shows on Netflix, the best movies on Hulu, the best movies on Amazon Prime, and the best movies on Disney+. For Netflix fans, check out the 10 most popular movies on Netflix right now.\n\nWatching from abroad? Use a Netflix VPN to access your country’s catalog from anywhere in the world.

Simmons\n\nDirected by\n\nJulian Farino\n\nWatch on Netflix\n\nMike McKenna (Flight Risk‘s Mark Wahlberg) never really expected to see his high school sweetheart, Roxanne Hall (Halle Berry), ever again. But their paths converge in the action comedy called The Union because Roxanne needs someone she can trust. During the last two decades, Roxanne has become a secret agent of immeasurable skill, but most of her colleagues have been killed after their identities were exposed.\n\nRoxanne gives Mike a chance to become a spy because she knows she can rely on him. Compared to Roxanne, Mike is really winging it as their mission takes them all over Europe. But there may just be something left in their romantic connection if they can both make it home alive.\n\nMigration (2023)\n\n56%\n\n6.6/10\n\npg\n\n83m\n\nGenre\n\nAnimation, Action, Adventure, Comedy, Family\n\nStars\n\nKumail Nanjiani, Elizabeth Banks, Caspar Jennings\n\nDirected by\n\nBenjamin Renner\n\nWatch on Netflix\n\nFor Illumination’s first film after The Super Mario Bros. Movie, the studio took to the skies with Migration. Kumail Nanjiani lends his voice to the film as Mack Mallard, a duck who is married to Pam (Elizabeth Banks) and the father of their children, Dax (Caspar Jennings) and Gwen (Tresi Gazal).\n\nAfter spending their whole lives in a New England pond, Mack’s wife and kids convince him, and their curmudgeonly relative, Uncle Dan (Danny DeVito), to go on the trip of a lifetime to Jamaica by way of New York City. That trip is easier said than done for these first-time migrators. But if the family can stick together, they might just pull this off.\n\nOther Netflix Movies\n\nPearl (2022)\n\n76%\n\n7.0/10\n\nr\n\n102m\n\nGenre\n\nHorror, Drama\n\nStars\n\nMia Goth, David Corenswet, Tandi Wright\n\nDirected by\n\nTi West\n\nWatch on Netflix\n\nPearl is both the prequel to Ti West’s X and the name of the character played by Mia Goth. During World War I, Pearl is left at home by her husband with her overbearing mother, Ruth (Tandi Wright), and her nearly infirm father (Matthew Sunderland).\n\nThe movie makes it clear pretty early on that Pearl makes Hannibal Lecter seem well-adjusted. Pearl is so convinced that she’s got what it takes to be a movie star that she completely breaks from reality. And even the affections of a local projectionist (David Corenswet) can’t keep Pearl from going off the deep end.\n\nNight School (2018)\n\n43%\n\n5.6/10\n\npg-13\n\n111m\n\nGenre\n\nComedy\n\nStars\n\nKevin Hart, Tiffany Haddish, Rob Riggle\n\nDirected by\n\nMalcolm D. Lee\n\nWatch on Netflix\n\nTeddy Walker (Borderlands star Kevin Hart) had it all in Night School, including a successful job as a salesman and the love of a beautiful and wealthy woman, Lisa King (Megalyn Echikunwoke). But one major mistake leaves Teddy out of work and unable to get another job of the same caliber because he never graduated high school.\n\nIn the hope of keeping Lisa in the dark about his misfortune, Teddy enrolls in night school at the local high school, which is taught by Carrie Carter (Tiffany Haddish). Teddy eventually befriends his classmates and Carrie, but he’ll need to confront some things about himself if he wants to make it through the class.\n\nJack Reacher: Never Go Back (2016)\n\n47%\n\n6.1/10\n\npg-13\n\n118m\n\nGenre\n\nAction, Thriller\n\nStars\n\nTom Cruise, Cobie Smulders, Danika Yarosh\n\nDirected by\n\nEdward Zwick\n\nWatch on Netflix\n\nTom Cruise walks tall and plays bigger in his second turn as Jack Reacher in the action sequel Jack Reacher: Never Go Back. After remotely working with his ally Major Susan Turner (Cobie Smulders), Jack (Cruise) is informed that she’s imprisoned for murder. Jack also learns that he may be the father of a teenager named Samantha (Danika Yarosh).\n\nWhile trying to prove Susan’s innocence, Jack finds himself framed and imprisoned for murder as well. That’s only a minor inconvenience for Jack, but he’ll still have to clear his name and protect Susan and Samantha from an assassin known as The Hunter (Patrick Heusinger).\n\nRED (2010)\n\n67%\n\n7.0/10\n\npg-13\n\n111m\n\nGenre\n\nAction, Adventure, Comedy, Crime, Thriller\n\nStars\n\nBruce Willis, John Malkovich, Morgan Freeman\n\nDirected by\n\nRobert Schwentke\n\nWatch on Netflix\n\nIn the latter decades of his career, Bruce Willis appeared in a lot of bad movies. Red was a welcome respite from his direct-to-video era. Plus, any movie with a cast that includes Morgan Freeman, John Malkovich, Helen Mirren, and Karl Urban always deserves a second look.\n\nWillis plays Frank Moses, an ex-CIA agent who is classified as Retired, Extremely Dangerous. Frank knows too much, and that’s why someone in the agency wants him dead. That forces Frank to go on the run with a woman he likes, Sarah Ross (Mary-Louise Parker), even though she doesn’t immediately reciprocate his feelings. Frank also has to get some of his old allies together, including Joe Matheson (Freeman), Marvin Boggs (Malkovich), and Vicky Winslow (Mirren) together to get the CIA off his back.\n\nGhostbusters: Frozen Empire (2024)\n\n46%\n\n6.1/10\n\npg-13\n\n115m\n\nGenre\n\nFantasy, Adventure, Comedy\n\nStars\n\nMckenna Grace, Paul Rudd, Carrie Coon\n\nDirected by\n\nGil Kenan\n\nWatch on Netflix\n\nUnlike the previous sequel, Ghostbusters: Afterlife, the original Ghostbusters, Peter Venkman (Bill Murray), Winston Zeddemore (Ernie Hudson), and Ray Stantz (Dan Aykroyd), get to play larger roles alongside the current generation of Ghostbusters in Frozen Empire. Under the guidance of Gary Grooberson (Paul Rudd) and Callie Spengler (Carrie Coon), Phoebe Spengler (Mckenna Grace) and her brother, Trevor (Finn Wolfhard), have come to New York to develop new technology for busting ghosts.\n\nThe Ghostbusters are going to need all of the tech help they can get when an ancient spirit unleashes a new ice age on New York City. And if they can’t stop it, then the whole world may fall to this frozen empire.\n\nFind Me Falling (2024)\n\n50%\n\n6.5/10\n\npg-13\n\n94m\n\nGenre\n\nRomance, Comedy, Music\n\nStars\n\nHarry Connick Jr., Agni Scott, Ali Fumiko Whitney\n\nDirected by\n\nStelana Kliris\n\nWatch on Netflix\n\nSecond chances are all too rare in life, and John (Harry Connick Jr.) really needs one in the rom-com Find Me Falling. Unfortunately for John, his choice location for a respite from his failing music career is a place where some of the locals choose to commit suicide.\n\nJohn’s old flame, Sia (Agni Scott), is also living nearby, and she inspired his biggest hit song before their relationship was shattered. Sia has been keeping a secret from John, but there’s more than enough mutual resentment between them to keep them apart. But there’s also a love that hasn’t died, and it may still lead them back to each other.\n\nBone Tomahawk (2015)\n\n73%\n\n7.1/10\n\n133m\n\nGenre\n\nWestern, Horror, Drama\n\nStars\n\nKurt Russell, Patrick Wilson, Richard Jenkins\n\nDirected by\n\nS. Craig Zahler\n\nWatch on Netflix\n\nBone Tomahawk is an indie Western that brings Kurt Russell back to the genre as Sheriff Franklin Hunt. In 1890, Hunt’s small town of Bright Hope is rocked by the abductions of an outlaw called Purvis (David Arquette), a deputy named Nick (Evan Jonigkeit), and a young woman, Samantha O’Dwyer (Lili Simmons). This unlikely trio has been taken by a renegade native tribe that is known for eating its victims.\n\nRather than abandoning the victims to their fate, Hunt, John Brooder (Matthew Fox), and others form a rescue party to bring them back home. But as they venture deeper into dangerous territory, the posse finds themselves facing threats on all sides, which may make a safe return impossible.\n\nAmerican Psycho (2000)\n\n64%\n\n7.6/10\n\nr\n\n102m\n\nGenre\n\nThriller, Drama, Crime\n\nStars\n\nChristian Bale, Justin Theroux, Josh Lucas\n\nDirected by\n\nMary Harron\n\nWatch on Netflix\n\nNearly a quarter century ago, Christian Bale played Patrick Bateman in American Psycho, and it may still be the actor’s darkest character to date. In 1987, Patrick outwardly has it all as an investment banker with a beautiful fiancée, Evelyn Williams (Reese Witherspoon). Except Patrick hates Evelyn and he’s insanely jealous of his co-workers, especially Paul Allen (Jared Leto).\n\nAnd when we say “insanely,” that doesn’t cover it all. Patrick doesn’t need much to work up to murdering someone. But as more people are targeted by Patrick, he draws some very unwelcome attention from the police.\n\nBeverly Hills Cop: Axel F (2024)\n\n54%\n\n6.7/10\n\nr\n\n118m\n\nGenre\n\nAction, Comedy, Crime\n\nStars\n\nEddie Murphy, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Taylour Paige\n\nDirected by\n\nMark Molloy\n\nWatch on Netflix\n\nBeverly Hills Cop: Axel F puts Eddie Murphy back into the title role for the first time since 1994. Axel Foley is a Detroit cop who has barged into Beverly Hills’ jurisdiction on a case three times before. And Beverly Hills Police Captain Cade Grant (Kevin Bacon) is really upset that Axel is at it again.\n\nAxel doesn’t care about the consequences because this is personal. Someone is targeting his adult daughter, Jane Saunders (Taylour Paige), and only her ex-boyfriend, Detective Bobby Abbott (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), is willing to help Axel save her. However, Axel may still have some other friends left in the police department, and he’ll need them when everything comes crashing down on him.\n\nWarcraft (2016)\n\n32%\n\n6.7/10\n\npg-13\n\n123m\n\nGenre\n\nAction, Adventure, Fantasy\n\nStars\n\nTravis Fimmel, Paula Patton, Ben Foster\n\nDirected by\n\nDuncan Jones\n\nWatch on Netflix\n\nWarcraft has a bad reputation among video game movies for trying to do too much with its first film. Admittedly, there is a lot of lore to take in as the orcs attempt to escape destruction on their world, Draenor, by traveling through portals to a world called Azeroth, which is largely populated by humans. While the horde of orcs attacks Azeroth’s people, not all of the orcs are vicious killers. Durotan (Toby Kebbell) is a noble orc chieftain who has reasons to believe that his people have been misled.\n\nMeanwhile, Anduin Lothar (Travis Fimmel) attempts to rally the people of Azeroth in defense of their world. But amid an overwhelming threat against orcs and humans alike, Lothar may have to come to terms with Durotan so they can stand against their mutual enemies.\n\nPokémon Detective Pikachu (2019)\n\n53%\n\n6.5/10\n\npg\n\n105m\n\nGenre\n\nAction, Adventure, Fantasy\n\nStars\n\nRyan Reynolds, Justice Smith, Kathryn Newton\n\nDirected by\n\nRob Letterman\n\nWatch on Netflix\n\nFor a movie that is based on a video game franchise, Pokémon: Detective Pikachu is surprisingly friendly to first-time viewers who know nothing about the small Pokémon monsters that are pitted in battles against each other for the amusement of humans. In Ryme City, humans and Pokémon live together and enslaving the creatures is against the law.\n\nWhen Ryme City police detective Harry Goodman is missing and presumed dead, his estranged son, Tim Goodman (Justice Smith), is shocked to discover that he can understand his father’s partner, Detective Pikachu, who is voiced by Deadpool & Wolverine’s Ryan Reynolds. Tim and Pikachu soon realize that they’ll have to team up and uncover a conspiracy if they ever hope to find Harry again.\n\nFifty Shades of Grey (2015)\n\n46%\n\n4.2/10\n\nr\n\n125m\n\nGenre\n\nDrama, Romance, Thriller\n\nStars\n\nDakota Johnson, Jamie Dornan, Jennifer Ehle\n\nDirected by\n\nSam Taylor-Johnson\n\nWatch on Hulu\n\nMadame Web was perhaps the only way that Dakota Johnson could ever get people to forget that she was in the Fifty Shades of Grey trilogy. So let’s remind everybody, shall we? The original installment rocketed Johnson to stardom for her role as Anastasia “Ana” Steele, a college student who interviews billionaire Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan) on behalf of her sick friend.\n\nAna and Christian hit it off, and he introduces her to the world of sexual bondage and other kinks that tend to be labeled deviant. Ana accepts Christian’s proclivities at first. But the deeper she gets with Christian, the further he wants to go with his sexual games.\n\nUltraman: Rising (2024)\n\n121m\n\nGenre\n\nAction, Science Fiction, Animation, Family\n\nStars\n\nChristopher Sean, Gedde Watanabe, Tamlyn Tomita\n\nDirected by\n\nShannon Tindle\n\nWatch on Netflix\n\nBringing up a kid is never easy, even for a superhero. Just ask Ken Sato (Christopher Sean), the title hero of Ultraman: Rising. As Ultraman, Ken can grow to giant size, and that’s a power that comes in handy when he’s fighting giant monsters or kaiju.\n\nThe twist in this film is that after a battle with a female kaiju, Ken is left with a dilemma about what to do with her child. The baby kaiju hasn’t done anything wrong. So rather than destroy the creature, Ken is going to attempt to raise the baby himself. It may be the most heroic thing the current Ultraman has ever done, and it’s also going to put Ken through a lot of stress.\n\nHit Man (2024)\n\n83%\n\n7.4/10\n\nr\n\n115m\n\nGenre\n\nComedy, Romance, Crime\n\nStars\n\nGlen Powell, Adria Arjona, Austin Amelio\n\nDirected by\n\nRichard Linklater\n\nWatch on Netflix\n\nRichard Linklater’s Hit Man could have scored a full theatrical release in part because Glen Powell is one of the breakout stars of 2024. But instead, it’s now a Netflix original that was co-written by both Powell and Linklater. The former is headlining the film as Gary Johnson, a man who has found his calling as an undercover operative for the police.\n\nGary pretends to be an assassin, and he helps the police arrest his would-be clients. It’s a good racket for Gary until he meets Maddy Masters (Adria Arjona), a woman who wants her husband killed so she can escape his physical abuse. Maddy is the first “client” that Gary has ever been real with, and he doesn’t want to see her get arrested like his other marks. As much as Gary might try to believe otherwise, helping Maddy and getting emotionally involved with her may bring his life crashing down around him.\n\nGodzilla Minus One (2023)\n\n81%\n\n7.9/10\n\npg-13\n\n125m\n\nGenre\n\nScience Fiction, Horror, Action\n\nStars\n\nRyunosuke Kamiki, Minami Hamabe, Yuki Yamada\n\nDirected by\n\nTakashi Yamazaki\n\nWatch on Netflix\n\nThere is an English dub of Godzilla Minus One on Netflix, but the original Japanese voice track has better performances. This is one of the best Godzilla movies ever made in part because the creature is allowed to be a fearsome monster instead of a heroic giant. It’s also notable for featuring a strong focus on the human side of the story, especially with the main character Kōichi Shikishima (Ryunosuke Kamiki).\n\nIn the last days of World War II, Shikishima can’t bring himself to fulfill his duty as a kamikaze pilot. A chance encounter with Godzilla only brings more shame upon Shikishima. During the aftermath of the war, Shikishima forms an unexpected bond with Noriko Ōishi (Minami Hamabe) and the infant child she adopted. Yet Shikishima’s inability to let go of his regret may destroy him before Godzilla can get around to killing him and everyone else in Japan.\n\nMiller's Girl (2024)\n\n41%\n\n5.2/10\n\nr\n\n93m\n\nGenre\n\nMystery, Thriller, Drama\n\nStars\n\nMartin Freeman, Jenna Ortega, Bashir Salahuddin\n\nDirected by\n\nJade Halley Bartlett\n\nWatch on Netflix\n\nWednesday’s Jenna Ortega stars as the title character in Miller’s Girl, but Cairo Sweet doesn’t really belong to anyone. She’s rich, bored, and extremely creative. In fact, it’s Cairo’s creativity and knowledge that draw the attention of her much older teacher, Jonathan Albert Miller (Martin Freeman), a man who feels trapped by his life choices and by his loveless marriage with Beatrice June Harper (Dagmara Domińczyk).\n\nWhen Cairo writes a story about an intimate affair between a student and her teacher, it sets in motion life-changing events that may spiral out of control for both Cairo and Miller.\n\nAnyone But You (2023)\n\n52%\n\n6.2/10\n\nr\n\n104m\n\nGenre\n\nRomance, Comedy\n\nStars\n\nSydney Sweeney, Glen Powell, Mia Artemis\n\nDirected by\n\nWill Gluck\n\nWatch on Netflix\n\nAnyone but You is one of the rare rom-coms to become a smash hit, while also solidifying Sydney Sweeney as a star … and keeping her out of movie jail for co-starring in Madame Web. Sweeney plays Bea, a young woman who forms an instant connection with a guy named Ben (Twisters star Glen Powell). But after a great first date, things end very badly and they both blame each other.\n\nBea and Ben are unwillingly drawn back into each other’s orbit at the wedding for Halle (Hadley Robinson) and Claudia (Alexandra Shipp). Despite being unhappy about their reunion, Bea and Ben also have their own reasons to make the other guests believe that they’re a couple. And then the sparks start to fly between them again.\n\nAnna (2019)\n\n40%\n\n6.6/10\n\nr\n\n119m\n\nGenre\n\nThriller, Action\n\nStars\n\nSasha Luss, Helen Mirren, Luke Evans\n\nDirected by\n\nLuc Besson\n\nWatch on Netflix\n\nAnna turns back the clock to the end of the Cold War as the title character, Anna Poliatova (Sasha Luss), is drawn into the KGB’s web and trained to become one of the agency’s top operatives. Anna completely gives herself over to the KGB because she’s been promised that this will only be temporary. If Anna completes five years of service, she’ll be free to do anything that she wants.\n\nUnfortunately for Anna, the KGB has no intention of honoring its promise to her. If she wants an exit from this life, then she’ll have to make one herself. And if that means Anna has to broker a deal with CIA agent Leonard Miller (Oppenheimer‘s Cillian Murphy) and betray everyone around her, then so be it.\n\nBaby Driver (2017)\n\n86%\n\n7.5/10\n\nr\n\n113m\n\nGenre\n\nAction, Crime\n\nStars\n\nAnsel Elgort, Kevin Spacey, Lily James\n\nDirected by\n\nEdgar Wright\n\nWatch on Netflix\n\nDon’t let the name Baby Driver fool you into thinking that this is some kid’s flick. Edgar Wright’s action comedy can be downright brutal at times, but it never loses its sense of humor. Ansel Elgort plays the title character, whose real name is Miles. But he’s known professionally as Baby, and he’s an incredible getaway driver who is forced to work for Doc (Kevin Spacey).\n\nAfter Baby seemingly escapes his servitude to Doc, he simply wants to start a new life with his girlfriend, Debora (Lily James). However, Doc won’t let Baby go that easily, and he forces him to take part in one last heist alongside Buddy (Jon Hamm), Darling (Eiza González), and Bats (Jamie Foxx). This crew is far more dangerous than Baby realizes, and he’ll have to think fast if he wants to get out alive.\n\nThe Wages of Fear (2024)\n\nr\n\n104m\n\nGenre\n\nAction, Thriller\n\nStars\n\nFranck Gastambide, Alban Lenoir, Ana Girardot\n\nDirected by\n\nJulien Leclercq\n\nWatch on Netflix\n\nIn 1953, Georges Arnaud’s The Wages of Fear was brought to the big screen by director Henri-Georges Clouzot who turned it into arguably one of the greatest action thrillers ever made. Director Julien Leclercq has a lot to live up to with the modern remake, which is a Netflix exclusive.\n\nThe names and faces may be different, but the story remains largely unchanged from the original. An oil fire is out of control, and the only way to put it out and save lives is with controlled explosions using nitroglycerin. Franck Gastambide, Alban Lenoir, Ana Girardot, and Sofiane Zermani play a group of disparate and desperate individuals who agree to transport the nitroglycerin across hundreds of miles of dangerous terrain. At the end of their journey is a payday that could change their lives forever, assuming they live long enough to get paid.\n\nYour Lucky Day (2023)\n\n64%\n\n5.8/10\n\n89m\n\nGenre\n\nCrime, Thriller\n\nStars\n\nAngus Cloud, Elliot Knight, Jessica Garza\n\nDirected by\n\nDan Brown\n\nWatch on Netflix\n\nWinning the lottery should be one the best days in anyone’s life. But in Your Lucky Day, Sterling (Angus Cloud) didn’t actually win. He killed someone to get his hands on the winning ticket, and he left witnesses: Amir (Mousa Hussein Kraish), Abraham (Elliot Knight), and his girlfriend, Ana-Marlene (Jessica Garza).\n\nNot even Sterling can kill that many people in cold blood, which is why he tries to bargain with them. He’ll share some of the money from the ticket if they help him hide his crime. This plan has multiple problems, but Sterling’s hostages and would-be accomplices simply can’t deter him from this course of action. He’s going to get this lottery money if it’s the last thing he does — and it might be.\n\nDamsel (2024)\n\n46%\n\n7.8/10\n\npg-13\n\n110m\n\nGenre\n\nFantasy, Action, Adventure\n\nStars\n\nMillie Bobby Brown, Nick Robinson, Robin Wright\n\nDirected by\n\nJuan Carlos Fresnadillo\n\nWatch on Netflix\n\nIn Damsel, life’s a fairytale for Princess Elodie (Millie Bobby Brown), a young woman who lives with her father, Lord Bayford (Ray Winstone), and her stepmother, Lady Bayford (Angela Bassett). Elodie doesn’t know much about the way of the world, but she’s smitten with Prince Henry (Nick Robinson), and quickly agrees to marry him.\n\nElodie doesn’t realize that Henry’s mother, Queen Isabelle (Robin Wright), only agreed to the union because her family can sacrifice Elodie’s life to an actual dragon to satisfy a debt. Now, Elodie can’t count on some handsome prince to save her. So she’ll just have to save herself.\n\nSpaceman (2024)\n\n56%\n\n5.8/10\n\nr\n\n108m\n\nGenre\n\nScience Fiction, Drama\n\nStars\n\nAdam Sandler, Paul Dano, Carey Mulligan\n\nDirected by\n\nJohan Renck\n\nWatch on Netflix\n\nAdam Sandler has a rare dramatic turn in Spaceman, a sci-fi drama that casts him as a Czech astronaut named Jakub Procházka. Jakub is on a very long mission in the solar system and suffers from extreme loneliness. Back on Earth, Jakub’s wife, Lenka Procházka (Carey Mulligan), wants to leave him, but the mission controllers refuse to let her break up with him via transmission over fears that it could affect his mental state.\n\nPerhaps it’s too late to save Jakub’s sanity, because he’s already conversing with an alien spider that he calls Hanuš (Paul Dano). It seems like Hanuš has a greater grasp on Jakub’s problem than he does, and Hanuš isn’t above emotionally torturing Jakub with some painful memories to get what he wants. And there may not be a happy ending on this mission for either Jakub or Hanuš.\n\nEverything Everywhere All at Once (2022)\n\n81%\n\n7.8/10\n\nr\n\n140m\n\nGenre\n\nAction, Adventure, Science Fiction\n\nStars\n\nMichelle Yeoh, Stephanie Hsu, Ke Huy Quan\n\nDirected by\n\nDaniel Scheinert, Daniel Kwan\n\nWatch on Netflix\n\nUntil this year’s Oscar ceremony crowns a new winner, Everything Everywhere All At Once is the reigning Best Picture from the Academy Awards. Outside of some Marvel and DC movies, no other film has so effectively used the multiverse as a storytelling device as this one did.\n\nMichelle Yeoh, Ke Huy Quan, and Jamie Lee Curtis all won Oscars for their performances in this movie, but it’s Yeoh’s Evelyn Quan Wang who serves as the film’s main character. Evelyn is about as far from heroic as it gets, and her relationship with her husband, Waymond Wang (Quan), and their daughter, Joy Wang (Stephanie Hsu), is incredibly strained. Regardless, poor and ordinary Evelyn is the only hope that the multiverse has to prevent a disaster.

This film is not the first to tell the story of the survivors of 1972 Uruguayan plane crash, which was most notably the subject of the American film Alive in 1993.\n\nHowever, Bayona’s movie goes to far greater lengths to be authentic than the previous adaptations, including bringing production to the actual site of the crash and utilizing the real accounts of the survivors. Most of the cast members are also newcomers, which works in the film’s favor because it keeps the audience in suspense about who will live, and how far they will go to survive.\n\nThe Equalizer 3 (2023)\n\n58%\n\n6.8/10\n\nr\n\n109m\n\nGenre\n\nAction, Thriller, Crime\n\nStars\n\nDenzel Washington, Dakota Fanning, Eugenio Mastrandrea\n\nDirected by\n\nAntoine Fuqua\n\nWatch on Netflix\n\nDenzel Washington spends so much time sitting down and sipping lattes in The Equalizer 3 that you may start to wonder if the actor himself is injured, and not just his character, Robert McCall.

So what if there was a mere twenty-three-year gap between films? It’s not like chickens can tell time! Although the extended period did leave some major roles to be recast, including Zachary Levi and Thandiwe Newton taking over as Rocky and Ginger from Mel Gibson and Julia Sawalha from the original.\n\nChicken Run: Dawn of the Nugget takes place not too long after the first film, but long enough for Rocky and Ginger to have a daughter named Molly (as voiced by The Last of Us’ Bella Ramsey). The chickens may have escaped from Mrs. Tweedy (Miranda Richardson), but she’s far from through with them. If Ginger wants to keep her family safe, she will have to lead a team to break into Tweedy’s compound and discover what she has in store for them.\n\nThe Super Mario Bros.

Movie pulled off the Herculean feat of making audiences forget all about that live-action Super Mario Bros. film.

Thompson, Kemp Powers\n\nWatch on Netflix\n\nYou could call Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse “amazing, spectacular,” or “sensational” and it would still undersell just how terrific this movie is. Somehow, the team behind the Oscar-winning Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse topped themselves with an even more thrilling sequel that reunites Miles Morales (Shameik Moore) and Gwen Stacy (Hailee Steinfeld).\n\nUnfortunately for the would-be couple, it’s not a happy reunion.
