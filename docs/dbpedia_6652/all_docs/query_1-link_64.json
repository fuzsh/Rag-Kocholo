        "text": "BA IN FILM AND SCREEN MEDIA CK105\n\nBA Director: Dr Abigail Keating, email: abigail.keating@ucc.ie\n\nUniversity College Cork's BA in Film and Screen Media is a unique, major degree that offers students a thorough education on the history, theory, values, aesthetics and ideology of the moving image.\n\nThe philosophy of our BA is that theory, analysis and history must be informed by practice, and that practice must, in turn, be informed by a deep understanding of how cinema and ideas about the moving image have developed. Hence, this unique programme innovatively combines the study of film and of screen media (Internet, mobile social media, e-publishing) and practical filmmaking modules and workshops in digital filmmaking and in writing for the screen.\n\nLed by internationally recognised experts, this BA will immerse students in the history and theory of film and screen media from around the world, from the birth of cinema to the age of the Internet. Students also make films under the guidance of experienced practitioners, and avail of professionalising opportunities provided by the programme's partnership with film festivals such as Schull's Fastnet Short Film Festival. With a thriving component of visiting speakers, guest practitioners and artists in residence, students will have the chance to meet and be taught by professionals of the film industry and by expert speakers from universities and archives from around the world.\n\nStudents may opt into the International Pathway of the BA, and spend third year studying film and screen media, as well as their second subject, at one of our partner universities abroad.\n\nThe BA equips students with the skills for careers in the media, the culture and creative industries, teaching, journalism, or for further study and research at postgraduate level.\n\nFREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS\n\nBefore...\n\nWhy should I study Film and Screen Media?\n\nNowadays, more than ever before, national and international cultures operate, communicate, entertain and celebrate their identities in powerful and important visual ways. Contemporary citizens of the world interact in visually complex ways, and the media that they use work by projecting, merging, distributing, enhancing and displaying images.\n\nWhy should I choose the BA in Film and Screen Media at University College Cork?\n\nUCC is one of Ireland’s most beautiful university campuses and is conveniently situated in the centre of Cork city, a thriving hub of filmmaking and film festivals. This unique programme acknowledges the exciting and growing developments in film and media projects among the creative community in the city and the greater Cork area. With internationally celebrated festivals such as the French Film Festival and the Cork Film Festival, as well as the Fastnet Short Film Festival in Schull, and supporting bodies such as the Cork Film Commission, the area boasts a vibrant active film and media making and viewing community.\n\nThe BA in Film and Screen Media is a unique, innovative programme that combines training in the practice of digital filmmaking with courses on the theories, history and styles of film and other screen media, such as mobile technologies, the Internet and cyberspace, video games, and many others. In this exciting programme you will gain hands-on experience and develop production skills at the same time as you acquire analytical expertise and knowledge of this stimulating subject area. The programme has been designed so that the specialised practical components feed off the analysis-based modules, and the theoretical modules enhance your own digital filmmaking skills. Programme courses that demonstrate the interface of the two areas of study include: “Studies in Cinema: Auteurs and Genre”, “Writing for the Screen”, “Ireland on Screen” and “Making Digital Media”, other modules will cater for an ever-evolving universal media landscape, by considering a variety of technologies and digital mechanisms including those mentioned above.\n\nWhat grades do I need in my Leaving Certificate (or other final year second level graduation results) in order to do the BA in Film and Screen Media?\n\nAs requirements are likely to change from year to year (and from country to country) it is best to consult http://www.ucc.ie/en/ck105/ or http://www.ucc.ie/en/admissions/.\n\nWill I need to have studied film or media in Secondary School?\n\nNo. All of the experience that you will need will be built up, from day one of the programme.\n\nDo I need to pass an interview or other examination process to be accepted onto the programme?\n\nNo.\n\nWhat other subjects go well with my BA in Film and Screen Media?\n\nThere are lists of subjects that you may choose with the BA programme, but not every combination is possible.
