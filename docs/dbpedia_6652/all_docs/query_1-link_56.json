        "text": "You will combine your growing language skills with courses that cover the world, from the French Caribbean via France to the Francophone countries of North and West Africa. You will learn about the history and influence of French in the world, and the legacies of French colonialism. You can explore topics ranging from thought and laughter in the Renaissance to the role of photography in French culture.\n\nYou can study French over five years (Mode A) or four years (Mode B), spending a full academic year or six months in a French-speaking country depending on what suits you best. You might decide to work in Paris or study on the island of La RÃ©union in the Indian Ocean. For both Mode A and Mode B, the first and second years are identical, so you do not need to decide between Mode A and Mode B until December of the second year. We strongly recommend that you apply for the Mode A option in the first instance.\n\nIn Aberdeen, you will thrive in our friendly and dynamic international community, on our beautiful medieval campus with great facilities for learning, sports and leisure, and the many opportunities to develop extra skills and interests, and to gain a competitive advantage for whichever career path you choose. Join the student-run French Society to meet like-minded linguists and enthusiasts for French & Francophone society and culture, and make plans for your time abroad."
