If you are eligible for Access UCL you do not need to do anything in addition to the standard UCAS application. Your application will be automatically flagged when we receive it.\n\nUndergraduate Preparatory Certificates\n\nThe Undergraduate Preparatory Certificates (UPC) prepare international students for a UCL undergraduate degree who don’t have the qualifications to enter directly. These intensive one-year foundation courses are taught on our central London campus.\n\nTypical UPC students will be high achievers in a 12-year school system which does not meet the standard required for direct entry to UCL.\n\nFor more information see: ucl.ac.uk/upc.\n\nEnglish language requirements\n\nThe English language level for this programme is: Level 4\n\nInformation about the evidence required, acceptable qualifications and test providers can be found on our English language requirements page.\n\nA variety of English language programmes are offered at the UCL Centre for Languages & International Education.\n\nCourse overview\n\nYour degree will be studied on a 75/25 ratio between French and Film Studies.\n\nIn your first, second and final year you will take language modules in French and the literature, culture, history and linguistics related to it, as well as modules in Film Studies.\n\nYou will spend your third year abroad in a country where French is spoken, studying at a university, or doing a work placement. You will achieve the same linguistic competence regardless of whether you start a language from beginner level or have previous knowledge of it.\n\nOver the four years, you will deepen your knowledge of the French language and Film theory, while also developing valuable skills in cultural literacy and critical thinking.\n\nWhat this course will give you\n\nWe provide an ideal environment for language study. UCL offers an unparalleled range of languages and state-of-the-art facilities, including a well-equipped language learning suite, and many of our academic staff are renowned leaders in their fields.\n\nThe Year Abroad gives you the chance to attend a university or work overseas. During this time, you will finesse your language skills in French and gain valuable experience which will enhance future learning as well as career prospects.\n\nUCL has a very international population meaning you will meet people from all over the world, which provides numerous opportunities to practise and speak your chosen languages with native speakers and learn about the associated cultures and societies from them.\n\nOur location in London provides access to frequent and varied cultural events, a huge range of museums, galleries, specialist libraries and bookshops, theatres, cinemas, cuisines and cultural societies.\n\nTeaching and learning\n\nIn each year of your degree you will take a number of individual modules, normally valued at 15 or 30 credits, adding up to a total of 120 credits for the year. Modules are assessed in the academic year in which they are taken. The balance of compulsory and optional modules varies from programme to programme and year to year. A 30-credit module is considered equivalent to 15 credits in the European Credit Transfer System (ECTS).\n\nUpon successful completion of 360 credits, you will be awarded a BA (Hons) in French with Film Studies.\n\nModules\n\nPlease note that the list of modules given here is indicative. This information is published a long time in advance of enrolment and module content and availability is subject to change. Modules that are in use for the current academic year are linked for further information. Where no link is present, further information is not yet available.\n\nYou will spend the first two years at UCL gaining expertise in the productive and receptive skills of the French language as well as gaining a more developed understanding of the literature, cinema, politics, linguistics, history, culture and society of the countries where French is spoken, as well as modules in Film Studies.\n\nThere is a compulsory year abroad in Year 3 during which you will spend your time in a country where French is spoken. You may study at a partner university or undertake an approved work placement. The final year is based at UCL where you will continue to study a range of advanced-level modules. A final year dissertation module is available should you wish to undertake a self-initiated project which builds on the independent research skills developed over the course of your programme of study.\n\nWe are keen to ensure that students feel part of our community at UCL and therefore offer programme-specific core modules in Year 1 that students take together with their respective cohort. These offer a broader sense of their chosen discipline and an opportunity to share learning experiences. They also support students to make informed choices for their future years of study to carve out a degree pathway that suits them. Please visit our Undergraduate Modules page for more details.\n\nYour learning\n\nYour language classes focus on developing the active skills of speaking, listening, writing and reading through a variety of methods and media. You will be taught through a combination of lectures and seminars, as well as undertaking web-based study and group work.\n\nDuring Terms 1 and 2, approximately 35% of a student's time is spent in lectures, seminars or tutorials and the remainder in independent study. There is minimal teaching during Term 3, which focuses on examinations and assessment.\n\nAssessment\n\nModules are assessed by a mixture of written and oral examinations, essays and other forms of coursework.\n\nAccessibility\n\nDetails of the accessibility of UCL buildings can be obtained from AccessAble. Further information can also be obtained from the UCL Student Support and Wellbeing team.\n\nThe foundation of your career\n\nPopular career paths for modern language graduates include teaching and education (12.3%), publishing, journalism or translation (11.8%), accountancy and financial services (11.2%), media (4.8%), law (2.7%), PR, advertising, marketing (2.1%) and the civil service (1.6%)*. Employers of our graduates include KPMG, Bloomberg, BBC, Business Insider, Deutsche Bank, Houses of Parliament, Ipsos MORI, L'Oreal, London Theatre Company, Lonely Planet, Teach First, PwC and UK Government.*\n\nSome graduates pursue careers that make special use of their language skills, including translating, interpreting and teaching, while others continue with graduate training, further study or academic research (4.8%).*\n\n*Graduate Outcomes survey carried out by the Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA), looking at the destinations of UK and EU graduates in the 2017-2021 cohorts.\n\nEmployability\n\nThere are many career opportunities for UCL's modern language graduates. We seek to embed within our teaching the acquisition of transferable skills such as leadership, team work and communication skills as well as linguistic and cultural knowledge.\n\n78% of graduates from the School of European Languages, Culture and Society (SELCS) were in work, further study or due to start work or study, 15 months after graduation.*\n\n*Graduate Outcomes survey carried out by the Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA), looking at the destinations of UK and EU graduates in the 2017-2021 cohorts.\n\nFees and funding\n\nFees for this course\n\nUK students International students\n\nFee description Full-time Tuition fees (2024/25) £9,250 Tuition fees (2024/25) £28,100\n\nThe fees indicated are for undergraduate entry in the 2024/25 academic year.

These may be open to all students, or restricted to specific nationalities, regions or academic department.\n\nNext steps\n\nYour application\n\nWe seek to select candidates who, in addition to academic achievement, have the motivation and passion for language learning, for inter-cultural inquiry, and who have a deep commitment to developing and finessing their language proficiency to an advanced level.\n\nHow to apply\n\nApplication for admission should be made through UCAS (the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service). Applicants currently at school or college will be provided with advice on the process; however, applicants who have left school or who are based outside the United Kingdom may obtain information directly from UCAS.\n\nSelection\n\nFor further information on UCL's selection process see: How we assess your application.\n\nOur admissions process aims to assess your linguistic abilities and attainments as well as cultural awareness and intellectual potential. We may interview candidates by telephone in order to establish a level of language ability.\n\nIf your application demonstrates that your academic ability and motivation make you well-suited to our degree and you receive an offer, then we shall invite you to a Post-Offer Open Day, where you will experience the sort of teaching we offer and life in SELCS."
