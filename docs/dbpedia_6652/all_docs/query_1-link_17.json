Then hit enter, leaving the search box empty.\n\nThen on the left side choose language \"French\" and format \"Video DVD\".\n\nYou will also find streaming French Films in our database \"Films on Demand\". Once there go to Collections, then World Languages, choose French. While many are short documentary films there are some full-length videos."
