        "text": "Vive Le France! Happy Bastille Day to all those who celebrate ‚Äî or just want an excuse to eat a croissant today.\n\nPerhaps no other nation outside the U.S. has such a long, vast, and varied cinematic history as France. Historians still quibble about who really invented cinema ‚Äî the French Lumi√®re brothers‚Äô innovations in motion picture exhibition developed largely in tandem with Thomas Edison out in New Jersey. The histories and legacies of our national industries are intertwined in ways that are too manifold to mention in just an intro.\n\nBut a phenomenon I‚Äôve certainly noticed from my dalliances with the Cannes Film Festival many years ago is that the French often think they ‚Äúunderstand‚Äù American cinema better than actual Americans do. Often times, they‚Äôre right on the money. (See: Gray, James.) But today, I thought I‚Äôd flip the script and try to understand the last century of French history through their cinematic output. What follows is a list of ten films, one per decade, that tries to locate the national character through art.\n\n1930s\n\nIt‚Äôs tough to pinpoint what exactly the French poetic realist style in cinema is ‚Äî because it‚Äôs become so diffused into just about everything else that follows, describing it is akin to detailing the flavor of water. In essence, most movies that try to do some slightly heightened version of verit√©-style reality for cinema so a dramatic story can take place within that world have taken some inspiration from this style. It‚Äôs not stagey, but it‚Äôs also something distinct from the world we inhabit.\n\nA great progenitor of this style is Zero for Conduct (available on the Criterion Channel) by Jean Vigo, who unfortunately left far too brief a footprint since he didn‚Äôt make it to 30 years old. This 45-minute work is a rabble-rousing tale of children‚Äôs rebellion at a boarding school. It‚Äôs a lot of anarchic fun that speaks to France‚Äôs unique history of resistance to institutional authority.\n\n1940s\n\nThe outbreak of World War II casts a long shadow over filmmaking in continental Europe, much of which faced Fascist occupation and the decimation of their national industries. But cinema did not grind to a complete halt in Nazi-occupied France, as shown by Henri-Georges Clouzot‚Äôs Le Corbeau (available on the Criterion Channel).\n\nThis grim, shadowy thriller presages the development of the film noir, a style of filmmaking that emerged thanks to the many European emigres into the American studio system. These directors brought with them a grim outlook on individuals‚Äô ability to withstand the pressures of conformity and authority. Clouzot‚Äôs film resembles The Crucible as a French town tears itself apart over accusations and rumors stemming from an anonymous individual known as ‚ÄúThe Raven‚Äù who sends letters to pillars of the community that threaten to divulge their secrets. It‚Äôs not hard to extrapolate what this film is actually about when you consider its historical context and how many people in France were willing to collaborate, or at least remain complicit, with their German invaders.\n\n1950s\n\nThere‚Äôs no way to discuss what cinema is today without bringing up the contributions of the French New Wave. This was the first reflexive generation of filmmakers for whom a vision of the world was largely shaped by their engagement with movies growing up. As such, they treated it as something worthy of serious study and practice as an art form ‚Äî not just as disposable entertainment.\n\nMore on the hallmarks of what people more commonly associate with the French New Wave in the next entry, but I do want to make sure that the so-called ‚ÄúLeft Bank‚Äù gets some credit for their innovative work as well. This loose collective of filmmakers engaged with cinema as an art comparable to other more established disciplines, and they brought with it a more political and philosophical engagement. I am drawn like a moth to a flame with Alain Resnais‚Äô quasi-experimental Hiroshima Mon Amour (available on the Criterion Channel), a work that combines a rigorous interrogation of how outsiders gaze upon ravaged nations with a probing experimental form. The prologue of this film changed my life.\n\n1960s\n\nThe more free-wheeling, self-referential style that you‚Äôd recognize for how it impacted American cinema‚Äôs New Hollywood and Sundance generations really starts to take bloom in the 1960s. The Cahiers du cin√©ma directors began first as film critics for the publications that gave them their label, and they broke down films within their genres and looking for the stamps of true ‚Äúauteurs‚Äù whose fingerprints were identifiable even when executing an uninspiring script. They made films about people like themselves who viewed themselves as characters in a movie, and they weren‚Äôt afraid to explode reality with bursts of obvious and irreverent cinematic technique.\n\nThe guiding light of this movement is Jean-Luc Godard‚Äôs Breathless (available on Max and Criterion Channel). This form-shattering work follows a small-time thief in Paris who‚Äôs convinced he‚Äôs a gangster in an old Hollywood film. It‚Äôs a post-modern demonstration of the feedback loop between images and reality, functioning both as an essay on the grammar of cinema and an explosion of its conventions altogether. An added bonus: it‚Äôs genuinely quite funny! Don‚Äôt feel that just because this is a canonized classic that it can‚Äôt be full of vitality.\n\n1970s\n\nJust as in America, the ‚Äò60s were a time of liberation in France. But that wave of possibility also crested there by the end of the decade as the May 1968 revolts showed how freedom could tip over into anarchy and disorder. Revolutions spark change, just as they can also spur backlash and counter-revolutions.\n\nThe confinement of freedom forms the subject of Jean Eustache‚Äôs The Mother and the Whore (now touring theaters across the country with a new restoration). The film‚Äôs extended conversations demonstrate the depths of discontent among a young Parisian man grappling with the failed promises of sexual liberation. His attempts to calibrate a love triangle to his advantage show how youthful energy begins to fizzle and flame out.\n\n1980s\n\nFrance was no stranger to the forces of commercialization that make the 1980s one of the least dynamic decades for cinema. (However, their infrastructure supporting public funding of the arts does leave them less vulnerable to corporate influence.) I must admit, this was the toughest decade to identify a standout French film from someone whose prime wasn‚Äôt more heavily associated with a different era.\n\nAt least the ‚Äò80s gave us Leos Carax, an experimental radical unafraid of alienating his audience with films like Mauvais Sang (available to rent on Amazon). Literally translating to Bad Blood, this twisted romance refracts the time‚Äôs AIDS anxieties into a grittier look at the modern city. It‚Äôs a natural maturation and evolution of the nouvelle vague style into something a little bit more inscrutable and less easily embraceable.\n\n1990s\n\nJudging from a number of the films above, you could be forgiven for thinking that France is an ethnically homogenous country. It took the multiculturalistic emphasis of the post-Cold War ‚Äò90s to break open the country‚Äôs filmmaking to encompass colors beyond the whiteness of the tricolore.\n\nNo film better bottled up the fury of those traditionally ignored by France‚Äôs cinematic gaze than La Haine (available on the Criterion Channel). Mathieu Kassovitz‚Äôs combustible drama, whose title literally translates to ‚ÄúHate,‚Äù follows three angry young men stewing in their resentments following civil unrest in the banlieues of Paris. Unlike the classical cinematic imagery of Paris which romanticized the city in black-and-white, this film uses the darkness to find the seediness and menace lurking just outside the frame of tourist-friendly imagety.\n\n2000s\n\nIf you need a clear demonstration of how the French film industry differs from America‚Äôs, consider how their early pioneers used the form. The Lumi√®res filmed laborers leaving their workplaces, while Edison filmed carnivalesque attractions. So there can‚Äôt be a full reckoning with the French contributions to the art form without somehow pulling in some documentary work! There‚Äôs perhaps no greater tribute to the enduring vibrancy of France‚Äôs mid-century innovations than Agn√®s Varda‚Äôs constantly adapting humanistic look at her country. Up until her passing in 2019, she kept pushing the boundaries of the form ‚Äî finding ways to open it up to the common people rather than clustering it among the intelligentsia.\n\nMaking the best of advances in digital video technology, she set out into the countryside to make non-fictional The Gleaners and I (available on the Criterion Channel). This self-reflexive work finds parallels between filmmaking and gleaning, the art of making something out of what society discards because it sees as nothing. Consider this the benevolent flipside to La Haine ‚Äî expanding the frame can result in locating previously invisible subjects willing to fill the space with their heart and humanity.\n\n2010s\n\nAs far as recent history goes, you can find just about any kind of work produced by the vast French film industry. But the standout for me is something that can adequately grapple with how labor plays into a changing technological landscape. It‚Äôs about locating the man inside the machinery of filmmaking as it becomes an increasingly industrialized product.\n\nPaying subscribers can read a full piece on why I think St√©phane Briz√© is such a skilled observer of modern economic dynamics. Here‚Äôs a little excerpt about why I think his 2016 film The Measure of a Man (available to rent from various digital platforms) is a cut above your traditional drama about work:\n\n‚ÄúWith a naturalistic camera that borrows from conventions of the neorealist drama ‚Äî handheld camera, unadorned frames, quietly intuitive zooms ‚Äî Briz√© situates this drama fully in the realm of the everyday. But just because we are meant to take the aesthetic as reality does not mean there are no fascinating choices shaping the viewing experience. The camera has a tendency to linger on [French leading man Vincent Lindon, who plays down-on-his-luck former factory worker Thierry], especially when he‚Äôs not actively engaged in conversation. In a perverse way, it echoes the spirit of rugged individualism that has left him fighting a losing battle for his own professional integrity. He‚Äôs isolated in the frame just as he‚Äôs isolated in society.‚Äù\n\n2020s\n\nI‚Äôm going to resist the urge to indulge recency bias and say that Romain Gavras‚Äô Athena is the defining French film of the current decade, even as a clip from the civilians vs. cops thriller went viral recently because people mistook it for something out of the country‚Äôs recent riots.\n\nInstead, I‚Äôll use this as yet another opportunity to implore you to watch Alice Diop‚Äôs staggering Saint Omer (available on Hulu). This inversion of the courtroom drama poses a powerful challenge to whose struggles and sacrifices art is willing to put at the center of the frame. With radical empathy and quiet confidence, Diop inserts images rich with the complexities of Black womanhood into the classical canon where so few exist. It‚Äôs a wonderful ellipsis on a century of French cinema, a worthy endpoint for a country that has done so much to expand the form while also suggesting there are still frontiers to blaze and wrongs to make right‚Ä¶\n\nYou can always keep up with my film-watching in real-time on the app Letterboxd.

Maybe don‚Äôt read it all if you want to keep some element of surprise for your first viewing, but Dunye‚Äôs insight at the top about the long road for this landmark of Black queer cinema to receive canonization is valuable for anyone to know.\n\nYou saw a preliminary version of it here first, but if you want full descriptions for every A24 movie, I ranked them all for Decider. I‚Äôll be updating this list every month, too, with their new releases!\n\nI reviewed Bird Box Barcelona (now streaming on Netflix) for /Film. If this is what awaits us as Netflix tries to sequelize their ‚Äúhits,‚Äù we are in for some rough days ahead.\n\nFor Decider, I said skip it to Seasons and The Tutor (both on Netflix).\n\nYou can keep track of all the freelance writing I‚Äôve done this year through this list on Letterboxd.\n\nTalk to you this weekend, paid subscribers!"
