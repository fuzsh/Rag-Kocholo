        "text": "The moves come at a time when new US sanctions are causing real economic pain, Iran has spooked oil markets with threats to international shipping, and an election in two months is widening political divisions at home.\n\nThe United States denies Arizona-born 28-year-old Amir Mirza Hekmati is a spy, and has demanded his immediate release.\n\nIran has aired a televised confession, denounced by Washington, in which Hekmati said he worked for a New York-based video game company designing games to manipulate public opinion in the Middle East on behalf of US intelligence.\n\n“Amir Mirza Hekmati was sentenced to death ... for cooperating with the hostile country America and spying for the CIA (Central Intelligence Agency),” ISNA news agency quoted judiciary spokesman Gholamhossein Mohseni-Ejei as saying.\n\n“The court found him Corrupt on the Earth and Mohareb (one who wages war on God). Hekmati can appeal to the Supreme Court.”\n\nSeparately, two diplomats in Vienna, where the UN nuclear watchdog is based, said Iran had finally carried out a long-planned step to begin enrichment of uranium at a site deep under a mountain near the holy city of Qom.\n\nUranium enrichment in the Fordow bunker is probably the single most controversial part of Iran’s nuclear program, which Tehran says is peaceful but the West says is aimed at building an atomic bomb.\n\nThe long-simmering nuclear dispute has come to a boil in recent weeks, with the West imposing new sanctions that are having a real impact on Iran’s economy, and Tehran responding with threats to international shipping that rattled oil markets.\n\nAfter years of Western sanctions that had little effect, US President Barack Obama signed a new measure into law on New Year’s Eve that, if fully implemented, would prevent most countries from buying Iranian oil.\n\nThe European Union, which still buys about a fifth of Iran’s oil, is poised to announce an embargo at the end of this month, and other countries may have to cut purchases of Iranian crude to receive waivers from the US sanctions.\n\nBuyers are demanding deep discounts to trade with Tehran, cutting the revenue that it needs to feed its 74 million people.\n\nIran has remained defiant. In a televised speech on Monday, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said: “Sanctions imposed on Iran by our enemies will not have any impact on our nation.\n\n“The Iranian nation believes in its rulers.”\n\nThe rial currency has plunged and Iranians have scrambled to withdraw savings from banks to buy dollars. The hardship comes just two months before a parliamentary election, Iran’s first since a 2009 presidential vote that triggered eight months of angry street demonstrations.\n\nIran’s rulers put those protests down by force but, in the two years since, the Arab Spring has shown the vulnerability of authoritarian governments in the region to uprisings fueled by public anger over economic hardship.\n\nIran has responded to the new sanctions by threatening to shut the Strait of Hormuz, the outlet for ships carrying oil from the Gulf, guarded by a huge US-led international fleet.\n\nBrent Crude was trading at around $113 a barrel on Monday , up by about $6 in the nine days since Obama signed the new sanctions into law. Iran’s military threats and sanctions news have caused spikes in the price throughout recent weeks.\n\nIran disclosed to the International Atomic Energy Agency in 2009 that it was building the nuclear facility beneath a mountain at Fordow, but only after learning that it had been detected by Western intelligence.\n\nTehran says it intends to enrich uranium to 20 percent purity with centrifuges there. The West says uranium that pure is not necessary for power plants and is a step toward a bomb.\n\n“All of Iran’s enrichment activity is in violation of (United Nations) Security Council resolutions and any expansion of its capacity at Fordow just compounds those violations,” said a Western diplomat in Vienna.\n\nLocating the enrichment facility inside a mountain makes it harder for Israel or the United States to destroy it. Both countries say a military option remains on the table.\n\nOn Sunday an Iranian newspaper had quoted the head of Iran’s Atomic Energy Organization as saying enrichment in the bunker would begin in the “near future.”\n\nNuclear talks between Iran and global powers collapsed a year ago. Iran has said it wants to restart them, but the West says Tehran must first make clear it is willing to discuss a halt to uranium enrichment. Starting enrichment at the bunker could make it harder to revive talks and lift sanctions.\n\nDiplomacy was made more difficult late last year when European countries withdrew their ambassadors after protesters stormed the British embassy in Tehran in November. France said on Monday its ambassador had returned."
