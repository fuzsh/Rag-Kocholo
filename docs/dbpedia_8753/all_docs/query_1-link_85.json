        "text": "Upon an order by the US President Barack Obama to Iran's desk at the US Central Intelligence Agency, that desk was commissioned to take part in a trilateral project in a fully clandestine manner with the Israel's Mossad and UK's MI6 against IR Iran, Press TV reported.\n\nThe new mission of Iran's desk at CIA was in addition to CIA's other regular espionage activities and a separate budget was also allocated for it.\n\nThe trilateral project also pursued to carry on with finding a way for penetrating into Iran in addition to trying to assassinate Iranian scientists and conduct media war.\n\nThe US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) had an urgency to successfully and urgently carry out the anti-Iran project. Hence, CIA commissions a special team to find a way for penetrating Iran's intelligence apparatus.\n\nA CIA spy arrested by Iranian Intelligence Ministry has been born in Arizona of US and has a track record of ten years of training as a professional spy.\n\nAmir Mirza Hekmati (the arrested spy) was employed by the US Army's intelligence section in August 2001.\n\nHe took part in an interview by the IRIB's Channel 3 on Sunday night and explained his situation.\n\nThe following is an excerpt of the detained spy, Hekmati with IRIB television:\n\n\"I was graduated from high school in 2001 and decided to enter the US Army. It was in August 2001 that I wore the US Army uniform and underwent different military trainings of the army,\" Hekmati said while elaborating on his being attracted to the army.\n\nThe spy noted that after undergoing general and special military trainings, he was sent to a special university to learn Middle Eastern languages besides intelligence trainings.\n\n\"When they realized that I know a little Persian and a little Arabic, they told me we want to send you to a university to learn Arabic language,\" Hekmati added."
