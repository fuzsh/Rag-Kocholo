        "text": "Iran's Revolutionary Court sentenced an American of Iranian origin, Amir Mirza Hekmati (28), to death for espionage in favor of the United States of America, Iranian media reported.\n\n\"Hekmati was sentenced to death for collaborating with an enemy state and espionage for the US Central Intelligence Agency,\" according to the Iranian news agency \"Fars\".\n\nAt a hearing held on December 28, the prosecution requested the death penalty for Hekmati, because he admitted that he was trained in the US and that, upon his return to America, he planned to suggest that Iran was involved in terrorist activities in other countries.\n\nThe prosecutor then stated that Hekmati entered the Iranian intelligence service on three occasions.\n\n\"Fars\" recalls that Hekmati confessed to the charges in a video broadcast on state television on December 18.\n\nUnder Iranian law, the death penalty for espionage charges is only provided for in military-related cases.\n\nHekmati's lawyer denied these accusations. He pointed out that the Iranian intelligence service prevented Hekmati's incursion and that, according to the law, the intention of infiltration is not a crime. The lawyer claimed that the CIA had deceived his client.\n\nHekmati was born in Arizona and his family is of Iranian descent. His father, who lives in Michigan, claims that Hekmati is not a CIA spy and that he was visiting relatives in Iran when he was arrested."
