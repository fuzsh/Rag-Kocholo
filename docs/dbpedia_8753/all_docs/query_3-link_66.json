        "text": "[ blog ] Translator's note: During the past few months, progressives inside Iran have taken advantage of the Iranian government's anti-Wall Street rhetoric to hold several forums to discuss the significance of the Occupy Wall Street movement. Below are excerpts from two presentations that also offer different views of the nature of the current economic crisis. The first, by labor activist, author, and translator Mohsen Hakimi, was presented to the Iranian Sociological Association in Tehran. The second, by economist Mohammad Maljoo, was presented at a \"Workshop on the Socioeconomic Analysis of the Occupy Wall Street Movement\" at the University of Tehran's School of Social Sciences. -- Frieda Afary\n\nAll opinions expressed in these excerpts are the authors' own.\n\n***\n\nThe Occupy Wall Street Movement: Strengths and Weaknesses\n\nMohsen Hakimi\n\n...I would like to begin my presentation by citing the Occupy Wall Street Movement's definition of itself. This description is posted on its website and acts as its manifesto:\n\nOccupy Wall Street is [a] leaderless resistance movement with people of many colors, genders and political persuasions. The one thing we all have in common is that We Are The 99% that will no longer tolerate the greed and corruption of the 1%. We are using the revolutionary Arab Spring tactic to achieve our ends and encourage the use of nonviolence to maximize the safety of all participants. This #ows movement empowers real people to create real change from the bottom up. We want to see a general assembly in every backyard, on every street corner because we don't need Wall Street and we don't need politicians to build a better society. The only solution is World Revolution. [See occupywallst.org/.]\n\nThe Strengths of the Occupy Wall Street Movement\n\n1. Based on the above statement, this movement can be called an anti-capitalist movement (and not merely anti-war or anti-imperialist or anti-globalization and the like) for the following reasons:\n\n* Wall Street is the world's most important financial trade center. Openly stating that 99% of the population do not need Wall Street or the politicians signifies open opposition to capitalism.\n\n* The active body of this movement mainly consists of the unemployed, women, college students, and dissatisfied and protesting artists.... Let me start with the unemployed. Unemployment is an effect of the capitalist system. A fundamental feature of this system is the effort to increase profit-making for the capitalist class in different ways. One of these methods, which is mainly used in advanced capitalist countries such as the U.S. and Europe, is to increase the productivity of labor through the use of the latest technological and scientific achievements. However, in the context of capitalism, the use of advanced technology and machinery leads to unemployment and the redundancy of workers.... This system uses advanced technology to increase profit. However, in doing so, i.e., by making living workers redundant, it deprives capitalism of the real source of profit, i.e., those very same living workers. Hence, it creates a tendency in capitalism that is called \"the tendential fall in the rate of profit.\" The rise of crises in capitalism is the actual result of this very tendency. Whether this tendency is actualized or not, an inevitable outcome of capitalism is unemployment. In 2011, international capitalist institutions such as the International Labor Organization and the International Monetary Fund have declared that youth unemployment in the U.S. stands at 17.7%...\n\nWomen are another important pillar of this movement. Although women in the U.S. are legally equal to men, in reality they are subjected to prejudice and inequality. Women receive less pay for work equal to that of men.... Another form of oppression of women in the U.S. and the West in general is violence against women...\n\nFinally, college students are another sector of the population that has created the Occupy Wall Street Movement. One of the main reasons for the active participation of college students in this movement is their inability to pay student loans obtained from universities...\n\n* ...A unique feature of the Occupy Wall Street Movement is that it has further penetrated the depths of society. In addition to opposing finance capital and the politicians, it has turned the social problems of everyday life into another realm of the struggle against capitalism. Problems such as illness (for example AIDS or cancer), homelessness, and death resulting from illness and loneliness had been marginalized in previous movements under the leadership of parties and unions. By intervening on these issues, the Occupy Wall Street Movement seeks to challenge competition and prejudice in human relations and instead develop solidarity, cooperation, and equality among people...\n\n* ...This movement has placed new sectors of the population within the ranks of the working class, sectors that were not seen as part of the working class before. This implies the acceptance of a new definition of the working class, a definition that has been buried under the debris of capitalist and specifically postmodernist or reformist or sectarian perspectives in the post-Marx period. For example, one of the perspectives propagated by postmodernist thinkers was that the industrial working class -- which in their opinion constituted what Marx meant by \"the proletariat\" -- had diminished and been replaced by the expanded service sector. Thus, postmodernist thinkers removed non-production workers such as sales clerks, transportation workers, teachers, nurses, and the like from the ranks of the working class and gave the working class a very weak and ever diminishing identity. Rescuing Marx's definition of workers from this debris, and confirming the fact that a worker is not only an industrial worker or a production worker but someone who has no other means of survival but selling her/his labor power to the owners of the means of production, distribution, and exchange, was a turning point, a great achievement, and a strong stroke against capitalism...\n\n* Calling for \"World Revolution\" as the only solution to problems can only be meaningful in opposition to capitalism, because capitalism is not only the problem of this or that country but a global problem...\n\n2. ...Another important strength of this movement is that it is not dominated by traditional parties and unions.... For leftist parties, the main issue has not been to guide a social revolution of the working class for the abolition of the social relation of capital and through the establishment and rule of anti-capitalist councils. Rather [their goal] has been to use workers' struggles in order to achieve political power and establish another form of capitalism, i.e., state capitalism. Labor unions have failed not only to elevate workers' struggles for reforms within the context of capitalism to the level of the struggle against the system of wage labor. Labor unions themselves have turned into the main agent for the domination of reformism within the working-class anti-capitalist struggle...\n\n3. ...Prior to the rise of the Occupy Wall Street Movement, the liberal opposition movement in Iran could present Western liberal democracy as the promised land that Iranian workers should struggle to reach. Now this inversion of reality is hardly possible. Now even the uncritical supporters of liberal democracy have no option but to admit to the problems that capitalism has created for humanity.... Now they will try to tell workers not to look for an alternative beyond capitalism and seek an escape route only within the confines of reformed capitalism.... In order to prove their claim, they point to the collapse of the alternatives counterposed to capitalism up to now (including state capitalism, which has called itself \"socialism\" in countries such as the Soviet Union, China, Cuba, North Korea, and the like).... It will be a big mistake if labor activists in Iran counter liberal capitalism's strategy of inversion by repeating the fatal experience of the past and presenting as an alternative to capitalism that which has been put into practice in the name of \"socialism\" and \"communism\" and has failed disastrously...\n\nThe Weaknesses of the Occupy Wall Street Movement\n\n* This movement is still not organized, self-conscious, and connected to a movement of employed workers...\n\n* The Occupy Wall Street Movement still considers capital not as a social relation but as merely a financial power concentrated in banks...\n\n* The Occupy Wall Street Movement lacks a charter, a minimal set of demands...\n\n11 Azar 1390 (December 2, 2011)\n\n**\n\nThe Deepening Crisis of Capitalism, the Intensification of Class Struggle,\n\nand the Organization of an Alternative System\n\nMohammad Maljoo\n\nFrom the inception of the Occupy Wall Street movement, three themes have found increasing resonance: The deepening crisis of capitalism, the intensification of class struggle, and the organization of an alternative system...\n\nOn the question of the transition from capitalism to communism, orthodox Marxism had three claims concerning these very same themes:\n\nConcerning the first theme, the deepening crisis of the capitalist system, orthodox Marxism spoke of the tendency in capitalism to sow the seeds of its own destruction. In other words, competition among individual capitalists would lead to the deskilling [of labor] and technological innovation, and therefore to laying off workers, an increase in the size of the reserve army of the unemployed, and a decline in wages, ultimately moving toward the crises of overproduction on the one hand and the tendential fall in the rate of the profit on the other.\n\nConcerning the second theme, the intensification of class struggle, orthodox Marxism claimed that alongside the deepening of the crises, there would be a concentration of wealth at one pole of society and a concentration of poverty at the other pole. The polarization of society would lead to the intensification of class contradictions...\n\nFinally, concerning the third theme, the organization of an alternative system, orthodox Marxism also claimed that the material conditions for the creation of communism were born in the womb of capitalism and that the realization of a communist order would require only a final act for the takeover of power...\n\nIn addressing the first theme, the deepening crisis of capitalism, Lenin essentially did not believe in [the idea] of a final crisis of capitalism. He believed that on the verge of the twentieth century, competitive capitalism had been replaced by monopoly capitalism, which had expanded itself in an uneven way around the world in the form of imperialism under the control of finance capital...\n\nIf [as Rosa Luxemburg claimed] the crisis of capitalism emanates from surplus capital or underconsumption, the capitalist system can overcome this problem in various ways through deepening the rule of the logic of capital in various geographical locations. An ever increasing commodification of social life in various societies and geographical locations creates both profitable opportunities for investing the surplus capital and an effective demand for overcoming the problem of underconsumption.\n\nDavid Harvey reaches this very conclusion by increasingly introducing the element of geography into the process of accumulation of capital. The capitalist system will only logically reach its final limit when everything, in the exact sense of the word, has been commodified. In this respect, the capitalist system has not yet reached its final limit and can logically exit the deepest crisis with pride. At the same time, any crisis, no matter how superficial, can logically be the final crisis of the capitalist system.\n\nThe key point is this: The determinant for the survival or destruction of the capitalist system is not the depth of the crisis. The determinant is to be found in the second theme, the intensification of class struggle. If the capitalist system has been able to traverse all the crises and remain unharmed up to now, the reason is to be found not in capitalism's power but in the weakness of class struggles...\n\nIn following [György] Lukács, the Frankfurt School believed that instrumental reason essentially negated revolutionary subjectivity, even if the objectivity of revolution became ever more possible and urgent. [Antonio] Gramsci sought to develop the concept of hegemony in order to answer this question. In other words, he demonstrated how, in bourgeois civil society, meanings and values are produced that lead to the spontaneous satisfaction of various sectors of society with the status quo.\n\n[Louis] Althusser spoke of ideological state apparatuses that actualized the process by which the exploited and the exploiters followed the dominant ideology. However, as [Michel] Foucault says, wherever there is power, there is also resistance.\n\nAlthough Gramsci and Althusser offered convincing theories concerning capitalism's power to use ideology and politics to weaken class struggle, neither one offered a convincing theory concerning the counter-hegemonic project. It was up to Karl Polanyi to develop the counter-hegemonic project.\n\nPolanyi showed how different classes and sectors in civil society spontaneously create a defensive countermovement from below against the capitalist system and defend themselves against the dangers inherent in this system. The point is the following: It is not the depth of the capitalist crisis that determines whether the final crisis of the capitalist system has arrived or not. The determinant is the balance of forces between the hegemonic and the counter-hegemonic projects. The stronger the counter-hegemonic side, the more likely the final crisis of capitalism, regardless of the depth and scope of the crisis itself. However, the moving force for strengthening the counter-hegemonic project and weakening the hegemonic project must be found in the third theme, i.e., questions about the organization of the alternative system.\n\nContrary to the predictions of orthodox Marxism, the material conditions for the organization of the alternative system have not yet been provided spontaneously in the womb of capitalism. If those conditions are not provided spontaneously, then two questions gain significance.\n\nThe first question concerns the nature of the alternative system. Is it the alternative of social democrats such as Joseph Stiglitz or Paul Krugman? Is it the alternative of environmentalists such as James Lovelock? Is it the alternative of anarchists such as James Scott or Noam Chomsky? Is it the alternative of autonomists such as Antonio Negri and Felix Guattari or Michael Hardt? Is it the alternative of post-developmentalists such as Arturo Escobar or Maji Rahnema? Is it the alternative of socialists such as David Harvey? Or is it the alternative of communists such as Michael Lebowitz or Michael Albert?\n\nThe second question concerns the appropriate political pathway for achieving the alternative system. Is the pathway for achieving a socialist alternative to be found in parliamentary struggles, as Eduard Bernstein claimed? Or should the capitalist state first be destroyed and a new form of state constructed, as Lenin claimed?... Reform or revolution?... The main point is the following: If the emergence of the final crisis of capitalism is not dependent on the depth of the crisis but on the strength of class struggle, the motivating force for class struggle also arises from a certain minimal level of agreement on the type of alternative system and the appropriate political method for achieving the alternative system.\n\n7 Azar 1390 (November 28, 2011)\n\nFrieda Afary produces the blog Iranian Progressives in Translation. Homepage photo. Iranian regime supporters rally in Tehran in support of Occupy Wall Street. Above: Supporters of Iran's Green Movement join Occupy Wall Street in Zuccotti Park, New York City.\n\nCopyright © 2011 Tehran Bureau\n\nFollow Tehran Bureau on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nThere's more than one way to disrupt the vital sea lane, and the result could be catastrophic.\n\n[ opinion ] A significant consequence of the rising rhetorical hostility between the West and Iran has been speculation that Iran will attempt to close the Strait of Hormuz if it is attacked. In recent weeks, tensions have increased due to Iran's military maneuvers in and around the strait and reciprocal U.S. warnings. As the communications channels between Iran and the United States are very limited and poor, any misunderstanding of intentions and capabilities by either side could quickly lead to grave consequences for both countries, for the region, and for the global economy. It is thus imperative to reach a sober perspective on what the likely response of each player would be in the event of the conflict's escalation, particularly with respect to the Strait of Hormuz.\n\nAccording to the conventional narrative of how escalation would progress, in response to the imposition of \"crippling\" sanctions -- such as full implementation of central banking restrictions -- some sort of oil embargo, or military strikes, Tehran would have the choice of either mining the strait so as to make commerce through it extremely hazardous or of forcefully imposing a full naval blockade, blocking passage between the Persian Gulf and the Arabian Sea. The U.S. Navy, possibly with the aid of allied states, would in turn swiftly attempt to clear the strait. If the Iranians did not back down, all-out war would be the likely result. Those who regard Iranian threats to close the strait as a bluff base their view on two assumptions: (1) Iran would never close the strait due to its economic dependence upon the vital choke point, and (2) any attempt to close the strait would bring the weight of the world down on the Islamic Republic.\n\nThe Iranian rationale: Why do it?\n\nLook at the issue through the Tehran prism, however, and both of these assumptions appear uncertain. To comprehend how Tehran could and would actually retaliate in the strait, one must first understand the Iranian rationale in dealing with the West. For Tehran, what is at stake is the concept of the modern global commons, in which states trade and otherwise interact with each other. Iran believes that international law is fundamentally incapable of protecting its interests, that due to the sway the Western powers maintain over international bodies, which they routinely use to advance their own foreign policy aims, the cards are stacked against the Islamic Republic no matter what it does.\n\nFor example, Iran sees itself as a victim of terrorism and thus does not take seriously the charge that it is responsible for promoting terrorism itself. For Iran, the logic of the nonproliferation regime, which supposedly protects the rights of states to peaceful nuclear technology, is also deeply suspect. Though every International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) report concerning Iran has confirmed that there is no evidence of diversion of nuclear material from peaceful to potentially military use and though the IAEA has access to and cameras installed in all of the country's nuclear sites, Iran is still labeled an imminent nuclear threat by the United States and its allies.\n\nThe Iranian approach to the Strait of Hormuz is linked to its general skepticism of international law. Iran feels that its economy, which has now been subject to sanctions for over three decades, is being singled out arbitrarily. It does not accept the argument that it is being sanctioned due to nuclear proliferation, terrorism, and human rights concerns, as it is surrounded by neighbors, some of them client regimes of the West, whose record in those areas it regards as markedly worse. If what Tehran perceives as the unfair denial of its access to the global economy reaches a certain level, it may well be provoked to disrupt access to a crucial geographical facilitator of that economy -- the Strait of Hormuz.\n\nThe Iranian response: \"Somalia-ization\" of the strait\n\nIran is fully aware that any blockade or direct attack on such a crucial choke point would incite massive retaliation by the international community, led by the United States. It understands that such a move would completely isolate it from its fellow OPEC members and invite a coalitional war on the country.\n\nSo is Iran bluffing when it claims that it will use oil and its transport as a weapon? Absolutely not.\n\nIn the event of an escalation of the Iran-U.S. conflict, the Iranians will avoid any semblance of the traditional narrative that involves an overt attempt to shut down the Strait of Hormuz. Instead, Iran could seek to create perpetual, low-grade instability in the strait, mostly through asymmetric means, with the objective of making it an aquatic \"no-man's land,\" similar to what has transpired in the waters off the Horn of Africa. Rather than follow the example of Gamal Abdel Nasser in the Suez Crisis, Iran can utilize highly advanced piracy and sabotage tactics, while looking to maintain plausible deniability.\n\nThis approach has three distinct advantages. The first is that it will still allow Iran to utilize the straits, with manageable consequences for its own economy. The most challenging aspect would be the adaptations required in transport strategy, but the country's long coastline would mitigate that concern. Second, it will provide Iran with regional and global leverage without the unified international opprobrium that would come with a naval blockade. Policy makers and military strategists among its adversaries might well know who was causing instability in the strait, but without an overt, conventional attempt to close the passage, would be unable to stop it. And third, perhaps most importantly, this enterprise could be extended indefinitely and in direct proportion to how long and to what extent the United States and its allies maintain heightened pressure on Iran.\n\nThe matter of what specific tactics would be employed remains speculative, contingent upon the regional and global strategic environment present at the time Iran's strategists decide to take action. They could run the gamut of sabotaging ships in all sorts of asymmetric ways to \"soft\" mining and obstruction tactics that could be blamed on \"pirates.\" If regional exporting states collaborated with the United States on an Iran oil embargo, those measures could be accompanied by infrastructure sabotage, as seen in conflicts in southeast Turkey, Nigeria, or Egypt.\n\nThis strategy does not rely on Iranian ingenuity or a newfound method of warfare. But the fact that it has the most strategic coastline on the waterway and the region's largest navy (whose strategic doctrine has long placed a premium on asymmetric warfare) means it is well positioned to disrupt, on a low-level, continuous basis, the vital shipping corridor.\n\nThis asymmetric approach would not close down the strait. For Iran, the choice is not \"to close\" or \"not to close,\" but rather to clog. A major global choke point, once considered safe, would no longer be so. In practical terms, vastly increased costs for shipping -- including security, insurance, and reinsurance for both cargo and crew -- along with permanent market instability, would be the new norm. For oil producers, particularly Iran, this would be a far more advantageous strategy than a full-on blockade.\n\nThough an Iranian naval blockade would have severe economic consequences for the West, which would endure a drastic hike in petroleum prices, it would provoke a swift, multinational extrication of the naval wall, severe punishment for the Iranian regime, and eventual restabilization of oil prices. The asymmetric approach, if executed cannily, would mitigate the backlash, while allowing Iran to reap the reward of higher oil profits, thus curtailing the effect of the sanctions regime. The Iranians would count on the sustained stress on the global economy to ultimately force the United States to shift course.\n\nU.S. counters to Iranian asymmetry both limited and costly\n\nCould the United States, with the assistance of its European and regional partners, effectively combat the virus of instability that would result from asymmetric action by Iran in the Strait of Hormuz? Surprisingly, no. While America can effectively deal with a conventional threat by Iran or any other state actor on the strait's functionality, its options against attenuated, asymmetric threats to the passage are very limited, expensive, and likely to be self-defeating.\n\nThe United States would most likely respond by either establishing a large-scale, permanent presence of naval forces in or near the strait, or performing daily flyovers from regional bases, or some combination thereof to maintain an open corridor. While this would dissuade the Iranians from overt acts of aggression, it would most likely drive them underground and underwater -- figuratively and literally. And the United States will soon realize that it does not take a great amount of effort or imagination to cause instability, whether the saboteurs pose as fisherman or local commercial traders in traditional dhows or Iran's mosaic of speedboats.\n\nOnce that recognition comes, the American response will more likely amplify the impediments to transit through the strait than mitigate them. One can imagine a circumstance where the large U.S. naval presence in the strait would have to clear physical blockage of some kind and search and seize all suspect vessels, producing a deleterious impact on the local fishing industry and interstate shipping in the region.\n\nAs for regional states sympathetic to the U.S. cause, but fearful of Iran, they will probably avoid open expressions of sympathy with either side while urging restraint. Also, since most of them are oil producers and would benefit from a rise in petroleum prices because of sustained instability, the likelihood of them adopting an overtly anti-Iranian position, unless directly attacked by Tehran, would be lower still. In all likelihood, they will just sit back, watch the show, and collect substantially higher oil revenues.\n\nNo good options for any involved party\n\nIf the United States finds itself in a situation where the Strait of Hormuz is destabilized and its efforts to clear it are failing, it will be confronted with two choices, neither salutary: diplomatically resolve its issues with Iran, for which scant political will exists in America, or gamble on still further escalation, which has delivered few positive results to date.\n\nThe rising hostility between Iran and the West, particularly if open conflict results, will yield no victors. Despite its advantages over a strategy of total blockade, disrupting the strait's stability will keep Iran outside of the regional security architecture, which undermines its long-term potential. Such an approach is in no way a substitute for a integrationist strategy aimed at improving Iran's relationships with its neighbors and the global community. For the United States, the cost of its Iran obsession, particularly if open hostilities arise, will do far more damage to its long-term position as a global superpower than any small short-term gain it might reap from temporarily weakening the Islamic Republic.\n\nIf escalation continues in slow motion and stability within the strait gradually deteriorates due to the application of an asymmetric Iranian strategy as described here, the result will be almost entirely negative for Washington. The United States would be drawn into providing the manpower and bearing the exorbitant cost for removing the impediments to transport through the passage -- essentially becoming the janitor of the Strait of Hormuz. And this sort of engagement, of course, would vastly multiply the odds that one side or another, however nondeliberately, would commit an act that would spark a war.\n\nFor the Persian Gulf region, which has suffered years of war and in which every state is gripped by political uncertainty, if not outright revolutionary upheaval, mounting Iran-U.S. belligerence holds catastrophic potential. In countries where the traditional autocratic authority is disintegrating, the radicalization that would follow increasingly open conflict between Iran and the United States would likely bring to power elements prepared to act forcefully against American interests in the region. In states such as Iran, Lebanon, Qatar, Kuwait, the UAE, and Pakistan with some tradition of reformist political figures favoring normalization of relations between the Islamic world and the West, those players would be completely pushed aside for the foreseeable future. And given the current instability in Europe, along with the fickle recovery around the developed world, an Iran-U.S. war could precipitate a global depression with ease.\n\nViews expressed are the author's.\n\nCopyright © 2012 Tehran Bureau\n\nFollow Tehran Bureau on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nPress Roundup provides a selected summary of news from the Farsi and Arabic press and excerpts where the source is in English.

The official rate is about 10,900 rials to $1. The rate of exchange between the rial and other major currencies, such as the euro, has also increased dramatically. Central Bank Governor Mahmoud Bahmani attributed the increase to \"psychological effects,\" presumably referring to the rising tensions between Iran and the United States. There are also persistent reports of people withdrawing their savings from banks in order to purchase gold and silver, driving their prices higher as well. Another important factor in the increase of the exchange rate is President Obama's signing into law new sanctions on Iran's Central Bank, although Bahmani has dismissed them as \"comical\" and said, \"The enemy is counting on psychological tension in the currency market.\" A popular website that posts the rate of exchange between the rial and other currencies, as well as gold, has been blocked.\n\nAhmad Tavakoli and Elias Naderan, two Majles deputies who are prominent critics of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, asked Majles Speaker Ali Larijani to convene an emergency session of parliament to discuss the rise in the rate of exchange. They blamed the Ahmadinejad administration's mismanagement and weak policies, as well as what they called \"foreign elements,\" for the increase. Fars, the news agency run by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, joined in the criticism of Ahmadinejad, asking rhetorically, \"Where is the [U.S.] dollar that the president used to say is not worth even 9,000 rials?\"\n\nThe housing market has also been affected by the devaluation of rial. The average price of residential units has increased by about 20 percent in Tehran over the past few weeks, and continues to rise.\n\nIran issues another Persian Gulf warning\n\nOn the last day of a major Iranian naval exercise, Major General Ataollah Salehi, chief of staff of the regular armed forces, said, \"We warn [the United States] not to return its aircraft carrier, which we consider a threat against us, to the Persian Gulf.\" Although Salehi did not name a specific ship, he was presumably referring to the USS John C. Stennis of the U.S. Navy's 5th Fleet, which left the Persian Gulf last week after visiting Dubai's Jebel Ali port and passing through the Strait of Hormuz. Salehi added, \"We are not in the habit of repeating our warnings.... We emphasize that we are not trying to incite anything irrational, but warn the carrier not to come back.\"\n\nThe Obama administration quickly reacted to Salehi's warning. White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said, \"It is the latest round of Iranian threats and is confirmation that Tehran is under increasing pressure for its continued failure to live up to its international obligations. Iran is isolated and is seeking to divert attention from its behavior and domestic problems.\"\n\nThe U.S. Defense Department was also quick to react. Pentagon spokesman George Little said, \"The deployment of U.S. military assets in the Persian Gulf region will continue as it has for decades. These are regularly scheduled movements in accordance with our longstanding commitments to the security and stability of the region and in support of ongoing operations. The U.S. Navy operates under international maritime conventions to maintain a constant state of high vigilance in order to ensure the continued, safe flow of maritime traffic in waterways critical to global commerce. We are committed to protecting maritime freedoms that are the basis for global prosperity; this is one of the main reasons our military forces operate in the region.\"\n\nGrand ayatollah condemns oppression\n\nGrand Ayatollah Yousef Sanei, one of the most progressive and popular Marjas (sources of emulation for the Shia masses), said that \"one day the oppressors will not have any way out against the determination of nations to end dictatorship.\" Meeting with a group of university students from Tehran and Karaj, the grand ayatollah added, \"On that day the oppressors will be trembling, as it is clear what the nations will do with them.\" He also said, \"The person who directly helps the oppressor and oppression shares in the sin, and a person who is silent about the injustice done to others also shares the sin with the oppressor. Imam Sajjad [Shiites' Fourth Imam] has been quoted as saying, 'If a person is killed in the east and someone in the west is satisfied by it, it is the same as being the co-offender of the murder.'\" He also said that concerning oppression, \"Silence is not permitted. Opposing the oppressors is a religious duty.\"\n\nAdmitting the popularity of the Green Movement's leaders\n\nPowerful cleric Ali Saeedi, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei's representative to the Revolutionary Guards, said that it is not possible to put Mir Hossein Mousavi and Mehdi Karroubi on trial because \"they have supporters.\" He added, \"Just a few days ago the Gray Man said, 'I will not stop supporting these two. They are good people.'\" Saeedi did not name the \"Gray Man,\" but during his investigations of the Chain Murders, journalist Akbar Ganji referred to Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani as the \"Gray Eminence.\"\n\nAhmadinejad backs down\n\nA few days ago, Ahmadinejad announced the appointment of Mehdi Khorshidi, his 30-year-old son-in-law, as the new head of the National Institute of Standards and Industrial Research. The appointment was strongly protested by many, including some Majles deputies. The president relented and asked Seyyed Nezameddin Barzegari, whom Khorshidi was supposed to replace as institute chief, to remain in the post. Khorshidi has been an outspoken critic of his father-in-law's chief of staff and close confidant, Esfandiar Rahim Mashaei.\n\nSeven new websites set up by Ahmadinejad's supporters\n\nAs reported by Tehran Bureau, after the confrontation between Ahmadinejad and Khamenei deepened, many websites and blogs that openly supported the president were blocked by the hardliners. New reports indicate that the president's supporters have quietly set up new websites, trying not to be too provocative, so that they can still be operating when the Majles elections are held on March 3. The new websites include Hemmat Negar, Sarih News, Zaman News, Hezar Sangar, Hamian-e Javan-e Dolat-e Eslami, Raha Press, and Meyar News.\n\nAhmadinejad-Rafsanjani alliance?\n\nNedaaye Enghelab, a hardline website close to the Revolutionary Guards, accused Ahmadinejad and his supporters of \"preparing the groundwork for transferring power,\" presumably from Khamenei to the president. Borhan, another pro-Khamenei website, claimed that Ahmadinejad and Rafsanjani have jointly decided to attack Khamenei with the goal of weakening the principlists who support the Supreme Leader. This is the first time that the hardliners have accused Rafsanjani and Ahmadinejad of a tacit alliance.\n\n\"Ahmadi the idol breaker, break the great idol\"\n\nLast Friday, Ahmadinejad attended a meeting of his campaign team for the Majles elections. This was his second meeting with the team over the past month. During the meeting, the president's supporters shouted many times, \"Ahmadi[nejad] the idol breaker, break the great idol!\" Meyar News, one of the seven new pro-Ahmadinejad websites, reported that in response Ahmadinejad said, \"The great idol breaker was Abraham. The idol of our era will be broken by Imam-e Zaman\" -- Mahdi, the 12th Imam, whom Shiites believe will one day return from centuries of occultation. Apparently Ahmadinejad also made another provocative statement, saying, \"Velaayat [rule of the Islamic jurist] belongs to humanity, and does not belong to a particular person\" -- an implicit, but clear challenge to Khamenei.\n\nIt is not clear whom Ahmadinejad's supporters meant by the \"great idol.\" The phrase was also used before the June 2009 presidential election, when it was clear that it referred to Rafsanjani. But according to Khabar Online, the website close to Speaker Larijani, \"This person cannot be Rafsanjani, because in their confrontation with Rafsanjani, Ahmadinejad's team does not recognize any red line\" -- that is, if they meant Rafsanjani, they would have named him explicitly. Many believe that \"the great idol\" is meant to be none other than Khamenei.\n\nMeanwhile, Deputy Majles Speaker Mohammad Reza Bahonar, who supports Khamenei, attacked the Ahmadinejad administration, declaring that the government's claim to have created one million new jobs in the current Iranian year is a \"lie,\" because this would have required a $120 billion investment that the government doesn't have. Ahmadinejad has said, \"I am embarrassed to say we have unemployed people.\"\n\nBushehr reactor to come online on anniversary of Revolution\n\nAli Zabihi, deputy minister of energy, said that the Bushehr light-water nuclear reactor will be completely online by the Fajr festival, the ten-day celebration in February that commemorates the victory of the 1979 Revolution. He said that the reactor is already operating at about half of its full capacity of 1,000 MW. Energy Minister Majid Namjoo has said that the final tests are being run on the reactor in order to bring it fully online. So far, tests to transmit 100, 200, 300, 400, and 500 MW from the Bushehr plant to the national electrical grid have been successfully completed.\n\nMeanwhile, Foreign Ministry spokesman Ramin Mehmanparast said that the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) will soon send a team to Tehran, led by the agency's deputy director-general.\n\nJuppe: Iran is making nuclear weapons\n\nFrench Foreign Minister Alain Juppé said, \"Iran is pursuing the development of its nuclear arms, I have no doubt about it. The last report by the International Atomic Energy Agency is quite explicit on this point.\" Actually, the IAEA report did not say that, but only that there are research aspects of Iran's nuclear program that have \"possible military dimension.\" Juppé said that his country wants tougher sanctions \"without closing off the path of negotiation and dialogue with Iran.\" French President Nicolas Sarkozy has proposed freezing the assets of Iran's Central Bank and sanctioning Iran's oil industry.\n\nMajles link to $3 billion embezzlement case\n\nGholam Hossein Mohseni Ejei, Iran's prosecutor-general and special prosecutor for the embezzlement case involving nearly $3 billion that has roiled the regime, said that the son of a Majles deputy, whom he did not name, has been arrested in the case. He added that the charges against him are \"heavy,\" but that he is not, contrary to wide rumors, a son of a member of the parliamentary leadership group. He also said that a piece of jewelry that belongs to the wife of one of the shareholders of Amir Mansoor Aria group, the holding company said to be behind the embezzlement, has been confiscated. Ejei said that the value of the jewelry is estimated to be $3,700,000. He added that it has been discovered that at least $6,250,000 worth of jewelry was purchased for the same woman.\n\nMeanwhile, there are persistent rumors in Tehran that 16 Majles deputies have been told privately that they should not run in the upcoming elections, because their qualifications will be rejected by the Guardian Council. Many believe that the 16 may have been involved in the embezzlement. It is known that at least five Majles deputies -- Alaeddin Boroujerdi, Arsalam Fathipoor, Mohammad Dehghan, Jaabar Kouchakizadeh, and Samad Marashi -- have been interrogated in the case. Boroujerdi, chairman of the Majles National Security and Foreign Policy Commission, was arrested and detained for one day. Others that have been charged include Mahmoud Reza Khavari, the Bank Melli director who fled to Canada; Hamif Pour Mohammadi, deputy governor of the Central Bank; and Mohammad Jahromi, director of Bank Saderat.\n\nHuman rights reports\n\nSaeed Naeimi, a senior member of the Organization of University Graduates, was released from prison. After 235 days of incarceration, he was set free after posting bail of about $45,000.\n\nThe website that reflects Rafsanjani's views has been blocked. The website is published by Rafsanjani's oldest son, Mohsen Hashemi; Mohammad Hashemi, Rafsanjani's younger brother and chief of staff, is also influential in what is posted on the website. The website had been warned not to post what the security officials consider \"provocative.\" It was recently ordered to remove 60 items, in particular Rafsanjani's sermon during the last Friday Prayer that he led in Tehran in July 2009 in which he called for freedom of press, free elections, and release of political prisoners. When the order was rebuffed, the website was blocked. Prosecutor-general Mohseni Ejei confirmed that the website has been blocked due to \"the offenses that it had committed.\"\n\nFatemeh Alvandi, mother of imprisoned journalist Mehdi Mahmoudian, was arrested by the Ministry of Intelligence, interrogated, warned, and then released. Mahmoudian, a member of the Islamic Iran Participation Front, the most important reformist party that has been outlawed by the hardliners, was one of the first journalists to report on the crimes that took place at the Kahrizak detention center after the post-election protests in 2009, in which at least four young protestors were murdered and a large number tortured. Sentenced to five years of incarceration, he is severely ill, but judiciary officials refuse to grant him any furlough to seek medical treatment and rest. There has been no news about Mahmoudian for some time, and his family is very concerned.\n\nReports indicate that Feyzollah Arabsorkhi, senior member of the Organization of Islamic Revolution Mojahedin -- a leading reformist group that has been outlawed by the hardliners -- is in very poor health. He has been under pressure to withdraw his signature from a statement by 39 leading political prisoners calling for a boycott of the upcoming Majles elections, due to which he is not allowed to seek medical treatment outside prison. Two other prominent political prisoners, journalist Masoud Bastani and human rights activist Jafar Eghdami, are also in poor health and have no access to medical treatment.\n\nCopyright © 2012 Tehran Bureau\n\nFollow Tehran Bureau on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nPress Roundup provides a selected summary of news from the Farsi and Arabic press and excerpts where the source is in English.

You can follow breaking news stories on our Twitter feed.\n\nIran Standard Time (IRST), GMT+3:30\n\n10:40 p.m., 17 Dey/January 7 After many months of struggle between a group of Majles deputies who have wanted to summon Mahmoud Ahmadinejad for questioning and the parliamentary leadership, which has prevented the move, the president has finally been called to appear before the Majles -- at least, technically. Alaeddin Boroujerdi, chairman of the parliament's National Security and Foreign Policy Commission, said that Ahmadinejad has been asked to participate in a meeting of the commission on Tuesday to respond to deputies' questions concerning two unspecified matters. He added, however, that the president can send a representative to the meeting, instead of participating in it himself. Cleric Hassan Ebrahimi said that the two issues deputies want to discuss are Ahmadinejad's attempts to remove Intelligence Minister Heydar Moslehi from office, and his firing of former Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki while Mottaki was visiting Senegal in 2010.\n\nTwenty-four Majles deputies will not run again\n\nThe deadline to enroll with the Interior Ministry to run in the upcoming Majles elections, to be held on March 3, has expired. Of the current 290 deputies, at least 24 -- most of them reformists -- have decided not to run again. The best known of the reformists who will not seek reelection is Jamshid Ansari, who represents Zanjan, about 150 miles northwest of Tehran. Among the few principlist deputies who will not run again, the most important are Mousa Ghorbani, who represents Ghaenat in South Khorasan province; Mohammad Taghi Rahbar, the reactionary cleric who represents Isfahan; and cleric Seyyed Reza Akrami, who represents the greater Tehran area.\n\nKarroubi's party calls for boycott of Majles vote\n\nEsmail Gerami Moghaddam, spokesman for the Etemad-e Melli (National Trust), the political party founded by Mehdi Karroubi, announced the party's official position regarding the upcoming Majles elections. He declared that because senior officials of the party have clearly stated that they will not participate in the elections, Etemad-e Melli will not nominate anyone. Gerami Moghaddam also criticized the attempts of some conservatives to style themselves as reformists and to speak on behalf of all the true reformists.\n\nMesbah Yazdi, a democrat?\n\nBibak News, the website published by the reactionary cleric Mohammad Taghi Mesbah Yazdi, posted a remarkable article which claims that Imam Ali, the Shiites' first Imam and the cousin and son-in-law of the Prophet, was put in power by people's vote. Mesbah Yazdi has always said that the Imams and Faghihs (such as Khamenei and Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini) were selected by God, and the people only \"discovered\" the selection. He has also previously stated that elections are \"décor\" for an Islamic government, since he believes that the regime gets its legitimacy from God, not the people. According to the article, \"Thus, as you can see, Islam has the highest respect for people's votes.\"\n\nAnother Bibak News article condemned \"making revelations about Muslim politicians,\" implicitly opposing the attacks by Ahmadinejad and his supporters on Rafsanjani. It appears that the articles represent a new campaign tactic by Mesbah Yazdi and his supporters. Mesbah Yazdi is the leader of the Jebheh Paaydaari Enghelab-e Eslami (JPEE, or Durable Front of the Islamic Revolution), which supports Ahmadinejad. The JPEE is concerned that its candidates may be disqualified by the Guardian Council, which has vetting power over candidates for all important elections and which supports Khamenei in his power struggle with Ahmadinejad. Five clerical students of Mesbah Yazdi -- Morteza Agha Tehrani, Mohammad Naser Saghaye Biria, Mamoud Nabavian, and Hossein Jalali -- intend to run.\n\nRahim Mashaei's 96 foreign trips\n\nMajles deputy Ahmad Tavakoli said that parliament may question Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Salehi about trips that Esfandiar Rahim Mashaei, Ahmadinejad's chief of staff and close confidant, has taken abroad over the past several years. According to Tavakoli, Rahim Mashaei has made 96 trips to foreign countries, most of them as the head of the Organization of Cultural Heritage and Tourism. The deputy asked, \"Where did he go, why did he go, and why were the trips necessary?\" Tavakoli, a prominent critic of the president, claimed that during one of the trips Rahim Mashaei also met with a former Israeli ambassador to an unnamed country.\n\nRafsanjani and Ahmadinejad\n\nRaha Press, one of the seven new websites that support Ahmadinejad, claimed that Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani is trying to \"finish off\" Ahmadinejad. It claimed that Rafsanjani, Majles Deputy Speaker Mohammad Reza Bahonar, and several other conservatives intend to pressure Ayatollah Ali Khamenei to \"topple the tenth administration [after the 1979 Revolution].\" According to the website, \"Some high-ranking officials of several political parties have concluded that Khamenei's silence about the 'perverted group' [the hardliners' epithet for Mashaei and his inner circle] will not last and, therefore\" -- here the site employs an extended soccer metaphor -- \"they should 'score the golden goal' [getting rid of the president] before 'extra time' arrives, because Bahonar has said that Khamenei's silence about the 'perverted group' is shaky and he may support the leader of the 'perverted group' after 90 minutes.\" Raha Press has claimed that Bahonar made the statement after meeting with Rafsanjani. The speculation is based on the sudden posting of a letter that Rafsanjani wrote to Khamenei a few days before the June 2009 presidential election in which he warned Khamenei about the consequences of Ahmadinejad's \"reelection.\" The letter was posted on the website that reflects Rafsanjani's views, which was recently blocked.\n\nAhmadinejad ignores Khamenei's orders\n\nAbbas Salimi Namin, head of the Center for Compilation and Study of Iran's History, said that Ahmadinejad has been ignoring Khamenei's orders to participate in the meetings of the Expediency Discernment Council, headed by Rafsanjani. Speaking to a group of pro-Khamenei university students, Salimi Namin said, \"The Leader has emphasized many times to Ahmadinejad that he must participate in the meetings of the council, but he ignores them.\" He added that, \"Ahmadinejad wants to polarize the society, which is against the Leader's wishes.\"\n\nSome European countries want to postpone Iran oil embargo\n\nDr. Mehrdad Emadi, an economic adviser to the European Union, said that several European countries have requested that the union postpone the implementation of the planned embargo of Iranian oil. Some countries, such as Greece, receive oil from Iran at a discounted price and have requested the union make up for the higher costs they will have to bear. At the same time, the E.U. needs to learn whether Saudi Arabia will be able to compensate for the cutoff of Iranian oil by increasing its own oil production. He added that a postponement of as many as six months has been requested.\n\nIran will not stop uranium enrichment\n\nIn a conversation with Xinhua, the Chinese news agency, Foreign Ministry spokesman Ramin Mehmanparast said that Iran will never stop uranium enrichment. \"Our nuclear program is for peaceful purposes, and is our national right,\" he added, emphasizing that in the next round of negotiations that may soon take place between Iran and the 5+1 group -- the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council plus Germany -- \"Iran will not say anything about setting aside its peaceful nuclear program.\"\n\nReferring to the U.S. spy drone that was recently captured by Iran, Mehmanparast said, \"The United States is well aware that the number of its spying aircrafts that our security and defense forces have controlled is more than one, and we will decide at the appropriate time to show them in public.\" He also claimed that the United States is employing human spies to gather intelligence on Iran as well. Mehmanparast denied that there is any direct link between the new round of sanctions that have been imposed on Iran by the United States and its European allies and the wide fluctuations in the rate of exchange between the Iranian rial and major Western currencies including the U.S. dollar. He observed that the new U.S. sanctions have not even been imposed yet and will take several months to be implemented.\n\nIran \"not concerned\" about sanctions\n\nForeign Minister Salehi said that Iran is not concerned about the new sanctions imposed by the United States and its European allies. Speaking at a news conference with his Turkish counterpart Ahmet Davutoglu who is visiting Tehran, Salehi said, \"The sanctions will have no effect. Given the experience of the Islamic Republic of Iran with sanctions over the past 32 years, we are ready to counter such economic enmities and are not concerned about them. The necessary plans [to counter the sanctions] have been made. Just as we have weathered such difficulties over the past 32 years, we will do so again.\" He reiterated that Iran is prepared to negotiate with the 5+1 group, and said that, in a recent conference in Bonn, he had talked to Catherine Ashton, the European Union high representative for foreign affairs and security policy, about resuming the negotiations.\n\nWest wages \"economic war\" on Iran\n\nOil Minister Rostam Ghasemi said that Iran is in an \"economic war\" with the West. Visiting Kharg Island, where Iran's largest oil terminal is located, Ghasemi said, \"Given the vital role of Kharg Island in Iran's economy, the island is the main base and at the forefront of the national economy and the staff working at Kharg are like the soldiers [at the front].\" Ghasemi urged the quick completion of several projects on the island, including new terminals and a liquefied natural gas facility, and emphasized that there is no problem in providing the necessary funds for the projects, as they have the highest priority.\n\nAhmadinejad promoted to associate professor\n\nBefore he was elected president in 2005, Ahmadinejad was an assistant professor in the Civil Engineering Department at Iran University of Science and Technology, where he received his degrees. Despite the fact that over the last seven years he has been too busy to be really involved at IUST, he was recently promoted by the university to associate professor. This has provoked protests by students and some faculty members who say that he has not been active in research for many years, a main criterion for promotion. In 2009, Kamran Daneshjoo, Ahmadinejad's minister of science, research, and technology, who was an assistant professor at IUST, was promoted to full professor (skipping over the intermediate position of associate professor), even though he has similarly not been active at the university for four years, due to his work at the Interior Ministry and as governor-general of Tehran province.\n\nAhmadinejad visits Intelligence Ministry\n\nNine months after he forced Intelligence Minister Moslehi out of office, only to see him reinstated by Khamenei, Ahmadinejad visited the Intelligence Ministry headquarters, where he met with Moslehi and some staff members. According to the reports, Ahmadinejad never mentioned last year's episode, but talked about what the ministry should do, including \"being ahead of the curve when it comes to the development's in the region,\" and \"having a world view\" of the developments.\n\nCenter Bank governor threatens to resign\n\nAfter being subjected to strong criticism in the Majles over the dramatic increase in the rate of exchange between the rial and U.S. dollar, Central Bank Governor Mahmoud Bahmani has apparently threatened to resign. He has reportedly said that he will stay in his job only if all the related governmental organs work with him to control the chaotic currency market and he is given complete freedom in his job.\n\nU.S. warns Latin American countries about Iran\n\nNext week, Ahmadinejad will visit Venezuela, Nicaragua, Cuba, and Ecuador. U.S. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said that the trips indicate that Iran is desperate for friends: \"As the regime feels increasing pressure, it is desperate for friends and flailing around in interesting places to find new friends. We are making absolutely clear to countries around the world that now is not the time to be deepening ties, not security ties, not economic ties, with Iran.\" The countries Ahmadinejad plans to visit next week and the rest of the international community must make it clear to Iran that it has a \"choice,\" Nuland said. \"It can remain in an international isolation, or it can comply with its obligations and start cooperating and rejoin the community of nations.\"\n\nList of 101 people secretly executed\n\nThe International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran has published a list of the names of 101 people who it says were executed secretly in Vakil Abad Prison, near the northeastern city of Mashhad. The Campaign called on the Majles and judiciary to immediately institute a moratorium on executions and to move swiftly to abolish the death penalty. \"Unfortunately, many of these executions happen behind closed doors, without the involvement of lawyers or awareness of the victim's family, and without access to a fair trial,\" said Nobel Peace Prize Laureate Shirin Ebadi. She added, \"The Iranian judiciary and government know that the death penalty is not a suitable solution for fighting crime, particularly drug-related crimes. The basic question is this: why does the Iranian government use this type of punishment with such enthusiasm? The issue is that these executions only create fear and intimidation and serve only a political purpose. All of the statistics show that while the number of executions have increased the number of drug-related crimes have not decreased at all.\" The campaign's list counter judiciary chief Sadegh Amoli Larijani's statement of December 21: \"I categorically deny any secret mass executions.... All executions are announced to my office...if anyone has information about executions anywhere that have been secret and without families' knowledge, let us know and we will investigate it.\"\n\nBeating of two political prisoners\n\nReports indicate that journalist Mehdi Mahmoudian, who was one of the first to report on the crimes committed in the Kahrizak detention center in the aftermath of the June 2009 presidential election, has been transferred to Ward 2-A of Evin Prison, which is controlled by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, and been beaten badly. Mahmoudian, who suffers from heart disease, is a member of the Islamic Iran Participation Front, the country's largest reformist party, which has been outlawed by the hardliners. He had been incarcerated in Gohar Dasht Prison in Karaj, west of Tehran. At least four young demonstrators were killed in Kahrizak, and dozens more were tortured. Mahmoudian, who was arrested in September 2009, wrote a letter to Khamenei from prison in which he detailed what had happened in Kahrizak.\n\nAnother political prisoner, human rights advocate Ali Ajami, who is incarcerated in Rajaei Shahr Prison near Karaj, was slapped by a security guard so severely that his ear was wounded and he had to be transferred to the prison's medical center.\n\nCopyright © 2012 Tehran Bureau\n\nFollow Tehran Bureau on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nA glorious career, a generous soul, and a mysterious death.\n\n[ profile ] Certain popular figures live on for centuries in Iranians' minds and hearts, from the legendary Rostam, Sohrab, and Esfandiar of Abolghasem Ferdowsi's epic Shahnameh (Book of Kings), to the ancient Persian king Cyrus the Great, to Mirza Taghi Khan Amir Kabir (1807-52), chief minister to Naser al-Din Shah of the Qajar dynasty and one of the first true Iranian reformers.\n\nPerhaps no such figure has been more popular over the past several decades than Gholamreza Takhti, the most famous wrestler in Iranian history. He was renowned for his chivalrous behavior and sportsmanship, but everyone also knew that he was a nationalist, a member of the National Front opposition to the rule of Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi, and an ardent supporter of Iran's national hero, Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddegh. January 7 was the 44th anniversary of his death, which shocked the nation not only because the beloved Takhti was just 37, but also because his death was, and still is, shrouded in secrecy. The Shah's government announced that Takhti had committed suicide, but almost no one believed it. I will never forget my own shock when I saw the headlines in the two leading newspapers, Ettelaat and Kayhan, that my father brought home every day.\n\nEarly life\n\nTakhti was born on August 27, 1930, to a pious Muslim family in Khani Abad, a poor neighborhood on the southern edge of Tehran. Years later, he would frequently go to Mashhad in northeast Iran and visit the shrine of Imam Reza, Shiites' Eighth Imam. He always professed his love and respect for Imam Ali, the First Imam and cousin and son-in-law of the Prophet Muhammad. As a consequence of his religious beliefs, he always led a simple, squeaky-clean life.\n\nTakhti's grandfather, Haji Gholi, owned a supermarket in Khani Abad. He would sit on an elevated seat, called takht in Persian and was thus known as Haji takhti. When in the 1920s the government of Reza Shah, the founder of the Pahlavi dynasty, decided to issue all Iranians birth certificates and identity cards, everyone had to have a family name, and Takhti became the last name of Haji Gholi. Takhti's father, Rajab Khan Takhti, was an unsuccessful merchant, to the point that he had to mortgage his home to support his family. When he could not pay back his debt, they were thrown out. Takhti himself said years later that they were forced to live on the street for three days. They finally rented two rooms in a house in the neighborhood. The elder Takhti passed away when Gholamreza was very young, leaving his wife (pictured) and five children -- three sons and two daughters, Gholamreza the youngest of the five -- in relative poverty. This had a deep effect on Takhti, and years later he used his fame to help poor Iranians.\n\nTakhti graduated from Hakim Nezami Elementary School and went to Manouchehri High School. Due to his family's financial difficulties, he was able to attend only through the ninth grade before he had to drop out. He first worked for the National Iranian Oil Company in Masjed Soleiman, in oil-rich Khuzestan province. After returning to Tehran, he was drafted into the army in 1948, and was also employed by Iran's national railroad.\n\nWrestling career\n\nTakhti began learning wrestling and what is called in Iran varzesh-e zurkhaneh (literally, house-of-strength sport), which combines lifting, wrestling, aerobics, and other strenuous exercises. His first trainer was Seyyed Ali Haghshenas Kamyab (1906-73), known as Pahlavan Seyyed Ali, who was considered the most powerful athlete in Tehran in the era preceding World War II. Beginning in 1950, Takhti began going regularly to Poulad Club on Shahpour Street in south Tehran. There, he attracted the attention of club president Hossein Rezizadeh, who perceived that Takhti had considerable wrestling talent. That same year he became a member of the national wrestling team. At the 1951 world championship competition, he won a silver medal, launching an illustrious wrestling career. Mahmoud Mollah Ghasemi also won silver, while Abdollah Mojtavabi and Mehdi Yaghoobi took bronze medals, marking the beginning of Iran as a world wrestling power, which it remains to this day.\n\nAt the 1952 Olympic Games, also held in Helsinki, Takhti again won a silver medal, after six victories and only one defeat. At the 1954 world championships, Takhti was unexpectedly defeated by a Swedish opponent in the semifinals. At the championships in Warsaw the following year, he took silver yet again. And then, at the Melbourne Olympic Games of 1956, he at last won a gold medal.\n\nIn the 1957 world championships, held in Istanbul, Takhti was eliminated early, simply because he was too light compared to his competitors in the 87-kilogram class. In 1958 and 1959, after defeating the late Hossein Nouri, Takhti was acclaimed as Iran's Pahlevan (most powerful man). At the 1958 Asian wrestling championships in Tokyo, Takhti won the gold; later that year, at the world championships in Sofia, he took silver. At the 1959 world championships, held in Tehran, he won gold. The next year, at the Rome Olympic Games, saw him win another silver medal. The greatest triumph for Iran's wrestlers came in 1961 at the world championships in Yokohama -- the team won five gold medals, including one by Takhti, along with a bronze.\n\nThe next year, at the world championship games in Toledo, Ohio, Takhti took the silver medal, but only because he was heavier than his opponent from the Soviet Union, Alexander Medved, by a mere 200 grams. He was also very ill, and was immediately taken to New York after the competition for surgery. Medved, who had become Takhti's fiercest competitor and would later be recognized as one of the greatest wrestlers of all time, always praised Takhti. He was particularly touched by the fact that, when they wrestled for gold in the 1962 finals, Takhti knew that one of Medved's feet was injured, but he never tried to attack it. The two subsequently became close friends. In his final Olympic appearance, at the Tokyo Games of 1964, Takhti ranked fourth in his weight class.\n\nEven though he was ready to retire from wrestling, his immense popularity among his countrymen persuaded him to accept a spot on the national team for the world championships of 1966, again held in Toledo. By then, he was active in the political opposition to the Shah, and the Pahlavi regime was concerned about him. The government repeatedly raised obstacles to his training regimen, which became common knowledge. On the day of his departure for the competition, thousands of people showed up at Mehrabad, Tehran's old airport, to see him off. Having been unable to properly train, Takhti was swiftly eliminated, and retired.\n\nTakhti was immensely popular, not only because of his illustrious career, but more importantly, due to his connection with common Iranians, his kindness to them, and in particular to poor people. He was once asked by a journalist which of his medals was the most important to him. \"The highest and best trophy that I have received is not a gold or silver medal,\" he said. \"A human's heart is worth thousands of gold medals, and I know that thousands of my compatriots have devoted a small part of their kind hearts to me.\"\n\nAlong with Emam Ali Habibi Goudarzi (who now lives in Texas) and Abdollah Movahed (who now lives in California), Takhti is in the Hall of Fame of FILA, the International Federation of Associated Wrestling Styles.\n\nSocial and political life\n\nTakhti married Shahla Tavakoli in November 1966. They had one son, Babak Takhti, who was born September 2, 1967, only four months before his father's death.\n\nEven 44 years after his death, Iranians still shares tales about Takhti's caring for the poor and needy. On September 1, 1962, a magnitude 7.1 earthquake shook Bouin Zahra, a large village west of Tehran. More than 12,200 people were killed and 21,000 homes were destroyed, leaving many thousands of people homeless. The government called on citizens around the country for assistance, but the response was not very strong. But when Takhti called on the people to help, the response was huge. He led a long line of trucks carrying aid for the people in the earthquake-ravaged areas. As a result, he became even more popular than ever.\n\nTakhti was also politically conscious. He joined the oil nationalization of 1951-53, and was an ardent supporter of Prime Minister Mosaddegh. After the CIA-sponsored coup of 1953 that overthrew the Mosaddegh government, Takhti was said to be very depressed and did not want to appear in public. In the summer of 1961, after he returned from Yokohama as world champion, he announced his membership in the Second National Front, which supported Mosaddegh. After the June 5, 1963, uprising, Takhti was elected to the Central Committee of the Second National Front. From then on, he was known as a member of the opposition, not only to the people, but also to the SAVAK, the Shah's security apparatus, which repeatedly summoned him for intimidatory questioning. After Mosaddegh passed away on March 5, 1966, under house arrest in the village of Ahmadabad outside Tehran, Takhti was among the prominent figures who participated in his funeral, despite repeated threats from SAVAK agents. He reportedly told them, \"Arrest me.\"\n\nOn one occasion when students at the University of Tehran staged a strike and sit-in, the campus was surrounded by security forces who prevented anyone from entering. Except for Takhti, who was allowed to bring in food for the striking students, which he continued to do until the sit-in ended.\n\nDeath\n\nOn January 7, 1968, the government announced that Takhti had committed suicide and that his lifeless body had been found in Tehran's Atlantic Hotel. Almost no one believed the official account. How could a pious, kind man like Takhti kill himself only four months after the birth of his son? The renowned author Jalal Al-e Ahmad (1923-69) wrote of Takhti's funeral, \"In that vast crowd, no one was thinking about the possibility of suicide even for one moment.\" Speculation continues about the real cause of his death. (The last two days of his life have been chronicled here.)\n\nHis funeral, organized by Hossein Towfigh, editor-in-chief and publisher of the satire magazine Towfigh, was attended by hundreds of thousands. Towfigh devoted a special issue to Takhti's death in which he was depicted as an angel, flying high above the throngs of mourners at his own funeral. The caption read, \"Do not cry for me, cry for your own plight\" -- a direct reference to the Shah's dictatorship and repression of the Iranian people. Towfigh also coined a memorable phrase, \"Takhti raa khodkoshi kardand\" (Takhti was killed, but they said he committed suicide). The magazine was barred from publishing by the Shah for several months.\n\nTakhti is buried at Ebn-e Babooyeh Cemetery in south Tehran, near Rey, in the mausoleum of Shamshiri, the owner of a famous restaurant in Tehran, also believed to be a member of the opposition. Decades after his death, he is still commemorated every year by his fans. Ali Hatami, the renowned film director, began work on a movie about him, Jahan Palevan Takhti (World Champion Takhti), before he passed away in 1996. The movie, which examines some of the theories about Takhti's death, was finished the following year by director and screenwriter Behrooz Afkhami. Siavash Kasraei, Mehdi Soheili, and Mehdi Akhavan Sales have composed beautiful poems in Takhti's memory. His son, Babak, who has no direct recollection of Takhti, has written a book about him, In Search of My Father.\n\nWhen the news of Takhti's death spread, the Iranian nation went into mourning. At least seven people killed themselves due to their sadness. One, a butcher in Kermanshah, left a note saying, \"A world without the world's champion is not a place to live.\" A boxer in Rey, where Takhti visited frequently, had heard that Takhti had ended his life due to problems with his wife, which had prompted him to attack her. After he found out that Takhti had actually mentioned her in his will very respectfully, and had said that in his absence she should raise young Babak, the boxer was so ashamed that he killed himself. His grave is only a short distance from Takhti's.\n\nCopyright © 2012 Tehran Bureau\n\nFollow Tehran Bureau on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nStressed monetary markets prompt rank speculation, threaten rampant inflation.\n\n[ dispatch ] The first sign of trouble appeared in the gold market. There has always been a strong demand for gold and gold coinage in Iran, as Iranians have traditionally saved in the precious metal. \"I never lose money buying gold,\" said Simin, a 50-year-old retired teacher and mother of four grown children. \"Even during the war, I registered for Bahar-e Azadi coins [the Islamic Republic's official gold coins]. They are easy to hide and easy to trade. When I need cash, all I need to do is go into the first jewelry store and sell them at market price.\" Few became alarmed as gold prices began to increase in Tehran; after all, the gold market was on the upswing globally. According to an economist at the Central Bank of Iran (CBI), \"Gold was rising everywhere, and it was only natural to see prices increasing in Tehran. Although sometimes the price of gold in Tehran was more expensive than its price in the global market, sometimes it was lower.\"\n\nBut as the price of gold continued to climb, many more started to invest in it. Laleh, a 32-year-old artist and designer, was one. \"I used most of my savings to buy gold in the summer of 2010,\" she said. \"Since then, it has gained almost 50 percent in value.\" That sort of return, which few investments can hope to offer, triggered even greater demand. As demand shot up, the CBI tried to stem it. Central Bank President Mahmoud Bahmani announced on several occasions that there was enough gold for everyone. These proclamations seemed only to fan the flames. Finally, last May, the CBI announced that it would sell no more than five Bahar-e Azadi coins to each citizen; the transaction would be noted in their national ID cards. This too failed to restrain the market, and prices kept rising. People began to queue in long lines to purchase their five coins. Entrepreneurial types were on the scene too, hiring others to stand in line for them. \"Renting someone,\" as the practice came to be called, became very common and the term entered everyday parlance.\n\nAt one point this past December, Khabar Online, a news website associated with economic conservatives, reported, \"The price for one's place in the line is up to 40,000 tomans\" -- 400,000 rials, or $35 at the time. Banks currently sell each gold piece at 60,000 tomans below market price. \"One can make up to 300,000 tomans by staying awake and standing in line for the whole night,\" Noosha, an accounting major, told me. \"See, it is easy to make money. Who needs a job in this country?\" She said that she and her mother had made about three million tomans in this fashion.\n\nBut it had its dangers. \"When the bank employees tried to close the doors, yelling 'tamoom shod' [sold out], people would yell back 'na, nashodeh' [no, it's not]. Then the people closest to the door would start to fight and beat each other up,\" she said, describing the tense atmosphere. There were stories of people getting stabbed in these quarrels.\n\nSome economists suggested that the government should sell gold certificates to calm the market. Right before Christmas, the CBI announced that it would offer gold prepurchase certificates for sale, hoping it would quell the public hunger. But again the announcement did little to stabilize the market.\n\n\"People trust the real thing, not the promise of it,\" explained Mohammad, an economic analyst with a private bank in Tehran. \"Paper [documents] and certificates do not do well in Iran -- the market is too volatile. Plus, ordinary people are not very familiar with papers and bonds. So they prefer to have the real thing.\" Besides, people in Iran do not trust government promissory scrip. Of course, CBI gold certificates are being purchased on the market, but still the price of gold keeps rising.\n\nFor now at least, the government is more concerned with another market: hard currency.\n\nTo understand Iran's currency exchange market, one must recall what the Iranian economy was like in the 1980s. For a decade, the Iranian government kept the official exchange rate for the U.S. dollar at 10 percent of its black market value. Many government agencies sold their allocated dollars on the streets of Tehran to make ends meet. According to Mohammad, the bank analyst, \"In the '80s, Iranian households learned how to find ways to benefit from the opportunities created by the government's meddling in the market and its subsidies.\" At one point during the following decade, Iran had three different official dollar exchange rates: one for industries, one for tourists, and one for government agencies. It was no small achievement when the administration of President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani was able to introduce a single exchange rate for the dollar. This policy was upheld under Mohammad Khatami.\n\nKhatami's successor, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, wanted to maintain a fixed exchange rate, however, so this single-rate regime became untenable. As early as 2010, Iranian economists warned about the growing gap between the government's official exchange rate and the dollar's true market value, and the consequent profit-making opportunities. Still, the growing demand for hard currency did not destabilize the market for a time. This eventually changed in response to political developments.\n\nAs the United States led its allies in an effort to curb the Islamic Republic's nuclear ambitions, the Iranian economy came under siege from increasingly severe sanctions. The targeting of its oil industry has restricted its market, and the country now often receives commodities instead of hard currency in return for the oil it sells. Banking sanctions have drastically complicated many international financial transactions; their cost has soared and many Iranian businesses have been forced to use third parties to transfer money.\n\n\"Emirate banks started to tell us they cannot open accounts or lines of credit for us Iranian businesses,\" said Mehdi, who operates an export-import office out of Dubai. \"This has made us miserable, since we can't send funds to either our partners in Iran or abroad.\" And that was just the beginning. As regulations continued to tighten, Mehdi and his colleagues grew ever more fearful of the day they would find their accounts shut down all together. His company reduced its dealings with Iran and sought less risky opportunities elsewhere. The supply of paper money began to decline in Tehran shortly after sanctions were imposed on Iran's banking sector, with a domino effect on Iranian consumers.\n\nMuhammad said, \"There is always a strong demand for paper money in Iran; it is caused by demand for foreign travel and imported products, as well as household demand for savings in hard currency.\" Any shortage of paper money in the market can trigger a spike in the exchange rate, and this is exactly what happened. As the market became more aware of the shortage of paper money and the growing force behind the sanctions, average Iranians started to realize something: \"The dollar's real value is much more than its nominal value,\" in Muhammad's words.\n\nMany began to purchase dollars through official channels with the intention of selling them on the streets of Tehran to make some extra income. Some spirited individuals gather passports and purchase tickets for the passport holders from travel agencies so they can collect their allocated dollars at the official price. Mina, a saleswoman at a Tehran travel agency, has seen many such transactions. \"One day a gentleman came in to buy 40 tickets for a Tehran-Yerevan flight, and then he came back three days before the flight to cancel them all. He paid a cancellation fee for each. Still, he made a good profit collecting those passengers' allocated dollars.\" Mina's observation is not unique. Iranian consumers have long learned to take advantage of such opportunities to make ends meet.\n\nAs more people turned to the exchange market for speculation purposes, the sanctions further reduced the supply of paper money. The CBI had to prioritize and the government set allowances for individuals with different needs: $500 for foreign ground travel, $2,000 for foreign air travel, up to $12,500 per semester for Iranians studying abroad. Hamed, a student who came to Tehran for his Christmas holiday, spent most of his time standing in lines in front of the Ministry of Higher Education. \"I do not need the cash, since I have an assistantship, but I can receive my tuition at the government rate. Down the street they give me 30 percent more than what I have to pay the ministry in rials. It is good business!\" I asked him about the ethics of what he was doing. \"Are you kidding?\" he exclaimed. \"Everybody goes for it. Why should I bother when the government has approved this?\"\n\nGood business, indeed, still it seems that speculators have maneuvered the government into a corner. Just this week, the CBI reduced the foreign air travel allowance to $1,000. And Bank Mellat has stopped selling dollars to students. The imposition of sanctions on the CBI roiled the market. The exchange rate skyrocketed to 1,800 tomans (18,000 rials) per dollar. \"That was a shock,\" says the CBI economist. \"The market could stabilize around 15,000 rials per dollar. The problem is our prospects do not look too good and the market knows this.\" There is little doubt that the currency exchange market will remain volatile.\n\nWhat does this means for Iranian businesses? Yasser, who sells electronics, cellphones, and computer parts in central Tehran, knows that the days ahead will be difficult. \"We rely on imports, and imports are going to be costly.... An increase in the value of the dollar always signals an increase in the cost of household items. We rely on imports for everything: food, technical parts, and clothing.\" He predicts, \"All prices will go up in a few months, maybe sooner. Then people will be frustrated and under even heavier pressure than before to make ends meet.\" Who can blame Tehran housewives for buying gold and dollars? They know that they might soon have to sell them to put bread on the table.\n\nThe government has been subjected to heavy criticism for these developments. The Majles summoned Ahmadinejad and some deputies have asked for the CBI president's resignation. Ahmadinejad has told angry legislators, \"Honestly, our economy is doing fine.\" It seems he is the only one who thinks so. He has to act so, at least, what with the upcoming parliamentary elections. His hardline rivals will not hesitate to blame him for the country's economic woes. The stakes for average Iranians are high as it is, but for Ahmadinejad this might be the last battle.\n\nAli Chenar is a pen name.\n\nCopyright © 2012 Tehran Bureau\n\nFollow Tehran Bureau on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nPress Roundup provides a selected summary of news from the Farsi and Arabic press and excerpts where the source is in English.

You can follow breaking news stories on our Twitter feed.\n\nIran Standard Time (IRST), GMT+3:30\n\n9:30 p.m., 20 Dey/January 10 In an article in the newspaper Ettelaat, Hossein Alaei, a former high-ranking officer in the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, made an implicit comparison between Iran during the revolutionary era of 1978-79, and what happened in the aftermath of the June 2009 presidential elections. The article appeared on the 34th anniversary of the bloody demonstrations that took place in Qom on January 9, 1978, the day after Ettelaat published an article by an unknown author with the pseudonym Ahmad Rashidi Motlagh that insulted Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. Alaei (seen here in an image from the 1980s) wrote that before that event and in its immediate aftermath, ordinary Iranians did not target the Shah directly, but \"the continuation of the violent crackdown on the people's protests forced people to directly oppose the Shah himself.... After those events, people began addressing letters to the Shah, and he was correctly identified as the main culprit and responsible for the state of the nation. People then decided to prevent anyone from ruling over them permanently.\" Alaei then posed several hypothetical questions that the Shah could have asked himself:\n\n\"Would the problem have ended had I allowed the people to demonstrate peacefully and not accused them of confronting the government?\"\n\n\"Would I have not gotten a better outcome had I ordered the security forces not to shoot at the people and just try to calm them down?\"\n\n\"Would I have had to leave the country had I not put some of the statesmen and political activists under house arrest and not exiled others, and instead opened discussions with them?\"\n\n\"Would I have had to take refuge in a foreign land had I not insulted the people's collective wisdom and not called them agents of foreign countries?\"\n\n\"Would I have not lasted longer in my rule had I not accused the people of acting against the nation's national security, accepted the opposition, and even recognized their right [to oppose me]?\"\n\nAlaei concluded with a well-known Qur'anic verse: \"Thus, learn your lesson you who have eyes.\"\n\nThough he never mentions Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, it is clear that Alaei is comparing Khamenei and his rule with the Shah and his regime.\n\nThis is a very significant article from a well-positioned figure who has always been loyal to the Islamic Republic. Alaei was one of the top Revolutionary Guard commanders during the Iran-Iraq War, and the first commander of the Guard navy when it was founded in 1985. He also served as Guard chief of staff, deputy defense minister, and head of the Defense Ministry's aerospace division. He is now on the faculty of Imam Hossein University, which is linked to the Guards, and managing editor of the monthly Sanaa-ye Havaaei (Aerospace Industries). In his 15th letter to Khamenei, journalist and documentary filmmaker Mohammad Nourizad, who used to be an ardent supporter of the Supreme Leader, praised Alaei and asked him to write a letter to Khamenei. Alaei's article seems to be his response to the request.\n\nInterestingly, commemorating the same occasion, an item in the newspaper Jomhouri-ye Eslami, whose editor-in-chief, Masih Mohajeri, is close to Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, discussed in detail the recent events in Egypt, before and after the downfall of former President Hosni Mubarak. The article ended with a declaration: \"Dictators must learn the lesson from what happened to the Pharaohs.\"\n\nIAEA confirms uranium enrichment underway at Fordow\n\n\"The International Atomic Energy Agency can confirm that Iran has begun enriching uranium at Fordow enrichment facility,\" said agency spokesman Gill Tudor. \"All the nuclear materials at this facility are safeguarded and under control by the IAEA.\" The Fordow facility, near Qom, has been built under a mountain, presumably to protect it from bombardment and other forms of military attack.\n\nIran has not officially announced that it has begun enrichment activities at Fordow. Speaking at a ceremony marking the beginning of an exhibition of the progress of Iran's nuclear industry at the University of Hormozagan in southern Iran, Dr. Fereydoon Abbasi Davani, the president of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, said, \"Wait for a few weeks for good nuclear news.\" He also said that the Fordow facility \"will soon officially open,\" and will be able to produce uranium at 3.5, 4, and 20 percent enrichment. Al-Arabiya, the website that reflects the views of Saudi Arabia, was the first to report that the enrichment had already begun. Reacting to the subsequent international media coverage, Ali Asghar Soltanieh, Iran's permanent representative to the IAEA, said that all of Iran's nuclear activities are being monitored by the agency. In a separate interview with ISNA, the Iranian Students News Agency, Soltanieh said that the international reaction to the news has been \"exaggerated.\" He added that the IAEA was notified about Fordow more than two years ago, and the agency's inspectors are present at the facility and monitor everything \"24 hours a day.\"\n\nIranian media outlets have largely silent about the issue. Aftab News, the website that is close to Rafsanjani, reported that according to Reuters, quoting Al-Arabiya, the enrichment activity had begun. Mashregh News, the website with links to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, also only referenced the Reuters report.\n\nAbbasi also said that no date has yet been set for the planned visit of a team of IAEA officials and experts to Iran, that the first batch of fuel for the Tehran Research Reactor produced within Iran will soon be used, and that \"the enemy\" is trying \"to terrify our youth by assassinating our nuclear experts and scientists.\"\n\nSpeaking on CBS's Face the Nation on Sunday, U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta said Iran is laying the groundwork for making nuclear weapons someday, but is not yet building a bomb. He called for continued diplomatic and economic pressure to persuade Tehran not to take that step. He also cautioned against a unilateral strike by Israel against Iran's nuclear facilities, saying the action could trigger Iranian retaliation against U.S. forces in the region. \"We have common cause here\" with Israel, he said. \"And the better approach is for us to work together.\"\n\nPotential successors to Central Bank governor\n\nAs noted here, Central Bank Governor Mahmoud Bahmani has threatened to resign unless he is given much greater freedom to do his work. There is considerable speculation in the Iranian media about his possible successor, should he resign. Shafaf, the website close to Tehran Mayor Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf, has suggested two potential successors. One is Hamid Baghaei, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's vice president for executive affairs, who is despised by the hardliners and has been accused of corruption. The second is Mohammad Reza Farzin, currently deputy economic and financial affairs minister and secretary-general of the Commission for Targeted Subsidies, formed last year to manage the elimination of subsidies on basic food items and energy.\n\nBahmani, who was appointed to his post in September 2008, has been under tremendous pressure by the hardliners, due to the wide fluctuations in the foreign currencies market and the lack of oversight by the Central Bank, which they believe has led to widespread corruption. He recently said, \"We should run the nation in a way that we can preserve ourselves for two years. It appears that we have been trapped in Shoab abi Taleb.\" This is a reference to the site where Muslims believe the Prophet Muhammad and his supporters were surrounded for three years and grew so hungry that they beat their abdomens with rocks.\n\nKhamenei predicts big turnout for Majles elections\n\nIn a meeting with clerics from Qom, Khamenei claimed that the turnout for the Majles elections, to be held on March 3, will be large and \"will break the enemy['s back].\" Speaking on Monday at a commemoration of the Qom demonstrations of 1978, he said, \"Since quite some time ago, the enemy and its foot soldiers and minions, both in Iran and outside, have been trying to minimize participation in the elections.\" He predicted that 65 percent of those eligible will cast votes. Khamenei also rejected Bahmani's warning about the dire state of the economy, and suggested instead that the Islamic Republic is under the same conditions that Muslims were during the Prophet's era at the time of the Badr and Kheibar wars, in which Muslims were victorious.\n\nOne day earlier, Basij commander Brigadier General Mohammad Reza Naghdi, said that Rafsanjani has met with Khamenei to persuade him to allow the reformists to run in the Majles elections, but the Supreme Leader responded that he will not work with the reformists under any circumstances. Meanwhile, every reformist group in the country has called for a boycott of the elections; in fact, for the first time in the history of the Islamic Republic, there is virtually unanimous agreement in the opposition, both inside Iran and in the diaspora, about the necessity of a boycott.\n\nOn Sunday, an Intelligence Ministry official claimed, \"Four people who had been organizing [social] networks and carrying out anti-security operations against the elections have been identified and arrested. The arrested people had received sophisticated instruments from the enemy for secret communications and were organizing networks to create disturbances in the country.\"\n\nArrests of journalists and political activists continue\n\nThe arrests of three well-known activists and journalists have been confirmed. Dr. Saeed Madani, member of the central committee of the Nationalist-Religious Coalition (NRC), was first arrested in March 2001, together with several other members of the NRC. After spending 12 months in prison -- five of those in solitary confinement -- he was finally released after he posted $250,000 bail. Reports indicate that his wife might have also been arrested. He had been threatened over the past several weeks by the security forces. Unconfirmed reports indicate that Dr. Madani's nephew has also been arrested in Isfahan.\n\nEhsan Houshmand, 43, another member of the NRC, has also been arrested. In his work Houshmand has emphasized relying on Iranians' national identity, the need to protect Iran's territorial integrity, and the problems with Iran's ethnic minorities. He was first arrested in January 2010, but was released after a while. Reports indicate that he was arrested by Iran's drug enforcement administration, but the reason for such an arrest is not clear. Read an interview with him here.\n\nOver the past 30 months, the pressure on the nationalist-religious activists has increased dramatically. Nationalist-religious journalists Dr. Ahmad Zeidabadi, Keyvan Samimi, and Dr. Alireza Rajaei have been imprisoned. Emad Bahavar, head of the youth division of the Liberation Movement of Iran, has been in jail since 2010. Mohammad Tavasoli, head of the NRC's central committee, was arrested in November 2011, as was his son-in-law Farid Taheri. Tavasoli's daughter, Leila Tavasoli, has also been in prison since early 2010. Masoud Pedram, another nationalist-religious activist, is in detention as well.\n\nAlso arrested is journalist Fatemeh Kheradmand, wife of journalist Masoud Lavasani. It has been speculated that she was arrested because of her work organizing the families of political prisoners. Lavasani was arrested in the aftermath of the June 2009 presidential election and sentenced to two years of incarceration. He was released only recently after serving his sentence.\n\nIn addition to Madani, Houshmand, and Kheradmand, Dr. Mehdi Khazali, blogger, dissident, and son of the reactionary cleric Ayatollah Abolghasem Khazali, was arrested on Monday. According to his wife he was arrested at his work. Security agents attacked him, broke a bone in his hand and his teeth, and then took him away.\n\nMahmoud Dardkeshan, a political activist who was close to the late Grand Ayatollah Hossein Ali Montazeri, is also under arrest. He has been arrested five previous times and has spent many years in prison.\n\nHuman rights news\n\nDistinguished journalist Isa Saharkhiz has been hospitalized for nearly a month, but his family has been under pressure not to talk publicly about his hospitalization. He suffers from blood pressure fluctuations and severe pain in his back and neck, to the point that he has been forced to use a wheelchair.\n\nProminent attorney and human rights advocate Abdolfattah Soltani, who has been in prison since September 10, 2011, refused to defend himself during his trial. The reason, according to his daughter Maedeh Soltani, was twofold. First, he has demanded his trial to be with a jury and open to the public, in accordance with Article 168 of the Constitution, and second, he believes that his arrest has been unlawful.\n\nJavad Lari, a political prisoner who spent five years in jail in the 1980s for allegedly supporting the Mojahedin-e Khalgh Organization, has been sentenced to death again. He was arrested in September 2009 and sentenced to death by the notorious judge Abolghasem Salavati. That sentence was nullified by the Supreme Court, but Salavati has now sentenced Lari to death a second time. It has been reported that his interrogator in the 1980s has met with him in jail and has told him that he has lived \"20 extra years,\" and that he will soon be executed. Lari is in his 60s.\n\nDr. Ghasem Sholeh Sadi, professor of international law at the University of Tehran and former Majles deputy, is on the verge of becoming paralyzed from waist down, due to lack of medical attention in jail. He wrote an open letter in 2002, after which it was arrested and sentenced to 30 months of imprisonment for \"insulting the Supreme Leader.\" He was arrested last year again by the security forces in order to enforce his sentence.\n\nLabor and university activist Meysam Nejati Aref was arrested on January 3, and it is still not clear where he is being held. He is a student at Islamic Azad University in Karaj and also works at Saipa, Iran's second largest car manufacturer.\n\nCopyright © 2012 Tehran Bureau\n\nFollow Tehran Bureau on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nOn the importance of always changing, and never backing down.\n\n[ interview ] Abdi Behravanfar was born in 1975 in Mashhad, Khorasan, in northeastern Iran. By most standards, he began pursuing a career as a musician rather late in the day, but he quickly acquired an avid following among Iranian youth with a sound that melds popular Western styles -- rock, country, and blues -- with the rich heritage of Iranian folk music. His audience is a generation hungry for music that breaks with the past, understands the common frustrations of the time, and eschews the gaudy frivolity of the Tehrangeles pop scene.\n\nThis interview provides insight into Behravanfar's development as a musician, including his years of collaborative work with singer Mohsen Namjoo; it also charts the trials and tribulations of Iranian musicians and the underground music scene. Struggling under hostile conditions in an environment rife with censorship, such artists continue to undertake daring and potentially subversive work, even while striving to make ends meet.\n\nThe following is an edited translation of an interview originally conducted in Persian.\n\n***\n\nWhen and where did you first get seriously interested in music?\n\nI was 23 years old when I bought a guitar. The reason I bought it was the result of a number of bitter events that had occurred in my personal life. I was after something that would save me from the tragic state of affairs in which I found myself. All those bitter and traumatic events that I wished to [push to] the background occurred during my years as a university student, and led to my giving up my degree in industrial engineering at Azad University in Tehran. Financial hardship and my emotional well-being at the time caused me to return to my hometown of Mashhad. It was during those dark days that I became acquainted with a man by the name of Mr. Farhadi, an encounter that changed the course of my life. He was a professor at the Polytechnic Institute of New York University and had a profound familiarity with Western music. After a short time we became very close and spoke a great deal about music. One day, during just such a conversation, Mr. Farhadi in complete seriousness said to me, \"Abdi! Instead of studying engineering, you must buy a guitar!\"\n\nSo before this encounter you hadn't considered playing the guitar or becoming a musician?\n\nWell, I had. From my childhood, I wanted to play guitar but my mother in particular had a problem with this instrument and was never prepared to buy one for me. She did"
