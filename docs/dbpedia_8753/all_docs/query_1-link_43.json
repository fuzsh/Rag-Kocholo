        "text": "Iran's state TV broadcast a video on Sunday of 28-year-old Amir Mirzaei Hekmati allegedly confessing to spying on Iran for the USA.\n\nHekmati claimed he was a CIA spy who sought to infiltrate Iran's secret services. The TV station said he had received special training and served at US military bases before heading to Iran.\n\nBut his father, Ali Hekmati, told The Associated Press that his son was visiting his grandmother in Tehran when he was detained and never worked for the CIA.\n\n\"He is not a spy. It's a whole bunch of lies on my good son,\" said Ali Hekmati, a microbiology professor at Mott Community College in Flint, northwest of Detroit. \"They have lied about any American ... captured in Iran for visiting or tourism, or for any other reason.\"\n\nThe CIA declined to comment, as did State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland.\n\nIran and the US are locked in a complicated intelligence and technological battle, and the video of Hekmati comes weeks after Iran first displayed a nearly intact American spy drone that it claims it captured and brought down. US officials say the unmanned aircraft malfunctioned and has demanded Iran return the top-secret aircraft. Iran has refused.\n\nAli Hekmati said his son was a former Arabic translator in the US Marines who entered Iran about four months ago. At the time, he was working in Qatar as a contractor for a company \"that served the Marines,\" his father said, without providing more specific details.\n\n\"My wife tried to talk him out of it,\" Ali Hekmati said of the visit to Iran. \"The first two weeks went without incident. The third week in Tehran, some people visited him and took him away. Nobody heard from him in the next three months.\"\n\nHe later saw on a YouTube broadcast of an Iranian programme that said Amir was \"locked up\" and accused of \"being a spy for the CIA.\"\n\n\"I have no idea what they are going to do with my son,\" he said. \"I'm worried to death. I love my son. I'm very sorry he's in the predicament he's in.\" He said he's working with attorneys in Tehran to gain his son's release.\n\nAmir Hekmati was born in Arizona and graduated from Central High School in Flint. From there, his son joined the Marines, the 61-year-old Ali Hekmati said.\n\nFrom March to August 2010, the younger Hekmati worked for BAE Systems, said company spokesman Brian Roehrkasse. He said Hekmati left the company to take a position with the US government as a civilian employee, but he did not have additional details.\n\nIran periodically announces the capture or execution of alleged US or Israeli spies, and often no further information is released.\n\nEarlier this month, the family of a retired FBI agent who vanished in Iran in March 2007 released a video in which he makes a plea to his kidnappers. The US government has said it has no evidence of who is holding him, and Iran has denied involvement.\n\nIn September, Iran released two Americans that were held in a Tehran prison for more than two years after they were arrested, along with another American who was released in 2010, along the Iraq-Iran border. Iranian officials accused the three of spying for the US, but they say they were innocent and had gotten lost while hiking."
