The mujahidden are still fighting with their full strength, it said.\n\nThe editorial advised readers not to pay attention to \"false reports about mujahidden from the hypocritical media\" and to continue the struggle.\n\nThe fight, the editorial said, will continue till the US is removed from Muslim countries and an Islamic Caliphate is established.\n\nAn anonymous essay spoke of the need for another bin Laden who would fight non-Muslims and defend Muslims. The magazine thanked the many wings of al Qaeda all over the world.\n\nHiteen does not carry the name of the editor and the only way to send feedback is through two email addresses.\n\nA police officer of the Counter-Terrorism Department in Lahore, speaking on condition of anonymity, said police had knowledge of the magazine and that copies of it were in their record.\n\nHe said police would soon uncover who was responsible for publishing and circulating Hiteen.\n\nhttp://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/Pakistan/Al-Qaeda-delivers-magazine-to-homes-in-Pak-to-preach-jihad/Article1-793512.aspx\n\n----------\n\nIslamic Reform Movement Again Targets Indonesian Church\n\nVento Saudale, January 08, 2012, Radical groups added pressure on the congregation of GKI Yasmin church in Bogor as they shouted and chased its members during a Sunday service near the contested religious building.\n\nMembers of the Islamic Reform Movement (Garis) shouted at church-goers who were approaching their facility, prompting police officers to come and control the mob.\n\n“We are not afraid of the officers. If the Yasmin congregation is not dismissed, we will deploy a bigger group,” said Garis coordinator Majudien.\n\nAl Khaththath, head of the Bogor branch of the Islamic People’s Forum (FUI), said the absence of a firm stance from the government to settle the issue could set a time bomb for a bigger clash.\n\n“It is over the line now. When the public anger accumulates to boiling point, the public will take action, disregarding the government,” Al Khaththath said.\n\nYasmin spokesman Bona Sigalingging said the pressure on the congregation was intense every Sunday, when the congregation was forced to hold its service on the sidewalk.\n\nTwo weeks ago, the Christmas service was held at a member’s home and last week, the Garis coordinator used a bumper sticker on a church member’s car that read “We need a friendly Islam, not an angry Islam” as an excuse to threaten the congregation.\n\n“Pressure by intolerant groups is becoming increasingly offensive and direct against us. They even chased us when we approached our cars,” Bona said. “I have nothing left to say about what the congregation is feeling now. Our church has been sealed illegally by the Bogor mayor, and recently us just walking close to the church has been banned. Do you call this justice?”\n\nBona said the members awaited final decision from the president after the Supreme Court ordered the mayor to reopen the church, international organizations condemned the closure and the Ombudsman reported its findings.\n\n“We can only wait the next action by President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono,” Bona said.\n\nPolice denied taking sides in the dispute involving the congregation, the mayor and the radical groups.\n\n“Our job is to keep the order and anyone who breaks order and security will face actions from us,” said Comr. Sahroni, head of the Bogor Police’s operation desk.\n\nhttp://www.thejakartaglobe.com/news/islamic-reform-movement-again-targets-indonesian-church/489936\n\n---------\n\nIslamophobia in China: Violence Breaks Out in Xinjiang\n\nJANUARY 9, 2012\n\nWestern China is far from the happiest place in which to be Muslim right now. At the end of December, police killed seven people in Xinjiang, an area traditionally dominated by the Uighur Muslim ethnic group, using some very sketchy justifications. Days later, the government destroyed a mosque in Ningxia that was just set to reopen after refurbishment, prompting a fight in which at least two more people were killed. The details available on these events have been sparse and often in stark contradiction. It might seem as though we have wandered back in time to the Cultural Revolution, but we’re looking at a very twenty-first century brand of Islamophobia, infused with a legacy of ethnic tensions.\n\nWhat happened in Xinjiang? The state claimed that police officers confronted a group of fifteen men who had kidnapped two people, and the kidnappers were Muslim extremists or terrorists off to “jihadist training” across the border. Government media sources and spokespeople refuse to specify the ethnic origins of the fifteen. One police officer was also killed.\n\nNon-state media sources are reporting that this group was all Uighur, included children, and was attempting to escape Chinese repression. Other members of the group were taken into custody, and their fates are unknown. It’s far from the first time state information on violence involving Muslims has been questionable, as Edward Wong catalogues at the New York Times. There’s a lot that’s disturbing about this story, from implying that killing a group of people for supposedly kidnapping would somehow justify the killings, that they were killed in front of children, and that these people weren’t welcome in China, but weren’t allowed to leave, either.\n\nAs for Ningxia? Taoshan villagers raised USD $127 000 to renovate their mosque. After Friday prayers, the day before the opening ceremony, one hundred villagers faced one thousand soldiers and police officers. Three guesses how that went. The two confirmed dead are reported to have been elderly. This was so unexpected and unprecedented in this area that it sends a message of the state cracking down hard. That’s particularly so given that the soldiers and officers weren’t sent out until the mosque was completed, and all the more so following on immediately from the Uighur deaths.\n\nA major difference between what happened here and what happened in Xinjiang is that the Taoshan Muslims, who say they’ve never experienced religious persecution before, are Hui. China’s biggest Muslim ethnicity, the Chinese-speaking Hui have been far better treated and tolerated by the state than any other Muslim group as they have been considered more properly Chinese – or at least they have been since the mid-twentieth century state classification of ethnic groups. (This is not at all to endorse the sentiment in the piece linked at the start of the last paragraph that Hui “are practically indistinguishable from the Han”. One wonders to whom they are practically indistinguishable.)\n\nHistorically, then, China has not been kind to Muslim minorities, and there have been fatal Han/Uighur clashes in recent years, notably in Urumqi in 2009 when some Uighur people attacked Han Chinese, followed by a counterattack. If you’re interested in the relationship between Muslims and the Chinese state, I recommend you consult the historians Dru C. Gladney and Maris Boyd Gillette, but I’ll give you a brief rundown. It was state policy to suppress religious expression from 1949 until 1979, and they’re still not happy about it. Fostering of religious practices under the banner of minority ethnic customs has been on the rise since the 1990s. During this time, Hui gained permission to build mosques, and rebuild those that were destroyed during the Cultural Revolution; you can imagine that the Taoshan destruction must have affected worshippers very badly indeed. Ethnic minorities have been given government entitlements like tax-relief programs and permission to have more than one child. However, as Gillette argues, such measures were designed to counteract imagined substandard development in relation to the Han majority, justifying the state idea of a racial hierarchy. Minority customs and holidays in particular have been exoticised and commodified by the state, including through domestic tourism. And, then, the violence.\n\nWhat’s going on here is that the Chinese government has a serious longstanding problem with religious expression and ethnic minorities both. The kicker comes in with justifications for deaths, injuries and destruction of property that sound curiously like the kind of Islamophobia you’d hear in a white Western context. Jihadists? Extremists? An evil cult? At play here is the bizarre and unjustified fear of the Muslim other that has been running through Western discourse for years now, to be sure. It also reads like a calculated appropriation of that discourse to justify local prejudices and violences. This time, however, China gets to justify prejudice against Muslim minorities not only on the terms of its own racial hierarchy, and not just to a Han majority, but to the world on Western ones.\n\nIt’s hard to keep track of what’s going on for Hui, Uighur, and other Muslim ethnic groups in China, simply because the state is keeping such a tight lid on reports of the true stories. From what’s leaking through, it’s clear that the world should be keeping a sharp eye out, because existing ethnic divisions are only becoming more fraught in China as Islamophobia continues to percolate worldwide.\n\nhttp://globalcomment.com/2012/islamophobia-in-china-violence-breaks-out-in-xinjang/\n\n-------\n\nSalman Rushdie’s visa should be cancelled: Darul Uloom Deoband\n\nPTI\n\nMuzaffarnagar, January 9, 2012, Opposing controversial author Salman Rushdie’s visit to India, Islamic Seminary Darul Uloom Deoband today said the government should cancel his visa as he had hurt religious sentiments of Muslims in the past.\n\n65-year-old Rushdie, who had earned the wrath of Muslims worldwide due to his novel ‘The Satanic Verses’, is set to attend the Jaipur Literature Festival this month end.\n\n“Indian government should cancel his visa as Rushdie had annoyed the religious sentiments of Muslims in the past,” Maulana Abul Qasim Nomani, the Vice Chancellor of Darul uloom, said in a release.\n\nThe government should take into account the feelings of Muslims against Rushdie, he stressed.\n\nRushdie’s novel ‘The Satanic Verses’, which was banned by India, had sparked outrage in the Muslim world, including a fatwa against him by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the Supreme Leader of Iran, on February 14, 1989.\n\nThe Indian-origin Rushdie had earlier visited the literary extravaganza in the Pink city in 2007.\n\nOn January 21, Rushdie along with authors Rita Kothari and Tarun Tejpal is slated to discuss the nuances of English with noted writer Ira Pande on the topic ‘Inglish, Amlish, Hinglish: The chutnification of English’.\n\nhttp://books.hindustantimes.com/2012/01/salman-rushdies-visa-to-be-cancelled/\n\n--------\n\nPerpetrators in Pakistan acquitted in 77% of honour killing cases: Study\n\nISLAMABAD: January 09, 2012, Around 77 percent of honour killing cases ended in acquittal of the accused, a pilot study on “Honour Killing in Pakistan and Compliance of Law” revealed.\n\nThe study report was launched by Aurat Foundation’s Legislative Watch Programme for Women Empowerment, stressing the need for a consolidated plan of action to ensure implementation of the law against honour killing.\n\nThe author of the report, Maliha Zia, said that lack of data from courts, categorisation of First Information Reports (FIRs) and reluctance of the people to comment on honour killings were the main reasons affecting the implementation of the law.\n\nThe study showed that a lot of cases were highlighted in the media but were not reported with the police, and even if registered, not classified as honour killing.\n\nThe language used in the FIRs was not gender sensitive, she said, adding that courts usually gave decisions against the victims by using the provision of ‘grave and sudden provocation’. Maliha said that another factor which hindered the compliance of law was the fact that most of the ‘honour’ crimes were committed by family members, the `unwillingness’ of the family to lose another family member ended most of the cases in forced compromise.\n\nShe said the institutions concerned also lacked the commitment for implementation of the law. Commenting on the implementation of the law, Aurat Foundation Chief Operating Officer Naeem Ahmed Mirza stressed the need to look into the hurdles in the implementation of the law against honour killings, which was passed in 2004. app\n\nhttp://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2012\\01\\09\\story_9-1-2012_pg7_17\n\n--------\n\nAfghanistan to open embassy in Greece for refugees\n\nKABUL: January 09, 2012, Afghanistan will open an embassy in Greece to help thousands of Afghan asylum seekers stranded while seeking a better life in Europe, the foreign ministry in Kabul said on Sunday.\n\nThe embassy, to be opened around March, will provide illegal Afghans with travel documents, mainly so they can return home. “Afghanistan plans to open an embassy in Greece within a few months to assist illegal Afghan migrants by providing passports for them,” foreign ministry spokesman Janan Mosazai told reporters in Kabul.\n\nHe said 50,000 Afghans enter Greece via Turkey each year, but most end up in jails or get deported. There has been a surge in the number of Afghans leaving the war-weary country in the last five years, according to Afghanistan’s ministry of refugees.\n\nThe UN refugee agency UNHCR said that in 2010 more of the world’s refugees — some 30 percent — came from Afghanistan than any other country, with more than three million in 75 countries. afp\n\nhttp://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2012\\01\\09\\story_9-1-2012_pg14_3\n\n----------\n\nIndian foreign minister visits Israel after a decade\n\nPTI\n\nJERUSALEM: Jan 9, 2012, External affairs minister SM Krishna arrived here on a two-day visit to Israel, the first by an Indian foreign minister in over a decade, that comes amidst political turmoil in the Middle East.\n\nKrishna drove down from Jordan via the Allenby Bridge border post and was received by Indian envoy to Israel Navtej Sarna and officials of the Israeli Foreign Ministry here.\n\nKrishna, who is on a visit to the Middle East, had met his Jordanian counterpart Nasser Judeh on Sunday.\n\nThe minister's visit to Jordan came close on the heels of Amman playing host to Israeli and Palestinian negotiators on January 3, the first in more than a year.\n\nThe visit by Krishna is being seen as a means to understand the recent developments in the region.\n\nIndia looks at Jordan as a key nation in the region which is trying to revive the Middle East peace process, sources said, adding the country was also important for India's food security. Jordan is one of the crucial providers of fertiliser inputs like rock phosphate, phosphoric acid and potash.\n\nSources said various issues including the Arab Spring were discussed during the meeting between Krishna and Judeh.\n\nKrishna was apprised of the situation in the region and the Minister commended the Jordanian effort on the peace initiative between Israel and Palestinian Authority.\n\nKrishna is understood to have told his Jordanian counterpart that there is no problem that dialogue cannot solve issues and also reaffirmed India's stand on Palestine.\n\nOn the bilateral front, Jordan wished for a further cooperation at business to business level and expressed keenness to have a joint venture with India on supplying fertilizers.\n\nJordan also expressed interest in providing visa on arrival facility for Indians and pitched for an increase in bilateral trade.\n\nMeanwhile, during his visit here, Krishna is expected to meet Israeli President Shimon Peres and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, besides holding talks with deputy prime minister and foreign minister Avigdor Lieberman.\n\nCooperation in defence, security, agriculture and science and technology are expected to figure prominently in the discussions amid India's keenness to widen the scope of partnership in the field of defence, the sources said.\n\nThey said from a buyer-seller relationship, both sides are looking at expanding their relations.\n\nAnti-terror cooperation is also expected to figure in the discussions, against the backdrop of growth in this aspect of the relationship since the Mumbai 2008 attacks in which six Israeli nationals were killed.\n\nKrishna is scheduled to meet President Peres later in the evening. As per his schedule, Krishna will first visit the Holocaust Memorial and take a tour of the Indian Hospice in Jerusalem.\n\nAmbassador Sarna will also be hosting a reception for Krishna in Tel Aviv.\n\nKrishna's visit to Israel assumes significance because the last such trip took place in July 2000 when the then external affairs minister Jaswant Singh travelled here.\n\nhttp://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/Middle-East-turmoil-Indian-foreign-minister-visits-Israel-after-a-decade/articleshow/11424889.cms\n\n----------\n\nReligious freedom should begin at home\n\nBY MICHAEL DEN TANDT,\n\nJANUARY 9, 2012 2:10 AM\n\nAs they get set to roll out Canada's new Office of Religious Freedom, Conservatives face suspicion from opposition benches, as well as from left-leaning human rights organizations such as Amnesty International, that this is a clumsily-disguised attempt to curry favour with Christian evangelicals.\n\nIt's a fair question.\n\nIf the Office of Religious Freedom, to be established as a sub-branch within John Baird's Department of Foreign Affairs, becomes a vehicle uniquely for the defence of Pakistani Catholics or Egyptian Copts, it may do more harm than good. Rather than protecting the right to have faith, the government would be perceived as aligning itself with one faith, Christianity, over all the others.\n\nIf, however, Baird truly intends to champion religious freedom globally for all, including those who choose to be agnostic or atheist, then he has a great deal of important work ahead.\n\nFor rarely, judging from the latest report from the U.S. Department of State's Office of Religious Freedom, have there been more instances of governments violating people's inalienable human right to worship as they please, or not worship at all.\n\nAl-Qaida, still the reigning champion of theistic hatred, in 2010 attacked Sufi, Shia, Ahmadiyah and Christian holy sites in Pakistan. The Taliban assassinated Abdullah Haleem, who was director of hajj and religious affairs in Kandahar. Iraqi extremists attacked the Our Lady of Salvation cathedral in Baghdad, killing 50.\n\nState use of apostasy and blasphemy laws is on the rise, according to the State Department, most worryingly against Muslims who promote interfaith tolerance. In Afghanistan, Iran, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, converting to any faith but Islam is considered apostasy and punishable by death.\n\nAnti-Semitism is flourishing on every continent, as seen in desecrations of cemeteries, racist graffiti, accusations of blood libel, Holocaust denial and other historical revisionism. In 2010 there was a rise in anti-Semitic cartoons in print in Poland, Spain, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela.\n\nIn eight states in Germany now, teachers are not allowed to wear Islamic head scarves in schools. In the state of Hesse, civil servants may not wear head scarves at work. In Burma, the Theravada Buddhist-dominated authoritarian government restricts the practice of Christianity, Islam and any strain of Buddhism other than the majority's.\n\nIn Russia in 2010, the state levied criminal charges against people in possession of banned religious literature.\n\nWhat can Canada hope to do about any of this? Perhaps a fair bit.\n\nBaird's new office will have considerable resources - an annual budget of $5 million and, according to sources familiar with the project, a staff of five.\n\nIn a speech trumpeting the initiative last October, the minister's heart seemed in the right place: \"We are a country of many ethnicities and religions,\" he told an Ottawa audience, \"but we all share one humanity - one of tolerance, one of acceptance, one of peace and security.\"\n\nFull Report at:\n\nhttp://www.montrealgazette.com/news/canada-in-afghanistan/Religious+freedom+should+begin+home/5965357/story.html\n\n-------\n\nGovt. Urged to Crack Down on Extremist Elements\n\nBy Shamsul Islam\n\nFAISALABAD, January 9, 2012: Speakers at a rally on Sunday urged the government to improve the law and order situation by cracking down on groups promoting religious extremism and intolerance among various communities for their vested interests.\n\nThe rally was organised jointly by the Association of Women for Awareness and Motivation (AWAM), the Peace and Human Development (PHD) Foundation, the Development Organisation for Social Transformation (DOST) and the Participatory Organisation for Women Empowerment and Rights (POWER).\n\nThe participants held placards demanding that equal opportunities be available to all citizens without discrimination of the basis of caste, gender and economic status. They chanted slogans in support of democracy, justice and human rights and for promotion of peaceful ties between various groups within the country as well as with other countries in the region.\n\nThe speakers urged the government to crackdown on groups promoting religious extremism, intolerance and terrorism.\n\nThe rally started at the District Council Chowk and went up to the Circular Road.\n\nAddressing the rally, Shazia George demanded that the government take action against groups spreading extremism in the country. She said many banned groups were operating in the country with impunity.\n\nNaseem Anthony said education curricula be revised to purge them of hate literature. “Literature on peaceful coexistence and respect for human rights should be added to the syllabi,” he said.\n\nHe said the government should ensure that the life and property of all citizens was protected.\n\nHe said security should be provided to places of worship of all religious groups including mosques, churches and temples.\n\nNazia Sardar said the parliament needed to legislate protect the poor and marginalised communities from oppression.\n\nSuneel Malik also spoke about the need for unity and peaceful coexistence among various groups in the country.\n\nMalik said diversity in the country needed to be cherished, and not undermined. He said strict action should be taken against people spreading violence in the name of ethnicity, race and religion.\n\nhttp://tribune.com.pk/story/318576/advocating-peace-govt-urged-to-crack-down-on-extremist-elements/\n\n--------\n\nDubai-born Kashmiri brings 'change' to her village\n\nBy Binoo Joshi, IANS,\n\nJammu : 8 January 2012, Moved by the plight of her remote village in Jammu and Kashmir state, a Kashmiri woman born and brought up in Dubai relinquished what could have been a lucrative career and opened a school there to usher in \"change\".\n\nSabbah Haji was born in Dubai in 1982 where her father was a manager in a shipping company. In 1997, her family shifted to Bangalore, from where Haji did her B.Com and nursed dreams of becoming a chartered accountant.\n\nShe started writing and editing for online journals, and prepared for her professional exams alongside. But the death of her grandfather in January 2009 changed her life in more ways than one.\n\nShe went to her native village Breswana in Doda district of Jammu and Kashmir, and was immediately struck by what she saw.\n\n\"When I came here in 2009, what I saw was that nearly two generations of villagers had no education, due to the apathetic attitude of successive governments and militancy,\" Haji told IANS.\n\nBreswana is located some 7,100 feet above sea level. The village is about a one-and-a-half-hour trek from the last motorable point about 43 km from Doda, which is 160 km northeast of Jammu.\n\nGovernment schools remained shut during the peak of militancy.

Instead it was two masked gunmen.\n\n“They shot my father dead, and then came for the rest of the family,” Adurkwa’s son Hyeladi, 25, told The Sunday Telegraph the following day. “One chased my brother Moussa and killed him, and the other shot at me, but my mother took the bullet in the stomach instead.”\n\nHyeladi spoke as weeping parishioners gathered for an impromptu memorial service in the Adurkwa family compound, where the parlour carpet was still stained with blood from the gunshot wound suffered by Mrs. Aduwurka, 50, who now lies in hospital.\n\nBut while the sermon from the local pastor, Brother Balani, urged “prayers for those who God has taken away, and comfort for those who remain,” it diplomatically avoided the more earthly question of who did it.\n\nFor one thing, no one can be sure the killing was not simply the result of a private feud. And for another, Boko Haram, whose name means “Western education is sinful,” and which wants hardline Shariah law across the whole of Nigeria, has a track record of killing anyone who points the finger at them publicly.\n\nYet some of the Adurkwa family’s neighbouring Christian households have already made up their mind, fleeing the district for fear they might be next.\n\n“We are going through a very difficult time because of Boko Haram,” said Joseph Adams, 30, who lives next door to the Aduwurkas. “Two weeks ago, a nearby church was also burnt down, and nine other Christians have been killed. Now all the houses around me are emptying.”\n\nThe head of Nigeria’s Christians, Ayo Oritsejafor, said Saturday the killings of dozens of faithful suggested “ethnic and religious cleansing” reminiscent of the start of the 1960s civil war.\n\nFull Report at:\n\nhttp://www.montrealgazette.com/news/Nigeria+descends+into+holy/5963014/story.html\n\n---------\n\nLibyan children return to Gaddafi-free schools\n\nTRIPOLI (Jan 7, 2012): Libyan children are returning to schools closed for months by civil war to find one teacher gone - Muammar Gaddafi, whose portraits have been stripped from classroom walls and once-revered words erased from the curriculum.\n\nFor decades, lessons based on his \"teachings\" were mandatory and his sometimes bizarre ideas permeated everything from history lessons to Arabic textbooks.\n\nEducators are now scratching their heads over how to fill the gaps left by the expunging of the former dictator, the\n\neducation minister said as more than 1.2 million children returned to schools on Saturday.\n\n\"The subjects of political awareness and community studies have been cancelled,\" Minister of Education Suliman al-Sahli said.\n\n\"There are suggestions for substitute subjects and ... proposals are still under study,\" he said.\n\n\"The history subject has been cancelled and replaced by a new one put together by experts in this area to give us real history.\"\n\nThe start of the current school year, which should have been last September, has been postponed to January.\n\nThe last school year overran its schedule by months, because schools were closed for so much of the nine-month civil war which ended Gaddafi's 42-year rule. This school year will have to be be shortened.\n\nNEW BOOKS\n\nOne of the first things the now-ruling National Transitional Council did after taking up arms against Gaddafi was to set up a committee to wipe his teachings from the curriculum.\n\nThe three-volume \"Green Book\", which contains Gaddafi's musings on politics, economics and everyday life, used to be required reading for schools.\n\nQuotations from it used to adorn classroom walls, but all have now disappeared.\n\nThe book laid out his \"Third Universal Theory\" which seeks to chart a course between Islam and socialism.\n\nChildren were tested by their ability to learn by heart as much quotes from the \"Green Book\" as possible.\n\nA typical final exam question would be to explain the economic benefits of a rule promulgated by Gaddafi: \"The house belongs to the dweller,\" meaning that tenants renting houses had the right to take over the property if they wish to do so.\n\nAt Tripoli's Salam Primary and Middle School, Seif al-Din Mustafa, a sixth grader, said he was happy textbooks related to Gaddafi were gone.\n\n\"The teacher used to hit us if we ... couldn't understand,\" he said.\n\nLamya Abdul Salam, 11, said the curriculum had been difficult to grasp.\n\n\"Now we wish they would improve the curriculum and make it more useful,\" he said.\n\nAbdul Majid Ghonia, director of curriculum at the Ministry of Education, said the entire stock of textbooks in ministry warehouses related to Gaddafi's regime would be destroyed and replaced with 453 new textbooks.\n\nThe content of those new books, however, is as yet undecided. The challenge now is to agree on alternatives to\n\nGaddafi's versions of history, society and morality.\n\n\"We need to completely rethink the subjects taught in our schools, especially the cultural and political aspects which were abused by Gaddafi's regime to serve its propaganda purposes,\" said Suleiman Khoja, a senior ministry official.\n\nKhoja said the government would organise a national conference to discuss ideas for alternative textbooks.\n\n\"We will not start that process (of replacing textbooks) without the participation of people who can come up with a new vision,\" he said. – Reuters\n\nhttp://www.thesundaily.my/news/260182\n\n----------\n\nIran sentences American man to death in CIA case\n\nAP\n\nTEHRAN: Jan 9, 2012, An Iranian court has convicted an American man of working for the CIA and sentenced him to death, state radio reported Monday.\n\nIran charges that as a former U.S. Marine, Amir Mirzaei Hekmati received special training and served at U.S. military bases in Iraq and Afghanistan before heading to Iran for his alleged intelligence mission.\n\nThe radio report did not say when the verdict was issued.

Therefore, the accused is acquitted and discharged,\" he said.\n\nThe verdict in the more than two-year trial defied the expectations of many political observers and even Anwar himself, who said the government of Prime Minister Najib Razak was intent on eliminating him as a political threat.\n\nIt was the second sodomy verdict in a dozen years for Anwar, a former deputy premier in the 1990s who was next in line to head the country's long-ruling government until a spectacular downfall.\n\nThe charismatic Anwar had been groomed to succeed former prime minister Mahathir Mohamad until a bitter row between them saw Anwar ousted in 1998, beaten and jailed on sodomy and graft charges widely seen as politically motivated.\n\nOnce the sodomy charge was overturned in 2004 and he was released, the affair threw Anwar into the opposition, which he led to unprecedented gains against his former ruling party in 2008 general elections.\n\nBut the new sodomy charges emerged shortly after those polls - Anwar was accused of sodomising a former male aide - sparking accusations they were concocted by the ruling United Malays National Organisation to stall the opposition revival.\n\nSodomy is illegal in Muslim-majority Malaysia and punishable by 20 years in jail.\n\nhttp://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/Malaysias-Anwar-Ibrahim-acquitted-in-sodomy-trial/articleshow/11422134.cms\n\n----------\n\nAnti-Islam Sites under German Surveillance\n\nOnIslam & Newspapers\n\nCAIRO, 09 January 2012 - Worried that their anti-Muslim rhetoric undermines their society, German authorities are planning to place right-wing website under closer surveillance, throwing a spotlight on their role in fermenting hatred of Muslims in Europe\n\n\"Blogs and websites such as Politically Incorrect or Nürnberg 2.0 clearly promote a racism that extends deep into society,\" Ulla Jelpke, a member of parliament for the opposition Left Party, told The National newspaper on Monday, January 9.\n\n\"They call into question the dignity and the rights of a whole group of people solely because of their origin or their faith.\n\n“They thereby clearly run counter to core values of the constitution.\"\n\nRight-wing groups came under the spotlight after attacks by Norwegian right-winger Anders Behring Breivik, who killed 77 people in July.\n\nIn an online manifesto, the Norwegian attacker has described his attacks as a crusade to save Europe from Muslim invasion.\n\nThought many right-wing websites condemned the attacks, many of the arguments in his 1500-page manifesto matched their own rhetoric.\n\nCalls have grown for bringing websites in Germany under surveillance after revelations in November that a neo-Nazi terrorist cell murdered at least 10 people, eight of them Muslim immigrants of Turkish origin, in a killing spree spanning more than a decade.\n\nThe case has embarrassed German authorities and exposed them to criticism that they have been blind to the threat posed by racists.\n\nThe head of the Hamburg branch of the intelligence agency, Manfred Murck, said there were clear signs that the operators of many anti-Muslim sites \"had a disturbed relationship with the democratic rule of law\" and often espoused \"infringements of human rights protected under our constitution\".\n\nPolitically Incorrect website was founded in 2004 by Stefan Herre, 46, a physical education teacher based in Cologne.\n\nWith more than 60,000 readers per day, the website is one of Europe's largest anti-Islamic sites.\n\nFull Report at:\n\nhttp://www.onislam.net/english/news/europe/455314-german-anti-islam-sites-under-surveillance.html\n\n-------\n\nNorway’s ‘Beloved’ Terrorist Heads Back to Iraq\n\nBruce Bawer Bio Jan 9th, 2012\n\nHow time flies! It seems only yesterday that we folks in Norway first heard the name Mullah Krekar. The sometime leader of Ansar al-Islam – which narrow-minded individuals insist on calling a terrorist organization, but which I prefer to think of as a heavily armed, Koran-toting Iraqi version of Rotary or the Knights of Columbus – the charismatic Krekar has long since become every (well, not quite every) Norwegian’s lovable grandpa. Now, after many years in Norway, he has announced that he will soon be leaving us and returning to Iraq, where he will continue to pursue the task to which he has consecrated his life: that of serving his God.\n\nAnd oh, how many ways there are to serve God! Ansar al-Islam, according to the Canadian Institute of Strategic Studies, has “burned down girls’ schools and beaten and killed women for not wearing the burqa.” Human Rights Watch notes that under its previous name, Jund al-Islam, Krekar’s industrious associates took over villages in which they required, among other things, “the obligatory closure of offices and businesses during prayer time and enforced attendance by workers and proprietors at the mosque during those times; the veiling of women by wearing the traditional ‘abaya; obligatory beards for men; segregation of the sexes; barring women from education and employment; the removal of any photographs of women on packaged goods brought into the region; the confiscation of musical instruments and the banning of music both in public and private; and the banning of satellite receivers and televisions.” The Lord’s work never ends!\n\nFull Report at:\n\nhttp://frontpagemag.com/2012/01/09/norways-beloved-terrorist-heads-to-back-iraq/\n\n--------\n\nAustralia’s International Islamic College suing Saudi Arabia\n\nDUBAI: 9 January 2012, Australia’s International Islamic College is suing Saudi Arabia for $2 million in unpaid school fees, the Australian Gold Coast college said.\n\nThe unpaid fees had forced the school to take out bank loans in order to keep it functioning as the unpaid fees left the college with major economic shortfalls, school officials were reported saying.\n\nAccording to goldcoast.com.au, the Islamic College filed papers last week demanding the Saudi government pay the money promised in scholarships to study at Australian universities.\n\nTo obtain a study visa to Australia, families and scholarship providers are required to guarantee there are funds available to pay school fees of dependent children.\n\nKeysar Trad, chief executive of the Brisbane-based school, which opened a campus at Carrara in 2010, said the school had tried for three years to secure the money it was owed.\n\n“We hope to be successful in the courts because we are able to prove this debt,” Trad was quoted as saying.\n\n“It’s really a move borne out of necessity; we don’t have the money to forget about it.

He said, however, that this government would not be formed until mid-year when the SCAF is slated to hand power to a newly-elected president.\n\nHe urged all parties to back the current government under SCAF-appointed Kamal Ganzouri until the transition is completed. Mr Erian’s statements make it clear that Freedom and Justice has no intention of challenging the military over the timing of the transfer and the present interim cabinet’s continuation in office.\n\nIt remains to be seen, however, if the party will attempt to force the SCAF to alter its plan to appoint 80 of the 100 members of the commission due to draft a new constitution. Although Freedom and Justice does not wish to adopt a collision course with the military, the party is determined, especially if it is successful in forming a majority coalition, to have a major say in the constitution.\n\nWhile the Muslim Brotherhood and the Salafis have tried to reassure secular liberals and Coptic Christians by pledging to seek consensus on legislation, neither are convinced of the fundamentalists’ bona fides. Confidence in them has been, to a certain extent, undermined by the formation of Saudi-inspired puritanical elements of committees for the enforcement of Muslim canon law, giving rise to speculation that they could impose their agenda on more moderate religious parties.\n\nhttp://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/world/2012/0109/1224310004677.html\n\n--------\n\nIraq police say sorry for Saddam era\n\nJanuary 8, 2012\n\nIraq's police, completely reformed after the 2003 U.S.-led invasion, on Sunday apologized for acts committed during the rule of the dictator Saddam Hussein, on the eve of the force's 90th anniversary.\n\n\"Security forces in the interior ministry apologize for the practices that took place during the former regime,\" the ministry said in a statement.\n\n\"They were forced to carry out practices that were not their duties.\"\n\nIt went on to say that the fledgling force, which has been rebuilt from the ground up in the past eight-plus years, were \"the sons of the nation, carrying out their duties in order to implement the law and justice.\"\n\nThe statement came on the eve of the 90th anniversary of the police's 1922 founding, two years after Britain created the country under a League of Nations mandate, but a decade before it became fully independent.\n\nDespite the apology for past acts, Iraq's security forces -- the police and army -- still regularly face criticism from rights groups for heavy-handedness, random arrests and abuses.\n\nInterior ministry security forces, made up of city, oil and federal police as well as border enforcement officers and the facilities protection service, number around 650,000, according to government figures issued in October.\n\nAnd even with their high staffing levels, multiple reports have assessed that they do not inspire public confidence and are unable to secure Iraq's cities and towns without help from the army.\n\n\"There is ... still a level of skepticism and mistrust towards the police in terms of law enforcement and human security,\" a UN report said last year.\n\nAnd a separate report published in October 2011 from a U.S. watchdog warned that senior officials in the interior and defense ministry had said \"Iraqi police forces are currently unable to secure all of Iraq's urban areas without assistance from the Iraqi army.\"\n\nMonday's 90th Police Day commemorations follow the marking of the 91st anniversary of the foundation of the Iraqi armed forces on Friday, during which mortars targeted the Green Zone while the army staged a parade inside.\n\nThe latest events highlighting the Iraqi security forces come amid a spate of deadly violence against Shia pilgrims, including a wave of bombings on Thursday which killed 70 people.\n\nThe violence has dealt a blow to U.S. and Iraqi claims that domestic forces are able to maintain internal security, if not defend the country's borders.\n\nU.S. forces dismantled the Iraqi security forces after toppling Saddam Hussein in 2003 in a move later panned for having put hundreds of thousands of men with military training out of work and creating a potent recruitment pool for insurgents.\n\nhttp://www.tehrantimes.com/middle-east/94346-iraq-police-say-sorry-for-saddam-era\n\n--------\n\nBenghazi Revolutionary Brigades Declare Support to New Head of Armed Forces\n\nBenghazi, 08 01 2012—Libyan revolutionary forces in the eastern part have announced on Sunday in communiqué that they all pledge allegiance to the new Chief of Staff of the Libyan armed forces.\n\nThe statement said: “believing in the great importance and need for rebuilding a capable national army that secures the country and people, we, the Gathering Revolutionary Brigades, welcome the long awaited decision of appointing a chief of staff.”\n\nIt also said “we congratulate Colonel Youssef al-Mangoush for his appointment to this mission.”\n\nGeneral Youssef Mangoush was appointed chief of staff on Tuesday by the National Transitional Council (NTC) after deliberation for sometime.\n\n“We lend our hand to fully support him to build a national army that is disciplined according to legitimacy, neutral, protects the country and preserve its Islamic and Arab identity,” the statement added.\n\nThe appointment of Mangoush has received wide praise by all revolutionary forces who played major role in ousting the former dictator Gaddafi.\n\nMangoush became well know to the Libyan people when he was arrested by Gaddafi forces in the city of al-Brega in April 2011 as he was leading the rebel forces there.\n\nSoon after his arrest he was shown on Gaddafi’s TV while he was interrogated. He showed great courage and refused to play to the dictator’s propaganda machine at the time by not condemning the uprising.\n\nHe was defiant and it was all clear to viewers that he was in honest in defending the revolution despite the possible death he was facing from Gaddafi regime.\n\nHe held the rank of colonel and has been now raised in the rank to general.\n\nBorn in Benghazi in 1950, he enrolled in military school in 1970 and specialized in anti-armor weaponry. He worked in different locations in Libya and fought in Libya's war in Chad, which ended in the 1980s. Mangoush was also a lecturer and instructor in Libya's military school.\n\nhttp://www.tripolipost.com/articledetail.asp?c=1&i=7645\n\n----------\n\nArab League tells Syria again to halt violence\n\n9 January 2012\n\nBEIRUT — The Arab League demanded that the Syrian government immediately stop all violence and allow more monitors in, as activists reported at least 10 more civilians, including two teenagers, were killed by regime forces.\n\nFierce clashes in the south between government troops and military defectors left 11 soldiers dead on Sunday, activists said. The Arab League also called on other armed parties to halt all bloodshed, an apparent reference to the defectors.\n\nQatari Foreign Minister Sheik Hamad Bin Jassem Bin Jabr Al Thani said the ministers did not agree to call for U.N. experts to join the observers’ mission in Syria, but said U.N. experts will train the monitors in Cairo before they leave. Even had they called for the U.N. experts to go in, Syria’s regime may well have blocked them.\n\nThe success of the mission, said Al Thani, who heads the committee, “depends on the government of Syria, and that means stopping the killings, withdrawing troops from the cities, and allowing journalists to work and enter Syria.”\n\nThe ministerial committee called on “the Syrian government and various armed groups to immediately halt all forms of violence and to return to protesting peacefully for the success of the Arab League observers’ mission in Syria.”\n\nAt the meeting, the head of the observers issued his first report on the mission, sharing photos, maps and initial findings.\n\nThe five foreign ministers from the 22-member Arab League, who met in Cairo, said the 165 Arab League monitors now on the ground need greater independence from President Bashar Assad’s regime.\n\nFull Report at:\n\nhttp://www.khaleejtimes.com/DisplayArticle09.asp?xfile=data/middleeast/2012/January/middleeast_January227.xml&section=middleeast\n\n--------\n\nYemen Cabinet approves immunity law\n\nSANAA, Yemen, January 2012— Yemen’s Cabinet approved a law granting President Ali Abdullah Saleh, and anyone who has worked under him, immunity from prosecution for any crimes committed during his 33-year rule.\n\nSunday’s decision came as a surprise to many in Yemen, who believed that a power transfer deal he signed in November granted him and his family immunity from prosecution for the killings of protesters, but would not extend to cover his 33-year rule and anyone who worked in government.\n\nThe Cabinet approved the law despite nationwide daily protests demanding the longtime leader be put on trial for the killing of hundreds of people in raids on protest camps, the use of snipers and armed attacks on marches during the country’s 11-month popular uprising.\n\nThe wording of the law “provides President Ali Abdullah Saleh and those who worked with him, including in civilian, military and security institutions during the period of his presidency, legal and judicial immunity.”\n\nActivists say that the country’s Revolutionary Guards, run by Saleh’s son, are responsible for most of the attacks on protesters.\n\nYemen’s new national unity government, comprised of an equal number of opposition and loyalist ministers, approved the law in accordance with the transfer agreement that Saleh signed in neighboring Saudi Arabia late last year.\n\nThe agreement, brokered by Yemen’s powerful Arab neighbors and backed by the United States, the EU and the U.N., grants Saleh immunity in exchange for him hand handing over powers to his deputy.\n\nAccording to the agreement, Yemen’s parliament must approve the law as a formality after the Cabinet vote.\n\nSaleh is scheduled to hand over the presidency to his vice president, Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi on Feb. 21.\n\nFull Report at:\n\nhttp://www.khaleejtimes.com/DisplayArticle11.asp?xfile=data/middleeast/2012/January/middleeast_January226.xml&section=middleeast\n\n---------\n\nJapan assured of steady supply in face of Iran crisis\n\nBy GHAZANFAR ALI KHAN, ARAB NEWS\n\nRIYADH: Jan 9, 2012, Saudi Arabia and Japan pledged to boost cooperation in the energy sector with a proposal to provide more oil to Tokyo in case of a shortage or supply disruptions following fresh sanctions imposed on Iran by the West.\n\n“Defense Minister Prince Salman and Minister of Petroleum and Mineral Resources Ali Al-Naimi held talks with Japanese Foreign Minister Koichiro Gemba and discussed bilateral and regional issues as well as ways and means to cooperate in energy sector,” Abdulaziz A. Turkistani, Saudi ambassador to Japan, said on Sunday.\n\nHe said the talks between Prince Salman and Gemba “mainly focused on how to strengthen Saudi-Japanese relations further.”\n\nPrince Salman, who last visited Japan in 1998, was also presented a plaque of appreciation by Gemba, said the envoy, adding that the talks were held in a “candid” atmosphere.\n\n“The talks with Al-Naimi were, of course, more on joint proposals, plans and projects in energy sector,” said Turkistani.\n\nHe said the two sides also discussed the international oil prices, joint investments, exchange of expertise, and prospects of cooperation between oil producing and oil consuming countries.\n\nThe talks with Al-Naimi, which was attended by Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, assistant minister of petroleum and mineral resources, and other senior Saudi officials also focused on stability of oil prices in international markets and environmental issues.\n\nSpeaking to reporters in Riyadh, Masaru Sato, deputy spokesman for Japan’s Foreign Ministry, said the talks included “Iran's nuclear ambitions and Saudi oil supplies.”\n\nAccording to the spokesman, Saudi Arabia supplies 30 percent of Japan's oil imports, with another 20 percent coming from the United Arab Emirates, 10 percent from Qatar and nine percent from Iran. Fresh sanctions on Iran over its nuclear program could make it difficult for refineries in Japan, Iran's No. 3 crude buyer, to pay Tehran for its oil.\n\nPressure from Washington and the European Union to boycott Iranian oil is mounting at a time when Japan must make greater use of thermal power plants after a massive earthquake and tsunami sparked a nuclear power crisis last March. The vast majority of Japan's 54 nuclear reactors are now shut down, amid public distrust of the technology and increased safety calls.\n\nSato said Al-Naimi and Gemba agreed that the “oil price stability is important amid concerns over a potential surge in crude prices as the United States and EU countries move to toughen sanctions against oil-producing Iran over its nuclear program.”\n\nJapan also aims to expand “its infrastructure-related exports” to the nations in the Middle East, mainly in the fields of solar and other renewable energy technologies.\n\nIf nuclear reactors in Japan are not reactivated, demand for fuel for thermal power generation in fiscal year 2012 will reach 40.96 million kiloliters, three times the 2010 level.\n\nhttp://arabnews.com/saudiarabia/article560501.ece\n\n-------\n\nInt’l Festival of Muslim Women’s Print Media Kicks off in Tehran\n\n(Ahlul Bayt News Agency)\n\nTehran, January 08,2012 - The International Festival of Muslim Women’s Print Media began Sunday, January 08, in Tehran.\n\nThe opening ceremony featured speeches by Culture Minister Seyyed Mohammad Hosseini and director general of the Islamic Culture and Relation Organization’s women and family affairs Sedigheh Hejazi.\n\nThe Culture Minister said the Holy Quran has lauded great women and introduced them as role models not only for other women, but for men as well.\n\nDr Hosseini said the Holy Book emphasizes that man and woman have no difference in terms of striving for perfection and reaching God.\n\nHe referred to Taqwa (God-fearing) as the basis of the family and said the fact that the foundation of family has been shattered in the West is a result of neglecting Taqwa.\n\nHe concluded his speech quoting supreme Leader of the Islamic Revolution Imam Khamenei as saying that western countries talk a lot about women but make no mention of family because the issue of family is their weakness.\n\nChief editors and managing directors of print media from countries like Argentina, Egypt, Russia, Indonesia, Sudan, Kyrgyzstan, Kosovo, Tatarstan, Iraq, Bosnia, Pakistan, Lebanon, Ghana, Thailand, Syria, Tunisia, and France have attended the festival.\n\nThere will be sideline forums discussing issues like new Islamic law and the role of time;
