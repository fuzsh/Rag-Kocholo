        "text": "An Iranian revolutionary court secretly tried U.S. Marine Corps veteran Amir Hekmati and found him guilty of “practical collaboration with the American government,” his attorney told the New York Times.\n\nThe court sentenced Hekmati to 10 years in prison. This is the second time Hekmati has been tried in Iran since he was detained there in August 2011 while visiting family. Hekmati was previously sentenced to death, but the verdict was later overturned.\n\nUpon learning of his secret trial and sentence, the Hekmati family released a statement on Facebook which reads, in part:\n\nAs Home Post previously reported, Hekmati was born in Arizona, grew up in Michigan and has duel U.S.-Iranian citizenship.\n\nHekmati joined the Marine Corps in 2001 and received basic training at Camp Pendleton."
