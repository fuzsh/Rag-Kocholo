        "text": "The US is calling on Iran to immediately release an American who has been reportedly sentenced to death for spying.\n\nIran says the 28-year-old American was spying for the CIA when captured in December. Authorities say he received special training at US bases in Iraq and Afghanistan before entering Iran intending to spy for the US.\n\nState media is reporting Amir Mirzaei Hekmati, who is a former Marine with dual citizenship, has been sentenced to death.\n\n\"Amir Mirza Hekmati was sentenced to death... for cooperating with the hostile country America and spying for the CIA,\" the Iranian Student's News Agency (ISNA) quoted judiciary spokesman Gholamhossein Mohseni-Ejei as saying.\n\n\"The court found him corrupt on the earth and mohareb [one who wages war on God]. Hekmati can appeal to the Supreme Court.\"\n\nUS State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland says the charges are a fabrication.\n\n\"We would condemn this verdict in the strongest terms and we are working with all our partners to convey that condemnation to the Iranian government,\" she said.\n\n\"We've maintained from the beginning that the charges against him were a fabrication and we call on the Iranian government to release him immediately.\"\n\nShe says the US has not been able to contact him.\n\nLoading...\n\nHekmati, 28, was born in the south-western US state of Arizona to an Iranian immigrant family and graduated from a high school in Michigan. His father Ali is a professor at a community college in Flint, Michigan.\n\nHekmati's family said earlier this month in a statement that the former US military translator was visiting his grandmothers in Iran when he was arrested.\n\nIran's judiciary said Hekmati admitted to having links with the CIA but denied any intention of harming Iran.\n\nIran's highest court must confirm all death sentences. It is not known when it will rule in Hekmati's case.\n\nThe American has 20 days to appeal the court's decision.\n\nThe sentence is likely to further strain tensions between Iran and the West, who have clashed over Iran's nuclear program.\n\nThe US is leading efforts to tighten sanctions on Iran over its nuke program and Washington and Israel say they do not rule out carrying out pre-emptive military strikes on Iran's nuclear sites if diplomacy fails to resolve the row."
