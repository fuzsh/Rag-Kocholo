A more active monetary policy may now be needed as <strong>Qatar</strong> plans to spend $140 billion on infrastructure, partly to prepare for hosting the 2022 World Cup.

He said the company has been coordinating with authorities and ministries for the provision of work visas and securing the accommodation for the workers. Speaking at a seminar at <strong>Qatar</strong> University on Tuesday, Leckel said that the ambitious initiative is right on schedule. He added that Rail has started awarding construction contracts. Phase 1 of the Doha Metro, with 48 percent of the structure to be built underground, begins this year and will be completed by 2019. Phase 2 of the project is expected to be completed by 2026. While the Light Rail Transit in Lusail has begun and will be completed by 2017, the West Bay Phase of the project will be implemented at a later stage.

Ashghal Manager (Local Roads & Drainage Programme) Saoud al Tamimi on Tuesday said that the Public Works Authority will execute the project worth QR80 billion, which will be carried out across the country in the next few years. In 2013 and 2014 alone, 45 road and infrastructure projects will be implemented in the country. During Ashghal’s Local Roads and Drainage Programme the road and drainage network across five regions of the country, including <strong>Qatar</strong> North, <strong>Qatar</strong> South, Doha North, Doha South and Doha West, will be targeted. Meanwhile, Ashghal has also announced the launch of a QR1 billion project to develop Rawdat Al Hamam/Bani Hajer area, of Al Rayyan Municipality, as a quality residential area, boasting of all necessary facilities. To be carried out in two phases, the project is expected to be completed by the end of 2014 and will include construction of roads, public parks, schools and other public facilities in Rawdat Al Hamam. Tamimi said, “The project will provide complete infrastructure including a new road network, a sewerage network, traffic signals and street landscaping that will improve the quality of life in Rawdat Al Hamam/Bani Hajer and the neighbouring areas and provide roads that will link the entire area and ultimately connect it with the adjacent Doha road network.” DETAILED REPORT ON PAGE 5"
