        "text": "Iran has issued a death sentence on a U.S born game designer called Amir Mirza-Hekmati. He was apparently accused of spying on the country and designing propaganda games. He used to work for Kuma Reality Games\n\nThe twist here is that the game designer confessed to spying and designing such games to spread pro-US propaganda via a taped broadcast. He said that the CIA had paid him to do that in a written statement.\n\nThe Tehran Times published all the details of the said confession.\n\n“[Kuma] was receiving money from the CIA to (produce) and design and distribute for free special movies and games with the aim of manipulating public opinion in the Middle East,” Hekmati said.\n\n“The goal of the company in question was to convince the people of Iran and the people of the entire world that whatever the U.S. does in other countries is a good measure.”\n\nThis news comes at a time when Iran has recently started enriching Uranium in an underground bunker, so the tensions between the country and U.S are at an all time high. The CIA didn’t comment on this situation but a White House official did.\n\n“We strongly condemn such a verdict and will work with our partners to convey our condemnation to the Iranian government.”\n\n“Allegations that Mr. Hekmati either worked for, or was sent to Iran by the CIA are false. The Iranian regime has a history of falsely accusing people of being spies, eliciting forced confessions, and of holding innocent Americans for political reasons.\n\n“We call upon the Iranian government to grant the Swiss protecting power immediate access to Mr. Hekmati, grant Mr. Hekmati access to legal counsel, and release him without delay.”\n\nKuma also released a game called ‘Assault on Iran‘, where players were sent into Iranian Nuclear facilities to find evidence of Uranium enrichment. Looks like the game is totally pointless now, eh?\n\nTell us what you think in the comments section below."
