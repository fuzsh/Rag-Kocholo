        "text": "In a pre-recorded interview, Iranian Amir Mirza Hekmati was broadcast saying he had received training from US intelligence services and spent time at military bases in Iraq and Afghanistan. The IRIB channel said he had been sent to Iran to provide misinformation to Iranian intelligence.\n\n\"They [US agents] told me, 'If you are successful at this mission we can train you further, we can give you other missions ... This mission requires that you travel to Iran,'\" he said in the video, which was shown on the channel's main news bulletin.\n\n\"I was in a spying centre in Bagram [a major US base in Afghanistan] ... I went to Dubai and then ... I flew to Tehran,\" Hekmati said, without mentioning the date. \"They told me, 'You will become a source of military and intelligence information for the Iranians for three weeks and we will give you money for this and then you will return.'\"\n\nPictures of the Iranian at alleged US military bases were also shown during the clip.\n\nHekrati, who claims he was born in Arizona, said he was recruited by the US army in 2001.\n\nHe also claimed to have worked for the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, a US military cyber intelligence agency, between 2005 and 2007, and claimed to have also received orders from Britain's BAE systems.\n\nThe Iranian said he had attended a specialist university to learn Middle Eastern languages.\n\n\"When they realised that I know a little Persian and a little Arabic, they told me we want to send you to a university to learn Arabic language,\" he claimed.\n\nTensions between the US and Iran have increased in the last few months following the capture of an American spy drone. Iranian forces have refused to return the drone in defiance of President Barack Obama's requests.\n\nWhite House representatives have endorsed harsher sanctions against Iran after reports that the nation is increasing its nuclear capabilities.\n\nIran's state television has in the past broadcast confessions from those accused of threatening state security.\n\nIn May, Tehran announced the arrest of a network of 30 CIA-backed spies involved in sabotage and espionage.\n\nOn Tuesday 15 people were indicted for spying for Washington and Israel. Under Iran's Islamic law, espionage can be punishable by death."
