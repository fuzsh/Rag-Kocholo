Amir Hekmati, a Marine Corps veteran who served at Camp Pendleton, has been held against his will in Iran for more than three years. Now his Michigan-based family says Iranian officials want to free him as part of a prisoner swap - an idea they oppose.

The New York Times reports Hekmati wrote a letter to Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, made public by his family, that details what he says are Iranian plans to release him back to his family if the U.S. agrees to free Iranians held in America:

The 31-year-old Hekmati was born in Arizona, raised in Michigan, and is of Iranian descent. He holds duel United States-Iran citizenship, as Home Post previously reported.

Hekmati joined the Marine Corps in 2001 and received basic training at Camp Pendleton.

In August 2011, Hekmati was visiting his grandmothers in Iran when he was detained and accused of spying. An Iranian revolutionary court secretly tried and convicted him of â€œpractical collaboration with the American government."

The court sentenced Hekmati to 10 years in prison. It was the second time Hekmati was tried in Iran - after his first trial, he was sentenced to death. That verdict was later overturned.
