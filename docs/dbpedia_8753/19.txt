Espionage arrest and trial[]

Hekmati was arrested in August 2011 while visiting his grandmother and other relatives in Iran.[22] Hekmati allegedly entered Iran from Bagram Airfield via Dubai.[24] On 18 December 2011, a confession by Hekmati appeared on Iranian state television and stated that he had infiltrated Iran, in order to establish a CIA presence in the country.[25] Hekmati's family claim that the alleged confession was coerced,[22] and he was not a spy.[2] The family is represented by a U.S. Attorney former Ambassador at Large Pierre-Richard Prosper.[26][27]

Iran alleges that Hekmati's mission was to implicate the country of state-sponsored terrorist activities.[6] On 24 December 2011, Switzerland, which manages the diplomatic relations between Iran and the United States applied for, but was denied, consular access to Hekmati.[28] In his confession, Hekmati stated that his mission pertained to maintaining a presence, rather than undermining the integrity of the country.[29] According to excerpts from his alleged confession published in the Tehran Times, Hekmati revealed that he worked for Kuma Reality Games, which was allegedly paid by the CIA to design movies and video games with the objective of swaying consumers to receive a distasteful impression of the Middle East.[30]
