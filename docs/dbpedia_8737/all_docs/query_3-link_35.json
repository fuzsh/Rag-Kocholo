        "text": "This is an essay from the Spanish Missions of the Southwest Travel Itinerary\n\nBy the end of the 15th century, the Middle Ages came to a close as the modern world emerged. The legacy of the Middle Ages, the \"Age of Faith,\" left its mark on the future of religion in Europe and after 1492, on the Americas. That year, Spain militarily defeated the Moors and initiated a period of expulsion for those who would not convert to Christianity. Following Columbus' first voyage, Spain had a new goal in that regard. When the cartographer Juan de la Cosa drew the first map of the Americas in 1500, he depicted a symbol of the Medieval past on the extreme left of his map where he had placed the North American coastline -- St. Christopher bearing the Christ child across the sea. In his Book of Prophecies (1501), a collection of biblical texts presented to Spain's sovereigns, Christopher Columbus, who signed his name Cristo Ferens, or Christ Bearer, asserted that the first steps toward bearing Christianity across the Atlantic had been taken.\n\nSymbolically, just as Saint Christopher had carried the Christ child across a raging river, Spain was poised to send missionaries to Christianize the New World. In the papal bull of 1508, Universalis Ecclesiae (Of the Universal Church), Pope Julius II declared that the king of Spain would be the head of the Church in Spain and its empire. Such an empowerment clearly meant that along with Spanish law, governance, language, and culture, the Roman Catholic religion, too, would cross from Europe to the Americas and that the king of Spain would engage in the spread of Christianity to the native peoples of the New World. His charge would be to establish missions throughout the Western Hemisphere and, later, the Philippines. Thus began the history of the missions that across time would become a part of our national story and influence our shared common history with Spain, Mexico and Latin America.\n\nThroughout the colonial period, the missions Spain established would serve several objectives. The first would be to convert natives to Christianity. The second would be to pacify the areas for colonial purposes. A third objective was to acculturate the natives to Spanish cultural norms so that they could move from mission status to parish status as full members of the congregation. Mission status made participating natives wards of the State instead of citizens of the empire. Aside from spiritual conquest through religious conversion, Spain hoped to pacify areas that held extractable natural resources such as iron, tin, copper, salt, silver, gold, hardwoods, tar and other such resources, which could then be exploited by investors. The missionaries hoped to create a utopian society in the wilderness.\n\nTo assure that the missionaries would be able to sustain themselves, the king of Spain established the Patronato Real de las Indias (Royal Patronage of the Indies) which supported the Spanish Crown's absolute control over ecclesiastical matters within the empire. The Spanish king and his council approved missionaries to go to the Americas, directed the geographic location of missions and allocated funds for each projected enterprise. Under the Patronato Real, which also governed appointments of Church officials to high office, some viceroys in Mexico and Peru were also archbishops, further cementing the Church-State alliance in a common cause. The missions served as agencies of the Church and State to spread the faith to natives and also to pacify them for the State's aims. By intermingling religion, politics and economics, the Patronato Real formed a large archival record of exploration, settlement, missionary activity, ethnographic data, and extraction of raw resources."
