        "text": "About Portugal...\n\nSituated along the southwest corner of Europe lies Portugal, one fifth of the Iberian Peninsula it shares with Spain. Portugal has its own language, the 6th most spoken in the world (think Brazil-Portugal’s former colony), its own culture and cuisine. Portugal is divided into regions, each offers unique features, history, scenery and cuisine. The regions are from south to north: Algarve, Alentejo, Lisbon and Lisbon Coast, Estremadura and Ribatejo, the Beiras, Douro and Tras-os-Montes and the Minho. Portugal also includes 2 island groups: the Azores (800 miles southwest of Lisbon) and Madeira (600 miles south of Lisbon).\n\nUntil the 12th century, when Portugal began to emerge as an entity separate from Spain, Portuguese Jewry's historical experiences were essentially the same as those of Spanish Jewry, dating back to Roman times. The kings who most contributed to the formation of Portugal employed prominent Jewish courtiers. This relationship contributed to the considerable autonomy granted to the Jewish community during the early years of independence. The Church, however, developed a deep hostility toward Judaism. The Black Death in 1350 presented the Church with an opportunity to vent its anti-Semitic anger. By blaming Jews for the spread of the malady, anti-Jewish riots were sparked in many cities and towns. From this point onwards, Portuguese Jews suffered from diminishing protection and tolerance.\n\nAlthough Jews exiled from Spain were allowed to enter Portugal in 1492, the spreading influence of the Spanish monarchy resulted in the issuance of a Portuguese edict of expulsion four years later. The Portuguese dynasty's fear that the Jews' departure would economically cripple the kingdom resulted in the forced conversion of tens of thousands of Jews to Christianity.\n\nSpecial Interest…\n\nPortugal is a storied country of stone castles, snowcapped mountains, vast monuments, and sophisticated cities, all of which have made it a favored travel destination. But Spain boasts years of fluid history; a confluence of a diverse historical influences with origins based on pre-Roman Celtic and Iberian culture including Romans, Phoenicians, Carthaginians, and Greeks. This was home to Christians, Moors and Jews, a melting pot of cultures, offering a range of special Interests and contrasting encounters. Our focus on this segment of our platform is on the latter attribute. Come and peruse these eye-opening web pages, lets us expand your minds and range of understanding.\n\nFrom Barcelona’s Jewish Quarter to Girona, an important Jewish center dating back to 890. Then there’s Besalu, a stunning town which first welcomed its Jewish community in the 9th century, home to a synagogue built in 1264. Although there are no remains of the synagogue, the place is still called ‘Pla dels Jueus’ or Place of the Jews. You’ll visit the 12th century mikvah (ritual Jewish bath), one of the only three from the same period that have been kept in Europe. Visit Segovia well-known for its Roman aqueduct and Alcazar where you’ll find many traces of the Jewish community life. Toledo, former capital of Spain previously a leading center of Jewry in Spain. No visit is complete without Cordoba and the Synagogue built in 1314, a beautiful Mudejar building nearly perfectly preserved and the only synagogue in Spain from that period that has not been turned into a Christian place of worship. Explore the Jewish Quarter including Almodovar Gate or ‘Gate of the Jews’ as it is known locally and the monument to the great Jewish doctor and philosopher, Maimonides and the lists go on sand on…."
