        "text": "Like most European countries, particularly Southern European countries, Catholicism has been a big part of Portuguese life. Portugal is a strong catholic country, home to the miracle of Fátima, and the birthplace of two popes (Damasus I and John XXI).\n\nDespite the Catholic influence, Portugal doesn’t actually have an official religion. In fact, church and state separated a long time ago and mass attendance has been on the decline for several decades while the number of self-professed atheists or agnostics is on the rise.\n\nThat said, Catholicism is still a big part of Portuguese culture – especially in the North of Portugal, which tends to be more religious than the South. According to the 2011 Census, despite only 19% regularly attending mass, 81% of Portuguese people see themselves as Catholic. That’s more than just a case of identity: the majority want to have their children baptised, expect to marry in a church, and also to receive the Last Rites.\n\nSo, although religion is declining in Portugal, it is still a big part of Portuguese culture and identity. After all, religion (especially Catholicism) and Portugal have a very long and complicated history together.\n\nPortugal used to be very religious\n\nPortugal became Christian under the Roman Empire. For a number of centuries after that, the Portuguese rulers and the Catholic Church enjoyed a good working relationship.\n\nAfonso Henriques (r. 1139-85), the first king of Portugal, worked with the church to drive the moors out of the South of Portugal. In return, Afonso gave the church large pieces of land in Portugal.\n\nSimilarly the church and Portuguese rulers had a strong working relationship during the Age of Explorations. As Portugal colonised countries like Brazil and Mozambique, the church was able to move in and convert the locals to Christianity.\n\nThen, things started to change\n\nAround the 18th Century, things began to change and anti-church sentiment grew. While he was in charge from 1750-1777, the Marquês de Pombal expelled the Jesuits, cut ties with Rome, and made the state responsible for education as opposed to the church.\n\nLater, in 1821, the inquisition which had lead to many Jews being burned at the stake, was abolished. Next religious orders were banned, and the government took back properties from the church.\n\nAlthough this obviously made relations between the church and the state slightly tense, they gradually began to recover. That was until the First Republic was established in 1910.\n\nChurch & State actually separated in…\n\nThe Portuguese First Republic (1910–1926) actually separated church and state. This was a huge thing at the time, and only a few other European countries like France (in 1905) had taken this big, bold move before.\n\nBut, Salazar undid a lot of the work\n\nUnfortunately, this forward-thinking wasn’t going to last forever. When António de Oliveira Salazar established the corporatist totalitarian regime known as the Estado Novo, he also re-established ties with the Catholic Church.\n\nSalazar himself was very religious and had studied at a seminary before studying law, however, it’s possible that reestablishing ties with the church wasn’t just for personal reasons. The Three Fs (Fado, football and Fátima) were big distractions that kept the general population away from politics.\n\nIn 1940, Portugal and the Vatican signed a Concordat which reversed many of the anti-church policies that the First Republic had introduced. These changes included the Catholic Church begin given control over how religion was taught in public schools. It mean that only Catholic clergy could become chaplains within the armed forces. The church was also given formal “juridical personality,” and this allowed it to hold and incorporate property.\n\nDespite his own personal religious beliefs, Salazar only strengthened the state-church ties to a point. The church was not allowed to get involved in Portuguese politics, and definitely not to criticise. Those that did, for example the Bishop of Porto António Ferreira Gomes, were exiled.\n\nThen, they had to declare themselves separate again\n\nIn 1976, one year after the Carnation Revolution of 1974, a new Portuguese Constitution was enacted. Once again, the church and state were formally separated. Later legislation came in which allowed divorce and abortion, and the church was powerless to stop it from happening.\n\nThe constitution of 1976 also meant that all religions had the right to practice their faith in Portugal. This had not been the case previously and, although a large number of Evangelical Christians, Mormons, and Jehovah’s Witnesses, had arrived in Portugal in the 50s and 60s, they had not been free to try to spread their faiths.\n\nThese days, Portugal is a lot less religious\n\nBut, although Portugal is a lot less religious, it’s not a completely secular yet. As mentioned previously, most Portuguese people still identify as Catholic and expect to raise their children as Catholic. They may not attend church all that often, but it’s still something that’s important to them.\n\nAccording to a Eurobarometer survey in 2010, some 70% still “believe there is a God” while only 12% said they “don’t believe there is any sort of spirit, God, or lifeforce”.\n\nIn comparison, only 18% of people in Sweden “believe there is a God”, followed by 27% in France, and 37% in the United Kingdom.\n\nEven if everyone in Portugal was to become an atheist, religion would still be a huge cultural part of Portugal. There’s a church in just about every town square in Portugal, Fátima will continue to attract pilgrims from all over the world, and the giant statue of Jesus will continue to dominate the Lisbon skyline.\n\nOther religions in Portugal\n\nCatholicism is the predominant religion in Portugal, but it’s not the only one.\n\nAround 5% of Portugal is Protestant. The British brought Protestantism to Portugal in the 19th Century, primarily bringing the Church of England brand, but also Presbyterianism, Methodism, and the Baptist Church.\n\nThe remainder, which according to the 2011 census makes up less than 1% is made up of a mixture of Jews, Muslims, Buddhists, Hindus, and those from the Bahá’í Faith."
