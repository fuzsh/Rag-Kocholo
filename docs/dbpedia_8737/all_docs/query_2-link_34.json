More than eight hundred of Portuguese captives stayed, between 1754 and 1812, in the Regency of Algiers. Portugal was often attacked by Algerian corsairs and the loss of two important war ships - the brigantine Lebre pequeno and the frigate Cisne - was needed as well as the arrival to the Algerian “bagno” about more than three hundred captives to the Regency Governors in Lisbon began to think in the urgency of a Treaty Peace and Truce with the Turkish rulers in Algiers. For this purpose was important to the Portuguese kingdom English mediation and the Treaty that release 615 captives signed in July 1810. This dissertation aims to study, considering the international situation at the end of eighteen century and first decades of nineteenth, the permanence of Portuguese captives in Algiers. The practice of “corso” and corsair strategy by France and the Order of Malta has been studied as well as the activity of the corsairs of Moroccan Empire and Regency of Algiers. At last we researched the role played by the Jewish communities of Maghrib and Gibraltar in the Portuguese financial effort for the release of their captives; the existence of Muslim captives in Portugal; the daily lives of Portuguese in the Algerian regency during the captivity; the conflicts that frequently erupted under cover of false ideological reasons and captives reintegration into Portuguese society of the early nineteenth century.\n\nALBERTO, Edite Maria ConceiÃ§Ã£o Martins, A Pious Business: the ransoming of captives in Early Modern Portugal, PhD in History: Modern History submitted to the Institute of Social Sciences of the Universidade do Minho, supervised by Maria Augusta Lima Cruz, 2011 (http://hdl.handle.net/1822/13440)\n\nKeywords: Christianism; Islamism; Captive ransoming; Holy Trinity Order; Mesa de ConsciÃªncia e Ordens (Table of Conscience and Orders); Privateering; Piracy; Morocco; Algiers\n\nAbstract: The arrest and imprisonment of individuals for future ransoming appears in Portuguese History as an inherent factor for the conflicts between Christians and Muslims. Along the reigns of successive kings, the process of captive ransoming was structured and organized by specific legislation with the aim of improving the release actions, taking into account the new terrestrial and maritime frontiers, consequence of the Portuguese expansion. The danger of privateers and pirates attacks, imminent at sea for both the large oceanic vessels as well as for smaller fishing vessels was also felt by the coastal populations, which were attacked for several times, as demonstrated by the local folklore and religious traditions. The Holy Trinity Order instituted by SÃ£o JoÃ£o da Mata with the specific aim of ransoming Christians in Muslim territories appeared in Portugal already in the beginning of the XIIIth century. Excepting for a period of eighty years during which ransoms were treated by the Tribunal da RedenÃ§Ã£o de Cativos (Captives Redemption Court), a court created by king D. Afonso V for this very specific purpose, it will be the trinity friars who will be in charge of the organization and negotiation of the ransoms in North African territories. Along common borders and seas, Christians and Muslims religiously legitimated the apprehension of infidels as an exchange currency as well as an income source. Regarding this last case, Argel and SalÃ© are examples of cities that prospered due to privateering and the selling of Christian captives. The Trinity friars were always present for the religious support during captivity times and responsible for the ransom negotiation as a religious order instituted for this effect and mandated by the Monarchs for ransom execution. In this dissertation we aim to study the structure and proceedings inherent to the executions of fourteen general ransoms which took place between the reigns of D. JoÃ£o IV and the end of the XVIIIth century. Our study is based, fundamentally, in the documentation from the Provedoria dos Cativos da Mesa da ConsciÃªncia e Ordens (Captives Purveyor’s Office of the Table of Conscience and Orders) and from the CartÃ³rio dos Conventos da Ordem da SantissÃ­ma Trindade (Notary’s office of the convents of the Holy Trinity Order). The data and information provided by the documentation, in particular: the nomination of redeeming priests and officials of the Mesa de ConsciÃªncia e Ordens (Table of Conscience and Orders), requests for safe-conducts and passports for the Muslim rulers, donations collection, diplomatic gifts, ship freights and the specific ransoming action of the Portuguese captives in the territories of Morocco and Algiers, is of fundamental importance to the analysis of this problematic for the history of modern Portugal. In these fourteen general ransoms around two thousand and five hundred captives were released whose nationality, occupation, age, captivity time and ransom value will be treated in order to have a better knowledge of this reality, which associated with the captivity itself affected, in last consequence, all the Portuguese society until the signature of the Peace Treaties with Morocco in 1774 and with Algiers in 1810.\n\nAL-BUSAIDI, Ibrahim Yahya Zahran, Oman and Portugal (1650-1730): Politics and economics, PhD in History: History of the Discoveries and Expansion submitted to the School of Arts and Humanities of the Universidade de Lisboa, supervised by AntÃ³nio Dias Farinha, 2010 (http://hdl.handle.net/10451/3525)\n\nKeywords: Oman; Omanis; Portuguese; Estado da India; Imam; Muscat; Mombasa; Goa; Indian Ocean; Arabian Gulf; East Africa; West Indian Coast\n\nAbstract: The Omani-Portuguese relationships had contributed during the period from 1650 to 1730 in changing the balance of power in the Indian Ocean and affected, of course, the Omani relations with the other regional and European forces. After the fall of Muscat in 1650 into Omani hands, the concept of conflict moved from the local context to the overseas conflict required from Oman to have a powerful fleet capable to meet the Portuguese navy. The relationships between Oman and Portuguese have been characterized by competitive form in the willingness of Oman to have a leading role in the Indian Ocean as a maritime nation since old time, and had outstanding contributions in both commercial and civilizational activities in the Medieval Age. There were two historical stages where the luso-omani relations passed through formed as a turning point: 1650 was from the end of the Portuguese political presence in the coast of Oman. While in 1698 was figured in the end of the Portuguese influence in the coast of East Africa. However, despite the intensity rivalry between the two sides, but multiple attempts to have peaceful relations permeated the conflict. The competition has extended into several geographic areas in the western coast of India, the Arabian Gulf, and the Eastern African coasts. While, the competition in India has been illustrated by the Omani yearning to participate in trade with the Indian ports and to make the port of Muscat as a focal point connecting the Indian ports with the Gulf, the clash between the two sides was inevitable because some of these ports were under the Portuguese control. This situation prompted each side to look for means to dwindle the other party, whether by military ways or alliances with other local or European powers. In addition of the Omani aspiration to control the trade route between India and the Gulf, the struggle expanded to the Gulf, where many cooperation efforts were made between Persians and Portuguese in order to devastate the Omani power. In East Africa, the rivalry has taken an expansionist dimension due to historical, cultural and economical factors. Hence, through a half century of contest the “Yaariba” were able to remove the Portuguese from Mombasa, the most important positions in the region in 1698 which paved the way for political, economical and cultural relations with the African nation.\n\nALESSANDRINI, Nunziatella, Italians in Lisbon from 1500 to 1680: from the Florentine to the Genoese hegemonies, PhD in History submitted to the Department of Social Sciences and Management of the Universidade Aberta, supervised by Ana Paula Avelar, 2010 (http://hdl.handle.net/10400.2/1486)\n\nKeywords: History of Portugal; Early Modern age; Portuguese society; Economy; Politics; Trade; Diplomacy; Merchants; Italians; Lisbon\n\nAbstract: The importance of the Italian presence in the Iberian Peninsula was studied by Portuguese and foreign historiography, which focused on the economic and cultural influences of these foreigners since early on to the seventeenth century. The research we developed around this community allowed us to move forward with new data. They complete and deepen the relations network of families and between individuals of Italians living in Lisbon (16th and 17th centuries) with renowned Portuguese families, and analyze the life paths of merchants who have never been studied before. Keeping a constant connection with the past and verifying the reasons underlying the development of the various events, we seek in this work to fit the Italian families and their activity within the Portuguese society of the centuries in question, focusing attention on the passage of the Florentine hegemony of the first decades of the 16th century, to the Genoese hegemony, whose apogee is affirmed from the last quarter of the 16th century. It also presents the profiles of the Italian protagonists in order to unveil the weight of this community in the Portuguese society of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.\n\nALMEIDA, Bruno JosÃ© M. G. Pereira de, The influence of the work of Pedro Nunes on nautical procedures of the 16th and 17th centuries: A study of transmission of knowledge, PhD in History and Philosophy of Science submitted to the Faculty of Sciences of the Universidade de Lisboa, supervised by Henrique JosÃ© Sampaio Soares de Sousa LeitÃ£o, 2011 (http://hdl.handle.net/10451/6699)\n\nKeywords: Pedro Nunes; Art and science of Navigation; Sixteenth and seventeenth century; Knowledge transmission\n\nAbstract: This dissertation aimed to evaluate the transmission of the ideas and of the work on navigation carried out by the cosmographer and mathematician Pedro Nunes. It is known that the texts he had published in 1537 and 1566 had a good acceptance and were acknowledged among erudite circles of Europe. However, due to the theoretical nature of these texts and because they were mostly written in Latin, historiography raised questions about its real impact and diffusion amongst the less lettered, particularly in what regarded pilots and other practical professions. These questions led to issues that had to be clarified in order to better understand the impact of the work of Nunes on of the navigation and seamanship of his time. This thesis sought to evaluate the existence of evidence of such transmission; acknowledge what channels, mechanisms, contexts and people that were responsible for these phenomena, to investigate the kind of knowledge that was disseminated, transmitted and assimilated, and even estimate the extent to which the scientific contributions of Pedro Nunes were integrated in the practice of sailors. Two paths of investigation were followed in order to answer these questions. The first focused on the evaluation of the direct action of Nunes as a cosmographer. Only a few records have survived from this performance. Nevertheless, with the identified evidence and new sources, it was possible to build a more complete image of the impact of his activities. The second path sought to assess in what extent and how the ideas, techniques and results of Pedro Nunes were embedded in the work of others - namely in the work of cosmographers, navigation teachers and mathematicians - and in what contexts of practical cosmography and educational settings in Portugal, Spain and England during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.\n\nALMEIDA, Nilton Melo, New Christians and their descendants in CearÃ¡ Grande: the inquisition in the outback hinterlands, PhD in History: Modern History submitted to the School of Social Sciences and Humanities of the Universidade Nova de Lisboa, supervised by Ana Isabel Buescu and Anita Waingort Novinsky, 2016 (http://hdl.handle.net/10362/24455)\n\nKeywords: CearÃ¡; Inquisition; New Cristians\n\nAbstract: The presence of the New Christians and their descendants in Ceara Grande, a peripheral captaincy considered a “no man's land” in the first two centuries of Portuguese colonization, and as such, an ideal refuge, apparently unreachable by the claws of the Inquisition, is the focus of this inquiry. The research starts out from the racial character, as the vital element of hatred, intolerance and anti-Semitism that swept from Portugal one of the most organized social groups in the nation. At that point, it makes a reflection on the ideas of Benedict Espinosa whose philosophy leaves a lesson of freedom and tolerance to mankind, as current as in the troubled 1600. The study explores and makes an in-depth analysis of cases of descendants of the \"nation people”, living in these regions of northeastern Brazil and brings to light an intriguing quarrel resulting from the epithet \"Jew and New Christian\" wrongfully attributed to the \"good men\" on Earth, even when the distinction between New Christians and Old Christians was already extinct, emphasizing how \"fame\" in itself, serves as a weapon to besmirch the honor of others. In this line of investigation, it analyzes the presence of agents of the Holy Office in the hinterlands and enters a twist of fate that takes a victim of inquisitorial persecution, Josefa Maria dos Reis, living in the same village of the family member who boasts of his father's wanton action in Paraiba. This is Antonio Jose Victoriano Borges da Fonseca, Captain-General and Governor of the captaincy of Ceara Grande, son of Portuguese citizen Antonio Borges da Fonseca. The research interprets how and why the mentality transplanted from the Iberian Peninsula on the myth of purity of blood is invoked in the hinterlands as an instrument of the complex power game among those who dispute the privileged spaces in Colony. In the Greater Ceara Captaincy of the seventeen hundreds, the descendants of Jews and New Christian, albeit from a long line of ascendancy and nevertheless professing a Catholic faith, belonged to “families without merit”, as is emblematic the case of Captain-General Jose Xerez Furna Uchoa. The survey runs through traces of a Portuguese family of New Christians torn apart by the Holy Office. One branch of the family leaves Veiros, Fronteira and Abrantes, goes to Lisbon, purges the exile in Rio de Janeiro, returns to the prisons of Lisbon, receives a permit to live in Abrantes and resurfaces in Lisbon. One of the descendants migrates to Ribeira do AcaraÃº, where he plants definitive roots and produces large offspring. Finally, the investigation reveals the anussim awakening moved by reminiscences evoked in the 21st century and watered by a persistent imaginary of belonging to the Sephardic-Maran nation that amalgamate with the common people of the region.\n\nALVES, Ana Maria Mendes Ruas, “The Kingdom of God and His Righteousness”. D. Frei InÃ¡cio de Santa Teresa (1682-1751), PhD in History: Early Modern History submitted to the Faculty of Arts and Humanities of the Universidade de Coimbra, supervised by JosÃ© Pedro de Matos Paiva, 2013 (https://estudogeral.sib.uc.pt/handle/10316/23062)\n\nKeywords: Not available\n\nAbstract: D. frei InÃ¡cio de Santa Teresa was born in 1682, in Porto. He took the cloth of the Canons Regular of Saint Augustine at the GrijÃ³ monastery. He joined the College of Santa Cruz and then the University, where he would earn a doctorate in theology in 1711. The environment in which he lived provided him with contacts with an intellectual elite who upheld a rigorous and mystical life, under the aegis of the jacobeia, a renewal movement of religious life that emerged at the dawn of the eighteenth century, in Coimbra. The leadership and ingenuity that he showed in his practice soon contributed to have frei Gaspar da EncarnaÃ§Ã£o influence king D. JoÃ£o V to nominate him for the Archdiocese of Goa (December 6, 1720). He was consecrated by Pope Clement XI on February 3, 1721. D. frei InÃ¡cio de Santa Teresa owned a 197 books library which rendered him the archetype of a cultured, pious man, connected with mysticism. His readings made him a remarkable canonical jurist and, at the same time, a shrewd theologian. The archbishop of Goa chose as his mottos the perfective values of penance and mental prayer, that is to say, those of the jacobeia, which he applied in his jurisdiction. The remaining of gentile rites shows the constant difficulties in evangelising the Hindus although the archbishop’s governance was characterised by intolerance and continuing attempts to eradicate those rites. Wanting to eradicate gentile rites was not enough: political communion was needed, which was not available, and above all a strong presence of the king, unreachable. The way in which he modelled his sacred eloquence and exerted his jurisdiction raised many conflicts among the clergy, missions, especially the Jesuits, the Franciscans, the Sisters of Santa Monica and the Bishop of Malacca. The quarrelling relationship between D. frei InÃ¡cio de Santa Teresa and the various ecclesiastical officials were to culminate in an inquisitorial process. Accused of blasphemy, Rome had to intervene. In Goa the archbishop had most qualifiers with him, unlike Lisbon’s General Council of the Holy Office and Cardinal D. Nuno da Cunha. Eventually D. frei InÃ¡cio had the support of the Goa Inquisition and of the Congregation of the Holy Office of the Inquisition at Rome, who exonerated him in 1737. Conflicts also involved the political power, namely the viceroys who took part for the missions. The ruin he found in the Estado da Ãndia made him take severe measures. The action of D. frei InÃ¡cio was not unlike that of other bishops, such as those of Olinda, Angra, and Funchal. His catechetical intention became apparent on his visits that prompted a considerable amount of pastorals. In those he used the coercive style of a vigilant shepherd whose speech is full of orders, mandates and decrees. His subjects were the administration of sacraments, especially confession through which Christians reconciled with God - souls were to be put on the way to Heaven -; baptism, which meant the conversion of more gentiles and the consolidation of Catholic rites; matrimony, where a lot of deviations were found. He was very worried with the teaching of the Portuguese language because its misunderstanding encumbered the missions and the spiritual and temporal reform of the Res Publica. D. frei InÃ¡cio eventually was promoted to the Faro diocese in 1740 where he was also not welcome because of his unchanging attitude. In the Algarve he followed the same rigorist ethics in his visits and pastorals but he experienced the greatest conflicts with the canons of the See, who did not appreciate the new bishop’s demeanour, and with the Inquisition due to the overlap of both jurisdictions. Here the conflicts with the Inquisition were even deeper than in Goa: they related to the breach of the secrecy of confession (sigilism) and to whose jurisdiction did that crime belong. D. frei InÃ¡cio de Santa Teresa joined forces with the bishops of Elvas and Coimbra, and the archbishop of Ãvora, all jacobeus. These bishops issued several pastorals against the edicts of the General Inquisitor and the Patriarch, forcing Pope Benedict XIV to intervene by decreeing a brief and three bulls to resolve this Portuguese issue: the “schism” of sigilism. The bishops were alone in the struggle to defend ordinary jurisdiction. Confession became a tool of power being, as it was, at the source of the conflicts among Portuguese religious institutions, forcing them into a polyhedral debate: Bishops - Inquisition - Roman Curia - Patriarchy - King. The issues raised by D. frei InÃ¡cio de Santa Teresa outsized the disorders that he solved. Nevertheless, his praxis allowed a greater control by the sovereign for, in the end, the monarch was the ultimate referee.\n\nAMORIM, Maria Adelina de Figueiredo Batista, The Franciscan mission in the state of GrÃ£o-ParÃ¡ and MaranhÃ£o (1622-1750): Agents, structures and dynamics, PhD in History: History and Culture of Brazil submitted to the School of Arts and Humanities of the Universidade de Lisboa, supervised by AntÃ³nio Dias Farinha, 2011 (http://hdl.handle.net/10451/5393)\n\nKeywords: Colonial Amazonia; GrÃ£o-ParÃ¡ and MaranhÃ£o State; Evangelization; Franciscan Order; Indians; Missions; Descending; Indigenous Politics; Friar CristÃ³vÃ£o de Lisboa; Historiography\n\nAbstract: The organics of the Mendicant Order are systematized in presence of an abundant and unpublished documentation, as well as its principal agents (i.e. Friar CristovÃ£o de Lisboa) and historical way in the Portuguese colonial Amazonia. The mechanisms and dynamics used by the Minor Friars during their apostolate are explained, in particular those from the Province of Santo Antonio - the first one responsible on this process - relating them with other institutions and agents, both in ground (from the inhabitants, Indian or White, to the members of local management and other regular orders and secular clergy) and in Kingdom (from the Crown to the instances that regulate the ecclesiastic life and evangelization). Thus, the sense of Mission of the Franciscan Order in its arcane roots and the organics of the subsequent structures are studied, starting from the presupposition that if there isn‘t that founding matrix, the desideratum of evangelizing, propagate the Christian faith, divulge the message, preach the Gospel, the existence of this very organization in the old colonial State of the Northern part of Brazil would be endangered. Following the exportation of evangelizing practices and pedagogical patterns, the action of the Antonian Franciscans in the Amazonian space, in XVII and XVIII centuries, was an 15 history marked by two distinct and complementary forms: the fidelity to identity values and to a place of presence, i.e., an institution with Rule, its own statutes, jurisdiction and its application, so many times applied in a contradictory and contentious way. This explains the identitary role of the Antonians and also the conflicts with the colonial governing structures, among the several laic and religious groups, and even within the existing structures among the three branches of the Franciscan family, with the arriving of Piedade friars (1693) and the separation of those of ConceiÃ§Ã£o (1706). The history of this institution must be understood not only from its actuation inside the colonial space where it was integrated, but also within the dynamics of the Seraphic Order, which was always a decisive factor, asserting its privileges, prerogatives and jurisdictions in any place of the Portuguese Empire. It matters to understand the way the Franciscans acted, which are the methods they used and what are the differences in relation to other similar institutions. What identitary mark allowed them to distinguish themselves from the other agents in the ground? What difference? Is there a difference? And if History needs to interpret the subjacent memorable vestiges, this study will demonstrate that the Franciscans did not write their History in the sand, and that is possible to inscribe a new chapter in the Luso-Brazilian historiography. The present dissertation deals with this historical, ideological, cultural and artistic legacy built by the Franciscans of Santo Antonio, since 1621, in harmony with the formation of the ParÃ¡ and MaranhÃ£o State.\n\nARAÃJO, Ana Paula Azevedo Duarte de, Health, disease and assistance to the rural populations in Portugal in the 18th century. The minhoto frame: realities and representations, PhD in History: Modern History submitted to the Institute of Social Sciences of the Universidade do Minho, supervised by JosÃ© Viriato Capela and Maria Marta Lobo de AraÃºjo, 2017 (http://hdl.handle.net/1822/46007)\n\nKeywords: Not available\n\nAbstract: The aim of this work was to analyze the health conditions, diseases and the assistance to the rural Portuguese populations from Minho of the 18th century. On an initial approach, and taking into account the debate, the scientific progress and the evolution of knowledge, the comprehension of religious manifestations and practices, which are subjacent to the help request, fight disease and to the community search for the divine help as a relief for their conditions was attempted. Therefore, the focus was on the religious and psychological universe of this period, where the representations of the disease and its cure, the patron saints and the miracles were studied. Furthermore, it was intended to perceive the divine’s contribution to the treatment of illness in the overall framework of the minhoto devotional, based on the data in MemÃ³rias Paroquiais de 1758. Subsequently, there was a pursuit to the understanding of the main saints’ impact on the ill population. On a second stage of this investigation, the interest was on the study of water, its therapeutic properties and the way it constituted an alternative to the pharmacological treatment of the epoch. The nature of this healing method was essentially popular, religious and magical, and remained constant until the 19th century, when the scientific recognition of the scientific healing properties of thermal water happened, with the rise of hydrotherapy and its regulation by the medical sector. There was also an intention to enhance the overview regarding the important role that water played in the welfare of Minho’s population during the 18th century, along with the religious phenomenon and the experiences and mindset of this community, using MemÃ³rias Paroquiais de 1758 and AquilÃ©gio Medicinal as structural works. On the third and last stage, the institutional responses to diseases were analyzed, not only in an administrative point of view, but also in the one of counties, towns and parishes. The network of charity institutions and hospitals established in Minho’s region were studied, their development level, and their responses of assistance to the population. Moreover, it was also intended to comprehend the duty of the Benedictine monastery on this assistance in Minho’s rural regions during the 18th century.\n\nBARBOSA, AntÃ³nio Francisco Dantas, Times of Festivity in Ponte de Lima (17th-19th centuries), PhD in History: Modern History submitted to the Institute of Social Sciences of the Universidade do Minho, supervised by Maria Marta Lobo de AraÃºjo, 2014 (http://hdl.handle.net/1822/34701)\n\nKeywords: Not available\n\nAbstract: The object of study of this work focus on the characterization and analyzis of the festivities taking place in Ponte de Lima between the second half of the 17th century and the first half of the 18th century. Therefore, trying to understand all these expressions of joy, catharsis, and anamnesis, we focus on the Mother Church, on Igreja dos Terceiros de SÃ£o Francisco of Ponte de Lima, and at the village municipality as promoters of these solemn festivities, which broke the daily routine of the people from Ponte de Lima, in the study period. In the village church there was a great variety of brotherhood associations that not only provided it with a great artistic and cultural heritage, but also transformed it into a stage for the performance of many festive celebrations. The cult of Virgin Mary was an important part of these festivities worshiping Nossa Senhora das Dores, Nossa Senhora da ExpectaÃ§Ã£o, Nossa Senhora da AssunÃ§Ã£o and Nossa Senhora do Carmo. Although some of these festivities were only attached to merely devotional practices, excluding fun and profane activities, others joined the sacred and the profane. The peoples’ beliefs, full of rituals and gestures, had at those festive occasions a significant role with a greater stability and vitality Not less important was Igreja dos Terceiros de SÃ£o Francisco that, just like the Mother Church, organized several festivities such as ProcissÃ£o de Cinzas, which started the Lenten Period, a moment of great symbolism for the Catholics. To achieve this purpose the members of the institution stepped up efforts to make this event brighten up and to have such a great visibility as the other festivities organized by the other institutions. But could the members of Ordem Terceira of Ponte de Lima have other purposes making these festive celebrations? The answer to this issue has also been enlightened throughout this work. Ponte de Lima carried about and was responsible for “Corpus Christi” that, according to the lunar calendar, made part of the group of festivities with not fixed starting date. This event praised the village with the magnificent and splendid procession, what was an example for all the others. Although it had the municipality and the village church as the main driving forces, all the craftsmen guilds, brotherhoods and individuals made their contribution too. This way, this procession mirrored the everyday reality of Ponte de Lima, the people`s beliefs and also the social and political life, as well as the customs and traditions. However, not only these festivities, taking place according to the Seasons, transformed this Alto Minho village. Also those connected to the biological cycle of the main family: births, weddings, deaths, as well as those of political interest, which were visible in the first half of the 19th century, provided great moments of joy to the inhabitants of Ponte de Lima. It was in these three different places that this great diversity of festivities was expressed. Although being independent from one another, they joined together during these moments to make their festivities glamorous. The village city hall, as a means of communication between the authorities and the citizens, played a leading and controlling role of Ponte de Lima society. These festivals not only gave legal force to the royal and the local power, but were also a good moment for the most ambitious to assert their power and interests. These celebrations, which involved the whole society, were during this study period, a target of changes made by the new political and social situation, mainly in the late 18th century and the first half of the 19th century.\n\nBOSCARIOL, Mariana Amabile, Two sides of the same coin: The Jesuit mission in Brazil and in Japan (1549-1597), PhD in History: Discoveries and Portuguese Expansion History submitted to the School of Social Sciences and Humanities of the Universidade Nova de Lisboa, supervised by JoÃ£o Paulo Oliveira e Costa, 2018 (http://hdl.handle.net/10362/35960)\n\nKeywords: Jesuits; Brazil; Japan\n\nAbstract: The period in which the territory under the Portuguese Patronage reached its greatest amplitude was the middle of the sixteenth century, having as limits Brazil and Japan. The Society of Jesus, founded in the year 1540, was promptly absorbed by the Portuguese expansionist project and, consequently, by the Patronage. In this scenario, the thesis focused on the period from 1549, year of foundation of a Jesuit mission in Brazil and in Japan, until 1597, year of death of two of its most iconic figures, being JosÃ© de Anchieta in the Brazilian territory and Luis FrÃ³is among the Japanese. Besides them, Manuel da NÃ³brega and Alessandro Valignano were the missionaries elected to the investigation. From this, the research intended to work on the hypothesis that, during the sixteenth century, the development of the Jesuit missionary activity, and the consequent direction it took, depended much more on individual initiatives of the missionaries then on a normative determined by the Order, the Church or the Crown. Thus, in both cases we can find among the Jesuits those who were more conservative and resistant to the new strategies of evangelization, as well as others who were more open and innovative. The four missionaries selected here supported in some measure the adaptation to the native world, coming to confront those who had objections to their work. The circulation of people, thoughts and experiences eventually had an impact inside Europe, which inevitably made the Society of Jesus and the Catholic Church to reevaluate and adjust some of their guidelines to the new dimension they faced. From the analysis of these two cases, the edges of the Jesuit campaign under the authority of the Portuguese Patronage, we can verify how it was a global project that still intended to be harmonious and uniform, but which demanded different responses and investments, generating differentiated forms of the missionary activity and of a Christendom.\n\nBRACHT, Fabiano, At the Rhythm of the Monsoons.

Furthermore, libraries went through a very distinctive affirmation process from the one archives also met; it becomes then relevant to gather information allowing us to understand the moment libraries started being considered by the royal authority as an important tool to build the modern state. The analysis, and evaluation of historical sources indicates that change has happened in Portugal during the second half of the Eighteenth century. During that same period, other institutions within the cultural area are launched, and their common main goal is to support the State while contributing to its modernization. The Royal Public Library is one of these institutions, and the coordination of its mission, structure and means aim at this broader goal. Nevertheless the creation and success of the Royal Library does neither rely upon the linear application of a legal document, nor upon individual wills. The Royal Library reflects a thought, and a will which are carried out by different personalities, following distinct patterns according to their own interests, academic and intellectual education, and personal background. Three unique personalities in Portuguese cultural and political life put forward into the Royal Library their own vision for an institution with this scale. During their intervention, undoubtedly confirmed by historical sources, a change in procedures and priorities takes place. In the period between 1796 and 1802, at the peak of changes, the Royal Library crossed the line of modernity, and a new paradigm is enforced. During that same period, the Royal Library has incorporated several bibliographical collections from various origins, introduced a classification scheme, and got ready to open the reading service to the public following regulations specially prepared. Frei Manuel do CenÃ¡culo has been in favour of a public library since the time he was chairman of the Mesa CensÃ³ria; Doutor AntÃ³nio Ribeiro dos Santos managed to organize the collections gathered whether coming from other institutions or bought; D. Rodrigo de Sousa Coutinho never faded, and hard legislated in defense of the institution. The Royal Library then found support and gained recognition based upon this joint effort.\n\nCALDEIRA, JoÃ£o LuÃ­s Cabral PicÃ£o, The Morgadio (Entail) and the Expansion in the Atlantic Islands (Azores, Madeira and Cape Verde), PhD in History submitted to the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences of the Universidade LusÃ­ada, supervised by LuÃ­s Manuel Aguiar de Morais Teixeira, 2012 (http://hdl.handle.net/11067/550)\n\nKeywords: Inheritance; Succession; Portugal; Azores; Madeira; Cape Verde; Genealogy\n\nAbstract: The main goal of the present thesis is the study of the entail from an institutional point of view and the comparison of the entail in Portugal and the Atlantic Islands (Azores, Madeira and Cape Verde). The analysis of the entail system in continental Portugal is not only justified by the need to explain the origins of the entail system, but also to serve as a comparative model. In conclusion, despite some specific details, the system of entail from both Azores and Madeira is similar to that of continental Portugal, from both jurisdictional and institutional point of views (the figure of the founder of the entail, the heir, the main house of the entail, the church, where the founder had its tomb on a privileged location, estate, document of foundation, and family documents - livro de tombo (book of estate registration), book of the entail and chronicles). In what concerns the Cape Verde archipelago, considering some of its characteristics and entails (quality of the founder, link between entail and slavery, geographical dispersion of the estate, language - crioulo, and a particular culture), the entails in this archipelago, though inspired by those of continental Portugal, show a formal similitude and not the similarity mentioned in the case of Azores and Madeira, especially in what refers to the most relevant foundation elements. Finally, focusing on the dates of beginning and end of the entail system in these territories some differences also stand out. In continental Portugal the first entails date from early fourteenth century, in Azores from late fifteen century, in Madeira from the last quarter of the fifteen century, and in Cape Verde from early sixteen century. In all territories, the extinction of the entail system was a consequence of the Law of 19th May, 1863. Nevertheless, this Law only became effective in Santiago (Cape Verde) on the 10th May, 1864.\n\nCAMPOS, Fernanda Maria Alves da Silva Guedes de, Libraries of History: Aspects of books’ ownership and use by religious institutions in Lisbon at the end of 18th century, PhD in History submitted to the School of Social Sciences and Humanities of the Universidade Nova de Lisboa, supervised by Ana Isabel Buescu, 2014 (http://hdl.handle.net/10362/11396)\n\nKeywords: Religious libraries; Lisbon; 18th century; Reading practices; Ownership and use of books; Books of History; Cultural History\n\nAbstract: The presence of books in religious institutions is recognized as evidence in the Rules of different orders and acknowledged in inventories and catalogues prepared in distinct moments of their history. Reading is integrated in the activities of monastic life and there is confirmation that the largest quantity of books and number of readers were concentrated in those institutions, during the Old Regime. Our aim was to study particular aspects regarding the ownership and use of books in Lisbon’s religious houses at the end of 18th century. The reason for choosing the capital is the fact that it concentrated a large number of monasteries and convents both masculine and feminine of various dimensions and affiliated to different religious orders. As to the chronological span, consideration was given to institutions founded from the beginnings of the Portuguese monarchy to the times of queen Maria the first, providing they still existed by the end of the century. The chosen title of this thesis - Libraries of History - identifies an option for a specific subject of interest with the objective of identifying what was the role of History in the collections of those libraries and what were the reading orientations in this respect. Data collecting to identify the History books of religious provenance was performed at the National Library of Portugal which is the most prominent receiver of the religious libraries extinguished after 1834. The study provides the contexts and circumstances regarding the establishment of religious orders in Lisbon and its outskirts and their evolution until extinction. Within this structural framework, the libraries were investigated in order to understand the extent of their collections and especially those of History, by using primary sources of the 18th century and applying a comparative methodological approach. The contact with the real books both from institutional and private religious provenances remained a preferred source for determining reading practices in this specific environment because many of them bear evidences of ownership and use. The books thus found were treated as a series and studied through a quantitative method in order to highlight the main tendencies in the reading of History books, which included language, date and place of publication, and detailed topics within History, in relation to the convents where these books did exist. The next stage was to analyze authors and titles either to confirm the existence of a canon, whenever they occurred in a number of institutions or to emphasize certain singularities, especially regarding the presence of works that were significant at the time. In order to better understand reading orientations, an enhanced research about the books originating from the libraries of S. Vicente de Fora, S. Francisco da Cidade and Santo Alberto was developed by using their catalogues as primary sources and the results are presented as case studies. With this research we aimed at building a reference framework presenting a new vision about reading practices in religious houses and wider perspectives for the study of cultural history in Portugal at the end of 18th century.\n\nCAMPOS, Nuno LuÃ­s de Vila-Santa Braga, The House of Atouguia, the last Avis and the Empire: Crossing dynamics in the career of D. LuÃ­s de AtaÃ­de (1516-1581), PhD in History: Discoveries and Portuguese Expansion History submitted to the School of Social Sciences and Humanities of the Universidade Nova de Lisboa, supervised by Alexandra PelÃºcia, 2014 (http://hdl.handle.net/10362/12269)\n\nKeywords: Nobility; Vice-Roy; Estado da Ãndia; Morroco; Court; D. SebastiÃ£o; Philip II; Dynastic Crisis\n\nAbstract: Twice Vice-roy of India (1568-1571; 1578-1581), a general nominated and kept away, in 1577, from what was to become the Alcazar-Quibir journey and the personage to whom has been attributed the intention of supporting D. AntÃ³nio, Prior do Crato, with military aid, from India, in his struggle against Philip II, in 1580-81, D. LuÃ­s de AtaÃ­de is a key personage for the understanding of the Realm and the Empire dynamics. Thus, the present work attempts to study the social, political and military path of his figure, linking it to the main events that took place during the reigns of D. SebastiÃ£o, D. Henrique and the period of the dynastic crisis. This analysis is done departing from the three main dynamics along the career of AtaÃ­de whose relevance justifies the study of his figure and his times: the House of nobility from which he came, his action as a governor of the Empire in the sixteenth century, mainly through a detailed review of his governments in India as well as of the generelship, and his role in the courts of kings John III, D. SebastiÃ£o, D. Henrique and of Philip II. Aiming since the beginning at rebuilding the hole career of D. LuÃ­s de AtaÃ­de, the goal is to put in context and debate about the relevance of his action along the several conjunctions of his life. So, the work is divided into three main sections. In the first one, mainly chapters I and II, trying to frame the evolution of the House of Atouguia from its foundation in the fifteenth century until the moment when D. LuÃ­s assumed it. For this purpose analysis is made of the ambience of his birth as well as of his first military experiences in the Indean Ocean and at Muhlberg, for the occasion of his embassy to Emperor Charles V in 1547, with contextual minutiae. In the second seccion, embrassing chapters III and IV, the career of this nobleman is detailed for the reigns of D. SebastiÃ£o, D. Henrique and for the period of dynastic crisis. Beginning with the study of AtaÃ­de ́s rapport with the main protagonists in power, we revisit his nominations as vice-roy and general, in 1568 and 1577, and debate minuciously about his policies during the governments of India and his generalship. Focus is also placed on the evolution of his House during this time. In the third section, mainly the V chapter, we analyse the images of D. LuÃ­s that have been implanted along the centuries, debating in the Conclusion the pertinancy and correspondence of those images with the historical facts. Thefore, this works aims contributing not only to the knowledge of the career of D. LuÃ­s de AtaÃ­de but also at revisiting and digging deep into a period of transition, the reigns of D. SebastiÃ£o, D. Henrique, and the period of the dynastic crisis, mainly in the Empire, hoping to achieve a better knowledge of the historic period that succedded: the philipine Portugal.\n\nCANAS, AntÃ³nio JosÃ© Duarte Costa, The nautical work of JoÃ£o Baptista Lavanha (c. 1550-1624), PhD in History: History of the Discoveries and Expansion submitted to the School of Arts and Humanities of the Universidade de Lisboa, supervised by Francisco Contente Domingues, 2012 (http://hdl.handle.net/10451/6140)\n\nKeywords: Chief cosmographer; Lavanha; Magnetic variation; Mathematics; Nautical science\n\nAbstract: The main objective of this thesis is to examine the nautical texts of JoÃ£o Baptista Lavanha. Lavanha lived in the transition from the sixteenth to the seventeenth century, carring out most of his intellectual activity after the establishment of Â«UniÃ£o IbÃ©ricaÂ». Multifaceted character, he wrote texts on naval architecture, cosmography, genealogy, history and nautical science. This analysis will start with a biographical note about Lavanha. We also intend to write about the most important moments of his life, and to understand to what extent the environment surrounding him interfered in the way his career developed. Regarding the study of his contributions to nautical, it begins with a chapter dedicated to all the texts which have identified issues of navigation, even in an indirect way. After we have three chapters, each dedicated to one individual text. The first is the text of the Tratado del arte de navegar. It contains notes from classes he taught at the Academy of Mathematics, in Madrid. Its content is essentially theoretical, based on Pedro Nunes, for the most part of the issues presented. The second text is the Regimento nÃ¡utico. We are in the presence of a work printed by Lavanha shortly after being appointed chief cosmographer of Portugal. The text provides pilots with the knowledge needed to performing their jobs. Finally, the third text contains tables amplitude calculated by Lavanha. The amplitude was used to obtain the variation of the magnetic compass, observing the Sun at sunrise or at sunset.\n\nCAPELÃO, Rosa Maria dos Santos, The cult of relics in Portugal in the 16th-17th centuries.

We inspect a variety of texts (letters, reports and “diarios de bordo”) written by Portuguese travelers since the beginning of the XVIth century, that included important novelties and descriptions about the Indian nature. Some of these reports remained manuscript but others were validated and divulged by the Portuguese physician Garcia de Orta in his treatise, ColÃ³quios dos Simples e Drogas da India (Goa, 1563). This medical-Â¬botanical compendium, entirely devoted to the Oriental natural products, became the center of our analysis. Despite the relevance of this work, the main researches on Orta continue to rely on Count of Ficalho’s XIX century studies, in particular his authoritative biography on the Garcia de Orta and the first critical edition of the ColÃ³quios dos Simples. In our study we propose new perspectives of interpretation of Orta’s treatise. We inquire how Orta represented himself and question how this image evolved along the years. We try to understand Garcia de Orta’s working method; we identify his manuscript and printed sources; list the books of his own library and try to verify whether experience or texts were more important in his project of reconstruction of scientific knowledge. We recognize in this treatise the innovative elements that characterize the Natural History approach revealed in the Iberian Empires. As defended by the modern Historiography, these compendiums dictated a change in the methods of prospection, observation and description of the natural world used afterwards.\n\nCRUZ, Miguel Dantas da, The Overseas Council and the military administration of Brazil (from Restoration to Pombalism): Politics, finance and bureaucracy, PhD in History: Change and Continuity in a Global World (PIUDHist - Inter-university Doctoral Programme in History) submitted to the School of Sociology and Public Policy of ISCTE-IUL, supervised by JosÃ© Vicente SerrÃ£o, 2013 (http://hdl.handle.net/10071/6765)\n\nKeywords: Imperial history; Military history; Political history; Institutional history; Appointments; War funding; Colonial wars; Colonial politics; Colonial policy; Jurisdictional conflicts; Polissinodal system; Overseas Council; Brazil\n\nAbstract: This study addresses the military attributions and roles carried out by the Overseas Council in the defense of colonial Brazil. In a related way, it also deals with the political and institutional backdrop of the military administration of the same territory. Throughout the study we follow with utmost attention the ability shown by Overseas counselors in their pursuit to impose a leadership-kind of role over this area of the colonial administration. At the same time, we try to unveil in what way this general posture conditioned the Council relations with other political authorities, metropolitan or colonial. The study shows that despite its exclusion from the top political circles, where Portuguese shaped their colonial policy regarding the treats to the Brazilian territory, the Overseas Council was extremely influential in other areas of the colonial administration, militarily wise. For several decades, the Overseas counselors were a predominant force in the management of the financial resources applied in the defense of Brazil. Simultaneously, they were able to exert a significant influence in the touchy subject of the military appointments. Despite the prevailing resistance of the governors-general and viceroys, the counselors were able to control the ground rules of the bureaucratic procedures involved in the selection of regular army officers to all the major captaincies. In addition, the study also shows how the novelties introduced by the crown in overseas administration at the beginning of the eighteenth century (like the repeated appointment of viceroys to Bahia) had an instant negative impact in the Overseas Council jurisdictions. Therefore, it is stressed that the well-known decline of the Overseas Council was triggered several decades before the arrival of the Marquis of Pombal.\n\nDANTAS, VinÃ­cius Orlando de Carvalho, The Count of Castelo Melhor and the question of valor in the Post-Restauration Portugal (1662-1667), PhD in History: Modern History submitted to the School of Social Sciences and Humanities of the Universidade Nova de Lisboa, supervised by Pedro Cardim, 2017\n\nKeywords: Not available\n\nAbstract: Not available\n\nDAVID, Elisabetta Colla Rosado Coelho, Xiangshan xianzhi 香山縣誌 and Aomen JilÃ¼e 澳門紀略: local Chinese sources for a cultural history of Macao (1661-1796), PhD in International Doctoral Program in Culture Studies submitted to the Faculty of Human Sciences of Universidade CatÃ³lica Portuguesa, supervised by Jorge Manuel dos Santos Alves and Roderich Ptak, 2012 (http://hdl.handle.net/10400.14/10126)\n\nKeywords: Local gazetteers; Aomen JilÃ¼e; Xiangshan xianzhi; Macao; Cultural History\n\nAbstract: This work is part of a project funded by the Science and Technology Foundation, names - TomÃ¡s Pereira S.

Imposing herself in a man’s world, she managed their domain with skill, especially that of the Atlantic archipelagos, which occupied a prominent place in the Iberian politics of the time. Analysing in detail the overseas policy of the House of Viseu during this period, as well as Beatriz’s key role in the occupation and colonisation of the Atlantic islands and the pressing need to study the relation between noble women and power at the dawn of Early Modern period, supports the main topic/subject for this project. Our goal is to understand the ruling of the infant Dona Beatriz whilst head of the House of Viseu, taking into special consideration the spatial boundary of the Atlantic domain.\n\nDIAS, Ãrika Simone de Almeida Carlos, Â«As pessoas mais distintas em qualidade e negÃ³cioÂ»: political relations and Commerce Company in Pernambuco in the last quarter of the eighteenth century, PhD in History: Discoveries and Portuguese Expansion History submitted to the School of Social Sciences and Humanities of the Universidade Nova de Lisboa, supervised by Ãngela M.

Among them, we emphasize the creation and performance of the Company General of Pernambuco and ParaÃ­ba - because we believe that Pombal was the main measure for that part of the empire - and its political significance and economic relations between rulers, elites and the two main organs of central government for the \"achievements of the government ': the Overseas Council and the State Department of Navy and Overseas. The main concerns of vassals at the time of the institution pombalina were also analyzed and found to be in direct communication with the Crown, the vassals recovered speeches that evoked the ancient covenant relationship that bound them to the king. In addition to negotiating conflict, the concern with the colonial trade and the expansion of agriculture - frequent themes in the correspondence between the regional government and the institutions of central power - gave prominence to political communication between Pernambuco and Lisbon, in order to realize circuits of information between the two sides of the Atlantic, the speeches and actions - political, economic and defense of the empire - which emanated from the central government for the captaincy. Also to understand if the orders proceeded from the political center have been fulfilled in the last quarter of the eighteenth century and early nineteenth century.\n\nENCARNAÃÃO, Marcelo Augusto Flores Reis da, The battle of Toro, PhD in History submitted to the Faculty of Arts and Humanities of the Universidade do Porto, supervised by LuÃ­s Miguel Duarte and Maria Isabel del Val Valdivieso, 2012 (http://hdl.handle.net/10216/62447)\n\nKeywords: Portugal; Castile; 15th century; Alphonse V; Catholic Kings; Enrique IV; Juana; Battle; Toro\n\nAbstract: This dissertation aims to study how King Alphonse V’s army entered Castile in 1475. This fact will be analyzed from both a political and military point of view and comparing sources from Portugal, Castile and Aragon. In this sense the work will focus on the complexity of different perceptions of the reality of the time, particularly from chronicles of that period. When Enrique IV died on 12th December 1474, Alphonse V believed himself to be a legitimate heir to the throne because he thought this was the late king’s desire. Furthermore, he married Juana, who was Enrique’s daughter and thus gathered support in Portugal and Castile. Initially this military campaign was successful when Ferdinand I of Castile besieged Toro and failed to expel Alphonse V; when the cities of Toro and Zamora declared their commitment to Alphonse and Juana’s cause; or when Alphonse V, the African won the battle of BaltanÃ¡s. However, as the Catholic Kings ensured more support to their cause, the Portuguese cause was walking towards its demise, which reached the point of no return after the battle of Toro, on 1st March 1476. During a period of four years there was not only a war, there was also a political conflict between the two kingdoms. There was a “tug of war” between the nobility and monarchy in Castile, which was common in late medieval monarchies. The lack of international help and the change of opinion of Prince John, in order to find a solution for this conflict, contributed to a search for peace, which was only established in 1479.\n\nESPADA, Maria de Jesus Sequeira, From Malacca to Singapore passing by Tugu: portraits of those who have the sea as a cradle, PhD in History submitted to the Department of Social Sciences and Management of the Universidade Aberta, supervised by Ana Paula Avelar and Brian Juan O'Neill, 2012 (http://hdl.handle.net/10400.2/2502)\n\nKeywords: History of Portugal; Portuguese discoveries; Colonization; Cultural identity; Luso-descendants; Acculturation; East; Asia\n\nAbstract: In the last decades, academic studies have given special attention to the existence of Eurasian communities in Southeast Asia. Particularly, the social and cultural history of Portuguese-descendant communities has recently become the focus of research by analysts from different areas of study. The analysis of such Portuguese studies allows us to comprehend the successive intellectual approaches to this matter and to be aware of the political and cultural atmosphere in which authors write. This was the starting point of this Thesis, which set sail from the birth of the Portuguese descendant communities in Malacca, in the 16th century, investigating their contribution to the increase of the cultural diversity of Southeast Asia and focussing hereafter in the case of Tugu and Singapore. In Asia, the Portuguese presence could be felt through the implementation and strengthening of a network system designed along the routes of commerce and faith, providing the necessary basis for the creation of a “transport” language and contributing to the emergence of groups with new ways of thinking, ideas and concepts, attitudes and ways of life. In this context, the necessary conditions for the emergence of linguistic and cultural syncretism, which are the results of the contact between the colonizer, the missionary and the native, and were, in the Portuguese Expansion, encouraged by Afonso de Albuquerque, whose politics of “married men” was encouraging the Portuguese to marry local women, for a fast and effective linkage to territory. Thus we can say that Creole communities were born from the encounters between Portuguese and natives in 16th century Southeast Asia - particularly in Malacca, after its conquest by the Portuguese in 1511, but also in Ceylon, India, Batavia and later in Singapore in the 19th century. As it is common knowledge, it was forbidden for women to travel with men as they were not useful to war. With the absence of European women, European men married native women, and this situation was encouraged by the Crown as part of Afonso de Albuquerque’s politic of a fast settling of the seaports of trade. On studying the successive formation of images and stereotypes we dealt with some concepts and ideas like the one of Orient, colonial empires and their civilizing mission, nationalisms and, finally, the birth and development of Cultural Studies. In each and every one of these steps we tried to outline the development of Portuguese Oriental Studies, together with the analysis of the French and English Schools. These were our main perspectives, bounded by three specific features: ethnic identity, language and religion. The case of Tugu, as of Singapore, has been somehow ignored by most Portuguese researchers, perhaps because they were never Portuguese colonies. In so doing, it has remained practically unknown that an important evidence of Portuguese culture has survived in this small village in the North of the island of Java, in Indonesia. Indeed, the members of this community have been singing for the last 350 the same songs sung in Portuguese-based Creole, and have been giving Portuguese names to their children, speaking the fragments of a Portuguese-based Creole. As to Singapore, it has been overlooked that an important piece of the Portuguese Padroado - St. Joseph’s Church - was built there, soon after 1819, by the time Singapore became a British Establishment. The fact that the members of this community lived in a British colony, but pertained to a Portuguese catholic parish, led to a history of complex identity management by those who had come to Singapore, in search of a better life, chiefly from Malacca, but also from Macao, India, and Ceylon. Because of the early connections to Malacca, we intend to analyse the development of family ties and other primary solidarities, and of social and cultural interactions between both communities across the years. We believe that the groups’ management of elements in presence and its conscious or unconscious construction of malleable identities are worth of analysis, as also of celebration. Furthermore, it was our intent to analyse the possible contemporary existence of a double and simultaneous identity, Singaporean and Eurasian, and which factors are still in presence that allow us to connect the latter to a distant cultural Portuguese heritage. This debate is driven to a great extent by the attempt to explain some of the reasons for the longevity of these three communities; for their acknowledgment by surrounding environment; and for the contemporary use of elements considered part of a vast Portuguese cultural heritage, but also by the attempt to place it within a broader political, social and cultural context. As we can see, some cultural traces are not easily extinct, surviving despite of the little interest shown by the academicians. In this work, we try to point out which are the existing conditions for the emergence of some of these indicative vectors of the existence of difference of a group, in particular of language - the Portuguese based Creole - as a result of physical and cultural mixing carried at last in the Portuguese Expansion in Asia, giving origin to new ethnic communities. Finally, we investigated the communities today and the role played by the aforesaid three factors together with a few identity consolidators like family relations, traditions, cooking and associations studying local publications and undertaking interviews in loco. This means that in De Malaca a Singapura passando por Tugu we ultimately made a different approach to the subject of Creoleness and of Portuguese descent, trying to understand images and stereotypes built throughout the years and making yet our own examination of the matter. We pointed out several relations of power that brought to the recognition of these communities’ uniqueness and the role of language in that phenomenon, as well as its diffusion in times of fundamental changes. We finished with a short look towards the period of Dutch colonization and the survival of some of these groups and the language, the dynamic of contacts and movements and a short reference to the use of the Creole and of the oral tradition, nowadays, known to be the result of a Portuguese ancestral influence. This study tried, naturally, to be a possible approach among many, in the hope that, by chance, others would follow us, therefore contributing to the development of dialogs and of scientific discussions about the subject.\n\nFALCÃO, Nuno Fernando de Pinho e Silva de Almeida, The Reformation in charism and action: The Congregation of St. John the Evangelist (LÃ³ios) (Italy, Portugal and Africa - ca.1420/1580), PhD in History submitted to the Faculty of Arts and Humanities of the Universidade do Porto, supervised by Elvira Cunha de Azevedo Silva Mea, 2016 (https://repositorio-aberto.up.pt/handle/10216/95480)\n\nKeywords: Not available\n\nAbstract: Not available\n\nFEIO, GonÃ§alo Maria Duarte Couceiro, Military teaching and learning in Portugal and in the Empire, from D.

In the beginning of the century the crown still relied also on the noble host for a few military operations but from the 1520s the noble host and the Military Orders gradually start losing their power and significance. Without a permanent and formal military institution the process of teaching and learning became dependent upon simple processes of learning through imitation and procedure repetition.

The first objective is to outline the life course of Soror Isabel do Menino Jesus (16731752), baptised as Isabel Fernandes, born in MarvÃ£o, Alto Alentejo, Portugal, a nun from the Order of Saint Claire, in the Convent of Saint Claire, in Portalegre, Portugal, who died reputed to be a saint and with the prestige of a master of spirit, after having lived there almost fifty years, where she was master of the Order and abbess. The second objective is to analyse the texts of the author, which emphasise exclusively on the ascetic and the mystique: thirty-six letters, an autobiography, a supplication and a treaty. Her work proposes a spiritual path in accordance with the Franciscan and the Carmelite mystical schools of thought, by the three ways of the spirit (purgative, illuminative and unitive) and by three dark nights; and insists on chastity, to which she calls science of virtues. Thus, a case study is presented, within the framework of Catholic Orthodoxy, on the grounds that it was on this field that the author wrote, receiving positive remarks by her Order and the censorship. Her work was printed in 1757, five years after her death, assembled by Father Martinho de SÃ£o JosÃ©, her confessor, with her portrait, engraved by the French artist Jean-Baptiste Michel Le Bouteaux. The autograph manuscript, believed to be lost after disappearing at the time of the convent's extinction in 1834, was found in Lisbon, in 2013, in an antiquarian bookshop and was bought by the MarvÃ£o municipality. This document, of which a transcription is presented, was the first source of this thesis, followed by many others, manuscripts and printed works, contributing for summoning the author in the general knowledge of Portuguese female writers as well as the mystics of Portugal, of which little is known.\n\nFERNANDES, MÃ¡rio SimÃµes, The Company of Jesus and astronomical knowledge in Portugal in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries: Comet theories, PhD in History: Early Modern History submitted to the School of Arts and Humanities of the Universidade de Lisboa, supervised by Miguel CorrÃªa Monteiro and Henrique Sousa LeitÃ£o, 2017 (http://hdl.handle.net/10451/28718)\n\nKeywords: Not available\n\nAbstract: Not available\n\nFERNANDES, Paula Sofia Costa, MisericÃ³rdia's hospital of Penafiel (1600-1850), PhD in History: Modern History submitted to the Institute of Social Sciences of the Universidade do Minho, supervised by Maria Marta Lobo de AraÃºjo, 2016 (http://hdl.handle.net/1822/40782)\n\nKeywords: Not available\n\nAbstract: Our essay focuses on Penafiel Hospital of Santa Casa da MisericÃ³rdia, from 1600 to 1850. We analysed its evolution, concerning its building location, the hired staff to pay assistance to patients, its users, the pathologies they suffered, the used treatment and its pharmacy, inserting it in the guild which administrated it. We have tried to establish connections and see the hospital as one of the utilities and functions of the Holy House of Mercy Hospital along others. For that, we had to contextualize with the birth, affirmation and consolidation of the Guild and its remaining work that the Mercy Hospital practised. The evolution and development of medical assistance are inserted and come together with the institutions which managed it and couldn’t be apart from its backs and forwards, from its good economical periods or its major financial difficulties and its internal and external tensions. We had in consideration the local specifications, the measures taken by the local authority, the population features, in order to understand who managed Santa Casa, who took care of the patients and who were the poor interned. At the same time, we have tried to understand the evolutionary lines of medicine and pharmacy throughout these 250 years, in order to integrate Penafiel’s Hospital, showing their improvements or stagnation regarding the European hospital history and, above all, the national hospital history. This hospital analysis also estimated the study of the medicine acquisition methods used for the cure, its production places, mainly, after Santa Casa created its own pharmacy. The pharmacy administration, its relationship with the caretakers and board members, with the chemists, their knowledge, the strengths and weaknesses of its products regarding the existing knowledge at the time, were analysed. The cure of the body couldn’t be possible without the support of the panaceas that rehabilitated them. The observation of a wide time period allowed to understand the evolution, the stagnation periods and the backs and forwards of the hospital assistance provided by the guild, always came together with the guilded life and its constraints and conquests. Medicine’s breakthroughs, royal policies related to care-taking were held in account, because the cure and treatment of patients in Penafiel cannot be analysed without the global vision that inserts itself in evolution and national and European thoughtfulness regarding other peoples’s bodies care. The weight of the soul facing the body in a primary phase of assistance and in a next phase the body facing soul, reflection of the mentalities’s evolution during these 250 years were taken in account. Both of them were part of medical assistance provided by the Hospital evolving accordingly to society and its most pressing needs. The typology of the diseases that worried the population taken into hospital, its characteristics and the ways to be faced, diagnosed and treated, its evolution and ways of facing them were identified wether annual or seasonable in some more preponderant pathologies. We have characterised, in a social and economical way, the employees of Santa Casa serving the Hospital and the Pharmacy, evaluating their relationship with the Guild as workers, as brothers or relatives of the patients, their relationships and presence in municipal functions, making brief study cases, in a way that only by knowing deeply these men we would take knowledge of medicine and the treatments used by them.\n\nFERRAZ, Norberto Tiago GonÃ§alves, Death and the soul salvation in XVIII century Braga, PhD in History: Modern History submitted to the Institute of Social Sciences of the Universidade do Minho, supervised by Maria Marta Lobo de AraÃºjo, 2014 (http://hdl.handle.net/1822/35652)\n\nKeywords: Not available\n\nAbstract: Our work is the result of an investigation done about death in Braga in the XVIII century, making to know the different ways of living it and the way how all the faithful wanted their soulÂ´s salvation. Death implicated two levels of experience: the body one, related to the rituals and procedures to have with the mortal remains of the dead; and the spiritual, in which the importance of soul salvation made a diversified group of individuals and coletivities move, around cultural practices, with the purpose of the entry of souls in Paradise. These two dimensions of the social experience of death were backgrounded, in Modern Age, by the religious preaching of the Catholic Church, which then consacrated Purgatory as an indispensable step of passage for all souls that needed to be purified, before reaching eternal glory. The permanence of souls in this place of expiation and suffering could be shortened, according to theological precepts, through the celebration of religious services, like the masses. The faithful should always follow the comportamental and spiritual rules of the Church, so they could be prepared for the appearance of death. However, when it was plain obvious that oneÂ´s life was at risk, he should demand the presence of a priest to receive the sacraments and the necessary spiritual comfort for his last moments. People hoped that their relatives, friends and neighbours were also present, and could support with their prayers, in order to be welcomed in the after life by God. At the same time the dying one should made his testament, in a way that his material matters were defined, but also to determinate his body destiny and the spiritual help that should take place. The individual delivered himself to God and asked the help of celestial intercessors, for his cause. The care and respect towards the mortal remains for the dead, were fundamental. So, we wanted to present in which way the habitants of the city wanted to see their bodies dressed up and vigilated. The accompaniment of the deceased to their last address was a solemn occasion, to which relatives, friends but also the clergy and the confraternities were called. The parochial and confraternal churches were the main rest places for the deceased, waiting the final judgment. In fact, many confraternities of Braga had an important paper, in the accompaniment of their dead colleagues and other faithful, and in the burial of the deceased. But if the destiny of the body was important, the preoccupation with the salvation of the soul was fundamental. In so, we analised the masses asked by the faithful with this purpose and their reduction in the latest part of the XVIII century. In this particular topic, the local confraternities had an important paper in the spiritual assistance to the souls of their brethrens, determinating the celebration of masses that saw a great growing, on the first half of the XVIII century. These institutions also made themselves as receivers of legacys of perpetual masses, destinated to the salvation of the soul. However, the second half of the XVIII century saw a reduction in the number of legacys received, and a growing confraternal difficulty in the fulfillment of the pious obligations determinated by them, as well. This fact, associated with the reduction of the non perpetual masses, solicitated to be celebrated after the burial, are symptoms of a crisis in the way how the living experience of death and the idea of Purgatory were structured. We also stood our focus on the main places of celebration, analising the relevance of the privileged altars. We also looked to study the characteristics of the clergy elements, particularly those who were at confraternal service and that made possible the regular running of this social-religious sector, as well as their relations, not always peaceful, with the individuals and organizations that they worked for.\n\nFERREIRA, Maria AmÃ©lia Dias, The Help to the Victims of Lisbon Earthquake (1755), PhD in Nursing: History and Philosophy of Nursing submitted to the Institute of Health Sciences of Universidade CatÃ³lica Portuguesa, supervised by Alexandra PatrÃ­cia Lopes Esteves and AmÃ©lia Maria da Fonseca SimÃµes Figueiredo, 2016 (http://hdl.handle.net/10400.14/24087)\n\nKeywords: Not available\n\nAbstract: The conducted study appears in order to meet the rescue of the victims of the earthquake that hit Lisbon on the first day of November 1755. This catastrophic event had devastating effects, with high human and material losses. With the earthquake not only did the earth shook, but also the everyday life, the economy, politics, social relations, values, beliefs and also the attitude towards death or religion. Their impacts were profound and diversified, local and international, immediate or extended in time. For the current study we used a historical methodology, which envisioned a relationship with a set of facts that took place before, during and after the disaster and that allowed us to recover a body of knowledge to add to the picture of the history of relief in Portugal. Considering the research a systematic and rational process of building our knowledge, the research that we carried out was a research foundation that helped support the current history as regards to the relief in exceptional in emergency situations, helping to build solid foundations for the future. The destruction caused by the 1755 earthquake and the need to provide support to needy groups in Lisbon caused the greatest confusion and disorder observed so far. The prompt intervention of the authorities ruthlessly cracking down on looting, the support provided to disadvantaged populations, the treatment of thousands of dead, the implementation of more urgent reorganizational measures of sanitation and the design and reconstruction of the new city of Lisbon, did quickly emerge a creative vision from the installed chaos and apocalyptic extent of the calamity. One of the most interesting dimensions of the phenomenon was the state's reaction and how it called unto it’s responsibility to solve the problems, as it was organized to give a concerted response, ready and extended to earthquake consequences. The actions of the rulers of the time, the circumstances in a state of emergency, developed methods of planning and control of the tragedy, with a view to the future and reconstruction based on a secular view of public affairs management. Hence the speed with which it was set up a \"crisis cabinet\" initiated by the monarch D. JosÃ© but towards which Pombal distinguished. It can be said that in 1755 a new form of management of disasters is initiated, as regards to aid procedures provided to people soon after the occurrence.\n\nFILHO, Wellington Bernardelli Silva, Between Portuguese traditional remedies and Brazilian plants: iatrochemistry, galenism and medicinal flora of Portuguese America of the 18th century in the pharmacopoeias of Friar JoÃ£o de Jesus Maria, PhD in History and Philosophy of Science submitted to the Faculty of Sciences of the Universidade de Lisboa, supervised by Henrique JosÃ© Sampaio Soares de Sousa LeitÃ£o, 2017 (http://hdl.handle.net/10451/34021)\n\nKeywords: Pharmacopoeias Portuguese; History of Pharmacy; Medical Theories; Colonial Drugs; Medical Nature\n\nAbstract: The aim of this study is to analyse the book Pharmacopea Dogmatica (1772) and the manuscript Historia Pharmaceutica das plantas exÃ³ticas (1777), both written by the Benedictine friar JoÃ£o de Jesus Maria (1716-1795). Therefore, the detailed analysis highlights the issues concerning the paradigmatic syncretism of the seventeenth-century Portuguese pharmacy; the conflict between seculars and monastic apothecaries; the direct influence of the apothecary instructions as a mechanical art in the hierarchical, economic and scientific development of the pharmacy; and, finally, the importance of Brazilian drugs in the Portuguese therapeutic arsenal. The main objective of the study is to show how there is an intrinsic relationship between the use and understanding of colonial drugs in the extended survival of Galenic humoral theory in Portugal. It is not the intention to discard the arguments previously advocated by later researches to explain the singularity of the pharmaceutical field during the second half of the eighteenth century. Rather, the intention is to increase the discussion through a study of how was understood and used a substantial part of the Galenic therapeutic arsenal of the time; specifically, how Brazilian drugs played a fundamental role in the survival of Galenic practices in Portugal. Indeed, Jesus Maria’s researches are fundamental sources to verify the role of Brazilian plants in the validity of Galenism among Portuguese apothecaries. This condition is supported by the fact that, in both texts, there was an outstanding presence of Brazilian plants, in addition to a clear intention of the author to reconcile Galenical theory and chemical theory in the daily practice of the apothecary profession.\n\nFONSECA, LuÃ­s JosÃ© Torres FalcÃ£o da, War and Rowing in the Ocean and the Sea: The Galleys in Hispanic Naval Policy (1550-1604), PhD in History: History of the Discoveries and Expansion submitted to the School of Arts and Humanities of the Universidade de Lisboa, supervised by Francisco Contente Domingues, 2013 (http://hdl.handle.net/10451/8419)\n\nKeywords: Not available\n\nAbstract: Not available\n\nFONSECA, Maria AdÃ­lia Bento Fernandes da, The Recollection of Santo AntÃ³nio do Sacramento of Torre de Moncorvo (1661-1814).

To this legitimization underlies the contribution by the women, determinant to the social and moral order. Confronted with this specific contingency, and perceived as a weak and inconstant being who can put such contribution at stake, women stimulate the foundation of institutions of social assistance, such as shelters, promoted in the Modern Era and still visible during the 20th century. Their presence becomes imperative during the Counter Reformation. Founded by archbishops or privately - as is the case in Torre de Moncorvo -, they are, in part, later on, handed over to other institutions, such as Mercy houses. They differentiate from the convents in some aspects, and as an example, for not requiring religious vows. The purpose of these institutions is to regenerate, protect, educate and reintegrate secular women, of any civil condition, or social class. They operate under strict discipline with some strong religious component. The shelter re-establishes the moral and social stability through the normalization of the women’s behavior, guiding their lives, at times when the absence of a masculine guardian deepens their vulnerability. The Shelter of Santo AntÃ³nio do Sacramento, object of our research, fits in this context. Its foundation, in Torre de Moncorvo - seat of an important judicial district during the Old Regime - is the work of Francisca Borges de Menezes, as expressed on her will, signed in Lisbon, in 1661. The benefactor donates the patronage or management of the shelter to the Town Hall, but it is the archbishop of Braga, the higher authority of the diocese, who has the competence to evaluate the virtues of the women, especially humility and modesty, when applying for reclusion. The cloistered women expect that their passage by the shelter be a phase of preparation for the work force or matrimony market, an alternative to the spiritual life, which they can have as a choice. The decline of the shelter in Torre de Moncorvo occurs in the beginning of the 19th century. Along its existence, it fulfills the objectives that guided the foundation of such model of institution for the assistance of women. The reviewed documents allow us to apprehend the importance of its works, which greatly go beyond this town, in spite of the conflict and financial hardship it endures. The Shelter of Santo AntÃ³nio do Sacramento never converted into a convent, even though it was the expectation and wish of the community in general, expressed in multiple occasions.\n\nFRISON, Daniele, The Nagasaki-Macao Trade between 1612 and 1618: Carlo Spinola S.J. Procurator of Japan, PhD in History: Discoveries and Portuguese Expansion History submitted to the School of Social Sciences and Humanities of the Universidade Nova de Lisboa, supervised by JoÃ£o Paulo Oliveira e Costa, 2014 (http://hdl.handle.net/10362/13842)\n\nKeywords: Carlo Spinola; Japan; Macao\n\nAbstract: Our dissertation aims to analyse the commitments and obligations of the procurator of the Society of Jesus in Japan during the years when Carlo Spinola (1564-1622) was chosen to occupy such an important position, the second most important of the province, according to the Italian Jesuit Francesco Pasio. The office of procurator, in fact, was one of the positions which took the missionaries of the Society to deal directly with Japanese authorities in Nagasaki, for it was the procurator who was in charge of receiving, checking and distributing the share of goods belonging to the province loaded in the Portuguese ship from Macao. Furthermore, the procurator, along with other important fathers, had to deal also with political matters regarding the CapitÃ£o-MÃ³r and the Portuguese in the Japanese country. Spinola assumed the office when the bakufuwas changing its attitude towards the Roman Church, owing to several causes which partly involved also the Society of Jesus or which bore negative consequences for the mission. To provide a deep understanding of this office, we propose a comparison between Spinola’s procuratorship and how this office was handled by the most famous procurator in Japan: the Portuguese Father JoÃ£o Rodrigues TÃ§uzu. Furthermore, since Japan represented a unicum within the Portuguese Padroado, we deemed necessary to offer a further example and present also a sketch - although more concise - of the procurator in the Brazilian Province of the Society. Through this case study, we will try to define the procurator both from a practical point of view - i.e. his duties, his commitments, and his resources - and from a moral and philosophical perspective - that is the canonical literature regarding the relationship between the men of the cloth and commerce, which had been producing since the early times of the Christian Church. So far, works about the Society of Jesus and written by the Jesuits themselves had been coping with the office of procurator only marginally. Our work will fill that gap. Moreover, a research about the procurator will inevitably lead us to a better understanding of the mechanics of the participation of the Society in the Macao-Nagasaki trade from its beginning sealed by Alessandro Valignano to its end, which basically corresponded with the end of Spinola’s procuratorship.\n\nGIEBELS, Daniel Norte, The Inquisition of Lisbon.

However, there are a lot of partial studies, usually focused on the object of its repression. The lack of more detailed studies contributes to the uncertainty of the intrinsic dynamics of the inquisitorial macrostructure or even of those existing in fields which the tribunal operated. This study aims therefore to reconstruct the process behind its establishment, the internal organization and the activity of the Lisbon Inquisition since its establishment in 1537, till the last year of the government of Cardinal D. Henrique as the General Inquisitor, in 1579. This study also aims to analyse the evolution of its district court as well as the influence and action of the Lisbon Inquisition on regions that were or were going to be under the jurisdiction of other tribunals. This study gives priority to the analysis of institutional and personal relationships established between this tribunal and other higher powers in the jurisdictional area, with the aim of clarifying the courses of actions followed by the Inquisition during this process of claim in the political, religious and social areas of Portugal in the XVI century. These courses of actions reflected on the human framework, on the investment of infrastructures, on the function of its treasury or its auditorium. The research articulated various points of view, by using the tools of the institutional history and the existing powers, the history of ideas and mentalities, and the socio-economic history. The instruments of micro-history applied to prosopographic studies and to the reconstruction of historical communities were especially valued in this study. This approach allowed the crossing of several frameworks, which the complexity of the subject matter claims, to create finally a wider picture based on the latest and the innovative information of the Inquisition history. This study is based mainly on the documentary funds of the Portuguese Inquisition available at the National Archives of Torre do Tombo, electing as its main source the 2,715 cases that the tribunal of Lisbon held during the period under review, research which distinguishes this work.\n\nGODINHO, Anabela Silva de Deus, Lisbon before the earthquake: the Parish of SÃ©.

This methodology not only made possible the reconstitution of families but also the individual courses and the reconstitution of the parish of the SÃ©. It was also possible to know some demographic behaviour of its population, which was characterized especially by a strong mobility and mortality understandable for the fact of being an urban parish situated near the Lisbon port, in a period that the capital was living golden times, due to the maritime commerce. The professions annotated by the priests on the parochial registers had still allowed us to identify a diversity of occupations and also titles and forms of treatment that placed the individuals in different positions of the social hierarchy. It was also evident the presence of poor people, foreigners and slaves in the parish of the SÃ©.\n\nGOMES, Andreia Maria DurÃ£es, Town Houses: a process of privatization and luxury consumption in the urban middle strata (Lisbon in the second half of the 18th century and beginning of the 19th century), PhD in History: Modern History submitted to the Institute of Social Sciences of the Universidade do Minho, supervised by Isabel dos GuimarÃ£es SÃ¡ and Nuno GonÃ§alo Monteiro, 2018 (http://hdl.handle.net/1822/55979)\n\nKeywords: Not available\n\nAbstract: The attention of Portuguese historians have been polarized around the study of elites and popular groups, paying few attention to sectors of the population that do not fall into these two categories. The main goal of this thesis is to increase knowledge about the composition of the wealth, the houses, and the ways of living and the consumption of the intermediate groups. Throughout the first chapter we examine the use of the expressions \"middle state\", \"middle people\", middle, middle class, in Portugal, mainly during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, when this vocabulary spread out. With this study, we intend to emphasize, on the one hand, the multiplicity of social representation schemes and taxonomies that coexisted during the period under analysis and, on the other hand, to prove that, despite the legal discourse and normative framework, the notion of middle ranks and the visions of society that include it were widespread in Portugal in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. This analysis also seeks to justify our terminological choice. In the second chapter we undertake a discussion of the sociological categories and the model of analysis adopted. We explain why, even considering that in the period and spaces considered the Portuguese society was officially organized into orders and states, we analyse it considering sociological categories that are closer to class than to order or state. Not class in the Marxist sense, but a class that defines itself in a multidimensional space that emphasizes the statute, but also considers the economic aspects. Then we undertake methodological considerations with the analysis of the main historical source used, that is, inventories, highlighting its weaknesses and strengths. The third chapter corresponds to the analysis of the context or, in other words, the geographical, demographic, social, economic and political description of the city of Lisbon, which we chose as the background for the analysis of intermediate groups. In the fourth chapter, we characterize the sample and, in the fifth, we focus on the levels and composition of wealth, and the consumption of the intermediate layers. In the sixth and seventh chapters we launched a multidisciplinary look at houses, at the private interaction space of the intermediate layers, which is first seen as a space of inhabiting and then as a space for consumption. Thus, in the sixth chapter we characterize the habitat of the urban intermediate layers from the point of view of the property regime that linked the families to their houses, its the average value, prevailing typologies, number of floors, areas, number of divisions and functional specialization. In the second part of this chapter, we look at some case studies, trying to integrate the buildings in the city, to kn"
