        "text": "Established in 1933 by Oliveira Salazar, the Portuguese New State was a civil, nationalist, conservative and corporatist dictatorship. A concordat was established between the New State and the Holy See in 1940, yet the treaty did not favour the Catholic Church to the degree one might expect from a Catholic interwar dictator. The fact that the political legitimacy of the Portuguese regime was not dependent on sanctioning by the Holy See justifies this apparent inconsistency. The distinctive features of the Portuguese concordat were enhanced by the authoritarian, rather than totalitarian, nature of the regime. Salazar, more so than Mussolini or Franco, was constrained by political forces not in favour of Catholic privileges. In addition, the dictator himself defended a strict separation of church and state as prescribed by the Portuguese constitution. Nonetheless, Salazar regarded the concordat as an important propaganda instrument that, in association with the 1940 Exhibition of the Portuguese World, would allow the internal and external prestige of the regime to be increased.\n\nThe transition to democracy in Portugal (1974–75) posed, amongst other matters, the problem of constructing a new model for relationships between the state and the Catholic Church. The objective of this article is to analyse the construction of the relationship in that historical period. It examines, in particular, the attitudes of the provisional governments and some military sectors on the one hand, and the Portuguese episcopacy on the other. It also attempts to examine the importance of those relationships in the configuration of the democratic model that was being established in Portugal.\n\nThe visit of Pope Paul VI to Fátima on 13 May 1967 offers revealing insight into the nature of the relations between the Catholic Church and the New State as the regime entered its final years. The background to the visit (i.e. Paul VI&#39;s visit to Bombay in December 1964 and the attribution of the Rosa de Ouro to the Fátima sanctuary in May 1965) provides clear evidence of the collaborative stance adopted by the Portuguese ecclesiastical hierarchy at large in relation to the political imperatives of the regime. As the papal visit unfolded, the Salazar regime succeeded in carrying out a highly effective policy of political appropriation of the event. Paul VI&#39;s visit was effectively utilised to re-affirm the regime&#39;s ideological basis, &#39;legitimise&#39; the colonial wars, and &#39;corner&#39; the political opposition to salazarist rule. The effects of the papal visit upon the domestic Portuguese political scene are revealing of the fundamental role of the Portuguese Cath...\n\nWhat were the means of religious regulation, and more specifically, what were the terms for the institutionalisation of the Catholic Church that the Portuguese authoritarian state adopted? This article adopts a new historiographic interpretation on these questions in order to emphasise both the experience of restructuring the separation and defending the persistence of secularism in the political and cultural debate over the course of the 20th century in Portugal. This argument moves away from the until recently dominant perspective that there was prevailing in Portugal that phenomenon termed “clerical fascism” that some of the literature deems to have been generalised across the dictatorial regimes of Europe between the World Wars.\n\nDuring the 1930s Portugal’s Estado Novo developed an impressive array of activities directed at awakening and maintaining Portugal’s “national pride”, in an attempt to define the new regime’s symbolic ideology and consolidate loyalties. Those intentions were reflected in Portugal’s participation in the main international expositions of the time, and in the successful organization of various national expositions, especially those of 1934, 1937, and 1940. The Catholic Church was featured in some form in all of these historical, economic, and colonial events. The purpose of this article is to analyze this participation and consider how it was useful for the Church. Finally, I will show how this participation was turned by the Estado Novo to its own ends.\n\nIn this paper I analyse the reasons that lead Portugual to send a Jesuit Patriarch to Ethiopia. Such a mission represented a radical break from the tolerant attitude the Lusitans had been showing vis à vis this African Church; the embassies that for decades flowed between Ethiopia and Portugal were suddenly replaced by a one-way attempt of conversion that deeply affected Ethiopian Christian society for more than a century. This mission is placed at the crossroads of both a process of spiritualization that the Portuguese court, under the influence of the Jesuit fathers and the cardinal infantes, endured, and of the political stagnation of the Indian colonial project. But the Catholic Patriarchate would only come to the fore, I contend, at the outcome of the Bermudez affair. This episode, which has largely been underestimated by historiography, was crucial for pushing forward the King João III, the Pope and the Jesuits in the Patriarchal adventure."
