        "text": "In the 19th century, the Catholic religion continued to be the official religion of the State, although with new attacks on religious orders and confiscation of their property and some gains for freedom of conscience and expression and for the private religious freedom of foreigners. In 1910, the republic was proclaimed and religious freedom and the separation of Church and State were decreed, in the midst of new nationalizations of ecclesiastical property. The relations between the Church and the State assumed new points of tension that the Concordat of 1940 tries to attenuate. The freedom of religious confessions made small advances with the 1933 Constitution of the Estado Novo and, later, with the Religious Freedom Law of 1971. But it was after the Carnation Revolution of April 25, 1974, and especially with the promulgation of the 1976 Constitution, that religious freedom and the separation of religious communities from the State were definitively assured. The culmination of this long and tumultuous process is represented by the Religious Freedom Act of 2001 and the Concordat of 2004. Since then, religious freedom, of the majority and minorities, has known broad and effective protection unprecedented in the country's history.\n\nThis aspect must be underlined, due to its importance. There have always been religious minorities in Portugal, such as Jews and Muslims. Over the centuries, due to the circulation of ideas and people, minorities of Protestants, Evangelicals, Adventists, Jehovah's Witnesses or Mormons emerged; it is impossible to mention them all. In the past, when they were not openly persecuted, they could be legally and socially discriminated against. The 2001 Religious Freedom Act radically changed the situation, creating a climate of equal religious freedom and even interreligious solidarity. This is visible, for example, when different religious communities take joint positions on divisive issues such as abortion or euthanasia. The latest census of 2021 shows that Catholics are 80.2% of the population, Orthodox 0.88%, Muslims 0.4%, and Jews 0.033%. On the other hand, in the last 10 years, Evangelicals went from 0.84% to 2.1% of the population, the highest increase ever recorded. The same allows us to conclude that the 2001 law has allowed a true competition of religious ideas, although still bearing only slow and marginal effects.
