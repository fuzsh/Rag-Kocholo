        "text": "An interesting video recently posted narrating the first-hand account of the arrival of Vasco da Gama and the Portuguese in India, written by one of his crewmembers, generally assumed to be Álvaro Velho. I thought the users would appreciate it.\n\nThe video is only part of the account. The \"Journal of Álvaro Velho\" is much longer. And while we're at it, I'll just point out that Velho testified that several crewmates at the time doubted that the Hindus were Christians; quite simply, it was what they had been told they would find, because it was a popular assumption in Europe that Christians inhabited the East, and infact some actually did. They weren't stupid.\n\nIn one book I read that this \"mistake\" was made on purpose. Sponsor of travel, Manuel I of Portugal, wanted not only to found rich trade routes, but also christian allies to make pincer movement against muslims in middle east. Describing hindus as christian was expected to sponsor further travels. How much this is true and how much author assumption is beyond me.\n\nQuite improbable to the point of being almost purely speculative fiction. Portugal wanted to reach India for almost a century, it didn't need that kind of mistake on the moment of the greatest triumph.\n\nOn the other hand, the Portuguese had probably reports that there were Christians in India, if the report of Pêro da Covilhã or others reached Portugal.\n\nThere really isn't any evidence that clarifies whether or not Gama truly believed they were Christians or if he had said it to appease King Manuel. However it should be kept in mind that medieval European understanding of the world had no knowledge of any other religions other than Christianity, Judaism, Islam and \"paganism\" (animism). Since they had information that Christians existed in the East, and the practices of the Hindus were far more sophisticated than those of the \"pagan\" Africans whom the Portuguese already had longstanding trade relations with, they must have assumed they were \"Christians who lost track of proper doctrine due to their isolation\". Marco Polo had already described the Christians of Socotra in this manner in his book. Yet in Calicut some crewmembers doubted it. It would not have been overly important as long as they weren't Muslim, and that the Portuguese could tell they weren't. Since Manuel was that type of ruler who liked being told what he wanted to hear furthermore, I suspect that's why Gama went with that version.\n\nThe confusion was dispelled in 1502, when captain-major Pedro Álvares Cabral met actual Saint Thomas Christians from the community of Cranganor in the Malabar coast, who taught him that there existed an entirely unforseen religion. Hindus were henceforth identified as \"gentiles\". The same designation was applied to Buddhists.\n\nLate Medieval Europe had plenty of legends of Prestor John, a supposed Christian king on the other side of the Islamic lands. Different versions of the legend had Prestor John's kingdom in India, Central Asia, Ethiopia, and perhaps other places. Some of the legends drew upon the 3rd century \"Acts of St Thomas\" (the apostle) who supposedly went to India to spread the Christian message. In 1492 Ferdinand and Isabella included in their instructions to Columbus a line about looking for Prestor John if Columbus made it to India as intended. Why it was so important for da Gama to lie about finding Prestor John's descendants I do not know. Maybe it was just honest confusion.\n\nLate Medieval Europe had plenty of legends of Prestor John, a supposed Christian king on the other side of the Islamic lands.

There isn't much reason to suppose Gama wasn't just working with what information he had.\n\nQuite improbable to the point of being almost purely speculative fiction. Portugal wanted to reach India for almost a century, it didn't need that kind of mistake on the moment of the greatest triumph.\n\nOn the other hand, the Portuguese had probably reports that there were Christians in India, if the report of Pêro da Covilhã or others reached Portugal.\n\nYou as portugese know more, but wasn't these travels and \"Casa de India\" in general expensive, not profitable and subsidized. It means that people who supported these travels needed other than financial reasons to convince king to support it. If I'm wrong, sorry.\n\nYou as portugese know more, but wasn't these travels and \"Casa de India\" in general expensive, not profitable and subsidized. It means that people who supported these travels needed other than financial reasons to convince king to support it. If I'm wrong, sorry.\n\nThe \"Casa da India\" was created after the first voyage.\n\nIn general, the voyages were quite profitable to the point that many ships were from private investors. Besides the spice trading voyages were not the only income.\n\nThe Italian bankers were quite active, since the king didn't had enough capital to finance all the ships in the annual fleets, they invested a lot because it was profitable. But, again, all that was after the first voyage.\n\nWhat diminished the profitability of the Eastern empire was the heavy military structure, the corruption, and… the heavy loss of lives. And much later the piracy and the attacks of the other European powers.\n\nThe king of Portugal didn't had money to subsidized an economic fiasco. To the point that during the reign of D. João III fortress in Morocco were abandoned, since the Moroccan adventure was not profitable.\n\n@Darth Trajan\n\nThere might be a certain confusion as to how the Portuguese voyages east worked, and infact they differed from those of the VOC and EIC chartered companies.\n\nThey were a royal monopoly, meaning only the king could dispatch his own ships paid at his own expenses and commanded by officials selected by him, like Vasco da Gama. Important merchant houses might send their own ships east, but they needed to have been granted that privilege by the king beforehand, hence it wasn't exactly a breach of monopoly, and anyways this practice was halted early on. The Casa da Índia was more or less just in charge of royal logistics and customs. Regardless of losses, both financial, material and human the voyages were always profitable, even if only marginally at the worst of times.\n\nUnlike popular belief, in the early modern period, the highest prize a pirate could dream of capturing wasn't a Spanish galleon, it was a Portuguese indiaman, but close to none ever were (the Madre de Deus by the English and the Santa Catarina by the Dutch being two of very few, if not the only examples)"
