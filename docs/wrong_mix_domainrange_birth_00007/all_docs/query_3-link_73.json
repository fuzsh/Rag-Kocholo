The museum, based at David Lloyd George’s childhood home on the Llŷn Peninsula, is furnished as it was when he lived here between 1864 and 1880.\n\nIn our age of monochrome politicians, step back to the time of this colourful energetic statesman, the ‘third greatest British Prime Minister of the 20th century’."
