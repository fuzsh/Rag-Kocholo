        "text": "Due to its industrial roots, Llanelli is the largest town in West Wales. The town played a hugely important role locally in supplying recruits to all three services, army, navy and air force, during the war, and was home to the 4th Battalion, Welch Regiment, which was the local Territorial infantry unit. Llanelli has many war memorials scattered throughout the churches and chapels of the town, and also in its suburbs, such as in the villages of Furnace, Bynea, New Dock and Felinfoel. As far as I know, there are no names on the main Llanelli War Memorial, so the men and women commemorated on this page have been brought together using information collected from the CWGC database, newspaper archives, and the Army Roll of Honour. As a result there may well be people who are omitted from this list, for which I apologise, as any omission is not intentional.\n\nLlanelli War Memorial WW2\n\nIslwyn Alban, Gunner, 1138909, Royal Artillery.
