He was also treasurer (1865-66) and postmaster-general (1865-66, 1869).\n\nR.T. Stafford\n\nStafford, Robert T(heodore) (b. Aug. 8, 1913, Rutland, Vt. - d. Dec. 23, 2006, Rutland), governor of Vermont (1959-61). Having become state deputy attorney general in 1953, he won his first statewide race in 1954 for attorney general. Two years later he was elected lieutenant governor, and then in 1958 governor. In 1960 he won his first term in the U.S. House of Representatives and continued to win reelection until he was appointed to the Senate in 1971 on the death of Sen. Winston Prouty. Stafford won the special election in 1972 to serve the five years remaining in Prouty's term, and remained in the Senate until his retirement in 1989. As ranking Republican on the Senate's environment committee, he repeatedly defended the Superfund program to clean up contaminated sites and shepherded bills combating acid rain and automobile pollution. In 1988, Congress saluted his dedication to education measures, renaming the Federal Guaranteed Student Loan program the Robert T. Stafford Student Loan program. The low-interest loans came to be known almost universally as Stafford loans to the millions who qualified for them each year. Stafford, who once considered himself conservative, even hawkish, wasn't shy about bucking presidents of his own party. He led a successful effort to override Pres. Ronald Reagan's veto of amendments that strengthened the Clean Water Act, and tangled with industry when he believed it was thwarting efforts to clean the environment.\n\nStagno\n\nStagno (Ugarte), Bruno (b. April 8, 1970, Paris, France), foreign minister of Costa Rica (2006-10). In 2002-06 he was permanent representative to the United Nations.\n\nSt√•hlberg\n\nSt√•hlberg, Kaarlo Juho, originally Carl Johan St√•hlberg (b. Jan. 28, 1865, Suomussalmi, Oulu county, Finland - d. Sept. 22, 1952, Helsinki, Finland), president of Finland (1919-25). He was elected to the Diet in 1904, becoming a leader of the Constitutionalist party. He consistently advocated democratic principles and was among the first to demand universal and equal suffrage. He was a member of the Senate (government) from 1905 until he resigned in 1907. He later served several terms in the newly established unicameral parliament and was elected speaker in 1914. After the end of Russian control, he contributed decisively to the adoption of a republican form of government. His draft constitution of 1917 became the basis of the one adopted in 1919. He was president of Finland's highest administrative court in 1918-19. Leader of the National Progressive Party, he was elected president of the new republic in 1919. He set a precedent of making full use of his constitutional powers. He tried his utmost to conciliate \"Reds\" and \"Whites\" after the Civil War. In 1925 he did not seek reelection as he thought that the right would become reconciled to the republic sooner if he stood aside. In October 1930, he was abducted by fascists in Helsinki who planned to drive him over the Soviet border, but he was released when the automobile ran out of gasoline. He twice came close to being reelected president: in 1931 he was defeated by Pehr Evind Svinhufvud by two votes, and in 1937 he failed by only one vote to obtain a majority in the first round but then finished third in the second round.\n\nStahovitsh, Mihail Aleksandrovitsh, Russian Mikhail Aleksandrovich Stakhovich (b.

April 12, 1961, Honolulu, Hawaii), governor of Hawaii (1942-51).\n\nStainov, Petko (Stoyanov) (b. May 19, 1890, Kazanlak, Bulgaria - d. July 24, 1972, Varna, Bulgaria), foreign minister of Bulgaria (1944-46). He was also minister of railways, posts, and telegraphs (1930-31) and minister to France (1934-35) and Belgium (1934).\n\nStakhovich, Pavel (Aleksandrovich) (b. Jan. 14, 1865 - d. 1930), Russian official; brother of Mihail Aleksandrovitsh Stahovitsh. He was head of the Chief Administration of State Horse Breeding (1915-17).\n\nStakun, Mikhail (Osipovich) (b. 1893, Nedzyany, Vilna province, Russia [now in Lithuania or Belarus] - d.

Dec. 5, 1952, Sofia, Bulgaria), foreign minister of Bulgaria (1997). He was also ambassador to Germany (1991-97) and Turkey (1998-2006).\n\nI. Stalin\n\nStalin, Iosif (Vissarionovich), commonly known in English as Joseph Stalin, original name Iosif Vissarionovich Dzhugashvili (b. Dec. 18 [Dec. 6, O.S.], 18781, Gori, Russia [now in Georgia] - d. March 5, 1953, Kuntsevo [now part of Moscow], Russian S.F.S.R.), Soviet leader. Between 1902 and 1913 he was seven times arrested for revolutionary activity. In 1912 Vladimir Lenin - then in emigration - co-opted him to serve on the first Central Committee of the Bolshevik party. By 1913 he had adopted the name Stalin. In 1913-17 he was exiled to Siberia. He played a secondary role in the October Revolution (1917) and became commissar for nationalities (1917-23) and for state control (or workers' and peasants' inspection; 1919-23). But it was his position as general secretary of the party's Central Committee (from 1922) that provided the power base for his dictatorship. After Lenin's death in 1924, he outmanoeuvred his rivals, especially Lev Trotsky, and became the undisputed leader. He industrialized the Soviet Union, collectivized its agriculture, and consolidated his position by totalitarian methods. In great purges, especially in 1937-38, an astonishing proportion of high party and government leaders and others were executed. In May 1941 he recognized the growing danger of German attack on the Soviet Union by appointing himself chairman of the Council of People's Commissars (premier); it was his first governmental office since 1923. His prewar defensive measures were exposed as incompetent by the German blitzkrieg that surged deep into Soviet territory after the attack of June 22, 1941. But he helped to organize a great counteroffensive; the battle of Stalingrad (1942-43) turned the tide of the war against the Germans, who capitulated in 1945. After the war he extended Soviet control to include a belt of eastern European states. He created a mighty military-industrial complex and transformed the Soviet Union into a superpower.\n\n1 Date fixed by the birth register of the Uspensky church in Gori; Stalin himself maintained that he was born on Dec. 21 (Dec. 9, O.S.), 1879.\n\nM.K.

March 1, 1953, Madras [now Chennai], India), chief minister of Tamil Nadu (2021- ); son of Kalaignar Muthuvel Karunanidhi.\n\nStaliyski, Aleksandur (Aleksandrov) (b. Aug. 4, 1925, Sofia, Bulgaria - d. Jan. 13, 2004, Sofia), defense minister of Bulgaria (1992). His father of the same name served as minister of justice in the government of Ivan Bagrianov between June and September 1944 and was executed after the Communist takeover. The younger Staliyski joined the centre-right Union of Democratic Forces after the fall of the Communist government in 1989. He was elected to parliament in 1991 and served as defense minister from May to December 1992 in a minority government of anti-Communists which was ousted after losing a confidence vote.\n\nStallard, Sir Peter (Hyla Gawne) (b.

Nov. 5, 1936, Brezova village, near Ivanjica, Serbia - d. Aug. 25?, 2000, Fruska Gora mountain, near Novi Sad, Vojvodina, Serbia), Yugoslav politician; nephew of Petar Stambolic. He was president of the Executive Council (1978-82), chairman of the Central Committee of the League of Communists (1984-86), and president of the Presidency (1986-87) of Serbia. He was the political father of Slobodan Milosevic, who ousted him in 1987 over the situation in Kosovo, where ethnic Albanians started demanding more substantial independence of Serbia. Stambolic's backers argued that the crisis in the province should be resolved in a phased manner and through dialogue, and opposed Milosevic's support to Serb nationalism. In 1988 he was appointed president of the Yugoslav Bank for International Economic Cooperation and he remained at its helm until resigning on Oct. 20, 1997. Stambolic, who continued to be critical of Milosevic, disappeared mysteriously on Aug. 25, 2000. Serbian police found his remains on March 27, 2003. It was announced that he was abducted in Kosutnjak Park, Belgrade, taken to the Fruska Gora mountain, killed with two bullets, and then dropped in a hole by Milosevic's elite police Unit for Special Operations (JSO).\n\nStambolic, Petar (b. May 12, 1912, Brezova village, near Ivanjica, Serbia - d. Sept. 21, 2007, Belgrade, Serbia), secretary (1948-57) and chairman (1968) of the Central Committee of the Communist Party/League of Communists, prime minister (1948-53), and president of the National Assembly (1953-57) of Serbia and president of the Federal Assembly (1957-63), of the Federal Executive Council (1963-67), and of the Presidency (1982-83) of Yugoslavia. He was also Yugoslav minister of agriculture and forests (1947-48).\n\nStamboliyski\n\nStamboliyski, Aleksandur (Stoimenov) (b. March 1, 1879, Slavovitsa, Bulgaria - d. June 14, 1923, near Slavovitsa), prime minister of Bulgaria (1919-23). In 1908 he was elected to the National Assembly (Sobranye), where he led the Agrarian Party. He began to organize the peasant masses, who formed 80% of the population of Bulgaria, into agricultural associations. His opposition to King Ferdinand came to a head in 1915 during the negotiations preceding Bulgaria's entry into World War I. He threatened the king with violence if he should fight against the Allies. Ferdinand ordered his arrest, and he was court-martialed and condemned to penal servitude for life. Freed in September 1918 when the resistance of the Bulgarian troops began to crumble, he led an insurrection that resulted in Ferdinand's abdication and flight. Under the new king, Boris III, Stamboliyski became a member of the cabinet in January 1919 and prime minister in October. He then went to Paris to sign the Treaty of Neuilly (November 27), which considerably decreased Bulgaria's territory. He dissolved the Sobranye in February 1920 and his Agrarians won a majority in the March elections. His determination to promote the interests of the peasantry against the bourgeoisie of the capital was expressed in the words: \"Sofia, that Sodom, that Gomorrah, may disappear... I shall not weep for it.\" He made persistent efforts to improve relations with Yugoslavia and concluded an agreement at Nis (1922). His ideal was to establish a South Slav federation embracing Bulgaria. He also advocated a \"Green International\" to unite the peasants of all countries. He won the April 1923 elections overwhelmingly, but bourgeois elements, aided by the military, overthrew him on June 9; he tried to escape but was caught near his village and shot. He had also been minister of public works (1919-20), defense (1919-21), and foreign affairs (1920-23).\n\nStambolov\n\nStambolov, Stefan (Nikolov) (b. Jan. 31, 1854, Turnovo, Ottoman Empire [now Veliko Turnovo, Bulgaria] - d. July 18, 1895, Sofia, Bulgaria), prime minister of Bulgaria (1887-94). Early involved with Bulgarian revolutionary committees, he led an anti-Turkish rising at Nova Zagora in 1875 and organized another at Orekhovitsa in 1876. He fought in the Serbian campaign against Turkey in 1876 and, with a Bulgarian irregular contingent of the Russian forces, in the Russo-Turkish War of 1877-78, as a result of which Bulgaria gained autonomy. Soon elected to the new Bulgarian national assembly (Sobranye), he became its president in 1884. He was instrumental in persuading Prince Aleksandur I to accept the union of Eastern Rumelia with Bulgaria in 1885, despite Russian opposition. When pro-Russian officers abducted Aleksandur in August 1886, Stambolov set up a government loyal to him at Turnovo and his measures led to the downfall of the pro-Russian provisional government at Sofia. On Aleksandur's final abdication (September 1886), Stambolov became head of a regency council and eventually (July 1887) secured the election of Prince Ferdinand of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha to the vacant throne. Under Ferdinand he became prime minister and interior minister in September 1887. His foreign policy was to obtain the recognition of Ferdinand and to win the support of European powers against Russian interference in Bulgaria. He ruthlessly stamped out recurrent plots and armed risings engineered by equally ruthless political opponents who were backed by Pan-Slavist circles in Russia. The growing violence became unbearable to Ferdinand, who, moreover, sought reconciliation with Russia, and he finally forced Stambolov out of office in May 1894. Now exposed to the vengeance of his enemies, Stambolov was brutally assaulted in the streets of Sofia on July 15, 1895, and died three days later.\n\nStamenkovic, Dragi (b. 1920, Leskovac, Yugoslavia [now in Serbia] - d.

Dec. 16, 2003, Ottawa, Ont.), Canadian politician; son of Frank Stanfield. He served on the Wartime Prices and Trade Board in Halifax in 1942-45. In 1947 he became president of the Nova Scotia Progressive Conservative Association, at a time that the party was not represented in the local legislature. He became leader of the provincial party in 1948 and rebuilt its miserable fortunes, eventually forming the government in 1956, ending 23 years of Liberal rule. Taking up the posts of premier, treasurer, and minister of education, he initiated extensive programs for education, health, welfare, and highway construction. He was reelected three times, then resigned in 1967 and was elected national leader of the Progressive Conservatives. He entered the House of Commons in a November 1967 by-election. As opposition leader until 1976 he continuously attacked Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau's economic policies. But his slow way of speaking, which belied his sharp wit, did not translate well onto the national scene. A photograph of him fumbling a football during the 1974 federal election campaign seemed to galvanize public sentiment against him. Stanfield's awkward style contrasted sharply with the dashing, more youthful Trudeau and helped cost the party every election it fought under his leadership (1968, 1972, 1974). He was nevertheless widely seen as \"the best prime minister Canada never had.\" After leaving parliament in 1979 he became chairman of the Institute for Research on Public Policy (1983-87) and of the Commonwealth Foundation (1987-91). In his later years, he was regarded as the conscience of the Conservatives, representing their progressive or \"red\" side on social issues.\n\nStanford, (Amasa) Leland (b.

In 1995, he became a staff member at the foreign affairs department of the Bulgarian Socialist Party, the successor of the Communists. He took the helm of the party in 2001. Under his leadership, it managed to revamp its image, seriously tarnished by its 1994-97 governance that ended in an economic meltdown, and to regain power at the general elections in 2005 after eight years in opposition. With his youthful style, he managed to win the support of younger voters for a party whose traditional voter base was still in rural areas among people over the age of 50. His party came first in the election, but did not win a majority, and he formed a coalition government with the liberal party of former prime minister Simeon Sakskoburggotski and the Movement for Rights and Freedoms, a mainly ethnic Turkish party. He fulfilled his pledges to bring back Bulgaria's 370 troops in Iraq by the end of 2005 and to ensure European Union membership on Jan. 1, 2007. He stood down as party leader in 2014.\n\nStanislaus, Sir Lamuel A(rnold) (b. April 22, 1921, Petite Martinique island, Grenada - d. Sept. 18, 2016, New York City), Grenadian diplomat; knighted 2016. He was permanent representative to the United Nations (1985-90, 1998-2004).\n\nStanislaw I\n\nStanislaw I Leszczynski, original full name Stanislaw Boguslaw Leszczynski h. Wieniawa (b. Oct. 20, 1677, Lw√≥w, Poland [now Lviv, Ukraine] - d. Feb. 23, 1766, Lun√©ville, France), king of Poland (1705-09, 1733-34). In 1702 King Carl XII of Sweden invaded Poland, enforced the deposition of King August II (1704), and then procured the election of Stanislaw to the throne. After the defeat of Carl by the Russians at Poltava (1709), Stanislaw left Poland and settled at Wissembourg, in Alsace, while August II recovered the kingdom. In 1725 Stanislaw's daughter Marie was married to Louis XV of France, and in 1733, after the death of August, France supported his candidature to the Polish throne. He went in disguise to Warsaw and was elected by an overwhelming majority of the Diet. The War of the Polish Succession then broke out, as Russian and Austrian armies entered Poland to annul his election. Thus before he could be crowned, he lost his throne a second time. Under Russian pressure, a small minority in the Diet accepted the Saxon elector Friedrich August II as king of Poland with the style of August III. Stanislaw took refuge in Gdansk (Danzig), which his enemies then besieged. Waiting in vain for French assistance, he fled before the city fell to the Russians. He escaped to K√∂nigsberg, Prussia, whence he directed the guerrilla warfare of his partisans in Poland. The preliminary peace between France and Austria (1735) and the definitive Peace of Vienna (1738) decided that August III was to remain king of Poland but that Stanislaw, retaining his royal titles, was to have the duchies of Lorraine and Bar for life. His court at Lun√©ville became famous as a cultural centre, and he proved himself a good administrator and promoter of economic development.\n\nStanislaw II\n\nStanislaw II August Poniatowski, original full name Stanislaw Antoni Poniatowski h. Ciolek (b. Jan. 17, 1732, Wolczyn, Poland - d. Feb. 12, 1798, St. Petersburg, Russia), king of Poland (1764-95). As an envoy to the Russian court, he gained influence through an affair with the future Russian empress Yekaterina II. With her support, he was elected king following the death of August III in 1763. For Yekaterina, who sought to keep Poland on its course of decline, he seemed a convenient pawn. He tried to strengthen royal power, to modernize the state administration, and to improve the parliamentary system, but his reforms were opposed by a group of magnates and Yekaterina forced him to drop his plans (1768). He was then faced with the Confederation of Bar, a union of nobles opposed to Russian interference, which proclaimed an interregnum (1770), thus making the king even more dependent on Russia. In 1772 Russia, Prussia, and Austria carried out the first partition of Poland, each annexing a portion of Polish territory. A new constitution, seen as a requirement to prevent further national decay, was finally approved by the Sejm (Diet) in May 1791. Russia then invaded and succeeded in crushing the constitutional movement. Stanislaw participated in the captive Sejm at Grodno in 1793, which had to assent to the second partition of Poland, with further loss of territory to Russia and Prussia. He took no firm stand during these upheavals, and in 1794 Tadeusz Kosciuszko led a Polish insurrection, overriding all royal authority. After the Russians defeated the uprising, the third partition of Poland followed in 1795, its entire territory now being annexed by Russia, Prussia, and Austria. Stanislaw abdicated at Grodno on Nov. 25, 1795, and spent the rest of his days in semicaptivity at St. Petersburg.\n\nStanisoara, Mihai (b.

Richard Nixon's commerce secretary (1969-72) and raised more than $60 million - a record - for Nixon's reelection campaign in 1972. But along with the TV ads, balloons, and bunting, the money bought the dirty tricks and outright crimes that eventually brought down the president. Stans was indicted along with former Attorney General John Mitchell on 10 counts of perjury and conspiracy involving a $200,000 contribution from financier Robert Vesco. They were acquitted by a jury. Stans later pleaded guilty to five nonwillful violations of campaign financing laws and paid a $5,000 fine. He said he wanted to avoid the further expense of defending himself, and spent much time in the ensuing decades trying to keep people from lumping him in with the worst of the Watergate conspirators.\n\nStanton, Edwin M(cMasters) (b.

Although he took part in the Munich (Beer Hall) Putsch (1923), he distanced himself from Nazism, objecting to its racial theories. He became provincial leader of the Heimwehr (a paramilitary defense force) in Ober√∂sterreich in 1929, and its national head in September 1930. He was Austrian minister of the interior from September to November 1930, but his Heimatblock (the political arm of the Heimwehr) failed to show electoral strength. He became an admiring disciple of Benito Mussolini, whom he often visited, and by whom the Heimwehr movement was supported and encouraged. Starhemberg stood aloof during the September 1931 coup attempt by the Styrian Heimwehr leader Walter Pfrimer, which was quickly suppressed. Under the chancellorship of Engelbert Dollfuss from 1932, the influence of the Heimwehr steadily increased; Heimwehr leaders successively joined the cabinet till they formed half of it; and on May 1, 1934, Starhemberg became vice chancellor. He had assisted in the formation of the right-wing alliance called the Fatherland Front (Vaterl√§ndische Front) and after the assassination of Dollfuss (July 25, 1934) became its head. It became evident, however, that there was not enough room in Austrian politics for both him and the new chancellor, Kurt Schuschnigg. Dissensions in the Heimwehr gave Schuschnigg the opportunity to expel Starhemberg from the government in May 1936. After the incorporation of Austria into Nazi Germany in March 1938, Starhemberg, who had sought to maintain a fascist but independent Austria, moved to France. In World War II he served briefly in the Free French forces. From 1942 to 1955 he lived in Argentina.\n\nStaribacher, Andreas (b.

He served as a law clerk (1975-77) to Chief Justice Warren Burger, as a counselor to the U.S. attorney general (1981-83), as an appellate judge (1983-89), and as U.S. solicitor general (1989-93). In August 1994 he became independent counsel investigating the pre-White House involvement of Pres. Bill Clinton and his wife Hillary in the Whitewater land development company and the failed Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan in Arkansas. He also investigated the suicide of Vincent Foster, a longtime friend of the Clintons and deputy White House counsel, but the matter was eventually closed. Later, his investigation expanded to Mrs. Clinton's law firm billing records on Madison, which were missing but then turned up in the White House residence. Then, he investigated the firing of workers in the White House travel office (\"Travelgate\") and requests for FBI files on Republicans (\"Filegate\"). His investigations resulted in the convictions, among others, of former Arkansas governor Jim Guy Tucker and former Clinton Whitewater business partners James and Susan McDougal. Finally, Clinton's relationship with Monica Lewinsky consumed Starr's attention. On Sept. 9, 1998, he submitted his report to Congress, finding that Clinton had committed perjury, obstructed justice, tampered with a witness, and abused his power as president. He charged that Clinton had lied under oath about a sexual relationship with former White House intern Lewinsky and had taken steps to cover it up. The investigative activities of Starr, a fervid Republican, were seen by many as politically motivated and an attempt to topple the president over a matter of private rather than public conduct.\n\nStarrin, Karin (Margareta) (b. Oct. 28, 1947), governor of Halland (1997-2004).\n\nStary, Grigory (Ivanovich), original surname Borisov (b. Dec. 9 [Nov. 27, O.S.], 1880, Boziyeni, Bessarabia province, Russia [now in Moldova] - d.

In 1938, at the age of 31, he became the youngest person to be elected governor of Minnesota, and he was reelected in 1940 and 1942. The latter election was Stassen's last successful campaign. He resigned the governorship in April 1943, four months after beginning his third term, and joined the Navy, where he served in the Pacific as assistant chief of staff to Adm. William Halsey. A progressive Republican, he first sought the GOP presidential nomination in 1948 against Thomas Dewey. Four years later he again jumped into the Republican presidential race, facing Dwight D. Eisenhower and conservative Ohio Sen. Robert Taft. Stassen swung the convention to Eisenhower by releasing the Minnesota delegation to him at the end of the first ballot. According to a statement released by his family after his death, Stassen advised Eisenhower not to pick Richard Nixon as his running mate. When Nixon was later elected president, the statement said, Stassen was twice audited by the Internal Revenue Service and both times the government agency found that he had over-paid his taxes. Stassen also sought the Republican presidential nomination in 1964, 1968, 1976, 1980, 1984, 1988, and 1992 - nine times in all, but some of his later attempts at the office were more symbolic than substantive.\n\nStatescu, Eugeniu (b.

He was Scandinavia's first Social Democratic minister (without portfolio, 1916-20) and, after the general election of 1924, became prime minister of Denmark's first Social Democratic government. The monetary reforms of his first administration aggravated depressed conditions in industry and agriculture and led to his defeat in the 1926 elections, but in 1929 he returned to head a Social Democratic-Radical-Liberal coalition. He met the economic crisis of 1931 with far-reaching state intervention in support of agriculture, industry, and the standard of life of the working class; the social reform bill of 1933 established the principle of the needy citizen's right to public support. In international politics he was a staunch adherent of the League of Nations and of cooperation between the Scandinavian countries. He was also minister of industry, commerce, and shipping (1924-26), shipping and fisheries (1929-33), and defense (1933-35).

Elected to the Small Council of Bern in 1774, he was elected Schultheiss (chief magistrate) of the canton in 1787, holding office in 1787-88, 1789-90, 1791-92, 1793-94, 1795-96, and 1797-98. He warned about the threat of revolutionary France and favoured resistance against French intrusions, but the prevailing sentiment in the country was to preserve peace. The French defeat of the Bernese at Grauholz (March 5, 1798) ensured the demise of the old confederation and led to the establishment of the Helvetic Republic under French protection. As he later said, he did not want to survive his fatherland and hoped to find an honourable death with the army. When this plan failed, he intended to organize resistance in the Bernese uplands, but gave up on this too and fled to Bavaria. There he was received by representatives from Prussia and Austria and was given financial support by English agents. Other Swiss √©migr√©s associated with him, and when war broke out in 1799, a Swiss legion of about 600 men joined the Austrians against France; but after initial successes, the French victory near Z√ºrich on September 25 forced a retreat.\n\nStein, (Heinrich Friedrich) Karl Freiherr vom und zum (b. Oct. 26, 1757, Nassau an der Lahn, Nassau [now in Rheinland-Pfalz, Germany] - d. June 29, 1831, Cappenberg castle, Prussia [now in Selm, Nordrhein-Westfalen, Germany]), Prussian statesman; grandson-in-law of George II. Born into a family of the imperial nobility, he entered the service of Prussia in 1780, first in the department of mines and factories, and became head of the Rhenish and Westphalian administrative districts in 1796. He was named minister with a broad economic portfolio in October 1804 and began far-reaching reforms. Dismissed in January 1807 for his attempts to increase the power of the heads of the ministries, he was recalled in October 1807 as minister of state after Prussia's defeat by the French, only to be dismissed again in November 1808 on the demand of Napol√©on I. In his few years in office he abolished the last relics of serfdom, created peasant proprietors, extirpated monopolies and hindrances to free trade, promoted municipal government, and supported Gerhard von Scharnhorst in his schemes of army reform. He transformed Prussia into a modern state and enabled it to play its leading role in the eventual unification of Germany. After Napol√©on declared him a public enemy (December 1808), he withdrew to Austria and in 1812 he went to St. Petersburg, becoming personal counselor to Emperor Aleksandr I and building up the coalition against Napol√©on. He was president of the Central Administration Council (1813-15), a transitional body in the period between the dissolution of the Rhine Confederation and the formation of the German Confederation. His hopes for a united Germany were disappointed at the Congress of Vienna, and his role after 1815, when Prussia turned to reaction, was not prominent. In 1819 he laid the foundation for the Monumenta Germaniae Historica, an edition of national historical documents.\n\nE. Stein\n\nStein Barillas, Eduardo (b.

April 23, 1995, Jackson, Miss.), U.S. politician. A Democrat, he was elected to the Mississippi legislature in 1928. He then served as a district attorney (1932-37) and circuit judge (1937-47) before winning the U.S. Senate seat left vacant by the death of Theodore G. Bilbo. The longtime senator (1947-89) wielded great power over military policy, serving as chairman of both the Armed Services Committee and the defense subcommittee of the Appropriations Committee in the 1970s. After becoming Armed Services chairman in 1969, he firmly supported Pres. Richard Nixon's requests to extend the Vietnam War. In the war's waning days, he co-sponsored the War Powers Act of 1973, which set limits on a president's power to commit American forces to combat without congressional consent. But a decade later, he opposed forcing Pres. Ronald Reagan to abide by the law in order to keep Marine peacekeepers in Lebanon. Although he never made racial issues his primary focus in the Senate, he did support segregation and was a staunch member of the Southern wing of his party. He condemned the Supreme Court's 1954 school desegregation decision and opposed virtually all civil rights legislation, although in 1983 he voted for an extension of the Voting Rights Act. Nicknamed the \"conscience of the Senate\" for his work on the Senate's ethics code, he was viewed by many as a symbol of integrity and was often selected to head sensitive inquiries. During the final years of his tenure he became a mentor to junior senators.\n\nStenroth, Otto (Eliel) (b. May 13, 1861, Saarij√§rvi, Finland - d.

He was also Soviet ambassador to Finland (1973-79) and first deputy premier of the Karelian A.S.S.R. (1979-84).\n\nStepashin\n\nStepashin, Sergey (Vadimovich) (b. March 2, 1952, at the then Soviet military base of Port Arthur, China), prime minister of Russia (1999). He joined the Interior Ministry troops in 1973 as \"politrabotnik\" - a member of the Communist Party watchdog corps in Soviet power structures. Under the perestroika reforms started by Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, he ran for parliament, where he joined the liberal camp. He spent some time in the Supreme Soviet as the head of its security committee before establishing himself in the security service, which changed names several times during his stay. He was one of the few security ministry officials left in place after an abortive attempt by the parliament to depose Pres. Boris Yeltsin in 1993. In March 1994 he became the head of the new Federal Security Service (FSB). In his most prominent role, Stepashin was a loyal hawk during the catastrophic war in breakaway Chechnya. He resigned after a bloody Chechen hostage-taking raid on the southern Russian town of Budyonnovsk in June 1995. He later made a quiet comeback as a Kremlin aide, taking part in negotiations with the Chechens. In 1997 Yeltsin gave him a second chance, appointing him justice minister. Stepashin oversaw the transfer of Russia's notoriously overcrowded prisons from the Interior Ministry and pledged to bring prison conditions up to European standards. Yeltsin appointed Stepashin interior minister in March 1998. Stepashin again had to face problems over Chechnya; Chechen criminal gangs living off hostage-taking kidnapped senior Russian officials, foreigners, and ordinary Russians in and around the turbulent region. In 1999 Yeltsin elevated him to the post of first deputy prime minister, and soon afterwards to prime minister, but he lasted only three months. He was chairman of the Audit Chamber in 2000-13.\n\nStephan, L√©opold Fran√ßois (b. Oct. 14, 1815, Brest, France - d. ...), acting governor of Senegal (1861).\n\nK. Stephanopoulos\n\nStephanopoulos, Kostis, byname of Konstantinos (Dimitriou) Stephanopoulos (b. Aug. 15, 1926, Patras, Greece - d. Nov. 20, 2016, Athens, Greece), president of Greece (1995-2005). He first entered parliament in 1964 with the conservative National Radical Union. During the 1967-74 military dictatorship, the lawyer defended students accused of anti-government activities. Later he was a member of the New Democracy party and served as minister of interior (1974-76) and social services (1976-77) and minister to the presidency of the government (1977-81) in New Democracy governments. He deserted the party in 1985 after losing a leadership contest and formed a splinter group called Democratic Renewal. Support for that party sank, and it eventually disbanded in 1994. But he remained a respected figure and was elected president in 1995. On Feb. 8, 2000, the Greek parliament overwhelmingly voted to reelect Stephanopoulos, granting the man who was probably Greece's most popular politician a second five-year term. He became the first president to be elected to two consecutive terms since the collapse of the dictatorship in 1974. Both the governing Socialists and opposition conservatives voted to return him to the largely symbolic office. He received 269 votes in the 300-member unicameral parliament - the largest number any president has captured in a presidential election since the dictatorship. Stephanopoulos had seen his approval rating rise above 70% in opinions polls.\n\nStephanopoulos, Stephanos (Christou) (b. 1898, Pyrgos, Greece - d. Oct. 4, 1982, Athens, Greece), prime minister of Greece (1965-66). He joined parliament in 1930 as a deputy for the Populist Party. He was minister of economy (1934-35), transport (1944-45), finance (1946), labour (provisional, 1946), supply (provisional, 1946), coordination (1946-47, 1947, 1947-50, 1950, 1964-65), foreign affairs (1952-55 and [acting] 1966), a deputy prime minister (1954-55, 1963, 1964-65), and a minister without portfolio (1963, 1964). He took part in the resistance to German occupation during World War II. In 1951 he defected from the People's Party and helped set up a right-wing splinter party which soon merged into Alexandros Papagos's Greek Rally; when this won the 1952 elections, he became foreign minister. In 1961 he helped form the Centre Union Party under Georgios Papandreou but defected in 1965 to become prime minister. His government was never stable and eventually fell in a deteriorating political situation that culminated in a 1967 military coup. After the return of democracy Stephanopoulos set up the right-wing National Rally, but he failed to win reelection in 1977 and the party collapsed.\n\nStephen, Sir Alfred (b. Aug. 20, 1802, Basseterre, St. Kitts - d. Oct. 15, 1894, Sydney, N.S.W.), acting governor of New South Wales (1872, 1879, 1885, 1890-91); knighted 1846. He was chief justice (1844-73) and lieutenant governor (1875-91).\n\nM. Stephen\n\nStephen, Marcus (Ajemada) (b. Oct. 1, 1969), president of Nauru (2007-11). A former professional weightlifter and Olympian who won seven Commonwealth Games gold medals, he was elected to parliament in 2003. He has also been minister of finance (2003), education (2003), island development and industry (2004), and commerce, industry, and environment (2012-13) and speaker of parliament (2019- ).\n\nN. Stephen\n\nStephen, Sir Ninian (Martin) (b. June 15, 1923, near Oxford, England - d. Oct. 29, 2017, Melbourne, Vic.), governor-general of Australia (1982-89). During World War II he served in the Australian Army (1941-46). A queen's counsel from 1966, he was appointed a judge of the Victoria Supreme Court in 1970 and elevated in 1972 to the Australian High Court bench. He was knighted in 1972. Stephen's hopes that his appointment as governor-general would be untainted by public controversy were soon dashed. Since Sir John Kerr sacked Gough Whitlam's Australian Labor Party administration in 1975, the governor-general had been regarded as fair game for journalists. Stephen was quickly confronted by a press demanding to know why his daughter had been arrested, while working as a journalist for the Communist newspaper Tribune, during Aboriginal land rights demonstrations at the time of the 1982 Commonwealth Games in Brisbane. After leaving the post, he served in various international roles.

During World War II he served parishes in the Ternopil and Stanislaviv regions (today Ivano-Frankivsk). The church was outlawed in 1946 and absorbed by the Russian Orthodox Church in what today is commonly referred to as an illegal synod of bishops. In the months after the church was banned, he and thousands of other clergy and faithful were arrested and imprisoned or exiled. He spent five years imprisoned in Arkhangelsk region near the Siberian city of Yertsevo, after which he returned to Pustomyty. There he worked at various menial jobs, including watchman, sanitation worker, and medic, all the while maintaining his status as a clergyman in the underground church. He was secretly consecrated a bishop in 1967 by Archbishop Vasyl Velychkovsky. In 1972 the exiled metropolitan Josyf Cardinal Slipy appointed him locum tenens (one who maintains the position) and senior bishop of the Kyiv-Halych Metropolis - in fact naming him the guardian of the underground church that survived the massive Soviet arrests of clergy and laity, a position he maintained until 1991, when the leader of the church, Myroslav Ivan Cardinal Lubachivsky, returned to officially take his seat in Lviv.\n\nSterry, Sir Wasey (b.

Oct. 31, 1949, Greenwich, Conn.), U.S. secretary of state (1944-45). Having been a vice president of General Motors and chairman of the board of U.S. Steel, he entered government service in 1939 as chairman of the War Resources Board, chaired the National Defense Advisory Commission in 1940, became director of priorities at the Office of Production Management in 1941, and later that year replaced Harry Hopkins as lend-lease administrator. In 1943 Pres. Franklin D. Roosevelt appointed Stettinius undersecretary of state, and the next year he succeeded the ailing Cordell Hull as full secretary of the department. At 44 he was one of the youngest persons ever to have held this position. He dealt effectively with the administrative functions of his post and soundly implemented, but played only a minor role in formulating, Roosevelt's foreign-policy decisions. He was, however, one of Roosevelt's chief advisers at the 1945 Yalta Conference. A firm believer in a postwar international organization, he played a principal role in the Dumbarton Oaks meetings of 1944 that laid the groundwork for the United Nations and in 1945 he headed the U.S. delegation to the San Francisco Conference, which drafted the UN Charter. Two months after Roosevelt's death, Pres. Harry S. Truman appointed James F. Byrnes as secretary of state to replace Stettinius, who then became the first U.S. delegate to the UN (1945-46).\n\nSteunenberg, Frank (b. Aug. 8, 1861, Keokuk, Iowa - d.

March 25, 1818, near Andover, Mass. - d. [in civil war] Sept. 1, 1862, Chantilly, Va.), governor of Washington (1853-57).\n\nStevens, (Moli) Jimmy (Tubou Patuntun) (b. June 15, 1927 - d. Feb. 28, 1994, Fanafo, Vanuatu), New Hebrides (Vanuatu) rebel leader. Born of mixed European-Islander descent, he had the ability to articulate the grievances of ordinary villagers. In the early 1960s he joined a small group of Esp√≠ritu Santo islanders opposing the encroachment of a cattle industry into \"dark bush land.\" They called their movement Nagriamel (after two plants, nagaria and namele), and by 1970 it had a large following (he claimed 10,000). It rejected colonial control over New Hebridean land, championed \"custom,\" and repudiated many of the highly suspect land sales of the early colonial period. In the 1970s the anticolonial initiative passed from Stevens to the Vanua'aku Party under Walter Lini. Stevens found himself heading a regional movement that was increasingly allied with pro-French and pro-settler groups opposed to decolonization and to the anglophone groups that dominated the new government. He was encouraged (and funded) by them and also by U.S. business interests that had invested heavily and speculatively in land. For example, the Phoenix Foundation, a group of libertarian U.S. businessmen hoping for a tax haven and a free hand in commercial development, backed Stevens and provided a constitution for his Vemarana (after a traditional Santo name) secessionist government launched on the eve of Vanuatu's independence (1980). French settlers imported arms through New Caledonia and drilled Stevens's force of bow-and-arrow-wielding tribesmen. But within a month of independence, Fanafo village, his headquarters, fell to Papua New Guinea troops called in by the new Vanuatu government. He was arrested and put on trial and on November 21 was sentenced to 14¬Ω years' imprisonment. He was released in 1991.\n\nR.L. Stevens\n\nStevens, Roger L(acey) (b. March 12, 1910, Detroit, Mich. - d. Feb. 2, 1998, Washington, D.C.), chairman of the National Endowment for the Arts (1965-69).\n\nStevens, Samuel, Jr. (b. July 13, 1778, Talbot county, Md. - d. Feb. 7, 1860, near Trappe, Talbot county), governor of Maryland (1822-26).\n\nS. Stevens\n\nStevens, Siaka (Probyn) (b. Aug. 24, 1905, Moyamba, Sierra Leone - d. May 29, 1988, Freetown, Sierra Leone), prime minister (1967, 1968-71) and president (1971-85) of Sierra Leone. He helped to found the United Mineworkers Union in 1943 and served as its general secretary for 15 years. In 1951 he was elected to the Protectorate Assembly, representing the Sierra Leone People's Party, and after the granting of internal self-government in 1952 he became minister of lands, mines, and labour. After serving as secretary-general and deputy leader of the breakaway People's National Party (1958-60), he formed the All People's Congress (APC). After independence in April 1961 he led the parliamentary opposition and also served as mayor of Freetown (1964-66). The APC won the 1967 election, but he was overthrown in a military coup only minutes after being sworn in as prime minister. He was recalled from exile in Guinea after another coup 13 months later. He survived coup attempts in October 1970 and March 1971 and requested troops from Guinea to quell the protests surrounding his installation as president in April 1971, when Sierra Leone became a republic. After being returned for a new term of office in 1976, he won support for his plan to turn Sierra Leone into a one-party state, for which the necessary legislation was passed in 1978. He presided over the Organization of African Unity's summit meeting in Freetown in July 1980 and was elected OAU chairman for 1980-81. He survived in office despite a burdensome national debt and charges of gross mismanagement and governmental corruption. He voluntarily relinquished power in 1985 in favour of his hand-picked successor, Joseph Saidu Momoh, but in 1987 he was put under house arrest for alleged involvement in a coup plot.\n\nStevens, Thaddeus (b. April 4, 1792, Danville, Vt. - d. Aug. 11, 1868, Washington, D.C.), U.S. politician. He first achieved political prominence as an Anti-Mason and in 1833-42 served intermittently in the Pennsylvania legislature. An aggressive, uncompromising man possessing a formidable, sardonic wit, he helped defeat a bill abolishing the state's public school system and was a vigorous proponent of a protective tariff. He became a dominant member of the U.S. House of Representatives (1849-53, 1859-68). A Whig in his first two terms, he quit in disgust at the party's moderate stand on the slavery issue. Returning as a Republican in 1859, he became chairman of the Committee on Ways and Means. He secured huge appropriations for the Union forces during the Civil War (1861-65). A firm believer in equality, he was a leader of the Radical Republicans during Reconstruction, arguing that Pres. Andrew Johnson's policies were too moderate and that the Southern states should be seen as \"conquered provinces.\" He proposed the Fourteenth Amendment and sponsored Reconstruction measures which used military rule to guarantee black suffrage in the South. He also introduced the resolution to impeach Johnson in 1868. However, his plan for the confiscation of southern plantations to be divided among freedmen failed to gain congressional support.\n\nStevenson\n\n(1835-1914)\n\nStevenson, Adlai E(wing) (b. Oct. 23, 1835, Christian county, Ky. - d. June 14, 1914, Chicago, Ill.), vice president of the United States (1893-97); cousin of Charles C. and Edward A. Stevenson. Present at the historic Lincoln-Douglas debates during the Illinois senatorial campaign of 1858, he was stimulated to get involved in politics and was appointed to his first public office as a master in chancery (an aide in a court of equity) in 1860. In 1864 he was elected district attorney. Serving two terms in the U.S. House of Representatives (1875-77, 1879-81), he stood for low tariffs and a soft-money policy; he also took a conspicuous part in the congressional debate protesting the manner of settlement in the disputed presidential election of 1876. During Grover Cleveland's first term as president (1885-89), Stevenson served as first assistant postmaster general and was entrusted with the task of removing some 40,000 Republican postmasters and replacing them with Democrats. Upon Cleveland's renomination in 1892, Stevenson was selected as vice presidential candidate. After leaving office in 1897, he was sent to Europe by Pres. William McKinley as member of a commission which sought in vain to promote international bimetallism. He was again nominated for vice president on the ticket with William Jennings Bryan in 1900, and was also unsuccessful as the Democratic candidate for governor of Illinois in 1908.\n\nStevenson\n\n(1900-1965)\n\nStevenson, Adlai E(wing) (b. Feb. 5, 1900, Los Angeles, Calif. - d. July 14, 1965, London, England), U.S. politician; grandson of Adlai E. Stevenson (1835-1914). He began his political career as a special counsel to the Agricultural Adjustment Administration in the 1930s. He headed the Civil Rights Committee of the Chicago Bar Association, battled isolationism as a leader in the Committee to Defend America by Aiding the Allies, and in 1941-44 was special assistant to the U.S. secretary of the navy. In 1945 he became assistant to the secretary of state and participated in the San Francisco Conference that founded the United Nations. He then became a U.S. delegate at the UN General Assembly (1946-47). In 1948 he was elected governor of Illinois by a sweeping majority, but this remained his only victory at the polls. His distinguished record as governor aroused interest in him as a Democratic presidential candidate. Although he preferred to serve a second term as governor, he was drafted by the Democratic National Convention in 1952. He then waged a vigorous campaign, but with his earnest speeches, which avoided offering easy solutions to problems, he could not overcome the personal appeal of his Republican opponent, wartime hero Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower. In 1956 he was again his party's nominee and was again defeated by Eisenhower. He nevertheless was admired by many and remembered for his eloquence and wit (one story goes that, when a woman called out to him \"You have the vote of every thinking person,\" he replied: \"That's not enough, madam, we need a majority!\"). He did not rule out accepting the Democratic nomination a third time in 1960, but it went to John F. Kennedy. Kennedy won the election, and in 1961 Stevenson became U.S. ambassador to the UN, with cabinet rank; he served until his death.\n\nStevenson\n\n(1930-2021)\n\nStevenson, Adlai E(wing), III (b. Oct. 10, 1930, Chicago, Ill. - d. Sept. 6, 2021, Chicago), U.S. politician; son of Adlai E. Stevenson (1900-1965). The Democrat served in the Illinois state legislature (1965-67) and as state treasurer (1967-70). He was U.S. senator from Illinois (1970-81), being first elected to fill the unexpired term caused by the death of Sen. Everett Dirksen and reelected in 1974, but not running for reelection in 1980. He was an unsuccessful candidate for governor of Illinois in 1982 and 1986.\n\nStevenson, Andrew (b. March 23, 1784, St. Mark's parish, Culpeper county, Va. - d.
