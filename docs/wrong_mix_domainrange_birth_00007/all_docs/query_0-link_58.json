Museum of Art - Verbal American Landscape circa 1962-1966\n\nScope and Contents\n\nPrior to the formation of USCO, Stern produced a series of \"poem-sculptures\" evocative of traffic signs which incorporated light, sound and primitive electronics. In the process of developing the piece \"Contact Is the Only Love,\" which was to be shown at the San Francisco Museum of Art, director George Culler offered the use of the museum's auditorium for a fundraising event. With the help of his friend Judy McBean, who had first-rate contacts in San Francisco society, and patron Hal Babbitt, who was an executive at Kaiser, a two-night multi-media project gradually came together that included \"Live Public Figures, Tape, Telephone, Television, Projected Images ... From the Verbal American Landscape\" according to publicity.\n\nThe event was titled \"Who R U?\" for November 7th and \"What's Happening\" on November 12th, 1963. Among the invitees (many of whom declined): Michael McClure, Imogen Cunningham, Hans von Briesen, Rene di Rosa, Dr. Richard Prest, Allen Ginsberg, Jake Ehrlich, Jessica Mitford, Cyril Magnin, Richard Rubacher, Jeremy Ets-Hokin, Assemblyman Jesse Unruh, Governor Edmund Brown, Mayor Harold Dobbs, Congressman John Shelley, and Lt. Governor Glenn Anderson. Also involved in the production were painter Ivan Majdrakoff, sociologist Howard Becker, and the San Francisco Tape Music Center, especially its young engineer Michael Callahan, who with Stern and Stephen Durkee would form an early core group of USCO. In fact, these events were considered studies for the kind of multi-sensory environments USCO became known for with the touring \"Verbal American Landscape\" series.\n\nClippings about these events have been filed with USCO. More correspondence with participants and others involved can also be found elsewhere.\n\nSan Francisco Museum of Art - Who R U?/Contact is the Only Love flier & PR\n\nSan Francisco Museum of Art - Who R U? correspondence\n\nSan Francisco Museum of Art - Who R U?
