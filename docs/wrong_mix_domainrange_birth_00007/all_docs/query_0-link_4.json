The repertoire is round and the music brilliant. Also, it contains the best Lovano we’ve heard on a record in recent times, and that’s no small thing.” – El Pais (ES)\n\n★★★★: “Much more than a tribute, Once Around The Room captures Motian’s spirit and walks with it to a performance that has a compelling sense of vibrant celebration as well as solemn recognition of greatness.” – Jazzwise (UK)\n\nFootage from \"Music For Black Pigeons\" by Jørgen Leth and Andreas Koefoed.\".",
