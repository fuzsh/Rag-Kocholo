        "text": "Gwilym and Megan Lloyd George were brought up in a family in which by virtue of their father’s successful political career their multiple national identities were fully apparent to them. David Lloyd George had utilized his Welshness to strengthen his position in British Liberalism, and then as Prime Minister during the First World War and its aftermath had established himself as a world statesman, although one who represented British interests. The Lloyd George name was Welsh and instantly recognizable. Lloyd George was celebrated as the ‘Welsh wizard’ and criticized as the ‘Welsh goat’.1 Politics was seen as a natural occupation for the Lloyd George children. Megan remarked in a speech in 1928 that ‘I’ve had politics for breakfast, lunch, tea and dinner all my life.’2 With their father being appointed Chancellor of the Exchequer in 1908, the children found the family home coincided exactly with the centre of power of the United Kingdom and its Empire in Downing Street. Despite this British context, the Lloyd George family did retain its Welshness, not least through the deliberate and conscious actions of Margaret Lloyd George, the children’s mother. Richard, the oldest son of the Lloyd Georges, wrote of his mother that ‘her love of Wales and everything Welsh was so great as to have left an indelible imprint on all her children’.3"
