Biography[]

Lloyd George took office on 7 December 1916. The Liberal MP for Caernarvon had served as President of the Board of Trade, Chancellor of the Exchequer, Minister of Munitions and Secretary of State for War before heading the coalition government that led the country through the second half of the First World War. Lloyd George was an aggressive campaigner against alcohol, famously declaring that Britain had three enemies: "Germany, Austria and Drink; as far as I can see, the greatest of these three deadly foes is Drink." His attempt, as Chancellor, to ban alcohol entirely led to the introduction of licensing laws to increase taxes on alcohol and to restrict its sale and the opening hours of public houses.

In private, however, (PROSE: The Time Traveller's Almanac) the Ninth Doctor once said that Lloyd George used to drink him under the table. (TV: Aliens of London) The Tenth Doctor also made reference to an incident at a party involving himself, H. H. Asquith, Lloyd George (who he referred to as "Dave the Rave"), and a bottle of soda water. (PROSE: Sting of the Zygons)
