While producers have confirmed both the Adele and anniversary-tribute aspects of the program, there’s been no word on a possible reunion—not exactly a surprise, since, as Entertainment Weekly notes, Academy Awards tributes are usually kept under wraps until the show.",

While producers have confirmed both the Adele and anniversary-tribute aspects of the program, there’s been no word on a possible reunion—not exactly a surprise, since, as Entertainment Weekly notes, Academy Awards tributes are usually kept under wraps until the show.\n\nIn spite of James Bond’s seniority in the film industry, the Academy still neglected to pay tribute to him in one major way: by recognizing him in a top-line category. While Skyfall earned five nominations (for cinematography, sound editing, sound mixing, original score, and original song), it has failed to break the Bond curse in the best-picture and best-actor categories. Connery, Lazenby, Moore, Dalton, Brosnan, and Craig may convene to lament their respective Academy snubs at this year’s Oscars, which will air on ABC.\n\nCelebrity\n\nChasing James Baldwin’s Shadow in the South of France\n\nIt is the centenary of my literary hero.

But now he’s out and Trumpworld can’t seem to figure out how to hit Harris besides warmed-over racist and sexist insults.\n\nHollywood\n\nThe Real Reason Matt Damon Loves Working With Casey Affleck\n\n“You need to get every idea out,” says the star of The Instigators, in a joint interview with Affleck. “You get there a lot faster if you’re not worried about people’s feelings. So, in other words, we talk a lot of shit to each other.”\n\nTelevision\n\nBill O’Reilly and Jon Stewart Reunite After a Decade for On-Air Battle\n\nFor the first Daily Show episode since the attempt on Trump’s life, Stewart invited an old sparring partner back into the ring to discuss this “terrible fucking week.”\n\nNews\n\nWhat Kamala Harris Means for Democrats’ Chances in Battleground States\n\n“She’s been like a defibrillator to the Democratic Party in this race.”\n\nStyle\n\nSabrina Ionescu on Lessons From Kobe Bryant, the Pain of Brittney Griner’s Ordeal, and Her Olympic Debut\n\nThe WNBA star talks about life, hoops, and the Olympics.\n\nPolitics\n\nJ.D.
