        "text": "In July 1987, shortly after the film had already launched in Europe, Timothy Dalton made his first appearance on ABC televisions's 'Good Morning America' show to introduce himself to the U.S. as the new James Bond and promote the 15th film in the series: \"The Living Daylights\". In the brief interview, Dalton said he turned down the role in 1971 because he was \"too young\" for it, and because of the imposing legacy of Sean Connery. Dalton was approached by Broccoli again in 1982, when it looked like Moore was going to resist playing Bond again in \"Octopussy\" (1983).\n\nShare The Story"
