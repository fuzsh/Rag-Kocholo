        "text": "Timothy Dalton is not only a long standing and much respected actor, he is also one of the few men lucky enough to call themselves Bond. Best known for his appearance as the fourth face of the iconic character James Bond, Dalton starred in two films for the franchise, The Living Daylights in 1987 and Licence to Kill two years later. He is also a prominent performer in many huge blockbusters, including the cult classic Flash Gordon in 1980, the Rocketeer in 1991, Looney Tunes: Back In Action in 2003, and as the hilariously evil Simon Skinner in the Simon Pegg classic comedy Hot Fuzz in 2007. On the small screen, Dalton has been equally prolific and successful, featuring as Mr Rochester in the 1983 version of Jane Eyre, Rhett Butler in Scarlett, which broke records with its ratings all over the world, and more recently, Sir Malcolm Murray in Penny Dreadful alongside Billie Piper and Eva Green in 2014, and the Chief in Doom Patrol, first airing in 2019.\n\nWith a penchant for appearing in period or costume dramas that featured him in either a powerful or royal role, Dalton became known for his huge presence onscreen, but has also scored an impressive career in theatre, working with the Royal Shakespeare Company and the Prospect Theatre Company, completing global tours with both while playing lead roles in Romeo And Juliet, King Lear, Love’s Labours Lost and many more. He’s worked alongside huge names, including Anthony Hopkins, Sylvester McCoy, Vanessa Redgrave, Daniel Craig, and David Tennant among many others, yet remains one of cinema’s most underappreciated gems."
