        "text": "Do dance classes - I know that sounds stupid, but one of the most important things is to be aware of your body. In a great way, not a 'I hate my body' way. Feeling the floor beneath you, dance helps with that. And it stops you being physically awkward, and helps you to take the piss out of yourself. Clowning is really important. And don't make acting a bloodsport because it will destroy you - find stories you feel affected by and don't make it remotely competitive.\n\nAs actors, it was pretty upsetting too. But I think in a way it sort of worked - everyone's story got tied up, and no-one was expecting it to be the end. So they sort of won in every way. It was just very sudden. I don't think I'd be able to keep it together if I shared a scene with Timothy - he makes me laugh so much. The twinkle in that man's eye is terrifying. He's one of the funniest people I've ever met. There's nothing better than seeing him stroll through Dublin in a hoodie - he dresses like a teenager, he really does, and it's the same outfit all the time. He's so handsome as well, my mum almost collapsed when she met him.\n\nThey are two totally different experiences. Because for the fans of Doctor Who, they're in love with Rose, they love what she stands for and represents. And with music, it was more a personality-based thing. I love Doctor Who fans. But the worlds collide sometimes. I meet fans of Doctor Who now who were named Rose when they were born - it's terrifying! It was ten years ago. I've met a few Billies too...\n\nThe way we're making it is very different to what I'm used to. We started with three scenes on day one, and that's really terrifying. The director and writer is writing it as we go, and that can be unsettling at times, but he likes to see things happen for the first time all the time. Normally you're drilling your body into perfection with a performance on stage, and I think he's more interested in the imperfections. Which is great for him, and terrifying for us.\n\nI'm still getting into it, so it's not totally established yet, but I feel like I can access it. I know a lot of people who are in this world at the moment, and I know what it means to have a child so the reverse of that would be awful. In that sense, I don't find being a mother is affecting getting in there and understanding it. We've also spent a lot of time talking to people other than friends who have a treacherous fertility past - five minutes with those guys you know what's going on. It's awful - but there are success stories. But not for our Yerma...\n\nYes, I would love to play Lady Macbeth. I would like a modern adaptation - I'd be terrified about how I would bring something new to it, but it's my favourite Shakespeare play, so it would be a gift of a role. It's just a very, very tasty story. It's deep, isn't it? I don't know how to be articulate about it - it's just got everything you want in a tale."
