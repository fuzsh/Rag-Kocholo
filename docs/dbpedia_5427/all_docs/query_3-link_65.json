        "text": "Timothy Dalton may very well be one of the last of the dying breed of swashbuckling, classically trained Shakespearean actors who have forged simultaneous successful careers in theater, television and film. He has been comparison-shopped roundly for stepping into roles played by other actors, first following Sir Laurence Olivier in \"Wuthering Heights\" (1970), then as \"James Bond\" in The Living Daylights (1987) and \"Licence to Kill\" (1989), and even more brutally, recently, as \"Rhett Butler\" in \"Scarlett\" (1994).\n\nUndaunted and good-natured, he has always stated that he likes the risk of challenges. Dalton was enrolled in a school for bright children, where he excelled in sports and was interested in the sciences. He was fascinated with acting from a young age, perhaps due to the fact that both his grandfathers were vaudevillians, but it was when he saw a performance of \"Macbeth\" at age 16 that his destiny was clinched.\n\nHis talent and classic good looks immediately landed him professional work in television, guest-starring on an episode of the short-lived TV series, \"Judge Dee\" (1969), and as a regular on the 14-episode series \"Sat'day While Sunday\" (1967) with the young Malcolm McDowell. In late 1967 Peter O'Toole recommended him for the role of the young \"King Philip of France\" in The Lion in Winter (1968) (coincidentally, this was also Anthony Hopkins' big break). The following year, he starred in the Italian film The Voyeur (1970) with Marcello Mastroianni and Virna Lisi, although his voice was dubbed into Italian by another actor. Dalton also mixed in a healthy dose of BBC work during this time, including The Three Princes (1968) (TV), BBC Play of the Month: Five Finger Exercise (1970) (TV) and Candida (1973) (TV). Also during this time, he was approached and tested for the role of \"James Bond\" in On Her Majesty's Secret Service (1969) but turned it down, feeling he was too young for the part. His next film was another costume drama, Cromwell (1970), working with director Ken Hughes, with whom he later made his first American film, Sextette (1978). He followed Cromwell (1970) with Wuthering Heights (1970) and Mary, Queen of Scots (1971).\n\nFrom the early to mid-1970s, he decided to further hone his skills by going back into the theater full time. He signed on with the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC) and the Prospect Theatre Company (PTC), and toured the world with both, playing the leads in \"Romeo and Juliet\", \"King Lear\", \"Henry V\", \"Love's Labours Lost\", and \"Henry IV\" - parts 1 and 2.\n\nIn 1975, he returned to movies in the British/Austrian production of The Executioner (1975). It was followed in 1976 by the Spanish religious historical film about the inquisition, The Man Who Knew Love (1978), which was never widely released. After this, he took another break from film, mixing in a healthy dose of theater, returning for his first American film, Sextette (1978), and the lengthy miniseries \"Centennial\" (1978), his first American television appearance, in which Lynn Redgrave played his wife. Because of his broad exposure to American audiences in this series, he began to get more frequent film and television work in the US, including the episode \"Fallen Angel\" of \"Charlie's Angels\" (1976) -- which, ironically, had several references to his character being like \"James Bond\" -- and the TV movie The Flame Is Love (1979) (TV). Although he did a few features, including playing Vanessa Redgrave's husband in Agatha (1979), most of his work until 1985 consisted of TV movies and miniseries. He played royalty again in the very campy Flash Gordon (1980). He followed this with a small film, Chanel Solitaire (1981) and, in 1981, also filmed a staged production of Antony and Cleopatra (1983) (TV) opposite Lynn Redgrave, with Anthony Geary, as well as Nichelle Nichols and Walter Koenig of the original TV series, \"Star Trek\" (1966).\n\nThe years 1983-1987 have so far been the most prolific of his career. In 1983, he starred as \"Rochester\" in what he considers one of his best works, the BBC's very popular \"Jane Eyre\" (1983). Also, during this time, Roger Moore was considering leaving Bond, and Dalton was again approached, but due to his full schedule, he had to decline. In 1984, he did one of his many narrations in the \"Faerie Tale Theatre\" (1982) production of The Emperor's New Clothes (1987). That same year also saw him in the Hallmark Hall of Fame piece The Master of Ballantrae (1984) (TV) opposite Michael York and Richard Thomas, and another miniseries, \"Mistral's Daughter\" (1984), opposite Stefanie Powers and Stacy Keach. The next year was also a very busy one. He starred in another miniseries, \"Sins\" (1986), playing the brother of Joan Collins, and also starred in and narrated the four-hour TV movie Florence Nightingale (1985) (TV), opposite Jaclyn Smith. He also starred in The Doctor and the Devils (1985) as \"Dr. Thomas Rock\", with Stephen Rea, Jonathan Pryce, and Patrick Stewart.\n\nIn the mid-to-late 1980s, Dalton narrated many nature documentaries, most notably several episodes of the UK series \"Wildlife Chronicles\" (1987) (called \"Wildlife Chronicles\" in the US). In the spring of 1986, he teamed with Vanessa Redgrave for another revival of a Shakespeare production, The Taming of the Shrew (1988) (TV) and his interpretation of \"Petrucchio\" received uniformly high praise. Simultaneously, the world was playing a guessing game as to who would succeed Roger Moore as \"James Bond\". Dalton was approached but was committed to the theater, and so Pierce Brosnan was offered the part. When Brosnan was unable to get out of his \"Remington Steele\" (1982) contract at the last minute, Dalton was again approached. Able now to work it into his tight schedule, he agreed. Although his first outing as Bond, The Living Daylights (1987), did reasonably well at the box-office, Licence to Kill (1989) suffered from a lack of marketing that appeared to harm its chances of big box-office success. However, Dalton's interpretation of \"Bond\" in this film received critical acclaim in some quarters as being the closest to author Ian Fleming's literary \"Bond\". Back in the theater, he teamed again with Vanessa Redgrave for a revival of Eugene O'Neill's seldom performed play, \"A Touch of the Poet\", which is considered by some to be his and Redgrave's finest professional collaboration. Although there were talks of bringing the play to Broadway, this never materialized.\n\nFollowing Licence to Kill (1989), he immediately returned to one of his strengths, costume drama, in The King's Whore (1990). It was followed by his excellent performance in Disney's The Rocketeer (1991), where he played a swashbuckling, Errol Flynn type. In August 1991, he teamed with Whoopi Goldberg for the first bi-racial interpretation of \"Love Letters\" for the final sold-out performances of the play in Los Angeles.\n\nWhen he had signed on to do \"Bond\" it was for three pictures, but the rights to the \"Bond\" films became entangled in lengthy litigation, delaying production of the third. During this wait, he was set to star in the title role of another historical epic, Christopher Columbus: The Discovery (1992). From the start, however, the film was doomed due to the competition with the GÃ©rard Depardieu \"Columbus\" picture, which was racked with its own problems. When the director was replaced, Dalton backed out and was followed by his co-star, Isabella Rossellini.\n\nIn 1992, he starred in the A&E production \"Framed\" (1992), which won a bronze medal in the 1993 New York Film Festival. The next year, he journeyed to northern Alaska and Minnesota to make a documentary on one of his favorite subjects, wolves. \"In the Company of Whales\" (1991) (TV) went on to win a silver medal in the 1994 New York Film Festival.\n\nHe kept busy in television through 1993 and 1994. He made Red Eagle (1994) (TV), \"Scarlett\" (1994) and managed to squeeze in a guest appearance on \"Tales from the Crypt\" (1989) in the episode \"Werewolf Concerto\". In 1994, he took on the role of \"Rhett Butler\" in the eight-hour mini-series \"Scarlett\" (1994), produced by Robert Halmi Sr. for the Hallmark Hall of Fame. In April of that year, believing he needed to move on to fresh challenges, he officially resigned the role of \"James Bond\", a move which was much regretted by the producers, though they understood his reasons. After two months of negotiations, the role went to Pierce Brosnan.\n\nIn September 1994, Dalton was called upon for two readings of \"Peter and the Wolf\" at the Hollywood Bowl. He played to full-capacity crowds. In November, \"Scarlett\" (1994) premiered and, though given only a lukewarm response by critics, it was a ratings success not only in the US but all over the world, breaking records in many European countries. As always after a major work, Dalton again withdrew quietly and without fanfare to search for his next project, a small, personal film. In the summer of 1995, he journeyed to Canada to shoot \"Salt Water Moose\" (1996). The film was made by Canada's Norstar Entertainment and was sold to Halmi to be the first video release in his new line of Hallmark family films. It premiered on Showtime in June 1996.\n\nDuring the spring of 1996, he made the IRA drama \"The Informant\" (1997) in Ireland and, in May, he traveled to Prague to shoot \"Passion's Way\" (1999), opposite Sela Ward. On February 7, 1997, the comedy \"The Beautician and the Beast\" (1997) co-starring Fran Drescher opened in the US. He also gleefully parodied his swashbuckling/James Bond image in \"Looney Tunes: Back in Action\" (2003) as a spy playing an actor playing a spy.\n\nDalton's recent works include voice work in animated films including a \"Toy Story\" Christmas special and as a series regular on Showtime's upcoming horror series, \"Penny Dreadful.\"\n\nVery much a private man, Dalton's pastimes include fishing, reading, jazz, opera, antique fairs and auctions and, of course, movies."
