        "text": "Timothy Dalton\n\nFacts\n\nFull Name: Timothy Peter Dalton\n\nDate of Birth: 21st March 1946\n\nPlace of Birth: Colwyn Bay, North Wales\n\nHeight: 6' 2\" (1.88m)\n\nOnly Bond: The only Bond to have performed with the Royal Shakespeare Company before becoming 007.\n\nBondography\n\n1987 - The Living Daylights\n\n1989 - Licence To Kill\n\nDet Svenska seriemagasine\n\nBiography\n\nTimothy Peter Dalton was born on the 21st of March 1946 to an American mother and English father, who was both a solider and a successful advertising agent. The eldest of five in the family, Dalton grew up in Colwyn Bay, Wales, where they resided from the time of his birth. At the age of four, the Dalton family moved to Belper in Derbyshire (just south of Manchester), England, where the young Timothy was enrolled in a local Grammar school in Manchester - he thrived on sports and sciences before catching the acting bug.\n\nDuring his school years, he attended several stage and theatre productions including Shakespeare's \"Macbeth\", which reportedly inspired Dalton to make a career on the stage. Also in school, Dalton first performed in \"Arms and the Man\" - a George Bernard Shaw play in which Timothy played Sergius, a gallant war hero. Dalton continued to perform on stage in a variety of productions, including \"Billy Lair\" at a local theatre. Dalton began his professional dramatic career on tour with the National Youth Theatre. In 1964 he won a role with the company's Shakespearian production of \"Coriolanus\" at London's Queen's Theatre.\n\nAfter leaving high school and with an already impressive resum√©, Dalton won a place in the prestigious Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts in London. He never completed his course at RADA, and freely admitted that he found teaching was no substitute for intuition or experience when it came to acting. After dropping out early, Dalton set about finding an acting job. In 1966 he was welcomed back to the National Youth Theatre in London where he won the lead and title role in \"Little Malcolm and His Struggle against the Eunuchs\" as well as \"A Game Called Arthur\".\n\nThrough his work with the Youth Theatre, Dalton began to build on his range of roles and broaden his talents as an actor. After a run of \"Little Malcolm And His Struggle Against The Eunuchs\" Dalton was signed to the Birmingham Repertory Theatre. Soon after accepting that contract, Dalton's workload doubled as he began to be noticed by a range of influential film and television personalities. In the late 1960's, he was picked up for a role in \"Sat'day While Sunday\", a north-London based mini series in which he featured in 11 episodes. The production shot during the day every Saturday and Sunday so that Dalton could still fulfill his contract with the Repertory Theatre.\n\nIn 1968, Dalton made his breakthrough in to cinema in the Academy Award winning drama \"The Lion In Winter\". Based on the play by James Goldman, Dalton made his film debut as King Philip of France in this production. He played opposite screen legends such as Peter O'Toole (who had recommended Dalton for the role), Anthony Hopkins (who also made his Hollywood break with this picture), and of course the stunning Katharine Hepburn.\n\nAfter this auspicious start in film, Dalton returned to local UK stage productions before winning a role in the BBC's \"The Three Princes\" which aired on UK television in the winter of 1968. Through carefully selecting each job and being ever determined to make the very best of each part he took on, Dalton began to develop a name for himself in the industry. It was in '68 that he was first approached by Bond producers, Albert \"Cubby\"Broccoli and Harry Saltzman to star in their latest Bond picture - \" On Her Majesty`s Secret Service\". Dalton turned down the role out of respect for the character, feeling he was too young to accurately play the famous British spy. However, he left a distinct impression with Broccoli, who vowed he would not take no for an answer next time.\n\nDalton continued to work an impressive and varied career as an actor and stage producer - taking on roles in the film adaptation of \"War and Peace\" and 1979's \"Agatha\", a biopic of crime-writer Agatha Christie, all the while developing his real dramatic passion: Shakespeare on stage.\n\nDalton performed on stage in \"Royal Hunt Of The Sun\" and \"Mary Queen Of Scots\" alongside Vanessa Redgrave during 1970, and portrayed Macbeth in Shakespeare's great tragedy the following year.\n\nHe would not return to the big screen until 1970 when Ken Hughes offered him the role of Price Rupert in his historical drama \"Cromwell\". Eight years later, Hughes and Dalton would work again on \"Sextette\", a more modern production than those in his previous resume but one that would begin to make Dalton a more globally recognised name.\n\nAmericanized to \"License To Kill\" (with an \"s\"), but the British version won out. The title is referred to by M when 007 quits the secret service - \"effective immediately, your licence to kill is revoked\"\n\nDalton was introduced to the world as James Bond on August 7th 1986, and a month later was whisked to Vienna, Austria to begin location shooting for his first 007 adventure \"The Living Daylights\". While at first Dalton was weary of his newfound fame Bond had thrust upon him, he delivered a remarkable performance as 007 and held the job in the highest respect. Dalton brought a Fleming-esque realism to the shoot and the writers of the day made many alterations to suit Dalton's Bond. Despite the disappointing revenue and severe lack of publicity for his second outing \"Licence To Kill \", Dalton had intentions of a 3rd Bond picture - as his 007 contract extended him until the early 1990s. After the legal battles put a delay on Bond 17, Dalton stood down from the role of 007 in a Variety-covered press release on April 12th, 1994.\n\nAfter his short stint onscreen as 007, Dalton continued to perform regularly in theatre and dabbled in the US movie market with Disney's \"The Rocketeer\" and even signed onto a big-budget biopic of Christopher Columbus, later bowing out of the production due to disagreements and a change of creative staff.\n\nIn 1994 Dalton took the lead in \"Scarlet\" a brilliant historical drama and the follow up to \"Gone With The Wind\". The period mini series clinched two Emmy awards for art direction and hair and makeup. That same year Dalton read \"Peter and the Wolf\" to two sellout crowds at a live performance at Los Angeles' Hollywood Bowl.\n\nDalton appeared in many productions with British star Vanessa Redgrave and while nothing was ever formalised, Dalton remained close friends with the actress from 1980 until 1994. Dalton was later married for a short spell to Russian composer Oksana Grigorieva with whom he had one son, Alexander. Dalton resides in Los Angeles today performing in selected films and stage productions.\n\nThe Volksoper Vienna in The Living Daylights 1987\n\nVolksoper house in Vienna\n\nOver 150 Singers\n\n95 orchestral musicians\n\n64 choir members\n\nover 100 dancers\n\n218 technicians\n\n1.000 surprises\n\nin one single house!"
