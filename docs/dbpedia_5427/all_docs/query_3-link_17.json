        "text": "Tough question for me really. I thought Moore did a great job in FYEO and although I enjoy Octopussy for the most part, he should have retired after FYEO. Then Dalton could have taken over.\n\nAs it turned out Moore didn't retire until starring in 2 more films. I like Dalton as Bond, I really do, but I like Brosnan better and would have preferred Brosnan got the role in 1986. So, it's really a bunch of \"what ifs\" at this point in my point of view.\n\nTLD is one of the best Bond films imo, but LTK is one of the worst. Though, it wasn't Dalton's fault...or Talisa Soto's either.\n\nI agree about Moore retiring after FYEO. That would have given Dalton 2 more. I don't think Dalton would have wanted to do any more that 4 Bond films.\n\nPeople need to stop lambasting him (and Daniel also) just because they're not Bronsan, Moore, or even Connery. Having watched both TLD and LTK last night, I find them better than Bronsan's entries by a wide margin. Timothy and Daniel are the closest incarnations to Fleming's Bond thus far, and just like Daniel...Timothy was dedicated to the part and did his best with what he had.\n\nYes, Moore is the problem with my 4 films is enough theory as his best were his 4th and 6th respectively. I agree with you, Craig will only do one or two more and then drop out. Even if he does 4, he could very well be 50 years old by the time a number five did come out so I don't see it happening myself.\n\nI think Dalton is better with a short era. But don't get me wrong, I don't mean he's a bad actor, but in my opinion, the more is short an era, the more intensive is. Tim' did two wonderful movies, both form part of the top five, always in my opinion of course, and I think Dalton would not have been able to keep his character during seven movies. Licence to kill was written for him, and I can't imagine others movies like that one five times.\n\nOkey, act Bond twice is very brief, and I would have enjoyed a third movie, A view to a kill perhaps, or a movie in 1991/1992, but seven, no.\n\nDalton, like Lazenby and Craig perhaps, are actors who will be better acting Bond in a short period, to make changes to the character, to the saga, to innovate, and Connery, Moore and Brosnan are better to represent the character in a long period.\n\nI'm glad they at least made a game with the likeness of Timothy Dalton. James Bond 007: The Duel came out in 1993 so Dalton was still expected to return as 007. This was also the last Bond game made by Domark and the last game to come out before GoldenEye 007 for the N64.\n\nI loved this game. It was so cheap & cheesey, you could play it for hours; Mario Brothers with a PPK.\n\nBoth Roger Moore & Sean Connery wore the tux way too long. Poor George Lazenby was doomed to fail anyway. He could've hung around & done DAF. As for Pierce Brosnan, he got it right with 4. By the time DAD came around, all the elements in that movie pointed towards Brosnan being done. So I think Timothy Dalton should've hung around for at least 1 more, if not two. I think were it not for the the writers' strike & other proprietary legalities that held up production for over half a decade, EON Productions would've cranked out their customary Bond adventure, every 2 years as always, giving Timothy Dalton a 3rd picture to mold as his own.\n\nTough question for me really. I thought Moore did a great job in FYEO and although I enjoy Octopussy for the most part, he should have retired after FYEO. Then Dalton could have taken over.\n\nAs it turned out Moore didn't retire until starring in 2 more films. I like Dalton as Bond, I really do, but I like Brosnan better and would have preferred Brosnan got the role in 1986. So, it's really a bunch of \"what ifs\" at this point in my point of view.\n\nTLD is one of the best Bond films imo, but LTK is one of the worst. Though, it wasn't Dalton's fault...or Talisa Soto's either.\n\nI think Robert Davi has one of the coolest entrances for a villain, aside from Kurt Jurgens. You know right away what this guy's about & what he's capable of.. \"What did he promise you, his heart? Give her his heart.\""
