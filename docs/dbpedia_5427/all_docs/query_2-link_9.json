        "text": "AgentJamesBond007 wrote:\n\nTim Dalton. He was an accomplished theatre actor and was in numerous films prior to Bond. Christopher Lee was great as well.\n\nPardon me Christopher Lee is great and is as close as you get to being a legendary actor.\n\nIn comparison Timothy Dalton is an able actor albeit lacking a really succesfull movie in his resume.\n\nI think that Lee is indeed one of the most ............... wait for it .............. legendary actors to ever visit the Bondfranchise and while the series has had a great many talented actors and actrices he remains in a league of his own. Perhaps the only actor in that category is Sean Connery the one actor to become a movie star after he left the 007 franchise.\n\nDon't get me wrong I like Christopher Lee but is he really an all time great? His body of work is largely mediocre (lets face it the Hammer films for which he is most renowned are pretty trashy). The only bons fide masterpiece I can remember him being in is The Wicker Man.\n\nIf we're talking serious acting CVs then hes way behind Shaw, Walken, Dench, Fiennes and Finney.\n\nTheWizardOfIce wrote:\n\nDon't get me wrong I like Christopher Lee but is he really an all time great?

The only bons fide masterpiece I can remember him being in is The Wicker Man.\n\nIf we're talking serious acting CVs then hes way behind Shaw, Walken, Dench, Fiennes and Finney.\n\nWell, he's been in just about everything. Hammer Horror, Sherlock Holmes, Star Wars, Bond, Lord of The Rings. Seriously, if it's a major franchise, he's probably been in it at some point or another.\n\nConnery's not too shabby either. Being the James Bond is obviously very big, as is being Indiana Jones's father, and winning an Academy Award and an AFI Lifetime Achievement. Some of his other movies aren't too shabby either, like The Longest Day (which I must take this opportunity to point out is objectively the manliest movie ever because it has both Sean Connery and John Wayne), The Hill, A Bridge too Far, and The Rock.\n\nSoundofthesinners wrote:\n\nWell, he's been in just about everything.

The Hammer films are fun but hardly great exemplars of the cinematic art, hes not going to be remembered in the same breath as Rathbone, Brett and Cumberbatch for his Holmes portrayal, hes in the worst Star Wars films and one of the worst Bonds. Not a fan of LOTR but I suppose you could say they are classics but Lees career seems more quantity over quality to me. Granted hes been in every franchise possible - Dracula, Frankenstein, Holmes, Bond, Star Wars, LOTR but I dont really think hes ever been in any real danger of winning an Oscar has he?\n\nSoundofthesinners wrote:\n\nConnery's not too shabby either.

A great film but to say he 'starred' in it is almost punishable under the trades descriptions act. He appears for about 2 minutes in total (in a 3 hour film) and has about 3 lines.\n\nI'd say Connery, Lee and Walken.\n\nI actually haven't seen Lee in much. I haven't seen Star Wars or Lord Of The Rings but they've done really well. I do like the Hammer movies though.\n\nI found out something interesting about Lee the other day. He turned down Loomis in Halloween, and he later said that it was the biggest regret of his career.\n\nSo Loomis was almost played by Scaramanga but ended up being played by Blofeld.\n\nSean Connery, Dame Judi, Albert Finney and Giancarlo Giannini all come to mind.\n\nSean is in so many ways the ultimate powerhouse star. You would be hard pressed to meet someone who doesn't know who he is or hasn't seen many of his most iconic roles, from 007 himself to Henry Sr. and Jim Malone.\n\nWhile we're at it, I don't think anybody's mentioned John Cleese. Being a part of the defining British comedy troupe and making two of the funniest movies ever with them is no small accomplishment, as is making one of the greatest sitcoms of all time and showing up in James Bond, Harry Potter, and Shrek (when it was actually good).\n\nI still think Robert Shaw as an actor was maybe the best one, he did not play in as many films as Christopher Lee but did he ever play in a poor movie or gave a lazy performance, even once, in his career?"
