        "text": "Timothy Dalton and Pierce Brosnan are linked in a way none of the other Bond actors are. Moore and Connery were separated by the (relative) failure of George Lazenby; Daniel Craig got to start from scratch as the franchise went back to the source material. Dalton had to deal with the fact that after View to a Kill the Bond producers preferred Brosnan but failed to get him out of his Remington Steele contract. The Living Daylights, the first of Dalton’s two movies, certainly feels like it would be more suited to Brosnan’s smirking presence. Dalton agitated to get a lot of the campy one-liners and juvenile humor out of the screenplay, but no one seems to have come up with any character ideas to fill in the gaps. The same writing team and director as the last three Moore movies do not provide new ideas. Other than repeat his catchphrases excessively to confirm that he is in fact James Bond, Dalton has almost nothing to play in Daylights. Setting the climax in Afghanistan of all places (shot in Southern California) makes it one of the least scenically interesting 007 flicks.\n\nBond’s sex appeal is extremely muted at the height of the AIDS crisis. Dalton’s incarnation of the character is improbably the most chaste ever, despite the actor being arguably the most objectively handsome Bond. (To my tastes, anyway. Daniel Craig is pretty cute but a little too beefy.) Maryam d’Abo is pretty tame as a cello-playing Bond girl. Their interactions have a muted, respectful slant that’s not very much fun. Joe Don Baker is on a different wavelength entirely as an arms dealer who is ready with a long speech about military history at any provocation. His scenes seem flown in from another movie, disconnected to the main action. His character begins a dispiriting run of bad guys in Bond movies who are merely ambitious criminals, not true supervillains. At least Dalton gets a good introduction in an economical pre-credits sequence.\n\nLicense to Kill is a classic overcorrection; an effort to give Dalton what he wanted from the character and respond to the violent, gruesome, nihilistic direction American action movies had been heading in for the entirety of the eighties. A dispiriting failure, it’s the St. Anger of James Bond movies. The same brain trust that made Octopussy tried to write their new star a coke-fueled, blood-soaked revenge thriller. This is a poor choice for the franchise on the face of it, but it’s not especially well executed. Director John Glen and writer/producer Michael Wilson just can’t help retaining elements of their old movies, and the film whiplashes from grotesque murders to light comedy heedlessly. They let Dalton actually show remorse, mentioning Bond’s late wife for the first time since 1971, but then they have him thieving and slaughtering like a well-tailored Charles Bronson for most of the film’s length. It’s super weird when Q shows up in the middle of Bond’s unauthorized murder rampage. Robert Davi gives a good performance as a psycho drug lord, but again, he’s not really a Bond villain, he’s more like something out of Robocop. License is too ugly to be romantic, but Carey Lowell is dull as yet another American female operative. Dr. Goodhead, we hardly knew ye. The finale, set in the fictional “Republic of Isthmus” but actually Mexico, is a quite spectacular series of fiery vehicle explosions. The death toll and the explicit violence are totally too much. I want to see chases in James Bond movies where we see the bad guys safely land away from the crashes and shake their fists at 007 as he escapes, A-Team style. Is that too much to ask?\n\nGoldeneye is the big debut for Pierce Brosnan, the prince who was promised, and it’s fondly remembered. That might well be because the iconic tie-in video game was a generational classic, but it’s also a slick, modern entertainment with zesty support work from Famke Janssen and Robbie Coltrane and effective direction by Martin Campbell. Watching it for the first time in several years, what strikes me is how aggressively the movie tries to criticize Bond’s character. Seemingly everyone he encounters, from Judi Dench’s M to Coltrane’s Russian gangster, gives a speech about how he’s an outdated relic. The villain, played by Sean Bean, is pointedly conceived as Bond’s mirror image. He’s a former 006! But Goldeneye is arguing that Bond doesn’t really need to change. You need to rotate in younger actors every once in a while, and it helps to hire filmmakers who have seen other movies, but the series’ core values are fine.\n\nIt’s a triumphant return for juvenile one-liners, suggestive character names, plummy Russian accents, and ludicrously destructive (but somehow not deadly) set pieces. The St. Petersburg tank chase is dynamite, and so is the bungee-jump cold open and everything having to do with Janssen’s absurd sex assassin. The elements that have dated worst about Goldeneye are the elements it borrows from outside movies. Computers and James Bond are always an odd fit, on either side of the camera. Digital effects start to proliferate, if not to the ruinous degree that they would in the later Brosnans. The horny, craven hacker henchman was played out even by 1995. Izabella Scorupco as programming genius is a bit of a stretch. Bean’s muted Alec Trevelyan is just a sophisticated bank robber with no interest in world domination. His needlessly complex back story is way less fun than Nazis breeding Christopher Walkens. And as is often the case, the finale isn’t as dramatic as some of the action scenes that precede it.\n\nTomorrow Never Dies didn’t get a Nintendo 64 adaptation, and that’s the only reason I can think of why it isn’t rated quite as highly as Goldeneye. For my money, it’s the best of the Pierce Brosnan movies by a wide margin. About the only thing you can really nitpick is that the henchmen played by Ricky Jay and Götz Otto aren’t well utilized. Jonathan Pryce is maybe given a little too much leeway in his role as thinly veiled Murdoch allegory Elliot Carver, but I’m too pleased by the return of a real live megalomaniacal supervillain to the Bond mix to complain. He has a stealth hovercraft! He likes to write people’s obituaries and show them to them before he kills them! His company releases software with lots of bugs on purpose! The dude is big-time evil.\n\nThe stunts are very consistent throughout (although the jet-fighting cold open continues the slide into heavy CGI). There’s a bunch of good underwater work (they were due). The car smash-up with Bond driving by remote from the backseat is a nice twist. They jump a damn motorcycle over a damn helicopter. Teri Hatcher is utilized the way the Connery movies used major babes who can’t act a lick, killed off before she can slow the movie down. Meanwhile Michelle Yeoh absolutely kills it as Chinese spy Wai Lin, the first and only Bond heroine to be the MI6 man’s physical equal. She could almost certainly take Bond in a fight and both of them seem to realize it. The way they work together through the second half of the movie, barely even having to talk to coordinate their moves (a wise choice given Yeoh’s questionable English fluency), is the most explicitly feminist statement the Bond pictures have ever made. Watching Tomorrow Never Dies again, you recognize how Wai is clearly better at her job than Bond is at his — she investigates Carver at the same time and reaches the same conclusions, only without causing millions in property damage and getting Teri Hatcher murdered. Brosnan deserves some credit for allowing himself to be upstaged. The scene where he repeatedly almost kills them both with Chinese spy equipment is grand slapstick. Yeoh is never at any point helpless or in distress. Wai Lin could have carried her own series.\n\nThe World Is Not Enough is a massive letdown. It has so many problems. Goldeneye and Tomorrow Never Dies might have been slightly unsophisticated, but Michael Apted’s film is a trainwreck. There had been bad Bond movies before, but never one that failed at basic film grammar. Choosing a guy best known for documentaries to direct action was not a wise move. World is glaringly mishandled. Characters and vehicles jump in and out of position from shot to shot. It skips like frames are missing. In the skiing sequence, the snow and the sky change color from one angle to the next. Basic transitions are consistently botched. Using a crew of experienced veterans on every movie for 20 years ultimately had its downsides, but guaranteed a basic level of competency. (That should be on the poster for Octopussy — “Basically Competent.”) The concept for the Brosnan era, give a British Empire director with no relevant experience a shot, paid off twice but hit a brick wall here. It’s all downhill after the epic pre-credits sequence, which is the longest and most elaborate one ever.\n\nThe World Is Not Enough is simultaneously too complicated and extremely simplistic. It tries to give Judi Dench more to do by inserting M into the action, but this only serves to degrade the character by having her make foolish decisions just like everyone else in the movie. The screenwriting is often as incompetent as the direction and editing. A great deal is made of Robert Carlyle’s character’s inability to feel pain — an entire secondary Bond babe played by Serena Scott Thomas is introduced simply to explain it — but it doesn’t pay off in any meaningful way. Neither does the tension theoretically caused by Bond’s seduction of Carlyle’s partner. Robbie Coltrane’s likable gangster from Goldeneye is resentfully brought back for a long, boring plot detour that serves no narrative or dramatic function. There are way too many undifferentiated henchmen. John Cleese is glaringly misused in a “comedy” scene that witlessly distracts from Desmond Llewelyn’s farewell appearance as Q. (If they had to replace the Bond series’ only Welsh character with a Monty Python guy, wouldn’t Terry Jones have had made more sense? I might be the only person who cares about this. Sue me, I like Welsh accents.)\n\nThe most widely derided element of The World Is Not Enough is actually my favorite thing about it. I refer to Denise Richards’ casting as nuclear physicist Dr. Christmas Jones. I wouldn’t say that Richards is good in the role, but I also don’t think she is intended to be. The actress herself might not be in on the joke, but at least the filmmakers are. Does she prance around in hot pants and a tank top and totally whiff elementary line readings? Hell yeah she does. It’s a much bigger problem that Sophie Marceau is cast in a role that isn’t openly a gag. We’re supposed to take her seriously as one of the most duplicitous and sinister women in the whole run of the series, but she’s as vacant and shrill as Bond girls come. An aside — they are making the twenty-fifth Bond movie right now and not one of them has had a woman as principal villain. Marceau’s Elektra King comes the closest, but she doesn’t quite count due to the (pointless) presence of Carlyle’s Renard. They have made so many of these movies that they are setting them in places most Westerners have never heard of, in this case Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan. But they still haven’t gotten around to letting a woman attempt world domination.\n\nDie Another Day has a better director, Lee Tamahori, but an even dumber script. The handful of shots with real action in them are marred by blurry slow motion that’s too far off the series handbook. Halle Berry is very poor as the good bad girl, although Rosamund Pike is a standout as the bad good girl. There are again too many villains, with Rick Yune’s diamond-faced maniac upstaged by Toby Stephens’ mincing Richard Branson parody. Madonna is in it for a minute, which is enjoyable. There are constant callbacks to other movies in the series, especially Goldfinger, in recognition of the Bond films’ 40th anniversary. This fits very strangely with a plot that begins with Bond being imprisoned and tortured for more than a year, until five minutes after he is released both he and the movie completely forget about this. The digital effects have expanded to the point where they make action sequences tedious. There is a laser fight where artists have obviously filled the lasers in where the stuntmen aren’t. There is a windsurfing escape that looks as blatantly artificial as Roger Moore in front of a rear projection screen in 1973, only without the cuts to wide shots of actual stunts. It takes clumsy forced product placement to strange new places.\n\nCGI was being used since Goldeneye, but this marks the clear turning point where you’re just watching sophisticated cartoons. Somehow the props and effects from this 2002 effort seem vastly more quaint and outdated than those from 1979’s Moonraker. The film’s jumps in setting seem completely arbitrary, and it ends abruptly after taking nearly a full hour to really get started. It’s not the worst Bond movie, but it might be the most pointless. The move to a more grounded, human take on Bond was overdue. Finally, vindication for George Lazenby."
