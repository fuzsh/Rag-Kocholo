        "text": "I'm sure there has been a discussion on this before. But I'll be stuffed if I can find it. (Where's Kyvan when you need him?)\n\nAnyway if anyone knows of a similar thread please post a link and I'll merge them.\n\nI was recently watching The Dambusters with Richard Todd and as I often do whilst watching a movie, I had a look on imdb to get some info and trivia. One of the items I noticed is apparently Richard Todd was Fleming's choice for James Bond in Doctor No, but couldn't due to scheduling conflicts.\n\nI have to say based on his screen presence, I think he may have made a very good Bond under different circumstances.\n\nA very credible 60's Bond anyway.\n\nAs for other actors, I found a list on Wikipedia as follows. So take it how you will..\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_actors_considered_for_the_James_Bond_character\n\nStanley Baker 1961 Would not commit to a three picture contract.\n\nRex Harrison 1962 Turned down in favour of Connery.\n\nDavid Niven 1962 Turned down in favour of Connery (later played Bond in the 1967 parody Casino Royale) (Fleming's personal choice).\n\nRichard Todd 1962 Ian Fleming's first choice for the role, but scheduling conflicts prevented him from getting it.\n\nJeremy Brett 1967 Reason unknown.\n\nMichael Caine 1967 Didn't want typecasting in spy films, having previously starred in the three \"Harry Palmer\" spy films.\n\nRobert Campbell 1967 George Lazenby won the role based on a screen-test fight scene.\n\nDick van Dyke 1967 His \"English\" accent failed to appeal to producer Albert R. Broccoli.\n\nPatrick Mower 1967 Reason unknown.\n\nDaniel Pilon 1967 Harry Saltzman felt he was too young, 27 years at time.\n\nJohn Richardson 1967 George Lazenby won the role based on a screen-test fight scene.\n\nAnthony Rogers 1967 George Lazenby won the role based on a screen-test fight scene.\n\nTerence Stamp 1967 His ideas for the future films felt too radical for producer Harry Saltzman.\n\nHans De Vries 1967 George Lazenby won the role based on a screen-test fight scene.\n\nEric Braeden 1968 Albert R. Broccoli at first, thought he was British and so considered him.[clarification needed] But it was Broccoli's belief that no one from outside the Commonwealth would be suitable as James Bond.\n\nOliver Reed 1969 Unknown reason.\n\nTimothy Dalton 1969-1972 He thought himself too young and did not wish to follow Connery. Would decline the role again in 1979, before finally being cast in 1986.\n\nRoger Green 1970 Turned down in favour of Connery (Auditioned and filmed for Diamonds Are Forever) (Filmed audition with Imogen Hassall).\n\nSimon Dee 1971 Put forward to follow Sean Connery, despite thought by most people as a chat show host, rather than an actor.\n\nWilliam Gaunt 1971 Auditioned for the role as Bond for Live and Let Die but lost the role to Roger Moore.\n\nJohn Gavin 1971, 1973 Left the role the first time when Sean Connery returned, and was denied the second time because he was not English.\n\nSimon Oates 1971, 1973 Was strongly considered but turned down when Sean Connery returned; was working on other projects when Roger Moore was selected.\n\nRanulph Fiennes 1972 For having \"hands too big and a face like a farmer\".\n\nTimothy Dalton 1979 Turned the role down for a second time as he did not like the direction the series was taking. Would eventually be cast in 1986 for The Living Daylights.\n\nDavid Warbeck 1979 Acting considered too \"wooden\".\n\nMichael Jayston 1980 Role up for grabs when Roger Moore was considering quitting but Moore returned. Jayston eventually portrayed the character in 1990 for a two-part BBC radio drama.\n\nPatrick Mower 1980 Role up for grabs when Roger Moore was considering quitting but Moore returned.\n\nLewis Collins 1982 Collins claims the producers thought he was too aggressive.\n\nIan Ogilvy 1983 Roger Moore agreed to return.\n\nJames Brolin 1983 Was lined up for the part, even going so far as buying a house in London for the production, before Roger Moore agreed to return.\n\nPierce Brosnan 1986 Became front runner for The Living Daylights after Timothy Dalton could not take the part due to his commitment to Brenda Starr. However, Brosnan's option to star in a further series of Remington Steele was taken up by NBC, and EON refused to have him do both Steele and Bond at the same time. Fortuitously, Dalton became freed up at just that time, and so reaccepted the role, which he played until 1989. Brosnan would later play Bond from GoldenEye through to Die Another Day.\n\nDaniel Pilon 1986 Timothy Dalton was chosen for the role.\n\nSam Neill 1986 Although he impressed producers as Reilly, Ace of Spies, Neill lost out to Timothy Dalton for this iteration of Bond.\n\nAntony Hamilton 1986 Was in negotiations with the producers before Timothy Dalton was chosen.\n\nMel Gibson 1987 MGM suggested him for the role, but was rejected by Albert. R. Broccoli for not being British.\n\nChristopher Lambert 1987 French accent prevented him from being chosen.\n\nNeil Dickson 1987 Timothy Dalton was chosen.\n\nMark Greenstreet 1987 Told Terry Wogan in an interview that he was given a screen test for Bond but lost out to Timothy Dalton.\n\nFinlay Light 1987 The little-known Australian model was one of the main contenders for The Living Daylights, even signing a ten-year contract. Timothy Dalton was chosen anyway.\n\nAndrew Clarke 1987 One of the most popular Australian actors of the 1980s, Clarke was considered but lost out to Dalton.\n\nSimon MacCorkindale 1987 Timothy Dalton was chosen.\n\nSean Bean 1994 Was the second choice for EON if Timothy Dalton did not return; however, MGM overruled on both counts, and Pierce Brosnan was given the part. The producers were still impressed, and gave him the part of the villain Trevelyan, rewritten from the mentor part it originally was, to become a direct parallel of Bond as Agent 006.\n\nMark Frankel 1994 Pierce Brosnan was chosen for the role.\n\nPaul McGann 1994 Was given an audition and did impress producers, however, MGM insisted still on Pierce Brosnan for the role, but it was believed that McGann would have stepped in if Brosnan turned down the role.\n\nLambert Wilson 1994 Pierce Brosnan was chosen for the role.\n\nHenry Cavill 2005 The preferred choice of director Martin Campbell; however, was deemed too young to portray Bond.\n\nRupert Friend 2005 Daniel Craig was chosen for the role.\n\nJulian McMahon 2005 Daniel Craig was chosen for the role.\n\nAlex O'Loughlin 2005 Daniel Craig was chosen for the role. References to Bond was featured in the reboot of Hawaii Five-0 during the first season.\n\nClive Owen 2005 The producers were unwilling to provide gross profit points.\n\nDougray Scott 2005 Reason unknown.\n\nGoran Višnjić 2005 Reason unknown.\n\nThoughts or link to previous discussion."
