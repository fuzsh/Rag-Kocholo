        "text": "When I first saw Dalton’s films, I thought he was good. No more, no less. Connery, at the time, was still my favorite. The only one I wasn’t wowed by was George Lazenby, but even he wasn’t terrible. Then, by chance, a friend of mine traveled to California and while out there, but me the entire collection of Fleming’s James Bond novels. I started with the first book (Though I wanted to start with “Thunderball”. my favorite Bond film of the time) And went in sequence. Then I discovered the other novels, Gardner’s, Benson’s. I got Sebastian Foulkes’ one-off, and paid a pretty penny for “Colonel Sun”, by Kingsley Amis. Around this time as well, They released the digitally remastered collections, and I got those one at a time. Much like the novels, I went film by film. (I also read Deaver's novel recently, BTW. Also excellent)\n\nBy the time I’d finished, I was struck by how badly I’d misjudged Timothy Dalton. I didn’t think he was terrible by any stretch the first time around, but after Connery and Roger Moore, his take was just so different. He showed a great deal of emotion. The girl didn’t immediately get naked for him. Is he wooing her a little? You're charging clothes to her villainous boyfriend? Did you just annihilate a shooting gallery booth and win her a stuffed elephant? She called you a horse's @ss and you just laughed it off? You get to wear tuxes and kill bad guys and you'd actually be happy if M fired you? What’s going on here?\n\nHis take was so close to Fleming’s writing that it’s remarkable, and it’s a shame Fleming couldn’t have been around to see him. Dalton’s Bond truly was Ian Fleming’s James Bond, with Craig in a close 2nd. It was the only glimpse we saw of Bond (At that time) that showed his true nature. Sure he did the job, and sure he liked the excitement, but he hated it at the same time. He is pitch perfect in the scene where he tells Saunders to tell M he didn’t follow orders, and would be glad if M fired him. He completely sells a man that’s burned out, which is an incredible acting achievement since by that time, he’s only been playing the role for about 20 minutes of screen time. The new guy is selling a world-weary performance of Britain's best secret agent? Holy crap this guy is good.\n\nConnery was excellent, but after “From Russia With Love”, the series concentrated more and more on Bond’s jet-setting lifestyle and the gadgets. Who cares that he’s killing person after person, look at how great this lifestyle is! Kill everyone and then you can take a nice vacation, and hey, we'll even throw in some extra cash from the Queen.\n\nDalton didn’t make Bond more than he was. A man who knew he had a duty, but made no qualms about the fact that he was living for today because he could die tomorrow. Who drank and smoked constantly to wash out the poison he felt in his system. He made Bond a spy again. He uses every ounce of that skill in his second outing, first making Sanchez his friend, then destroying him piece-by-piece from the inside out.\n\nAnyone that says Dalton isn’t good with the ladies needs only watch his interplay with Maryam D’Abo in TLD. He goes from seeing her only as a piece of a puzzle, to exasperation, to admiration, to real fondness. You can see how much he’s grown to care for her in his final line. “You didn’t think I’d miss THIS performance, did you?” (Craig gets the same type of growth with Vesper. He works his way into her heart, despite her best efforts, and you only realize at the end that she thinks she sacrified her lover's life in order to do so)\n\nAnd then there's Carey Lowell. Sure the script let her down in the second half by making her act like a jealous schoolgirl half the time, but to see them go from a sassy interplay to him holding her down on the bed with a gun in her face when he thinks she's betrayed him is almost as good as the Pushkin scene. And much like Craig's Bond, we see him realize that he's kind of screwed up. Craig's Bond screws up. But he fixes the wrong. Same with Dalton. So single-minded was his determination to destroy Sanchez that he actually created additional problems. But, we also see him become even more determined to finish the job and not allow for any more slip-ups.\n\nAlso, Dalton is, IMO, the best ACTOR to play James Bond. Craig is also a great actor, but Dalton takes the lead IMO. Dalton hits all the right notes, even in the throwaway one-liners. I think it's hilarious that he bluffs Kara at the beginning of the ice chase. \"Oh, Salt corrosion.\" 'Must be an Atmospheric Anomaly.\" By the time he's getting set to blow up the barricade, he's given up on pretense and he's not even trying to fool her anymore with \"I've had a few optional extras installed.\"\n\nDalton's standout scene The scene between himself and Pushkin in TLD is the best scene in any Bond film, Period Connery's \"That's a smith and Wesson, and you've had your six.\" Is high up there, But Dalton's peortrayal is so multi-faceted that you weally don't know what the hell he's going to do. They even borrowed elements of it for Craig’s introduction in “Casino Royale” with the bent agent. Close second is the absolutely perfect comeuppance for Sanchez. \"Don't you want to know WHY?\" *ligher*\n\nThe reaction to Saunders’ death, pitch perfect. And he completely shows the continued impact Tracy’s death still has on him in one line in “Licence to Kill\", and the emotion he conveys in “Licence to Kill” when he’s going through Leiter’s house in the aftermath of Sanchez maiming him and killing Della is better than a great deal of Roger Moore’s performance in all the Bond films combined. (Gotta give Moore his props though for the acting in \"The Spy Who Loved Me\" when Anya brings up the touchy subject, and Moore stepped it up in \"For Your Eyes Only\") Not only has the man who he probably considers his best friend been nearly killed, but that man now shares the same tragedy of losing his wife on his wedding day. Craig also shines after failing to revive Vesper, but there's still a bit more of an emotional performance in that Dalton scene than with Craig.\n\nAnd that brief moment in LTK after he's finally killed Sanchez and the fight is over. Wow. He's so high-strung and intense that whole chase, a single-minded determination that's almost bordering on insanity to completely obliterate Sanchez and everything he has. He finally does it, and we see him so emotionally drained and relieved that it's over that he seems like he's about to cry with relief. He's tired, weak, in pain, dirty, bleeding...And happy to still be alive.\n\nAnd finally, he brought the danger back. His was the first Bond performance in 20 years that made you fear the man. Sure he had the prerequisite gadgets, but it didn’t feel like he absolutely needed them to survive. And look at the final 30 minutes or so of LTK. Bond destroys an entire drug set-up, several henchmen, 20 tons of cocaine, and Sanchez with nothing more than a flaming beaker of gasoline, a tanker truck, a cropduster, and a lighter. Craig's bad@ss also, and it's nice to see that return to form.\n\nConnery and Craig are great. Roger Moore was fun. Brosnan was good and Lazenby is good. But Dalton has taken the place of my, and I stress, MY number one James Bond. My order would be Dalton, Connery/Craig (Tie) Moore, Brosnan, and Lazenby. He’s the definitive Fleming Bond. Craig is very close, but Dalton has the edge in several ways."
