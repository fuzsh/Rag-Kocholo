        "text": "Timothy Dalton (born 21 March 1946[1]) guest starred as Rassilon in the Doctor Who television story The End of Time.\n\nHe was one of many names put forward for the parts of the Eighth Doctor and the Master in the 1996 TV Movie.[2] He was also considered for Gustave Lytton in Resurrection of the Daleks.\n\nCareer[]\n\nHe is best known for playing James Bond in the films The Living Daylights (1987) and Licence to Kill (1989), as well as for his Shakespearean and TV costume drama acting. His varied film appearances include the 1980 version of Flash Gordon with Brian Blessed, and the role of Rhett Butler in Scarlett, a high-profile made-for-TV sequel to Gone With the Wind which aired in the 1990s. He also starred in the film Hawks with Camille Coduri.\n\nMore recently he has also appeared as Alexei Volkoff in Season 4 of the NBC show Chuck, and the British comedy-action film Hot Fuzz alongside Simon Pegg and Nick Frost, and also appeared as a voice actor for Pixar's Toy Story 3, playing the character of hedgehog Mr Pricklepants.\n\nDalton is the highest-profile actor yet from the Bond film franchise to appear in Doctor Who. Others have included Honor Blackman, John Cleese, Colin Salmon, and (in The Sarah Jane Adventures) Samantha Bond and Joseph Millson.\n\nIn the DWU[]\n\nSam Jones had always hated the James Bond movies, considering him a \"crypto-capitalist male chauvinist pig\", but thought that Timothy Dalton hadn't been bad.
