        "text": "Prolific actor David Hedison passed away on July 18th at the age of 92. I always enjoyed seeing him appear on numerous television shows and movies throughout the years. He acted in several memorable productions.\n\nAlbert David Hedison Jr. was born on May 20, 1927 in Providence, RI. Hedison first became involved in acting when he appeared in a school play in Junior High School. He attended Brown University in Providence, where he majored in English. Hedison subsequently studied at the Neighborhood Playhouse and the Actors Studio in New York City.\n\nUnder the name “Al Hedison” he appeared in various stage productions throughout the 1950s, including the 1956 Broadway production of A Month in the Country directed by Michael Redgrave. This brought him to the attention of 20th Century Fox, who signed him to a contract. His first job for the studio was a supporting role in the 1957 movie The War Below starring Robert Mitchum.\n\nHedison’s next role was in The Fly (1958). Directed by Kurt Neumann, The Fly was adapted from the short story by George Langelaan. Several actors passed on the role of scientist André Delambre, since the character would spend much of the movie with his face hidden beneath a mask. Hendison, however, was very taken with the screenplay by James Clavell and enthusiastically signed up. The Fly was an incredibly well produced movie, one of the classic sci-fi / horror films, and it featured a very moving & tragic performance by Hedison. It would become one of the most memorable entries in his lengthy career.\n\nIn 1960 Hedison was cast in the Cold War adventure series Five Fingers on NBC. Probably the most noteworthy aspect of this short-lived show was that NBC insisted Hedison change his name, as they apparently felt “Al” was not distinctive enough. Hedison decided to go with his middle name, and for the rest of his career he was billed as “David Hedison.”\n\nFrom 1964 to 1968 Hedison starred as Captain Lee Crane in the sci-fi / adventure TV show Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea. Despite repeated entreaties by series creator Irwin Allen, Hedison was initially uninterested, but he was finally won over when he learned Richard Basehart would be his co-star, portraying Admiral Harriman Nelson. As Hedison recounted in a 2013 interview with Classic Film & TV Café:\n\n“I had never met him, but I admired Richard’s work very much. I got his number from the studio. I called him up, and we agreed to meet at his house. He liked my enthusiasm, we hit it off and we worked really well together. We made the show work. Richard and I had real chemistry. He taught me so much about being camera ready when I needed to be. Television filming is so very fast, we always had to keep moving on. Voyage shot in six days–we filmed at a very fast pace.”\n\nVoyage to the Bottom of the Sea was very much a product of its time, and of Allen’s production style. It was totally story-driven, with stand-alone episodes and no real character development. The first season, shot in black & white, was fairly serious, with a lot of gritty Cold War-type plotlines and a fair amount of location work. Once the show transitioned to color with season two, it started to become over-the-top and silly, with most of the episodes featuring a monster of the week, and pretty much everything being shot in the studio. The show also started reusing a lot of props from Lost in Space and other Allen productions.\n\nDespite these drawbacks, Voyage is a fondly remembered series. Hedison and Basehart’s performances definitely played a large part in that, and they often helped to carry some of the more far-out episodes.\n\nAmong Hedison’s other memorable roles were his two appearances in the James Bond movie franchise. He played CIA agent Felix Leiter in Live and Let Die (1973) with Roger Moore as Bond. Hedison becoming the first actor to play Leiter twice when he reprised the role 16 years later in License to Kill (1989), this time with Timothy Dalton as Bond.\n\nI’ve always felt that having Hedison return as Leiter in License to Kill was a smart move. In the original Ian Fleming novels Leiter was a close ally of Bond, but this never really carried across to the movies, because each time Leiter showed up he was played by a different actor. The plot of License to Kill involves Bond going rogue and seeking vengeance against the South American drug lord who nearly kills Leiter. This becomes much more believable if you have Leiter played by someone who has previously appeared in the role, someone who the audience has an existing connection to. Even though Bond was now played by Dalton, having Hedison return as Leiter really helped sell the idea that these two men were longtime friends, and that Bond would go to hell & back to avenge him.\n\nHedison also found work in television soap operas. Throughout the 1990s he was a regular on Another World, and in 2004 had a recurring role on the soap opera The Young and the Restless.\n\nAlthough Hedison seldom received starring roles later in his career, he nevertheless worked regularly through the decades. According to the New York Times, Hedison appeared in more than 100 movie and television roles during his lengthy career.\n\nAmong Hedison’s noteworthy television guest roles, he appeared in a January 1964 episode of The Saint. Also guest starring the lovely Suzanne Lloyd, “Luella” has Hedison playing a newly-married friend of Simon Templar’s whose wandering eye & overactive libido gets him ensnared in a blackmail scheme. This was definitely one of the most humorous episodes of The Saint, and Hedison really threw himself into it with an energetic performance. This was Hedison’s first time working with Roger Moore, and the two became good friends.\n\nAnother memorable turn for Hedison was “The Queen and the Thief,” an October 1977 episode of the Wonder Woman series starring Lynda Carter. Hedison portrayed suave international jewel thief Evan Robley. The episode guest starred Juliet Mills and John Colicos. It’s certainly one of the more low-key episodes of Wonder Woman, but Hedison definitely sells it with his portrayal of the smooth, charismatic master criminal.\n\nInterviewed in 1992, Hedison stated:\n\n“I think I do comedy best. I think I’m very good at comedy. I’ve done a few comedy things in stock and whatever, and I’m very good at that. You wouldn’t know that from Another World because I’m so grim and serious, as I was as well in Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea, but I do like comedy. I would love to do a comedy, and I’m sure I will someday.”\n\nGiven his fondness for comedy, I’m sure Hedison appreciated his guest roles on The Saint and Wonder Woman, as they enabled him show a much more humorous side than usual.\n\nHedison also possessed a great love for theater. He appeared in numerous stage productions throughout his career. In the 1990s and early 2000s he was a regular presence in regional theater throughout the New England area.\n\nHedison was married Bridget Mori. They met in Positano, Italy in 1967, and were married in London a year later. They had two daughters, Alexandra and Serena Hedison. David and Bridget were together until her death from breast cancer in 2016. I’ve always thought that was very romantic & sweet, that they were married for nearly five decades.\n\nI was fortunate enough to meet David Hedison once, at a comic book convention in New York City in September 2009. I got an autographed photo of him as Felix Leiter from License to Kill. He appeared to me to be a very warm, friendly individual. At the time I also thought he looked much younger than 82 years old.\n\nDue to his appearances in so many popular movies & series, Hedison was a frequent interview subject. In October 2007 he penned a humorous foreword to the informative non-fiction book The Fly at Fifty: The Creation and Legacy of a Classic Science Fiction Film by Diane Kachmar & David Goudsward. Hedison always came across as lively and enthusiastic, possessing a wry sense of humor. Even when he was in his 80s he still brought a lot of energy to his interviews & appearances.\n\nDavid Hedison will certainly be missed by his many fans. He had a good, long life, working in a career he loved. We should all be so fortunate.\n\n“You weren’t there in the final days of the War. You never saw what was born. But if the time lock’s broken, then everything’s coming through. Not just the Daleks, but the Skaro Degradations, the Horde of Travesties, the Nightmare Child, the Could-Have-Been King with his army of Meanwhiles and Neverweres. The War turned into hell. And that’s what you’ve opened, right above the Earth. Hell is descending.” – The Tenth Doctor, “The End of Time”\n\nWhen Doctor Who returned to television in 2005, viewers were informed that the Doctor was apparently the last of the Time Lords. All the other members of his race had apparently died fighting the Daleks in a vast, apocalyptic, realty-rending conflict known as the Time War.\n\nTruthfully, the basic function of the Time War was to sweep the decks of the mountains of continuity that had accumulated during the original run of Doctor Who on television from 1963 to 1989. It enabled showrunner Russell T Davies to start with a clean slate. He was able to streamline things without having to resort to rebooting the series from scratch. It worked elegantly in that regard.\n\nThe Time War also allowed Davies and his collaborators to offer a new perspective on the character of the Doctor. The time traveler was now a haunted, battle-scarred figure suffering from survivor’s guilt and the knowledge that in order to save existence he had been the one to finally bring an end to the carnage of the War.\n\nOf course inevitably viewers were curious to know what exactly had taken place during this infamous Time War. Hints and allusions to the events were peppered throughout various episodes over the next several years, but we never actually saw any part of the conflict itself. I believe that at one point Davies joked that he’d have needed a one hundred million dollar budget to bring the Time War to television screens.\n\nBesides, much of what the Doctor mentioned, such as his recitation of the myriad horrors of the Time War in“The End of Time,” sounded like the sort of abstract, surrealist nightmares that would probably have been impossible to convincingly depict on TV. When we were finally granted a glimpse of the War by Steven Moffat in “The Day of the Doctor” it was presented as a more straightforward conflict, with a billion Dalek spaceships laying siege to Gallifrey. Which, of course, was still pretty damn dramatic.\n\nWe eventually learned that a previously unrevealed incarnation of the Doctor portrayed by John Hurt, the so-called “War Doctor,” was the one who fought in the Time War. The conflict had apparently spanned centuries, during which the War Doctor became a weary old man. Barring the use of archival footage of Hurt as a younger man, it would be impossible to show most of the War Doctor’s experiences.\n\nHaving said all that, I’ve often thought that the Time War would be perfect to present in comic book form. After all, the only limit on what can be shown in comic books is the imaginations of the writers & artists. I even thought of the perfect creative team: Grant Morrison and Richard Case, the writer and penciler who crafted many bizarre, nightmarish, reality-twisting stories during their run on Doom Patrol from 1989 to 1992. Just imagine the creators who brought us such peculiar menaces as the Brotherhood of Dada, the Painting That Ate Paris, the Scissormen and the Candlemaker depicting the freakish, horrifying events of the Time War.\n\nHowever, it never did occur to me that prose fiction would also be another medium in which to recount the events of the Time War, at least not until I spotted the novel Engines of War by George Mann for sale at Forbidden Planet. I immediately grabbed it off the shelf, bought it, and started reading it.\n\nEngines of War is told from the point of view of Cinder, a 21 year old freedom fighter from the human colony of Moldox. Her name comes from the color of her hair, and from the fact that she was found among the burning embers of her home 14 years earlier after her entire family was wiped out by the Daleks. Moldox and the other worlds in the Tantalus Spiral have been conquered by the Daleks, the majority of the colonists either exterminated or captured to serve as slave labor or experimental subjects. Cinder is one of the few humans to have remained free, eking out a hard-scrabble existence among the ruins, fighting a hopeless guerilla war against their conquerors.\n\nThen, very unexpectedly, the Doctor comes into Cinder’s life, his TARDIS shot down during a space battle. Much like Cass from “The Night of the Doctor,” Cinder is initially angry at and frightened by him, believing the Time Lords to be just as bad as the Daleks. However, her desperation to escape the desolation of Moldox is so great that she tentatively lowers her guard when the Doctor offers to take her out of the warzone and to safety.\n\nMann does excellent work developing the character of Cinder, and writing her interactions with the Doctor. Contemplating the idea of something other than the day-to-day struggle for survival against the Daleks that has consumed much of her existence, Cinder starts to recognize the possibilities that life might offer.\n\nFor the War Doctor, so long involved in the war against the Daleks, Cinder is apparently his first extended interaction with humanity since his regeneration. At first he is hesitant to take upon himself the responsibility for her well-being. Like Cinder, the Doctor had resigned himself to the role of a warrior in a seemingly-endless conflict. Now, once again traveling with a companion, however reluctantly, he begins to let down his guard, to care. Cinder offers him an opportunity to reconsider his conviction that he no longer has the right to call himself “Doctor.”\n\nThe style of Mann’s prose reminded me of Terrance Dick’s work on the numerous Doctor Who novelizations. Mann’s writing seems directed at the teenage reader, but it is certainly sophisticated enough that adults will also appreciate it. Early on he succinctly describes the awesome, incomprehensible scope of the conflict:\n\nCinder had heard that in simple, linear terms, the war had been going on for over four hundred years. This, of course, was an untruth, or at least an irrelevance; the temporal war zones had permeated so far and so deep into the very structure of the universe that the conflict had – quite literally – been raging for eternity. There was no epoch that remained unscathed, uncontested, no history that had not been rewritten.\n\nOf course, considering that it is set amidst the Time War, the book offers up plenty of examples of what Mystery Science Theater 3000 once described as “good old fashioned nightmare fuel.” There is some really dark stuff between these covers.\n\nBefore the Doctor can take Cinder to safety, he needs to learn what the Daleks are up to on Moldox and the other worlds in the Spiral. Reluctantly the young human guides him to the nearest occupied city. The Doctor is horrified to discover that the Daleks have harnessed the energy of the Eye of Tantalus, a vast temporal anomaly contained within the Spiral, and used it to create weapons that erase their victims from history. Not only will an army of Daleks be equipped with the dematerialization guns, but the Eye itself is to be turned into a single massive weapon which will be used to wipe the Time Lord home world of Gallifrey from existence.\n\nThe Doctor travels to Gallifrey to alert the High Council to the Daleks’ plans, bringing Cinder with him. Through her eyes, we see just how much the conflict has affected them. The Time Lords had always been aloof, arrogant figures. Now, driven to desperation by their war with the Daleks, the Doctor’s people have become utterly ruthless. When the Lord President Rassilon is informed of the danger in the Tantalus Spiral, he immediately decides to utilize a stellar engineering device known as the Tear of Isha to neutralize the Eye. The Doctor, however, realizes that this will wipe out all life in the Spiral, including the billions of humans imprisoned by the Daleks.\n\nCinder felt her heart lurch in her chest. She felt suddenly nauseous. They were going to do it. They were really going to murder every single living thing on a dozen worlds.\n\n“Rassilon,” said the Doctor, clearly exacerbated. “You’re condemning a billion souls to a terrible death. More. How can you even consider it?”\n\n“What are a billion human lives to us, Doctor?” said Rassilon. “They are but motes of sand on the breeze. They breed like a virus, infesting every corner of the universe. Where some die, others will take their place.”\n\nThere are several scenes in the novel featuring the Doctor and Rassilon sparring verbally. Reading them, I was left longing for an actual live-action version of Engines of War. It would be brilliant to have John Hurt and Timothy Dalton acting opposite one another, reciting all of this wonderfully dramatic dialogue.\n\nThe Doctor and Cinder realize that not only must they stop the Daleks, but also the Time Lords. With both sides of the conflict in opposition to them, the odds seem near-insurmountable.\n\nThere are a number of excellent moments throughout Engines of War. Even though the hierarchy of the Time Lords has become inured to the violence, to the cataclysmic loss of life, Mann indicates that the citizens of Gallifrey are genuinely frightened by the War. At one point, looking over the landscape of the Time Lord capital, Cinder observes hundreds of tiny lights drifting up into the night sky.\n\n“What are they?” said Cinder. “Paper lanterns?”\n\nThe Doctor shook his head. “No, although the principle is the same. Those are memory lanterns.”\n\n“Memory lanterns?” echoed Cinder.\n\nThe Doctor glanced at her. “They all think they’re going to die,” he said. “All those people down there think the Daleks are coming for them, and that they’re going to be exterminated.” He sighed, and the weariness in his expression spoke volumes. “So they’re recording all of their thoughts and memories into those lanterns, and scattering them through time and space. It’s the last act of a desperate people. They’re terrified that they’re going to be forgotten, so they’re seeding themselves into all the distant corners of the universe to be remembered.”\n\nI am curious about how much knowledge Mann had of the work that Moffat and his co-writers were doing on Series Eight when he was penning this novel. There are certain parallels. In “The Caretaker” the Doctor expressed his disdain for soldiers. In response, Danny Pink declared “I’m a soldier. Guilty as charged. You see him? He’s an officer!” Indeed, when we first see the Doctor in Engines of War, he is piloting his unarmed TARDIS, leading a large assembly of heavily-armed Battle TARDISes in an engagement with a Dalek fleet, organizing strategy, calling out orders to his fellow Time Lords; he is very much an officer.\n\nAt the end of Series Eight, in “Death in Heaven” Danny bitterly commented of the Doctor, “Typical officer, got to keep those hands clean.” That is a theme that also runs throughout Engines of War. Despite the fact that he has ostensibly embraced the role of warrior, the Doctor carries no weapons, only his sonic screwdriver. On both Moldox and Gallifrey he relies on Cinder to destroy Daleks and knock out Time Lord security guards. At one point, Rassilon’s obsequious lackey Karlax subjects Cinder to brutal interrogation by the Mind Probe, as much to verify the Doctor’s story as to fulfill his own sadistic glee. Cinder barely survives…\n\nShe gasped for air. “He’ll kill you,” she said, between shallow breaths. “He’ll kill you for this.”\n\nKarlax laughed. “Oh no, not the Doctor,” he said. “The Doctor and I are old playmates. He doesn’t like to get his hands dirty.”\n\nMann also addresses the suggestion made by Davies that “Genesis of the Daleks,” when the Time Lords dispatched the Doctor back in time to abort the creation of the Daleks and he hesitated at committing genocide, was actually the first shot fired in the Time War. Early on, seeing the horrific loss of life on Moldox, witnessing the atrocities being committed by the Daleks, the Doctor is burdened by the knowledge that if not for his indecision on Skaro many years before he might have prevented all this from occurring.\n\nTowards the end of the novel, the Doctor and Cinder come face to face with the Eternity Circle, the group of Daleks tasked by the Emperor with developing the temporal weapons. The head of the Circle explicitly refers to the Doctor’s presence at the birth of the Daleks\n\n“Ah,” said the Dalek. “The beginning of the Time War. The moment that you, Doctor, taught the Daleks their most valuable lesson of all — that emotion is a weakness that must be eradicated. That mercy has no place in victory.”\n\n“Not a weakness,” said the Doctor, “but a strength.”\n\n“If it had not been for your hesitation,” said the Dalek, its tone derisory, “for your inability to do what was necessary, then the entire War could have been prevented. The Daleks would have ceased to exist.”\n\nEngines of War is very much concerned with explaining exactly how the Doctor arrived at the point seen in “The Day of the Doctor.” What was it that finally drove him to solemnly declare, “No more,” to decide to utilize the Moment and wipe out the whole of the Time Lords and the Daleks? What was it that convinced him that there was no other choice?\n\nMann shows us a Doctor who, as the story opens, is already burned out, bone-weary from an unending nightmare conflict. And then he is faced with further horrors as both the Daleks and his own people pile atrocities upon one another, and each side reigns down scorn & mockery upon him for his perceived weakness and lack of resolve. When the novel finally comes to a close with the Doctor experiencing yet another soul-rending loss, you can fully imagine that this is a man who just wants it all to end, who will do anything to stop it, who will tell the Moment Interface “I have no desire to survive this.”\n\nIf there is a weakness to Engines of War, it is that perhaps it references the history of the series a little too heavily. It is inevitable that any novel set during the Time War is going to require allusions to a number of past events. Nevertheless, the nods to specific televised Doctor Who stories do come quite frequently. While for the most part Mann is able to fit them in seamlessly, on occasion they do feel superfluous. By the time a character starts playing the Harp of Rassilon, well, I couldn’t help but feel that Mann was overdoing it just a bit!\n\nWell, aside from that, and from events jumping back and forth between the different settings, Engines of War is a good read. Mann effectively delves into a previously little-explored period of the Doctor’s life. He is successful at not just conveying the cosmic scope of events only previously hinted at on the television series, but at utilizing them to explore the character of the Doctor. Mann also examines how a conflict that rages across myriad planes of reality would affect the average mortal person on the ground, viewing the staggering events of the Time War through Cinder’s eyes.\n\nAs I indicated earlier, for a variety of reasons it is very unlikely that we will ever be provided an in-depth look at the Time War on our television screens. Nevertheless, that conflict provides a rich backdrop against which to tell engrossing stories in other mediums. Engines of War by George Mann undoubtedly proves that potential."
