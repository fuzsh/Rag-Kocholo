        "text": "This section analyzes the semantics of locative out-verbs. Regarding spatial language, I will follow common assumptions: spatial relations are linguisticallly encoded against the backdrop of the spatial primitives figure, ground, place, and path (see among many others Talmy 2000, Jackendoff 1983:ch.9, Landau and Jackendoff 1993, Dirven 2010, Zwarts 2008). Figures are understood as entities that move or are located relative to some other entity, the ground. The path is conceived of as the figure’s trajectory or followed course relative to the ground, while place refers to the figure’s stative location relative to the ground. Similar assumptions are also uncontroversial regarding analyses of derived words with locative semantics, and have found their way into reference works (see e.g., Bauer et al. 2013:ch.16).\n\nThe next subsection illustrates general properties of locative out-verbs and the semantic patterns the construction occurs in. Section 3.2 models affix-base-interaction, while Sect. 3.3 generalizes over the findings and formulates lexeme formation rules.\n\n3.1 General properties and semantic patterns of locative out-\n\nThe data base\n\nLocative out- is an only marginally productive word-formation process, at least with respect to the number of different lexemes it has given rise to, and the analysis here is based on a mere 70 tokens from 57 types. This data set was compiled as follows. First, I searched both COCA and the BNC (see Davies 2004) via the query string in (3) on their respective web interfaces (available under https://www.english-corpora.org/). This string returns all forms that are tagged as verbs and that start with the characters <out> followed by any number of characters (up to the following space or punctuation):\n\n(3)\n\nout*_v*\n\nThe 2447 word forms that the search in (3) returned were then cleansed manually, and clearly different senses as well as clear corpus corruptions were discarded. This systematic procedure led to a data set of a total of 32 types, which allows for the conclusion that, synchronically, type frequency is indeed relatively low. The remaining 25 types were added as a result of unsystematically searching iWeb and the OED. Additional tokens were only added to the data set if two tokens of the same type showed some diverging semantic properties (see below).Footnote 1 All numbers below are based on the complete data set, i.e. on the 70 tokens.\n\nSyntactic and semantic patterns\n\nLocative out-verbs occur both intransitively, as in (4), and transitively, as in (5). Transitives make up around two thirds of the data (65%), intransitives roughly one third (35%).\n\n(4)\n\nA majority of the town’s younger populace out-migrates after completing high school... (COCA)\n\n(5)\n\nFederally endangered dry forest species to be outplanted in the Kaupulehu preserve. (COCA)\n\nThe attestations in (4) and (5) are representative of a clearly dominant semantic pattern in the data. Roughly 75% of all locative out-verbs in my data occur in directed motion structures (see e.g. Goldberg and Jackendoff 2004, Los et al. 2012:ch.5), for which I will use the term translocation in the following (see Kallmeyer and Osswald 2013:299f.). In all of these attestations, a figure-argument undergoes translocation along a path. Semantically, this argument is a theme (or patient or force recipient, depending on one’s preferred analysis), and is realized syntactically as subject in intransitives, as in (4), and as object in transitives (or subject in passives), as in (5). All transitive cases denote caused translocation, and they constitute the by far most frequent pattern with more than 60% of all locative out-verbs.\n\nThe locative out-forms in my data are not category-changing, i.e. we only find verbal bases.Footnote 2 In nearly all cases, the prefix is non-applicative, i.e. the morphological process does not add additional object arguments to the bases’ argument structures (see Haspelmath and Sims 2013:ch.11 on morphology and argument structure).Footnote 3 This is illustrated in (6a) and (6b) with non-prefixed counterparts to the examples (4) and (5), respectively.\n\n(6)\n\na.\n\n...the poor and excluded [...] are increasingly forced to migrate in find of work... (COCA)\n\nb.\n\nSome 30,000 students will plant trees in Mexico City... (COCA)\n\nIn a few cases, the prefix does have weakly applicative potential, namely in the form of particle incorporation (see Wunderlich 2012, McIntyre 2007). For example, as in (7a), to blast does not license a direct object, while out can license direct objects, both as a prefix, as in (7b), and as a particle, as in (7c).\n\n(7)\n\na.\n\n??The repellent will blast scent.\n\nb.\n\nMosquito repellent will outblast scent. (OED)\n\nc.\n\nJasmine ‘Clotted Cream’ [...] blasts out scent.Footnote 4\n\nOutside of straightforward translocation interpretations, we find a smaller number of slightly diverging, but related readings. First, a few cases denote metaphorical rather than literal motion, such as outprocess (8a), which refers to the administrative act of signing out from an army base. Second, at least the attestation in (8b) is directional rather than translocational, and it is not entirely clear which element would correspond to a figure argument. Third, the eventive nature of some forms is not entirely clear. For example, (8c) refers to a geological formation and thus suggests a stative rather than a dynamic interpretation (see Goldberg and Jackendoff 2004:543f. on the possibility of resultative analyses for similar stative example).\n\n(8)\n\na.\n\nThe MTL told me once I outprocess from Keesler I am off of their books [...] (iWeb)\n\nb.\n\nOscar De La Hoya [...] has gone on record this week stating two things that have made many people outlash at him (iWeb)\n\nc.\n\nThe graphite-rich rock is outcropping in a north easterly direction for approximately 3.75 kilometres before descending beneath cover (iWeb)\n\nFinally, as in the examples (9), we find a sub-pattern of locative out-verbs, in which the locative source-domain spatial region is semantically shifted to the target-domain population. Unlike the example in (8a), these items do not denote translocation. Rather, they locate the mating-events denoted by the respective base verbs to the exterior of, for example, an ethnic group in (9a) or a genus of grass in (9b), and thus give rise to interpretations of mating with non-members of the own group.\n\n(9)\n\na.\n\nBy the third generation, Hispanics as well as Asians are out-marrying by something like 60%. I mean, they marry somebody other than a Latino. (COCA)\n\nb.\n\nIncluded in that list is wheat, which [...] can outcross with bearded goatgrass, a problem weed in the western United States. (COCA)\n\nThe obvious question from a morphological vantage point concerns the contribution of the prefix to the semantics of the complex forms. Therefore, we will model prefix–base interaction for the main semantic patterns introduced above. As we will see, these patterns largely arise via the combination of a mereological constraint introduced by the prefix, the (path) semantics of the base verb, and partly additional locative arguments introduced via PPs.\n\n3.2 Prefix-base interaction in locative out-forms\n\nIn this section, I will show that the meaning component shared by all locative out-formations is a figure’s or an event’s non-containment in some bounded ground. Bounded grounds are understood as multi-dimensional regions that have an interior and an exterior (see Tyler and Evans 2003:ch.7). Let us begin the analysis with the major semantic pattern of locative out-, i.e. caused translocation, and introduce minor patterns, including non-caused translocation and population readings, as we go along.\n\nCaused translocation\n\nThe prefix’s contribution to locative out-verbs can be illustrated best by comparing an example of base verb semantics with its corresponding derivative semantics. Consider the attestations of to house and to outhouse in (10).\n\n(10)\n\na.\n\nThe city funded the four large display cases and agreed to house the collection at the Convention Center. (iWeb)\n\nb.\n\nThey tried taking their son and daughter-in-law with them for the last year, outhousing them at the hotel [...] (COCA)\n\nVerbs such as to house in (10a) belong the pocket-verb subtype of putting-verbs (see Rohde 2001:ch.6, Carrier and Randall 1992:177, Dixon 2005:106f. for putting verbs). These are derived via N→V-conversion, and refer to putting an entity at a location that is of the type denoted by the verb’s nominal base (see Levin 1993:121f.). They are thus lexical causatives that inherently include an agent who causes the goal-oriented translocation of a theme.\n\nFigure 2 provides a generalized frame for pocket-verbs (see Kawaletz 2021 on generalized verb frames). The frame depicts an event of type causation with attribute-value descriptions for both roles and sub-events (see Kallmeyer and Osswald 2013, Osswald and van Valin 2014, Plag et al. 2018; see Rappaport Hovav and Levin 1998, van Valin and LaPolla 1997 for the event structure of causative verbs in general). For pocket-verbs, the core participants in macro roles are causer, undergoer, and goal. The complex event splits up into two sub-events. The first sub-event is the cause, an underspecified activity on behalf of the causer in the more fine-grained role agent (causer and agent are co-referential and therefore co-indexed as ). The cause brings about the second sub-event, the effect, which is of type translocation and constitutes the locus of motion. The translocation-event’s theme, co-referential with the macro-event’s undergoer, undergoes movement along a path typed as goal_path by default. Finally, the generalized frame in Fig. 2 connects path and goal: the two mereological constraints at the bottom of the frame state that the path’s initial stage (init) is located outside the goal, i.e., ⊄ , while its final stage (end) is located inside the goal, i.e. ⊂ .Footnote 5\n\nNow, how does locative out- contribute to the semantics of a pocket-verb? The example in (10b) can roughly be paraphrased as ‘They put their son and daughter-in-law into the hotel, outside some other location’. Figure 3 is the instantiated frame for the example (10b) and the pertinent attribute-type pairs from the generalized frame in Fig. 2 are adjusted accordingly: They as causer and the son and his wife as undergoer of the macro-event, the hotel as goal etc.\n\nWhile we may infer that the location that the hotel is contrasted with is likely the home of the subject-argument, there is no indication that it serves as the translocation event’s source. Rather, out- integrates a bounded ground into the topological structure of the event denoted by the base to house. Capturing the assumption that something cannot be located outside of one-dimensional structures (see Tyler and Evans 2003:ch.7), I assume the type of ground that features in locative out-events to be constrained as in the attribute-type chain in (11). Grounds have a demarcated interior and exterior, and are typed bounded_spatial_region with attributes inregion and outregion of type spatial_region:\n\n(11)\n\na.\n\nbounded_spatial_region ⟶ inregion : spatial_region\n\nb.\n\nbounded_spatial_region ⟶ outregion : spatial_region\n\nFor the example in (10-b), the ground introduced by the prefix is spatially distinct from the goal and not directly attached to the path in Fig. 3. (12) provides the prose for the mereological relations stated at the bottom of the frame:\n\n(12)\n\na.\n\npath’s initial point is outside goal: ⊄\n\nb.\n\npath’s endpoint is inside goal: ⊂\n\nc.\n\ngoal is outside ground: ⊂\n\nThe following examples shows that the linguistic context may well lead to interpretations of out- upon which grounds are identical with sources. In (13), world knowledge at least suggests that the books in question were located at the museum prior to outhousing them, while (13b) introduces a source-goal path via the into- and from-PPs, respectively.\n\n(13)\n\na.\n\nWe are assured [...] by the Museum that care has been taken [...] to outhouse only books which are thought to be less frequently consulted. (OED)\n\nb.\n\nThe next morning, we out-loaded the compostable materials into the truck from the big window.\n\nIn all these cases, out- does not introduce a new sub-event, but expresses that the respective endpoints of the path are not contained in some bounded ground. The sole structural difference between them concerns the question of whether this ground functions as source (as in (13)) or not (as in (10-b)).\n\nIn summary, the event structures of the causative putting-verbs themselves remains untouched by the morphological process, and (lexicalized) goal components provide a natural attachment site for the prefix’s contribution. More generally, it is the base verbs’ lexical semantics that contributes motion, i.e. a path, which can be illustrated by a closer look at the very limited range of typical base verbs. Making use of VerbNet’s macro-classes (see Kipper et al. 2008), (14) provides examples from the most frequent base classes:\n\n(14)\n\na.\n\nputting-verbs: flood, pour, plant, load, station etc.\n\nb.\n\nemission-verbs: puff, stream, dribble, pop, radiate etc.\n\nc.\n\nsending and carrying-verbs: ship, drag, heave, thrust, haul etc.\n\nTypically, bases in the caused translocation pattern are from the classes in (14). These bases inherently include motion components in their semantics and, in their transitive variants, denote causation (cf. Levin and Rappaport Hovav 2019, Dixon 2005:ch.4, Levin 1993).\n\nNon-causative translocation\n\nFor illustration of an intransitive item of a locative out-derivative with translocation semantics, consider the example out-streaming in (15). This form is based on a substance-emission verb,Footnote 6 and in the attestation, gas is emitted from within a source (the stars) to their outside.\n\n(15)\n\nIn turn, gas out-streaming from the young stars in the clusters can feed and energise the black hole. (iWeb)\n\nI follow non-causative analyses for intransitive motion constructions (see e.g. McIntyre 2004, Rappaport Hovav and Levin 2001). This reasoning is based on the assumption that such events are not complex, and that their presumable sub-events are indistinguishable. For example, in (15) the gas’s traversal of a path and its streaming are spatially indistinct and occur at the same time, and thus constitute the same event. In the frame in Fig. 4, this is captured by the complex event type translocation ∧ substance_emission and the lack of a cause-effect structure. The specific type of emission is captured via a manner-attribute typed stream.\n\nThe event has two participants, the emittee gas and the source the young stars. Accordingly, the path is typed source_path. Most generally, the integration of out- into the structure works in identical fashion to the causative frame in Fig. 3: the contribution of the prefix is again modeled as non-containment. For the case at hand, however, the source and the introduced ground are identical, and therefore co-indexed as , and it is the path’s intermediate stage (inter; on the assumption that this is not necessarily its endpoint, see Zwarts 2008) that is set apart from the source via the relation ⊄ .\n\nRegarding the attestation in (15), we have just argued for the unification of the ground (introduced by the morphological process) with the source (provided via the from-PP). However, a more general feature of intransitives can be illustrated by the out-migrate-example in (16). Unlike for some transitive items (see e.g. (10-b)), sources are either explicitly given or can be at least be inferred for all intransitive examples in the data. In (16), for instance, the source is not realized as a PP, but can readily be inferred contextually as Ethiopia.\n\n(16)\n\nMany brave Ethiopian Moslems [...] were forced to out-migrate to safe heavens [sic] such as Eritrea and Sudan. (iWeb)\n\nPopulation interpretations\n\nFinally, let us look at the one pattern that is not (trans)locational in nature. The item in (17) is another example of the semantic shift ‘population-as-spatial region’ (see also the examples in (9) above). Here, outbreed refers to breeding with specimens from a different rat colony. This shows that in out-verbs of this type, the spatial meaning introduced by the prefix is responsible for the shift, that it is populations (or similar groups such as a genus) that are reconceptualized as grounds, and that the events denoted by the base are not semantically shifted as such. This pattern does not include any path-semantics, and the contribution of locative out- to the semantics of the base verb is best described as locating the entire event to the outside of the ground.\n\n(17)\n\nNaked mole rats breed readily enough with close kin. Although their preference is to outbreed, Faulkes says [...] (COCA)\n\nThe formalization for (17) is provided by the frame in Fig. 5. The frame describes a breeding activity with naked mole rats as (co-)actors. Crucially, these rats are from distinct colonies, tagged and , respectively. The frame captures the non-containment relation introduced by out- as follows: the metaphorical location of the breeding activity is identical with the co-actor’s colony, and thus co-indexed . In turn, the introduced ground is analyzed as identical with the actor’s colony (co-indexed ), while the relation ⊄ determines that the ground and the event location (and thus the two colonies) are spatially distinct.\n\nLet us wrap up the main points of the preceding analyses:\n\nLocative out- introduces a mereological non-containment relation between (metaphorical) spatial regions (or places).\n\nTypically, it is base verbs that introduce the motion component of translocation semantics, and one of the spatial regions includes the path’s end- or intermediate point, which is set apart from a contextually specified ground.\n\nThe specific nature of the path, as for example goal- or source-goal-path, is contextually determined (but all intransitive items have sources)\n\nWhenever sources or goals are realized, they form part of the introduced non-containment relation.\n\nThe following section provides a generalization over these findings by providing lexeme formation rules.\n\n3.3 Generalization: lexeme formation rules for locative out-\n\nLet us begin the generalization over locative out-’s properties by designing a preliminary lexeme formation rule. Lexeme formation rules (lfr), as made use of by authors in constraint-based formalisms such as HPSG (see Riehemann 1998, Koenig 1999, Müller 2002, Bonami and Crysmann 2016) and Sign-based Construction Grammar (SBCG) (see Sag 2012), are underspecified lexical entries that establish relations between some input, e.g. morphological base(s), and some output, e.g. a complex lexeme. They are derived via generalizations over attested examples and, by extension, over the lexicon. A note of caution is in place regarding the compatibility of the analyses presented here and by proponents of SBCG, respectively. SBCG (see e.g. Sag 2012, Michaelis 2004, 2015) makes use of an HPSG-style grammar architecture, while it represents the semantics component as an underspecified, non-decompositional reference to semantic categories from FrameNet (see e.g. Fillmore and Baker 2009). In contrast, the following semantic analyses will make use of Barsalou frames (see Sect. 2) instead of Fillmore frames. I will use Barsalou frames, and their representation as typed feature structures, for both the semantics proper and for the grammatical architecture as such.\n\nThe rule in Fig. 6 builds on the frame-based formalizations by Plag et al. (2018), Kawaletz (2021), and Andreou (2017), and makes use of typed-feature structures for the description of both a lexeme’s semantic and its non-semantic properties. This rule is applicable to all locative out-lexemes in the data. Being morphologically complex, these lexemes come with an attribute for their morphological base (m-base), whose value is another lexeme. The derivative’s phonology attribute (phon) is typed óut- ∨ out- , i.e. the complex form adds the prefix out- to the base’s phonology, while primary stress is variable and can fall on either the prefix or on the same syllable of the base that it falls on if the base is not prefixed with out-.Footnote 7 Base and derivative are both typed V for their syntactic category (cat), i.e. the rule derives verbs from verbal bases. With respect to the base’s semantics (sem ), the rule states that these lexemes denote eventualities.\n\nFor the discussion at hand, the essential claim of the frame in Fig. 6 is that the copy-and-override-mechanism ! captures out-’s meaning contribution. The !-tag indicates that the derivative semantics inherits the entire base semantics and adds the elements specified in the !-structure, which override elements from the base if the respective types are incompatible (see Sag 2012:119f., Andreou 2017:12f.).\n\nAs shown above, locative out- is a non-applicative process with derivatives inheriting most features of their respective bases. Most importantly, the rule in Fig. 6 does not add any sub-events to the base, and base and derivative semantics (i.e. and !) do not differ in semantic type. In turn, the introduced structure can unify with elements of appropriate types provided by the base or contextual information. Reconsider the different outhouse-tokens discussed above: for both examples, the goal provided by the base verb’s lexical semantics unifies with a location in Fig. 6, while the ground either remains unspecified (as in example (10-b)) or is identified with the path structure’s source that is inferred from context (see example (13-a)).\n\nThe reader may have noticed that information on the semantics of the base verb is kept to a minimum in Fig. 6, merely stating that bases denote eventualities with at least one participant. For morphological processes in general, the question of how narrowly defined the base semantics should be is a rather vexed one. This holds, in particular, for an underspecified rule of a fairly unproductive word-formation process, which nevertheless gives rise to several semantic sub-patterns with fairly different types of bases. In fact, stipulations on selectional restrictions are not always straightforward, even for single sub-patterns of locative out-.\n\nOn the one hand, the bases in the caused translocation pattern are highly predictably causative verbs with a motion component (see the examples in (14)), with very few metaphorical cases. In contrast, the paucity and the diversity of intransitive items do not easily allow for formulating base restrictions. Consider the case of non-causative translocation. First, with out-struggle in (18), we do find at least one base verb in the described pattern that does not inherently involve motion.\n\n(18)\n\nHe dragged on the tree root and out-struggled from the river [...] (COCA)\n\nSecond, restricting the possible input to bases that do introduce path semantics appears to also over-generate. Notably, for example, we do not find locative out- on pure manner of motion verbs, such as run or fly, or on inherently directional motion verbs such as exit or descend.\n\nIn the following, I will suggest to not state semantic properties of the base in any rule at all, but to specify sub-constructions of the semantic pattern laid out in Fig. 6 and provide attestations of derivatives that instantiate these sub-constructions. Building on previous accounts of how sub-constructions are organized in the lexicon (see e.g. Riehemann 1998, Koenig 1999, Booij 2010, Bonami and Crysmann 2016, Kawaletz 2021, Plag et al. 2018), the inheritance hierarchy in Fig. 7 models locative out- as a process that derives verbs from verbs (‘v-v-lfr’), and provides the common denominator of all sub-constructions as an abbreviation of the highly abstract rule in Fig. 6. This more general rule (tagged as construction for readability) then branches out into subpatterns, which both inherit parts of the structure provided by the supertype as well as specify other parts of that structure. In turn, the semantic subpatterns are linked to instantiations of out-derivatives provided at the bottom of the hierarchy.\n\nFor space reasons, Fig. 7 only includes three semantic patterns, while the three dots to the right-hand indicate that further sub-patterns may exist (as well as individual attestations not captured by the patterns modeled here). The patterns depicted here are the ones for which we have seen frame formalizations in Sect. 3.2: caused translocation (rule with causation semantics to the left), non-causative translocation (rule with event ∧ translocation semantics), and the population reading (rule with event semantics to the right). All of these sub-patterns are instantiations of their supertype, inherit their supertype’s phonology, and are compatible with their supertype’s semantics typed eventuality. Most importantly, all subtypes inherit the supertype’s mereological constraint ( ⊄ ), but specify this constraint in pattern-specific ways. Finally, at the bottom we find (partial) lists of complex out-verbs that instantiate the respective sub-pattens: for example, outhouse and out-ship for caused translocation, outpour and out-migrate for non-causative translocation, and outmarry and outbreed for the population pattern.\n\nIn summary, this section has modeled the word-formation process that gives rise to locative out-verbs as a hierarchy that connects a highly abstract lexeme formation rule to more specific lexeme formation rules, and connects these more specific rules to attested out-forms. All derivatives inherit the bulk of the semantic structure of their respective bases, and it is an underspecified mereological constraint that forms the semantic core that all derivatives share. Let us now turn to comparative out-verbs in the next section.\n\nThis section analyzes the semantics of comparative out-verbs. As will become obvious shortly, the name chosen for the construction in this study is a partial misnomer, and I will argue that comparison and scalarity only constitute one, albeit central facet of meaning at play. I will follow standard treatments and understand property scales as triples of information: i) a dimension of measurement such as speed, temperature, height etc., ii) a set of degrees along said dimension, and iii) an ordering relation among those degrees (see, among many others, Kennedy and McNally 2005, Kennedy 2007, Solt 2015).\n\nSection 4.1 introduces pertinent data and general properties of the construction and largely draws on the in-depth descriptive analysis in Kotowski (2021). In Sect. 4.2, individual attestations of out-tokens are decomposed in frames, while Sect. 4.3 develops a lexeme formation rule.\n\n4.1 Data and properties of comparative out-\n\nThe data base\n\nCompared to the data base for locative out-forms (see Sect. 3.1), the data base for comparative out-verbs has been compiled in less systematic fashion. It includes 543 types and more than 1,500 tokens, the majority of which are from iWeb and COCA, with fewer examples added from the BNC and Google searches. The primary reason for a relatively unsystematic compilation lies in the fact that comparative out- is a very productive process (see Schröder 2011) and that many further types could easily be found. At least in part, the database has a deliberate bias towards forms that are predicted to be ungrammatical in the literature, and thus answers back to theoretical predictions, both on the construction’s general semantics and its selectional restrictions (see Lieber 2016:ch.2.2 for a similar approach to other morphological phenomena).\n\nMore specifically, virtually all claims on selectional restrictions argued for in the literature are wrong (see Ahn 2022 and, in particular, Kotowski 2021 for overviews). I will come back to this point in Sect. 4.3, but will briefly mention that comparative out- is regularly category-changing and allows for adjectival (e.g. out-absurd), nominal (e.g. out-decibel), and occasionally phrasal bases (e.g. out-thank-you; all examples from COCA).Footnote 8 Similarly, putative restrictions on the lexical aspect of base verbs also prove far too restrictive. Although activity verbs and semelfactives feature most frequently as base (e.g., outplay, outrun, outblink, outsneeze), we find attestations with base verbs from all major aspectual classes. Examples include stative bases (e.g. out-know), achievements (e.g. outspot), causative result verbs (e.g. out-terrorize; all from COCA) as well as degree achievements (e.g. out-dry; iWeb).\n\nBasic syntactic and semantic patterns\n\nIrrespective of the base, however, comparative out-verbs come with their own, rigid argument structure. Passive constructions aside, these verbs invariably occur in syntactic frames of the kind [NP\\(_{sub}\\) out-V NP\\(_{obj}\\)]. If the morphological base is primarily intransitive, as to run in (19a), an object-argument has to be added as in (19b). Intransitive out-formations are odd across the board, e.g. (19c).\n\n(19)\n\na.\n\nCamels can run.\n\nb.\n\nMost camels can outrun most horses, but the fastest racehorse would probably outrun the fastest camel[...] (iWeb)\n\nc.\n\n??Most camels can outrun.\n\nAs shown in (20a,b), the construction allows for object-arguments that are otherwise not licensed by transitive base verbs (i.e. to drink selects for drinkables as object). Objects compatible with base verbs are typically unacceptable when the verbs are prefixed with out-, as in (20c).\n\n(20)\n\na.\n\n??We try to drink our friends.\n\nb.\n\nWe try to outdrink our friends and end up as alcoholics. (COCA)\n\nc.\n\n??We try to outdrink the beer.\n\nComparative out- is thus syntactically rigid and robustly creates its own argument structure. The nature of this argument structure, however, is contested.\n\nThere is agreement in the literature that the construction includes some form of conflation structure of a macro-event and one or more sub-event(s) (see, e.g., Talmy 2000 on conflation). However, authors disagree on whether the construction is primarily scalar-comparative or primarily causative-resultative. In consequence, there is disagreement on how to analyze the role of the object-argument. For example, in (19-b) we are dealing with a macro-event that is, depending on the analysis, either scalar-comparative (‘we drink more/faster/more frequently than our friends’) or causative (‘our friends are defeated/beaten in a drinking contest’). The distinction is a fundamental one, and any attempt at formalizing the construction calls for explicitness in this regard.\n\nBuilding on Kotowski (2021), the remainder of this section will defend the argument that the construction denotes competition. Neither a purely comparative approach (e.g., Ahn 2022, Tolskaya 2014, Williams 1992) nor a purely resultative approach (cf. McIntyre 2003) make correct predictions. Rather, the interpretations comparative out- allows for are located on a gradient along an axis of mere surpassment of the object-argument to predominantly causative-resultative semantics, with the better part of examples being compatible with both. Accordingly, a more suitable paraphrase for the natural interpretation of typical examples such as (19-b) is, roughly, ‘in running-competitions, camels usually defeat horses by running faster/farther etc. than horses run’. Put more technically, I will defend an analysis upon which events denoted by comparative out-verbs are causative, have a comparative core, and come with three subevents.\n\nFirst, a purely causative-resultative account, such as the one in (21) proposed by McIntyre (2003), does not predict that object-arguments are participants of sub-events other than a result state.\n\n(21)\n\na.\n\nFred outdrank Stan. [=ex.8b in McIntyre (2003)]\n\nb.\n\ndo(Fred,drink) &cause outdone(Stan)\n\nHowever, in all out-attestations in my data both subject- and object-arguments participate in distinct sub-events. The example in (22a), for example, gives rise to the clear inference of two distinct dancing-events that take the subject- and object-arguments as their respective participants. The same holds for a different outdance-token in (22b).\n\n(22)\n\na.\n\nI’m not saying she did everything else perfectly, but in those few minutes, she outdanced the rest of us. (iWeb)\n\nb.\n\n...when brides out-dance their last wedding guest... (iWeb)\n\nSecond, analyses such as (21-b) suggest no comparative component to the construction’s semantics. However, all examples in my data include comparison in the form of the subject-argument surpassing some threshold on a measure dimension of a scalar event property (see Solt 2015 for an overview on scalarity). As shown quantitatively by Kotowski and Schäfer (2023), classes of base verbs predict measure dimensions to substantial degrees. For example, Kotowski and Schäfer show in an iWeb study that 67% of lemma-dimension combinations of out-forms based on verbs from VerbNet’s exist class refer to the duration dimension, while 51% of verbs based on run lemmas refer to the speed dimension. At the same time, the majority of out-’s bases do not come with lexicalized scales, and scalar dimensions remain underspecified and in need of contextual disambiguation. For example, the contexts in (22a,b) show that outdance is at least attested with the dimensions quality (inferrable on the basis of perfectly) and duration (inferrable on the basis of last wedding guests).\n\nThird, the semantically thorniest issue concerns the question of whether out-formations are in fact causative and, in consequence, whether they include a result state. Typically, accomplishment structure is taken as a hallmark of resultative constructions. However, out-verbs do not allow for easy aspectual or event structural classification. Consider, for example, telicity tests, where (in)compatibility with temporal in- and for-adverbials is claimed to allow for testing for the distinction between processes and accomplishments (cf. Dowty 1979). However, we find attestations for an out-derivative such as outclass with both of these adverbials. The in-adverbial in (23a) leads to an interpretation that a tennis match is lost, while the for-adverbial in (23b) indicates that Boetsch had merely been dominated for ten minutes:\n\n(23)\n\na.\n\nThe first all-Australian women’s pairing to make the title match in Paris in 46 years, Dellacqua and Barty were outclassed in 66 minutes. (iWeb)\n\nb.\n\nAfter being thoroughly outclassed for ten straight minutes by an opponent no one expected him to defeat, a battered and bruised Tim Boetsch trudged back to his corner [...] (iWeb)\n\nThere is further evidence that out-verbs are event structurally peculiar. Even on the assumption that they are causative-resultative, their event structure does not necessarily consist of an activity as causing subevent and a change-of-state subevent. As shown by outspot in (24), the causing subevent can also include an achievement as situation type (or other types, see above). Note that, while the typically obligatory object argument of the base (cf. to spot something) is surpressed, it is still entailed (and even explicitly mentioned in the following subclause).\n\n(24)\n\nNot only was I able to quickly and easily undo the backlash in my friend’s line, but I was also able to outspot him when it came to seeing fish at a distance.Footnote 9\n\nWhile the aspectual class of comparative out-verbs thus cannot easily be determined, the existence of a result state is denied in purely comparative approaches. For example, Tolskaya (2014) claims that (25a) shows the lack of a result reading for outdance, as we presumably cannot deny the result without denying the process. Similarly, she claims that the test in (25b) provides evidence for a lack of change in the object-argument.\n\n(25)\n\na.\n\nThe girl did not outdance the giant, *though she danced the giant. [=ex.21c in Tolskaya (2014)]\n\nb.\n\nThe girl outdanced the giant, but nothing is different about him. [=ex.29a in Tolskaya (2014)]\n\nHowever, the test in (25a) is not a good one for determining event structure. If anything, it shows that to dance does not license object-arguments of the type giant, rather than that out-forms lack result states.Footnote 10 The problem in (25b) is more intricate. Typically, resultativity is understood in terms of concrete, physical changes-of-state (or location) of an argument (cf. Rappaport Hovav and Levin 2001, Goldberg and Jackendoff 2004, Jackendoff 1997). In fact, in some attestations, such as (26), the respective argument does undergo physical change.\n\n...\n\nif you do outsweat the jacket, it has large pit zips to dump heat. (iWeb)\n\nThe example in (26) is plausibly interpreted as ‘leaving the jacket overfull by sweating more than it is capable of absorbing/dispersing’, i.e. the jacket is clearly acted upon and enters a result state of being overfull. This is backed up by the What-X-did-to-Y- and What-happened-to-X-environments in (27) that test for resultativity and object-affectedness (cf. Jackendoff 1997, Rappaport Hovav and Levin 2001, Beavers 2011).\n\n(27)\n\na.\n\nWhat you did to the jacket was outsweat it.\n\nb.\n\nWhat happened to the jacket was you outsweated it.\n\nImportantly, the majority of out-attestations are compatible with such tests for object-affectedness. As shown in (28), this also holds for examples that do not suggest physical changes-of-state, such as the outdance-example in (22-a) above. Although typical out-examples thus do not encode physical changes-of-state, they do suggest notions of ‘being defeated’.\n\n(28)\n\na.\n\nWhat she did to the rest of us was outdance us.\n\nb.\n\nWhat happened to the rest of us was she outdanced us.\n\nFinally, a further, albeit circumstantial piece of evidence speaks against comparison as the sole semantic ingredient of comparative out-. As shown by Kotowski and Schäfer (2023) in an investigation of nearly 1,000 tokens from 12 out-derivatives, the majority of attestations do in fact not explicitly spell out the scalar dimensions necessary for any comparison. Although many of these attestation allow for inferences based on the dimensions typically associated with the respective base verbs, this state of affairs would appear unexpected if the construction was merely comparative in nature.\n\nIn summary, comparative out- is best described as a hybrid construction that denotes competition and introduces its own rigid argument structure. Neither purely scalar-comparative nor purely resultative approaches make correct predictions, and verbs of this kind do not allow for easy aspectual classification as accomplishments or processes. Typically, we will arrive at full-fledged interpretations only via interaction with contextual information on possible scalar dimensions and the nature of the sub-events (see e.g. Lieber 2016 and Andreou 2017 for the necessity in any theory of derivational semantics to allow for contextual interaction with word-formation processes). The following section proposes frame formalizations for several attestations including such contextual information.\n\n4.2 Modeling comparative out-\n\nThe strategy in this section will be as follows: I will present frame formalizations for selected attestations that allow us to capture both the invariable structure of comparative out- across examples as well as to reveal meaning components that show variability. Building on the discussion in the previous section, I will propose what we may call the constructional scaffold of the prefix, which includes:\n\nA complex event structure, i.e. a causative macro-event with two participants provided by the subject- and object-arguments.\n\nThree sub-events: first, a cause sub-event with the subject-argument as participant; second, a correlated sub-event with the object-argument as participant; third, a contextually determined sub-event that includes the object-argument as participant of a result state.\n\nA scalar-comparative component that is central to bringing about the result state, and therefore has to form part of the cause sub-event.\n\nAt the same time, the formalization of this invariable scaffold has to allow for variable elements that can be contextually specified (or remain underspecified). As we will see, these include the prominence of comparison, scale types and dimensions, the type of result state, and the similarity between the cause and the correlated sub-events.\n\nLet us begin the discussion with what we may call a typical out-attestation in (29). Abstracting away from modality and negation, the relevant part can be paraphrased as ‘in a chase, dolphins defeat predators by swimming faster’. The example suggests that both arguments engage in the same kind of activity, i.e. swimming, and via the underlined contextual clue, it specifies speed as the scalar dimension.\n\n(29)\n\n[...] at the fastest swimming speeds they observed, pregnant dolphins would not have been able to out-swim most predators. (iWeb)\n\nThe frame in Fig. 8 represents the semantics of (29) as a causative macro-event with two participants, causer and undergoer, and three subevents cause, correlate, and effect (see Sect. 3.2 for causation frames in general). The cause sub-event inherits its type swimming-activity from the morphological base and takes the subject-argument dolphins as agent (co-referential with the macro-event’s causer). The object-argument predators is coerced into the agent (co-referential with the macro-event’s undergoer) of a correlate-sub-event, which is inferred to also be of type swimming-activity. The effect describes the outcome of the causation event, i.e. the object-argument losing out, as the undergoer’s attained result state (typed defeated).\n\nWith respect to the comparative meaning component, the frame needs to capture two observations (see Sect. 4.1): first, we need to compare two distinct event properties and, second, the frame needs to reflect considerations of scope, as the comparative component has to be part of what brings about the effect sub-event. The frame in Fig. 8 captures these properties in the following way: First, both the cause and correlate events are measured out via measure dimension attributes (measure-dim). These attributes return as values complex types that consist of the conjunct of a scale type and a dimension type (see Zinova 2016 for a similar frame formalization of property scales). Here, these complex types consist of the property speed mapped to its associated property scale (prop-scale) for both the cause- and correlate sub-events. These complex types take degree-attributes (deg) that return the respective degree values α and β on the speed scale.\n\nIn order to compare α and β, we build on Löbner’s (2017) use of comparators, introduced as the attribute ‘©s,Rel( , )’ of value α. Comparators are two-place (or more-place) attributes that compare the values of multiple attributes and output a comparison value. In the notation used here, ‘©’ stands for ‘comparator’, ‘Rel’ for ‘relation’, and ‘s’ for ‘sort’: thus, a comparator establishes a relation between appropriate elements of the same sort, where sorts are exclusive partitions of the universe such as colors, materials, heights, temperatures etc. In the example at hand, the appropriate elements are degree values that allow for comparisons along the lines of the very scale they map to, i.e. the speed-scale (see Löbner 2017 for details and a general motivation of more-place comparators as attribute types in frames). The values the comparators take as input are co-indexed and ensure that we compare α and β. Reflecting the key ingredient of surpassment in out-prefixation, the comparison value in the comparative out-construction is always ‘>’, and indicates a higher value on a scale of ordered degrees.\n\nMore specifically, the locus of the comparator inside the cause sub-event reflects scope. As argued above, it is the cause’s surpassment of a threshold that brings about the effect, while typical out-attestations such as example (29) compare event properties provided by the cause and correlate, respectively. The comparator in the frame in Fig. 8 captures the necessary scopal relation by specifying the values to be compared, i.e. and , respectively, and by specifying that value is part of the cause sub-event, while the frame as a whole retains the conventional scope of cause-effect structures.\n\nLet us now look at another example that provides evidence for semantic elements that allow for vagueness. In particular, neither the scalar dimensions that underlie comparison nor the sameness of the cause and correlate sub-events are fixed on the lexical level. In (30), we find another outswim-attestation that suggests a chase. In contrast to (29), however, the context clearly shows that the object-argument (a hippo) is engaged in a running-activity rather than in a swimming-activity. Moreover, the underlined part allows for the inference that the two sub-events are compared on the basis of their respective duration rather than speed.\n\n(30)\n\nHippos cannot swim [...] they will basically run underwater [...] They also don’t tire easy, so you better have good cardio to outswim one. (iWeb)\n\nNow, the question arises as to how frame representations allow for such variability of the comparative component? Fig. 9 represents the frame for (30) as structurally equivalent to the one in Fig. 8, i.e. we find the same kind of causative macro-event with the same number and types of sub-events. The relevant differences between (29) and (30) are represented as type differences. First, in Fig. 9, the cause and correlate sub-events are typed differently as swimming-activity and running-activity, respectively. Second, the basis of comparison is not the dimension speed, but duration, as reflected in the respective types of the measure-dim-attributes of both sub-events. The formalizations of the respective comparative component in both Figs. 8 and 9 capture the possibility of comparing swimming activities to other activities along different dimensions via the attachment site of the comparator attributes. Formally, this is achieved by not comparing events as such (e.g. cause and correlate), but by attaching the comparator attribute to deeply embedded types, namely to the degree value of a property scale inside the sub-events.\n\nThis raises more general questions of what can be compared via comparative constructions and, concerning out-prefixation, which kinds of events allow for comparison along which kinds of dimension (see e.g. Doetjes 2010, Kennedy 1997 for discussions of incommensurability in adjectival comparisons; see Kotowski and Schäfer 2023 for base-driven preferences of dimensions in out-prefixation). In my out-data base, there are no comparisons across different dimensions. More technically, this suggests that dimension types, such as speed, duration, or temperature, constitute different sorts, and are incompatible with each other. If this generalization is correct, comparators as made use of in Figs. 8 and 9 above will only apply to equally typed measure-dim-attributes.\n\nA similar restriction applies to scale type and the possibility of comparing degrees on property scales with cardinalities on cardinality scales. Consider the following example in (31), where comparison is not based on properties but on cardinalities (cf. Solt 2015 on cardinality scales):\n\n(31)\n\nThere was an old boy with ‘a lifetime of badges’ on his hat. Excuse me, but we have those too. (Step forward Lil Kemp who could outbadge him any day).Footnote 11\n\nThe example in (31) can plausibly be paraphrased as ‘Lil Kemp’ defeats the old boy in a contest on who owns more badges’. On this interpretation, both cause and correlate sub-events are stative. While the example may equally well refer to badges worn rather than possessed, the comparative nature is crucially based on the number of badges (most likely of their preferred soccer clubs), i.e. a cardinality.Footnote 12 There are no examples in my data that compare property scales with cardinality scales, i.e. we do not find comparisons of, say, the speed of a running-event with the frequency of running-events, i.e. with a cardinality. I take this to be reflected in constraints in the type signature, so that cardinality scales and property scales are incompatible (32a), that property scales do not take cardinality attributes (32b), and that cardinality scales do not take degree attributes (32c):\n\n(32)\n\na.\n\ncardinality scale ∧ property scale ⟶ ⊥\n\nb.\n\nproperty scale ⟶ cardinality ⟶ ⊥\n\nc.\n\ncardinality scale ⟶ degree ⟶ ⊥\n\nThe frame in Fig. 10 models the semantics of (31) as a comparison between the numbers, i.e. cardinalities, of entities encoded by the theme arguments of two stative eventualities in cause and correlate, respectively. Accordingly, these two sub-events are both typed possession_state, their participants are possessors, and the comparator accesses the cardinality values α and β that measure out the respective eventualities. Structurally as well as with respect to further types, the rest of the frame corresponds to those presented in Figs. 8 and 9.\n\nThe final loci of variable semantic structure in out-formations concern the very elements that are being compared, the prominence of comparison, and the kind of result state. Consider the example in (33).\n\n(33)\n\nWhatever you do to stay active this summer, make sure to stay hydrated and to properly fuel with healthy meals pre and post-burn. And remember, you can never outrun a crappy diet! (iWeb)\n\nA natural interpretation of the outrunning-scenario in (33) appears to be roughly ‘cancel out the consequences of a poor diet by running (a certain time or distance or a certain number of times etc.)’. I suggest the following analysis: the object-argument crappy diet is coerced into a causative correlate event ,Footnote 13 in which the consumption of low quality food and drink results in a state of poor health. In turn, the overall macro-event, i.e. outrunning a crappy diet, constitutes a causation event that nullifies the effect of the embedded correlate event. In consequence, the frame for the example in (33) in Fig. 11 depicts the by now familiar structure of a causative macro-event with three sub-events and two participants (i.e. the syntactic subject- and object-arguments). However, we find differently typed events for the cause (a running-activity) and the correlate sub-events (causation). The analysis thus shows that the cause and correlate sub-events can be conceptually distinct and may even differ in semantic type.\n\nUnlike in the examples discussed previously, the example in (33) and the formalization in 11, show that it is not necessarily embedded values of scalar attributes in cause and correlate that are being compared. First, on any conceivable interpretation, crappy diets cannot run (or move, more generally), and it also seems impossible to coerce such a reading. Second, the very kind of scale to be applied remains underspecified (as the addendum in parentheses to the above paraphrase indicates).\n\nThe frame in Fig. 11 provides a principled way of treating scalar underspecification in out-forms. First, the measure-dim attribute within the cause remains underspecified with respect to scale and dimension types. Thus, it is of the scalar supertype ‘scale (∧ dimension)’ and allows for property scales (with different dimensions) as well as cardinality scales. More importantly, however, the comparator attribute (i.e. ‘©\\(_{\\tiny{s,Rel}}\\) ( , )’) does not take a value of a measure dimension from the correlate sub-event as input. Rather, the second comparative element is provided by a threshold value that is merely determined by the correlate (cf. determined-by ). In prose, we thereby ensure that it is the bad diet that determines the value β that α exceeds, while the nature of these values as degree-values or cardinality-values is not spelled out.\n\nIn the following section, I generalize over both the scaffold and the variability presented in this section. I formulate a lexeme formation rule that identifies structurally fixed elements, including those with a fixed type as well as those that are underspecified.\n\n4.3 Generalization: lexeme formation rule for comparative out-\n\nThe above discussion has shown that we may conceive of comparative out- as a process that introduces a fairly rigid scaffold of semantic structure. At the same time, however, this structure is underspecified. Importantly, we have seen that underspecification is typically not resolved on the lexical level, as shown by the different properties of different tokens of the same out-lemmas, such as the outdance-examples in (22) or the outswim-examples in (29) and (30). In contrast to what I have proposed for locative out- in Sect. 3.3, the following proposal will not be one of different semantic patterns that each give rise to different lexeme formation rules. Rather, I formulate a single rule that provides both the required structural rigidity and the necessary flexibility.\n\nConsider the lexeme formation rule in Fig. 12. The general conceptual idea behind this rule is identical to the one behind the locative rule in Fig. 6. It describes in frame format an underspecified lexical entry of a complex lexeme and establishes relations between this lexeme and its morphological base (as in Plag et al. 2018, Kawaletz 2021, Andreou 2017). More specifically, the rule describes a lexeme with a phonology out- , where is placeholder for the stressed phonology of the base,Footnote 14 it invariably outputs verbs (cat V), and has attributes for its semantics and morphological base (sem and m-base, respectively). Let us first comment on the complex lexeme’s sem-attribute, before we discuss its relation to the morphological base.\n\nThe rule in Fig. 12 states that all comparative out-verbs invariably denote causation events, with the two participants causer and undergoer , and with three sub-events cause !, correlate , and effect . As we have seen, cause and correlate can encode different types of events, such as activities, causative events, or states, depending on the morphological base and context (see e.g. examples (31) and (33)). Accordingly, they are not fixed to any specific event type and merely provided with the supertype eventuality that will also inform the nature of their participants (see e.g. Maienborn 2019 on eventuality types). The participants of the sub-events are, irrespective of the individual sub-events’ nature, invariably linked to the macro event’s participants: the causer is co-referential with the cause’s participant and the undergoer is co-referential with the correlate’s participant. The effect, in contrast, is defined as a change-of-state of the macro-event’s undergoer, whose result state has to be specified contextually.\n\nRecall that, with regard to the scalar-comparative component of the construction, we need to ensure three key ingredients. First, the analysis here rests on the empirically well-supported assumption that comparison brings about the macro-event’s effect, and thus needs to be attached to the cause sub-event. Second, it needs to allow for flexibility regarding scale type. Third, it needs to allow for either comparison of event properties (or cardinalities) of cause and correlate or for the mere surpassment of a threshold value. The first condition is tackled straightforwardly by making the comparator attribute ‘©\\(_{\\tiny{s,Rel}}\\) ( , )’ attach to the degree or cardinality value inside the cause. Similarly, underspecification of scale type and dimensions for property scales are ensured by typing the measure-dim attribute as the supertype scale that encompasses both cardinality and property scales in the type hierarchy (see also Zinova 2016). Finally, the rule provides flexibility of what is being compared in the following way: The comparator states that it is value (i.e. α) that exceeds value (i.e. β), where α measures out the cause itself, while β constitutes the value of the threshold. In all cases, even those that do not allow for directly comparing cause and correlate such as the crappy-diet example in (33), the threshold is determined by the correlate event via determined-by .\n\nTechnically less straightforward is the question of how we ensure the default case, upon which we compare properties of these two sub-events. The lexeme formation rule does so via the conditional constraint formulated at the bottom of the AVM: ‘iff ≃ ⟶ ≜ ’. In prose, this constraint says the following: if the measure-dim attributes of the two sub-events are similar or equal (for example both applying to a property scale with the dimension speed), the threshold value β (i.e. ) is structurally identical to the scalar value γ (i.e. ) provided via the correlate’s measure-dim attribute.\n\nLet us finally comment on the morphological base, and how its properties are connected to the properties of the complex lexeme in Fig. 12. As briefly mentioned at the beginning of Sect. 4.1, and shown far more comprehensively by both Kotowski (2021) and Ahn (2022), comparative out- is highly promiscuous regarding the input it allows. This does not only hold for the syntactic category or aspectual type of the base form, but also for its ontological class more generally. Consider the examples in (34), which are preceded by a short classification of their ontological type and syntactic category.\n\n(34)\n\na.\n\ncausative accomplishment verb: Bojemoi, that woman has toes that could outcrush a boa constrictor!”Footnote 15\n\nb.\n\ndegree achievement verb: [...] the bananas on top of my refrigerator and kitchen cabinets ripened into snacking status the fastest.

(iWeb)\n\nThe list of examples with different properties in (34) could in fact be continued, which serves to show that formulating hard-and-fast selectional restrictions for this prefix is misguided. Accordingly, the rule in Fig. 12 is highly liberal regarding the properties of the morphological base. This holds for its type in general (lexeme ∨ phrase), its syntactic category (‘V, N, A, Phrase’), and its semantic type (eventuality ∨ entity ∨ property). Irrespective of this input, however, the output is by far more determined, and has the capacity to override the base properties. Let us focus on the semantics, and the inheritance mechanism I assume.\n\nMost importantly, it is the complex lexeme’s cause sub-event that inherits the base form’s semantics, as indicated by the tags and !, respectively. This can be illustrated by the following examples in (35) ((35b,c) partly repeated from (19-b) and (33), respectively):\n\n(35)\n\na.\n\nWhen you are running a marathon, about an hour or two in you feel a feeling of euphoria... (iWeb)\n\nb.\n\nMost camels can outrun most horses, but the fastest racehorse would probably outrun the fastest camel... (iWeb)\n\nc.\n\nAnd remember, you can never outrun a crappy diet! (iWeb)\n\n(35a) shows that the morphological base to run is an activity verb, i.e. it denotes dynamic and durative events without an implied endpoint (see e.g. Filip 2011). The out-form’s general semantic type, however, is never of type activity, but of type causation. For typical examples, such as (35b), we find the base’s semantics inherited by the cause and we can infer that the correlate sub-event is of the same type (here, running-activity). However, examples such as (35c) show that this inference regarding the correlate’s semantic type does not hold across the board (see the frame in Fig. 11).\n\nIn very many cases, inheritance of the base’s general semantic type by the derivative’s cause, i.e. ! inheriting from , is unproblematic, as for both (35b) and (35c). One problem arises with base verbs that are obligatorily transitive, but cannot realize their usual object-argument in an out-prefixed form. One such examples is outcrush in (34-a) above: the resultative base verb to crush has an obligatory patient-argument that cannot be realized with the complex form outcrush. Implicitly, however, such examples seem to include attributes for their base’s arguments, and I take the problem they pose to be one of the syntax-semantics interface rather than the semantics proper.\n\nMore frequently, however, the base does not denote an eventuality to begin with, as for example in the outbadge-example in (31) above, as well as in examples (34-c) to (34-e). For instance, for the base and derivative of outpriest in (34-d), we may assume a type hierarchy clash of the form ‘sem : person-entity ∧ sem !: eventuality ⟶ ⊥’. As described in Sect. 3.3, the !-notation stands in for a copy-and-override mechanism, i.e. inheritance except for stated differences. In the case of type mismatches, the rule in Fig. 12 thus assumes the morphological process to overwrite its base and shift the base semantics to the suitable eventuality type in the derivative semantics. The rule does not make any concrete suggestions to this end, and I will remain non-committal regarding the general problem of how we derive eventuality-readings from non-eventuality-denoting bases. Possible candidates for such a mechanism include coercive processes (as in Michaelis 2004, Audring and Booij 2016, Booij and Audring 2018, or Nagano 2018), metonymical processes (see Baeskow 2021), or referential shifts to embedded eventualities in non-eventive base structures (see e.g. Kotowski et al. 2023, Schneider 2023).\n\nIn summary, this section has modeled the word-formation process that gives rise to comparative out-verbs as a fairly complex and underspecified lexeme formation rule. This rule incorporates both invariable elements (in particular, event structure, argument structure, and a comparative component) and a variety of underspecified types and attributes that reflect the variability we find, even for different tokens of the same out-lemmas. Let us now take stock, compare properties of locative and comparative out-verbs, and comment on their relationship in the next section."
