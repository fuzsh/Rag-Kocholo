        "text": "Actor Film Year Reason Trevor Howard Dr. No 1961 He was first considered by Kevin McClory for the abandoned Longitude 78 West film project, which was later revamped into the novel Thunderball. Ian Fleming disagreed feeling Howard, at 43 years, was too old for the role.[1] He was again considered by Albert R. Broccoli for Dr. No.[2] Stanley Baker He would not commit to a three-picture contract.[3] Rex Harrison He was turned down in favour of Connery.[4] David Niven He was turned down in favor of Connery (later played Bond in the 1967 parody Casino Royale) (Fleming's personal choice).[4] Richard Todd He was Ian Fleming's first choice for the role, but scheduling conflicts prevented him from getting it.[5] Jeremy Brett On Her Majesty's Secret Service 1967 He feared the role would harm his career.[6] Peter Purves Prior to becoming a Blue Peter presenter, Purves auditioned for the role of 007 but was unsuccessful.[citation needed] Michael Caine He did not want to be typecast in spy films, having previously starred in the three Harry Palmer spy films. Robert Campbell George Lazenby won the role based on a screen-test fight scene.[7] Michael Bishop Father of comedian Des Bishop, who later wrote his biography, entitled My Dad Was Nearly James Bond.[8][9][10] Patrick Mower Reason unknown.[11] Daniel Pilon Harry Saltzman felt he was too young; aged 27 at the time.[12] John Richardson George Lazenby won the role based on a screen-test fight scene.[7] Anthony Rogers Terence Stamp His ideas for future films felt too radical for producer Harry Saltzman.[13] Hans De Vries George Lazenby won the role based on a screen-test fight scene.[7] Eric Braeden 1968 Albert R. Broccoli at first thought he was British and so considered him.[clarification needed] However, Broccoli, who believed that no one from outside the Commonwealth would be suitable as James Bond, decided against him after finding he was German American.[14] Peter Snow He auditioned for On Her Majesty's Secret Service but was rejected by Broccoli and Saltzman for being too tall (6'5\").[15] Oliver Reed 1969 The producers did not want to spend the time or money needed to reshape Reed's poor public image.[16] Timothy Dalton 1969â€“1972 He thought himself too young and did not wish to follow Connery. He declined the role again in 1979, before finally being cast in 1986. Roger Green Diamonds Are Forever 1970 He filmed a screen test with Imogen Hassall, but was turned down in favor of Connery.[4] Simon Dee Live and Let Die 1971 Put forward to follow Sean Connery, (despite being thought of by most people as a talk show host, rather than an actor).[citation needed] William Gaunt Auditioned for the role as Bond for Live and Let Die but lost the role to Roger Moore. John Gavin Diamonds Are Forever,\n\nLive and Let Die\n\n1971, 1973 Was signed as the first American Bond after George Lazenby quit, but Sean Connery decided to return to the role instead. He was considered again for Live and Let Die, but was denied as producers felt Bond should remain British. Simon Oates Was strongly considered but turned down when Sean Connery returned and was working on other projects when Roger Moore was selected.[17] Ranulph Fiennes Live and Let Die 1972 For having \"hands too big and a face like a farmer\".[18] Peter Laughton Broccoli remarked that he would have been chosen had he auditioned for On Her Majesty's Secret Service. However, following the casting of Lazenby, the producers were wary of choosing actors with limited or no acting experience and decided to settle with Moore.[19] Guy Peters The producers wanted to cast an actor with a \"known face\".[20] Timothy Dalton For Your Eyes Only 1979 Turned the role down for a second time as he did not like the direction the series was taking. He would eventually be cast in 1986 for The Living Daylights. David Warbeck Was under contract to Eon as a 'reserve Bond' in case Moore quit, but Moore returned.[21] Michael Jayston 1980 Role up for grabs when Roger Moore was considering quitting but Moore returned.[22] Jayston eventually portrayed the character in 1990 for a two-part BBC radio drama.[23] Patrick Mower Auditioned when Roger Moore was considering quitting, but Moore returned[22] Lewis Collins Octopussy 1982 Collins claims the producers thought he was too aggressive.[24] Ian Ogilvy 1983 Roger Moore agreed to return. James Brolin Screen-tested for Octopussy, was lined up for the part, even going so far as buying a house in London for the production, before Roger Moore once again agreed to return. Pierce Brosnan The Living Daylights 1986 Became front runner for The Living Daylights after Timothy Dalton could not take the part due to his commitment to Brenda Starr. However, Brosnan's option to star in a further season of Remington Steele was taken up by NBC, and EON refused to have him do both Steele and Bond at the same time. Fortuitously, Dalton became available again at just that time, and so reaccepted the role, which he played until 1989. Brosnan would later play Bond from GoldenEye through to Die Another Day. Daniel Pilon Timothy Dalton was chosen for the role.[25] Sam Neill Although he impressed producers as Reilly, Ace of Spies, Neill lost out to Timothy Dalton for this iteration of Bond. Antony Hamilton Was in negotiations with the producers before Timothy Dalton was chosen. Mel Gibson 1987 Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer wanted him for the role, but was rejected by Broccoli for not being British.[26] Christopher Lambert French accent prevented him from being chosen.[27] Neil Dickson Timothy Dalton was chosen. Mark Greenstreet Told Terry Wogan in an interview that he was given a screen test for Bond but lost out to Timothy Dalton. Finlay Light The little-known Australian model was one of the main contenders for the role in The Living Daylights, even signing a ten-year contract. Timothy Dalton was chosen anyway. Andrew Clarke One of the most popular Australian actors of the 1980s, Clarke was considered but lost out to Dalton. Simon MacCorkindale Timothy Dalton was chosen. Sean Bean GoldenEye 1994 Was the second choice for EON if Timothy Dalton did not return; however, MGM overruled on both counts, and Pierce Brosnan was given the part. The producers were still impressed, and gave him the part of the villain Alec Trevelyan, rewritten from its original mentor part to become a direct parallel of Bond as Agent 006. Mark Frankel Pierce Brosnan was chosen for the role.[28] Paul McGann Was given an audition and impressed producers; however, MGM still insisted on Pierce Brosnan for the role. It is believed that McGann would have stepped in if Brosnan turned down the role. Lambert Wilson Pierce Brosnan was chosen for the role.[29] Henry Cavill Casino Royale 2005 The preferred choice of director Martin Campbell; however, was deemed too young to portray Bond.[30] Sam Worthington Daniel Craig was chosen for the role.[30] Rupert Friend Daniel Craig was chosen for the role.[31] Julian McMahon Daniel Craig was chosen for the role.[32] Matthew Rhys Did not impress the producers.[33] Alex O'Loughlin Daniel Craig was chosen for the role. References to Bond were featured in the reboot of Hawaii Five-0 during the first season. The seventh and eighth seasons of the rebooted Hawaii Five-0 feature a recurring MI6 agent portrayed by Chris Vance (as MI6 agent Harry Langford) in 3 episodes.[34] Clive Owen The producers were unwilling to provide gross profit points.[35] Dougray Scott Reason unknown.[36]"
