        "text": "This is a new thread in \"what if\"-category - Lets say Roger Moore had said goodbye after Octopussy and Timothy Dalton had taken over as 007 in A view to a kill. Thats not too far from reality since Moore threaten to quit before and Dalton had been in Broccoli's mind before. AVTAK would of course been a totally different film than as we know it.\n\nHow would the introduction of Dalton as Bond looked like? The story? The casting? Would we have a story closer to the Fleming short story? We could only speculate but in my mind it's a thrilling thought.\n\nIt would of worked suprisingly well actually.\n\n- The PTS would have felt fresher, as Moore had already done a ski chase in TSWLM.\n\n- The horse stable scenes would have featured a young Bond trying to blend into high society and perhaps not always succeeding. An interesting concept.\n\n- Dalton would have been closer to the ages of the film's Bond girls.\n\n- Given the action in Paris, San Franciso, and later on the air balloon, you would have to say that Bond was quite recklessly dangerous in AVTAK. A first time Bond actor would have suited this gung-ho approach. Think Daniel Craig with the knife in the casino.\n\nThe only problem I have atm is the scene with Pola in the bathtub. Said scene revolved around two agents with a history, and Moore was more suited to that sub-plot than a young Dalton.\n\nHmmm... I watched AVTAK last night and it truly is horrid. Not that the plot is poor, but it just seems really bland and unoriginal. Roger Moore didn't help out that fact. I love Rog, but the whole routine just got really old by this one.\n\nWhat's strange is that I can't think of a specific reason why the movie sucks. I mean, it IS pretty dark (sans the Beach Boys scene), the villain is great, and the score is pretty cool (but again, probably more fitting for Dalton). However, Grace Jones was an extremely unattractive \"bad\" Bond girl, the ending seemed anti-climatic, Tanya Roberts was way too young for Roger, and the typical Rog touchstones had gotten really stale by this time. Typical pre-title sequence (though, unlike the previous three films, this actually had something to do with the main story), Bond meets M in his office, and so on and so forth. Overall, there was just something extremely unappealing about this movie.\n\nI really do wonder what a Timothy Dalton-starring film would have been like. Obviously, it would have been MUCH more watchable. But I wonder what effect his casting would have on the rest of the film.\n\nThere would have been no Beach Boys, thats for sure.\n\nGo back even further. Imagine TD taking the role for For Your Eyes Only. Roger was taking about leaving the role after Moonraker. Too bad he didn't. The circumstances to what is happening now with Casino Royaale are very similar. Moonraker was over the top and too far fetched, like Die Another Day. FYEO was a back to basics story, like Casino Royale. FYEO was almost tailor made for Dalton's interpretation of Bond. A different opening eliminating the Blofeld teaser and starting with the sinking of the ship then introducing Dalton as he runs into Melina would have been a great way to have started his Bond career. FYEO, Octopussy and AVTAK would have had more subtle humor(no Beach Boys, get an Ice cream or alligator submarines)and more realistic fights, no stunt men substitutes. Imagine Tim's Bond legacy had done 5 films instead of 2 starting with FYEO.\n\nAlas it was not meant to be and we are left with 2 films that have been judged rather harshly by the masses and many Bond fans. Thankfully there are those of us who are able to appreciate these two films while we lament the lost opportunities and possibilities of Dalton's Bond.\n\nI would have preferred Dalton to make GE rather than AVTAK. That said, I think the movie would have (hopefully) much different with Dalton. As other have pointed out, the Beach Boy's would have been gone. Less slapstick and I hope they would have cast someone other than Tonya Roberts.\n\nThe only problem I have atm is the scene with Pola in the bathtub. Said scene revolved around two agents with a history, and Moore was more suited to that sub-plot than a young Dalton.\n\nFiona Fullerton who played Pola Ivanova was born in 1956. Timothy Dalton was born in 1944 (or 46, depending on the source), so I don't see where this would have been an issue."
