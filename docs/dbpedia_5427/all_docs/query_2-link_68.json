        "text": "Note: designating a film as, “best,” and, “worst,” is born from averaging various critical ratings from sites like Rotten Tomatoes, Metacritic, and IMDb.\n\nInstead of, “ranking,” the Bond actors I think I’m just going to analyze them: talk about their strengths and weaknesses as a whole. Things like that. Because ranking Bonds is purely a matter of opinion and while I may talk about my opinion in this piece I will mainly talk about the 007′s.\n\nSean Connery (1963-1967, 1971)\n\nFilms: Dr. No, From Russia with Love, Goldfinger, Thunderball, You Only Live Twice, Diamonds Are Forever\n\nBest film: Goldfinger\n\nWorst film: Diamonds Are Forever\n\nDesignation: The Tough Guy\n\nConnery would define the Bond franchise and every Bond actor to follow, in both a good and bad way. His first four films are classics, with Goldfinger being the Bong film all others aspire to be. While You Only Live Twice hasn’t aged very well (it could quite possibly be the most racist and misogynistic film the series) it's still not a bad film. Diamonds Are Forever was the beginning of over-the-top Bond with kinda campy elements, a category Connery didn’t fit well in (he also returned to the role because of a paycheck and it shows in his performance).\n\nWhat makes Connery interesting to watch is that he was able to define who Bond was and so had a sort of free reign with the character. He was the most human of the 007′s until Daniel Craig came along, showing fear and anger often in his films. In those first four films you can tell he seems to be really enjoying the part, and therefore we enjoy watching him in them.\n\nThe reason Connery is designated as, “The Tough Guy,” of 007s is because he was very much a man’s man of the era. He hits women to interrogate them, but he’s also very rough with all the other villains and henchmen of the series too. Bond creator Ian Fleming was originally hesitant to see blue-collar Connery as the upper class 007 but was so impressed by his performance he changed Bond’s family tree to reflect Scottish heritage and that’s all because of Connery.\n\nGeorge Lazenby (1969)\n\nFilms: On Her Majesty’s Secret Service\n\nBest film: On Her Majesty’s Secret Service\n\nWorst film: On Her Majesty’s Secret Service\n\nDesignation: The Romantic\n\nDesignation one film as best or worst when it comes to George Lazenby is rather redundant because - unfortunately - he only appeared in one Bond film.\n\nLazenby gets a bad wrap, as most of the press had decided he would suck as James Bond before even seeing the film (mostly because he wasn’t Sean Connery). But here’s the thing: Lazenby isn’t a bad Bond and On Her Majesty’s Secret Service is actually a VERY good movie. Bond has more personal stakes in it than he has in any other film, he is emotionally vulnerable and even cries in the film. He is more tender with women then Sean Connery was, and that is why he gets the designation of, “The Romantic,” Bond.\n\nRoger Moore (1973-1985)\n\nFilms: Live and Let Die, The Man with the Golden Gun, The Spy Who Loved Me, Moonraker, For Your Eyes Only, Octopussy, A View to a Kill\n\nBest film: The Spy Who Loved Me\n\nWorst film: A View to a Kill\n\nDesignation: Gentleman Spy\n\nWhen it comes to the quality of Roger Moore’s work on the 007s films (and the quality of the films themselves) it’s a bit of a roller coaster. You start off kinda high with Live and Let Die and then you drop down with The Man with the Golden Gun before skyrocketing with The Spy Who Loved Me. And while there’s a bump in the ride with Moonraker you stay on that high with For Your Eyes Only only to come down with Octopussy and A View to a Kill. Unfortunately, Moore’s tenure as Bond did drop because he stuck with the role for too long. He got too comfortable with it, and Bond became too comfortable, whereas Bond should always have a bit of edge to him.\n\nMoore’s Bond was at his best when he wasn’t Sean Connery’s James Bond. This is one of the big reasons The Man with the Golden Gun suffered, as it felt like a better script for Sean Connery than Roger Moore. Moore’s Bond doesn’t hit women, he romances them and he is (to the best of his ability) a gentleman. Whenever anyone looks for, “generic James Bond,” they look to Roger Moore, and I don’t mean that as an insult but as an observation. He played the role longer then anyone else, in more films than anyone else, and he did play it less emotionally vulnerable than Lazenby and even with less fear/anger we sometimes saw Connery have.\n\nAt the end of the day all of Moore’s films are worth watching for one reason or another with the exception of Octopussy (you can even skip A View to a Kill but Christopher Walken is pretty good in it). He just overstayed his welcome a little.\n\nTimothy Dalton (1987-1989)\n\nFilms: The Living Daylights, Licence to Kill\n\nBest film: Licence to Kill\n\nWorst film: The Living Daylights\n\nDesignation: The Rogue\n\nCalling one Timothy Dalton film better than the other is actually kind of a stupid thing to do because they’re both pretty consistent in quality and they’re both very good. Dalton is a very refreshing change of pace from Roger Moore’s more relaxed James Bond as he goes back to a lot of what Sean Connery did well in his films: he shows fear, he gets angry (he’s probably the angriest of the Bonds), you can tell he’s a little vulnerable (although not as much as Lazenby) and all in all he’s VERY interesting to watch. I greatly enjoyed Dalton’s films, and the reason he is designated as, “The Rogue,” is because we see in his films - more than other Bond films - his personal sense of honor and justice actually outweigh his devotion to queen and country. This is best on display in Licence to Kill (I don’t know why they spell Licence that way) which is probably my favorite of his two 007 films.\n\nPierce Brosnan (1995-2002)\n\nFilms: GoldenEye, Tomorrow Never Dies, The World is Not Enough, Die Another Day\n\nBest film: GoldenEye\n\nWorst film: Die Another Day\n\nDesignation: The Near-Total Package\n\nIt was sorta difficult for me to designate Pierce Brosnan’s James Bond, for although he’s pretty good he doesn’t really bring anything new to the role. He’s like the middle ground between Sean Connery and Roger Moore: he’s smooth, he’s been doing this a while, he’s emotionally steady, BUT he’s still got a bit of those rough edges. It does make him interesting to watch, he’s not a bad Bond by any means, in fact he’s kind of a perfect representation of all the Bonds before him. He’s got Connery’s rough edges, Lazenby’s romanticism, Moore’s gentlemen nature, and even a bit of Dalton’s rogue tendencies.\n\nWhen it comes to his films most people tend to agree that GoldenEye is the best of the bunch and Die Another Day should really just be avoided (it’s very cartoony but without the fun of a cartoon, and there is a lot of awful CGI). While people are also pretty harsh towards his other two films I actually greatly enjoyed The World is Not Enough despite Denise Richards less-than-desirable performance as the Bond girl. All in all, Brosnan was the perfect Bond to end a 40 year continuity on before rebooting the series with Daniel Craig.\n\nDaniel Craig (2006-Present)\n\nFilms: Casino Royale, Quantum of Solace, Skyfall, Spectre\n\nBest film: Casino Royale\n\nWorst film: Quantum of Solace\n\nDesignation: The Raw Bond\n\nI speak at great length in all of my (re)watches of the Daniel Craig Bond films as to why he’s the raw 007, but here’s the gist of it: a lot changed in terms of filmmaking between 2002 and 2006. Jason Bourne was now a lucrative franchise with the third film coming out a year after Casino Royale, and films such as Batman Begins and even 2002′s Spider-Man showed that audiences were interested in origin stories. Not only that, but Batman Begins proved that something which had gotten ridiculously campy and over the top could return to it’s darker roots very well. This film largely inspired producer Barbra Broccoli to reboot the Bond franchise with Casino Royale with a new continuity, and Craig is playing a Bond who has never been on a big ass mission before.\n\nCraig is not the same Bond who has encountered Dr. No or Goldfinger before, everything he’s doing he’s doing for the first time and he’s really learning on the job. Casino Royale is the best example of this, as Bond is exceptionally raw and undisciplined in that film with a massive ego. As the films progress he grows into more a seasoned veteran (to the point of fault in Spectre) but he’s got just a little bit of edgy Jason Bourne type thrown into him to make him relevant. He’s still 007: he’s still slick and cool, but Craig is by far the most human James Bond ever showing fear, love, anger, sadness, all of it. And it makes for excellent character writing. Craig is, by far, my favorite 007.\n\nA little break in my standard Epic Movie (Re)Watch post but I thought it’d be fun to try something new. I don’t think I’ll do a, “rank the Bond films,” or, “rank the Bond girls,” or anything like that. I may write one more Bond analytical post but it might also be outside of my Epic Movie (Re)Watch and deal with, “Buffy the Vampire Slayer,” also. Anyway, if you guys enjoyed this format let me know!"
