Krueger, released Tuesday on the university's Web site, showed that only 14.8 percent of African-American students and 11.7 percent of Hispanic students used computers to access the Internet in school in 1997, while 20.5 percent of white students used the Internet.\n\n\"There is a lot of evidence that suggests that workers who are not skilled and able to use computer technology at work find it more difficult to find high-paying jobs,\" said Krueger.\n\n\"Minorities may lack access to computer skills, and that may hurt them in the job market,\" Krueger told The Associated Press in a telephone interview from California, where he is doing research for a year at Stanford University. \"The jury is still out on whether technology actually helps learning,\" he added.\n\nSports Illustrated\n\nCopyright 2000 Time Inc.\n\nMay 15, 2000\n\nHEADLINE: Student in Need of Career Counseling;\n\nWill 6'11\" Chris Young sign a baseball contract or stay at Princeton to play two sports?\n\nBYLINE: Kelley King\n\nEight major league baseball scouts buzzed in the shade behind the backstop of Princeton 's Clarke Field, where the Tigers were playing Penn on April 24. At the top of each inning the scouts, who worked for teams ranging from the Florida Marlins to the Seattle Mariners, would stop talking, amble up to the fence and aim their radar guns in the direction of the mound, whence Chris Young, a 6'11\", 255-pound Princeton sophomore, was mowing down the Quakers. During the bottom half of the inning they bent their heads together to compare notes: good size, hits the corners, tops out around 90 mph, full command of fastball, changeup, slider. \"He throws strikes, moves the ball well, and with his build, velocity will come,\" said Mariners scout Tom McNamara of the righthanded Young, whose 1.05 earned run average through Sunday, when Princeton clinched a spot in the NCAA playoffs, was the lowest among Division I pitchers with at least 40 innings pitched. \"But draft order and signing bonuses aside, is this kid willing to give up two more years at this school to concentrate on baseball?\"\n\nAsking himself that same question was another spectator: Bill Carmody, coach of the Tigers' basketball team, of which Young is the co-captain. Carmody's attention was divided between the scouts, who were there to decide where they might pick Young (who will become a baseball-draft-eligible 21 years old later this month) in June, and his starting center, who was pitching aggravatingly well. \"Chris might have some big decisions to make,\" said Carmody. \"In basketball, too, he has all of the tools--a great feel for the game, a long-range shot, the ability to drive to the basket. There is no question he has a future in the NBA.\" Ryan Blake, the NBA's assistant director of scouting, believes that Young is a pro prospect. \"There aren't too many big guys who can pass the ball and make the three-pointer,\" he says. \"He definitely needs a couple more years of college basketball, but he has tremendous potential.\"\n\nIn this era of sports specialization, in which talented eight-year-olds are encouraged to streamline their athletic portfolios, Young's dilemma is rare. A two-sport All-Stater at Dallas's Highland Park High, Young had the option of playing basketball or baseball on an athletic scholarship at Oklahoma, Purdue, Texas or Vanderbilt. Instead he chose Princeton , where, for at least another few years, he would not have to decide between his two loves. Playing for an Ivy League school meant sacrificing scholarship dollars and paying the entire $35,000-a-year tab at Princeton , but Chris's parents, Charles, a real estate executive who was an offensive tackle at Texas Christian, and Lillie, a banking executive and former high school cheerleader who attended Ohio Wesleyan, supported the decision .\n\nOTHER HEADLINES The Washington Post\n\nCopyright 2000 The Washington Post\n\nMay 18, 2000, Thursday\n\nHEADLINE: NAMES IN THE NEWS\n\nBYLINE: Mary Keane\n\nGrads Commissioned\n\nThis month six graduates of Oxon Hill High School's Class of 1996 will receive commissions as officers in the military through the Reserve Officer Training Corps.

Other firms in the round included its early investors, Boston-based Highland Capital Partners and Prism Venture Partners. Telica is unusual for a young company, Highland general partner Sean Dalton said, because it already has a working product that potential customers - the Baby Bells and other phone-service companies - are testing. John St. Amand, Telica's chief executive, said the company is focusing first on phone wires, but the technology can improve service over cable, DSL, and wireless systems.\n\nKnight Ridder/Tribune\n\nCopyright 2000 Knight Ridder/Tribune News Service\n\nMay 17, 2000, Wednesday\n\nHEADLINE: 1ST PERSON: Meet Tom Cruise\n\nBYLINE: By Lily Chin\n\nMeet Tom Cruise\n\nHow else to describe the star power and presence of Thomas Cruise Mapother IV, known to movie audiences simply as Tom Cruise? Relentless positive, this actor and star endears himself to audiences, even when he plays a heel.\n\nTop Gun\n\nDuring the 1980s, Cruise propelled himself to the top by endearing himself to audiences. In \"Risky Business\" (1983), he is unscrupulous yet finagles his way into Princeton University. In \"Top Gun\" (1986), he is reckless yet gracefully aces the Soviet enemy. In \"The Color of Money\" (1986), he is naive yet manipulates his manipulator. His role in \"Cocktail\" (1988) is a composite of earlier characters.

The fund, which invests about 1.1 trillion yen ($10.2 billion) in both gross and value stocks, is now the largest mutual fund in Japan. Investors have rewarded Nomura by boosting shares over 50% in just five months.\n\nThis would all be pretty swell for the Nomura salesmen if they weren't so busy explaining to clients why the Nikkei 225 keeps hitting fresh six-month lows: The index is now 15.9% off its April high. The global tech blowout and the reshuffling of the Nikkei certainly didn't help, and now recent data from the Tokyo Stock Exchange show foreign investors, who poured more than 9 trillion yen into Japanese equities in 1999, sold 846 billion yen of securities in April alone.\n\nWhy did foreign investors, largely thought to help the Nikkei 225 index rally 37% last year, turn net sellers of Japanese securities last month for the first time since fall 1998? Was Japan's 1999 stock market rally a one-shot deal? Not so, say fund managers who run Japanese equity funds. Many remain quite bullish and even say now is the best time to buy shares, before a longer-term, sustainable rally begins later this year.\n\nEconomic fundamentals haven't changed all that drastically in Japan since 1999. Personal consumption, which makes up about 60% of gross domestic product, continues to fall, but corporate investment, especially in information technology, is up. Gross domestic product was down for the past two quarters, sending Japan into a technical recession, but many companies -- like chipmakers -- are starting to show strong profits despite the weak domestic economy.\n\nThis runs contrary to a recent column in the New York Times by Paul Krugman, professor at Princeton University, who said that the Nikkei's recent plunge was a sure sign that that the \"economic strategy of Japan's government is falling apart.\"\n\nHe is half right in the sense that it's safe to say everyone wants the Japanese government to move faster than it has in implementing sound economic policy. There are some major U.S. brokers, including Merrill Lynch, that say they aren't buying any more Japanese shares until they see proof of an economic rebound via data. However, that doesn't mean these long-term investors are going to sell all that they bought last year. And to say Japan's recent moves -- such as bank revitalization programs and accounting overhauls -- are not sound steps in building a foundation for a more viable economy is ridiculous.\n\nUniversity Wire\n\nCopyright 2000 The California Aggie\n\nMay 17, 2000\n\nHEADLINE: UC-Davis astronomer helps discover most distant space object\n\nBYLINE: By David Beavers, The California Aggie\n\nSOURCE: U. California-Davis\n\nDATELINE: Davis, Calif.\n\nOur knowledge of the known universe is expanding in leaps and bounds with what seems like weekly discoveries of new and fascinating stellar objects.\n\nUC-Davis professor and astronomer Robert Becker recently contributed to these findings when he helped detect the most distant matter ever observed by humans.\n\nThe object discovered was a quasar, an incredibly radiant, mysterious object with the mass and energy of an entire galaxy, hypothetically powered by a black hole.\n\nThe finding was made as part of an $80 million global astronomical collaboration dubbed the Sloan Digital Sky Survey.\n\nThe Sloan Sky Survey originally indicated the existence of the quasar - which was originally suspected to be a \"red galaxy,\" according to Becker - in March, a discovery made by Princeton University graduate student and Sloan Sky Survey astronomer Xiaohui Fan.\n\nThe discovery was then turned over to Becker, UC Berkeley professor Marc Davis and Space Telescope Science Institute astronomer Richard White to study with the 10-meter Keck Telescope in Hawaii.\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nCopyright 2000 Gannett Company, Inc.\n\nMay 17, 2000, Wednesday\n\nHEADLINE: Consumer demand inflates grades\n\nBYLINE: Samuel G. Freedman\n\nOutside my office window, in the balmy, blossom-scented May air, a university campus is preparing for commencement exercises. The athletic field, only recently reduced to bald dirt by soccer and ultimate Frisbee, has been coated with sod. A dais now stands on the library steps, and folding chairs for the graduates are arrayed in neat rows all across the quadrangle.\n\nAfter nearly a decade of teaching, I am as susceptible to sentimentality as any other professor.\n\nYet my memories during graduation season turn to a different university -- no need to name it, suffice to say it is prestigious and elite -- and a more common system of grading. I can still see myself in a hallway, dimly lit by the autumn sun slanting through lead-glass windows, trying to persuade a sobbing sophomore not to drop my course. At the midterm point, when I was required to give each student a \"predictive grade,\" I had put her down for a B/C. Now she wanted to bail out of class entirely rather than risk besmirching her transcript. The notion of actually trying to work\n\nhard enough to raise her grade didn't figure into her panicked calculations.\n\nI had been warned, I had to admit. A few days earlier, when I turned in my list of predictive grades to my department chair, she approached me with a kind of pitying look and gently informed me, \"We don't give anything but As or Bs around here.\"\n\n\"But what if a student does C work?\" I asked.\n\nNo, the chairman explained: The university believed that its course work was so rigorous, so superior to the level at competing schools, that its students should not be punished in the pursuit of graduate-school admissions and job offers by a C. When I persisted in my B/C, the offended pupil indeed dropped my class.\n\nI wish I could dismiss the incident as an aberration, as an anecdote masquerading as a trend, but the evidence tells otherwise.\n\nA self-study by Princeton University, released in 1998, revealed that As and Bs accounted for 83% of grades in the mid-1990s, a rise of 14% in a generation. The Scholastic Aptitude Test, an essential element for college admission, unilaterally \"renormed\" its scores higher in 1995.\n\nSamuel G.

But having lived in the area for less than a year, she was having trouble connecting with other women who'd made similar decisions. Then, she saw a flier at the library for a support group for women like her, and since then, she said, her days have been more active and fulfilling.\n\nRusso joined an international group, the MOMS (Moms Offering Moms Support) Club, which has more than 1,000 chapters worldwide and more than 50,000 members.\n\nThere are 49 chapters in New Jersey. Some of those groups are in Annandale, Bridgewater, Edison, Hackettstown, the Hopatcong area, Lawrenceville, Marlton, the Phillipsburg area, Somerset and the Winslow area.\n\nWomen who stay at home are now the minority. In 1975, 47 percent of women with children under 18 had jobs, said Mary Bowler, an economist at the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. By 1999, that figure rose to 72 percent.\n\nSara Curran, assistant professor of sociology at Princeton University, said the working-mom trend has gone steadily upward, pushed by the women's movement and families' growing reliance on two paychecks.\n\nBusiness Wire\n\nCopyright 2000 Business Wire, Inc.\n\nMay 16, 2000, Tuesday\n\nHEADLINE: Envoy Networks, Inc.

The Envoy executive team brings together extensive experience in wireless communications, global positioning systems (GPS), voice processing and IP data networking to design, develop and market broadband wireless infrastructure equipment for third generation (3G) wireless services.\n\nThe Yankee Group, a leading industry research firm , estimates that U.S. wireless data market to grow from $1.8 billion in 1999 to over $13 billion by 2003. Another estimate from Ernst &Young predicts that the number of 3G mobile subscribers will climb to 60 million by 2005. Envoy's advanced patented technology will allow operators to meet this demand, maximize their revenue, and realize cost savings by lowering the cost of deploying broadband services. Today, most operators contend that the cost of deploying broadband services using current infrastructure is prohibitive.\n\n\"Envoy strategy offers a clear path to make it the first company to introduce several advanced technologies that will revolutionize broadband wireless communications services\", said Dr. H.

The Bob Knight Verdict was due at 3 p.m. For many, it was must-see TV.\n\nSo they watched live coverage of a crowded news conference in Indianapolis, where Indiana University President Myles Brand announced sanctions against Knight for a string of angry, sometimes violent outbursts.\n\nNews of the sanctions was leaked to the news media early in the day. Although some were preoccupied with more serious matters, such as life and death, a huge cross-section of Hoosiers tuned in.\n\nBut Indiana Supreme Court Chief Justice Randall Shepard used some judicial restraint.\n\nShepard invited his staff into his office to watch the news conference on a tiny black-and-white television. After a few minutes, he returned to work signing documents and typing at his computer.\n\nAsked his opinion, the graduate of Yale, Princeton and the University of Virginia said he didn't want to weigh in on the matter.\n\n\"There's no need to put my oars in the water,\" he said.\n\nThe Morning Call (Allentown)\n\nCopyright 2000 The Morning Call, Inc.\n\nMay 16, 2000\n\nHEADLINE: POLAHA'S TOUGH ROAD ENDS WITH HALL OF FAME PICK\n\nBYLINE: TERRY LARIMER; The Morning Call\n\nMike Polaha tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee in 1985, he knew he'd had the best of care, but when he recovered and returned to the basketball court, his mind was as much of a problem as his knee was. Maybe more.\n\n\"It's a long, tough road back,\" Polaha recalled. \"You don't know if you're going to make it or not.\"\n\nHis first test came immediately. Polaha and his Lehigh University teammates were opening the season by playing host to Harvard and the game went down to the wire.\n\n\"I was fouled with two seconds left and I made both to send the game Lehigh into overtime,\" he recalled. \"Then I made a basket at the buzzer to win the game.\"\n\nThe running, 17- foot shot helped convince Polaha he was all the way back and he went on to have such an outstanding career that this past weekend he and four other Lehigh athletes were inducted into the school's Penske Lehigh Athletic Hall of Fame.\n\nHis Hall classmates were Liz Feeley, Class of 1987, Richard Gigon '52, Marty Horn '86 and Paul Short '34.\n\nFeeley, currently the head women's basketball coach at Princeton University, scored 1,275 points and had 571 rebounds, which are sixth- and eighth-best on Lehigh's all-time list.\n\nIn 1986 she set school records of 37 points in a game against Bucknell and 219 field goals in a season.\n\nUniversity Wire\n\nCopyright 2000 The Dartmouth via U-Wire\n\nMay 16, 2000\n\nHEADLINE: The SATs: Admissions test for life?\n\nBYLINE: By Alice Gomstyn, The Dartmouth\n\nSOURCE: Dartmouth College\n\nDATELINE: Hanover, N.H.\n\nAs if college entrance exams weren't already stressful enough for high school students, one theory says that your single SAT score may largely determine where you end up in life -- how much you get paid, whom you work for and who listens to your opinions.\n\n\"The SAT is the personnel office of American life. It's the thing that determines where you end up in life,\" Nick Lemann said.\n\nLemann, journalist and author of the \"The Big Test: The Secret History of the American Meritocracy,\" -- a chronicle of the creation of the Scholastic Aptitude Test and its effects on American society -- said he \"wasn't that interested in the SAT per se,\" when he initially began researching his latest book.\n\n\"I was interested in the question of : is there a system in the United States that determines who winds up where? If there is one, let's take a look at it and identify it precisely, figure out where it came from, who invented it, [and] what they thought they were doing,\" Lemann, a staff writer at The New Yorker, told The Dartmouth Monday.\n\nThis system, Lemann found, is largely based on the SAT.\n\nThis was not the original intent of the test's founders, according to Lemann.\n\nThe SAT, invented by Princeton University professor Carl Brigham in 1926, was based on an intelligence test administered to American soldiers during World War I.\n\nIn the mid-twentieth century, the first president of ETS, Henry Chauncey, an assistant dean at Harvard College, and James Bryant Conant, president of Harvard, had a vision -- they expected that the SAT would \"generate a leadership in the country with very high academic skills to run a slightly different type of America,\" Lemann said.\n\nFederal News Service\n\nCopyright 2000 Federal News Service, Inc.\n\nMay 15, 2000, Monday\n\nHEADLINE: FOREIGN PRESS CENTER BRIEFING WITH U.S. TRADE REPRESENTATIVE CHARLENE BARSHEFSKY\n\nTOPIC: PERMANENT NORMAL TRADE RELATIONS WITH CHINA\n\nMODERATOR: CHARLES SILVER, DIRECTOR OF THE WASHINGTON FOREIGN PRESS CENTER\n\nLOCATION: THE WASHINGTON FOREIGN PRESS CENTER, WASHINGTON, D.C.\n\n(pickup mid-way through questions)\n\nQ The National Labor Committee, last week, released a report called, \"Made in China: The Role of U.S. Companies in Denying Human and Worker Rights.\" And they document many -- it was Charles Kernaghan who is head of it; went over to China with human rights activists, and they document many labor abuses. One example is that a factory in Qin Shi, making goods for Kathie Lee at Wal-Mart, and it says they found a thousand workers were being held under conditions of indentured servitude, forced to work 12 to 14 hours a day, seven days a week, with only one day off a month, while earning an average of three cents an hour. They held a press conference here last week to announce it, and a number of members of Congress called for investigations of these companies in its report before a vote is taken.\n\nDo you think that -- have you seen this report?\n\nAMB. BARSHEFSKY: No.\n\nQ And do you think there should be such an investigation of these companies before a vote is taken?\n\nAMB. BARSHEFSKY: I have not seen the report. I would direct your attention to the very interesting report that just came out of Princeton University which finds something, I suspect, slightly different, and that is that foreign businesses that set up in China pretty routinely pay higher wages than Chinese businesses, and have a system of grievance procedures, frequently taken advantage of by employees in a very positive way. The report further found that Chinese businesses who compete with foreign businesses for skilled labor also have wage rates affected by having to increase wage rates and improve working conditions since they're drawing on the same labor pool; obviously a little competition can go a long way.\n\nI've not seen the report. But certainly I don't quite see how a vote against PNTR is going to improve any particular situation mentioned in the report, whatever the situation. Clearly, greater contact with the West, clearly, the bringing by Western companies of better working conditions, of higher wages, is a net positive thing for China.\n\nTHE FORT WORTH STAR-TELEGRAM\n\nCopyright 2000 Star-Telegram Newspaper, Inc.\n\nMay 15, 2000, Monday\n\nHEADLINE: Pick of Ivy League crop is Poly student's reward\n\nTeen cites working-class parents for success\n\nBYLINE: Michelle Melendez; Star-Telegram Staff Writer\n\nFORT WORTH - Not many students can say they turned down a education at Yale University.

The increase in the net loss was primarily due to the commencement of operations at the Company's new, 11,000 sq. ft. Technology Transfer and Pilot Line facility.\n\nUDC has been developing Organic Light Emitting Device (OLED) technology with Princeton University and the University of Southern California (USC) since 1994. The partnership is committed to the innovative research and commercialization of this proprietary OLED technology for applications such as flat panel displays, lasers, and light generating devices.\n\nThe Company's OLED technology centers around four important technology platforms: TOLEDs (Transparent Organic Light Emitting Devices), which can be up to 85% transparent when not energized, can be used to create vision area displays on windshields, cockpits, helmets and eyeglasses, and can also be integrated with standard silicon semiconductors. FOLEDs (Flexible Organic Light Emitting Devices) can be built on flexible plastic and unbreakable and/or conformable surfaces and provide lighter weight and more durable performance. SOLEDs, the third technology platform, are being developed for high-resolution displays. UDC and it's research partners are also working on a fourth technology platform, focusing on a family of high efficiency organic materials using electrophosphorence as the light emitting mechanism.\n\nThe Providence Journal-Bulletin\n\nCopyright 2000 The Providence Journal Company\n\nMay 15, 2000, Monday\n\nHEADLINE: Cybertalk - Search for tomorrow - Providence firm melds 2 technologies to improve Internet inquiries\n\nBYLINE: TIM BARMANN\n\nSearching for something on the Web can be frustrating.

Masback, one of the world's best middle-distance runners, can't forget what he was asked.\n\n\"President Carter has just announced a boycott of the Moscow Olympics,\" the reporter said. \"He says it's a matter of national security. Do you support your president?\"\n\nMasback, who in 1979 had the sixth-fastest time in the world in 1,500 meters, knew his Olympic dream was over.\n\n\"I would contend that it's impossible to say no to that question,\" said Masback, chief executive officer of USA Track & Field. \"No American could say no to that.\"\n\nThroughout history, athletes often have been forced to choose sides in the sports-politics debate. And sporting events often have been the pawns of those political struggles.\n\nThat collision soon could reach Georgia. The South Carolina Legislature voted last week to remove the Confederate battle flag from the dome of the statehouse, deterring a threat by the NCAA to remove all NCAA-sponsored events from the state. Now, many believe the NAACP and other civil rights organizations will turn their attention to Georgia, which incorporates the Confederate battle flag on its state flag.\n\n\"You can expect a long, hot summer,\" said South Carolina Rep. John Scott, a black Democrat from Columbia.\n\nWith Atlanta scheduled to host several national sporting events, including this summer's major league baseball All-Star Game and the 2002 NCAA men's basketball Final Four, Georgia's flag debate could make South Carolina's look like a blip on the radar screen. High-profile events create leverage; sports becomes the battlefield.\n\nThe boycott of the 1980 Moscow Games, set in motion by President Jimmy Carter in response to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in December 1979, still evokes bitterness among many athletes who feel they were victims of a sports-politics war.\n\n\"I believe an opportunity was wrongfully taken from a group of people, and it can never be returned,\" said Anita DeFrantz, a member of the 1980 U.S. women's rowing team. \"It was the athletes' right to decide, and that decision was taken away by very powerful political forces. People worked their entire lives (to participate in the Olympics). It's something that you believe in and you make life-changing decisions to work for it. And then someone says you can't go. You can't give that back.\"\n\nDeFrantz, who in 1980 was a 27-year-old attorney at Princeton University, was among the most outspoken critics of Carter's decision. She and 18 other athletes sued the USOC for the right to participate in the Games, but they lost their bid in a U.S. district court in June 1980.\n\nThe Boston Globe\n\nCopyright 2000 Globe Newspaper Company\n\nMay 14, 2000, Sunday\n\nHEADLINE: NORTH WEEKLY / SPORTS; CAHOON POPULAR CHOICE AT UMASS\n\nBYLINE: By Bob Monahan, Globe Staff\n\nDon \"Toot\" Cahoon, who led Marblehead High School to hockey greatness 30 years ago, has a pair of Jacks going for him as he goes into his new deal as hockey coach at the University of Massachusetts.\n\nThey are Jack Kelley and Jack Parker.

To us, the most distant look like intense points of infrared radiation. This is because space is scattered with hydrogen atoms (about two per cubic meter) that absorb blue light, and if you filter the blue from visible white light, red is what's left. On its multibillion-light-year journey to earth, quasar light loses so much blue that only infrared remains. At the heart of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey is a highly sensitive camera, developed at Princeton University and attached to a 2.5-meter telescope at the Apache Point Observatory in New Mexico. Using the same technology as digital cameras (charge-coupled devices instead of film), the camera records electromagnetic light, some of which the eye can't see, including ultraviolet and infrared wavelengths. On clear, moonless nights, the CCD's record the panorama of stars that pass by as the earth rotates. The resulting \"images\" are actually streams of data that flow into a computer at five megabytes per second. Powerful programs then crunch the numbers, cataloging the thousands of galaxies, nebulae and stars from each night's scan. Objects with strong infrared readings are earmarked: these may be distant quasars.\n\nThe New York Times\n\nCopyright 2000 The New York Times Company\n\nMay 14, 2000, Sunday\n\nHEADLINE: Getting Back to the Land in Summer Gallery Shows\n\nBYLINE: By WILLIAM ZIMMER\n\nTHE idea of a big backyard is well understood in the New Jersey art world. An artist can be local all over the state.\n\nNames and styles get around, at least in part, owing to the practice of rotating the fine arts and crafts biennials among the state's major museums. Along with this boosterism is a sense of community responsibility.\n\nThis aspect of sharing is emphasized this summer at the Printmaking Council of New Jersey in Somerville. \"Preserving the Garden: Saving New Jersey Landscape\" is an exhibition with the not very romantic theme of environmental protection. It was conceived in response to the state's recent commitment to preserve a million acres of open space.\n\nThe Princeton University Art Gallery is also emphasizing environmental and preservation themes, along with a sense of landscape that surrounds.\n\nA Boston photographer, Barbara Bosworth, achieves a sense of sweeping expanse by exposing three or four large negatives on a single sheet of photographic paper. Her major subjects can be seen as opposites: hunters, and on the other hand, trees that have been identified as the largest of their species by the American Forestry Association.\n\nThe Record (Bergen County, NJ)\n\nCopyright 2000 Bergen Record Corp.\n\nMay 14, 2000\n\nHEADLINE: RECOVERING FROM A LOSS OF FACE\n\nBYLINE: JAMES AHEARN\n\nWHEN Merrill Lynch proposed building a huge office complex in a cornfield in rural Hopewell, environmentalists complained that the project would violate the official State Plan.\n\nThey were right.\n\nThe State Plan seeks to curb sprawl by redirecting development from rural areas to cities and to smaller, established towns. The Merrill Lynch project would not comply with the plan. But with hundreds of well-paying jobs at stake, the Whitman administration assented to the project, even providing a grant from the state Economic Development\n\nAuthority. The complex is now under construction.\n\nRecently a controversy arose over another project in Mercer County.\n\nThis one was in Hamilton Township, a 195,000-square-foot office building planned for a four-acre farm field. The developer was none other than the state government.\n\nThe story doesn't end there. Four years ago the state Department of Environmental Protection, which issues permits for sewers, tried to link its permit rules to the State Plan. This was the enforcement hammer sought by environmentalists who thought that without one, the plan would be pretty much as Pat O'Keefe has described it, so many words on paper.\n\nO'Keefe and his association sued the department. A judge ruled in favor of the agency but said the State Plan should be regarded as general guidance, not a template for where sewers should be allowed and where not. Since then the department has been developing new regulations for sewers and septic systems, but it has been chary about linking these rules to the State Plan, fearing another lawsuit.\n\nNot to worry, said a suddenly energized Christie Whitman. In a speech at Princeton University last month, she said that control of sewer lines was essential to implementation of the State Plan. She said that henceforward anyone proposing a major sewer would have to submit a comprehensive environmental assessment. She predicted there would be a huge fight over this requirement and she promised,\"I'll lead it.\"\n\nThe Times-Picayune\n\nCopyright 2000 The Times-Picayune Publishing Co.\n\nMay 14, 2000 Sunday\n\nHEADLINE: PARK SERVICE CONFRONTS THE WHYS OF THE CIVIL WAR;\n\nON BATTLEFIELDS, NEW >UNDERSTANDING SOUGHT\n\nBYLINE: By Delia M. Rios Newhouse News Service\n\nDATELINE: WASHINGTON\n\nPresident Woodrow Wilson, speaking at Gettysburg on the 50th anniversary of the epic battle that repulsed Gen. Robert E. Lee's invasion of the North, invoked the spirit of brotherhood and healing. The Civil War, Wilson declared, had become \"a quarrel forgotten.\"\n\nHe could say this to the aged veterans of the Blue and the Gray because, by mutual consent, the war's bitter arguments were set aside on the fighting ground itself. Instead, on fields from Shiloh to Antietam, the soldiers' sacrifice was lauded, in narratives driven by military strategies and tactics. The practice allowed both sides pride in the struggle, and embraced reunion.\n\nBut there was a price.\n\nEven now, Americans walking the fields, hills and woods of the nation's Civil War battlefields learn very little there about why these men put their lives on the line. There is profound complexity behind the question, one the National Park Service is just beginning to confront.\n\nBy 2011, when the country marks the sesquicentennial of the war's outbreak in 1861, the 28 battlefields that the park service manages will reflect the best historical thinking of the moment.\n\nThat means coming to terms with the political, social and economic disputes that set the North and South against one another, and acknowledging the painful history of slavery.\n\nThe war and all the issues it raises are very much still contested territory, so much so that Keith Poulter, publisher of the Civil War history magazine North & South, described the park service as \"entering upon a political minefield.\" After all, the war's very name is in dispute: Is it the Civil War or the War Between the States?\n\nJames McPherson, the Princeton University historian whose \"Battle Cry of Freedom\" won the Pulitzer Prize, says that while it must be done, interpretation of the war will be divisive, just as the war was.\n\nThe single most divisive issue, all intuitively know, will be slavery.\n\nThere are two essential conflicts at work in how the war is chronicled.\n\nThe first is that distinctive interpretations of liberty, freedom and democracy motivated the Union and Confederate causes. As McPherson said, \"Soldiers on both sides thought they were fighting to vindicate the legacy of the American Revolution.\"\n\nVentura County Star (Ventura County, Ca.)\n\nCopyright 2000 Ventura County Star\n\nMay 14, 2000, Sunday\n\nHEADLINE: The family's changing face\n\nNOT LIKE IT USED TO BE: Many factors contribute to shift away from Norman Rockwell's America\n\nBYLINE: Kim Lamb Gregory\n\nStaff writer\n\nSingle mom Kathleen Wilson, 38, chats with several other adults relaxing in lawn chairs at a grassy Ventura park.

With a strong work ethic and a sparkling resume, Glass figured that in anywhere from four to six years, he would do enough impressive research, teaching and community service to persuade his peers to confer upon him the rights and responsibilities of a full tenured professor.\n\nHe could have been earning a six-figure salary working as an engineer; after all, he knew, a young African American with a bachelor's degree from Johns Hopkins University and a master's and a doctorate from the University of Colorado generally has his pick of jobs. But academia is where he wanted to be and, having grown up in Silver Spring, Howard seemed a perfect choice.\n\nShortly after arriving on campus last August, however, Glass learned from the head of the Faculty Senate that he had entered an institution in which tenure is an iffy proposition. It's not that professors can't win it; they can and they do. It's just that there's no guarantee tenure will be meaningful in the way it was conceived early in the 1900s. Seven years ago, Howard's Board of Trustees placed a provision in the faculty handbook that allows the trustees to remove tenured professors \"when, in the board's judgment, the interests of the university require it.\" That meant trustees could get rid of a tenured professor whenever they felt like it -- which meant tenure effectively was abolished.\n\nFor those who fail to win tenure, life can become complicated. They often must leave the institution where they were working, and sometimes find that the rejection makes it even harder for them to gain it elsewhere. Many join the growing pool of part-time professors, called adjuncts, or itinerant scholars, who cobble together course loads at various schools to eke out a living. Some leave the profession altogether; one woman who was denied tenure at Princeton University, for example, is now attending Stanford Law School.\n\nThe Washington Post\n\nCopyright 2000 The Washington Post\n\nMay 14, 2000, Sunday\n\nHEADLINE: In Shell Game, Rowers Pull Together; On Olympic Quest, Motley Crew Gets Push From All Sides\n\nBYLINE: Amy Shipley , Washington Post Staff Writer\n\nDATELINE: PRINCETON , N.J.\n\nIn the heart of the posh Princeton community, just down the street from the Princeton University gates, a Roman Catholic priest has opened the doors of an old mansion once frequented by Albert Einstein to about a dozen elite male rowers, many of whom will represent the United States at the 2000 Olympics in Sydney.\n\nThe gregarious Father Tom Mullelly, called \"FT\" for short, provides free lodging, fellowship dinners on Thursday nights and rides in his white Ford station wagon (nicknamed \"the Popemobile\") for his not necessarily religious--let alone Catholic--tenants, who sleep on beds, futons, couches and in various corners of the eight-bedroom house now owned by the Catholic diocese.\n\nOne is a musician from the District--George Washington University graduate Aquil Abdullah--who is on course to become the first African American to win a place on the U.S. men's Olympic rowing team.

The promotion of the capitalist work ethic and solid free-market principles have inspired many Canadians to remain motivated in the workplace, and to accept free trade as a boon to our economy. In other words, global capitalism has been a proven economic benefit.\n\nBut there are still some people who argue that an economic system can be reversed or adjusted, if necessary. And while these concerns over global capitalism primarily come from the political left, there has been a mild tremor even on the political right. Why? They fear that local communities have lost much of their influence in the age of the global market. They sense that individual interests are of the utmost importance in society. And they perceive that our political institutions have apparently crumbled due to globalization.\n\nRobert Gilpin, the Eisenhower Professor of Public and International Affairs Emeritus at Princeton University, recognizes some of these concerns. He is of the belief that ''an open and integrated global economy is neither as extensive and inexorable nor as irreversible as many assume.'' In his new book, The Challenge of Global Capitalism: The World Economy in the 21st Century, he tries to address and resolve a few of these concerns. Gilpin's central argument is that global capitalism and economic globalization must rest on a secure political foundation, one that has been severely weakened since the collapse of the Soviet Union. To make the global economy work, however, it is up to the U.S. and other major powers to rebuild this foundation.\n\nThe Challenge of Global Capitalism also discusses a number of growing problems in the global economy. In one sense, there has been heightened tension between trade liberalization and trade protectionism. The critics of free-trade principles have successfully argued their case because ''the political process tends to favour special interests that desire protection.'' In other words, protectionists such as Ross Perot and Pat Buchanan have been able to sway millions of Americans by simple fear tactics, such as the potential loss of American jobs to new immigrants and the need for fair trade regulations.\n\nNational Public Radio (NPR)\n\nSHOW: WEEKEND EDITION SATURDAY (1:00 PM ET)\n\nMay 13, 2000, Saturday\n\nHEADLINE: PROFESSOR ELAINE FANTHAM, PRINCETON UNIVERSITY, TALKS ABOUT THE HISTORIC ACCURACY OF THE MOVIE \"GLADIATOR\"\n\nANCHORS: SUSAN STAMBERG\n\nSUSAN STAMBERG, host:\n\nThe cinematic spectacle \"Gladiator\" opened this past weekend. It's a bloody tale of revenge in which a father, Emperor Marcus Aurelius, seeks to deny his son the throne and bestow it on another, in this case, Russell Crowe, who plays a hunky warrior named Maximus, but the son, Commodus, will not hear of it. And the whole mess gets hashed out on the floor of the Coliseum.

Professor Fantham joins us on the line from her office.\n\nProf. FANTHAM: And I must say, you know, that if I had been Marcus Aurelius or, in fact, just myself, I would have preferred Russell Crowe.\n\nSTAMBERG: You bet. So you liked Crowe. But tell us what it is about these gladiators--now how come they fascinate us as much as they did the ancient Romans?\n\nProf. FANTHAM: Well, I'm inclined to think it was something to do with the fact that by the time the gladiatorial gangs became a really popular activity Romans from Rome no longer fought in the legions. They were not regarded as good fighting material. Of course, there were plenty of Roman citizens fighting in the wars, and that's why we have that perfectly splendid battle at the beginning of the movie.\n\nProf. FANTHAM: But the people in Rome, the ones who thronged--well, who would throng Coliseum once it was erected, around 80, didn't get to fight themselves, and they probably needed this to carry it through.\n\nSTAMBERG: Huh.

The deuterium is thought to have been forged in the first few minutes after the big bang, but it is easily converted into helium if there is a lot of hydrogen about. \"The scarcity of deuterium (today) tells us that when it was born there was about twice as much hydrogen around as we see today tied up in galaxies and galaxy clusters,\" says Tripp.\n\nOne explanation for the disappearance of the hydrogen was that it became so hot its atoms lost their electrons. Since atoms can't emit or absorb light without electrons, the hydrogen effectively became invisible. According to theorists, this could have happened if some hydrogen was \"shock-heated\" to over 100 000 degrees C as clouds of the gas collided at incredible speeds. \"The stuff that remained cool congealed into galaxies,\" says Tripp. \"The stuff that was hot was simply too hot to be held together by gravity and got left out.\"\n\nThe News and Observer (Raleigh, NC)\n\nCopyright 2000 The News and Observer\n\nMay 13, 2000 Saturday\n\nHEADLINE: Bringing careers to successful close\n\nBYLINE: AL MYATT, STAFF WRITER\n\nThey come at batters from contrasting angles, but closers Cory Scott of East Carolina and Derrick DePriest of North Carolina have success in common.\n\nDePriest's career took off after he went to a sidearm delivery as a sophomore.

After all, the media has come a long way in Mexico in recent years.\n\nBut the day after the debate, there in El Sol de Tijuana -- and presumably in the rest of the newspapers in the Organizacion Editorial Mexicana chain run by pro-government media tycoon Mario Vazquez Rana -- was a headline saying Francisco Labastida was the winner. The story was written by one of the chain's reporters.\n\nIn another debate-related shenanigan, the Chiapas state governor telephoned a government minister and ordered him to get the state's media to report that Labastida had won the debate.\n\nMexico expert Wayne Cornelius of the University of California San Diego put it this way: \"The real question is whether the party-government apparatus will pull out all the stops over the next two months to steal the election, by large-scale vote-buying, massive use of government personnel for campaign purposes, and other types of pre-election abuses that the IFE can't police effectively.\"\n\nCornelius, founding director of UCSD's Center for U.S.-Mexican Studies and now head of its Center for Comparative Immigration Studies, said Mexicans still fear change.\n\n\"The Mexican electorate is predominantly conservative and risk-averse,\" Cornelius said in a talk at Princeton University last year. \"Surveys show that PRI supporters are more conservative in their policy preferences than are supporters of the National Action Party, which is supposed to be the main 'conservative' opposition party in Mexico.\"\n\nStar Tribune (Minneapolis, MN)\n\nCopyright 2000 Star Tribune\n\nMay 12, 2000, Friday\n\nHEADLINE: 'U' leaders warn that salary gap will hurt quality; Faculty compensation has fallen behind other leading schools, regents are told.\n\nBYLINE: Duchesne Paul Drew; Staff Writer\n\nThe University of Minnesota will have to improve salary and benefit packages for faculty members if it hopes to attract and keep the best and brightest in the world of academia, according to a report administrators and professors presented Thursday to the Board of Regents.\n\nWhen compared to its peers among the nation's top 30 research institutions, the Twin Cities campus ranks 25th in salary and 20th in total compensation for full professors.

By FRANK DIKOTTER. Columbia University Press. 288 pp. $27.50.\n\nThe evil of eugenics, practiced tragically and widely in the United States, England, and Germany earlier in the century, remains a driving force in the People's Republic of China.\n\nIndeed, in 1995 national legislation firmly installed eugenics as official government policy. What does this mean? In a dry but disturbing book aimed at fellow academics, Frank Dikotter describes the legitimization in China of all the evils long associated with the eugenics movement: forced sterilizations of the \"unfit,\" eugenic late-term abortions, forced abortion under the \"one-child\" policy, and the public promotion of the odious concept that babies born with disabilities have \"zero value lives\" and whose killings are to be encouraged for the good of the family and the country. After reading Imperfect Conceptions, I was left to wonder how our government can possibly promote China's entrance into the World Trade Organization when its public policies are so eerily similar to those engaged in by Germany sixty years ago. But then I remembered: we are the country in which Princeton University appointed Peter Singer to a tenured ethics professorship despite the fact that he approves of killing disabled infants and advocates a brand of \"utilitarian\" philosophy that generously accommodates the ambitions of the eugenics project. If Singer ever gets tired of Princeton , he might find a warm welcome in the PRC.\n\nTHE BALTIMORE SUN\n\nCopyright 2000 The Baltimore Sun Company\n\nApril 30, 2000\n\nHEADLINE: To bleed or not to bleed? ;It's a question often faced by directors of violent productions like \"Macbeth': Just how much blood should be spilled before an audience?\n\nBYLINE: Arthur Hirsch\n\nSOURCE: Sun Staff\n\nThat damned spot. It's there in \"Macbeth\" whether it's there or not, hence the questions for any director who takes on the play: How much blood is too much or not enough?\n\nIt's one thing to say that this William Shakespeare tragedy is thematically steeped in blood -- that the stuff metaphorically drips from the walls, bubbles from the witches' caldron, and darkens the skies over Dunsinane and the souls of its treacherous protagonists. It's another to actually deal with the red goo onstage.\n\nAt Center Stage, where \" Macbeth\" has been running since March 24, they go through about a cup of fake blood per show -- about two gallons already, with another week of shows to go. Director Tim Vasen says it could have been worse.\n\nWhen Vasen did \"Gum,\" he felt the blood was necessary for dramatic impact. When he directed Georg Buchner's French Revolution tragedy, \"Danton's Death,\" at Princeton University, he felt that seven deaths by guillotine would be a bit much. Rather than have blood and heads flying all over the stage and spectators fleeing to rest rooms, he represented the beheadings by having the victims doused with buckets of water.\n\nNation's Restaurant News\n\nCopyright 2000 Lebhar-Friedman, Inc.\n\nApril 24, 2000, Monday\n\nHEADLINE: NEWS DIGESTS\n\nPrinceton University imports Ethiopian cuisine\n\nPrinceton , N.J. -- Students at Princeton University got a chance to sample the cuisine of Ethiopia, when the Dining Services staff served menu items from Makeda, an Ethiopian restaurant in New Brunswick, N.J.\n\nDining Services director Stuart Orefice explained that Makeda's presence on campus was part of the university's \"Garden State Series\" visiting chef program.\n\nStudents were offered a number of Makeda's menu items, which included tibs wat, sauteed beef in a spicy stew; and beg wat, lamb marinated in red wine and Berber sauce.

In the name of equalizing access to higher education, he urges colleges to discourage and even punish applicants' use of these professionals. . . . Why should equalizing access equate to dumbing down the counseling process to the lowest common denominator -- the overworked public-school counselor with too many students and too little time?\n\nMinority students avail themselves regularly of this assistance. For example, an applicant who never used Accepted.com's fee-based services recently thanked Accepted.com for the advice offered on its Web site. He believes it helped him gain acceptance to top M.B.A. programs and provided him with a great shot at a fellowship as well.\n\nAre the colleges really opposed to students using the advantages money can buy? If so, how can Princeton University, whose admissions dean was particularly pained by the influence of money, charge over $100,000 for a four-year degree? Presumably, the students and their parents are paying for a superior education and the lifelong advantages that it will provide. If not, they are spending a lot of money for nothing.\n\nLinda Abraham\n\nPresident\n\nAccepted.com\n\nLos Angeles\n\nThe Chronicle of Higher Education\n\nCopyright 2000 The Chronicle of Higher Education\n\nApril 7, 2000\n\nHEADLINE: Peter Singer's Controversial Views Have Brought Philosophy Out of the Ivory Tower\n\nTo the Editor:\n\nIsn't it an example of prejudicial journalism to assert that among the \"crowd of . . . protesters\" who greeted Peter Singer at Princeton University were \"a group of disabled-rights activists called Not Dead Yet.

While it is probable that many Catholics would agree with disabled-rights activists in opposing some of Dr. Singer's views, the church as a \"group\" (i.e., the hierarchy collectively, or the billion people who belong to the church) has not, to my knowledge, seen fit to pronounce on Dr. Singer's views.
