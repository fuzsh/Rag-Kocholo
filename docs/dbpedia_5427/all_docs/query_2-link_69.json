A lot of people consider Will Ferrell or Timothy Dalton to be good actors even though they get very intense, where as others say they over do it.\n\nGone With The Wind won best picture as well as other Oscars, and is one of my favorite movies, yet a couple of friends say it has some of the most overacting in it, they have ever seen, and not in a good way.\n\nOveracting is kind of a relative term, I'm just saying. Another thing is, is that nervous actors, such as when I started out, do not speak from their diaphragm, which I had to learn later. That is one to add.\n\nI can think of no small habits that I would put into this category.\n\nBut I can say this.. I've directed two short films now, and both of them I had to edit around scenes where the actors quickly glanced right into the camera. I was not able to catch it live because I didn't have enough help and was busy holding the boom\n\nAn actor who likes to keep a hand on the hip and not stand straight when it's not part of their character.\n\nActors who cannot stay in character while the camera is rolling is as bad as an actor who cannot remember their lines and re-invent them with every take.\n\nThey are a nightmare to edit around."
