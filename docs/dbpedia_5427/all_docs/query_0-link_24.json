        "text": "Taking into account relational structure during data mining can lead to better results, both in terms of quality and computational efficiency. This structure may be captured in the schema, in links between entities (e.g., graphs) or in rules describing the domain (e.g., knowledge graphs). Further, for richly structured prediction problems, there is often a need for a mix of both logical reasoning and statistical inference. In this talk, I will give an introduction to the field of Statistical Relational Learning (SRL), and I'll identify useful tips and tricks for exploiting structure in both the input and output space. I'll describe our recent work on highly scalable approaches for statistical relational inference. I'll close by introducing a broader interpretation of relational thinking that reveals new research opportunities (and challenges!).\n\nWith the maturing of AI and multiagent systems research, we have a tremendous opportunity to direct these advances towards addressing complex societal problems. I will focus on domains of public health and conservation, and address one key cross-cutting challenge: how to effectively deploy our limited intervention resources in these problem domains. I will present results from work around the globe in using AI for challenges in public health such as Maternal and Child care interventions, HIV prevention, and in conservation such as endangered wildlife protection. Achieving social impact in these domains often requires methodological advances. To that end, I will highlight key research advances in multiagent reasoning and learning, in particular in, restless multiarmed bandits, influence maximization in social networks, computational game theory and decision-focused learning. In pushing this research agenda, our ultimate goal is to facilitate local communities and non-profits to directly benefit from advances in AI tools and techniques\n\nRepresentation learning of protein 3D structures is challenging and essential for applications, e.g., computational protein design or protein engineering. Recently, geometric deep learning has achieved great success in non-Euclidean domains. Although protein can be represented as a graph naturally, it remains under-explored mainly due to the significant challenges in modeling the complex representations and capturing the inherent correlation in the 3D structure modeling. Several challenges include: 1) It is challenging to extract and preserve multi-level rotation and translation equivariant information during learning. 2) Difficulty in developing appropriate tools to effectively leverage the input spatial representations to capture complex geometries across the spatial dimension. 3) Difficulty in incorporating various geometric features and preserving the inherent structural relations. In this work, we introduce geometric bottleneck perceptron, and a general SO(3)-equivariant message passing neural network built on top of it for protein structure representation learning. The proposed geometric bottleneck perceptron can be incorporated into diverse network architecture backbones to process geometric data in different domains. This research shed new light on geometric deep learning in 3D structure studies. Empirically, we demonstrate the strength of our proposed approach on three core downstream tasks, where our model achieves significant improvements and outperforms existing benchmarks. The implementation is available at https://github.com/sarpaykent/GBPNet.\n\nMulti-task learning (MTL) is a framework that enforces multiple learning tasks to share their knowledge to improve their generalization abilities. While shallow multi-task learning can learn task relations, it can only handle pre-defined features. Modern deep multi-task learning can jointly learn latent features and task sharing, but they are obscure in task relation. Also, they pre-define which layers and neurons should share across tasks and cannot learn adaptively. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a new multi-task learning framework that jointly learns latent features and explicit task relations by complementing the strength of existing shallow and deep multitask learning scenarios. Specifically, we propose to model the task relation as the similarity between tasks' input gradients, with a theoretical analysis of their equivalency. In addition, we innovatively propose a multi-task learning objective that explicitly learns task relations by a new regularizer. Theoretical analysis shows that the generalizability error has been reduced thanks to the proposed regularizer. Extensive experiments on several multi-task learning and image classification benchmarks demonstrate the proposed method's effectiveness, efficiency as well as reasonableness in the learned task relation patterns.\n\nPartial label learning induces a multi-class classifier from training examples each associated with a candidate label set where the ground-truth label is concealed. Feature selection improves the generalization ability of learning system via selecting essential features for classification from the original feature set, while the task of partial label feature selection is challenging due to ambiguous labeling information. In this paper, the first attempt towards partial label feature selection is investigated via mutual-information-based dependency maximization. Specifically, the proposed approach SAUTE iteratively maximizes the dependency between selected features and labeling information, where the value of mutual information is estimated from confidence-based latent variable inference. In each iteration, the near-optimal features are selected greedily according to properties of submodular mutual information function, while the density of latent label variable is inferred with the help of updated labeling confidences over candidate labels by resorting to kNN aggregation in the induced lower-dimensional feature space. Extensive experiments over synthetic as well as real-world partial label data sets show that the generalization ability of well-established partial label learning algorithms can be significantly improved after coupling with the proposed feature selection approach.\n\nLink prediction is one of the central problems in graph mining. However, recent studies highlight the importance of higher-order network analysis, where complex structures called motifs are the first-class citizens. We first show that existing link prediction schemes fail to effectively predict motifs. To alleviate this, we establish a general motif prediction problem and we propose several heuristics that assess the chances for a specified motif to appear. To make the scores realistic, our heuristics consider - among others - correlations between links, i.e., the potential impact of some arriving links on the appearance of other links in a given motif. Finally, for highest accuracy, we develop a graph neural network (GNN) architecture for motif prediction. Our architecture offers vertex features and sampling schemes that capture the rich structural properties of motifs. While our heuristics are fast and do not need any training, GNNs ensure highest accuracy of predicting motifs, both for dense (e.g., k-cliques) and for sparse ones (e.g., k-stars). We consistently outperform the best available competitor by more than 10% on average and up to 32% in area under the curve. Importantly, the advantages of our approach over schemes based on uncorrelated link prediction increase with the increasing motif size and complexity. We also successfully apply our architecture for predicting more arbitrary clusters and communities, illustrating its potential for graph mining beyond motif analysis.\n\nWith the enactment of privacy-preserving regulations, e.g., GDPR, federated SVD is proposed to enable SVD-based applications over different data sources without revealing the original data. However, many SVD-based applications cannot be well supported by existing federated SVD solutions. The crux is that these solutions, adopting either differential privacy (DP) or homomorphic encryption (HE), suffer from accuracy loss caused by unremovable noise or degraded efficiency due to inflated data.\n\nIn this paper, we propose FedSVD, a practical lossless federated SVD method over billion-scale data, which can simultaneously achieve lossless accuracy and high efficiency. At the heart of FedSVD is a lossless matrix masking scheme delicately designed for SVD: 1) While adopting the masks to protect private data, FedSVD completely removes them from the final results of SVD to achieve lossless accuracy; and 2) As the masks do not inflate the data, FedSVD avoids extra computation and communication overhead during the factorization to maintain high efficiency. Experiments with real-world datasets show that FedSVD is over 10000x faster than the HE-based method and has 10 orders of magnitude smaller error than the DP-based solution (Îµ=0.1, Î´=0.1) on SVD tasks. We further build and evaluate FedSVD over three real-world applications: principal components analysis (PCA), linear regression (LR), and latent semantic analysis (LSA), to show its superior performance in practice. On federated LR tasks, compared with two state-of-the-art solutions: FATE [17] and SecureML [19], FedSVD-LR is 100x faster than SecureML and 10x faster than FATE.\n\nThe aspect-opinion extraction tasks extract aspect terms and opinion terms from reviews. The supervised extraction methods achieve state-of-the-art performance but require large-scale human-annotated training data. Thus, they are restricted for open-domain tasks due to the lack of training data. This work addresses this challenge and simultaneously mines aspect terms, opinion terms, and their correspondence in a joint model. We propose an Open-Domain Aspect-Opinion Co-Mining (ODAO) method with a Double-Layer span extraction framework. Instead of acquiring human annotations, ODAO first generates weak labels for unannotated corpus by employing rules-based on universal dependency parsing. Then, ODAO utilizes this weak supervision to train a double-layer span extraction framework to extract aspect terms (ATE), opinion terms (OTE), and aspect-opinion pairs (AOPE). ODAO applies canonical correlation analysis as an early stopping indicator to avoid the model over-fitting to the noise to tackle the noisy weak supervision. ODAO applies a self-training process to gradually enrich the training data to tackle the weak supervision bias issue. We conduct extensive experiments and demonstrate the power of the proposed ODAO. The results on four benchmark datasets for aspect-opinion co-extraction and pair extraction tasks show that ODAO can achieve competitive or even better performance compared with the state-of-the-art fully supervised methods.\n\nWe formulate a new inference task in the domain of multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF), called Variable Subset Forecast (VSF), where only a small subset of the variables is available during inference. Variables are absent during inference because of long-term data loss (eg. sensor failures) or high -> low-resource domain shift between train / test. To the best of our knowledge, robustness of MTSF models in presence of such failures, has not been studied in the literature. Through extensive evaluation, we first show that the performance of state of the art methods degrade significantly in the VSF setting. We propose a non-parametric, wrapper technique that can be applied on top any existing forecast models. Through systematic experiments across 4 datasets and 5 forecast models, we show that our technique is able to recover close to 95% performance of the models even when only 15% of the original variables are present.\n\nWith the advancement of data collection techniques, end users are interested in how different types of data can collaborate to improve our life experiences. Multimodal Federated Learning (MFL) is an emerging area allowing many distributed clients, each of which can collect data from multiple types of sensors, to participate in the training of some multimodal data-related models without sharing their data. In this paper, we address a novel challenging issue in MFL, the modality incongruity, where clients may have heterogeneous setups of sensors and their local data consists of different combinations of modalities. With the modality incongruity, clients may solve different tasks on different parameter spaces, which escalates the difficulties in dealing with the statistical heterogeneity problem of federated learning; also, it would be hard to perform accurate model aggregation across different types of clients. To tackle these challenges, in this work, we propose the FedMSplit framework, which allows federated training over multimodal distributed data without assuming similar active sensors in all clients. The key idea is to employ a dynamic and multi-view graph structure to adaptively capture the correlations amongst multimodal client models. More specifically, we split client models into smaller shareable blocks and allow each type of blocks to provide a specific view on client relationships. With the graph representation, the underlying correlations between clients can be captured as the edge features in the multi-view graph, and then be utilized to promote local model relations through the neighborhood message passing in the graph. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method under different sensor setups with statistical heterogeneity.\n\nJoin order selection plays an important role in DBMS query optimizers. The problem aims to find the optimal join order with the minimum cost, and usually becomes an NP-hard problem due to the exponentially increasing search space. Recent advanced studies attempt to use deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to generate better join plans than the ones provided by conventional query optimizers. However, DRL-based methods require time-consuming training, which is not suitable for online applications that need frequent periodic re-training. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, namely efficient Join Order selection learninG with Graph-basEd Representation (JOGGER). We firstly construct a schema graph based on the primary-foreign key relationships, from which table representations are well learned to capture the correlations between tables. The second component is the state representation, where a graph convolutional network is utilized to encode the query graph and a tailored-tree-based attention module is designed to encode the join plan. To speed up the convergence of DRL training process, we exploit the idea of curriculum learning, in which queries are incrementally added into the training set according to the level of difficulties. We conduct extensive experiments on JOB and TPC-H datasets, which demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed solutions.\n\nRecent studies have shown that deep neural networks-based recommender systems are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, where attackers can inject carefully crafted fake user profiles (i.e., a set of items that fake users have interacted with) into a target recommender system to achieve malicious purposes, such as promote or demote a set of target items. Due to the security and privacy concerns, it is more practical to perform adversarial attacks under the black-box setting, where the architecture/parameters and training data of target systems cannot be easily accessed by attackers. However, generating high-quality fake user profiles under black-box setting is rather challenging with limited resources to target systems. To address this challenge, in this work, we introduce a novel strategy by leveraging items' attribute information (i.e., items' knowledge graph), which can be publicly accessible and provide rich auxiliary knowledge to enhance the generation of fake user profiles. More specifically, we propose a knowledge graph-enhanced black-box attacking framework (KGAttack) to effectively learn attacking policies through deep reinforcement learning techniques, in which knowledge graph is seamlessly integrated into hierarchical policy networks to generate fake user profiles for performing adversarial black-box attacks. Comprehensive experiments on various real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed attacking framework under the black-box setting.\n\nThe booming of multi-modal knowledge graphs (MMKGs) has raised the imperative demand for multi-modal entity alignment techniques, which facilitate the integration of multiple MMKGs from separate data sources. Unfortunately, prior arts harness multi-modal knowledge only via the heuristic merging of uni-modal feature embeddings. Therefore, inter-modal cues concealed in multi-modal knowledge could be largely ignored. To deal with that problem, in this paper, we propose a novel Multi-modal Siamese Network for Entity Alignment (MSNEA) to align entities in different MMKGs, in which multi-modal knowledge could be comprehensively leveraged by the exploitation of inter-modal effect. Specifically, we first devise a multi-modal knowledge embedding module to extract visual, relational, and attribute features of entities to generate holistic entity representations for distinct MMKGs. During this procedure, we employ inter-modal enhancement mechanisms to integrate visual features to guide relational feature learning and adaptively assign attention weights to capture valuable attributes for alignment. Afterwards, we design a multi-modal contrastive learning module to achieve inter-modal enhancement fusion with avoiding the overwhelming impact of weak modalities. Experimental results on two public datasets demonstrate that our proposed MSNEA provides state-of-the-art performance with a large margin compared with competitive baselines.\n\nMulti-view subspace clustering targets at clustering data lying in a union of low-dimensional subspaces. Generally, an n X n affinity graph is constructed, on which spectral clustering is then performed to achieve the final clustering. Both graph construction and graph partitioning of spectral clustering suffer from quadratic or even cubic time and space complexity, leading to difficulty in clustering large-scale datasets. Some efforts have recently been made to capture data distribution in multiple views by selecting key anchor bases beforehand with k-means or uniform sampling strategy. Nevertheless, few of them pay attention to the algebraic property of the anchors. How to learn a set of high-quality orthogonal bases in a unified framework, while maintaining its scalability for very large datasets, remains a big challenge. In view of this, we propose an Efficient Orthogonal Multi-view Subspace Clustering (OMSC) model with almost linear complexity. Specifically, the anchor learning, graph construction and partition are jointly modeled in a unified framework. With the mutual enhancement of each other, a more discriminative and flexible anchor representation and cluster indicator can be jointly obtained. An alternate minimizing strategy is developed to deal with the optimization problem, which is proved to have linear time complexity w.r.t. the sample number. Extensive experiments have been conducted to confirm the superiority of the proposed OMSC method. The source codes and data are available at https://github.com/ManshengChen/Code-for-OMSC-master.\n\nUnbiased learning to rank (ULTR) aims to train an unbiased ranking model from biased user click logs. Most of the current ULTR methods are based on the examination hypothesis (EH), which assumes that the click probability can be factorized into two scalar functions, one related to ranking features and the other related to bias factors. Unfortunately, the interactions among features, bias factors and clicks are complicated in practice, and usually cannot be factorized in this independent way. Fitting click data with EH could lead to model misspecification and bring the approximation error.\n\nIn this paper, we propose a vector-based EH and formulate the click probability as a dot product of two vector functions. This solution is complete due to its universality in fitting arbitrary click functions. Based on it, we propose a novel model named Vectorization to adaptively learn the relevance embeddings and sort documents by projecting embeddings onto a base vector. Extensive experiments show that our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art ULTR methods on complex real clicks as well as simple simulated clicks.\n\nTime series forecasting is a critical and challenging problem in many real applications. Recently, Transformer-based models prevail in time series forecasting due to their advancement in long-range dependencies learning. Besides, some models introduce series decomposition to further unveil reliable yet plain temporal dependencies. Unfortunately, few models could handle complicated periodical patterns, such as multiple periods, variable periods, and phase shifts in real-world datasets. Meanwhile, the notorious quadratic complexity of dot-product attentions hampers long sequence modeling. To address these challenges, we design an innovative framework Quaternion Transformer (Quatformer), along with three major components: 1). learning-to-rotate attention (LRA) based on quaternions which introduces learnable period and phase information to depict intricate periodical patterns. 2). trend normalization to normalize the series representations in hidden layers of the model considering the slowly varying characteristic of trend. 3). decoupling LRA using global memory to achieve linear complexity without losing prediction accuracy. We evaluate our framework on multiple real-world time series datasets and observe an average 8.1% and up to 18.5% MSE improvement over the best state-of-the-art baseline.\n\nEmpirical variance is a fundamental concept widely used in data management and data analytics, e.g., query optimization, approximate query processing, and feature selection. A direct solution to derive the empirical variance is scanning the whole data table, which is expensive when the data size is huge. Hence, most current works focus on approximate answers by sampling. For results with approximation guarantees, the samples usually need to be uniformly independent random, incurring high cache miss rates especially in compact columnar style layouts. An alternative uses block sampling to avoid this issue, which directly samples a block of consecutive records fitting page sizes instead of sampling one record each time. However, this provides no theoretical guarantee. Existing studies show that the practical estimations can be inaccurate as the records within a block can be correlated.\n\nMotivated by this, we investigate how to provide approximation guarantees for empirical variances with block sampling from a theoretical perspective. Our results shows that if the records stored in a table are 4-wise independent to each other according to keys, a slightly modified block sampling can provide the same approximation guarantee with the same asymptotic sampling cost as that of independent random sampling. In practice, storing records via hash clusters or hash organized tables are typical scenarios in modern commercial database systems. Thus, for data analysis on tables in the data lake or OLAP stores that are exported from such hash-based storage, our strategy can be easily integrated to improve the sampling efficiency. Based on our sampling strategy, we present an approximate algorithm for empirical variance and an approximate top-k algorithm to return the k columns with the highest empirical variance scores. Extensive experiments show that our solutions outperform existing solutions by up to an order of magnitude.\n\nLearning vectorized embeddings is at the core of various recommender systems for user-item matching. To perform efficient online inference, representation quantization, aiming to embed the latent features by a compact sequence of discrete numbers, recently shows the promising potentiality in optimizing both memory and computation overheads. However, existing work merely focuses on numerical quantization whilst ignoring the concomitant information loss issue, which, consequently, leads to conspicuous performance degradation. In this paper, we propose a novel quantization framework to learn Binarized Graph Representations for Top-K Recommendation (BiGeaR). We introduce multi-faceted quantization reinforcement at the pre-, mid-, and post-stage of binarized representation learning, which substantially retains the informativeness against embedding binarization. In addition to saving the memory footprint, it further develops solid online inference acceleration with bitwise operations, providing alternative flexibility for the realistic deployment. The empirical results over five large real-world benchmarks show that BiGeaR achieves about 22%~40% performance improvement over the state-of-the-art quantization-based recommender system, and recovers about 95%~102% of the performance capability of the best full-precision counterpart with over 8Ã time and space reduction.\n\nLogical rules are widely used to represent domain knowledge and hypothesis, which is fundamental to symbolic reasoning-based human intelligence. Very recently, it has been demonstrated that integrating logical rules into regular learning tasks can further enhance learning performance in a label-efficient manner. Many attempts have been made to learn logical rules automatically from knowledge graphs (KGs). However, a majority of existing methods entirely rely on observed rule instances to define the score function for rule evaluation and thus lack generalization ability and suffer from severe computational inefficiency. Instead of completely relying on rule instances for rule evaluation, RLogic defines a predicate representation learning-based scoring model, which is trained by sampled rule instances. In addition, RLogic incorporates one of the most significant properties of logical rules, the deductive nature, into rule learning, which is critical especially when a rule lacks supporting evidence. To push deductive reasoning deeper into rule learning, RLogic breaks a big sequential model into small atomic models in a recursive way. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that RLogic is superior to existing state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of both efficiency and effectiveness.\n\nCurrently, Vision Transformer (ViT) and its variants have demonstrated promising performance on various computer vision tasks. Nevertheless, task-irrelevant information such as background nuisance and noise in patch tokens would damage the performance of ViT-based models. In this paper, we develop Sufficient Vision Transformer (Suf-ViT) as a new solution to address this issue. In our research, we propose the Sufficiency-Blocks (S-Blocks) to be applied across the depth of Suf-ViT to disentangle and discard task-irrelevant information accurately. Besides, to boost the training of Suf-ViT, we formulate a Sufficient-Reduction Loss (SRLoss) leveraging the concept of Mutual Information (MI) that enables Suf-ViT to extract more reliable sufficient representations by removing task-irrelevant information. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets such as ImageNet, ImageNet-C, and CIFAR-10 indicate that our method can achieve state-of-the-art or competing performance over other baseline methods. Codes are available at: https://github.com/zhicheng2T0/Sufficient-Vision-Transformer.git\n\nThe problem of fitting distances by tree-metrics has received significant attention in the theoretical computer science and machine learning communities alike, due to many applications in natural language processing, phylogeny, cancer genomics and a myriad of problem areas that involve hierarchical clustering. Despite the existence of several provably exact algorithms for tree-metric fitting of data that inherently obeys tree-metric constraints, much less is known about how to best fit tree-metrics for data whose structure moderately (or substantially) differs from a tree. For such noisy data, most available algorithms perform poorly and often produce negative edge weights in representative trees. Furthermore, it is currently not known how to choose the most suitable approximation objective for noisy fitting. Our contributions are as follows. First, we propose a new approach to tree-metric denoising (HyperAid) in hyperbolic spaces which transforms the original data into data that is \"more'' tree-like, when evaluated in terms of Gromov's Î´ hyperbolicity. Second, we perform an ablation study involving two choices for the approximation objective, lp norms and the Dasgupta loss. Third, we integrate HyperAid with schemes for enforcing nonnegative edge-weights. As a result, the HyperAid platform outperforms all other existing methods in the literature, including Neighbor Joining (NJ), TreeRep and T-REX, both on synthetic and real-world data. Synthetic data is represented by edge-augmented trees and shortest-distance metrics while the real-world datasets include Zoo, Iris, Glass, Segmentation and SpamBase; on these datasets, the average improvement with respect to NJ is $125.94%$.\n\nTime-series data contains temporal order information that can guide representation learning for predictive end tasks (e.g., classification, regression). Recently, there are some attempts to leverage such order information to first pre-train time-series models by reconstructing time-series values of randomly masked time segments, followed by an end-task fine-tuning on the same dataset, demonstrating improved end-task performance. However, this learning paradigm decouples data reconstruction from the end task. We argue that the representations learnt in this way are not informed by the end task and may, therefore, be sub-optimal for the end-task performance. In fact, the importance of different timestamps can vary significantly in different end tasks. We believe that representations learnt by reconstructing important timestamps would be a better strategy for improving end-task performance. In this work, we propose TARNet, Task-Aware Reconstruction Network, a new model using Transformers to learn task-aware data reconstruction that augments end-task performance. Specifically, we design a data-driven masking strategy that uses self-attention score distribution from end-task training to sample timestamps deemed important by the end task. Then, we mask out data at those timestamps and reconstruct them, thereby making the reconstruction task-aware. This reconstruction task is trained alternately with the end task at every epoch, sharing parameters in a single model, allowing the representation learnt through reconstruction to improve end-task performance. Extensive experiments on tens of classification and regression datasets show that TARNet significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baseline models across all evaluation metrics.\n\nWe study the private k-median and k-means clustering problem in d dimensional Euclidean space. By leveraging tree embeddings, we give an efficient and easy to implement algorithm, that is empirically competitive with state of the art non private methods. We prove that our method computes a solution with cost at most O(d3/2 log n)â OPT + O(kd2 log2 n/Îµ2), where Îµ is the privacy guarantee. (The dimension term, d, can be replaced with O(log k) using standard dimension reduction techniques.) Although the worst-case guarantee is worse than that of state of the art private clustering methods, the algorithm we propose is practical, runs in near-linear, Ã (nkd), time and scales to tens of millions of points. We also show that our method is amenable to parallelization in large-scale distributed computing environments. In particular we show that our private algorithms can be implemented in logarithmic number of MPC rounds in the sublinear memory regime. Finally, we complement our theoretical analysis with an empirical evaluation demonstrating the algorithm's efficiency and accuracy in comparison to other privacy clustering baselines.\n\nThe interactive graph search (IGS) problem aims to locate an initially unknown target node leveraging human intelligence. In IGS, we can gradually find the target node by sequentially asking humans some reachability queries like \"is the target node reachable from a given node x?\". However, human workers may make mistakes when answering these queries. Motivated by this concern, in this paper, we study a noisy version of the IGS problem. Our objective in this problem is to minimize the query complexity while ensuring accuracy. We propose a method to select the query node such that we can push the search process as much as possible and an online method to infer which node is the target after collecting a new answer. By rigorous theoretical analysis, we show that the query complexity of our approach is near-optimal up to a constant factor. The extensive experiments on two real datasets also demonstrate the superiorities of our approach.\n\nFederated learning (FL) refers to the paradigm of learning models over a collaborative research network involving multiple clients without sacrificing privacy. Recently, there have been rising concerns on the distributional discrepancies across different clients, which could even cause counterproductive consequences when collaborating with others. While it is not necessarily that collaborating with all clients will achieve the best performance, in this paper, we study a rational collaboration called \"collaboration equilibrium'' (CE), where smaller collaboration coalitions are formed. Each client collaborates with certain members who maximally improve the model learning and isolates the others who make little contribution. We propose the concept of benefit graph which describes how each client can benefit from collaborating with other clients and advance a Pareto optimization approach to identify the optimal collaborators. Then we theoretically prove that we can reach a CE from the benefit graph through an iterative graph operation. Our framework provides a new way of setting up collaborations in a research network. Experiments on both synthetic and real world data sets are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.\n\nPost-click conversion rate (CVR) prediction is an essential task for discovering user interests and increasing platform revenues in a range of industrial applications. One of the most challenging problems of this task is the existence of severe selection bias caused by the inherent self-selection behavior of users and the item selection process of systems. Currently, doubly robust (DR) learning approaches achieve the state-of-the-art performance for debiasing CVR prediction. However, in this paper, by theoretically analyzing the bias, variance and generalization bounds of DR methods, we find that existing DR approaches may have poor generalization caused by inaccurate estimation of propensity scores and imputation errors, which often occur in practice. Motivated by such analysis, we propose a generalized learning framework that not only unifies existing DR methods, but also provides a valuable opportunity to develop a series of new debiasing techniques to accommodate different application scenarios. Based on the framework, we propose two new DR methods, namely DR-BIAS and DR-MSE. DR-BIAS directly controls the bias of DR loss, while DR-MSE balances the bias and variance flexibly, which achieves better generalization performance. In addition, we propose a novel tri-level joint learning optimization method for DR-MSE in CVR prediction, and an efficient training algorithm correspondingly. We conduct extensive experiments on both real-world and semi-synthetic datasets, which validate the effectiveness of our proposed methods.\n\nWe are interested in discovering those patterns from data with an empirical frequency that is significantly differently than expected. To avoid spurious results, yet achieve high statistical power, we propose to sequentially control for false discoveries during the search. To avoid redundancy, we propose to update our expectations whenever we discover a significant pattern. To efficiently consider the exponentially sized search space, we employ an easy-to-compute upper bound on significance, and propose an effective search strategy for sets of significant patterns. Through an extensive set of experiments on synthetic data, we show that our method, Spass, recovers the ground truth reliably, does so efficiently, and without redundancy. On real-world data we show it works well on both single and multiple classes, on low and high dimensional data, and through case studies that it discovers meaningful results.\n\nBidirectional Transformer architectures are state-of-the-art sequential recommendation models that use a bi-directional representation capacity based on the Cloze task, a.k.a. Masked Language Modeling. The latter aims to predict randomly masked items within the sequence. Because they assume that the true interacted item is the most relevant one, an exposure bias results, where non-interacted items with low exposure propensities are assumed to be irrelevant. The most common approach to mitigating exposure bias in recommendation has been Inverse Propensity Scoring (IPS), which consists of down-weighting the interacted predictions in the loss function in proportion to their propensities of exposure, yielding a theoretically unbiased learning. In this work, we argue and prove that IPS does not extend to sequential recommendation because it fails to account for the temporal nature of the problem. We then propose a novel propensity scoring mechanism, which can theoretically debias the Cloze task in sequential recommendation. Finally we empirically demonstrate the debiasing capabilities of our proposed approach and its robustness to the severity of exposure bias.\n\nThe problem of algorithmic recourse has been explored for supervised machine learning models, to provide more interpretable, transparent and robust outcomes from decision support systems. An unexplored area is that of algorithmic recourse for anomaly detection, specifically for tabular data with only discrete feature values. Here the problem is to present a set of counterfactuals that are deemed normal by the underlying anomaly detection model so that applications can utilize this information for explanation purposes or to recommend countermeasures. We present an approach-Context preserving Algorithmic Recourse for Anomalies in Tabular data(CARAT), that is effective, scalable, and agnostic to the underlying anomaly detection model. CARAT uses a transformer based encoder-decoder model to explain an anomaly by finding features with low likelihood. Subsequently semantically coherent counterfactuals are generated by modifying the highlighted features, using the overall context of features in the anomalous instance(s). Extensive experiments help demonstrate the efficacy of CARAT.\n\nData-driven societal event forecasting methods exploit relevant historical information to predict future events. These methods rely on historical labeled data and cannot accurately predict events when data are limited or of poor quality. Studying causal effects between events goes beyond correlation analysis and can contribute to a more robust prediction of events. However, incorporating causality analysis in data-driven event forecasting is challenging due to several factors: (i) Events occur in a complex and dynamic social environment. Many unobserved variables, i.e., hidden confounders, affect both potential causes and outcomes. (ii) Given spatiotemporal non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data, modeling hidden confounders for accurate causal effect estimation is not trivial. In this work, we introduce a deep learning framework that integrates causal effect estimation into event forecasting. We first study the problem of Individual Treatment Effect (ITE) estimation from observational event data with spatiotemporal attributes and present a novel causal inference model to estimate ITEs. We then incorporate the learned event-related causal information into event prediction as prior knowledge. Two robust learning modules, including a feature reweighting module and an approximate constraint loss, are introduced to enable prior knowledge injection. We evaluate the proposed causal inference model on real-world event datasets and validate the effectiveness of proposed robust learning modules in event prediction by feeding learned causal information into different deep learning methods. Experimental results demonstrate the strengths of the proposed causal inference model for ITE estimation in societal events and showcase the beneficial properties of robust learning modules in societal event forecasting.\n\nRecommender systems should answer the intervention question \"if recommending an item to a user, what would the feedback be\", calling for estimating the causal effect of a recommendation on user feedback. Generally, this requires blocking the effect of confounders that simultaneously affect the recommendation and feedback. To mitigate the confounding bias, a strategy is incorporating propensity into model learning. However, existing methods forgo possible unmeasured confounders (e.g., user financial status), which can result in biased propensities and hurt recommendation performance. This work combats the risk of unmeasured confounders in recommender systems.\n\nTowards this end, we propose Robust Deconfounder (RD) that accounts for the effect of unmeasured confounders on propensities, under the mild assumption that the effect is bounded. It estimates the bound with sensitivity analysis, learning a recommender model robust to unmeasured confounders within the bound by adversarial learning. However, pursuing robustness within a bound may restrict model accuracy. To avoid the trade-off between robustness and accuracy, we further propose Benchmarked RD (BRD) that incorporates a pre-trained model into the learning as the benchmark. Theoretical analyses prove the stronger robustness of our methods compared to existing propensity-based deconfounders, and also prove the no-harm property of BRD. Our methods are applicable to any propensity-based estimators, where we select three representative ones: IPS, Doubly Robust, and AutoDebias. We conduct experiments on three real-world datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods.\n\nGraph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown satisfying performance in various graph analytical problems. Hence, they have become the de facto solution in a variety of decision-making scenarios. However, GNNs could yield biased results against certain demographic subgroups. Some recent works have empirically shown that the biased structure of the input network is a significant source of bias for GNNs. Nevertheless, no studies have systematically scrutinized which part of the input network structure leads to biased predictions for any given node. The low transparency on how the structure of the input network influences the bias in GNN outcome largely limits the safe adoption of GNNs in various decision-critical scenarios. In this paper, we study a novel research problem of structural explanation of bias in GNNs. Specifically, we propose a novel post-hoc explanation framework to identify two edge sets that can maximally account for the exhibited bias and maximally contribute to the fairness level of the GNN prediction for any given node, respectively. Such explanations not only provide a comprehensive understanding of bias/fairness of GNN predictions but also have practical significance in building an effective yet fair GNN model. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework towards delivering effective structural explanations for the bias of GNNs. Open-source code can be found at https://github.com/yushundong/REFEREE.\n\nThe widespread use of machine learning algorithms in settings that directly affect human lives has instigated significant interest in designing variants of these algorithms that are provably fair. Recent work in this direction has produced numerous algorithms for the fundamental problem of clustering under many different notions of fairness. Perhaps the most common family of notions currently studied is group fairness, in which proportional group representation is ensured in every cluster. We extend this direction by considering the downstream application of clustering and how group fairness should be ensured for such a setting. Specifically, we consider a common setting in which a decision-maker runs a clustering algorithm, inspects the center of each cluster, and decides an appropriate outcome (label) for its corresponding cluster. In hiring for example, there could be two outcomes, positive (hire) or negative (reject), and each cluster would be assigned one of these two outcomes. To ensure group fairness in such a setting, we would desire proportional group representation in every label but not necessarily in every cluster as is done in group fair clustering. We provide algorithms for such problems and show that in contrast to their NP-hard counterparts in group fair clustering, they permit efficient solutions. We also consider a well-motivated alternative setting where the decision-maker is free to assign labels to the clusters regardless of the centers' positions in the metric space. We show that this setting exhibits interesting transitions from computationally hard to easy according to additional constraints on the problem. Moreover, when the constraint parameters take on natural values we show a randomized algorithm for this setting that always achieves an optimal clustering and satisfies the fairness constraints in expectation. Finally, we run experiments on real world datasets that validate the effectiveness of our algorithms.\n\nRegression models are learned over multiple variables, e.g., using engine torque and speed to predict its fuel consumption. In practice, the values of these variables are often collected separately, e.g., by different sensors in a vehicle, and need to be aligned first in a tuple before learning. Unfortunately, flowing to various issues like network delays, values generated at the same time could be recorded with different timestamps, making the alignment diffcult. According to our study in a vehicle manufacturer, engine torque, speed and fuel consumption values are mostly not recorded with the same timestamps. Aligning tuples by simply concatenating values of variables with equal timestamps leads to limited data for learning regression model. To deal with timestamp variations, existing time series matching techniques rely on the similarity of values and timestamps, which unfortunately are very likely to be absent among the variables in regression (no similarity between engine torque and speed values). In this sense, we propose to bridge tuple alignment and regression. Rather than similar values and timestamps, we align the values of different variables in a tuple that (i) are recorded in a short period, i.e., time constraint, and more importantly (ii) coincide well with the regression model, known as model constraint. Our theoretical and technical contributions include (1) formulating the problem of tuple alignment with time and model constraints, (2) proving NP-completeness of the problem, (3) devising an approximation algorithm with performance guarantee, and (4) proposing efficient pruning strategies for the algorithm. Experiments over real world datasets, including the aforesaid engine data collected by a vehicle manufacturer, demonstrate that our proposal outperforms the existing methods on alignment accuracy and improves regression precision.\n\nKnowledge distillation (KD) has demonstrated its effectiveness to boost the performance of graph neural networks (GNNs), where its goal is to distill knowledge from a deeper teacher GNN into a shallower student GNN. However, it is actually difficult to train a satisfactory teacher GNN due to the well-known over-parametrized and over-smoothing issues, leading to invalid knowledge transfer in practical applications. In this paper, we propose the first Free-direction Knowledge Distillation framework via Reinforcement learning for GNNs, called FreeKD, which is no longer required to provide a deeper well-optimized teacher GNN. The core idea of our work is to collaboratively build two shallower GNNs in an effort to exchange knowledge between them via reinforcement learning in a hierarchical way. As we observe that one typical GNN model often has better and worse performances at different nodes during training, we devise a dynamic and free-direction knowledge transfer strategy that consists of two levels of actions: 1) node-level action determines the directions of knowledge transfer between the corresponding nodes of two networks; and then 2) structure-level action determines which of the local structures generated by the node-level actions to be propagated. In essence, our FreeKD is a general and principled framework which can be naturally compatible with GNNs of different architectures. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate our FreeKD outperforms two base GNNs in a large margin, and shows its efficacy to various GNNs. More surprisingly, our FreeKD has comparable or even better performance than traditional KD algorithms that distill knowledge from a deeper and stronger teacher GNN.\n\nGraph metric learning methods aim to learn the distance metric over graphs such that similar (e.g., same class) graphs are closer and dissimilar (e.g., different class) graphs are farther apart. This is of critical importance in many graph classification applications such as drug discovery and epidemics categorization. Most, if not all, graph metric learning techniques consider the input graph as static, and largely ignore the intrinsic dynamics of temporal graphs. However, in practice, a graph typically has heterogeneous dynamics (e.g., microscopic and macroscopic evolution patterns). As such, labeling a temporal graph is usually expensive and also requires background knowledge. To learn a good metric over temporal graphs, we propose a temporal graph metric learning framework, Temp-GFSM. With only a few labeled temporal graphs, Temp-GFSM outputs a good metric that can accurately classify different temporal graphs and be adapted to discover new subspaces for unseen classes. Each proposed component in Temp-GFSM answers the following questions: What patterns are evolving in a temporal graph? How to weigh these patterns to represent the characteristics of different temporal classes? And how to learn the metric with the guidance from only a few labels? Finally, the experimental results on real-world temporal graph classification tasks from various domains show the effectiveness of our Temp-GFSM.\n\nProtein engineering has important applications in drug discovery. Among others, inverse protein folding is a fundamental task in protein design, which aims at generating protein's amino acid sequence given a 3D graph structure. However, most existing methods for inverse protein folding are based on sequential generative models and therefore limited in uncertainty quantification and exploration ability to the entire protein space. To address the issues, we propose a sampling method for inverse protein folding (SIPF). Specifically, we formulate inverse protein folding as a sampling problem and design two pretrained neural networks as Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) proposal distribution. To ensure sampling efficiency, we further design (i) an adaptive sampling scheme to select variables for sampling and (ii) an approximate target distribution as a surrogate of the unavailable target distribution. Empirical studies have been conducted to validate the effectiveness of SIPF, achieving 7.4% relative improvement on recovery rate and 6.4% relative reduction in perplexity compared to the best baseline.\n\nIn recent years, therapeutic antibodies have become one of the fastest-growing classes of drugs and have been approved for the treatment of a wide range of indications, from cancer to autoimmune diseases. Complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) are part of the variable chains in antibodies and determine specific antibody-antigen binding. Some explorations use in silicon methods to design antibody CDR loops. However, the existing methods faced the challenges of maintaining the specific geometry shape of the CDR loops. This paper proposes a Constrained Energy Model (CEM) to address this issue. Specifically, we design a constrained manifold to characterize the geometry constraints of the CDR loops. Then we design the energy model in the constrained manifold and only depict the energy landscape of the manifold instead of the whole space in the vanilla energy model. The geometry shape of the generated CDR loops is automatically preserved. Theoretical analysis shows that learning on the constrained manifold requires less sample complexity than the unconstrained method. CEM's superiority is validated via thorough empirical studies, achieving consistent and significant improvement with up to 33.4% relative reduction in terms of 3D geometry error (Root Mean Square Deviation, RMSD) and 8.4% relative reduction in terms of amino acid sequence metric (perplexity) compared to the best baseline method. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/futianfan/energy_model4antibody_design\n\nRecent years have seen a renewed interest in interpretable machine learning, which seeks insight into how a model achieves a prediction. Here, we focus on the relatively unexplored case of interpretable clustering. In our approach, the cluster assignments of the training instances are constrained to be the output of a decision tree. This has two advantages: 1) it makes it possible to understand globally how an instance is mapped to a cluster, in particular to see which features are used for which cluster; 2) it forces the clusters to respect a hierarchical structure while optimizing the original clustering objective function. Rather than the traditional axis-aligned trees, we use sparse oblique trees, which have far more modelling power, particularly with high-dimensional data, while remaining interpretable. Our approach applies to any clustering method which is defined by optimizing a cost function and we demonstrate it with two k-means variants.\n\nThe lottery ticket hypothesis (LTH) states that a randomly initialized dense network contains sub-networks that can be trained in isolation to the performance of the dense network. In this paper, to achieve rapid learning with less computational cost, we explore LTH in the context of meta learning. First, we experimentally show that there are sparse sub-networks, known as meta winning tickets, which can be meta-trained to few-shot classification accuracy to the original backbone. The application of LTH in meta learning enables the adaptation of meta-trained networks on various IoT devices with fewer computation. However, the status quo to identify winning tickets requires iterative training and pruning, which is particularly expensive for finding meta winning tickets. To this end, then we investigate the inter- and intra-layer patterns among different meta winning tickets, and propose a scheme for early detection of a meta winning ticket. The proposed scheme enables efficient training in resource-limited devices. Besides, it also designs a lightweight solution to search the meta winning ticket. Evaluations on standard few-shot classification benchmarks show that we can find competitive meta winning tickets with 20% weights of the original backbone, while incurring only 8%-14% (Conv-4) and 19%-29% (ResNet-12) computation overhead (measured by FLOPs) of the standard winning ticket finding scheme.\n\nEntity alignment (EA) aims at finding equivalent entities in different knowledge graphs (KGs). Embedding-based approaches have dominated the EA task in recent years. Those methods face problems that come from the geometric properties of embedding vectors, including hubness and isolation. To solve these geometric problems, many normalization approaches have been adopted for EA. However, the increasing scale of KGs renders it hard for EA models to adopt the normalization processes, thus limiting their usage in real-world applications. To tackle this challenge, we present ClusterEA, a general framework that is capable of scaling up EA models and enhancing their results by leveraging normalization methods on mini-batches with a high entity equivalent rate. ClusterEA contains three components to align entities between large-scale KGs, including stochastic training, ClusterSampler, and SparseFusion. It first trains a large-scale Siamese GNN for EA in a stochastic fashion to produce entity embeddings. Based on the embeddings, a novel ClusterSampler strategy is proposed for sampling highly overlapped mini-batches. Finally, ClusterEA incorporates SparseFusion, which normalizes local and global similarity and then fuses all similarity matrices to obtain the final similarity matrix. Extensive experiments with real-life datasets on EA benchmarks offer insight into the proposed framework, and suggest that it is capable of outperforming the state-of-the-art scalable EA framework by up to 8 times in terms of Hits@1.\n\nDespite the fast progress of explanation techniques in modern Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) where the main focus is handling \"how to generate the explanations\", advanced research questions that examine the quality of the explanation itself (e.g., \"whether the explanations are accurate\") and improve the explanation quality (e.g., \"how to adjust the model to generate more accurate explanations when explanations are inaccurate\") are still relatively under-explored. To guide the model toward better explanations, techniques in explanation supervision - which add supervision signals on the model explanation - have started to show promising effects on improving both the generalizability as and intrinsic interpretability of Deep Neural Networks. However, the research on supervising explanations, especially in vision-based applications represented through saliency maps, is in its early stage due to several inherent challenges: 1) inaccuracy of the human explanation annotation boundary, 2) incompleteness of the human explanation annotation region, and 3) inconsistency of the data distribution between human annotation and model explanation maps. To address the challenges, we propose a generic RES framework for guiding visual explanation by developing a novel objective that handles inaccurate boundary, incomplete region, and inconsistent distribution of human annotations, with a theoretical justification on model generalizability. Extensive experiments on two real-world image datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework on enhancing both the reasonability of the explanation and the performance of the backbone DNNs model.\n\nKnowledge Graph (KG) and its variant of ontology have been widely used for knowledge representation, and have shown to be quite effective in augmenting Zero-shot Learning (ZSL). However, existing ZSL methods that utilize KGs all neglect the intrinsic complexity of inter-class relationships represented in KGs. One typical feature is that a class is often related to other classes in different semantic aspects. In this paper, we focus on ontologies for augmenting ZSL, and propose to learn disentangled ontology embeddings guided by ontology properties to capture and utilize more fine-grained class relationships in different aspects. We also contribute a new ZSL framework named DOZSL, which contains two new ZSL solutions based on generative models and graph propagation models, respectively, for effectively utilizing the disentangled ontology embeddings. Extensive evaluations have been conducted on five benchmarks across zero-shot image classification (ZS-IMGC) and zero-shot KG completion (ZS-KGC). DOZSL often achieves better performance than the state-of-the-art, and its components have been verified by ablation studies and case studies. Our codes and datasets are available at https://github.com/zjukg/DOZSL.\n\nThe emerging meta- and multi-verse landscape is yet another step towards the more prevalent use of already ubiquitous online markets. In such markets, recommender systems play critical roles by offering items of interest to the users, thereby narrowing down a vast search space that comprises hundreds of thousands of products. Recommender systems are usually designed to learn common user behaviors and rely on them for inference. This approach, while effective, is oblivious to subtle idiosyncrasies that differentiate humans from each other. Focusing on this observation, we propose an architecture that relies on common patterns as well as individual behaviors to tailor its recommendations for each person. Simulations under a controlled environment show that our proposed model learns interpretable personalized user behaviors. Our empirical results on Nielsen Consumer Panel dataset indicate that the proposed approach achieves up to 27.9% performance improvement compared to the state-of-the-art.\n\nMachine Learning is beginning to provide state-of-the-art performance in a range of environmental applications such as streamflow prediction in a hydrologic basin. However, building accurate broad-scale models for streamflow remains challenging in practice due to the variability in the dominant hydrologic processes, which are best captured by sets of process-related basin characteristics. Existing basin characteristics suffer from noise and uncertainty, among many other things, which adversely impact model performance. To tackle the above challenges, in this paper, we propose a novel Knowledge-guided Self-Supervised Learning (KGSSL) inverse framework to extract system characteristics from driver(input) and response(output) data. This first-of-its-kind framework achieves robust performance even when characteristics are corrupted or missing. We evaluate the KGSSL framework in the context of stream flow modeling using CAMELS (Catchment Attributes and MEteorology for Large-sample Studies) which is a widely used hydrology benchmark dataset. Specifically, KGSSL outperforms baseline by 16% in predicting missing characteristics. Furthermore, in the context of forward modelling, KGSSL inferred characteristics provide a 35% improvement in performance over a standard baseline when the static characteristic are unknown.\n\nTracking a targeted subset of nodes in an evolving graph is important for many real-world applications. Existing methods typically focus on identifying anomalous edges or finding anomaly graph snapshots in a stream way. However, edge-oriented methods cannot quantify how individual nodes change over time while others need to maintain representations of the whole graph all the time, thus computationally inefficient.\n\nThis paper proposes DynAnom, an efficient framework to quantify the changes and localize per-node anomalies over large dynamic weighted-graphs. Thanks to recent advances in dynamic representation learning based on Personalized PageRank, DynAnom is 1) efficient: the time complexity is linear to the number of edge events and independent of node size of the input graph; 2) effective: DynAnom can successfully track topological changes reflecting real-world anomaly; 3) flexible: different type of anomaly score functions can be defined for various applications. Experiments demonstrate these properties on both benchmark graph datasets and a new large real-world dynamic graph. Specifically, an instantiation method based on DynAnom achieves the accuracy of 0.5425 compared with 0.2790, the best baseline, on the task of node-level anomaly localization while running 2.3 times faster than the baseline. We present a real-world case study and further demonstrate the usability of DynAnom for anomaly discovery over large-scale graphs.\n\nRepresentation learning has transformed the problem of information retrieval into one of finding the approximate set of nearest neighbors in a high dimensional vector space. With limited hardware resources and time-critical queries, the retrieval engines face an inherent tension between latency, accuracy, scalability, compactness, and the ability to load balance in distributed settings. To improve the trade-off, we propose a new algorithm, called BaLanced Index for Scalable Search (BLISS), a highly tunable indexing algorithm with enviably small index sizes, making it easy to scale to billions of vectors. It iteratively refines partitions of items by learning the relevant buckets directly from the query-item relevance data. To ensure that the buckets are balanced, BLISS uses the power-of-K choices strategy. We show that BLISS provides superior load balancing with high probability (and under very benign assumptions). Due to its design, BLISS can be employed for both near-neighbor retrieval (ANN problem) and extreme classification (XML problem). For the case of ANN, we train and index 4 datasets with billion vectors each. We compare the recall, inference time, indexing time, and index size for BLISS with the two most popular and well-optimized libraries- Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) graph and Facebook's FAISS. BLISS requires 100x lesser RAM than HNSW, making it fit in memory on commodity machines while taking a similar inference time as HNSW for the same recall. Against FAISS-IVF, BLISS achieves similar performance with 3-4x less memory requirement. BLISS is both data and model parallel, making it ideal for distributed implementation for training and inference. For the case of XML, BLISS surpasses the best baselines' precision while being 5x faster for inference on popular multi-label datasets with half a million classes.\n\nAny human activity can be represented as a temporal sequence of actions performed to achieve a certain goal. Unlike machine-made time series, these action sequences are highly disparate as the time taken to finish a similar action might vary between different persons. Therefore, understanding the dynamics of these sequences is essential for many downstream tasks such as activity length prediction, goal prediction, etc. Existing neural approaches that model an activity sequence are either limited to visual data or are task-specific, i.e., limited to next action or goal prediction. In this paper, we present ProActive, a neural marked temporal point process (MTPP) framework for modeling the continuous-time distribution of actions in an activity sequence while simultaneously addressing three high-impact problems - next action prediction, sequence-goal prediction, and end-to-end sequence generation. Specifically, we utilize a self-attention module with temporal normalizing flows to model the influence and the inter-arrival times between actions in a sequence. Moreover, for time-sensitive prediction, we perform an early detection of sequence goal via a constrained margin-based optimization procedure. This in-turn allows ProActive to predict the sequence goal using a limited number of actions. Extensive experiments on sequences derived from three activity recognition datasets show the significant accuracy boost of ProActive over the state-of-the-art in terms of action and goal prediction, and the first-ever application of end-to-end action sequence generation.\n\nDue to the curse of statistical heterogeneity across clients, adopting a personalized federated learning method has become an essential choice for the successful deployment of federated learning-based services. Among diverse branches of personalization techniques, a model mixture-based personalization method is preferred as each client has their own personalized model as a result of federated learning. It usually requires a local model and a federated model, but this approach is either limited to partial parameter exchange or requires additional local updates, each of which is helpless to novel clients and burdensome to the client's computational capacity. As the existence of a connected subspace containing diverse low-loss solutions between two or more independent deep networks has been discovered, we combined this interesting property with the model mixture-based personalized federated learning method for improved performance of personalization. We proposed SuPerFed, a personalized federated learning method that induces an explicit connection between the optima of the local and the federated model in weight space for boosting each other. Through extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets, we demonstrated that our method achieves consistent gains in both personalization performance and robustness to problematic scenarios possible in realistic services.\n\nTraffic demand forecasting by deep neural networks has attracted widespread interest in both academia and industry society. Among them, the pairwise Origin-Destination (OD) demand prediction is a valuable but challenging problem due to several factors: (i) the large number of possible OD pairs, (ii) implicitness of spatial dependence, and (iii) complexity of traffic states. To address the above issues, this paper proposes a Continuous-time and Multi-level dynamic graph representation learning method for Origin-Destination demand prediction (CMOD). Firstly, a continuous-time dynamic graph representation learning framework is constructed, which maintains a dynamic state vector for each traffic node (metro stations or taxi zones). The state vectors keep historical transaction information and are continuously updated according to the most recently happened transactions. Secondly, a multi-level structure learning module is proposed to model the spatial dependency of station-level nodes. It can not only exploit relations between nodes adaptively from data, but also share messages and representations via cluster-level and area-level virtual nodes. Lastly, a cross-level fusion module is designed to integrate multi-level memories and generate comprehensive node representations for the final prediction. Extensive experiments are conducted on two real-world datasets from Beijing Subway and New York Taxi, and the results demonstrate the superiority of our model against the state-of-the-art approaches.\n\nHierarchical clustering produces a cluster tree with different granularities. As a result, hierarchical clustering provides richer information and insight into a dataset than partitioning clustering. However, hierarchical clustering algorithms often have two weaknesses: scalability and the capacity to handle clusters of varying densities. This is because they rely on pairwise point-based similarity calculations and the similarity measure is independent of data distribution. In this paper, we aim to overcome these weaknesses and propose a novel efficient hierarchical clustering called StreaKHC that enables massive streaming data to be mined. The enabling factor is the use of a scalable point-set kernel to measure the similarity between an existing cluster in the cluster tree and a new point in the data stream. It also has an efficient mechanism to update the hierarchical structure so that a high-quality cluster tree can be maintained in real-time. Our extensive empirical evaluation shows that StreaKHC is more accurate and more efficient than existing hierarchical clustering algorithms.\n\nDeep graph neural networks (GNNs) have been shown to be expressive for modeling graph-structured data. Nevertheless, the overstacked architecture of deep graph models makes it difficult to deploy and rapidly test on mobile or embedded systems. To compress over-stacked GNNs, knowledge distillation via a teacher-student architecture turns out to be an effective technique, where the key step is to measure the discrepancy between teacher and student networks with predefined distance functions. However, using the same distance for graphs of various structures may be unfit, and the optimal distance formulation is hard to determine. To tackle these problems, we propose a novel Adversarial Knowledge Distillation framework for graph models named GraphAKD, which adversarially trains a discriminator and a generator to adaptively detect and decrease the discrepancy. Specifically, noticing that the well-captured inter-node and inter-class correlations favor the success of deep GNNs, we propose to criticize the inherited knowledge from node-level and class-level views with a trainable discriminator. The discriminator distinguishes between teacher knowledge and what the student inherits, while the student GNN works as a generator and aims to fool the discriminator. Experiments on nodelevel and graph-level classification benchmarks demonstrate that GraphAKD improves the student performance by a large margin. The results imply that GraphAKD can precisely transfer knowledge from a complicated teacher GNN to a compact student GNN.\n\nPartial-label learning (PLL) solves the problem where each training instance is assigned a candidate label set, among which only one is the ground-truth label. The core of PLL is to learn efficient feature representations to facilitate label disambiguation. However, existing PLL methods only learn plain representations by coarse supervision, which is incapable of capturing sufficiently distinguishable representations, especially when confronted with the knotty label ambiguity, i.e., certain candidate labels share similar visual patterns. In this paper, we propose a novel framework partial label learning with semantic label representations dubbed ParSE, which consists of two synergistic processes, including visual-semantic representation learning and powerful label disambiguation. In the former process, we propose a novel weighted calibration rank loss that has two implications. First, it implies a progressive calibration strategy that utilizes the disambiguated label confidence to weight the similarity between each image feature embedding and its corresponding semantic label representations of all candidates. Second, it also considers the ranking relationship between candidate and non-candidate ones. Based on learned visual-semantic representations, subsequent label disambiguation is desirably endowed with more powerful abilities. Experiments on benchmarks show that ParSE outperforms state-of-the-art counterparts.\n\nGiven raster imagery features and imperfect vector training labels with registration uncertainty, this paper studies a deep learning framework that can quantify and reduce the registration uncertainty of training labels as well as train neural network parameters simultaneously. The problem is important in broad applications such as streamline classification on Earth imagery or tissue segmentation on medical imagery, whereby annotating precise vector labels is expensive and time-consuming. However, the problem is challenging due to the gap between the vector representation of class labels and the raster representation of image features and the need for training neural networks with uncertain label locations. Existing research on uncertain training labels often focuses on uncertainty in label class semantics or characterizes label registration uncertainty at the pixel level (not contiguous vectors). To fill the gap, this paper proposes a novel learning framework that explicitly quantifies vector labels' registration uncertainty. We propose a registration-uncertainty-aware loss function and design an iterative uncertainty reduction algorithm by re-estimating the posterior of true vector label locations distribution based on a Gaussian process. Evaluations on real-world datasets in National Hydrography Dataset refinement show that the proposed approach significantly outperforms several baselines in the registration uncertainty estimations performance and classification performance.\n\nWe propose a new kernel that quantifies success for the task of computing a core-periphery partition for an undirected network. Finding the associated optimal partitioning may be expressed in the form of a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problem, to which a state-of-the-art quantum annealer may be applied. We therefore make use of the new objective function to (a) judge the performance of a quantum annealer, and (b) compare this approach with existing heuristic core-periphery partitioning methods. The quantum annealing is performed on a commercially available D-Wave machine. The QUBO problem involves a full matrix even when the underlying network is sparse. Hence, we develop and test a sparsified version of the original QUBO which increases the available problem dimension for the quantum annealer. Results are provided on both synthetic and real data sets, and we conclude that the QUBO/quantum annealing approach offers benefits in terms of optimizing this new quantity of interest.\n\nRecurrent neural networks (RNN) are widely used for handling sequence data. However, their black-box nature makes it difficult for users to interpret the decision-making process. We propose a new method to construct deterministic finite automata to explain RNN. In an automaton, states are abstracted from hidden states produced by the RNN, and the transitions represent input symbols. Thus, users can follow the paths of transitions, called patterns, to understand how a prediction is produced. Existing methods for extracting automata partition the hidden state space at the beginning of the extraction, which often leads to solutions that are either inaccurate or too large in size to comprehend. Unlike previous methods, our approach allows the automata states to be formed adaptively during the extraction. Instead of defining patterns on pre-determined clusters, our proposed model, AdaAX, identifies small sets of hidden states determined by patterns with finer granularity in data. Then these small sets are gradually merged to form states, allowing users to trade fidelity for lower complexity. Experiments show that our automata can achieve higher fidelity while being significantly smaller in size than baseline methods on synthetic and complex real datasets.\n\nIn order to develop effective sequential recommenders, a series of sequence representation learning (SRL) methods are proposed to model historical user behaviors. Most existing SRL methods rely on explicit item IDs for developing the sequence models to better capture user preference. Though effective to some extent, these methods are difficult to be transferred to new recommendation scenarios, due to the limitation by explicitly modeling item IDs. To tackle this issue, we present a novel universal sequence representation learning approach, named UniSRec. The proposed approach utilizes the associated description text of items to learn transferable representations across different recommendation scenarios. For learning universal item representations, we design a lightweight item encoding architecture based on parametric whitening and mixture-of-experts enhanced adaptor. For learning universal sequence representations, we introduce two contrastive pre-training tasks by sampling multi-domain negatives. With the pre-trained universal sequence representation model, our approach can be effectively transferred to new recommendation domains or platforms in a parameter-efficient way, under either inductive or transductive settings. Extensive experiments conducted on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Especially, our approach also leads to a performance improvement in a cross-platform setting, showing the strong transferability of the proposed universal SRL method. The code and pre-trained model are available at: https://github.com/RUCAIBox/UniSRec.\n\nSelf-supervised learning (SSL) has been extensively explored in recent years. Particularly, generative SSL has seen emerging success in natural language processing and other fields, such as the wide adoption of BERT and GPT. Despite this, contrastive learning---which heavily relies on structural data augmentation and complicated training strategies---has been the dominant approach in graph SSL, while the progress of generative SSL on graphs, especially graph autoencoders (GAEs), has thus far not reached the potential as promised in other fields. In this paper, we identify and examine the issues that negatively impact the development of GAEs, including their reconstruction objective, training robustness, and error metric. We present a masked graph autoencoder GraphMAE (code is publicly available at https://github.com/THUDM/GraphMAE) that mitigates these issues for generative self-supervised graph learning. Instead of reconstructing structures, we propose to focus on feature reconstruction with both a masking strategy and scaled cosine error that benefit the robust training of GraphMAE. We conduct extensive experiments on 21 public datasets for three different graph learning tasks. The results manifest that GraphMAE---a simple graph autoencoder with our careful designs---can consistently generate outperformance over both contrastive and generative state-of-the-art baselines. This study provides an understanding of graph autoencoders and demonstrates the potential of generative self-supervised learning on graphs.\n\nWe study the problem of few-shot Fine-grained Entity Typing (FET), where only a few annotated entity mentions with contexts are given for each entity type. Recently, prompt-based tuning has demonstrated superior performance to standard fine-tuning in few-shot scenarios by formulating the entity type classification task as a ''fill-in-the-blank'' problem. This allows effective utilization of the strong language modeling capability of Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs). Despite the success of current prompt-based tuning approaches, two major challenges remain: (1) the verbalizer in prompts is either manually designed or constructed from external knowledge bases, without considering the target corpus and label hierarchy information, and (2) current approaches mainly utilize the representation power of PLMs, but have not explored their generation power acquired through extensive general-domain pre-training. In this work, we propose a novel framework for few-shot FET consisting of two modules: (1) an entity type label interpretation module automatically learns to relate type labels to the vocabulary by jointly leveraging few-shot instances and the label hierarchy, and (2) a type-based contextualized instance generator produces new instances based on given instances to enlarge the training set for better generalization. On three benchmark datasets, our model outperforms existing methods by significant margins.\n\nLogical reasoning over Knowledge Graphs (KGs) for first-order logic (FOL) queries performs the query inference over KGs with logical operators, including conjunction, disjunction, existential quantification and negation, to approximate true answers in embedding spaces. However, most existing work imposes strong distributional assumptions (e.g., Beta distribution) to represent entities and queries into presumed distributional shape, which limits their expressive power. Moreover, query embeddings are challenging due to the relational complexities in multi-relational KGs (e.g., symmetry, anti-symmetry and transitivity). To bridge the gap, we propose a logical query reasoning framework, Line Embedding (LinE), for FOL queries. To relax the distributional assumptions, we introduce the logic space transformation layer, which is a generic neural function that converts embeddings from probabilistic distribution space to LinE embeddings space. To tackle multi-relational and logical complexities, we formulate neural relation-specific projections and individual logical operators to truthfully ground LinE query embeddings on logical regularities and KG factoids. Lastly, to verify the LinE embedding quality, we generate a FOL query dataset from WordNet, which richly encompasses hierarchical relations. Extensive experiments show superior reasoning sensitivity of LinE on three benchmarks against strong baselines, particularly for multi-hop relational queries and negation-related queries.\n\nIn recent years, specific evaluation metrics for time series anomaly detection algorithms have been developed to handle the limitations of the classical precision and recall. However, such metrics are heuristically built as an aggregate of multiple desirable aspects, introduce parameters and wipe out the interpretability of the output. In this article, we first highlight the limitations of the classical precision/recall, as well as the main issues of the recent event-based metrics -- for instance, we show that an adversary algorithm can reach high precision and recall on almost any dataset under weak assumption. To cope with the above problems, we propose a theoretically grounded, robust, parameter-free and interpretable extension to precision/recall metrics, based on the concept of \"affiliation'' between the ground truth and the prediction sets. Our metrics leverage measures of duration between ground truth and predictions, and have thus an intuitive interpretation. By further comparison against random sampling, we obtain a normalized precision/recall, quantifying how much a given set of results is better than a random baseline prediction. By construction, our approach keeps the evaluation local regarding ground truth events, enabling fine-grained visualization and interpretation of algorithmic results. We compare our proposal against various public time series anomaly detection datasets, algorithms and metrics. We further derive theoretical properties of the affiliation metrics that give explicit expectations about their behavior and ensure robustness against adversary strategies.\n\nTensor decomposition aims to factorize an input tensor into a number of latent factors. Due to the low-rank nature of tensor in real applications, the latent factors can be used to perform tensor completion in numerous tasks, such as knowledge graph completion and timely recommendation. However, existing works solve the problem in Euclidean space, where the tensor is decomposed into Euclidean vectors. Recent studies show that hyperbolic space is roomier than Euclidean space. With the same dimension, a hyperbolic vector can represent richer information (e.g., hierarchical structure) than a Euclidean vector. In this paper, we propose to decompose tensor in hyperbolic space. Considering that the most popular optimization tools (e.g, SGD, Adam) have not been generalized in hyperbolic space, we design an adaptive optimization algorithm according to the distinctive property of hyperbolic manifold. To address the non-convex property of the problem, we adopt gradient ascent in our optimization algorithm to avoid getting trapped in local optimal landscapes. We conduct experiments on various tensor completion tasks and the result validates the superiority of our method over these baselines that solve the problem in Euclidean space.\n\nWe propose an extension to the transformer neural network architecture for general-purpose graph learning by adding a dedicated pathway for pairwise structural information, called edge channels. The resultant framework - which we call Edge-augmented Graph Transformer (EGT) - can directly accept, process and output structural information of arbitrary form, which is important for effective learning on graph-structured data. Our model exclusively uses global self-attention as an aggregation mechanism rather than static localized convolutional aggregation. This allows for unconstrained long-range dynamic interactions between nodes. Moreover, the edge channels allow the structural information to evolve from layer to layer, and prediction tasks on edges/links can be performed directly from the output embeddings of these channels. We verify the performance of EGT in a wide range of graph-learning experiments on benchmark datasets, in which it outperforms Convolutional/Message-Passing Graph Neural Networks. EGT sets a new state-of-the-art for the quantum-chemical regression task on the OGB-LSC PCQM4Mv2 dataset containing 3.8 million molecular graphs. Our findings indicate that global self-attention based aggregation can serve as a flexible, adaptive and effective replacement of graph convolution for general-purpose graph learning. Therefore, convolutional local neighborhood aggregation is not an essential inductive bias.\n\nDecision tree ensembles are widely used and competitive learning models. Despite their success, popular toolkits for learning tree ensembles have limited modeling capabilities. For instance, these toolkits support a limited number of loss functions and are restricted to single task learning. We propose a flexible framework for learning tree ensembles, which goes beyond existing toolkits to support arbitrary loss functions, missing responses, and multi-task learning. Our framework builds on differentiable (a.k.a. soft) tree ensembles, which can be trained using first-order methods. However, unlike classical trees, differentiable trees are difficult to scale. We therefore propose a novel tensor-based formulation of differentiable trees that allows for efficient vectorization on GPUs. We introduce FASTEL: a new toolkit (based on Tensorflow 2) for learning differentiable tree ensembles. We perform experiments on a collection of 28 real open-source and proprietary datasets, which demonstrate that our framework can lead to 100x more compact and 23% more expressive tree ensembles than those obtained by popular toolkits.\n\nTwo-view knowledge graphs (KGs) jointly represent two components: an ontology view for abstract and commonsense concepts, and an instance view for specific entities that are instantiated from ontological concepts. As such, these KGs contain heterogeneous structures that are hierarchical, from the ontology-view, and cyclical, from the instance-view. Despite these various structures in KGs, recent works on embedding KGs assume that the entire KG belongs to only one of the two views but not both simultaneously. For works that seek to put both views of the KG together, the instance and ontology views are assumed to belong to the same geometric space, such as all nodes embedded in the same Euclidean space or non-Euclidean product space, an assumption no longer reasonable for two-view KGs where different portions of the graph exhibit different structures. To address this issue, we define and construct a dual-geometric space embedding model (DGS) that models two-view KGs using a complex non-Euclidean geometric space, by embedding different portions of the KG in different geometric spaces. DGS utilizes the spherical space, hyperbolic space, and their intersecting space in a unified framework for learning embeddings. Furthermore, for the spherical space, we propose novel closed spherical space operators that directly decompose to using properties of the spherical space without the need for mapping to an approximate tangent space. Experiments on public datasets show that DGS significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art baseline models on KG completion tasks, demonstrating its ability to better model heterogeneous structures in KGs.\n\nCash-out fraud refers to the withdrawal of cash from a credit card by illegitimate payments with merchants. Conventional data-driven approaches for cash-out detection commonly construct a classifier with domain specific feature engineering. To further spot cash-out behaviors in complex scenarios, recent efforts adopt graph models to exploit the interaction relations rich in financial transactions. However, most existing graph-based methods are proposed for online payment activities in internet financial institutions. Moreover, these methods commonly rely on a large amount of online user data, which are not well suitable for the traditional credit card services in commercial banks. In this paper, we focus on discerning fraudulent cash-out users by taking advantage of only the personal credit card data from banks. To alleviate the scarcity of available labeled data, we formulate the cash-out detection problem as identifying dense blocks. First, we define a bipartite multigraph to hold transactions between users and merchants, where cash-out activities generate cyclically intensive and high-volume flows. Second, we give a formal definition of cash-out behaviors from four perspectives: time, capital, cyclicity, and topotaxy. Then, we develop ANTICO, with a class of metrics to capture suspicious signals of the activities and a greedy algorithm to spot suspicious blocks by optimizing the proposed metric. Theoretical analysis shows a provable upper bound of ANTICO on the effectiveness of detecting cash-out users. Experimental results show that ANTICO outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accurately detecting cash-out users on both synthetic and real-world banking data.\n\nNetwork representation learning has played a critical role in studying networks. One way to study a graph is to focus on its spectrum, i.e., the eigenvalue distribution of its associated matrices. Recent advancements in spectral graph theory show that spectral moments of a network can be used to capture the network structure and various graph properties. However, sometimes networks with different structures or sizes can have the same or similar spectral moments, not to mention the existence of the cospectral graphs. To address such problems, we propose a 3D network representation that relies on the spectral information of subgraphs: the Spectral Path, a path connecting the spectral moments of the network and those of its subgraphs of different sizes. We show that the spectral path is interpretable and can capture relationship between a network and its subgraphs, for which we present a theoretical foundation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the spectral path in applications such as network visualization and network identification.\n\nRecent years have witnessed remarkable success achieved by graph neural networks (GNNs) in many real-world applications such as recommendation and drug discovery. Despite the success, oversmoothing has been identified as one of the key issues which limit the performance of deep GNNs. It indicates that the learned node representations are highly indistinguishable due to the stacked aggregators. In this paper, we propose a new perspective to look at the performance degradation of deep GNNs, i.e., feature overcorrelation. Through empirical and theoretical study on this matter, we demonstrate the existence of feature overcorrelation in deeper GNNs and reveal potential reasons leading to this issue. To reduce the feature correlation, we propose a general framework DeCorr which can encourage GNNs to encode less redundant information. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that DeCorr can help enable deeper GNNs and is complementary to existing techniques tackling the oversmoothing issue.\n\nAs training deep learning models on large dataset takes a lot of time and resources, it is desired to construct a small synthetic dataset with which we can train deep learning models sufficiently. There are recent works that have explored solutions on condensing image datasets through complex bi-level optimization. For instance, dataset condensation (DC) matches network gradients w.r.t. large-real data and small-synthetic data, where the network weights are optimized for multiple steps at each outer iteration. However, existing approaches have their inherent limitations: (1) they are not directly applicable to graphs where the data is discrete; and (2) the condensation process is computationally expensive due to the involved nested optimization. To bridge the gap, we investigate efficient dataset condensation tailored for graph datasets where we model the discrete graph structure as a probabilistic model. We further propose a one-step gradient matching scheme, which performs gradient matching for only one single step without training the network weights. Our theoretical analysis shows this strategy can generate synthetic graphs that lead to lower classification loss on real graphs. Extensive experiments on various graph datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method. In particular, we are able to reduce the dataset size by 90% while approximating up to 98% of the original performance and our method is significantly faster than multi-step gradient matching (e.g. $15$Ã in CIFAR10 for synthesizing 500 graphs).\n\nDeep learning models have been demonstrated powerful in modeling complex spatio-temporal data for traffic prediction. In practice, effective deep traffic prediction models rely on large-scale traffic data, which is not always available in real-world scenarios. To alleviate the data scarcity issue, a promising way is to use cross-city transfer learning methods to fine-tune well-trained models from source cities with abundant data. However, existing approaches overlook the divergence between source and target cities, and thus, the trained model from source cities may contain noise or even harmful source knowledge. To address the problem, we propose CrossTReS, a selective transfer learning framework for traffic prediction that adaptively re-weights source regions to assist target fine-tuning. As a general framework for fine-tuning-based cross-city transfer learning, CrossTReS consists of a feature network, a weighting network, and a prediction model. We train the feature network with node- and edge-level domain adaptation techniques to learn generalizable spatial features for both source and target cities. We further train the weighting network via source-target joint meta-learning such that source regions helpful to target fine-tuning are assigned high weights. Finally, the prediction model is selectively trained on the source city with the learned weights to initialize target fine-tuning. We evaluate CrossTReS using real-world taxi and bike data, where under the same settings, CrossTReS outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by up to 8%. Moreover, the learned region weights offer interpretable visualization.\n\nGraph Convolutional Network (GCN) has exhibited strong empirical performance in many real-world applications. The vast majority of existing works on GCN primarily focus on the accuracy while ignoring how confident or uncertain a GCN is with respect to its predictions. Despite being a cornerstone of trustworthy graph mining, uncertainty quantification on GCN has not been well studied and the scarce existing efforts either fail to provide deterministic quantification or have to change the training procedure of GCN by introducing additional parameters or architectures. In this paper, we propose the first frequentist-based approach named JuryGCN in quantifying the uncertainty of GCN, where the key idea is to quantify the uncertainty of a node as the width of confidence interval by a jackknife estimator. Moreover, we leverage the influence functions to estimate the change in GCN parameters without re-training to scale up the computation. The proposed JuryGCN is capable of quantifying uncertainty deterministically without modifying the GCN architecture or introducing additional parameters. We perform extensive experimental evaluation on real-world datasets in the tasks of both active learning and semi-supervised node classification, which demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method.\n\nWe present Hyp"
