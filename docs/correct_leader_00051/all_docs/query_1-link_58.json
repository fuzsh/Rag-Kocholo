Groote Schuur.\n\nHouse and furniture.I give my property following that is to say my residence known as “De Groote Schuur\"[6]) ​\n\nApproach to Groote Schuur.\n\n​situate near Mowbray in the Cape Division in the said Colony together with all furniture plate and other articles contained therein at the time of my death and all other land belonging to me situated under Table Mountain including my property known as “Mosterts”Mosterts. to my Trustees hereinbefore named upon and subject to the conditions following (that is to say):—\n\nConditions.(i.)

Bequests to Oriel College, Oxford.\n\nI give the sum of £100,000 free of all duty whatsoever to my old college Oriel College in the University of Oxford ([8]) and I direct that the ​receipt of the Bursar or other proper officer of the College shall be a complete discharge for that legacy and inasmuch as I gather that the erection of an extension to High Street of the College For College buildings. buildings would cost about £22,500 and that the loss to the College revenue caused by pulling down of houses to make room for the said new College buildings would be about £250 per annum I direct that the sum of £40,000 part of the said sum of £100,000 shall be applied in the first place in the erection of the said new College buildings ([9]) and that the remainder of such sum of £40,000 shall be held as a fund by the income whereof the aforesaid loss to the College revenue shall so far as possible be made good.\n\nResident Fellows.And inasmuch as I gather that there is a deficiency in the College revenue of some £1,500 per annum whereby the Fellowships are impoverished and the status of the College is lowered I ​direct that the sum of £40,000 further part of the said sum of £1000,000 shall be held as a fund by the income whereof the income of such of the resident Fellows of the College as work for the honour and dignity of the College shall be increased ([10]).\n\nThe High Table.And I further direct that the sum of £10,000 further part of the said sum of £100,000 shall be held as a fund by the income whereof the dignity and comfort of the High Table may be maintained by which means the dignity and comfort of the resident Fellows may be increased.\n\nRepair Fund.And I further direct that the sum of £10,000 the remainder of the said sum of £100,000 shall be held as a repair fund the income whereof shall be expended in maintaining and repairing the College buildings.\n\nCounsel to the childlike Dons.And finally as the College authorities live secluded from the world and so are like children ([11]) as to commercial matters I would advise them to ​consult my Trustees as to the investment of these various funds for they would receive great help and assistance from the advice of my Trustees in such matters and I direct that any investment made pursuant to such advice shall whatsoever it may be be an authorized investment for the money applied in making it.\n\n(5.) The Scholarships at Oxford.\n\nObjects of University Education.\n\nWhereas I consider that the education of young Colonists at one of the Universities in the United Kingdom is of great advantage to them for giving breadth to their views for their instruction in life and manners ([12]) and for instilling into their minds the advantage to the Colonies as well as to the United Kingdom of the retention of the unity of the Empire.\n\n​Advantages of Residence.And whereas in the case of young Colonists studying at a University in the United Kingdom I attach very great importance to the University having a residential system such as is in force at the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge for without it those students are at the most critical period of their lives left without any supervision.\n\nEdinburgh Medical School.And whereas there are at the present time 50 or more students from South Africa studying at the University of Edinburgh many of whom are attracted there by its excellent medical school and I should like to establish some of the Scholarships hereinafter mentioned in that University but owing to its not having such a residential system as aforesaid I feel obliged to refrain from doing so. And whereas my own University the University of Oxford has such a system and I suggest that it should try and extend its scope so as if possible to make its medical school at least as good as that at the University of Edinburgh ([13]).\n\nThe Union of the English-speaking Peoples.And whereas I also desire to encourage and foster an appreciation of the advantages which I ​\n\nMarble Bath-room, Groote Schuur.\n\nMr. Rhodes's Bedroom.\n\nThe bed was made by local craftsmen from a South African wood of great hardness.\n\n​ Copyright reserved.]\n\nFrom Mr. Tennyson-Cole’s Portrait of Mr. Rhodes.\n\n(Purchased by Oriel College, Oxford.)\n\n​implicitly believe will result from the union of the English-speaking peoples throughout the world and to encourage in the students from the United States of North America who will benefit from the American Scholarships to be established for the reason above given at the University of Oxford under this my Will an attachment to the country from which they have sprung but without ​\n\nThe Shangani Monument.\n\nThese are small reproductions of two of four bas-reliefs which are being made by Mr. John Tweed, the sculptor, for the monument to the men who fell in the first Matabele War at Shangani. (See page 4.)\n\n​I hope withdrawing them or their sympathies from the land of their adoption or birth.\n\nThree-year £300 Scholarships.Now therefore I direct my Trustees as soon as may be after my death and either simultaneously or gradually as they shall find convenient and if gradually then in such order as they shall think fit to establish for male students the Scholarships hereinafter directed to be established each of which shall be of the yearly value of £300 and be tenable at any College in the University of Oxford for three consecutive academical years ([14]). ​I direct my Trustees to establish certain Scholarships and these Scholarships I some- ​times hereinafter refer to as “the Colonial Scholarships.”[15]\n\nPhotograph by][Taunt, Oxford\n\nOriel College, Oxford.\n\n​The Colonial Scholarships.\n\nThe appropriation of the Colonial Scholarships and the numbers to be annually filled up shall be in accordance with the following table:—\n\nTotal No. Appropriated.

appropriation in the next following clause hereof directed and those Scholarships I some​times hereinafter refer to as “the American Scholarships.”\n\nI appropriate two of the American Scholarships to each of the present States and Territories of the United States of North America.[17] Pro​vided that if any of the said Territories shall in my lifetime be admitted as a State the Scholarships appropriated to such Territory shall be appropriated to such State and that my Trustees may in their uncontrolled discretion withhold for such time as they shall think fit the appropriation of Scholarships to any Territory.\n\nI direct that of the two Scholarships appropriated to a State or Territory not more than one shall be filled up in any year so that at no time shall more than two Scholarships be held for the same State or Territory.[18]\n\nGerman Scholarships.By Codicil executed in South Africa Mr. Rhodes after stating that the German Emperor had made instruction in English compulsory in German schools establishes fifteen Scholarships at Oxford (five in each of the first three years after his death) of £250 each tenable for three years for students of German birth to be nominated by the German Emperor for “a good understanding between England Germany and the United States of America will secure the ​peace of the world and educational relations form the strongest tie.”[19]\n\nThe selection of the scholars.My desire being that the students who shall be elected to the Scholarships shall not be merely bookworms I direct that in the election of a student to a Scholarship regard shall be had to\n\nThe four qualifications.(i.) his literary and scholastic attainments\n\n(ii.) his fondness of and success in manly outdoor sports such as cricket football and the like\n\n(iii.) his qualities of manhood truth courage devotion to duty sympathy for the protection of the weak kindliness unselfishness and fellowship\n\nand\n\n(iv.) his exhibition during school days of moral force of character and of instincts to lead and to take an interest in his schoolmates for those latter attributes will be likely in after-life to guide him to esteem the performance of public duty as his highest aim.\n\n​\n\nThe Summer House at Groote Schuur (with the Devil’s Peak in the Background).\n\nThis old restored Dutch belvidere is a favourite holiday resort of the poorer classes of Cape Town. Family parties picnic there.\n\n​Apportionment of marks As mere suggestions for the guidance of those will have the choice of students for the Scholarships I record that (i.) my ideal qualified student would combine these four qualifications in the proportions of three-tenths for the first two-tenths for the second three-tenths for the third and two-tenths for the fourth qualification so that according to my ideas if the maximum number of marks for any Scholarship were 200 they would be apportioned as follows—60 to each of the first and third qualifications and 40 to each of the second and fourth qualifications (ii.) the marks for the several qualifications would be awarded independently as follows (that is to say) the marks for the first qualification by examination for the second and third qualifications respectively by ballot by the fellow-students of the candidates and for the fourth qualification by the head master of the candidate’s school and (iii.) the results of the awards (that is to say the marks obtained by each candidate for each qualification) would be sent as soon as possible for consideration to the Trustees or to some person or persons appointed to receive the same and the person or persons so appointed would ascertain by averaging the marks in blocks of 20 marks each of all candidates the best ideal qualified students.[20]\n\n​No Racial or Religious Tests.No Student shall be qualified or disqualified for election to a Scholarship on account of his race or religious opinions.\n\nMethod of ElectionExcept in the cases of the four schools hereinbefore mentioned the election to Scholarships shall be by the Trustees after such (if any) consultation as they shall think fit with the Minister ​having the control of education in such Colony, Province, State or Territory.\n\nTime of commencing Residence.A qualified student who has been elected as aforesaid shall within six calendar months after his election or as soon thereafter as he can be admitted into residence or within such extended time as my Trustees shall allow commence ​ Photograph by][E.

Stead in his office overlooking the Thames.\n\n​residence as an undergraduate at some college in the University of Oxford.\n\nThe scholarships shall be payable to him from the time when he shall commence such residence.\n\nScholars to be distributed among Colleges.I desire that the Scholars holding the scholarships shall be distributed amongst the Colleges of the University of Oxford and not resort in undue numbers to one or more Colleges only.\n\n​Discipline.Notwithstanding anything hereinbefore contained my Trustees may in their uncontrolled discretion suspend for such time as they shall think fit or remove any Scholar from his Scholarship.\n\nThe Annual Dinner.In order that the Scholars past and present may have opportunities of meeting and discussing their experiences and prospects I desire that my Trustees shall annually give a dinner to the past and present Scholars able and willing to attend at ​which I hope my Trustees or some of them will be able to be present and to which they will I hope from time to time invite as guests persons who have shown sympathy with the views expressed by me in this my Will.\n\n(6.) The Dalham Hall Estate.\n\nThe Dalham Hall Estate[21] is by Codicil dated January 18th 1902 strictly settled on Colonel Francis Rhodes and his heirs male with remainder to Captain Ernest Frederick Rhodes and his heirs male.\n\nThe Codicil contains the following clause:—\n\n“The essence of a proper life.”Whereas I feel that it is the essence of a proper life that every man should during some substantial period thereof have some definite occupation and I object to an expectant heir developing into what I call a “loafer.”\n\nOn encumbered Estates.And whereas the rental of the Dalham Hall Estate is not more than sufficient for the maintenance of the estate and my experience is that one of the things making for the strength of England is the ownership of country estates which could maintain the dignity and comfort of the head of the family but that this position has been absolutely ruined by the practice of creating charges upon the estates either for younger children or for the payment of debts whereby the estates become insufficient to maintain the head of the family in dignity and comfort.\n\nCountry landlords the strength of England.And whereas I humbly believe that one of the secrets of England’s strength has been the existence of a class termed “the country land​lords” who devote their efforts to the maintenance of those on their own property.[22] And whereas this is my own experience. Now therefore I direct that if any person who under the limitations hereinbefore contained shall become entitled as Conditions of tenure.tenant for life or as tenant in tail male by purchase to the possession or to the receipt of the rents and profits of the Dalham Hall Estate shall attempt to assign charge or incumber his interest in the Dalham Hall Estate or any part thereof or shall do or permit any act or thing or any No encumbrance.event shall happen by or in consequence of which he would cease to be entitled to such interest if ​the same were given to him absolutely or if any such person as aforesaid (excepting in this case my said brothers Francis Rhodes and Ernest Frederick Rhodes) (i) shall not when he shall become so entitled as aforesaid have been for at Ten years’ work.least ten consecutive years engaged in some profession or business or (ii.) if not then engaged in some profession or business and (such profession or business not being that of the Army) not Serve in Militia or Volunteers.then also a member of some militia or volunteer corps shall not within one year after becoming so entitled as aforesaid or (being an infant) within one year after attaining the age of twenty-one years whichever shall last happen unless in any case prevented by death become engaged in some profession or business and (such profession or business not being that of the Army) also become a member of some militia or volunteer corps or (iii.) shall discontinue to be engaged in any profession or business before he shall have been engaged for ten consecutive years in some profession or business then and in every such case and forthwith if such person shall be tenant for life then his estate for life shall absolutely determine and if tenant in tail male then his estate in Forfeiture of title.tail male shall absolutely determine and the Dalham Hall Estate shall but subject to estates if any prior to the estate of such person immediately go to the person next in remainder under the limitations hereinbefore contained in the same manner as if in the case of a person whose estate for life is so made to determine that person were dead or in the case of a person whose estate in tail male is so made to determine were dead and there were a general failure of issue of that person inheritable to the estate which is so made to determine.\n\n​ Photograph by H. J. Jarman][Bury St. Edmunds\n\nMr. Rhodes’s Burial Place: The Summit of “World’s View.”\n\n​Provided that the determination of an estate for life shall not prejudice or effect any contingent remainders expectant thereon and that after such determination the Dalham Hall Estate shall but subject to estates if any prior as aforesaid remain to the use of the Trustees appointed by my said Will and the Codicil thereto dated the 11th day of October 1902 during the residue of the life of the person whose estate for life so determines upon trust during the residue of the life of that person to pay the rents and profits of the Dalham Hall Estate to or present the same to be received by the person or persons for the time being entitled under the limitations hereinbefore contained to the first vested estate in remainder expectant on the death of that person.\n\nAfter various private dispositions Mr. Rhodes in his original will left the residue of his real and personal estate to the Earl of Rosebery, Earl Grey, Alfred Beit, William Thomas Stead, Lewis Lloyd Michell and Bourchier Francis Hawksley absolutely as joint tenants.\n\nThe same persons were also appointed executors and trustees.\n\nIn a Codicil dated January, 1901, Mr. Rhodes directed that the name of W. T. Stead should be removed from the list of his executors.\n\nIn a second Codicil dated October, 1901, Mr. Rhodes added the name of Lord Milner to the list of joint tenants, executors and trustees.\n\nIn a third Codicil, dated March, 1902, Mr. Rhodes appointed Dr. Jameson as one of his trustees, with all the rights of other trustees. ​\n\nThe Right Hon. Cecil J. Rhodes."
