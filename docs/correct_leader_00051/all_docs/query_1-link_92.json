        "text": "In the newsroom of The Times, amid a gallery of the paper’s notable writers, past and present, there is a photograph of a woman in a Victorian black silk dress, draped in furs. Her gaze is direct and challenging. She appears formidable, intelligent, and extremely serious.\n\nHer name was Flora Shaw. She was the first Colonial Editor of The Times, appointed the first full-time woman staff correspondent on any newspaper in 1892, a female pioneer in a male-dominated profession, a successful novelist, an intrepid foreign correspondent and a crusading journalist. One of her more remarkable achievements was to name an entire country: Nigeria.\n\nHowever she was also a fervent and evangelising imperialist, a conspirator in one of worst fiascos in British imperial history,"
