        "text": "The paper offers a sociopragmatic analysis of the correspondence of the British Colonial Office pertaining to the colonisation of the Cape of Good Hope in the early nineteenth century. This setting poses fascinating questions related to the alignment of letter writers with the institution and the other actors, as well as to the ways in which social/institutional identities are constructed. In these processes, the participants’ powers and obligations that are shaped by the institutional grid play a central role. At the same time, the growing professionalisation of the civil service determines linguistic expression in the Colonial Office. The paper provides a close characterisation of its internal dynamics, the power structures and the local grid of governance, as well as the transactional networks in 1796 and in 1827-30. The analysis focuses on the relation between institutional identities and person reference. The study establishes that Colonial Office correspondence is characterised by unique patterns of self- and addressee reference, thus corroborating the precedence of local (institutional) factors over other determinants of person reference. Keywords: early nineteenth-century institutional letters, person reference, historical sociopragmatics, British Colonial Office, Cape Colony\n\nThe received view has it that petitions involve deferential language aimed at elevating the addressee and demeaning the author. Recent studies into historical (im)politeness interpret it as epistolary facework, i.e. “politic” rather than “polite” behaviour (Held 2010; Bax 2010). Drawing on evidence of the genre dynamics present in 19th century petitions, this paper proposes that for a number of petitioners the conventionalised expression of deference could not have been their main motivation. Through close study of the structural models of the petition and their distribution in two collections of letters related to British settlement at the southern tip of Africa (1819-25), the study proposes an account for changes in users’ preferences in this respect. Acknowledging the difficulty of verifying the “polite” in historical data, the discussion employs Luckmann’s theory of “communicative genres” and “projects” (1989, 1995, 2009), which allows one to reach beyond the textual evidence to the dimension of verbal interaction. The paper also focuses on the material constituents of historical genres (cf. Barton and Hall 2000), and deems their incorporation into the social pathways of the petition to be instrumental to an in-depth understanding of the textual evidence. In other words, the view of genre proposed below is designed to exceed the limits of explanatory power that result from the fragmentary nature of historical attestations of language use. Keywords: South African English; petition; literacy; communicative genre; politeness\n\nWhen addressing family members or friends, letter writers enter a common ground of some sort, where, as research has shown, the rules of everyday inter- action apply (Nurmi and Palander-Colin 2008). In different historical periods, familiar correspondence is thus very much about maintaining existing bonds and about phatic communion. The situation is likely to be very different in the case of institutional recipients, in particular if somebody addresses a given in- stitution for the first time. The data selected for the study, the 1819 applications to the British Colonial Office for the Cape of Good Hope colonisation scheme (TNA 48/41–6), include many letters written by “first timers” (i.e., the encoders1 who have not addressed the institution before). These letters may provide some insights into the specific participation framework of the first-time writers in their interaction with the institution. In the paper, I propose that contact initiation may be related to the literacy levels of letter-writers, focusing on what I refer to as “technical literacy”. Based on some parameters thereof, I distinguish between two broad groups of infor- mants, reflecting what may be described as standard and non-standard literacies, respectively. The two groups, I assume, do not operate within the same participa- tion framework and, therefore, display pragmatic and linguistic differences in constructing the initial encounters. Moreover, the analysis of these initiations offers a new perspective on the routinisation of institutional correspondence.\n\nThis contribution aims to assess the possibility of filtering reflexive, i.e. inten- tional and strategic linguistic choices from the politic and highly conventional- ised language of historical letters (see Woods 2009). As I would like to argue, an analysis of some “backstage” epistolary data could be helpful in tracing the for- mer type of behaviour. The contribution presents a case study into the respons- es of the British government agency, the Colonial Office, to the letters from Mr William Parker, a Cape of Good Hope emigration scheme candidate (1819). The small set of letters addressed to Parker are weighed against a larger volume of the internal correspondence of the Colonial Office (1819–1823). Following Held (1989), the universal tension between the parties involved in communi- cation, i.e. the clash between the needs of ego vs. alter, is used as a diagnostic of the orientation of (im)politeness norms and strategies in the analysed data. The results of this investigation are confirmed by means of a corpus tool, the UCREL semantic tagger, USAS (see Rayson 2009; Archer 2014). Its application shows that it is sensitive to those linguistic manifestations of the pragmatic space of a specific speech act property which is characteristic of the responses of the Colonial Office."
