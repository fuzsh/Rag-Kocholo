        "text": "Interested students should contact Undergraduate Research and Fellowships to request an Applying for the Rhodes booklet.\n\nTo apply to the Rhodes Scholarship, you will need to submit the following documents by the internal deadline. All of these materials, excluding the letters of recommendation, should be submitted electronically through the Northeastern application portal in time for the internal deadline. Please be sure to include the YOUR NAME and THE FELLOWSHIP YOU ARE APPLYING TO in the subject line of any e-mails.\n\nA complete application form (which will include your personal statement and activities list). The application becomes available when you register on the Rhodes site. DO NOT submit your application through the Rhodes site electronically for the internal deadline. Once your application is complete, but before it has been submitted electronically, save it as a PDF and submit it.\n\nA personal essay not exceeding 1000 words and certified as the applicant’s own work.\n\nAn academic statement of 350 words.\n\nA two-page activities list, that details your academic achievements and honors as well as any community service, research, hobbies, athletic participation (*Not Required), and employment.\n\nFive, but not more than eight, letters of recommendation. Four of these must be from individuals who are qualified to advise selection committees about the applicant’s academic ability and standing, i.e., university faculty; one will serve as your primary recommender. Contact Undergraduate Research and Fellowships for a Request for Reference form to send your recommenders. It is important that applicants DO NOT register recommenders online. Once you register your referees on the online application, you will not be able to change your recommenders nor will your referees be able to make any changes to their letters for the national deadlines.\n\nAn official Northeastern University Transcript and any transcripts from other institutions you have attended. Northeastern transcripts can be ordered through the Office of the Registrar or through the myNEU Web Portal.\n\nThe most important part of the written application is the 1000-word “personal statement”. This statement asks you to address all of the following prompts by weaving them into the narrative of your statement (the word allocation across the three is up to you):\n\n1. Tell us how you overcame a challenge in your life. Which Rhodes Scholar character qualities did you draw from? What did you learn from the experience?\n\n2. What would you like to learn from and contribute to the Rhodes community in Oxford?\n\n3. From your place in the world, how will you use your energy and talents to address humanity’s pressing challenges?”\n\nThis will be complemented with a 350-word academic statement where you’ll elaborate on your reasons for wishing to study at Oxford and in your proposed area of study. Think of this as the narration of how you came to understand a problem or challenge in one essay, followed by a course of study to prepare you to lead in addressing this problem or challenge.\n\nRhodes offers detailed guidance on the personal and academic statements on their website (see https://www.rhodeshouse.ox.ac.uk/media/46372/information-for-candidates-usa.pdf). It is critical that you refer to this guidance throughout the process of preparing your statements.\n\nCandidate applications are reviewed by a campus committee. Northeastern approved candidates then apply to a State Selection Committee in either their state of legal residency or the state in which they have attended college. The State Committee then invites for interviews such candidates as it deems fit. Candidates nominated by the state committee are invited to interview with one of eight district selection committees, each of which selects four Rhodes Scholars."
