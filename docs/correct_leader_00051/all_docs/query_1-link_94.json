        "text": "Around 150 Oxford University academics are refusing to teach at one of its colleges, after it decided not to remove a controversial statue of Cecil Rhodes.\n\nRhodes was a British mining magnate and politician in southern Africa, who believed in British imperialism and white supremacy.\n\nCampaigners have been trying to get the statue removed from an Oriel College building for years.\n\nThe college has been accused of “institutional racism” after deciding not to take the statue down for what it said was practical reasons.\n\nWho was Cecil Rhodes?\n\nRhodes believed the British to be a superior race, and is seen by some as the ultimate representation of colonialism.\n\nRhodes and his British South Africa Company founded the southern African territory of Rhodesia in the 1890s – which is now modern day Zimbabwe and Zambia.\n\nHe annexed huge amounts of land in southern Africa, and helped pave the way for apartheid – the racist segregation of white and black people in South Africa enshrined in legislation.\n\nRhodes served as prime minister of the Cape Colony from 1890 to 1896, when he expropriated land from black Africans and tripled the wealth requirement for voting, effectively barring many black people from taking part in elections.\n\nHe once said: “I contend that we are the first race in the world, and that the more of the world we inhabit the better it is for the human race.”\n\nRhodes dreamt of building a trade route from Cairo to Cape Town which would never leave British territory.\n\nHe was also a big player in the diamond trade. He founded the De Beers diamond firm and formed a monopoly over the market that lasted until the 21st century.\n\nStatue row explained\n\nLecturers are refusing to give tutorials to Oriel’s undergraduate students following the college’s decision to keep the statue.\n\nThey have also reportedly pledged to withdraw from all talks, seminars and conferences sponsored by Oriel and stop their involvement in interviewing students and recruiting fellows.\n\nAn independent inquiry to examine Rhodes’ legacy was set up in June last year after the governing body of Oriel College “expressed their wish” to remove the statue.\n\nAnnouncing its decision three weeks ago, the college decided against removal, arguing the time frame and cost were “considerable obstacles”.\n\nA statement from the Rhodes Must Fall campaigndescribed the decision as “an act of institutional racism”.\n\nThe lecturers behind the boycott said in a statement: “Faced with Oriel’s stubborn attachment to a statue that glorifies colonialism and the wealth it produced for the college, we feel we have no choice but to withdraw all discretionary work and goodwill collaborations.”\n\nThe lecturers have been criticised by Lord Wharton, chairman of the Office for Students, who told The Telegraph it would be “utterly unacceptable” if students were left disadvantaged.\n\nTim Loughton, a former minister for children and families, added: “This is academic blackmail by a group of academics who think their own political views should trump everyone else’s, and if they don’t get their own way then any innocent students who happen to fall within their boycott will become the victims.”"
