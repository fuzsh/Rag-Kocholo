        "text": "Cecil John Rhodes was born on the 5th of July in 1853. He came from a middleclass family in England. Ever since he was a child, he had big dreams for building the British Empire. As a young boy, Cecil studied the philosophy of Marcus Aurelius, a Roman Emperor who believed in the principles of prudence, temperance, justice, and fortitude. Rhodes graduated from High School with dreams of serving Queen Victoria and her expansive Empire. But Cecil suffered some health problems and was told that he likely only had a few months to live. He decided to hop onto a boat to South Africa to pursue life in the new British colony. Cecil was given a small grant of 2000 pounds sterling to buy land in the colony. He chose to live stoically and spend wisely. He met up with brothers in the colony and gradually became more successful in farming, mining, and study. Cecil John Rhodes was initiated into Freemasonry as soon as he returned to England… at Apollo Lodge #357, in September 1877, at the age of 24. He then returned to South Africa with a mission from the order. Rhodes was named the chairman of the DeBeers Consolidated Mining Company, established with funding from NM Rothschild & Sons Limited. Rhodes used intense secrecy and masterful strategy to create a diamond and gold monopoly run by himself and his closest friends in Freemasonry. Rhodes entered into the realm of British power, prestige, and privilege. He attended Oxford University and studied under John Ruskin, a man who inspired him further to be possessed by the Spirit of the Empire. As a result of his growing alliance enterprise business monopolies, Cecil Rhodes’ income rose to over one million pounds sterling per year, all of which he devoted completely to the mysterious imperial projects, explorations, and adventures he financed across South Africa. He sought to create one land… Rhodesia… from Cape Town to Cairo… run by the Freemasons and inspired by the legends of King Solomon that he spoke of often in Lodge. During this time in Rhodes’s life, he formed an inner secret society… the Round Table and the Society of the Elect. The purpose of his secret society was the foundation of so great a power as to hereafter render wars impossible, and promote the long-term interests of humanity and the environment. Through the operation of this secret society, whose members ranged from the Queen to Lord Milner, Rudyard Kipling, and the Rothschild circle, Rhodes became the wealthiest man in Africa. He literally owned the continent, and was considered one of the wealthiest men in the world. He bought the newspapers before he ran as a politician, and used masterful strategy to climb to the highest office in the land. In office, he advocated for new systems of communication and transportation that would unite the entire continent under British rule. He financed the telegraphs and the railways across the growing nation of Rhodesia. Cecil Rhodes was told once again that his time on earth would be limited. So he re-drafted his will and perfected his plan for a secret society to finance the Rhodes Scholars at Oxford University in order for these chosen scholars to build an empire of worlds. In his will, he wrote, “To think of these stars that you see overhead at night… these vast worlds which we cannot yet reach. I would annexe the planets if I could; I often think of that. It makes me sad to see them so clear and yet so far.” Cecil Rhodes was conferred the Office of Worshipful Master of his Lodge at the same time that he was Prime Minister of South Africa. He then worked to create the Society of the Elect that operated in strict secrecy and used a hidden cube code based upon the legends of King Solomon and his mines. British agents would refer to it as, “Cecil’s Diamond Code”. Cecil survived many wars, and often participated in British war-planning. Cecil’s code was used to finance and control both sides of conflicts using Hegelian dialectic strategies, all while promoting an expansive system of United Nations. Cecil Rhodes was reported to have died in 1909… but many Freemasons believe that he faked his death in order to pursue fulltime work as the official global head of British Freemasonry. Rhodes was a Zionist collaborator. He reportedly used secret monatomic gold formulations to regenerate his body and mind, and he lived well beyond his 90s. Cecil John Rhodes reportedly traveled to northern Europe in order to work out the plan for a global economic system and an empire of worlds. Cecil collaborated with President Truman, David Ben-Gurion, and the Rothschild banking dynasty. On May 15th, 1948, Cecil John Rhodes died in peace, just shortly after creation of the new Nation of Israel."
