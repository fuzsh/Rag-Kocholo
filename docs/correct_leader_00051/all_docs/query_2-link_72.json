        "text": "Conflict in and around the country that would become Zimbabwe centred around who had the right to form its government, who controlled the economy, and for whose benefit that economy was organised. The conflict placed a spotlight on Britain’s relationship with and responsibility for parts of the world that had been part of its empire. The issues raised by Britain’s formation, maintenance and dissolution of its empire are still live today: debated in Britain, across the Commonwealth and beyond.\n\nBritish colonisation of the area now covered by present-day Zimbabwe began in the nineteenth century. For most of the twentieth century, it was known as Southern Rhodesia, colloquially then formally named after Cecil Rhodes, the British administrator who sought to absorb large parts of African land into the empire. The land had been owned, used, farmed and managed by several different groups, but control of the area was forcibly maintained from the late nineteenth century by the British South Africa Company, and then by an increasing number of UK and European emigrants. In the 1920s, its settler and settler-descendent-led administration was recognised by the British government as leading a self-governing country – Southern Rhodesia. Black Africans were not, however, allowed by law to own land outside certain restricted areas.\n\nBritain drew on the country’s resources in both world wars, and many British pilots and aircrews were trained there from 1940. In the aftermath of the Second World War, more settlers arrived in the area – some encouraged by the British government.\n\nIn the 1950s, the country’s economy was based on its network of vast, white-owned farms. Living standards for the minority white population were good, but issues related to the democratic, economic and social rights of the indigenous population increasingly came to the fore. Growing global pressure placed the spotlight on the way in which colonies and protectorates were achieving independence. The British government maintained that full independence for parts of its empire could only be attained if the political rights of the majorities were guaranteed. This was unacceptable to the white government of Southern Rhodesia, and it declared unilateral independence in 1965, becoming Rhodesia.\n\nIndependence\n\nInternational condemnation of the move was widespread. For the next fifteen years, Rhodesia faced external sanctions and internal war, as different groups within battled for the right to establish a government and control the nation. This conflict was at different times referred to as the Rhodesian Bush War, the Zimbabwean War of Liberation or Second Chimurenga (a Shona word meaning struggle for liberation).\n\nThe conflict drew in neighbouring countries and was also framed as part of a Cold War struggle, another battlefront between communist and capitalist ideologies, with support for different groups coming from Soviet-allied and Western governments. Mercenaries – including from Britain – also joined the fighting. The war was a scarring experience for the people, with many documented cases of horrific human rights abuses.\n\nPeace\n\nPeace talks at Lancaster House, London, in 1979 led to the country becoming for a short-period a full British colony, during which time it would prepare for the country’s first elections to feature large-scale majority participation. Commonwealth troops were deployed as part of a monitoring force. As part of the peace settlement, Britain agreed to financially support a plan to compensate white farmers so that land could be passed to the majority. It established a training force that would help the Zimbabwean security forces rebuild. The election victory of Robert Mugabe – a leader of one of the groups that had fought for liberation – and the establishment of Zimbabwe as an independent nation did not, however, mean that questions over land ownership in the new country receded.\n\nHow could living standards be improved for the majority if land and farms were owned by a minority? Should land ownership pass to the majority, via sale or transfer? What should be the price, and who should pay? How could the new government maintain its economy while massively reorganising the land that was the foundation of much of that economy? What role should the people of both Britain and Zimbabwe expect the UK to play in future of this newly independent nation?\n\nRobert Mugabe ruled Zimbabwe with an increasing emphasis on suppressing opposition – often with violence. His rule was often framed as a popular response to, and defence against, British colonialism. The ownership of land continued to be a central issue, and in the late 1990s the British government argued that it no longer had a ‘special responsibility’ to help finance transfers from white-owned farms to majority ownership. In the early 2000s land was forcibly transferred from white farmers to the majority black population, a move condemned by many in the international community. All of this took place against a backdrop of deteriorating relationships between Zimbabwe and international organisations such as the International Monetary Fund. The pain experienced by the people of Zimbabwe as their country’s economy tumbled, poverty soared, food insecurity and social problems worsened was acute, with some blaming the legacies of colonialism, others Mugabe’s policies – or the complex interplay between both.\n\nMugabe was a polarising figure – seen by some as a heroic opposer of colonial rule who steered his country to independence in the face of implacable imperialist opposition, and by others as an authoritarian dictator who led a human rights-abusing administration that plunged Zimbabwe into economic and social turmoil. His leadership faced many challenges from both internal opposition and international pressure, and he was removed from office in 2018.\n\nThe factors that produced war, conflict, poverty and pain as Zimbabwe moved towards and developed its independence are heavily debated. The consequences of violence are still being felt."
