Rhodes “dreamed of improving the world” by bringing together scholars from around the globe at Oxford to study. Improved by their education and exposure to one another, these scholars would return to their communities, ready to fight the good fight.\n\nRhodes Scholarships are available for citizens of many countries around the world, including the United States. Students who are eligible to apply through their country of citizenship or permanent residence should do so. The Rhodes Global Scholarship is only for students who are not eligible to apply through any other jurisdiction.\n\nThe Selection Committee for the Rhodes Global Scholarship is looking for outstanding young leaders who are motivated to engage with global challenges and to promote international understanding and peace. In short, the Selection Committee seeks young people of outstanding intellect, character, leadership, and commitment to service, and who demonstrate a strong propensity to emerge as \"leaders for the world’s future.\"\n\nYou MUST receive prior nomination by Northeastern in order to apply for this scholarship.
