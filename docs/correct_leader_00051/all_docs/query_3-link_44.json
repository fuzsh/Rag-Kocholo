        "text": "In the late 1890s and early 1900s George McCall Theal published 35 volumes of \"Records of the Cape Colony\", covering Colonial Office correspondence from 1793 to 1827 held at what was then the Public Record Office (now the National Archives) in London. These volumes can be freely downloaded (or browsed through on line) via the Internet Archive. Volumes 12 and 13 cover the 1820 settlers, and reproduce a lot of the correspondence I have transcribed on this site, although Theal's work is much more selective and does not include non party leaders or those who did not emigrate. It does, however, include some answers written by the Colonial Office to letters found elsewhere on this site. There is an index in every fifth volume and Volume 35 contains a complete index. Volume 36 is a Register of Contents of Volumes 1-35\n\nVolume 01 1793-1796 Volume 19 Oct 1824-Feb 1825 Volume 02 1796-1799 Volume 20 Feb-Apr 1825 + index Volume 03 1799-1801 Volume 21 Apr-Jun 1825 Volume 04 1801-1803 Volume 22 Jun-Aug 1825 Volume 05 1803-1806 + index Volume 23 Aug-Nov 1825 Volume 06 1806-1809 Volume 24 Nov-Dec 1825 Volume 07 1809-1811 Volume 25 Jan-Feb 1826 + index Volume 08 1811-1812 Volume 26 Feb-Jun 1826 Volume 09 1812-1814 Volume 27 Jun-Sep 1826 Volume 10 1814-1815 + index Volume 28 Sep-Dec 1826 Volume 11 1815-1818 Volume 29 Dec 1826 Volume 12 1819-1820 Volume 30 Jan-Feb 1827 + index Volume 13 1820-1821 Volume 31 Feb-Jun 1827 Volume 14 1821-1822 Volume 32 Jun-Aug 1827 Volume 15 1822-1823 + index Volume 33 Aug-Oct 1827 Volume 16 1823-1824 Volume 34 Oct-Dec 1827 Volume 17 Jan-Jun 1824 Volume 35 Supplement and Index Volume 18 Jun-Oct 1824 Volume 36 Register of Contents Vols 1-35"
