Cecil Rhodes (5 July 1853 â€“ 26 March 1902) was Prime Minister of the Cape Colony from 17 July 1890 to 12 January 1896, succeeding and preceding John Gordon Sprigg. As the leader of the British South Africa Company, he colonized much of southern Africa for the United Kingdom, and the colony of Rhodesia (now Zambia and Zimbabwe) was named for him.
