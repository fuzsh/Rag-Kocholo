        "text": "Little Things that make me go Hmmmm...\n\n10/27/97> I just loved this week. RJ was trying to dance around why he didn't tell Jacara about signing Charlie Patterson. And whoosh -- he comes clean; he tells her why. Watching RJ squirm, something I don't think I have seen before was fun. RJ is always \"IN CHARGE\". I loved it! Unfortunately, the one time he is honest it comes back at him in one fell swoop. Jacara wants out -- why? Because he didn't consult her -- and worst of all she is considering going into business with a man that is even sneakier and more back handed than RJ. At least with RJ he is pretty up front with the choices he made regarding that road he decided to go down; but Max he still hasn't really showed any remorse for torching Maggie's warehouse. Jacara knew what she was getting into when she signed up with RJ -- isn't this the woman who is attracted to \"Wise Guys\"; she likes \"Bad Boys\" like RJ. Knowing all this about RJ, and being the strong woman that she is you can't tell me she wasn't prepared for something like what Tommy Gregory wanted or for maybe RJ going off and doing something like signing Charlie Patterson. Isn't she the one that knows the pitfalls that come with the music business? I don't know -- maybe it is me. She saw Gabe come in there to talk to RJ; she saw them whispering -- she didn't insist on wanting to know what Gabe had to say to RJ. And another thing -- wasn't it Gabe that brought RJ and Jacara together? Why wasn't Jacara upset with Gabe for not coming to her? Hmmmm...just wondering. I am sure this is all a set up for a feud I see coming up between RJ and Max; and my money is on RJ.\n\nI love what is happening between RJ and Rachel. I have never been a fan of this Rachel's but I like how she stands behind her Uncle RJ. Isn't it about time Nora let this young woman be an adult; trust her to make choices that will be good for her? I like how she is standing up to her mother and fighting for her independence.\n\n10/22/97 Does RJ ever go home?\n\nGee, did Hank back down when RJ told him he didn't want \"big brother\" hanging around the club? Hank loves jazz, Club Indigo is a club opened to the public...where was he? I think it would have been fun watching RJ trying to juggle this Tommy character with not only Jacara around, but Hank too.\n\nHmmm...10/16/97 RJ just told Jacara the night before that one of the reasons he gave up the bad boy life was because of \"her\"; But he lies to her when she asks should she be worrid after Gabe leaves -- doesn't tell her what the \"Big Boys\" want. Now the man is willing to turn his life around for her; and he likes earning \"clean\" money... just not enough to trust her yet.\n\nJust how can Jacara say \"no\" to not just one of the Gannon Brothers, but to both? She isn't going to get involved with either one of them. What? Is she nuts?!!!!\n\nFrankly, I am quite confused about this whole affair, or lack of. From day one she makes no bones about letting Hank and anyone else that will listen, that she is after that man. She goes out to dinner with RJ and from sometime between the end of her song and the next morning she has sworn off both Gannon men. There is no continuity to this storyline and I feel it deserves better attention than it is getting right now.\n\n-- Just wondering where RJ's apartment is. Wouldn't it have been nice to see RJ taking Jacara back to his apartment to show her the artwork that he told her about at dinner? I know I would like to see both, the apartment again and his artwork.\n\nOr wouldn't it have been interesting to have RJ and Jacara run into Hank and Carlotta while at the Palace? After all didn't Cassie run into Kevin and Tea almost everytime the two were together; or how about Blair and Patrick always running into Marty; then there was Dorian watching Kelly and Joey?\n\n10/14/97...\n\n-- RJ and Jacara on a date...hmmm, and their first date unless something has happened off screen we don't know about. I listened to the conversation, still not sure how I feel about the two of these people getting together. The conversation just didn't make sense to me.\n\nExcuse me but when did this all this happen? While he was lurking in the shadows of his club watching Jacara go after Hank?\n\nPreview for week of 10/13 -- looks like I have something to look forward to...Hurray! Hurray! I was just viewing SOD on AOL and this is what I read: R.J.'s past catches up with him... Hmmm, I can hardly wait.\n\nMy problem with this:\n\nWhy is it that RJ can't be interested in a woman unless it is a woman that is interested in his brother? If my memory serves me correctly, way before the Gannons came to town RJ chased after and caught Hank's wife at the time, Nora; then when he came to town he also went after his then fiance, now ex-wife Sheila. He apparently isn't interested in Carlotta because he doesn't believe that Hank is either. RJ, however, believes that Hank is interested in Jacara and he knows Jacara is interested in Hank, so now he wants Jacara?\n\nOk, now to the point: My problem with this storyline is that I believe that RJ is capable of attracting women on his own and can get his own woman, and doesn't need to be chasing after women who are interested in his big brother. I think the story would be much more interesting if a woman that Hank is interested in isn't interested in him but IS interested in little brother RJ.\n\nRJ Gannon\n\n10/23/97 -10/31/97\n\nJacara wants out of her partnership with RJ because RJ signed Charlie Patterson without discussing it with her first. RJ tells her that he did it to say Blue J Records and about how Tommy wanted 60% of their profits. RJ wasn't about to share his profits with him or anyone else. Jacara gets upset because they are partners and he didn't consult her. RJ thinks that she is upset about more than just him signing Charlie. Jacara ends up at Rodi's stewing in her drink and Max approaches her. He wants to go into partnership with her; he wants her to do for Rodi's what she has done for Club Indigo. Jacara can't do anything until she gets out of her partnership with RJ; she and Max pay Nora a visit. Jacara wanting out of her partnership with Max tweaks Nora's concern about Rachel's safety. Although she does ask if going into partnership Max would be wise. Meanwhile, Max is furious and Gabe and Rachel try to calm him down. They convince him that he can get Jacara back; all he has to do is be cool. RJ goes over to Rodi's to talk to Jacara, and who is there, none other than Big Brother Hank. Jacara and RJ get into a heated discussion about why Jacara really wants to get out. RJ tells her she's scared and of course she denies it. She isn't scared she just wants out; Blue J is her baby and she has worked hard to keep people like Tommy out of her business. RJ tells her he thinks that she is scared of him; she is afraid of what might happen between them. And for some unknown reason, I guess none other than to be a walking plot device to set RJ off, Max (of all people, not Hank) decides he needs to make sure that Jacara is alright. This sets RJ off, and he is ready to go after Max (me too) and now Hank has to step in to break them up. RJ goes off in a huff. He returns to Club Indigo where Rachel is there waiting to hear from him. He tells her no and then she lets him know that Mommy was there and that Jacara is looking to go into partnership with Max. RJ is furious.\n\n10/22/97 Unfortunately there is no accounting for the days when cable goes out so today's wrap up of the show is from abc's daily recap: Gabe returns to Llanview with Tommy Gregory, a shady investor from New York. Tommy wanted action in Club Indigo but RJ refused. Tommy handed RJ an ultimatum, but RJ wouldn't budge. Gabe stepped in, but Tommy offered RJ another solution. Tommy wants RJ to promote a singer named Charlie Patterson by giving him a recording contract. RJ agreed and sent Tommy on his way. Gabe suggested that RJ should have discussed this with Jacara...Jacara entered and questioned what they were discussing.\n\n10/21/97 RJ, Jacara and Wendi are standing around the bar at of course, Club Indigo. RJ and Jacara are discussing the talent and RJ doesn't feel the current enterntainers are up to Club Indigo standards. He tries to cajole Jacara into singing again but she states firmly that her singing days are over. Max notices Jacara and asks to speak to her. RJ stands in the background during the whole discussion watching; he is not please at that Jacara is talking with Max and eventually interrupts their conversation with the ruse they need to discuss their future bookings for the club.\n\n10/16/97 A start of a new day in Llanview; a wonderful review of Jacara's debut at Club Indigo is found in I guess the \"Banner\". Prior to that RJ is complimenting Jacara on her performance. Oohs and ahs, and all-round agreement with the review. Bad news follows -- Gabe walks in to talk to RJ; tells him that the \"Big Boys\" have been watching Blue Jay, and they want a cut of Blue Jay Records' success. While RJ is hearing this wonderful news Jacara informs Rachel that her and RJs dinner was not a date. She is not getting involved with either one of the Brothers Gannon. Rachel eappeared as confused as I did -- then why were you going after Hank? She says \"Cuz she saw him first\". Jacara laughs and says \"It's a joke. In fact she needs to go to the diner to talk to Carlotta\" Jacara leaves for the diner to let Carlotta know that she isn't interested in Hank. RJ continues his discussion with Gabe; Gabe tells him that they want 60%. RJ fumes and says he has worked to hard to share, and he doesn't share too well, just ask his brother.\" When Jacara returns from the diner, Gabe leaves abruptly. Suspicious she asks RJ is there anything she should know about and he lies and says \"No, nothing he can't handle.\"\n\n10/15/97 Can it be...is this the beginning of the long awaited storyline for RJ? Oh, I hope so. RJ and Jacara returned back from dinner. Rather quickly, don't you think? Well, I do. We didn't even get to see them eat or hear Jacara's response to RJ's proclamation that \"SHE\" is one of the reasons for giving up his \"Bad Boy\" image. I wanted to hear what she had to say. Instead we get to see Clint putting the make on Vicki again. What is this the third, or the fourth time Clint has to woo back Vicki?\n\nIt is a good thing that they came back so quickly; otherwise, there would have been no show at Club Indigo. Jacara sang. Marva Hicks' voice is so beautiful and strong. I am almost, but not quite, willing to forgive TPTB for not allowing us to watch RJ romance Jacara to hear Marva Hicks sing. I hope his romance isn't a part of RJ's life that happens off screen.\n\n10/14/97 RJ and Jacara go out on a date, to dinner at the Palace. RJ orders wine and and their discussion goes something like this...\n\nJacara asks RJ how much of a \"bad boy\" was he. I loved his response, \"How bad do you want me to be?\" Well I want him to be as bad as he was when he came to Llanview.\n\nJacara tells RJ she has always been attracted to \"Wise Guys\" -- Huh? Is that why she has been chasing after Hank since she came to town. Hank is as straight as you are going to get.\n\nJacara wants to know what made him go the straight and narrow. I could believe the first part of his answer -- he didn't like always having to look over his shoulder and finding \"Big Bro\" and Bo in his face. But that last part where he says... \"and you\".\n\n10/06/97 -- RJ attends Llanview's charity event on the arms of Jacara. The way I see it is that his only purpose was to be a spectator of this ridiculous \"triangle\" between Carlotta/Hank/Jacara. This man surely has better things to do than to keep tabs on big brother Hank's life from the sidelines. Should I be grateful that he was allowed to venture away from Club Indigo?\n\nGIVE THIS MAN A LIFE!\n\nAh, but later we see RJ back at his club to interrupt Hank telling Jacara that nothing can happen between him and Jacara because of RJ. RJ let's Hank know that he doesn't like \"big brother\" hanging around his club, and that he especially doesn't want Hank getting close to Jacara."
