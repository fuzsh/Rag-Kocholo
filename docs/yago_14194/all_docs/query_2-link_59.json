My undergraduate degree is in Journalism with a minor in Public Relations Branding and Imaging. I was fortunate to study and live abroad in Scotland which would later spark a love for international travel. In my free time, when I am not planning another trip overseas, I love being with family, friends, and my dog. In the summers I like to take advantage of Presque Isle State Park where I kayak in the lagoons and boat in Lake Erie. Gannon’s campus is centrally located to all the best that the city has to offer and there is truly something for everyone here. As the saying goes, “It’s Okay to Love Erie!”\"\n\nAreas of Focus\n\nRegion/Specialty\n\nCyber and Engineering Recruitment\n\nStates\n\nN/A\n\nLauren Kraynik\n\nSenior Admissions Counselor\n\nPhone: 814-871-7411\n\nText: 814-821-2641\n\nEmail: kraynik001@gannon.edu\n\n\"When I chose Gannon for my undergraduate education, one of my favorite things was the location. I love downtown Erie! It is a great size city, with so much to do! Outside of the office I love spending time with my husband and two young sons.

The first thing I noticed about Gannon is how welcoming the campus is. The moment you step onto campus you are invited to be involved in the community, especially through the many clubs or organizations that are on campus. Ask me about anything Disney or sports related and I probably know the answer. Some other hobbies that I have include collecting many different Disney and Star Wars Vinylmations. Of which I have about 50. One piece of advice I tell people about picking a college is to find the one that you can see yourself at for the next 4 years.\"\n\nAreas of Focus\n\nRegion/Specialty\n\nNorthwest New York: Cayuga, Cortland, Erie, Genesee, Livingston, Monroe, Niagara, Onondaga, Ontario, Orleans, Oswego, Schuyler, Seneca, Tompkins, Wayne, Wyoming, Yates\n\nStates\n\nNew York\n\nJulie Lapiska\n\nAssociate Director\n\nPhone: 814-871-7410\n\nText: 814-527-3375\n\nEmail: lapiska003@gannon.edu\n\n\"I'm originally from Saint Marys, PA, but have never left Erie after proudly graduating from Gannon. Most of my time away from work is spent with my husband and two young boys. My favorite hobby is definitely running. When I can, I'll run at Presque Isle State Park, my favorite place in Erie. Not surprisingly, my favorite place on campus is the Health and Wellness Center - especially in the winters! I love to listen to music and if want to know something unique about me, it's that I like to eat Doritos and peanut butter sandwiches.

I am a member of several higher education professional organizations and spend my free time watching Doctor Who, playing volleyball/golf and attempting to turn my Delorean into a time machine. My favorite things about Gannon are the friendly/helpful people who comprise the campus community and the newly renovated Nash Library. My favorite movies are The Empire Strikes Back and Ghostbusters, my favorite book is Ready Player One and my favorite quote comes from Dr. Robert Doback “Don’t lose your dinosaur”.
