        "text": "Eric Matthew Gannon, 33, passed away unexpectedly in Albuquerque, NM, on January 31, 2024.\n\nEric was born on August 15, 1990, in Albuquerque to Michael and Maureen Gannon. Though small in stature and faced with numerous health challenges, Eric quickly learned to be tough and stand strong in a household of three boys - something his brothers made sure of. He attended La Cueva High School (class of 2009) and New Mexico State University (NMSU), where he earned a Bachelor's in Marketing (class of 2013) through the PGA Professional Golf Management (PGM) Program. Eric and his brothers developed a love for golf under the guidance of their father, Michael, who passed away in 2021. From a very young age, Eric cultivated a passion for golf, dedicating his life and professional career to the sport. His career journeyed across the United States, including stops in Kona, HI, where he served as a golf pro at the Mauna Lani Resort; Los Angeles, CA, where he instructed at Golftec; Dallas, TX, where he directed tournaments for the All-Pro Tour, and most recently, Sioux Falls, SD, where he served as tournament director for the USGA. In addition, through his friendship with ARCA in New Mexico, Eric was inspired to share the game of golf on numerous occasions with individuals with disabilities. Throughout his life, Eric enjoyed teaching, officiating, and playing golf, but above all, he cherished sharing the game with others, particularly his father, mother and brothers. Eric was an inspiration to all, facing many challenges in his brief life that he overcame. He remained a fighter through life's ups and downs, maintaining a positive outlook each day, and living in the moment. His spirit will continue to inspire through the countless lives he touched. He will be forever celebrated. Eric was preceded in death by his father, Michael Gannon. He is survived by his mother, Maureen Gannon, his brothers, John Gannon (wife Alexya Gannon) and Robert Gannon, who is the father of Eric's beloved nephew, Henry Gannon, along with numerous aunts and uncles who treasured him, and his cherished cousins, who regarded him as a brother. Eric also leaves behind a wide circle of close friends who loved him deeply."
