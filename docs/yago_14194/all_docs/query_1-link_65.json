I am a champion Amateur Boxer who fights to make a difference for these pups. I first visited Puerto Rico in 2007 with my husband, who is a stuntman and was filming on the island. We love dogs and were horrified at what we encountered. It is hard to visit a beach without seeing its residents -- usually very cute pups who sometimes chew rocks because they are so hungry. It broke our hearts. We are Brits who now live and work in New York. I did some research and found a couple of rescue groups working in Puerto Rico and began volunteering and donating to them. We adopted our second ‘fur child’, Boom Boom, from a horrific situation in the Arecibo shelter in 2008. I have been rescuing full time in Puerto Rico since 2009 and launched The Sato Project in November 2011.\n\nOur Team on the Ground in Puerto Rico\n\nWe have a wonderful team in Puerto Rico. They care for, socialize, and pour unlimited love over our rescued pups, and regularly work through the wee hours of the night to prepare our dogs for their early flights out of San Juan. You will hear their names in our social media posts, but here is your chance to learn more about the people who are in the trenches every day doing the challenging but always rewarding work of rescuing dogs.\n\nSamuel D. Prieto Pulido,\n\nBeach Rescue Coordinator/Photography Assistant\n\nSamuel is an agronomist (Animal Scientist) who works for the Servicio de Extension Agricola of the University of Puerto Rico. He joined our team in May 2019 when he rescued and fostered three puppies who became part of our program. Little did he know, that was only the beginning. In addition to fostering, Samuel is now our Beach Rescue Coordinator, helps out during our Spayathon and Vaccination clinics, transports, and steps in as a photography assistant whenever needed. He is inspired by giving a second chance to dogs who don’t have someone to protect them and demonstrating to them that not all humans are inhumane. He loves being a part of The Sato Project because he is constantly reminded that there are more good people out there with the same goals and that together, we can save more lives.\n\nNatalia Rivera,\n\nBeach Rescue Coordinator/Photography Assistant\n\nNatalia found out about The Sato Project in 2019 when she rescued three puppies and reached out to us to help find them homes. Starting with those puppies, she became a dedicated foster family for many more satos in need. From there, her involvement with our team continued to grow because she wanted to help make a difference to her island and give every dog the life it deserves. Natalia is now a member of our rescue team and helps patrol Dead Dead Beach every day to monitor for any newly abandoned dogs. She also helps our satos find their new homes by taking beautiful pictures of them that show their true colors and personalities. Additionally, she helps during our Spayathon and Vaccination Clinics, and at transports. Her favorite part of her work with us is seeing all her fosters in their new homes. When not devoting time to our satos, she is an agronomist (Animal Scientist) for the University of Puerto Rico at Mayaguez.\n\nALEYSHKA MIRANDA, KENNEL ATTENDANT at Sanctuary by the sato project\n\nAleyshka has the very important job of Kennel Attendant, who feeds all of our dogs and enriches them in activities such as exercise and play. She also ensures that all kennels are kept clean, bathes each sato and attends to other basic grooming needs. She assists with taking photos and videos of the dogs in our care.\n\nNanya Peña, kennel attendant at Sanctuary by the sato project\n\nNanya most recently joined our team as Kennel Attendant. She has a background in dog grooming and grooms each sato so they can have their picture perfect moment! She assists with taking photos and videos of the dogs in our care.\n\nAlessandra Migliore, Administration Coordinator\n\nAlessandra was born in Puerto Rico and now lives in New Jersey. She always loved dogs, and when it came time to adopt one of her own, she discovered The Sato Project, a nonprofit that rescues satos for her home island. Alessandra adopted her first sato, CC, in 2019 and quickly fell in love with her and the organization. She began volunteering at transports in NY/NJ and processing adoption applications. She even traveled to Puerto Rico to help load for a transport. Alessandra added another sato, Yogi, from The Sato Project in 2021. She officially joined the team in 2022.\n\nHarry berberian, development director\n\nHarry is a huge animal lover and a longtime friend to The Sato Project. Before joining the team, he volunteered at several Spayathons in Puerto Rico and even helped transport rescued dogs. Harry is a CUNY Law School alum who put his degree to good use, fighting for students in NYC public schools. He's also passionate about supporting young people aging out of the foster care system and has even worked for an organization founded by Eliza Hamilton. In his downtime, you can find Harry enjoying a cup of coffee, taking his pup for walks in Fort Greene Park, and belting out tunes from the HAMILTON soundtrack. Contact Harry to explore ways to get involved with The Sato Project.\n\nEMILY THOMAS, FOSTER COORDINATOR in the Northeast\n\nEmily has always had a love for dogs and a consistent need to learn about different breeds, traits, health, and well-being. She has owned dogs her whole adult life and currently has two.\n\nThroughout the years, she’s been involved in training dogs with social issues and aggression. Her own pups are therapy certified and participated in the Canine Good Citizen with the American Kennel Club. She has also helped local pups find loving homes when they were displaced.\n\nShe adopted a sato in 1999 who lived for 15 years. She was the best pup and she knew she wanted to help more like her. This is reason she became involved with The Sato Project first as a foster and now as the Foster Coordinator."
