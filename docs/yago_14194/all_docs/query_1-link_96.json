        "text": "The donation was made in honor of K-9 Sgt. Sean Gannon, a New Bedford native who was killed in the line of duty in 2018.\n\n“My wife Denise and I and our entire family continue to be profoundly moved by Southcoast Health’s ongoing alliance to keep Sean’s legacy alive in so many positive ways,” said Patrick Gannon. “Southcoast Health’s generous donation of holstered tourniquets will save precious moments where life and death hang in the balance. Denise and I cannot imagine a more fitting tribute to our son,” said Patrick Gannon, Sean’s father and 40-year employee of Southcoast Health. In 2018, Southcoast paid tribute to K-9 Sgt. Gannon by renaming the pediatric unit at St. Luke’s Hospital the K-9 Sgt. Sean McNamee Gannon Pediatric Unit, which includes a 17-ft. long photography installation chronicling Sgt. Gannon’s life. Southcoast also invested $25,000 in proceeds from a T-shirt fundraiser to build the K-9 Sgt. Sean Gannon Memorial playground, which will be located at the Campbell Elementary School in New Bedford.\n\nThe application of a tourniquet can mean the difference between life and death. Tourniquets are used to control bleeding from extremity wounds and have been incorporated into trauma care both in the prehospital and hospital settings. This simple piece of equipment has become essential to saving lives in trauma situations, such as gun violence, that have become prevalent in our current culture.\n\nThe tourniquet donation is the latest example of how Southcoast Health is engaging in community collaborations to identify and create life-saving solutions to issues that affect patients who depend on Southcoast Health for excellence in care. The donation to the New Bedford Police Department was supported by Dr. Michael Grossman, chief of Trauma and acute care surgery at Southcoast Health, and Stephanie Raby, RN, trauma program manager at St. Luke’s Hospital.\n\n“Equipping the New Bedford Police Department with these holstered tourniquets will be a great asset for first responders in the field and for the caregivers in our emergency departments,” said Grossman. “When a tourniquet is appropriately applied in the field, it reduces blood loss and gives ED staff an advantage in achieving positive outcomes when treating patients.”\n\n“This meaningful donation has the potential to save many lives. K-9 Sgt. Gannon’s sacrifice has become such a deeply rooted part of the South Coast. The donation of tourniquets expresses yet another way that Sean’s life and his service will touch members of the community,” said Raby. “And it’s another example of how Southcoast Health’s commitment to providing world-class healthcare does not stop at the door of our hospitals.”\n\n“I’m pleased that New Bedford’s police officers will have these lifesaving tools at the ready,” said Mayor Jon Mitchell. “This donation by Southcoast Health reflects the importance of partnerships in keeping our city and law enforcement prepared for any situation. The City is grateful to Southcoast for this gesture and the spirit of collaboration it symbolizes.”\n\nThe tourniquets were delivered to the New Bedford police department on Monday, September 9 and were received with gratitude by the department.\n\n“K-9 Sgt. Gannon’s loss impacted the police community and the City of New Bedford in a profound way. This simple lifesaving tool of tourniquets addresses the risks that all police officers in the field of law enforcement as they protect and serve our community. They remind us that people care deeply,” said Chief Joseph Cordeiro of the New Bedford police department. “I am grateful to Southcoast Health and the Gannon family for this meaningful gesture.”\n\n“Every second matters in the field. Decisions must be made in split seconds, and oftentimes, injuries cannot wait for treatment” said Officer Hank Turgeon, New Bedford Police Union President. “Now our men and women in blue will have another lifesaving tool at their fingertips for themselves and injured civilians. I look forward to continuing to work with Southcoast Health and to commence training with the new trauma center staff.”"
