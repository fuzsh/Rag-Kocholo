        "text": "Rick Klein\n\nGeneral 2/6/2024 1:37:00 PM Jeff Kirik, Assistant Athletic Director for Media Relations\n\nGannon Athletics Hall of Fame enshrines nine on night to remember\n\nEight former student-athletes and one former longtime employee honored in induction ceremony at Yehl Ballrroom\n\nERIE, Pa. – It was an unforgettable day on Saturday, Feb. 3, as the Gannon Athletics Hall of Fame inducted the Class of 2024.\n\nThe list of inductees included basketball players Antoinette \"Nettie\" Blake (2015) and John B. Bowen (1989, 2004C, 2005C), wrestling great Thomas M. Boyd Sr. (1992), football lineman Randy Colling (2011), baseball pitcher Aaron J. Cox, volleyball player Hannah J. Kren (2017), softball pitcher Lauren E. (Soldner) Radwan (2008, 2010M), lacrosse player Mindy V. Richmond (2005), and Distinguished Service Award recipient Dolores \"Dee\" Smith.\n\nThe Class of 2024 was honored during a basketball doubleheader against California (Pa.) during the afternoon at the Hagerty Family Events Center. The honorees were then enshrined into the Gannon Athletics Hall of Fame on Saturday evening at the annual Hall of Fame Induction Dinner and Ceremony at the Yehl Ballroom in the Waldron Campus Center.\n\nAlso at the ceremony, Gannon women's volleyball coach Matt Darling was honored as the Gannon Coach of the Year for the 2022-23 academic/athletic year.\n\nErie resident Sean Peebles, the public address announcer for the Cleveland Cavaliers, served as the master of ceremonies, while Hall of Fame plaques were presented by Gannon University President Walter Iwanenko and Director of Athletics Lisa Goddard McGuirk.\n\nHere's a look at the inductees:\n\nAntoinette \"Nettie\" Blake, Women's Basketball (2011-15, 2015 graduate):\n\nNettie Blake was a force at post player for four years at Gannon where she became one of only three players in GU history with 1,000 points and 1,000 rebounds.\n\nBlake ranks seventh on Gannon's all-time scoring list with 1,536 points, and she ranks third with 1,029 rebounds. The 6-foot-1 forward/center was a three-time PSAC West All-Star, making the First Team as a junior and senior after landing a spot on the Second Team as a sophomore.\n\nFor her career, she averaged 12.2 points and 8.2 rebounds per game while appearing in 126 contests, including 112 starts.\n\nOne of the highlights of her Gannon career was being named the Most Outstanding Player of the 2013 NCAA Division II Atlantic Regional after helping the Golden Knights earn a trip to the Elite Eight. Just a sophomore then, she had 12 points and 16 rebounds in a 50-47 win over California (Pa.) in the title game at then-Hammermill Center. Afterward, head coach Cleve Wright said Blake \"showed so much heart. She put us on her back.\"\n\nAs a senior, Blake averaged a double-double with 13.4 points and 10.7 rebounds per game. She pulled down 311 rebounds, the fourth-highest, single-season total in school history. That included a 19-point, 23-rebound performance against Mercyhurst and a 28-point, 18-rebound effort against Edinboro.\n\nShe was selected as the Gannon Female Student-Athlete of the Year for 2014-15. Blake graduated from Gannon in 2015 with a bachelor's degree in criminal justice and went on to get her master's degree in social work at Rutgers University in 2019.\n\nFor the past five years, the Jersey City, N.J., native has worked in New York City as a Program Director overseeing a homeless shelter funded by the Department of Homeless Services while assisting families and adults in need of permanent housing.\n\nJohn Bowen, Men's Basketball (1986-88, 1989 graduate):\n\nJohn Bowen was at Gannon for only two seasons, but the 6-foot-8 forward made a profound impact in those two years.\n\nAs a junior, he was a key member of the 1986-87 team that advanced to the NCAA Division II championship game.\n\nHe led the team with an average of 8.0 rebounds per game despite coming off the bench in 25 of the 28 games. He also ranked second on the team with an average of 11.8 ppg.\n\nIn the 1987 national title game, Bowen led Gannon with 17 points and eight rebounds, but the Golden Knights lost to Kentucky Wesleyan 92-74 to finish as the Division II national runner-up. That 1986-87 squad was inducted into the Gannon Hall of Fame as a team in 2010.\n\nBowen was an even bigger force as a senior in 1987-88 when he averaged 15.0 points and 11.8 rebounds per game while helping Gannon go 24-8 and reach the NCAA Division II quarterfinals.\n\nHe finished with 688 points in two seasons, and his career average of 9.7 rebounds per game still ranks sixth on Gannon's all-time list.\n\nBowen was well traveled before reaching Gannon. He was a high school superstar at Warren High School, where he compiled 2,884 points and 2,163 rebounds. He then attended the University of Notre Dame, where he was a member of the 1983-84 Fighting Irish team that advanced to the NIT Finals. He then transferred to William & Mary before coming to Gannon.\n\nAfter Gannon, Bowen played one year with the Washington Generals, who toured as the Harlem Globetrotters' opponents.\n\nBowen already is a member of two Halls of Fame, the Metro Erie Chapter of the Pennsylvania Sports Hall of Fame (2010) and the Warren County Sports Hall of Fame (2020).\n\nHe graduated from Gannon in 1989 with a bachelor's degree in education, and in 1994, he earned his master's degree in higher ed administration at West Virginia University. He received his Principal Certificate from Edinboro University in 2004 and his Superintendent Certificate from Gannon in 2005.\n\nHe has been a teacher and basketball coach since 1994 and is currently employed by the Erie School District.\n\nThomas M. Boyd, Sr., Men's Wrestling (1987-92, 1992 graduate):\n\nBefore Tom Boyd became the Gannon men's wrestling head coach and before he served as a full-time GU assistant coach, he was one of the Golden Knights' first great wrestlers.\n\nIn fact, he was the first Gannon wrestler to be ranked No. 1 nationally. Wrestling in the early years of Don Henry's Gannon coaching career, Boyd established himself as a dominant lightweight.\n\nHe compiled a 77-22-3 record, giving him a .770 career winning percentage that ranks fourth in Gannon history. He also went 32-4-3 in dual meets for an .859 winning percentage that ranks fifth in Gannon dual history.\n\nIn 1990-91, as a junior, Boyd became Gannon's fourth All-American when he placed sixth in the NCAA Tournament.\n\nHe set a precedent by becoming the first Golden Knight to earn a No. 1 national ranking in 1991.\n\nAs a senior in 1991-92, Boyd had an outstanding season. He rolled to a 29-3-1 record for an .894 winning percentage, the fourth-best, single-season mark among Gannon wrestlers. He had a 15-0-1 record in dual meets, tying him with Lyneil Mitchell for the most dual-meet wins in Gannon history. Boyd went 21-0-2 in duals over his final two seasons.\n\nA three-year captain with Gannon, Boyd was also an Academic All-American.\n\nAfter graduating with a bachelor's degree in biology in 1992, Boyd attended Palmer College of Chiropractic in Davenport, Iowa, and earned his Doctor of Chiropractic in 1996. While he was at chiropractic college, he started his coaching career as a volunteer at Augustana College in Rock Island, Illinois.\n\nThe Ashtabula, Ohio, native, returned to Erie in 1996 and served as a volunteer assistant and a part-time assistant before becoming a full-time assistant under Henry. Boyd recently celebrated 20 years as a Gannon University employee and is serving in his first season as head coach.\n\nBoyd and his wife, Christine, are chiropractors at Boyd Chiropractic Clinic and have been in practice together for 28 years.\n\nBoyd was supported by his entire wrestling team during his speech and was joined by a large number of wrestling alumni, in addition to his longtime coach and boss, Don Henry.\n\nRandy Colling, Football (2008-11):\n\nRandy Colling established himself as one of the most dominant and decorated defensive linemen in Gannon history. The 6-foot-5, 320-pound tackle used his strength and quickness to wreak havoc in opponents' offensive backfields.\n\nAfter his senior season, he was named an All-American by six organizations, including First Team selections by D2football.com and Beyond College Sports Network, Second Team picks by the Associated Press, Daktronics and D2ProDay.com, and an Honorable Mention from Don Hansen.\n\nColling was also a finalist for the Gene Upshaw Division II Lineman of the Year award.\n\nDuring his senior season, Colling led Gannon with 88 tackles (39 solo), 21.5 tackles for loss (89 yards lost), and 9 sacks (59 yards). His sack total was the second highest in GU history.\n\nAs a junior, he had 71 tackles (31 solo) and led Gannon with 12 tackles for loss and eight sacks. As a sophomore, he recorded 52 tackles (27 solo) and led the Knights with 12 tackles for loss and 6.5 sacks.\n\nIn 43 career games with Gannon, Colling had 220 tackles (101 solo), 48 tackles for loss (226 yards lost), and 25 sacks (179 yards). His career sack total ranks second in Gannon history.\n\nColling was an All-PSAC First Team selection as sophomore, junior, and senior, and he earned All-Region honors from at least one organization in each of those three seasons.\n\nAfter his career, he attended NFL mini-camps with the New York Giants and New York Jets. He later signed a futures contract with the Buffalo Bills. He eventually played for the Cleveland Gladiators of the Arena Football League. He played in the 2014 Arena Bowl and was an All-Arena selection in 2016. The Calgary Stampeders made him the No. 6 overall pick of the 2017 Canadian Football League Draft.\n\nThe Arcade N.Y., native attended Pioneer High School, in Yorkshire, N.Y., and he later coached wrestling and football at the school.\n\nHe was a criminal justice major at Gannon.\n\nAaron Joseph Cox, Baseball (2013-15):\n\nAaron Cox rewrote the record books as a pitcher for three seasons with the Golden Knights before being selected in the Major League Draft.\n\nThe 6-foot-4, 205-pound right-hander set Gannon career records with 251 strikeouts, 10.72 strikeouts per nine innings, 21 complete games, and 5 shutouts. He held opposing hitters to a .233 batting average in his career, which is also a program record. (His strikeout and shutout records have since been broken.)\n\nWhen he left Gannon in 2015, he had the three highest single-season strikeout totals (89 in 2014; 81 in 2013 and 2015). Those seasons now rank second through fourth. He also set the GU single-season record with 10 complete games in 2014.\n\nCox also ranks second in Gannon history with a 3.29 ERA and 18 career victories. He threw a no-hitter in 2015 against Limestone (S.C.).\n\nHowever, Cox wasn't only a star on the mound for the Golden Knights; he was a power-hitting standout at the plate. His 15 career homers tie him for seventh on Gannon's career list. He hit .284 with 115 hits, 24 doubles, 5 triples, and 72 RBIs in three seasons.\n\nHe was the PSAC West Freshman of the Year in 2013 when he earned Second Team All-PSAC West honors. He was a First Team All-PSAC West selection as a sophomore in 2014 and a Second Team All-PSAC West pick as a junior. Daktronics named him All-Region Second Team in 2014.\n\nHis brother, Kyle Cox, was also a standout on the Gannon baseball team.\n\nIn 2015, Aaron Cox became the fourth Gannon player to be selected in the Major League Draft when the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim drafted him in the 19th round. The Vineland, N.J., native was majoring in criminal justice before he signed a pro contract in 2015.\n\nHe pitched three seasons in the minor leagues, compiling a 7-3 record with a 3.64 ERA and 96 strikeouts in 101 innings.\n\nHe passed away on Aug. 15, 2018, at the age of 24.\n\nAaron's parents Pam and Joe Cox represented him at the ceremony as Pam delivered the acceptance speech. Also joining Aaron's parents were his brother, Kyle, who played baseball for Gannon, his sister Jessica, and her husband, Angels superstar Mike Trout.\n\nHannah Kren, Volleyball (2013-16, 2017 graduate):\n\nKren became Gannon's only three-time volleyball All-American as one of the premier all-around players in GU history.\n\nDespite standing just 5-foot-9, Kren used her leaping ability and power to pile up 1,633 career kills, the No. 6 total in Gannon history. She also starred defensively, racking up 1,588 digs, good for No. 5 on the Gannon career list. She is the only player in Gannon history to top both 1,500 kills and 1,500 digs.\n\nKren was a four-year star for the Golden Knights. She earned the 2013 PSAC West Freshman of the Year award and was the 2016 PSAC Athlete of the Year as a senior. She was an All-PSAC First Team selection as a sophomore, junior, and senior after making the Second Team as a freshman.\n\nIn each of her final three seasons, Kren was named All-Atlantic Region by the AVCA and D2CCA. She also made the NCAA Division II Atlantic Regional All-Tournament team in each of those three seasons.\n\nThe AVCA named her All-America Honorable Mention in 2014, 2015, and 2016.\n\nKren was also honored Eastern College Athletic Conference Offensive Player of the Year in 2016 and made the All-ECAC First Team as a junior and senior.\n\nShe was a key player on the 2016 Gannon team that won the PSAC Tournament title. Kren helped Gannon reach the NCAA Tournament in each of her four years.\n\nShe ranks second all-time at Gannon with 1,850.5 points in a statistic that was added in 2000.\n\nThe native of Waukesha, Wis., received her bachelor's degree in biology in 2016 and later earned a postgraduate degree at the St. Louis College of Pharmacy. She is now a staff pharmacist at Walgreens in Arlington, Va.\n\nLauren (Soldner) Radwan, Softball (2005-09, 2008 graduate 2010M ):\n\nFourteen years after her college career ended, Lauren (Soldner) Radwan is still at the top – or near the top – of many Gannon pitching categories.\n\nShe ranks second in program history with 65 career victories and ranks third with 566 strikeouts. She is the Golden Knights' career leader in pitching starts (103), appearances (120), single-season starts (31 in 2006), and single-season appearances (36 in 2006).\n\nHer 21 victories in 2006 are tied for the most in Gannon history, and her 20 wins in 2005 tie her for fourth.\n\nShe led Gannon in pitching victories in each of her four full seasons, not including her medical redshirt season in 2007.\n\nAs freshman, she went 20-10 with a 1.49 ERA and 164 strikeouts. As a sophomore in 2006, she went 21-11 with a 2.45 ERA with a career-best 190 strikeouts. Soldner was a key player on the 2006 team that won the GLIAC Tournament championship. She also helped the team to three NCAA appearances.\n\nAfter starting the 2007 season with a 3-0 record and 1.27 ERA, she tore her ACL and broke her kneecap while pitching during Gannon's spring trip. She redshirted, and the injury limited her final two seasons. Soldner still won 11 games in 2008 and 10 more in 2009 as she led the team in victories both years.\n\nThe Toledo, Ohio native, was also an outstanding student. She was a three-time ESPN The Magazine Academic All-District Selection and made the GLIAC All-Academic Team several times.\n\nShe earned her bachelor's degree in elementary education (K-6) and special education (Pre-K- 12) in 2008.

She is married to former Gannon baseball standout Greg Radwan, and the couple has three children. As Lauren gave her speech on Saturday, her youngest daughter yelled, \"Mommy\" from the crowd. Lauren also pointed out that her son is named Gannon, after the university that is so important to her and her husband.\n\nMindy Richmond, Women's Lacrosse (2002-05, 2005 graduate):\n\nRichmond proved herself to be a premier lacrosse player at Gannon in the mid-2000s, and she established herself as a top coach after she graduated.\n\nRichmond was a high-scoring attacker with the Golden Knights. She left Gannon as the all-time goal scorer with 219. She now ranks third on the GU list in goals, and she ranks ninth with 242 points.\n\nAs a senior, Richmond set a Gannon record with 88 goals as she led all of NCAA Division II in 2005. That goal total is 11 more than any other single-season mark by a Gannon player. The IWLCA named her a First Team All-American after that season.\n\nAs a junior, she scored 63 goals and earned IWLCA Second Team All-America status. Her goal total for that season still ranks eighth in Gannon history.\n\nRichmond set the Gannon single-game record in 2004 with nine goals . (The record was tied in 2010). She also scored eight goals four times during her prolific 2005 season.\n\nShe was Gannon's 2005 nominee for NCAA Woman of the Year.\n\nAfter her playing career, Richmond served as an assistant coach at Gannon for two seasons, helping the Golden Knights go 23-8 over the 2007 and 2008 seasons.\n\nShe then became the head coach at IUP, where she stayed for 10 highly successful seasons, compiling a 105-67 record. She coached eight All-Americans, 15 All-Region players, and 33 All-PSAC selections. In 2013, she was honored as the PSAC Coach of the Year.\n\nRichmond is now the head women's lacrosse coach at Lynn University (Fla.), where she started the program in 2020. Her Lynn teams have gone 25-10 in the past two seasons.\n\nDISTINGUISHED SERVICE AWARD HONOREE:\n\nDolores \"Dee\" Smith (1969-73, 1985-2020):\n\nSmith was a devoted employee of Gannon University for almost 40 years, including 31 years with the Gannon Athletic Department.\n\nShe spent two four-year stints with Gannon's Library/Technical Services before moving to the Athletic Department in 1989 when she became the secretary for the football team after the program was resurrected. Smith spent 18 years with the football team before becoming the administrative assistant for Gannon Athletics in 2007. She served in that role until her retirement in 2020.
