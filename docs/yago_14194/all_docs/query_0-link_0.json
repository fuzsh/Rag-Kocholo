In 1993, he finds himself as the prosecuting district attorney head-to-head against ex-wife Nora Hanen (Hillary B. Smith) in the infamous Todd Manning and Marty Saybrooke rape trial. Nora throws the case upon uncovering evidence implicating Todd in the rape, although Todd never serves jail time.\n\nAfter years of prosecuting Llanview criminals, Hank leaves his post as district attorney in 2003 after mishandling of the Mitch Laurence (Roscoe Born) murder case. He returns to Llanview with his daughter Rachel in April 2009 upon the news that Nora's son Matthew (Eddie Alderson) was paralyzed in a car accident.\n\nReception\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2020, Candace Young and Charlie Mason put Hank on their list of Daytime's Most Important African-American Characters, commenting \"By the time we met Nathan Purdee's \"The Cannon,\" he'd already traded the football field for the courtroom\" and that he was a \"mvp\" who could \"still score\".[7]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
