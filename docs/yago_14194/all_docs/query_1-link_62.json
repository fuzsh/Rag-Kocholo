        "text": "(Nee Statza) Marion, who was a beautiful and loving treasure to all that knew her and who surrounded herself with the love she had for her family, passed away peacefully on September 1, 2014. She was 83-years-old.\n\nMarion was born August 16, 1931, daughter to the late Henry and Esther Statza. For much of her childhood, she lived on N. 18th Street and many of her stories were about that challenging, yet happy, time of her life. She attended West Division and remained in close contact with many classmates throughout her life. Marion married her high school sweetheart, Thomas R. Gannon, on June 9, 1951 in Biloxi, Mississippi, where Tom was stationed in the Air Force. Tom passed away in 1983 and eleven years later Marion married Wayne Shearier, a lifelong friend of Tom and Marion's, whose wife Shirley had passed some years earlier. Wayne passed away in 2009.\n\nThe family she loved so much will dearly miss Marion. She and Tom raised a beautiful family of 6 children, Gary (Mary) Gannon, Thomas A. (Joni) Gannon, Kelly (Steve) Miller, Kim (Jim) Stelloh, Todd Gannon, and Kristy (Todd) Evers. Marion is the beloved Grandma to Patrick and Ryan Gannon, Kayte (Wes) Parkin and T.J. (Kathy) Gannon, Scott and Stevie Miller, Brittany Brahm and Brandon and Brady Stelloh, and Lauren Pulaski, and Emily and Eddie Evers. Marion was also blessed with great-grandsons, Tommy and Cameron Gannon and Adam Parkin. She is also survived by her brothers Donald (Catherine) Statza, Kenneth (Laura) Statza and James Statza, and by sisters-in-law Patricia (James) Slaby, Rosemary (Edward) Murphy, Karoline Statza, Catherine Statza, Laura Statza and Nancy Statza and by many nieces and nephews and wonderful caring neighbors and friends.\n\nIn addition to Tom and Wayne, Marion was preceded in death by her parents, Henry and Esther Statza and her siblings Loraine, Audrey, Billy, Nancy, June (Edward) Gerpoltz, Henry (Karoline), Shirley (Richard) Beste, and Gerald (Nancy). She was also preceded in death by her grandson Patrick, her father-in-law Thomas E. Gannon, her dear mother-in-law Margaret Gannon, and brothers-in-law James J. Slaby, Edward Murphy, Edward Gerpoltz, and Richard Beste.\n\nThe family will receive relatives and friends at the Funeral Home 12401 West National Avenue, on Friday, September 5, 2014 from 10:00-11:45 AM. Celebration of Marion's Life at 12:00 PM. Burial services to follow at Mount Olivet Cemetery.\n\nThe family wishes to express its appreciation to the entire staff of St. Francis Hospital, with special and heartfelt appreciation to Nurses; Caleb, Erin and Crystal, PCA; Megan, Hospice Nurse; Debbie, and family friend; Julie for their compassionate care of our mother and our entire family. In lieu of flowers, memorials to Special Olympics of Wauwatosa or a charity of your choice."
