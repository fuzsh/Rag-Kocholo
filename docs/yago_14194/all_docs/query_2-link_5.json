        "text": "During this time, Hanks brother, RJ became intent on ruining his career. RJ never followed in his brothers shadow, instead he became a hustler, making money any way he could, mostly illegally. RJ decided to use a videotape taken when Hank was still at Midwestern, that allegedly showed him standing by as a murder was being committed. Hank was forced to resign from office, then Bo Buchanan found the real tape, which exonerated Hank, whose good reputation was restored.\n\nIn 1995, Hank presented states evidence against Llanview police officer Andy Harrison, involving possession of a stolen weapon, intent to sell, and the murder of a local teenage gang member. Charges were later dropped.\n\nOn Valentines Day in 1995, Hank married his longtime love, nurse Sheila Price. Because their marriage was filled with problems they divorced in 1996, after Sheila told Hank she was pregnant. Hank was not happy about the news, which caused her to miscarry a few days later.\n\nIn 1996, Hank set his sights on finding evidence to put the recently resurrected Carlo Hesser behind bars. Then Carlo was shot and Hank prosecuted Antonio Vega for the crime. Later, evidence revealed that Alex Hesser, Carlos wife, had murdered him. The truth was that Carlo had again masterminded his own death to get out of the country.\n\nTwo years later, Todd Manning was accused of murdering Georgie Phillips, and Hank thought he would be prosecuting Todd once again. However, it turned out that Hanks daughter, Rachel had killed her. Rachel went to prison and served her time.\n\nHank met Carlotta Vega, Antonios mother, who owned a local restaurant. They dated several times and grew quite fond of one another, but when Hank proposed to Carlotta she turned him down and that was the end of their relationship. Shortly after this, he started dating Lisa West, a detective on the LDP.\n\nPolice Commissioner Bo Buchanan became a very close friend of Hanks and asked Hank to stand as his best man for his wedding to Lindsay Rappaport, which never took place.\n\nIn 1999, Hank prosecuted Will Rappaport for embezzling money from a foundation set up by Asa Buchanan in memory of his great-granddaughter, Megan. Bo showed Hank evidence that pointed to Asa as setting up Will, so Hank offered Will a plea bargain. Unfortunately, during the trial, the judge threw it out and sent Will to Statesville Prison on a maximum sentence."
