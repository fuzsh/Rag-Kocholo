        "text": "Please share a memory of Henry to include in a keepsake book for family and friends.\n\nHenry Mitchell Goodgold\n\nMarch 19, 1953-June 21, 2024\n\nHenry Mitchell Goodgold, passed away Friday June 21st. He possessed flawless comedic timing, a great singing voice, beautiful skills as a piano player, a deep passion for music and science and medicine and he had encyclopedic knowledge. The original geek chic, Henry was an avid stamp collector (no there’s literally BOOKS of stamps) rock collector, Mets fan, and boasted an impressive stint on the Hewlett High school math team. He skipped a grade and was in the esteemed 5th/6th program. He built a replica of the Polo Grounds out of our Dad’s shirt cardboards. A favorite story is that he once received a C in gym class.\n\nAfter undergrad at SUNY Buffalo and Medical School at NYU, He did his residency and fellowship in Washington DC, then Richmond, VA, and then became a Doctor of Nuclear Medicine at St. Louis University Hospital. He was there for 20 years until his Multiple Sclerosis forced him to retire in 2000.\n\nHe was diagnosed in 1981, and over the years his MS advanced until he was wheelchair bound and needed constant, round-the-clock care. What we didn’t know until recently is that he had been battling frontal lobe dementia, probably since 1986, a disorder that changed his personality and further affected him negatively.\n\nThe world can be so cruel to have caused such a slow and steady decline in him throughout the decades. Where others could walk, he could not. Where others could work, he could not. Where other could play music, he could not. Where others could converse, he, eventually, could not. He never complained, however. And we all learned to be grateful for the ability to do things most take for granted.\n\nHe is survived by his Daughter Shauna Goodgold, her husband Chris Tonsmeire, their new baby Isla Ruth, his Sister Carolee Goodgold, her boyfriend Kenny Hassler, his Brother Robert, his wife Christine and their children Rachel and Julia, Shauna’s Mother Sheryl Mandel, and many more family members that loved him. He is pre deceased by his loving Parents Ruth and Albert Goodgold and his loving dog Willie."
