        "text": "ANNOUNCER: The state's first elk farm was established in Centre County to raise elk for what purpose?\n\nThe nation's largest building implosion took place in Pennsylvania.\n\nDo you know what landmark came crashing down?\n\nFind out as we all play The Pennsylvania Game.\n\n[theme music] The Pennsylvania Game is made possible in part by Uni-Marts Incorporated, with stores in Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, and Virginia, serving you with courtesy and convenience every day of the year.\n\nUni-Marts-- more than a convenience store.\n\nNow, let's get the game started.\n\nHere's the woman of the airwaves and she's also got hair waves.\n\nIt's the host of The Pennsylvania Game, Lynn Cullen.\n\n[audience cheering] I always try to walk down without looking at my feet because they all-- remember Loretta Young who used to sweep in?\n\nShe never like, she never, like, went like this.\n\nI'm so afraid of falling down.\n\nBut I didn't, did I?\n\nHello, hello, and welcome.\n\nWelcome to my studio audience.\n\nWelcome to the television audience.\n\nAnd welcome to, huh, the hapless panel.\n\n[laughter] There they are.\n\nAh, what awaits you.\n\nLet's meet them now.\n\nHe's a newcomer to The Pennsylvania Game, Shawn Clerkin, director of theater and assistant professor at Gannon University in Erie.\n\nHe lives there with his wife, his mother in law, two Russian foreign exchange students, and a dog.\n\nSo, welcome.\n\nAt least you got away for the day.\n\nYes, I am.\n\n[applause] And next, Natalie Hallock, office manager for the Williams Chiropractic and Physical Therapy Center in state college.\n\nDo I have a bad back today?\n\nI'll see you later.\n\nShe's an active member of the State College Community Theatre at Boal Barn and a member of a local Harley-Davidson Owners Group.\n\nWhew, Natalie!\n\n[applause] Yeah, she rides that hog.\n\nHey, Jerry Marshall, our third panelist.\n\nSecondary social studies teacher at St. Mary's Parochial School and past mayor of St. Mary's.\n\nCall him your honor.\n\nHis lifelong dream to ride the trains throughout South America.\n\nWelcome, Jerry.\n\nThank you.\n\n[applause] Again, welcome to you all.\n\nAnd especially to you, Jerry, all aboard, because this train is pulling out of the station.\n\nQuestion one.\n\nANNOUNCER: Historic Germantown in Philadelphia was founded by German craftsmen in 1683 and has played an important part in American history.\n\nWhich of the following is not true about Germantown?\n\nGermantown was, A, the temporary site of George Washington's White House; B, the birthplace of paper in North America; C, the site of several homes built for Queen Isabella of Spain; or D, the birthplace of the potato chip?\n\nLYNN CULLEN: Oh.\n\nmy, my, my, this game.\n\nWhere do they come up with this stuff?\n\nThree of those four statements are true of Germantown.\n\nOne is not, and that's the one we want you to ferret out.\n\nAnd if you can't just guess, that's what most people do on this show.\n\nAnd then just log in your answers.\n\nAnd we'll come to you and find out what incorrect answer you have chosen.\n\n[laughs] Shawn, which incorrect answer did you choose?\n\nI chose B. LYNN CULLEN: Aha.\n\nYeah.\n\nI just don't-- I would imagine that the other three sound strange enough to be true.\n\nLYNN CULLEN: OK, so you don't think that paper is-- No, not in Germantown, no.\n\nLYNN CULLEN: --invented in North America there or something.\n\nNo.\n\nLYNN CULLEN: And Natalie?\n\nI chose C for the same reason he did.\n\nI thought it didn't sound-- LYNN CULLEN: Why would Queen Isabella of Spain want to live in Germantown?\n\nIt just doesn't make any sense.\n\nSpain town, maybe, but Germantown?\n\nIt doesn't make sense.\n\nJerry?\n\nThis is going to make me look like a fool because I'm a social studies teacher.\n\nBut I pick C because it was the English and the French that were around Philadelphia or Germantown, that area, not the Spanish.\n\nDon't make me wrong.\n\nLYNN CULLEN: You know what?\n\nWell, no, I don't have to make you wrong.\n\nYou see, the way this works on this show is you guys do a fine job of that yourself.\n\nActually, we're about to prove that axiom right now.\n\nANNOUNCER: The answer is D. Germantown is not the birthplace of the potato chip.\n\nIn 1793, the yellow fever epidemic raged through the nation's capital of Philadelphia.\n\nIn order to escape the plague, President George Washington moved the business of the New Republic to the Deshler-Morris house until the danger passed.\n\nWilliam Rittenhouse started the first paper mill in North America in 1690 in historic Rittenhouse Town, where paper is still made to this very day.\n\nAnd several houses were built in Germantown for Queen Isabella and her entourage.\n\nThe homes were built as a safe haven for the queen.\n\nBut a threat on her life never materialized, and the houses were never occupied.\n\nHmm, that's what I say.\n\nI'd like to know more about that Queen Isabella story.\n\nWhat would be the connection?\n\nIf she has to run for her life, why would she end up there, huh?\n\nA question for another day.\n\nNext question, guys.\n\nThis will check your vocabulary skills.\n\nANNOUNCER: Four centuries of horological developments from the 1600s to the present day are showcased in this Columbia, Pennsylvania museum.\n\nIs horology the study of, A, plants; B, horoscopes; C, clocks and watches; or D, gems?\n\nLYNN CULLEN: That's one of those questions where if you took what, Greek?\n\nProbably Greek or Latin, you would know it.\n\nIt's Greek, I think.\n\nI don't know.\n\nBut it's Greek to us, isn't it?\n\nAnyway, stop looking dumbfounded and think of something to do over there.\n\nPlants, horoscopes, clocks and watches, or gems?\n\nHorology.\n\nNatalie?\n\nWe did the wrong-- LYNN CULLEN: No, what?\n\nWe do the right one or the wrong one?\n\nLYNN CULLEN: No!\n\nI mean, oh, she's new.\n\nNo, you see, the idea is to pick the right one.\n\nBut invariably, you do pick the wrong one.\n\nYou just pick the right one.\n\nNATALIE HALLOCK: OK. OK. Now, what'd you pick?\n\nWhat did you pick?\n\nWhatever it is, Natalie, tell me.\n\nJERRY MARSHALL: We wait for your answer.\n\nLYNN CULLEN: No, Natalie?\n\nI pick C. LYNN CULLEN: You pick C. [laughs] All right.\n\nClocks and watches said Natalie.\n\nAnd you, sir, Jerry?\n\nD. LYNN CULLEN: D, gem, says Jerry.\n\nAnd Shawn?\n\nI'd like to change D because I think Jerry knows what he's doing.\n\nBut I went with Natalie with the clocks and watches.\n\nLYNN CULLEN: All right.\n\nWe have two clocks and watches.\n\nWe have one gem.\n\nDo we have a correct answer?\n\nCould it be-- aha?\n\nANNOUNCER: The answer is C, clocks and watches.\n\nThe Clock and Watch Museum was founded in 1977 and is home to more than 8,000 timepieces.\n\nEstablished by the National Association of Watch & Clock Collectors to illustrate the history of timekeeping, it has everything from the early pocket sundials of the 1600s to the latest moonphase wrist watches.\n\nThe museum divides its collection by.\n\ntype and period.\n\nVisitors can enjoy a room full of German musical clocks, European pocket watches, tower clocks, and even American railroad watches.\n\nThe museum also maintains over 21,000 copies of US patents and 19th century trade publications.\n\nGee, I wonder who has the enviable job of changing the times during daylight savings time.\n\nHo, ho, ho.\n\nWell, we want to thank Mary Longenecker of Harrisburg for sending us that question.\n\nWe're going to send you in return a year's subscription to Pennsylvania Magazine, Mary.\n\nAnd now let's get to meet these panelists a little bit more.\n\nShawn?\n\nWhat was that litany I went through in introducing you?\n\nYou live with your mother-in-law.\n\nSHAWN CLERKIN: Right.\n\nThat's very good of you.\n\nYou live with a dog.\n\nMy dog, yes.\n\nYou live with two Russian exchange students?\n\nActually, one.\n\nHer name is Anya Shashiva, and she's visiting us for the year.\n\nUh-huh.\n\nYeah.\n\nAnd how does that work?\n\nOh, good so far.\n\nSo far so good.\n\nYeah.\n\nShe had some trouble adjusting to language and things like that.\n\nBut she's actually quite charming.\n\nLYNN CULLEN: Do you know any Russian?\n\nAnyone in your house-- Absolutely not.\n\nLYNN CULLEN: And she wasn't very fluent in English.\n\nShe had three years.\n\nBut I was amazed at what she was able to learn in three years.\n\nShe's really quite good at speaking, yeah.\n\nIt would be a rough transition, I would imagine, to go back or to come.\n\nI mean, the cultural-- SHAWN CLERKIN: Well, that's what she said.\n\nThe first thing she noticed was, you mean you have more than one kind of bread on the shelf.\n\nYeah, that was the first thing she said.\n\nLYNN CULLEN: Invariably.\n\nYou have choices.\n\nShe hates going to the store now because there are too many choices to make.\n\nLYNN CULLEN: Russians go crazy in our grocery stores.\n\nAnd they do say, and it's true, what do you need all these different kinds of the same thing for?\n\nAren't they-- right?\n\nSHAWN CLERKIN: That's right.\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nNatalie, you don't look like a sort of Harley-Davidson kind of a person.\n\n[laughter] How did that happen?\n\nOr maybe you do look like a Harley.\n\nI mean, do we have this funny stereotype in our heads?\n\nBecause you don't fit that image.\n\nYeah.\n\nI was surprised too.\n\nMy husband decided to buy a Harley last year.\n\nAnd I was, I wasn't too sure about it.\n\nBut I went along with it.\n\nAnd it turned out to be the best experience for me.\n\nLYNN CULLEN: What?\n\nNow, you're out there every what?\n\nEvery weekend you're-- NATALIE HALLOCK: Every evening, every, and-- LYNN CULLEN: Do you ever drive?\n\nI mean, is it-- Not me.\n\nYou're always on the-- why don't you learn how to handle your own?\n\nGet your own.\n\nGet your own.\n\nGet your own.\n\nNot yet.\n\nNot yet.\n\nLYNN CULLEN: OK. Get a little side car.\n\nI always want to ride in a little sidecar.\n\nHey, Jerry, your dream is to do all the trains in South America.\n\nWhy?\n\nWell, one time on the educational channel, I saw a movie about trains all over the place.\n\nAnd the ones in South America were really great because people just pack on them and go.\n\nAnd the country is beautiful down there.\n\nI've never been there.\n\nBut through educational TV, I guess, I've been there.\n\nBut I just would like to go down there.\n\nLYNN CULLEN: I hope you do.\n\nI really hope you do.\n\nAnd having been in Bolivia, may I suggest that if you have one shot, hit Peru and Bolivia so you do Machu Picchu and the Andes and all of that.\n\nIt's just simply wonderful.\n\nJERRY MARSHALL: Thank you.\n\nSimply wonderful.\n\nDo you know anybody down there who can help me out or anything?\n\nMaybe I do.\n\nWe'll talk later.\n\nWe'll talk later.\n\nRight now, I know nobody who can help you out, seeing as you haven't gotten an answer right yet.\n\nLet's give you another question.\n\nJERRY MARSHALL: I should have followed these two.\n\nANNOUNCER: Founded in 1937 by Jerome Markowitz, Allen Organ Company of Macungie, Pennsylvania is the world's leading builder of church organs.\n\nBut this Pennsylvania-based company occupies a unique position in the history of musical technology for another reason.\n\nDid the Allen Organ Company, A, receive the first patent for the Jamaican steel drum; B, build the world's first pipeless organ; C, introduced the world's first digital musical instrument; or D, designed the first solar-powered electric organ?\n\nLYNN CULLEN: What did they do in Allen Organ?\n\nPulling out all the stops.\n\nWhat do they do?\n\nJamaican steel, oh, it took you a little while.\n\nSo build the world's first pipeless organ, digital or solar power?\n\nLog in those responses.\n\nAnd, Jerry, I'm coming to you.\n\nC for no reason.\n\nLYNN CULLEN: You know, that's the best way.\n\nYou go like that and you'll win.\n\nThat's the way to go.\n\nJERRY MARSHALL: I'm sitting here thinking hard C for some reason.\n\nOK, Shawn?\n\nI went for D. LYNN CULLEN: You went for D for no reason.\n\nFor no reason.\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nNatalie?\n\nThey keep taking my answers.\n\nIt was C. LYNN CULLEN: It was C for no reason whatsoever.\n\nRight.\n\nThey're getting the hang of this.\n\nLet's find out the answer for no reason.\n\nANNOUNCER: The answer is C. The world's first company to introduce a digital musical instrument.\n\nIn 1968, North American Rockwell contacted scores of manufacturing companies looking to have its digital technology, which was developed for the Apollo space program, applied in the consumer market.\n\nAllen Organ Company was the only major US organ maker willing to take a chance on the untried technology.\n\nThree years later, in 1971, Jerome Markowitz introduced the first ever digital music product, the Allen ADC organ.\n\nIt was seen as a marvel of its time.\n\nSoon after, the technology was applied to other areas of the music industry and eventually to recordings on compact discs.\n\nThat's amazing.\n\nCame out of the space program, the Apollo program.\n\nAnd now digital?\n\nI mean, everywhere.\n\nAnd you see how relatively recent that was.\n\nAstounding as is our score.\n\nLet's check it out for the first time.\n\nNot bad, Natalie.\n\nAll right.\n\nVroom, vroom, you're in the lead, in the lead with two.\n\n[applause] Shawn and Jerry right behind you.\n\nSo close game.\n\nSHAWN CLERKIN: We need to catch up.\n\nLYNN CULLEN: Here it is, the Mystery Pennsylvanian.\n\nYour first clue.\n\nI'm going to give you three throughout the program.\n\nGet it right.\n\nThe first clue, three points.\n\nSecond clue, two points.\n\nThird clue, one.\n\nFirst clue, born in Kennett Square, Pennsylvania in 1947, she was often referred to as golden girl.\n\nKennett Square, PA 1947.\n\nGolden girl.\n\nYou ponder that.\n\nThink about it.\n\nIf you have any ideas, just set it down.\n\nYou never know.\n\nYou could be right.\n\nAnd if you think that's a mystery, well, you see our next question.\n\nANNOUNCER: The Murphys caused quite a stir in Potter Township back in 1994 when they established the state's first elk farm.\n\nTheir 55 acre spread known as Elk View Farm is home to nearly 50 purebred, registered, Rocky Mountain elk.\n\nAre the elk raised, A, to produce folk medicine; B, for their low fat meat; C, for racing; or D, for their milk?\n\nLYNN CULLEN: Yeah.\n\nI went to an elk race just the other day.\n\nWow!\n\nWhat do you raise elk for?\n\nFolk medicine?\n\nMeat?\n\nRacing?\n\nOr milk?\n\n[ding] It's amazing the things we don't know, isn't it?\n\nShawn?\n\nWhy do you raise elk for?\n\nI'm going to guess the folk medicine thing just because it sounds kind of romantic.\n\nLYNN CULLEN: Romantic.\n\nYeah.\n\nIt sounds kind of folksy sort of thing.\n\nI like that.\n\nLYNN CULLEN: OK. Natalie?\n\nB. LYNN CULLEN: B?\n\nUh-huh.\n\nLYNN CULLEN: For no-- No reason.\n\nLYNN CULLEN: No, and low fat meat.\n\nEverybody's into it.\n\nNow, Jerry?\n\nI'm going to vote B and tell her why she's right.\n\nLYNN CULLEN: OK. Why is she right?\n\nBuffalo are low fat and elk sort of look a little bit like buffalo to me, although buffalo are a little fatter.\n\nSo I'm going to pick that.\n\nLYNN CULLEN: You think it would be, yeah?\n\nYeah.\n\nLYNN CULLEN: Absolutely.\n\nAs a matter of fact, I'll take you out for an elk burger right after this.\n\nAll right.\n\nJERRY MARSHALL: Thank you.\n\nLet's get the right answer.\n\nANNOUNCER: The answer is A, to produce folk medicine.\n\nRon and Kathy Murphy say they're on the cutting edge of an enterprise that's going to be very big in Pennsylvania, selling the antler velvet grown each year by bull elk to firms which process and sell the material as folk medicine.\n\nLong used in the Orient, elk velvet is becoming more popular in North America.\n\nA full grown male can produce as much as 30 pounds of velvet each year at a selling price of $75 a pound.\n\nThe bulls themselves can fetch as much as $25,000 a head.\n\nThe Murphys opened the 55-acre Elk View Farm, the first farm of its kind in Pennsylvania in 1994, and predict that Pennsylvania will someday be a major player in the elk business.\n\nI can smell the dander, though.\n\nInteresting, though.\n\nI bet they smell.\n\nListen, the Murphys are smelling money over there.\n\nOur poor videographer went to shoot that during elk mating season.\n\nAnd it was like, I mean, apparently, they really get a little weird during mating season.\n\nBut then don't we all.\n\n[laughter] Are we supposed to move on?\n\nI think we have another, excuse me, I think we have another question.\n\nI hope so.\n\nANNOUNCER: In 1838, Rebecca Gratz founded an institution in Philadelphia that was the first of its kind in the United States.\n\nIt admitted both boys and girls.\n\nWhat was it?\n\nA, an orphanage; B, a music conservatory; C, a military academy; or D, a Jewish Sunday school?\n\nLYNN CULLEN: Rebecca Gratz, the year 1838, first of its kind.\n\nAn orphanage?\n\nMusic conservatory?\n\nMilitary academy?\n\nOr a Jewish Sunday school?\n\nFigure it out.\n\nMake a guess.\n\nAnd Natalie, what'd you choose?\n\nB. LYNN CULLEN: B?\n\nHer name sounded musical.\n\nLYNN CULLEN: Gratz?\n\nNo, no, no!\n\nLYNN CULLEN: Oh!\n\nRebecca Gratz.\n\nLYNN CULLEN: Rebecca Gratz, yeah.\n\nIt has a lilt to it, I know.\n\n[laughter] Jerry?\n\nD for-- LYNN CULLEN: D?\n\nAgain, who knows the reason.\n\nLYNN CULLEN: Who knows?\n\nWho knows?\n\nA Jewish Sunday School, yeah, possible.\n\nI said C because the other three sounded reasonable.\n\nLYNN CULLEN: What?\n\nYou said Rebecca Gratz would, yeah-- Military academy for boys and girls.\n\nIt's-- LYNN CULLEN: It's ridiculous.\n\nYes.\n\nLYNN CULLEN: Right.\n\nWell, you're right.\n\nIt's ridiculous.\n\nLet's get the answer.\n\nANNOUNCER: The answer is D. In 1838, Rebecca Gratz founded America's first Jewish Sunday School.\n\nIt opened with 50 students, both boys and girls, who studied primarily biblical history and religion.\n\nFrom its humble beginnings, the Jewish Sunday School grew and prospered and is still in existence today as the Community Hebrew sunday schools.\n\nAll right.\n\nProgressive thing for her to do since Jewish girls usually did not get a religious education.\n\nObviously, she was not an Orthodox Jew.\n\nLet's see that score.\n\nHas it changed?\n\nYou betcha.\n\nThey're tied up.\n\n[applause] Not at all.\n\nWe can break a tie here with the second clue for today's Mystery Pennsylvanian.\n\nIn 1982, she was named the fourth most trusted anchor person in America.\n\n'82.\n\nShe.\n\nFourth most trusted anchor person in America.\n\nWhich is sort of interesting since there were not a lot of female anchors at that point.\n\nWho is she?\n\nBorn in '47, referred to as golden girl.\n\nWrite it down if you know it.\n\nAnd we'll move on to our next question.\n\nANNOUNCER: On October 30, 1994, one of Philadelphia's most famous landmarks came crashing down into a heap of concrete and steel in what is touted as the nation's largest implosion ever.\n\nWhat landmark was it?\n\nA, John F. Kennedy Stadium; B, Independence Hall; C, the Sears Building; or D, the Biltmore Hotel.\n\nLYNN CULLEN: 10 seconds.\n\nKaplowee!\n\nJohn F. Kennedy Stadium, Independence Hall, Sears Building, or The Biltmore Hotel?\n\nJerry?\n\nI said The Biltmore Hotel.\n\nLYNN CULLEN: OK. And I wish I had a reason for you, but I don't.\n\nLYNN CULLEN: No!\n\nThere was no reason.\n\nNo reason at all.\n\nWhat's your no reason?\n\nI said D because I was cheating and watch Jerry push D. [laughter] LYNN CULLEN: All right.\n\nThat usually gets you nowhere on this show.\n\nNatalie?\n\nI picked C because I thought the other three are still there.\n\nI don't know.\n\nLYNN CULLEN: Really?\n\nLast time you looked, Independence Hall was there?\n\nI think so.\n\nLYNN CULLEN: Last time I looked, it was too.\n\nLet's see what isn't there because one of those buildings isn't.\n\nANNOUNCER: The answer is C, The Sears Building.\n\nIn a matter of seconds, 12,000 pounds of dynamite turned the 74-year-old Sears, Roebuck and Company building into a massive pile of dust and rubble.\n\nThe demolition of the 25,000,000 cubic foot building was the largest ever in the country, nearly four times the previous record.\n\nThe landmark building best known for its 14-story clock tower was raised to put up a shopping center.\n\nNearly 50,000 people witnessed the explosion, many of whom later stormed the fence surrounding the site to gather keepsakes from the blast.\n\nLYNN CULLEN: Yeah.\n\nDid you hear that audio accompaniment?\n\nWoo!\n\nWoo!\n\nIt's amazing how people can't think of anything to say when something big happens.\n\nOoh!\n\nOoh!\n\nIt took less than 10 seconds for that building to go down and more than two months to clean up the mess it made.\n\nAnd any mother can tell you that too.\n\nIt's always easier-- It's always easier to make a mess than clean it up.\n\nWill you stop it?\n\nLet's have another question.\n\nANNOUNCER: In 1995, 101-year-old Betty Hettler of Denver, Pennsylvania, was recognized for something she's been doing for nearly 70 years.\n\nIn fact, she can be found endorsing this practice in magazine ads nationwide.\n\nIs it A, using Noxzema; B, recycling; C, drinking wine; or D, weight lifting?\n\nLYNN CULLEN: Oh, man, I hope it's drinking wine.\n\nI really do.\n\nBecause I do and I'd like to make it to 101 myself and look that good.\n\nWhat does Betty there use or do?\n\nDoes she weight lift?\n\nDoes she use Noxzema?\n\nShawn, what does she do?\n\nShe looks gentle and kind and caring of the environment, so I chose recycling.\n\nLYNN CULLEN: Absolutely!\n\nShe does recycle.\n\nNatalie?\n\nDrinking wine because you said so.\n\n[laughter] LYNN CULLEN: Oh man, that's the blind leading the blind, darling.\n\nDon't do that.\n\nJerry?\n\nDrinking wine.\n\nShe had a very pleasant smile on her face.\n\n[laughter] All right.\n\nSo we think Betty is a wino.\n\nI wonder what the right question, right question, what's the answer, for heaven's sake?\n\nANNOUNCER: The answer is A, using Noxzema.\n\nBetty Hettler often told the folks at the personal care home where she lived that she had been washing with Noxzema skin cream for nearly 70 years.\n\nWhen a staff member called Procter & Gamble's toll-free number to tell them about Hettler, they decided to make her a Noxzema girl.\n\nFor her endorsement, she received the usual $100 fee for unsolicited endorsements and a lifetime supply of the skin cream.\n\nBut because of Hettler's special and unusual situation, the company also gave her a big screen TV, stereo headphones, and a VCR.\n\nThe 101-year-old Denver beauty keeps a framed copy of her magazine ad on her bedroom wall.\n\n[whimsical music] LYNN CULLEN: A lifetime supply of Noxzema.\n\nShe's 101.\n\nWell, geez.\n\nOh, hi, I'm sorry.\n\nI didn't know you were on me.\n\nIs it time for our third clue already?\n\nYeah.\n\nThis is it.\n\nLast chance, guys.\n\nThird clue, Mystery Pennsylvanian.\n\nOnce referred to as the Marilyn Monroe of TV news, she died in 1983 as tragically as she had lived.\n\nThe victim of a freak automobile accident in New Hope.\n\nYeah.\n\nIt was big, big, big news at the time.\n\nMet her end drowning in a car with her dog, I believe.\n\nNamed the fourth most trusted anchor in America in 1982.\n\nBorn in Kennett Square.\n\nGolden girl.\n\nShe would be, what, 49 years old today.\n\nOK, that's it.\n\nLast chance.\n\nThat's it.\n\nThat's it.\n\nNatalie, you have anything down there?\n\nMm-hmm.\n\nLYNN CULLEN: We want to see your, we want to see your answers now.\n\nWhat do you have?\n\nFirst, you said Betty Grable.\n\nAnd then you said Jessica Savitch.\n\nAnd then you said Jessica Savitch.\n\nAll right.\n\nI'll let you just stay there for a while.\n\nAnd Jerry?\n\nGratz?\n\nGratz?\n\nWait a minute.\n\nJane Pauley and Jane Pauley.\n\nBut you're not sure about that, are you?\n\nI'm not sure about that.\n\nI saw her the other day.\n\n[laughter] Hello?\n\nHi.\n\nI misspelled Savitch.\n\nLYNN CULLEN: You have, yes, because it was Savitch.\n\nRue McClanahan, Barbara Walters, and Jessica Savage, Savitch.\n\nWell, we've got some Jessica Savitches, so it could be you guys are on to something.\n\nLet's find out.\n\nANNOUNCER: Jessica Savitch was born in Kennett Square, Pennsylvania in 1947.\n\nGreatly influenced by her father, she was determined to become a successful broadcast journalist.\n\nAlthough the field was predominantly male, the driven, hardworking, sometimes temperamental and troubled Savitch made it to the top.\n\nIn 1982, she was named the fourth most trusted anchor in America.\n\nShe blazed a trail for women on TV and paid a high price for it.\n\nShe worked as a reporter and anchor in Houston and Philadelphia before rising to stardom as NBC's senate correspondent on Capitol Hill and weekend anchor of NBC's News Digest.\n\nOnce referred to as the Marilyn Monroe of TV news, her life and career came to a tragic end in 1983 when she was killed in a freak automobile accident in New Hope, Pennsylvania.\n\nMore than a decade after her death, she is still immensely popular with the public.\n\nJessica Savitch, a famous Pennsylvanian.\n\nTruly a tragedy.\n\nThis woman blazed so many trails for women in television.\n\nBeing a woman in television, I thank her for it.\n\nThe pressure she was under when she got to the network was extraordinary.\n\nAnd that led to drugs and other self-destructive behavior.\n\nAnd she had this very famous sort of breakdown on the air where she was mumbling and stumbling.\n\nHer sister is a weekend anchor in Pittsburgh-- Lori, excuse me, Lori Savitch.\n\nAnd she was also the consulting producer of a recent made for television documentary that aired on Lifetime television called Intimate Portrait-- Jessica Savitch, which I believe was the most watched program on that network ever.\n\nJessica Savitch.\n\nAnd I'll tell you, they had her anchoring.\n\nThey showed-- I'd forgotten how good she was.\n\nThere's not an anchor, male or female, alive that could touch that woman.\n\nSo it's really, really, really a tragedy.\n\nJessica Savitch, extraordinary.\n\nI suppose you want to know who won.\n\nI suppose you do know who won.\n\nIt sure wasn't you.\n\nIt wasn't me.\n\nIt sure wasn't him.\n\nWell, I think it means it was Natalie!\n\n[applause] And Natalie-- Oh, thank you.\n\nThat's for you.\n\nIt's a deluxe gift box of assorted chocolates from Gardners Candies headquartered in Tyrone, PA, sweets for the sweet.\n\nI thank you so much.\n\nI thank you gentlemen too.\n\nYou're a lot of fun.\n\nSHAWN CLERKIN: Thank you.\n\nAudience, you are great, although you have to stop flashing those wrong answers at these poor guys because they're buying them.\n\nThey're buying them.\n\nThank you most of all for joining us.\n\nAnd we hope you'll do it again.\n\nTune us in when we play The Pennsylvania Game.\n\n[applause] ANNOUNCER: The Pennsylvania Game is made possible in part by
