        "text": "Success Coach Director\n\nSarah Garcia-Linz has been with Lansing Community College since 2010. She started her journey at LCC with the Business & Community Institute, first as a program coordinator and then a Success Coach for ePathways, a partnership with Capital Area Michigan Works. From those experiences she was able to broaden her work as a Success Coach for the Computer Information Technologies program and Technical Careers before shifting over to the college-wide Success Coach program in 2017. Since then she became a Manager in 2018 and now is serving as Director of this program. Prior to LCC Sarah earned her Master of Arts in Student Affairs Administration from MSU and worked at MSU, UNH, and Brown in the area of residence life/housing.

She loves Lansing, Learning, and LCC Stars!\n\nSuccess Coach Manager\n\nI am originally from Mission Texas, I moved to Michigan in 2009 to complete my undergraduate degree at Michigan State University in Psychology. Being fluent both in English and Spanish allowed me to serve in multiple community service programs in Merida and Mazatlán Mexico.\n\nI come from a Migrant Seasonal Farm working family, therefore my first job was in the fields, harvesting onion in New Mexico and Colorado, Grapefruit in south Texas and Blueberries in west Michigan. I began my professional career working with teenage refugees for Lutheran Social Services, as a translator and a Youth Specialist. I was then given the opportunity to work with Migrant Seasonal Farmworkers and Farmers in the central and southeast counties as an Agriculture Talent Specialist with Capital Area Michigan Works!. In which I conducted outreach and job development throughout these counties. Later, I transitioned to a different position within Capital Area Michigan Works! as an Employment/Reemployment Specialist. Providing services to job seekers and employers in Eaton County.\n\nI enjoy reading, strong coffee, soccer, baseball, camping, fishing, running, music, dinners with family and friends, and walks with my dog Homie.\n\nAcademic Success Coach\n\nErin recently moved to the Lansing area from Traverse City to fulfill her passion of working with students in higher education as an Academic Success Coach at Lansing Community College. Prior to becoming an Academic Success Coach, Erin earned a bachelor's degree from Albion College and a master's degree in counseling from Western Michigan University.\n\nOver the past 10 years, Erin has gained experience working with at-risk youth and their families as an Early Impact therapist, SafeNet prevention specialist, and foster care adoption worker.

I'm from the Lansing area and I am a proud Alma College and Memphis Theological Seminary alum where I got my Bachelors and then Masters. Currently, I live in Lansing with my spouse, Jared, my three cats (Leo, Mona, and Jelly Bean), and my four chickens (Lola, Cookie, Lucky, and Lacy).\n\nBefore coming to LCC, I worked as a job coach and skills trainer at Peckham Inc. and as a program coordinator for REACH, a non-profit art studio in Lansing. My passion for community work led me to LCC, where I started in the StarZone helping students with LCC processes. I then moved on to Admissions Counseling, where I assisted students in getting started at LCC. Now, I have the privilege of supporting students as an Academic Success Coach!\n\nI became a coach because, firstly, I love college. I am a big believer in the power of education to change our lives and our communities, and for me, college is all about trying new things and considering new ideas, which is so exciting. Secondly, I love helping students. While I love college, I also know that it isn’t easy. I wanted to become a coach to help students navigate obstacles and build skills to get the most out of their college experience.\n\nIn my free time, I enjoy hiking, gardening, and spending time with family and friends. I also love playing music and games, and watching a good TV series. I'm excited to work with you, so feel free to reach out anytime!\n\nAcademic Success Coach\n\nHello! My name is Jay and I am excited to be part of the Success Coaching family here at LCC!\n\nOriginally from Southern California (West Covina - if you ever watched Crazy Ex Girlfriend I think you know the song), I am a traveler at heart and have lived in several places before including Manila, Philippines and Mie, Japan. Now, I am happy to call Lansing my home!\n\nI earned my Bachelor’s in Asian Humanities (Japanese) from UCLA and my Master’s in Educational Counseling from the University of La Verne.\n\nWhen I am not in the office you can find me obsessing over my shoes, printing miniatures with my 3D printer, cooking my favorite dishes, and exploring the greater Lansing area (recommendations are always welcomed!).\n\nI am looking forward to connecting with LCC students by helping you navigate your academic goals, work on problem-solving, and finding resources!\n\nAcademic Success Coach\n\nHi, I'm Jason and I am looking forward to being your Academic Success Coach here at Lansing Community College! I have spent the last 16 years working in higher education or human services in some capacity and cannot wait to leverage that experience to help the students of LCC navigate college life and work toward becoming the absolute best versions of themselves!\n\nAfter graduating from high school, I attended Michigan State University and earned a Bachelor of Arts degree. Later, I attended Western Michigan University and earned my Masters. In between, I worked in education for almost a decade, started and grew a family, and did my best to help every individual I worked with. When I'm not working, I can be found watching movies, reading a good book or article, eating unique foods, or rooting for the Lions (we all have our faults).\n\nI can't wait to work with everyone and help however I can!\n\nAcademic Success Coach\n\nMy name is Adriana Carreon. I was born and raised in Mexico where I earned a Bachelor's Degree in Social Work and worked several years as a counselor in the Social Rehabilitation Center for Minor Offenders, providing mental health services and teaching them social skills to ease their reintegration into society. In 2003, I moved with my family to Lansing, Michigan looking for a better life. After some years of struggling with the language barrier, in 2008, I became a student at Lansing Community College studying English as a second Language. While at LCC, I had the honor to be a Trio and LUCERO student and earn three Associate degrees: General, Arts in Spanish, and World Languages. While studying at LCC, I worked as a Spanish Tutor teaching Spanish to students from diverse backgrounds in the Tutoring Center. In 2013, I transferred to Michigan State University where I obtained a Bachelor's of Arts in Social Work, and in 2017, I earn a Master of Social Work with Clinical specialization.\n\nDuring my undergraduate studies at Michigan State University, I enjoyed studying abroad in Mexico for two consecutive spring breaks and serving as a student researcher in the School of Social Work and the Social Science College. I worked as Fellow Teacher/Peer Mentor for TRiO students supporting them with their transition from high school to college. I also had the opportunity to work with migrant seasonal farm workers students in the High School Equivalency Program empowering them emotionally and academically while pursuing their GED. Working with students in different capacities helped me to realize that my professional passion is serving students. Therefore, I gave a twist to my Social Work profession, and I completed a one year internship in the Center for Academic & Career Pathways at Lansing Community College. In this institution, I provided academic advising to students from diverse backgrounds that included students from the LUCERO Program. I call myself \"a product of LCC\" because in this institution I found the support and resources to be successful.\n\nI enjoy spending time with my family and friends, reading, cooking, and traveling. I believe that education is the bridge to success as well as it is the only possession that nobody can take away from people. I am excited to be a part of the Success Coach Team, and my goal is to support LCC students to accomplish their academic and personal goals.\n\nAcademic Success Coach\n\nMy name is Roshanda Donald and I was raised in Lansing, Michigan. After graduating from Lansing Everett High School I attended Western Kentucky University and Lansing Community College to complete prerequisite courses. Attending Northwood University in LCC's University Center, I completed the 3+1 program earning a Bachelor's degree in Business Administration in 2012. In 2014 I earned a Master's in Business Administration from Northwood University's DeVos Graduate School of Management.\n\nFollowing completion of the graduate program I was given the opportunity to work as Support at LCC's Center for Workforce Transition. In that role I had the opportunity to provide assistance with workshops, completion of the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA), course registration & Assessment testing at Capital Area Michigan Works. I later accepted a position as a Career Coach though Peckham Inc. In that role I provided tuition assistance, assistance with barrier removal and career counseling to adults and dislocated workers under the Workforce Innovation & Opportunity Act (WIOA) grant program.\n\nAs a first generation college graduate and Lansing Community College alum with experience in Workforce Development, I am passionate about helping students overcome barriers to reach their post-secondary education and employment goals. As an Academic Success Coach I'm excited to collaborate, build relationships, and provide mentorship and advocacy for the students of LCC.\n\nAcademic Success Coach\n\nI was born and raised in the Lansing area and graduated from Holt High School. I attended Wheaton College and was a member of the men's soccer team, and earned a Bachelors in Communication. After Wheaton I pursued a childhood dream and signed a contract to play soccer in Europe, spending a season in Sweden.\n\nUpon returning from Europe I began working with students as a graduate assistant coach for the Men's Soccer team at Olivet Nazarene University, and earned my Master's in Organizational Leadership. After Olivet, I moved to Loyola University – Chicago as an assistant coach with the Men's Soccer team there. During that time I also spent summers coaching as an assistant with the former semi-professional soccer team, Lansing United, here in the Lansing area. Despite my former full time role being in athletics, the biggest reason I stepped into coaching was because I love developing relationships with students, helping them grow during a pivotal time in their lives and ultimately reach their goals.\n\nBefore becoming an Academic Success Coach at LCC, I began with the college in 2019 as an Enrollment Support Specialist, helping students with a variety of account questions and college inquiries. I also speak Spanish and have used that to serve students. I spent a brief time away as a Student Services Counselor with Grand Canyon University before returning to LCC. As a result, I have a depth of knowledge about LCC specifically and can relate to the student experience, coming alongside to listen, connect, seek solutions and find success!\n\nIn my free time I enjoy trying to learn languages (J'apprends le francais, ادرس اللغة العربية) spending time with family and friends, reading, watching sports or a good show, being active and being outside.\n\nAcademic Success Coach\n\nZack (He/Him), was one of the first in his family to earn his college degrees. Zack took classes at 3 community colleges in addition to attending Central Michigan University in order to earn his science and ESL teaching degree. College was a tough transition and Zack realized the importance of having a support system which is why he became an Academic Success Coach at LCC.\n\nAfter graduating from CMU, Zack taught middle school then transitioned to being a College Advisor just outside of Detroit at Lincoln Park High School. He assisted high school seniors with their post-high school plans. Being one of the first in his family to graduate college, Zack is passionate about helping students through college. He knows there can be many challenges students face, but there are times to celebrate accomplishments as well. Zack decided to pursue a Master's degree in Student Affairs Administration at Michigan State University, where he worked with student government, volunteering organizations, and facilitated discussions on identity (race, gender, sexuality, etc). Zack enjoys working with students to help create a sense of community as that was key for him navigating college as a student who identified with the queer community and being a first-generation college student.\n\nWhen not at work, Zack enjoys spending time with family and friends, cooking, playing videogames, traveling, and spending time with his dogs.\n\nAcademic Success Coach\n\nI was born and raised here in Lansing, Michigan. I attended and graduated from Sexton High School. Post high school graduation, I attended Lansing Community College as a first-generation college student, not knowing that this was the first step towards my success as an adult. Like many new students, there was plenty of confusion, questions, and worries about attending college.\n\nPrior to becoming an Academic Success Coach, I was a Student Employee here at LCC working for the Cesar Chavez Center for 3 years while working in the retail industry as well. During my time as a Student Employee, I did not know what career path to follow but I did achieve my General Associate's Degree. 4 years later, a job opportunity for a full-time position here at LCC came about in December of 2014. As a Customer Relations Specialist, I was able to learn so much more about LCC, the surrounding community, higher education in general, and much more. During my time as a Enrollment Support Specialists, I also took classes and then transferred to Siena Heights University where I obtained my Bachelor's Degree in Community and Human Services in Fall of 2017, along with multiple associate degrees from LCC including Psychology. It was during this time that I realized that I had a passion for working with people and working in the higher education setting. I went from a first generational student with little to no knowledge about college and college resources to someone students can rely on for that information AS a resource, hoping that I can continue to bless those who I come across.\n\nDuring my downtime, or time away from work, I enjoy spending time with my family of 5, taking vacations and road trips, sporting events, hanging out with friends and extended family, swimming, and other outdoor activities.\n\nAcademic Success Coach\n\nHello, I am Pat and I use he, him, his pronouns. I am excited to serve as an Academic Success Coach here at Lansing Community College. I have been passionate about helping students since I decided I wanted to become an educator in high school.\n\nI attended Central Michigan University where I completed my degree in secondary education with majors in History and Industrial Education (teaching woodshop, metals, small engines etc.). After my semester student teaching, I realized my calling was to help students navigate the challenges and transitions of college life. Upon graduation, I accepted my first position in residence life and housing at McKendree University. At McKendree, I discovered how meaningful and impactful I could be to students as they explored themselves and worked to prepare for their careers. This realization encouraged me to enroll in the Higher Education Student Affairs (HESA) master’s program at Western Michigan University. The HESA program emphasized an attention to and appreciation of diversity exploration and inclusivity at colleges and universities.\n\nAfter completing my Master’s degree, I held a few positions with the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign, Alma College, and most recently with Michigan State University. I have spent these years managing and facilitating the student experience in residence halls where I was able to build relationships with students. I was a point contact for students who needed assistance with navigating campus, academic progress, social development, and connecting to campus. I am excited to bring these skills and experiences to the Lansing Community College campus and cannot wait to get the chance to meet you.\n\nI like to spend free time with my wife and son playing in our backyard or at neighborhood parks. When not with them, I enjoy hanging out with friends playing boardgames, table top games, or completing miniatures for Star Wars legion. I also enjoy reading novels and watching shows based in the Star Wars universe.\n\nAcademic Success Coach\n\nHi, I'm Randy. I was born and lived around the area for different parts of my life. I spent a few years in Great Falls, Montana while in high school and middle school. I also spent part of my adult life living in Yuma, Arizona.\n\nI graduated from Grand Valley State University with a B.S. in education with teaching certifications in K-12 Physical Education and Earth Science. I later obtained my M. Ed. in Educational Leadership. I went back to school for a short time and earned another teaching certification from Olivet College in Health education.\n\nMost of my experience has been in K-12 Education. I've taught in many places including Detroit, Grand Rapids, Okemos, Yuma, AZ and most recently in Ionia, Michigan. The majority of my teaching experience has been teaching high school Earth Science. I did spend a short time as an administrator and athletic director while in Grand Rapids.\n\nAthletics have always been a big part of my life. I played baseball, basketball and ran cross country in high school. In my different stops, I've coached all levels from middle school to varsity and coached baseball, softball, boys and girls basketball and most recently girls soccer at Ionia.\n\nOutside of work, I love hanging out with my two sons. I also enjoy playing basketball and watching most sports. I spend some time playing video and board games. I love watching sci-fi and mystery movies and tv shows.\n\nAcademic Success Coach\n\nDuane Portee is a native of Lansing, MI. He began his post-secondary education at Lansing Community College where he earned an Associate's Degree in Media Technology. After years of starting and growing a family, he later resumed his education and earned a Bachelor's degree from Siena Heights University.\n\nOver the last 11 years he has worked for 3 non-profit agencies at Capital Area Michigan Works! He worked 3 years with New Way Inc. as a Job Developer and Case manager with the state's pilot Michigan Prisoner Reentry Initiative (MPRI) program. Over the next 5 years he was employed with Cristo Rey Community Center as an Employment Specialist under the Workforce Investment Act (WIA) program providing career assessment and guidance to Dislocated and low income workers. His last 3 years were spent working for Peckham, Inc. as a Career Coach under the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity ACT (WIOA) program assisting Dislocated and low income workers with training for careers in high demand occupations. During his years at Michigan Works! he completed a variety of human services trainings including Global Career Development Facilitator training.\n\nIn his spare time he likes to be with family and friends. He enjoys music, exercise and traveling to experience unique restaurants.\n\nAcademic Success Coach\n\nI grew up in the small, rural town of Breckenridge, Michigan where I was active in sports, student counsel and the FFA. I graduated from Central Michigan University, with a Bachelor's degree in Family Studies and a minor in Leadership. In college, I was active across campus especially with the Leadership Institute and as a First Year Experience mentor.\n\nHigh school always came easy to me, so when I wasn't doing well in college, it came as quite a shock. It took me losing an academic scholarship to realize I needed to make a change. Fortunately, I figured out how to manage time, study and take care of my mental health in order to graduate.\n\nAfter college, I became a Foster Care and Adoption worker for Catholic Charities West Michigan and then the State of Michigan. In 2016, I came to LCC looking for a new way to help people in the community. After working in various roles at the college, I'm very excited to be serving students as an Academic Success Coach. I hope to help guide you and become a resource I wish I had during my time in college.\n\nIn my spare time I love being with my family, needlepoint, baking and long distance running – the longest being a 25k, so far. I married my college sweetheart and we have two daughters together, Sloane and Colette. You can find me outside of work on long walks with my family, stopping at each sewer drain to check for ninja turtles.\n\nAcademic Success Coach\n\nHi, I'm Jayde! I'm from Saginaw, Michigan (or Saginawesome). As a first-generation, low-income student, navigating the college process was hard! I knew I had to do it but not how to do it. I started at a private university, had a pit stop at the local community college where I was a work-study student, and attended 2 universities before graduating with a Bachelor of Arts in Communication from Saginaw Valley State University. I changed my major multiple times, took semesters off, had family responsibilities, and needed to work while also going to school. We all have our journey and mine definitely had some ups and downs. As an Academic Success Coach, I'm excited to join you on your adventure!\n\nAfter SVSU, I had the privilege of joining AdviseMI, an AmeriCorps program, where I served as a College Advisor in Taylor, Michigan. I assisted high schoolers in exploring different career pathways, completing personality tests, college applications, FAFSAs, verifications, scholarships, planning college visits; you name it, I worked with a student on it! Once I completed my two years of service as a College Advisor, I found myself still yearning to help students overcome barriers and gain access to post-secondary credentials. I joined the Admissions and Recruitment team at Henry Ford College. I graduated from Oakland University during the great COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 with my M.Ed. in Higher Education Leadership. My next goal is a second masters by 30!\n\nI enjoy trying “foodie” places even though I'm a picky eater, traveling to new (and old) places, spending time with my people, bingeing Hulu or Netflix shows, and getting in the sun whenever possible! I take the “try everything at least once” approach pretty seriously. You'll always find me sipping coffee through a metal straw (Save the Turtles – and your teeth!!).\n\nAcademic Success Coach\n\nHi! My name is Andrea Tarry, I am so excited to be an Academic Success Coach! After graduating from high school, my college path took me through three different colleges, including LCC, where I transferred three times and then ended up graduating from the first college I started at, MSU, with a BA in Communications! I have worked in higher education since 2005 starting as a grad student in Photography at KCAD. I then worked at an art school in Chicago for 7 years, and since 2015 have been at LCC, including over 5 years working with our H.O.P.E./Promise scholarship students and high school dual enrolled students. I also started teaching here in 2019! I am so grateful for all the experience I have gained over these last 17 years, as now, I get to help you navigate your education. “Doing” college is hard work, can be confusing and frustrating, but I can guarantee you, it is full of amazing rewards! I became a Success Coach because I want to offer the support and guidance that I didn't have when I was in your shoes. I am here to support you through it! In my personal time, I can be found watching true-crime shows with my hubby, tending to my gardens and house plants, snuggling with my ginger/white tabby cat, Kitty Cat, spending time with my family and friends, listening to audio-books, or doing anything outside like camping, hiking, snow-blowing, snoozing in my hammock, kayaking, or swimming in one of our many great or inland lakes!\n\nAcademic Success Coach\n\nClick to schedule into my calendar.\n\nMy name is Frank Taylor and I am delighted to be working with you as an Academic Success Coach. I was born and raised in west Michigan and grew up as a farm boy. I moved to Lansing, attended MSU and received a Bachelor's degree in Psychology in 1985. Both during and after receiving my degree I spent time working with persons with disabilities at the local Community Mental Health here in Lansing and volunteering at a local crisis hotline.\n\nI returned to MSU and completed a Master's degree in Rehabilitation Counseling, specializing in using counseling skills to work with persons with disabilities to help them identify and reach life goals like college education, employment and living with dignity in their chosen community. I graduated with a Master's degree in 1991.\n\nFor the next 20 years, I continued to work with persons with disabilities in the Lansing area, helping people identify supports in the community and making sure they were able to successfully use those supports to meet their personal goals. In 2012 I began to teaching graduate level classes at Texas Tech University in their Rehabilitation Counseling Master's program. Through distance learning, I helped students learn about medical aspects of disability, assessment, and counseling skills to help others as professional counselors.\n\nSince coming to LCC as an Academic Success Coach, I have specialized somewhat with working with students with both visible and hidden disabilities, working with the College, faculty, other staff and the Center for Student Access to ensure that all students have full access to all of the experiences and opportunities offered by LCC.\n\nMy passion is helping individuals find clear goals and linking them with the resources they need to be successful. I believe every person can be successful if given an equitable chance to realize their dreams and goals. My job as an Academic Success Coach is to ensure you have the supports to ensure you have that equitable opportunity to succeed.\n\nIn my off time, you will find me puttering around his house or building and troubleshooting computers. I also like to read books and hang out in our RV in some of the beautiful state parks here in Michigan and elsewhere.\n\nAcademic Success Coach\n\nHello. I was born in Phnom Penh, Cambodia.

Over a number of years that presented joy, opportunities for many new discoveries and much learning, and of course, challenges, I earned an Associate Degree from Lansing Community College. I then transferred to Michigan State University and studied at James Madison College. I graduated from MSU in 2005 with a bachelor's degree in International Relations.\n\nWhile attending LCC, I worked as student staff at various departments such as Student Affairs Dean's Office, Counseling and Advising Center, and then at the Writing Center. When I was a student at Michigan State University, I worked at the MSU Writing Center as their undergraduate writing consultant.\n\nI enjoy working with students and customers from a variety of backgrounds. I worked as Consular Assistant at the United Kingdom Embassy in Cambodia, bank Relationship Manager for ANZ Royal Bank, and Professional Tutor at LCC Learning Commons where I mentored and coached a diverse student population. It is my honor to work as an Academic Success Coach to serve and provide vital support to students at LCC.\n\nOutside of work, I enjoy cooking, traveling and spending my time with friends and my American host family. I also have a pet cat named Princess that I love very much.\n\n\"Travel is fatal to prejudice, bigotry, and narrow-mindedness, and many of our people need it sorely on these accounts. Broad, wholesome, charitable views of men and things cannot be acquired by vegetating in one little corner of the earth all one's lifetime\" (Mark Twain).\n\nAcademic Success Coach\n\nDominique is a native of south Lansing, MI. A proud product of the Lansing School district; where I took part in extracurricular activities such as varsity basketball, track, and young men of excellence program.

After graduating from LCC, I transferred to Siena Heights University to complete a 3+1 program where I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Professional Communications.\n\nPrior to becoming a Success Coach, I was a Career Services coordinator with Career Quest Learning Centers where I helped students develop soft skills with an emphasis on preparing them for career opportunities. While also building relationships with organizations within the community for employment opportunities for students. In 2018, I returned to LCC as a support staff in the role of a Enrollment Support Specialists where I assisted students with a variety of student account related inquires.
