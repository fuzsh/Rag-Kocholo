Her father is believed to have died before 1850, because she, along with her mother and two siblings, were living in the home of her grandparents by that year.[1] [2] In 1870, Mary and her mother were living in the home of her sister, Isabella, and brother-in-law, Reese Sullivan.[3]\n\nThe family used several different spellings of their surname. Her parents' marriage record uses Faulkenberry/Faulkenberg. After her father's death, it is written Faulkenby, Fortonbury, Falambury, and Fortenberry on the different census records and Mary's own marriage record.\n\nMary married William Gannon, son of Samuel Gannon and Susannah Stacy, as his second wife, in 1875.[4] The couple had five known children:[5] [6]\n\n1878: Margrett S, no recorded marriage, probably died young\n\n1880-1969: Harriet Tennessee, m.
