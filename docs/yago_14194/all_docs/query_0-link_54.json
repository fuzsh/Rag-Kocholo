Clint is happy to see Kim again, and wants to know where she's been for a year and a half. Kim manages to avoid telling the truth, but Clint later figures out she's been stripping again. Clint then wants to know what secret Kim has been hiding from him that caused her to be blackmailed out of town and out of his life by David, but Kim doesn't divulge her secret to Clint. Clint's daughter Natalie Buchanan then arrives in Llanfair and kicks Kim out of the house.\n\nOn September 2, 2011, it's revealed that Kim is Cutter Wentworth's real sister, and that her real name is Aubrey Wentworth when Kim pays her brother Cutter a visit to The Minute Man Motel, and he calls her by her real name \"Aubrey\". It was also revealed that Kim had plastic surgery done to turn herself from an \"ugly duckling\" to a sexy looking woman, thanks to the money she stole from her former French boarding school roommate Rama Patel to pay for the plastic surgery. Kim also found out that her brother was inspired to scam the Buchanan family after he read about Kim's marriage to Clint in the newspaper. Kim told Cutter that she would pay back the money that she stole from Rama. Kim also discovered that her brother quit being a con artist so that he could turn over a new leaf to impress Aubrey, who also reformed from her grifting ways, and got a job working as a front desk clerk at The Minute Man Motel. Kim later goes to Llanfair to talk to Clint about helping her take care of her friend in the hospital. Clint agrees to help if she quits stripping, saying she is better than that, and Kim agrees to the deal. Kim later comes face to face with Cutter's girlfriend and former scamming partner Christine Karr (the fake Aubrey Wentworth) at the motel room. Kim tells Christine that she is the real Aubrey Wentworth and Cutter's sister. After Kim left, Cutter told Aubrey that he and Kim used to be scamming partners when he teamed up with her to seduce rich men for their money after Kim had her plastic surgery, but they later parted ways after they were exposed as con artists after the incident at the Spotted Pony. Kim returns to Llanfair where Clint wants Kim's friend to be moved to Llanview Hospital, but Kim refuses. Clint also look up information on Kim's friend in the hospital in Anchorage, Kentucky, but comes up with nothing. Kim later visits her brother Cutter and discovers that he bought a stuffed beaver named Morris for Aubrey as a gift that Rex's adoptive mother Roxy Balsom was selling at a flea market being held in Angel Square, and that Rex's gun was hidden in the beaver (Rex was the suspect in the murder of Victor Lord Jr., and his gun was considered as evidence in the case) Cutter told Kim that he was tempted to use Rex's gun to blackmail him for the Buchanan fortune, but later changed his mind so that he could still be a changed man for Aubrey. Kim sneaks back into his motel room and steals the gun to blackmail Rex's biological mother Echo DiSavoy to convince her son to hand back the entire Buchanan fortune to Clint, so she can pay her friends medical bills or she will give the gun to the police.\n\nIn late September 2011, Rex find the hospital that her friend is at in Kentucky. Kim gets Rex to leave and returns to the hospital room and says \"That was a close one, Stacy!\". Cutter arrives in the hospital in Kentucky to confront Kim about stealing Rex's gun from him, but Kim convinces her brother to let her still keep the gun to continue to blackmail Echo to convince her son Rex to give back the entire Buchanan fortune to Clint, and to help pay for Stacy's medical bills. Cutter then goes into Stacy's hospital room and tells Kim she left out a lot of details about her mysterious condition. Cutter decides to keep Stacy's condition a secret, saying that no one will believe him when he tells anyone about what happened to Stacy. On October 10, 2011, Kim tells Stacy she got Echo to forge Rex's signature on the documents that Echo signed herself to give the Buchanan fortune back to Clint. It's also revealed that Stacy has Gigi's face when Kim reminicesd about Stacy reuniting with Kim several months earlier at the Spotted Pony, and Kim finding out that Stacy survived drowning in that frozen lake, and that Stacy had plastic surgery done to her in South America to look like her sister Gigi so that she could take over her life. Cutter then arrived at the hospital and told Kim that Aubrey broke up with him because she found out about what he really did with Rex's gun, and also blamed Kim for their break-up. He also decided to revert back to his grifting ways and blackmailed Kim to give him the forged documents, or he will tell everyone in Llanview about Stacy still being alive with Gigi's face. Cutter then asked Kim if she was sure that it was Stacy that was in that hospital room. Kim explained to Cutter that Stacy ended up in a coma because she went to Llanview to track down Gigi, but instead she ended up in the same basement of the rental house with her that was leaking carbon monoxide that killed Gigi. Kim then tracked down Stacy and took her body, and put her in a hospital in Cherryvale before she ended up in the hospital in Kentucky. Cutter told Kim that he believes her, and Kim gave him the forged documents on the condition that he gives her some of the money to pay for Stacy's hospital bills. On October 14, 2011, Kim revealed to Stacy of what happened that night several years ago at the Spotted Pony. Cutter enlisted Kim to seduce a rich guy at the club named Mr. Berger by working as a stripper, and Cutter snuck in too much \"mickey\" into his drink, which caused Mr. Berger to pass out and die. Kim runs into Rama at the Spotted Pony, who recently discovered from Aubrey that she stole money from her to pay for her plastic surgery and calling herself \"Kim\", and that she was there to \"settle the score\" once and for all! On October 17, 2011 Cutter and Rama set Kim up for the murder years ago at the Spotted Pony. Kim begs Cutter to take care of Stacy before being dragged away by the police. On October 28, a letter from Kim arrives from the prison she's staying at in Kentucky at Llanfair for Clint, but the letter ends up falling into Clint's granddaughter's Bree Brennan's bag that she's using to go trick or treating with on Halloween before Clint could see the letter. Bree later discovers the letter in her bag and dumps it on the front doorsteps of the Buchanan Mansion. Cutter then discovers Kim's letter and has it forged, along with another forged letter from Clint, to make it both look like they were breaking up with each other, and to not let anyone know about Stacy's identity, and to cover up the truth about Cutter framing Kim for the murder that he committed at the Spotted Pony.\n\nNigel Bartholomew-Smythe\n\nNigel Bartholomew-Smythe One Life to Live Portrayed by Peter Bartlett Duration 1991— First appearance 1991 Profile Occupation Butler\n\nRelationships First cousins Neville Smythe\n\nPeter Bartlett (1991–present)\n\nNigel Bartholomew-Smythe is the longtime butler and confidante of billionaire Asa Buchanan.\n\nIn early 2003, Nigel is romantically linked to Roxy Balsom.\n\nIn October 2006, David Vickers finds out that Asa once had an affair with David's mother, Emma Bradley, but Asa denies it.

Renée and Asa rekindle their romance, and marry for the first time on November 30, 1988[43] in a double wedding with Asa's grandson Cord Roberts, who remarries ex-wife Tina Lord.\n\nMobster Carlo Hesser — another of Renée's exes — appears in Chesnut Hills in 1990. Asa and Renée divorce in 1992 when Asa discovers old love letters that Carlo had sent Renée, but Asa and Renée eventually wed again on May 18, 1999.[43] Around this time it is revealed that Renée had conceived a son by Asa when they had been involved in their youth, and had put the boy up for adoption. Max Holden poses as the missing heir, but Asa and Renée's real son turns out to be Ben Davidson, adopted brother of Sam Rappaport and love interest of Asa's former daughter-in-law Viki Carpenter. Asa and Renée divorce in 2001, but remarry for the last time on February 14, 2004.[43] The marriage ends with Asa's offscreen death on August 16, 2007.\n\nRenee has been seldom seen since Asa's 2007 death, but still resides in Llanview and runs the Palace Hotel.

Eddie had been in jail in Ohio for running an illegal chop shop but told his sons that the charges hadn't stuck. Eddie had shown up in town, looking for the $50,000 that James had stolen from him earlier that year, but James and Bobby said the money was gone. Eddie threatened to have James sent to jail unless they agreed to let him stay at their apartment.\n\nWhen James began defending Inez against his father's diatribes, Eddie realized that Inez had been in contact with her sons. When Inez showed up at the apartment with Nate to deliver some food, she was shocked to see Eddie there. Eddie assumed Nate was Inez's lover, but she told him he was their son – something Eddie still doubted. Eddie lashed out at Inez for leaving him alone with two small boys, and Inez said she regretted running away but that she would protect them from his abuse now.\n\nBo paid Eddie a visit and warned him that the police would be watching him. Eddie rightly assumed that Inez had sought Bo's assistance and warned Bo that Inez was trying to get her hooks into him. Eddie followed his sons to Dorian Lord's house on Thanksgiving Day and crashed her gathering. When he was ordered to leave, Eddie went berserk, insulting Starr and punching James in the face before being physically restrained by Robert. Furious and disgusted, Dorian immediately called the police and had Eddie arrested for trespass and assault.\n\nEddie met Nora and insinuated that Bo and Inez were having an affair, and then made a crude pass at Nora. Eddie was released from police custody after a high-priced lawyer hired by Clint Buchanan got the charges dismissed. Eddie then was summoned to the Buchanan mansion, where Clint promised to pay Eddie a large sum of cash and provided him a gun. In return, Clint had Eddie kidnap Nora and send text messages from her phone to Bo, telling Bo that he should sleep with Inez to even the score over her affair years before with Sam Rappaport. Nate punched Eddie in the face after Eddie made suggestive remarks to Nate's girlfriend, Danielle. Todd Manning warned Eddie to stay away from Todd's daughter.\n\nEventually, James confronted his father at his hotel room and held him at gunpoint. Even after being egged on by Eddie, James was ultimately unable to bring himself to do so, instead warning him to leave town before someone else tried to do so. Indeed, some time after James' departure, Eddie was found shot dead in his hotel room, and it is eventually discovered that Clint murdered him to cover his tracks. However on April 1, 2011, it was revealed that Matthew Buchanan had in fact shot and killed Eddie as Clint told this to Bo and Nora.\n\nWalker Flynn\n\nWalker Flynn One Life to Live Duration 2003 First appearance 2003 Last appearance 2003 Cause/reason Fell down an elevator shaft that was sabotaged by Victor Lord Jr. Profile\n\nRelationships Sibling(s) Mitch Laurence (brother)\n\nMiles Laurence (brother)\n\nTrevor St. John (2003)\n\nWalker Flynn is the brother of Mitch Laurence and a mobster running casinos in Atlantic City and Las Vegas. After Todd Manning is beaten to near death by Mitch's followers, he is recovered by Flynn, who has Todd's face surgically altered to look like his own in order to hide from authorities.\n\nNatalie Buchanan also enters a pool tournament in Las Vegas, run by Flynn. John McBain, an FBI agent posing as one of Flynn's thugs becomes her manager, and helps her compete in the pool tournament, under the guise of trying to lure Natalie into a trap. Flynn's plans are for Natalie to make it to the final round of the tournament, and then throw the competition.\n\nBlair Cramer ends up in a relationship with the faux Walker (Victor), and after meeting the real Walker (who wears glasses, talks with a posh accent, and has a snobby demeanor), assumes that he is leading a double life of sorts. She later verbally attacks the real Walker and John in Las Vegas, and after Victor/faux Walker shows up, they cover their tracks by claiming to be twins.\n\nAs Walker's plans begin to unravel, he decides to blackmail Todd, demanding $500,000 or he will reveal the faux Walker's identity as Todd Manning(Victor Lord Jr. . Natalie defies Flynn by winning the tournament, and she is brought to Flynn's suite to be killed. After a confrontation between Walker, Todd, John (who has revealed himself to FBI), Antonio Vega, Cristian Vega, and Jessica Buchanan, Walker takes Natalie hostage. A botched rescue attempt leads to Cristian being taken by Flynn and seemingly killed (he is later revealed to be alive and in the custody of Flynn's business partner, Tico Santi, both of whom are under the employ of Carlo Hesser).\n\nFlynn returns to Llanview and disguises himself as the faux Walker. However, Todd(Victor), desperate to keep his identity secret, plots to kill Flynn. He creates a remote control that will cause the elevator in his penthouse to fall. The two lookalikes end up fighting in the elevator, and it ends up crashing. Flynn is killed in the crash, and Todd (Victor) survives.\n\nWes Granger\n\nWes Granger One Life to Live Duration 2008–09 First appearance September 25, 2008 Last appearance February 18, 2009 Cause/reason Stabbed to death by Powell Lord III Profile\n\nRelationships Romances Marty Saybrooke (2008–09)\n\nJustin Paul Kahn (September 25, 2008[44]-February 18, 2009[45])\n\nWes Granger first appears in September 2008 when Rex Balsom and Gigi Morasco contact him for information on his best friend Brody Lovett. A former Navy SEAL who had done several tours in Iraq and Afghanistan, Wes had served with Brody in Fallujah and Basra, and had witnessed the friendly fire incident in which Brody had accidentally shot and killed an Iraqi child, triggering Brody's downward spiral into Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. With Wes' help, Rex, Gigi and the Llanview police are able to track down the unstable Brody, who has made off with Gigi's young son Shane. After Brody is committed to St. Ann's Sanitarium for treatment, Wes comes to Llanview and becomes a frequent visitor during Brody's convalescence. As Brody undergoes therapy, he begins to recover memories that contradict what he believes happened during the shooting in Basra. Though Wes urges him not to delve deeper into the mystery, Brody continues treatment and Wes ultimately admits that the Iraqi boy had been unarmed, and Wes had planted a weapon on him to protect Brody.\n\nWes forms a friendship with the troubled amnesiac Marty Saybrooke, who has begun to behave irresponsibly as she crumbles under the pressure of other people's expectations of her. Marty stays with Wes in his hotel room in a platonic arrangement, as Marty's teen son Cole Thornhart and former love interest John McBain become concerned that she has taken up with a questionable stranger. Wes is shocked to discover that the key witness in a local trial is Lee Halpern, a woman whom he thought had been killed 20 years before. Con artist Lee had seduced Wes' father and swindled him, leaving the Grangers penniless and fatherless. Wes is hungry for revenge, and when Lee is later found stabbed to death, John discovers her connection to Wes and suspects him of the crime. Wes maintains his innocence, but after a heated argument with Marty even she is unsure whether or not to believe him. Falling asleep next to Wes drunk, Marty wakes up on February 16, 2009 to find him stabbed to death in the bed next to her in a manner similar to Lee's death.[46] With no memory of the night before and covered in his blood, Marty is arrested for Wes' murder when her fingerprints are found on the knife.[47] Powell Lord III later confesses to the murder (among others), committed as part of his plan to punish anyone who has hurt Marty, frame Todd, and then punish him by killing him and anyone he loves.[48]\n\nIn 2011, Jessica Buchanan, who met Wes a few times during her stay in St. Ann's, developed an alternate personality based on memories of him and stories she heard from Brody. Unlike Jessica's other alters, \"Wes\" seems to believe that \"he\" actually is Wes Granger rather than a part of Jessica's psyche.\n\nLee Halpern\n\nLee Halpern One Life to Live Portrayed by Janet Zarish Duration 1987–88, 2008–09 First appearance 1987 Last appearance February 3, 2009 Cause/reason Stabbed to death by Powell Lord III Profile Aliases Janet Ketring\n\nCarol Harper Dennison\n\nRelationships Spouse(s) Charles Sanders\n\nTom Dennison Children Mary Lynn Dennison\n\nJanet Zarish (1987–88;[49] April 2, 2008[50]-November 11, 2008;[51][52] January 9, 2009[53]-February 3, 2009[54])\n\nLee Halpern, a former prostitute for Renee Divine and now a business partner of Max Holden's, arrives in Llanview in 1987.[49] She marries Charles Sanders, former US Ambassador to the European principality of Mendorra, during a drunken night in Las Vegas, and he dies of a heart attack on their wedding night. Lee manages to torment Charles' wealthy mother Elizabeth Sanders more than even his first wife, Judith. It is soon revealed that Lee is in fact Carol Harper Dennison, the presumed-dead wife of Llanview resident Tom Dennison and mother to Tom's daughter, Mari Lynn; Tom is the twin brother of Joe Riley, first husband of Llanview society figure Viki Buchanan. The revelation of Carol's past as a prostitute had ended her marriage to Tom, and she had subsequently chosen to fake her death. Lee's awkward reunion with her daughter is cut short when it appears that Lee is accidentally shot to death by Mari Lynn in 1988.[49][55]\n\nIn April 2008, private nurse Janet Ketring appears in Llanview,[50] helping Lee Ramsey care for a bedridden and amnesiac Marty Saybrooke. Ramsey is killed and Todd Manning secretly takes custody of Marty, whom all of Llanview believes had been killed in an explosion in December 2007. Todd coerces Janet, who is only concerned for Marty's well-being, to continue tending to Marty under his employ. For the sum of $1 million, Janet also agrees to keep Marty's existence a secret from the people, according to Todd, who wish to harm Marty. Neither Marty nor Janet are aware that Todd had raped Marty over a decade before; though Todd had served time and Marty had overcome the trauma, their relationship before the explosion had been far from intimate. Seeking absolution for his crimes against Marty (and an escape from his troubled life) at any cost, Todd lies about their relationship and even the existence of Marty's son; both Marty and Janet come to trust Todd and his warnings about the danger to Marty's life. During a personal conversation with Todd about their families, Janet reveals that, like him, she is estranged from her loved ones — in particular, a daughter — and claims she is \"dead to them.\" Todd shows Janet a picture of his sister, local society figure Viki Davidson; Janet becomes anxious, soon explaining that she merely recognizes Viki from the newspaper. During his investigation of his nemesis Todd in October 2008, Llanview Police Detective John McBain discovers that Janet is, in fact, a very-much-alive Lee Halpern. He uses this information to try to pressure Janet into revealing that her mystery patient is, as he now suspects, the presumed-dead Marty.[56] Janet is horrified to hear from John that Todd had raped Marty and is keeping her from her son. Janet confronts Todd, who also knows her true identity and threatens to expose her unless she continues to keep his secret. He soon forces her to assist him in his intended kidnapping of his unborn grandchild. Todd calls off the plan, but his mentally ill niece Jessica Buchanan switches her own stillborn baby girl with the newborn daughter of Todd's daughter Starr Manning.[57][58] With Starr's baby believed dead, Janet leaves Llanview on November 11, 2008,[51][52] but reappears on old friend Renee Buchanan's doorstep on January 9, 2009, desperate for sanctuary.[53] Janet fears prosecution and also Todd's wrath, but soon agrees to cooperate with the authorities to punish Todd for his crimes. Todd catches on to her attempt to get him to incriminate himself while she is wearing a wire, but Janet is kept in protective custody awaiting her testimony against him. On the advice of Todd's lawyer (and ex-wife) Téa Delgado, Todd publishes an exposé on Janet in his newspaper, The Sun, to sabotage her credibility. Terrified that one of the many people she has conned in the past will come after her now that it is public knowledge she is alive, Janet escapes police custody.[59] Todd discovers Janet stabbed to death on his living room floor on January 30, 2009.[59] Believing that Todd is innocent but realizing that he would be blamed, Téa confesses to the police that she had stabbed Janet in self-defense, and Janet's body is taken away.[54] Powell Lord III later confesses to the murder (among others), committed as part of his plan to punish anyone who has hurt Marty, frame Todd, and then punish him by killing him and anyone he loves.[48]\n\nKirk Harmon\n\nKirk Harmon One Life to Live Portrayed by Randolph Mantooth Duration 2007 First appearance May 21, 2007 Last appearance July 10, 2007 Cause/reason Killed by his son's group.

Just when it seems that Kirk is the anti-semitic and racist arsonist who has been terrorizing the city, Kirk confronts Tate, who is the real killer. Kirk takes the blame for Tate's crimes to protect his son, but when he realizes that Tate will not stop his misguided crusade, Kirk decides to tell the truth to the police. Before he has the chance, Kirk is killed in prison by a member of Tate's white supremacist group \"One Pure People.\"\n\nTate Harmon\n\nChris Beetem (February 8, 2007 – August 9, 2007)\n\nTate Harmon is a young professional baseball player, well-known and recently retired. An anti-drug lecturer, Tate comes to Llanview in February 2007 and speaks out against steroid use at Llanview High School. He is soon hired by entrepreneurs Adriana Cramer and Layla Williamson to be the model for their new men's underwear line. Tate's romantic interest in Adriana invites the ire of her boyfriend, Rex Balsom. On April 23, 2007, Tate is a guest on the daytime talk show The View and declares his love for Adriana in a \"Tom Cruise-like\" couch incident. After meeting Tate's ex-wife, who claims their marriage ended due to \"fraud\" on Tate's part, Rex outs Tate as gay on local television; the story is soon picked up nationwide.\n\nRex's assertion is soon proven untrue, but Tate hides another secret: he is a member of the white supremacist group \"One Pure People.\" Using half-Latin Adriana as a cover, Tate has been participating in OPP's recent anti-semitic and racially motivated arsons in Llanview. Tate's father Kirk Harmon comes to town and soon takes the blame for the crimes to protect his son, but when Kirk realizes that Tate will not stop his misguided crusade, Kirk decides to tell the truth to the police. Before he has the chance, Kirk is killed in prison by an OPP member, but Rex, Adriana and the police ultimately deduce that Tate is the culprit. In a macabre endgame, Tate traps Adriana, Layla, and Vincent Jones on a rooftop, intending to kill them for their racial \"impurity.\" Rex arrives, and Tate convinces Adriana to jump off of the roof to spare the lives of her friends. Tipped off to Tate's whereabouts, Officer Talia Sahid shoots and arrests him before Adriana jumps or anyone else is harmed. Tate is convicted for his crimes and is sent to Statesville Prison on August 9, 2007; to his dismay, his cellmate is an African American named Luther.\n\nStephen Haver\n\nDr. Stephen Haver One Life to Live Portrayed by Matthew Ashford Duration 2003–04 First appearance December 10, 2003 Last appearance March 22, 2004 Profile Aliases Love Child Killer\n\nWhite Rose Killer\n\nMusic Box Killer Occupation Psychology Professor at Llanview University\n\nRelationships\n\nMatthew Ashford (December 10, 2003 – March 22, 2004)\n\nDr. Stephen Haver is a psychology professor at Llanview University who specializes in human sexuality and researches serial killers and sexual predators. He becomes a favorite instructor of Jessica Buchanan. When a friend confides in Jessica that another professor had demanded sex from her in return for a passing grade, Jessica recruits Dr. Haver, his colleague, psychiatrist Rae Cummings, and student activist and radio talk show host Marcie Walsh to help her expose the scandal. When the serial killer known as the \"Music Box Killer\" begins terrorizing the university, Jessica and Dr. Haver find themselves at the center of the investigation, with Haver and Rae Cummings acting as consultants and psychological profilers for the Llanview Police Department. Haver works closely with new Chief of Detectives John McBain, but no one is aware that Haver and the \"Music Box Killer\" are actually one and the same, and that Haver had been responsible for the death of McBain's fiancée years before.\n\nThe Music Box Killer strangles his victims with a red leotard, paints a teardrop on their faces, and leaves a music box by their bodies as a calling card. He sometimes targets women at random, such as private investigator Elyssa Collins or sorority girl Madison Kensington, but seems to focus on women who are either older and maternal, or promiscuous and involved in sex work, like Jennifer Rappaport or her friend Karen, a local prostitute. In reality, Haver is murdering women who he identifies with his mother, a promiscuous, alcoholic dancer and folk singer from the \"free love\" era of the 1960s. For a time, Haver uses psychotic mental patient Troy MacIver as his alibi; as MacIver's therapist at St. Ann's Sanitarium, Haver releases the man from the institution at the times when he plans to kill. As the authorities get closer, Haver kills Police Commissioner Bo Buchanan's girlfriend Gabrielle Medina, and nearly kills Sarah Roberts. Meanwhile, John McBain grows increasingly suspicious of Haver, who becomes his prime suspect in the case. Jessica, Haver's protege, angrily defends her teacher to McBain, but when she stumbles upon the truth, Haver is forced to take action. He kidnaps Jessica, and brainwashes her with drugs and hypnosis to conceal his crimes and conspire with him against the police. In the meantime, Rae Cummings also deduces Haver's secret; he takes her hostage, forcing her to act out his twisted psychological ritual of posing as his mother before apparently strangling her and then immolating her isolated prison.\n\nThe LPD discovers Jessica's brainwashing and rehabilitates her, but they still have no actionable proof of Haver's guilt. As John McBain digs deeper into Haver's past, he discovers that Haver has actually posed as many serial killers in many different parts of the United States, changing methodology and modus operandi each time to avoid detection. John is shocked to learn that Haver was once the \"White Rose Killer,\" who he had hunted unsuccessfully during his tenure with the FBI; as the \"White Rose Killer,\" Haver had murdered McBain's fiancée Caitlin Fitzgerald in her bed while she slept beside him.\n\nTrapped and growing desperate, Haver abducts Jessica's sister Natalie Buchanan, who John has become romantically linked to. In a stand-off with police, Haver straps a bomb to Natalie's body and threatens to kill her. Haver is shocked as Rae Cummings suddenly enters the room — she had survived his assault, and has been kept in police protection. Taunting Haver with the memory of his mother, the focus of his psychosis, Rae manages to distract Haver long enough for the police to subdue him.\n\nWhile behind bars and awaiting trial, Haver is shot and killed by a rogue cop. It is revealed that Haver brainwashed the cop to shoot him and then commit suicide, in the hopes of framing John for Haver's \"murder\" (the cop implicated John as an accomplice in his suicide note); his plan does not succeed.\n\nMel Hayes\n\nStephen Markle (April 1997 to January 1999;[60][61] July 21 and 22, 2008;[62][63][64][65] January 7 and 8, 2010;[66][67] February 8, 2010[68])\n\nMelvin \"Mel\" Hayes is a prize-winning journalist and \"loose cannon\" who crosses paths with Dorian Lord in April 1997.[60][61] Drunk in a Washington, D.C. hotel bar, Mel literally \"falls\" over Dorian, and their mutual attraction soon sparks a relationship. Dorian convinces Mel to seek a job at Llanview's newspaper, The Banner, and he moves into a houseboat on the Llantano River. The death of Mel's wife Muriel in a plane crash 18 months before had fueled his addiction to alcohol, which in turn has estranged him from their children, Roger, Frank, and Dorothy Hayes.[61] Dorothy comes to Llanview in 1997 to rebuild her relationship with Mel, but leaves in 1998 after a failed relationship with Joey Buchanan. Mel and Dorian's family begin to suspect that Dorian is hiding something from her past; after Mel's investigation into the deaths of Dorian's parents reveals conflicting information, he convinces her to face her painful childhood. Dorian returns to Canton in 1998, remembering the psychological abuse she and her sisters had suffered at the hands of their mentally ill mother, Sonya. Dorian is shocked to discover that Sonya had not only killed Dorian's father, but is actually still alive and being cared for by the former Cramer nanny, Charlotte Stonecliffe. Dorian and her daughter Cassie are attacked by a deranged Sonya, who later dies with Charlotte when the house is consumed by fire. Furious that he had dredged up her past, Dorian breaks things off with Mel.\n\nA near-death experience after Dorian is accidentally shot changes her mind. Dorian proposes to Mel suddenly at The Banner in May 1998; they marry in an impromptu wedding in the middle of the newspaper's city room.[61] All ends badly in January 1999 when Viki Carpenter — Mel's boss and Dorian's longtime nemesis — is on a plane with Mel and inadvertently intercepts a note from Dorian telling Mel to come home. Viki gets off the plane instead, and it crashes; Mel is killed and Dorian blames Viki.[61] Psychic Madame Delphina later channels Mel's spirit, who advises Dorian to make peace with Viki and give up her vendetta. Feeling a great sense of peace, Dorian finally accepts Mel's death, and lets go of her animosity toward Viki over the crash.\n\nMel appears to Dorian as a ghost on July 21 and 22, 2008 (One Life to Live's 40th Anniversary episodes)[62][63] as Dorian grapples with whether or not to try to save Viki's life after a car crash. His words ultimately get through to Dorian, who manages to revive Viki.[64][65] Subsequently in 2008 and 2009, a young woman named \"Mel\" (Tia Dionne Hodge) — whom Dorian comes to believe is either her Mel in another form or sent by him — appears in various guises whenever Dorian behaves less than ethically, speaking to Dorian's conscience with advice and warnings.[69][70][71][72][73]\n\nMel reappears to Dorian on January 7 and 8, 2010, as new Llanview Mayor Dorian gives in to Mitch Laurence's threats against her family and fires Police Commissioner Bo Buchanan at Mitch's command.[66][67] Mel returns on February 8, 2010, to convince Dorian to stop Charlie Banks from going through with his and Dorian's plan to kill Mitch.[68]\n\nHugh Hughes\n\nJosh Casaubon (July 18, 2005 – September 21, 2006)\n\nHugh Hughes One Life to Live Portrayed by Josh Casaubon Duration 2005–06 First appearance July 18, 2005 Last appearance September 21, 2006 Profile Occupation Former Assistant District Attorney Llantano County\n\nFormer Temp.

Not long after his arrival, Hugh is out with one of the many leggy models he often has on his arm and runs into Marcie Walsh, who is being ridiculed by other writers after her novel The Killing Club had been played out by a serial killer. He gives up his evening to take the drunken Marcie home, where she throws up on his shoes. This begins an unusual friendship between the playboy Hugh and writer Marcie, much to the annoyance of her ex-boyfriend Dr. Michael McBain.\n\nHugh is soon thrown into the seat of district attorney as Nora Hanen is hospitalized. His first big case is the trial of Todd Manning for the murder of pregnant Margaret Cochran. Hugh is determined to see Todd pay for his crimes, in part because Hugh himself had been adopted and he cannot rationalize to himself why anyone would want to kill a child. His belief in Todd's guilt never wavers, and he feels that justice is truly served when Todd is convicted. When it is discovered that Todd had been innocent, Hugh immediately apologizes to him for having been the one to put him in prison, even though he had been only following the trail of the evidence.\n\nHugh then discovers that doctors Spencer Truman and Paige Miller are his biological parents; Paige had put him up for adoption without telling the evil Spencer that she was pregnant. At Spencer's bail hearing for Margaret Cochran's murder, it appears that Hugh wants Spencer to go free when he agrees to offer him a $1 million bail. However, he and Detective John McBain had planned it in the hopes that Truman would lead them to the gun that he used to kill John's father, Thomas McBain.\n\nHugh is killed on September 22, 2006 in a car accident, but in a case of mistaken identity he is thought to have survived and been bandaged for his burns. In reality, it is John McBain (who had also been in the accident) under the bandages while Hugh is buried in what everyone thought was John's grave.\n\nBritney Jennings\n\nKatrina Bowden (September 26, 2006 and October 4, 2006)\n\nPortia Reiners (October 10, 2006 – October 17, 2007)\n\nBritney Jennings One Life to Live Portrayed by Katrina Bowden (September 26, 2006 – October 4, 2006)\n\nPortia Reiners (October 10, 2006 – October 17, 2007) Duration 2006–07 First appearance September 26, 2006 Last appearance October 17, 2007 Cause/reason Moved to Massachusetts to attend boarding school.

Britney's attitude toward Starr worsens when Britney sets her sights on football player Cole, who himself is developing feelings for Starr after coming to her rescue at a dance. Trying everything to thwart Starr and Cole's new relationship, Britney discovers that Cole had been pressured into taking steroids, and uses it to her advantage. Britney spikes Cole's drink, which pushes him into a fit of \"roid rage\" during which he attacks Starr. Britney, posing as Starr, calls the police. In the aftermath, it is revealed that Cole's parents are Marty Saybrooke and the deceased Patrick Thornhart, both enemies of Starr's father Todd. Todd had raped Marty years before, and Starr's mother Blair Cramer had been romantically involved with Patrick between her marriages to Todd.\n\nStarr forgives Cole but her parents forbid her to date him. They secretly see each other, much to Britney's dismay, and Britney does all she can to split them up. Cole and Starr attend a school ski trip, each telling their parents that the other is not there. Todd, Blair, and Marty arrive coincidentally and the lodge is snowed in; Britney orchestrates the reveal that Starr and Cole have spent the night together, nearly having sex. Starr and Cole run away together, but are soon caught and forced to break up.\n\nTeacher Marcie McBain coerces several students to participate in the school musical, including Britney, Starr, and Cole. Though at first trying to follow their parents' orders and stay apart, Starr and Cole are soon drawn back together. Meanwhile, Britney uses fellow school student Henry Mackler to do her homework for her, falsely leading him to believe that she would date him. Henry begins to see that Britney is deceiving him, and a worried Starr and Langston encourage him to cut himself loose from Britney. Henry has been secretly taking pills to stay awake to do both his and Britney's homework; after not having slept for two weeks, a distraught Henry steals a car. Starr, Cole, and Britney get inside and Henry drives off; acting strangely, Henry has chest pains and his vision blurs. Henry confronts Britney, but Cole manages to get Henry to drive back to school. However, when they arrive to find the police in the parking lot, Henry panics and drives the car into a tree. Starr, Cole, and Britney are unharmed, but Henry — not wearing a seatbelt — is thrown from the car to his death. Starr and Langston place blame on Britney for pushing Henry to this extreme; Britney begins to see that she had wronged Henry, and feels responsible for his death.\n\nBritney seems to turn over a new leaf, dropping her vendetta against Starr. But after Cole leaves her at the prom to be with Starr, Britney reverts to her old ways. With Todd missing, Blair decides to allow Starr and Cole, obviously devoted to each other, to date. Soon Britney learns that Cole is lying to Starr about her father's whereabouts; Cole's new stepfather Miles Laurence is holding Todd captive, but Cole is keeping quiet to keep Miles from telling the authorities that Marty had supposedly murdered Spencer Truman.

Todd had discovered that as a teen, a drug-addicted Schuyler had stolen drugs from Llanview Hospital, and that Dr. Joplin had covered it up.[79][80] Though disgusted by Todd's intentions and guilt-ridden over the plot, Dr. Joplin capitulates to Todd's demands (after failing to convince him to change his mind) in order to protect her career. However, the infant is switched at birth with Jessica Buchanan's daughter, who had been stillborn due to Rh disease.[57][58] Thinking she had failed to diagnose the easily treated syndrome and caused the newborn's death, Dr. Joplin shoots herself in her office and dies on December 4, 2008.[81][82]\n\nIn March 2009, a distraught Starr kisses Schuyler in the school hallway. She later tries to seduce him, and her ex-boyfriend Cole Thornhart becomes convinced that Schuyler is the one trying to seduce his underage student; Cole reports the incident, and Schuyler is suspended from his teaching position. Schuyler's ex-girlfriend Stacy Morasco comes to town, and he stumbles upon her plot to steal her sister Gigi's boyfriend Rex Balsom through blackmail. Stacy forces Gigi to break up with Rex, and in June 2009 Schuyler helps Gigi turn the tables on Stacy. He soon develops feelings for Gigi but refuses to tell her; when he finally does, he and Gigi grow closer. Rex and Gigi reunite, but their relationship falls apart when Stacy is revealed to be pregnant after sleeping with Rex while he and Gigi were separated. Gigi is drawn to Schuyler, and they begin a relationship; meanwhile, Schuyler determines that he is actually the father of Stacy's baby, but Stacy convinces him to keep the secret so that Gigi will not reunite with Rex. Rex learns that he is not the baby's father just as Stacy gives birth to Sierra Morasco. Stacy apparently dies soon after (she seemed to drown, but her body was never recovered); Gigi breaks up with Schuyler for keeping the secret, and states her intention to challenge him for custody of Sierra.\n\nIn spring 2010, Allison Perkins shows up as a house inspector and a volunteer from child services at Schuyler's apartment and later points a gun at Schuyler and then kidnaps Sierra. Later Schuyler goes to Statesville prison and helps Mitch Laurence escape. Meanwhile Allison shows up at Foxy Roxy's hair salon and then holds Roxy Balsom and Natalie Buchanan at gunpoint. Allison then takes Roxy and baby Sierra back to Kyle Lewis and Oliver Fish`s apartment and holds them hostage there. Then Mitch calls Allison and tells her to come down to Statesville prison and bring Sierra with her. In the medical room Schuyler gives Mitch a drug that will make his heart stop and hopes that he will die. Later Allison shows up with the baby and reveals that Mitch and Roxy are Schuyler's real parents, making Jessica Buchanan his biological paternal half-sister, Walker Laurence and Miles Laurence his uncles, and Jessica's daughters Megan Buchanan (deceased), Bree Brennan, Chloe Brennan (deceased), and later her son Ryder Ford are his nieces and nephew. Years earlier, Allison had switched infants Schuyler and Rex, who is not their son after all, and tried to convince Roxy that the baby she'd given birth to had died the night he was born, while she gave Schuyler to her sister, Dr. Leah Joplin, who could not conceive children of her own.\n\nLater, Schuyler takes Allison's gun and holds Gigi at gunpoint at Viki Buchanan`s cabin and tries to force Gigi to sleep with him. He once more says that he wants Gigi back in his life but Rex and the police find them. He attempts to shoot Rex, blaming him for all his problems, but ends up shooting police commissioner Bo Buchanan, who is badly wounded and taken to the hospital for surgery. Brody Lovett arrests Schuyler and takes him to the police station. His lawyer Téa Delgado comes and is told what happened. Then Roxy shows up and tells him that she knows the truth as well as he does. Everyone eventually accepts the truth and Schuyler finds out that Sierra is not his daughter, she is Oliver's child as confirmed by a DNA test which Schuyler also accepts. On April 9, 2010, Schuyler appears in court and confesses to the judge, who sends him to Statesville prison where he is to await sentencing. As he is led away, Schuyler tells Rex that \"I never had a chance with her (Gigi).\"\n\nRebecca Lewis\n\nReiko Aylesworth (1993–1994)[42]\n\nJessica Kaye (May 1, 2009[83]-May 20, 2009[84])\n\nIn 1993 Rebecca Lewis, follower of the Tabernacle of Joy ministry, meets and falls for Todd Manning, who is incarcerated for the rape of Marty Saybrooke.

Roberts en route back to prison. Rebecca and Powell become engaged as a serial rapist begins terrorizing Llanview; Todd is the obvious suspect.

Sometimes it's great when the audience hates a character. It keeps them involved and we certainly don't want to make them mad, but some people, you just don't like and yet they're in your world and they do tend to cause some excitement, so that's not a bad thing. It was storyline-dictated and it was time to help propel all of the other characters into major story.\"[96] In the same article, Soap Opera Digest noted that the character of Stacy had \"never clicked with viewers and critics.\"[96]\n\nStorylines\n\nThe character is first seen on February 6, 2009 as a Las Vegas stripper named \"Gigi.\" She begins spying on Rex Balsom and Gigi Morasco, and later follows them back to Llanview.[97][98] The dancer is revealed to be Gigi's younger sister Stacy Morasco.

Gigi also begins to suspect that her sister is trying to seduce Rex. After Shane is diagnosed with leukemia in March 2009, Stacy learns of a matching donor. Wanting Rex for herself, she pretends that she is the match and forces Gigi to break up with Rex in exchange for her blood. Shane receives the transplant and improves, but Gigi is afraid to reveal Stacy's blackmail in case Shane needs more of her stem cells. Eventually, Gigi tells the truth, but in the meantime Stacy and Rex have slept together. Rex and Gigi reunite as Stacy's blackmail is revealed. Rex spurns Stacy, but she discovers that she is pregnant; she miscarries after an argument with Gigi. Stacy keeps the truth from Rex knowing that it is her only hold over him. Stacy calls her stripper best friend Kimberly Andrews to come to llanview. Kim comes up with a plan to help get Stacy pregnant again to pass the baby off as Rex's. She drugs ex-boyfriend Schuyler Joplin and attempts to sleep with him, but he refuses her. She only becomes pregnant again after seducing a drunken Oliver Fish. In November 2009 Schuyler find out that Stacy lost her baby with Rex. Kim thuinking on her toes tells Schuyler that he is the baby's father. Schuyler agrees to keep the truth from Rex so that he can have Gigi for himself. In January 2010 Rex's crazed biological father Mitch Laurence tries to kidnap stacy to raise her baby as his heir. Kim and Stacy tells Schuyler to steal a drug called oxytocin so Stacy can give birth a month before her due date to pass the baby as Rex's. On February 2, 2010 Stacy is kidnaped by Mitch Laurence so he can raise her baby as his heir; when she reveals that the baby is not Rex's, Mitch abandons Stacy in a blizzard. Gigi finds her, takes her to a cabin, and on February 11, 2010 helps Stacy deliver a baby girl she names Sierra Rose.[100] On February 16, 2010, Stacy falls through the ice of a frozen lake; despite Rex and Oliver's attempts to save her, she disappears beneath the ice and is presumed dead.[96][101][102] Kim takes off a pair of boots while grieving at the lake. Later, the boots are missing and a pair of boot footprints is seen leading away from the lake. Days later, Stacy's spirit appears to Kim several times to get Kim's assurance that she will do all she can to care for Sierra.[103][104][94]\n\nOn August 22, 2011, Kimberly, who is in Anchorage, Kentucky working as a stripper at The Spotted Pony strip club, is seen talking to a mysterious comatose woman at a hospital. Next to the mysterious woman's bed is a picture of Stacy and Kim together. Kim promises to have Stacy taken care of at the hospital before she goes back to Llanview to win back her ex-husband's Clint Buchanan's heart, and to still get her piece of the Buchanan fortune after Kim was blackmailed out of Llanview and out of her marriage to Clint a year and a half ago over a mysterious secret that David Vickers Buchanan had on Kim over what happened at The Spotted Pony several years ago. It is implied that Stacy is still alive. On September 20, 2011, Rex find the hospital that her friend is at. Kim gets Rex to leave and returns to the hospital room and says \"That was a close one, Stacy!\". On September 21, 2011, Kim's brother and former scamming partner Cutter Wentworth arrives at the hospital in Kentucky to confront Kim on stealing Rex's gun from him that he had hidden in the stuffed beaver he bought from Roxy Balsom (Cutter quit being a con artist so that she could impress his girlfriend and former scamming partner Aubrey Wentworth, who also reformed from her grifting ways. Cutter was tempted to use the gun to blackmail Rex for the Buchanan fortune, but later changed his mind so that he could still be a changed man for Aubrey, and lied to her about turning over the gun to the police). Kim told him that she wanted to use the gun to blackmail Rex's biological mother Echo DiSavoy to convince Rex to sign over the entire Buchanan fortune back to Clint that Rex extorted money from so that Clint could get Rex's finace's Gigi's heart after she died from carbon monoxide poisoning after being trapped in the basement of a rental house that was set-up by Jack Manning, who was bullying Shane in high school, when Gigi went in Shane's place to walk into a trap set-up by Jack and his friends. Kim also wanted to use some of the money to help pay Stacy's medical bills. When Cutter walked into Stacy's hospital room, he notices something different about Stacy. Cutter then tells Kim about Stacy's mysterious condition, and Kim tells her brother not to tell anyone about what he saw strange about Stacy. Cutter agrees to keep Kim's secret about Stacy, noting that no one will believe him when he tells anyone back in Llanview about what happened to Stacy.\n\nOn October 10, 2011 Kim comes to Stacy's room and tells her she can now pay for her medical bills since Echo forged Rex's signature on the documents to give all that he took from Clint back. It is also revealed that Stacy has Gigi's face thanks to plastic surgery she got in South America after she survived drowning in that frozen lake a year and a half ago. Kim's brother Cutter then returns to the Kentucky hospital to tell Kim that Aubrey dumped him after she found out the truth about him lying about what he did to Rex's gun, and also blames her for their break-up. Cutter then decides to revert back to his grifting ways by blackmailing Kim to give him the forged documents so that he could use it to scam the Buchanans, or he'll reveal the truth about Stacy to everyone in Llanview. Cutter also asked Kim if she was sure that it was really Stacy in that hospital room. Kim told Cutter that it was really Stacy, and that she got plastic surgery to look like her sister so that she can take over her life. Kim also confessed to Cutter that she tried to stop Stacy's scheme against Gigi when she followed Stacy to Llanview, and found her in the basement of a rental house that was leaking carbon monoxide, along with Gigi's dead body. Kim then got Stacy out of the house and put her in a hospital in Cherryvale before she ended up in the Kentucky hospital after she fell into a coma from the carbon monoxide poisoning. Cutter told Kim he believed her story, and Kim then gave the forged documents to Cutter on the condition that he'll give her some of the money to pay for Stacy's hospital bills. On October 14, 2011, Stacy wakes up from her coma. She then asks Cutter questions about where she is and who she is, but he is evasive to her answers. He only tells her that she has a sister who recently passed away. Cutter then decides to use Stacy as leverage to blackmail Rex for the Buchanan fortune. On October 24, Stacy looks up information on Gigi and Stacy on the internet on Cutter's laptop computer he left in her room, and comes to the conclusion that she might be Gigi. Stacy then leaves the hospital, and goes to Llanview to stop by the Llanfair estate and sees Tina Lord at the front door. Tina asks her who she was, and Stacy told her that she might have lived here and that she might be Gigi Morasco. Tina told her that she didn't recognized the name since she's been out of town for a few years, but will ask her relatives. Tina then ask her her niece Jessica Buchanan if she knew about Gigi. Jessica told her that Gigi is dead, and when Tina went back to talk to Stacy, she saw that she was gone. Stacy then went to Gigi's gravesite at the cemetery, and was confused about who she was and why she looked like her dead sister. Cutter then found her at the cemetery and she asked him about why she looked like someone who just died. Cutter then explained to Stacy that she wasn't Gigi, and that she got plastic surgery to look like her sister to take over her life, and survived being trapped in that basement that was leaking carbon monoxide that killed her sister before her friend Kim rescued her to take her to the hospital when she ended up in a coma. Cutter then took Stacy to his home with her after she left a flower on Gigi's tombstone. The next morning, Stacy wakes up in bed in a motel room she shares with Cutter at The Minute Man. Stacy asks Cutter if he remembers anything about her life, but Cutter promised Stacy that he would tell her everything she knows after she took a shower. After she got out of the shower, Stacy wonders who Cutter was arguing with at the door, and Cutter tells her it was his ex-girlfriend, but is not honest about what they were talking about. On October 28, Cutter convinces Stacy to crash Natalie and Brody's costume themed engagement party at the Buchanan Mansion on Halloween night with him so that when she sees Rex and Shane at the party, it could help her to get her memories back. Cutter dressed himself in a mummy costume, and Stacy dressed as Little Red Riding Hood wearing a mask when they both arrive at the mansion greeted by Rex at the door. Stacy tells Cutter that she felt strong feelings towards Rex when she first saw him at the door. Stacy then discovers a halloween greeting card with a recorded voice by Gigi. Shane then approaches her, and thanks her for finding the card for him before she escapes to the stables when Shane asks for her name. Stacy then departs to the stables where Cutter finds her with her mask off. Cutter then puts the mask back on her face before they are both discovered by Aubrey when she takes off Cutter's mask and foils his latest scheme. Rex also finds both of them at the stables as well. Cutter and Stacy then leaves the party to head back home. The next morning, after Stacy wakes up from dreaming about Rex, Stacy confronts Cutter about why she's using her to get to Rex. Cutter explains to Stacy that he's using her so that she can reunite with Rex, and that he can get the Buchanan fortune from him while they both benefit from what they want from Rex. Cutter also reminds Stacy that she used to be a con artist herself, and that's how she got to Rex before. After Cutter left the motel room, Rex went to the door and broke into the room to find Stacy himself. Stacy then hid in the bathroom before Rex entered the room, where she heard Rex scold her for trying to fool him to think that she was his dead fiance Gigi. After Rex left the room and confronted Cutter about his scam after he arrived back home, Stacy told Cutter that she wanted out of their deal so that she could get plastic surgery to look like her old self again. On November 14, Stacy goes to the airport to catch a flight to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil to reverse her plastic surgery, when Cutter stops her from boarding the plane. Stacy tells Cutter that she doesn't want to be part of his scam anymore, and that she doesn't want to hurt Rex and Shane anymore by pretending to be Gigi. Cutter becomes touched by Stacy's change of heart, and allows her to go to Brazil, on the condition that he can tag along with her on the trip. Stacy then asked Cutter to talk about his past after they boarded the plane. Cutter then talked about how his father William J. \"Billy Joe\" Wentworth Jr. grew up poor and then became rich after investing his money in the stock market after getting a job as a stock trader. Billy Joe then married a woman named Alexandra, who later abandoned him and Cutter and his sister Kim by taking off with some of Billy Joe's money. Billy Joe later killed himself after he failed to find his missing wife. Cutter and Kim then both were seperated going into the foster care system after their father died. Cutter ran away from all of his foster homes to find his sister until he found her, and they later supported themselves by becoming con artists to try to regain the wealth they used to have in their early childhoods. Stacy began to feel sorry for Cutter after hearing about his tragic past. Stacy and Cutter then arrived in Rio where they went to the plastic surgeon's waiting room outside his office. They both asked a nurse if Stacy has been here before to get plastic surgery. The nurse then got Stacy's file and was shocked by her before and after photos of her surgery. Stacy and Cutter then both sat down to wait for the doctor when Cutter's estranged mother Alexandra (who later revealed herself to be Alex Olanov) left the doctor's office and complained about her botched surgery on her cheek.\n\nHannah O'Connor\n\nMeghann Fahy (February 25, 2010 – November 1, 2010)\n\nHannah O'Connor One Life to Live Portrayed by Meghann Fahy Duration 2010 First appearance February 25, 2010 Last appearance November 1, 2010 Cause/reason Incarcerated in Statesville Prison for various crimes Created by Ron Carlivati Profile Occupation Former Sophomore at Llanview University Residence Statesville Prison\n\nRelationships\n\nHannah O' Connor arrives in Llanview in 2010 as Cole Thornhart's project partner.

As Marcie is married to John's brother Michael, John initiates his own pursuit of her; he and Ramsey and continually run into one another on their separate searches across the country. After Marty Saybrooke and her son Cole Thornhart go missing, John returns to Llanview to find them. John discovers that Ramsey has been searching for the terrorist who had murdered Marty's husband, Patrick Thornhart, and entices Ramsey to break off his hunt for Marcie in order to finally capture Patrick's killer. John and Ramsey are forced to work together to track down Marty and Cole. John discovers a microchip in the back of one of Patrick's books of poetry, and later uses it to bargain with terrorist Simon Ryerson in Ireland in exchange for Marty and Cole's safety. The transaction is botched by Ramsey's reckless actions, and Marty is apparently killed in an explosion. Ramsey is promptly suspended by the Bureau for his conduct during the affair.\n\nNow a free agent, Ramsey offers his services to Todd as a bounty hunter. They confront waitress Gigi Morasco, whom they soon discover is hiding Marcie from the authorities. Ramsey takes Gigi and her young son Shane hostage, over Todd's objections, and demands that Gigi call Marcie to meet with her. Marcie arrives but escapes; Ramsey attempts to gun her down while she is still holding Tommy. Todd angrily struggles with Ramsey, and Michael McBain is shot instead. He survives, and Marcie is later apprehended. Ramsey visits a jailed Gigi and threatens to harm her and Shane if she tells anyone about Ramsey and Todd holding her hostage. He is later arrested on suspicion of attempting to kill Gigi and Shane, but on February 15, 2008 is inexplicably named the new Commissioner of Llanview Police Department after the mayor fires Bo Buchanan. It soon becomes clear that Mayor Lowell is in league with Ramsey for some mysterious reason.\n\nLoyal Llanview police officers Antonio Vega and Talia Sahid are determined to get Bo his job back, and work with John to oust Ramsey and expose him as a crooked cop. To this end, Antonio and Talia stage a break-up, and Antonio tricks Ramsey into believing that he has switched allegiances and is open to Ramsey's corrupting influence. With Antonio as an accomplice, Ramsey orchestrates the theft of the crown jewels of Mendorra, set to be displayed in Llanview at Lindsay Rappaport's Fine Arts Gallery. During the heist, Ramsey attempts to have Talia framed for criminal collusion and tries to have her dismissed from the force. On June 11, 2008, it is revealed that Ramsey has been secretly caring for an injured and confused Marty in the penthouse he had purchased from Todd, and that he had the jewels stolen in order to sell them on the black market and pay for Marty's private medical care.[106] It becomes clear that the crooked Ramsey has compassion for Marty, and harbors regret for his part in her near-fatal accident. He tells Marty that he hopes to heal her physical and mental traumas and release her to her family and friends, and then be reinstated by the FBI himself. Ramsey's buyer for the jewels turns out to be Todd's long-lost sister Tina Lord — now the Crown Princess of Mendorra. Tina arrives at Ramsey's penthouse with a briefcase full of Euros, and the two make an exchange. But when Tina briefly moves in another room, thugs sent by United States Ambassador to Mendorra Jonas Chamberlain burst into the penthouse and shoot Ramsey to death. Ramsey's last act as he lies wounded is to crawl towards the penthouse stairs, in an attempt to protect Marty.[10]\n\nAfter Ramsey's death, Carlo Hesser reveals that Ramsey had appointed to the commissioner’s office, by him, via the mayor. In addition, Ramsey had been in Hesser's employ as part of the scheme with the Mendorran Crown Jewels, and had secured Carlo's secret release from Statesville Prison.\n\nClaudia Reston\n\nKerry Butler (January 18, 2006 – January 3, 2007)\n\nClaudia Reston is the ex-girlfriend and later friend to Nash Brennan. Nash's pregnant girlfriend Tess (the alternate personality of Jessica Buchanan) visits Claudia in a drug rehab, where Claudia has been since her break-up with Nash. Claudia, a rich heiress and a recovering alcoholic, explains that Nash made her believe he loved her, but was really scamming her for her father's money. Nash explains that his grifter days are behind him and that he sincerely regrets taking advantage of Claudia. Seemingly rehabilitated, Claudia soon appears in Llanview, taking a job as a singer at Antonio Vega's club \"Capricorn.\" Soon her powerful father George arrives on the scene, blaming Nash for Claudia's troubles. After Mr. Reston threatens Nash and Tess' lives, Nash turns to the manipulative Claudia for help. Claudia hopes to regain Nash's love by aiding him in a scheme against her father, but their plan ends in tragedy when George Reston ends up dead by Claudia's hand during a scuffle with Nash. Nash, however, helps her cover up the fatal accident.\n\nClaudia continues to try and woo Nash while befriending Antonio, but her hopes are in vain. When she falls off the wagon on New Year's Eve 2006, Nash and Antonio urge her to go to rehab. Claudia then heads back to New York City to detox and start a new life.\n\nMark Solomon\n\nWilliam M. Cavenaugh (July 2, 2004 – June 3, 2005)\n\nMark Solomon is a failing student at Llanview University, who is assigned to help re-build the recently burned down community center with other failing students.
