        "text": "When I first met my husband, he would often go away for five weeks at a time with his photography collective. Over the years, they’ve been to China, South America, Ghana, Mexico. For five weeks I would be left alone in the house, live a different life, have friends over until late, go out and not need to remember to text anyone that I’d got home safe. Even though I missed him, I loved the freedom it brought. It was a good thing and made us realise early on that we were two separate people, not “each other’s halves”.\n\nHe would be travelling around a lot and not really have time to text much. Me and the other girlfriends had them on “find my iPhone” but apart from that, we just left them to it. We were so happy to be reunited when he returned and our relationship always felt secure.\n\nRecently, over our morning chats at the kitchen table, I kept saying to my husband that I wanted to go away by myself for a month. It was my turn. It felt like a big deal to be saying it for some reason. I wasn’t asking for a “break” but I was saying that I was craving space to be alone. Not a space from him as such, but space for me to write, enjoy my own company, remember what it’s like to do things for myself and starfish the bed.\n\nWe’ve been together for 12 years (since my early 20s) and my biggest fear is that over time I’d become an inept person who cannot do anything for myself. My husband is a loyal, sensible, trustworthy and very efficient person. He can sort any problem out. But often this leaves me feeling like a rubbish feminist who wouldn’t survive five minutes in an apocalypse. I look at my single friends who live alone and feel in awe: the way they bleed radiators, sort their boilers out, paint walls and replace lightbulbs. Even though there are many challenges too, I feel jealous of their strength and capabilities in life.\n\nDuring a recent trip to New York, I was chatting with a friend about wanting a month to myself. I didn’t want to do anything too busy that needed an itinerary, like interrailing, or go anywhere too remote that would make me feel too lonely. I just wanted to live life, alone, for a month. My friend mentioned something she’d read by author (and fellow child-free woman) Ruby Warrington, who once took a “marriage sabbatical” and spoke positively of her experience. It sounds dramatic, but it’s not really. A little sabbatical from your domestic life. It sounded perfect, and just what I was looking for.\n\nThen, the universe delivered. I had “put it out there” as they say, and to my surprise, a few months later, a friend based in New York got in touch to say she was going on holiday for a month, and would I like to stay in her apartment for mates rates? I jumped at the chance, messaging back immediately. When else would I ever be able to afford to stay in New York for an extended period of time? It made total sense; after all, it was where I first had the idea. And in New York, you can never be bored, there are activities and people fizzing with life on every block. I could live out my dream single life for a month, without actually being single.\n\nI once heard the author Caroline O’Donoghue talk about the concept of being “culturally single”, as in, people around you often think of you as being single, even though you’re in a faithful solid relationship behind the scenes. You appear free, not tied down, available for friends, enjoy a dinner party, but you are in fact very much in a relationship. I wanted to cos-play as a single woman in New York (hello Carrie Bradshaw) without actually being single (and will no doubt be texting my husband every night). I think it will also give him a break from me, and I’m sure he’ll enjoy living in a less chaotic house for a short while.\n\nWhen I told my sister that I was going away for a month on my own, for some reason I expected her to be surprised, even slightly concerned. “That’s amazing!” she said. “What a great idea! The sign of a very stable relationship.”\n\nShe’s right. It is a sign of a strong happy relationship. It should be totally normalised to need time away for no reason other than you want to. I’m going to enjoy my time alone in New York and I’m also going to be so happy to come home again to my favourite person."
