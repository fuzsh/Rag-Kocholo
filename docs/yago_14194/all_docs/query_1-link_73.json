        "text": "Courtesy of Gannon Sports - Link\n\nBy Jeff Kirik, Assistant Director of Athletics for Media Relations\n\nTom Boyd has been promoted to Gannon University men's wrestling head coach, Director of Athletics Lisa Goddard McGuirk announced on Thursday morning.\n\nBoyd was an All-American wrestler at Gannon in 1991 and began serving as head coach Don Henry's assistant in 1995. He's been with Gannon wrestling ever since. He will now follow his long-time mentor, boss, and friend into the Golden Knights' top spot, officially beginning his new duties on July 1.\n\n\"We are excited to announce the promotion of long-time assistant and Gannon men's wrestling alum Tom Boyd to the position of head men's wrestling coach,\" Goddard McGuirk said. \"Tom has served as an integral part of our program's success and rise to national prominence. Coach Boyd is committed to both our department and student-athletes' pursuit of excellence in all facets â€“ academics, athletics, and the community. We are confident that our student-athletes and men's wrestling program will continue to excel under his leadership.\"\n\n\"I am honored and humbled to be chosen to carry on what Coach Henry has dedicated himself to over the past 39 years,\" Boyd said. \"He truly is a legend in the sport of college wrestling and has touched many lives.\"\n\n\"When I pondered retiring, Tom Boyd was the only person I wanted to hand off the program to,\" said Henry, who announced his retirement, effective June 30, on Wednesday evening. \"He has been a great asset to me and the wrestling teams over the past 20-plus seasons. I knew that he would be a great head coach last year when I could not travel to the NCAA Super Region tournament. He led the team to a second-place finish, with eight NCAA qualifiers.\n\n\"He has been the voice of reason, a sounding board, and the planner for all of the trips. He is logical, disciplined and truly loves Gannon University and wants to elevate the wrestling program even higher. He will do great things as the head coach.\"\n\nBoyd, 53, came to Gannon as a wrestler in 1987 and excelled under Henry's guidance. He became Gannon's first wrestler to be ranked No. 1 nationally, and he was an All-American in 1990-91 when he placed sixth at 134 pounds at the NCAA Division II Championships.\n\nBoyd posted a 77-22-3 career record, including a 32-4-3 mark in dual meets. His overall winning percentage of .770 ranks fourth in Gannon history, and his dual meet winning percentage of .859 ranks fifth. During his senior season in 1991-92, he went 29-3-1, including a 15-0-1 mark in dual meets.\n\nAfter graduating from Gannon with a degree in Biology, Boyd attended Palmer College of Chiropractic in Davenport College, where he received his doctoral degree. Boyd and his wife, Christine, practice at Boyd Chiropractic Clinic in Erie. Both have served as chiropractors and consultants for athletic teams as well, including the Erie Otters of the Ontario Hockey League and several indoor football teams.\n\nBoyd began his coaching career as a volunteer assistant coach at NCAA Division III Augustana (Ill.) College for three seasons (1992-95). He joined Henry's staff in 1995 and has been a key member of the coaching staff ever since during the Golden Knights' ascent on the national stage.\n\nThroughout the years he has helped Henry develop many top wrestlers, Division II national qualifiers, and All-Americans. He has been instrumental in helping the wrestlers excel on the mat, in the classroom, and in the community beyond their years at Gannon.\n\n\"I want to thank Dr. Keith Taylor, Dr. Walter Iwanenko, Athletics Director Lisa Goddard McGuirk for this opportunity to lead the Gannon men's wrestling team,\" Boyd said. \"I also want to thank my wife, Christine, for being a part of this journey. I know that, with Coach Zack Schafer, Coach Jared Merritt, and the strong support of the Gannon Wrestling Alumni, we are ready to continue our pursuit of winning a Division II National Championship.\""
