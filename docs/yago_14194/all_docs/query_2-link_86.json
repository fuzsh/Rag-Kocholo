Thanks again!\n\nThis list compiled with the help of:\n\nCindy Bale\n\nChristian Barrett\n\nTerry Chambers\n\nCheryl Ann Dougherty\n\nMichelle \"Micki\" Duncan\n\nVicki Farmer\n\nLynn-Anne Friese\n\nDeborah Graham\n\nKate the Short\n\nBetsy Mandrus\n\nLinda Martindale\n\nPamela Oliver\n\nDorothy Theriot\n\nLarry Winner\n\nTina Wood\n\nDavid Wyatt\n\nPlease send any additions/corrections to jt...@andrew.cmu.edu or\n\nrespond to this message.\n\nWell, folks, it's that time again. I've decided to change the list\n\naround a little and include as many characters as possible. There's no\n\nlonger the restraint that they have to be connected to someone currently\n\non the show. I *would*, however, like for everyone who submits a\n\ncharacter to provide as much background for that character as they can.\n\nWhile I realize that this show has been on the air for 25 years, I don't\n\nwant to put a line or two behind each character name. Also, please try\n\nto give me the name of the actor(s) who played the character.\n\nAlong those lines, if you'd like a character's history to be\n\nexpanded, just send me the material and you, too, can have your name up\n\nthere with other illustrious members of the OLTL net.family. And if\n\nanyone knows any of the unidentified actors below, please tell me.\n\nThanks everyone for all of your help.
