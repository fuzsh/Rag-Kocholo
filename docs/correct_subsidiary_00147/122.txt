In a move to expand its on-demand software offerings, Oracle on Tuesday said it plans to acquire call center infrastructure software Telephony@Work.

Financial terms of the deal weren't disclosed. Oracle inherited a partnership with La Jolla, Calif.-based Telephony@Work through its Siebel Systems acquisition early this year. Siebel embedded Telephony@Work in its Contact OnDemand offering for hosted contact-center technology. By purchasing Telephony@Work, Oracle extends its control over the Contact OnDemand technology stack.

Founded in 1997, privately held Telephony@Work develops browser-based, carrier-hosted software that handles contact-center infrastructure tasks such as call queuing and distribution, outbound dialing, e-mail sorting and semi-automated response, as well as voice mail and fax services. In addition to entering licensing deals like the Siebel arrangement, Telephony@Work sells its technology to end-user companies and commercial service providers, which host the software for their contact center customers.

Oracle plans to integrate the Telephony@Work technology more tightly with its CRM and business intelligence offerings, according to Mike Betzer, vice president of product management at the Redwood Shores, Calif., software giant.
