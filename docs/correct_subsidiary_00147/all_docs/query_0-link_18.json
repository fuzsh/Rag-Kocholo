        "text": "Legal Structure\n\nThe figure illustrates a typical group of legal entities, operating various business and functional organizations. Your ability to buy and sell, own, and employ comes from your charter in the legal system. A corporation is:\n\nA distinct legal entity from its owners and managers.\n\nOwned by its shareholders, who may be individuals or other corporations.\n\nMany other kinds of legal entities exist, such as sole proprietorships, partnerships, and government agencies.\n\nA legally recognized entity can own and trade assets and employ people in the jurisdiction in which the entity is registered. When granted these privileges, legal entities are also assigned responsibilities to:\n\nAccount for themselves to the public through statutory and external reporting.\n\nComply with legislation and regulations.\n\nPay income and transaction taxes.\n\nProcess value added tax (VAT) collection on behalf of the taxing authority.\n\nMany large enterprises isolate risk and optimize taxes by incorporating subsidiaries. They create legal entities to facilitate legal compliance, segregate operations, optimize taxes, complete contractual relationships, and isolate risk. Enterprises use legal entities to establish their enterprise's identity within the laws of each country in which their enterprise operates.\n\nThe figure illustrates:\n\nA separate card represents a series of registered companies.\n\nEach company, including the public holding company, InFusion America, must be registered in the countries where they do business.\n\nEach company contributes to various divisions created for purposes of management reporting. These are shown as vertical columns on each card.\n\nFor example, a group might have a separate company for each business in the United States (US), but have its United Kingdom (UK) legal entity represent all businesses in that country.\n\nThe divisions are linked across the cards so that a business can appear on some or all of the cards. For example, the air quality monitoring systems business might be operated by the US, UK, and France companies. The list of business divisions is on the Business Axis.\n\nEach company's card is also horizontally striped by functional groups, such as the sales team and the finance team. This functional list is called the Functional Axis. The overall image suggests that information might, at a minimum, be tracked by company, business, division, and function in a group environment. In Oracle Fusion Applications, the legal structure is implemented using legal entities."
