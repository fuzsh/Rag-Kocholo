        "text": "Oracle Corporation (ORCL)\n\n140.68 USD -4.35 (-3.00%) Volume: 14.33M\n\nOracle Corporation’s stock price is currently standing at 140.68 USD, experiencing a decrease of -3.00% this trading session, with a trading volume of 14.33M. Despite today’s dip, ORCL has shown a significant growth of +33.43% YTD, affirming its strong market performance.\n\nLatest developments on Oracle Corporation\n\nOracle Corp stock took a hit today after talks with Musk’s xAI on a $10 billion server deal fell through, as reported by The Information. Despite this setback, Oracle and Palantir continue to unlock new innovations in cloud and AI to empower businesses and governments globally. The company’s stock, trading under NYSE:ORCL, outperformed competitors on a strong trading day, but closed in the red, snapping a seven-day winning streak. Analysts believe Oracle’s stock could surge by 25% by 2025, showcasing potential for growth despite recent challenges. Additionally, Oracle recently upgraded its quotation to OTCQB under “ORLCF,” indicating a strategic move to enhance market visibility.\n\nOracle Corporation on Smartkarma\n\nAnalysts at Baptista Research have been closely covering Oracle Corp on Smartkarma, providing valuable insights into the company’s performance. In their research reports, such as “Oracle Corporation: How Long Will The Cloud Revenue Growth Last? – Major Drivers,” analysts highlighted the strong performance of Oracle in its third-quarter fiscal year 2024. The discussion centered on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) as the primary driver for the company’s overall revenue acceleration. While the report noted potential future performance and inherent risks, investors were advised to closely observe these factors.\n\nIn another report by Baptista Research, titled “Oracle Corporation: Will The Expansion In Application Subscription Revenues Last? – Major Drivers,” analysts discussed the mixed but predominantly positive picture presented in Oracle Corporation’s Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2024 Earnings. Chief Executive Officer Safra Catz praised the company’s infrastructure cloud business (OCI) as the main factor accelerating overall revenue growth, outpacing their cloud competitors. The report highlighted the excellent overall quarterly performance, with revenue meeting expectations and earnings per share exceeding them by $0.02.\n\nA look at Oracle Corporation Smart Scores\n\nFactorScoreMagnitudeValue2Dividend4Growth3Resilience2Momentum5OVERALL SMART SCORE3.2\n\nSmart Score is a compound score for the Company indicating its overall outlook. It is derived by taking an equally weighted average of underlying Factor scores computed by Smartkarma\n\nOracle Corporation, a leading software supplier for enterprise information management, has received a mixed outlook based on the Smartkarma Smart Scores. While the company scored high in terms of Dividend and Momentum, indicating a strong performance in these areas, it scored lower in terms of Value, Growth, and Resilience. This suggests that Oracle may face challenges in terms of long-term growth and value creation, despite its current strong momentum in the market.\n\nDespite its lower scores in certain areas, Oracle Corporation remains a key player in the software industry, offering a wide range of products for enterprise businesses. With a focus on databases, relational servers, and application development tools, Oracle’s software is utilized across various devices and computer systems. However, the company may need to address certain factors to improve its overall outlook and ensure sustained success in the long term.\n\nDisclaimer: This article by Smartkarma is general in nature and based on historical data and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.
