Agents can use Oracle TeleService to update customer records, validate product ownership and contract coverage, provide proactive and personalized customer service, and resolve many problems during the initial contact using a knowledge base.\n\nYou can use the application to support a wide variety of customers including businesses, consumers, and internal employees. Social service agencies can use Oracle TeleService to track welfare cases, local governments to resolve citizen complaints, and investigative agencies to conduct investigations.\n\nCustomer Management Features\n\nThe customer management features make it possible for agents to:\n\nReceive screen pops with relevant customer, product, and service request information when a customer calls.\n\nQuickly display customer information by entering unique customer identifiers (service keys) such as product serial numbers.\n\nView key customer information on a dashboard and drill down to the details.\n\nReceive automatic alerts or guidance through scripts when customers meet criteria you specify (Relationship Plans).\n\nManage customer criticality.\n\nWork Related Features\n\nThe work related features speed up handling and resolution of customer inquiries. They make it possible for agents to:\n\nHandle customer inquiries through multiple channels including inbound telephony, Oracle iSupport self-service Web portal, e-mail, Web conferences, and call back requests.\n\nResolve customer problems by searching the organization's knowledge base.\n\nManually or automatically assign the service request to the group or the person most appropriate to handle it.\n\nView details of customer products in the install base.\n\nKeep customer contacts and agents informed about a service request through automatic notifications.\n\nMake related documents available for other agents working on the service request at the click of a mouse.\n\nCheck contracts, apply entitlements, and have the application automatically track resolution times to ensure your organization meets its contractual obligations.\n\nCreate, assign, and schedule tasks required to resolve the problem.\n\nKeep customer contacts and other members of the team informed through automatic notifications.\n\nSend and receive customer e-mails in context of the service request.\n\nAutomatically open the next service request that should be worked on with the click of a button.\n\nAutomatically submit service requests for approval.\n\nCollaborate with customers over the Web.\n\nGenerate reports of service request content that can be configured, via Oracle XML Publisher.\n\nManage returns and service billing.\n\nMultiple Modules for Different Uses\n\nOracle TeleService is divided into four main application modules intended for different types of users:\n\nService Request and Contact Center\n\nCustomer Support\n\nService Desk\n\nCase Management\n\nThe Service Request and Contact Center module of the Oracle TeleService encompasses the widest range of features of all the modules. Its robust technology and integration with inbound telephony and Oracle Order Management for processing service charges makes this module ideal for high-volume call centers.\n\nThe last three modules, Customer Support, Service Desk, and Case Management provide superior performance over slower remote connections and can be personalized extensively to increase efficiency of both specialists and occasional users.\n\nCustomer Support, Service Desk, and Case Management are targeted at remote users, technicians, and call centers where telephony integration is not required.\n\nAbout the Service Request and Contact Center Module\n\nThe Oracle Service Request and Contact Center module of Oracle TeleService is composed of two main user interfaces targeted at different users:\n\nContact Center Window\n\nService Request Window\n\nThe two interfaces are integrated, so users can easily switch between them with the click of a button.\n\nAbout the Contact Center Window\n\nThe Contact Center window is designed to enable Tier-1 customer service agents in high volume call centers to manage customer information and quickly enter service requests.\n\nIt provides the central place to view and update customer information that has been collected by the entire Oracle E-Business Suite of applications.\n\nAgents can access not only addresses and contacts but also a record of all past interactions your organization has had with a customer, including e-mails, phone calls, and site visits. Agents can read notes posted by the entire organization about a customer and know which products the customer has purchased, their service history, and any contractual agreements that apply.\n\nPutting all the information about customers at agents' fingertips not only speeds up issue resolution but also eliminates the need for customers to repeat the same information over and over again as their problem gets passed through your organization.\n\nAbout the Service Request Window\n\nThe Service Request window optimized the resolution of service requests. It permits Tier-2 customer support agents to manage and resolve requests for service from the time the customer contacts the organization or logs a service request on the Web until the problem is resolved.\n\nThe Service Request window includes the Charges tab, which permits agents to charge for service and manage returns.\n\nAbout the Customer Support Module\n\nCustomer Support is a HTML module of Oracle TeleService. It enables support specialists to effectively create, manage, and resolve customer issues.\n\nIts key benefits include:\n\nAn efficient dashboard and work list enabling users to prioritize work, search knowledge, analyze service history and resolve issues.\n\nImproved service effectiveness by providing business rules and flows that can be configured to standardize issue resolution.\n\nAbout the Service Desk Module\n\nUsed in conjunction with Oracle iSupport, Service Desk offers a comprehensive employee help desk solution that improves the effectiveness and quality of internal support operations. The user interface optimizes the presentation of service information and its business flow-based design enables efficient processing of Service Desk requests. Built to support industry standards such as ITIL (IT Infrastructure Library), the Service Desk facilitates best practices for key areas of service management, including incident, problem, change and configuration management.\n\nThe Service Desk module provides:\n\nConsolidated support of key business functions including IT, human resources, and facilities.\n\nImproved productivity by enabling agents to efficiently determine which issues and requests to work on next, configuring the user interface to meet the exact needs of the service desk user, and automating business processes to resolve issues quickly.\n\nEnhanced quality of employee service by ensuring best practices across departments, and enabling efficient self-service channels.\n\nAbout the Case Management Module\n\nCase Management is targeted to meet the needs of law enforcement agencies, human and social services organizations, and claims and benefits departments.\n\nThis application uses the same service application infrastructure and setups as the other HTML modules, but personalized to handle cases.\n\nIn addition, Case Management facilitates the capture and track information on parties involved in a case such as suspects, witnesses, case administrators, social workers and others. Integrated with a robust set of tools, Case Management facilitates interdepartmental case handling, knowledge sharing and promotes accountability.\n\nIts key benefits include:\n\nAn industry standard and commercially available solution targeting the needs of law enforcement agencies, human and social services organizations, and claims and benefits departments.\n\nAbility to create, search, track, and manage complex cases.\n\nAgency security and accountability by controlling access to cases and provides a comprehensive audit capability.\n\nModule Compatibility\n\nBecause Oracle TeleService' modules are targeted at different users, they expose different features of the application.\n\nThe tables in this section highlight the differences between the way features are exposed in the different modules and in Oracle iSupport. The tables include separate entries for the Contact Center and Service Request windows, the two main Oracle-Forms interfaces. Oracle iSupport is included because this application provides the self-service solution for Oracle TeleService.\n\nThese tables can help you decide which module to implement and which features work across modules if you decide to mix and match.\n\nFor example, if you are implementing a call center with telephony integration, you will want to implement the Service Request and Contact Center module because of its integration with inbound telephony and IVR.\n\nFor the details about the features you can implement for each module see the implementation checklist provided in a separate chapter.\n\nA \"Y\" entry in a table cell means the feature is fully supported by the module; \"P\" signifies the features is partially supported; and \"N\" indicates that it is not supported or not applicable. Footnotes at the end of the tables give further details.\n\nCustomer Management Features\n\nThe following table highlights features related to customer management and their availability in the different Oracle TeleService modules:\n\nThe table heading uses abbreviated module and product names:\n\nContact Center window (Oracle Forms): C.

It does not support context-sensitive flexfields.\n\n(3): In the HTML-based modules you can view addresses in global address formats, but you can only create new addresses in the U.S. address format.)\n\n(4): Agents cannot dynamically switch between different time zones to display dates and times.\n\nKey Integrations\n\nThe level of functionality agents receive from Oracle TeleService depends on implementation of different components of the Oracle E-Business Suite. This section explains the functionality added by:\n\nCommon application components\n\nService suite foundation\n\nKey integrated applications\n\nCommon Application Components\n\nOracle TeleService makes use of common Oracle E-Business Suite application modules. Key functionality is delivered by:\n\nOracle Universal Work Queue (UWQ): This is where agents obtain their work assignments, including service requests, tasks, and Web callbacks. The UWQ also provides the interface for handling calls. Agents receive inbound calls via their icWork Controller (Softphone) by logging into a work queue.\n\nAssignment Manager: Provides agents with the ability to assign resources to a task or a service request based on service territories, qualification, availability, and geographic location.\n\nResource Manager: This module stores the skill levels of your organization's field technicians and agents. Agents use this information to assign the right technician for the job either manually or automatically.\n\nNotes: This module makes it possible for all employees of the company to share notes on customer and customer issues and to communicate with customers through the Oracle iSupport Web portal.\n\nTask Manager: The task manager makes it possible to assign, reassign, and prioritize tasks needed to deliver service to the customer. Assigned tasks appear as work items in the assignee work queues. Tasks can also be synchronized with Microsoft Outlook and Palm devices through functionality provided by this module.\n\nNote: Agents must manage their tasks from Oracle TeleService as the Task Manager cannot be used for updating service request tasks as this interface is read only.\n\nTerritory Manager: Your organization can use the territory manager to set up service territories that the service suite uses to automatically assign tasks and service requests to employees based on their skill, geographical location, and other criteria. Your organizations can have the assignment done automatically or via a concurrent program.\n\nEscalation Management and Business Rule Monitor: Using Escalation Management and the Business Rule Monitor agents can re-prioritize, reassign, and monitor a situation to a satisfactory completion. Both applications are modules of the application foundation and part of the Oracle Common Application Calendar.\n\nOracle One to One Fulfillment: This module makes it possible for you to e-mail or fax copies of service requests to customers.\n\nService Suite Foundation\n\nThree applications provide key functionality for Oracle TeleService and form the foundation for all service suite applications:\n\nOracle Knowledge Management\n\nOracle Installed Base\n\nOracle Asset Tracking\n\nOracle Knowledge Management\n\nThe integration with Oracle Knowledge Management makes it possible for agents using Oracle TeleService to search for solutions to customer problems.\n\nOracle bundles knowledge management tools with all service suite applications. The tools make it possible for your organization to build and maintain an enterprise-wide repository of knowledge ranging from office procedures to technical troubleshooting solutions. Your organization can develop solution templates in a wide variety of formats from simple questions and answers to product bulletins, FAQs, troubleshooting guides, and product documentation. The organization can make different knowledge management solutions available to different audiences: to call center agents, field technicians, and customers logging in on the Web portal.\n\nOracle Installed Base and Oracle Asset Tracking\n\nIntegration with the install base applications makes it possible for Oracle TeleService agents to log service requests against items owned by either customers or employees.\n\nOracle Asset Tracking tracks the internal assets of an organization. Oracle Installed Base tracks customer assets. Both products center on a repository of product data recording the location, configuration, status, ownership, account(s), change history, and party relationship(s) for products, software licenses, and other assets.\n\nThe repository tracks an asset from the time it is received in inventory, in WIP (Work in Process), in projects, at the customer site, or in for repair. Cradle-to-grave tracking follows the asset as it passes through the various divisions of a company (inventory, purchasing, orders, shipping, and service).\n\nAn instance record describes the set of parts constituting a specific physical unit. Knowing the exact composition of the product to be serviced enables the service provider to ensure that the needed parts are available before dispatching a technician; makes it unnecessary for the support agent to ask customers questions about the product's makeup; and makes it possible for an in-house repair center to have a customer ship back to the service center only those parts needed for the repair.\n\nThe install base instance record is the foundation for after-market service, including regularly scheduled maintenance tasks and unplanned maintenance, and it tracks contract and warranty entitlements for the asset it represents. The organization can track the usage of a product or service via the Counters module. For example, a copying machine service company can use counters to record the number of copies made by a particular machine and bill customers based on usage. Usage data can trigger service business processes such as the scheduling of preventive maintenance or overhauls; the renegotiating of service, rental, and leasing contracts; the reordering or shipping parts; and for calculating product reliability.\n\nKey Integrations with Other E-Business Suite Applications\n\nBecause Oracle TeleService is fully integrated with the Oracle E-Business Suite each additional application you implement provides additional functionality for your service organization. To get the most out of Oracle TeleService your organization must implement at least the applications listed in this section.\n\nOracle iSupport\n\nSelf-service Web portals built with Oracle iSupport make it possible for customers and employees to log and monitor their service requests. Oracle TeleService agents can publish service requests for the customers to view, suggest knowledge base solutions, and communicate with customers through notes.\n\nOracle iSupport provides a secure self-service Web portal your customers can use to get immediate help 24 hours a day, seven days a week from anywhere in the world. Your customers can come online to view the status of their orders with your company, review service agreements, update their contact information, and more. Online they can find answers to many of their questions on their own by searching a knowledge base or by participating in online forums. If they need assistance, customers create service requests and monitor their resolution. Integration with Oracle TeleService makes it possible for an agent to step in and help any customers that cannot resolve problems on their own. Your organization can extend the customer support benefits to your employees by deploying Oracle iSupport as a self-service help desk.\n\nOracle Field Service\n\nOracle TeleService agents can review and submit for billing the charges entered by field service technicians using Oracle Field Service.\n\nOracle Field Service automates the process of dispatching field technicians. The application's Dispatch Center provides a central point from which dispatchers can monitor and control the prioritizing, scheduling, and dispatching of field activities. It combines a graphical overview of planned activities for technicians with a calendar or Gantt view, and it uses maps to show technicians' current locations. A dispatcher can change a resource assignment directly on the Gantt chart simply by dragging and dropping a task symbol from one technician to another. Dispatchers can also access statistical overviews of their organizations to assess representatives' performances.\n\nAn escalation process alerts dispatchers when an agreed response-time threshold is exceeded. Automated processes guided by customer-specific escalations and tracking help to ensure progress on each task, enabling call takers, dispatchers, and managers to focus on exceptions.\n\nBuilding on core functionality found in Oracle Inventory, the application's spares management functionality provides the additional logistics and planning features required to effectively manage a field service parts inventory. Using the spares management, a field service organization can automate and streamline all aspects of managing spare parts inventory in the field including ordering, tracking, forecasting and creating reports to name just a few. Oracle Inventory is the only prerequisite product specifically required for implementation of spares management. Oracle Inventory provides the core foundation functionality for the item master, stocking locations, inventory balance tracking, and so on.\n\nOracle Service Contracts\n\nOracle Service Contracts automatically applies the terms of a contract to the service request agents are working on and ensures that your service organization meet its contractual obligations.\n\nThis application makes it possible for agents and technicians providing customer support, field service, or in-house repair service, to review both warranty and service contract details with a customer. Contract details available may include coverage schedules, response and resolution times by severity, preferred and excluded resources, billing rates for labor, relevant discount provisions, and expenses for each type of service on offer.\n\nOracle Service Contracts not only makes the provisions available for review, but it supports the billing process by pushing, labor, materials, and expenses incurred to TeleService's Charges module, which consolidates the information into a single charge with multiple lines. Before the customer is charged, Service Contracts guides the application of customer entitlements to the charges so that discounts and labor rates are applied accurately in calculating the final charge.\n\nOracle Advanced Inbound and Outbound\n\nOracle Advanced Inbound makes it possible for Oracle TeleService to assign a call to an agent most qualified and available to handle the call and to display information about a caller.\n\nOracle Advanced Inbound is designed to channel a customer call to the right call-center agent simultaneously reducing expenses and increasing customer satisfaction.\n\nOracle Advanced Inbound offers Web integration, connectivity to the most popular Integrated Voice Response (IVR) equipment, intelligent routing, screen pops, virtual interaction center, and VoIP support. Oracle Advanced Inbound's easy-to-use rules engine weighs agent skills as well as business rules and data to make complex routing decisions. Oracle Advanced Inbound provides Oracle TeleSales, Oracle TeleService, and Oracle E-Commerce and Oracle Interaction Center applications with screen-pop support that spans all channels-telephony/IVR, e-mail (in Oracle Email Center), and the Web (in Oracle iStore and Oracle iSupport).\n\nOracle Advanced Outbound makes it possible for agents to place outgoing calls.\n\nOracle Email Center\n\nThe Oracle Email Center provides Oracle TeleService with the ability to receive and send e-mails. Templates that automatically fill in relevant information about the service request are provided by the Oracle TeleService administrator.\n\nOracle Email Center helps businesses manage increasing volumes of e-mail through the use of automated analyses and automatic responses to standard or routine e-mail. Oracle Email Center offers the ability to analyze the body of the e-mail and its attachments and provide suggested responses for interaction center agents. It matches the general themes of e-mails against a knowledge base of appropriately managed answers (either from previously used responses or responses that are continually updated). The best suggested response could be used to automatically respond to the sender, thereby eliminating the need for agent contact. When an automated response is not appropriate, Oracle Email Center and Oracle TeleService can route the e-mail to an agent and display a screen pop with customer information. The user interface for Oracle Email Center contains suggested responses that an e-mail agent can use to respond to the issues in the original e-mail.\n\nOracle TeleService integrates with Oracle Email Center to make it possible for you to compose an e-mail with the click of the mouse. Depending on where you launch the Oracle Email Center's Compose window, the application automatically fills in the addressees and context about the service request that you are writing about.\n\nThe e-mails you send are recorded in Oracle E-Business Suite's Interaction History. This makes it possible for you to review any e-mails sent to a customer about a service request directly from the Service Request window or you can use the extensive full-text search capabilities of the Oracle Email Center itself to find the e-mail you are looking for.\n\nOracle Scripting\n\nOracle Scripting makes it possible for your organization to author scripts that can guide agents through customer interactions.\n\nOracle Scripting provides call guides, or scripts, for interaction center agents. When agents use Oracle TeleService, scripts guide them through the call flow needed as they interact with the customer. A script leads an agent through appropriate sales and/or troubleshooting queries, prompts for cross-sell and up-sell opportunities at the right time within the context of the call, and provides detailed information to help the agent resolve customer questions. Scripts also help reduce training time in the high turnover interaction center industry, because they provide simple navigation through complex customer interactions.\n\nOracle Scripting also includes iSurvey, a module designed to support the collection of data through Web-based surveys.\n\nOracle Advanced Scheduler\n\nThe Oracle Advanced Scheduler, an optional module for Oracle Field Service, makes it possible for agents to schedule field service tasks directly from the Oracle TeleService user interface. For further information refer to the Oracle Advanced Scheduler User Guide.\n\nOracle Depot Repair\n\nOracle Depot Repair automates and streamlines the in house repair process providing enterprises with the flexibility to manage multiple types of returns so that a customer does not lose valuable work time while an item is being repaired. It enables repair centers to manage the entire life cycle of repairs including the creation and tracking of repair orders, generation of Return Material Authorizations (RMAs), assignment of repair work orders to the appropriate technicians, capturing/processing the repair activity, shipping repaired/refurbished products to their respective destinations, and then invoicing the customer for the work delivered based on contractual entitlements.\n\nOracle Order Management\n\nUsing Oracle Order Management, an agent can book the order placed through Oracle TeleService and bill the customer for services.\n\nOracle Order Management provides a complete order to cash solution and enables global order promising integrated to shipment execution.\n\nOracle Quality\n\nYour organization can set up collection plans in Oracle Quality that capture relevant data as service requests are logged by customer support personnel. Collection plans may capture data related to a customer, product, and product line. Your organization can then analyze this data in Oracle Quality to answer questions about common problems faced by users, or products which cause the most problems. The captured data can be exported to perform detailed statistical analyses.\n\nOracle Enterprise Asset Management\n\nAgents can create service requests for work orders of internal assets tracked in Oracle Enterprise Asset Management (eAM).\n\nOracle eAM specializes in maintaining internal assets using a preventive maintenance schedule.\n\nOracle Advanced Collections\n\nOracle Advanced Collections makes it possible for agents to manage invoices and payments for customer accounts from the Contact Center.\n\nOracle Advanced Collections enables payments or promises to pay, and can be used to resolve delinquency issues at the customer, account, bill-to, or transaction level.\n\nOracle TeleSales\n\nOracle Telesales makes it possible for agents to send physical or electronic collateral to customers from the Contact Center.\n\nOracle TeleSales manages the entire sales cycle, from marketing to booking orders.\n\nOracle Approvals Management and Oracle E-Records\n\nIn Oracle TeleService you can implement the capture of electronic audit records (e-records) and electronic approvals (e-signatures) via integration with Oracle Approvals Management (for approval rules) and Oracle E-Records (for e-record content setup). Whenever an agent sets a service request (case) to a special status, the application captures the e-record and sends out any approval requests via the Oracle Workflow notification process.\n\nOracle XML Publisher\n\nOracle TeleService uses Oracle XML Publisher to produce service request and case reports in HTML, PDF, RTF, and XSL formats.\n\nOracle Approvals Management\n\nYou can use Oracle Approvals Management to set up an approvals process for service requests and cases.\n\nOracle E-Records\n\nOracle TeleService uses Oracle E-Records to capture electronic records of service requests and cases.\n\nOracle Complex Maintenance, Repair, and Overhaul\n\nUsers of Oracle Complex Maintenance, Repair, and Overhaul can use Oracle TeleService to log service requests against work orders.\n\nOracle Cost Management\n\nOracle TeleService integrates with Oracle Cost Management to retrieve the unit cost of an item captured in the debrief or charge line. Cost information is captured for all debriefed material, labor, and expenses, and for manually created charge lines. With this information customers can generate a report to review cost, charges, and profit margin for individual service requests.\n\nOracle Projects\n\nOracle TeleService integrates with Oracle Projects to track costs for service tasks executed for a particular project and project task, such as installing a cell tower, or overhauling a wind turbine. Costs generated from these tasks can be posted into Oracle Projects to report and account for the project."
