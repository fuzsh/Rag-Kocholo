It provides the media plug-in and application work provider frameworks described above to incorporate media and work items. It also provides an application integration infrastructure that allows applications to receive screen pops through Oracle Universal Work Queue from media and application work providers. Only Oracle Forms-based applications integrate with Oracle Universal Work Queue and they integrate at the forms level. Not all Forms applications integrate with Oracle Universal Work Queue. Only some application forms support Oracle Universal Work Queue screen pops.\n\nAn application work provider creates and manages one or more work item types. Not all Oracle E-Business applications use Universal Work Queue for the presentation and delivery of work items.\n\nThe following applications support Oracle Universal Work Queue screen pops:\n\nOracle TeleSales\n\nOracle TeleService\n\nOracle Advanced Collections\n\nOracle Task Manager\n\nOracle Escalation Manager\n\nThe following table presents a matrix of the application and form launching.\n\nApplication Integration Matrix Application Media Supported (form launched) Screen Pop Forms Work Items Supported Oracle TeleSales\n\nAdvanced Outbound (eBusiness Center)\n\nAdvanced Inbound (eBusiness Center)\n\neBusiness Center\n\nTasks\n\nLeads (work panel enabled)\n\nOpportunities\n\nQuotes\n\nMarketing Lists (work panel enabled)\n\nOracle TeleService\n\nAdvanced Inbound (eBusiness Center)\n\nWeb Callback Request\n\nContact Center\n\nService Request\n\nService Request\n\nTasks\n\nEscalations\n\nOracle Advanced Collections\n\nAdvanced Outbound (eBusiness Center)\n\nAdvanced Inbound (eBusiness Center)\n\neBusiness Center\n\nDelinquency Notice\n\nDunning Notice\n\nBroken Promise to Pay\n\nCollection Strategy\n\nTasks\n\nOracle Task Manager Not supported None\n\nTasks\n\nOracle Escalation Manager Not supported None\n\nEscalations\n\nApplication Work Nodes\n\nApplication work providers expose work item lists through Universal Work Queue nodes.\n\nNodes organize work by work type (task, service request, media), ownership or assignment and by distribution (groups or individuals).\n\nThere may be more than one node for a given work object type: “My Leads” and “My Teams Leads”\n\nNodes may include sub-nodes that further segment work by work item type.\n\nNodes display summary information about each work item the agent may access.\n\nNodes may include quick filters to refine summary information displayed.\n\nNodes may include quick actions (Workpanel) to allow agents to act upon one or several selected work items.\n\nAgents may open work from the work summary; UWQ launches work into the appropriate application form based on work object action mapping implemented in this release.\n\nSummary information presented is different for each work object type.\n\nSites customize nodes.\n\nSites customize summary display. Each summary display consists of a spread table; sites may configure the order and visibility of columns in the spread table.\n\nSites may set default sort order for summary display.\n\nSites may set order of nodes within Agent Workplace.\n\nSites may grant or deny access to nodes on a site-wide, responsibility and individual agent basis.\n\nSites may control access to Workpanel on a site-wide, responsibility and individual agent basis.\n\nSites may configure Workpanel commands, parameter display and notes on a responsibility basis through an HTML administration tool.\n\nSites may configure Quick Filters for each node on a responsibility basis through an HTML administration tool.\n\nAllow agents to control node displays.\n\nAgents may customize the work selector.\n\nAgents may dynamically change node access method: tree control or cascading control.\n\nAgents may hide (or display) nodes for a single session.\n\nAgents may change node order for a single session.\n\nAgents may customize node summary display and save setting between sessions:\n\nAgents may change and save sort summary sort order.\n\nAgents may hide or display summary columns.\n\nAgents may change the order of summary columns.\n\nQueued, Priority Work Distribution and Delivery\n\nWork providers may include work items in the Work Repository to support queued, prioritized distribution and delivery of work items.\n\nApplications map work item priority to UWQ global priority.\n\nApplications maintain work item status.\n\nApplications define work sources and work distribution methods and rules.\n\nUWQ queues work items and supports distribution only upon request and focused, next work distribution and delivery.\n\nApplication Notices\n\nOracle E-Business applications provide notice of important events through Universal Work Queue's application notice framework.\n\nIndividual applications may directly integrate with the Application Notice facility or they may supply workflows that send application notices upon specific events.\n\nThe work provider (application or workflow) determines the actual events that trigger an application notice.\n\nSites may create application notices through public APIs.\n\nAgents may launch work item directly from notice.\n\nTasks\n\nTasks integrate with UWQ for application work. Tasks provide two nodes for browse and select work, “My Tasks” and “Enterprise Tasks,” “All Tasks” is no longer supported.\n\nTasks integrate with the Work Repository to support primary and relationship work sources. This means tasks may be distributed with independent rules for stand-alone tasks (such as agent appointments) or as dependent (child) work items based on the task source application.\n\nUsing the new work action associations in this release, sites may determine the task launch form based on user responsibility and task source document. This means that a service request task may be configured to launch the task manager, service request form or contact center depending on an agent's responsibility.\n\nNodes Provided Applications Supported Work Panel Features Quick Filter Columns Application Notices Work Repository Work Sources\n\nMy Tasks\n\nEnterprise Tasks\n\nService Request\n\nContact Center\n\nOracle TeleSales\n\nLeads Center\n\nOpportunity Center\n\neBusiness Center\n\nOracle Collection\n\nSpecial Instruction\n\nNotes\n\nActions\n\nDue Date\n\nStatus\n\nAssignment/Ownership\n\nNo prepackaged notices.\n\nNo prepackaged notices.\n\nTasks\n\nService Request Tasks\n\nEscalations\n\nEscalations identify work items, such as service requests, that have been escalated and therefore require special attention. Escalations supports a single node segmented by escalation level.\n\nNodes Provided Applications Supported Work Panel Features Quick Filter Columns Application Notices Work Repository Work Sources\n\nEscalations\n\nEscalations (segmented by escalation level)\n\nOracle Escalations\n\nNone\n\nNo prepackaged notices.\n\nNo\n\nLeads\n\nLeads supports two nodes, “My Leads” for owned leads and “My Leads” for sales team associated node. Leads nodes support the work panel; neither supports quick filters. Leads does not subscribe to the Work Repository.\n\nNodes Provided Applications Supported Work Panel Features Quick Filter Columns Application Notices Work Repository Work Sources\n\nMy Leads (Owner)\n\nMy Leads (Sales Team)\n\nOracle TeleSales\n\nOracle Marketing\n\nNotes\n\nActions\n\nNone\n\nNo\n\nNo\n\nOpportunities\n\nOpportunities supports two nodes, “My Opportunities Sales Credits” for owned opportunities and “My Opportunities Sales Team” where the agent is part of the sales team. Both support the work panel; neither supports quick filters. Opportunities does not subscribe to the Work Repository.\n\nOracle TeleSales supports a “Personal Lists” node driven off the Universal Search. This node supports contacts (like Marketing Lists) and Opportunities. Agents create personal lists by specifying selection criteria and executing a Universal Search, then categorizing it as either a Contact or an Opportunity. Agents may create a number of lists in each category. They may be used to track “hot” or failing opportunities, work that requires near-term follow-up, etc. For contacts it is a useful means of creating lists for recurring activities, such as a quarterly or monthly phone call. Personal Lists support Workpanel actions. Contact type lists support Marketing List actions, Opportunity type lists support Opportunity actions. Personal Lists also include the recent activity column and filter.\n\nNodes Provided Applications Supported Work Panel Features Quick Filter Columns Application Notices Work Repository Work Sources\n\nMy Opportunities Sales Credits\n\nMy Opportunities Sales Team\n\nOracle TeleSales\n\nSpecial Instruction\n\nNotes\n\nActions\n\nRecent Activity Filter\n\nNo prepackaged notices.\n\nNo\n\nQuotes\n\nThere is a single quotes node.

Marketing Lists supports two nodes segmented by marketing campaign schedule (so that agents can access each campaign). Marketing lists supports Workpanel but neither Quick Filters nor Work Repository.\n\nOracle TeleSales supports a “Personal Lists” node driven off the Universal Search. This node supports both contacts (like Marketing Lists) and Opportunities. Agents create personal lists by specifying selection criteria and executing a Universal Search and categorizing it as either a Contact or an Opportunity. Agents may create a number of lists in each category. They may be used to track “hot” or failing opportunities, work that requires near-term follow-up, etc. For contacts this is a useful means of creating lists for recurring activities, such as a quarterly or monthly phone call.\n\nPersonal Lists support Workpanel actions. Contact type lists support Marketing List actions, Opportunity type lists support Opportunity actions. Personal Lists also include the recent activity column and filter.\n\nNodes Provided Applications Supported Work Panel Features Quick Filter Columns Application Notices Work Repository Work Sources\n\nMarketing Lists\n\nMarketing Lists Manual Assignments\n\nPersonal Lists\n\nOracle TeleSales\n\neBusiness Center\n\nTask Manager\n\nSpecial Instructions\n\nNotes\n\nActions\n\nNone\n\nNo prepackaged notices.\n\nNo\n\nCollections\n\nCollections applications support four major work objects:\n\nDelinquency – the debt that needs to be collected\n\nBroken Promises – a failed promise to pay in response to a collection effort.\n\nStrategies – a collection effort on behalf of a delinquency.\n\nDunning – an attempt to collect a delinquency, generally in the form of a letter.\n\nTo assist collectors, Collections provides a number of nodes organized to view customer or account information. (See the node list below.) Collections does not support Workpanel, Quick Filters or Work Repository for any of these work item objects.\n\nService Requests\n\nThe service request node supports end-user customization through service provided utilities. This allows site administrators to set the segmentation of the service node. Service supports the new work repository for work distribution from service request and SR Task work sources. It does not support Workpanel or Quick Filters.\n\nUniversal Work Queue also supports the following for service requests:\n\nWork Distribution\n\nSR Tasks distributed only after related service request has been distributed\n\nDistribute Only mode\n\nDistribute and Deliver framework\n\nMedia Channel Integration\n\nMedia work providers integrate through the UWQ media plug-in, a de-coupled, real-time media interface. Universal Work Queue provides media support for the following media providers.\n\nAdvanced Inbound Telephony\n\nThe following integration support is provided for Oracle Advanced Inbound Telephony:\n\nActive and passive mode OTM screen pops.\n\nActive mode, OTM classifies a call and routes it to and queues it for a specific agent or agent group.\n\nPassive mode, an ACD routes and queues the call, OTM provides only CTI services to pass call classifications, events and information through UWQ to the agent's softphone and application.\n\nExecute screen pop based on AI classification and Universal work Queue application action mapping.\n\nDirect and route point call transfers between agents with different responsibilities.\n\nDirect inbound call screen pop configuration: call received, on agent answer or on agent answer and end interaction.\n\nNote: Always use the softphone when it is present. Never use your physical telephone unless directed to by either a warning message or your supervisor.\n\nAdvanced Outbound\n\nUniversal Work Queue exposes Advanced Outbound campaigns and facilitates call delivery in:\n\nPredictive mode - voice and application screen pop delivered to agent simultaneously\n\nProgressive - Universal Work Queue coordinates dial when application work item is delivered from Advanced Outbound\n\nPreview - Universal Work Queue inserts phone number into the softphone when work is received from Advanced Outbound; agent dials call when ready.\n\nTime Preview - same as preview mode, except automatically places call if agent does not dial within a set time.\n\nAO manual mode - no CTI, only delivers application work item, agent dials phone manually.\n\nInteraction Blending supports multi-list campaigns.\n\nWeb Callback\n\nUniversal Work Queue supports web callback as an alternate inbound channel. Self-service applications expose a 'call me' button on their web pages. Users request a callback by select the button and entering the callback information (name, phone number, and reason). Oracle Telephony Manager classifies and queues the callback request and distributes it to the next available agent in standard (FIFO) order, by classification.\n\nEmail Center\n\nWith this release, Universal Work Queue provides full support for email. Agents may access email accounts and classifications from within Universal Work Queue to request new email and access unfinished responses from their inbox. Both access methods launch the HTML Email client.\n\nYou can perform the following:\n\nRequest next email - Email Center queues are accessed through the agent workplace in Universal Work Queue\n\nOpen received email - Agents can access inbox from the agent workplace in Universal Work Queue\n\nInteraction Blending Integration\n\nNote: This procedure applies to the blending of media work. It is only required when implementing Oracle Interaction Blending. The System Administrator responsibility is required to define profile options.\n\nOracle Interaction Blending dynamically moves agents between queues and media types based on the service levels for the interaction center. Use the following procedure to integrate Universal Work Queue with Oracle Interaction Blending.\n\nRelated Topics\n\nOracle Interaction Blending Implementation Guide\n\nSet UWQ Profile Options for Oracle Interaction Blending\n\nThe IEU: Blending Style profile is used to enable the blending of media work. When an agent requests work from the Blended node, Universal Work Queue will deliver any of the media type for which an agent is enabled (e.g., inbound, web callbacks, or outbound), based on the service levels for the interaction center.\n\nThe following table features the four blending options:\n\nSetting Description Full Forced Blended Enables the blending of media work.\n\nA Blended node appears in the Universal Work Queue work selector.\n\nThe media node or nodes (e.g., Inbound and Outbound) from which an agent can request work that is specific to the media do not appear. Full Optional Blended Enables media work blending and the appearance of a Blended node and media nodes (e.g., Inbound or Outbound) in the Universal Work Queue window.\n\nThe media node or nodes (e.g., Inbound and Outbound) from which an agent can request work that is specific to the media also appears, allowing an agent to select between the nodes. Not Blended Media work blending is not enabled. A single blending node appears. Simple Forced Blended Provides the ability for passive blending. Simple Optional Blended Provides the ability for enhanced-passive blending. All media nodes appear.\n\nRelated Topics\n\nOracle Interaction Blending Implementation Guide\n\nOracle Interaction Center Server Manager Implementation Guide\n\nAppendix B\n\nSetting System Profile Options\n\nInteraction Center Intelligence Integration\n\nUniversal Work Queue tracks agent session and activity data and reports the information that has been gathered in Oracle Interaction Center Intelligence.\n\nNote: This procedure applies to the session logging of media work and is only required when implementing Oracle Interaction Center Intelligence. Oracle Interaction Center Intelligence must be installed and configured prior to modifying any profiles and the Call Center HTML Administration responsibility must be assigned.\n\nThe Universal Work Queue server records the following information in the database:\n\nAgent login\n\nAgent logout\n\nMedia item requests\n\nMedia item deliveries\n\nUse the following procedure to integrate Universal Work Queue with Oracle Interaction Center Intelligence.\n\nNote: The additional server activity can affect the performance of the Universal Work Queue server.\n\nSee Also\n\nOracle Interaction Center Intelligence Implementation Guide\n\nSet UWQ Server Profile Options for Oracle Interaction Center Intelligence\n\nTo enable Universal Work Queue to provide information to be written to Interaction Center tables, you must enable the following Universal Work Queue profile:\n\nProfile Setting IEU: Session History Logging Yes\n\nNote: The default setting for the profile option is No.\n\nSee Also\n\nOracle Interaction Center Intelligence Implementation Guide\n\nOracle Interaction Center Server Manager Implementation Guide\n\nAppendix C\n\nOracle TeleSales Integration\n\nNote: This procedure is only required when implementing Oracle TeleSales.\n\nUniversal Work Queue can specifically integrate with the Lead and Opportunities modules in Oracle TeleSales. The steps required to integrate Oracle TeleSales include:\n\nInstall Oracle TeleSales applications using Oracle Applications Rapid install\n\nImplement Oracle TeleSales modules, as determined by your enterprise and business requirements\n\nAssigning the appropriate user responsibilities to your agents that enable them to access Oracle Applications functionality related to the Oracle TeleSales modules to be used. For example, if the agent has the Customer Support responsibility assigned, they would be able to access and work items that have been assigned to them and are related their job, such as tasks and service requests.\n\nSetting related Universal Work Queue user profile options to enable or disable site or user access to the functionality provided by Oracle TeleSales module.\n\nSet UWQ Profile Options for Oracle TeleSales\n\nWhen a user logs into Universal Work Queue, the user is enabled to work on the type of work items to which his or her assigned responsibilities provide access unless you limit user access to certain functionality by setting values for the Universal Work Queue profile options. Therefore, if the user's responsibilities enable him or her to access Oracle TeleSales functionality, this profile option does not need to be set unless you want to disable a user's access to the functionality.\n\nThe following Universal Work Queue profile options can be set for users who handle Oracle TeleSales related work items:\n\nProfile Option Setting IEU: Queue: Leads Yes IEU: Queue: Opportunities Yes\n\nCreate a Media Action for Oracle TeleSales\n\nUse this procedure to create a media action for inbound telephony for Oracle TeleSales.\n\nLogin\n\nOracle HTML Applications\n\nResponsibility\n\nCall Center HTML Administration\n\nPrerequisites\n\nReview Configuring Universal Work Queue for Media Work\n\nSteps\n\nFrom the Oracle Interaction Center Server Manager, select the UWQ Media Action tab.\n\nThe Media Classification Action Association page appears.\n\nEnter the following information for the media action.\n\nIn the Media Type field, select Inbound Telephony.\n\nIn the Classification field, type in the name of the media item classification that will trigger the media action (screen pop).\n\nIn the Media Action field, select the business application that will be launched when a media item of the specified type with the specified classification is selected from a work queue.\n\nClick Update.\n\nOracle TeleService Integration\n\nNote: This procedure is only required when implementing Oracle TeleService.\n\nUniversal Work Queue can specifically integrate with Oracle TeleService's Customer Support and Service Requests modules.\n\nThe steps required to integrate Universal Work Queue with the Oracle TeleService include:\n\nInstalling Oracle TeleService applications using Oracle Applications Rapid install.\n\nImplementing the Oracle TeleService modules that will be used by your enterprise.\n\nAssigning the appropriate user responsibilities to your agents that enable them to access Oracle Applications functionality related to the Oracle TeleService modules to be used. Oracle Applications ship with certain defined user responsibilities which are set up to provide user access to product functionality.\n\nThe Customer Support responsibility enable users to access Oracle TeleService product functionality. For example, if the agent has the Customer Support responsibility assigned, they would be able to work items that have been assigned to them and are related their job, such as tasks and service requests.\n\nSetting related Universal Work Queue profile options to enable or disable site or user access to the functionality provided by Oracle TeleService module.\n\nNote: The ability to integrate telephony with Oracle TeleService requires the configuration of media classification using the Service Requests Media function. The Service Requests Media function will be available in a future release.\n\nSee Also\n\nOracle TeleService Implementation Guide\n\nSet UWQ Profile Options for Oracle TeleService\n\nWhen a user logs into Universal Work Queue, the user is enabled to work on the type of work items to which his or her assigned responsibilities provide access unless you limit user access to certain functionality by setting values for the Universal Work Queue profile options. Therefore, if the user's responsibilities enable him or her to access Oracle TeleSales functionality, this profile option does not need to be set unless you want to disable a user's access to the functionality.\n\nFor example, if you are set up with a responsibility that allows you to access and work items, such as tasks or service requests, those items that are open and assigned to you will be delivered and presented in Universal Work Queue. If the profile option IEU: Queue Service Requests is not set to Yes at the user level, work items will not be delivered to the work queue for presentation to the agent.\n\nThe following Universal Work Queue profile option can be set for users who handle Oracle TeleService related work items:\n\nProfile Option Setting IEU: Queue: Service Requests Yes\n\nAdvanced Inbound Integration\n\nNote: This procedure is only required when implementing Oracle Advanced Inbound.\n\nUniversal Work Queue channels media requests, events and information to the softphone and Oracle E-Business applications. Agents use this channel to log into the Oracle Telephony Manager and assign their extension for receipt of inbound calls.\n\nOracle Advanced Inbound is an Interaction Center module which is comprised of the following Interaction Center products:\n\nOracle Telephony Manager\n\nUniversal Work Queue\n\nOracle Interaction Blending\n\nOracle Routing Server\n\nOracle Interactive Voice Response Integration\n\nTogether these products provide the base for managing customer interactions through multiple channels, delivering interactions to appropriate agents when ready.\n\nOracle Advanced Inbound is required to telephony enable business applications in the Oracle E-Business Suite. Telephony-enabled means that the product has the capability of communicating with a telephone system for both inbound and outbound calls via the Computer Telephony Integration (CTI) middleware that handles the messaging between a telephone switch and the user's application.\n\nOracle Advanced Inbound provides an enterprise with the means to improve interaction center productivity through CTI to it's PBX and IVR platforms for application screen pops in the Oracle Applications. It also ensures that the proper customer is routed to the correct agent for multi-media contacts.\n\nThe server architecture of Oracle Advanced Inbound is scalable to run interaction centers with a single physical site or multiple sites. It can also be configured to integrate IVR data. The integration points for Oracle Advanced Inbound to other Interaction Center Modules and products include Oracle Advanced Outbound, Universal Work Queue, and Oracle Interaction Blending.\n\nIn order for a screen pop to occur in Oracle Advanced Inbound, the following tasks need to be completed for Universal Work Queue:\n\nConfigure Universal Work Queue Server\n\nConfigure Universal Work Queue Screen Pop\n\nCreate and Define Universal Work Queue Agents\n\nSet Universal Work Queue Profile Options\n\nAdvanced Inbound Media Support\n\nThe following integration support is provided for Advanced Inbound:\n\nActive and passive mode OTM screen pops.\n\nActive mode, OTM classifies a call and routes it to and queues it for a specific agent or agent group.\n\nPassive mode, an ACD routes and queues the call, OTM provides only CTI services to pass call classifications, events and information through UWQ to the agent's softphone and application.\n\nExecute screen pop based on AI classification and Universal work Queue application action mapping.\n\nDirect and route point call transfers between agents with different responsibilities.\n\nDirect inbound call screen pop configuration: call received, on agent answer or on agent answer and end interaction.Universal Work Queue\n\nConfigure UWQ Server for an Oracle Advanced Inbound Screen Pop\n\nUse this procedure to configure the Universal Work Queue server for an Oracle Advanced Inbound screen pop.\n\nLogin\n\nOracle HTML Applications\n\nResponsibility\n\nCall Center HTML Administration\n\nPrerequisites\n\nReview Oracle Interaction Center Implementation Guide and Appendix C.\n\nSteps\n\nFrom the ICSM tab, select the Server Groups sub-option.\n\nThe Server Group List page appears.\n\nSelect a server group from the available list in the Server Group Name column.\n\nClick Create.\n\nThe Server Details page appears.\n\nIn the Server Name field, enter the name of the Universal Work Queue server.\n\nIn the Server Type field, select Universal Work Queue Server.\n\nClick Save.\n\nNote: You can configure some of the runtime parameters for the Universal Work Queue server. See the appendixes. for a list of the server parameters and values.\n\nCreate a Media Action for Inbound Telephony\n\nUse this procedure to create an inbound telephony media action.\n\nLogin\n\nOracle HTML Applications\n\nResponsibility\n\nCall Center HTML Administration\n\nPrerequisites\n\nReview Configuring Universal Work Queue for Media Work\n\nSteps\n\nIn the Oracle Interaction Center page, select the UWQ Media Action tab.\n\nThe Media Classification Action Association page appears.\n\nEnter the following information for the media action.\n\nIn the Media Type field, select Inbound Telephony.\n\nIn the Classification field, type in the name of the media item classification that will trigger the media action (screen pop).\n\nIn the Media Action field, select the business application that will be launched when a media item of the specified type with the specified classification is selected from a work queue.\n\nClick Update.\n\nSet UWQ Profile Options for Oracle Advanced Inbound\n\nThe following Universal Work Queue profile options need to be set:\n\nProfile Option Setting IEU: Queue: Inbound Telephony Yes IEU: Queue: Media: Telephony Yes\n\nAdvanced Outbound Integration\n\nNote: This procedure is only required when implementing Oracle Advanced Outbound.\n\nIn order for a screen pop to occur for an outbound media item in Oracle Advanced Outbound, the following tasks need to be completed for Universal Work Queue:\n\nCreating a classification rule or rules for outbound media items\n\nConfiguring the media actions by media classification\n\nCall classifications are created as part of the Oracle Telephony Manager configuration. The call classifications and the media types are seeded data from the various Oracle Applications.\n\nAdvanced Outbound Media Support\n\nUniversal Work Queue exposes Advanced Outbound campaigns and facilitates call delivery in:\n\nPredictive mode - voice and application screen pop delivered to agent simultaneously\n\nProgressive - Universal Work Queue coordinates dial when application work item is delivered from Advanced Outbound\n\nPreview - Universal Work Queue inserts phone number into the softphone when work is received from Advanced Outbound; agent dials call when ready.\n\nTime Preview - same as preview mode, except automatically places call if agent does not dial within a set time.\n\nAO manual mode - no CTI, only delivers application work item, agent dials phone manually.\n\nInteraction Blending supports multi-list campaigns.\n\nSet UWQ Profile Options for Oracle Advanced Outbound\n\nThe following profile options need to be set for users in Universal Work Queue:\n\nProfile Option Setting IEU: Queue: Advanced Outbound Telephony Yes IEU: Queue: Media: Telephony Yes\n\nEmail Center Integration\n\nWith this release, Universal Work Queue provides full support for email. Agents may access email accounts and classifications from within Universal Work Queue to request new email and access unfinished responses from their inbox. Both access methods launch the HTML Email client.\n\nYou can perform the following:\n\nRequest next email - Email Center queues are accessed through the agent workplace in Universal Work Queue\n\nOpen received email - Agents can access inbox from the agent workplace in Universal Work Queue\n\nPrior to this release read-only views of email queues and an agent's inbox were displayed in the Universal Work Queue. An agent could view the number of emails in each individual classification queue and also view the list of all emails in their inbox. However they could not either acquire the next message from the queue or open an email from the inbox.\n\nQueued Emails\n\nThe “Queued Emails” view provides a count for the number of e-mail messages queued for a specific account. This view displays only the e-mail accounts to which the agent has been assigned. The agent can also drill down to view the count of e-mail messages queued for each classification under a specific account. The agent can acquire the next -email message for a specific classification or the next -email message across all classifications for that account by double-clicking the appropriate row or by selecting the row and clicking the “Get Work” icon in the menu bar. E-mail messages are always delivered to the agent in a first-in-first-out (FIFO) order. The Email Center Message Component is launched in a separate browser window and the contents of the e-mail message along with suggested responses and matching customer data are displayed in the Reply screen. When the agent ends the interaction by responding to the e-mail message, transferring, rerouting, or deleting it, the Message Component window closes automatically. Because each e-mail message is recorded as a separate interaction, the agent can have more than one message open at the same time.\n\nMy Inbox\n\nThe “My Inbox” view displays the lists of e-mail messages in an agent's inbox. Agents can view e-mail across all accounts to which they are assigned or a list of e-mail messages for a specific account. The following details are displayed for each e-mail message in the agent's inbox:\n\nRead/New – This column indicates whether the message has already been read by the agent or not. An e-mail message could get placed in the agent's inbox if it was automatically routed to the agent, transferred by another agent or assigned by a supervisor. The e-mail message is marked as “New” until the agent views it.\n\nAccount – The account name to which the e-mail message belongs is only displayed in a summary view of ALL e-mail ,essagess in the agent's inbox. This column is not displayed when the agent drills down to a specific e-mail account.\n\nClassification – The predefined group into which the e-mail is classified.\n\nFrom – Sender's -email address\n\nSubject – E-mail message subject\n\nDate – The date the e-mail message was received\n\nPriority – While transferring an e-mail message to another agent, a “high” priority can be assigned to the email.
