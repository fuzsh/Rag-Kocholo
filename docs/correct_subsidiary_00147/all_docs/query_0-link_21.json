        "text": "Yes. Although the new division will exist in the current enterprise structure, you want to keep the Financial Services company as a separate line of business. By creating a separate division, you can manage the costs and reporting separately from the InFusion Corporation. Additionally, you don't have to modify any organizations in the enterprise setup.\n\nDefine a legal entity for each registered company or some other entity recognized by law. Using the legal entity, you can:\n\nRecord assets\n\nRecord liabilities\n\nRecord income\n\nPay transaction taxes\n\nPerform intercompany trading\n\nIn this case, you only need one legal entity.\n\nYou must define the legal entity as a legal employer and payroll statutory unit. As the new division operates only from Germany, you can configure the legal entity to suit Germany's legal and statutory requirements.\n\nNote: You can identify the legal entity as a payroll statutory unit. When you do so, the application transfers the legal reporting unit associated with the legal entity to Oracle Fusion HCM as a tax reporting unit."
