        "text": "Microsoft has acquired Clear Software, which develops integrations and workflow automations that support Oracle, Salesforce and SAP applications. Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed.\n\nThis is technology M&A deal number 666 that ChannelE2E has covered so far in 2021.See all technology M&A deals for 2021 and 2020 listed here.\n\nClear Software Business Background\n\nClear Software, founded by former Deloitte and Accenture consultants, promotes Low-Code Integration Platform-as-a-Service (iPaaS) -- which \"automates tedious tasks and complex workflows across systems,\" the company said.\n\nClear Software, which has 14 employees listed on LinkedIn, has two key products. They are:\n\nClear Software, RPA Software and Microsoft Power\n\nIn some ways Clear Software sounds like Robotic Process Automation (RPA). But instead of competing head-on against RPA software providers, Clear Software has partnerships with Automation Anywhere and UiPath. The reason: ClearWork is typically implemented alongside Automation Anywhere and/or UiPath to \"provide seamless business process orchestration for their bots,\" Clear Software has indicated.\n\nClear Software’s API access and system knowledge will \"strengthen Microsoft Power Platform’s integration with outside systems and accelerate how customers leverage data and processes that reside beyond Microsoft first-party services,\" according to Stephen Siciliano, partner general manager for Mocrosoft Power Automate.\n\n\"We want to make it easier for customers to integrate a variety of systems when they build business applications with Microsoft Power Platform,\" added Siciliano. \"The Clear Software integrations will make it a more seamless experience to use Power Apps and Power Automate to build business applications and automations over complex systems like SAP and Oracle.\""
