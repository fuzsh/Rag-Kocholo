        "text": "The Notable platform enables customers to unify the digital front door on Oracle Health with end-to-end automation that enables customers to engage patients in their care and free up staff capacity\n\nSAN MATEO, Calif., July 10, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Notable, a member of the Oracle PartnerNetwork (OPN), today announced that it has achieved Oracle Validated Integration Expertise across all Oracle Health domains for its bidirectional integration of the Notable platform for healthcare operations. Notable aims to transform patient engagement with deep personalization that captures insights from structured data and unstructured patient data that can exist in the electronic health record (EHR). Beyond that, Notable provides even greater value by transforming operational workflows to help make staff more productive.\n\nNotable helps to eliminate faxes, phone calls, work queues, and data entry for healthcare staff by reading and writing data into discrete fields within Oracle Health's registration, practice management, payment, financial, and clinical systems. This enables customers to provide more simplified care for patients, free up capacity for staff to take on more complex and fulfilling work, and leverage automation to improve financial health.\n\nExpertise is a core tenet of the Oracle PartnerNetwork (OPN) program and allows Oracle partners to highlight their capabilities in a focused area. Ultimately, Expertise is designed to make it easy for customers to identify partners who can deliver quality solutions and minimize risk for their specific needs.\n\nTo achieve the Oracle Validated Integration with Oracle Health Expertise, partners like Notable meet a series of qualifiers, including demonstrating that the integration performs as documented. Learn more about Expertise, including viewing the complete Expertise Catalog, at www.oracle.com/partnernetwork/expertise.\n\nPowered by its intelligence engine, Patient AI, Notable offers an intelligent infrastructure that is designed to personalize the care journey for every patient, automate the work for caregivers and staff, and help improve financial outcomes for providers and payers. This empowers Notable customers to build a personalized digital front door, manage quality and risk, and drive revenue enhancement. For example, one Notable customer using Oracle Health's EHR decreased no-shows by 32%; another using Oracle Health CommunityWorks increased co-payment collections by 17%; and another saved 118 hours of staff time per week from automated intake alone.\n\n\"Healthcare organizations that use Oracle Health as their source of truth are already deploying the Notable platform to create AI-powered digital front doors that automatically prompt the next best action for every patient,\" said Pranay Kapadia, Co-Founder and CEO at Notable. \"Gaining Oracle Validated Integration Expertise signifies that we have done the heavy lifting on the technology side to help ensure our customers will have a fast and seamless integration with their Oracle Health instance.\"\n\n\"Achieving Oracle Validated Integration with Oracle Health Expertise gives our customers the confidence that the integration of the Notable platform is functionally sound and performs as tested,\" said David Hicks, group vice president, Worldwide ISV Cloud Business Development, Oracle. \"For solutions deployed on premises, in the cloud, or both, Oracle Validated Integration applies a rigorous technical review process that helps to reduce deployment risk and improve the user experience of the partner's integrated offering.\"\n\nAbout Notable\n\nNotable is the AI platform for healthcare operations. Deployed at over 10,000 sites of care, Notable automates over a million repetitive workflows every day across Registration and Intake, Scheduling and Referrals, Assistant, Authorizations, Care Gap Closure, and HCC Chart Review. The result: personalized, streamlined care for patients, the elimination of burdensome manual work for caregivers, and improved financial health for healthcare providers.
