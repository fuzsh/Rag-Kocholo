        "text": "JERSEY CITY, NJ and AUSTIN, Texas – September 18, 2023 - Amdocs (NASDAQ: DOX), a leading provider of software and services to communications and media companies, and Oracle today announced the expansion of their global collaboration to empower customers on their journey towards cloud and digital adoption with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI).\n\nThis extended cooperation will empower the communications and media industry’s journey to the cloud by enabling service providers to move their Amdocs classic applications to OCI.

By combining Amdocs’ software with OCI’s secure and high-performance cloud platform, service providers will be able to drive operational efficiency, agility, and innovation. Amdocs customers will be able to maximize their service choices across Oracle’s 45 public cloud regions or OCI Dedicated Region, which helps customers meet requirements for data residency, data sovereignty, or other security and privacy needs.\n\nAs part of a joint go-to-market strategy, Amdocs and Oracle will prioritize the delivery of comprehensive support and services that facilitate seamless cloud transitions, optimization of operations, and the unlocking of new business opportunities for customers.\n\n“Our collaboration with Amdocs brings together two industry leaders with a shared vision to drive innovation and operational efficiency at scale,” said Doug Smith, Senior Vice President, Global Strategic Partnerships, Oracle. “Oracle Cloud for Telcos enables telecommunications providers to become more agile, reduce capital expenditures and operating costs, and establish a flexible foundation for innovation. With Amdocs classic applications now supported on OCI, Amdocs customers can realize these benefits and gain access to a broad ecosystem of cloud services and capabilities, including a set of solutions across core network, OSS/BSS, and IT, to modernize their operations and build for growth.”\n\n“We are delighted to partner with Oracle to bring our customers additional ways to accelerate their journey to the cloud,” said Anthony Goonetilleke, Group President of Technology and Head of Strategy at Amdocs. “By ensuring our customers are able to transition our classic application suite to OCI, we are enabling them to capitalize on a distributed cloud environment and focus on cloud infrastructure components that deliver on their business needs.”\n\nSupporting Resources\n\nGet started with Amdocs and Oracle\n\nLearn more about Oracle Cloud Infrastructure and Oracle Communications\n\nKeep up with Amdocs news by visiting the company’s website\n\nFollow us on Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn and YouTube\n\nAbout Amdocs\n\nAmdocs helps those who build the future to make it amazing.
