        "text": "Tokyo and Redwood Shores, Calif., July 06, 2016\n\nFujitsu Limited, Oracle Corporation, and Oracle Corporation Japan today announced that they have agreed to form a new strategic alliance to deliver enterprise-grade, world-class cloud services to customers in Japan and their subsidiaries around the world.\n\nIn order to take advantage of cloud computing to speed innovation, reduce costs and drive business growth, organizations need IT partners that can deliver the performance, security and management capabilities that are demanded by enterprise workloads. To help organizations in Japan capitalize on this opportunity and confidently move enterprise workloads to the cloud, Oracle Cloud Application and Platform services - such as Oracle Database Cloud Service and Oracle Human Capital Management (HCM) Cloud - will be powered by Fujitsu's datacenters in Japan. Under the new strategic alliance, Fujitsu will work to drive sales of robust cloud offerings to companies in Japan and their subsidiaries around the world.\n\nBy bringing Oracle Cloud Application and Platform services to FUJITSU Cloud Service K5, Fujitsu and Oracle will provide a high-performance cloud environment to meet the IT and business needs of customers. Specifically, Fujitsu will install the Oracle Cloud services in its datacenters in Japan and connect them to its K5 service in order to deliver enterprise-grade cloud services. The first Oracle Cloud Application that will be offered to Fujitsu customers under the joint offering is Oracle HCM Cloud. As part of the agreement, Fujitsu will implement Oracle HCM Cloud to gain unprecedented insight into its workforce throughout the company’s worldwide network of offices.\n\n\"We at Fujitsu support the digital transformation of our customers, and aim to contribute to optimized customer systems and business growth with the roll out of our Digital Business Platform MetaArc,\" said Shingo Kagawa, SEVP, Head of Digital Services Business & CTO, Fujitsu Limited. \"In particular, we offer the core cloud service on MetaArc, K5, which addresses systems of engagement (SoE)(1) and systems of record (SoR)(2). Oracle is a leader in Japan's database market segment and possesses strong capabilities in the SoR domain. Now, as we look to strengthen MetaArc and K5, taking part in this strategic alliance with Oracle will work to meet the cloud needs of our customers.\"\n\n\"In order to realize the full business potential of cloud computing, organizations need secure, reliable and high-performing cloud solutions,\" said Edward Screven, Chief Corporate Architect, Oracle. \"For over three decades, Oracle and Fujitsu have worked together using our combined R&D, product depth and global reach to create innovative solutions enabling customers to scale their organizations and achieve a competitive advantage. Oracle's new strategic alliance with Fujitsu will allow companies in Japan to take advantage of an integrated cloud offering to support their transition to the cloud.\"\n\n\"We strongly believe this cloud alliance will support Japanese companies to drive digital transformation,” said Hiroshige Sugihara, President and CEO, Oracle Corporation Japan. “This will be a gateway for customers to achieve standardization, modernization, and globalization. This initiative will differentiate us from other cloud providers by emphasizing real enterprise cloud solutions, while offering Japanese companies access to best of breed technology in the new Cloud era.\"\n\nThe combination of these innovative solutions including Oracle Database Cloud Service, Oracle HCM Cloud, and K5, will enable Fujitsu and Oracle to deliver mission critical systems over a cloud environment within Fujitsu's datacenters while maintaining the high levels of performance and reliability that had previously been achieved in on-premise environments. Furthermore, with the Oracle Cloud provided from Fujitsu's state-of-the-art datacenters, which boast a high level of capabilities in Japan, customers using K5 or Fujitsu's hosting services will have access to use invaluable cloud services.\n\nTrademarks\n\nOracle and Java are registered trademarks of Oracle and/or its affiliates in the US and other countries. Other names may be trademarks of their respective owners. This press release is solely for the purpose of providing information and does not constitute an implied contract.\n\nFujitsu and Oracle Alliance History\n\nSince entering into a database OEM contract in 1989, the two companies have been providing customers with optimal solutions. Currently, as an Oracle Partner Network (OPN) Diamond level partner, Fujitsu is providing system integration services worldwide. In addition, in the SPARC/Solaris server business, Fujitsu entered into a sales contract with Sun Microsystems in 1983 and a development agreement for SPARC chips in 1988, and further strengthened the relationship with Sun Microsystems through a Solaris OEM contract in 1993. Since Oracle's subsequent acquisition of Sun Microsystems, the two companies have maintained a close, collaborative relationship to the present day."
