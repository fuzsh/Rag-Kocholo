        "text": "On July 22, 2024, Divya Khossla shared a poignant tribute on Instagram to remember Tishaa Kumar, the daughter of T-Series co-owner Krishan Kumar. Tishaa, who passed away at the young age of 20 after a prolonged battle with cancer, was fondly remembered by her family and friends.\n\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by Divya khossla (@divyakhossla)\n\nDivya Khossla, who is married to Bhushan Kumar, took to social media to express her grief and share cherished memories of Tishaa. In her heartfelt post, Divya wrote, \"Tishaa, you will remain in our hearts forever.\" Accompanying her message were pictures of happier times, showing the two enjoying vacations and light-hearted moments together. One video even depicted Tishaa enjoying a joyous moment, a testament to her vibrant spirit despite her illness.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nTishaa Kumar's passing has deeply affected her family, who requested privacy during this difficult time. The family released a statement through T-Series, acknowledging the immense loss and asking for respect as they mourn. The statement read, \"Tishaa Kumar, daughter of Krishan Kumar, passed away yesterday after a prolonged battle with an illness. This is a difficult time for the family, and we kindly request that the familyâ€™s privacy is respected.\"\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe final rites for Tishaa were conducted in Mumbai, where numerous friends and celebrities paid their last respects. The city was waterlogged, yet many braved the conditions to be present, a reflection of the profound impact Tishaa had on those around her.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nTishaa's cousin, Bhushan Kumar, also expressed his sorrow and shared memories of their time together. The bond within the Kumar family is evidently strong, and the loss of Tishaa has left a significant void.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nBorn on September 6, 2003, to Krishan and Tanya Singh, Tishaa led a relatively private life, away from the public eye. Despite this, she made occasional appearances at T-Series film screenings and other family events. Her last public appearance was in November 2023 at the screening of Sandeep Reddy Vanga's film \"Animal,\" where she accompanied her father on the red carpet.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nKrishan Kumar, known for his role in the 1995 film \"Bewafa Sanam,\" and his subsequent success as a producer and co-owner of T-Series, faced a heartbreaking loss with the passing of his daughter. The Kumar family, including Bhushan Kumar, who took over the reins of T-Series after the tragic demise of his father Gulshan Kumar, has always been close-knit. The loss of Tishaa is a profound blow to the family.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAs the Kumar family navigates through this period of mourning, the outpouring of support and condolences from friends, colleagues, and fans is a reminder of the love and respect Tishaa garnered during her life. Her memory will undoubtedly remain in the hearts of those who knew her, cherished by the happy moments she shared and the courage she displayed in her fight against cancer."
