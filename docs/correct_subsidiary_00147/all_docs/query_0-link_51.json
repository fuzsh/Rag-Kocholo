        "text": "Company Profile\n\nAcme Packet is a company based in Bedford, Massachusetts which produces and markets session border controllers (SBCs), multiservice security gateways (MSGs) and session routing proxies (SRPs). It is a public company incorporated in Delaware. Acme Packet customers include 89 of the largest 100 service providers in the world. Acme Packet employs over 761 individuals in 31 countries. In 2011 The Boston Globe named Acme Packet one of the best places to work in Massachusetts. In 2002, ACME Packet Net-Net family of Session Aware Networking products won SUPERQuest award for most promising IP/application services technology for public networks at SUPERCOMM 2002. On February 4, 2013, Oracle Corporation announced that it was to acquire Acme Packet for US$2.1 billion.\n\nOracle Enterprise Session Border Controller\n\nOracleâs Enterprise Session Border Controller (ESBC) connects disparate Internet Protocol (IP) communications networks while mitigating security threats, curing interoperability problems, and ensuring reliable communications. It protects and controls realtime voice, video, and Unified Communications (UC) as they traverse IP network borders.\n\nBusinesses install the Oracle ESBC at Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) network borders where enterprise communications systems interface with public network services or where disparate multivendor systems must be managed. They use the products to:\n\nConnect to SIP trunking services and the internet\n\nAccess cloud communications services\n\nCommunicate securely with remote workers\n\nManage sessions across a multivendor UC environment\n\nConnect contact center locations and business process outsourcing (BPO) services\n\nOracle Communications Application Session Controller\n\nOracle Communications Application Session Controller is an integrated communications controller and web application server that enables service providers, enterprises, and contact centers to orchestrate and control realtime voice and video communications using web services. Advanced serverbased software, Oracle Communications Application Session Controller enables real-time communications between business applications and communications systems based on Session Initiation Protocol (SIP).\n\nOracle Communications Application Session Controller allows application developers to easily utilize service-oriented architecture (SOA) development tools and web service frameworks to establish and control real-time communication sessions. Using Representational State Transfer (REST) or Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) APIs, business application developers can access Oracle Communications Application Session Controllerâs communication interworking services, shielding them from complex SIP signaling protocols. Developers can quickly integrate rich communication services without needing to understand underlying IP communication procedures and protocols, giving them more time to focus on developing core business processes.\n\nOracle Communications WebRTC Session Controller\n\nVoice communications are increasingly shifting to web and IP-based applications that are outside of traditional telephony networks. Enterprise users want to access their unified communications applications with their own Internet-connected mobile devices and consumers increasingly prefer Internet-based communications channels to access contact centers.\n\nTo address these challenges, CSPs and enterprises are beginning to deploy innovative new applications based on a protocol known as WebRTC. WebRTC is an emerging Internet standard that equips any device with a supported web browser with real-time communications (RTC) capabilities â such as voice calling, video or screen sharing â via simple application programming interfaces (APIs) without requiring users to download plug-ins.\n\nOracle addresses these challenges with a purpose-built WebRTC media/signaling engine and a client-side Software Development Kit (SDK) solution. The Oracle Communications WebRTC Session Controller bridges the web to the SIP/IMS network with secure client-network management, highly reliable fault resilient web to SIP session processing, and full WebRTC device to SIP network interoperability.\n\nOracle Enterprise Session Border Controller\n\nOracle Communications Application Session Controller\n\nOracle Communications WebRTC Session Controller"
