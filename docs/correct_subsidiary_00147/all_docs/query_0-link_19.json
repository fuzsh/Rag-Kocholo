        "text": "Oracle Corp., the number one choice for e- business, and Phone.com (Nasdaq: PHCM), the leader in Wireless Application Protocol (WAP) infrastructure software for wireless networks, today announced they are working together to leverage Oracle's knowledge of the enterprise and Phone.com's expertise in the wireless Internet arena. This collaboration by the two leaders will provide an end-to-end solution for enabling Internet and Intranet information access and services from wireless handsets. Oracle® Portal-to-Go (which was announced today) works seamlessly with Phone.com's WAP product family to enable the design and deployment of wireless Internet and Intranet portals.\n\n\"We expect that the introduction of Oracle Portal-to-Go will propel the Wireless Application Protocol (WAP) standard and adoption of wireless Internet access and services,\" said Ben Linder, vice president of Marketing for Phone.com. \"Oracle Portal-to-Go is complementary to Phone.com's UP.Link Server, UP.Browser microbrowser, and MyPhone Service. While MyPhone is a service offering for carriers operated by Phone.com, Oracle Portal-to-Go is available to carriers who wish to build and operate services themselves.\"\n\nPhone.com and Oracle are working together to empower mobile phone subscribers to directly and instantly perform wireless e-business from wireless phones which include a WAP compatible microbrowser such as the Phone.com® UP.Browser. Oracle Portal-to-Go includes a toolkit wireless network operators can use to rapidly build Internet portals. The companies intend to approach mutual customers through joint business development and marketing efforts. Wireless carriers will benefit from the ability to develop their own branded portal sites for wireless subscribers.\n\n\"Phone.com provides a combined best-of-breed WAP browser, WAP gateway and WAP development environment for bringing Oracle Portal-to-Go services live on a wireless network,\" said Denise Lahey, vice president of the Mobile and Embedded Products Division at Oracle. \"By working closely with Phone.com we can offer wireless carriers the unique benefits of an easy-to-use UP.Browser interface while leveraging all the performance, scalability and reliability of a solution built with Oracle.\"\n\nAbout Oracle\n\nOracle Corporation is the world's leading supplier of software for information management, and the world's second largest software company. With annual revenues of more than $9.1 billion, the company offers its database, application server, tools and application products, along with related consulting, education and support services, in more than 145 countries around the world.\n\nFor more information about Oracle, please call 650/506-7000. Oracle's World Wide Web address is (URL) http://www.oracle.com/.\n\nAbout Phone.com\n\nPhone.com, Inc. is a leading provider of software and sevices that enables the delivery of Internet-based services to mass-market wireless telephones. Using its software, wireless subscribers have access to Internet- and corporate intranet-based services, including Email, news, stocks, weather, travel and sports.

Potential risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, Phone.com's limited operating history, potential fluctuations in Phone.com's operating results, uncertainties related to the Phone.com's long sales cycle and reliance on a small number of customers, Phone.com's dependence on the acceptance of its products by network operators and wireless subscribers, Phone.com's ability to adequately address the rapidly-evolving market for delivery of Internet-based services through wireless telephones, the need to achieve widespread integration of Phone.com's browser in wireless telephones, competition from companies with substantially greater financial, technical, marketing and distribution resources and the ability of Phone.com to manage a complex set of engineering, marketing and distribution relationships. Further information regarding these and other risks is included in Phone.com's annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1999 and in its other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission."
