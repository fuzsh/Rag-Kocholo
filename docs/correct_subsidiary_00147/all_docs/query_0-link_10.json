The workbench uses a configuration interview, to review the decisions and operational questions you make about setting up your enterprise using Oracle HRMS.\n\nThe Configuration Workbench configuration process suggests a combination of business groups and organizations to satisfy your integrated legal, financial, organization and employee management needs using Oracle HRMS. The suggested combination of business groups and organizations uses one of the following configuration models:\n\nA single operating company working within the legislative rules of a single country.\n\nA single operating company working within the legislative rules of multiple countries.\n\nMultiple operating companies working within the legislative rules of a single country.\n\nMultiple operating companies working within the legislative rules of multiple countries.\n\nThese configuration models define the basic information model to represent any enterprise. You can add other location and internal work structures that represent your internal organization or reporting structures for specific legal, personnel, and financial management requirements.\n\nManaging your Work Structures Using Graphical Charting Capabilities\n\nYou can plan and implement new working structures ahead of time using graphical charts. The hierarchy diagrammer enables you to create organization and position hierarchies to reflect reporting lines and control access to information in your enterprise. See:\n\nOrganization Hierarchies\n\nPosition Hierarchies\n\nThe hierarchy diagrammers use the same security model as the other windows in Oracle HRMS and access to them is restricted by your responsibility.\n\nReporting on Organization Structures\n\nOracle HRMS and Oracle HRMSi enable you to produce several reports to satisfy the statutory requirements for your legislation and meet your business analysis needs. For example:\n\nOracle HRMS enables employers in the U.S. to generate reports to comply with the VETS-100 government reporting requirements. The report lists the number of special disabled and Vietnam era veterans a U.S. enterprise employs in each of the nine job categories.\n\nOracle HRMS provides you with a standard organization hierarchy report to view the relationships between organizations and their managers within a hierarchy.\n\nOracle HRMSi offers the Organization Separation Report to investigate the performance of your best and worst organizations based on the workforce changes in an organization.\n\nReporting Costs for Your Organization Structures\n\nWith the Oracle eBusiness suite of applications, you can automatically create HR organizations to corresponding company cost center combinations that exist in your GL account combinations. You can use the management reporting functionality in Daily Business Intelligence (DBI) to report on financials information, such as the costs, revenues, and expenses for your organization structures.\n\nKey Concepts\n\nTo effectively use Oracle HRMS for organization management, see:\n\nKey Concepts for Representing Enterprises\n\nOrganization Classifications\n\nExtending the Enterprise Framework\n\nConfiguration Models for Your Enterprise Framework\n\nLocations\n\nOrganization Hierarchies\n\nDefaults for the Business Group\n\nInternal Organizations and Cost Centers\n\nOrganization Structures\n\nOracle HRMS can represent all the components of your enterprise. You can record the physical locations where your employees work and all the different departments and sections that make up your enterprise. You can even record information about other organizations you work with, such as recruitment agencies or tax authorities.\n\nSee: Extending the Enterprise Framework\n\nYou can view and edit hierarchy diagrams for organizations and positions using:\n\nThe Organization Hierarchy Diagrammer\n\nThe Position Hierarchy Diagrammer\n\nHow do you represent your enterprise as an employer?\n\nYou can use the GRE/Legal Entity and Employer organization classifications to represent the employer in each country you do business. If you use the Configuration Workbench to set up your organization structures, then an employer organization is set up in each country your enterprise operates.\n\nIn US and Canada, how do you manage government reporting?\n\nOracle HRMS enables you to set up one or more Government Reporting Entities (GREs) within each of your Business Groups. GREs represent an employer the government recognizes as being responsible for paying employees and for filing a variety of reports that government agencies require. If your enterprise has a single Employer Identification Number from the Internal Revenue Service, your Business Group and GRE are the same organization.\n\nFor Canada, you also need to set up Provincial Reporting Establishments (PREs). GREs and PREs represent an employer the governments recognise as being responsible for paying employees and for filing a variety of reports. There must be a GRE for each Business Number that the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) assigns to an employer. There must be a PRE for each Quebec Identification Number that the Ministere du Revenu assigns to an employer. If your enterprise has a single Business Number from the CRA and a single Quebec Identification Number, your Business Group, GRE and PRE are the same organization.\n\nHow do you represent the structure of an enterprise?\n\nOracle HRMS enables you to build a model of your enterprise showing all the reporting lines and other hierarchical relationships. You can set up reporting hierarchies reflecting all the reporting lines in your enterprise, as established in organization charts.\n\nThe Configuration Workbench creates an enterprise structure that suits your operational (management and reporting), and geographical requirements. You can use the enterprise structure the workbench sets up as the basic infrastructure of your company. Once the basic structure is set up, you can define further locations and organizations and add them to your organization hierarchy.\n\nDo I need to run a separate program to create hierarchy diagrams?\n\nNo. The hierarchy diagrammers are standard Oracle HRMS windows, with the addition of a graphical area. They work together with the Organization Hierarchy window and Position Hierarchy window so you can create basic hierarchies using these windows and then make intuitive drag-and-drop changes using the diagrammers.\n\nAny changes made using the hierarchy diagrammers are reflected in the hierarchy windows, and are saved in your database.\n\nCan I create multiple versions of a hierarchy, and model different business scenarios?\n\nYes. You can use the diagrammers together with the organization and position hierarchy windows to:\n\nCreate new versions of existing hierarchies\n\nCreate copies of existing hierarchies\n\nCreate future-dated hierarchies to prepare for reorganizations in advance\n\nCan I print the graphical versions of the hierarchies?\n\nYes. You can print pictorial representations of organization and position hierarchies.\n\nCan I create hierarchies that contain organizations from multiple business groups?\n\nYes. If you have the appropriate security access to more than one business group, you can include organizations from more than one business group in your hierarchy.\n\nOrganizations\n\nKey Concepts for Representing Enterprises\n\nYou represent your enterprise using key organization structures in Oracle HRMS. These structures provide the framework so you can perform legal reporting, financial control, and management reporting. You can set up these organization structures yourself, or use the Configuration Workbench.\n\nThe Configuration Workbench delivers an integrated configuration management toolset for HR systems and assists in the evaluation, configuration, deployment, and maintenance of HR applications. The workbench suggests a basic structure of organizations for your enterprise based on configuration models.\n\nSee: Configuration Models for Your Enterprise Framework\n\nOnce the basic enterprise structure is set up, you add the additional organizations and locations that exist in your enterprise. You define the internal organizations that represent your internal divisions and departments, and you define the external organizations that represent the organizations outside of your enterprise. For example, you can set up an external organization to represent the tax office for which your enterprise uses for reporting purposes.\n\nYou can use organizations to represent many levels of your enterprise, from the highest level of organization that represents the whole enterprise, to the lowest level of organization that represents a section or department.\n\nSee: Extending the Enterprise Framework\n\nSee: Organization Classifications\n\nSee: Setting Up Organizations\n\nBusiness Group\n\nThe business group represents a country in which your enterprise operates. You create it as an organization in Oracle HRMS, but it does not represent a specific organization within your enterprise structure, and you do not include it in your organization hierarchies. A business group enables you to group and manage data in accordance with the rules and reporting requirements of each country, and to control access to data.\n\nThe critical factors for deciding when to use a separate business group, or an international business group, are based on the following factors:\n\nIf you use Oracle Payroll\n\nThe number of people you employ in a country\n\nIf you require legislative support for Oracle HR\n\nGenerally the laws are so different in each country that to be compliant, there must be a different business group for each country in which an enterprise has employees.\n\nOperating Company\n\nAn operating company represents a division or line of business within your enterprise that is legally registered for reporting in at least one country. An operating company is a holding company, a company within a company.\n\nUltimate Legal Entity\n\nThe ultimate legal entity represents the enterprise, and typically, the enterprise is the highest (global) level of a business organization. The ultimate legal entity is the parent company or organization for all its subsidiaries and divisions. Oracle HRMS represents the ultimate legal entity with the GRE/Legal Entity organization classification.\n\nLegal Entity/Employer\n\nA legal entity represents the designated legal employer for all employment-related activities. The legal authorities in a country recognize this organization as a separate employer. In an organization hierarchy, a legal entity may report to an operating company or to the ultimate legal entity.\n\nA legal employer is a legal entity that is responsible for employing people in a particular country. Therefore, if you employ people in a country, then you must have at least one organization classified as a legal entity and a legal employer.\n\nThe Configuration Workbench classifies an organization as a GRE/Legal Entity where your enterprise operates in a country, and classifies it as an Employer if you employ people in that country also. For example, you can have a legal entity in a country where you do business, but do not employ people in that country.\n\nConsolidated Legal Entity\n\nA consolidated legal entity acts on behalf of multiple operating companies that are not legally registered, or simply on behalf of the enterprise in a country. You typically use the consolidated legal entity for when you have multiple operating companies in your enterprise, but for the purposes of consolidation, you group the information into one organization. For management reporting purposes, the organizations below the consolidated legal entity in an organization hierarchy, such as, your departments and sections, can report to any organization in the enterprise. However, for legal reporting purposes, they report up to the consolidated legal entity.\n\nFor information on how to model your enterprise using the key organization structures, see: Configuration Models for Your Enterprise Framework\n\nExtending the Enterprise Framework\n\nAfter you or the Configuration Workbench has set up your basic enterprise framework, you can extend it by setting up the additional organization structures that exist for your enterprise. You use internal organizations to represent the internal divisions or departments, and external organizations to represent the organizations outside of your enterprise for reporting or third-party payment purposes. External organizations can appear in your organization hierarchies together with internal organizations, and are defined in the same way.\n\nSee: Key Concepts for Representing Enterprises\n\nYou use classifications to define the purpose of an organization, see: Organization Classifications\n\nBasic Enterprise Structure\n\nThe following diagram demonstrates a basic enterprise structure, based on the multiple operating companies in one country configuration model. You generate the essential framework of your enterprise using the configuration model that suits your enterprise. The Configuration Workbench defines the basic structure of organizations in your enterprise and places them in an organization hierarchy.\n\nSee: Key Concepts for Representing Enterprises\n\nBasic Enterprise Structure\n\nThe preceding diagram displays an enterprise based in the U.S. with four separate divisions represented by Companies 1 - 4. The Legal Employers are responsible for employing people and represent the designated employers for all employment-related activities.\n\nThe following diagrams are examples of how you can set up and include additional internal and external organizations in your organization hierarchy. Each diagram uses a separate legal employer to explain how you can set up different organizations for different purposes. You can, however, use the same legal employer for each type of setup. You will probably use a combination of the following examples.\n\nReporting Structures Organization Setup\n\nThe organization setup in the preceding diagram represents a simplified structure of the different levels of management reporting. If your management reporting structures and your enterprise's costs are the same, then you can use roll-up reporting capabilities. For example, if you associate a cost center to an HR organization, you can record the payroll costs of the employees assigned to that organization, and the organizations below it in the hierarchy.\n\nSee: Internal Organizations and Cost Centers\n\nYou can also represent multiple or matrix reporting relationships by setting up one of more organization hierarchies. The organizations you set up can appear in one or several different hierarchies. The Configuration Workbench enables you to add new organizations on top of the basic enterprise structure using worksheets. You can then use the hierarchy diagrammers in Oracle HR to add or change the reporting lines.\n\nSee: Moving Organizations or Positions in a Hierarchy\n\nBenefit Providers and Workers Representation Organization Setup\n\nYou can set up organizations to represent the benefit providers that supply benefits to the people in your enterprise. For example, in the preceding diagram, a pension provider and a medical/health provider are set up as external organizations in the business group. This set up provides your workforce in the Department and Section organizations with the opportunity to make pension contributions and receive medical cover from the benefit providers.\n\nA trade union and bargaining unit are also set up as external organizations in the business group. These organizations represent the workers' representative bodies.\n\nFor more information on the classifications you can choose for your organizations, see: Organization Classifications\n\nGovernment Reporting Organization Setup\n\nUsing the preceding diagram as an example, you use external organizations to represent the government reporting offices outside of your enterprise, such as social insurance providers, tax offices, and establishments. Linking the external organizations to your internal organizations enables:\n\nYour workforce to inherit the information that the external organizations provide.\n\nYou to efficiently record all of the government reporting details at the legal employer level, rather than at the person level.\n\nYou to meet statutory reporting requirements.\n\nOrganization Classifications\n\nOrganization classifications define the purpose of an organization and its functionality within Oracle HRMS. The classifications you assign to an organization control the additional information you can set up at the organization level. The Configuration Workbench automatically assigns the appropriate classifications to the organizations it creates.\n\nFor more information on the key organization structures you use to represent your enterprise, see: Key Concepts for Representing Enterprises\n\nYou can define one organization with multiple classifications or you can define separate organizations to represent different types of entity. For example, you can classify an organization as a legal entity as well as an HR organization if it's the same organization. If they are different, then you create two organizations.\n\nNote: Oracle HRMS enables you to install your own additional information types for classifications.\n\nYou can select the following classifications in the Organization window, depending on your legislation:\n\nAll Legislations\n\nAll legislations can use the following classifications:\n\nBusiness Group: Use this classification to group, manage, and control access to data in accordance with the rules and reporting requirements of a country.\n\nOperating Company: An operating company represents a division or line of business within your enterprise that is legally registered for reporting in at least one country.\n\nGRE/Legal Entity: Use this classification to represent the following organizations:\n\nUltimate Legal Entity: this represents the enterprise, and typically, the enterprise is the highest (global) level of a business organization.\n\nLegal Entity: this represents the designated legal employer for all employment-related activities. The legal authorities in a country recognize this organization as a separate employer. In an organization hierarchy, a legal entity may report to an operating company or to the ultimate legal entity.\n\nConsolidated Legal Entity: this organization acts on behalf of multiple operating companies that are not legally registered, or simply on behalf of the enterprise in a country.\n\nFor Chinese users only: Your organization hierarchy must contain at least one GRE with corporate and employer information. Statutory reporting requires this information.\n\nEmployer: Use this along with the GRE/Legal Entity classification to define an organization as a legal entity that is responsible for employing people in a particular country.\n\nFor Indian users only: Your organization hierarchy must contain at least one GRE with income tax, challan bank, tax declaration and representative details. This information is used for statutory reporting.\n\nHR Organization: Use this classification for all organizations to which you want to assign employees and contingent workers.\n\nPayee Organization: Use this when defining an external organization that is the recipient of a third party payment from an employee, for example a court-ordered payment. You can then select this organization on the Personal Payment Method window when entering a third party payment method.\n\nBargaining Association: Use this when defining an organization that is involved in negotiating a collective agreement. A bargaining association could be any organization representing the employees in negotiations, for example a trade union. The UK legislation also enables you to select a bargaining association in the Union Processing window to set up a union element.\n\nRepresentative Body: Use this when defining a representative body. This may be a body defined in legislation, such as a European Works Council, or may be defined by the employer, such as a Sports and Social Club.\n\nDisability Organization: Use this when defining an external organization with which employee disabilities are registered.\n\nMedical Service Provider: Use this when defining an organization that provides any medical services, such as medical assessments, to the people in your enterprise.\n\nConstituency: Use this to define a constituency to group together workers eligible to vote for particular elections.\n\nCompany Cost Center: Use this to define organizations in Oracle HRMS that map to cost centers in Oracle GL. You can set up your application so that whenever a cost center is defined in GL, a corresponding organization with this classification is defined automatically.\n\nProfessional Body Information: Use this to define an organization that is a professional body. Organizations with this classification are available to assign to people in the Qualifications window.\n\nOperating Unit : Use the operating unit organization classification if you also use Multi-Org applications. You can associate an operating unit with an HR Organization. The application uses the HR Organization to find the operating unit to which a person belongs.\n\nUS Legislation\n\nThe US legislation can use the following classifications:\n\nReporting Establishment, Corporate Headquarters, or AAP Organization: Use these when defining reporting organizations, that is, organizations required for the production of certain reports for government agencies.\n\nParent Entity: Use this when defining an organization to be included at the top level of an establishment hierarchy. You can then use the hierarchy when producing certain reports for government agencies.\n\nIf you are assigning this classification to a Business Group, you must assign it to your default Business Group, that is the one defined in your security profile. If you do not, then your data will not be visible when you attempt to create your hierarchy in the Generic Hierarchy window.\n\nBenefits Carrier, Workers' Compensation Carrier, or Beneficiary Organization: Use these when defining an external organization belonging in one of these classifications. You can then select the organization when defining a benefit, entering information for Workers' Compensation calculations, or recording beneficiaries employees have named for certain benefits.\n\nThe Federal legislation can also use the Beneficiary Organization classification.\n\nUK Legislation\n\nThe UK legislation can use the Education Authority classification to define a Local Education Authority (LEA) that is responsible for education within that council's jurisdiction.\n\nCanadian Legislation\n\nThe Canadian legislation can use the following classifications:\n\nProvincial Medical Carrier: Use this to define a medical carrier for a province.\n\nProvincial Reporting Establishment: Use this to represent employees in the province of Quebec.\n\nFrench Legislation\n\nThe French legislation can use the following classifications:\n\nCompany: records one or more companies in your business group. A company is a legal entity registered to \"Registre du Commerce et des Societes\". You must have at least one company.\n\nEstablishment: identifies the organization that serves as the legal point of contact for settling any disputes and manages the personal details of the workforce.\n\nNote: Do not classify an organization as both a company and an establishment; create two separate organizations.\n\nURSSAF Center or ASSEDIC Center: specifies an external organization that is a Social Security organization. You can select the organization when entering additional organization information for an establishment. You can also select URSSAF organizations when entering additional organization information for a company.\n\nInsurance Provider or Pension Provider: defines an external organization that provides insurance or pensions. You can select the organization when entering additional organization information for a company or an establishment.\n\nOPACIF or OPCA: specifies an external organization that collects the company's yearly training contribution.\n\nCPAM: identifies an external organization as a CPAM office. You can select the organization when entering employment information in the People window.\n\nPublic Sector Other External Organization: records details of the various types of external organizations with whom public-sector companies deal. Be sure to create organizations with this classification as external organizations.\n\nGrouping of Employers: identifies the employers (normally establishments) who have decided to group together to make it easier to lend each other workforce and also to list the employees, contingent workers, and employees on loan for an establishment from that grouping in the Personnel Registry report.\n\nTax Group: defines an external tax office.\n\nDutch Legislation\n\nThe Dutch legislation can use the following classifications:\n\nDutch UWV Organization: Use this to indicate if your organization is a social insurance provider.

One standard purpose for a generic hierarchy is to supply input parameters to a generic purge process you perform on temporary tables. With appropriate access rights, you can also design your own generic hierarchies from scratch. You can extend predefined hierarchy and node types, using any combination of HRMS data.\n\nYou can use the flexibility of generic hierarchies to correlate information across business groups, specifying combinations of people, jobs, competencies, grades, locations, training, or other structures, with precise scope. You can reuse hierarchies, delivering comparable and consistent information limited only by your maintenance of the hierarchies. You can process specific groupings of workers, process flexfield data, or trigger Oracle Alerts or Workflow. Here are some examples of business questions you can address using generic hierarchies:\n\nWhat is the competency hierarchy for a given job?\n\nWho is qualified for which job?\n\nWho can take leave on a given date?\n\nWhat training is available in which location, for which jobs?\n\nWhat objectives apply to which job?\n\nDefining and Maintaining Generic Hierarchies\n\nDefining a New Hierarchy\n\nYou create or maintain generic hierarchies in the Generic Hierarchies pages. You define a new hierarchy in three stages:\n\nCreate a hierarchy based on a predefined or user-defined hierarchy type.\n\nEnter information about the initial version of the hierarchy and specify effective dates.\n\nNote: Some government-mandated reports, such as Multiple Work Site in the US, require that you submit the report within a specified date range. When you create the hierarchy, enter an effective date and end date to match or encompass that range.\n\nYou cannot create a hierarchy version with an effective date range that overlaps another version.\n\nEnter node information, based on predefined or user-defined node types.\n\nHierarchy Types and Node Types\n\nThe top node is the hierarchy type itself you create in the Generic Hierarchies pages, bearing a user-defined name, such as Competencies or Job Objectives. You define node types and add them to your hierarchy structure as child nodes, to specify the kind of information you want to include on each level. You can group related categories of nodes on the same level. For example, you can define Personal, Programming, and Communication node types, and include them on the same level in a competencies hierarchy. Validation is optional, but you must link a value set to a node type if you want to validate the data. Contact your system administrator to obtain access to the Maintain Hierarchy Types module by attaching the self-service menu PQH_GHR_MENU to your responsibility.\n\nFor example, the structure of the predefined Establishment Hierarchy type (\"VETS, EEO, AAP, OSHA, Multi Work Sites\") specifies that the top node must be a Parent Entity. The value set for a Parent Entity node type contains organizations with the classification of Parent Entity. Subordinate nodes must be an Establishment or a Location. The value set for the Location node type contains locations that store report information in a Location EIT.\n\nHierarchy Versions\n\nYou can specify a status of Active or Inactive for your hierarchy version. You can create a new version of an existing hierarchy, preserving only its structure. Or you can duplicate an existing version, preserving both its structure and data.\n\nNote: If you change a hierarchy after using it for government-mandated reports, create and save a new version. This enables you to use the old version to recreate old reports retrospectively, in compliance with applicable laws.\n\nExample: City Allowance Rates Hierarchy\n\nThe figure below is an example of a hierarchy that provides input data for travel expense reports, correlating allowance rates with cities. Because it is unlikely that travel destinations always correspond with organization locations, this example uses no validation or value sets.\n\nConfiguration Models for Your Enterprise Framework\n\nThe first step in any configuration is to decide what organization structures your enterprise requires. To help you decide, you can use the following best practice configuration models:\n\nModel 1: A single operating company in one country\n\nModel 2: A single operating company in multiple countries\n\nModel 3: Multiple operating companies in one country\n\nModel 4: Multiple operating companies in multiple countries\n\nThese models deal with integration points between the different applications and the requirements of different industries and geographies. They can help you choose the right organization structures to meet your management and reporting requirements.\n\nThe Configuration Workbench uses the models as templates to generate the organization framework of business groups, operating companies, legal entities, and employers for any enterprise. Through an interview process, the Configuration Workbench gathers the detailed information it requires to generate an actual configuration of your enterprise using the appropriate configuration model.\n\nMexico only: You cannot use the Configuration Workbench to create the hierarchy. You must use the Generic Hierarchy functionality.\n\nSingle Operating Company in One Country\n\nThe preceding diagram shows the basic configuration for a small or medium sized enterprise with little or no complexity in operating structures. Vision Corporation is the ultimate legal entity, and for reporting purposes, this organization holds any data associated with the enterprise. Every enterprise has one ultimate legal entity.\n\nThis simple enterprise structure is based on the best practice configuration model. Creating the key enterprise structures as separate organizations enables your enterprise to expand and acquire new companies whilst reducing the cost of re-implementation.\n\nSingle Operating Company in Multiple Countries\n\nThe preceding diagram shows a configuration for a medium or large enterprise with some international operations introducing a degree of complexity. It also shows that operations and people in some countries are held within an international business group (XZ). You can see that the business groups represent countries, and do not appear in the organization hierarchy. This is based on the best practice configuration model.\n\nFor more information on the key organization structures, see: Key Concepts for Representing Enterprises\n\nMultiple Operating Companies in One Country\n\nThe preceding diagram shows a configuration for a multi-company enterprise operating in a single country. This type of complexity can exist in any size of enterprise. Vision Lighting and Vision Security in the diagram are represented as operating companies. Every enterprise has at least one operating company. This may be a division, or a subsidiary within the enterprise which is legally registered in at least one country.\n\nThe Configuration Workbench creates at least one operating company organization as best practice. This reduces the cost of any re-implementation as a result of expansion due to acquisition or diversification within the enterprise.\n\nMultiple Operating Companies in Multiple Countries\n\nThe preceding diagram demonstrates a multi-company enterprise operating in multiple countries. Every enterprise has at least one legal entity that is the designated legal employer for all employment related activities. In the diagram, the Vision Security operating company operates and employs people in the U.S. and Ireland. The Vision Security U.S. and the Vision Security Ireland organizations represent the designated legal entities/employers in those countries.\n\nThe Configuration Workbench classifies an organization as a GRE/Legal Entity where your enterprise operates in a country, and classifies it as an Employer if you employ people in that country also. For example, you can have a legal entity in a country where you do business, but do not employ people in that country.\n\nMultiple Operating Companies in Multiple Countries with a Consolidated Legal Entity\n\nThe preceding diagram shows an alternative configuration for a multi-national and multi-company enterprise with the addition of a consolidated legal entity. A consolidated legal entity acts on behalf of several operating companies or the enterprise, and is the legal employer in the country. Using the preceding diagram as an example, Vision Corp UK is the consolidated legal entity for Vision Corporation in the UK. For management reporting, VL UK and VS UK report to Vision Lighting, and for legal reporting, they report to Vision Corp UK.\n\nFor more information on the key organization structures, see: Key Concepts for Representing Enterprises\n\nDefaults for the Business Group\n\nYou can enter certain types of information for the Business Group to appear as defaults throughout your enterprise structures:\n\nYou can select a default currency.\n\nYou can enter a default for the value each assignment contributes towards each staffing budget that you define. For example, by default an assignment may count as one for a headcount budget.\n\nYou can enter default working hours for all the employees in the Business Group. You can override these defaults at organization, position, and assignment levels.\n\nIf you are using HRMS in the US, you have additional defaults:\n\nFor HR reporting purposes you can register Reporting Categories andReporting Statusesfor the Business Group. These include employment categories such as Full Time or Part Time that cover employees who are not temporary workers, and assignment statuses such as Active or Paid Leave that cover employees who have not left your enterprise.\n\nYou can register for the Business Group the names of the segments of its Cost Allocation key flexfield that hold cost center and labor distribution codes. This customizes the names that appear as field prompts in your BEE Windows.\n\nEmployee and Applicant Identification Numbers\n\nWhen defining a Business Group, you choose a method of creating identifying numbers for its employees and applicants. The choices are:\n\nAutomatic number generation\n\nManual entry\n\nFor employees only, automatic use of a national identifier, such as the US social security number, Canadian social insurance number or the UK National Insurance number\n\nGovernment Reporting Entities (GREs)\n\nAfter defining one or more Business Groups for your enterprise, you set up one or more Government Reporting Entities (GREs) within each Business Group. The GRE is the organization that federal, state and local governments recognize as the employer who:\n\nIssues pay to employees.\n\nWithholds taxes from employees' pay and is liable for employer taxes and tax reporting.\n\nProvides other government-mandated reporting, such as EEO-1, OSHA, and New Hire reports.\n\nEach GRE has a unique 9-digit number (sometimes called the employer identification number or taxpayer identification number) issued by the IRS. Your enterprise may have just one such number, in which case your Business Group and GRE are the same organization.\n\nLarge enterprises may include a number of different divisions or companies each with its own identification number from the IRS, in which case you set up a GRE for each. You can associate several GREs together as a Tax Group, for which one of the GREs can serve as the common paymaster.\n\nInformation for Taxes, NACHA and Reporting\n\nBecause of its pay, tax and reporting role, a GRE must contain the following information entered by you:\n\nBasic rules affecting calculation of federal, state and local taxes, and information for tax reporting.\n\nInformation required for labelling NACHA tapes used to pay employees by direct deposit into their bank accounts.\n\nInformation for submission of government mandated reporting on matters such as employees' work-related injuries, equal employment opportunities, and obligations to pay child support.\n\nImportant: The GRE in the Oracle HRMS products is the same organization as the Legal Entity that appears in the Oracle Financials products, holding the taxpayer identification number. For this reason, the GRE may appear as GRE/Legal Entity on pick lists.\n\nEnterprises using Oracle HRMS and Oracle Financials products should define only one GRE/Legal Entity to represent each employer organization with a unique IRS identification number.\n\nEnterprises with One GRE\n\nEnterprises with only one identification number from the IRS need only one GRE in which to place all employees. In Oracle HRMS, the Business Group and the GRE are the same organization. Appearing below is an example organization chart for a Business Group with one GRE.\n\nSingle Company Business Group/GRE\n\nIn a company like this, some employees can have assignments to the Business Group organization itself. Most have an assignment to one of the various HR Organizations subordinate to the Business Group. All employees belong to the same GRE, which pays them, withholds their taxes, and provides reports on various matters concerning them to government agencies.\n\nEnterprises with Multiple GREs\n\nFor large enterprises that include several different employers with their own IRS identification numbers, all the employees in each company may be paid by that company, and hence all require an assignment to a GRE that coincides with their company. In this case you set up within the Business Group, a GRE for each separate employer.\n\nIn enterprises like this, all employees assigned to an HR Organization within a company have an assignment to the same GRE, and conversely, all employees in a given GRE belong to the same company.\n\nGREs Coincident with Companies\n\nAlternative Structuring of Companies and GREs\n\nIn other large enterprises, the GREs responsible for paying groups of employees are not the same as the companies within the Business Group, which may be organized, for example, according to the particular types of work or projects they undertake. The figure above still reflects the structure of the companies in this type of enterprise. But the GREs representing the employing organizations that pay employees have a separate structure that is independent of the companies, as in the figure below.\n\nGREs Independent of Companies\n\nIn this type of enterprise, employees assigned to a particular GRE can have a work assignment to any of the different companies constituting the enterprise, and a particular company can include employees assigned to several different GREs.\n\nIn enterprises like this, employees are clear about which company they are working in, but may be unaware of their membership in a separate GRE. Because the functions of GREs relate to payroll administration and governmental reporting, they have little direct impact on employees' daily lives at work.\n\nBusiness Groups with multiple GREs often associate some GREs together in a Tax Group with a common paymaster.\n\nGREs and Tax Groups\n\nEnterprises with multiple GREs can place certain GREs together in tax groups. The tax group takes the name you give it.\n\nImportant: The Tax Group name must be consistent in spelling and case for all GREs to be included. For example, \"My Tax Group\" is not the same as \"my tax group.\"\n\nWhen multiple GREs are included in a tax group, the taxable limits for FUTA and SS are maintained at a Tax Group Level.\n\nUsing tax groups allows employers to give employees moving within GREs credit towards their Social Security, and Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA) taxes.\n\nAt the same time that you enter federal tax rules for a GRE, you can place the GRE in a Tax Group.\n\nCreating and Maintaining Organizations\n\nSetting Up Organizations\n\nYou set up organizations to represent your enterprise structure in Oracle HRMS. To find out what organizations you require for your enterprise, see: Key Concepts for Representing Enterprises\n\nOnce you define your basic enterprise structure, you create the additional organizations and locations to represent the internal divisions or departments, and the external organizations for reporting or third-party payments.\n\nSee: Extending the Enterprise Framework\n\nCreate your locations. You define each location and address once only.\n\nSee: Setting Up Locations\n\nCreate your organizations.\n\nTip: To simplify your data-entry, consider using a fixed date as a default for your initial setup, for example, 01-JAN-1951.\n\nSee: Creating an Organization\n\nEnter the appropriate classifications for each organization.\n\nSee: Entering Organization Classifications\n\nEnter details for any extra information types.\n\nSee: Entering Additional Information, Oracle HRMS Enterprise and Workforce Management Guide\n\nCreating an Organization\n\nUse the Organization window to create:\n\nBusiness groups\n\nExternal organizations (for example, tax offices, pension providers, insurance carriers, disability organizations, benefit carriers, or recruitment agencies)\n\nInternal organizations (for example, departments, sections or cost centers)\n\nGREs/Legal Entities\n\nIf you use the Configuration Workbench to configure your enterprise structure, then you only need to create the additional internal and external organizations you require. For example, you can set up additional organizations to represent the internal divisions or departments, and external organizations for reporting or third party payments.\n\nSee: Extending the Enterprise Framework\n\nTo create an organization\n\nNavigate to the Organization window and click New to create a new organization.\n\nNote: For information about querying existing organizations, see: Finding an Organization\n\nEnter a name for your organization in the Name field. A check is performed to see if organizations with the same name already exist.\n\nAll Oracle applications you install share the information entered in the Organization window. Therefore organization names must be unique within a business group, and business group names must be unique across your applications network.\n\nYou can create two organizations with the same name in different business groups but this can cause confusion later, if the HR: Cross business group profile option is set to Yes and you decide to share certain information across all business groups. If you decide to create two organizations with the same name, be sure that this will not cause you problems in the future.\n\nOptionally, select an organization type in the Type field.\n\nOrganization types do not classify your organization, you use them for reporting purposes only. The type may identify the function an organization performs, such as Administration or Service, or the level of each organization in your enterprise, such as Division, Department or Cost Center. You create the organization types you require by entering values for the Lookup Type ORG_TYPE.\n\nEnter a start date in the From field. This should be early enough to include any historical information you need to enter.\n\nNote: You cannot assign an employee to an organization before the start date of the organization.\n\nEnter a location, if one exists. You can also enter an internal address to add more details such as floor or office number.\n\nDutch only: If you are setting up external organizations for a tax office, a social insurance provider or a private health insurance provider, you must enter the postal address and contact details using the NL_POSTAL_ADDRESS Location EIT.\n\nMexico only: When defining a GRE/Legal Entity, if you select a location here, HRMS automatically associates it with this GRE in the Generic Hierarchy.\n\nUS only: If you are using Oracle Payroll in the US, every organization to which employees can have assignments, including business groups, must have on record a location with a complete address. This is because the system uses the location of the organization of the employee's primary assignment to determine employee work locations for tax purposes. This does not apply to GREs, because the assignment to a GRE exists in addition to the assignment to an organization.\n\nIndia only: You can define an income tax organization and enter its location details. You can then select this organization at the GRE/Legal Entity Income Tax Office.\n\nNote: If you are an Oracle Inventory user, then you must not assign a location to more than one organization classified as an Inventory Organization.\n\nEnter internal or external in the Internal or External field. You cannot assign people to an external organization.\n\nExamples of external organizations that may require entry are disability organizations, benefits carriers, insurance carriers, organizations that employees name as beneficiaries of certain employee benefits, and organizations that are recipients of third party payments from employees' pay.\n\nSave the basic organization details.\n\nEntering Organization Classifications\n\nTo determine the purpose and use of each organization you create, you give it one or more classifications. The setup information you enter for an organization depends in large part on its classification.\n\nSee: Organization Classifications\n\nNote: If you classify an organization as a business group, it is not reversible.\n\nTo enter organization classifications:\n\nEnter the classification for your organization in the Name field.\n\nEnable the classification by checking the Enable box. This allows you to use and enter the essential additional information for your organization.\n\nSave the classification details.\n\nYou can either enter additional information for the classification type or enter another classification.\n\nNote: Save each classification after entering and enabling it.\n\nEntering Additional Information\n\nFor each organization classification you select, you can enter additional information. This information can be different for each classification.\n\nFor Business Group see: Business Group\n\nFor HR organization HR Organization\n\nFor Payee Organization, see Payee Organization\n\nFor

In the Organization Classifications region, select Business Group, choose the Others button, and select Business Group Information.\n\nClick in a field of the Additional Organization Information window to open the Business Group Information window.\n\nYou can enter a short name for the Business Group. This name is no longer used in Oracle HRMS it is provided for compatibility with earlier releases, where it appeared in the header line of each form.\n\nSelect the method of creating identifying numbers for employees, applicants, and contingent workers. The choices are:\n\nAutomatic number generation.\n\nIf you choose the automatic entry method of number generation you can at a later date decide to switch to global sequencing. Global sequencing enables you to use a single sequence of person numbers for applicants, employees or contingent workers across multiple business groups.\n\nSee: Running the Global Sequencing for Person Number Generation Process\n\nYou can switch from local automatic numbering to manual numbering for a person type by editing the business group information and selecting Manual.\n\nNote: If you are using Oracle iRecruitment, ensure to set the applicant numbering to Automatic.\n\nManual entry.\n\nIf you choose the manual entry method of number generation, but at a later date decide to change to the Automatic method of number generation, you can run the Change Person Numbering to Automatic process.\n\nSee: Running the Change Person Numbering to Automatic Process\n\nAutomatic use of the national identifier (for example, the social security number in the US, and the NI number in the UK). If you choose this option you must ensure that a national identifier is entered for each new person. This option is not available for applicants.\n\nNote: For whichever method of number generation you choose, it is important to be aware that the number is displayed in various windows and reports. Therefore, if you choose the national identifier method, the person's national identifier is displayed.\n\nEmployee numbering for contingent worker. This option allows you to use the same sequence of numbers for contingent workers as you use for your employees. For example, you enter an employee and the application gives the employee number 101. If the next person entered is a contingent worker they receive the number 102.\n\nSelect the names of the key flexfield structures you want to use in this Business Group.\n\nSelect the appropriate Legislation Code and default currency. The Legislation Code determines the startup data you can access and the contents of some legislation-specific windows.\n\nMexico only: Specify MXN as the currency. Do not select MXP.\n\nImportant: Selecting the correct legislation code is essential for the correct functioning of Oracle HRMS. You cannot change the legislation code after entering employees against the Business Group.\n\nUS users: To maintain fiscal year balances in Oracle Payroll if your fiscal year is different from the calendar year, enter the fiscal year start date.\n\nThe application does not provide a connection between the fiscal year functionality in Oracle General Ledger and in Oracle HRMS. In Oracle General Ledger you specify how the fiscal calendar is broken down in the Accounting Calendar view. Oracle HRMS calculates a fiscal quarter as a three month period. The application calculates four equal three month periods beginning from the fiscal year start date.\n\nSouth African users: You must enter the fiscal year start date for your Business Group, or you will not be able to define payrolls later.\n\nYou can enter a Minimum and Maximum Working Age for the Business Group. When you enter or hire employees, you receive a warning if the person's age is outside this range.\n\nSave your work.\n\nBusiness Groups: Entering Budget Value Defaults\n\nYou can set up budgets for non-monetary measures such as headcount or full-time equivalent. When you enter employee assignments to define the work an employee does for your enterprise, you can specify the value of the assignment towards these budgets. For example, all assignments typically count as one for headcount budgets, but may count as less than one for full-time equivalent budgets.\n\nTo remove the requirement to enter these values for every assignment, you can enter defaults for the whole Business Group. You can override the defaults for individual assignments.\n\nTo define budget value defaults\n\nIn the Organization window, query the Business Group if it does not already appear there. In the Organization Classifications region, select Business Group, choose the Others button, and select Budget Value Defaults.\n\nClick in a field of the Additional Organization Information window to open the Budget Value Defaults window.\n\nIn the Units field, select a measurement type, such as Full Time Equivalent or Headcount.\n\nEnter a default value in the Value field.\n\nYou can enter a default value for as many budgetary units as you plan to use for the Business Group.\n\nTo find out more about budgets see: Budgeting Overview\n\nBusiness Groups: Selecting a PTO Balance Type\n\nIf you use Oracle Payroll, you can choose to use a payroll balance to store gross accruals for an accrual plan. The payroll balance is maintained by the payroll run. It calculates accruals from the day after either the Date Earned or the Date Paid of the last payroll period in which the assignment was processed\n\nTo specify whether to use Date Earned or Date Paid for all your accrual plans, select a PTO Balance Type for your business group. The default is Date Paid.\n\nTo select a PTO balance type\n\nIn the Organization window, query the business group if it does not already appear there.

You can set up default working hours for all employees in the Business Group or in an HR Organization, saving data entry at lower levels. When necessary, you can override the defaults at lower levels, for example, for individual positions or employee assignments.\n\nImportant: The application does not use the schedule information that you can enter here to determine a worker's availability. This is for information purposes only.\n\nThe decision for which method to set up is based on knowledge of which applications use which information.\n\nThe Salary Administration process uses working hours information to prorate the salary values against which it validates any salary proposals.\n\nTo define work day defaults\n\nIn the Organization window, query the Business Group or HR Organization if it does not already appear there. In the Organization Classifications region, select Business Group or HR Organization, choose the Others button, and select Work Day Information.\n\nClick in the field of the Additional Organization Information window to open the Work Day Information window.\n\nEnter the normal start and end times in 24 hour format.

For example, enter 40 and select Week.\n\nYou can add to the list of available frequencies by making entries for the Lookup Type FREQUENCY, using the Application Utilities Lookups window.\n\nDefining Benefits Defaults for a Business Group\n\nFollow this procedure to define a default payroll for benefits administration and to configure the use of benefits assignments.\n\nYou use both the Payroll Description window and the Organization window to assign a default payroll to a business group.\n\nWhen a benefits assignment is created for an employee, due to their termination or other qualifying event, the benefits assignment must have a default payroll. US and Canadian customers should define a default payroll with a periodicity of monthly.\n\nYou can indicate if you want the application to auto-generate benefits assignments for qualifying events. For US and Canadian customers, the application creates benefits assignments by default.\n\nTo define benefits defaults for a business group\n\nFor monthly payrolls, create a payroll with a period type of Calendar Month using the Payroll Description window.\n\nSave your work and exit the Payroll Description window.\n\nSelect the business group for which you want to define a default payroll using the Find Organization window.\n\nPlace the cursor in the Organization classifications block on the Business Group field and choose the Others button.\n\nSelect Benefits Defaults from the Additional Organization Information lookups.\n\nChoose the Next button to display the Benefits Defaults window.\n\nSelect a default payroll for this business group.\n\nIn the Benefits Assignment field, select Yes if you want to record benefits assignments for continuing benefits eligibility.\n\nIf your enterprise uses Oracle HRMS solely for compensation management--or if you do not want the application to automatically create benefits assignments--select No.\n\nSee: Continuing Eligibility: Benefits Assignments, Oracle HRMS Compensation and Benefits Management Guide\n\nSave your work.\n\nBusiness Group: Setting Up Public Sector-type Functionality\n\nOracle HR enables you to set up a particular business group for Commercial or Public Sector-type functionality.\n\nTo set up public sector-type functionality\n\nIn the organization window, query the Business Group if it does not already appear there. In the Organization Classifications region, select Business Group, choose the Others button, and select Public Sector Details.\n\nClick in a field of the Additional Organization information window to open the Public Sector Details window.\n\nIn the Installed field, select Yes or No.\n\nThe default value is No, hence there is no impact on existing business groups.

If you do not specify a particular status here, the candidate receives the Terminate status.\n\nSpecify a user-defined person type as a default for candidates who register in iRecruitment. Oracle HRMS creates a record with this default person type when a candidate registers in iRecruitment. If you do not specify a value, the default person type is Candidate.\n\nNote: The user person type that you define here is associated with the External system person type. The internal code for this system person type is OTHER.\n\nSelect Yes if you want to exclude this business group from the list of business groups available on the Create Vacancy page.
