        "text": "The HR System access request form is used to request access to Oracle, TimeClock Plus and the Equifax I-9 system. Various levels of access can be requested. Access levels are described below. If you have questions please contact HR IS at HR_IS@mail.colostate.edu.\n\nHow do I remove Oracle, TimeClock Plus, and Equifax access?\n\nOracle access (except for Employee Self-Service) is automatically removed when an employee retires or leaves CSU. Oracle access is ended as of the termination or retirement effective date when the termination or retirement action is approved.\n\nA department can request the removal of Oracle, the TimeClock Plus Department HR role, and Equifax access when an employee transfers to another department by contacting HR IS at HR_IS@mail.colostate.edu. Provide the employeeâ€™s name, CSU ID number, department number, and the date access should be ended when requesting access removal.\n\nHow do I get notified when a new hire and/or a new assignment is created in Oracle?\n\nEmployees can sign up for an email list that will provide a daily email with the results of the integration from talent management system to the HR system. This will help departments know when action is required on their part."
