        "text": "Competition among companies plays a pivotal role in laying the foundation for high-quality products and services for customers. When it comes to the field of Database Management, the choice of Oracle vs SQL Server is a relatively tough one. This is pretty common in emerging and competitive fields such as Data Analytics. Having a majority customer share in the market and regularly updating your products & services does determine the revenue your organization generates.\n\nOracle is owned by Oracle Corporation and is used by many companies because of its unique capabilities such as powerful software, support for parallel and distributed databases, better indexing, and many more. SQL Server is owned by Microsoft whose fundamental aim is to provide a platform to create, manage and manipulate databases. Many factors play a role in determining the database that suits your needs and it is important to address them before making a decision.\n\nThis article provides you with a comprehensive analysis of both databases and highlights the major differences between them to help you make the Oracle vs SQL Server decision with ease. It also provides you a brief overview of both databases along with their features. Finally, it highlights a few challenges you might face when you use these databases. Read along how you can decide the right database for your organization.\n\nFactors that Drive the Oracle vs SQL Server Decision\n\nNow that you have a basic idea of both technologies, let us attempt to answer the Oracle vs SQL Server question. There is no one-size-fits-all answer here and the decision has to be taken based on the business requirements, budget, and parameters listed below. The following are the key factors that drive the Oracle vs SQL Server decision:\n\nParent Company, Platform Support & Language\n\nUsage & Database Sharing Features\n\nSyntax\n\nJob Schedulers, Query Optimization & Triggers\n\nMode of Execution & Backups\n\nRollback & Redo Streams\n\nSupport, Trouble Shooting & Error Handling Capabilities\n\nData Accessing Methods\n\nAutomation Support, Parallel Execution & Sharability\n\nPricing Models\n\n1) Parent Company, Platform Support & Language\n\nOracle is owned by Oracle Corporation and can run on a wide variety of platforms such as Windows, Linux, Solaris, HP-UX, and OS-X. Oracle supports PL/SQL and SQL language to write queries to access data from its database.\n\nSQL Server is owned by Microsoft and can only be used on the Windows platform. Recently, the 2017 version of SQL Server can be run on Linux platforms as well. SQL Server uses the T-SQL(Transact-SQL) language to write queries to access data from its database.\n\n2) Usage & Database Sharing Features\n\nOracle is complex to use because its syntax is a little complicated as compared to SQL. It allows users to easily share databases. It also supports packages and is backed by powerful software. The architecture of Oracle is shown below.\n\nSQL Server is simple to use as its syntax is similar to SQL. It does not allow users to share the database. It does not use packages and its processing software power is less than Oracle. The architecture of SQL Server is shown below.\n\n3) Syntax\n\nThe syntax supported by both databases is quite different from each other. The syntax followed by Oracle is a bit complex as compared to SQL Server.\n\nThe Oracle syntax for creating a table, selecting records from the current table, updating records in the current table, and inserting records into the table is shown below.\n\nCreating a table:\n\nCREATE TABLE department ( dept_id int, dept_name varchar(255), numofemp int, CONSTRAINT department_pk PRIMARY KEY (dept_id));\n\nSelecting records from the table:\n\nSELECT * FROM department;\n\nUpdating records in the table:\n\nUPDATE department SET dept_id = ’11’ WHERE dept_name = ‘Marketing’;\n\nInserting records into the table:\n\nINSERT INTO department(dept_id,dept_name,numofemp) VALUES(‘2’,’Engineering’,’510’);\n\nThe SQL Server Syntax to create a table, selecting records from the table, updating the records in the table, and inserting records into the table is shown below.\n\nCreating a table:\n\nCREATE table Dep\n\nSelecting records from the table:\n\nSELECT * FROM Dep ORDER BY LastName;\n\nUpdating records in the table:\n\nUPDATE Dep SET LastName = 'Johnson' WHERE employee_id = 10;\n\nInserting records into the table:\n\nINSERT INTO Dep (employee_id, LastName, FirstName) VALUES(10, 'Anderson', 'Sarah');\n\n4) Job Schedulers, Query Optimization & Triggers\n\nJobs are scheduled in Oracle via the Oracle scheduler or OEM. It uses the star optimization technique to optimize its query performance. Triggers are a set of rules applied to databases to maintain the relationships between attributes in the database. Oracle uses both before and after triggers in its database.\n\nJobs are scheduled in SQL Server via the SQL Server Agent. It does not use any query optimization technique and mostly uses after triggers in its database.\n\n5) Mode of Execution & Backups\n\nAll the major SQL statements in Oracle like INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, and MERGE are executed in parallel. Oracle maintains differential, full, file-level, and incremental backups of its data regularly.\n\nThe major SQL statements in SQL Server like INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, and MERGE are executed serially. SQL Server maintains full, partial, and incremental backups of its data regularly.\n\n6) Rollback & Redo Streams\n\nWhen transactions take place in Oracle, they can be rolled back. It also supports one redo stream that is available at the database level.\n\nWhen transactions take place in SQL Server, they cannot be rolled back. Also, every user has his own redo stream.\n\n7) Support, Troubleshooting & Error Handling Capabilities\n\nThe customer care, troubleshooting, and support of Oracle are available 24×7 and answer your queries in a timely manner, but you will be charged for each support call depending on the support case. Error Handling is also managed efficiently as Oracle treats each new database transaction as a new connection.\n\nSQL Server, on the other hand, provides technical notes, bug descriptions, scripts, patches, and updates without any additional charges. However, the error handling capabilities in SQL Server are not very elaborate as SQL Server executes each command separately and so it is quite difficult to rectify any errors encountered in the process.\n\n8) Data Accessing Methods\n\nOracle makes use of bitmaps and indexes to access data in its database. Also, data values are only changed after an explicit commit statement. This ensures consistency of data and helps rollback transactions to their previous state, in case any errors are faced.\n\nSQL Server does not use bitmap indexes to access data in its database. Instead, it uses reverse keys and functions to access data. Data Values can change even before being committed in SQL Server. This can cause issues in identifying errors and correcting them.\n\n9) Automation Support, Parallel Execution & Shareability\n\nOracle offers automation support through its database upgrade assistant. It also supports parallel query execution and incorporates multiple database schemas/blueprints into one instance. The subset collection of these database schemas are shared between all the schemas and users.\n\nSQL Server offers automation support through the SQL upgrade advisor. It does not support parallel query execution and every database has its own unshared file disk on the server.\n\n10) Pricing Models\n\nThe pricing model for Oracle is designed to fit the company’s budget and goals. Oracle offers 4 editions for their customers- Oracle Database Standard Edition 2, Oracle Database Enterprise Edition, Oracle Database Personal Edition, and Oracle Database Express Edition. The Express Edition is free for students and is portable on any machine.\n\nTo use all the other editions, you need to make a small payment. Companies can decide on each edition based on the rates they are charged. In order to use an edition, companies need to contact the Oracle team and they will give the details on the pricing.\n\nThe editions that Oracle offers are shown below:\n\nTo learn more about the Pricing of Oracle, click this link.\n\nThe pricing model of SQL Server comes in 2 main editions- Standard and Enterprise. Both these editions are free of charge and have 4 main subdivisions: Standard Edition costs $3,586, Enterprise Edition costs $13,748, Standard Server Edition costs $899 and the Standard CAL Edition costs $209.\n\nThe pricing model for SQL Server is given below.\n\nTo learn more about the Pricing of SQL Server, click this link.\n\nChallenges of Oracle\n\nAlthough Oracle is a popular database with regular patches, unique and innovative features, it does have a few limitations. Some of those challenges include:\n\nOracle’s Enterprise Edition is the only free edition and it is licensed only for commercial purposes. This means that very few people can access and learn it.\n\nAll of the prices, updates, and patch notes are only known to Oracle Corporation, which means that the public cannot try and come up with a solution for various problems. This reduces the transparency of the product.\n\nLearning the syntax of Oracle is a little complex as compared to the traditional SQL syntax used by popular RDBMSs and also NoSQL databases like MongoDB.\n\nDespite these challenges, Oracle has numerous advantages that companies can leverage into their business processes.\n\nChallenges of SQL Server\n\nNow that you have a good idea about SQL Server, it is now important to understand some of its challenges. The challenges of SQL Server are:\n\nSQL Server is a less powerful database purely in terms of software design and processing power.\n\nIt has poor indexing and data accessing features.\n\nIn some cases, the relationship between objects and relations can get corrupted.\n\nDespite these challenges, SQL Server has managed to be in the top positions and many organizations still continue to use it in their organizations.\n\nConclusion\n\nThis article gave a comprehensive analysis of the 2 popular database technologies in the market today: Oracle and SQL Server. It gives a brief overview of both the databases and their features and challenges. It also gave the parameters to judge each of the databases. Overall, the Oracle to SQL Server choice solely depends on the goal of the company and the resources it has.\n\nOracle is a better choice if your company needs to have a faster processing power backed up by strong software. Oracle has unique features like parallel query processing, timely customer support services, and 24×7 error handling capabilities. SQL Server is a good option if speed and processing power are not your main concern. Even non-technical users can learn it faster than Oracle and it has most of the features of other traditional RDBMSs. Either way, both databases are assets for your business and will help manage your customers and employees in tandem.\n\nHevo Data, a No-code Data Pipeline helps to load data from any data source such as Databases, SaaS applications, Cloud Storage, SDK,s, and Streaming Services and simplifies the ETL process.
