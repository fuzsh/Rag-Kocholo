        "text": "NetSuite provides two options for integrating NetSuite with a telephone system. Each requires different technology for implementation:\n\nTelephony Application Programming Interface (TAPI): for placing outbound calls with NetSuite. With TAPI you can click on the phone icon next to a phone number and your phone system will automatically dial the number. TAPI only works on Windows operating systems (not Mac or Linux). For more information, see Setting Up TAPI Telephony Integration.\n\nUse Computer Telephony Integration (CTI): for receiving and routing inbound calls. As calls are received, the CTI application queries customer information in NetSuite and presents it to the sales or support representative in a browser window using Screen Population technology. The representative has the required information shown on the screen when speaking with the customer. For more information, see Setting Up CTI Telephony Integration.\n\nTo integrate your NetSuite account with either TAPI or CTI technology, users with the Administrator role must first enable the Telephony Integration feature at Setup > Company > Enable Features, on the SuiteCloud subtab. Then, each user who plans to use Telephony Integration must go to Home > Set Preferences and follow the directions provided on the Telephony subtab.\n\nFor instructions on making calls automatically from NetSuite records, see Making Calls From NetSuite."
