The newspaper has been known by a number of different names since its first publication on October 17, 1938. It was first published as \"Chevalier\" in three issues from October 17, 1938 to November 21, 1938. The name was changed to \"Siena News\" from December 9, 1938 to November 12, 1965. It was renamed \"The Indian\" from November 19, 1965 to February 7, 1989. The name was briefly changed to \"Student Faculty News\" from January 31, 1973 to April 6, 1973. It resumed publication as \"The Indian\" again on May 11, 1973 until \"Promethean\" began on February 10, 1989. The College of St. Rose and Siena College collaborated on a special issue, \"Indian Inscape\", on March 17, 1970. Other special issues were published periodically. The 20th anniversary issue of the \"Indian\" was published on November 20, 1985. An issue commemorating the 50th anniversary of the College was published on November 6, 1987.
