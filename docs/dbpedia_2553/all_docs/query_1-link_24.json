        "text": "This article examines the unexpected behind-the-scenes relationship between the conservative Catholic chancellor Heinrich Brüning and Marxist theorist Rudolf Hilferding. This relationship is the starting point to understand both the politics of toleration and the political and cultural ecosystem in which this friendship came about. The German Social Democratic Party's policy of tolerating Brüning's conservative minority cabinet was hotly contested and has been viewed skeptically by political historians ever since. This article analyzes the mechanics of toleration through Brüning and Hilferding's relationship and demonstrates how Hilferding became the indispensable intermediary between the German cabinet and the socialist party. Toleration was a replacement political process in a polarized climate. A behind-the-scenes informal coalition that included the socialists, as well as the conservative cabinet, muddled through governing and policymaking with backroom negotiations instead of parliamentary debate. Although it failed, toleration was a last-ditch political strategy trying to preserve the Weimar Republic.\n\n25 Peukert, The Weimar Republic, 5. For Peukert's focus on Brüning's ascension as chancellor and for 1930 as a turning point in Weimar's political history, see pages 258–67. More recently this has been echoed in Larry Eugene Jones, Hitler versus Hindenburg: The 1932 Presidential Elections and the End of the Weimar Republic (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2016), 55.\n\n29 Peukert, The Weimar Republic, 258–59. Peukert also condemns Brüning in no uncertain terms here: “Brüning's tactical reliance on the remnants of parliamentarism should not be misconstrued: it was certainly not his intention to seek to preserve democracy through a temporary recourse to authoritarianism.”\n\n79 Brüning, Memoiren, 1918–1934, 11; Patch, Heinrich Brüning and the Dissolution of the Weimar, 127–28. Patch's method of determining “significant conversations” is, in his own words, “somewhat arbitrary” because he excludes “formal meetings with large groups and very brief encounters.” Patch's numbers still reflect the reality that Hilferding was a frequent visitor.\n\n82 See, for instance, Winkler, Der Weg in die Katastrophe, 126–27, for an example of how Winkler extensively employs evidence from speeches and public sources. Note the lengthy lists of sources on cabinet minutes, conference and parliamentary group minutes, and parliamentary minutes on pages 964–66. One major exception to Winkler and his contemporaries’ practice was to rely on material from the diary of Hans Schäffer, held by the Institut für Zeitgeschichte."
