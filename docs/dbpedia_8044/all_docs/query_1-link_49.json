        "text": "Career\n\nHe became elector of Saxony on his father’s death (1733).\n\nAs a candidate for the Polish crown, he secured the support of the emperor Charles VI by assenting to the Pragmatic Sanction of 1713, designed to preserve the integrity of the Habsburg inheritance, and that of the Russian empress Anna by supporting Russia’s claim to Courland. Chosen king by a small minority of electors on Oct. 5, 1733, he drove his rival, the former Polish king Stanisław I Leszczyński, into exile.\n\nHe was crowned in Kraków on Jan. 17, 1734, and was generally recognized as king in Warsaw in June 1736.\n\nAugustus gave Saxon support to Austria against Prussia in the War of the Austrian Succession (1742) and again in the Seven Years’ War (1756).\n\nHis last years were marked by the increasing influence of the Czartoryski and Poniatowski families, and by the intervention of Catherine the Great of Russia in Polish affairs.\n\nWhen the treaty of Hubertsburg was concluded in February 1763, he returned to Saxony, where he died on the 5th of October 1763."
