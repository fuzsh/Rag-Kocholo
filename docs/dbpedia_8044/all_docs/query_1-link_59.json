        "text": "The significance of Polish accounts about the wedding celebrations of Frederick Augustus and Maria Josepha in 1719 is not limited to the facts and data they contain, although the fact that they were intended for Augustus II’s Polish subjects and were to reflect the considerable Polish participation in the festivities in Dresden is not meaningless. However, the accounts are first of all an invaluable source of information about how the citizens of the Commonwealth perceived the splendour accompanying the marriage of Augustus II’s son; to what extent they were captivated by the variety of entertainments modelled on the famous Saxon carnivals; and whether the meticulous design of the wedding was able to result in their increased attachment to the Saxon House of Wettin.\n\nApart from a deep respect for the achievements of the Habsburgs, Emperor Maximilian I transmitted to his heirs a practical attitude towards their art collections. Pearls and precious stones were extracted from set pieces to produce new ones; old-fashioned jewellery or silver objects were melted down; and tapestries, paintings and sculptures were publicly sold to pay off debts. By studying how some of these goods were reused, recycled, and recirculated among the Habsburg family members, I will explain how crown patrimony changed owners and kingdoms, and how the cult of their dynasty, actively promoted by Charles V, heightened the notion of a collective consciousness which served as a topos for aristocratic collecting in the Renaissance.\n\nOn 13 September 1719, the opera Teofane, with music by Antonio Lotti and libretto by Stefano Pallavicini, was premiered in Dresden as one of many artistic events to mark the wedding of the Saxon Electoral Prince Frederick Augustus and Maria Josepha, the elder daughter of Emperor Joseph I. It was also one of the last monumental stagings of court opera in 18th-century Europe. Preparations began well in advance, but difficulties in finding a suitable librettist and subject continued until March 1719. Crucially, it was not so much a matter of obtaining an excellent libretto as of ensuring that it was fully in line with the Saxon political agenda of the time. Further difficulties arose from the vocal cast, originally composed of a troupe of Italian singers led by Lotti, as attempts to replace some of them with cheaper German singers failed. Count Christoph August Wackerbarth, minister in the Saxon Privy Council, was a central figure in the whole process. A close reading of his correspondence with Prince Frederick Augustus and King Augustus the Strong between 1718 and 1719 provides an insight into the details and allows us to reconstruct and understand the decision-making mechanisms at the Dresden court in artistic matters. This article is part of a research project funded by the National Science Centre of Poland (registration number 2017/25/B/HS2/02451).\n\nIndividual cases of sexual abstinence ascribed to medieval rulers have been discussed by scholars from various standpoints and understood as a peculiar dynastic policy, a deliberate “monastification” of rulership, or as the result of problems with an individual’s reproductive system. This article carries forward the research on the interrelation between regality and sexual abstinence through the example of Henry II (973–1024), emperor of the Holy Roman Empire, and his spouse Cunigunde (c.980–1033), both canonised saints, who were believed to live in an innocent matrimony. The development of the image of the royal marriage is traced first in their contemporary self-representations, then in post-mortem historiographic and polemical narratives, and finally in their hagiographical traditions until c.1250, revealing multiple, often contradictory, understandings of the royal sexual abstinence: as the sign of a succession crisis, as moral impurity, or as the highest saintly virtue. Contrary to the idea that Henry II was imagined as a “virgin king” from his canonisation in 1146 onwards, this article suggests that until the beginning of the thirteenth century the sexual abstinence of Henry II was speculated about though never explicitly stated, even in his hagiographic tradition. Only with the papal acknowledgment of Cunigunde as a holy virgin in 1200 did an image of the perpetually chaste marriage gradually come into being, in which Cunigunde was given equal agency and her husband Henry was defined as a male virgin. The analysis of elaborated hagiographic programs, devised by members of the Bamberg ecclesiastical community to praise Henry and Cunigunde, reveals the forms in which the sanctity, regality, and sexual behaviour of Henry and Cunigunde were conceptualized, negotiated, and represented, while at the same time the hagiographic traditions were adapted to contemporary concepts of chastity and abstinence."
