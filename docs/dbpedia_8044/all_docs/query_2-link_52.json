        "text": "(1733–38)\n\nA conflict between Russia and Poland on one side and France. It began after the death of Augustus II the Strong: Austria, Russia, and Prussia supported the candidature of his son, while the French supported Stanislaus Leszczyński, the father-in-law of Louis XV. Stanislaus was elected but was driven out by Russian troops and Augustus III became king (1733–63). There was fighting in Italy between Austria and Spain, supported by France, and Austria was driven from south Italy. Negotiations began in 1735, though the final treaty was not signed until 1738. Naples and Sicily went to the Spanish Bourbon, Don Carlos; Austria retained Milan and Mantua and acquired Parma; Francis, Duke of Lorraine became Duke of Tuscany, and Lorraine went to Stanislaus (it was to come to France on his death); France accepted the Pragmatic Sanction. The war, which began in Poland, chiefly affected Italy and France."
