        "text": "Possibly commissioned from the artist by the sitter’s son, Crown Prince Frederick Augustus of Saxony (1696–1763), Paris, ca. 1715 [1];\n\nCount Sámuel Festetics de Tolna (1806–1862), Vienna, by March 6, 1859;\n\nPurchased from Festetics by Anselm Salomon von Rothschild (1803–1874), Baron Rothschild, Theresianumgasse, Vienna, as Porträt August des Starken, Königs von Polen , before March 6, 1859–1874 [2];\n\nBy descent to his son, Nathaniel Mayer von Rothschild (1836–1905), Theresianumgasse, Vienna, July 27, 1874–1905 [3];\n\nBy descent to Nathaniel’s nephew, Baron Alphonse Mayer von Rothschild (1878–1942) and his wife, Clarice Adelaide von Rothschild (née Sebag-Montefiore, 1894–1967), Theresianumgasse, Vienna, June 16, 1905–1938;\n\nConfiscated from the Rothschilds by German National Socialist (Nazi) forces, 1938–May 1945 [4];\n\nRecovered by Allied forces, May 1945–May 16, 1946 [5];\n\nReturned by Allied forces to Austria, May 16, 1946–September 24, 1947;\n\nRestituted by Austria to Clarice Adelaide von Rothschild, New York, September 24, 1947–February 9, 1954 [6];\n\nPurchased from Rothschild by Rosenberg and Stiebel, New York, no. 2656, February 9–June 15, 1954 [7];\n\nPurchased from Rosenberg and Stiebel by The Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art, Kansas City, MO, 1954.\n\nNOTES:\n\n[1] It is possible this portrait was commissioned during Crown Prince Friedrich August’s sojourn in Paris in 1714, either by the Crown Prince himself or a member of his party, as was a portrait of the Crown Prince by the artist Hyacinthe Rigaud, which is today in the Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden, Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister. The Rigaud painting was sent directly to the Dresden court by the artist after its completion. However, since neither the Nelson-Atkins portrait, nor its two possible pendant portraits of the Crown Prince, were ever part of the Saxon royal collection, if they were commissioned in Paris it may\n\nhave been with the intent for them to remain in France. See correspondence between Carina Merseburger, Wissenschaftliche Mitarbeiterin (Daphne-Projekt), Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden, and MacKenzie Mallon, Specialist, Provenance, May 3, 2022, NAMA curatorial file.\n\n[2] In Nathaniel von Rothschild, Notizen über Einige Meiner Kunstgegenstände (n.p.: 1903), p. 30, no. 51, this painting is described as having been acquired at the “Versteigerung Festetits [sic]” [Festetics auction]. It had been planned for offer at Der auserlesenen Gemälde-Sammlung alter Meister der italienischen, niederländischen und altdeutschen Schule, nebst einer grossen Sammlung von Original-handzeichnungen der berümtesten Meister, Kupferstiche, (besonders Portraite) und Lithgraphien des Herrn Samuel Grafen von Festetits [sic], Artaria und Altmann, Vienna, March 7 and April 11, 1859, lot 59, as Porträt August des Starken, Königs von Polen. The March 7 date was postponed at the last minute, and the catalogue was reprinted with new sale dates–April 11 and May 2, 1859–and with seven fewer lots. Lot 59 was one of these missing lots in the second catalogue printing, because it had already been purchased privately by Rothschild. According to Johann Barkoczy, Samuel von Festetics de Tolna’s brother-in-law (husband of his sister Antonia), in a letter to Atanazy Raczyński, Samuel von Festetics’ father-in-law, March 6, 1859, “Das Bild von Rigaud (Portrait des Gr. Zinsendorf) ist bereits vor längerer Zeit von Rothschild erstanden worden, samt einem großen Teniers (Atelier) und N r 59 Largiliere” (The painting by Rigaud [Portrait of Gr. Zinsendorf] was already acquired a long time ago by Rothschild, along with a large Teniers [Studio] and Nr. 59 Largillierre). This correspondence is transcribed in Kamila Kłudkiewicz, ed., Libri Veritatis Atanazego Raczyńskiego/von Athanasius Raczyński. Supplement (Poznań: Uniwersytet Im. Adama Mickiewicza W Poznaniu, 2019), 495–96.\n\nThe April 11 and May 2 Festetics sales were both eventually cancelled (as announced in “Licitations-Widerruf,” Wiener Zeitung (April 10, 1859): 1623) when the majority of the remaining lots were purchased ahead of time by dealer Georg Plach, who in turn sold many of the paintings to Viennese collector F. J. Gsell. Theodor von Frimmel, in “Mittheilungen über die Gemäldesammlungen von Alt-Wien,” Berichte und Mittheilungen des Alterthums-Vereines zu Wien 27 (1891): 9, and Lexicon der Wiener Gemäldesammlungen (Munich: George Müller Verlag, 1913), 1:368, describes annotations that supposedly appeared in two separate copies of the Festetics sale catalogue, one belonging to Plach, the other to collector Albert Figdor: “Plach schreibt dazu ‘fehlt.’ Im zweiten Exemplar bei Dr. Figdor steht ‘Rothschild,’ was, wie die meisten Eintragungen jenes Exemplars, unrichtig ist. Denn das hier gemeinte Bild kam an den Grafen Edmund Zichy, nach dessen Tode die Erben es nach Ungarn gebracht haben” (Plach writes that it is missing. In the second copy Dr. Figdor writes ‘Rothschild,’ which like most of the entries in that copy, is incorrect. Because the picture mentioned here came to Count Edmund Zichy, after whose death his heirs brought it to Hungary).\n\nAlthough von Frimmel writes that Figdor’s annotation was incorrect, it was von Frimmel himself who was in error, having confused the Nelson-Atkins painting with a similar portrait in the Edmund Zichy collection, which is today in the Museum of Fine Arts, Budapest. Both paintings were attributed to Largillierre and depict the same sitter, but they differ in size and composition. The Nelson-Atkins portrait was in the Festetics collection, but there is no evidence it was ever owned by Plach or Gsell. Contrastingly, the Budapest portrait was not in the Festetics collection but was offered for sale by Plach two years later (Tableaux anciens composant la belle collection de M. P., de Vienne, Hotel des Commissaires-Priseurs, Paris, April 20, 1861, lot 51) and appeared in Gsell’s posthumous sale in 1872, which was conducted by Plach (Versteigerung der Grossen Gallerie und der übrigen Kunst-Sammlungen des am 20. September 1871 verstorbenen Herrn F. J. Gsell, Georg Plach, Sälen des Künstlerhauses, Vienna, March 14, 1872, no. 63). See correspondence between MacKenzie Mallon, Specialist, Provenance, and Julia Tatrai, Head of Department of Old Master Paintings, Museum of Fine Arts, Budapest, September–December 2020, NAMA curatorial file.\n\nPlach’s purchase of a large number of paintings from the Festetics sales has occasionally led to the assumption that he bought all of the Festetics paintings, but this is not the case (for example, Fritz Lugt, in his Les Marques de Collections de Dessins et d’Estampes (Amsterdam: Vereenigde Drukkerijen, 1921), p. 163, no. L.926, wrote it was probable Plach acquired the entire collection). If Plach was involved in the purchase of the Nelson-Atkins portrait from the Festetics collection, it could have been as an agent on behalf of the Rothschild family, rather than as an outright purchaser. Lugt, Les Marques de Collections , 208, no. L.1188, describes Plach as instrumental to the enrichment of the three Rothschild brothers’ collections. However, Plach’s annotation in his copy of the 1859 Festetics sale catalogue (as described by von Frimmel in 1891, the location of which is today unknown) that this painting is “missing” tends to suggest Plach was not involved in its purchase. With thanks to Dr. Orsolya Bubryák, Institute of Art History, Research Centre for the Humanities, Budapest, for her help sorting out the different versions of the Festetics sale catalogue, and to M. Piotr Michałowski, Curator, Galeria Sztuki Europejskiej, Muzeum Narodowe w Poznaniu, for informing us of the Barkoczy-Raczyński correspondence.\n\n[3] The painting is definitively identified in the following Rothschild inventories: Nathaniel von Rothschild, Notizen,30, as Porträt August des Starken; “Inventar über die in den Nathaniel Freiherr von Rothschild’schen Nachlaß gehörigen, in dem in Wien, IV. Bezirk, Theresianumgasse Nr. 14 befindlichen Kunstgegenstände und Einrichtungsstücke,” 1906, Rothschild Archive, London, 000/793, no. 50, as Portrait des Königs August des Starken; and “Palais Inventar,” 1934, Rothschild Archive, London, 000/793, no. 313/50, as Portrait des Königs August des Starken .\n\n[4] The collections of Baron Alphonse and Clarice von Rothschild were confiscated by the Gestapo soon after the German annexation of Austria in March 1938. This painting was taken to the Nazi depot for confiscated art objects at the Kunsthistorisches Museum, Neue Burg, Vienna, in 1939, where it was inventoried as number AR 863, “König Friedrich IV v. Dänemark” (see Katalog beschlagnahmter Sammlungen, inbesondere der Rothschild-Sammlungen in Wien , Verlags–Nr. 4938, Staatsdruckerei Wien, 1939, Privatarchiv, reproduced in Sophie Lille, Was einmal war: Handbuch der enteigneten Kunstsammlungen Wiens (Vienna: Czernin Verlag, 2003), 1031). It was intended for Hitler’s planned Führermuseum in Linz and included in inventories of Linz objects dated October 20, 1939, and July 31, 1940 (National Archives and Records Administration, RG 260, Records Concerning the Central Collecting Points: Munich, Restitution Research Records, Linz Museum: Consolidated Interrogation Report No. 4, Catalog ID 3725274). The painting was transferred to the Nazi repository at the Kremsmünster Abbey, where it was assigned inventory number K976. From there it was moved to the Führerbau in Munich on December 16, 1943, and assigned inventory number 3219 (National Archives and Records Administration, RG 260, Records Concerning the Central Collecting Points: Munich, Restitution Research Records, Reger, Hans: Transport Correspondence and Lists, Catalog ID 3725274). It was subsequently transferred from the Führerbau to the Nazi repository in a salt mine at Alt Aussee, Austria on August 24, 1944 (Bundesarchiv, Koblenz, Germany, B323/6). Copies of Allied and German documents describing the painting’s wartime movements are in the NAMA curatorial files. With thanks to Mag. Leonhard Weidinger, Provenance Researcher, Commission for Provenance Research of the Federal Chancellery, Vienna, for his assistance.\n\n[5] Following the discovery of the art objects in the Alt Aussee salt mine in May 1945, the officers of the U.S. Army’s Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives Section (the “Monuments Men”) worked to catalog every looted object and return it to its rightful owner. This painting was sent to the Munich Central Collecting Point on July 17, 1945, where it was assigned numbers Aussee 3237 and Mun. 4588 (Bundesarchiv, Koblenz, Germany, B323/656, MCCP Restitution Card File). Upon its transfer to the US Allied Commission of Austria on May 16, 1946, it returned to Kremsmünster from where it was restituted to the Rothschild family (National Archives and Records Administration, RG 260, Records of the Reparations and Restitutions Branch of the USACA Section, General Administrative Records, Stift Kremsmünster, R&R 41, Catalog ID 1561451).\n\n[6] Bundesdenkmalamt Archives, Vienna, Restitution Materials, Sammlung Alphons Rothschild, Kartons 53/1 and 53/3. With thanks to Anneliese Schallmeiner, Commission for Provenance Research at the Bundesdenkmalamt, for providing copies of the restitution documents to the Nelson-Atkins; see NAMA curatorial files.

Rosenberg & Stiebel paid a small commission to Eric de Goldschmidt-Rothschild at the time of the painting’s sale to the Nelson-Atkins. His role in the transaction is currently unclear; research is ongoing.\n\nKatalog der auserlesenen Gemälde-Sammlung alter Meister der italienischen, niederländischen und altdeutschen Schule, nebst einer grossen Sammlung von Original-handzeichnungen der berümtesten Meister, Kupferstiche, (besonders Portraite) und Lithgraphien des Herrn Samuel Grafen von Festetits [sic](Vienna: J.
