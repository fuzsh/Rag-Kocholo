        "text": "Chapter 2\n\nEpistolary Relationship and Intellectual Identity in Maria Antonia of Saxony’s Correspondence with Frederick the Great, 1763–1779\n\nKelsey Rubin-Detlev\n\nUnlike a painted portrait, a letter is never a portrayal of just one individual: it depicts, and often constitutes, the relationship between two or more individuals. Since, as Janet Gurkin Altman puts it, a letter is ‘the result of a union of writer and reader’, epistolary self-representation cannot simply reproduce a ready-made self-image of the letter writer.1 Rather, as sociologist and epistolary theorist Liz Stanley has argued, ‘[e]pistolary exchanges symbolise and are themselves exemplars of the social and relational bonds between people’.2 While the letter writer’s self-depiction can reveal a carefully crafted identity, that identity often reflects, above all, the letter writer’s image of the addressee(s) and the (desired) relationship between the interlocutors.3 As a form of social interaction that teeters precariously on the border between life and art, letter writing calls our attention to the complex interactions between cultural models and interpersonal relationships in the creation of any individual’s self-representation.4 Just as feminist scholarship has encouraged us to view the self as existing only in and through relationships with other selves, epistolary writing helps us to see all human identities as continually formed and renegotiated in the course of social relationships.5\n\nTo argue for the importance of studying early modern women’s identity as relational, especially when working with epistolary sources, I propose to re-examine as a case study the correspondence between Maria Antonia Walpurgis Symphorosa, electress of Saxony (1724–1780), and Frederick the Great, king of Prussia (1712–1786). Scholarly interest in Frederick the Great as a writer has been growing in recent years, and his correspondence with Voltaire has received magisterial treatment by Christiane Mervaud, who explores precisely the inextricability of their elaborate epistolary self-fashioning from their constant reimagining of their relationship.6 The relatively limited scholarship on Maria Antonia focuses largely on her biography and her accomplishments as a poet and composer, most notably as the creator of both the librettos and the music for two operas, Il trionfo della fedeltà (‘The Triumph of Fidelity’) (1754) and Talestri, regina delle amazzoni (‘Thalestris, Queen of the Amazons’) (1762).7 The majority of Maria Antonia’s extensive epistolary corpus remains unpublished, but the 226 French-language letters she exchanged with Frederick between 1763 and 1779 appeared in his complete works and have garnered some scholarly attention.8 Anne Fleig and Christine Fischer have read the exchange as part of Maria Antonia’s intensive effort to claim political power despite her gender; they link her performance in her letters to her self-presentation in her operas, in which she fashioned herself using the standard tropes and mythology of court culture, such as Minerva and the Amazons.9 However, especially in the early modern period, letters pertained to a sphere that was neither fully private nor fully identifiable with the public sphere of print or the representational sphere of the court.10 Instead, individual correspondents negotiated with one another and with norms that often assumed letters to be written collectively and circulated beyond the named addressee, but generally excluded immediate print publication.11 Interpreting Maria Antonia’s self-fashioning in the letters to Frederick requires an approach that focuses on the evolving relationship between the two correspondents and the cultural concepts that guided their interactions.\n\nIn what follows, I shift the focus away from the relatively static picture of Maria Antonia’s self-fashioning as a constant argument for female power; instead, I probe the ways in which the identity of an elite female intellectual that we perceive in the correspondence with Frederick emerged out of ongoing negotiations between the two interlocutors. The first five years of the exchange witnessed a struggle between the two letter writers over the nature and relative value of Maria Antonia’s political and intellectual identities. Both eager to preserve their relationship, the correspondents resolved these tensions by allowing Maria Antonia’s intellectual identity to dominate the rhetorical space of the correspondence. This intellectual identity reflected a specific cultural model governing relationships among elites during the Enlightenment: the practices of worldly (mondain) sociability, which eschewed pedantry and professional cultural activity but embraced letter writing and intellectual conversation as leisured pursuits and marks of distinction. Flaunting her identity as a sociable woman of intellect allowed Maria Antonia to smooth out her relationship with the Prussian king, to claim an alternative form of equality with him, and even to comment on and shape his identity in the exchange; it also helped her to remain a possible political interlocutor despite the seemingly insurmountable power imbalance between the two correspondents. This evolution in the correspondence shows not only that elite women like Maria Antonia could, under certain conditions, emphasise their intellectual status to accomplish a variety of ends. More fundamentally, it makes the methodological point that epistolary texts must be read in terms of relational rather than fixed identities: we can grasp the real meaning of the letters only through a close reading of the shifting relations between Frederick and Maria Antonia and the ways in which each letter writer’s identity took shape in response to the other’s manipulations and projections.\n\nRelationship, Political Identity, and the Emergence of an Intellectual Exchange\n\nThe very choice to correspond with Frederick marked a significant shift in Maria Antonia’s identity and in the role that different types of relationship played in her political choices. Born a Bavarian princess, Maria Antonia initially sought to use letter writing to carve out a political position for herself through female familial networks. At the age of twenty-two, before leaving her native Bavaria to marry her Saxon husband, she wrote to her mother’s cousin, Empress Maria Theresa, to propose a secret correspondence in favour of Austria.12 From then on, the two women maintained a secret exchange in parallel with their correspondence through ordinary diplomatic channels, transmitting crucial political information by both means.13 While early modern queens consort regularly drew on their dynastic networks to build their own and their husbands’ political clout, Maria Antonia showed extraordinary daring in suggesting such a correspondence before she even arrived at the Saxon court and then concealing it from her parents-in-law (though not her husband); the exchange illustrates her determination to capitalise on the political significance that her Habsburg familial ties lent her.14 However, Maria Antonia grew increasingly disillusioned with her imperial relative: not only did Maria Theresia neglect to prioritise defending Saxony during the Seven Years War (1756–1763), but she also made it increasingly clear that she would not support Maria Antonia’s primary political objective of securing the elective Polish crown for her husband, Friedrich Christian. The correspondence faltered following the permanent loss of Poland due to Friedrich Christian’s sudden death in December 1763 – only a few months after his accession to the electorate of Saxony – and the election of the Russian-backed Stanislas Poniatowski to the Polish throne in September 1764; it broke off completely in 1772 due to a number of political disagreements between Austria and Saxony. Since the correspondence lacked any interest beyond the political – the expressions of family affection being largely conventional – it could not survive such differences, unlike the exchange with Frederick.\n\nAs the cracks began to show in her relationship with Maria Theresa, Maria Antonia began corresponding with the Prussian king; in so doing, she sprang from a diplomatic connection based on familial and gender ties to a relationship based on a combination of intellectual affinity and political utility. Despite Prussia’s humiliating occupation of Saxony during the Seven Years War, a personal meeting at the Saxon palace of Moritzburg in March 1763 gave Maria Antonia the opportunity to interact with Frederick on less belligerent terms.15 As the less powerful party, she again had to take the initiative in starting a correspondence, which she duly did by sending the scores of her two operas to the Prussian king in April 1763. Cultural and intellectual conversation were largely absent from the essentially political and familial exchange with Maria Theresa, other than a bit of praise for Talestri.16 By contrast, the gift of the opera scores, discussion of other Enlightenment topics like smallpox inoculation, and exchanges of witticisms formed the primary bonds facilitating the introduction of political themes in the correspondence with Frederick.17 Only a few months later, Maria Antonia wrote on the day of her father-in-law Augustus III’s death, October 5, 1763, demanding that Frederick fulfil his ‘promise’ (promesse) to help secure the succession in Poland; she thus strongly asserted her political identity by attempting to transform his vague assurances of sympathy into a political reality.18 Even once her own hopes of becoming queen of Poland had been dashed, she continued to fight to win Poland for her brother-in-law Xaver or her son Friedrich August, writing to Frederick to that effect only a month after her husband’s death.19 More interested in securing peace in Europe and pursuing an alliance with Russia, Frederick politely demurred.\n\nNevertheless, it was not only Maria Antonia’s indefatigable ambition that kept the correspondence going: interest in the exchange was mutual. Throughout the year 1764, an intriguing pattern emerged: as Frederick’s refusals to help in Poland grew increasingly unequivocal, Maria Antonia’s replies repeatedly seemed to break off the relationship. She answered his elaborate rhetorical letters with short, blunt notes that drew attention to the delay of a month or more before she even bothered to respond, writing that his ‘last letter left me no room for reply’ or that ‘I understand, Sire, and shall be silent’.20 By contrast, Frederick responded within a week to each of these cold missives with significantly longer, cajoling epistles: the speed alone of his replies signalled his eagerness to repair the relationship.21 It may well be, of course, that Maria Antonia expected such a response and that her seeming ruptures were only a strategy to prod him. Both correspondents evidently wished to find terms on which they could pursue the relationship: the key was now to negotiate those terms.\n\nMaria Antonia’s efforts to affirm her political authority directly proved untenable because her claims to power conflicted too obviously with the actual state of affairs. Until October 5, 1763, she was merely the wife of the heir to the electorate of Saxony, an officially powerless position. Her influence peaked during her husband’s brief reign, when she was the elector’s consort and a candidate for queen of Poland: Friedrich Christian not only treated her as a trusted adviser, but even transferred control of Saxon finances to her. But his premature death rapidly diminished her status: her brother-in-law Prince Xaver was named regent for her son, Friedrich August, until the latter’s majority in 1768. During the regency, Maria Antonia retained control of Saxon finances and participated in major government decisions, but, afterwards, she was officially powerless for the rest of her life.22 The loss of the Polish crown led to a further diminishment in status relative to Frederick: as a mere electorate without a royal title, Saxony ranked significantly lower than a kingdom like Prussia. The power discrepancy can be seen in the etiquette of address used in the correspondence: from the time of Friedrich Christian’s accession onwards, Frederick’s salutation, ‘Madame ma Sœur’, seems to signal the correspondents’ equality as current or former participants in sovereignty. But Maria Antonia’s invariable use of ‘Sire’ indicates, on the contrary, her inferior rank, even during her husband’s brief reign. Accordingly, when, in 1766, Maria Antonia boldly asserted that ‘every sovereign has the same task to accomplish, and it is mine, Sire, as much as it is yours’, her claim was patently false: she was neither a sovereign like Frederick nor a representative of a power equivalent to Prussia.23\n\nFrom the beginning of the correspondence, Frederick rebuffed Maria Antonia’s direct claims to political authority in ways that also put into play her intellectual and gender identities. Even in cases in which her political inferiority had nothing to do with her gender, Frederick used it as a rhetorical tool and symbol of her powerlessness. Early in the exchange, when Frederick wrote to explain why a Saxon candidate was unlikely to become the next king of Poland, he assumed the seemingly subordinate persona of Russian empress Catherine the Great’s ‘lawyer’ (avocat). Yet, by playing the intermediary between two women and elucidating for them a complex state of affairs, he in reality showed off his professional knowledge of statecraft and legal rhetoric, skills that were presumably inaccessible to Maria Antonia as a woman. His seemingly polite assurances, ‘I will nevertheless spare you, madame, all the lengthiness of a legal defence and will inform you only of the essence’, merely underscored the implied discrepancy between his masculine knowledge of jurisprudence and her feminine intolerance for tedious jargon.24 Adding insult to injury, he declared repeatedly that Maria Antonia had asked him to advocate for Catherine, completely ignoring her protestation that, on the contrary, she had requested that he intervene on her behalf vis-à-vis Catherine.25 In Frederick’s early letters, Maria Antonia’s political powerlessness was encoded as a gendered exclusion from male forms of intellectual and political activity.\n\nThis was a frequent pattern in the first years of the correspondence: Frederick used his literary wit as a weapon, employing it to disguise such mansplaining (so to speak) as elegant literary jokes. In 1765, for example, a dispute arose between Saxony and Prussia over the precedence accorded at the Saxon court to royal envoys: after Saxony lost the Polish royal title, diplomats from royal courts like Prussia’s expected to be given precedence over Saxon government ministers, whose sovereign was a mere elector. The Saxons refused to yield, and Prussia recalled its representative. When Maria Antonia sent Frederick a vehement letter of protest, he ostensibly tried to soften his rebuttal by framing it as a dialogue of the dead. He pretended to address his rather pointed comments about Saxony’s loss of privileges to the late Saxon field marshal and cabinet minister under Augustus the Strong, August Christoph von Wackerbarth: ‘I shall push from my mind the image of a princess whom I esteem and respect, and I shall imagine that I have to deal, for example, with old Marshal Wackerbarth’.26 While substituting a dead male interlocutor of lesser rank for the dowager electress may have freed Frederick’s tongue, it did not really lessen the blow: it added to the diplomatic insult the implication that Maria Antonia, as a woman, was not an appropriate interlocutor in such matters. In these years, Maria Antonia consistently saw her gender used against her to reinforce her lack of political power and to insinuate a lack of intellectual clout as well: Frederick threw down the gauntlet, challenging her to recode her identity to reclaim at least some of that authority.\n\nIn her effort to match Frederick’s wit and regain control of her identity, Maria Antonia’s first tool was irony, a technique that illustrated her rhetorical mastery and intellectual equality. In her first short note apparently breaking off the exchange in 1764, Maria Antonia punctured Frederick’s pose as a lawyer by calling attention to its gendered implications:\n\nI finally understood, Sire, how you were planning to plead the cause of the empress of Russia, and I sensed that you would prefer her in every way. But, then again, I may not always have such a dangerous rival in your eyes.27\n\nReimagining the competition for power in Poland between herself and Catherine the Great as a feminine rivalry for Frederick’s affections, Maria Antonia caricatured Frederick’s insulting use of gender and antiphrastically showed that she saw through Frederick’s claims to be a mere intermediary. Her apparently self-deprecating display of femininity denounced Frederick’s disingenuousness: by siding with Russia, he played a much more active role in deciding Poland’s fate than he let on. He might invent elaborate literary role-plays to make his points, but she could see straight through his tricks and match his wit like an equal.\n\nIn the years 1765–1767, as the end of Maria Antonia’s official political role grew near, she increasingly argued with Frederick about politics in terms of theory rather than practice. This further rhetorical strategy enabled her to claim authority in intellectual terms regardless of gender and thereby remain a worthy interlocutor on political matters as well. The struggle to achieve an equilibrium between her intellectual and political identities during these years occurred through a debate about the relationship between theory and practice in Enlightenment monarchy. Just as scholars today wrestle with how to evaluate enlightened absolutism’s balancing act between power and ideas, Maria Antonia and Frederick staked out their positions in the correspondence by espousing different views of how Enlightenment ideals should relate to political realities.28 Frederick cast himself as a realist whose philosophical mastery helped him to perceive the self-interest driving all things; he thereby flaunted his superiority as a disillusioned practitioner of Enlightenment sovereignty, a position to which his correspondent more and more obviously could not aspire. Maria Antonia, by contrast, emphasised the importance of ideals, accordingly positioning herself as the truer voice of Enlightenment monarchy in theory if not in practice. She cleverly trapped her opponent with his own words: when Frederick asserted that Plato’s Republic was merely the ‘dream of a virtuous man’, she quoted Plato back at him and pointed out the contradiction between Frederick’s cynical attitude and his own well-publicised image as a philosopher-king: ‘Remember this aphorism, Sire: How happy people will be when philosophers become kings, or when kings are philosophers! You are a king and a philosopher’.29\n\nThis was not the only moment in these years when Maria Antonia pointedly matched Frederick’s classical references, responding, for instance, to an anecdote about Demosthenes with a paraphrase of Horace; she even quoted Virgil in Latin.30 Her mentions of Voltaire not only offered further proof that she possessed the same intellectual background as Frederick: they also aligned her with the philosophe and held Frederick to account by evoking Voltaire’s well-publicised expectation that the king would enact Enlightenment principles as policy.31 In the course of this debate, Maria Antonia demonstrated that she could be Frederick’s equal in cultured conversation if not in the public arena and that, nonetheless, she still had a voice in matters of political significance. She was not simply the passive object of his manipulations of her identity; she claimed her own identity and sought to define his as a philosopher-king. This debate laid the foundation for a new relationship that both participants enacted as a meeting of minds, without entirely relinquishing the political significance of their bond.\n\nElite Intellectual Identity and Epistolary Relationship Building\n\nAfter 1767, the correspondence between Maria Antonia and Frederick no longer witnessed the explosions of political tensions that Maria Antonia’s direct assertions of political power sparked in earlier years. But this pacified relationship was not founded on a relinquishment of all authority by Maria Antonia or on a complete purging of her political identity. Rather, she successfully projected an intellectual identity that suited the epistolary mode of communication and the character and position of her interlocutor. This identity developed in keeping with the type of relationship upon which Frederick and Maria Antonia agreed: that of elite Enlightenment sociability. Having emerged in the salons of seventeenth-century France and spread across Europe in the eighteenth century, this set of social practices envisioned intellectual activity as a leisured pursuit and a mark of distinction in refined, mixed-gender company.32 Conducted in French and peppered with exhibitions of wit, the correspondence between Frederick and Maria Antonia fit perfectly into this culture. By choosing this intellectual identity over other personae available to her as dowager electress, Maria Antonia found an ideal means of affirming her dignity, intellectual authority, and enduring political relevance in her letters.\n\nAlthough far from unique in the eighteenth century, Maria Antonia’s choice of an intellectual identity broke with the traditional image of the good royal widow as a pious mentor to her children.33 While Maria Theresa of Austria embodied the traditional model in her voluminous correspondences with her children, Maria Antonia’s prioritisation of her intellectual identity ironically resembles the epistolary self-fashioning of her arch-rival in the struggle for Poland, Catherine the Great.34 Yet the relative absence of the traditional image of the dowager in the correspondence with Frederick is shaped as much by his identity as by Maria Antonia’s. Piety would not have impressed a king well known for his dismissive attitude towards religion. While her femininity and genuine Catholic faith restrained her from emulating his frequent irreverent jokes, she never took offence and even played along with his string of jests about his decision not to abolish the Jesuits in his territories, despite the official suppression of the order. The very woman who, in her earlier years, had written the text for a religious oratorio, La conversione di Sant’Agostino (‘The Conversion of Saint Augustine’) (1750), added to one letter in a postscript, ‘My most reverend, quite stupid, but most excellent confessor, the Reverend Father Kreitl, has begged me to convey his most humble bow to Your Majesty, the sole protector of his late society’.35 Such an escapade illustrates beautifully the importance of relationship to the expression of identity: in other contexts, it would have been utterly unthinkable for Maria Antonia to write such a thing. Her role as the mother of six surviving children fit somewhat better into the exchange because both correspondents regularly traded family news to reinforce the simultaneously conceptual and real family bonds between European ruling houses.36 Accordingly, Maria Antonia’s references to motherhood regularly recall her political identity. For example, in 1774, she asked Frederick ‘not to forget’ (n’oubliez pas) her daughter Maria Amalia, who had just married Charles II August of Zweibrücken; the occasion for remembering arose only a few years later, when Prussia allied with Saxony in the War of the Bavarian Succession (1778–1779) to defend Bavaria from the Austrians, thus protecting Charles II August’s claim to inherit the electorate.37 Maria Antonia was thus perfectly aware of the palette of rhetorical personae available to her as an eighteenth-century dowager electress. Her choice to employ one identity over another depended to a great extent on the general shape and even on the momentary exigencies of her epistolary relationship with Frederick.\n\nContrary to Christine Fischer’s suggestion that Maria Antonia fashioned herself as a learned lady, or femme savante, in the correspondence with Frederick, she did everything in her power to avoid being labelled with that pejorative term.38 Although the term femme savante had a brief heyday as a positive term in the 1660s in France, in the second half of the seventeenth century its pejorative connotation, signifying either a pedant or a woman with false pretences to learning, came to predominate.39 Crucially, although Frederick packed his letters with copious accolades for his correspondent, he never once called her a femme savante: if this had been her model, surely he would have perceived and lauded it. Instead, from beginning to end of the correspondence, he favoured apophatic praise of her intellectual activity: mentions of her ‘extreme modesty’ abound, celebrating her accomplishments as a poet and composer with phrases like ‘But Your Royal Highness does not like it when people talk about your talents; so, only due to your extreme modesty, madame, I shall suppress what I think of your rare qualities’.40 These phrases enhanced the praise because they congratulated Maria Antonia on successfully being learned without seeking to appear so. Stemming ultimately from the mondain culture of seventeenth-century aristocratic salons and found in the works of writers as different as Mlle de Scudéry and Molière, this ideal was perpetuated in the elite sociability of the eighteenth century.41 Maria Antonia sought to affirm her intellectual equality with Frederick while eschewing any posturing that would smack of the pedant or savante: instead, she presented her intellectual practices as thoroughly embedded in the practices of le monde, or the world of elite sociability.\n\nIn keeping with such norms, Maria Antonia situated her intellectual activity within a leisured retreat from the affairs of the world. While this choice expressed her real removal from an official position of power, it also lent dignity to her continuing political interests by subsuming them within her intellectual identity. Already in 1767, the last year of the regency, she embedded a reminder of her close proximity to power in a Horatian image of a country retreat from public life, writing,\n\nHere I am in the country with the Regent and my son; I go for walks, I breathe fresh air, I try to forget my woes, and, enjoying the spectacle of nature, I focus on pleasant and agreeable things.42\n\nA few years later, in 1773, she declared herself a mere ‘dilettante in political matters’.43 However, the term dilettante is to be understood not in its modern pejorative sense, but rather in its eighteenth-century connotation of possessing ‘energetic, enjoyable, wide-ranging curiosity’.44 Such curiosity was part of a broader practice of leisured intellectual activity, which Maria Antonia depicted in a letter a few months later:\n\nI try to let my days pass quietly; the arts and letters take up part of the day, socialising and my duties demand another; more precious moments are devoted to meditation, for which the vicissitudes of my life provide ample subject matter.45\n\nThe bucolic and elegiac modes of these self-portraits evoke Maria Antonia’s persona as Ermelinda Talea, the name bestowed at her 1747 induction into the Accademia dell’Arcadia, an elite Italian literary society, and the pseudonym she used in her published works. The image of retreat foregrounded Maria Antonia’s intellectual identity while helping to make sense of her evolving political identity.\n\nThe two correspondents together lent the ideal of philosophical retreat an additional signification: it opened up an imaginary epistolary space in which Frederick and Maria Antonia were equal interlocutors freely discussing topics from philosophy to politics. In developing this self-image as a leisured dilettante, Maria Antonia was in fact responding to motifs first introduced by Frederick during their debate about Enlightenment monarchy in 1765–1767. The motif of dilettantism first appeared in Frederick’s reaction to Maria Antonia’s challenge that he live up to his image as a philosopher-king: the king asserted that, compared to Marcus Aurelius, the paragon of philosopher-kingship, he was ‘a mere dilettante. I love philosophy and work to become wise, if possible; but my presumption does not blind me to the point of believing myself to be such’.46 Therefore, Maria Antonia’s self-designation as a ‘dilettante in political matters’ does not indicate unambiguously her lack of power relative to Frederick: as a reference to his own usage of the term, it equalises the two as individuals who enjoy philosophy as a leisured pursuit but who know how to assess lucidly their own intellectual and political positions. Likewise, Maria Antonia’s self-depiction as living in Horatian retreat unites rather than divides the two correspondents: it, too, stems from that debate, in the course of which Frederick declared himself an Epicurean who would love nothing better than to live in philosophical retreat from politics.47 Maria Antonia took him at his word and invited him to join her in savouring country life; she added that this choice would in fact reinforce his image as a philosopher-king because the true Enlightenment monarch prefers peaceable cultivation of the arts and nature to excessive love of glory and conquest.48 Despite Frederick’s attempts to separate philosophising from real politics, the struggle opened a neutral space of leisured intellectual enjoyment in which a wide range of topics, including diplomacy, could be discussed.\n\nThe two correspondents then enacted this epistolary invention in real life, a decision that entailed major changes in their relationship. Shortly before Maria Antonia’s son reached his majority, Frederick took advantage of her impending leisure to invite her to visit him, to which she responded that, if they managed to meet, ‘we will talk about politics, finance, the arts, and literature’.49 Such visits occurred in 1769 and 1770, during which music making and cultured conversation likely alternated with political discussions; the subsequent refusal by Maria Antonia’s son to allow further visits in 1776 and 1777 demonstrates their political significance.50 Paradoxically, these voyages that Maria Antonia undertook in her private, leisured capacity rendered her relationship with Frederick public: they informed all of Europe about a relationship that hitherto had been known only to the correspondents and those close to them. Consequently, Maria Antonia was recognised publicly as someone who might have the king’s ear: as she put it, ‘ever since I went to Potsdam […] no one leaves here without wanting to take with them a letter from me; people think I am worth something’.51 Although phrased as flattery, this statement expresses clearly the relational nature of Maria Antonia’s identity: a sociable and intellectual association with Frederick had implications also for her political identity. Over the subsequent years, Maria Antonia wrote numerous recommendation letters and passed on several petitions for other people. Perhaps most notably, in 1774, she wrote in favour of her sister-in-law Maria Kunigunde of Saxony’s candidature for coadjutor of Essen and Thorn, a request that Frederick answered immediately and positively; although the real degree of influence that Maria Antonia had on Frederick’s decision is hard to assess, it is nonetheless significant that she was actively involved in seeking sovereignty for another woman even after she herself had none.52 Employing sociability and letter writing to act as an intermediary was a fairly typical form of diplomatic activity for women in the early modern period.53 Although it accentuated Maria Antonia’s inferior rank and power relative to Frederick, this activity furnished another means by which she could use an intellectual relationship to retain a political identity as well.\n\nTo make sense of the changes that her visits wrought in their relationship, Frederick and Maria Antonia turned to the language of friendship, which allowed them to sustain a semblance of equality and to situate their relationship within the practices of sociability and the related Enlightenment culture of sentiment. Although the term ‘friendship’ (amitié) appeared early in the exchange to designate political affinity, it became prominent in its interpersonal sense in the immediate aftermath of Maria Antonia’s first visit to Potsdam in 1769.54 In her thank-you letter for his hospitality, the dowager electress exulted at her new relationship with Frederick, exclaiming, ‘this sublime prince honours me with his friendship’.55 The motif developed from there, with Frederick jocularly promising to build a temple dedicated to the mineral waters at Spa if they restored Maria Antonia’s failing health: he promised to adorn the imaginary edifice with the busts of Orestes and Pylades and of Theseus and Pirithous.56 Maria Antonia immediately likened this fictional temple to the real Temple of Friendship that Frederick built at Sanssouci, dedicated to his late beloved sister Wilhelmine and decorated with medallions representing precisely those classical pairs of friends.57 In future years, Frederick repeatedly portrayed Maria Antonia as a paragon of friendship, while she entreated him to remain her ‘genius of friendship’.58 Both correspondents had a long-standing interest in the eighteenth-century cult of friendship, as attested by Frederick’s temple and Maria Antonia’s creation in her youth of a Society of the Incas or the Order of Friendship (Gesellschaft der Inkas oder der Orden der Freundschaft).59 Participants in elite sociability generally sought to establish a semblance of friendly equality among themselves; relationships of ‘protection’ between salon hosts or hostesses and writers, for example, were presented as exchanges of ‘attentions’ between friends.60 Maria Antonia and Frederick similarly cast their unequal relationship as an equal friendship to make possible the exchange of ideas and, occasionally, political favours.\n\nIn the 1770s, the correspondents took on weighty intellectual topics, including the nature of causation and the Quarrel of the Ancients and the Moderns; their witty sparring on each topic blended genuine intellectual enjoyment with image-making and political allusions.61 These exchanges were predicated on a playful relationship in which each correspondent designated him- or herself as the other’s student. In 1769, Maria Antonia introduced a flattering passage with the words, ‘[i]f I were permitted to lecture my teacher […]’, and in 1777, she dubbed herself his ‘disciple’.62 Frederick called her ‘the most educated princess in Europe, who could teach me some good lessons if she wanted to take the trouble’ and several years later affirmed that, in his epistolary disquisitions, ‘it is rather so that I can repeat to you my lesson, accepting all the corrections, madame, that you deign to make to your pupil’s essay’.63 In the vein of such inversions, the two correspondents consistently assumed diametrically opposed positions in their debates. Frederick presented himself as a proponent of determinism vis-à-vis Maria Antonia as the advocate of free will – poses that accorded well not only with their respective faiths, Frederick as a (nominal) Calvinist and Maria Antonia a Catholic, but also with their political personae, with Frederick continuing to resist Maria Antonia’s hopes for his support on issues like the fate of Poland.64 Likewise, while Frederick spoke as a relatively moderate Ancient, Maria Antonia advocated strongly for the Moderns. For Maria Antonia, the quarrel offered an ideal frame of reference for shaping her own and her correspondent’s identities in her letters. Sending good wishes for Frederick’s health, she painted a self-portrait of herself as a modern intellectual using her knowledge to predict his recovery after a bout of illness, ‘tranquil in a good armchair in my library, where, instead of the Greek idlers who hung about at Delphi, I see around me the history of heroes and the works of scholars, none of whom can defeat Frederick’.65 While Maria Antonia did not claim to equal Frederick as a military hero, she celebrated modernity for allowing her to set up a mirrored portrait of herself and her addressee as triumphant modern scholars.\n\nBeyond such overt self-depictions, Maria Antonia’s mastery of epistolary form provided the essential means by which she expressed her intellectual identity in relation to Frederick. From the beginning, the correspondence had a highly literary dimension: the two correspondents spun out variations on literary motifs over multiple letters, engaging with genres from fairy tales to dialogues of the dead and rivalling one another in artful praises. Nevertheless, the styles of the two writers differ markedly, especially in the later, more concentratedly intellectual letters. Frederick readily slipped into an earnest, didactic tone when he engaged with ideas, lecturing his correspondent on whatever serious topic was at hand. Entirely focused on expounding his opinion, he tended to pay relatively little attention to the identity of his interlocutor. In a long letter about the Ancients and the Moderns, for instance, Frederick mentioned Maria Antonia only four times: in the first sentence, in the closing two sentences, and, in between, to agree explicitly with two points she had made in her preceding letter.66 By contrast, throughout her letters, Maria Antonia cleverly interwove serious philosophical points with admiration for her interlocutor. When Frederick, disillusioned as ever, argued that the memory of human deeds would inevitably be lost, Maria Antonia used him as an example to test each of her rebuttals. Unlike those who just wanted to be remembered at all costs, ‘benefactors of humanity’ (‘les bienfaiteurs de l’humanité’) like him would live on in human memory; likewise, not everyone could be like Frederick and undertake great deeds without hope of a reward, so the masses, at least, should be led to believe in the possibility of immortal memory.67 As Antoine Lilti has shown, conversation in the world of elite sociability was, above all, an art of praise: each participant proved their own refinement by aptly recognising and expressing others’ merits.68 Maria Antonia thus demonstrated very effectively her intellectual identity: phrasing her ideas as acclaim for Frederick, she exhibited the extent of her knowledge and skill even as she distanced herself from the femme savante by flaunting her social know-how.\n\nBorn into the highest echelons of European society, Maria Antonia was fortunate enough to meet relatively little resistance to her intellectual ambitions. While professional paths were unthinkable for a royal individual, elite sociability offered an outlet where she could display her extensive knowledge and exercise her intelligence in dialogue with like-minded people. More strikingly, her ability to carry on an intellectually stimulating conversation with the king of Prussia helped her to retain a certain political role even when officially excluded from power. To read Maria Antonia’s correspondence with Frederick is to follow an evolving and at times tense relationship in which the two correspondents wrestled with diplomatic and intellectual problems by grappling with their own and their interlocutor’s identities. The exchange thus stands as a methodological reminder to scholars that our analyses of both epistolary and non-epistolary materials must reflect the dynamic and culturally specific relationships that constantly shape and reshape human identities."
