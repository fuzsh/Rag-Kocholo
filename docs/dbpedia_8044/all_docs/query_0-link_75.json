The reign of August witnessed one of the greatest periods of disorder in Polish history.\n\nThe only legitimate son of August II of Poland, he followed his father’s example by joining the Roman Catholic Church in 1712. In 1719 he married Maria Josepha, daughter of the Holy Roman emperor Joseph I and became elector of Saxony on his father’s death in 1733. As a candidate for the Polish crown, he secured the support of the emperor Charles VI by assenting to the Pragmatic Sanction of 1713, designed to preserve the integrity of the Habsburg inheritance, and that of the Russian empress Anna by supporting Russia’s claim to Courland. Chosen king by a small minority of electors on 5 October 1733, he drove his rival, the former Polish king Stanisław I, into exile. He was crowned in Kraków on 17 January 1734, and was generally recognised as king in Warsaw in June 1736.\n\nAugustus gave Saxon support to Austria against Prussia in the War of the Austrian Succession (1742) and again in the Seven Years’ War (1756). His last years were marked by the increasing influence of the Czartoryski and Poniatowski families, and by the intervention of Catherine the Great in Polish affairs. His rule deepened the anarchy in Poland and increased the country’s dependence on its neighbours. The Russian Empire, which had assisted him in his bid to succeed his father, prevented him from installing his family on the Polish throne, supporting instead the aristocrat Stanisław August Poniatowski. During his reign, Augustus spent little time in Poland and more interested in ease and pleasure than in affairs of state, this notable patron of the arts left the administration of Saxony and Poland to his chief adviser, Heinrich von Brühl, who in turn left Polish administration chiefly to the powerful Czartoryski family.\n\nIn Dresden on 20 August 1719, Augustus married Archduchess Maria Josepha of Austria, the eldest child of Joseph I, the Holy Roman Emperor. They had sixteen children. He died on 5 October 1763, aged 66, in Dresden.\n\nLink to Wikipedia biography\n\nRelationships\n\nparent->child relationship with Clemens Wenceslaus, Prince of Saxony (born 28 September 1739)\n\nparent->child relationship with Franz Xaver, Prince of Saxony (born 25 August 1730)\n\nparent->child relationship with Friedrich Christian, Elector of Saxony (born 5 September 1722)\n\nparent->child relationship with Maria Amalia, Queen Consort of Spain (born 24 November 1724)\n\nparent->child relationship with Maria Anna, Electress of Bavaria (born 29 August 1728)\n\nparent->child relationship with Maria Christina, Princess of Saxony (born 12 February 1735)\n\nparent->child relationship with Maria Elisabeth, Princess of Saxony (born 9 February 1736)\n\nparent->child relationship with Maria Josepha, Dauphine of France (born 4 November 1731)\n\nparent->child relationship with Maria Margaretha, Princess of Saxony (born 13 September 1727)\n\nchild->parent relationship with August II der Starke (born 12 May 1670 Jul.Cal.
