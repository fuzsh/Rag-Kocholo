        "text": "In This Article\n\nOrigin, Meaning, And History Of Augustus\n\nAugustus is a regal boy’s name of Latin origin meaning ‘great,’ ‘exalted,’ ‘revered,’ ‘venerable,’ or ‘magnificent.’ It is derived from the Latin adjective ‘augustus,’ a derivative of the Latin verb ‘augere,’ meaning ‘to increase.’ Interestingly, the Greek translation of Augustus is ‘Sebastos,’ which is the root of Sebastian. Hence, it is safe to say that Augustus and Sebastian are name twins. Augustus is an ancient name that has returned in recent years due to an increased preference for strong names.\n\nAugustus originated as a title given to the first Roman Emperor, Octavian. He was the adopted son of Julius Caesar. Later, Octavian adopted the title as a given name. Several other Roman kings favored this name in later years. This name also gave birth to the month name of August. The Romans decided to name a month after Augustus because he had done a lot for the kingdom. Three Polish kings also carried this magnificent name.\n\nAugustus has several variations, including Austin, August, Auguste, Agustin, and Augusto. The feminine variations of Augustus are Augustine, Augustina, and Augusta. In Scandinavian countries, the name August is used more often than Augustus. In Italian, it is written as ‘Agosto.’\n\nYou can use a variety of nicknames for Augustus. One of the most common nicknames is Gus. Other nicknames include Auggie, Augie, Augy, Auggo, Aust, Goose, Gusto, Gusty, Gussy, and Tus.\n\nAugustus has a strong pop culture presence. Augustus Snodgrass is a character in Charles Dickens’s first book, ‘The Pickwick Papers,’ while Augustus Highcastle is the main character in George Bernard Shaw’s comic play ‘Augustus Does His Bit.’ Augustus Haynes is the upright editor of the city desk in The Baltimore Sun in the HBO drama ‘The Wire.’ Augustus Porter is a character in the Disney Channel animated fantasy series ‘The Owl House.’ Augustus Rookwood is a character in the Harry Potter series.
