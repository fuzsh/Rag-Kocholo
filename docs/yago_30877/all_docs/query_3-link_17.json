        "text": "Print This Page\n\nOur beautiful mom, grandma, great grandma, sister and friend, Shirley Jane (Jenson) (Cramer) Battig, age 84 of Buffalo, MN flew into the arms of Jesus on Friday, October 18, 2019, at The Oasis, Lake Ridge Care Center in Buffalo, MN.\n\nShe was born on Christmas Day, December 25, 1934 in Decatur, Nebraska—the daughter of Cecil F. and Grace E. (Ball) Jenson.\n\nIn 1976, Shirley J. Cramer and David H. Battig were joined in marriage after being introduced by a friend while both working for Honeywell. They were married for 39 wonderful years until he preceded her in death on August 13, 2017.\n\nShirley retired from Honeywell after 30 years of service as an Inspector.\n\nShe loved all things red, Bluegrass music, feeding and watching the birds – especially the Cardinals that visited her yard daily. She was well versed with her bible and well-read — keeping us abreast with daily news and politics. She was a skilled embroiderer and baker, earning many 1st and 2nd place ribbons at the Wright County Fair for both. She was an amazing cook with the ability to quickly prepare a delicious and lavish meal and serve it with heart filled joy! But, and above all else — she loved and appreciated her Lord and her family, from the littlest to the greatest.\n\nShe loved us all so well, always ready to give a word of encouragement, a hug and having an open-door policy for a meal or a conversation. Throughout her life she cared for and ensured that anyone in her family or friend in need, was taken care of. Her children fondly remember her “must-go” meals, meaning she would use ingredients that “must-go” from the refrigerator, and her “happening” meals that meant they were eating something never eaten before. Her bedtime rituals for her children included Irish songs, passed down from her Mama Grace and bedtime stories – told not read. Often, she would insert her children’s name into the song or story.\n\nHer church work includes officer for Lutheran Women’s Missionary League (LWML), alter guild, communion preparation, leading women’s bible studies, childcare, serving and coordinating soup suppers and special dinners. When vacation bible school was about to begin, she would go around the neighborhoods inviting families to the program. Later she would be seen with Mama Grace cruising through town and the church parking lot, music blaring from her red convertible with the license plate that read, “Go Granny Go”. She was an active member of MCCL (MN Concerned Citizens for Life) for many years, driving her red convertible for the group in the Buffalo parade. Further, Shirley was a past member of the Wright County Historical Society.\n\nAs gentle and loving as she was, her quick wit and often surprising humor could sometimes catch people off guard.\n\nShe loved! She loved life – every single minute of it no matter what “life” brought to her day.\n\nShirley is already missed so much by her family and friends…we will never be the same.\n\nShe is survived by her children, Debra (James) Holcombe, Kelly Cramer (Sue), and Kevin Cramer; 14 grandchildren; 21 great-grandchildren; sisters, Janice (Jim) Locke, Marilyn (Gerry) McLarnon, Lidja (Gerald) Rudelitsch, and Patricia (Jerry) Wilke; and many nieces and nephews who she loved on over the years.\n\nIn addition to her husbands, John E. Cramer and David H. Battig, she was preceded in death by her son, Thomas E. Cramer; and brothers, Michael, Boyd and infant brother Darrell Jenson.\n\nFuneral Service will be held Monday, October 28, 2019 at 11:00 AM with visitation one hour prior at Buffalo Covenant Church in Buffalo, MN. Interment will be held at Lakeview Cemetery in Buffalo.\n\nFuneral arrangements have been entrusted to The Peterson Chapel of Buffalo. Online condolences for the family may be directed to www.thepetersonchapel.com."
