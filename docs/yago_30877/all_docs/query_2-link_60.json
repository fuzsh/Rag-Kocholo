        "text": "Yesterday Kevin Buchanan and the Boston Cannons opened up their 2014 Major League Lacrosse season by beating the Chesapeake Bayhawks by a score of 15-9. Buchanan was the top scorer of the game with 7 goals. In addition to starting off his season with a career high in points, Kevin also earned the Warrior Offensive Player of the Week .\n\nThis winter I had the opportunity to interview Kevin while he was in attendance at a Lacrosse Coaching Clinic. This is what he said:\n\nOutlook on 2014 Season- Great additions to the team. Excited.\n\nAdvice he would give to younger players wanting to take it to the next level- Always have your stick in your hands. Find yourself a lacrosse mentor.\n\nMost memorable lax moment- Winning the MIAA High School Championship for Calvert Hall (that's Maryland)\n\nFavorite athlete growing up- Cal Ripken\n\nOther sports he played growing up- hockey\n\nOpinion on sports specialization at an early age- Good if it is a passion of the kid and not because the parent is forcing it. Overall, it's great to play multiple sports because you get to look forward to the next sport.\n\nJob outside of Lax- Kevin works in medical sales\n\nThoughts on the new partnerships MLL has going into 2014 season- It's great, they are making fantastic strides. With the lacrosse community united it will be good for the sport.\n\nHow do you stay in shape to play professionally- Working with Tyler and John out at CATZ in Hingham. They will with everything from conditioning, strength and nutrition.\n\nDo you have any superstitions or lucky charms- Kevin prays before every game\n\nHow many lacrosse sticks do you have- 10-20, I'm sponsored by Brine\n\nDo you prefer to play on grass or turf- Well maintained grass\n\nThe Boston Cannons next home game will be May 10th at 6pm. All home games are played at Harvard Stadium."
