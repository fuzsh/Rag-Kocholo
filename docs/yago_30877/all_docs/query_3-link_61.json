        "text": "It’s official, Gina Tognoni is going back to One Life to Live and reprising the role she made famous, that of Kelly Cramer. In a new TV Guide Magazine exclusive with Michael Logan, Gina admits she looked at west coast soaps “B&B” and “Y&R” but ultimately it made more sense for her life to stay on the east coast and to reunite with her favorite head writer, Ron Carlivati! Here are some excerpts from the feature:\n\nSo what went haywire at Y&R and B&B? Didn’t [B&B exec producer] Brad Bell want to team you with Jack Wagner?\n\nYes, which I would have loved. It was a wonderful experience meeting with Brad, but it came down to asking myself the difficult question: east coast or west coast? I just got married last May. We live in New Jersey. We’re still on the honeymoon! All that came into play when I made the decision, and it really wasn’t easy. The same goes for Y&R, though we never got as far as talking about a character. It just wasn’t in the cards. I will say this: Everybody in the soap industry has so much passion these days and they’re intent is to stay alive, and that’s exciting to see. Everybody is on their game and trying to make their shows the best they can be. That’s the optimistic view, obviously. The other side of that is that this is a very changing and challenging time. Having just lost GL, it’s all so emotional. I care about these shows. I care about what I do.\n\nSo what’s in store for Kelly when she hits Llanview? When she was last seen, and the role was played by Heather Tom, Kelly and Kevin went off to London. [Dan Gauthier, who plays Kevin, will return to OLTL this fall].\n\nI believe she is still connected to Kevin. We’ll see where that relationship is at when we see Kelly. I think they have some ideas about that, but it’s too soon to know. It’s all still in the works, but I trust them. I don’t need to know much more. I know the standard elements of the character—her family connections, her relationships in the town—so I get the basic deal. [Longtime staff writer turned head writer] Ron Carlivati has always been a champion of Kelly. He always understood her.\n\nFormer General Hospital favorite and longtime fitness guru, Richard Simmons’s cause of death has been determined when his passing was ruled accidental.\n\nLenny Simmons, Richard’a brother, informed PEOPLE through a statement from a family rep, Tom Estey, the findings of the LA coroners report. Estey shared, “The Coroner informed Lenny that Richard’s death was accidental due to complications from recent falls and heart disease as a contributing factor. The toxicology report was negative other than medication Richard had been prescribed. The family wishes to thank everyone for their outpouring of love and support during this time of great loss.”\n\nSimmons, appeared as himself on GH when he held exercise classes at the Campus Disco from 1979-1983, and them made a brief return to the GH Nurses’ Ball back in 2013. He was found dead at his home on July 13th by his longtime housekeeper, one day after celebrating his 76th birthday.\n\nThe LAPD originally reported there was no foul play in his death, but that more testing needing to be done to be conclusive. Previous reports indicated that Simmons had fallen inside his home on July 12, after feeling dizzy, and that he had informed his housekeeper that he would possibly seek medical attention the following day, if he felt unwell.\n\nRichard’s brother, Lenny Simmons, shared how he wants the beloved pop fitness icon to be remembered, stating, “I want them to remember him for the genuine joy and love he brought to people’s lives. He truly cared about people. He called, wrote and emailed thousands of people throughout his career to offer help.”\n\nShare your thoughts on the official cause of death of Richard Simmons, and if you will miss the beloved fitness guru and enjoyed his appearances on GH? Comment below.\n\nIt was 35 years ago on this day, August 20th, 1989, that Lyle and Erik Menendez shot and killed their parents Kitty and Jose Menendez in their home in Beverly Hills.\n\nNow on August 20th, 2024, the highly-anticipated limited series Monsters season two from Ryan Murphy, unveils the premiere date for the story centering around the brothers and the murder case along with its first trailer.\n\nGeneral Hospital fans are extremely excited and intrigued for the upcoming series, and to see Nicholas Chavez (ex-Spencer Cassadine) in one of the leading roles as Lyle Menendez.\n\nMonsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story drops on Netflix beginning on September 19th. Chavez took to his Instagram account and posted the trailer accompanied by his words in the post, “So excited holy heck!”\n\nSeptember will be a busy month for Chavez fans as not only can he be seen on Monsters, but also as previously revealed, Nicholas is part of the cast of another Ryan Murphy series, Grotesquerie in which he plays Father Charlie.

However, the prosecution argued that their motive was greed and the desire to inherit their parents’ fortune. The trials lasted for months and the brothers were charged for their actions. They are currently at the R J Donovan Correctional Facility in San Diego, California.\n\nAlong with Chavez, the cast includes: Javier Bardem and Chloë Sevigny as parents Jose and Kitty Menendez, and Cooper Koch as Erik Menendez.
