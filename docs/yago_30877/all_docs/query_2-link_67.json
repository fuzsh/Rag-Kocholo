        "text": "Kevin Buchanan has been named the new principal for Los Gatos High School. The Los Gatos-Saratoga Union High School District board approved Buchanan’s selection last month after an extensive recruitment and selection process that included panel interviews with parents, staff, students and administration.\n\nInterim principal Paul Robinson will remain at the helm for the duration of the 2020-21 school year until Buchanan officially takes over on July 1. Robinson replaced Kristi Grasty, whose five-year tenure as principal ended last year.\n\nBuchanan’s 25-year career in education includes 18 years in high school administration. Most recently, he served for 11 years as the principal of Oak Park High School in Southern California. With approximately 1,500 students, Oak Park’s enrollment is about two-thirds that of Los Gatos High, which has slightly more than 2,100 students.\n\nOak Park is a District of Choice school and so takes students from outside the Oak Park Unified High School District. Buchanan oversaw the school’s increase in enrollment that came with that designation, which required the creation and growth of programs including honors and Advanced Placement, Engineering and Career and Technical Education Pathways, athletics and visual and performing arts. During Buchanan’s tenure, Oak Park earned California Distinguished School Awards in 2013 and 2019 and a 2015 California Gold Ribbon Award.\n\n“Integral to these successes is his commitment to ensuring a collaborative, inclusive approach to leadership, student connectedness and community engagement,” Michael Grove, superintendent of the Los Gatos-Saratoga district, said in a statement.\n\nOriginally from Cheshire, England, Buchanan earned his bachelor’s degree from the University of California, Los Angeles with honors before beginning his teaching career at Los Angeles High School. He earned his master’s degree in educational leadership at UCLA’s Principal Leadership Institute before spending seven years as the assistant principal of curriculum and instruction for La Cañada High School in La Cañada Flintridge, CA.\n\nBuchanan and Socorro, his wife of 31 years, have three grown sons. In his leisure time, he enjoys traveling, gardening and soccer—although as a Brit and lifelong Manchester City F.C. fan, he calls it football.\n\n“I believe that Mr. Buchanan will be an outstanding leader for LGHS for many years to come,” Grove said. “Mr. Buchanan will finish the spring in his current role at OPHS but will be at LGHS several times through the spring to meet students, staff and families and ensure a smooth leadership transition.”"
