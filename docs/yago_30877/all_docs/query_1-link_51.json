In addition, Dr. Everett is AAHA-certified in Animal Hospice and Palliative Care and is a Fear Free practitioner.\n\nIn Dr. Everett’s free time, she and her husband enjoy playing golf, traveling, discovering new restaurants, and spending time with their pets.\n\nDVM\n\nDr. Bailey has always had a strong passion for animals. Therefore, she chose a career in veterinary medicine because it is constantly evolving and every day is different. She also wanted to make a difference in people and animals’ lives. She aims to establish relationships with the client and patient to provide the best advice and medicine. In addition, she is a Fear Free certified practitioner.\n\nIn Dr. Bailey’s free time, she enjoys supporting her Oklahoma State University Cowboys, traveling with her husband and son, and spending time with her fur family.\n\nDVM\n\nDr. Wooton grew up in New Mexico, loving all animals, big and small.

Dr. Buchanan began his career in Stephenville at a mixed animal practice before leaving to open his own practice in Lipan that he operated from 1989 to 2000. After selling the practice, he opened a small animal clinic in Weatherford, which he sold in 2015. Since then, he has been practicing medicine as an associate veterinarian in the metroplex. Dr. B is happy to join our practice and be much closer to his home in Weatherford, which he shares with his wife Cheli of 41 years, his son, 6 rescue dogs, 4 rescue cats and 2 rescue horses.\n\nDVM\n\nDr. Naylor graduated from Texas A& M University School of Veterinary Medicine in 1978.

She developed her love of animals volunteering at animal shelters, vet clinics and a therapeutic horse-riding facility. Dr. Garcia obtained her B.S in Animal Science from Angelo State University, where she became involved in her Ag Department, furthering her interest in animal care, especially large animals. She is a graduate from Oklahoma State College of Veterinary Medicine. Her interests include reproductive work in cattle/sheep/goat and ophthalmology. Dr. Garcia has always felt the need to help her community, and helping our four-legged companions is her way of giving back. She is excited to join the GAC team and continue to do what she loves most.\n\nIn her spare time, Dr. Garcia enjoys painting and sketching, going two-stepping with her friends, and spending time with her pets at home."
