There, he represents clients in complex personal injury claims, including those involving 18-wheeler accidents and motorcycle crashes. Before joining Mike Slocumb Law Firm, Mr. Buchanan was in private practice with his own firm for several years.\n\nMr. Buchanan grew up in Miami, Florida. After serving in the U.S. Marine Corps, he attended Jacksonville State University, where he earned a bachelor’s degree in psychology and law enforcement. He also holds a master’s degree in psychology from Jacksonville State University. While in attendance, he was a member and co-chairperson of the International House Program.\n\nAt the age of 39, Mr. Buchanan decided to apply to law school after closely following the Casey Anthony trial and developing a keen interest in the legal profession. He went on to earn his J.D. from the Birmingham School of Law, graduating with honors.\n\nWhen assisting his clients, Mr. Buchanan employs a professional and relatable approach. He avoids pretentious language, instead taking the time to explain the legal process in clear, easy-to-understand ways and communicating frequently with his clients. He is honest and straightforward when it comes to explaining his clients’ legal options and aggressive when it comes to protecting their rights, both in and out of the courtroom.\n\nMr. Buchanan is admitted to practice in the state of Alabama, as well as the U.S. District Court for the Northern, Middle, and Southern Districts of Alabama. He is a member of the Alabama State Bar, the American Bar Association, the Birmingham Bar Association, and the Lee County Bar Association.\n\nMr. Buchanan is married to his wife, Jamie, with whom he shares three children, two German shepherds, and a chihuahua.
