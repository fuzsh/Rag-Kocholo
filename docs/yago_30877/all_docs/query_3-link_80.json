        "text": "Painless\n\nChristina Nerrit (Karen Young) is left for dead in her apartment, a plastic bag over her head and her hands cuffed, but survives. At the hospital, she asks her sister, Allison (Annie Campbell), to bring her laptop computer. Initially, Benson (Mariska Hargitay) and Stabler (Chris Meloni) think her married boss was the culprit, since he was seen leaving her apartment. But urine tested from her bathroom indicated the victim or perp is a female, suffering from kidney failure. Meanwhile, Christina dies from an insulin overdose while in the hospital. When they check her computer, they discover she was suicidal. She had been on a website for suicidal people and the \"\"conductor\"\" was encouraging her to do it. The \"\"conductor\"\" is Amy Solwey (Marlee Matlin), a deaf embryologist. She comes in for questioning and technically, because she didn't commit a crime, is released.\n\nRed Moon\n\nPatrick Jane accepts the help of a local astrologer, Ellis Mars (guest star John Billingsley - Star Trek: Enterprise), to solve the puzzling case of a triple homicide that involves two policemen and the fiancÃ© of an EMT worker. Heather Tom (The Bold and the Beautiful) also guest stars as Marva, a witness in this episode written by show creator Bruno Heller and directed by series star Simon Baker.\n\nMr. Monk Is on the Air\n\nPopular shock jock Max Hudson is doing his morning radio show when he gets a phone call. Across town at Max's house, his wife, Jeanette, has been found dead. In an apparent accident, Jeanette left the gas from her bedroom fireplace on, took a nap, and died of asphyxiation. Jeanette's sister, Linda, goes to Monk for help. Monk agrees to investigate, and after some snooping at Max's house, Monk agrees with Linda that Jeanette's death looks suspicious, and that Max was probably involved. But Max was on the air at the time Jeanette died. How could he have done it?\n\nLiving Proof\n\nJane and Maura's relaxing day at an outdoor spa is anything but when they discover the murder of a pregnant woman who had been serving as a surrogate mother. Soon the hunt is on to find the baby's biological parents."
