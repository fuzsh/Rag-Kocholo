        "text": "COLUMBUS, Ohio Former Ohio State men’s lacrosse players Kevin Buchanan and Anthony Kelly are two of 84 players who have been selected to try out for the 2010 team that will compete in the Federation of International Lacrosse (FIL) World Championship in Manchester, England. The tryouts will be held June 7-10 at Bryant University in Smithfield, R.I.\n\nNearly 200 players submitted applications to be considered for the tryouts, with the U.S. Men’s Team Player Selection Committee narrowing the field to 84. Following the tryout weekend, the group will be trimmed to approximately 40 players that will compete in three training weekends during the fall. After those three weekends, the roster will be cut to the FIL-mandated squad size of 23.\n\nBuchanan was a four-year letterwinner for the Buckeyes from 2005-08. A second-team All-American and GWLL Player of the Year as a senior when he helped lead the Buckeyes to a Great Western Lacrosse League title and quarterfinal berth in the NCAA tournament, Buchanan ended his career second in scoring in Buckeye history (97-78-175). Buchanan currently is on the roster of the Washington Bayhawks in Major League Lacrosse.\n\nKelly, a Buckeye from 2000-03, was on the Buckeyes’ first NCAA tournament squad in 2003 when the team also won the conference title. A four-year winner of the Most Groundballs in a Season Award for the Buckeyes, Kelly now plays for the MLL’s Chicago Machine. He was an MLL All-Star last season, winning the hardest shot competition.\n\nThe men’s national team tryouts at Bryant University will be open to the public to attend. A general admission fee will be charged.\n\nGame Schedule\n\nMonday, June 8\n\n9 a.m. – Noon\n\n6:30 p.m. 9:30 p.m.\n\nTuesday, June 9\n\n9 a.m. – Noon\n\n6:30 p.m. 9:30 p.m.\n\nWednesday, June 10\n\n8:30 am. 11:30 p.m."
