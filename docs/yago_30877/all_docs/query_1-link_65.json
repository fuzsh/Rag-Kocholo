        "text": "INDIANAPOLIS — Chad Buchanan was one of the last people to enter the room. He smiled and shook a few hands with his new coworkers in the Indiana Pacers’ organization. Buchanan chose to stand in the far back of the Pacers’ interview room Friday.\n\nOn the dais for their introductory news conference were Victor Oladipo, Domantas Sabonis and Darren Collison, the newest Pacers. During the event, Buchanan watched one of his closest friends in the industry, Pacers President Kevin Pritchard, explain his decision to trade Paul George to the Oklahoma City Thunder to acquire Oladipo and Sabonis. Buchanan stayed in the room long after the news conference was over, too.\n\nAs the Pacers’ new general manager, Buchanan understands he will play a vital role in the franchise’s rebuilding efforts. He also realized the significance of the timing of his arrival. He joined Pritchard’s front office staff July 1, the start of the NBA’s calendar year. His start was also less than two hours after Pritchard agreed to the blockbuster trade with the Thunder.\n\n“I saw what the options were that were presented to him,” Buchanan said Friday about teams' offers to Pritchard in his first public comments since joining the Pacers. “I’m not worried about that. I’m worried about what are our options now and trying to support Kevin through that.”\n\nOnce the NBA’s free agency period ends, Buchanan will have several responsibilities as Pritchard’s top deputy.\n\nHe will oversee the Pacers’ entire scouting process with Ryan Carr, the team’s director of scouting. He will help Pritchard by keeping consistent communication with other general managers and agents who represent players. His player personnel assessments will include the Fort Wayne Mad Ants, the Pacers’ affiliate in the NBA's G League. He will evaluate the trade market for potential trade options, a role Pritchard did last season for former team President Larry Bird.\n\nYet Buchanan knows what his biggest task with the Pacers will be the NBA draft.\n\n“Ultimately, to win big, obviously, you’ve got to have stars,” Buchanan said. “At some point, you’ve got to hope one of those guys develops into a star. I don’t think people expected Paul to become what he is. Victor and Domantas have room to grow and then we’re going to have to draft well.”\n\nIn line with Pritchard’s beliefs, Buchanan said the Pacers’ rebuild would come down to two factors.\n\nThe first is how well the Pacers will select prospects in the draft. Buchanan said the team’s success in large part would be determined by how well he and Pritchard continue to add talented players to a core group that includes Myles Turner, Oladipo, Sabonis, Glenn Robinson III, Lance Stephenson, Cory Joseph and rookie T.J. Leaf. Buchanan also emphasized that those future players must demonstrate the attributes — toughness, togetherness and unselfishness — that he and Pritchard believe will allow the Pacers to play the correct way for success.\n\n“Indiana fans believe in that,” Pritchard said Friday. “We believe in that. There’s a right way to play and we’re going to play the right way.”\n\nThe second factor for the Pacers is the potential ascension of Turner, the third-year center who averaged 14.5 points, 7.3 rebounds and 2.1 blocks last season. Turner is the centerpiece of the Pacers’ future.\n\nWhen Buchanan and Pritchard worked together in Portland, they converted the Trail Blazers from one of the worst teams in the Western Conference into contenders. They did it by acquiring and developing Brandon Roy and LaMarcus Aldridge, two players with plenty of talent.\n\nPritchard and coach Nate McMillan in the past have compared Turner to Aldridge in terms of how their young center could become an All-Star who is a foundational player for the Pacers. Buchanan agrees with the comparison. But he also sees differences between the two players that could benefit the Pacers.\n\n“There’s some similarities in the fact that they’re both big men that can shoot the ball at a very high level,” Buchanan said. “Myles is more of a rim protector than LaMarcus was at the same age. I think Myles has more of an exuberance and youthful personality to him. LaMarcus is a little more reserved. If Myles can turn into LaMarcus, we’d be thrilled. And hopefully he can grow even beyond that at some point. I was a big believer in Myles coming out of college and I think his future is extremely bright for us.”\n\nBeyond achieving those goals, Buchanan is thrilled to be reunited with Pritchard. In Portland, they shared many of the same beliefs in terms of what is necessary to build a winning culture and team.\n\n“I love working with Kevin,” said Buchanan, who left the Charlotte Hornets to join the Pacers. “I love the challenge of building a team with people I love being around. I knew I was going to have that here. There was no risk coming here. There’s no getting-to-know-you process.”\n\nPritchard hired Buchanan in 2007 as the Trail Blazers’ director of college scouting. When Pritchard was Portland’s general manager from 2007-10, the team drafted Greg Oden and acquired Aldridge and Roy via trades during the draft. McMillan, the Trail Blazers’ coach at the time, saw firsthand how Pritchard and Buchanan outsmarted many other executives in the league to make Portland a contender before injuries to Oden and Roy dismantled their plans.\n\n“Look at the guys that that group put together,” McMillan said of Pritchard and Buchanan. “They do their homework and I think they do it well. They have a formula, a system that they use to the point where during that time I was working with them, you pretty much let them work because this is their time of the year of putting a roster together.”\n\nOn Friday, Buchanan was happy to be back with Pritchard and McMillan with another chance to rebuild a franchise. And Buchanan knows exactly what he needs to do — help the Pacers have successful draft selections — to make Pritchard’s vision for the Pacers a triumph.\n\n“Back in Portland, that was how we were able to put a team together,” he said. “That’s something we’re going to have to do here.”\n\nCall IndyStar reporter Nate Taylor at (317) 444-6484.
