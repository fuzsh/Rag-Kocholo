        "text": "/\n\n\"The Buchanans Ride Again\"\n\nJanuary 31, 2003\n\nHappy Horse Ranch, Northern California: Clint has received and read the script for his very special one-day return appearance as Clint Buchanan! He can't give away any details, of course, but reports that he is very delighted with the material and \"I'm really looking forward to doing this.\" More importantly, Clint says, \"I think the fans are going to love it!\"\n\nBe sure to tune in on FEBRUARY 19th to see Clint's return to Llanview!\n\nDecember 4, 2001: Bye-Bye, \"Blondie\"\n\nFrom the Editor/Webmistress\n\nFrom Erika Slezak's latest fan club newsletter:\n\nQuestion: Why does Ben no longer call Viki \"Blondie\"?\n\nAnswer: Because Gary Tomlin told him not to. Apparently, they had some focus groups and the result was that the people said that they couldn't stand it because they thought it was demeaning to have Viki called Blondie.\n\nQuestion: So they listen to these focus groups?\n\nAnswer: Apparently they do.\n\nQuestion: Who are these people?\n\nAnswer: I don't know . . . people that they round up from God knows where. They are all different ages -- a real cross section.\n\nEditor's note: It's about time that Gary Tomlin and the other ABC executives started listening to the fans! I, along with many, many other long-time fans have been saying for nearly three years that \"Blondie\" was an insulting, demeaning, and wholly offensive moniker for Victoria. Indeed, Clint Ritchie himself, while playing Clint Buchanan, once ad-libbed calling Viki \"Blondie\" during rehearsal. Ms. Slezak protested and the line was not used. So her public profession of love for her character's new nickname was always suspect, in my opinion.\n\nSoap Opera Weekly August 2001\n\n\"One Life to Live's\" Clint Ritchie: \"I Was Unimpressed\"\n\nWhen rumors began flying fast and furious that Clint Ritchie was - and then wasn't - making a comeback as \"One Life to Live's\" Clint, Soap Opera Weekly contacted the actor at his California ranch to hear what's going on, straight from the horse's mouth. \"They're probably bringing Clint back, but that doesn't mean Clint Ritchie's gonna play him,\" Ritchie reveals. \"I'm looking forward to seeing my recast. They haven't recast anything right yet, so I want to see how much they can f-k up with me,\" he adds with a laugh. Ritchie says \"One Life to Live\" Executive Producer Gary Tomlin offered him the chance to reprise the role he originated in 1979. \"But I was unimpressed.,\" the actor states. \"Gary told me, 'Well, we're thinking 5 to 10 shows for now.' I said, 'Five shows? It sounds like you're doing a Dr. Larry with me. That ain't gonna happen. I won't get on a plane for five shows. I've taken too many flights, one of them ain't gonna make it.' He made it sound like, because of the storyline that's happening with Jessica, Clint's coming back one way or the other,\" continues Ritchie. \"Gary said to me, 'Clint's a very important part of the show.' I said, 'Gary, Clint was a very important part of the show. But that died about seven years ago.' I love Gary to death. He ran a tight ship. People respected him. He knew what he was doing. I think if they (the powers that be) would just give him the show and let him run with it, he could turn it around. But ABC is very strange and has been for some time, ever since Disney got 'em. Back in that day, ABC Daytime was 1, 2, 3 across the board [in the ratings]. Now, if they go from No. 8 to No. 7, they throw a party. And there are only 10 shows on the friggin' air.\" If Ritchie were offered a longer stint , he'd consider going back. \"But that's a big 'if'.' If a frog had wings, he wouldn't bump his ass on the ground.\" When Soap Opera Weekly questioned Tomlin, he teased that someone big is coming back to the show, but the exec declined to say who. When pressed about a Ritchie return, Tomlin hedged. \"I don't know that that's going to happen, but we'll see.\" As for the return of other fan faves, like Andrea Evans as Tina and Robin Strasser as Dorian, Tomlin said, \"Andrea's doing very well where she is (on Passions as Rebecca). [The Tina recast] will be somebody who has not played the role before. And I would love if Robin came back some time in the not too far future. I don't know if that return would be permanent, but it's one of those things where it would be a lot of fun.\"\n\nSoap Opera Digest August 2001\n\nWill \"One Life to Live's\" Clint Ride Again?\n\n\"One Life to Live's\" got a major story shaping up for fall, but to tell it right, it wanted once crucial element; Clint Ritchie's (ex-Clint) return. \"We had some discussions here,\" reveals Gary Tomlin, indicating that \"One Life to Live\" clearly wanted the Buchanan brother back in the fold. Unfortunately, that may not happen. Although plans to bring him back seem to be moving along swiftly (inside sources indicated that it was all but a done deal), Tomlin now reports, \"Unfortunately, he's unavailable to us at this time.\" The reason for wanting the cowboy to return is till being\n\nkept under wraps, but there are plenty of reasons to bring Clint back to\n\nLlanview: Daughter Jessica and ex-wife Viki are both stressed by Allison\n\nPerkins' re-emergence. (Perkins kidnapped baby Jessica in 1986.) He could also want to meet his new \"mama,\" Gabrielle, who married Clint's pa, Asa, on the sly. In last week's Soap Opera Digest, Tomlin noted that it's better to have a brief visit by a fan fave than for a show to act as if he's off the canvas. \"You should take advantage of those wonderful people out there who may not necessarily serve your purpose on a day-to-day basis right now, but who can serve your purpose [for a while],\" he explains. Ritchie played the elder Buchanan brother from 1979 - 98, and has reappeared briefly since then. But when asked about a return in his SOD exit interview in 1998, the actor was vague. \"It isn't just about the writing and it isn't just about the money.\" Of course, there's a new writing/producing team in town. So, while negotiations have failed right now, sources say don't count Clint out for good.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~\n\nCASE CLOSED!\n\nOn Friday, March 16, 2001, the Nevada County, California, District Attorney dismissed all pending charges against Clint, with the exception of 1 misdemeanor charge of simple disturbing the peace. Clint agreed to enter a plea of \"no contest\" related to that single charge, pay a small fine (the entirety of which goes to Nevada County), and be placed on summary probation. The deal allowed Clint to avoid an extremely costly and, perhaps, protracted trial. Although Clint has always maintained --- and continues to maintain --- that he is innocent of any wrongdoing, the plea agreement allows him to put the entire unfortunate chapter, which has dragged on for more than sixteen months, behind him and focus on what is most important in his life: his beloved Happy Horse Ranch and his 35 horses, 4 dogs, innumerable cats, et. al. He is pleased with this result.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nNO TRUTH to Rumor\n\nAbout a New \"Clint Buchanan\"\n\nFrom the Editor/Webmistress\n\nI have personally investigated the suggestion (first heard on AOL from a notorious rumor-monger) that Gary Tomlin is either negotiating with or considering bringing Randolph Mantooth to the show in the role of \"Clint Buchanan\" and hereby confirm that there is absolutely no truth to the story. For more about how this rumor might have gotten started, see below.\n\nIs there a possibility that \"Clint Buchanan,\" portrayed by the role's creator, Clint Ritchie, could return to Llanview, accompanied by his son, \"Cordero\"?\n\nStay tuned . . .\n\nAttention Clint & Viki Fans:\n\nFormer \"One Life To Live\" Head Writer\n\nMichael Malone Provides\n\nthe Long-Awaited Answer\n\nQuestion: When you decided to break up Clint and Viki Buchanan (\"One Life to Live\") many long time fans were upset.\n\nWas it ever your intention to reunite them --\n\nsome place down the road?\n\nMalone: Breaking up a couple as firmly established in a marriage as Clint and Viki Buchanan can feel as traumatic to writers as the collapse of a marriage of real friends or family. That's how everyone at One Life felt when we made the decision to explore the dramatic possibilities in a mid-age extra-marital affair for Viki. We did so at a time when she was emotionally vulnerable because she had lost her daughter Megan, and chose as her partner General Sloan Carpenter, the father of the minister with whom she'd dealt with Megan's illness. here was tremendous dramatic potential in such a story BECAUSE Viki and Clint were such good people, had been through so much together, had shared children and a home, shared professsions (running the Banner together), and were both highly moral, fair, faithful leaders of their community. The story evolved directly out of the Accusation (the Billy Douglas/Andrew Carpenter homophobia story), which itself would later grow into the Marty's Rape story: What would happen if a girl was known in town to be a dangerous liar (she had falsely accused Andrew of making sexual advances to Billy because Andrew had rejected her flirtatious overtures), and she then accused four young men at the local university of raping her. Would anybody believe her, particularly if she then admitted that she'd made a mistake about at least one of the boys (Kevin Buchanan).\n\nAs the Accusation developed, we brought General Sloan Carpenter to Llanview and led him into conflict with Viki over Andrew's embattled effort to bring the Aids quilt to town. Viki's leading Sloan to a more compassionate, tolerant view of his homosexual son's death from AIDS (she ultimately persuaded him to join her in placing a panel in the quilt), evoked in them feelings for each other that both worked long and hard to suppress because of Viki's commitment to her marriage. At the same time, Clint took a different moral position on the issue and that distanced him from Viki. And at the same time, Dorian began in her inimitable way, to do everything she could to ferment jealousy.\n\nAll these threads worked to create drama: Viki's moral torture, Clint's pain, the children's distress, Sloan's evolution from a cold,withdrawn man to a loving heart--all gave us rich sources of story for months and months.\n\nWith an actress as astonishingly gifted as Erika Slezak, drama of that sort is a writer's joy.\n\nAfter Sloan and Viki married, Clint and Viki were able to reconnect and to sustain a friendship based on a love deeper than their hurt and loss, as Viki was struck by Sloan's critical illness and death.\n\nBut you know what? There is one moment I remember vividly that suggests to me an inevitable move back together of Clint and Viki. As least in the pure narrative sense (I mean, taking away all the external factors that control story in daytime--actors move to Hollywood, networks cut costs, contract negotiations fail, recasts don't work, etc.) That moment was a shot of Clint (tired and unhappy) walking up the stairs to be with a crying Jessica during the time when he and Viki were working out the divorce. I always thought of it as the \"John Wayne in The Man Who Shot Liberty Valence\" shot--it revealed Clint as the quiet man who would never stop loving a woman his whole life long. And that makes the audience hope that someday, some way, maybe she'd come back to him.\n\nRead the Malone Q & A in its entirety!\n\n~~~~~~~~~~\n\nCarolyn Hinsey Gives Her Opinion\n\nFrom Soap Opera Digest"
