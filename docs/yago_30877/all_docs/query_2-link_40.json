        "text": "Kevin recently sold our home and we found him to be very professional and easy to work with. He was determined to get the best price possible and that determination worked well for us! He had sound knowledge of the market and was a great communicator. We would have no hesitation in recommending Kevin to all prospective sellers.\n\nWe were very happy with the support Kevin provided from day 1. He has an excellent knowledge of the market and an intuitive feel for what is needed to prepare the property for the right target audience. His ability to always be in good humour and capacity to work with us, through even some quite difficult requests, was very much appreciated. We highly recommend Kevin and his team.\n\nKevin went above and beyond and delivered on his promises. Not only did he sell our home in under 9 hours for a fantastic price, but post-sale his communication was/is exceptional, as he continues to guide us through the end-to-end process.\n\nWe engaged Kevin and his team to market our home in Kellyville. Throughout the campaign, Kevin and his team work tirelessly to identify the right buyer to bring through our home and in the uncertain times we are all in now, managed to sell our property without compromising on our price expectations. Throughout the process they were open, honest, transparent, did not over-promise or try to readjust our expectations and worked towards a suitable outcome without pressure. We would highly recommend Kevin and Myles to anyone looking at list their home for sale.\n\nKevin has just sold my home in an uncertain and somewhat difficult market and managed to do so in record time. He did it with diligence, professionalism and an almost uncanny understanding of marketing strategies. He was straight forward, fair and honest with realistic expectations of price range for the property, and was spot on. His communication skills are second to none and a positive attitude always. The consummate professional. Totally recommend Kevin from Manor Real Estate to prospective sellers and buyers looking for a stress less experience.\n\nWe opted to engage Kevin due to his reputation for results in the Hills District market & he did not disappoint. His showed great enthusiasm & drive to achieve our desired result for our property. His communication was excellent from start to finish of the sale process. He also aided where possible in our search for a new property providing knowledge & useful information and contacting other agencies. We will definitely be returning to Kevin for our next sale & recommending him to family & friends.\n\nKevin was very professional in all his interactions with us and ensured we were kept well informed throughout the selling process. Kevin showed initiative and market expertise in his suggested marketing approach to attract the right buyers which showed through the speed of the sale. Kevin was available at all times on the phone and even went out of his way for the signing of the contract at 9pm.\n\nKevin is a conscientious, diligent and reliable agent that strives to achieve the best results for his clients. His knowledge of the market in the Hills district is incredible and he went above and beyond to ensure we were kept well informed throughout the sales process. It became clear very quickly why Kevin is held in such high regard by his clients and we have no hesitation in endorsing Kevin to all prospective sellers in the future. We achieved well above our price expectations which seems to be a common occurrence with the properties Kevin sells."
