        "text": "Kevin Roark, a beloved husband, son, brother, uncle and friend passed away at the age of 32 on Monday, December 11, 2023.\n\nKevin Roark is survived by his wife Maggie McGovern; his sweet Aussie-doodle Millie; his father Gregory Roark (Zionsville, IN); his mother Debora Lyon and her husband Keith Lyon (Newaygo, MI); his sister Shannon and brother-in-law Justin Jordens; his sister Ashley Roark; his cherished nephews and niece Riley Agbonhese, Anna Jordens, Bryson Jordens, and Aiden Thompson. His family was the center of his world, and he brought joy and laughter to their lives.\n\nKevin was born on October 19th, 1991, in Indianapolis, IN. He was raised in Zionsville, IN and graduated from Zionsville High School and went on to attend college at Radford University. Kevin and Maggie began dating in 2016. Their puppy Millie joined their family in 2019. She was his pride and joy. On February 14, 2020, Kevin married Maggie, his best friend and teammate since high school, in La Jolla, CA. Kevin and Maggie lived in San Diego, CA for many years before moving to Houston, TX in 2022.\n\nIn the beautifully diverse tapestry of Kevin's life, his adventurous spirit and passion for travel led him on an incredible journey across most of the United States and, most recently, through the enchanting landscapes of Italy. A nomad with a heart of gold that was always tethered to family, Kevin's travels often led him to the cherished company of loved ones, where he took immense pride in his nephews and niece, showering them with visits marked by warmth and affection.\n\nKevin's vibrant sense of humor illuminated the paths he tread, and alongside his beloved companion, Maggie, that path often led to the laughter they shared at countless comedy and theater shows. His love for golf and commitment to a daily regimen of physical fitness reflected not only a dedication to well-being but also a zest for life that touched all who knew him.\n\nIn his courageous and successful journey through the crucible of personal challenges, Kevin discovered an unwavering strength and resilience that fueled his commitment to giving back to his community. Becoming a beacon of support, he navigated his life's course and used his love for sports by becoming a dependable and trustworthy all-star as a financial advisor, a journey profoundly influenced by the wise guidance of his mentor, Bill Zimmerman. Standing steadfastly by Bill's side through the tribulations of ALS, Kevin drew inspiration from his mentor's indomitable spirit. In the wake of Bill's passing in 2021, Kevin channeled this inspiration to establish his own financial company in Houston, TX, rapidly ascending to the summit of success as a top producer for LifePro.\n\nKevin's legacy is a poignant narrative etched in the success stories of countless individuals and families, each a testament to his unwavering commitment to making a difference in the lives of others. Through his compassion, resilience, and the brilliance of his endeavors, Kevin's memory lives on as a source of inspiration, forever influencing the hearts and futures of those fortunate enough to have crossed paths with his remarkable soul.\n\nA service for family and friends will be held on December 29th, at Flanner Buchanan to celebrate Kevinâ€™s life.\n\nMay he rest in peace, and forever in our hearts."
