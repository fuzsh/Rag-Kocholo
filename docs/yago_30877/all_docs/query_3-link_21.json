        "text": "With a life that spanned nearly a century, Winifred Cramer made a significant impact in the lives of so many around her. She was the true matriarch of her family who was there for her children through thick and thin - a perfect combination of mother and friend. Winnie was known for her unconditional love and acceptance of others, and she never had an unkind thought or word to say about anyone. She worked hard throughout her life and wholeheartedly applied herself to whatever task lay before her. Life will never be the same without Winnie here, but the footprint she leaves behind will remain deeply embedded in the sands of time for generations to come.\n\nIf one could turn back the hands of time to the early part of the 20th century they would reveal an America that is remarkably different than the America we know and love today. We had struggles with unsafe working conditions and children who were overworked and taken advantage of in the workplace, yet we celebrated the introduction of the assembly line in 1914, which soon made automobiles more affordable for the average person. This same year brought great joy to one young family from North Dakota as they welcomed a healthy baby girl into their hearts and home on April 1st. Baby Winifred was one of ten children born to her parents, Guy and Cora Ellen (Reed) Brown, and she was joined in her family by her siblings, Mable, Kelly, Dale, Ernie, Cecil, Cora, Mike, Alice, and Vic. As a young girl Winnie and her family made their way on a wagon train from out West. They found work in the fields as they went, and their life was anything but easy as while on their journey a relative died and was buried along the trail. The Brown family finally made it to Michigan and settled on the east side of Kalamazoo near the train yard that is now by the viaduct.\n\nAs a young woman Winnie experienced new and exciting changes when she made the acquaintance of a young man named Charles Cramer through a young man named Dayton who ended up marrying into the family. After getting to know one another, Winnie and Charles found themselves in love and were married in 1930. The newlyweds initially settled in Van Buren County and then moved to Lawton. As a young bride Winnie worked in the home of the family who owned Abram’s Dry Goods Store. It wasn’t long before the couple was blessed with three wonderful children: Virginia, Ernie, and Randy. When her children were small Winnie began working at Welch’s, and her work later took her to the Kalamazoo Paper Box. Later in life they owned the Speedy White Laundry.\n\nThere was nothing of greater importance to Winnie than her family. She was an attentive mother who was always there for her children. They were a close knit group who enjoyed spending time together, and their Saturday night excursions to the Strand Theater for Westerns in black and white were certainly memorable. The Cramers always liked outdoor activities and camping up North in addition to renting cabins in the Upper Peninsula. They also owned a cabin on Christie Lake. Her husband was a great fisherman, which was something Winnie never cared much for, but she made the best fried fish, hands down.\n\nAll who came to Winnie’s house would agree that she ran her home like a well oiled machine. The Cramer house was where all Winnie’s children liked to hang out with their friends as their home was always welcoming and the kids were accepted for who they were. Winnie and Charles worked as a team with their extensive garden as he was the one who tended to the vegetables while she cooked them to perfection, despite the fact that she didn’t eat vegetables herself. When it was time for dinner, Winnie had a certain call to rally the troops that was well recognized throughout the neighborhood.\n\nAlthough her focus was always on her family, Winnie’s life was greatly enriched in other ways as well. Their friendship with the Striech family always meant so much to her, and the Striechs were included in many of the Cramer family activities. When grandchildren joined their family Winnie was overjoyed as there were simply more people to love. She could just sit and watch her grandchildren play for hours on end and was doubly blessed with 13 great-grandchildren. Winnie frequented yard sales with her daughter where she stocked up on books to last her through the winter, and her book collection grew to include every Danielle Steele book. She always enjoyed going for drives and when Virginia was no longer able to take her, Ernie took over and enjoyed spending time with his mother.\n\nLater in life Winnie continued to embrace the days she was given even though she faced some hard times. She was deeply saddened with her husband’s death ten years ago, but she drew strength from the love of her family during the days, weeks, and months that followed. Winnie was blessed with good health and was able to live on her own until just one year ago when her health began to decline.\n\nWith a heart that beat to love those around her, Winifred Cramer’s every thought was focused on how she could serve others in ways both great and small. Her life exemplifies what it means to be a woman of grace, compassion, and humility. Winnie was a no frills sort of woman who was content in whatever light brought her whether times of great joy or days filled with deep sorrow. She will be deeply missed while her memory is forever cherished.\n\nWinifred Cramer died on January 23, 2012. Winnie’s family includes her 3 children; Virginia (Chris – deceased) Eggert, Ernie (Doadie –deceased) Cramer, Randy (Darla) Cramer; 5 grandchildren, Sandy (David) Wright, Rod Cramer, Dana (Kevin Sr. – deceased) Kniss, Ryan (Krista) Cramer, Megan Cramer; and 13 great-grandchildren. Winnie was preceded in death by her husband, Charles; grandchild, Cliff Eggert; and siblings, Mable Kemp, Kelly Brown, Dale Brown, Ernie Brown, Cecil Brown, Cora Edgerly, Mike Brown, Alice Brown, and Vic Brown.
