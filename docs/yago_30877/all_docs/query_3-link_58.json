        "text": "Another article, saying much of the same things, but yet another one that's not calling out the great startups in the US that are working to make pet care more affordable by focusing on tele-health and at-home (Otis Pet, BrilliantPad, MySimplePetLab), making clinics more efficient (Digitail and Mascotte | Client & Operations Support for Vets), creating whole new categories (Loyal, Mella Pet Care, MedcoVet) and helping when petcare becomes impossible (BestyBnB) among so many others (ahem... like Snoots coming at you soon America). Affordability is a very real problem and we're building Snoots precisely for the people mentioned in this piece. I take every single story personally. But all is not lost. The future is bright. We need to trust our innovators in this category to bring affordability and new technologies to the pet space. The fact that pet-care has become \"big business\" means startups and investors are motivated to create new and innovative solutions and solve this problem.\n\nOne of the most heart-breaking pieces of news I heard in 2023 was about the shutdown of Fuzzy. It's not because I was associated with the company. I wasn't. It wasn't even because I was a user of the service. It's all because I felt it was something great, and now it's gone. Back in the day, when Deor was all about pets and the pet marketplace, Fuzzy was the place I truly loved and followed. It was my go-to place whenever I thought about the pet tech industry. When we discussed design, Fuzzy was the service I showed as an example of great design in the industry. When we talked about copy, support, quality of service, and the brand we wanted to build - Fuzzy was somehow my North Star. I followed them for months, reading their content, living by their activities. I somehow felt like I was part of the team. And now it's gone. Of course, there were (and still are) other services doing a great work in the same vertical. Some of them were bigger than them. Some had a healthier business model, were better funded, and maybe even offered a better quality of service. Let's look at Dutch Pet, Inc. for example. They are still doing a great job! But still - for me, Fuzzy was the place I loved to be and look at. I still truly believe in the #pettech market. I still believe that digitalization in pet and #veterinary care is significant and will grow substantially. And yes, I still believe that veterinary #telemedicine could be a huge thing and has enormous potential. Let me quote Dr. Cherice Roth here: ‚ÄúThe mission and vision ARE right. 1). Fuzzy was proof that you can perform excellent telemedicine that is safe, scalable and able to generate real revenue week over week. 2). Pets deserve access to veterinary care and with an NPS routinely north of 70 Pet parents had been waiting for care like ours. 3). This was NOT a failure of Veterinary telemedicine it was the failure of a veterinary telemedicine COMPANY. I sincerely hope that the traction and the data we were able to collect is shared so that this movement can continue.‚Äù I still keep my fingers crossed for all the businesses that are working hard to revolutionize the industry. Keep fighting, guys. It will be worth it.\n\nThere is a plethora of information out there, (with some being incorrect). Even with the right information, we often lack the most important part - How to implement! This is where my approach stands apart. Through my journey, I've pieced together a comprehensive understanding of pet health, recognizing that we cannot solve a puzzle with missing pieces. Einstein said \"insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results\" It's time for a paradigm shift. We must transition to a new paradigm where we identify and resolve the root cause of dis-ease. In order to accomplish this, pet parents and veterinary professionals must expand their \"toolkit\" to include alternative/complementary methods and learn the strategies to know WHEN and HOW to implement them effectively. Empowered Pet Parents + Transformed Vet Medicine = Healthy and Thriving Pets No more relapses, no more treatment failures. Begin changing pet lives today!!!

Most pet parents say yes, absolutely. But the professionals (and the data) are telling another story üê∂üê±üìà While we already know that keeping pets at healthy weight can help them live longer, obesity is still one of the biggest preventable problems facing cats and dogs today. And UK pet parents, despite their best intentions, are often unwittingly complicit in the problem. Obesity makes our cats‚Äô and dogs‚Äô lives shorter. So why wait to deal with it? That‚Äôs why we‚Äôre kicking off our Why Weight? campaign - as we want pet parents to be able to better engage with the issue of pet weight at an earlier stage and, with the help of their veterinary team, take preventative action to stop it ever becoming a problem. Best of all, we've got a brand new report packed with fresh research, and a tonne of other educational content on all things pet weight. Interested?
