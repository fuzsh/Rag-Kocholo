        "text": "After a yearlong search, Oak Park High School has found a new principal. Kevin Buchanan, currently an assistant principal at La Canada High School, will take over the OPHS post on July 1.\n\nBuchanan replaces Lynn McCormack, Oak Park’s interim principal this year. McCormack retired from Oak Park in 2008 and was replaced by Andi Mallen, a former Palm Desert High School assistant principal. Mallen resigned less than a year later to pursue other interests.\n\nThe district interviewed several candidates but postponed the search when a qualified administrator could not be found. McCormack come out of retirement to resume the principal position for one year.\n\nOak Park School Superintendent Tony Knight congratulated Buchanan, 50, on his appointment.\n\n“Kevin’s goal in coming to Oak Park is to provide the leadership, vision and energy necessary to successfully guide our collaborative and professional learning community,” Knight said.\n\nLaura Hicklin, Buchanan’s secretary for seven years at La Canada, said she is going to miss him.\n\n“He’s a great leader, so smart, truly a great person. He’s just going to be the perfect fit,” Hicklin said. “It’s such a loss for us.”\n\nBuchanan said he’s looking forward to getting to know the Oak Park staff, faculty, students and community. He and his wife, Socorro, are house hunting in the area. Two of their three sons will attend Oak Park schools in the fall. Their oldest, Jordan, is graduating from La Canada High this year. Colin is in sixth grade and Liam in second grade. The family currently lives in Van Nuys.\n\nLa Canada High is similar in size to Oak Park High but encompasses seventh through 12th grades. The combined student population is 2,200, of which 1,475 are high school students. Oak Park High has about 1,200 students.\n\nThe California Department of Education Academic Performance Index ranks the La Canada Unified School District second in the state behind San Marino schools.\n\n“La Canada is a very highachieving school with an extremely involved community and high expectations,” Buchanan said. “That has kind of prepared me for moving into Oak Park.”\n\nAs La Canada’s assistant principal for curriculm and instruction, Buchanan oversees teachers and staff, daily activities, scheduling, guidance, Advanced Placement and state testing, and college preparation, among other duties.\n\n“Running a high school has a very diverse daily set of challenges,” Buchanan said. “You’re dealing with teenagers, and teenagers can be unpredictable. I like the fact that every day when I walk into the school I never really know what that day will bring.”\n\nLa Canada’s middle and high school teachers and staff work closely together. Middle school students have access to the high school’s foreign language, athletics, arts, computer and math programs. Buchanan hopes to explore similar opportunities in Oak Park.\n\n“Our middle school teachers know what’s expected at the high school because they all attend the same department meetings,” Buchanan said. “Kids walk into a ninth-grade lab and already know the protocol, which cuts down on time and allows them to immediately start on their assignments.”\n\nBuchanan acknowledged that these are difficult times financially.\n\n“It’s absolutely super important that everybody pulls together to make sure we reduce the impact on the classroom as much as possible,” Buchanan said. “We have to make some tough decisions, and we really need the support of our communities to help us get through this period.”"
