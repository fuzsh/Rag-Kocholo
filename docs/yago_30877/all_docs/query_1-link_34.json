        "text": "The coming months will be a challenge for Oak Park Unified School District. In addition to the role the pandemic will play in 2021 public education, the district will also face the uncertainty of leadership under a new superintendent. Longtime leader Tony Knight is retiring in June after 17 years on the job.\n\nAdding to that shake-up, the district is searching for a new principal at Oak Park High School after Kevin Buchanan, who’s been in his post for 11 years, announced he would be stepping down at the end of the semester. Buchanan took a job as the principal at Los Gatos High School in Los Gatos, California.\n\nBuchanan said he’s proud of his accomplishments at Oak Park High, especially the role he played in leading the Ventura County high school through the pandemic.\n\n“Despite all the challenges, I’m really proud of our staff, our teachers, our students and even our community for just getting down to business, making things work and being flexible. I think we faced up to the challenge very well,” Buchanan said. “We’ve gotten two California Distinguished School awards and we’re a Gold Ribbon school recognized for our career and technical education program.”\n\nBuchanan was also instrumental in helping grow the OPHS music program into a full-fledged marching band, increasing enrollment and expanding the athletics programs, among other things.\n\nThere’s no time for nostalgia though. Before he leaves, Buchanan must oversee a return to campus for students in grades nine through 12, and plan one last graduation ceremony while still in the strictures of the pandemic. The challenge will be knowing what will be permissible under county health rules and what will not.\n\n“It’s going to be a different end to the year. I’m making sure the school is ready and set up for the next principal so they can be successful,” said the father of three. “We’re really trying hard to make graduation happen in person. I’ve been down to the football field multiple times with my measure wheel, (measuring) for seats and spaces, and we’ve got a committee of parents we’re working with to add things that will make it special.”\n\nTwo of Buchanan’s children are OPHS graduates—one of them a member of the class of 2020. He said the timing with the new position worked out because he didn’t want to interrupt his son’s last year of high school.\n\nSuperintendent Knight, who is also leaving the district at the end of the school year, said he’s happy for Buchanan.\n\n“This is a wonderful opportunity he’s pursued in Los Gatos. It’s a great school, it’s a huge promotion for him in many ways. I’m really pleased for him,” Knight said.\n\n“It’s a great opportunity for him and a huge loss for us but it won’t be a bad thing for the district. I have confidence we’ll find a new leader to continue the work Kevin’s been doing.”\n\nThe search for a new principal is already underway, and Knight said he hopes to have a candidate selected by the time he steps down from his position as superintendent this summer.\n\n“It’s been a terrific experience working at OPHS. The district and the community are super supportive,” Buchanan said. “We’ve overcome a lot— the Woolsey fire, Borderline, COVID.\n\n“It’s a busy job, so I wish the new principal a lot of good fortune. I hope everyone will support them because expectations are high,” he said."
