        "text": "An Elizabethtown man has been accused of raping a relative younger than 12.\n\nKevin E. Buchanan, 50, was arrested by the Elizabethtown Police Department Thursday night and charged with first-degree rape and incest, with the victim under the age of 12.\n\nThe arrest citation, according to The News-Enterprise, said the victim told school officials that she was having emotional issues, before adding that she had been molested several times by Buchanan. She accused Buchanan of last raping her in May.\n\nBuchanan was lodged in the Hardin County Detention Center on a $50,000 cash bond.\n\nBy Ken Howlett, News Director"
