        "text": "Roger D. Buchanan, 55, born Sept. 15, 1953, passed away June 16, 2009 in Las Vegas, Nev. due to complications following heart surgery. He was born and lived in South Range until moving to Henderson, Nev. in 1993, with his best friend and wife of 31 years Kathy (Landin) Buchanan.\n\nRoger and Kathy traveled anywhere and everywhere they could throughout the United States and were inseparable.\n\nRoger was currently employed with Stanley Consultants of Las Vegas and was a senior graphics designer for the past 11 years. For those who knew Roger, he was the man who could fix and build everything. His talents and generosity were beyond belief. He was loved by so many.\n\nHe is survived by his wife Kathy, who he married on Feb. 25, 1978. He is also survived by one daughter Stacy Buchanan (Jack Engle), one son, Eric Buchanan, two granddaughters, Ashley and Katie and one grandson, Dylan Engle, all of Henderson, Nev.; two brothers, Mike (Carol) Buchanan, Bruce (Jeanne) Buchanan, of South Range and mother Eileen Peterson of Superior, Wis.; many brothers- and sisters-in-law, aunts, uncles, nieces and nephews; and so many dear friends.\n\nPreceding him in death was his father Kenneth Buchanan Sr.; brothers, Kevin Buchanan and Kenneth (Rhino) Buchanan Jr.; nephew Joseph Buchanan; and many others.\n\nPer the agreement between Roger and Kathy, no religious services will be held. To celebrate Roger's life, there will be a backyard BBQ on Saturday, June 20 at 2 p.m. at his residence, 2410 Greens Avenue, Henderson, Nev. This was Roger's favorite thing to do; just to have family and friends over to eat, drink and be merry.\n\nOur family is in shock and deeply sadden over this; hopefully time will heal us all."
