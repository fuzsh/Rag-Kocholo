        "text": "Obituaries\n\nView Visitation & Service details >\n\nLester C. Cramer Jr, 72\n\nJanuary 20, 2017\n\nLester C. Cramer Jr grew up on a farm in Strasburg Pennsylvania where he graduated from Lampeter Strasburg in the year of 1962. After graduating Lester joined the United States Navy where he served three years. After returning home from the Navy he married his long-time girlfriend Marilyn (Weller) Cramer, and had two daughters Michele and Kelli.\n\nHe was very passionate about helping others throughout the community. He was a committed paramedic for St. Joe’s hospital in Lancaster for six years. The act of helping others was carried throughout his life such as participating with Make-A-Wish, St. Jude’s Children’s Hospital and benefit rides on his Harley throughout the community.\n\nLester also known as “poppy” was a dedicated grandfather to five grandchildren. The whole family looked forward to yearly trips to the beach where he made sure he was the last one to come off the sand each day. One of his favorite destinations was Maine where he enjoyed hiking, campfires, searching for wildlife, and looking for the next adventure together. Summers were spent by Poppy and Grandma’s swimming pool where we all enjoyed cookouts, music, and quality time. Quality time was of most importance to him. He made sure he never missed a school or sporting event for his grandchildren no matter the distance. A yearly trip to the Gettysburg Battlefield was a must where we hiked and he shared his love for American history. Along with his love for history he made yearly trips to all the local Native American Pow-Wows with his grandchildren.\n\nIn addition to his wife, he is survived by two daughters, Michele wife of Robert G. Trout of Lancaster, Kelli wife of Timothy Keyes of Lampeter; Five grandchildren, Briana Keyes fiancé of Bill Hinkle, Haley Keyes companion of Tyler Baum, Devon Keyes, Ashlyn Trout, Layne Trout and a great-grandson on the way in May. Also surviving is a brother, Paul Cramer husband of Jean of Lititz, niece, Erin Cramer of Lancaster and his yellow lab, Tucker which he adored.\n\nLester C. Cramer’s personality was one of a kind. He spent every day full because he knew we’re never promised tomorrow. There was always something funny, inspiring or loving coming out of his mouth. He was always kind and saw the good in everyone. Lester was a wonderful husband, father, grandfather, father-in-law and would have been the best great-grandfather to his unborn great-grandson. Lester was an angel here on earth, and will continue to be our guardian angel.\n\nServices and Interment will be private and held at the convenience of the family. In lieu of flowers, contributions in Lester’s memory may be made to Leo’s Helping Paws, 1284 Wheatland Ave, Lancaster, PA 17603.\n\nLeave a condolence on this Memorial Page\n\nCondolences to the Family\n\nMarilyn and Micki:\n\nI am so sorry to hear about Les’s passing. I had so much fun running at West End when we had Les on Medic One. He was a great paramedic! I remember seeing him at softball games we played Micki. I saw Les several times at George’s in Willow Street. He was always smiling and upbeat. I hope your treasured memories stay with your family at this time.\n\nMy sympathy to all,\n\nKen Barton\n\nDear Marilyn and family,\n\nWhat a shock to read about Les’s passing. So sorry for your loss, Marilyn. I have lots of fond memories of you and Les from back in our school days. Sending our love and prayers at this difficult time.\n\nLove ~ Mel and Dot (Groff) Neff\n\nSorry for you loss I got to know les at Burkholder paving\n\nRyan Newswanger (huey)\n\nLes came into our lives on a May afternoon when our son, Christopher, was involved in a lawn tractor accident. He was 2 yers old. Les was on the ambulance crew that arrived at our house. Without a doubt, Les saved Christopher’s life that day. We consider ourselves truly blessed to have met Les. Chris lost his left leg above the knee and 50% use of his right hand but he is 41 years old and has a rowdy 4 year old son thanks to Les. A few years ago we met Les for breakfast with Chris so he could meet the man who saved his life. We will forever be indebted to Les for saving Chris that day. I know Les is hiking in Heaven today.\n\nLarry & Sherry Griest\n\nMarilyn, Michele and Kelli,\n\nI was so sorry to read of your husband/dad’s passing. I have so many fond memories from my childhood and teen years with him, and you Marilyn, cheering us on in softball. I will miss chance encounters with him up at Kendig Square at Georges. My thoughts and prayers are with you all.\n\nWith fond memories,\n\nKim McGaw Hake\n\nMarilyn. Thinking of you and your family. Lucy\n\nMariyn I am so sorry to hear about Les and his passing. I am glad that I introduced you and Les and that you had many years together.\n\ni wil call you soon.\n\nhugs and prayers\n\nFreda Rife\n\nDear Marilyn, Michele, & Kelli, & To the Entire Family,\n\nI am so sorry for your loss. Les touched so many people with his caring, kindness, & humor. I worked with Les @ St. Joe’s Hospital & He was one of a kind. He always made me laugh. He helped me through a rough situation a few years back & I always appreciated talking to him & Marilyn. I am saddened but so glad I knew him cause he was REAL! I hope Heaven is ready for Lester cause he was a great guy, so funny. He always tried to help anyone in distress. We have lost a great person but his memory will always be with us. I will keep all of you in my prayers.\n\nSabby (Patty Sabatini)\n\nWe have known Mr. Kramer since we were kids. He was always smiling and kind hearted. We had the pleasure of reconnecting with him when our daughter made friends with one of his granddaughters. He was so surprised the day of her party (he remembered me as a kid) we talked for awhile and was more than willing to “stick” around to help.\n\nA few years down the road we connected with him again when our younger daughter was up for a Make A Wish trip. He was so pleasant and smiling. Anything I can do for you to make this happen I will do it. Loved seeing him again and our daughter actually hugged him when he left. She was 3 at the time and still knew a great man when she met one.\n\nA couple months ago we saw him and his wife while going out to dinner. We said hello and later he came over to our table just to clarify we were who he thought we were. He was so grateful we said hello and thrilled that our daughter was a survivor and cancer free.\n\nSorry to babble on about Mr. Kramer but I wanted you all to read how very special your Poppy was and the great man that we loved. May you find peace on the memories and he is finally at peace.\n\nSincerely\n\nPeg Chapman\n\nHad many laughs with Lest. Our friendship lasted many years. We are losing a great guy who would help anyone at anytime. Our lost but Lest gain is to be present with the Lord\n\nMy condolence to the family, although I only knew Lester for two years during his time as a Medic on 6-13 X, I can say that he was a commited and caring man. The world has lost a great man. God Bless You.\n\nRev. James R. Alden DD\n\nAlamogordo, New Mexico\n\nLes was a great person. I met him when I moved to Willow Street in 1976. Ran a lot of calls with him both amublance and fire. Stay positive, GOD will help. John Singleton\n\nThe world has lost one of the most kind and caring individuals that I have ever known. Although I have only seen him occasionally in recent years, I will miss him terribly. His smile and humorous stories always brightened my day. God only made one Lester. I am honored to have had the privilege of knowing him.\n\nJoe Mayberry\n\nOur Sincere Condolences! Jay & Betty Ann Haverstick\n\nThe world has lost a special person. Working with Lester in the ER of St. Joseph Hospital was never boring. He was dedicated and caring. Add to that his sense of humor. Lester is in heaven with so many of his friends and coworkers.

Bishop\n\nI am so sorry to hear about the passing of this amazing man. He was always a large part of my life as I grew up and as I waited on him at the diner to serve him his coffee! I will always remember his smile and his love for helping children in their time of need. My thoughts and prayers are with Les’s family in this tough time.\n\nJessica Krow (Henry)\n\nLest was a very large part of my growing up and who I am today.

Please know I am paying for you, and sending hugs.\n\nDana (Morrow) Grimm\n\nMarylin, we were so sad to see Les’s passing. We have such good memories of your family when we lived in Willow Street.

As a neighbor of Les’s for 35+ years, we can attest to his always wanting to help others. He delighted in lending a hand when it was needed and you never had a ask, he was always there. We also admire the love and dedicatrion he had for his family. Nothing ever came before family and he was a role model for other fathers. God bless you Les. We love you and are really going to miss you. We were blessed to have known you for all these years. Dennis & Joyce"
