        "text": "Kevin William Dalton, also known as Big Daddy, passed away on December 31, 2023, at the age of 65 in Carmel, Indiana. He was born on January 25, 1958, in Indianapolis, Indiana.\n\nKevin’s love for Indiana University Basketball, particularly during the Bobby Knight era was unparalleled. He was also an avid fan of IU Football, despite the “Occasional” frustration. Passionate discussions about his beloved Dallas Cowboys with his wife, a die-hard Colts fan, were a regular occurrence. Additionally, Kevin had a deep affection for the Milwaukee Brewers baseball team. For several years he participated in a baseball pool with friends until they “changed the rules so he couldn’t win” as he liked to state.\n\nGolf was another of Kevin’s passions, both as a player and spectator. He and his wife hosted the Annual Big Daddy Open for several years, most recently at his favorite course, The Golf Club of Indiana. Good and bad golf was played, and great times were had by all. A special “Putter” award was given out each year for the longest made putt. Those that participated know what I am talking about. Not sure where that Putter is now but whomever has it, keep it with fond memories of Kevin.\n\nKevin also managed a recreational softball team called the “Ozone.” Named after his favorite song by Commander Cody and His Lost Planet Airmen.\n\nAlthough Kevin and his wife did not have children of their own, he generously volunteered his time to help his friends coach Little League Ben Davis Baseball and Football Teams, positively impacting the lives of many young athletes. He even organized a memorable team party at Hooters much to the consternation of a few parents.\n\nAs Kevin’s health declined and sports became more challenging, he found joy in gambling trips to Las Vegas and Biloxi, MS, specifically to the Beau Rivage Resort and Casino. Locally, he enjoyed trips to the casino in Anderson. He specifically enjoyed the annual Christmas eve trip with the Gambling Bunch which he humorously referred to as gambling with “The Baby J.”\n\nKevin and his wife embarked on various memorable trips together, including visits to Maine, The Outer Banks, Gulf Shores Alabama, Cancun, Boise, ID, Scottsdale, AZ and Denver, CO. Many, of course, included a lot of golf being played and “occasional” gambling. Throughout their travels, Kevin playfully teased his wife for her collection of souvenirs from each destination.\n\nHe was also an animal lover, and we had many pets through the years. Stella and Cooper miss their daddy.\n\nIn his 65 years he collected many good times and good friends who will miss him dearly.\n\nHe is survived by his loving wife of 30 years, Allison Dalton; two brothers, Greg A. (Gwen) Dalton and Don L. (Denise) Dalton; and step-sister, Debra (Richard) Lancey. He was preceded in passing by his parents, Don L. Dalton, Dorothy F. Stewart, and Harry A. Cowger; and his sister, Juli F. Gardner.\n\nA memorial gathering will be from 2:00 p.m. until 4:00 p.m. Friday, January 5, 2024, at Flanner Buchanan - Hamilton Memorial Park (Prairie Waters), 4180 Westfield Road."
