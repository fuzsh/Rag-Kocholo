        "text": "Obituary of Donald Buchanan\n\nIt is with sadness, the family announces the death of Donald Buchanan, of Erb’s Cove, Belleisle Bay, age 86, husband of the late Yvonne (Parlee) Buchanan, which occurred on Saturday, March 25, 2017, at St. Joseph’s Hospital. He was born on July 13, 1930 in Waterford, NB, a son of the late Cedric and Greta (Fanjoy) Buchanan. Don is survived by daughters: Marlene Leaver (Wilkie) of Belleisle Bay, Cindy Buchanan-Creamer (Tim) of Saint John, Christina Keenan (Ernie) of Hampton; sons: Ken Buchanan (Karen) of Saint John, Wayne Buchanan (Kim) of Rothesay; grandchildren: Heather Leaver, Duane Leaver, Trevor Thomas, Melissa Thomas, Michelle Stevens, Michael Buchanan, Ryan Buchanan, Brian Buchanan, Zoë Buchanan, Steven Creamer, Samantha Butts, Shannon Creamer, Matthew Keenan, Justine Keenan, Vanessa Keenan, Derrick Keenan; great-grandchildren: Josh Thomas, Ryley Thomas, Nathan Creamer, Tyler Creamer, Megan Creamer, Austin Creamer, Gerry Stevens, Logan Butts, Dekaisha Butts, Jaxon Butts, Baylee Butts, Rylan Creamer, Alexia Creamer, Willow Keenan, Joeseph Keenan; great-great grandson Grayson Moritimer; son-in-law Alan Thomas of Willow Grove and several nephews and nieces. Besides being predeceased by his loving wife Yvonne of 64 years, he is also predeceased by his daughter Debbie Thomas; grandson Kevin Buchanan; brother Douglas (Jean) Buchanan. In his early years, Don could be found fiddling with his antique cars, tending to his beautiful lawns and gardens, boating on the Belleisle Bay and listening and singing along to his favourite music. As the years went on you could always count on Don to attend local church suppers and strawberry socials. Don was known for his love of travel, playing shuffleboard, storytelling and easy going personality. Don was a social butterfly; whether you knew him for years through his Esso Gas Stations (Kane’s Corner, City Road, Marsh Bridge and Berwick), cards (Auction 45), Travel World (Florida), River Valley Runabouts Trailer Club (Fredericton) or just met him you could expect an invite to his yearly Corn Boil held on Labour Day weekend at his home on the Belleisle. To know him was to love him. Don’s family would like to thank everyone who visited and showed their support with a special thank you to Rick Benson and the staff of the 6th and 8th floors at St. Joseph’s Hospital for their attentive and loving care over the last year. He is resting at Reid’s Funeral Home (506-832-5541) 1063 Main Street, Hampton, NB with visitation on Tuesday, March 28, 2017 from 2 to 4 and 6 to 8 PM. Funeral Service, conducted by Rev. Kelly Hudson-Lewis, will be held from Hampton United Church at 11:00 AM on Wednesday, March 29, 2017. Interment will take place in Trinity Anglican Cemetery, Sussex Corner, NB in the spring. Memorials in memory of Don may be made to Bobby’s Hospice, Diabetic Association or to the memorial of the donor’s choice. Personal condolences to the family and donations may be made through ReidsFH.com"
