        "text": "Christine was breath of fresh air playing Viki for those six months she subbed for pregnant La Sleastack\n\nI'd only been watching OLTL for a couple of years at that point, but from what I had seen, Viki was a dull-as-dishwater character who looked matronly who served as the last connection to one of core families. I figured they kept her around to maintain that connection to the show's roots, much like AW kept the yawn-inducing Pat Randolph character around for her connection to that show's core family. Perhaps Viki had been an exciting character when the show debuted, but here 12 years later, she was stale and boring. The Pat Randolph character on AW was in similar state, originally exciting, but now stale.\n\nSuddenly, when Christine was playing her, Viki became dynamic and electric. I was fascinated to watch her. I suddenly cared about Viki and what happened to her. Others viewers were feeling the same way as evidenced in some of the letters in the soap magazines.\n\nI assumed the show would keep Christine as Viki and dump La Sleastack. It had certainly been done on other shows in the past. And the threat of that happening was something that kept actresses in line; reluctant to get pregnant and when they did, reluctant to ask for too much maternity leave for fear of being written out permanently or replaced permanently by the substitute .\n\nBut show stuck by Sleastack and she returned to the role. However, I think the possibility that she'd lose her job to Christine Jones scared her shitless, as it should have. She upped her game and started giving better performances. Much better performances. The writers began noticing that and gave better storylines to Viki.\n\nWithin a few years, Viki became the center of the show. That's something that would have never happened if La Sleastack hadn't upped her game as a result of Christine Jones doing such a good job as her sub.\n\nThanks, OP!\n\nSo I hopped over to some 1993 uploads and the show is on fire! This is my favorite era of the show. I'm enjoying it better than I did the 1989 uploads (though I do miss Gabrielle and Andrea Evans' version of Tina).\n\nMia Korf's Blair is a revelation. Too bad she's on her way out. She lit Asa up in front of the whole town and stupidly admitted to fucking Max on her wedding dress right before marrying Asa. So good! Good and stupid -- that's my Blair, no matter who plays her. Poor thang.\n\nJimmy DePaiva is still doing his Shouty McYellerson routine. Max is such a douche. He's a hot douche, but I always forget that when he starts acting self righteous. Don't understand him and Luna, but it's a good thing. Max always shits on my favorite female characters, so I'm glad he's with someone I don't care about. I like Elaine Princi's restrained version of Dorian. She's very good. Marty is drinking and slutting around town. Kevin, Todd, Powell, and Zack leer at her from their seats at Rodis. Lots of tension.\n\nBo and Nora are now flirting and I'm unclear on what he's up to now; that's why I asked the OP to start this thread. Don't know whether he's still producing soaps or if he is on the force yet. He was in the police station in the December 1992 episode I watched, but I got the impression he didn't work there yet.\n\nJust trying to get a timeline of how Bo jumped from a TV producer to the commander of Llanview's police force.\n\nR5- I am now of the opposite viewpoint- despite the show looking amazing and the Marty Saybrooke/Alex stories being really excellent, I find this Gottlieb era to be utterly boring bullshit. It's just so stodgy and boring. And this is coming from a huge Y&R fan- only other soap I really watched other than OLTL. I am so glad that you are digging Mia Korf- I LOVED her. People think she was horrible, but I really liked her then and now. And Nora was the only other great part of Gottlieb's tenure. Nora, Blair, Alex/Carlo, Marty- Pretty much it. And I did like Andrew. It was refreshing to have a minister as a main character- I really liked Andrew.\n\nI have had to admit to myself that I am a fan of the trashtastic and brightly lit Rauch era- by a mile. (and the 85-88 Rauch was actually quite a damn good show)\n\nAnd check out James DePaiva in the Gabrielle/Baby Switch storyline episode that was uploaded yesterday (from 9/11/89) he was an absolutelyhorrendous actor. Nearly Ron Moss bad. That episode in particular- he was godawful. Not a fan of his wife either.\n\nI watched that episode yesterday, R7. Watching Gabrielle as she was pummeled by Michael Grande was heartbreaking, but so, so real. Do they do stuff like that on soaps today? Doubtful. They're too busy catering to social media warriors and fanbases. Michael beat her mercilessly. It was a lot to digest, but so mesmerizing.\n\nI've never liked Max as a character. He's sleazy to me, but can be entertaining. I like Kassie DePaiva a lot. I think her Blair is an archetype that I recognize and enjoy. She's no master thespian, but she always had the ability to make me feel for her character. I can't say the same for her real-life husband.\n\nAnd yes, Mia Korf is wonderful! People think she was bad? Really? I couldn't take my eyes off her. She's stunning and dynamic. She totally fills the screen no matter who she's up against. I love Kassie, but if Mia had remained Blair, I would have been perfectly satisfied.\n\nGlad you're enjoying the 1989 episodes. They're definitely their own thing. There was just too much Sarah for me. I don't care about what happens to her, and since she ate so much of the show during that time, I find myself either rolling my eyes or fast-forwarding. Her sister, Megan, is better. But I haven't really connected with her. That's bad since she's set to take the baton in the Gordon Girls' relay now that Sarah is being rested.\n\nThe SON loon has at least 4 account, possibly more.\n\nOne is dedicated to a persona insisting that she, Scoche Marin, is mere minutes away from her first airdate as the new Katharine Chancellor.\n\nThe other three seem to talk about any variation of the following topics:\n\n- Snatches being eaten\n\n- Foot fetishes, but without having an understanding of how one works\n\n- Daytime actresses who have had a DUI\n\n- Daytime actresses who clogged the studio toilets\n\n- Any number of posters on SON, most of who we do not know. He's now mentioning a woman who posts at SON, and is the partner of a former Digest columnist. She is in the advance stages of a chronic disease/neurological issue, and he's harassing her. He's fucking around, and he is very much about to find out.\n\nR40, I like that we can have conversations where we can agree to disagree about certain things. I'm raising through this era at a very fast clip because I'm enjoying it so much. Meanwhile, I pretty much abandoned the 1989 episodes I started watching a couple of months back because they'd become a chore. That period did have its bright spots, of course. Just not enough to hold my interest for very long.\n\nJerry totally should have been a new character, R41. He was Clint in name only. I did, however, enjoy watching him camp it up after so many years of him playing Ross, who only got to raise his voice when he was yelling at his cuckolding young wife.\n\nThat reminds me of my issue with Blake: I actually liked Liz Keifer, but she's another actor I believe was wrong for the role. She was very warm, while Stringfield's Blake was ice-cold. I accepted Keifer, though, because I'd only been watching the show about a year when she took over. Now re-watching, I realize that Blake really lost something with the recast. She transformed from a driven business woman in charge of her life into Ross's wife, a woman who couldn't control her sexual urges (dalliances with Rick and Ben) and a mommy who wrote romances on the side.\n\nOf course those changes weren't Keifer's fault; yet I don't believe the character would have taken that route had Stringfield continued in the role. In fact, I doubt Blake/Ross would have even made it down the aisle, much less become a tentpole couple.\n\nGuiding Light is off topic in this thread, so I'll end by saying: I'm surprised by how much I like Karen Witter's Tina. It amuses me to watch her attempts to rein in Cain. It's like Tina is playing the Cord role during this era.\n\nWatching these old episodes are really reminding me of why I got hooked when I was young. I almost forgot how often characters simply left town when their storylines came to their natural conclusions. In the four months beginning 1993, so far, Blair and Leann have left town. We all know that Blair will return, but when she left, it was with little fanfare and felt right after her divorce from Asa. Especially since, other than Cassie, she had not a friend left in town.\n\nIn the last twenty years, it seems that soap writers would rather kill off people than allow them to take a breather elsewhere. And that's only because they usually plan on bringing them back from the dead.\n\n[quote] Since this is about Robert S Woods Bo on OLTL, what's the real scoop on why he left OLTL in 1086 to play Paul on Days of Our Lives? I mean he literally packed up and moved to the other side of the country to do DAYS from 1986-1987\n\nHe left OLTL NOT to join Days, but to break into Primetime & Film. But when you move to L.A. you literally sit by the phone and wait. The role of Paul Stewart on \"Days of our Lives\" dropped in his lap, and they promised him \"outs\" for pilot season and any guest spots\n\nSo he could either continue to sit by the phone, or do \"Days\", make money and still pursue pilot season.\n\nHe did one pilot, which nowhere, couldn't land many guest spots and his year on Days was joining phoning in five lines a week. When OLTL came calling after his one year in L.A., , he jumped at the chance to go back. Because at least he would get to act, instead of sitting by the phone and going to endless auditions.\n\nThis is your resident soap-loving elderdyke with a pressing message: \"Reverend Rutledge's window\" (the last Midwestern soaps thread) is now subscriber only. I've lifted my graying head and leaned against my teetering cane to beg someone to have mercy on fans of the Midwestern soaps and begin another one. I'm watching Guiding Light and want to rage into the cavernous asshole of this site about it.\n\nOr maybe not?\n\nA couple of weeks ago someone suggested we have one all-encompassing thread for cancelled soaps. What do y'all think?\n\nI know many of you are separatists. I get it. The worlds aren't always conducive to shared discussion. Yet it's grown quieter lately. Not many of us discussing these shows anymore. The silent generation is dead, the Boomers are on their last legs, and we Gen Xers appear to be the last to want to share memories.\n\nBack in the early 2000s when I first discovered DL, there was indeed one giant soap thread each month. All the soaps were discussed there. Current shows as well as cancelled shows. Unfortunately, the thread was always completely dominated by OLTL discussion. GH had a pretty strong following too. As did Days.\n\nAs a result, comments about other shows often got overlooked and/or drowned out That's why people started creating threads for the individual shows. So they could have a place to discuss their shows and not be drowned out by the OLTL discussion.\n\nI'm very much in favor of letting each individual show have their own thread.\n\nIf you want to experiment and create one giant soap thread, that's fine. I'll be happy to participate in that. However, I suspect you'll find the same thing happening as did 20 years ago -- one or two shows will dominate and people will create threads about individual shows.\n\nI can't say I blame them, R97. Carlivati made One Life to Live's last years unwatchable for me at times. The aspects he chose to concentrate on were ... interesting. The only thing Ron's and I agreed on was his seeming hatred for John McBain. The contest for this man's dick was bewildering. By the time they dragged poor Blair into it -- via some pity-marriage -- I threw up my fucking hands.\n\nThe only storyline Ron did well, IMO, was the Kyle/Fish story. He took his time. Built them up. I probably would have liked them better if they hadn't been surrounded by the Gigi/Rex/Stacy vortex. Though, Kim Andrews was awesome! Oh, and I liked Schuyler/Rachel, but that didn't last at all.\n\nI will admit to enjoying some of the show's last year. After it was canceled and they had nothing to lose, Carlivati and his team went bonkers in the best way.\n\nDon't FUCK with me, fellas! I'm typing this from an Undisclosed Location!\n\nRe-watching this era of OLTL, R118, I'm not surprised by Krimmer's performance. Some of the worst male actors of the show's history converged in 1993. That's what made Roger Howarth's ascendancy so damned easy. He really had very little competition. Who was there to stop him?\n\n- Casper van Dien - Wortham Krimmer - John Loprieno - Nathan Purdee - David Ledingham - Christopher Douglas\n\nNone of these were acting powerhouses.\n\nJames DePaiva was acceptable, except when he was yelling -- which was 75% of the time. Ugh. Christopher Cousins (Cain Rogan) was a good actor, but he never amounted to more than supporting or a side character. Robert Woods had aged out of the heartthrob role by this time. I love Phil Carey's Asa, but the only reason I accepted his obviously reading from cue cards is because I find the old coot to be so damn funny.\n\nThe women carried this show during this period. For real. The guys were just eye candy. Nothing wrong with that.\n\nButler didn't name Phil Carey in his book. He didn't name him (well, just saying \"the guy who played Asa Buchanan\") until much later in his Rialto Report podcast interview. He didn't name anyone by name in that whole story in his book, probably by the publisher's insistence due to fear of a lawsuit. Because Butler had very little filter. Based on the timeline, it would've been when Anthony George was playing Will Vernon at the time and Butler said in his book two actors (Carey and George presumably) had bet going who would get him first.\n\nHe also claimed the casting director promised him the role of Brad Vernon if he slept with him. He didn't, so he didn't get the part. He named the casting director by name in the Rialto Report interview, but I can't remember what it was right now.\n\nAny elders who watched during the 70s still here?\n\nI'm watching 1994 episodes where Dorian is on trial for Victor Lord's murder. Nora has been forced to defend Dorian. She is concerned Dorian is being too flashy. They keep talking about how wealthy Dorian is.\n\nDoes Dorian have more money than Viki? It sounds like she inherited the bulk of Victor's estate. A man like Victor would not have died without a will, so I'm asking if anyone recalls what it said. Not that the storyline could not have been rewritten.\n\nI've seen clips of Viki and Clint forcing Dorian from Llanfair during the 80s because Dorian felt she had a claim. I know Viki is rich, of course. But was she given a trust -- and then made the rest of her money from The Banner (and anything she may have gained from being married to Clint)?\n\n[quote] What are the legendary feuds?\n\n[quote] Zenk vs Schultz\n\nThey had a deep dislike of each other, but the animosity between Zenk and Hillary Bailey Smith turned into a. physical fight at least once and had the entire studio taking sides. It's the main reason why suddenly, the Tom/Margo/Barbara story was redirected into different directions.\n\n[quote] Kim Zimmer vs Beth Ehlers\n\nNah, this wasn't any kind of feud. Kim wrote about Beth in her book and said she was, in so many words, a black cloud of drama. But she didn't hate her at all. She didn't hate Watros, either, but they worked each other's last nerve for a while since they were on screen so much together, and their conflicts were way more intense than anything with Ehlers.\n\nI hope poor Colleen is just confused. Maybe she's talking about \"every single copy\" of the old TAPES ??? and not what may have been subsequently digitized.\n\nAfter the last P&G soaps left the airwaves, the company that got the licensing contract to sell these shows on the international market indicated that the shows were going to be encoded (converted-digitized). This was beyond the little DVD collections that had been produced.\n\nAnd when the DIGITAL unit of the company subsequently exhibited what they had available at MIPCOM, the catalog said how many THOUSANDS of hours of each show they could supply. Copy seen at link is from the MIPCOM catalog. And another feature article on MIPCOM exhibitors said that Broadway Video Digital Media had over 21,000 hours of these shows available on \"various platforms.\"\n\nIt would make sense if they got rid of all those old tapes and digitized them for possible streaming. That's what Retro has been doing with The Doctors.\n\nR307 Good, that gives me confidence that they truly have them, because Broadway Video is a legit company. Also, Lorne has always seemed to have, and to understand and appreciate all genres/aspects of tv. So I'm sure his company will be a safe pair of hands to keep them safe. I wonder how much they paid for them and how much it cost to digitize them. I'm not sure if Retro ever finished digitizing The Doctors. If you go on any of the free apps that simulate cable tv liner channels such as CBS's Pluto, and a section of NBC's Peacock, etc... some of them are programed by the app using their on-demand library but some of the channels are real channels that are distributed on multiple apps, I would imagine those channels generate a surprising amount of revenue. BV should do a classic soap one built around the P&G catalog. Since they already have them and spent money digitizing them, it would be stupid not to exploit them. Also, there is bound to be a surge in the ad supported free streaming model over the next few years.\n\n[quote] I'm not sure if Retro ever finished digitizing The Doctors.\n\nWhen COVID lockdown hit, Retro announced that they had to shut down their digitization activity for The Doctors - something having to do with access to the warehouse where the tapes are at and techs not being able to work. .. Then when lockdown was over, they said that they'd made the decision to not broadcast any newly-digitized episodes for TV or internet streaming until they'd completed the entire project. I don't know that kind of (financial) resources they have had or currently have dedicated to this project, but it sounds rather piecemeal (imo).\n\nIn any event, less than a year ago, Retro Television president, Joel Wertman, did a podcast interview, and at that time, the project was still a go."
