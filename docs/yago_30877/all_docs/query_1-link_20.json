        "text": "Julie Anne (Johnson) Buchanan, of Deep River, CT and Stowe, VT, passed away Tuesday, July 20, 2021. Julie was married for 44 years to the love of her life, Kevin Buchanan, and was the Mom of the brightest stars in her sky, Victoria (Tori) Buchanan and Elizabeth (Liz) Buchanan, and Grandmother to her sunshine Macallan Silva, Easton Silva, and Ryland Silva.\n\nJulie will be remembered for her grace, elegance, and caring way. She inspired everyone around her to pursue their own ideas and individuality. She had an unwavering can-do attitude and impressed upon her family the importance of travel. She brought the world to her husband and daughters. Julie was as at home in the countryside of Austria, the bistros of Paris, the vineyards of Italy, the theaters of New York City, the beaches of Antigua, and the mountains of Lech, as she was in the gardens at her house in Connecticut, and in her beloved mountains of Vermont.\n\nJulie had an unmatched style. Anyone who witnessed her at work could see that Julie was a tireless chef and energetic hostess with an artist's touch for preparing foods presented in a fashion that caught the eye as well as pleased the pallet. She studied Culinary Arts at Johnson & Wales University and spread her love of food through her shoreline catering company, Hors D'oeuvres by Julie. She continuously developed her interests and pursued an education in nutrition, graduating with a masterâ€™s degree from the University of Saint Joseph. Julie was a compassionate advocate and counselor for young families and children as a Registered Dietitian for Connecticut's WIC program.\n\nA lifelong and enthusiastic participant and supporter of the arts, she was a skilled vocalist and pianist. Julie was a master tap dancer, continuing to train and perform well into her fifties. She had a passion for musicals, Broadway, and live music and took any opportunity to go to the theater. Julie had a special love for and was a supporter of The Goodspeed Opera House and the Norma Terris Theater.\n\nJulie was the daughter of Richard and the late Alice (Loane) Johnson of Wallingford, CT. She is survived by her loving husband, Kevin, her daughters and their families, Victoria Buchanan, of East Lyme; Elizabeth Buchanan and Alex Silva, of Deep River; and her three grandchildren, Macallan Silva, Easton Silva, and Ryland Silva. Julie is predeceased by her daughter, Katelyn Buchanan.\n\nIn addition, Julie is survived by her siblings; Robert (Elaine) Johnson, Jennifer Short (Ken Welch), Sarah Johnson; siblings-in-law, Robert Buchanan, Lynn (Nick) Colicchio, Lori Buchanan; her nieces and nephews, Richard (Sharon) Johnson, Kristen (Mike) Woody, Jennifer (Trent) Larson, Melissa Buchanan (Steve Kutsera), Catherine (Jay) Morgan, Heather Carr, Brandon (Kasey) Carr, Mitchell Carr, Connor Colicchio, Paige Colicchio, Edward Short, and her great-nieces and -nephews. Julie is predeceased by brothers, Bruce A. Johnson, and Richard A. Johnson, Jr, and niece Taylor R. Short.\n\nJulie and her family are eternally grateful to her guardian angels and caregivers; Euda, Jacinth and Dawn.\n\nCalling hours will be Friday, July 23 from 4 to 6 p.m., at B.C. Bailey Funeral Home, 273 South Elm St., Wallingford, CT.
