        "text": "Glenna Muriel Sharpe was born May 11, 1943 in Corbin, Kentucky. She was one of six children born from the union of Bart and Dova (Prewitt) Sharpe. In 1961, Glenna was a graduate of Monroe High School. She would later become a Teacher’s Aide and Lunchroom Aide within the Monroe Educational System. After the death of her first husband, Michael McManaway, on April 20, 1970, Glenna would later meet then marry Randall “Randy” Cramer On October 15, 1976.\n\nIn her quiet time, she relished reading, especially Danielle Steel novels, as Glenna has every book the bestselling author has written. She would quilt and crochet afghans for many of her family members. Wordsearches were also among her favorite thing to do to relax. She equally enjoyed watching the Hallmark Channel and was an avid fan of any of the Holiday movies and The Golden Girls. Even though Rose was her preferred Golden Girl, Glenna could often be heard telling the family and her hairdresser she wanted her hair to be styled “just like Blanche’s”.\n\nAbove anything, family was of the utmost importance to Glenna. She especially cherished the time she spent with her grandchildren and great grandchildren. Glenna was known to be the glue and the rock for her family. She always put others’ needs in front of her own. She would gladly go in need so someone else would not have to. At every family gathering, Glenna would be the last person to eat her food because she wanted to make sure everyone else had a plate full and were comfortable.\n\nGlenna Muriel Cramer, age 77, passed away at ProMedica Hospital, Monroe. In addition to her passing, she is preceded by both her parents and seven siblings: Wymer, Waymon, William, Helen, Alma, Willard and Warren.\n\nTo cherish her memory, she leaves her loving husband: Randy; her children: Kelly McManaway, Kenneth (Maria) McManaway and Kim (William) Fell; seven grandchildren: Katelyn, Antionette, Shane, Jacklyn, Paige, Alexis and Sydney and four great grandchildren: Aubrey, Kathryn, Teagan and Gerald."
