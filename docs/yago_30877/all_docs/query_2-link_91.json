        "text": "A teacher who indecently assaulted young girls has been jailed – but was told by a judge he’d “continue to fool himself and others” he has done nothing wrong.\n\nKevin Buchanan, 46, who worked part-time at Thames Valley University, molested his victims – licking their necks, stroking their legs and touching them intimately.\n\nHe was sentenced to 30 months at Reading Crown Court on Monday after being convicted by a jury on August 6 of four counts of indecent assault on the three youngsters.\n\nThe young girls were all under the age of 14 at the time of the incidents – between March 1, 2002, and May 1, 2002, between September 1, 2003, and December 1, 2003, and between January 21, 2003, and January 21, 2004.\n\nThe 46-year-old, from Elvendon Lane, Goring, was also convicted of inciting one of his\n\nvictims to commit an act of gross indecency between January 21, 2001, and January 21, 2004.\n\nDuring the trial the court heard how the father-of-two had taken advantage of his victims on four separate occasions.\n\nOn one occasion Buchanan told one of the girls to take her trousers off so he could see her thong, the court heard.\n\nAt his sentencing last Friday, Frank O’Toole, defending, said the offences were “not prolonged”, adding that the case had had a devastating effect on his life.\n\n“He has lost a huge amount – his respect, his employment, his home has been damaged and he has been forced to move away from where he was living,” he said.\n\nBut his arguments failed to sway Judge Stephen John, who sentenced Buchanan to 12 months for the licking and biting and touching the girls’ legs, 18 months for getting a girl to remove her trousers and 30 months for touching a girl under her jeans.\n\nThe sentences are to be served concurrently.\n\nHe said: “They were under your trust and you breached that trust – yet you continue to maintain your innocence.\n\n“You are in denial and I have no doubt that you will continue to fool yourself and continue to fool others about your behaviour.”\n\nBuchanan was disqualified from working with children and has been placed on the Sex Offenders’ Register for life.\n\nAfter his conviction for these offences he was also due to face trial for six counts of making indecent photos of children. But the jury was dismissed in relation to this."
