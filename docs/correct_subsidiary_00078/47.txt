After splitting from Det Norske Veritas (DNV) last year, DNV Petroleum Services (DNVPS) has changed its name to Veritas Petroleum Services (VPS), the company said today in an emailed statement.

The company, which provides maritime testing and surveys, has also adopted a new logo.

"Today marks an important milestone for us because our new brand identity completes our independence, legally as well as visually," said CEO Eirik Andreassen.

"Our new, signature teal blue, which is a blend of our maritime heritage colours of dark blue and green, embodies our organisation's DNA of intrinsic quality, integrity and reliability.

"The tint of fresh orange glow, on the other hand, symbolises our bright future as a vibrant, young company ready to be the bridge to deep knowledge and exceptional service for our clients."

The company will continue to offer technical expertise on fuel issues while entering into more joint projects with partners.

"Businesses today face mounting technological, financial, operational and regulatory challenges and risks," said Bill Stamatopoulos, the firm's commercial director.
