General\n\nA 100 Introduction\n\n101 This standard contains requirements for fabrication and testing of offshore structures.\n\nA 200 Objective\n\n201 The objectives of this standard are to:\n\n— provide an internationally acceptable standard to ensure the quality of all welding operations used in offshore fabrication, through identifying appropriate welding procedures, welder qualifications and test methods\n\n— serve as a technical reference document in contractual matters between purchaser and contractor\n\n— serve as guideline for designer, purchaser and contractor\n\n— specify minimum requirements for welding operations\n\nsubject to DNV certification and classification.\n\nFABRICATION AND TOLERANCES (includes pressure vessels and air receivers)\n\nA. General\n\nA 100 Objective and scope\n\n101 This section gives requirements for fabrication and tolerances\n\nof offshore structures.\n\nB. Fabrication Planning\n\nB 100 General\n\n101 As a prerequisite for fabrication, procedures, inspection and test plans and work instructions for execution and control of fabrication activities shall be established. The purpose of the procedures and work instruction shall be:\n\n— to provide instructions and information regarding the requirements for and the principles of the work execution\n\n— to identify and document the responsibilities and plans for the work execution in accordance with the project requirements\n\n— to provide information to the purchaser on how the work is executed and controlled\n\n— to identify applicable procedures, test plans, work instructions, acceptance criteria, hold points and documents to be generated\n\n— to serve as basis for quality audits.\n\n102 Relevant procedures, including information of pre-assembled items and the sequence of fabricating the parts into structure, shall be prepared.\n\nB 200 Quality system and workmanship (includes pressure vessels and air receivers)\n\n201 Fabrication of structural members shall have a documented and implemented quality system according to ISO 9001 or equivalent. The extent of the quality management system shall be dependent on the size and type of the organisation, complexity and interaction of the processes and competence of personnel.\n\n202 Workmanship shall be in accordance with E following written procedures agreed upon.\n\n203 All work shall be skilfully and carefully executed with adequate control by the contractor. All faults and deficiencies shall be corrected before the material is coated with paints, cement or similar. Repair work of significant extent shall be demonstrated as acceptable to the purchaser.\n\n204 Prior to commencement of the work the contractor shall submit a plan for NDT, NDT procedures and documents for NDT inspectors’ certification for acceptance by the purchaser. The programme shall contain information and documents for planning, controlling, reporting etc. Acceptance criteria for NDT shall be accepted by the purchaser if they are not specified in relevant documents.\n\nC. Inspection\n\nC 100 General\n\n101 Inspection shall be carried out in accordance with accepted inspection and test plans to confirm that work is carried out in accordance with established project procedures and plans such that all project requirements are complied with to the satisfaction of the purchaser.\n\nThe inspection shall cover items such as:\n\n— correct identification and documentation and use of materials\n\n— qualification and acceptance of fabrication procedures and personnel\n\n— inspection of preparatory work (assembly, fit-up form work, reinforcement etc.)\n\n— welding inspection\n\n— inspection of fabrication work for compliance with specifications and procedures\n\n— witnessing NDT, control and testing\n\n— inspection of repairs\n\n— inspection of corrosion protection systems\n\n— ensure functionality of examination or testing equipment\n\nand of recording and/or measuring devices vital for correct functioning of equipment and machinery used in fabrication. 102 Due consideration shall be given to the access and the time required for adequate inspection during fabrication.\n\n103 High non-conformance rates in execution of the work or in the product itself shall call for special considerations. Such special considerations may include, but not be limited to, increased inspection, re-qualification of personnel or other agreed remedial actions.\n\n104 Inspectors shall be qualified according to a recognised scheme and shall be able to provide documentation of proficiency.\n\nOther Third PAry inspectors include:\n\nLIST OF BODIES NOTIFIED UNDER DIRECTIVE : 2014/29/EU Simple pressure vessels\n\nName and address of the notified bodies Identification\n\nnumber\n\nResponsible for the following products Responsible for the following\n\nprocedures or modules\n\nAnnexes or\n\narticles of the\n\ndirectives\n\nAPRAGAZ A.S.B.L. 0029 Simple pressure vessels EU-type examination Module B Pressure Vessels and Air receivers Hydrophores\n\nChaussée de Vilvorde, 156\n\n1120 BRUXELLES\n\nBelgium\n\nTÜV Rheinland Industrie Service GmbH 0035 Simple pressure vessels EU-type examination Module B Pressure Vessels and Air receivers Hydrophores\n\nAm Grauen Stein\n\nD-51105 Köln\n\nGermany\n\nTÜV SÜD Industrie Service GmbH\n\nWestendstraße 199\n\n80686 München\n\nGermany\n\n0036 Simple pressure vessels EU-type examination Module B Pressure Vessels and Air receivers Hydrophores\n\nZURICH ENGINEERING 0037 Simple pressure vessels EU-type examination Module B Pressure Vessels and Air receivers Hydrophores\n\n126 Hagley Road\n\nEgdbaston Birmingham B16 9PF\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nLloyd's Register Verification Limited 0038 Simple pressure vessels EU-type examination Module B Pressure Vessels and Air receivers Hydrophores\n\n71 Fenchurch Street\n\nLondon EC3M 4BS\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nBRITISH ENGINEERING SERVICES LTD 0040 Simple pressure vessels EU-type examination Module B Pressure Vessels and Air receivers Hydrophores\n\n5 New York Street\n\nManchester M1 4JB\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nTÜV NORD SYSTEMS GMBH & CO.
