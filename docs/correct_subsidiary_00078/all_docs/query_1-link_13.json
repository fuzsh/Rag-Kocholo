The company currently has about 14,500 employees and 350 offices operating in more than 100 countries, and provides services for several industries including maritime, renewable energy, oil & gas, electrification, food & beverage and healthcare. It was created in 2013 as a result of a merger between two leading organizations in the field — Det Norske Veritas (Norway ) and Germanischer Lloyd (Germany ). DNV GL is the world's largest classification society, providing services for 13,175 vessels and mobile offshore units (MOUs) amounting to 265.4 million gt, which represents a global market share of 21%.

Prior to the merger, both DNV and GL have independently acquired several companies in different sectors, such as Hélimax Energy (Canada), Garrad Hassan (UK), Windtest (Germany) and KEMA (Netherlands), which now contribute to DNV GL's expertise across several industries. In addition to providing services such as technical assessment, certification, risk management and software development, DNV GL also invests heavily in research. Remi Eriksen took over as Group President and CEO of DNV GL on August 1, 2015, succeeding Henrik O. Madsen.\n\n1. Summary\n\nDNV GL's history dates from 1864, when Det Norske Veritas was established in Norway to head technical inspection and evaluation of Norwegian merchant vessels.[1] On the other hand, Germanischer Lloyd was founded in Hamburg around the same period in 1867 by a group of 600 ship owners, ship builders and insurers.[2] DNV GL celebrated its 150th anniversary in 2014.[3]\n\nOn December 20, 2012, the two companies announced the merger,[4] which was approved by competition authorities in South Korea, the US, the EU[5] and China, thus allowing the merger contract between DNV and GL to be signed on September 12, 2013. The independent Det Norske Veritas Foundation owned 63.5% of DNV GL shares and Mayfair Vermögensverwaltung 36.5%.until December 2017, when Mayfair sold its shares to the Det Norske Veritas Foundation.[6]\n\nTogether with Bureau Veritas and American Bureau of Shipping, DNV GL is one of the three major companies in the classification business with 300 offices in 100 different countries.
