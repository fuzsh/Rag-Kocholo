        "text": "Small fish beware: There’s another major merger in the sustainability-consulting-service industry. Oslo-based DNV, a venerable international risk management company, is acquiring the corporate sustainability agency, Two Tomorrows Group. With offices in the U.S., U.K. and South Korea, Two Tomorrows works with major clients in a wide range of sectors, including mining, global transportation, electronics, retail and health care -- offering a “full range of sustainability and corporate responsibility issues, managing risks and creating value.”\n\nThe deal \"brings together two organizations that have been supporting sustainability as it has evolved over the last 30 years,\" said DNV Group Chief Technology and Sustainability Officer Bjorn Haugland in Tuesday’s press release. “By joining forces with Two Tomorrows, we aim to become the trusted, independent experts in sustainability to global business and governments.\"\n\nThe announcement comes on the heels of DNV’s acquisition of a majority of shares in the Dutch energy knowledge company, KEMA -- and is just the latest in an ongoing trend of consolidation in the sustainability consulting world. Among other deals, Hitachi bought consultancy Prizim last month, and Deloitte bought sustainability consulting firms ClearCarbon Consulting and Domani Sustainability Consulting. As sustainability becomes a growing area for bigger players, that consolidation is likely to continue.\n\nTodd Cort, president of Two Tomorrows North America, calls the DNV acquisition part of a natural market progression. “There are few large players out there,” he said in a phone interview. “The big four accounting firms all have sustainability practices. To compete in the marketplace you have to have some size and scale. For DNV, they wanted to build up a practice within CSR, corporate social responsibility, and this is the most logical way to do it.”\n\nSeveral other factors are at play. With continued U.S. government inaction on carbon-emission regulation, the vanguard of \"green auditing” has been coming out of the European Union -- where, according to Reuters, \"companies need accurate counts of carbon discharges to comply with an emissions trading scheme.\"\n\nDNV is already a major player in the world of carbon capture and storage. And Two Tomorrows is known for its Value Rating tool – which holds corporations’ feet to the fire when it comes to sustainability practices. “Consulting firms can fall into this trap of rubber-stamping what companies do,” said Cort. Two Tomorrows has a reputation of not doing that. We don’t go out to name and shame, but we will go out and tell companies what to do to improve, and how to move toward that practice.\"\n\nAcquisitions can help a company grow in a new direction more quickly. “It’s the main way for a large firm to meet the large expectations of our clients,” Cort said. “To get already experienced people with existing relationships. So it makes more sense [for DNV] to acquire than to hire.”\n\n“We will continue to support companies and governments as they strive to meet not only the increasingly complex challenges, but also the growing sustainability expectations of the future, \"said Two Tomorrows executive chairman Mark Line in a press statement. “We are all aware of the continuing corporate scandals that undermine many claims about sustainable business practice. Working with our new colleagues in DNV, we will not shy away from telling the truth and advising our clients to do the right things in the right way.”"
