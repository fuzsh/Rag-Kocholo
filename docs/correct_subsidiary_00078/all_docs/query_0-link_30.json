EDITORâS LOG In today's vocabulary there are certain words and phrases that did not exist in my younger days and I am sure the same applies to the majority of our readers. One such phrase is âCyber Crimeâ. This would have meant nothing to us in the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s, 1980s and even the 1990s. However, Cyber Crime is becoming a big problem for the Maritime Industry. Cyber-attacks on the Maritime Industryâs operational technology systems have increased by 900% over the last three years with the number of reported incidents set to reach record volumes by the end of 2020. Itai Sela, the CEO of Naval Dome warned over a year ago at the Singapore Maritime Technology Conference that âSomebody, somewhere is targeting the maritime sector. The shipping industry should be on Red Alert.â He added, âA ship whose systems are under the control of the cyber-criminal could result in pollution, cause collisions or groundings, or be used as an incendiary device. The result could be catastrophic if a vessel is not secured to the highest level.â An attack on A.P. Moller-Maersk A/S cost the company about $300 million in 2017. Ports started to be hit in 2018 with Barcelona, then San Diego falling under attack. The Australian shipbuilder Austal was also hit and the attack on COSCO took down half of the shipownerâs US network. In April 2020 the large shipowner MSC was hit badly resulting in their headquarters in Geneva being closed for five days. In September 2020 CMA CGM, took down its worldwide shipping container booking system after its Chinese branches in Shanghai, Shenzhen, and Guangzhou were hit by ransomware, another new word in the English language! As the vast majority of the world's trade is carried by sea, it is of paramount importance that the whole of the Maritime Industry develops safeguards against such attacks which have the potential to brings the world's economy to it's knees.

America was officially completed on 16th April 1940 and on 4th June started the first of her sea trials. For these the ship had huge let- ters painted on her sides stating âAmericaâ and âUnited States Linesâ in an effort to defend against U-boat attack and to remind their commanders of the United States neu- trality. During the 24 hour run off the Virginia Capes, the America was put through exhaustive tests for steering, fuel consump- tion and overall performance. She returned to the shipyard the following day.

The shipâs official handing over date to United States Lines had been set for 2nd July but this date slipped due to the growing con- flagration in Europe and the uncertainty of when the America could be put into service. Consequently, the ship spent the best part of the month alongside. On 27th July she made her way to New York on her shakedown cruise with some 900 passengers onboard for the journey. It proved to be one they would never forget when the air conditioning system broke and temperatures across the ship rose steadily until they were near 100 degrees. Passengers were forced to strip off into just their underwear to deal with the heat. This problem was soon forgotten when the America made her maiden arrival at New York where she was welcomed in grand style. Sadly, because of the war in Europe America was now a passenger liner with nowhere to go, so instead of Europe the operators arranged a series of West Indies cruises, with the first leaving New York on 10th August 1940 taking in Havana, Port Au Prince, San Juan and St. Thomas in a 12 day itinerary. She maintained her program throughout the rest of the year and made two cruises through the Panama Canal to California. In May 1"
