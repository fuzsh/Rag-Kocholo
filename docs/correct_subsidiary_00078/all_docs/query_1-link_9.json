        "text": "Germany’s Mayfair VermögensverwaltungSE has sold its 36.5% share in the class society DNV GL to the Stiftelsen Det Norske Veritas foundation, making DNV GL the foundation’s sole owner.\n\nDNV GL chief executive Remi Eriksen said in a statement that this is a new chapter in DNV GL’s history.\n\n“Moving forward with one strong owner with a long-term view and a fully aligned purpose will be good for DNV GL’s customers and employees,” said Eriksen.\n\nThe DNV GL strategy, ‘Leading towards a digital, agile and efficient future’ remains unchanged. There will also be no changes to the management, organization, name or branding, according to the statement.\n\nDNV GL’s headquarters for the Maritime business area will remain in Hamburg.\n\nThe foundation sees assuming full ownership of DNV GL as the “best investment to fulfil its purpose of safeguarding life, property and the environment and to realize its strategy.”\n\n“The merger between DNV and GL has created significant value, and we are thrilled about the opportunity to invest in DNV GL’s long term success. 100% of the cash generated will remain within the group to support further development and positioning of DNV GL globally,” said Leif-Arne Langøy, chairman of the board of directors of Stiftelsen Det Norske Veritas."
