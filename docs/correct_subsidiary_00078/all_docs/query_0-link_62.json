The Marine Engineer And Naval Architect. LONDON, AUGUST, 1913. NAVAL POLICY, IT is seldom that a statement on naval policy has been awaited with so much interest as that made by the First Lord of the Admiralty in the House of Commons last month, and the fact that such state- ment dealt largely with the important question of oil fuel for the navy gave it an exceptional interest to marine engineers. Not only was the development in the use of oil fuel dealt with in considerable detail, but the extent to which the Admiralty propose to use such fuel in the future was fully gone into. It is interesting to note, having regard to what we stated in our May issue, that the First Lord's opinion is that \" the problem of oil fuel was not one of quantity, but of price.\" He said that the output of crude oil last year was 50,000,000 tons, and that the naval con- sumption did not amount to 200,000 tons. In addition to the foreign sources of oil there were home supplies available, after a process of manufacture has been gone through, such as oil from Scotch shale, which he estimated would produce 400,000 to 500,000 tons per annum for the next 150 years. In addition, he mentioned the existence of a large area of oil-bearing clays in England. We entirely agree with the view expressed that \"J;he open market has become an open mockery \" so far as oil is concerned. With these con- ditions to combat, and to avoid paying an excessive price for the commodity, the field of competition has to be entered and an entirely new policy promulgated. The new policy may be divided into two distinct parts, one for the present and the other for the future. The Admiralty can become the owner and producer of its own liquid fuel supplies, so as to deal with crude oil as it comes into the market at a cheap price. From the statements made it appears clear that for the immediate future steps have been taken to enter into a series of contracts for a period of five years whereby a regular and adequate supply of oil fuel can be assured until the main policy of State ownership of oil sources can be carried into active operation. The First Lord disclosed the fact that contracts, which were considered by experts to be of an extremely advantageous character, were to be entered into with the Mexican Eagle Company, and that such company was directed by Lord Cowdray, and Lord Murray, of Eiibank, was also connected with it. It may be well to point out that it is not the demand for crude oil itself that controls its price, but the demand for some of its constituents, and so long as there is a practical monopoly for the supply of petrol, so long will the supply and price of crude oil be an unstable factor ; but as soon as healthy competition, both as to supply of crude oil and the refining of it, are brought into being, the conditions which have obtained in the oil market of recent years will materially change. This is really the gist of the Admiralty policy, and it is one in which the shipping community, interested in oil, might consider to their material advantage. Surely it is not beyond the bounds of possibility for shipowners to combine and purchase crude oil for the purpose of refining it, and coming into the market as a competitor of substantial weight. Unless this is done it seems to us that oil is placed at a great disadvantage as compared with coal, and that the latter has little or nothing to fear in the near future, from any calorific advantages that oil may have over coal, until a real open market has been set up in oil, and the open mockery of to-day has been done away with. This branch of the subject absorbed so much of the First Lord's speech, that the large question of general naval policy received small attention. CONTRABAND OF WAR. WE have in the past taken considerable interest in the, at present, unratified Declaration of London, and we think it desirable to call at- tention to a case which affords clear evidence that either considerable ambiguity exists in the phraseology of its sections, or that the decision of the Greek Government has been wrongly based on the principles underlying the provisions of the Declaration. It would appear that last December the Greek naval vessel G. Avevof seized the British steamship Trevarrack while the latter was on a voyage to Kustendje, Roumania, with a cargo of coal and coke, such port at the time, being one of a neutral country. It is clear that to reach such post the vessel had to traverse the waters of one of the belligerents, viz. : Turkey, and ran the risk of having the cargo seized by Turkey and used for the purposes of war. The claim to seize could have been strongly emphasized if the cargo was recognised as contraband and was in- tended for one of the belligerents. It is not clear that coal was really contraband in this instance, as al- though it might be if being sent to a belligerent for war purposes, on the other hand it may not be so, as the coal might be sent to a person in a non-belligerent country for peace purposes. As a matter of fact the Greek Minister of Marine while deciding that coal was absolute contraband from their standpoint, admitted that neutral states were not so bound and he had to rely on Articles 30 and 31 of the Declaration of London to support their contention. It is some- what remarkable that these particular articles are relied upon in this case to the exclusion of four other Articles, viz. : 33 to 36, which specifically deal with the question of what is conditional contraband and sets out in unmistakable language that goods which are conditional contraband are liable to be captured if for the actual use of the forces, or of a Government De- partment belonging to a belligerent. It is interesting to note that the Gre^k Prize Court in dealing with the matter refused to adopt the contention of the Greek Government, that they were justified in cap- turing cargo if the vessel is destined to call at an enemy's port before reaching the neutral port to which the cargo is consigned ; in other words Articles 30 and 31 apply to cargo which they considered to be absolute contraband. The court refused to condemn the cargo as contraband, but decided the seizure was legal, subject to the payment of its value. It seems to us that the Greek Government have misread the Articles altogether and if this is so, it only points out very forcibly how dangerous is the position under the THE MARINE ENGINEER AND NAVAL ARCHITECT. August, 1913 Declaration of London, particularly as it has not yet been ratified. The further development of this matter will be distinctly interesting as the decision of the Prize Court does not seem to meet with the acquiescence of the Greek Government and an appeal has been lodged at the Appeal Court at Athens. This case is one which gives point to the criticism passed at the time when the question was being debated in the House of Commons, and emphasizes the urgent ne- cessity there is for putting the matter on a much more stable basis than it is at present. One can on- ly hope that the nations interested will one and all feel that it is to the interest of everyone to put the matter upon an absolute basis agreeable to all and then get the Declaration ratified. SIGHT TESTS. THE question of sight tests for colour blindness has been raised again in the House of Commons on the ground as to whether the wool tests were the only tests used, and if so, and in view of the fact that such tests had been shown to be defective, it was not advisable to add someone with knowledge and experience of the lantern test, to the body advising the Board of Trade. From the answer given by the President of the Board of Trade it appears that the lantern test has recently been added, in addition to which various spectroscopic tests and tests with Nagel's anomaloscope are now made. This really looks as if some progress is being made owing to the pressure brought to bear on the matter by the shipping community. The President was induced to state that if the proposals of the Royal Society Committee, which is dealing with the matter, are considered to be excessive the Board of Trade would reduce them. It will be recognised by all right-thinking people that what is wanted is a really sensible and practical test or set of tests to decide the matter at the initial stages and thus save time, trouble and anxiety. THE GLASGOW TECHNICAL COLLEGE. THIS College, the only school of Navigition in the Kingdom to possess a steam training-vessel, has had the misfortune to lose its little craft after a very brief experience of her advantages. Some little time ago the present First Lord of the Admiralty determined to effect a minor economy by disposing of certain yachts which were kept up for the purpose of conveying admirals round the Home Stations, and amongst others the Vivid was sold out of the fleet. She was an iron screw yacht of about 550 tons dis- placement, rigged as a barquantine, so that she afforded opportunity for instruction in the management of sails. Her new owners only acquired her in April last, and at the beginning of July she struck a rock near Colonsay and sank, fortunately without loss of life. Her crew and the cadets — of whom there were about fifteen on board — were landed at Oban. The Vivid was, before she went into the service of the Admiralty, a private yacht under another name, and for some years was the property of the first Lord Inverciyde. THE FLEETS OF THE MAIL LINES. {From our Own Correspondent.) The Allan Line has recently been able to dispose of two of its single-screw steamships. These are first the Hungarian, built in 1902 at Glasgow by Messrs. Napier & Miller. She is a vessel of 4,508 tons gross register, fitted with a set of triple-expansion engines by Messrs. Dunsmuir & Jackson. The other is the Onlarian, a couple of hundred tons smaller. She was built at Port Glasgow by Messrs. Robert Duncan & Co. in the year 1900. The last-named vessel is, it is understood, purchased by the Chargeurs RSunis of Havre. The Isle of Man Steam Packet Company have obtained delivery of their new steamship, the King Orry, from the builders, Messrs. Cammell, Laird & Co., of Birken- head. This vessel bears a name which has been held by successive steamships of the fleet during the best part of the long existence of the Company. But, of course, she is a vast improvement even on the last holder of the title. She left Liverpool for Douglas on her maiden trip on the 8th July and accomplished the voyage in three hours loj minutes from the Rock, maintaining a speed of 21 J knots, which, for the purposes for which her owners intend her, is exceedingly liigh. She is not designed for the summer traffic from the Mersey, but will be employed during the season on the Fleet- wood run. It is interesting to note that at the last annual general meeting of the Company the shareholders were requested by the Board to select the name for this ship, and there seems to have been a singular degree of unanimity in favour of calling her King Orry, a name which has not only achieved a reputation in the fleet, but which also excites patriotic fervour in the breast of Manxmen, as it commemo- rates a semi-mythical hero, who formerly, it is said, ruled over the little island in the Irish Sea. Those who go down to the sea in ships in the capacity of seamen and engineers, will be interested in the important judgment which has just been pronounced by the Court of Appeal in the case of Buls !'. the owners of the steamship Teutonic. The claimant in this case was a fireman who met with an accident in the course of his work at sea. The results seemed at first trivial and the man did not give up his duties during the voyage. On arrival at the port of discharge he was paid off in the ordinary course and signed the usual release to the owners on payment of the wages due to him. Then the injury he had received seemed to be more serious, and eventually a claim under the provisions of the Workmen's Compensation Act was formulated in respect of the accident which had befallen him. The facts do not seem to have been in real dispute. But the claim was contested t^ecause, it was urged, the right to make such a claim was barred to the man because he had signed the statutory release before the superintendent on paying off. The County Court judge before whom the claim was first heard found in favour of the claimant, and on appeal the Court of Appeal have reaffirmed his decision. Lord Justice Kennedy, who delivered the judgment of the Court, explaining that the release in question only referred to the particular contract of service of the seaman with regard to which the superin- tendent was, under the Merchant Shipping Act, the person to give the discharge. It would be premature to consider a seaman's rights to compensation at the time when he was being paid off. This decision is obviously important, as, had it been otherwise, a great part of the benefits conferred by the Compensation .\\cts might have in many cases been denied to the sailor. The Turbine Principle seems to have commended itself warmly to the management of the Belgian State Railway. The Villc de Liege, the second of the pair of sisters now under'construction for the Dovcr- Ostend service, was launched in the beginning of July from the yard of the Cockerill Company at Hoboken, near Ant- werp. On that occasion the Minister, who is charged with the management of the railway and steamship system, announced the intention to construct five more such vessels for the service. As the Ville de Lies^e is the fifth of the type to be laimched, and as for many years the whole work of communication was maintained by a fleet of paddlers which did not exceed nine August, 1913. THE MARINE ENGINEER AND NAVAL ARCHITECT. in number, we may look forward to a not far distant time when even the Belgian State Railway — one of the most faithful adherents to the paddle system — will cease to possess a single specimen of the obsolete type of steamship. The Ville de Liege is to be a 24-knot ship and will have all the latest improvements for safety, including, of course, a wireless installation and a system of Stone-Lloyd doors in her bulk- heads. The Richelieu and Ontario Steam Navigation Company, which lirought nito its ownership a considerable number of Canadian river and lake Companies last year, is now absorbing further concerns and is changing its name to the Canadian Lakes and Ocean Transportation Company. The most important of the new constituents is undoubtedly the Quebec Steamship Company, which runs a purely local line between Montreal and Pictou on the one hand, but which also maintains an important ocean service between New York, Bermuda and the West India Islands with fairly large vessels. By this means the combine will not only obtain practical control of the trade of the St. Lawrence system and of the Canadian Great Lakes services, but will also put itself in touch with the other British possessions in the Western Hemispliere. Wireless Telephony for the use of sea-going ships, seems to liave come into the range of practice, for it is announced that two Japanese shipping companies, the Toyo Kisen Kaisha and the Osaka Shosen Kaisha have resolved to fit some at least of their ships with wireless telephonic apparatus. The system they propose to employ is one invented by a Japanese, Mr. Torigata, of Tokio, and it is said that the range to which messages can be heard already extends to a distance of not less than 700 miles. The Loss of the \" Titanic.\" The four cases brought against the Oceanic Steam Naviga- tion Company by relatives of steerage passengers lost in the Titanic have all been decided by the Court of the King's Bench Division against the owners, and damages have been awarded to the claimant in each case for an agreed sum of ;^ioo and general costs. The plaintiffs alleged that the death of their relatives was brought about by the negligence of the servants of the shipowner. The principal grounds on which negligence was charged were two-fold. It was said that there was a bad look-out and that 1he speed of the vessel was exce.ssive in view of the proximity of ice and of the prevailing atmospheric conditions. In relation to the first ground of alleged negligence the question of the delivery of the ice warnings from the various liners in the neighbourhood came up, and in that connection the Court was of opinion that, though the wireless operators on the Titanic undoubtedly had the important message sent off by the Atlantic Transport Company's Mesaba, there was no evidence that that warning ever reached the bridge. The charge of bad look-out was held not to be made out. But the Court was of opinion that several warnings were received from various ships and com- municated to the navigating officers, and that in view of those warnings there was negligence in proceeding at the speed which the ship maintained. But though the plaintiffs had thus succeeded in proving negligence they were met by another defence to the effect that there were certain condi- tions printed on the back of the contract ticket which absolved the shipowner from any responsibility for the negligence of his servants. The evidence adduced at the trial, however, satisfied the Court that, in the case of three of the drowned men, the existence of these conditions was not sufficiently brought to the notice of the passenger and so could not be held to bind him or those who claimed through him. In the fourth case it was held that the passenger was duly notified of the endorsement, for his ticket was purchased from a lady at Skibbereen who made it a practice to satisfy herself that every purchaser of such tickets knew and understood the conditions. In this case then a third point arose. Were the conditions which claimed to exempt the shipowner from liability effective ? The Merchant Shipping Act speaks of the conditions appearing on \" the face of the ticket,\" and says that the contract is to be in a form appr.oved by the Board of Trade. Mr. Justice Bailhache, who tried the case, was of opinion that anything printed on the ticket was, for this purpose, printed on the face, even if tlie imtting of the words \"see back\" on the front did not of itself incorporate the endorsement with the matter on the front. But beyond all this he was of opinion that the words \" the form of the ticket \" meant everything that appeared upon it. It was clear that the conditions on which the defendants relied had never been submitted to the Board of Trade and so could not be said to have the department's approval, and for these reasons he held that the exceptions claimed by the owners were not effective. So in all four cases judgment was entered for the plaintiffs. It is said that the Oceanic Steamship Navigation Company will appeal, and indeed the questions raised by these cases are of the highest importance to them — for there are understood to be other claims open. Moreover, shipowners generally will be anxious to know whether they can or can not divest themselves of liability to emigrant passengers for the negligence of their officers and crew. Around the World. A certain interest has attached to the record in the rapid circumnavigation of the globe, especially in view of Jules Verne's famous book \" Around the World in Eighty Days,\" in which, it may be remembered, the hero, in order to fulfil his undertaking, had recourse to all sorts of desperate ex- pedients, including the hiring of special trains and steamships, to make his missed connections. Nowadays several things militate against the maintenance of great interest in such journeys. To begin with they have ceased to be so largely sea voyages and have become to a great extent train journeys. The railway connections are so arranged that catching a certain train means a clear run from, say, the Western Russian frontier to the shores of the Pacific. Thus the voyager must cither catch the train at which he has originally aimed or he must wait for the next — the hiring of a special over so many hundreds of miles being a prohibitive matter on account of the enormous cost. So too when it comes to the sea transit. To accomplish a record, now that the round has been done well under forty days by more than one adventurer, the fastest steamship on each particular station must be used, and such vessels must be caught for their scheduled trips, as they cannot be found unemployed and chartered for a special voyage, even by a Vanderbilt or a Rothschild. Yet at the present time the \"New York Evening Sun \" has thought it worth while to send one of its staff, Mr. John Henry Mears, to attempt to reduce the time to thirty-five days. To fulfil this mis.sion Mr. Mears left New York by the Mauretania on the 2nd July, 1913, hoping to be back tliere by the 6th .August. He reached Fishguard in due course and was announced as being about to proceed to London by aeroplane. This intention, however, did not materialize, and the traveller proceeded by the possibly slower, but undoubtedly surer, special train of the Great Western Railway. Thence he proceeded to Paris and Berlin and at the time of writing is no doubt killing time on the weary train journey across Siberia. Emden as a Commercial Port is now attaining some little importance. The Hamburg- American Company has already made it the headquarters of at least one of its numerous services. Now the Nord- deutscher Lloyd, under the agreement made with the Prussian Government at the end of 1912, announces that its new service from Emden to Australian ports will be inaugurated on the 2nd October. With a view of developing the trade of the port both these important steamship Companies are opening offices in the town. The Japanese JVlercantile Marine. Most people who are concerned with shipping matters have observed how largely the Japanese have of late been pur- chasing foreign-built steamships to meet the increase of their trade. The Japanese Cust(mis Tariff, no doulit for the double reason of obtaining revenue and of encouraging native shipbuilding, exacts a considerable import duty on foreign vessels placed on their register. But some brilliant shipowner had discovered that the tax might be avoided by registering his purchases at Dairen in the Kwantung Territory. No objection to this procedure seems to have been taken at first. But now the practice has become so general that legislation is being undertaken to render a continuation of the present state of things impossible. As the duty involved amounts to from 20s. to 30s. a ton, according to the age of the vessel, the matter would seem to be one of considerable im- portance, for cargo vessels of up to, say, 4,5\"° tons have recently been purchased for registration at Dairen. Shipowners must assuredly be hard pressed for ideas as to possible THE MARINE ENGINEER AND NAVAL ARCHITECT. August, 1913. novelties for introduction into new steamships. The Rotter- dam Lloyd, howfver, seems to have thought of a useful inno- vation for the benefit of the passengers by their steamship Rotterdam. In this vessel they have installed a safe deposit system, by placing a considerable number of safes of various sizes in the purser's cabin. Passengers arc thus enabled to relieve themselves of all anxiety as to the safety of their valuables from light-fingered gentry during the voyage, as the safes can only be opened by the joint consent of the passengers renting them and the officer of the ship, owing to the fact that two keys are required to unlock them. With the increase in size and in the consequent numbers of pas- sengers and crew, the chances of black sheep being shipped are largely increased, whilst the hope of detecting a successful thief is proportionately diminished. It is probable that the system found so successful in the Rotterdam will be extended not only in this, but in other companies. Armed Merchantmen. The latest vessel to be fitted with guns by the .\\dmiralty, the White Star Co.'s Ceramic is also the first merchant ship to have a real gun trial. Owing to the peculiar condi- tions of the ownership of White Star vessels — the shares in the Oceanic Steam Navigation Company being held by an American Corporation — there have been questions in the House of Commons as to the expediency of arming these steamers, and as to the probable action of their owners if this country should unhappily be involved in war. Mr. Churchill returned what seemed a satisfactory answer to these questions, and the Admiralty seems further to have fully considered and satisfied itself that the objections of Mr. Molteno are of no importance. That gentleman was against the principle of fitting merchant ships, or at least passenger ships, with guns at all, as he feared that their presence would constitute a danger to those on board from hostile warships with any countervailing advantage. An oil exhibition of an International character is to be held at Earl's Court, London during the months of March and April next year. The opening day, as at present fixed, is March 2ist. Obituary. — Mr. Archibald Hamilton. — The death oc- curred with painful suddenness on Julv 24th, while visiting at a friends' house, of Mr. Archibald Hamilton, C.E., chief a.ssistant to Mr. W. M Alston, M.LC.E., engineer to the Clyde Navigation Trust. Mr. Hamilton who was 62 years of age, wa.s a native of Motherwell. He was well-known in shipping and shipbuilding circles and his sudden demise caused very general regret. Mr. Basil Wilson, a former director in Messrs. Harland and Wolff, Ltd., died on Julv 9th at the age of 67 years. He was apprenticed to Messrs. McNab of Greenock, and after- wards entered the firm of Messrs. Harland & Wolff. Mr. Wilson was a member of The Institution of Civil Engineers, and had of late years a very extensive practice as a consult- ing engineer. Lloyd's Regi.ster. — The Returns compiled by Lloyd's Register of Shipping, which only take into account vessels the construction of which has actually begun, show that, excluding warships, there were 54.1 vessels of 2,003,241 grass under construction in the LInited Kingdom at the close of the quarter ended 30th June, 1913. The tonnage now under construction is 60,000 tons less than that which was in hand at the end of last quarter, but exceeds by about 229,000 tons the tonnage building in June, IQ12. Of the ve.ssels under construction in the United Kingdom at the end of June, 434 of 1,538,198 tons are under the inspection of the surveyors of Lloyd's Register with a view to cla.ssification by this Society. In addition, 125 vessels of 559,669 tons arc building abroad under the Society's survey, there are thus now actually building under the supervision of Lloyd's Regi.ster 559 vessels of 2,097,867 tons. This total is within 14,000 tons of the figures reported in the March return which were the largest ever reached. As to Foreign and Colonial Shipbuilding, the latest returns show that, excluding warships, there were under construction at various ports abroad, 429 ves.sels of 1,443,317 gross tonnage, 377 vessels of 1,421,368 tons being steam and 52 of 21,949 tons sail. Vessels of less than 100 tons are not included. NAVAL MATTERS— PAST AND PROSPECTIVE. (From our Own Correspondents.) Portsmouth Dockyard. THE event of the month has, of course, been the King's visit to the new Australian flagship, the big battle- cruiser Australia, on the deck of which vessel his Majesty knighted .\\dmiral Patey, who will command the Royal Australian Fleet. King George on this visit repeated the incidents of the similar occasion when he came down to see the New Zealand, and again exhibited the interest which he is known to take in the principal naval port. Coming after the recent visit of the French Fleet, and followed as it was by a visit from the High Commissioner of Australia and then the mobilisation for manoeuvres, Portsmouth is now by way of contrast having a very quiet time. The operation of putting the balance crews on board and getting the ships for the Second and Third Fleets away from harbour was accom- plished most smoothly and expeditiously. The following vessels, after being completed to full complement, left on the 15th and i6th July for their respective rendezvous with the Red and Blue forces : — Battleships Bulwark, Prince of Wales, Irresistible, Venerable, Albemarle, Glory and Duncan ; cruisers Royal Arthur, Spartiate, Europa, Diadem, Ariadne, Drake, Good Hope, King Alfred, Liverpool a.nL\\ Topaze ; and the scouts Skirmisher and Sentinel, with a number of des- troyers. Though several thousands of men were drafted to the ships, there was no hitch in the arrangements, and both in the depots and barracks there are still a number of hands available, showing the result of the recent endeavours to add to the personnel of the Navy. After the Trades and Labour Council had expressed itself in favour of the new compensation scheme, there was little doubt as to the result of the ballot. Out of the five items put forward for readjustment, four were conceded, and with regard to the fifth, the right to appeal, it was hardly expected that the Treasury would admit any other arbiter but themselves. In face of such a reasonable attitude, it is not surprising that the men expressed them- selves fairly satisfied, and when the ballot papers were counted on Saturday, 12th July, after being filled in on the previous day, it was found that a majority of over 12,000 were in favour of accepting the scheme. It is not unlikely that the voting at Portsmouth will have considerable influence at the other yards when their turns come to record a decision. After a period of great activity, tilings have quieted down towards the end of the month. There is still some talk of the launch of the Queen Elizabeth taking place earlier than has been usual for dockyard-built ships in order that another ves.sel may be laid down in the third quarter of the year, and October 16th has been fi.xed as the provisional date. Several vessels have arrived, the Isis for a long refit, the .Melpomene to pay off. and others. The Sydney left on the 17th and the Australia on the 2 1st July, both for Bantry to calibrate before taking their departure for .Australia via the Cape. While here the two vessels attracted much interest, and quite a number of people visited them. Davenport Dockyard. The mobilization on the 15th July, passed off quietly and without any trouble. The number of vessels affected was com- paratively small to the numbers at the other yards, and only one ship of the Third Fleet was commissioned, the cruiser Talbot. The thousands of men required all knew their places and what was wanted of them, and their behaviour whether of the regular service, the Coastguard, or Reserves, was highly creditable. A larger number than usual were sent off to other ports by train to join their ships. There are still many ratings in the barracks, and if more of the ships of the Third Fleet were wanted in an emergency there would be no difficulty in finding the special ratings for them. The vessels which left the harbour during the two days were the battleships Exmouth and Conqueror, the battle-cruiser Indefatigable, the cruisers Carnarvon, Lancaster, Defence, Warrior, Cornwall, Cumberland, Devonshire, Talbot and Sapphire, the scouts .Ulvciiture and .Ittentive, the minelayer .Ipollo, and a des- troyer flotilla. It has been exjiected for some tinn', and in- deed ever since it became known that the Engineering School would be used for officers, that another establishment would August. 1913. THE MARINE ENGINEER AND NAVAL ARCHITECT be prepared here for training boys. It is now officially an- nounced that the College will be required for the use of officers specialising in engineering, and that the new training estab- lishment for boys will be afloat. It will consist of the An- dromeda, which is to be renamed the Powerful II., and the Powerful herself. Both these vessels have been in hand for some time fitting out, and are to be ready by September. They will be joined together by a bridge, and placed at the moorings occupied for many years by the old gunnery ship Cambridge. The boys will use the field at Trevol, which was appropriated for field gun drill and other exercises, as their recreation ground. The College will be reopened about the end of the year, and the alterations which are needed to fit it for the purpose of the officers specialising in engineering will be completed in about eight weeks. There does not appear to be any chance of the dockyard workmen making common cause, and the movement for combined action has died down. A larger feeling of satisfaction appears to prevail, and this has had a good deal to do with the gradual disappearance of agitation since the strike ceased. There are now no restrictions about working overtime, and it is probable that the various classes will deal separately with those matters which still give cause for dissatisfaction. It is again rumoured that when the Warspite is launched, probably in November, we shall have a Royal visit, but nothing definite is known on this point. The Carol, oil-carrying vessel, was put afloat quietly on 5th July, Mrs. Stokes, the wife of the Admiral Superintendent, performing the ceremony. The Carol was laid down in November last, and is a steam driven vessel, but her sister ship, the Ferol, which is to be built on the same slip, will have internal combustion engines. This arrangement, since it is understood that in every other respect the two ships will be alike, should enable some interesting comparisons to be made, and some important data to be obtained from their respective trials. It is expected that the Pomone, sloop, will be refitted here to take the place at Dartmouth of the old Britannia, which is to be sold. Chatham Dockyard. Owing to the vastly improved organisation in connection with the vessels in reserve there is not now that strain upon the yard when preparations are made for manoeuvres that there used to be. The fact is that the ships in the Third Fleet are much more systematically looked after and they are not permitted to fall into an inefficient state, while the ships of the Second Fleet are practically, as they are nominally, commissioned ships. Then again the regulations about repairs since Lord Fisher's time have tended to keep these well under, so that as there is no accumulation of defects to make good, the vessels are ready with very little work. They may require an overhaul, but this is quickly completed. Of course, a large number of ships cannot be placed in full com- mission without some bustle, but owing to the nucleus crew system, and to the improved organisation in other directions, both the preparation of the ships for manoeuvres, and their mobilisation, is accomplished with smoothness and celerity. .Although in the eastern port we are less affected in some ways than the other establishments, our output is as large as any, and it is highly satisfactory to know that the way in which the ships were completed with stores, manned, and sent away has received the highest approval. There was every reason to suppose that the new compensation scheme would prove generally acceptable, as soon as it was clear that the authorities were willing to regard the men's suggestions in a sympathetic spirit. Mfien the only alternative offered was to come under the provisions of the Workmen's Compensation Act, the advantages offered by the scheme appealed strongly and made themselves felt. As soon as the Trades Council sup- ported the scheme, it was certain that a ballot would show, as at Port^smouth, a majority in favour of acceptance ; the actual figures were 10,836 for acceptance, 335 against. There remains for consideration, the revision of the scale of deduc- tions towards superannuation allowances, when it i hoped that some reduction will be made in the case of the less highly paid classes. The men on the establishment asked some time since that their allowances should be calculated pro rata on their full wages instead of on the wages less the deductions, but it seems unlikely that the concession will go as far as this. Directions have been given that all candidates selected for the mechanician class who have less than five years to com- plete their first continuous service engagement, will be re- quired to re-engage on joining the Mechanical Training Establishment for the course. The Champion, the instruc- tional ship for the second-class stokers, is undergoing refit, and in the meantime the Brilliant has been appropriated for this duty. The refit of the Leviathan and several smaller vessels has absorbed the men which were getting ships ready for the manoeuvres, and it is generally felt that Chatham will have all its people employed in earning the money voted for the year. Sheerness Dockyard. Naturally the circumstance that the Nore is the principal base of the \" Red \" Fleet for the manoeuvres has made the harbour unusually full of ships this month. There have been more flags flying here this month than we have seen for a twelvemonth, and the hoisting of the Union flag of Admiral of the Fleet, Sir William May, as chief umpire was quite an event. The movements of ships have made the Dockyard quite lively, although the bigger vessels seldom want anything except coal. Some little excitement was caused here when the new boom defence was tested, and much rejoicing took place when it was found to answer all expectations. The operation of putting the component parts in position began on 2nd July, and before mid-day on the following morning everything was completed. The boom is stretched from the Isle of Grain on one side of the river to a little island on which is a martello tower and then in deeper water to Garrison Point, with one section as a gate, which was only closed to traffic for a short time. The whole affair was placed in position most quickly and without much trouble, while it was taken to pieces again and stowed away for future use quite as expeditiously. It must be four or five years since a similar trial of placing this obstruction in the river was made. With the arrival of the Strenuous and the Sturdv the two new tugs which have been built by Messrs. Thornycroft, this yard will be well equiped in this direction. These vessels are of nearly seven hundred tons displacement and do not draw more than twelve feet of water, while the engines of 1,250 H.P. will drive them at something like twelve knots. But speed is not so much a desiderata in these craft as power and staunch- ness and in this respect nothing was lacking. There are now four fine paddle tugs here, the two above named, and the Robust and the Diligent of about the same size and power. The Leda paid off on the 14th July for an extensive refit, and her place in the North Sea fishery flotilla will be temporarily taken by the destroyer Wear, which was commissioned for the purpose on the 17th July. The Hebe, Bother, and Ure, destroyers, have also arrived for refit. Pembroke Dockyard. The arrival in the Haven of a Squadron of training ships from Queenstown to fill up their crews, and the advent from other ports of the men, is about the only matter concerning the manoeuvres which at the time of writing has affected this place. Of much greater interest to the yardmen is the ques- tion, at present unanswered^ of the date when replies to their petitions will be received and what shape these will take. Another matter which has been widely discussed here concerns the cause of the explosion in submarine E$. An official enquiry took place, but the result has not been pub- lished, and although it was proved at the inquest that the mishap was purely accidental, the finding threw little further light on the matter. The general opinion among experts seems to be that the explosion was caused by incomplete combustion in the cylinders leading to leakage into the crank pit. It is good news that the first of our two light cruisers is to be begun this month, as this vessel and the oil-carrier Turinoil will take the place of the Fearless and the Notting- ham, both of which vessels are to be completed before the end of the calendar year. The Fearless ought to leave before the end of the month to begin her steam trials on the Clyde, while the boilers for the Nottingham have already been put in place and delivery of her turbines is expected almost im- mediately. The destroyer Thorn is to come here after the manoeuvres for refit and' retubing. In the meanwhile a good deal of overt-me has been worked in order to expedite some of the business in hand, particularly that of the construction of targets for the I'leet. We are still short-handed and the demand lor additional shipwrights has become chronic. Yet to find work for the smiths the steel davits of one of the Portsmouth ships are being made here. The first keel plate of the new cruiser was laid dowu on July 21st. THE MARINE ENGINEER AND NAVAL ARCHITECT. August, 1913. SEAMEN'S NATIONAL INSURANCE SOCIETY. A PAMPHLET has just been issued by the Seamens' National Insurance Society setting forth the scale of payments and the benefits which accrue to those who join the society, which is managed by a committee of twenty-one, composed of seven representatives each from the Board of Trade, from the shipowners and from the insured members. The treasurer of the fund is the Accountant General of the Board of Trade. The master and every member of the crew of every ship in the sea service and in the sea-fishing service, registered in the United Kingdom, and of every British ship registered elsewhere, but whose owner resides or has his principal place of business in the United Kingdom, is entitled to become a member of the society unless : — A. His rate of remuneration exceeds /i6o a year and he is not employed by way of manual labour. B. He is a foreigner or lascar not domiciled nor having a place of residence in the United Kingdom. A foreigner or lascar domiciled or having a place of residence in the United Kingdom is entitled to become a member. The contributions arc 4d. per week, to be paid by the member, and 3d. per week by the employer for those engaged in all trades other than the foreign trade, in which the con- tributions are 4d. per week by members and 2d. by employers. The benefits are 10/- per week for twenty-six weeks, for sickness, and 5/- per week for disablement from termination of sickness till old-age pension commences. A foreigner or la.scar not domiciled nor having a place of residence in the United Kingdom cannot become a member, and he neither pays contributions nor receives benefits ; but his employer will have to pay his own contributions for such men, and these contributions will go to the funds of the society. It is estimated that owing to the contributions received due to non-domiciled foreigners and lascars, there will be an accumulation of funds with which it is proposed to estabUsh a pension scheme and other benefits ; but it is only by joining the society that these benefits can be obtained. Institute of Metals. — On August 28th and 29th the Institute of Metals is to hold at Ghent, the first foreign meet- ing. The Palais des Fetes of the E.xhibition has been placed at the disposal of the Institute by the Belgian Government. A number of important scientific papers will be read and dis- cussed. Of these probably the most noteworthy is the second report to the Corrosion Committee by Dr. G. D. Bengough, M.A., and Mr. R. Jones. B.Sc., which has been awaited by engineers and metallurgists for upwards of two years. It is expected that the report will clearly indicate not only the causes of the corrosion of condenser tubes, but how such corrosion may be eliminated. If this is so. there should be a resulting saving to shipowners, engineers and others of many thousands of pounds per annum. ELBE ESTUARY MOTOR LIGHTSHIP. Interesting Application of Diesel Machinery. New Opening for \"Elbe\" Lightship. THE Elbe Estuary Motor Lightship. Burgermcister O'Swald (Elbe 1) has been built by Messrs. Niiscke and Co. from the designs of Mr. H. E. Johns of Hamburg. With a motor -driven vessel not only are the running costs low. but the main engine is ready to start up in a few minutes in cases of emergency, without heavy stand-by charges, such as a steamship would require to keep a good head of steam night and day. With the motor ship the stand- by and running fuel charges are practically nil in tlie day- time, in ordinary weather, unless cruising, also sutficient fuel for a long period can be carried without encroaching on the space necessarv for the comfort of the crew. Biirgermeister O'Swald is equipped with the latest types of radio-telegraphy, submarine signalling apparatus, beacon- light and fog siren. In addition to Diesel-driven dynamos there are accumulators of large capacity kept charged. Her principal dimensions are as follows : — Length overall 173 feet. Length between P.P.S 147* „ Beam moulded 25J ,, Depth moulded I7i ,, Draught 124 „ Height of beacon above W.L 52 Displacement 720 tons. PropelUng motor 220 B.H.P. Speed 9 knots. There are four Diesel engines, one of 220 h.p., two of 35 h.p., and one of 6 h.p., all of which were built by Sulzer Bros., of Winterthur. The main engine is of the two-stroke type, but the auxiliary motors work on the four-stroke principle. Dealing first with the main engine this is of the single-acting direct reversible class and develops its rated power at 280 r.p.m. -Although of the enclosed type it practicalh- becomes Elbe Motor Lightship, le Burgtimcistcr O'Swald.

The cylinders, of wliich there are four, have their covers directly connected to the bed-plate (D) by means of the steel columns (C), thus the pressures are taken up directly by the bed-plate and main bearings, allowing the cylinders to be free to expand in the direction of their axis. These columns are connected by diagonal ties and the cylinder covers are bolted together, giving a rigid de.-.ign. In con- nection with the scavenging and exhaust arrangements, Sulzer Bros., have sensibly adopted the port system leaving only the fuel and starting valves in the cylinder heads. The scavenging air enters the combustion chambers through ports in the cylinder walls, a certain number of the ports being in direct communication with an air chamber, the admission of atmospheric air into which is controlled by valves. The fuel valves are arranged in the centres of the cylinders, while the air-starting valves are located on the sides. The scavenging pump (E) consists of a double-acting piston- pump controlled by a rotating piston-valve in the casing (F), and the crosshead of this pump is arranged as a first-stage air-compressor, the second and third stages of which are driven by means of balance-levers from the crosshead of the scavenging pump on the port side of the engine. This patented arrangement has proved itself advantageous for high speeds, the various pressures being so evenly distributed that the inertia is. nearly completely absorbed, thus giving a smooth drive. In the case of the scavenging pump, water cooling is not necessary, but the three compressor stages, however, are each separately water-jacketed and provided with 'tween coolers. The valve cams are mounted on the horizontal shaft (G), which is driven from the crankshaft through a vertical shaft by helical gearing. The main fuel pumps (J) are also driven from the shaft (G) and are mounted on the compressor jackets at the starboard side of the for- ward end of the engine. The reversing and manoeuvring control, by means of which the cams are operated for ahead and astern running, is at (K), reversing being attained by revolving the shaft (G) through an angle relative to the crankshaft. Besides this reversing device there is a hand lever arrangement at (L) for throwing the fuel and starting-air respectively in and out of action, the same as is provided in Sulzer stationary practice. This is effected by revolving the lay-shaft (M) on which the rockers for the fuel and starting-air valves are eccentrically mounted. A governor is mounted near the forward end on the shaft (G), which on the slightest increase of revolutions above the normal operates direct on the fuel pump. All cylinders are provided with forced lubrication supplied by the piston-type pump (N), which is driven by an eccentric on the shaft (G), the oil being supplied from the small reser- voir (O) througii sight-feed controls. Forced lubrication is also provided for all bearings and gudgeon-pins by a gear- pump placed on the forward end of the engines, the oil passing through a cooler and a filter before reaching the pump. Sea water is used throughout for cooling purposes, the cooling pumps being driven by the main engine. The gear pump mounted on the forward end of the engine is used for cooling the pistons, and the other, a plunger pump seen on the star- board side of the air pump, is for the cooling of the working and compressor cylinders. The latter pump is combined with the bilge pump and both are driven by balance levers from the air pump crosshead. For cooling the pistons the water is led through telescopic pipe-;, without stuffing-boxes, the water entering the piston in the form of a free jet. We now come to the au.xiliary machinery. The driving engines are of the three-cylinder, four-stroke, non-reversible single-acting type, each giving 35 b.h.p. at 450 r.p.m. With each engine its two-stage compressor is driven direct from the crankshaft while the engine frames are of bo.\\-form in two pieces, strengthened internally by columns, and liave easily dismountable steel plate doors on each side. The starting, fuel-injection and exhaust valves arc placed on the top of the cylinder heads. An adjustable governor is fitted, which regulates the lift of the suction valves of the fuel i)ump, thus varying the quantity of oil injected. Below the fuel pump may be seen a semi-rotary pump which supplies cooling water for the working cylinders and air compressors. Both these auxiliary motors are direct coupled to con- tinuous current Siemens-Schuckert dynamos. There is also a belt pulley mounted on the crankshaft of each from which is August, 1913.

From the other end of tliis countershaft two low-pressure compressors arc driven ; these compressors are placed for- ward of and on the same axis as the auxiliary motors and supply air for the fog siren at a pressure of 2 V atm. The direct-driven compressors of the auxiliary motors provide air at a pressure of 220 lbs. for the purpose of driving the windlass, a duplex general service donkey engine, and the ship's whistle. The various compressed air storage flasks, namely, for starting, fuel-injection, pumping and signalling purpo.ses, are arranged in the port and starboard wings of the engine-room, above the auxiliary sets. The auxiliary compressor is built V-shaped, the driving the Elbe Motor Lightship. cylinder and compressor being set at 90 degrees to each other. There is one single-cylinder Diesel engine of 6 b.h.p. at 600 r.p.m., and the compressor is of the two-stage type. It supplies air for starting and fuel injection purposes, and to work the general service donkey, and has also a small bilge pump directly coupled. Its principal use, however, is as a stand-by in the event of the total failure of the air supply, and although constructed to start on low-pressure air it is large enough to generate sufficient air to start the main 200 h.p. engine in a very short time. The duplex general service donkey pump is of 15 gals, per minute capacity and, as already mentioned, is connected so as to pump the oil and ballast tanks and bilges, and deck washing and for fire service. M B Main Engine of the Burgermeister O'Swald (Elbe Lightship); 10 THE MARINE ENGINEER AND NAVAL ARCHITECT. August, 1913. The Story of the Anchor Line. THE Anchor Line is perhaps the Ocean steam- ship Company which is most closely associated with the City of Glasgow and with the ship- building industry of the Clyde. It differs from the three Companies whose history we have already noted in the fact that it grew out of other interests and did not originate as a steamship-owning business. There was in Glasgow a well-known firm of N. & R. Handyside who entered into the business of shipbrokers and merchants in the year 1838 — ^just about the time when the P. & O. Company and the Royal Mail were preparing to launch their steamship adventures under the auspices of their respectix'e Royal Charters. Messrs. Handyside's business was at that time chiefly connected with the Baltic and Russian ports. But they also seem to have had the manage- ment of some small sailing vessels. In the year 1852 they took into partnership a young man, Mr. Thomas Henderson, who had been in command of certain of their vessels during the previous years. They were thus brought into prominent connection with the family which eventually took on their busi- ness and became so closely identified with the shipping trade of the Clyde. There were four brothers in the Henderson family, and, coming to Glasgow from the little village of Pittenweem on the coast of Fifeshire, they all took to the sea in early youth and each in turn rose to command as shipmasters. But with the instinct of the sailor they all turned towards the chance of a shore job. Thomas, as we have seen, found his billet in the office of Messrs. N. & R. Handyside. David, the eldest of the quartette, in conjunction with William the youngest of the family. set up a marine engineering establishment which flourishes to this day under the style of D. & W. Henderson, and the remaining brother John soon joined the Handyside business, first as master and then as partner. It was in "
