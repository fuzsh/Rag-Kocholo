        "meta_description": "This photograph of the family of Tsar Alexander III (1845-94) was taken about a year before his death from nephritis. Also shown in the photo are Empress Maria Fedorovna (1847-1928), Grand Duke Nicholas Alexandrovich (1868-1918), Grand Duke George Alexandrovich (1871-99), Grand Duchess Xenia Alexandrovna (1875-1960), Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna (1882-1918), and Grand Duke Michael Alexandrovich (1878-1918). Empress Maria Fedorovna, also called Princess Dagmar, fled Russia in 1919 with other members of the Romanov family aboard the British battleship HMS Marlborough. She settled and died in her native Denmark. Grand Duke Nicholas Alexandrovich (standing behind the empress to the left) succeeded his father as Tsar Nicholas II and was the last emperor of Russia. He was forced to abdicate in 1917 and was murdered by the Bolsheviks in 1918. Grand Duke George Alexandrovich (next to Nicholas Alexandrovich) died of tuberculosis while serving as a young officer in the Russian navy. Grand Duchess Xenia Alexandrovna, the elder daughter, married a cousin, and she and her husband were among the Romanovs aboard the Marlborough in 1919. She spent most of the rest of her life in Britain. Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna escaped from Russia in 1920 with her second husband, Nikolai Kulikovsky, and their sons. The family lived in Denmark until 1948, and then immigrated to Canada. Grand Duke Michael Alexandrovich served with distinction in World War I. He was murdered by revolutionaries in June 1918. The photograph is preserved in the Russian State Archive of Film and Photo Documents.",
