        "text": "February 5, 2021\n\nI picked this book up knowing I have read parts of it before, only to realize I have actually read the whole thing a few years ago. :D In any case, this is a very, very good and balanced biography of a highly problematic person whom history tends to completely reject as if he did not have any other qualities than his (admittedly undisputable) conservatism and rude manners towards politicians. Just like his son (cathegorized as \"weak\") and his father (celebrated among the Tsars), he was a complex personality thrust into a position he had not wanted in a country that his ancestors (and not only them) have slowly but surely all pushed a little further towards the catastrophy of civil war and Red terror. Meticulously researched, this book only really lacks one crucial thing: an index.\n\nJune 29, 2022\n\nAn amazing biography of a Tsar that can be called enigmatic. A Tsar that history wedged in between two Tsars that have dominated the history books. Alexander III was not expected to rule. His parents, the court and the country placed their entire hopes on his elder brother Nicholas Alexandrovich “Niksa” to make Russia into a shining beacon. A Tsar educated to make Russia into a world leader. Sadly destiny had other plans and took Niksa away giving the opportunity to the second son Alexander Alexandrovich. Destiny gambled with the fate of Russia and Alexander III rose up to the challenge and showed that destiny left Russia in good hands.\n\nAlexander III showed that his rule would be characterized by fair and equitable judgement towards Russia and her people. His motto was always “Russia for Russians” and even though he placed the interests of Russia first against the interests of his other nations he did it to make Russia one rather than many. His main goal had always been for the glory of a United Russia.\n\nAlexander III as a personal man was simple. Preferring the company of friends and family that were honest with him and had little pretensions. He enjoyed his wife and children and select family members that were honest with him and looked towards the benefit of Russia. A man who unlike his predecessor or even his successor was not ruled by passion or indecision, but through the lens of the betterment of Russia.\n\nAlexander III became a footnote in the history of Russia yet his achievements cannot be overlooked. This book is a wonderful addition to the lives of the Tsars. To fully understand the history of Russia it is important to read this book. His biography has been long overdue and this book does not disappoint. To know a man who placed duty over everything else is a rare find.\n\nNote: the book does have a number of grammar and spelling mistakes. Perhaps a proper proofreading would be ideal.\n\nSeptember 25, 2020\n\nThis book presents a balanced view of Alexander III addressing both his good and bad qualities. At the beginning I found the author's approach to be a little detached from her subject, but it got much better the further I got into the book to the point that I could barely put it down. My only quibble with it is there is no index. I found keeping all the different people people in the book hard to remember because so many of them had similar names. There was an appendix that listed all the people in the book, but it was divided into sections based on their function in respect to the Russian Imperial family. The problem was that it was their function that I needed to know, so either an alphabetized listing of all of them or an index would have been better. There are many pictures in the book which made me feel like I was at the location being discussed, so it made it more real. However, I could not figure out how the pictures were arranged until after the first chapter: the pictures that are associated with each chapter are at the end of the chapter. Despite the lack of index, which is why I am giving it four stars instead of five, I very much enjoyed the book."
