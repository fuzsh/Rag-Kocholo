        "text": "POD: 1839. The Russian crown prince, Grand Duke Alexander Nikolaevich, the future Alexander II of Russia, met Queen Victoria, they liked each other and wanted to marry. In OTL it wasn't allowed. Let's say Nicholas I would approve it on the following terms:\n\n1. Alexander retains the right to the Russian throne.\n\n2. Alexander has the right to practice Orthodoxy.\n\n3. Alexander has the freedom of movement between Russia and the UK at any time.\n\nIf it was accepted, how would British politics change? Would the Crimean war be averted? And when Alexander would become the Russian Emperor, would his policies and reforms change? Would he avoid assassination? And after their deaths, could it result in a personal union between the two largest empires?\n\nBonus points for making a scenario where it actually would. In that case, what would WW1 look like (if it would happen at all)? Could the Russo-British Commonwealth survive to this day?\n\nQuite honestly, I think it's impossible.\n\nIf Alexander II and Queen Victoria married, they might (for their lifetimes) reign/rule their own nations separately under the terms of their marriage contract. I think the WI you've mentioned wouldn't get to the engagement stage let alone marriage negotiations but ignoring that for the sake of curiosity and assuming they do marry, (where? how? according to which Rites?), the problems quickly mount up. When does the Tsar live in Russia? When does the Queen live in England? Is her fortune his? Does parliament have to pay the Tsar an annuity? Does Russia have provide Victoria with an appanage? How is he styled in England? How is she styled in Russia?\n\nHis faith is actually a moot point. As long as he's not a Catholic, he doesn't have to be an Anglican. But this leads into what I believe is the one issue that makes this WI totally implausible: their children. The crowns of the United Kingdom and Russia are vested in one and the same person - Alexander and Victoria's eldest son. You have religious, cultural and political differences to overcome not to mention where the Tsarevich/Prince of Wales born to Alexander and Victoria will live, be educated etc. Again, how does he split his time? Where does he live? Is he an autocrat in Russia and a constitutional monarch in the UK? What religion does he follow? Can he even be crowned in the UK if he practises as an Orthodox Christian?\n\nThere is a possibility...a very unlikely one however...that Alexander renounces his succession rights in Russia to wed Victoria leaving his brother Grand Duke Konstantin Nikolaevich to become first in line. But for that, you need to give Alexander a very good reason for turning his back on his homeland and you'd need to amend the Pauline Laws as Russian dynasts were not allowed to forfeit their rights to the throne. They could only do so by contracting a marriage in contravention of the Pauline Laws, which wouldn't apply here. Victoria can abdicate but she too can't renounce. And why would she anyway? To be a consort when she could be regnant in her birth country?\n\nIt's a great WI and good luck to the genius who manages to carry this one off! Personally? I just don't see it.\n\nIf we keep a butterfly net on Victoria's personality, this could happen if she had a elder brother or cousin serving as the british king\n\nHer marrying the russian crown prince(not even Emperor yet) would be far easier that way as her taking the throne would not even be considered since the expectation would be on the brit king producing his own set of male heirs\n\nNot to say it wouldnt cause some scandal, but royal houses intermarrying is hardly new and a russian tsar getting a british wife would be seen as a symbol of prestige for the russians and a way of strenghtning relations for the british\n\nThen after the marriage already happened you could have it so that her brother/cousin died without leaving heirs, making her the Queen regnant by default to the shock of everyone while Alex2 takes the russian throne himself\n\nSo goal achieved I guess?\n\nThe result would probably be the parliament hellbent on curtailing Victoria's powers and trying to revisit the succession laws to make sure their children would not inherit both Empires rather than any badass British-Russian dynastic union as cool that would be\n\nIf we keep a butterfly net on Victoria's personality, this could happen if she had a elder brother or cousin serving as the british king\n\nHer marrying the russian crown prince(not even Emperor yet) would be far easier that way as her taking the throne would not even be considered since the expectation would be on the brit king producing his own set of male heirs\n\nNot to say it wouldnt cause some scandal, but royal houses intermarrying is hardly new and a russian tsar getting a british wife would be seen as a symbol of prestige for the russians and a way of strenghtning relations for the british\n\nThen after the marriage already happened you could have it so that her brother/cousin died without leaving heirs, making her the Queen regnant by default to the shock of everyone while Alex2 takes the russian throne himself\n\nSo goal achieved I guess?\n\nThe result would probably be the parliament hellbent on curtailing Victoria's powers and trying to revisit the succession laws to make sure their children would not inherit both Empires rather than any badass British-Russian dynastic union as cool that would be\n\nThat could be a good one, but the problem with your and Jonathan's suggestions is that the non-heir would probably convert to the heir's religion which disqualifies them from succession (the British law states that the King (or Queen) must be Protestant, and the Russian law then required the ruling Russian Emperor (or Empress) to be Orthodox). Though if that restriction is dealt with when Victoria and Alexander inherit, that could pave the way for the personal union in the future."
