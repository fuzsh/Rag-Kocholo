        "text": "Empress Maria Fyodorovna’s coronation ensemble\n\nThe dress\n\nMaria Fyodorovna’s coronation ensemble is a Russian court dress consisting of a bodice, skirt and train. In imitation of European evening-wear, the bodice has a plunging, boat-shaped neckline that reveals the shoulders as well as the neck. The long false sleeves, which give the costume its Russian character, split where they join the bodice’s armholes and can be folded back; shoulder pleats give the sleeves volume. The bodice has a front-lacing closure, as indicated by the holes along its two open edges (see figure 9.3). Like other Russian court dresses of this era, a panel of fabric, approximately an inch wide and decorated with jewels resembling buttons, would have run down the length of the dress, from the top of the bodice to the hem of the skirt, concealing the bodice’s lacing in the process.\n\nThe curved train fastens at the waist and splits in front to reveal a triangle-shaped area covered with silver-thread embroidery on the skirt underneath. Maria Fyodorovna’s train is 420 centimetres (nearly fourteen feet) in length—Tsar Nicholas I’s 1834 edict regarding court dress dictated that Russian empresses wore trains measuring fifteen feet, the longest of any worn at court.\n\nThe creation of this three-piece ensemble was a team effort and a time-consuming endeavour. The embroiderers at the gold embroidery workshop of A. Laman in St. Petersburg took a year to work on the luxurious material, which is silver brocade (cloth-of-silver) sourced from the Sapozhnikov Brothers Factory in Moscow, fabric supplier to the Russian Imperial court since 1852. Finally, the workshop of Izambard Chanceau, a leading St. Petersburg fashion house dealing exclusively in Russian court attire, made up the ornate textile into a dress, whose exposed surfaces are almost entirely embellished with rich silver embroidery.\n\nMaria Fyodorovna’s extraordinary coronation ensemble was designed to stand out from the opulent array of court dresses that were on display on the day of her crowning in 1883 at Moscow’s Assumption Cathedral.\n\nIt was her prerogative as Empress to wear cloth-of-silver, which was inferior only to cloth-of-gold, on the occasion of her coronation, while everybody else had to wear fabrics that reflected their secondary status. Her maids-of-honour and ladies-in-waiting, for example, wore dresses of crimson velvet and gold-embroidered green velvet, respectively, which signified their position at court.\n\nAdditionally, as can be seen in Georges Becker’s marvellously detailed painting of her coronation ceremony, the women of the Russian Imperial family wear court uniforms in a dazzling variety of fabrics, colours and textures, some with trimmings of ermine and other types of fur round the edges of the décolletage, sleeves and train (see figures 9.6 and 9.7). Behind them are ladies who have no official standing at court, as is obvious from their lack of a badge or distinction, such as the red sash of the Order of St. Catherine worn by the grand duchesses, and therefore must watch from a distance (figure 9.8). They, too, are a multi-hued throng, having outfits of velvet or gleaming silk embroidered with foliate designs in gold. Like the Empress, each woman admitted to or representing the Russian court is attired in a three-piece ensemble wittily described by a contemporary as a “Frenchified sarafan,” but this has a bodice with white silk panels and a skirt of white silk or satin, all of which are richly embroidered. In contrast, Maria Fyodorovna’s lavish garments are a shimmering monochromatic mass of silver.\n\nThe shoes\n\nBibliography\n\nEfimova, L., T. Korshunova and L. Efremova.
