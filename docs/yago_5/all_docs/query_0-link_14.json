        "text": "Revolution came to Russia in March 1917. After meeting with her overthrown son, Nicholas II in Mogilev, Maria stayed for a while in Kiev, continuing her work for the Red Cross. When it became too dangerous for her to remain, she set off for the Crimea with a group of other refugee Romanovs. At the Black Sea, she received reports that her sons, her daughter-in-law and her grandchildren had been murdered. However, she rejected the report publicly as rumour. On the day after the murder of the Tsar's family, Maria received a messenger from Nicky, \"a touching man\" who told how difficult was the life of her son's family in Ekaterinburg. \"And nobody can help or liberate them - only God! My Lord save my poor, unlucky Nicky, help him in his hard ordeals!\" In her diary she comforted herself: \"I am sure they all got out of Russia and now the Bolsheviks are trying to hide the truth.\" She firmly held on to this conviction until her death. The truth was too painful for her to bear. Her letters to her son and his family have since almost all been lost; but in one that survives, she wrote to Nicholas: \"You know that my thoughts and prayers never leave you. I think of you day and night and sometimes feel so sick at heart that I believe I cannot bear it any longer. But God is merciful. He will give us strength for this terrible ordeal.\" Maria's daughter Olga Alexandrovna commented further on the matter, \"Yet I am sure that deep in her heart my mother had steeled herself to accept the truth some years before her death.\"\n\nDespite the overthrow of the monarchy (1917), the Empress Maria at first refused to leave Russia. Only in 1919, at the urging of her sister Alexandra, did she grudgingly depart, fleeing via the Crimea over the Black Sea to London. King George V sent the warship HMS Marlborough to retrieve his aunt. After a brief stay in the British base in Malta and later London, she returned to her native Denmark, choosing her former holiday villa Hvid√∏re near Copenhagen as her new permanent home. Although Queen Alexandra never treated her sister badly and they spent holidays together in a shared cottage in Great Britain, Maria felt that she was now \"number two\"."
