        "text": "After the tragic death of Alexander II, the government had been delaying the coronation of his successor for two years. On 24 January 1883, a decree establishing the coronation commission was signed, and on 27 March there was approved the ceremonial public transfer of the coronation regalia from the Brilliant apartment of the Winter Palace to the Armoury Chamber.\n\nOn 8 May 1883, the square before the Smolensky railway station was crowded with people in festive attires. On the platform, the ceremonial guard from the Leib-guard of His Majesty’s cavalry guard regiment greeted the Emperor. Together with his spouse and followed by the retinue, the Emperor moved in the open carriage towards the Petrovsky Palace.\n\nThe monarch’s solemn entry to the ancient capital took place on 10 May 1883. The buildings along the cortege’s way were decorated with state and national coats of arms and flower garlands. The white horse was prepared for the sovereign, the heir Tsesarevich Nikolay Alexandrovich also rode a horse, and Grand Prince Georgy Alexandrovich aged 12 rode a pony. The ceremonial carriage of the Empress was drawn by white horses in gold harnesses. The procession moved along Tverskaya Street under the unceasing ‘hurrah’ shouts. The gendarmes opened it; the Emperor's convoy and dragoons of the Pskov regiment followed them. Thereafter went: master of ceremonies, deputies of Asian nations subject to Russia, Moscow nobility, chamber lackeys, outrunners, hunters and blackamoors in oriental attires. On Cathedral Square, the Emperor with his spouse entered the freshly-restored Assumption Cathedral. Having visited the Archangel and Annunciation Cathedrals, the sovereign entered the Kremlin Palace to the peal of bells.\n\nOn 11 May, the mid-Pentecost, the Emperor with his spouse and sons was present at the consecration of the new Banner of State in the Trophy Hall of the Armoury Chamber. Then, he headed to the Throne Hall to observe the imperial regalia.\n\nThe next morning, the court clergy consecrated the Faceted Chamber, the wall painting of which was reconstructed upon the Emperor’s order by the Belousovs brothers, peasants of the Paleh village. At midday, the repetition of the coronation procession was held there. At that time, all around Moscow, the heralds read out loud the coronation announcements, throwing them in bunches to the crowd. On 14 May, the regalia were solemnly transferred from the Armoury Chamber to the Grand Kremlin Palace.\n\nAt the dawn of 15 May, the streets and embankments in the city centre were crowded with pedestrians and carriages that moved to different gates of the Kremlin, which opened at 9 a.m. and allowed entry by tickets only. By 7 a.m., Russian and foreign correspondents arrived at the cathedral to observe the ceremony. The select circle located itself on the roofed stands. When the Emperor appeared on the Red Porch, the loud ‘hurrah’ resounded. The sovereign in general’s uniform with adjutant-general’s aiguillette bowed friendly right and left. By the hand, he led the Empress, who was wearing ‘a white glazet dress, luxurious by its simplicity and grace’. Having entered the Assumption Cathedral, Their Majesties came close to the Royal Doors and ‘bowed three times before the Lord’.\n\nThe mantles, laid on the Emperor and the Empress, differed from all previous. Instead of numerous coats of arms, they had one big, made after the drawing of artist A. Lehmann and sewn on each mantle. When the metropolitans passed the crown to the Emperor, ‘the sovereign took it with the firm hands and with unhurried, calm, and smooth movement put it o his head’. Adjutant-General Count E.T. Baranov handed him the sceptre, and Count P. A. Valuev – the orb. The Empress knelt before the Emperor and he laid a Minor Crown on her head, then - the purple mantle, and the chain of the Order of St Andrew the First-Called. After that, the Emperor and Empress sat on ‘the ancestors’ thrones’. Alexander III sat on the throne of Tsar Mikhail Fyodorovich, and Maria Fyorovna - on the throne of Tsar Alexey Mikhailovich. To the peal of bells and ‘hurrah’ shouts, the procession went out of the Assumption Cathedral.\n\nA ceremonial dinner started at about 3 p.m. in the Faceted Chamber. Five tables for 59 guests were served out with ‘the historical tableware of the Armoury Chamber and new precious sets’.\n\nIn the evening, the illumination lit up. Its project was prepared by the famous inventor and military engineer of the Grand Kremlin Palace M.P. Fabritsius with artist Boitsov assisting: ‘It was not an illumination, but a heavenly sign: the Kremlin shining, the Kremlin radiant. Above the grandiose palace of crowned Emperor, a fiery crown was hanging in the air’.\n\nThe next two days in the St Andrew’s Hall of the Grand Kremlin Palace, marshals of the provinces’ nobility and heads of the volosts congratulated the imperial couple. In the morning on 21 May, the imperial family headed to the Khodynskoe field for public celebrations.\n\nOn 27 May, in the St Alexander’s Hall of the Grand Kremlin Palace, the farewell dinner was held for the Moscow authorities. The Emperor thanked them for the brilliant organization of the coronation festivities. The next day, Their Majesties left Moscow, where they had stayed for 21 days.\n\nMoscow, 1882.\n\nSilver; casting, champlevé enamel, gilding.\n\nSimilar dishes, made of precious metals, porcelain, glasses and wood, were used to present bread and salt to the imperial family on the occasion of coronation, solemn meetings and jubilee dates. This dish was presented to Emperor Alexander III on the coronation day of 15 May 1883 by the Tobolsk city council, which is proved by the monogram on one of the decorative enamel plaques and the inscription along its edge. The dish’s bottom is decorated with the enamel image of Ermak’s banner, which used to be the most valuable historical and military relic of the Berezov’s cathedral, where it had been preserved up to 1883. Berezov is the chief town of Tobolsk province. Legend has it that this banner was fluttering above the army of the renowned Cossaсks' ataman, who had put Khan Kuchum and his army to flight. At a later date, the image of this banner became the symbol of the Cossaсk army’s victories and Siberia’s conquest in the 16th century. The other plaques depict the Tobolsk coat of arms and images that symbolize the main occupation of the locals – fishing and wheat cultivating."
