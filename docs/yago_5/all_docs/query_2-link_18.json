        "text": "Portrait of Emperor Alexander III by Unknown Artist\n\nAlexander III Alexandrovich (1845-1894) - Emperor from 1881.\n\nSecond son of Emperor Alexander II (1818-1881) and Empress Maria Alexandrovna (1824 - 1880). Came to the throne after the assassination of his father, Emperor Alexander II, in 1881 by a revolutionary terrorist. Married (1866) to Danish Princess Maria Sophia Frederica Dagmar (1847-1928), who became Maria Fyodorovna when she accepted the Russian Orthodox faith. There were 6 children born of this marriage, including the future Emperor Nicholas II (1868-1918). At this time no significant changes were made in the architecture of Tzarskoje Selo, and only some of the interiors of the Catherine Palace were redecorated.\n\nJoin us on Facebook\n\nWe invite you to become a fan of our company on Facebook and read Russian news and travel stories.
