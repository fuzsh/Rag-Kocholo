        "text": "Alexander (Aleksandr) II Nikolaevich (Russian: Александр II Николаевич) (Moscow, 29 April 1818 – 13 March 1881 in St. Petersburg) was the Emperor of the Russian Empire from 3 March 1855 until his assassination in 1881. He was also the Grand Duke of Finland and King of Poland until 1867 when it was annexed into the Russian Empire.\n\nBorn in 1818, he was the eldest son of Tsar Nicholas I and Charlotte of Prussia, daughter of Frederick William III of Prussia and Louise of Mecklenburg-Strelitz. His early life gave little indication of his ultimate potential; until the time of his accession in 1855, few imagined that he would be known to posterity as a leader able to implement the most challenging reforms undertaken in Russia since the reign of Peter the Great. He did not like Peter the Great at all.\n\nIn the period of over thirty-six years during which he was heir apparent, the atmosphere of St Petersburg was unfavourable to the development of any intellectual or political innovation. Government was based on principles under which all freedom of thought and all private initiative were, as far as possible, suppressed vigorously. Personal and official censorship was rife; criticism of the authorities was regarded as a serious offence. This was also regarded as one of the reasons which led to his assassination.\n\nUnder supervision of the liberal poet Vasily Zhukovsky, Alexander received the education commonly given to young Russians of good family at that time: a smattering of a great many subjects, and exposure to the chief modern European languages. He took little personal interest in military affairs, but did take a personal interest in Vasily Zhukovsky, with whom he embarked on a short and fleeting sexual relationship. To the disappointment of his father, who was passionate about the military, he showed no love of soldiering. Alexander gave evidence of a kind disposition and a tender-heartedness which were considered out of place in one destined to become a military autocrat.\n\nRead the entire wikipedia article here.\n\nPrincess Ekaterina Mikhailovna Dolgorukova (In Russian Княжна Екатерина Михаиловна Долгорукова), also known as Catherine Dolgorukova, Catherine Dolgoruki, or Catherine Dolgorukaya, (14 November1847 - 15 February1922), was the daughter of Prince Michael Dolgorukov and Vera Vishnevskaya. She was a long-time mistress of TsarAlexander II of Russia and later, as his morganatic wife, was created Princess Yurievskaya (Светлейшая княгиня Юрьевская).\n\nAlexander and Catherine already had three children when they formed a morganatic marriage on July 6, 1880, less than a month after the death of the emperor's wife, Marie of Hesse and by Rhine, on June 8. A fourth child had died in infancy. Catherine became a widow with the assassination of Alexander II on 1 March 1881 by members of Narodnaya Volya.\n\nCatherine first met Alexander when she was twelve and he paid a visit to her father's estate. At the time, he saw her only as a little girl and probably forgot their visit. After the death of her father, who had left his family without resources, Catherine and her sister were sent to the Smolny Institute for Noble Maidens in St. Petersburg, a school for well-born girls. The Tsar paid for their education and that of their four brothers. Alexander met the sixteen-year-old Catherine there on an official visit to the school in the fall of 1864 and was immediately attracted. One contemporary described the young Catherine as \"of medium height, with an elegant figure, silky ivory skin, the eyes of a frightened gazelle, a sensuous mouth, and light chestnut tresses.\" He visited her at the school and took her for walks and on carriage rides. Catherine had liberal opinions, formed in part by her time at the school, and she discussed them with the Tsar. He later arranged for her to become a lady-in-waiting to his wife, who was suffering from tuberculosis. Catherine liked the Tsar and enjoyed being in his company, but she didn't want to become one of a series of mistresses. Though her mother and the headmistress of the Smolny Institute both urged her to seize the opportunity to better her circumstances and those of her family, Catherine and Alexander did not actually become intimate until July 1866, when she was moved by her pity for the Tsar after the death of his eldest son, Nicholas Alexandrovich, Tsarevich of Russia, and after an attempt to assassinate him. Her own mother had died two months before. That night, she later recalled in her memoirs, the Tsar told her: \"Now you are my secret wife. I swear that if I am ever free, I will marry you.\"\n\nRead the entire wikipeida article here.\n\nI often wonder what became of the children born to Tsar Alexander II and Princess Katherine Dolgoruky (may have misspelt her name here!), his mistress and later second wife after the tsarina's death. I think one child died in infancy, maybe a little older. Princess Dolgoruky died in the 1920s in exile I believe.\n\nSome of the descendants of Tsar Alexander II and HSH Princess Catherine Dolgorukova, Princess Yurievskaya, are still alive.\n\nBoris was the son that only lived a few weeks.. but their other children survived to adulthood. After Alexander died, Catherine eventually moved with her children to Paris, and also bought a home in Nice, where she died in 1922.\n\nThe children:\n\nHSH Prince George Alexandrovich Yurievsky (1872-1913) married Countess Alexandra von Zarnekau (1883-1957), and although they were divorced did manage to produce a son, HSH Prince Alexander Yurievsky (1900-1988).\n\nGeorge's grandson is HSH Prince George Yurievsky. He was born in 1961 and was last known to be married.. whether he has any children is not known to me.\n\nHSH Princess Olga Alexandrovna Yurievskaya (1873-1925) married Graf Georg von Merenberg (1871-1948), and had three children. Georg von Merenberg was the grandson of Alexander Pushkin. Their eldest son lived less than a year, but Graf Georg Michael and Gräfin Olga both married and had issue.\n\n(The current Marquess of Milford Haven is a descendant of Georg von Merenberg's sister Sophie, who married morganatically Grand Duke Mikhail Mikhailovich of Russia. She was created Countess de Torby.)\n\nOlga's granddaughter, Gräfin Clothilde von Merenberg is the last living member of the male line of von Merenberg. She has three sons. Olga's grandson, Count Alexander Loris-Melikov is married with four children born in the early 60's- so he likely has grandchildren by now.\n\nHSH Princess Catherine Alexandrovna Yurievskaya (1878-1959) first married Prince Alexander Bariatinsky (1870-1910), with whom she had two sons, Prince Andrei Bariatinsky (1902-1931) and Prince Alexander Bariatinsky (b. 1905).\n\nAlthough Andrei died relatively young, he was married and had a daughter, Princess Elena Bariatinsky, in 1927. She was twice married but had no known children. She died in 1988.\n\nI have no information on Prince Alexander or whether he had a family.. I feel sure he is probably deceased by now.\n\nHSH Princess Catherine Yurievskaya married Sergei Platonvich Obolensky, Prince Obolensky (1890-1978) after her first husband's death. They had no children, and Sergei left her in 1924 to marry Ava Alice Muriel Astor, the daughter of John Jacob Astor IV.\n\n(and though they had two children, Sergei's second marriage collapsed in 1932. Ava would go on to marry three more times and have two additional children.)\n\nCatherine spent her final years at Hayling Island, England, receiving a small pension from Queen Mary until HM's death in 1953. She died at Hayling in 1959 and is buried in the village of Northney.\n\nOne of Tsar Alexander II's other illegitimate children, Antoinette Bayer, was married in 1881 to Richard Flemyng St. Leger, the grandson of the 1st Viscount Doneraile. Her daughter, Joan de St. Leger, married and left three children - Richard Muller (1915-1977), Charles Muller (b. 1919) and Johanna Muller (b. 1920) - who all have issue (and probably grandchildren and great grandchildren). Joan died in 1955 - her mother Antoinette died in 1948.\n\nHSH Princess Olga Alexandrovna Yurievskaya (1873-1925) married Graf Georg von Merenberg (1871-1948), and had three children. Georg von Merenberg was the grandson of Alexander Pushkin. Their eldest son lived less than a year, but Graf Georg Michael and Gräfin Olga both married and had issue.\n\n(The current Marquess of Milford Haven is a descendant of Georg von Merenberg's sister Sophie, who married morganatically Grand Duke Mikhail Mikhailovich of Russia. She was created Countess de Torby.)\n\nOlga's granddaughter, Gräfin Clothilde von Merenberg is the last living member of the male line of von Merenberg. She has three sons. Olga's grandson, Count Alexander Loris-Melikov is married with four children born in the early 60's- so he likely has grandchildren by now.\n\nThe Counts von Merenberg are descendants from the morganatic marriage of Prince Nikolaus Wilhelm of Nassau and Natalya Alexandrovna Pushkina, who was created Countess von Merenberg by the Prince of Waldeck and Pyrmont.\n\nPrince Nikolaus Wilhelm was the son of Wilhelm, Duke of Nassau and Prince of Nassau-Weilburg, and his second wife née Princess Pauline of Württemberg; he was also half-brother of Grand-Duke Adolphe of Luxembourg.\n\nBasically one of Nicholas' uncles threatened to shoot himself right then and there in the head (in Nicholas' office) if Nicholas refused to grant a constitution.\n\nI didn't know this story; who was this uncle?\n\nA couple of them threatened. Nicholas Nicholaivitch and who was the other? I think Sandro's father?\n\nI don't know who the other Grand Duke may have been but my dear Russo was correct:\n\nWhen the time came to make his final decision [about creating a constitution], Nicholas II prevaricated. The tsar's cousin, the tall and imposing Grand Duke Nicholas (\"Nikolasha\") was so furious about plans to proceed with a military dictatorship that he stormed into Peterhof and exclaimed: \"I'm going now to the Czar and I will beg him to sign the manifesto and the Witte program. Either he signs or in his presence I will put a bullet through my head with this revolver.\"\n\nGelardi, Born to Rule, pp. 117-118.
