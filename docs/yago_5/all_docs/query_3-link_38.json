        "text": "After visiting the exhibition “1917: Romanovs and Revolution” in the Hermitage (Amsterdam), I rediscovered a powerful personality: Dagmar … better known as Maria Feodorovna. She was the daughter of King Christian IX of Denmark, the wife of Tsar Alexander III of Russia, the mother of Nicholas II and sister of Alexandra, Queen of England. This blog is about these two special sisters.\n\nYouth\n\nBoth girls were born in Copenhagen: Princess Alexandra or “Alix” on December 1, 1844 and Princess Dagmar on November 26, 1847. Their father was Prince Christiaan and their mother Princess Louise of Hesse-Kassel.\n\nTheir parents were noble but not rich, so they were forced to take care of the education of their children themselves. Everything changed when King Frederick VII of Denmark designated Christiaan as his successor. Because of the good marriages of his children he was called the “father-in-law of Europe”.\n\nMarriages\n\nAlexandra married on March 10, 1863 with the British Prince Albert Eduard, Prince of Wales, also known as “Bertie”. Alexandra was not Victoria’s first choice because the Danes could not agree with Prussia (country where her eldest daugher Vicky now lived). But when they actually met, Queen Victoria was overwhelmed by the beauty of the young Alexandra. Victoria gave her approval for the wedding. Eduard too was charmed by his future wife. The marriage was closed on March 10, 1863 in St. George’s Chapel in Windsor.\n\nDagmar’s mother, Queen Louise of Denmark, had always had a close relationship with the Russian court. In 1864, the engagement between Princess Dagmar and Tsarevich Nicholas was announced. In 1865, however, her fiancé became seriously ill, after which he died. Her mother and Tsarina Maria Alexandrovna decided after the death of Nicholas that Dagmar should marry the new Tsarevich, Nicholas’ younger brother Alexander. Alexander had been secretly in love with the fiancée of his older brother for a long time and was very pleased with this decision. Dagmar also developed an intense love for her new husband. After her marriage she was named Maria Feodorovna. Alexander and Dagmar married on October 28, 1866 in St. Petersburg.\n\nFamily lives\n\nAlexandra and Eduard had six children:\n\nPrince Albert Victor (1864 – 1892)\n\nKing George V (1865 – 1936)\n\nPrincess Louise (1867 – 1931)\n\nPrincess Victoria (1868 – 1935)\n\nPrincess Maud (1869 – 1938)\n\nPrince Alexander John (1871 – 1871)\n\nDagmar and Alexander III also had six children:\n\nTsar Nicolas II (1868 – 1918)\n\nArchduke Alexander (1869 – 1870)\n\nArchduke George (1871 – 1899)\n\nArchduchess Xenia (1875 – 1960)\n\nArchduke Michaël (1878 – 1918)\n\nArchduchess Olga (1882 – 1960)\n\nThe sisters looked very similar, but that was certainly the case of their sons: King George V and Tsar Nicolas II. Judge for yourself! (tip: left is the son of Dagmar!)\n\nDramas\n\nThe death of Prince Albert Victor in 1892 was a heavy blow for the sensitive Alexandra. His death was quite suspected. Officially he would have died from pneumonia but there are rumors that he has been given an overdose of morphine. In any case, Alexandra insisted that Alberts room was left untouched. Her mother-in-law, Queen Victoria, had done the same when Prince Albert died in 1861.\n\nDuring the First World War, the already bad reputation of Tsar Nicholas and his wife Alexandra worsened, and the citizens developed a great aversion to the tsar and his family. During the Revolution, the tsar was deposed and he and his family were taken prisoner. Read my blog Four Sisters for this.\n\nThe entire tsar family was murdered on 17 July 1918 by the Bolsheviks. Maria Feodorovna refused to flee the country. At the urging of her sister Alexandra, she finally did so: the Crimean company fled in the spring of 1919 with some other relatives on board the British battleship HMS Marlborough. Maria Feodorovna spent some time in London as a guest of her sister Alexandra, but eventually returned to Denmark.\n\nLast years\n\nAlexandra became Queen of England after the death of her mother-in-law Queen Victoria in 1901. Together with Edward VII she ruled until 1910. Then she became Queen Mother. Alexandra died in Sandringham on November 20, 1925, as a result of a heart attack. She was buried beside her husband in St. George’s Chapel in Windsor.\n\nAfter fleeing from Russia, Maria Feodorovna was assigned a number of rooms in the Royal Palace in Copenhagen. She also spent a lot of time in her villa Hvidøre, where she eventually died in 1928. She was buried in the Roskilde Cathedral, where the burial site of the Danish royal family is located.\n\nFollowing her wish to be buried in Russia next to her husband “as soon as the situation in Russia was normalized”, she was reburied on 28 September 2006 by her husband in St Peter and Paul’s Cathedral in St. Petersburg, where since 1998 are also the graves of her son Nicholas II and his family.\n\nFor more images about the two sisters, have a look at my Pinterest boards:"
