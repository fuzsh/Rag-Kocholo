Alexander III was on the throne from 1881 to 1894.\n\nThe Russian Orthodox Church wants DNA proof for the remains before canonising two of the murdered Romanov children.\n\nThe Investigative Committee, a state body, says new checks are needed on those remains. Archive documents are also being re-examined."
