        "text": "Doug Roth was an investigative journalist with a highly critical bent towards costumed adventurers and wrote articles for the magazine Nova Express.\n\nBiography[]\n\nIn 1975, Doug Roth traveled to Karnak in Antarctica to interview Adrian Veidt.\n\nIn 1985, Roth was the first to observe a connection between the cancers of Wally Weaver, Janey Slater and Moloch with Doctor Manhattan. After an interview with Slater, Roth attempted to make Manhattan speak about these connections during Benny Anger's live TV show but was teleported to the parking lot outside of the studio.[1]\n\nThe right-wing tabloid ,New Frontiersman, called Roth a \"cocaine-advocator\".[2] In response to their attacks against him and his magazine, Roth appeared on TV and described the newspaper's appeals to costumed adventurers as \"attempting to graft an acceptable face onto glorified Klan-style brutality\". As for the accusations that Nova Express is funded by communists, Roth responded that his magazine is funded by an American delivery company.[3]\n\nDC Timeline[]\n\nIn February 1987, Roth wrote an article for the Nova Express titled \"The Strange Case of Roger Jackson\" revolving around the murder of New Frontiersman employee Seymour David.\n\nSnyder Timeline[]\n\nHBO Timeline[]\n\nThe Douglas Roth School for Media and Popular Culture at New Columbia University was named in his honor.[4]\n\nBehind the Scenes[]\n\nIn a unfilmed screenplay draft by Alex Tse, Adrian Veidt shot and killed Doug Roth to prevent him from uncovering his plot.[5]"
