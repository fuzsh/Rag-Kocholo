        "text": "About Me\n\nKen Hollings\n\nKen Hollings is a writer based in London. His work appears in a wide range of journals and publications, including The Wire, Sight and Sound, Strange Attractor, Frieze, Noon and Satori, and in numerous anthologies and collections. His novel Destroy All Monsters was hailed by The Scotsman as ‘a mighty slab of trippy, cult, out-there fiction, mind-bending reading’. He has written and presented critically acclaimed programmes for BBC Radio 3, Radio 4, Resonance FM, NPS in Holland and ABC Australia. Ken is the author of Welcome to Mars, The Bright Labyrinth, The Space Oracle, Inferno and Purgatory - all available from Strange Attractor Press/MIT. His latest book 'Paradise: The Trash Project Volume Three' will be published by Strange Attractor Press/MIT in the autumn of 2024. His album with Howlround as The Howling, Incredible Night Creatures of the Midway, is currently available from The Tapeworm.\n\nView my complete profile"
