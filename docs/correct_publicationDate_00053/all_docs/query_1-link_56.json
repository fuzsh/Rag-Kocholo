        "text": "All month, I have been looking at the life and works of William S. Burroughs. This month concludes with the regular “Book and Film” feature focusing on his seminal work Naked Lunch and its 1991 adaptation.\n\nThe novel:\n\nNaked Lunch by William S. Burroughs\n\nThe film:\n\nNaked Lunch\n\nWritten and Directed by David Cronenberg\n\nStarring: Peter Weller, Judy Davis, Ian Holm, Roy Scheider\n\nThe Novel\n\nWritten in Tangier from 1954-58 and published in 1959, William S. Burroughs’ Naked Lunch is widely considered as the writer’s most popular work. Causing a torrent of controversy after its publication, Naked Lunch contains graphic and explicit depictions of drug use, homosexuality, and violence. These depictions caused it to be subjected to an obscenity trial in Massachusetts, where it is found to be “not obscene” by the judge, and rightfully so. The portrayals of drugs, sex, and violence serve a purpose, namely to satirize 1950’s American society and its tendency to push these perceived taboos to the margins, all the while enforcing the death penalty. This critique of American culture is typical of the Beat oeuvre, echoing Allen Ginsberg’s Howl and, later, Gregory Corso’s poem “Bomb.” In addition to its brilliant satire, Burroughs also brings disorienting surrealism and unique cut-up style against a sci-fi/noir backdrop.\n\nOne of the notable elements of Burroughs’ Naked Lunch is his use of the non-linear narrative. Burroughs utilized “the cut-up” technique, introduced to him by his friend Brion Gysin. The technique involves taking a linear narrative, cutting up the text into groups of a couple of words, and then rearranging the words into a new text. Burroughs would also use this technique in his other “Word Hoard” novels The Soft Machine, The Ticket That Exploded, and The Nova Express. By utilizing this technique for Naked Lunch, Burroughs removed any semblance of a cohesive, linear narrative and undercut typical literary conventions. But Burroughs did not just break rules when it came to literary style; he also broke down barriers when it came to depictions of sexuality.\n\nPart of the reason Naked Lunch was seen as controversial at the time of its publication in 1959 was because of its explicit depictions of sexuality, namely homosexuality and taboos. One such instance is the passage entitled “A.J.’s Annual Party.” The people gathered at a party watch a show called “The Great Slashtubitch.” The show depicts a graphic sexual encounter between a young man and a woman. The encounter is elaborated on in graphic detail: “As she sucks down toward the root of his cock she tickles his prostate mockingly. He grins and farts. She is sucking his cock now in a frenzy.” Following the first encounter, she uses a dildo (Steely Dan, the source of the band name) and proceeds to sodomize him. Rather than marginalizing such depictions of sexuality, Burroughs brings it to the forefront in extensive and explicit detail. By bringing this sexuality front and center, the novel aims to normalize such sexual activity for the reader and satirizes the tendency to push these activities to the sidelines. Burroughs also does a similar thing with violence and the death penalty.\n\nBurroughs also uses explicit and twisted depictions of violence as a comment on the death penalty. The show the partygoers watch features a scene where one of the characters is hanged: “He leaves her tied on the platform in a pile of old used condoms while he adjusts the rope across the room . . . and comes back carrying the noose on a silver tray. He jerks her to her feet and tightens the noose. He sticks his cock up her and waltzes around the platform and off into space swinging in a great arc . . . “Wheeeeee!” he screams, turning into Johnny. Her neck snaps. A great fluid wave undulates through her body.” This is followed by the characters in the film getting sexual gratification from watching this act. This strange act of violence and sexual satisfaction is a comment on the death penalty. Burroughs is equating the way people observe an execution to watch a convict die to this odd burlesque, getting pleasure from someone in extreme pain/ dying. Burroughs forces the reader to watch this display and reflect on how this compares to the public spectacle of an execution.\n\nAs an important text in the counter-culture movement, Naked Lunch puts American culture under a microscope and points out flaws in a harsh, blunt way. Its groundbreaking style, smart style, and infamous graphicness are part of the reasons why it became as popular as it was notorious. The draw towards adapting it for film is certainly tantalizing. Burroughs himself attempted to try to adapt it into a film, but funding fell through. It would take thirty-two years after its publication before someone would have the wherewithal and vision to take on the novel and turn it into a film.\n\nThe film\n\nBy 1991, Burroughs had been involved in a few films, mainly as cameos. His most significant role prior to his involvement in Naked Lunch was a role as Tom the Junkie Priest in Gus Van Sant’s Drugstore Cowboy. As well, none of his works had really been adapted for the screen, mainly because they were thought to be unfilmable. But David Cronenberg, an admirer of Burroughs’, decided to take on the herculean task of adapting his most famous work Naked Lunch. Having already directed films such as Scanners, Videodrome, The Fly, and Dead Ringers, Cronenberg had made a name for himself as a director with an eye for the strange and surreal, and a master of “venereal horror.” With Burroughs’ blessing, Cronenberg set out to film what is more an adaptation of Burroughs’ life and novels than it is an adaptation of Naked Lunch.\n\nUnlike the novel, the film follows a relatively cohesive and linear storyline. The film follows Bill Lee (Peter Weller), an exterminator who discovers his wife Joan (Judy Davis) is using his bug powder as drugs. After getting arrested and having a hallucination involving a bug with a talking sphincter, Lee goes home and accidentally kills his wife after getting high and playing a round of William Tell. From there, he flees to the Interzone,” writes his novel Naked Lunch, encounters a woman named Joan who looks exactly like his dead wife and her husband (Ian Holm), and becomes involved in an investigation regarding the narcotic “Black Meat,” a drug derived from giant centipedes. The film also features Nicholas Campbell, Julian Sands, and Roy Scheider as Dr. Benway. Peter Weller pulls off the Burroughs look well; he wears a rumpled brown suit and brown fedora to match his gaunt face. The only thing he is missing is the whiskey-soaked, cigarette-stained, Midwest growl. Judy Davis is also great as Lee’s stoned wife and her doppelganger Joan. It is abundantly clear that the cast is invested in Cronenberg’s appropriately weird vision of Burrough’s work. And Cronenberg is clearly invested in honouring Burroughs’ work.\n\nCronenberg doesn’t make a straight adaptation of Naked Lunch. Rather, it is more of a thematic adaptation of the novel and what it represents. Some of the main superficial elements are in the film: the appearance of Dr. Benway, the “black meat” drug, the mugwumps, the overall science fiction-esque and oddly noir atmosphere are all involved in the film and the novel. But Cronenberg carefully selects what themes get fleshed out. Lee becomes addicted to the “black meat” and hallucinated bugs with talking assholes, persuading him to kill his wife and report on the drug trade while in the Interzone. This is especially played up well, thanks to Cronenberg’s experience on The Fly, with the animatronic insects. He also adds in how this addiction affects others around Lee, such as his friends and the two incarnations Joan, and showing Lee going through withdrawal symptoms. Although it is nowhere near as explicit as it is in the novel, Cronenberg also emphasizes Lee’s homosexuality and the sexuality of other characters. The terms “fag” and “queer” get tossed around disparagingly, like in the novel, in order to highlight homosexual marginalization. Yet, at the same time, it is commonplace. Lee hangs out with Kiki, his male lover, in the Interzone. As well, when Lee meets Joan and her husband Tom (Ian Holm), they tell him they are looking for a young man for their threesome. While Cronenberg incorporates these elements from the novel into the film, he also adds in other sources to the film that underscores the themes of the novel.\n\nThe adaptation of Naked Lunch not only pulls themes from the source novel, but also uses elements from Burroughs’ life. One such real life instance Cronenberg includes is the characters Hank (Nicholas Campbell) and Martin (Michael Zelniker) as analogues for Jack Kerouac and Allen Ginsberg respectively. Like when Burroughs was writing Naked Lunch in Tangier, Hank and Martin visit Lee in the Interzone (which is stylized like Morocco) to check on Lee and help him edit his novel. But the most notable element from Burroughs’ life included in the film is the infamous “William Tell incident.” In 1951, Burroughs and his wife Joan Vollmer got drunk and decided to play “William Tell.” Burroughs accidentally killed Vollmer when he missed the glass. The incident was crucial in Burroughs’ life because, according to him, he “would never have become a writer but for Joan’s death” and would play a large role in his works. Including this incident in the film, twice, has two functions. For one, it is the catalyst for Lee heading to the Interzone and start writing, much like in real life. Secondly, Lee uses it as “proof” that he is a writer. The film ends with a border guard asking for proof that he is a writer. When a pen is insufficient, he re-enacts the “William Tell incident” again with the Joan he met in the Interzone. The guard accepts this as evidence that Lee is a writer. By incorporating these elements from Burroughs’ life, Cronenberg effectively highlights the themes prevalent in Naked Lunch and adds depth to the story.\n\nVerdict:\n\nWilliam S. Burroughs’ Naked Lunch is his most well-known work and a key work in the counter-culture moment. Its then controversial elements make for great satire, holding up a mirror to 1950’s American society. The novel’s graphic sexuality, explicit violence, and the non-linear, cut-up method used makes it difficult for a film adaptation. But David Croneberg smartly opted not to aim for a straight-forward adaptation of Naked Lunch for his 1991 film. Rather, he took key themes from Burroughs’ novel and incorporates them with important aspects of Burroughs’ life, namely the development of Naked Lunch and his motivations for becoming a writer. In this regard, Naked Lunch is an excellent take on this hard to film novel. The cast is game for the weirdness Cronenberg is aiming for, and his experience on his previous films (especially Scanners, Videodrome, and The Fly) helps in developing the surrealistic atmosphere Burroughs achieved in the novel. Fans of Burroughs’ work will appreciate the elements from Burroughs’ life and will surely appreciate Cronenberg’s audacity and enthusiasm in taking on this great novel.\n\nBook and Film will return in January 2015. Have a suggestion for a Book and Film feature? Leave it in the comments!\n\nThis month I am looking at the life and work of William S. Burroughs. This week focuses on his first published novel Junky.\n\nPublished in 1953 under the pseudonym William Lee, William S. Burroughs’ first novel (that was published; And the Hippos Were Boiled in Their Tanks was written earlier but not published until 2008) Junky introduced the seedy world of heroine and morphine use in the 1950’s to the masses. The novel is a semi-biographical account of Burroughs’ morphine addiction and his frequent comings and goings to the drug. His honest and graphic account of his journey through addiction caused controversy, but certainly set the tone for his future works such as Naked Lunch and the Cut-Up Trilogy. Junky is part guide to the addict world, part confession, and part reflection on the criminal system and its attitude towards addicts in the 1950’s, and Burroughs’ journey through this underworld ultimately leads to a smart analysis of addicts and their complex life.\n\nBurroughs starts by mentioning his roots and family life growing up in the prologue. He says that he had “all the props of a safe, comfortable way of life that is now gone forever.” He talks about how he grew up in “a large Midwest town,” went to a “private, suburban high school,” and attended “one of the Big Three universities. Burroughs describes his early life deliberately vague as a way to engage the reader have them buying into the plausibility that story could have happen to anyone. At the same time, though, he paints a picture of a well-to-do upbringing that sets the bar to show how far he fell as an addict. He also claims that it is due in part to his upper-crust upbringing that he decided to he would become an opium user: “I recall hearing a maid talk about opium and how smoking opium brings sweet dreams, and I said: ‘I will smoke opium when I grow up.’” This declaration effectively sets up a journey into the world of an addict, with Burroughs as our tour guide.\n\nOne of the main reasons why Junky was considered controversial at the time of its release was because of its unflinching look at morphine addiction and its effects. Burroughs guides the reader through how morphine feels to the addict in great detail: “Morphine hits the back of the legs first, then the back of the neck, a spreading wave of relaxation slackening the muscles away from the bones so that you seem to float. As this relaxing wave spread through my tissues, I experienced a strong feeling of fear. […] I felt nauseous.” Burroughs details all the nuances and feelings one experience while on junk to the average person like they are actually going through it themselves. Also like a good guide, he explains terminology unfamiliar to the average non-addict. For example, he explains that “a syrette [which is used to administer junk] is like a toothpaste tube with a needle on the end. You push the pin down through the needle; the pin punctures the seal; and the syrette is ready to shoot.” As well, Burroughs provides some insight on where one can find junk. He likens finding a neighbourhood with junk to how “a geologist looking for oil is guided by certain outcroppings of rock.” The key to finding junk, he says, is to look “adjacent to ambiguous or transitional districts [with] stores selling artificial limbs, wig-makers, dental mechanics, loft manufacturers of perfumes, pomades, novelties, essentials oils. A point where dubious business enterprise touches Skid Row.” Burroughs knowledge of how morphine feels, the terminology, and where to locate drugs, and his ability to go into colourful detail, is only one level of the complexity this novel possesses.\n\nJunky is not only a guide to the world of addiction, but it also studies the motives behind why one might become an addict. He addresses some frequently asked questions that he would get whenever people (the law) would ask him about his addiction. One question Burroughs received constantly regarded why he tried junk and why he kept on using it to the point he became an addict. Burroughs explains that “you become a narcotics addict because you do not have strong motivations in any other direction. Junk wins by default.” In other words, it comes down to boredom. He also states that “you don’t decide to become an addict. One morning you wake up sick and you’re an addict.” Although this isn’t a catch-all explanation, it does provide some insight, at least in regards to Burroughs’ life, at why one might become an addict. And it is because of his privileged background, not so much in spite of it, that he became one. In addition to his story wherein he overheard the maid talk about opium, Burroughs states that he “did not have to have money.” Rather, he found it to be “a romantic extravagance to jeopardize [his] freedom by some token act of crime” and that it was “under these circumstances that he came in contact with junk.” Burroughs shows that it is not so much a lower class affliction, but an addiction that transcends class.\n\nUnlike alcohol and marijuana, Burroughs claims, morphine is not “a means to increased enjoyment.” Instead, “it is a way of life.” As is made clear in Junky, junk takes hold and controls Burroughs motives and desires. To answer why he needs narcotics, Burroughs says: “I need junk to get out of bed in the morning, to shower and eat breakfast. I need it to stay alive.” On top of these motives, Burroughs also looks at why an addict tries to quit junk. It is not so much a conscious decision as it is biological decision, according to Burroughs. “The decision to quit junk” Burroughs claims, “is a cellular decision, and once you have decided to quit you cannot go back to junk permanently any more than you can stay away from it before.” Although quitting junk is a biological decision, staying away from it is up to the person. But this discussion of motives brings the question of how someone can stay off junk and how effective treatments are.\n\nThroughout the novel, Burroughs frequently refers to different “cures” he uses to kick his morphine habit. One so-called cure he tries is a reduction cure. Burroughs explains: “I had the junk in solution and in another bottle distilled water. Every time I took a dropper of solution out to use it, I put the same amount of distilled water in the junk solution bottle. Eventually I would be shooting plain water.” This seems like a good, effective idea. Yet, Burroughs finds himself “four days later in Cincinnati, […] out of junk and immobilized.” He admits that he “had never known one of these self-administered reduction cures to work.” Another treatment he tries is at an institution in Lexington, Kentucky. The treatment “starts at a ¼ grain of M[orphine] three times a day and lasts eight days […]. After eight days, you get a send-off shot [and] receive barbiturates for three nights and that is the end of medication.” Four months later, though, Burroughs finds himself in New Orleans, back on morphine. But the many references to the term “cure” and the questionable effectiveness of these treatments devalues the meaning of the word. To denote something a cure implies that it solves a problem permanently. The way Burroughs uses the word, though, it seems more comparable to duct tape on a leaking boat, instead of a more comprehensive fix. These cures may seem questionable, but Burroughs desire to stay clean is equally doubtful.\n\nThe subtitle of the work is “Confessions of an Unredeemed Drug Addict” and the ending certainly fits that bill. Burroughs states that “when you give up junk, you give up a way of life” and that because they often can’t handle it “suicide is frequent among ex-junkies.” And while he is off junk, at least for the time being, he decides instead to search for the next fix: “I decided to go down to Colombia and score yage […] I am ready to move down south and look for the uncut kick that opens out instead of narrowing down like junk.” He doesn’t desire to truly get clean, nor does he really care about his personal life [“My wife and I are separated” he states rather nonchalantly]. Rather, he is dedicated to the “kick.” “Kick,” he says “is seeing things from a special angle. Kick is momentary freedom from the claims of aging, cautious, nagging, frightened flesh.” As has been made evident throughout the novel, Burroughs is an impulsive character, searching for the perfect fix (a theme that would carry on in his works, namely “The Priest They Called Him). He is hopeful that he finds the kick he is looking for: “Yage may be the final fix.” But ultimately, the ending indicates Burroughs’ struggle with addiction, a problem that would plague him the rest of his life.\n\nJunky is far from being a story of redemption. Rather, it is a story of a struggle and a confession to the masses. Burroughs is graphically honest and analytical, yet unrepentant and without regrets. His penchant for detail, knowledge of drugs and terminology, and unique characters make for an engaging read. Burroughs’ analysis of the motivations of how a junky is made, and the treatment of junkies from law enforcement are intelligent and unflinching. As his first published novel, William S. Burroughs’ Junky is a wonderful, controversial first impression on the literary world and truly indicative of what was to come.\n\nFor my last entry of Burroughs Month, I will look at the book and film versions of Burroughs’ most famous novel, Naked Lunch.\n\nThis month, we are looking at the life and works of William S. Burroughs. This week, the recording career of William S. Burroughs.\n\nWilliam S. Burroughs’ novels have influenced countless musicians. Artists from Sonic Youth, Patti Smith, R.E.M., and Steely Dan all claim to be inspired by Burroughs’ works. This large influence resulted in Burroughs being dubbed “the Godfather of Punk. But in addition to being an accomplished writer, Burroughs also created many influential recordings. Much like his writings, Burroughs’ recordings are twisted, witty, gritty, and unique. While some of his recordings are readings from his novels, many of them take on new form with accompanying music from talented musicians. The following is an overview of his notable recordings and albums.\n\nCall Me Burroughs (1965)\n\nBurroughs’ first album released in 1965 is a collection of readings from some of his novels. Armed with nothing but his smoky mid-Western croak and a microphone, Burroughs presents some of his finest and most abrasive writing. The first track “Bradley the Buyer,” a selection from Naked Lunch, sets the tone for the writings presented on the album. “Bradley” focuses on the unfortunate story of the titular buyer, a narcotics agent, who tries to seduce his boss. The story is classic Burroughs, a raw look at sex, and death. Another reading from Naked Lunch, “Meeting of the International Conference of Technological Psychiatry,” the excerpt can be best described as Kafka’s Metamorphosis set in Burroughs’ warped dystopia.\n\nBut while the selection presented on Call Me Burroughs is a good snapshot of Burroughs’ style and themes in his work, it is heavily unbalanced in terms of from where the readings are derived. Two of the tracks, understandably, are from Naked Lunch, and one, “Where You Belong,” is from The Soft Machine. The remaining five tracks are from his at the time recent novel Nova Express. As a result, the record is more akin to a band going on tour to promote their new album by playing most its tracks, rather than performing the breadth of their works. The bareness of the album, however, works well, and establishes a good jumping off point for some of Burroughs’ other records.\n\nTop tracks: “Bradley the Buyer” “Meeting of the International Conference of Technological Psychiatry” “Where You Belong”\n\nSeven Souls (1989; with Material)\n\nThe album is not so much a William S. Burroughs album as it is a Material album. Bill Laswell, the leader and sometimes sole member of the band Material, created an album that consists of ambient, eastern-influenced music with flares of rock and funk peppered throughout. On some of the tracks, Burroughs reads from his novel The Western Lands, the third novel of Burroughs’ Red Night Trilogy. Laswell’s music makes for a great tonal companion to Burroughs’ words.\n\nSome might recognize the title track from the opening scene of The Sopranos’ sixth season episode “Members Only.” The music is an eastern-influenced slow dance funk that grooves along while Burroughs’ drawl reads on about the seven souls of Egyptian mythos. “The Western Lands” rolls on like a caravan through the Sahara as narrated by Burroughs. The final track, fittingly titled “The End of Words,” is a great coda to the album. The creepy ambience of the music is punctuated by Burroughs’ declaration that “the old writer couldn’t write any more because he had reached the end of words, the end of what could be done with words.” Seven Souls’s ambient music might drone on some of the instrumental tracks; however, it does make for great accompaniment to Burroughs’ readings.\n\nTop Tracks: “Seven Souls” “The Western Lands”\n\nDead City Radio (1990)\n\nWith a talented group of musicians and friends helping him, Burroughs released what is clearly his most complete album in 1990. On Dead City Radio, Burroughs brings his trademark sarcasm, wit, and stark imagery and pairs it with excellent backing tracks. Being helped by the likes of Sonic Youth, Steely Dan’s Donald Fagen, Chris Stein of Blondie, and John Cale, Burroughs and the people he influenced create tracks that as funny as they are at times frightening and disturbing.\n\nTake for instance Burroughs’ take on the end of times. Images such as “electric toothbrushes leap into screaming mouths” and “walls of glass melt and burn with madness and a million crazed eyes” are accompanied by a rising cacophony of horns and drums that crash and tumble seamlessly into the eerie strings that back “The Lord’s Prayer.” The sharpest track on the album, though, is “A Thanksgiving Prayer” in which Burroughs’ sardonically gives thanks for things like “the American Dream, to vulgarize and to falsify until the bare lie shines through” and “for decent church-goin’ women with their mean, pinched, bitter, evil faces” set to patriotic sounding music. Dead City Radio stands out from his other albums in my mind because of the chemistry between Burroughs and his collaborators. The perfect mix of music and poems/stories make for an outstanding, unique album.\n\nTop Tracks: “A Thanksgiving Prayer” “No More Stalins, No More Hitlers” “Scandal at the Jungle Hilton” “Apocalypse/The Lord’s Prayer”\n\n“The ‘Priest’ They Called Him” (1993; with Kurt Cobain)\n\nPreviously recorded as “The Junky’s Christmas” on Spare Ass Annie and Other Tales, and made into a short film produced by Francis Ford Coppola, Burroughs took the opportunity to record the story again, this time with the assistance of Kurt Cobain, and release it as an extended single renamed “The ‘Priest’ They Called Him.” Burroughs’ story of a heroin-addicted priest giving his last fix to a junky in withdrawal at Christmas time is a twisted yet strangely beautiful story of redemption and achieving the “immaculate fix” of helping someone else in need. This oddly sweet story is fittingly accompanied by Kurt Cobain’s crunchy and messy version of “Silent Night” mashed up with “The Star Spangled Banner.” The combination makes for a classic Burroughs’ track. One that is gritty and sweet, and shows that Burroughs is worthy of the title “Godfather of Punk.”\n\nThis month, we are looking at the life and works of William S. Burroughs. First up, the 2010 biographical documentary “A Man Within.”\n\n“William S Burroughs: A Man Within”\n\nDirected and Written by Yony Leyser\n\nNarrated by Peter Weller\n\nFeaturing interviews with Patti Smith, Iggy Pop, David Croenenberg, John Waters, Amiri Baraka, James Grauerholz, Thurston Moore, Jello Biafra, Peter Weller, and many others.\n\nReleased in 2010, William S. Burroughs: A Man Within was a timely film, coming out the same year as Howl (with James Franco), and arriving at a time when an interested in Beat Culture was being resurrected (just look at the glut of films recently that have to do with the Beats: On the Road, Big Sur, and Kill Your Darlings). While an important member of the Beats, along with Allen Ginsberg and Jack Kerouac, Burroughs has never really been the focus of many exploits. Usually, he is an ancillary character in works like On the Road, a sort of wise old sage you visit when you need to escape or require advice. A Man Within, however, brings due focus a complex, central figure of the Beat Movement, and shows just how wide and deep his influence goes.\n\nThe film does well in establishing context for Burroughs’ work. Born in 1914, Burroughs was born into a wealthy family. Burroughs’ father gained his fortune through an adding machine company. Burroughs was also Harvard educated, where he graduated with an Arts Degree. Because of this upper-crust upbringing, the film contends, Burroughs novels pushed the boundaries of what was acceptable. Ira Silverberg notes that “class was essential in his work and life” mainly because “the most radical work tends to come from the upper classes” due to the fact that “they are trying so hard to shock, so hard to get away from their roots.” Indeed, many of Burroughs’ novels pushed not only what was acceptable to be published, but also pushed conventions such as narrative. Much of this upper-class influence in his work is mainly seen in the contrast of lifestyle such as in Junky or in Burroughs’ own life, mainly living often in slum like conditions and cavorting with drug dealers. But much of the films focus on Burroughs’ edginess lies within the theme of sexuality, in his work and in his life.\n\nA good portion of the film is dedicated to Burroughs’ sexual identity. It navigates the complexity of his desires, from marrying and having a child with Joan Vollmer to his unrequited love for friends like Allen Ginsberg. His sexuality informs many of works, particular Queer (written in 1953, but not published until 1985), and arguably his most famous work Naked Lunch. He was even hailed as an elder statesman to the Gay Rights movement. However, Burroughs was not one for labels, and refused to be pigeonholed into labels. James Grauerholz, who was also Burroughs’s partner, biographer, and occasional editor, perfectly sums up Burroughs’ sexuality: “Even when it was okay to be queer, he was beyond queer.” Burroughs was, if anything, an advocate with openness. The abrasive, in-your-face, titles of works like Junky and Queer show how Burroughs flaunted these labels, only to have them deconstructed and analysed in detail once you read the novel. This detailed look Burroughs’ complex sexuality does well to inform the film’s perspective of his life and key works. But in regards to his other work, the film is a little shortsighted.\n\nIn regards to mentions of his work, the film does well on focusing on the production of the first three he wrote, Junky, Queer, and Naked Lunch. The film makes it clear that these novels had a clear impact on the literary community and the public with their sensational titles and controversial subject matter. And they certainly deserve the coverage. However, Burroughs other novels, much in the style of his paintings, are looked at in a shotgun-style spread, often barely touching upon the subject. His cut-up trilogy, The Soft Machine, The Ticket That Exploded, and The Nova Express, are mentioned, with particular mention to the cut-up method used to create these works, but not given particular focus. The Wild Boys is brought up in passing by Patti Smith, saying only that it had an influence on her and her music, and his Red Night Trilogy (The Cities of the Red Night, The Place of Dead Roads, and The Western Lands) is hardly mentioned. While Junky, Queer, and Naked Lunch are certainly important works, due diligence is not given to his other works and their influence. But this broad stroked look at his work is also reflective of the way Burroughs is characterized in the film.\n\nThe film’s portrayal of Burroughs is contradictive. He is a clearly a complex, transgressive figure. As Peter Weller points out, “Burroughs was a deconstructor of labels.” Referring to him as a queer, subversive writer only touches surface of Burroughs’ identity. And yet, the film seems overly keen on labelling him, namely as a junky, as queer, and as a gun-lover. With intertitles that move the film from segment to segment, the film’s labelling of Burroughs becomes simplified. This ultimately results in some of the segments being short and shallow, not exploring well enough the reasons behind his addiction, or his love of guns, or, for instance, his stints in mental hospitals. At a scant 87 minutes in length, you cannot expect a documentary to successfully cover all these aspects to a full extent. The film would have done better with either more focus, or an extra twenty to thirty minutes in order to successfully explain and connect these aspects that make Burroughs the complex character that he was.\n\nOverall, the film is respective, honest portrait of William S. Burroughs. The interviewees provide great insight into what the man is like, occasionally with their own humorous impression of Burroughs’ distinctive Missouri drawl. Burroughs’ sexuality and class background is well-fleshed out, especially from interviewees such as Burroughs’ partner James Grauerholz and director John Waters. Although it provides great context and background for his major works, it fails to provide any detailed analysis of some of his other important works, such as the cut-up trilogy. As well, the film attempts to boil down a complex man into easy-to-fit characteristics, when in reality Burroughs would abhor this sort of simplistic view of his life. This broad characterization of Burroughs is also due to the fact that the film is less than an hour and a half long. Despite its short length, William S. Burroughs: A Man Within is a good primer for those interested in Burroughs, his life, and his work.\n\nNext Week: A look at some of William S. Burroughs’ audio recordings"
