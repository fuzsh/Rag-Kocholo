        "text": "Nova Express.\n\nBURROUGHS, William S.\n\nItem Number: 110687\n\nNew York: Grove Press, Inc, 1964.\n\nFirst edition, review copy of the final book in Burroughs’ Nova Trilogy, which he considered the sequel to Naked Lunch. Octavo, original cloth. With the publisher’s review copy slip laid in. Fine in a near fine dust jacket. Jacket design by Roy Kuhlman. Jacket photograph by Martha Rocher.\n\nWith Nova Express, Burroughs has added another grotesque layer to his edifice of corruption and decay, outrage and protest, hysteria and laughter in the same shocking and unsettling style as Naked Lunch. Burroughs composed the work using the 'fold-in' method, a version of the Dadaists' cut-up method, of enfolding snippets of different texts into the novel which he developed with close friend and artist Brion Gysin."
