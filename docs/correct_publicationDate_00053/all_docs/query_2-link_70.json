Burroughs on the merging of body, media, and machine. In the early 60’s and 70’s, William Burroughs wrote an elaborate set of instructions, encoded in novels and essays for how to use technology to escape control - societal, political and self-imposed. What emerged was a prophecy and a biological language for the technological takeover of the human nervous system.\n\nDecoder 2017 is first and foremost a cut-up machine that follows his instructions to confront the physical sensation of living today. This machine is turning out concerts one for each book of the “Nova Trilogy” (Soft Machine, Ticket That Exploded & Nova Express). It is played by cassette-tape DJ and sound artist G Lucas Crane and performer Jim Findlay, who act as both fictional characters and real-time systems operators cutting internet debris into kaleidoscopic dreamscapes, prophetic pronouncements and obscene routines that expose our complicity in the systems that control us. At the heart of the machine is an interface that connects the DJ via sensors on his tape decks to an array of technology that allow the analog body to control digital imagery.\n\nIn each concert there is an augmentation in the machine to mirror Burroughs’ evolving literary techniques. Where as Soft Machine experiments with more rudimentary cut-ups, a violent barrage of visual and auditory juxtapositions, Ticket That Exploded deploys the fold-in method, creating kaleidoscopic images, folded down the middle and triangulated. As we craft the final part of the series, Nova Express, we are experimenting with new feedback systems, as well as immersing the audience with 360-degree video. All these techniques are designed to induce visual hallucinations and a sense of enclosure within the system we are creating.\n\nWhen William Burroughs first emerged on the literary scene in the early 1960s, his writing was subject to numerous emotional, subjective responses, which focussed too strongly on the content of his novels and not strongly enough on their... more\n\nWhen William Burroughs first emerged on the literary scene in the early 1960s, his writing was subject to numerous emotional, subjective responses, which focussed too strongly on the content of his novels and not strongly enough on their compositional style. As a result, many readers have since approached his work with misleading expectations, finding themselves at best confused or disappointed, and at worst disgusted and nauseated. This paper proposes a reassessment of the way we read Burroughs’ novels of the 1950s and 1960s, arguing that our approach to his work must be informed by an understanding of his compositional techniques and setbacks: specifically, how and why he came to use the collage (or cut-up) technique in his writing. My paper will chart the development of Burroughs’ writing, from the linear narrative of his first novel to the transformation of his writing into the calculated collage style which makes up the majority of his later works.\n\nBurroughs’ novels are arguably what David Trotter would call ‘bad messes’, figuring ‘the world’s opacity in and through the disgust they provoke [...] [They] do not irritate us, or frighten us; they make us sick’. I propose that we reassess the squeamishness they provoke: our nauseated response to them may be a kind of kinetosis, or motion sickness, caused not by textual obscenity but by textual mess, which obstructs and problematizes the traditional processes of reading and interpretation. If readers are to focus on Burroughs’ medium, which was chiefly collage, they will find it possible to think of his writing less as a sequence of words which must signify meaning, and re-imagine it as a collection of images, over which one’s eyes may roam."
