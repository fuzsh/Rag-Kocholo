        "text": "Burroughs, William S.\n\nNova Express\n\nLondon, England, UK: Granada Publishing Limited./ Panther Books Ltd., 1972. First UK Softcover Edition Thus. Softcover. \"Listen to my last words any world. Listen all you boards syndicates and governments of the earth. And you powers behind what filth deals consummated in what lavatory to take what is not yours. To sell the ground from unborn feet forever-\" (first chapter, Last Words, first paragraph, pg. 9) The third & final volume in the cut-up trilogy by William S. Burroughs, Foremost Founding Father of the Beat Generation-&-Far-Beyond, profound & prophetic icon of twentieth-century American letters who is the very Patron Figure of our enterprise. First published in the USA by Barney Rosset's Grove Press during 1964, offered here is the first UK softcover edition thus of 1972 (third unique Panther imprint incarnation), mass-market format softcover, \"Granada Publishing Limited/ Published in 1968 by Panther Books Ltd./.../Reprinted 1969, 1972\" as stated on copyright page. With all points in Maynard & Miles, A10(f), pgs. 49 (image), 51; Shoaf, Section I, No. 10(h), pg. 30; Schottlaender (new 5.0 edition!), A10(D), pg. 8. The first Panther edition was published in 1968 (see our item No. 6383), & beginning in 1969, this publisher issued several softcover printings/editions of Nova Express as part of its \"Panther Science Fiction\" (front cover) series, this is the second \"reprinted\" version (effectively a first edition thus) of 1972, with uncredited front cover illustration described in M&M thusly: \"a scarred planet with a large hole near its top and a series of portraits above it.\" In contrast to the predecessor novels in the cut-up trilogy, Nova Express was first published in the USA as noted above, & all subsequent editions including this used the same text & order, until 2014, when a restored text edition, edited & with an introduction by Oliver Harris (foremost Burroughsian authority whom we're proud to call our friend & colleague at his European Beat Studies Network), was published. From the collection of Kevin Ring, editor-publisher of & contributor to Beat Scene magazine & other indispensable productions (many available here), & our good friend in the UK. A masterpiece of WSB's cut-up method, which is challenging but enables the reader to break through the confines of the pre-recorded universe! A collectible cornerstone in the WSB canon, in one of its rarest & most interesting intermediate near-contemporary forms, & with distinguished provenance- for the most-devoted WSB completist collector. See also our item No.s 1519, 3373. In relatively quite fine condition with mild rubbing, faint scratching & hints of fading, browning to front, back covers & spine; light wear & some tiny bumps, creases at edges & corners of same; mild-to-moderate rubbing, browning & occasional spotting to edges of text block. Interior (again relatively) fine with inevitable moderate browning to blank inner covers & pulp-quality page leaves (the latter esp. pronounced at blank margins/edges); tiny bumps at esp. upper corners of a few leaves. Fine. [Item #6476]"
