        "text": "On the seventh anniversary of 9-11, William S. Burroughs’ darkly comedic vision of worldwide terrorist anarchy seems sadly appropriate—and perhaps necessary: Burroughs gives us a much-needed measure of distance so we can look at our current plight from a fresh perspective.\n\nFrom William S. Burroughs’ The Soft Machine:\n\nIt was a transitional period because of the Synthetics and everybody was raising some kinda awful life form in his bidet to fight the Sex Enemy—The results were not in all respects reasonable men, but the Synthetics were rolling off that line and we were getting some damned interesting types by golly blueheavy metal boys with near zero metabolism that shit once a century and then it’s a slag heap and disposal problem in the worst form there is: sewage delta to a painted sky under orange gas flares, islands of garbage where green boy-girls tend human heads in chemical gardens, terminal cities under the metal word fallout like cold melted solder on walls and streets, sputtering cripples with phosphorescent metal stumps—So we decided the blue heavy metal boys were not in all respects a good blueprint.\n\nI have seen them all—A unit yet of mammals and vegetables that subsist each on the shit of the other in prestidigital symbiosis and achieved a stage where one group shit out nothing but pure carbon dioxide which the other unit breathed in to shit out oxygen— It’s the only way to live—You understand they had this highly developed culture with life forms between insect and vegetable, hanging vines, stinging sex hairs —The whole deal was finally relegated to It-Never-Happened-Department.\n\n\"Retroactive amnesia it out of every fucking mind screen in the area if we have to—How long you want to bat this tired old act around? A centipede issue in the street, unusual beings dormant in cancer, hierarchical shit-eating units—Now by all your stupid Gods at once let’s not get this show on the road let’s stop it.\"\n\nPosted everywhere on street corners the idiot irre-sponsibles twitter supersonic approval, repeating slogans, giggling, dancing, masturbating out windows, making machine-gun noises and police whistles \"And you, Dead Hand, stretching the Vegetable People come out of that compost heap—You are not taking your old fibrous roots past this inspector.\"\n\nAnd the idiot irresponsibles scream posted everywhere in chorus: \"Chemical gardens in rusty shit peoples!!\"\n\n\"All out of time and into space. Come out of the time-word ‘the’ forever. Come out of the body word ‘thee’ forever. There is nothing to fear. There is no thing in space. There is no word to fear. There is no word in space.\"\n\nAnd the idiot irresponsibles scream: \"Come out of your stupid body you nameless assholes!!\"\n\nAnd there were those who thought A.J. lost dignity through the idiotic behavior of these properties but he said:\n\n\"That’s the way I like to see them. No fallout. What good ever came from thinking? Just look there\" (another heavy metal boy sank through the earth’s crust and we got some good pictures. . .) \"one of Shaffer’s blueprints. I sounded a word of warning.\"\n\nHis idiot irresponsibles twittered and giggled and masturbated over him from little swings and snapped bits of food from his plate screaming: \"Blue people NG conditions! Typical sight leak out!\"\n\n\"All out of time and into space.\"\n\n\"Hello, Ima Johnny, the naked astronaut.\"\n\nAnd the idiot irresponsibles rush in with space-suits and masturbating rockets spatter the city with jissom.\n\n\"Do not be alarmed citizens of Annexia—Report to your Nearie Pro Station for chlorophyll processing— We are converting to vegetable state—Emergency measure to counter the heavy metal peril—Go to your ‘Nearie’—You will meet a cool, competent person who will dope out all your fears in photosynthesis—Calling all citizens of Annexia—Report to Green Sign for processing.\"\n\n\"Citizens of Gravity we are converting all out to Heavy Metal. Carbonic Plague of the Vegetable People threatens our Heavy Metal State. Report to your nearest Plating Station. It’s fun to be plated,\" says this well-known radio and TV personality who is now engraved forever in gags of metal. \"Do not believe the calumny that our metal fallout will turn the planet into a slag heap. And in any case, is that worse than a compost heap? Heavy Metal is our program and we are prepared to sink through it. . .\"\n\nThe cold heavy fluid settled in his spine 70 tons per square inch—Cool blocks of SOS—(Solid Blue Silence)—under heavy time—Can anything be done to metal people of Uranus?—Heavy his answer in monotone disaster stock: \"Nobody can kick an SOS habit—70 tons per square inch—The crust from the beginning you understand—Tortured metal Ozz of earthquakes is tons focus of this junk\"—Sudden young energy—I got up and danced—Know eventually be relieved—That’s all I need—I got up and danced the disasters—\"\n\nGongs of violence and how—Show you something— Berserk machine—\"Shift cut tangle word lines—Word falling—Photo falling—\"\n\n\"I said the Chief of Police skinned alive in Bagdad not Washington, D.C.\"\n\n\"Switzerland freezes all foreign assets.\"\n\n\"Foreign assets?\"\n\n\"What?—British Prime Minister assassinated in Rightist coup?\"\n\n\"Mindless idiot you have liquidated the Commissar.\"\n\n\"Terminal electric voice of C—All ling door out of agitated—Ta ta Stalin—Carriage age ta—\"\n\nSpectators scream through the track—The electronic brain shivers in blue and pink and chlorophyll orgasms spitting out money printed on rolls of toilet paper, condoms full of ice cream, Kotex hamburgers—Police files of the world spurt out in a blast of bone meal, garden tools and barbecue sets whistle through the air, skewer the spectators—crumpled cloth bodies through dead nitrous streets of an old film set—grey luminous flakes falling softly on Ewyork, Onolulu, Aris, Ome, Oston—From siren towers the twanging tones of fear—Pan God of Panic piping blue notes through empty streets as the berserk time machine twisted a tornado of years and centuries—Wind through dusty offices and archives—Board Books scattered to rubbish heaps of the earth—Symbol books of the all-powerful board that had controlled thought feeling and movement of a planet from birth to death with iron claws of pain and pleasure—The whole structure of reality went up in silent explosions—Paper moon and muslin trees and in the black silver sky great rents as the cover of the world rained down—Biologic film went up . . . \"raining dinosaurs\" \"It sometimes happens . . . just an old showman\" Death takes over the game so many actors buildings and stars laid flat pieces of finance over the golf course summer afternoons bare feet waiting for rain smell of sickness in the room Switzerland Panama machine guns in Bagdad rising from the typewriter pieces of finance on the evening wind tin shares Buenos Aires Mr. Martin smiles old names waiting sad old tune haunted the last human attic."
