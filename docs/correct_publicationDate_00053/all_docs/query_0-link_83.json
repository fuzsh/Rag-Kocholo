Only Inspector Lee of the Nova Police has any chance of stopping them, by dismantling the word and image machine before it's too late.\n\nThe third book of Burroughs's linguistically prophetic 'cut-up' trilogy - following The Soft Machine and The Ticket That Exploded - Nova Express is a hilarious and Swiftian parody of bureaucracy and the frailty of the human animal."
