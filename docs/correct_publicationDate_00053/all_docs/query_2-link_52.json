        "text": "A full refund will be given in the original form of payment for Textbooks and Access Cards during the first week of your class. Textbooks can be returned in person during bookstore business hours or they may be mailed back to the bookstore. You need to provide the original receipt and a copy of your class schedule showing the start date. We do not provide return shipping labels. Please pack securely if mailed! Damaged returns will not be refunded. We would recommend using a method of shipping that you can track. Any purchases after the first week of class are considered non-returnable.\n\nTextbooks and access cards must be in original condition and not exposed. Shrink-wrapped books must be returned with all items unused, and not activated. No refunds on unwrapped loose-leaf books. No refunds on Digital Content once accessed.\n\nRefunds mailed back to the bookstore need to use the address located on the top right corner of your receipt. The information is also located on the refund bookmark attached to your receipt.\n\nDigital Content Textbooks that were received electronically follow the same policy and they must not have been activated to be eligible for a refund. Please notify the store by phone or email for refunds of content received electronically.\n\nSome publishers are making textbooks available in an electronic format. This is made available to be delivered via email or a printed access card depending on the publisher. The bookstore does not control the terms of the electronic format or the length of access. Electronic format textbooks that have not been accessed or exposed follow the same return policy as printed materials.\n\nYou can purchase access to these electronic versions through the NOVA Bookstore website. If you are considering purchasing an electronic version of a textbook rather than a hardback textbook, be aware of the following information:\n\nIf your course allows open-book exams, you will not be able to use your electronic text, printouts of the electronic text or copies of the pages of a hardback textbook during the exam. If you will want to use your book on these open-book exams, you should opt to buy a physical book rather than an eBook.\n\nUnlike a hardback textbook, eBooks cannot be returned.\n\nAccess to an eBook may expire after a period of time. If you need the text for a second semester or get an extension to complete the course, you need to make sure you have enough time to complete the course(s).\n\nSome publishers block printing from electronic textbooks.\n\nSome publishers block the use of screen readers when accessing the electronic textbooks.\n\nTo determine what restrictions the publisher has placed on the eBook you are considering purchasing, after you have searched for the book in the Digital Textbooks site, click the book title and then click eContent Details on the NOVA Bookstore website.\n\nOrdering your NOVA Online books and other course materials for NOVA distance courses is easy. Just go to the NOVA Bookstore. Choose Textbooks and in the Select a Campus drop-down menu, select Alexandria Campus and NOVA Online.\n\nNote: NOVA Online course sections begin with an \"E\". You may order textbooks and other course materials by any of the following methods:\n\nOnline (preferred) (Note: Students can now use their Financial Aid to purchase their books online.)\n\nIn Person\n\nA complete list of course materials appear in your course syllabus. If you are unable to locate it, contact your professor directly."
