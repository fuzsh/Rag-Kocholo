        "text": "Nova Express by William S. Burroughs\n\nFIRST EDITION / FIRST PRINTING [1964] GROVE PRESS\n\nHardcover with dust jacket in excellent condition. Gorgeous copy!\n\nDust jacket has some light wear; a few wrinkled edges but overall in striking condition.\n\nBook looks and reads like new. Ex-libris sticker and a numerical stamp on flyleaf page, with a second numerical stamp on title page. Otherwise, excellent.\n\nThe Soft Machine introduced us to the conditions of a universe where endemic lusts of the mind and body pray upon men, hook them, and turn them into beasts. Nova Express takes William S. Burroughs’s nightmarish futuristic tale one step further. The diabolical Nova Criminals—Sammy The Butcher, Green Tony, Iron Claws, The Brown Artist, Jacky Blue Note, Izzy The Push, to name only a few—have gained control and plan on wreaking untold destruction. It’s up to Inspector Lee of the Nova Police to attack and dismantle the word and imagery machine of these “control addicts” before it’s too late. This surrealist novel is part sci-fi, part Swiftian parody, and always pure Burroughs."
