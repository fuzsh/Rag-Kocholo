Use this link to find bookstores in your area.\n\nAmazon $14.95\n\nBarnes & Noble $14.95\n\nEbook:\n\nISBN: 978-1-938288-98-2\n\nAmazon $9.99\n\nBarnes & Noble $9.99\n\nAbout the Book\n\nThe Earth is in peril—through pollution, global warming, oil spills, and general neglect of the environment. Those who respond first are the animals. There is The Fluff, a penguin; Creamy, a harp seal; Tomás, a black bear; Flora, a polar bear; and Lady Athabasca, a whooping crane, among others. The animals have all suffered from destruction to their habitats and neglect of the environment, and want to do something about it. They jump on a magical train powered by positive thoughts and take off to let others know about the problems Earth’s creatures are facing.\n\nIn Santa Fe, they pick up two young girls, Marina and Joanna, who record their incredible trip. The group travels east (as well as north and south) and along the way finds other friends who have endured hardship from fire, drought, and hurricanes. Their final destination is the White House, where they hope their call for help is heard.\n\nJoin The Fluff and friends on the Global Warming Express to save this beautiful world from pollution and global warming. It’s a trip worth taking!\n\nPreview\n\nThe train was suddenly tossed in the air as if it weighed nothing. Then, just as suddenly, it flew down to Earth, landed on what was left of the pavement, and started speeding through New York City again. The storm was over, but much of the city was ruined. The screen showed them images of destruction from all over New York. Even the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island had been affected.\n\n“Oh, my!” Flora cried. “What a terrible mess!” Creamy started crying again, as everyone saw the city houses, buildings, subways, and parks that had been flooded or ruined. Inoah started to cry—or screech—again. “It’s no use,” she sobbed. “I don’t think this can be fixed just by seeing the president.” Zingo suddenly stood up on a chair and declared: “You’re right! You can’t just leave this to the president. He may be in charge, but he’s only one dude. Real change takes a movement, a happening, a whole new mindset. You have to act. Because of climate change, this storm is one of the biggest to ever hit the East Coast,” he said, shaking his fist. “It’s your responsibility to create your own wonderful future! You guys can do this! I know you can! Look how far you’ve come already!”\n\nHe pumped his fist in the air, and the animals all cried out in agreement.\n\n“Now I need to leave you,” he said. “I have to see how my home held up. But remember: You guys have the power to fix this problem. Take it from someone who knows how to change in order to survive. Goodbye!”\n\n“Goodbye!” cried all the animals. “Good luck, Zingo!” They watched as he slipped out the door.\n\nAbout the Writer\n\nMarina Weber has been a passionate activist since she was six. Marina plays herself in the story. She believes in righting wrongs and in helping others to be heard, seen, and assisted. She is also fearless and single-minded when it comes to completing her quest, and was instrumental in establishing The Global Warming Express organization.\n\nAbout the Illustrator\n\nJoanna Whysner has been a serious artist since she was very young, and has won many prizes for her art. In the story, Joanna creates her world on paper, in line and color and form. Her sense of mischief and humor help her turn every drawing into a commentary.\n\nPraise for The Global Warming Express\n\nThis is the perfect book\n\nto begin conversations, educate kids and parents, and even help start up school programs in every neighborhood.\n\nThere are so many reasons to love this book. Not only is the cast unforgettable, but the subject matter is extremely important for people to learn about and address. In addition, the writer and the illustrator of this book may be young in years, but their awesome talent and passion for the subject is absolutely serious. This is the perfect book to begin conversations, educate kids and parents, and even help start up school programs in every neighborhood.\n\n—Amy LIgnor, Featherquill Book Reviews, 9/27/17\n\n___________\n\nThe tale is utterly charming, and the message urgent.\n\nPay heed. There’s not a moment to be lost.”—Author and environmentalist\n\nWilliam deBuys\n\n___________\n\nMarina is an incredibly talented author. I admire her and Joanna’s passion for combatting climate change. Great writing comes from great thinking, and these girls have a great future ahead.

It will help a lot of kids understand about Global Warming— and maybe even change the world.\n\n—Jill Cooper Udall, Member, President’s Committee on the Arts and the Humanities, former Cultural Affairs Officer, State of New Mexico"
