        "text": "Burroughs, William S.\n\nNova Express\n\nNew York, NY: Grove Press, Inc., 1964. First Edition. Hardcover. \"Listen to my last words anywhere. Listen to my last words any world. Listen all you boards syndicates and governments of the earth. And you powers behind what filth deals consummated in what lavatory to take what is not yours. To sell the ground from unborn feet forever-\" (first chapter \"Last Words,\" first paragraph) The third & final volume in the cut-up trilogy by William S. Burroughs, Foremost Founding Father of the Beat Generation & far beyond, profound & prophetic icon of twentieth-century American letters. Offered here is the first edition, first printing as noted on copyright page. Unlike the previous two volumes in the trilogy, The Soft Machine & The Ticket That Exploded, this edition published in the USA by Barney Rosset's famously fearless Grove Press is the very first incarnation of NE, & again unlike its predecessors there were no editions with alternate texts preceding or following it, until the restored text edition, edited & with an introduction by Oliver Harris, was published a half-century later (2014). See Maynard & Miles, A10(a), pgs. 45-47; Shoaf, Section I, No. 10, pg. 30; Schottlaender, A10(A) & (F), pgs. 7-8. Hardcover in unclipped dust jacket. A masterpiece of WSB's cut-up method, which is challenging but allows the reader to break through the confines of the pre-recorded universe! A collectible cornerstone in the WSB canon, in exceptionally very fine condition: Book with only the slightest fading, rubbing to edges & corners of orange cloth front, back covers & spine; very light browning, rubbing & occasional tiny spots at upper edge of text block. Interior very fine with only very small, coin-size area near upper right corner of first blank endpaper where sticker removed (?) including vertical series of pinholes, decreasingly echoed without penetration onto blank areas of next 5-6 page leaves; tiny bumps at upper corners of some leaves; otherwise substantially mint. Dust jacket in very fine condition with only very light rubbing to front, back covers & spine; light wear, creasing & a few tiny bumps at edges & corners of same including flaps. Very Fine / Very fine. [Item #3373]"
