        "text": "12 Books of Boyhood. #10\n\nIt is impossible to think that books 9 and 10 of my ‘boyhood’, Brideshead Revisited and The Naked Lunch were released in the same year, 1959. The one so traditional and the other so subversive, the next big step in what was possible in writing, after Joyce’s Ulysses.\n\nAs story-telling, Burroughs’ writing is nearly incomprehensible. In a step beyond stream of consciousness the author mimics the thought processes of a drug addict, barely connected words and phrases in a flow that may only be read as poetry – that is, for the words rather than initially at least, for the meaning, but from which meaning gradually/hopefully accrues.\n\nThe Rube has a sincere little boy look, burns through him like blue neon. That one stepped right off a Saturday Evening Post cover with a string of bullheads, and preserved himself in junk. His marks never beef and the Bunko people are really carrying a needle for the Rube. One Day Little Boy Blue starts to slip, and what crawls out would make an ambulance attendant puke.\n\np.21\n\nMy introduction to the Beat Generation was a slim book of Beat poetry belonging to RT, my best friend at uni. I would carry it around and read poems to myself out loud, though the only one I still remember went ‘Ta-ra for now the tadpole said/and wrapped his tadtail round his head.’ From there I graduated to Burroughs. I don’t think I ever read much Ginsberg and somehow I didn’t read Kerouac’s On the Road until some years later.\n\nIt is quite likely the Burroughs book I read first was Nova Express, “a social commentary on human and machine control of life” (Wiki) which would have been in the SF section of the Melb Uni Union library where I spent more of my time than I had to spare from 40 hours/week first year Engineering (plus College tutorials). I wish now it was Nova Express that I had chosen to reread for this project as I am finding Naked Lunch hard going.\n\nWikipedia begins its Plot Summary with “Naked Lunch is a non-linear narrative without a clear plot” and ends with “The book then becomes increasingly disjointed and impressionistic, and finally simply stops.” In between are lots of short chapters or ‘routines’, often with entirely different characters, as Burroughs’ alter ego, the homosexual drug addict William Lee, apparently moves from the US to Mexico to Freeland and the Interzone, which may be aspects of Tangier.\n\nDid I ever tell you about the time Marv and me pay two Arab kids sixty cents to watch them screw each other? So I ask Marv, “Do you think they will do it?”\n\nAnd he says, “I think so. They are hungry.”\n\nAnd I say, “That’s the way I like to see them.”\n\nMakes me feel sorta like a dirty old man but, “Son cosas de la vida,” as Soberda de la Flor said when the fuzz upbraids him for blasting this cunt and taking the dead body to the Bar O Motel and fucking it …\n\np.78\n\nIt is a commonplace to claim the 1960s as revolutionary, but they genuinely were, however much has been wound back since. The 1950s were the climax of a long period of intense mono-cultural conservatism. For those of us growing up in those years our parents were dinosaurs. We had to discard their religion, their morals, their politics, their England-is-home, their music. Burroughs’ work was illegal on three levels – drugs, homosexuality and the open discussion of sex – as well as representing a break from conventional styles of writing. Of course I had to read it.\n\nI reviewed some years ago William Burroughs’ Junky (1953), his first novel and the first of three, relatively straightforward works based on his life taking drugs in the US and Central America. Burroughs’ second period saw him living in North Africa and Europe and the publication of Naked Lunch and the Nova Trilogy – The Soft Machine (1961), Nova Express (1964), and The Ticket That Exploded (1962). He kept on writing and I have some of his later works – Exterminator! (1973) and Cities of the Red Night (1981), not that I can say anything about them.\n\nIn the Nova Trilogy Burroughs expressly adopts the ‘Brion Gysin cut-up method‘ – cutting up pages of text into sections and randomly placing them on a new page – but he had tried an earlier version of cut-up in Naked Lunch, composing it from a much larger collection of vignettes or ‘routines’.\n\nI’m pushing on with Naked Lunch but there’s nothing much else I can realistically say about it. At a later date I will read and review Nova Express, and there try and better fit Burroughs into the scheme of things – abstraction/experimental writing, erotic fiction, grunge and so on. I have William S Burroughs: A life (2014) by Barry Miles, 700pp that should keep me going for a while; and Melanie (GTL) has mentioned a couple of times Davis Schneiderman, “a scholar of Burroughs” (and author of SF novel Drain) whose Retaking the Universe: William S Burroughs in the Age of Globalization I have downloaded.\n\nwhite flash . . . mangled insect screams . . .\n\nI woke up with the taste of metal in my mouth back from the dead\n\ntrailing the colorless death smell\n\nafterbirth of a withered grey monkey\n\nphantom twinges of amputation . . .\n\n“Taxi boys waiting for a pickup,” Eduardo said and died of an overdose in Madrid …\n\np.260\n\nAnd so, when I finally get there, it comes to an end.\n\n.\n\nWilliam Burroughs, Naked Lunch (sometimes The Naked Lunch), first pub. 1959. My edition, pictured above, Corgi, reprinted 1972. 286pp.\n\nNext month (Nov. 2023): Joseph Heller, Catch 22"
