BURROUGHS, William S.

Nova Express.

New York: Grove Press, 1964. First U.S. edition and first printing. Hardcover. 187 pages. A novel from the author of "Naked Lunch" and "Soft Machine." A very good copy in cloth boards with some sunning to the base of the spine and some toning to the pages and in a very good dust jacket with some sunning to the spine and a tear to the top of the rear panel near the spine. Despite the flaws a very presentable copy.
