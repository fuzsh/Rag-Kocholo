        "text": "The S&P 500 is one of the key benchmark indexes used to measure the performance of the stock market. The S&P 500 index is a market-cap weighted index meaning that the largest companies in the index have the most impact on its performance. The S&P 500 includes stocks from across 11 U.S. market sectors.\n\nThe 500 companies included in the index are among the 500 largest stocks by market capitalization in the U.S. stock market. Investors canât buy shares in the index, but there are a number of index mutual funds and ETFs that track the index.\n\nHow does the S&P 500 work?\n\nThe S&P 500 is an index that includes 500 of the largest publicly traded U.S. stocks. The components of the index are selected by a committee that uses specific criteria to select the stocks to be included or dropped from the index.\n\nThe S&P 500 index was created in 1957 and is the first U.S. market-cap weighted index. A stockâs market capitalization refers to the total value of all outstanding shares. This is the number of the stockâs outstanding shares times the market price of the shares.\n\nThough the S&P 500 is a market cap weighted index, the index is quoted in points, not dollars, based on the calculation methodology used. The recent closing value of the index was 4566.75. This number will move up or down based on the movement of the underlying components of the index based on the calculation methodology of the index.\n\nHow is the S&P 500 calculated?\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average is a price weighted index: to calculate the value of the index at any point in time, you essentially add up the prices of the 30 index components.\n\nThe S&P 500 is different. The value of the S&P 500 is based on the float-adjusted market capitalization of the component companies that comprise the index. Float adjusted means that only the shares available to the public are included in the calculation, shares held internally by the company, management, governments or other companies are excluded from the calculation.\n\nCompanies with a higher market cap have a greater influence on the performance of the index than those with a smaller market cap. A recent look at the weighting of the holdings in the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY), the oldest U.S. ETF, showed that the top ten holdings in this fund that tracks the index comprised about 30% of the value of the index. At the time of writing these holdings were:\n\nApple.\n\nMicrosoft.\n\nAmazon.\n\nNVIDIA.\n\nAlphabet Class A.\n\nAlphabet Class C.\n\nMeta Platforms.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway Class B.\n\nTesla.\n\nUnitedHealth Group.\n\nWhat companies are included in the S&P 500?\n\nAccording to S&P, the criteria to be part of the index include:\n\nOnly U.S. companies are eligible.\n\nCompanies must have an unadjusted market capitalization of at least $12.7 billion with at least half of the shares be available (floated) on a public exchange.\n\nCompanies must have reported positive earnings for the most recent quarter and for the prior four quarters on a cumulative basis. This means that the company must have been public for at least a year to be considered.\n\nThe ratio of the annual dollar volume traded to the float-adjusted market capitalization should be at least 0.75 and the stock should trade a minimum of 250,000 in each of the preceding six months leading up to the evaluation date for inclusion in the index.\n\nSector balance is also a factor in the process for selecting a company for inclusion in the index.\n\nAll eligible U.S. companies listed on eligible U.S. stock exchanges may be included. REITs are eligible for inclusion; ETFs, ADRs, ADS and certain other traded securities are not eligible.\n\nThe market cap restriction greatly reduces the number of U.S. stocks eligible for inclusion in the index.\n\nHow to invest in the S&P 500 index\n\nInvestors cannot simply buy shares in the S&P 500 or any other stock or bond market index. These indexes are just benchmarks against which the performance of certain investments and some investment managers are measured.\n\nThe best options for individual investors who want to invest in the S&P 500 are through the purchase of one of the many mutual funds or ETFs that track the index. Some of the mutual fund options include:\n\nSome ETF options to invest in the index include:\n\nMany investors and financial advisors consider an S&P 500 fund to be a core holding in many portfolios. They will often use the core to build an overall asset allocation for an overall portfolio. To buy an ETF or mutual fund, you have to have an account at a brokerage like Tradestation. Roboadvisors like M1 Finance also offer investors exposure to S&P 500 indexed funds.\n\nIn recent years another version of the S&P 500 has emerged as far as funds covering S&P 500. That version is the equal-weighted S&P 500. This is not a change in the index, but rather another approach to investing in the index. As an example, the Invesco Equal Weight ETF (RSP) weights each of the 500 stocks in the index equally. Their reasoning is that this eliminates the concentration risk in funds that track the index on an âas isâ basis. This concentration risk stems from the fact that the ten largest holdings in the index currently comprise about 30% of the value of the index\n\nS&P 500 vs. other stock market indexes\n\nBesides the S&P 500, there are a number of prominent stock market indexes that are watched by investors.\n\nDow Jones Industrial Average\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average is an index of the stocks of 30 large blue chip companies. In order to be added to the Dow, the company must first be a part of the S&P 500 but cannot be part of their transportation or utilities indexes.\n\nUnlike the S&P 500, stocks in the Dow are weighted based on their share price. This can lead to some unusual situations such as a stock with a high share price but a lower overall market capitalization having a bigger influence on the index than a stock with a larger market cap. Also stock splits can have a significant impact here as well.\n\nNASDAQ Composite\n\nThe NASDAQ Composite index is comprised of the stocks of 3,000 companies that are listed on the NASDAQ stock market exchange. The NASDAQ Composite is frequently cited along with the Dow and the S&P 500 in the news media as key stock market indicators.\n\nThe NASDAQ Composite contains a high percentage of tech companies, this sector makes up about half of the index. The index contains well-known tech names such as Apple, Alphabet (Google), Microsoft and Amazon which are also part of the S&P 500.\n\nFrequently asked questions (FAQs)\n\nHow has the S&P 500 performed?\n\nFor the ten years ending June 30, 2023, the average annual performance of the S&P 500 was 12.86%. This return is representative of the index over the longer term, but this doesnât mean that investors in an S&P 500 index fund will realize these types of returns each year. In 2008 during the height of the financial crisis the index lost 37% for the year.\n\nDoes the S&P 500 include stocks from other market indexes?\n\nThe S&P 500 can include stocks from other domestic stock indexes such as the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the NASDAQ. For example both Apple and Microsoft are components of the S&P 500, the Dow 30 and the NASDAQ.\n\nAre stocks ever removed from the S&P 500?\n\nA subsidiary of Standard and Poorâs reviews the components of the index periodically to both add and remove companies from the index. If a companyâs market cap falls below the thresholds set for inclusion in the index, it will likely be removed. Recently SVB Financial Group was removed from the index following the failure of its bank Silicon Valley Bank."
