The index, established by Standard and Poor's in 1957, measures the performance of roughly 500 large U.S. companies publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ. The constituent companies are weighted by market capitalization, or the total dollar value of their issued shares.\n\nStocks on the S&P 500 account for about 80% of the U.S. stock market's value and the index is widely viewed as a benchmark of how well the market is doing overall. Many industries are represented, but the information technology, health care and financial sectors account for more than half of the companies on the index.\n\nCompare investing resources\n\nHow to invest in the S&P 500\n\nThere are several ways to invest in the S&P 500.\n\nBuying individual S&P 500 stocks\n\nOne route investors can take is buying individual stocks of companies represented in the S&P 500.\n\nThe financial data analysis firm Marketbeat lists all of the S&P 500 stocks, sorted by market capitalization.
