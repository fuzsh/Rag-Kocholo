        "text": "How meaningful are these records from a long-term historical point of view?\n\nTheoretically they mean almost nothing. There is very little evidence that stock market booms are necessarily followed by declines. And even less evidence that is it possible to reliably forecast the market based on trends.\n\nAre the indices good indicators about the broader market and the real economy?\n\nThe S&P 500 is a value-weighted index of large company stocks, and stock prices are forward-looking. When you invest in the stock market you are investing in future earnings and future growth of companies. Recently a few very large technology companies have dominated the index. Investors have bid up prices of these stocks based on expectations about their role in the future of the economy."
