        "text": "Time Period S&P 500\n\nChange Equal Weight\n\nS&P 500 Difference 1 Year 25.1% 11.9% 13.2% 3 Year 29.4% 25.5% 3.9% 5 Year 92.5% 74.4% 18.1% 10 Year 160% 123% 37% 15 Year 500% 449% 51%\n\nData source: yCharts. Performance as of Dec. 28, 2023.\n\nIt’s also worth noting that this isn’t unique to the S&P 500. In fact, the weighting issue is even more apparent in the Nasdaq 100 benchmark index. If you take another look at the Magnificent 7, you’ll notice that they are all Nasdaq stocks. They make up nearly 50% of the Nasdaq 100’s weighting. And while the Nasdaq was a tremendous performer in 2023, up 55% for the year, 21 percentage points of that would disappear if the index were equally weighted.7\n\nWill the S&P 493 outperform in 2024?\n\nThis disproportionate performance has led some to refer to the rest of the S&P 500 as the “Mediocre 493”. But some experts believe the rest of the companies in the index could start to catch up, especially if the Federal Reserve starts to cut rates and we can avoid a recession in 2024.8 There are a few reasons, including valuation, as the Magnificent 7 have an average P/E ratio greater than 50,9 which is more than double the average P/E of the S&P 500 as a whole. Plus, we believe certain sectors that aren't represented in the mega-cap stocks — such as banking and real estate — could be big beneficiaries if the U.S. avoids a recession while interest rates fall.\n\nThere’s a solid argument to be made that the S&P 493 — or at least the equal-weight version of the S&P 500 — is a better indicator of how well the U.S. stock market as a whole is performing compared to the headline S&P 500 you see on the financial news. And if this is the case, one might conclude that the stock market isn’t doing quite as well as the 25% S&P 500 gain in 2023 might indicate.\n\nOf course, nobody has a crystal ball that can predict stock market returns. All investment involves risk and may lose money. But as a group, the “Mediocre 493” is more attractively valued than the Magnificent 7. In fact, as of mid-October, the price-to-earnings ratio of the Magnificent 7 was about 45, while the other 493 companies had a P/E of just 19. So, they could certainly have more to gain from an economic soft landing.\n\nCan I invest in just the other 493 S&P components?\n\nUnfortunately, there aren’t any major index funds that track the other 493 S&P 500 components, but a good alternative could be to invest in an equal weight S&P 500 index fund, of which a few do exist. This way, some of your returns are still dependent on the Magnificent 7, but they’ll make up just 1.6% of your performance, not 30%.\n\nThe bottom line is that the largest companies in the market have been fueling its performance, especially in 2023. But there's reason to believe that could change in 2024."
