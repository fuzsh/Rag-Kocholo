        "text": "For the total return table above, since inception returns are cumulative for funds less than one year old; otherwise, returns are annualized. Market returns are based on the composite closing price and do not represent the returns you would receive if you traded shares at other times. The listing date is typically one or more days after the fund inception date. Therefore, NAV is used to calculate market returns prior to the listing date.\n\nThe expense ratio for certain funds includes a contractual fee waiver that results in a lower net expense ratio for some or all periods shown. For information about this ETF’s fees, please see above.\n\nHoldings are subject to change. ProShares may invest in financial instruments (including derivatives) that, in combination, should have daily price return characteristics similar to the fund's benchmark.\n\nRegistered Investment Companies are required by the IRS to distribute substantially all of their income and capital gains to shareholders at least annually. For specific tax advice, we recommend you speak with a qualified tax professional.\n\nThe performance quoted represents past performance and does not guarantee future results. Investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that an investor's shares, when sold or redeemed, may be worth more or less than the original cost. Shares are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the fund. Market price returns are based upon the midpoint of the bid/ask spread at 4:00 p.m. ET (when NAV is normally determined for most funds) and do not represent the returns you would receive if you traded shares at other times. Your brokerage commissions will reduce returns. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. For standardized returns and performance data current to the most recent month end, see above.\n\nIndex information does not reflect any management fees, transaction costs or expenses. Indexes are unmanaged, and one cannot invest directly in an index.\n\nThere is no guarantee that capital gain distributions will not be made in the future. There is no guarantee that dividends or interest income will be paid.\n\nThere is no guarantee any ProShares ETF will achieve its investment objective.\n\nShares of any ETF are generally bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the fund. Your brokerage commissions will reduce returns.\n\nThis fund is exposed to the stocks of large-cap companies, which tend to go through cycles of outperformance or underperformance lasting up to several years relative to other segments of the stock market. As a result, large-cap returns may trail the returns of the overall stock market or other market segments.\n\nCarefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of ProShares before investing. This and other information can be found in their summary and full prospectuses.
