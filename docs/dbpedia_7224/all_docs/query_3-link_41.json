Securities listed are not meant to represent any current or future holding of an Amundi US portfolio, and should not be considered recommendations to buy or sell any security. Please see Terms and Indices below for more information. Data based on past performance, which is no guarantee of future results.\n\nWe believe extreme market concentration is unlikely to be sustained; active managers who select stocks based on fundamentals may benefit as concentration unwinds.\n\nOver 90% of the year-to-date return of the S&P 500 Index through September has come from the 10 stocks with the highest weightings in the Index. There is no other calendar year of positive returns for the index going back to 1990 where concentration was as high.\n\nThe result is that the S&P 500 Index is now at one of its highest levels, with the top 10 stocks alone representing almost 32% of the Index1. Moreover, the 10 largest stocks trade approximately at an average 32% premium to the S&P 500 Index as measured by forward price-to-earnings estimates. While these are large, highly profitable companies, can they continue to lead the equity markets given their lofty valuations?\n\nLooking back over past 30+ years, periods in which there have been sharp increases in market concentration have often been followed by sharp reversal in concentration of the Index, as seen in the chart above.\n\nWhile some may argue that this time may be different given the dominance of the top 10 in their respective markets, we believe market concentration may decline at some point, and those invested in large cap index portfolios could underperform active managers who choose to balance their exposure to the top 10 stocks with stocks more compellingly valued.\n\n1Source: Bloomberg, 9/30/2023.\n\nTerms and Indices\n\nForward price-earnings ratio: The current price of a stock divided by the consensus analyst estimates of 1-year projections of its earnings per share.\n\nS&P 500: The S&P 500 broad measure of large-cap US equities and serves as the foundation for a wide range of investment products.\n\nPrice/Earnings ratio (P/E): A valuation measure of expensiveness using a stock’s price divided by its per-share earnings\n\nIndices are unmanaged and their returns assume reinvestment of dividends and do not reflect any fees or expenses.
