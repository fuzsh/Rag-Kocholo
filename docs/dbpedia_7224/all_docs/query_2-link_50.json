        "text": "Scott Bauer\n\n▬\n\nJune 21, 2022\n\nThe VIX® Index is a financial benchmark designed to be an up-to-the minute market estimate of expected volatility in the S&P 500 Index and is calculated by using the midpoint of real-time S&P 500® Index (SPX) option bid/ask quotes. The VIX Index generally tends to have an inverse relationship with the S&P 500 Index and historically when the S&P 500 Index declines the VIX Index generally tends to increase. Simply put, the VIX Index tells us the level of expected volatility of the S&P 500 Index for the next 30 days, with a 68% confidence level, or a one standard deviation of the normal probability curve.\n\nAlthough the VIX Index isn’t expressed as a percentage, it can be understood as one. For example, if the VIX Index is at 28, this represents an expected annualized change with a 68% probability of less than 28% in the S&P 500 Index, in either direction. With the S&P 500 Index trading at 3,900 (as of June 10th), this correlated into a projected range of 2,808 – 4,992 over the next year. Calculating potential movement in the S&P 500 Index using the VIX Index on a shorter basis is a bit more complicated. The expected volatility for a single month can be calculated from this figure by dividing the VIX Index level of 28 not by 12 (since there are 12 months in a year), but by the square root of 12 (approximately 3.46). This would imply a move of 8.09% over the next month or a range of approximately 3,585 – 4,215 during that time frame. Similarly, expected volatility for a week would be 28 divided by the square root of 52 or 7.21. This implies a move of 3.88% over the next week or a range of approximately 3,749 – 4,051. (Source: Six Figure Investing)\n\nSince the VIX Index uses calendar day annualization (365 days) rather than many historical/realized volatility measurements which use trading day annualization (252 days), the daily expected volatility is calculated by taking the current VIX Index level divided by the square root of 365. With the VIX Index at 28, the daily expected volatility is 28 divided by 19.1. This implies a daily move of approximately 1.46%. As mentioned above, while the VIX Index generally tends to move in the opposite direction of the S&P 500 Index, this relationship is not always maintained. In fact, about 20% of the time, the VIX Index and S&P 500 Index move in the same direction. (Source: macroption)\n\nUsing data from Barchart I created a comparison of the daily move in the S&P 500 Index (close to close) to the VIX Index, from January 3 – June 10 of this year. The average daily move in absolute terms in the S&P 500 Index during this time was approximately 1.24% which correlates to a VIX Index level of slightly lower than 24. (24/19.1). The average daily reading for the VIX Index during the same period was 26.04.\n\nS&P 500 Index vs. VIX Index Implied Move\n\nSource: Barchart\n\nIn summary, the comparison between the VIX Index and movement in the S&P 500 Index is close, about an 80% correlation, which confirms the reality of the two generally tending to move in opposite directions most of the time. In addition, the correlation generally tends to remain relatively stable throughout different market conditions.

Before engaging in any transactions in those products, it is important for market participants to carefully review the disclosures and disclaimers below.\n\nGeneral\n\nThe information provided is for general education and information purposes only. No statement provided should be construed as a recommendation to buy or sell a security, future, financial instrument, investment fund, or other investment product (collectively, a “financial product”), or to provide investment advice.\n\nIn particular, the inclusion of a security or other instrument within an index is not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold that security or any other instrument, nor should it be considered investment advice.\n\nOptions\n\nOptions involve risk and are not suitable for all market participants. Prior to buying or selling an option, a person should review the Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options (ODD) , which is required to be provided to all such persons. Copies of the ODD are available from your broker or from The Options Clearing Corporation, 125 S. Franklin Street, Suite 1200, Chicago, IL 60606.\n\nTrading FLEX options may not be suitable for all options-qualified market participants. FLEX options strategies only should be considered by those with extensive prior options trading experience.\n\nUncovered option writing is suitable only for the knowledgeable market participant who understands the risks, has the financial capacity and willingness to incur potentially substantial losses, and has sufficient liquid assets to meet applicable margin requirements. In this regard, if the value of the underlying instrument moves against an uncovered writer's options position, the writer may incur large losses in that options position and the participant’s broker may require significant additional margin payments. If a market participant does not make those margin payments, the broker may liquidate positions in the market participant’s account with little or no prior notice in accordance with the market participant’s margin agreement.\n\nFutures\n\nFutures trading is not suitable for all market participants and involves the risk of loss, which can be substantial and can exceed the amount of money deposited for a futures position. You should, therefore, carefully consider whether futures trading is suitable for you in light of your circumstances and financial resources. You should put at risk only funds that you can afford to lose without affecting your lifestyle.\n\nFor additional information regarding the risks associated with trading futures and security futures, see respectively the Risk Disclosure Statement set forth in Appendix A to CFTC Regulation 1.55(c) and the Risk Disclosure Statement for Security Futures Contracts.\n\nVIX® Index and VIX® Index Products\n\nThe Cboe Volatility Index® (known as the VIX Index) is calculated and administered by Cboe Global Indices, LLC. The VIX Index is a financial benchmark designed to be a market estimate of expected volatility of the S&P 500® Index, and is calculated using the midpoint of quotes of certain S&P 500 Index options as further described in the methodology, rules and other information here .\n\nVIX futures and Mini VIX futures, traded on Cboe Futures Exchange, LLC, and VIX options, traded on Cboe Options Exchange, Inc. (collectively, “VIX® Index Products”), are based on the VIX Index. VIX Index Products are complicated financial products only suitable for sophisticated market participants.\n\nTransacting in VIX Index Products involves the risk of loss, which can be substantial and can exceed the amount of money deposited for a VIX Index Product position (except when buying options on VIX Index Products, in which case the potential loss is limited to the purchase price of the options).\n\nMarket participants should put at risk only funds that they can afford to lose without affecting their lifestyles.\n\nBefore transacting in VIX Index Products, market participants should fully inform themselves about the VIX Index and the characteristics and risks of VIX Index Products, including those described here. Market participants also should make sure they understand the product specifications for VIX Index Products ( VIX futures , Mini VIX futures and VIX options ) and the methodologies for calculating the underlying VIX Index and the settlement values for VIX Index Products. Answers to questions frequently asked about VIX Index products and how they are settled is available here .\n\nNot Buy and Hold Investment: VIX Index Products are not suitable to buy and hold because:\n\nOn their settlement date, VIX Index Products convert into a right to receive or an obligation to pay cash.\n\nThe VIX Index generally tends to revert to or near its long-term average, rather than increase or decrease over the long term.\n\nVolatility: The VIX Index is subject to greater percentage swings in a short period of time than is typical for stocks or stock indices, including the S&P 500 Index.\n\nExpected Relationships: Expected relationships with other financial indicators or financial products may not hold. In particular:\n\nAlthough the VIX Index generally tends to be negatively correlated with the S&P 500 Index – such that one tends to move upward when the other moves downward and vice versa – that relationship is not always maintained.\n\nThe prices for the nearest expiration of a VIX Index Product generally tend to move in relationship with movements in the VIX Index. However, this relationship may be undercut, depending on, for example, the amount of time to expiration for the VIX Index Product and on supply and demand in the market for that product.\n\nMini VIX futures contracts trade separately from regular-sized VIX futures, so the prices and quotations for Mini VIX futures and regular-sized VIX futures may differ because of, for example, possible differences in the liquidity of those markets.\n\nFinal settlement Value: The method for calculating the final settlement value of a VIX Index Product is different from the method for calculating the VIX Index at times other than settlement, so there can be a divergence between the final settlement value of a VIX Index Product and the VIX Index value immediately before or after settlement. (See the SOQ Auction Information section here for additional information.)\n\nExchange Traded Products (\"ETPs\")\n\nCboe does not endorse or sell any ETP or other financial product, including those investment products that are or may be based on a Cboe index or methodology or on a non-Cboe index that is based on investment products trading on a Cboe Company exchange (e.g., VIX futures); and Cboe makes no representations regarding the advisability of investing in such products. An investor should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses of these products carefully before investing. Investors also should carefully review the information provided in the prospectuses for these products.\n\nInvestments in ETPs involve risk, including the possible loss of principal, and are not appropriate for all investors. Non-traditional ETPs, including leveraged and inverse ETPs, pose additional risks and can result in magnified gains or losses in an investment. Specific risks relating to investment in an ETP are outlined in the fund prospectus and may include concentration risk, correlation risk, counterparty risk, credit risk, market risk, interest rate risk, volatility risk, tracking error risk, among others. Investors should consult with their tax advisors to determine how the profit and loss on any particular investment strategy will be taxed.\n\nCboe Strategy Benchmark Indices\n\nCboe Strategy Benchmark Indices are calculated and administered by Cboe Global Indices, LLC as described in the methodologies, rules and other information available here using information believed to be reliable, including market data from exchanges owned and operated by other Cboe Companies.\n\nStrategy Benchmark Indices are designed to measure the performance of hypothetical portfolios comprised of one or more derivative instruments and other assets used as collateral. Past performance is not indicative of future results. Strategy Benchmark Indices are not financial products that can be invested in directly, but can be used as the basis for financial products or managing portfolios.\n\nThe actual performance of financial products such as mutual funds or managed accounts can differ significantly from the performance of the underlying index due to execution timing, market disruptions, lack of liquidity, brokerage expenses, transaction costs, tax consequences and other considerations that may not be applicable to the subject index. Index and Benchmark Values Prior to Launch Date\n\nIndex and benchmark values for the period prior to an index’s launch date are calculated by a theoretical approach involving back-testing historical data in accordance with the methodology in place on the launch date (unless otherwise stated). A limitation of back-testing is that it reflects the theoretical application of the index or benchmark methodology and selection of the index’s constituents in hindsight. Back-testing may not result in performance commensurate with prospective application of a methodology, especially during periods of high economic stress in which adjustments might be made. No back-tested approach can completely account for the impact of decisions that might have been made if calculations were made at the same time as the underlying market conditions occurred. There are numerous factors related to markets that cannot be, and have not been, accounted for in the preparation of back-tested index and benchmark information.\n\nTaxes\n\nNo Cboe Company is an investment adviser or tax advisor, and no representation is made regarding the advisability or tax consequences of investing in, holding or selling any financial product. A decision to invest in, hold or sell any financial product should not be made in reliance on any of the statements or information provided. Market participants are advised to make an investment in, hold or sell any financial product only after carefully considering the associated risks and tax consequences, including information detailed in any offering memorandum or similar document prepared by or on behalf of the issuer of the financial product, with the advice of a qualified professional investment adviser and tax advisor.\n\nUnder section 1256 of the Tax Code, profit and loss on transactions in certain exchange-traded options and futures are entitled to be taxed at a rate equal to 60% long-term and 40% short-term capital gain or loss, provided that the market participants involved and the strategy employed satisfy the criteria of the Tax Code. Market participants should consult with their tax advisors to determine how the profit and loss on any particular option or futures strategy will be taxed. Tax laws and regulations change from time to time and may be subject to varying interpretations.\n\nGeneral\n\nPast performance of an index or financial product is not indicative of future results.\n\nBrokerage firms may require customers to post higher margins than any minimum margins specified.\n\nNo data, values or other content contained in this document (including without limitation, index values or information, ratings, credit-related analyses and data, research, valuations, strategies, methodologies and models) or any part thereof may be modified, reverse-engineered, reproduced or distributed in any form or by any means, or stored in a database or retrieval system, without the prior written permission of Cboe.\n\nCboe does not guarantee the accuracy, completeness, or timeliness of the information provided.
