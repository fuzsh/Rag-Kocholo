        "text": "This page provides details for the Index you are viewing. At the top, you'll find a histogram containing today's high and low price. The histogram shows where the open and last price fall within that range. Below is a histogram showing the 52-week high and low. A chart also shows you today's activity.\n\nScreen\n\nAvailable only with a Barchart Plus or Premier Membership, you can base a Stock Screener off the symbols currently on the page. This lets you add additional filters to further narrow down the list of candidates.\n\nExample:\n\nClick \"Screen\" on the page and the Stock Screener opens, pulling in the symbols from the Components page.\n\nAdd additional criteria in the Screener, such as \"20-Day Moving Average is greater than the Last Price\", or \"Trend SeekerÂ® Opinion is Buy\".\n\nView the results and save them to a Watchlist, or save the Screener to run again at a later date.\n\nRunning a Saved Screener at a later date will always present a new list of results. Your Saved Screener will always start with the most current set of symbols found on the Components page before applying your custom filters and displaying new results.\n\nPercentage of Stocks Above Moving Average\n\nFor the major indices on the site, this widget shows the percentage of stocks contained in the index that are above their 20-Day, 50-Day, 100-Day, 150-Day, and 200-Day Moving Averages.\n\nIn theory, the direction of the moving average (higher, lower or flat) indicates the trend of the market. Its slope indicates the strength of the trend. Longer averages are used to identify longer-term trends. Shorter averages are used to identify shorter-term trends. Many trading systems utilize moving averages as independent variables and market analysts frequently use moving averages to confirm technical breakouts.\n\nWhen prices are rising they are usually above the average. This is to be expected since the average includes data from the previous, lower priced days. As long as prices remain above the average there is strength in the market.\n\nComponents Table\n\nThe components table shows you the stocks that comprise the index.\n\nBarchart Data Table\n\nData tables on Barchart follow a familiar format to view and access extensive information for the symbols in the table.\n\nSort\n\nPages are initially sorted in a specific order (depending on the data presented). You can re-sort the page by clicking on any of the column headings in the table.\n\nViews\n\nMost data tables contain multiple standard \"Views\", and each View contains \"Links\" to each symbol's Quote Overview, Chart, Barchart Opinion, and Technical Analysis page. A View simply presents the same symbols with different columns. Site members can also display the data using any Custom View. (Simply create a free account, log in, then create and save Custom Views to be used on any data table.) Standard Views on the Index page include:\n\nMain View: Symbol, Name, Last Price, Change, Percent Change, High, Low, and Time of Last Trade.\n\nTechnical View: Symbol, Name, Last Price, Today's Opinion, 20-Day Relative Strength, 20-Day Historic Volatility, 20-Day Average Volume, 52-Week High and 52-Week Low.\n\nPerformance View: Symbol, Name, Last Price, Weighted Alpha, YTD Percent Change, 1-Month, 3-Month and 1-Year Percent Change.\n\nMoving Averages View: Symbol, Name, Last Price, 20-Day Moving Average, % From 20-Day Moving Average, 50-Day Moving Average, % From 50-Day Moving Average, 100-Day Moving Average, % From 100-Day Moving Average, 200-Day Moving Average, % From 200-Day Moving Average.\n\nFundamental View: Available only on equity pages, shows Symbol, Name, Market Cap, P/E Ratio (trailing 12 months). Earnings Per Share (trailing 12 months), Net Income, Beta, Annual Dividend, Dividend Yield, and Latest Earnings Date.\n\nNote: For all markets except U.S. equities, fundamental data is not licensed for downloading. Your .csv file will show \"N/L\" for \"not licensed\" when downloading from a Canadian, UK, Australian, or European stocks page.\n\nMini-Chart View: Available for Barchart Plus and Premier Members, this view displays 12 small charts per page for the symbols shown in the data table. You may change the bar type and time frame for the Mini-Charts as you scroll through the page. The default settings for Mini-Charts are found in your Site Preferences, under \"Overview Charts\".\n\nPerformance Chart View: This specialized view, available only with a Barchart Plus or Premier Membership, ranks the top and bottom symbols in your watchlist for the time frame chosen (the view defaults to a 5-Day Performance view, with additional choices of Today's performance, 1-Month, 3-Month, 6-Month, 52-Week, and Year-to-Date.) This view will rank a maximum 25 symbols for both top and bottom performance. Equity option symbols are only shown on the \"Today's\" Performance Chart View.\n\nPre-Post Market Data: Available for Barchart Plus and Premier Members, this view will show any pre- or post-market price activity for U.S. equities only.\n\nView Symbol More Data (+)\n\nUnique to Barchart.com, data tables contain an option that allows you to see more data for the symbol without leaving the page. Click the \"+\" icon in the first column (on the left) to view more data for the selected symbol. Scroll through widgets of the different content available for the symbol. Click on any of the widgets to go to the full page. The \"More Data\" widgets are also available from the Links column of the right side of the data table.\n\nHorizontal Scroll on Wide Tables\n\nEspecially when using a custom view, you may find that the number of columns chosen exceeds the available space to show all the data. In this case, the table must be horizontally scrolled (left to right) to view all of the information. To do this, you can either scroll to the bottom of the table and use the table's scrollbar, or you can scroll the table using your browser's built-in scroll:\n\nLeft-click with your mouse anywhere on the table.\n\nUse your keyboard's left and right arrows to scroll the table.\n\nRepeat this anywhere as you move through the table to enable horizontal scrolling.\n\nFlipcharts\n\nAlso unique to Barchart, this feature allows you to scroll through all the symbols on the table in a chart view. FlipCharts are a ctool available to Site Members.\n\nDownload\n\nDownload is a free tool available to Site Members. This tool will download a .csv file for the View being displayed. For dynamically-generated tables (such as a Stock or ETF Screener) where you see more than 1000 rows of data, the download will be limited to only the first 1000 records on the table. For other static pages (such as the Russell 3000 Components list) all rows will be downloaded.\n\nFree members are limited to 1 site download per day. Barchart Plus Members have 10 downloads per day, while Barchart Premier Members may download up to 100 .csv files per day."
