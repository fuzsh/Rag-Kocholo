        "text": "An investor should carefully consider a Fund’s investment objective, risks, charges, and expenses before investing. A Fund’s prospectus and summary prospectus contain this and other information about the Direxion Shares. To obtain a Fund’s prospectus and summary prospectus call 866-476-7523 or visit our website at direxion.com. A Fund’s prospectus and summary prospectus should be read carefully before investing.\n\nCUSIP Identifiers have been provided by CUSIP Global Services, managed on behalf of the American Bankers Association by Standard and Poor’s Financial Services, LLC, and are not for use or dissemination in any manner that would serve as a substitute for a CUSIP service. The CUSIP Database, ©2011 American Bankers Association. “CUSIP” is a registered trademark of the American Bankers Association.\n\nShares of the Direxion Shares are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from a Fund. Market Price returns are based upon the midpoint of the bid/ask spread at 4:00 pm EST (when NAV is normally calculated) and do not represent the returns you would receive if you traded shares at other times. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns. Fund returns assume that dividends and capital gains distributions have been reinvested in the Fund at NAV. Some performance results reflect expense reimbursements or recoupments and fee waivers in effect during certain periods shown. Absent these reimbursements or recoupments and fee waivers, results would have been less favorable.\n\nThe Funds have derived all disclosures contained in this document regarding Apple Inc. from publicly available documents. In connection with the offering of each Fund’s securities, neither the Funds, the Trust, nor the Adviser or any of its respective affiliates has participated in the preparation of such documents. Neither the Funds, the Trust nor the Adviser or any of its respective affiliates makes any representation that such publicly available documents or any other publicly available information regarding Apple Inc. is accurate or complete. Furthermore, the Funds cannot give any assurance that all events occurring prior to the date hereof (including events that would affect the accuracy or completeness of the publicly available documents described above) that would affect the trading price of Apple Inc. have been publicly disclosed. Subsequent disclosure of any such events or the disclosure of or failure to disclose material future events concerning Apple Inc. could affect the value of a Fund’s investments with respect to Apple Inc. and therefore the value of the Funds.\n\nDirexion Shares Risks – An investment in a Fund involves risk, including the possible loss of principal. Each Fund is non-diversified and includes risks associated with a Fund concentrating its investments in a particular security, industry, sector, or geographic region which can result in increased volatility. A Fund’s investments in derivatives such as futures contracts and swaps may pose risks in addition to, and greater than, those associated with directly investing in securities or other investments, including imperfect correlations with underlying investments or the Fund’s other portfolio holdings, higher price volatility and lack of availability. As a result, the value of an investment in a Fund may change quickly and without warning.\n\nLeverage Risk – The Bull Fund obtains investment exposure in excess of its net assets by utilizing leverage and may lose more money in market conditions that are adverse to its investment objective than a fund that does not utilize leverage. A total loss may occur in a single day. Leverage will also have the effect of magnifying any differences in the Fund’s correlation with AAPL and may increase the volatility of the Bull Fund.\n\nDaily Correlation Risk – A number of factors may affect the Bull Fund’s ability to achieve a high degree of correlation with AAPL and therefore achieve its daily leveraged investment objective. The Bull Fund’s exposure to AAPL is impacted by AAPL’s movement. Because of this, it is unlikely that the Bull Fund will be perfectly exposed to AAPL at the end of each day. The possibility of the Bull Fund being materially over- or under-exposed to AAPL increases on days when AAPL is volatile near the close of the trading day.\n\nDaily Inverse Correlation Risk – A number of factors may affect the Bear Fund’s ability to achieve a high degree of inverse correlation with AAPL and therefore achieve its daily inverse investment objective. The Bear Fund’s exposure to AAPL is impacted by AAPL’s movement. Because of this, it is unlikely that the Bear Fund will be perfectly exposed to AAPL at the end of each day. The possibility of the Bear Fund being materially over- or under-exposed to AAPL increases on days when AAPL is volatile near the close of the trading day.\n\nTechnology Sector Risk — The market prices of technology-related securities tend to exhibit a greater degree of market risk and sharp price fluctuations than other types of securities. These securities may fall in and out of favor with investors rapidly, which may cause sudden selling and dramatically lower market prices.\n\nApple Inc. Investing Risk — In addition to the risks associated with companies in the technology sector, Apple Inc. faces risks related to market conditions, market disruptions, competition, managing the frequent introductions and transitions of products and services; as well as the outsourced manufacturing and logistical services provided by partners. Issuer-specific attributes may cause an investment held by a Fund to be more volatile than the market generally. The value of an individual security or particular type of security may be more volatile than the market as a whole and may perform differently from the value of the market as a whole.\n\nAdditional risks of each Fund include Effects of Compounding and Market Volatility Risk, Derivatives Risk, Counterparty Risk, Rebalancing Risk, Intra-Day Investment Risk, Industry Concentration Risk, Market Risk, Indirect Investment Risk, and Cash Transaction Risk. Additionally, for the Direxion Daily AAPL Bear 1X Shares, Shorting or Inverse Risk. Please see the summary and full prospectuses for a more complete description of these and other risks of a Fund.\n\nHong Kong Investors – This website and the investment products referenced herein (“Website”) are directed to persons who are “Professional Investors” within the meaning of the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Ordinance (Cap. 571) (“Ordinance”).
