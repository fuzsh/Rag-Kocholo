        "text": "The S&P 500, or Standard & Poor's 500 Index, was created by S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC in 1957. Its constituent stocks include 500 large-cap stocks in the United States. The S&P 500, the Dow Jones, and the Nasdaq are the three key US stock market indices.\n\nThe S&P 500 covers about 80% of US stock capitalisation and is followed by many investors as a stock index determining the stock market's direction.\n\nIt showed an upward trend for about 13 years, from 2009 to 2021. The upward trend gradually slowed in 2022 and entered a market correction situation. As of the end of 2023, the S&P 500 posted a total return of about ~24% for the year, well above its average annual return of around 10%. Technology, communication services, and consumer discretionary stocks have notched big rebounds in 2023.\n\nIt shows that the US economy has grown dramatically since the Lehman Brothers collapse in 2008 and the COVID-19 crisis in 2020. In this context, investment trusts, ETFs, CFDs, and other investment products closely related to the evolution of the S&P 500 have attracted attention. This article will examine the features and investment methods of the S&P 500 in detail.\n\nThe S&P 500 is calculated using a capitalisation-weighted index.\n\nThe capitalisation-weighted average is calculated by dividing the total capitalisation of each stock by the total capitalisation on the base date.\n\nIn simple terms, it is a method of calculating the growth multiplier by comparing past capitalisation with current capitalisation. The benefit of using the capitalisation-weighted average is that it is less affected by value stocks (companies with high stock prices) and more by companies with high capitalisation (large-caps).\n\nDifferences between value stocks and high-capitalisation (large-cap) companies\n\nA value stock refers to a company with a high stock price. A high-capitalization company (large-cap) is a company with a high stock price and a large number of stocks. If the number of stocks increases, the capitalisation increases.\n\nIn addition to the S&P 500, many stock indexes, such as the Nasdaq Composite Index and TOPIX, use capitalisation-weighted averages. The capitalisation-weighted average possesses a drawback as it is disproportionately influenced by companies with higher market capitalisation. This tendency can result in a disproportionate impact on the index due to the dominance of a few large-cap stocks. To address this limitation, alternative weighting methods such as equal-weighted or fundamentally-weighted indices are employed to mitigate the aforementioned issue.\n\nAs of December 2023, the top companies are Apple and Microsoft. If either one of the two underperforms, it could affect the performance of the S&P 500. As companies with high capitalisation easily influence the index, it cannot reflect the overall market, which is another disadvantage. Letâ€™s look at the components of the S&P 500.\n\nThe interest rate stood at 4.5% in December 2022. The Fed fund rate at November 2023 stands at 5.5%. With the rise of the CPI, US officials continued to hike interest rates to control price rises. Price corrections in the market are also being observed. In October, the US Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers was unchanged, seasonally adjusted, and rose 3.2 percent over the last 12 months, not seasonally adjusted. The index for all items less food and energy increased 0.2 percent in October (SA); up 4.0 percent over the year (NSA).\n\nThe market is at this moment expecting the rates to be held steady for some time to come but does not expect a rate cut anytime soon.\n\nThe gray sections indicate periods of recession. Once the EPS falls, the S&P 500 will fall as well. Entering a recession represents a more significant decline. The definition of what a recession is varies from country to country. (The US Department of Commerce uses the NBER (National Institute of Economic Research) economic criteria).\n\nThe NBERâ€™s definition of a recession is as follows:\n\nDownturn in economic activity\n\nThe decline has continued over several months\n\nThe GDP has fallen\n\nThe following chart shows the change in the US GDP over the past few quarters.\n\nFor the period January-March 2022, it was down 1.6%, and for the period April-June 2022, the GDP fell 0.6%, showing negative growth for two consecutive quarters. As a result, the United States was considered to be in a technical recession at that time. The economy has shown resilience ever since, and the Bureau of Economic Analysis, an agency embedded in the U.S. Department of Commerce, estimates that as of the third quarter of 2023, the economy grew at an annual rate of 4.9%.\n\nThe Dow Jones (Dow Jones Industrial Average) is an index of stock prices created and released by Dow Jones (today the S&P Dow Jones Industrial Average). It has been published since 1896 and is the oldest index in the United States. The Dow is based on the average price of 30 typical stocks listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and NASDAQ.\n\nWhat is the Dow stock price?\n\nIt is a method of calculating the average stock price developed by Dow Jones.\n\nIt can be calculated by â€˜total stock price of components Ã· number of components Ã· divisor.â€™\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average features the need to correct the divisor in case of any change in the components.\n\nIn this way, the index remains consistent.\n\nThe following table shows the difference between the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones.\n\nThe biggest difference is in how it is calculated.\n\nThe Dow is calculated using the average stock price method, which is characterized by its vulnerability to value stocks.\n\nMany investors follow this stock index, as with the S&P 500, to monitor the direction of the US market. The following chart compares the performance of the S&P 500 with the Dow Jones over about 2 decades, from 2003 to 2022.\n\nThe Nasdaq is the stock market operated by the National Association of Securities Traders.\n\nIt focuses on high-tech and IT-related companies and is the largest in the world's stock market of emerging enterprises (venture capital companies).\n\nThe Nasdaq market has two indexes:\n\nNasdaq Composite\n\nNASDAQ 100\n\nThe Nasdaq in detail:\n\nThe Nasdaq Composite is based on the capitalisation-weighted average of more than 3,000 stocks listed on the Nasdaq exchange. Its components are mainly Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, and other hi-tech and IT-related companies. It helps understand the trends in the hi-tech sector.\n\nThe NASDAQ 100 index is based on the capitalization-weighted average of the top 100 stocks listed on the Nasdaq. It focuses on the hi-tech sector, and its components do not include stocks from the financial sector.\n\nCompared to the Nasdaq Composite, it can better identify the trends related to hi-tech and IT. However, changes in the hi-tech sector significantly impact the performance of the NASDAQ 100. The following table shows the differences between the Nasdaq, the Nasdaq Composite Index, and the NASDAQ 100 .\n\nThe Russell Index is an index of small-cap stocks calculated and released by Russell Investments, a US advisory firm.\n\nThe Russell 2000 is calculated based on the capitalization-weighted average adjusted for floating stock prices for the top 1001-3000 stocks listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and Nasdaq (other indexes include the Russell 1000 and Russell 3000).\n\nIt targets small-cap stocks in the United States and is used as a benchmark by many small-cap funds.\n\nThe Russell 2000 is focused on small-cap stocks and is sensitive to economic trends.\n\nIt is also the â€˜leading indicator of a sharp decline.â€™ The Russell 2000 often falls earlier than large companies when the US economy deteriorates.\n\nSo, let's compare the performance of the S&P 500 with the Russell 2000.\n\nCFD stands for \"Contracts for Difference.\"\n\nCFDS can be traded in either long or short positions on stock indexes, forex, precious metals, commodities, and other products with margin without holding assets.\n\nThere are four key advantages to trading CFDs on the S&P 500.\n\nLeverage is available for trading\n\nMost products can be traded 24 hours a day (may vary depending on the stock)\n\nYou can buy/sell CFDs in real-time\n\nCFDs can be a risk hedge for investment trusts and ETFs\n\nWhile individual stocks may have different schedules, most CFD trading is available 24 hours daily. Even busy users can trade easily.\n\nWith highly leveraged CFDs, you can trade with a small amount of funds, which is much more effective than trading ETFs.\n\nHowever, highly leveraged trades carry the risk of significant losses, so monitoring risks in a market where traders cannot accurately predict future price movements is crucial.\n\nNow let's examine the disadvantages.\n\nThere are four disadvantages to investing in the S&P 500 through CFDs.\n\nYou will not receive dividends\n\nYou will pay funding charges (overnight interest)\n\nSpreads will be charged\n\nThere is a risk of margin closeout (mandatory liquidation) when certain losses occur\n\nCFD trading involves funding charges.\n\nAlso known as â€˜overnight interest,â€™ it is paid if a position is held from one day to the next.\n\nIn the case of holding long positions, the accumulated funding charges may result in lower returns.\n\nTo start trading CFDs on the S&P 500, choose OANDA.
