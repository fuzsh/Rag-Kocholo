        "text": "The fund seeks to match the total return of the Standard & Poor's 500 Composite Stock Price Index (the 'Index'). To pursue its goal, the fund normally invests at least 95% of its assets in common stocks included in the Index.\n\nThe fund attempts to have a correlation between its performance and that of the S&P 500 Index of at least .95, before expenses. A correlation of 1.00 would mean that the fund and the S&P 500 Index were perfectly correlated.\n\nAlpha - Alpha is a measure of a security's or portfolio's excess return.\n\nBeta - Beta is a measure of a security’s or portfolio’s volatility, or systematic risk.\n\nR-Squared - R-squared is a statistical measure that represents the percentage of a fund’s or security’s movements that are explained by movements in a benchmark index.\n\nSharpe Ratio - Sharpe ratio is a risk-adjusted measure that measures reward per unit of risk. The higher the Sharpe ratio, the better.\n\nStandard Deviation - Standard deviation is a statistical measure of the degree to which an individual portfolio return tends to vary from the mean, based on the entire population. The greater the degree of dispersion, the greater the degree of risk. In mutual funds, the standard deviation tells us how much the return on the fund is deviating from the expected normal returns."
