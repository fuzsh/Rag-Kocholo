Share price, principal value, and return will vary, and you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares. Performance assumes reinvestment of distributions. Returns after sales charge for class A shares reflect the current maximum initial sales charges of 5.75% for the Goal-Based and Age-Based options, and the Equity Asset Class options, and 4.00% for the Fixed-Income Asset Class options. Class B share returns reflect the applicable contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC), which is 5% in the first year, declining to 1% in the sixth year, and is eliminated thereafter. Class C shares reflect a 1% CDSC the first year that is eliminated thereafter. Class D shares reflect the current maximum initial sales charges of 3.50%. Class Y shares have no initial sales charge. Class Y shares before their inception are derived from the historical performance of class A shares, which have not been adjusted for the lower expenses; had they, returns would have been higher. The Government Money Market Fund Investment Option does not have an initial sales charge or CDSC. Performance reflects ongoing fees and expenses, including an annualized 0.10% fee charged by the College Savings Plans of Nevada and the Nevada College Savings Trust Fund and the fees and other expenses of the Putnam Mutual Funds in which the plan invests. The funds' expense ratios are taken from the most recent prospectus and are subject to change.\n\nThe Class Y share fee structure is currently only available for investments made by Account Owners investing in the Plan through a UBS commission-based platform.\n\nCurrent performance may be lower or higher than the quoted past performance, which cannot guarantee future results.
