Some of its main products include the iPhone, the Mac line of personal computers and laptops, the iPad, the Apple Watch, and Apple TV. The company also has a fast-growing services business that includes its iCloud cloud service and its digital streaming-content services, such as Apple Music and Apple TV+.\n\nApple was founded in 1976 by Steve Jobs and Stephen Wozniak. The tech giant started out operating from the Jobs' family garage and has since grown into a diversified technology behemoth. Part of Apple's growth strategy has been to purchase small tech companies that it can easily integrate into its expanding line of products. Four years after its founding, on Dec. 12, 1980, Apple went public through an initial public offering (IPO) at $22.00 per share. Its stock trades on the Nasdaq Global Select Market.\n\nOn January 3, 2023, Apple's market cap closed below $2 trillion for the first time since 2020.\n\nApple's headquarters is located in Cupertino, Calif. Tim Cook has been chief executive officer (CEO) since 2011. Apple is classified as a member of the information technology sector. It operates within a number of industries keeping its edge with its product line, including computer hardware and technology, video streaming, and cloud computing.\n\nThe company faces numerous competitors, including smartphone manufacturer Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd. (KRX:005930), computer manufacturer Dell Technologies Inc. (DELL), video streaming company Netflix Inc. (NFLX), and other giant technology firms like Microsoft Corp. (MSFT). Apple posted net income of $57.4 billion on net sales of $274.5 billion in FY 2020, which ended Sept. 26, 2020.\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nApple manufactures smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables, and accessories, and offers digital streaming-content services.\n\nApple's rivals include Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd. (KRX:005930), Dell Technologies Inc. (DELL), Netflix Inc. (NFLX), and Microsoft Corp. (MSFT).\n\nApple earned a net income of $57.4 billion on $274.5 billion of net sales in FY 2020.\n\nA federal judge ruled in September 2021 that Apple must loosen its App Store restrictions to allow developers to provide links to alternative payment systems.\n\nApple's Recent Developments\n\nOn June 10, 2022, Apple's CEO, Tim Cook, sent a letter to the U.S. Senate in support of the American Data Privacy and Protection Act.

Among the issues raised is that Apple's Apple Pay program stifles competitors and innovation.\n\nOn April 28, 2022, Apple released its Q2 FY 2022 financial results.

Both numbers exceeded analysts' expectations.\n\nOn April 27, 2022, Apple announced a that it would begin selling parts, tools, and manuals to help customers make certain repairs to certain iPhone models.\n\nOn Sept. 10, 2021, a U.S. district judge ordered Apple within 90 days to begin letting developers send customers outside Apple's App Store for payments. Apple won an important partial victory, however, because the judge did not find that Apple had a monopoly on the mobile game market. (See details in Q&A below).\n\nApple briefly became the world's first $3 trillion company during intraday trading on Jan. 3, 2022. The iPhone maker also holds the distinction of being the world's first company to reach $1 trillion and $2 trillion.\n\nWhat's Happening with Antitrust Suits Against Apple?\n\nIn addition to antitrust litigation related to its App Store, Apple faces several other antitrust lawsuits, including these below.\n\nOn Oct. 6, 2021, Reuters reported that the European Union (EU) will soon file an antitrust charge against Apple over the company's near-field communication (NFC) chip technology, according to people familiar with the matter. The chip technology allows for tap-and-go payments on iPhones. The charge follows an investigation into Apple Pay launched last year by the EU. The EU looked into whether Apple engaged in anticompetitive behavior by refusing rivals' access to Apple's payment system. The EU's main focus now is the company's NFC chip.\n\nOn April 30, 2021, the European Commission, the EU's antitrust regulator, charged Apple with levying high commission fees in the App Store and prohibiting developers from providing information on alternative ways to use their services.\n\nHas AAPL Ever Split Its Stock?\n\nApple's stock has split five times on the dates below:\n\nAug. 28, 2020: a 4-for-1 stock split.\n\nJune 9, 2014: a 7-for-1 stock split.\n\nFeb. 28, 2005: a 2-for-1 stock split.\n\nJune 21, 2000: a 2-for-1 stock split.\n\nJune 16, 1987: a 2-for-1 stock split.\n\nDoes AAPL Pay a Dividend?\n\nYes.
