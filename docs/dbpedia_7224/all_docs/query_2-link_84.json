        "text": "The Volatility Index or VIX is the annualized implied volatility of a hypothetical S&P 500 stock option with 30 days to expiration. The price of this option is based on the prices of near-term S&P 500 options traded on CBOE.\n\nIt can help investors estimate how much the S&P 500 Index will fluctuate in the next 30 days.\n\nWhile the VIX only measures the volatility of the S&P 500 Index, it has become a benchmark for the U.S. stock market.\n\nThe VIX is often referred to as the market’s “fear index or fear gauge”. The performance of the VIX is inversely related to the S&P 500 – when the price of the VIX goes up, the price of the S&P 500 usually goes down.\n\nIf the VIX is rising, demand for options is increasing, and therefore, becoming more expensive. If the VIX is falling, there's less demand, and options prices tend to fall. One thing to keep in mind is that current volatility cannot be known ahead of time. That's why it's a good idea to use the VIX in tandem with technical and fundamental analysis."
