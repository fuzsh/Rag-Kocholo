        "text": "Yesterday US equity markets closed lower as anxiety built ahead of a big evening of tech earnings. The S&P 500 ended down 0.6% with tech stocks the primary drag as the NYSE FANG+ index fell 1.5%. The anxiety was also visible in options markets with the VIX nearly hitting 18 during the session. Well, after all of the consternation those tech earnings continued a string of solid reports within the sector over the last few weeks though the stock reactions have been mixed. Nvidia, the poster child for the AI trade, has dominated financial media coverage all week and given the rally over the last two years expectations were very high. It was another beat and raise quarter for the company, but the magnitude of the beats and growth are starting to moderate from unsustainable levels. It was hard to find much negative in the report however, the stock traded down nearly 10% after the release but did recover during the call."
