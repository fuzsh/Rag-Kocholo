        "text": "The Standard & Poor's 500 Index, or simply the S&P 500, is a market-capitalization-weighted index of 503 large-cap U.S. stocks. The index accounts for 80% of the market value of the U.S. equities market. Because it reflects nearly all of the largest stocks in the U.S., it is often regarded as synonymous with the market as a whole. It's the closest there is to a default U.S. stock index.\n\nBecause it's weighted by market cap, the largest stocks have a big impact on both the long-term performance and daily movement of the index. The 10 biggest stocks make up 30.9% of the index's market value as of Aug. 31, 2023. This means that investors should familiarize themselves with these 10 giant components to understand what drives the broader market.\n\nBelow is our analysis of the 10 largest components of the S&P 500. Weightings are as of Sept. 22, 2023, and market capitalizations are as of Sept. 25, 2023. The trailing 12-month (TTM) figures for revenue and net income are courtesy of TradingView and are as of June 30, 2023, unless otherwise stated.\n\n1.

He was replaced by Andrew Jassey, who previously served as CEO of Amazon Web Services.\n\n4. NVIDIA (NVDA)\n\nIndex Weighting: 2.84%\n\nMarket Cap: $1.04 trillion\n\nRevenue (Trailing 12-Month) as of July 31, 2023: $32.68 billion\n\nNet Income (Trailing 12-Month) as of July 31, 2023: $10.32 billion\n\nNVIDIA is a company that develops and manufactures Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). GPUs are a type of computer chip used for creating computer graphics, usually for visual design or computer gaming. But GPUs are increasingly in demand for other tasks such as cryptocurrency mining, artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning development. NVIDIA is known for its GeForce brand of consumer GPUs.\n\n5. Alphabet Class A (GOOGL)\n\nIndex Weighting: 2.14%\n\nMarket Cap: $1.66 trillion\n\nRevenue (Trailing 12-Month): $288.14 billion\n\nNet Income (Trailing 12-Month): $60.95 billion\n\nAlphabet is the parent company of search engine giant Google. Besides the Google search engine, Alphabet runs a number of other services, including the video-sharing site YouTube.\n\nIt's notable that the company splits its stock into two main share classes:\n\nThe A shares usually trade for slightly more than the C shares and carry voting rights.\n\nThe C shares are nonvoting shares, meaning they do not entitle the holder to participate in proxy votes.\n\nEach trades on the S&P 500. On their own, they are large enough to make the top 10 list. If counted together, they would place Alphabet third on this list and would make up 3.88% of the index.\n\n6. Tesla (TSLA)\n\nIndex Weighting: 1.87%\n\nMarket Cap: $784 billion\n\nRevenue (Trailing 12-Month): $94.03 billion\n\nNet Income (Trailing 12-Month): $12.23 billion\n\nTesla is primarily a maker of electric cars.

It is made up of 500 of the largest companies in the country. Because of the vast market values of the companies on the S&P 500, the index is considered a gauge of the U.S. economy. Investors who are interested in taking advantage of the returns may want to consider buying shares in an index fund or ETF."
