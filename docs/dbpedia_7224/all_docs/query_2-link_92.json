        "text": "By: Craig Cohen and Madison Faller\n\nQ1 is nearly in the books, and the rally has been pretty astounding.\n\nThe S&P 500 looks set to finish March in the green. That means stocks have now been on a winning streak for five consecutive months.\n\nWhat’s even more impressive is how the rally has evolved on the coattails of last year. This edition of Top Market Takeaways dives into the moves that defined the quarter and breaks down what it all means.\n\n2024 has flipped the script\n\n2023 ended with a bang, with stocks and bonds rallying in tandem thanks to expectations for dramatic Federal Reserve rate cuts. Back in January, the resounding take was for the Fed to stick the “soft landing” by delivering more than 160 basis points of rate cuts. Now, those expectations have been pretty much cut in half. Both we and the Fed now expect just 75 basis points worth of easing, or three cuts, this year.\n\nSimilarly, remember the Magnificent 7? The largest mega-cap stocks accounted for around two-thirds of the S&P 500’s entire gain last year. This year, one of those names is the worst-performing stocks in the S&P 500, and another is down 10%.\n\nGiven all this, you would be forgiven if you thought the market would be down. But… the exact opposite has happened.\n\nThe S&P 500 boasts a 10% gain so far in 2024 – that’s about in line with its historical average for a full year. So, what’s happened and what does it mean?\n\nDo such big gains point to a “bubble”?\n\nWe don’t think so. Let’s break it down.\n\nThe S&P 500 has made over 20 new all-time highs so far this year, rallying well above the 5000 mark. This is especially notable given the Magnificent 7 has lost two of its larger anchors (with Apple and Tesla underperformers this year). That said, two of the biggest stars from last year have continued to support further gains. Nvidia has been the best performing member of the S&P 500 again this year (aside from Super Micro Computer, which was just added to the index recently). After rallying more than 200% last year, the chipmaker is up a further 80% this year.\n\nThese huge gains have led to some talk of a “bubble,” but consider this: Even after the stock’s massive gains, its valuation (proxied by its next-12-months P/E ratio) is still below its five-year average. Its earnings growth has actually outpaced its price gains. Meta is also one of the index’s best performing members.\n\nMoreover, like we saw into the end of last year, there are also lots of stocks in the S&P 500 that are outperforming the index. Building on our note last week 195 names in the S&P 500 now have a better year-to-date (YTD) return than the index’s 10% return. The median market cap of these names is around $50 billion and spans beyond tech. The two best performing sectors in March have been energy and materials – sectors associated with a more cyclical tilt. All that’s to say, the rally is getting broader:\n\nWhat does this mean? It’s not only mega-cap tech that is rallying. We think that opens up opportunities in active management to help achieve strong returns.\n\nSo, what’s been driving the gains?\n\nIn one word: earnings. Although the U.S. economy never fell into a recession, earnings did go through a correction. S&P 500 earnings were contracting for three straight quarters last year. That earnings recession has now ended, with the last two quarters marking a return to profitability. And while it’s true that the Magnificent 7 accounts for around 25% of S&P 500 earnings and drove much of the profit growth last year, we expect that growth to broaden throughout the year. We’re already seeing this take place – a likely key reason why the rally has marched on even with less Fed rate cuts in the cards.\n\nFinally, in addition to posting profits, we’re also seeing other activity that suggests that corporates are feeling more confident. After 2021’s blockbuster year for IPO activity, the last two years were incredibly tough with macro uncertainty high. Now, the market is heating back up: This year has already seen the high-profile IPO of Reddit, and many other private companies have been waiting to go public as well. We expect more to come. The three-month sum of equity capital markets activity is at its highest levels since late 2021, but is still down more than 80% from the peak.\n\nWe don’t think you’ve “missed it”\n\nIt’s important to take a step back: The big gains into year-end helped set the stage for this year. The S&P 500 is up more than 25% since last October’s lows – that’s the strongest 100-day return since September 2020. Gains this large in this short of a period may make a lot of people feel like they’ve missed it.\n\nThe opposite is true. Over the past 50 years, whenever the S&P 500 has rallied at least 25% in a 100-day period (like it has recently), the index was, on average, another 15% higher a year later and positive overall 98% of the time.\n\nDISCLOSURES\n\nThe information presented is not intended to be making value judgments on the preferred outcome of any government decision or political election.\n\nIndex definitions:\n\nStandard and Poor’s 500 Index is a capitalization-weighted index of 500 stocks. The index is designed to measure performance of the broad domestic economy through changes in the aggregate market value of 500 stocks representing all major industries. The index was developed with a base level of 10 for the 1941–43 base period.\n\nBloomberg Global EQ:FI 60:40 Index is designed to measure cross-asset market performance globally. The index rebalances monthly to 60% equities and 40% fixed income. The equities and fixed income are represented by Bloomberg Developed Markets Large & Mid Cap Total Return Index (DMTR) and Bloomberg Global Aggregate Index (LEGATRUU) respectively.\n\nThe Bloomberg Eco Surprise Index shows the degree to which economic analysts under- or over-estimate the trends in the business cycle. The surprise element is defined as the percentage difference between analyst forecasts and the published value of economic data releases.\n\nThe MSCI World Index is a free float-adjusted market capitalization index that is designed to measure global developed market equity performance.\n\nThe NASDAQ 100 Index is a basket of the 100 largest, most actively traded U.S companies listed on the NASDAQ stock exchange. The index includes companies from various industries except for the financial industry, like commercial and investment banks. These non-financial sectors include retail, biotechnology, industrial, technology, health care, and others.\n\nThe Russell 2000 Index measures small company stock market performance. The index does not include fees or expenses.\n\nWe believe the information contained in this material to be reliable but do not warrant its accuracy or completeness.

Please note that all information shown is based on qualitative analysis. Exclusive reliance on the above is not advised. This information is not intended as a recommendation to invest in any particular asset class or strategy or as a promise of future performance. Note that these asset class and strategy assumptions are passive only – they do not consider the impact of active management. References to future returns are not promises or even estimates of actual returns a client portfolio may achieve. Assumptions, opinions and estimates are provided for illustrative purposes only.

The outputs of the assumptions are provided for illustration/discussion purposes only and are subject to significant limitations.\n\n“Expected” or “alpha” return estimates are subject to uncertainty and error. For example, changes in the historical data from which it is estimated will result in different implications for asset class returns. Expected returns for each asset class are conditional on an economic scenario; actual returns in the event the scenario comes to pass could be higher or lower, as they have been in the past, so an investor should not expect to achieve returns similar to the outputs shown herein.

All information presented herein is considered to be accurate at the time of production. This material does not contain sufficient information to support an investment decision and it should not be relied upon by you in evaluating the merits of investing in any securities or products. In addition, users should make an independent assessment of the legal, regulatory, tax, credit and accounting implications and determine, together with their own financial professional, if any investment mentioned herein is believed to be appropriate to their personal goals. Investors should ensure that they obtain all available relevant information before making any investment. It should be noted that investment involves risks, the value of investments and the income from them may fluctuate in accordance with market conditions and taxation agreements and investors may not get back the full amount invested. Both past performance and yield are not a reliable indicator of current and future results\n\nRISK CONSIDERATIONS\n\nPast performance is not indicative of future results. You may not invest directly in an index.\n\nThe price of equity securities may rise or fall due to the changes in the broad market or changes in a company's financial condition, sometimes rapidly or unpredictably. Equity securities are subject to 'stock market risk' meaning that stock prices in general may decline over short or extended periods of time.\n\nInvesting in fixed income products is subject to certain risks, including interest rate, credit, inflation, call, prepayment and reinvestment risk. Any fixed income security sold or redeemed prior to maturity may be subject to substantial gain or loss.\n\nIn general, the bond market is volatile and bond prices rise when interest rates fall and vice versa. Longer term securities are more prone to price fluctuation than shorter term securities. Any fixed income security sold or redeemed prior to maturity may be subject to substantial gain or loss. Dependable income is subject to the credit risk of the issuer of the bond. If an issuer defaults no future income payments will be made.\n\nWhen investing in mutual funds or exchange-traded and index funds, please consider the investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses associated with the funds before investing. You may obtain a fund’s prospectus by contacting your investment professional. The prospectus contains information, which should be carefully read before investing.\n\nInvestors should understand the potential tax liabilities surrounding a municipal bond purchase. Certain municipal bonds are federally taxed if the holder is subject to alternative minimum tax. Capital gains, if any, are federally taxable. The investor should note that the income from tax-free municipal bond funds may be subject to state and local taxation and the alternative minimum tax (amt).\n\nInternational investments may not be suitable for all investors. International investing involves a greater degree of risk and increased volatility. Changes in currency exchange rates and differences in accounting and taxation policies outside the u.s. can raise or lower returns. Some overseas markets may not be as politically and economically stable as the united states and other nations. Investments in international markets can be more volatile.\n\nInvestments in emerging markets may not be suitable for all investors. Emerging markets involve a greater degree of risk and increased volatility. Changes in currency exchange rates and differences in accounting and taxation policies outside the u.s. can raise or lower returns. Some overseas markets may not be as politically and economically stable as the united states and other nations. Investments in emerging markets can be more volatile.\n\nInvestments in commodities may have greater volatility than investments in traditional securities, particularly if the instruments involve leverage. The value of commodity-linked derivative instruments may be affected by changes in overall market movements, commodity index volatility, changes in interest rates, or factors affecting a particular industry or commodity, such as drought, floods, weather, livestock disease, embargoes, tariffs and international economic, political and regulatory developments. Use of leveraged commodity-linked derivatives creates an opportunity for increased return but, at the same time, creates the possibility for greater loss.\n\nReal estate investments trusts may be subject to a high degree of market risk because of concentration in a specific industry, sector or geographical sector. Real estate investments may be subject to risks including, but not limited to, declines in the value of real estate, risks related to general and economic conditions, changes in the value of the underlying property owned by the trust and defaults by borrower.\n\nInvestment in alternative investment strategies is speculative, often involves a greater degree of risk than traditional investments including limited liquidity and limited transparency, among other factors and should only be considered by sophisticated investors with the financial capability to accept the loss of all or part of the assets devoted to such strategies.\n\nStructured products involve derivatives and risks that may not be suitable for all investors. The most common risks include, but are not limited to, risk of adverse or unanticipated market developments, issuer credit quality risk, risk of lack of uniform standard pricing, risk of adverse events involving any underlying reference obligations, risk of high volatility, risk of illiquidity/little to no secondary market, and conflicts of interest. Before investing in a structured product, investors should review the accompanying offering document, prospectus or prospectus supplement to understand the actual terms and key risks associated with the each individual structured product. Any payments on a structured product are subject to the credit risk of the issuer and/or guarantor. Investors may lose their entire investment, i.e., incur an unlimited loss. The risks listed above are not complete. For a more comprehensive list of the risks involved with this particular product, please speak to your J.P. Morgan team.\n\nAs a reminder, hedge funds (or funds of hedge funds) often engage in leveraging and other speculative investment practices that may increase the risk of investment loss. These investments can be highly illiquid, and are not required to provide periodic pricing or valuation information to investors, and may involve complex tax structures and delays in distributing important tax information. These investments are not subject to the same regulatory requirements as mutual funds; and often charge high fees. Further, any number of conflicts of interest may exist in the context of the management and/or operation of any such fund. For complete information, please refer to the applicable offering memorandum.\n\nFor informational purposes only -- J.P.
