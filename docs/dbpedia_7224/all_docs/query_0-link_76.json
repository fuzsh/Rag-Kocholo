        "meta_description": "Since2024, Apple's stock price has fallen by a cumulative total of about 10.5%, which means that its weight in the S&P 500 index has dropped to about 5.7%, a new low since June 2021. In contrast, in mid-2023, this weight once exceeded 7.7%. On Thursday, the US Department of Justice accused Apple of violating antitrust laws. On that day, Apple's stock price recorded its worst single-day performance since August last year.",
