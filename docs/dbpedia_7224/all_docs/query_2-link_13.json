        "text": "?\n\nWe hear the S&P 500 mentioned everywhere- we see the chart on TV, read about it in newspapers and often hear how it compares in performance to various stocks. This American stock market index represents approximately 80% of the value of the U.S. equity market - that's why it's so important, but here's a little extra information about its history and significance, compliments of our friends at TrueNorth Wealth Management.\n\nThe S&P 500's History:\n\nStandard & Poor's introduced its first stock index in 1923.\n\nThe index, as we know it today, was introduced in 1957 and is maintained by the Standard & Poor's Index Committee.\n\nContrary to popular belief, it is not comprised of the 500 largest companies in America, but is a collection of large-cap stocks representing a broad range of market sectors, including energy, technology, health care, and consumer staples.\n\nS&P 500 Criteria:\n\nThe S&P 500 index is not static. Companies are sometimes removed in the event of mergers, acquisitions, significant restructuring, or bankruptcy.\n\nThe components of the S&P 500 are selected by committee. When considering the eligibility of a new addition, the committee assesses the company's merit using eight primary criteria: market capitalization, liquidity, domicile, public float, sector classification, financial viability, length of time publicly traded, and listing exchange.\n\nFollow this link to read more about the S&P 500 on TrueNorth Wealth Management's website.\n\nTrueNorth Financial Strategies\n\nFor more information and financial guidance, please call TrueNorth at 1-800-798-4080. Our financial advisors would be happy to schedule a consultation with you and your loved ones to make sure the things that matter most are protected and accounted for.\n\nFind out more about TrueNorth Wealth Management"
