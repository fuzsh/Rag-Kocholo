        "text": "Top 4 Mutual Fund and ETF Holders of AAPL Holder Shares % Out $ Value Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund 463.73 million 3.02% $88.63 billion Vanguard 500 Index Fund 365.80 million 2.39% $69.91 billion SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust 176.52 million 1.15% $33.74 billion Fidelity 500 Index Fund 175.43 million 1.14% $33.53 billion\n\nThe Vanguard Total Stock Market Index (VTSAX)\n\nThe Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund (VTSAX) is a one-stop shop for a wide range of small- and large-cap stocks. The fund seeks to capture returns on the entire stock market and thus holds more than 3,700 stocks. While the composition of VTSAX is not much different from that of S&P 500 ETFs, its investments in many small-cap stocks have kept it above others for several years.\n\n32.1% of the fund's assets are invested in technology stocks, with Apple holding the top position as of the end of April 2024. The fund owns about 463.73 million shares of Apple, amounting to 3.02% of the company's outstanding stock as of the end of 2023.\n\nThe fund's expense ratio is just 0.04%, well below the category average. The fund's three-year annualized return is 6.20%.\n\nThe Vanguard 500 Index Fund (VFIAX)\n\nAnother fund tracking the S&P 500, the Vanguard 500 Index Fund (VFIAX) gives weights to the stocks it invests in based on their positions in the S&P 500 index. With net assets of $482.2 billion as of April 2024, the fund's asset allocation skews in favor of information technology, healthcare, and consumer discretionary, forming 29.2%, 12.3%, and 10.3% of its portfolio, respectively. The fund holds about 365.8 million shares of Apple, 2.39% of the company, making it the second-largest mutual fund or ETF investor in Apple as of the end of 2024's first quarter.\n\nThe expense ratio for VFIAX is 0.04%. The fund has a three-year annualized return of 8.02% as of the end of Q1 2021.\n\nThe SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY)\n\nThe SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY), or \"spider,\" was first listed in 1993 by State Street Global Advisors. The ETF's main function is to replicate the performance of the S&P 500 index. Each share of SPY owns a small portion of all 500 stocks in the S&P 500. SPY is bought and sold much like a stock, but instead of making a bet on one particular company, you're making a bet on the market as a whole. SPY is invested heavily in technology, with 31.41% of its holdings dedicated to the sector.\n\nThe fund holds about 176.52 million shares, 1.15% of all Apple stock as of March 31, 2024, making it the company's third-largest mutual fund or ETF holder. Apple shares are the ETF's third largest holding and account for 6.24% of the fund's $526.2 billion portfolio. The expense ratio for SPY is 0.0945%.\n\nThe Fidelity 500 Index Fund (FXAIX)\n\nThe Fidelity 500 Index Fund (FXAIX) is another S&P 500 index fund—and among the least expensive index mutual funds around—with an expense ratio of just 0.015% per year. The fund is also the fourth largest mutual fund and ETF holder of Apple shares as of the first quarter of 2024, owning around 175.43 million of its shares. The fund manages over $512.39 billion in assets and has zero minimum investment, making it quite accessible to most investors."
