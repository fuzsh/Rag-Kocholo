        "text": "Our simulations assumed that the investment manager was implementing direct-indexing strategies that involved systematic, year-round tax-loss harvesting and was responsible for determining whether to recognize losses\n\nDisclosures\n\nIndex Definitions:\n\nRussell 3000 Index: Russell 3000 Index measures the performance of the 3,000 largest US companies based on total market capitalization.\n\nS&P 500 Index: The Standard & Poor's (S&P) 500 Index tracks the performance of 500 widely held, large-capitalization US stocks.\n\nMorgan Stanley Smith Barney LLC, its affiliates, Financial Advisors and Private Wealth Advisors do not provide tax or legal advice. Clients should consult their tax advisor for matters involving taxation and tax planning and their attorney for matters involving trust and estate planning and other legal matters.\n\nDirect Indexing may adversely impact account performance. There is no guarantee that Direct indexing will produce the desired tax results. Morgan Stanley offers investment program services through a variety of investment programs, which are opened pursuant to written client agreements. Each program offers investment managers, funds and features that are not available in other programs; conversely, some investment managers, funds or investment strategies may be available in more than one program. Morgan Stanley’s investment advisory programs may require a minimum asset level and, depending on a client’s specific investment objectives and financial position, may not be appropriate for the client. Please see the applicable program disclosure document for more information, available at www.morganstanley.com/ADV or from your Financial Advisor.\n\nTax-loss harvesting. IRS rules stipulate that if a security is sold by an investor at a tax loss, the tax loss will not be currently usable if the investor has acquired (or has entered into a contract or option on) the same or substantially identical securities 30 days before or after the sale that generated the loss. This so-called “wash sale” rule is applied with respect to all of the investor’s transactions across all accounts.\n\nEquity securities may fluctuate in response to news on companies, industries, market conditions and general economic environment.\n\nAn investment in an exchange-traded fund involves risks similar to those of investing in a broadly based portfolio of equity securities traded on an exchange in the relevant securities market, such as market fluctuations caused by such factors as economic and political developments, changes in interest rates and perceived trends in stock and bond prices. Investing in an international ETF also involves certain risks and considerations not typically associated with investing in an ETF that invests in the securities of U.S. issues, such as political, currency, economic and market risks. These risks are magnified in countries with emerging markets, since these countries may have relatively unstable governments and less established markets and economics. ETFs investing in physical commodities and commodity or currency futures have special tax considerations. Physical commodities may be treated as collectibles subject to a maximum 28% long-term capital gains rates, while futures are marked-to-market and may be subject to a blended 60% long- and 40% short-term capital gains tax rate. Rolling futures positions may create taxable events. For specifics and a greater explanation of possible risks with ETFs¸ along with the ETF’s investment objectives, charges and expenses, please consult a copy of the ETF’s prospectus. Investing in sectors may be more volatile than diversifying across many industries. The investment return and principal value of ETF investments will fluctuate, so an investor’s ETF shares (Creation Units), if or when sold, may be worth more or less than the original cost. ETFs are redeemable only in Creation Unit size through an Authorized Participant and are not individually redeemable from an ETF.\n\nInvestors should carefully consider the investment objectives and risks as well as charges and expenses of an exchange-traded fund or mutual fund before investing. The prospectus contains this and other important information about the mutual fund. To obtain a prospectus, contact your Financial Advisor or visit the mutual fund company’s website. Please read the prospectus carefully before investing.\n\nThe returns on a portfolio consisting primarily of environmental, social, and governance-aware investments (ESG) may be lower or higher than a portfolio that is more diversified or where decisions are based solely on investment considerations. Because ESG criteria exclude some investments, investors may not be able to take advantage of the same opportunities or market trends as investors that do not use such criteria. The companies identified and investment examples are for illustrative purposes only and should not be deemed a recommendation to purchase, hold or sell any securities or investment products. They are intended to demonstrate the approaches taken by managers who focus on ESG criteria in their investment strategy. There can be no guarantee that a client's account will be managed as described herein.Rebalancing does not protect against a loss in declining financial markets. There may be a potential tax implication with a rebalancing strategy. Investors should consult with their tax advisor before implementing such a strategy.\n\nIndices are unmanaged. An investor cannot invest directly in an index. They are shown for illustrative purposes only and do not represent the performance of any specific investment. Index returns include the reinvestment of all dividends, but do not reflect the payment of transaction costs, advisory fees or expenses that are associated with an investment. Performance of indices may be more or less volatile than any investment product. The risk of loss in value of a specific investment is not the same as the risk of loss in a broad market index.\n\nStrategy May Be Available as a Separately Managed Account or Mutual Fund\n\nStrategies are sometimes available in Morgan Stanley Wealth Management investment advisory programs both in the form of a separately managed account (“SMA”) and a mutual fund. These may have different expenses and investment minimums. Your Financial Advisor or Private Wealth Advisor can provide more information on whether any particular strategy is available in more than one form in a particular investment advisory program.\n\nOverlay Managers or Executing Sub-Managers (“managers”) in some of Morgan Stanley’s Separately Managed Account (“SMA”) programs may affect transactions through broker-dealers other than Morgan Stanley or our affiliates. If your manager trades with another firm, you may be assessed costs by the other firm in addition to Morgan Stanley’s fees. Those costs will be included in the net price of the security, not separately reported on trade confirmations or account statements. Certain managers have historically directed most, if not all, of their trades to outside firms. Information provided by managers concerning trade execution away from Morgan Stanley is summarized at: www.morganstanley.com/wealth/investmentsolutions/pdfs/adv/sotresponse.pdf. For more information on trading and costs, please refer to the ADV Brochure for your program(s), available at www.morganstanley.com/ADV, or contact your Financial Advisor/Private Wealth Advisor.\n\n©2023 Morgan Stanley Smith Barney LLC.
