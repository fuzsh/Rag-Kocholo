        "text": "Apple Inc share price: In a major recovery from its prolonged descent, Apple Inc shares rallied for four consecutive days. The stock market rally, boosted by the launch of Vision Pro, made Apple Inc the first publicly traded company to end a trading day above $3 trillion in its fourth straight record closing.\n\nAlso Read: Apple may launch Apple Watch Ultra 2 along with iPhone 15: Report\n\nThe tech giant closed at USD 193.97, up 2.3 per cent from a market value of USD 3.04 trillion on Friday. The tech juggernaut was able to briefly rise above the USD 3 trillion mark twice in January. But the stock continued its prolonged downfall and pushed Apple Inc's value briefly below USD 2 trillion earlier in 2023. The prolonged descent was the result of weak market sentiments due to a slowdown in growth and expectations of rising interest rates.\n\nApple Inc stock on the rise since the launch of Vision Pro\n\nAfter the mega Apple event which unveiled its ambitious Vision Pro, virtual reality headset to the world, Apple Inc stock began to rise in June this year.\n\n\"Apple invested heavily in services before the pandemic, and it's starting to bear fruit,\" David Russell, vice president of market intelligence at the TradeStation Group, told FOX Business, reported ANI.\n\n\"The market typically assigns higher multiples to those revenues, which is helping drive valuation. But the real driver has been renewed confidence in its fundamentals,\" he added.\n\nAlso Read: Apple iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus selling with up to â‚¹13,901 off on Amazon ahead of Prime Day sale\n\nInvestors optimistic about Apple's entry into the Indian markets\n\nDavid Russell also added that the higher-priced iPhones are fuelling margins and investors are also hoping into the future and expecting more positive outcomes. More than a quarter of a billion handsets due for an upgrade are also expected to give a major boost to the company.\n\nHe also highlighted the fact that Apple's entry into the Indian market will open new venues and opportunities for the company. Till now, the stock has rallied 49 per cent in 2023. The hike is partially the result of investors' belief in the Fed rate pause in the coming time.\n\nAlso Read: Apple may launch new headphones in July this year, report suggests\n\nApple's journey from near to bankruptcy to being the world's most valuable tech firm\n\nTwo years ago, Apple shares closed at $2 trillion for the first time. The company attained the $1 trillion mark about two years before that, reported Fox Business.\n\nIn the 1980s company went through worst of its phases, as it was near bankruptcy. At that time, Apple had to ask rival Microsoft for a cash infusion. After the comeback of late co-founder Steve Jobs, Apple's worth continued to rise steadily. Since 2011, the company has been run by CEO Tim Cook. It is worth noting that Apple ahs been one of the second-most valuable public ccompany at $2.5 trillion. Apart from Apple Inc, oil giant Saudi Aramco has a market value of $2.5 trillion. Oil giant Saudi Aramco has a market value of $2.08 trillion. Whereas, Alphabet, the parent firm of Google, Amazon and Nvidia has a market capitalisation of $1 trillion."
