Gender is based on the month of birth. Values 01 through 12 are male, 51 through 62 are female. Remarks This parse definition requires the input data to be on the form YYMMDDOOO, where YY is Year of Birth, MM is Month of Birth, DD is Day of Birth and OOO is Order Number, which consists of 3 or 4 digits. Month of Birth have values 01 through 12 (male) or 51 through 62 (female). Order Number is 3 digits if the person is born before 1954 and 4 digits if the person is born later than 1953.\n\nIf the input string does not contain a formally correct formatted birth number, the output will have a NO SOLUTION parse result and the output will be parsed based on the order of the input digits, as in the final example, with spaces between the digits.\n\nThe recommended procedure is first to determine if the input string can be parsed correctly, then apply parsing to correctly formatted input data. To determine if the formatting is correct, you can do either of the following:\n\n1. Assign a Result Code Field in DataFlux Data Management Studio Parse node and treat the output with NO SOLUTION results separately.\n\n2. Run a gender analysis on the input string using the Birth Number gender analysis definition. Input strings that get the U (Unknown) result cannot be parsed as a formally correct birth number. Remarks This standardization definition require the input data to be on the form YYMMDDOOO where YY is Year of Birth, MM is Month of Birth, DD is Day of Birth and OOO is Order Number, which consists of 3 or 4 digits. Month of Birth can have values 01 through 12 (male) or 51 through 62 (female). Order Number is 3 digits if the person is born before 1954, and 4 digits if the person is born later than 1953.\n\nRecommended procedure is first to determine if the input string is correctly formatted, then apply parsing only to correctly formatted input data. To determine if the formatting is correct you can do one of the following:\n\n1) Parse the string using the Birth Number parse definition. Assign a Result Code Field in DataFlux Data Management Studio Parse node. Output with NO SOLUTION results are not correctly formatted and should be treated separately.\n\n2) Run a gender analysis on the input string using the Birth Number gender analysis definition. Input strings that get U (Unknown) result are not correctly formatted and should be treated separately."
