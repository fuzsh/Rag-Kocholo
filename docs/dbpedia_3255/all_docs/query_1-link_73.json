        "text": "“I am not hiding my joy that the name Šiška finally won the public vote and what was originally a nickname is now her official name,” commented Miroslav Bobek, Prague Zoo’s Director. “Šiška - just like her parents - can be seen as an ambassador for pangolins in the wild, which face massive hunting in their ranges. This is the most important message of today’s christening, as evidenced by the personal wishes from a world-class conservationist like Jane Goodall.”\n\nOn Saturday 25th March, the first pangopup to be born in Europe got its name - via the Portal Pražana the public voted for the name Šiška (pine cone), and the little female was christened as part of the season opening celebrations.

The campaign aims to introduce the public to Prague Zoo’s animals, some of which are popular, while others are overlooked, but all are remarkable. By telling their individual stories, Prague Zoo’s patrons presented the species, with a special focus on their endangered wild relatives. The campaign was launched in the presence of representatives from Prague City Hall.\n\n“I've always loved Prague Zoo. After today’s visit, I am delighted to be able to state that it is a zoo that truly cares for the most endangered species. When I look at the animals that have been kept here for so long, I can see that they are getting top-class care,” said Prague’s Mayor Bohuslav Svoboda.\n\n“In a world where biodiversity is declining rapidly, progressive zoos are crucial. As its founder, we are extremely pleased that not only is Prague Zoo among these forward-thinking institutions, but, thanks to our support, it is also one of the best” said Jana Komrsková, Deputy Mayor for Environment and the Climate Plan.\n\nThe launch of the new Meet Them! campaign was attended by the patrons of the individual animal personalities. The singer-songwriter Pokáč gave a live premier of his Zoo Song. The moderator, Jan Kovařík, created an impromptu stand for the lyrics.\n\nPhoto Petr Hamerník, Zoo Prague\n\nThe diverse programme continued in the afternoon. This included the launch of Binturong butter popcorn, named after the Binturong a civet-like beast from Palawan. The distinctive smell of this inhabitant from the Indonesian Jungle actually resembles the aforementioned delicacy, so Prague Zoo has yet another gastronomic curiosity on offer after its Wombat Cubes and Elephant Urine.\n\nThe gallery in the Gočár’s Houses opened an exhibition of photographs 60 Years of Gorilla Breeding. The ribbon-cutting ceremony was attended by its patron, actress Petra Černocká. The exhibition maps six decades of breeding these iconic apes, which are intricately tied to Prague Zoo, and will run until mid-June.\n\nThroughout the day, visitors could also watch commented feedings and meet with the animals throughout the zoo. In addition, as of today, the zoo is open until 6pm, and the popular cable lift is back in operation after the winter break."
