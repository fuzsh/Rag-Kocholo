        "text": "Projections and Synthesis\n\nA still more complex branch of Svoboda’s innovations with light, optics, and projections involves the dramatic interplay of cinematic and slide projections with stage action and scenery. As distinct from the projections discussed in the previous section, these not only represent a far greater range of phenomena but are also more inextricably part of the establishment and flow of the dramatic action. As early as 1942 Svoboda had used slide projections in an amateur production, and in 1943 he was already experimenting with a scenario that would combine film projection and live action in a manner directly foreshadowing their union fifteen years later in Laterna Magika: see the sections on Straying and The Eleventh Commandment (pp. 52–53). Central to Svoboda’s use of projection techniques in whatever form are his theatrically oriented concerns with space and synthesis: “We in theatre are constantly aware of space, and we can enhance it by many means, whereas film can only transcribe space. In fact, in theatre we can enhance space by the use of film; that’s why theatre is the art of greatest synthesis.”1\n\nBefore proceeding to a closer consideration of several examples in which this type of projection work is crucial—Laterna Magika, Polyekran, and a few of their derivatives—it would be useful to make a brief survey of certain historical predecessors of these more fully evolved forms. Experimentation with static projections that attempt to provide a sense of drama and movement may be traced back as far as the seventeenth century and the crude but vivid use of successive slides devised by the Jesuit, Athanasius Kircher.2 In the early days of the motion picture, on the other hand, the influence of theatrical scenic conventions on film is evident in the capricious, inventive work of Melies at the turn of the century. Later, a more sophisticated, reciprocal influence between film and stage becomes apparent in the pioneering work of the Russian avant-garde, especially the indirect, aesthetic influence of film on theatre; that is, the gradual adoption by the theatre of those characteristics and techniques that are specifically cinematic, such as the plurality of film: its use of multiple perspectives and a multiplicity, rather than unity, of time, place, and action, as well as the resulting tendency toward montage effects and a rapid, dynamic tempo that captures the rhythms of contemporary life. Such indirect influence is clear in Meyerhold’s avant-garde productions in postwar Russia. But the first truly significant adoption of film by theatre is to be found in the work of Ervin Piscator.\n\nPLANS AND MODEL OF THE SYNTHETIC “TOTAL THEATER,” 1926\n\nThis theater provides a stage in arena form, a proscenium and a back stage, the latter divided in three parts. The 2,000 seats are disposed in the form of an amphitheater. There are no boxes. By turning the big stage platform which is solidary with part of the orchestra, the small proscenium stage is placed in the center of the theater, and the usual set can be replaced by projecting scenery on twelve screens placed between the twelve main columns supporting the structure.\n\nFigure 74. Gropius’s total-theater that allowed for front and rear projection on twelve screens surrounding the audience. The project was never realized.\n\nThe episodic, fragmented composition of Piscator’s dramatic texts, for example, frequently reveals the indirect effect of cinematic montage techniques. Drawing upon his extensive experience with film and slide projection, he also proposed three overlapping uses of these techniques in stage production: the documentary or instructional; the dramatic (when incorporated with the action either as transitional links or simultaneously with stage action); and the editorial, addressing the spectator directly while accompanying the action.3 His involvement with film even led to a consideration of new forms of theatre structure to accommodate the joint action of film and stage, most notably in the project for a total-theater, on which he worked with Walter Gropius. The results of their deliberations were described by Gropius:\n\nFig. 74\n\nI accepted his [Piscator’s] request to install projection screens and machines everywhere with great interest.… I counted on the possibilities of film projection not only on the curved cyclorama of all three depth stages, but I could also project in the entire audience space—on the walls and even the ceiling. For this purpose, projection screens were fastened between twelve supporting columns of the auditorium, on the translucent surfaces of which we could also project from the rear from twelve film projectors…. The projections could be supplemented by another cluster of instruments from a projection tower that could project images on the same screens from within the auditorium.… In other words, we substituted projection space for the former projection screen.4\n\nFig. 75\n\nThe projections employed by Piscator, Brecht, and the subsequent American Federal Theatre’s Living Newspapers were primarily designed for their instructional, documentary, or alienation purposes, rather than for the creation of atmosphere or emotion, per se. It was precisely a desire to produce an essentially emotive effect, however, that guided the significant projection work of the Czech director, E. F. Burian, during the 1930s. Burian, the most immediate predecessor, if not the inspirer, of Svoboda and his co-artists, staged several productions that made complex and integrated use of film and slide projection in order to create a poetic, lyrical atmosphere, perhaps most notably in his production of Wedekind’s Awakening of Spring in 1936, designed by Miroslav Kouřil. The production stayed within the limits of a regular proscenium theatre, placing the stage action between two projection screens, the front one a transparent scrim that curved across the entire proscenium opening, the rear one, opaque and smaller, in the upstage left position; a black cyclorama enclosed the stage. A total of four projection machines were used: two slide and one film projector at the rear of the auditorium projected onto the front scrim, and one slide projector offstage right projected onto the screen at upstage left; the film projections were black and white, the slides were in color. A great variety of combinations was available as a result of judiciously blending the intensities of lighting and projections, from the selective lighting of actors in darkened space to the full orchestration of lighted actors against a projected background, as well as seemingly within the projection on the scrim in front of them. Sometimes, figures on stage would be dramatically juxtaposed with the projected image of another character, who was being discussed; or the action on stage would be blacked out and a close-up of one of the characters would be projected onto the front scrim as his speech concluded. The action on stage was complete and coherent in itself, however; the projections were supplemental, and no true interaction occurred between stage and screen. The total system was later named the Theatergraph.\n\nFigure 75. E. F. Burian’s Theatergraph. 1—black drape cyclorama; 2a—front projection scrim; 2b—opaque projection screen; 3—slide projectors; 4—film projector; 5—slightly elevated acting platforms. Based on a drawing in Acta Scaenografica (March 1966), p. 163.\n\nFigure 76. An early, frontal diagram of Polyekran, which, with minor adaptations, was the basis of the popular exhibit at the Brussels World’s Fair of 1958.\n\nOf the two primary projection systems or forms devised by Svoboda, Laterna Magika and Polyekran, the latter is relatively simpler, and although its evolution is difficult to disentangle from that of Laterna Magika, it was Polyekran that contributed to the final form of Laterna Magika, rather than the other way round, according to both Svoboda and his creative partner Alfred Radok. For these reasons, Polyekran (literally, “multi-screen”) will be described first.\n\nFigs. 76–79\n\nPolyekran, as a form, was Svoboda’s own contribution to the Brussels World’s Fair of 1958; originally, he asked Alfred Radok to prepare a scenario for it and also expected that he would direct it, but as events turned out, Radok’s brother, Emil, provided both the scenario and direction.\n\nFigure 77. An early sketch of a proposal for Polyekran.\n\nPolyekran is fundamentally a pure projection form; it is not combined with live acting or scenic elements. Its origin is related to Svoboda’s response to the development of various wide-screen film techniques in the 1950s; in contrast to such techniques, all of which attempted to eliminate the impression of a screen and to give the spectator the sensation of being part of the picture, Polyekran deliberately emphasizes the presence of the screen, or, rather, screens. Its principle is a simultaneous and synchronous projection of slides and film on several static screens, during which the images on the individual screens are in dramatic interplay with one another in the creation of a total, organic composition. Svoboda adds:\n\nPolyekran offers the possibility of free composition, a free shaping and creation on several screens. Real objects and people are projected, but the relationships among them are not realistic, but rather supra-realistic, perhaps surrealistic. Essentially, it’s the principle of abstract and pure collage, which is an old and basic technique of theatre. “Op art” is perhaps simply a more recent name for it. In any case, the contrast of varied things on stage is basic to theatre: the objects thereby acquire new relationships and significance, a new and different reality.*\n\nTechnically, the elements of the Brussels production consisted of eight screens of various sizes and shapes suspended at different angles from horizontal steel wires in front of a black velvet backdrop. Eight automatic slide projectors and seven film projectors, synchronously controlled by electronic tape, threw images upon these screens. The visual collage was accompanied by stereophonic sound (also carried on the electronic tape), the total ten-minute performance being thematically unified by its depiction of the annual Prague Spring Music Festival.\n\nIn form, Polyekran had one somewhat distant forerunner: in 1927, Abel Gance employed a three-screen, triptych-like arrangement for his film Napoleon. For the most part, however, Gance did relatively little with complex and varied juxtaposition of images; moreover, he used the technique for primarily literal, narrative ends.\n\nThis image has been redacted from the digital edition.

Polyekran employs only projections: simultaneous, multiple images from slides and film.\n\nThis image has been redacted from the digital edition. Please refer to the print edition to see the image.\n\nFigure 79. Polyekran. The photographs illustrate the collage-like interplay of images that defines the form. The variously angled screens were static and essentially in the same plane.\n\nPolyekran, in slightly revised format, was subsequently presented at the Brno Fair in 1959; more important, its principles formed the scenographic basis for one of Svoboda’s major productions, Their Day, by Josef Topol, in 1959 (pp. 92–95)·\n\nIn describing the relation between Polyekran and Laterna Magika, Svoboda said: “In comparison with Polyekran, which is totally a film spectacle and technically a concern of film, Laterna Magika is theatre with living actors, singers, dancers, musicians.… On the one hand, we used familiar scenographic techniques such as slide and film projection. New expressive possibilities were added by panoramic film and projection with multi-exposure on several screens at once. A second feature is the use of mobile screens that are joined to the performance of a live actor.”5\n\nStill another essential element, in addition to mobile screens and live actors, is film that is produced specifically and solely for its use in the given production, rather than film previously made for some other purpose and subsequently incorporated into a separately created stage work.\n\nSvoboda describes the work leading up to Laterna Magika in this way: “Our Laterna Magika arose on the basis of more than fifteen years of joint work with director Alfred Radok. We experimented with some elements of Laterna Magika soon after World War II during productions at the Grand Opera of the Fifth of May, later on the stage of the Tyl theatre, and then especially on the stage of the former theatre of the Czech film organization, where we staged the first production that fully exploited the combination of film and theatre, a dramatization of Šamberk’s Eleventh Commandment. For this production we even shot a special film”6 (Figure 24).\n\nCommenting on the essential non-autonomy of each medium, film and living actor, in Laterna Magika, Svoboda added: “The play of the actors cannot exist without the film, and vice-versa—they become one thing. One is not the background for the other; instead, you have a simultaneity, a synthesis and fusion of actors and projection. Moreover, the same actors appear on screen and stage, and interact with each other. The film has a dramatic function.”*\n\nLaterna Magika becomes, in effect, a new, hybrid medium, the potential force and expressiveness of which are perhaps suggested best in some remarks by Marshall McLuhan made without reference to Laterna Magika, when he writes of “true hybrid energy”: “The hybrid or the meeting of two media is a moment of truth and revelation from which new form is born.… The moment of the meeting of media is a moment of freedom and release from the ordinary trance and numbness imposed on them by our senses.”7\n\nFigure 80.

Laterna Magika, a simple juxtaposition employing only the wide screen. Few photos exist of the more complex, multiple image sequences.\n\nFigs. 80–83\n\nLike Polyekran, Laterna Magika was devised for the Brussels Fair of 1958, where it enjoyed a spectacular success. It consisted of three film and two slide projectors, synchronously controlled, plus a device that enabled deflection of one projection beam to any desired spot, including a moving screen. In a stage space measuring approximately 50’ × 24’ × 20’ were arranged eight types of mobile screens with special, highly directional reflecting surfaces; they could rise, fall, move to the side, fold up, rotate, appear and disappear in precise rhythm with the actors. The stage itself was provided with a moving belt to accommodate the need for virtually instantaneous live action in response to the film. One of the screens, moreover, was equipped with a diaphragmatic framing shutter curtain that could alter both the size and shape of the screen. And the total presentation was enhanced by multi-speaker stereophonic sound.\n\nJan Grossman, himself a theatre director as well as critic, was involved with the theoretical groundwork of Laterna Magika, and his remarks on the new form elaborate on some of its potentials: “Laterna Magika offered the dramatist, film scenarist, poet, and composer a new language: a language that is more intense, sharply contrasting, and rhythmic; one which can captivatingly project statistics as well as ballet, documents as well as lyric verse, and is therefore capable of absorbing and artistically working over the density and dynamics, the multiplicity and contrariety of the world in which we live.”8\n\nAlfred Radok, director of Laterna Magika, suggested its special quality in this way: “Above all, Laterna Magika has the capacity of seeing reality from several aspects. Of ‘extracting’ a situation or individual from the routine context of time and place and apprehending it in some other fashion, perhaps by confronting it with a chronologically distinct event.”9\n\nThat Laterna Magika was not without its special problems, however, became evident even while it was experiencing its greatest success, if not, indeed, even earlier. For example, the complicated integration of film and living performers demanded a formidable amount of time and money. A related though less obvious difficulty was that the filmed portions had to be prepared far in advance of their integration with the live performers, which meant that many artistic decisions had to be made and became binding long before there was any way of knowing how they might work out months later. In other words, the film had to be made in advance, and if the combination with live dancer, for example, didn’t work, there simply wasn’t time to re-shoot the film to adapt to the dancer. If the dancer, in this situation, couldn’t make the necessary adjustment, it meant that the particular sequence probably had to be scrapped. The more profound problem inherent in this situation was that the film virtually enslaved the live performer, whose margin of variability in performance approached zero because the film was a prefabricated element to which the performer must inflexibly adapt. Svoboda put it this way: “It means that Laterna Magika is to a certain extent deprived of that which is beautiful about theatre: that each performance can have a completely different rhythm, that the quality of a performance can be better or worse, that a production can expand its limits.”10 A more material problem was that of appropriate space and facilities both for the preparation of Laterna Magika and for its eventual performance. “All attempts with the medium have occurred in space designed for conventional theatres,” said Svoboda, “and such space is not suitable for the medium. It’s necessary to build entirely special seating arrangements and stages in order that the principle might be given the widest scope in which to evolve.”11 The nearest approach to a special home for Laterna Magika was a permanent adaptation of a moving picture theatre for Laterna Magika’s Prague premiere in May 1959. The resulting structure had some advantages—permanently installed electronic equipment for projections and sound, a specially rigged stage, and optimal sight lines—but it was still restricted by existing and inflexible dimensions.\n\nAgain, on a more fundamental level, Laterna Magika never experienced the ultimate test of presenting a work that was written especially for it; that is, a work other than a revue or cabaret entertainment. In its original version, as an entertaining propaganda piece for Czechoslovakia, it was a success. Its original creators had thoughts of eventually using the form for Shakespeare or explorations of challenging contemporary realities, for example the Eichmann case, but managerial and administrative elements viewed Laterna Magika in terms of economics and politics, with the result that its subsequent artistic career was aborted. A version of Martinů’s opera, The Opening of the Wells, was pre-screened and not allowed to be released, apparently because it offended the residual socialist realist criteria of those who sat in judgment. Svoboda subsequently started work on a version of Offenbach’s The Tales of Hoffmann but withdrew from the production when he felt that it was being artistically compromised. The original creative team split up for several years, and those who remained or later took over the process have not to this day been able to produce anything more than tourist-level entertainment with it. It is, indeed, a painful and ironic saga, redeemed in part by the opportunity it offered for testing a number of new materials and techniques and for approaching the realization of a striking new form. Svoboda himself believes that his subsequent work with Radok almost ten years later, on Gorki’s The Last Ones (1966), partly “rehabilitated the form with new proportions and dimensions and perhaps brought it a few centimeters closer to the goal of a teatro mundi.” Other productions that employed a basic feature of the form were Intoleranza (1965) and Prometheus (1968).\n\nFigure 82. Laterna Magika. The live performer and the screened images are mutually dependent; they function together simultaneously.\n\nFigure 83. Laterna Magika. Five previously filmed projections of the young man at the piano were synchronized with his stage performance.\n\nFigure 84. Diapolyekran top and frontal views. 1–3—movable projection cubes with screens for rear projection; 4—two 35mm slide projectors mounted one above the other at the rear of each cube, the multiple projections and movement of ali cubes being electronically programmed.\n\nFigure 85. Diapolyekran. The photographs suggest the variety of visual effects obtainable; a distinct rhythm characterized the flow of images.\n\nFigs. 84, 85\n\nOne other noteworthy and recent variant of Svoboda’s projection techniques is the Diapolyekran system, which had its first public exposure at the Montreal Expo 67 as a ten-minute feature entitled The Creation of the World. It, too, is a multi-screen, multi-projection system reminiscent of Polyekran in its pure film, non-actor features, but in a tighter, shallower, and more stable form. As the illustrations suggest, the projection screens form a wall composed of cubes, 112 in all. Each cube has two automatic 35 mm slide projectors mounted at its rear, capable of flashing five images per second, even though the actual rate was considerably slower; a total of 30,000 slides were used, and the whole operation was computerized. Moreover, each cube was capable of sliding forward or backward approximately twelve inches, thus providing a surface in kinetic relief for the projections. The basic technique is of course a collage or montage that allows for a great range of visual effects: the entire wall of cubes may unite to present one total, conventionally coherent picture, or else literally disintegrate that picture in definitively cubistic fashion, or, indeed, present a surrealistic collage of disparate images. And all of this occurs in a dynamic, rhythmic flow ideally suited to projecting process as well as startling, abrupt confrontation. The original presentation was an eloquent, sensitive expression of wonder at the miracle and mystery of creation, evolution, and civilization.\n\nLike Polyekran and Laterna Magika, Diapolyekran has also had its theatrically adapted offspring, chiefly The Suzanna Play in 1968, The Journey in 1969, and The Soldiers in 1969.\n\nWhat is common to all three of these projection techniques is fundamental to virtually all of Svoboda’s work: the principle of synthesis, which implies a vivid sense of separate elements imaginatively combined to express new insights into reality. It is a principle that may take a variety of forms, including, for example, cubism, especially as defined in the following remarks by Marshall McLuhan: “Instead of the specialized illusion of the third dimension, cubism sets up an interplay of planes and contradictions or dramatic conflict of patterns, lights, textures.… [It] drops the illusion of perspective in favor of instant awareness of the whole.… Is it not evident that the moment that sequence yields to the simultaneous, one is in the world of the structure and of configuration?”12"
