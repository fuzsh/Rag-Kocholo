        "text": "Svoboda: What does the surname Svoboda mean?\n\nThe last name Svoboda is a Czech and Slovak surname, derived from the Czech word for \"freedom\". It is believed to have first appeared in the 15th century and was used by families who were generally free or living outside of a feudal system. This meaning is further echoed in the meaning of the related Svaboda surname of eastern Slovakia.\n\nThe root word \"svoboda\", or \"freedom\" itself, has an extensive history in the Czech Republic and has been celebrated since the late 1000s CE with the establishment of a region known as Svobodné Korutany (Free Crownland). In the early 1700s, members of the Svoboda family began using the name in various regions of the modern-day Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Hungary.\n\nIn modern times, the last name Svoboda is found throughout the world, particularly in East-Central Europe, Scandinavia, the United States, and Canada.
