        "text": "Previous summaries of Creative Drama\n\nSUMMARY 2023/3\n\nHana Cisovská: Tvořivá dramatika - 99 + 1 reasons why you should read it – The journal Tvořivá dramatika (Creative Drama) was first published in 1990 and this is the 100th issue. Therefore it has a different format than usual and looks back at the past thirty years from different points of view. The opening article by Hana Cisovská from the University of Ostrava charts the development of the Creative Drama magazine, examining how it has changed in the context of the development of Czech drama education. First, she looks at the initial issue, which was created in 1990 by the newly founded Creative Dramatics Association (Sdružení pro tvořivou dramatiku). She then traces the evolution of the journal throughout the subsequent three decades. She notes that two fundamental areas of drama education emerged in the early years: classroom drama and theatre with children and youth. The magazine has continued to focus on these two areas ever since. She recalls that from the very beginning, Creative Drama published articles about the development of drama education abroad, writing about the workshops of Jonothan Neelands, Cecily O'Neil, Judith Ackroyd and others. The author points out that Creative Drama has also systematically covered trends in children’s literature since the early 1990s. The author describes the role that Creative Drama played in the early 21st century in its efforts to encourage the inclusion of drama education in the Czech school curriculum. A regular part of Creative Drama has also been reviews of books on drama education and, in the last twenty years, the Reflexions-Concepts-Contexts section which publishes research on the theory and history of drama education as well as current topics.\n\nEva Machková: Theatre Education: Remembering the Forerunner of Creative Drama – Between 1964 and 1974, Eva Machková fouded, prepared and published Divadelní výchova (Theatre Education), a journal that was printed by the Central House of People's Art Creativity (ÚDLUT, now known as NIPOS-ARTAMA). In her article, Eva Machková describes what topics the journal covered and how it contributed to the development of modern Czech drama education. Despite the fact that was published as a series of “workbooks” because it was not possible to be published as an official journal, it was of crucial importance to the canon of Czech modern drama education. Eva Machková included articles about both the experiences of creative Czech leaders of children's ensembles and materials on drama education in foreign countries. (This posthumous article, written in the spring of this year, is the final contribution of Eva Machková, a prominent figure in Czech drama education who died in October 2023.)\n\nJakub Hulák: Drama education and children's theatre in the post-dramatic era – The author works for NIPOS-ARTAMA and is a specialist in drama education, children's theatre and recitation (he organizes the National Children's Stage Festival, the Nahlížení workshops, and many other activities). In this article, he claims that theatre specialists’ perspective on performances by children and youth has changed significantly over the past few years. He attributes this change to a shift in opinion about theatre-making, which is much more open to postdramatic theatre and less tied to classical theatre. He cites the words of the Czech theatre historian Jan Císař: “I admire and am a great fan of drama education. I believe that the National Jiráskův Hronov Amateur Theatre Festival has greatly benefited from the inclusion of shows performed by children. The methods that these groups use, in particular dramatic playing that contribute to the social and personal development of the participants, result in a very different type of theatre than what we were used to. I believe that the methods of drama education have had a very strong influence on the overall trends of postmodernism in Czech amateur theatre.”\n\nHana Cisovská: The Current Situation of Drama Education Teacher Training – The article introduces the reader to all types of drama education teacher training available in Czech Republic. She outlines Czech universities which currently offer courses on drama education. The most prominent are the performing arts academies in Prague and Brno which have departments of drama education. She reminds the reader that several pedagogical faculties and secondary pedagogical schools also offer study programs in drama education. The author also describes other opportunities for informal training – long-term courses and workshops at the Children's Stage Festival, etc. She recommends literature on drama education (published mainly by NIPOS-ARTAMA and the Academy of Performing Arts in Prague) which can play an important role. According to the author, there are drama education training opportunities for people of all ages and experience. There is a wide spectrum offering different forms based on the participants’ needs and availability.\n\nIrina Ulrychová: The Dramaturgy of Children’s Theatre 2000–2021 – The author, writing from a dramaturgical perspective, presents an overview of Czech theatre performed by children over the past twenty years. Irina Ulrychová opens the piece by explaining that most performances by children in the Czech Republic are for devised. She discusses which genres and authors of children’s literature are most frequently chosen by children’s theatre directors, and the forms and features of scripts that are created by children’s theatre ensembles. The article concludes with some specific examples and analyses of recent dramatizations.\n\nGabriela Zelená Sittová: Speech Education and Recitation – This article by the newly-appointed Head of Dept. of Drama in Education at the Theatre Faculty of the Academy of Performing Arts in Prague offers insight into the role of recitation in cultivating speech education in the Czech Republic. It describes several books used for teaching speech education and different approaches to teaching it, in particular at children’s theatre festivals and drama workshops.\n\nLuděk Korbel: You can always come home... Interview with Iva Procházková – Iva Procházková is one of the most significant contemporary Czech children’s authors, and her books have also won several awards in Germany. This extensive interview touches on how she started writing, emigration, German children's literature and, of course, her own writing.\n\nLuděk Korbel: Which children's books have appealed to our readers and collaborators in the last thirty years – For the 100th issue of Creative Drama, the editors prepared a survey on contemporary literature for children and young adults. It asked the following questions to contributors, readers, drama teachers and leaders of children's theatre groups: “Which children’s book from the last thirty years would you recommend (for reading or working with children)? What particular qualities made you choose it?” The most cited books were Pavel Šrut’s adaptations of English and American fairy tales, Iva Procházkováֹ’s books for young children and teenagers, and books by Petr Stančík, Petr Horáček and Norwegian author Jostein Gaarder.\n\nLuděk Richter: A report on Czech theatre for children over the last thirty years – The article looks back at the most interesting productions for children and youth produced over the last thirty years. Luděk Richter talks about productions by professional theatres that regularly produce shows for children and youth, in particular Divadlo Drak from Hradec Králové, the Alfa Theatre from Plzeň, the Naive Theatre from Liberec, and Theatre on Dlouhá Street from Prague. He also reviews shows of smaller professional companies (e.g. DAMÚZA from Prague, the Forman Brothers’ Theatre), as well as amateur adult ensembles (e.g. the Prague ensemble Tate Iyumni, ensemble C from Svitavy, RÁMUS from Plzeň). The author notes that during this period there has been a tendency to produce shows for very young children and to emphasize playfulness and visual aspects in productions, as well ones based on music and experimental/postmodern productions. At the end of the article the author concludes: “Despite the fact that theatre scholars often marginalise theatre for children and there is almost no critical or theoretical reflection, a number of interesting, inspiring and high-quality productions have been created over the last thirty years.”\n\nCHILDREN'S STAGE 72\n\nThe editors also chose an unconventional approach to the textual supplement for the 100th issue of Creative Drama. They have printed two unpublished scripts written by Milada Mašatová (1934–2000), one of the most prominent personalities of Czech children's theatre and Czech puppetry. From the early 1970s to the end of the 20th century, Milada Mašatová had a strong influence on the development of methods to create theatre with children. Her productions, created with her children's and youth theatre groups in Olomouc, were always among the most impressive and acclaimed at national children’s theatre festivals and the national puppetry festival (Loutkářská Chrudim). Both scripts texts in this issue of Creative Drama are published from the author's manuscripts. The first is an adaptation of The Emperor's New Clothes by Hans Christian Andersen. The second is an adaptation of the classic folk puppet drama Johannes Doctor Faust, which Milada Mašatová created for her teenage troupe. Her production, entitled Our Faust, based on this script, was performed at the 1991 National Children's Theatre Summer Festival in Prachatice. For the adaptation of Johann Doctor Faust, the editors included a reprint of an old edition of this puppet show script (from 1862), so that readers can appreciate the sensitivity of Milada Masatová’s adaptation.\n\nSUMMARY 2023/2\n\nREFLECTIONS-CONCEPTS-CONTEXTS\n\nBarbora Gréeová: Devised Theatre with Children and Youth – Barbora Gréeová begins her study by quoting from a book by Alison Oddey: “Devised theatre can start from anything. It is determined and defined by a group of people who set up an initial framework or structure to explore and experiment with ideas, images, concepts, themes, or specific stimuli that might include music, text, objects, paintings, or movement. A devised theatrical performance originates with the group while making the performance, rather than starting from a play text that someone else has written to be interpreted. A devised theatre product is work that has emerged from and been generated by a group of people working in collaboration.” B. Gréeová also takes into account the relatively rich Czech literature on devised theatre (Josef Kovalčuk, Zdeněk Hořínek, etc.). However, the main source for her reflections consists in her own rich experience as she ranks among the most prominent young leaders of children's and young ensembles today. She teaches drama at the Primary Arts School in Most and in recent years, her productions have regularly appeared at national festivals, exploring new ways for theatre with children and youth. B. Gréeová reflects on the benefits of this type of theatrical work from the viewpoint of drama education and points out its importance for the personal, social and artistic development of children and young people. The central part of the study lies in articulating what distinguishes devised theatre from theatre, where the leader chooses a ready-made, pre-written theatre text.\n\nDRAMA-ART-THEATRE\n\nViktorie Čermáková: What Children's Stage 2023 Brought To the Audience – Actress, director and teacher Viktorie Čermáková characterizes and evaluates the performances of this year's Children's Stage national festival in Svitavy.\n\nAPPLIED DRAMA-EDUCATION-SCHOOL\n\nAdéla Ohnheiserová: Educational Programmes in Professional Theatres in Great Britain: A Combination of Culture and Education – The student of the Theatre Faculty of the Janáček Academy of Performing Arts in Brno visited several theatres in the UK as part of her drama education studies and examined what their educational programmes look like. In her article, she reports on the programmes offered to children, youth and other interested people by the following theatres: the Royal Court Theatre, the National Theatre and the Half Moon Theatres in London, the Traverse Theatre and Capital Theatres in Edinburgh and the Lyric Theatre in Belfast, Northern Ireland.\n\nREFLECTIONS-REVIEWS-INFORMATION\n\nEva Gažáková: Another Step Towards Building the Didactics of Drama Education – The pedagogue of drama education of the Pedagogical Faculty of the University of West Bohemia in Pilsen writes about the new publication called Drama Methods in Teaching, compiled by Eva Machková (the book was published by the Academy of Performing Arts in Prague). The anthology contains a number of lessons and programmes in which drama serves as a means of teaching other subjects. E. Machková primarily addresses the book to current and future teachers as an inspiration for didactic enrichment of their own teaching and as a challenge to search for further ways. The lessons (designed mostly by students or graduates of the Dept. of Drama in Education of the Theatre Faculty in Prague) are organised into three chapters according to their focus: Kindergarten and Elementary School, Middle and High School, Foreign Languages and Drama Methods.\n\nLuděk Korbel: School Steps Towards Turning Inwards: A Review of a Book on Working with Poetry in Primary School – The publication by Zdeňka Braumová, who teaches at the University of Liberec, aims to enhance the position of literature and poetry in school. The reviewer, however, concludes that this goal has not been met. For the most part, the book is based on a compilation of quotations from various sources. Also, the suggestions for working with literature are, according to the author of the review, unimaginative and methodologically problematic.\n\nART FOR CHILDREN AND YOUTH\n\nHelena Zbudilová: Artistic Literary Text for Children as Means of Emotional Education in School and Leisure in the 21st century – The author of the article emphasizes that emotional education should not be missing among the current trends in the field of pedagogy and psychology in the 21st century. She bases this assumption on the findings of psychologists and educators. At the heart of her article is a reflection on several books for younger children that focus on emotional education – whether they are artistic non-fiction books or fiction.\n\nLuděk Korbel: It All Started with the Quarrelling Classes. An interview with Bára Dočekalová about the book Battle of the Diamond. Last year, B. Dočekalová published a novel featuring children's heroes as well as the theme of sports; the story is set in the American country. According to the reviewer, the book interestingly disrupts readers' expectations and also puts into a different light the demands that are placed on teenagers nowadays, be it the pressure for success or fame. From the pedagogical point of view it is interesting that the story is based on the author's own professional experience of many years – the plot is based on specific drama work she incorporated into her English lessons. In this interview, the author reveals the genesis of the book.\n\nJaroslav Provazník-Michaela Lažanová-Luděk Korbel-Milan Pavlovič-Alžběta Rajchlová-Lucie Šmejkalová-Marta Žilková: Reviews of new books and performances for children and youth - Reviews of new books and performances that might inspire drama teachers and leaders of children's theatre groups.\n\nJaroslav Provazník: Looking Back at a Book That it Would Be a Shame to Forget – In his traditional column, Jaroslav Provazník writes about Italo Calvino's book Marcovaldo, which was published in the 1960s and came out in Czech translation in 1974. All twenty of Marcovaldo's stories are set in an everyday city setting which is killing its inhabitants with its frantic rhythm and monotony. Each of the stories is based on a distinctive plot, which might provide good inspiration for theatrical work. Calvino is an author who knows how to write witty stories, sometimes even anecdotes, but always with an important theme. “Even though this book is sixty years old, it hasn't aged at all. On the contrary, the world in which we live today has given it new relevance,” J. Provazník concludes.\n\nCHILDREN'S STAGE 71\n\nThe text supplement of Tvořivá dramatika brings the script Skellig, which Stanislav Nemrava, a teacher of the Primary Arts School in Uherské Hradiště, dramatized with his ensemble on the basis of the eponymous book by David Almond. This performance was also on the programme of the national festival of children's theatre Children's Stage in Svitavy this year. The script is complemented by Stanislav Nemrava's article How did the journey of the “27 and 53” theatre group lead to Skellig describing how this production came into being and how the company sought the right theatrical means to stage this mysterious story.\n\nSUMMARY 2023/1\n\nREFLECTIONS-CONCEPTS-CONTEXTS\n\nPavel Skála: Youth theatre companies and the assessment of their performances at theatre festivals – The study is a part of a Master's thesis, which was defended in September 2022 at the Dpt. of Drama in Education at the Theatre Faculty in Prague. Pavel Skála focuses on the specifics of youth theatre companies (with members ca. 15–20 years old), i.e. groups whose work in many aspects resembles the style of work in theatre with children, but has greater ambitions in the sense that the work more than before focuses more on the outcome, i.e. on a more purposeful creation of a theatre performance. Pavel Skála has been leading children's and student ensembles at the Basic Art School in Most for many years and has a long history of successful productions to his name, with his youth theatre groups have participated in various festivals and seminars. In addition, he organizes workshops and festivals himself, so his interest in evaluating young theatre performances comes as natural. During the preparatory stage of writing his master's thesis, he carried out extensive research in the form of questionnaires and interviews, in which he posed questions to teachers, students, discussion leaders at theatre shows, spectators and organisers of festivals where young theatre productions are presented (adding up to the total of more than one hundred people participating in the survey). In his research P. Skála collected opinions on how the respondents perceived the specifics of student theatre (also in historical context), what their opinion was on the choice of discussion seminar lecturers at shows, what aspects should be taken into account when evaluating student theatre, etc. Pavel Skála devotes a separate chapter to the typology of festivals and shows in which high school theatre companies can participate in the Czech Republic – starting with those in which the groups at first participate in regional festivals, whence the most interesting productions are chosen for the national festival, and ending with events are informal meetings or workshops rather than festivals. The core of P. Skála's is in examining how discussion seminars concerning performances are organised and run, what forms these seminars can take, and what their aims can be. However, the author also mentions the drawbacks of these seminars. He systematically discusses the criteria for evaluating young companies, the role of the jury and also the moderator of the discussions. “With student theatre, it is not only about the evaluation of the theatrical form at a show or festival, but also about discussing the creative process that led to the production. In addition to enhancing artistic activity, there is an important educational element. Participants are taught to talk and reflect on what they have seen, to try to understand the wider context and at the same time be respectful to other participants in the discussion,\" writes Pavel Skála in the conclusion.\n\nAPPLIED DRAMA-EDUCATION-SCHOOL\n\nKateřina Žarnikov: Experience-Learn-Try out: Workshop with Ádám Bethlenfalvy in Jičín – On 15-22 September 2022, the 26th national workshop Drama Education in School was held in Jičín, offering the opportunity to experience a workshop with Ádám Bethlenfalvy, a Hungarian lecturer and teacher. Ádám's practice focuses mainly on theatre in education and process drama. The workshop was divided into two parts. In the first part, Ádám let the participants have a glimpse of seven process dramas so that they could experience the activities and methods of this type of work. The second part of the workshop was the theoretical and methodological input. Finally, the participants had the opportunity to experience the process of planning their own drama.\n\nKateřina Žarnikov-Barbora Jurinová-Veronika Kořínková: Drama4All: Tall and Small: 9th Conference of IDEA World Congress in Reykjavik – This article brings a report on the World Congress, through which IDEA celebrated its 30th birthday. The authors inform about the projects that were presented at the Congress, the workshops that were on the agenda, and the activities of working groups that dealt with issues such as drama education with preschool and primary school children, drama education and theatre in secondary school, drama education in a multicultural world, teacher education in the field of theatre and drama, theatre as an element of community development, and drama education employing technology and new media. The authors conclude their article by claiming: \"The IDEA World Conference seemed to reflect Iceland itself. It was colourful, open and friendly. It not only allowed for an exchange of experiences and inspiration for further work, but, most importantly, helped to connect people from all over the world.\"\n\nDRAMA-ART-THEATRE\n\nRoman Černík-Ivana Sobková: Teatr Węgajty and its inspiration for drama education: Notes from an expedition – In 2022, a group of students from the Dpt. of Drama in Education at the Prague Theatre Faculty visited the Polish Węgajty Theatre, operating since the first half of the 1980s on an old isolated farm in the middle of a forest, whose theatre and other artistic works are inspired by tradition. Since 2003, Teatr Węgajty has also organised an exceptional festival of contemporary theatre with a rich programme of workshops and lectures as well as discussions. The participation of the students from Prague in the week-long programme gave them an insight into the work of this original theatre community and was, among other things, an impulse for working on their original theatre project and considering how the work of the Węgajty theatre community can inspire drama education.\n\nREFLECTIONS-REVIEWS-INFORMATION\n\nRoman Černík: A valuable Look Back at the Insights Theatre Festival: The last three decades of Czech student and young amateur theatre as seen through a unique encounter – A review of a book that summarizes the thirty years of the unique national workshop of high school drama and young theatre, which is held annually at the end of October in the South Bohemian town of Bechyně. What Roman Černík appreciates about this comprehensive almanac edited by Jakub Hulák, the organizer of the Insights festival, is how accurately it documents each year of this national creative gathering including all the important information about performances, lecturers, central themes of each year and also the various forms of unconventionally conceived discussions.\n\nART FOR CHILDREN AND YOUTH\n\nMarta Žilková: Film and TV Christmas 2022 – A review of three film fairy tales that were broadcast on Slovak and Czech television at Christmas.\n\nDagmar Petišková: Illustrator Mariquita: The Life of a Ukrainian Immigrant in Inter-war Czechoslovakia and his Illustrations in Czech Books and Magazines for Children and Youth – A staff member of the J. A. Komenský Museum and Library in Prague, D. Petišková has written a valuable essay for Tvořivá dramatika concerning the work of the Ukrainian artist Myroslav Hryhorijiv (mostly signing his works as Mariquita), who emigrated with his family in 1921, first to Poland and shortly afterwards to Czechoslovakia. The author introduces the reader to the work of this illustrator that has almost fallen into oblivion.\n\nLeah Gaffen: Can't See the Forrest for the (Little) Trees: Can we ignore the dark history of a popular children's book? - The author, who has lived in Prague since the early 1990s, where she directs a children's theatre company, has written a polemical essay on the book The Education of Little Tree, signed by Forrest Carter, which has been extremely popular since its first publication in 1976. L. Gaffen points out that the author of this book about a little Cherokee boy is actually Asa Earl Carter, a controversial figure who promoted racist views and segregation in the 1950s. But even more disturbing, according to the author, is Carter's false claim of Cherokee ancestry. Leah Gaffen's article is accompanied by an interview with Jonah Lossiah, member of the Cherokee Nation.\n\nGabriela Zelená Sittová-Alžběta Rajchlová-Jindřiška Bumerlová-Marta Žilková-JG Růžička-Bára Meda Řezáčová-Lucie Šmejkalová-Jaroslav Provazník: Reviews of new books and performances for children and youth – Reviews of new books and performances that might inspire drama teachers and leaders of children's theatre groups.\n\nJaroslav Provazník: Looking back at a book that it would be a shame to forget – In his regular column, J. Provazník this time recalls stories inspired by paintings that the well-known Czech author of books for young readers Hana Doskočilová used to write for the children's magazine Ohníček in the early 1980s. She took inspiration from paintings representing different times and styles (from prehistoric drawings all the way to 20th century paintings). Her style ranges from fairy-tale to psychological to mysterious – depending on the character and atmosphere of the artwork. Moreover, these stories are offered to readers as an invitation to try to find their own story in each painting and write it themselves.\n\nCHILDREN’S STAGE 70\n\nThe textual supplement of Tvořivá dramatika brings the script of Michaela Homolová's production of A Few Things from Adrian, which Jana Soprová, a reviewer of the national show Mladá scéna 2013, labelled \"an energy bomb\" and wrote about it: \"The starting point was the book The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole Aged 13 ¾ by Sue Townsend, from which the ensemble chose individual episodes and with great energy and inventiveness worked them out in the form of short sketches. They touch on important events in Adrian's life, his relationship with his peers, parents and other people, as well as the animals and objects that surround them.\" The production was a great example of devised theatre created by the student ensemble Vydýcháno from the Basic School of Arts in Liberec in 2013.\n\nSUMMARY 2022/3\n\nREFLECTIONS-CONCEPTS-CONTEXTS\n\nAnna Hrnečková: Educational Programmes in Professional Czech Theatres – The author of this text presents various forms of workshops that employ drama methods and outlines the history of their use in professional theatres. This area is still rather undeveloped in the Czech Republic, despite the fact that we have been aware of its existence for the past twenty years. In this country, there is still a lot of unused space for research, experimentation and development. Even though these workshops are not always fully acknowledged by theatre makers, the profession of a theatre educator is finally beginning to be hesitantly recognized within the network of Czech theatres. Some of them have established educational departments with several employees and space of their own, offering a wide range of activities and working in close collaboration with the theatre. Nowadays, the following types of educational work is found in professional theatres: workshops related to performances familiarize the viewers with the context of the production, introduce specific theatrical genres or staging principles and last but not least, get the audience excited about the show. Hands-on workshops give participants the chance to learn about various theatrical professions and special components of a production. There are workshops focusing on specific approaches to theatre and theatre history, various themes of performances, etc. A workshop can also be tailored to a specific group and its needs (e. g. a school class). Almost every theatre now offers backstage tours, public discussions and interviews with artists or experts in many fields. It is also common for theatres to organise theatre summer camps for children.\n\nAPPLIED DRAMA-EDUCATION-SCHOOL\n\nTomáš Mohapl Doležal: Towards Teachers' Wellbeing Through Drama Education: Lužánky Invites Teachers to Play – Information about the international project To be or not to be well?, whose participants included drama teachers from Hungary, Great Britain, Poland and the Czech Republic. The aim of the Erasmus+ strategic partnership project was to explore, in collaboration with teachers, how drama can improve the teachers’ satisfaction in their professional and personal lives and thus influence their pupils' well-being in the learning process and consequently also the overall school climate. One of the outputs of the two-year work was the development of methodologies that should help employ the project outcomes directly in classrooms. Yet another output was a survey examining the teachers’ perceptions of their own wellbeing and the possible benefits of drama education.\n\nDRAMA-ART-THEATRE\n\nDominika Prokopová: Stories of Our Neighbours: Documentary Theatre and Drama Education – The project initiated by the Post Bellum organisation called Stories of Our Neighbours is aimed mainly at primary school pupils and their teachers. Its purpose is to draw attention to oral history, to enable students to meet with survivors or witnessess of challenging historical events and to motivate them to research the past of the place they live in. The aim of the project is to find new and attractive ways to get students interested in modern history, especially the 20th century life stories. The opportunity to meet witnesses of the major historical events of our country, to talk to them and ask them questions is a unique experience that awakens in children genuine interest in historical events of that time, which thereby cease to be dead textbook matter and become something tangible and real. Dominika Prokopová joined this project with her drama group and ended up preparing a production with the children about the lives of two communist-era survivors who live in Kladno, the children's home town.\n\nREFLECTIONS-REVIEWS-INFORMATION\n\nAlžběta Ferklová: A Publication on Drama Education for Preschool Children? – The text is a review of a new publication, Drama Lessons for Preschool Children, written by kindergarten teacher Michael Novotný. The reviewer points out the importance of drama education for preschool children by claiming that “preschool age is a time when children enter roles most naturally, an age of spontaneity and endless play taking place in a safe environment, ideally with firm boundaries”. Yet she perceives the new publication to be a missed opportunity. “From the publication it seems that drama with preschool children is just prepared play directed by the teacher that gives children almost no space for playfulness, freedom or even many possibilities of entering a fictional world. It is just playing with children, which certainly has some benefits, but it does not exploit the potential of drama education.” Thus, the reviewer believes, if the book is read by non-professionals who want to get some basic information about the specifics of drama education with preschoolers, it will give them a distorted picture of the field.\n\nART FOR CHILDREN AND YOUTH\n\nMarta Žilková: Nitra Theatrical and Teenage Kids – The Slovak contributor to Tvořivá dramatika (Creative Drama) informs about two interesting productions for teenagers, which were presented at the International Theatre Festival in Nitra in September 2022. The theme of the multimedia “environmental” production When Silence Arises prepared by the Theatre of Nitra is the need for education that teaches respect to nature. The unconventional puppetry production Svetlonos (Carrier of Light) by the Odivo and Ivan Martinka theatre group reflects on the relationship between darkness, light and fear.\n\nAlžběta Rajchlová-Bára Meda Řezáčová-JG Růžička-Jaroslav Provazník-Lucie Šmejkalová: Reviews of new books for children and youth – Reviews of new books for children and youth that might inspire drama teachers and leaders of children's theatre groups.\n\nJaroslav Provazník: Looking back at a book that it would be a shame to forget – In his regular column on books that have been unfairly forgotten, the author writes this time about the book of nonsense poetry To Tramtaria written by the Slovak poet Miroslav Válek. Its Slovak original was published in 1970 and six years later, an outstanding Czech translation was made by Miloslav Topinka. “Topinka's poetics is interestingly in line with Válek’s playful poems, but at the same time the translator subtly shifts their meaning, in particular reinforcing the elements of absurdity. Válek’s poems in Topinka’s translation provoke the imagination; in the best poems, each verse is a detonator that awakens the reader's imagination, assaults them, does not leave them in peace, demands of them constant activity... The poems in this book open paths into the depths of words. And from these 'archaeological' excursions are born stories that take place 'somewhere else', in a free world made of language and our imagination.”\n\nCHILDREN’S STAGE 69\n\nThe text supplement of Tvořivá dramatika brings three scripts of performances put together by three different children's theatre groups, all based on extraordinary adaptations of American fairy tales by Pavel Šrut, published in the book Short Tom and Long Tom and Other Very American Fairy Tales. The first script, The Haunting Truth, was written by Anna Tretiagová, head of the children's theatre group from the Primary Art School in Prague 5, and contains dramatizations of two short fairy tales with horror elements. This production was shown at the national Children's Stage festival in June this year and met with great success. Other fairy tales from the same book by Pavel Šrut were chosen twenty years ago by Jana Štrbová, who led the ensemble at the Primary Art School in Děčín – her production was called A Very American Fairy Tale – and also by Hana Nemravová, a teacher at the Primary Art School in Uherské Hradiště. She dramatized the fairy tale Willy and the Hairy Man. Jaroslav Provazník writes about these and other dramatizations of Šrut's American fairy tales for children's ensembles in his article Šrut's Very American Fairy Tales Brought Onstage by Children. He identifies the main features of Pavel Šrut's adaptations and analyses the ways in which the authors of published scripts have transformed fiction into dramatic form. “It is no wonder that drama teachers and leaders of children's groups often reach for Šrut's adaptations of fairy tales,” says the author. “They are high quality texts that provide teachers with an opportunity to develop children's theatrical skills while at the same time learning about the nature of fairy tales and gaining a humble appreciation for quality literature.\"\n\nSUMMARY 2022/2\n\nREFLECTIONS / CONCEPTS / CONTEXTS\n\nTowards the revisions of the Framework Educational Programme for Basic Education – This document has been prepared by four leading personalities of Czech art education (Silva Macková, Radek Marušák – drama; Eva Blažíčková – dance and movement; Lucie Hlavicová – film and audio-visual education) and expresses their opinion on the preparatory revisions to the national educational curriculum (Framework Educational Programme for Primary Education), specifically on the educational area of Arts and Culture. The members of the expert groups for the Arts and Culture area were surprised that much of what they had prepared for this material has been omitted in the published version. The main issue is the overall concept of arts education and Arts and Culture and the unequal status of various arts fields within it (music and fine arts still have a privileged position in the document, while drama, dance and film education are referred to as additional fields). The authors of the document request that more attention be paid to the area of Arts and Culture when finalising the revision of the Framework Educational Programme for Basic Education.\n\nDRAMA / ART / THEATRE\n\nAnna Hrnečková: Children's Stage 2022 – The article reports on the 50th national children's theatre festival, which finally took place in its full scope after two years marked by the covid pandemic and the associated restrictions. It was held in Svitavy from 10–16 June 2022. The article discusses the common features of the productions presented at the Children's Stage. From a dramaturgical point of view, the most significant issues appear to be the adaptation of prose texts for the stage (and, in connection with this, choosing the genre and transforming the structure of the work), as well as the choice of themes relevant to today's children. Considering these aspects, Anna Hrnečková describes and comments on each performance in detail. An advantage is that the author of the article herself was part of the Children's Stage lecturer's board and every day she prepared reviews of what she had seen for the Children's Stage Diary, recalling the discussions of the lecturer's board with the heads of children's ensembles.\n\nAPPLIED DRAMA / EDUCATION / SCHOOL\n\nEva Dittingerová, Katja Ropret Perne: Theatre-Drama-Education in Budapest – The 29th professional meeting of the Hungarian Drama and Theatre in Education Association (HUDEA, Magyar Drámapedagógiai Társaság, https://drama.hu/) took place on 18–20 November 2021 under the title Theatre-Drama-Education. The event was intended not only for its members, but also for others interested in children's theatre and drama education. The programme included workshops, demonstration lessons, performances, lectures, discussions, professional meetings and a general assembly. The authors of this article attended this event to present the results of the TO BE project together with their Polish partners from the STOP KLATKA association.\n\nAlžběta Rajchlová: Images Come Alive. A Journey into the Painting through the Methods of Drama Education – The text is compiled from parts of the Bachelor's thesis defended at the Department of Educational Drama at the Prague Theatre Faculty in June 2022. The author starts from the premise that there are works of art that are easier for a shy viewer to grasp (figurative works including still life with flowers, portrait, sculpture of a female nude) and works of art that can be tougher to grasp (such as geometrical abstraction or art informel). She looks for ways in which artworks can be interpreted without inhibitions and, in her when work with children, considers intuitive interpretation that can help make the artwork communicable and understandable. She has designed a project that offers space for finding and exploring ways of interpretation in safe classroom environment, with the aim of providing pupils with a sense of freedom in art interpretation. The text also includes a detailed description and reflection on a project that uses the visual arts to stimulate drama activities, and in which at the same time drama methods (role-playing, still-images, voices in the head, subtitling, paraphrasing images through movement, etc.) are used to promote fine arts.\n\nBarbora Gréeová-Pavel Skála: Vltava – Berounka – Confluence – Report on the implementation of a site-specific project, which was realized in cooperation between the Department of Drama in Education and the Department of Alternative and Puppet Theatre of the Prague Theatre Faculty. The intention of the project was to explore the interesting landscape near Prague around the confluence of two rivers Berounka and Vltava and the community of people living there, look at the origins of their roots and traditions and, using primarily the method of oral history, get to know the area. Students collected materials from local narrators and looked for ways of using such material in theatre and drama productions. The students designed an arts and education workshop methodology that should be useful as a resource for working in other localities and schools. The proposed methodology in the form of a lesson for second grade primary school students is part of the article.\n\nPetr Kosek: Drama without Educational Intention in Kindergarten – The author of the article is a student of the doctoral programme in the Institute of Special Education Studies at the Faculty of Education of Palacký University in Olomouc and at the same time a teacher in a kindergarten in Suchonice. He begins his article and reflections on the use of dramatic principles in working with children in kindergarten by describing a situation when one day in kindergarten children spontaneously began to play with darkness and fear that shadows and dark corners caused. In his conception of drama he draws primarily on the theoretical work of B. Way, S. Jennings and D. R. Johnson and characterizes his own teaching style in the field of drama education as “non-conceptual”, one in which he has no predefined educational goals and rather uses the potential of naturally occurring situations. He talks about using and acting out drama as a way of communicating because play is the natural language of children and drama is a type of play that meets needs of children he perceptively observes. He reflects on his position in such situations in two respects: being in the role of the witness (according to J. Grotowski) and in the role of the liminal character, who is on the borderline between the world of drama and reality (according to V. W. Turner). He states that drama does not always have to be conducted with pedagogical intent. Often it is enough for children if the educator is present and available in the moment and follows them to where they need to go.\n\nREFLECTIONS–REVIEWS–INFORMATION\n\nKateřina Řezníčková: Comedies New and Spiritual – The author draws attention to a new book by Magdalena Jacková, a scholar who has long been interested in early modern and neo-Latin (mostly Jesuit) drama. The book deals with a hitherto little explored area of Czech early modern theatre – biblical plays of Bohemian provenance (M. Jacková defining biblical drama as a play with a biblical theme with the exception of Passion, Easter and Christmas plays). The book is the first ever monograph focusing on biblical drama. It is composed of two parts. The first two hundred or so pages are dedicated to the study itself, while the second part contains an edition of four extant Bohemian dramas. Comedies New and Spiritual help to provide a better understanding of the hitherto little-studied period from roughly the mid-sixteenth century to the Thirty Years’ War, a time when plays became a valued part of the school environment and school theatre came to be seen as a useful educational and training tool.\n\nARTS FOR CHILDREN AND YOUTH\n\nGabriela Zelená Sittová: A Fairy Tale as a Living and Moving Mystery. An Interview with Hana Šmahelová – One of the leading figures of Czech literary science, who, among other things, has fundamentally influenced research in the field of folklore and folktales, answers here questions about fairy tales. She describes her research beginnings, when she was attracted to the fairy tale as a special narrative form that has taken root in writing, but at the same time, even in a changing literary context, retains its genetic makeup created in the environment of oral folklore, in the vicinity of myths and a certain magical perception of the world. She reflects on her time spent at the magazine Zlatý máj, where she had a good opportunity to implement the approach of structuralism as described by Vladimir J. Propp in his seminal work Morphology of the Folktale. The interview touches on topics such as the development of the literary folktale, changes in its reception, the importance of the fairy tale for the development of the child's personality and the dissolution of the fairy tale in similar types of stories (in the fantasy genre, in comics, in science fiction, and even in computer games). One of the observations made here is that there is still much to explore in the fairy tale.\n\nMarta Žilková: Ľubomír Feldek – Homo Ludens and Homo Politicus – In her article, Marta Žilková outlines the life and work of Ľubomír Feldek who has recently celebrated his 85th birthday and ranks among the most respected personalities both in Slovakia and the Czech Republic, his activity spanning across many areas in different times and places. He is well known as a poet, author of fiction, translator, playwright and also critic, his writings dealing not only with literary but also social and political themes. M. Žilková focuses here mainly on Ľ. Feldek as a poet whose sense of rhythm, rhyme, metaphor and play of words is reflected also in his fiction and theatre plays. In her opinion, Feldek’s books for children are extraordinary and rightly deserve the international acclaim they have won.\n\nKristina Procházková: Tereza Říčanová and Her Unvarnished Poetic World – This article deals with books made by artist, performer, teacher and farmer Tereza Říčanová. She has received several prestigious awards and nominations for her book projects. The main themes and topics of her work are village life, coexistence with animals, and the annual cycle. According to Kristina Procházková’s assessment, Tereza Říčanová’s books are very authentic and poetically raw, which causes rather varying readers responses to her work. The article gives an overview of Říčanová’s book production from her very successful first title Kozí knížka (The Goat Book) to Kráva Říčanová (The Cow Říčanová), a collection of scenes from the life of the cow Málina and her owner.\n\nLuděk Korbel: Alena Mornštajnová's Books for Children – A summarizing look at the three books for children that Alena Mornštajnová has written so far: Strašák Stráša (Stráša the Scarecrow), Kapka Ája (Ája the Raindrop) and Teribear: the Mystery of the Blue Box. The article is not especially flattering for the established author of novels. The critic notes that while the author has the ability to construct a supporting and believable story for adults, she slips into banality and unambiguity in her books for children. Even the language of these three stories is not convincing. These books confirm the suspicion, Korbel notes, that some authors view children's literature as a kind of respite where all worries must be quickly resolved, which usually gives the story a sense of “sticky” kindness.\n\nGabriela Zelená Sittová-Jaroslav Provazník-Luděk Korbel-Klára Fidlerová-Alžběta Rajchlová-Marta Žilková-Marie Mokrá-Jindřiška Bumerlová: Reviews of new books for children and youth – Reviews of new books for children and youth that might inspire drama teachers and leaders of children's theatre groups.\n\nJaroslav Provazník: Looking back at a book that it would be a shame to forget – In each issue of Tvořivá dramatika, J. Provazník brings one book tip from the recent or distant past that seems to be little known, yet – as he believes – deserves the attention of young readers and their teachers. This time he focuses on the short story collection by Hermína Franková Do Children Pay Half? from 1961.\n\nCHILDREN’S STAGE 68\n\nThe text supplement contains the script of the performance Mon Dieu!, which was presented at the Children's Stage 2022 festival by the ensemble Tři boty (Three Shoes) from the Primary School in Třebotov whose members are children from grades 1–5. The authors of the performance Václava Makovcová and Jana Barnová have woven one whole from three separate French fairy tales: O půlkohoutku a zlém králi (The Half-Cock and the Evil King), O mazaném ševci (The Cunning Cobbler) and Směšná přání (The Funny Wishes). The production is accompanied by French folk songs. The lyrics and sheet music for the songs are included in the supplement. Readers will also find here commentaries written by the ensemble leaders that describe the process leading to the performance as well as the original translations of the fairy tales made by Jan Vladislav and Václav Cibula.\n\nSUMMARY 2022/1\n\nREFLECTIONS / CONCEPTS / CONTEXTS\n\nOndřej Kohout: Edward Bond and his contribution to the theory of drama and drama education – The author recapitulates the basic ideas behind Bond’s understanding of drama and illustrates them with a specific example of the production of The Broken Bowl (2012). However, in his contemplation, he also names the weaknesses of Bond's drama theory. Bond’s plays activate the imagination and should lead the audience to understand contradictions intuitively. According to O. Kohout, such a statement seems unreliable. E. Bond does not explain why our intuition should be infallible against reason. The author points out that in the play The Broken Bowl, some of the characters’ speeches act as proclamatory slogans, and so the whole carefully constructed story suddenly gives the impression of a revolutionary poster. Relating Bond’s ideas to drama education, he reminds us that, despite his reservations about them, it is useful to address them: “Despite criticism, I would like to give clear reasons why it is significant to study Edward Bond. I consider his approach important as he places the current problems of the Western society at the center of drama and education. Educators inspired by him, as well as E. Bond himself, are not indifferent to what is happening in the world. They do not think that everything is all right in the world, nor do they hope that the condition of our society will improve by itself. It is necessary to set committed goals. Edward Bond can inspire us to look for topics that are relevant, provocative and substantive to the development of our society.”\n\nDRAMA / ART / THEATRE\n\nIvana Sobková: Specifics of children’s and student theatre – Essential material about theatre with children, its goals and methodology. I. Sobková is one of the most important leaders of children’s and young theatre groups and teachers of drama in education in the Czech Republic and is currently a teacher at the Dpt. of Drama in Education at the Prague DAMU (Theatre Faculty, Academy of Performing Arts). In her study, she first talks about the pedagogue, who is usually also the director of a children’s or young theater group, and his competencies; then about the children and students, and especially she talks about the issue of acting at different ages and types of children’s acting. The next part of her study deals with the staging process and pays the biggest attention to the devised theatre, which she considers to be the most beneficial for theatre with children and youth. The study concludes with a chapter on several specific productions that were created under the direction of I. Sobková and which were among the most successful at the Czech National Festivals Children Stage and at international festivals.\n\nJan Mrázek: Její pastorkyňa / Jenůfa (Her Stepdaughter) in the theater laboratory: The process of staging Czech rural drama using theatrical-anthropological devices – A student of the master’s programme in Drama in Education at the Prague Theatre Faculty describes the process of creating a production of Gabriela Preissová’s classic Czech play Její pastorkyňa / Jenůfa, which was prepared by drama education students and in which they applied stimulus from Jerzy Grotowski and theatre anthropology.\n\nAPPLIED DRAMA–EDUCATION–SCHOOL\n\nMichaela Bágarová-Radka Fajová-Martina Návratová: Forum Theatre online – Report of three students of the Faculty of Education at the University of Ostrava who, under the guidance of Hana Cisovská and in consultation with Lenka Polánková from Masaryk University in Brno, prepared a forum theatre production on cyberbullying.\n\nREFLECTIONS / REVIEWS / INFORMATION\n\nGabriela Zelená Sittová: Alice in Translation Wonderland – A review of an extraordinary book dealing with four different Czech translations of the classic English book by Lewis Carroll. Its author, Brno-based literary scholar Jiří Rambousek called it From Eliška to Alenka: Four Czech translations of Lewis Carroll’s Alice in Wonderland. The reviewer appreciates this book as original, valuable, and inspiring: “It is a truly adventurous reading not only for those interested in literary translation but also people who are keen on children’s literature or simply passionate about language and its possibilities. On the background of the comparative work, it is fascinating to watch how the Czech translators shaped Alice’s fictional word – born in an entirely different language – with respect to native Czech speakers. Jiří Rambousek comments on what has changed (or even had to change) as well as what got lost in translation. He explains the most striking differences in the four translations, speculating on what might have caused them.”\n\nARTS FOR CHILDREN AND YOUTH\n\nMarta Žilková: Media Christmas 2021 – A report by the Slovak contributor to Tvořivá dramatika (Creative Drama) about television and radio drama programs for children and youth, which were broadcasted at Christmas 2021.\n\nKristina Procházková: “You must not be afraid to watch” – Review of two books by Michael Třeštík on art and architecture, which are intended for children and youth. The first one – Umění vnímat umění pro děti a rodiče (The Art of Perceiving Art for Children and Parents) introduces readers to the history of Czech painting and sculpture from the second half of the 19th century to the present. Umění vnímat architekturu pro děti a rodiče (The Art of Perceiving Architecture for Children and Parents) is a book that is even more extensive and ambitious. On more than three hundred pages, the author takes the reader on a journey through the history of art from prehistoric megalithic buildings to postmodern and hi-tech architecture.\n\nLuděk Korbel: Liščí oči (Fox Eyes): Petra Hůlová’s Attempt at a Book for Youth – A successful Czech author has published her first book for children, in which two siblings go back to 1968 and experience the invasion of Czechoslovakia by the Warsaw Pact armies. L. Korbel considers her attempt to be very problematic, mainly because she suffers from schematism: “All the stereotyping, the urge to pass the younger generation ready-made worldview, stiff heroes as carriers of strangers’ thoughts or factual remarks, or the unbelievable and overly tense plot has seemingly fallen out of novels on which dust rightly falls.”\n\nIrena Konývková: The HOP-HOP ensemble evaluated audiobooks for children – Information about the 3rd issue of the competition for the best audiobook for children, which was evaluated by children from the HOP-HOP theater group from Ostrov.\n\nGabriela Zelená Sitová-Luděk Korbel-Anna Hrnečková-Lucie Šmejkalová-Klára Fidlerová-Jindřiška Bumerlová-Marta Žilková: Reviews of New Books and Performances for Children and Youth – Reviews of new books and performances for children and youth that might inspire drama teachers and leaders of children's theater groups.\n\nJaroslav Provazník: Looking Back on Books that Should not Be Forgotten – The author draws attention to Bohumil Říha’s forgotten book O rezavém rváči a huňatém pánovi (About the Rusty Brawler and the Bushy Lord) from 1971, which could also be an inspiration for the leaders of children's theater groups.\n\nDramadiary for drama teachers and lecturers\n\nCHILDREN STAGE 67\n\nThe text appendix to Creative Drama contains a script by Ivana Sobková, the author of the study Specifics of children’s and student theatre, A bullhorn or On the lying newspaper vendor Bohoušek, based on a fairy tale by a Czech author Vladimír Neff. The production was part of the program of the Czech National Festival Children Stage in 2010. The script is enhanced with methodological and dramaturgical notes by the author and the group director.\n\nSUMMARY 2021/3\n\nREFLECTIONS / CONCEPTS / CONTEXTS\n\nMartin Sedláček: Where Does Meaning Come From? The theory of embodied simulation in the learning process. Psychologist Martin Sedláček, a teacher at the Dpt. of Drama in Education at the Prague Theatre Faculty, introduces here the main thoughts presented in the book by Benjamin K. Bergen Louder Than Words: The New Science of How the Mind Makes Meaning published in 2012. He believes Bergen’s findings to be of great importance for drama teachers. „It becomes obvious that personal experience is crucial for the formation of meaning. The more we have seen, heard, felt, created and experienced, the more ,building blocks‘ our brain will have at its disposal in order to put together entirely new contents through simulation.“ He goes on to add: “Drama education has a major advantage. Within dramatic activities students are active to the point of physically entering the various situations. They act, which means gathering experience. Through its numerous exercises, drama education enhances the students’ ability to ,simulate‘. We can thus also assume that drama education leads participants to develop their capacity to create meaning.“\n\nLuděk Korbel: How Far is „Nearby“: A reader’s commentary to the book Louder Than Words – A doctoral student from the Dpt. of Drama in Education at Theatre Faculty in Prague who also teaches literature at a secondary school in the south-Bohemian town of Milevsko, complements the previous article by a few commentaries based on his practical experience. He considers Bergen’s book very inspiring both for drama education and the teaching of literature. „It is obvious that cognitive science has completely upended (or confirm) the hitherto valid approaches of literary theoreticians which, simply said, were just theories. In the past one hundred years, great attention has been paid not only to the literary text but also to the reader.“\n\nDRAMA / ART / THEATRE\n\nEma Zámečníková: Stage Reading: Several Theoretical and Practical Observations – In September 2021, the author of this article led a seminar on stage reading in the East-Bohemian town of Jičín as part of the 25th national workshop Drama in School. She begins by defining what stage reading is and explains how it differs from reciting on the one hand, and from theatre on the other. In her opinion, in stage reading the reading aspect prevails but it can be enriched by reciting or certain theatrical elements depending on the target group and the purpose of the reading. It goals include motivating people to read a certain book, bringing children to libraries, introducing an author, motivating children to try creative writing, helping starting authors or drawing attention to interesting translations. In its second part, the article provides advice and tips concerning means of expression that can be utilized in preparing a stage reading.\n\nGabriela Zelená Sittová: Reciting and Speech Coaching as Part of Drama Education – One of the specifics of the Czech drama in education is the level of attention it pays to poetry reciting. Despite this fact, the Czech educational system does not include this discipline into the national curriculum. It is only the Basic Schools of Arts and interest groups that train children in poetry reciting on a more systematic basis. Yet poetry reciting might be a significant enrichment to the teaching of literature. G. Zelená Sittová, who dealt with this topic in her dissertation presented last year at the Faculty of Theatre in Prague, discusses the importance of reciting in the lives of children and youth as well as the methodology of working with young reciters on a step-by-step basis, from choosing a suitable text all the way to reciting it loud in front of an audience.\n\nAPPLIED DRAMA–EDUCATION–SCHOOL\n\nMarica Harčaríková: On the Right Track – Information on a project held in June 2020 in the Slovak town of Vranov nad Topľou. Its aim was to support inclusion in education and show how drama education with its techniques can enhance the results and competences even in pupils from low socio-economic background.\n\nMarica Harčaríková: Ťapákovci – The script of a workshop led by Marica Harčaríková within the above-mentioned project uses excerpts from the short story Ťapákovci written by the Slovak female writer Timrava who lived at the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries and about whom Slovak children learn in their literature classes. The lesson demonstrated to the workshop participants included surprisingly up-to-date topics drawn from the novella, namely dealing with differences, social exclusion and accepting individuals who do not comply with mainstream.\n\nREFLECTIONS–REVIEWS–INFORMATION\n\nEva Machková: Modern Didactics – A review of the book Modern Didactics, subtitled Lexicon of Teaching and Assessment Methods, in which its author Robert Čapek criticises the level of preparation of new teachers and the lack of practice during their studies. E. Machková agrees with his criticism in part, but she finds the book he offers to teachers extremely problematic. According to the reviewer, the book is chaotically arranged, and many of the entries are superficial and inaccurate. She calls the book a \"hypermarket of didactics\" designed to serve the \"consumer\" teacher, because it does not lead to thinking about didactics. \"What Robert Čapek tried to write in his book would have made several publications, all of them very substantial. Provided, of course, that it was all based on a good knowledge of what the author describes. Unfortunately,\" concludes E. Machková, \"in this case, it has failed.\"\n\nARTS FOR CHILDREN AND YOUTH\n\nHelena Zbudilová: Story in School and Leisure-Time Classes – A teacher from the Department of Pedagogy at the Theological Faculty of the South-Bohemian University in Budweis points out the crucial role that stories play in our lives and shows how important they are in education and upbringing. To prove her point, she analyses the various ways the biography of Comenius is treated in several books for children and youth.\n\nKristina Procházková: How to Paint a Good Book on Art? – A review of a quality book dealing with the life and oeuvre of the Czech painter Josef Šíma called How to Paint an Egg? Although Josef Šíma is a painter of international acclaim, most of today’s teenagers would probably not find his work very inspiring or understand it. Yet the authors, Silvie Šeborová (who wrote the text) and the visual artist Jiří Franta, succeeded in creating a book attractive both in terms of its contents and visuals, which has a chance of captivating the readers’ interest. Thanks to the book How to Paint an Egg? (an egg being an important motive that often appears in Šíma’s paintings), a dry encyclopaedic entry turns into a story of a real person. The authors enable the readers to “experience” the main events of the 20th century, see them through the painter’s eyes and thus also come to understand his artistic language.\n\nJana Cindlerová: Hamlet and the Radost Theatre on the Road – A review of an original staging of Shakespeare’s classic play in the puppet theatre Radost in Brno. According to the reviewer, the performance Hamlet on the Road directed by a Polish guest director Joanna Zdrava, seems to indicate a change brought about by the new management of the theatre.\n\nLuděk Korbel-Jiří G. Růžička-Marie Mokrá-Jindřiška Bumerlová-Jaroslav Provazník: Reviews of New Books and Performances for Children and Youth – Reviews of new books and performances for children and youth that might inspire drama teachers and leaders of children’s theatre groups.\n\nJaroslav Provazník: Looking Back on Books that Should not Be Forgotten – The author of this column draws the readers’ attention to the outstanding collections of poetry for children that their author, Czech poet Ladislav Dvořák, published in the 1960s and the early 1970s before the communist regime banned his works. He says: „Whereas Dvořák’s collections of short stories as well as his poetry books for adults have reached the literary audience after the Velvet Revolution (even as part of the collected works), no publishing house has shown interested in his books for children during the past thirty years. That is a shame because they certainly deserve to be read and recited.“\n\nCHILDREN’S STAGE 66\n\nThe text supplement of Tvořivá dramatika brings three dramatizations of children’s tales written by the Italian author Gianni Rodari. The first two – Troubles with the Television and Poor Ghosts – were staged by the groups from the Basic School of Arts in Brandýs and Labem led by Irina Ulrychová. Both scripts are accompanied by a brief dramaturgic and methodological note on the evolution of the dramatizations. The third script – The Path that Led Nowhere – was written by the actress Mirka Vydrová as early as the late 1980s as a challenge established in the process of searching for her own theatrical concept carried out through improvisations.\n\nSUMMARY 2021/2\n\nREFLECTIONS–CONCEPTS–CONTEXTS\n\nAnna Hogenová: Aesthetic Education and its Purpose – In dealing with the topic, the author of this article relies on philosophical terms and concepts defined by prominent philosophers throughout centuries, beginning with ancient Greece and ending with the present time. She builds on those to explicate her belief that aesthetics is essential to human life, basing it on the presumption that beauty is a sensory emanation of the good (aisthesis) and that humans need to fell acceptance (communio), which, however, is what people miss most in the modern world where the value of a person is judged mostly by his or her achievement. Professor Hogenová points out the danger implicit in the contemporary American neo-Marxist school of thought, which leads to activism striving to cancel Greek and Latin departments at American universities or ban lectures on the history of philosophy, all this on a misleading interpretation of racism. This, in her opinion, leads to a modern version of a nominalist defining of essences, which is the main source of the digital, “pointing” thinking stemming from modern computer philosophy. Yet it is precisely this digital way of thinking that deprives us of life’s heights and depths, the vertical in thinking, mystery, imagination as well as the awareness of the origins of humanity. Art facilitated through aesthetic education is nowadays one of the few remaining means enabling people to return to their own whole selves because in making and experiencing art, one lives in the present moment. This is why, the author emphasizes, we need to introduce aesthetic education into schools because it helps to awaken holistic humanity. We need communio, we need cordiality.\n\nDRAMA-ART-THEATRE\n\nIrina Ulrychová: The Show Goes on Against All Odds… – A member of the jury at the 49th Children’s Stage, the national festival of children’s theatre held from 11 to 13 June 2021 in the town of Svitavy, reports on this year’s festival which, due to the epidemic situation in the Czech Republic, had to be cancelled last year. This year also saw major complication in the preparatory phase, which is why the reporter calls the live event of the festival, which could happen in the end, “a little big miracle”. Unlike previous years, the theatrical part of the festival lasted only two days and only five troops participated in it – those who had performed at the local rounds of the festival either live or by means of a pre-recorded performance. The report also mentions the festival journal, Deník Dětské scény (Journal of the Children’s Stage), which was published under the experienced editorial supervision of Josef Pekárek in the electronic form (including audio features). It can be found on the website www.drama.cz.\n\nEma Zámečníková: A Report on the 49th National Festival and Workshop of Children’s Poetry Reciting Held in Svitavy – Another jury member wrote a report concerning the poetry reciting category of the festival, which lasted three days as usual. She believes it met its aim fully, being an inspiring encounter of professionals, teachers, students, parents and other people interested in children’s poetry reciting. For children’s reciters, this event serves as encouragement and support, showing them that they are not alone in their striving. The reporter points out problems occurring in the local rounds, which had to be held online for the most part. Although the national finale also had to comply with a lot of health regulations, the organizers managed to provide even the usual workshop including discussions with jury members. Children’s reciters were able to participate in a seminar called Where and how to find suitable poetry for reciting led by Gabriela Zelená Sittová. In conclusion, the reporter mentions a special ceremony taking place as part of the festival programme: Irena Konývková, leader of the HOP-HOP ensembles from Ostrov, received the Ministry of Culture Award for the Lifelong Contribution to Children’s Theatre, Poetry Reciting and Drama Education.\n\nLeah Gaffen: Unmuted – The leader of the Prague-based Story Theatre describes a staging process that was taking place during the spring of 2021 on the Zoom online platform. The performance presented the theme of women (though not exclusively them) who are “muted” both in life and on Zoom. Working with selected female characters from Shakespeare’s plays setting them into the context of a competition called Poet’s Beauties (the moderator was calling up the competing „beauties“, asking them to speak or, on the contrary, “muted” some of them and made decision on their behalf). The performance was conceived as a celebration of sisterhood and introduced not only women perceived as “traditional” but also ones exceeding the conventional categories of femininity (such as the gender-unspecified witches). These themes turned up in the course of the creative process and were initiated by the children themselves (many group members have one or both American parents and are thus familiar with the great impact of the #MeToo movement.) While Leah Gaffen admits to the limitations and specifics of online work, she goes on to point out some of its unexpected advantages such as being able to see the facial expressions of actors from close-up, experiment with different angles of the camera, incorporate the little Zoom “windows” into the performance or invite spectators from all over the world. Thanks to the online form of rehearsing, Leah Gaffen was able to invite a guest, the New York based actor and former leader of children’s theatre groups Jay DeYonker. The performance was shown twice (link: https://youtu.be/bNPNNORGVrY) and Leah Gaffen concludes her report by expressing her belief that the performance was the right choice for the children given the circumstances, opening up new themes and perspectives to them.\n\nAPPLIED DRAMA-EDUCATION-SCHOOL\n\nEva Dittingerová, Veronika Rodová: At the End of the Labyrint – In this article, the two authors look back on Labyrint, a drama centre and a branch of the leisure-time centre Lužánky in Brno. The studio was closed in the spring of 2020 as part of the pandemic measures. This was, however, done without a clear vision or communication of where its activity should be heading after re-opening. The continuity of Labyrint as a place where drama education and amateur theatre had been cultivated on professional basis since its establishment in 1996 thus ended abruptly after three decades of thoughtful planning and concept building. The article recollects the whole range of the studio’s activities, quoting several professionals who appraise Labyrint as an exceptional venture in the field of drama education. Silva Macková, head of the Theatre and Education Studio at JAMU in Brno, who was among the founders of Labyrint, writes here about its very origins. In 1968, having visited the Redbridge Drama Centre in London together with the PIRKO theatre group, she started to work on the concept of a broadly conceived drama centre back home in Czechoslovakia. Taking this historical perspective into account, she poses the question of what would happen next to the Labyrint studio. The article is complemented by a 1987 text written by Silva Macková and Dana Svozilová under the title Project of the Drama Centre, which demonstrates how systematic and complex the concept of Labyrint as a “drama education station” had been.\n\nMichaela Váňová: The Art (of Being) in Hospital: Looking into Drama and Performance Activities for Patients – The article maps various types of theatrical activities that take place in Czech hospitals. Its author begins by listing the most common ones (theatre groups or solo actors visiting hospitals, the Puppets in Hospitals project, hospital clowning etc.) and continues by outlining new possible ways in which art might enter the hospital setting. She draws on her own experience from two hospitals, which she has been visiting as a volunteer actress with a solo performance called Where the Ocean Ends and played at the patients’ bedsides. Viewing the issue from the perspective of a doctoral student of the Theory and Practice of Drama Education at DAMU in Prague, she elaborates on her belief that art can reduce stress and pain and facilitate powerful interpersonal encounters. She points out that the effort to enhance the patients’ quality of life by exposing them to art is what most arts-in-healthcare programs have in common. Although the forms and artistic means are manifold, they all pursue the same goal. M. Váňová focuses on activities of theatrical and performing nature, suggesting what theatre makers and drama teachers can do to introduce performing arts to hospital patients in a meaningful and enriching way.\n\nIvana Pintířová: Drama Education and Adults – A current student of the doctoral programme Theory and Practice of Drama Education at DAMU in Prague describes her long journey of working with adults. It started by her leading retreats for religion teachers within the Roman Catholic Church back in the 1990s, in which she tried to employ elements of drama education. Later she also began to work with Sunday school teachers from the Czech Brethren Evangelical Church, thus focusing on target groups that, for the purpose of her article, she calls pedagogical. However, Ivana Pintířová has also worked with common parishioners, often including elderly people; she calls these interest groups. More and more often, she observes in this article, she finds herself facing adults with no previous experience with drama work. Besides, she bases her drama activities on stories from the Bible, the most precious and revered text source for the Christians, which poses rather specific challenges. Her article is a proof of well-thought pedagogical work (discussing issues such the teacher’s respect to the given specifics, age characteristics ranging from young adulthood all the way to old age, participants’ motivation, specifics of the target group of Christian believers and using the Bible as a source of motives, demands on the teacher’s personality and approach, suitability of methods, etc.) It also provides valuable insight as far as introducing drama education into unusual and rather specific settings is concerned. I. Pintířová then goes on to describe her experience from various seminars aimed both at the pedagogical and interest groups, where has ventured to fully incorporate drama methods into working with adult groups, using biblical stories as the starting point. She also describes a rather special experience, which consisted in her doing drama work on biblical characters in authentic places in Israel.\n\nPetr Kosek: Neuro-dramatic Play and Embodiment–Projection–Role: Two paradigms developing drama education in kindergarten – Building on two development paradigms (neuro-dramatic play and embodiment) conceived by the drama therapist and play therapist Sue Jennings, the author of this article deals with drama education as the main method used in structured group work in kindergarten. He explains the two above-mentioned paradigms, discusses their relationship to pedagogical work in pre-school groups and illustrates the theoretical concepts by describing his week-long project Hansel and Gretel carried out with a group of ten to sixteen kindergarten children aged 3–5.\n\nREFLECTIONS–REVIEWS–INFORMATION\n\nMarta Žilková: The History of the Slovak Puppet Theatre – In her review, Marta Žilková expresses great appreciation of the achievement made by the authors of this respectable 856-page-long publication that the professional public had been waiting for many years. The book represents a huge bulk of material looking back on the history of Slovak puppet theatre both in broad perspective and in minute detail. The team of authors included theatre historians, dramaturgists, directors, actors, visual artists and musicians and was led by the prominent theoretician and participant of Slovak puppet theatre Vladimír Predmerský. The book, which the reviewer finds to be conceived in a comprehensive and well-organized manner, not only bears witness to the vitality of this kind of theatre but also shows how important it has been for the evolution of patriotic sentiments and cultural confidence of the Slovak nation. The reviewer briefly introduces the contents of each of the book’s chapters (organized chronologically by major historical milestones), pointing out in several places that the history of Slovak puppet theatre is inseparable from the history of its Czech counterpart.\n\nJana Cindlerová: Seventeen Fairy-Tales – This review pays attention to the collection of scripts for puppet theatre (Seventeen Fairy Tales: Texts for Puppets) issued as a special supplement to the Czech puppeteering magazine Loutkář. The collection was published as a response to the demand of theatre groups for original plays and drama texts intended primarily for puppet theatre. By putting this collection together, its editors also meant to demonstrate that the puppeteering scene boasts a number of quality and inspiring scripts and playwrights. What all the included texts have in common is that they have been successful on stage and that their authors are outstanding personalities of professional or amateur puppet theatre.\n\nARTS FOR CHILDREN AND YOUTH\n\nKristina Procházková: Re-Discovered Pioneers of Czech Pop-Up Books – The author of this article begins by stating that the past few years have seen a boom of books with pop-up elements, loopholes and various interactive features. She points out that Czech pop-up books have had long tradition, becoming renowned all over the world thanks to two outstanding artists, Rudolf Lukeš and Vojtěch Kubašta. In her article, she makes readers acquainted with their book projects and the re-editions of those made by the Albatros publishing house together with the Brno branch of B4U.\n\nKristina Procházková: Daddy's Passion Was Film Set Design – Interview with Rudolf Lukeš' daughter about his life and work.\n\nAnna Hrnečková: Recent Audiobooks for Children and Youth – A member of the Czech Audiobook of the Year jury, Anna Hrnečková takes a look at the current offer of audiobooks on the market, which she finds rather broad and diverse. Mentioning the ever-growing demand for audiobooks, she also notices the accompanying phenomenon, namely that besides a greater number of outstanding audiobooks, there are also many titles of dubious quality. She provides a list of Czech websites dealing with audiobooks including an internet magazine publishing professional reviews and the outcomes of important surveys, Audiobook of the Year and Bystrouška (Keen Ears) for the best children’s audiobook.\n\nLuděk Korbel-Lucie Šmejkalová-Jaroslav Provazník-Matěj Hájek-Marta Žilková: Reviews of New Books and Performances for Children and Youth – Reviews of new books and performances for children and youth that might inspire drama teachers and leaders of children’s theatre groups.\n\nJaroslav Provazník: Looking Back on Books that Should not Be Forgotten – In each issue of Tvořivá dramatika, this section brings a tip concerning a book, author or the whole edition that deserves the attention of young readers and their teachers. This time, Jaroslav Provazník writes about the book Chlapcův kouzelný roh (The Boy’s Magic horn: Old German Songs). It is a selection of texts from a three-volume collection put together by Achim von Arnim and Clemens Brentano in 1806–1808. Another reason why this book should not be forgotten is its excellent Czech translation made by Jindřich Pokorný. The book was published by Odeon in 1980 as part of the high-quality edition Lidové umění slovesné (Folklore Art).\n\nCHILDREN’S STAGE 65\n\nThis time, the text supplement brings the script called Soví zpěv (Owl’s Singing) written by Pavel Skála, a teacher of drama and literature at the F. L. Gassman Basic School of Arts in Most, which is a dramatization of the eponymous book by Iva Procházková that Pavel Skála staged with a group of adolescent actors. As Jana Soprová points out in her article The Moment when Humanity Returns, Pavel Skála successfully managed to dramatize the moving story of a seventeen-year-old student (set around the middle of the 21st century in the city of Bremen afflicted by flood) using simple but powerful theatrical means. The supplement also contains Pavel Skála’s note on the evolution of this piece of devised theatre.\n\nSUMMARY 2021/1\n\nREFLECTIONS–CONCEPTS–CONTEXTS\n\nEva Machková: Creativity and Art at School – This time, Eva Machková begins her reflection on Czech curricular documents and the concept of art subjects by stating that in watching TV many people are not quite able to distinguish between reality and fiction. This is because in television programmes the line between reality and fiction is blurred to a much greater extent than in theatre or cinema. This is why schools should make it their goal to educate students in the issue of perceiving art. A doyen of the methodology of drama education in the Czech Republic Eva Machková examines here the ministerial document called Framework Education Programme, taking note of what space it allots to art education and whether the various art subjects have a chance to effectively address the children in order to meet the outlined goals. She looks at music, visual arts, drama and literature but also pays attention to elements of film, multimedia and dance in the curriculum, the position of the last three quite disadvantaged despite the fact that the current world calls for a shift in focus. E. Machková is rather critical of the way in which key competences are formulated and elaborated on in the Framework Education Programme. To quote her words, “the document is rather short-sighted in that it fails to understand what it is saying […] Despite the best intentions with which the document was conceived, the implementation is based on stereotypes rather than the stated intentions and goals. The Framework was supposed to lead schools to a modern concept of education, but the implementation betrays helplessness, lack of orientation and an almost total failure to understand the non-rational, unique nature of viewing the world through art.“\n\nAPPLIED DRAMA-EDUCATION-SCHOOL\n\nBára Meda Řezáčová: Elements of Drama in Dealing with Canonical Literary Works in Secondary School – The author of this article discusses the issue of canonical literary works at secondary schools. She believes the teachers themselves should first make an effort to search for meaning and benefit in the works before presenting them to their students. She focuses on two iconic works of Czech literature, namely the poem Máj (May) by Karel Hynek Mácha and the novella Babička (Grandmother) by Božena Němcová. She suggests ways of interpreting these two works in such a manner that students would not only understand their importance in literary history but also get deeper into the texts and find purpose in the search for themes and in their interpretation. Using drama methods, Bára Meda Řezáčová looks for ways of “justifying” the inclusion of these two works, which students tend to perceive as unpopular, in the secondary school curriculum and finding new attraction in them. She has designed lessons dealing with these iconic works by K. H. Mácha and B. Němcová, which she based on a thorough and innovative interpretation of the works, putting emphasis on themes that students are likely to relate to and that have a potential to motivate them for further reading.\n\nMarta Žilková: Parody or Reality? – Taking the Daddies serial airing on the Slovak Markíza TV channel as the starting point for her musing on the dismal situation in Slovak education, M. Žilková expresses her concern about the potential drawbacks of remote online learning that schools had to resort to as the only means of educating students. She points out that we should not forget about the benefits that school attendance offers to children beyond the mere acquisition of educational contents, such as creating a milieu for interpersonal relationships and providing live contact with competent and enthusiastic teachers.\n\nDRAMA-ART-THEATRE\n\nDominika Prokopová: COVIDíš?! – The article describes the foundations, concept, progress and outcomes of the COVIDíš?! project that came into being within an urban summer camp taking place at the Lampion Theatre in the Central Bohemian town of Kladno during the second half of July 2020. Dominika Prokopová, the author of this article, works there as a teacher of drama. Together with her colleague Vojtěch Lőffelmann, she decided to use the time between two lockdowns to respond to the current situation caused by the Chinese virus and the safety measures taken to inhibit its spreading. They did so by putting together a theatrical record of how children from the Kladno region perceived and lived through the lockdown. Within the one-week theatrical project (5 days, 8 hours a day) there was enough time to turn the work into a small theatrical piece. Yet, as the workshop could not be followed up by systematic theatrical work, its outcome was shared with the audience in the form of a work in progress.\n\nREFLECTIONS–REVIEWS–INFORMATION\n\nJaroslav Provazník: Obliging the Child. A Challenge for Czech Theoreticians of Literature for Children and Youth – The reviewer strongly appreciates the fact that the editors of the Theoretical Library series (issued by the Host publishing house together with the Institute of Czech Literature at the Czech Academy of Sciences) decided to enrich their editorial plan by a title dealing with literature for children and youth. In his opinion, it is a kind of book that had long been missing because it facilitates various theoretical views of literature for children and youth that have emerged in the English-speaking countries during the past fifty years or so. He agrees with the series editor Jana Segi Lukavská who claims that in the last few decades, the Czech theory of children’s literature has not taken much inspiration from the English-speaking world. Jaroslav Provazník comments on each of the contributions in the anthology, pinpointing several of them as especially inspiring, for instance those that work with the concepts of implied reader and focalisation. He considers the whole of the anthology to be somewhat unbalanced in quality but appreciates the fact that it is equipped with an extensive commentary at the end as well as information on authors, a bibliography and an index. In his commentary, J. Provazník refers to the Czech theoretical periodical on literature for children Zlatý máj published across the span of the 1960s all the way to the 1980s, which included interesting contributions to the theory of children literature. He expresses his hope that the anthology might incite activity among Czech theoreticians in the field and that it might not remain the only translation venture of this kind.\n\nARTS FOR CHILDREN AND YOUTH\n\nLuděk Korbel: On Vojtěch Matocha’s Trilogy – The author of this article takes a closer look at the popular trilogy on a mysterious fictitious Prague neighbourhood called Prašina, which has been immensely successful both with readers and the majority of critics. Luděk Korbel tries to put its popularity aside and take a more critical look at the trilogy, striving to answer the question whether the stories really meet the expectations and standards of quality adventure reading for youngsters or if the series is just a fad that will pass. He arrives at the conclusion that despite the enthusiastic reactions by readers, the work has a number of flaws related to the chosen narrator’s perspective, the development of the storyline as well as the overall construction of the fictitious world including rather poor depicting of the main characters’ inner worlds, which borders on indifference where the side characters are concerned.\n\nHana Nemravová: Keen Ears in Uherské Hradiště: The Prize for the Best Children’s Audiobook – Since 2018, the Association of Audiobook Publishers and the Creative Drama Association have jointly been awarding the prize for the best audiobooks for children. (The prize contest has been called Bystrouška in allusion to the Cunning Little Vixen, whose name means Keen Ears.) The jury consists of children who not only rate the audiobooks but also decide on their own evaluation criteria. The jury members are usually recruited from among children with some experience in drama education. In 2019, the responsibility was given to the children from the drama group at Basic School of Arts in Uherské Hradiště. The present article describes the whole process, in which 150 children supervised by four teachers chose three audiobooks to be awarded the prize, one in each category (the first aimed at children aged 4–6, the next at kids aged 7–11, and the last at the age category12+).\n\nMarta Žilková: Battle of Good and Evil: The TV and Radio Christmas Programmes – In her article, Marta Žilková takes a critical look at the new TV and radio programmes for children that were premiered in Slovakia (and, in case of TV programmes, also in the Czech Republic) at Christmas 2020. As far as television is concerned, she pays attention to two fairy-tale stories made in coproduction of Czech and Slovak Television: O léčivé vodě (The Healing Water), and O vánoční hvězdě (The Christmas Star). She describes the plots of both and focuses mainly on their strengths. Then she goes on to look at the Slovak radio programmes broadcasted at Christmas time. Here she also draws the readers’ attention to several programmes of quality, such as the adaptation of Quo vadis by Henryk Sienkiewicz or La Torta in Celo by Gianni Rodari, as well as two fairy-tale dramatizations, The Twelve Months and The Tinderbox by H. C. Andersen.\n\nAnna Hrnečková-Luděk Korbel-Jiří G. Růžička-Lucie Šmejkalová-Jindřiška Bumerlová-Gabriela Zelená Sittová-Jaroslav Provazník: Peeping into Books for Children and Youth – Reviews of new books for children and youth that might inspire drama teachers and leaders of children’s theatre groups.\n\nJaroslav Provazník: Looking Back at Books that Should Not Be Forgotten – The article makes the readers acquainted with the second edition of On Nothing, a long-forgotten thin picture book written in 1965 by the Czech actor Vlastimil Brodský and illustrated by artist Jan Brychta. It is the only children’s book for that V. Brodský wrote. The title On Nothing is somewhat misleading, for in fact, as J. Provazník writes, “the book deals with many things that are essential in life such as human understanding or the importance of play and playfulness. It says that every person needs to experience happiness, if only for a moment, and that it does not require much – often no more than the ability to listen and accept the other.“ On Nothing is not just any ordinary picture book; it may well be the first genuine Czech bilderbuch, or certainly one of the first .\n\nCHILDREN’S STAGE 64\n\nThe text supplement of Tvořivá dramatika contains three scripts written by Vojtěch Maděryč, a drama teacher and director of the Basic School of Arts in Jindřichův Hradec. They are intended for the youngest childrens who have just started to attend the literary-drama lessons (age 7–9). The scripts pertain to the performances O sedmi bratřích ve studni (Seven Brothers in a Well, a dramatization of an eponymous story in Henri Pourrat’s version), Jakub a dvě stě dědečků (Jacob and One Hundred Granfathers, a dramatization of a story by Miloš Macourek) and Where Wild Things Are (a dramatization of the picture book by Maurice Sendak). The scripts are accompanied by notes provided by the experienced and perceptive teacher Vojtěch Maděryč who describes here the staging process or, to be more precise, the work with children during the lessons, which culminated in performances shown to an audience after a period of literary and drama work.\n\nSUMMARY 2020/3\n\nREFLECTIONS–CONCEPTS–CONTEXTS\n\nOndřej Kohout: Ideological Thinking Versus Drama Education – The article is a response to the book written by David Davis, Imagining the Real (2014), whose author takes a critical stance towards today’s neoliberal world view. In his opinion, this outlook has major impact on education, which subsequently becomes a tool in the hand of an ideology, and as such stops posing questions that might lead to the gradual deconstruction of the neoliberal thinking. Davis shows how money affects even helping professions and non-profit fields (healthcare system, education and culture all finding themselves under financial pressures). The only possible way he can think of to save education and the society is disrupting the pervasive ideological perspective. Same as D. Davis, the author of this article poses the question whether it is possible to step out of ideological thinking and use drama education to deconstruct the neoliberal thinking patterns and concepts. However, O. Kohout takes a step further by asking whether drama education should in fact be expected to fight any type of ideology. He shows how D. Davis tends to interpret neoliberalism, which he so ardently criticizes, from a markedly left-wing perspective. In place of this, O. Kohout tries to offer an ideology-free interpretation of the relationship between drama and all sorts of ideologies, leaning mainly on the concept of drama education promoted by Jonothan Neelands and Gavin Bolton.\n\nAPPLIED DRAMA-EDUCATION-SCHOOL\n\nEva Machková: As Many Languages You Know... – In this article, Eva Machková elaborates on her belief that the basic problem of language learning in the Czech educational system is that we are still discovering what countries such as the Netherlands or Sweden have known for a long time, namely that the best way to learn a foreign language is in an environment where one depends on using the language. She has been gathering information on theses, projects and teachers who deal with applying drama methods to foreign language teaching. The following four articles describing specific examples of such work represent the first result of her ongoing research.\n\nDana Hlavatá: Teaching German at Secondary School: A Few Inspiring Notes – This article summarizes its author’s experience with teaching German gathered all the way from teaching at a primary school where she experimented using a puppet in language instruction, all the way to her manifold activities carried out mainly at the F. X. Šalda Secondary School in Liberec (lively over-the-border contact with German students, mini projects, debating), which teacher trainees from the Faculty of Education in Olomouc had a chance to observe.\n\nMartin Šíp: The Twelve Months – This sample lesson is a part of a larger primary school project; its topic is Weather. Before designing specific drama-based activities, the teacher had carefully identified and formulated his educational goals related to both drama and English.\n\nSoňa Demjanovičová: The Tiger Who Came to Tea – The next sample lesson of English intended for children from 3rd to 5th grade of primary school is based on the book The Tiger Who Came to Tea written by Judith Kerr in 1968. Its structure and contents reflect careful and conscious balance and overlap between the linguo-didactic approach on the one hand, and the drama-in-education aspects on the other.\n\nMichaela Váňová: A Lesson Does not Have to be Perfect, but it Should be Genuine: One of Possible Ways of Looking at a Drama Lesson – During her first academic year as a teacher of drama at the Faculty of Education of the Charles University in Prague, M. Váňová never heard students ask about the purpose and aims of drama in education but noticed a great deficiency in their drama projects: the inability to formulate goals and objectives and use them in lesson planning. After detailed inquiring about the goals and objectives of students’ model lessons she found out that 64 out of 75 students had no idea how to formulate them. The vast majority of students go about the task by first designing a lesson; only later they attempt, with the help of field literature or the educational framework, to find some goals “that the lesson is likely to meet”. In her article, M. Váňová returns to the purpose of educational goals and explains what kind of questions she makes her students ask themselves every time they are designing a lesson: What is the point of the lesson? What do I want the kids to get from it? Why do I want to teach this or that using drama methods? What do I need to ensure that the kids really receive what I intend them to receive? How will I know whether or not my intention has been fulfilled?\n\nDRAMA-ART-THEATRE\n\nMariana Čížková: The Limitations Lie in Us – The editors have decided to publish this purposely provocative article with the aim of stirring debate within the wider professional community. A graduate of the Department of Alternative and Puppet Theatre and presently a doctoral student at the Faculty of Theatre in Prague, the author of the article Mariana Čížková shares the observations and notions gathered during her study trip to Berlin. She describes her visit to the Volksbühne theatre and goes into detail presenting the activities of Deutsches Theater aimed at children and youth (she also personally met with the theatre’s dramaturge Birgit Lengers). The theatre’s activities include professional performances for children’s audiences, spring camps led by professional theatre makers, a youth club where children can rehearse plays, an offer of professional performances played by children for the public, etc. M. Čížková believe the concept of youth theatre (Jugendstheater), as she experienced it in in Germany, might greatly inspire Czech drama education and theatre with children. She disputes the notion that an overly professional approach may manipulate children to experience or perform age-inappropriate themes (the “overly professional approach” referring to children being led and shaped by acting professionals as opposed to drama-in-education specialists).\n\nREFLECTIONS–REVIEWS–INFORMATION\n\nGabriela Zelená Sittová: Czech for Foreigners on Stage – The linguo-didactic monograph reviewed here was written by Marie Boccou Kestřánková, an experienced teacher of Czech for foreigners, and published by the Karolinum publishing house in 2019 under the title Jevištní tvar jako jedna z možných metod výuky češtiny pro cizince (Theatre making as a method of teaching Czech to foreigners). The reviewer finds the book unique within the field of Czech as a foreign language, as its author presents in it her own, long-t"
