The first mystery is why the Oilers thought they needed to cede a whole ‘nother draft pick in order to move up from the mid-third round to the mid-third round. If Skinner had already fallen to #78, wasn’t it highly likely he’d make it to #82? Perhaps the Oilers were concerned about Philadelphia Flyers, who did take a goalie at #80 overall, but who knows if they might have preferred Skinner to the guy they did take, Kirill Ustimenko.\n\nThe second odd thing was the Oilers taking a goalie at all at that point, especially one with a late birthday. Skinner is ten months younger than 2016 fifth rounder Dylan Wells, but they were both born in 1998 meaning both are likely to turn pro in 2018. Whether there is room at the inn for both is an open question, given the several young netminders currently ahead of them on the organizational depth chart.\n\nGoalies listed in order of age, even as Brossoit clearly slots above Pasquale on the organizational depth chart he can himself still be considered a “young goalie”. Above him, the reliable Cam Talbot; further down the pecking order, a boatload of hopefuls and wannabes.\n\nArticle content\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nIndeed, only Brossoit was in the Oilers organization when Peter Chairelli took over. The acquisition of Talbot was an early priority, while the stockpiling of youngsters has proiceeded apace. Besides those shown above, Miroslav Svoboda was drafted from the Czech League in 2015, but went unsigned by the 2017 June 1 deadline.\n\nMakes sense that Pasquale — the “Richard Bachman” of the system at the moment — was signed for just one year. Right now there’s a slot for him along with Ellis at the AHL level, while Starrett seems likely to be the main man at the ECHL affiliate in Wichita. But in a year’s time both Wells and Skinner are set to turn pro and there won’t be room for a couple of the padded men currently listed above them.\n\nLooking at those two guys at the very bottom, last year’s draft pick, Dylan Wells, has a leg up on Skinner in the sense that he has already signed a contract, and for that reason alone perhaps we should have given the OHL stopper a slight edge in our Cult of Hockey prospect rankings. Otherwise there is precious little to choose between them, as reflected in our rankings of #14 and #13 respectively.\n\nAdvertisement 4\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nIn Skinner’s corner is the fact that he immediately established himself as he #1 man in Lethbridge back in 2014, and has amassed 151 regular season games of experience plus another 20 in the playoffs this past year. Wells was a backup for two years, but took a great leap forward in 2016-17, as described in his own post.\n\nFor his part Skinner jumped all the way to 60 (+ 20) games played as the main man in Lethbridge. While some of his stats took a dive — notably a save percentage of just .905 after a sterling .920 the previous year — he stepped up in the playoffs with a solid .916 over three long series after crashing and burning with a miserable .862 in just 4 games as the Hurricanes crashed out of the 2016 post-season.\n\nCertainly the verbal on the young stopper is positive enough. That’s to be expected in the Hurricanes’ own website, which nonetheless provides some useful background:\n\nThe Edmonton, Alberta product has quickly made a name for himself in his three year career with the ‘Canes. Originally drafted by the Hurricanes 17th overall in the 2013 WHL Bantam Draft, Skinner has impressed in his time in Lethbridge having appeared in 151 regular season games in three seasons – the most regular season games ever played by a Hurricanes goaltender… n 2016-2017, Skinner appeared in a career-high 60 games posting a record of 34-18-3-2 with a 3.26 goals against average (GAA) and a .905 save percentage (SV%) along with two shutouts. In his franchise-leading 151 regular season games, Skinner has posted a 3.28 GAA and a .909 SV% with a record of 74-51-6-3 and six shutouts.\n\nAdvertisement 5\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nThe prospect site Future Considerations describes the 6’3, 200-pound stopper’s style of play:\n\nA large and agile keeper with refined skills…uses his lower half extremely well, expanding his legs in the butterfly to seal off the whole lower half of the net…his size doesn’t hamper his speed as he remains agile and in control in his movements…is very quick post to post and has great leg strength to pop up and drop down quickly multiple times on reactionary circumstances…is great at squaring up shots and is constantly searching to get the best sightline at the puck….adjusts his angles according to the shooters position and is able to swallow up numerous shots with his large torso without rebound…controls rebounds well, limiting pucks in the slot with a combination of well angled leg work and the use of his blocker…his glove hand is quick and he keeps it held in a good position…compete to never give up is exceptional…very impressive how polished he is at this stage of his career…has the potential to become a high end stopper at the pro level.\n\nI had a chance to view Skinner myself in a first-round playoff game at the Red Deer Centrium, one which the Hurricanes ultimately lost, 4-3 in double overtime. I wasn’t specifically tracking him, but was generally impressed with his athleticism which was excellent for a big man.\n\nAdvertisement 6\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nLook familiar? Like his fellow Oilers netminding hopeful Dylan Wells, Stuart Skinner has scored a goal in major junior\n\nSkinner showed enough to earn an invite to the World Junior Summer Showcase, where all the goalies had their struggles (August hockey, eh) and he in particular got lit up. But he is in the mix for a spot on Team Canada along with Wells, a friend with whom he seems destined to battle for ice time for quite some time to come. Indeed, those readers who made it all the way to the end of the Wells article will find plenty in common in our concluding paragraph for Stuart Skinner:\n\nExpectations for 2017-18: Consolidate his 2016-17 showing in the WHL, perhaps pushing his save percentage into the .920 range, and compete for a spot on Team Canada at the 2018 World Juniors.\n\nCult of Hockey podcast:\n\nLeon Draisaitl signs his news deal.
