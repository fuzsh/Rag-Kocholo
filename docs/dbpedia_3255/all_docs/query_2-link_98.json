        "text": "Spoiler\n\nyeah i know its ukranian u stinker\n\n\"Sláva Chernarus.\"\n\nSpoiler\n\nThe Special Operations Detachment \"Svoboda\" or more commonly known as the Svoboda Brigade, is a paramilitary popular mobilization organization formed in 2010 by the newly founded statist-nationalist Strana Vzkříšení (Resurrection Party). As the SV began to expand its power and became the dominant political party in Chernarus, it absorbed NAPA and membership among the ranks of the CDF soared. The party needed a means by which to protect its infrastructure, members, and leadership in times of warfare or civil unrest. It began to form what it called Vzkříšení Brigády or Resurrection Brigade(s). The party stockpiled weapons and other munitions within local and municipal Vzkříšení buildings that could be used to arm loyalists and civilians alike in turmoil. Eventually such a stockpiling of weapons had taken place that the party saw fit to offset the CDF and other police units by actively arming and formalizing the brigades. Most large towns across Chernarus have party buildings where the brigades store equipment and attend party meetings. Each brigade is officially commanded by the governor of their respective Oblast, with lower level party officials actively organizing and leading units. Military bases of the CDF are used for larger scale training operations and exercises. All brigade members report solely to the SV Party and have no direct organization connection to the military or to the Interior Ministry, other than the fact that they do receive weapons from the CDF. After the outbreak, it gained notoriety after allegations of torture and war crimes outside the government safezone. Svoboda Brigada is Miroslavl city’s Vzkříšení Brigade and draws members from all across Miroslavl Oblast.\n\n\"Krev a půda.\"\n\nDue to isolation a central command structure, and influence from local South Zagorian militia groups, Svoboda took a hard-liner nationalist, anti-foreign authoritarian stance on as their new ideology. As they no-longer share the same ideals as the central government, they cut off all connection and declared that they are their own political and military entity. Disagreements with Stepan Cernik, and other NCO's within the Brigada lead to mutinies within the ranks. Uncontested, Oskar Hosek declared himself leader of the movement; renaming the Svoboda Brigada to Svoboda Movement. Cut off from Miroslav command, the soldiers within the movement were forced to take a more guerrilla stance on their doctrine, the lack of supplies and equipment means that the group is now forced to change their tactics. Without the restrictions of the laws of war, Svoboda are now free to act on their own laws.\n\nCredit to @Sylva and @Major for the group lore\n\nOn an unusually cold spring morning in 2010, a group of civilian members of the newly formed Strana Vzkříšení began to assemble in the assembly yard of the party’s local headquarters in downtown Miroslavl, near a tributary of the Burnaya River. Václav Dubček, leader of the Miroslavl wing of the party gathered behind a podium on a stage high above the hundreds of members clad in well-pressed TTsKO uniforms and business clothes. Václav raised his hand to quiet the crowd while clutching a sheet of paper that beared the seal of the Republic. He read the text of the paper loudly: “Tímto jste nařízeni, abyste začali přijímat zaměstnance za účelem vytvoření lidové mobilizační síly, která by mohla ochránit stát v době konfliktu. podepsal, prezident republiky, Radek Kozlov. Sláva Státu!”\n\n(“You are hereby ordered to begin recruitment for the creation of a popular mobilization force that can safeguard the state in times of strife, signed, President of the Republic, Radek Kozlov. Sláva Státu!”)\n\nThe courtyard roared back at him in unison: “Sláva Státu!”\n\nFor Dubček and the rest of the hardline party members, this was the moment they had been waiting for. A chance to expand and solidify the power of the State and the party and to usher in an era of peace that would bring an end to the history of sectarian strife and weakness that had plagued the nation and nearly brought it to its knees during the civil war. Many of those in the courtyard had been members of the CDF or NAPA before the inception of the party, giving a great deal of members combat experience. So when the Party and the President called for volunteers, these men, in middle adulthood, idealistic, and full of bright ideas of glory and patriotism, led by Václav Dubček, Ulan Dvorak, and Alexander Kopec set into motion a chain of events that would change Chernarus forever. And so the Svoboda Brigade of the Vzkříšení Brigády was formed.\n\nDubček’s father was a wealthy distillery owner, and agreed to to give the startup funds necessary for what would become the Svoboda Brigade, alongside official Party funds that had been allocated. Dubček’s father and his role in the Party leadership made it possible for the Svoboda Brigade to expand rapidly. Kopec, who had been discharged from the military due to a leg injury, became the military backbone of the unit, while Dvorak became its public face. With Dubček running its finances, Kopec drilling the new recruits, and Dvorak bringing in said recruits by the dozen, within a month the battalion was nearly eight hundred members.\n\nIn 2015 the brigade deployed to the border amidst tensions with Russia, effectively complimenting the CDF and staffing many checkpoints and border defenses. Svoboda Brigada performed so well that the CDF gifted several BTR-70s to the brigade. The operation to secure the border put Svoboda Brigada in the local headlines and lead to a cascade of new recruits that had been galvanized with the threat of war with Russia. With grants from the Chernarussian government, the unit bought additional weapons, even going so far as to add a mechanized BTR platoon and towed anti-air artillery to its ever-growing list of equipment. The brigade became a brotherhood, a close-knit group of men (and even a few women) who would do anything for one another, and more importantly, for the cause they represented.\n\nThe CDF officially incorporated Svoboda Brigada into its exercises to act as military police and logistical support. The brigades also served to keep an eye on the CDF and ensure loyalty to the State and the party.\n\nDuring the early days of the Outbreak, President Kozlov authorized the Vzkříšení Brigády (as an unofficial, but official government entity) to restore order in the streets and to launch raids against the infected once the crisis expanded. Many members of the party who had never joined the military wing of the party signed up for Svoboda Brigada. It was clear that this force was to be the official military arm of the Party and it’s muscle should the CDF fail. The best military units had been kept back to guard Primorsk and other critical government facilities during the advent of the Takistani incursion and the war with the Belozersk People’s Republic. In order to preserve the CDF newly assembled conscript units and Right Sektor militants were sent into the fray. However, in Miroslavl the State had to deal with increasing numbers of infected and a dwindling supply of food for winter. The Svoboda Brigade was given free reign in “pacifying” its home region, and it did so with extreme prejudice returning separated civilians to the coastal safezones.. Despite the high casualties (both friendly and noncombatant), Novigrad was impressed by the wide swath of territory it added back into the Republic’s fold, forging a barrier of land between Miroslavl city and the wild reaches of the Black Mountains to the north.\n\nBut as the situation collapsed in South Zagoria, and the war with the BPR intensified, Kozlov and his generals sat down for a revamp of the current strategy. It was decided that South Zagoria needed to be quelled to secure the CDF’s flank, and in doing so open another front against the BPR. It would have the added effect of reopening a trade route into Russia and securing the vast, untapped resource reserves of the province to assist in the war effort. But with most of the CDF’s maneuver forces locked down on the BPR front, it was decided that Kozlov’s finest, his own personal Svoboda Brigada, would shoulder the task under the cover of the mighty eagles of the Chernarussian Air Force.\n\nAnd so, on a cold spring morning, exactly eight years after Václav Dubček, Ulan Dvorak, and Alexander Kopec and other party leaders fulfilled the call, the first units of Svoboda entered South Zagoria, and changed the game forever.\n\nUnfortunately, not all would make it to South Zagoria safely.\n\nIC GOALS\n\nDay 300: Establish a clear understanding of the political and military situation within the oblast and make contact with as many groups as possible.

Disarm the ordinary armed men, but eliminate all commissars, commanders and functionaries ruthlessly.\" -Prizrak\n\nDay 400: Combine the remaining Chernarussian nationalists into one, national front - and plan an offensive against both Russia and the pretender Chernarussian state.\n\nContinuous: Provide aid to all ethnic Chernarussians.\n\nContinuous: Re-claim our country from the foreigners that plague it.\n\nOOC GOALS\n\nActively contribute to the lore of the server and the lore of individual characters with frequent updates to the group page and media thread, as well as becoming an official Lore faction.\n\nEnforce a strict use of in-game radios instead of teamspeak, as well as avoiding glitches within the game that make the game-play unimmersive and or easier, to fully immerse ourselves in the world we RP in. We want it to mean something when we collect food and hand it out.\n\nIf a “lore character” of the faction dies in-game to any circumstance besides a glitch, they are immediately permanently killed. Furthermore, all members of the group will accept requests to permanently kill their characters.\n\nThis group is heavily influenced by ZBOR and Res Publica.

Got some things we can do now that we have a CDF group being run again that I wanted to do earlier, but couldn't due to circumstances. First off, there is no National Guard in Chernarus like there is in Ukraine. They have the CDF and the Militsiya, so basically police that are deputized for service or whatever. Last time I checked there was also no fighting in June of 2009, that didn't come till August or September. To be completely honest though, there are lots of random wiki pages out there that give different dates but the ones I remember from the campaign were in the fall. They also wouldn't have been deployed to Takistan but that doesn't really matter considering the national guard isn't a thing. Your description of the brigade resembles a Spravny Sektor brigade and not a government formation of any type.\n\nNow when the civil war did take place NAPA and local town self-defense defended towns where the CDF was absent. The Interior Ministry might have gotten some volunteers to be brought into the police force but that would have been about it. NAPA membership also would have soared, so no need for the x-million of proverbial random shitty right-wing Nationalist platoons with the same boring modus operandi of kill gays and smoke Russians with a PKM and \"Muh Chernarus\". No grant would have been given to a national guard unit merged with an airborne unit. Chernarussian airborne units and their mountain battalion compatriots are the closest thing Chernarus has to military special forces. They wouldn't have merged, if anything the national guard unit remains would been retrained and used as replacements for the airborne unit. I can't really remember if Chernarus had any T-80s, much less the UM variant but that would have been reserved for elite CDF units on the border or in Novigrad. Also any Chernarussian Mi-24s would have been strictly air force. There is no army aviation in Chernarus. Seems the brigade is changing forms (or trying to be a lot) quite a lot from militsiya, to CDF mainline unit, right-wing militant battalion, etc.\n\nOnto to 2010. No nationalist party would have been created in 2010, period. The Strana Vzkrizini came to power, NAPA disbanded and most of its members joined the SV as they had similar goals and the might of the Chernarussian people, the State, and the CDF to back it up. The only right-wing/nationalist party that remained was Spravny Sektor and they are like Azov levels of right wing and competed with the SV but worked together undercover on a criminal-thug level. The ChPNK would not have been a thing period. That sort of shatters the rest of that paragraph and all that will need to be reworked.\n\nThe Outbreak wasn't in 2016, and you make it seem as if the CDF isn't really a thing. A coup wouldn't have even been a faint possibility or a thought now in the current situation. TLDR, this thread is absolutely full of Lore issues, but the writing and everything else is pristine. You are trying to do way too much.\n\nThe goals are generic and way too far out. I like the welfare thing, but they would never let foreigners be citizens like that.\n\nI hope all the time zones work out for this group, considering you have people in a lot of places across the globe. Come talk to me when you get a chance, GL."
