        "text": "Miroslav Svoboda Decorates His One-of-a-Kind Home with 180,000 Wine Corks\n\nCorinne Guirgis — June 11, 2011 — Eco\n\nI suppose this is one way of staying environmentally friendly: Czech Republic citizen Miroslav Svoboda has covered his home in 180,000 recycled wine corks. The home has become a regular tourist attraction on account of its unusual decor.\n\nSvoboda is an experienced bricklayer whose two-year planning process involved developing an entire protocol to clean the wine corks and make sure his work passes the test of time. After placing the corks in a disinfectant bath that removed the smell of wine and killed any germs, he dried them and cut them in half. He then fixed each piece of cork into place with cement and sculpted them into various shapes by hand. According to Oddity Central, Svoboda says his house is very old and has extremely thick walls, so he didn’t cover his house in corks for padding -- this was purely for aesthetic reasons.\n\nSurely Svoboda became quite the avid wine drinker throughout this exceptionally comprehensive project.\n\nTrend Themes\n\n1. Cork Decoration Trend - The use of recycled wine corks as a decorative element in architecture and design.\n\n2. Environmentally Friendly Decor - The trend of incorporating eco-friendly materials, such as recycled wine corks, into interior and exterior design.\n\n3. Creative Upcycling Movement - The growing movement of repurposing discarded materials, like wine corks, to create unique and visually appealing structures.\n\nIndustry Implications\n\n1. Architecture and Interior Design - Opportunity for architects and interior designers to explore new ways of incorporating sustainable and interesting materials like wine corks into their projects.\n\n2. Sustainable Construction - The construction industry can embrace the use of environmentally friendly materials, such as recycled wine corks, in building facades and other structural elements.\n\n3. Art and Craft - Artists and craft enthusiasts can explore the creative potential of upcycling materials like wine corks to create unique and visually striking pieces.\n\n1.9\n\nScore\n\nPopularity\n\nActivity\n\nFreshness"
