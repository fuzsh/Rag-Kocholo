(Remember that Christianity has never been merely an affair of the Roman Empire or, after its fall, of Europe.) As this is intended as an introductory bibliography, it is primarily limited to monographs and edited volumes. A few key chapters and articles, however, have been included. Entries are organized in four sections: — Secondary Sources from New Testament scholarship, — Primary Sources from the patristic period, — Secondary Sources examining the patristic period, — Contemporary Perspectives in dialogue with Scripture lastest revision: 16 February 2023\n\nThis article provides an overview of approaches to men and women in Christian society, culture and thought from the first to eighth centuries. It includes a select bibliography of scholarship on the topic. It's intended readership is scholars and students working in the fields of New Testament and Early Christian Studies and/or Patristics.\n\nWomen played a vital role in the spread of Christianity in the first and second century CE. This paper will assess their contribution by examining the various functions and responsibilities held by women as described in the New Testament and Canonical Gospels. The assessment will commence with a brief description of the lives of women in the Greco-Roman world. This description of the cultural setting will serve as an introduction to Jesus’ attitude towards and interaction with women, who were among his first followers. Women continued to function in the early church in a variety of roles such as apostles, evangelists, prophets, teachers and house church leaders, using their skills to spread the message and further the impact of the fledgling religion. A close examination of these multifarious roles, drawing on the Canonical Gospels as primary source, will demonstrate the integral part women played in the dissemination of Christianity."
