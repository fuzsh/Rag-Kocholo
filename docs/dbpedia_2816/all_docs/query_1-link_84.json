Rumors obscured the circumstances of this find—perhaps because the discovery was accidental, and its sale on the black market illegal. For years even the identity of the discoverer remained unknown. One rumor held that he was a blood avenger; another, that he had made the find near the town of Naj ‘Hammadi at the Jabal al-Tarif, a mountain honey- combed with more than 150 caves. Originally natural, some of these caves were cut and painted and used as grave sites as early as the sixth dynasty, some 4,300 years ago.\n\nThirty years later the discoverer himself, Muhammad ‘Ali al- Samman, told what happened.1 Shortly before he and his brothers avenged their father's murder in a blood feud, they had saddled their camels and gone out to the Jabal to dig for sabakh, a soft soil they used to fertilize their crops. Digging around a massive boulder, they hit a red earthenware jar, almost a meter high. Muhammad ‘Ali hesitated to break the jar, considering that a jinn, or spirit, might live inside. But realizing that it might also contain gold, he raised his mattock, smashed the jar, and discovered inside thirteen papyrus books, bound in leather. Returning to his home in al-Qasr, Muhammad ‘Ali dumped the books\n\n[ xiii]\n\nIntroduction\n\nand loose papyrus leaves on the straw piled on the ground next to the oven. Muhammad's mother, ‘Umm-Ahmad, admits that she burned much of the papyrus in the oven along with the straw she used to kindle the fire.\n\nA few weeks later, as Muhammad ‘Ali tells it, he and his brothers avenged their father's death by murdering Ahmed Isma’il. Their mother had warned her sons to keep their mattocks sharp: when they learned that their father's enemy was nearby, the brothers seized the opportunity, \"hacked off his limbs . . . ripped out his heart, and devoured it among them, as the ultimate act of blood revenge.\"2\n\nFearing that the police investigating the murder would search his house and discover the books, Muhammad ‘Aliasked the priest, al- Qummus Basiliyus Abd al-Masih, to keep one or more for him. During the time that Muhammad ‘Ali and his brothers were being interrogated for murder, Raghib, a local history teacher, had seen one of the books, and suspected that it had value. Having received one from al-Qummus Basiliyus, Raghib sent it to a friend in Cairo to find out its worth.\n\nSold on the black market through antiquities dealers in Cairo, the manuscripts soon attracted the attention of officials of the Egyptian government. Through circumstances of high drama, as we shall see, they bought one and confiscated ten and a half of the thirteen leather-bound books, called codices, and deposited them in the Coptic Museum in Cairo. But a large part of the thirteenth codex, containing five extraordinary texts, was smuggled out of Egypt and offered for sale in America. Word of this codex soon reached Professor Gilles Quispel, distinguished historian of religion at Utrecht, in the Netherlands. Excited by the discovery, Quispel urged the Jung Foundation in Zurich to buy the codex. But discovering, when he succeeded, that some pages were missing, he flew to Egypt in the spring of 1955 to try to find them in the Coptic Museum. Arriving in Cairo, he went at once to the Coptic Museum, borrowed photographs of some of the texts, and hurried back to his hotel to decipher them. Tracing out the first line, Quispel was startled, then in-\n\n[ xiv]\n\nIntroduction\n\ncredulous, to read: \"These are the secret words which the living Jesus spoke, and which the twin, Judas Thomas, wrote down.\"3 Quispel knew that his colleague H.-C. Puech, using notes from another French scholar, Jean Doresse, had identified the opening lines with fragments of a Greek Gospel of Thomas discovered in the 1890's. But the discovery of the whole text raised new questions: Did Jesus have a twin brother, as this text implies? Could the text be an authentic record of Jesus' sayings? According to its title, it contained the Gospel According to Thomas; yet, unlike the gospels of the New Testament, this text identified itself as a secret gospel. Quispel also discovered that it contained many sayings known from the New Testament; but these sayings, placed in unfamiliar contexts, suggested other dimensions of meaning. Other passages, Quispel found, differed entirely from any known Christian tradition: the \"living Jesus,\" for example, speaks in sayings as cryptic and compelling as Zen koans:\n\nJesus said, \"If you bring forth what is within you, what you bring forth will save you. If you do not bring forth what is within you, what you do not bring forth will destroy you.\"4\n\nWhat Quispel held in his hand, the Gospel of Thomas, was only one of the fifty-two texts discovered at Nag Hammadi (the usual English transliteration of the town's name). Bound into the same volume with it is the Gospel of Philip, which attributes to Jesus acts and sayings quite different from those in the New Testament:\n\n. . . the companion of the [Savior is] Mary Magdalene. [But Christ loved] her more than [all] the disciples, and used to kiss her [often] on her [mouth]. The rest of [the disciples were offended] . . . They said to him, \"Why do you love her more than all of us?\" The Savior answered and said to them, \"Why do I not love you as (I love) her?\"5\n\nOther sayings in this collection criticize common Christian beliefs, such as the virgin birth or the bodily resurrection, as\n\n[xv]\n\nIntroduction\n\nnaive misunderstandings. Bound together with these gospels is the Apocryphon (literally, \"secret book\") of John, which opens with an offer to reveal \"the mysteries [and the] things hidden in silence\" which Jesus taught to his disciple John.6\n\nMuhammad ‘Ali later admitted that some of the texts were lost— burned up or thrown away. But what remains is astonishing: some fifty-two texts from the early centuries of the Christian era— including a collection of early Christian gospels, previously unknown. Besides the Gospel of Thomas and the Gospel of Philip, the find included the Gospel of Truth and the Gospel to the Egyptians, which identifies itself as \"the [sacred book] of the Great Invisible [Spirit].\"7 Another group of texts consists of writings attributed to Jesus' followers, such as the Secret Book of James, the Apocalypse of Paul, the Letter of Peter to Philip, and the Apocalypse of Peter.\n\nWhat Muhammad ‘Ali discovered at Nag Hammadi, it soon became clear, were Coptic translations, made about 1,500 years ago, of still more ancient manuscripts. The originals themselves had been written in Greek, the language of the New Testament: as Doresse, Puech, and Quispel had recognized, part of one of them had been discovered by archeologists about fifty years earlier, when they found a few fragments of the original Greek version of the Gospel of Thomas.8\n\nAbout the dating of the manuscripts themselves there is little debate. Examination of the datable papyrus used to thicken the leather bindings, and of the Coptic script, place them c. A.D. 3 50- 400.9 But scholars sharply disagree about the dating of the original texts. Some of them can hardly be later than c. A.D. 120-150, since Irenaeus, the orthodox Bishop of Lyons, writing c. 180, declares that heretics \"boast that they possess more gospels than there really are,\"10 and complains that in his time such writings already have won wide circulation—from Gaul through Rome, Greece, and Asia Minor.\n\nQuispel and his collaborators, who first published the Gospel of Thomas, suggested the date of c. A.D. 140 for the original.11 Some reasoned that since these gospels were heretical, they must\n\n[ xvi]\n\nIntroduction\n\nhave been written later than the gospels of the New Testament, which are dated c. 60-110. But recently Professor Helmut Koester of Harvard University has suggested that the collection of sayings in the Gospel of Thomas, although compiled c. 140, may include some traditions even older than the gospels of the New Testament, \"possibly as early as the second half of the first century\" (50-100)— as early as, or earlier, than Mark, Matthew, Luke, and John.12\n\nScholars investigating the Nag Hammadi find discovered that some of the texts tell the origin of the human race in terms very different from the usual reading of Genesis: the Testimony of Truth, for example, tells the story of the Garden of Eden from the viewpoint of the serpent! Here the serpent, long known to appear in gnostic literature as the principle of divine wisdom, convinces Adam and Eve to partake of knowledge while \"the Lord\" threatens them with death, trying jealously to prevent them from attaining knowledge, and expelling them from Paradise when they achieve it.13 Another text, mysteriously entitled the Thunder, Perfect Mind, offers an extraordinary poem spoken in the voice of a feminine divine power:\n\nFor I am the first and the last. I am the honored one and the scorned one. I am the whore and the holy one. I am the wife and the virgin. . . . I am the barren one, and many are her sons. . . . I am the silence that is incomprehensible . . . I am the utterance of my name.14\n\nThese diverse texts range, then, from secret gospels, poems, and quasi-philosophic descriptions of the origin of the universe, to myths, magic, and instructions for mystical practice.\n\nWHY WERE THESE TEXTS BURIED—and why have they remained virtually unknown for nearly 2,000 years? Their sup-\n\n[ xvii]\n\nIntroduction\n\npression as banned documents, and their burial on the cliff at Nag Hammadi, it turns out, were both part of a struggle critical for the formation of early Christianity. The Nag Hammadi texts, and others like them, which circulated at the beginning of the Christian era, were denounced as heresy by orthodox Christians in the middle of the second century. We have long known that many early followers of Christ were condemned by other Christians as heretics, but nearly all we knew about them came from what their opponents wrote attacking them. Bishop Irenaeus, who supervised the church in Lyons, c. 180, wrote five volumes, entitled The Destruction and Overthrow of Falsely So-called Knowledge, which begin with his promise to\n\nset forth the views of those who are now teaching heresy . . . to show how absurd and inconsistent with the truth are their statements . . . I do this so that . . . you may urge all those with whom you are connected to avoid such an abyss of madness and of blasphemy against Christ.15\n\nHe denounces as especially \"full of blasphemy\" a famous gospel called the Gospel of Truth.16 Is Irenaeus referring to the same Gospel of Truth discovered at Nag Hammadi? Quispel and his collaborators, who first published the Gospel of Truth, argued that he is; one of their critics maintains that the opening line (which begins \"The gospel of truth\") is not a title.17 But Irenaeus does use the same source as at least one of the texts discovered at Nag Hammadi—the Apocryphon (Secret Book) of John—as ammunition for his own attack on such \"heresy.\" Fifty years later Hippolytus, a teacher in Rome, wrote another massive Refutation of All Heresies to \"expose and refute the wicked blasphemy of the heretics.\"18\n\nThis campaign against heresy involved an involuntary admission of its persuasive power; yet the bishops prevailed. By the time of the Emperor Constantine's conversion, when Christianity became an officially approved religion in the fourth century, Christian bishops, previously victimized by the police, now commanded them. Possession of books denounced as heretical\n\n[ xviii}\n\nIntroduction\n\nwas made a criminal offense. Copies of such books were burned and destroyed. But in Upper Egypt, someone, possibly a monk from a nearby monastery of St. Pachomius,19 took the banned books and hid them from destruction—in the jar where they remained buried for almost 1,600 years.\n\nBut those who wrote and circulated these texts did not regard themselves as \"heretics.\" Most of the writings use Christian termino- logy, unmistakably related to a Jewish heritage. Many claim to offer traditions about Jesus that are secret, hidden from \"the many\" who constitute what, in the second century, came to be called the \"catholic church.\" These Christians are now called gnostics, from the Greek word gnosis, usually translated as \"knowledge.\" For as those who claim to know nothing about ultimate reality are called agnostic (literally, \"not-knowing\"), the person who does claim to know such things is called gnostic (\"knowing\"). But gnosis is not primarily rational knowledge. The Greek language distinguishes between scientific or reflective knowledge (\"He knows mathe- matics\") and knowing through observation or experience (\"He knows me\"), which is gnosis. As the gnostics use the term, we could translate it as \"insight,\" for gnosis involves an intuitive process of knowing oneself. And to know oneself, they claimed, is to know human nature and human destiny. According to the gnostic teacher Theodotus, writing in Asia Minor (c. 140-160), the gnostic is one who has come to understand\n\nwho we were, and what we have become; where we were . . . whither we are hastening; from what we are being released; what birth is, and what is rebirth.20\n\nYet to know oneself, at the deepest level, is simultaneously to know God; this is the secret of gnosis. Another gnostic teacher, Monoimus, says:\n\nAbandon the search for God and the creation and other matters of a similar sort. Look for him by taking yourself as the starting point. Learn who it is within you who makes everything his own and says, \"My God, my mind, my\n\n[ xix]\n\nIntroduction\n\nthought, my soul, my body.\" Learn the sources of sorrow, joy, love, hate . . . If you carefully investigate these matters you will find him in yourself.21\n\nWhat Muhammad ‘Ali discovered at Nag Hammadi is, apparently, a library of writings, almost all of them gnostic. Although they claim to offer secret teaching, many of these texts refer to the Scriptures of the Old Testament, and others to the letters of Paul and the New Testament gospels. Many of them include the same dramatis personae as the New Testament—Jesus and his disciples. Yet the differences are striking.\n\nOrthodox Jews and Christians insist that a chasm separates humanity from its creator: God is wholly other. But some of the gnostics who wrote these gospels contradict this: self-knowledge is knowledge of God; the self and the divine are identical.\n\nSecond, the \"living Jesus\" of these texts speaks of illusion and enlightenment, not of sin and repentance, like the Jesus of the New Testament. Instead of coming to save us from sin, he comes as a guide who opens access to spiritual understanding. But when the disciple attains enlightenment, Jesus no longer serves as his spiritual master: the two have become equal—even identical.\n\nThird, orthodox Christians believe that Jesus is Lord and Son of God in a unique way: he remains forever distinct from the rest of humanity whom he came to save. Yet the gnostic Gospel of Thomas relates that as soon as Thomas recognizes him, Jesus says to Thomas that they have both received their being from the same source:\n\nJesus said, \"I am not your master. Because you have drunk, you have become drunk from the bubbling stream which I have measured out. . . . He who will drink from my mouth will become as I am: I myself shall become he, and the things that are hidden will be revealed to him.\"22\n\nDoes not such teaching—the identity of the divine and human, the concern with illusion and enlightenment, the founder\n\n[xx]\n\nIntroduction\n\nwho is presented not as Lord, but as spiritual guide—sound more Eastern than Western? Some scholars have suggested that if the names were changed, the \"living Buddha\" appropriately could say what the Gospel of Thomas attributes to the living Jesus. Could Hindu or Buddhist tradition have influenced gnosticism? The British scholar of Buddhism, Edward Conze, suggests that it had. He points out that \"Buddhists were in contact with the Thomas Christians (that is, Christians who knew and used such writings as the Gospel of Thomas) in South India.\"23 Trade routes between the Greco-Roman world and the Far East were opening up at the time when gnosticism flourished (A.D. 80-200); for generations, Buddhist missionaries had been proselytizing in Alexandria. We note, too, that Hippolytus, who was a Greek-speaking Christian in Rome (c. 225), knows of the Indian Brahmins—and includes their tradition among the sources of heresy:\n\nThere is . . . among the Indians a heresy of those who philosophize among the Brahmins, who live a self-sufficient life, abstaining from (eating) living creatures and all cooked food . . . They say that God is light, not like the light one sees, nor like the sun nor fire, but to them God is discourse, not that which finds expression in articulate sounds, but that of knowledge (gnosis) through which the secret mysteries of nature are perceived by the wise.24\n\nCould the title of the Gospel of Thomas—named for the disciple who, tradition tells us, went to India—suggest the influence of Indian tradition?\n\nThese hints indicate the possibility, yet our evidence is not conclusive. Since parallel traditions may emerge in different cultures at different times, such ideas could have developed in both places independently.25 What we call Eastern and Western religions, and tend to regard as separate streams, were not clearly differentiated 2,000 years ago. Research on the Nag Hammadi texts is only beginning: we look forward to the work of scholars who can study these traditions comparatively to discover whether they can, in fact, be traced to Indian sources.\n\n[ xxi]\n\nIntroduction\n\nEven so, ideas that we associate with Eastern religions emerged in the first century through the gnostic movement in the West, but they were suppressed and condemned by polemicists like Irenaeus. Yet those who called gnosticism heresy were adopting—consciously or not—the viewpoint of that group of Christians who called themselves orthodox Christians. A heretic may be anyone whose outlook someone else dislikes or denounces. According to tradition, a heretic is one who deviates from the true faith. But what defines that \"true faith\"? Who calls it that, and for what reasons?\n\nWe find this problem familiar in our own experience. The term \"Christianity,\" especially since the Reformation, has covered an astonishing range of groups. Those claiming to represent \"true Christianity\" in the twentieth century can range from a Catholic cardinal in the Vatican to an African Methodist Episcopal preacher initiating revival in Detroit, a Mormon missionary in Thailand, or the member of a village church on the coast of Greece. Yet Catholics, Protestants, and Orthodox agree that such diversity is a recent—and deplorable—development. According to Christian legend, the early church was different. Christians of every persuasion look back to the primitive church to find a simpler, purer form of Christian faith. In the apostles' time, all members of the Christian community shared their money and property; all believed the same teaching, and worshiped together; all revered the authority of the apostles. It was only after that golden age that conflict, then heresy emerged: so says the author of the Acts of the Apostles, who identifies himself as the first historian of Christianity.\n\nBut the discoveries at Nag Hammadi have upset this picture. If we admit that some of these fifty-two texts represent early forms of Christian teaching, we may have to recognize that early Christianity is far more diverse than nearly anyone expected before the Nag Hammadi discoveries.26\n\nContemporary Christianity, diverse and complex as we find it, actually may show more unanimity than the Christian churches of the first and second centuries. For nearly all Chris-\n\n[ xxii]\n\nIntroduction\n\ntians since that time, Catholics, Protestants, or Orthodox, have shared three basic premises. First, they accept the canon of the New Testament; second, they confess the apostolic creed; and third, they affirm specific forms of church institution. But every one of these— the canon of Scripture, the creed, and the institutional structure— emerged in its present form only toward the end of the second century. Before that time, as Irenaeus and others attest, numerous gospels circulated among various Christian groups, ranging from those of the New Testament, Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, to such writings as the Gospel of Thomas, the Gospel of Philip, and the Gospel of Truth, as well as many other secret teachings, myths, and poems attributed to Jesus or his disciples. Some of these, apparently, were discovered at Nag Hammadi; many others are lost to us. Those who identified themselves as Christians entertained many—and radically differing—religious beliefs and practices. And the communities scattered throughout the known world organized themselves in ways that differed widely from one group to another.\n\nYet by A.D. 200, the situation had changed. Christianity had become an institution headed by a three-rank hierarchy of bishops, priests, and deacons, who understood themselves to be the guardians of the only \"true faith.\" The majority of churches, among which the church of Rome took a leading role, rejected all other viewpoints as heresy. Deploring the diversity of the earlier movement, Bishop Irenaeus and his followers insisted that there could be only one church, and outside of that church, he declared, \"there is no salvation.\"27 Members of this church alone are orthodox (literally, \"straight- thinking\") Christians. And, he claimed, this church must be catholic—that is, universal. Whoever challenged that consensus, arguing instead for other forms of Christian teaching, was declared to be a heretic, and expelled. When the orthodox gained military support, sometime after the Emperor Constantine became Christian in the fourth century, the penalty for heresy escalated.\n\n[xxiii]\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe efforts of the majority to destroy every trace of heretical \"blasphemy\" proved so successful that, until the discoveries at Nag Hammadi, nearly all our information concerning alternative forms of early Christianity came from the massive orthodox attacks upon them. Although gnosticism is perhaps the earliest—and most threatening—of the heresies, scholars had known only a handful of original gnostic texts, none published before the nineteenth century. The first emerged in 1769, when a Scottish tourist named James Bruce bought a Coptic manuscript near Thebes (modern Luxor) in Upper Egypt.28 Published only in 1892, it claims to record conversations of Jesus with his disciples—a group that here includes both men and women. In 1773 a collector found in a London bookshop an ancient text, also in Coptic, that contained a dialogue on \"mysteries\" between Jesus and his disciples.29 In 1896 a German Egyptologist, alerted by the previous publications, bought in Cairo a manuscript that, to his amazement, contained the Gospel of Mary (Magdalene) and three other texts. Three copies of one of them, the Apocryphon (Secret Book) of John were also included among the gnostic library discovered at Nag Hammadi fifty years later.30\n\nBut why is this astonishing discovery at Nag Hammadi only now becoming known for the first time? Why did we not hear news of the Nag Hammadi discovery, as we did about the Dead Sea Scrolls, some twenty-five years ago? Professor Hans Jonas, the eminent authority on gnosticism, wrote in 1962:\n\nUnlike the Dead Sea finds of the same years, the gnostic find from Nag Hammadi has been beset from the beginning to this day by a persistent curse of political roadblocks, litigations, and, most of all, scholarly jealousies and \"first-manship\" (the last factor has grown by now into a veritable chronique scandaleuse of contemporary academia).31\n\nAccess to the texts was deliberately suppressed not only in ancient times but, for very different reasons, in the more than thirty years since the discovery.32 In the first place, villagers\n\n[xxiv]\n\nIntroduction\n\nfrom Upper Egypt and the antiquities dealers who were trying to get rich from the manuscripts hid them to avoid confiscation by government authorities. Their value became clear when the French Egyptologist Jean Doresse saw the first of the recovered manuscripts in 1947 at the Coptic Museum in Cairo. When the museum's director, Togo Mina, asked him to examine it, Doresse identified the manuscript and announced that this discovery would mark an epoch in the study of the origins of Christianity. Fired by his enthusiasm, Mina asked him to look at another manuscript, held by Albert Eid, a Belgian antiquities dealer in Cairo. Following this meeting, Mina went to see Eid to tell him that he would never allow the manuscript to leave Egypt—it must be sold, for a nominal price, to the museum.\n\nBut still the majority of the find remained hidden. Bahij ‘Ali, a one- eyed outlaw from al-Qasr, had acquired possession of many of the codices in Nag Hammadi and went to Cairo to sell them. Phocion Tano, an antiquities dealer, bought all that he had, and went to Nag Hammadi to see if he could find more. While Doresse worked in Cairo through the air raids and bombings of 1948 to publish the manuscript of Codex III, the Minister of Public Education nego- tiated to buy Tano's collection for the museum. Tano worked fast to prevent the government from interfering, by saying that they belonged to a private party, a woman named Dattari, an Italian collector living in Cairo. But on June 10, 1949, Miss Dattari was unsettled to read the following report in Cairo's French newspaper:\n\nThe acquisition of these precious documents by the Egyptian government is in process. According to the specialists consulted, it has to do with one of the most extraordinary discoveries preserved until the present by the ground of Egypt, surpassing in scientific interest such spectacular discoveries as the tomb of Tutankhamen.33\n\nWhen the government nationalized the collection in 1952, government officials claimed the codices, packed in a sealed suitcase. They paid Miss Dattari nothing—although her asking\n\n[ xxv]\n\nIntroduction\n\nprice had been about £ 100,000. When she retaliated with a lawsuit, she succeeded only in delaying research for three years by gaining a court injunction against it; she lost the case.\n\nBut the government failed to confiscate Eid's part of Codex I. In 1949 Albert Eid, worried about government intervention, flew from Cairo to America. By including the manuscript in a large collection of export items, he succeeded in smuggling it out of Egypt. He offered it to buyers for as much as $22,000, but since at least one prospective buyer refused, fearing that the Egyptian government would resent the sale, he returned disappointed to Belgium, where he placed it in a safe-deposit box protected by a secret password.\n\nThe Egyptian government indicted Eid for smuggling antiquities, but by the time of his conviction, the antiquities dealer had died. The court imposed a fine of £ 6,000 on his estate. Meanwhile Eid's widow secretly negotiated to sell the codex, perhaps even to competing bidders. Professor Gilles Quispel, who urged the Jung Foundation in Zurich to buy it, says he did not know that the export and sale were illegal when he made the arrangements. He enjoys telling the dramatic story of his coup:\n\nOn the 10th day of May, 1952, a professor from Utrecht took a train to Brussels. However, due to his absentmindedness, he stepped out of the train in Tilborg, while thinking he was in Roosendaal, and thus missed his connecting train. But when he finally approached the appointed meeting place, a café somewhere in Brussels, two hours too late, he saw the middleman, from Saint Idesbald close by Coxye on the Belgium coast, still waiting at the window and kindly waving to him. The professor then reached out and handed the man a check for 35,000 Frs.S. In return, the man gave the professor about 50 papyri. How does one manage to transfer them over the border without complications? One cannot very easily hide such a package. Thus one must remain honest, and when the customs official asks, \"What do you have in that package?\" then one just tells the truth: \"An old manuscript.\" And the customs official makes a gesture of\n\n[ xxvi]\n\nIntroduction\n\ntotal disinterest and lets one pass. So this is how the Jung Codex was purchased.34\n\nOnce ownership of the manuscripts was established by 1952— twelve and a half codices in the Coptic Museum in Cairo, and most of the thirteenth in a safe-deposit box in Zurich—the texts became, for the next twenty years, the focus of intense personal rivalries among the international group of scholars competing for access to them.\n\nDr. Pahor Labib, who took over directorship of the Coptic Museum in 1952, decided to keep strict control over publication rights. Publishing the definitive first edition of any one of these extraordinary, original texts—let alone the whole collection—would establish a scholar's reputation internationally. The few to whom Dr. Labib did grant access to the manuscripts protected their interests by refusing to allow anyone else to see them. In 1961 the Director General of UNESCO, alerted to the discovery by French scholars, urged publication of the whole find and proposed setting up an international committee to arrange it.35 The Scandinavian archeologist Torgny Save-Soderberg wrote to UNESCO, speaking for himself and other scholars, urging UNESCO to intervene, and to prepare a complete edition of photographs of all the manuscripts in order to place the whole of the discovery at the disposal of the many scholars throughout the world who were impatient to see them.\n\nTen years later, in 1972, the first volume of the photographic edition finally appeared. Nine other volumes followed between 1972 and 1977, thus putting all thirteen codices in the public domain. Since undertaking such a major technical project in Egypt involved many delays, Professor James Robinson, director of the Institute for Antiquity and Christianity, the only American member of the UNESCO committee, had organized an international team to copy and translate most of the material. Robinson and his team privately circulated this material to scholars throughout the world, thus involving many people in the research, effectively breaking the monopoly that had controlled the discovery.\n\n[ xxvii]\n\nIntroduction\n\nI first learned of the Nag Hammadi discoveries in 1965, when I entered the graduate program at Harvard University to study the history of Christianity. I was fascinated to hear of the find, and delighted in 1968 when Professor George MacRae of Harvard received the mimeographed transcriptions from Robinson's team. Because the official publications had not yet appeared, each page was stamped with a warning:\n\nThis material is for private study by assigned individuals only. Neither the text nor its translation may be reproduced or published in any form, in whole or in part.\n\nMacRae and his colleague Professor Helmut Koester encouraged their students to learn Coptic in order to begin research on this extraordinary find. Convinced that the discovery would revolutionize the traditional understanding of the origins of Christianity, I wrote my dissertation at Harvard and Oxford on the controversy between gnostic and orthodox Christianity. After receiving the Ph.D. from Harvard in 1970 and accepting a faculty position at Barnard College, Columbia University, I worked almost exclusively on early Christian gnosticism. After publishing two technical books on this research,36 I received grants in 1975 (from the American Council of Learned Societies and the American Philosophical Society) so that I could study the manuscripts at the Cairo Museum and attend the First International Conference on Coptic Studies in Cairo. There, like other scholars, I was initiated to the Coptic Museum, amazed to find the library that houses the manuscripts to be a single, small room of the Coptic Museum. Every day, while children played in the library and cleaning women washed the floor around me, I worked at the table, transcribing the papyri. Having seen only black-and-white photographs, I found the originals surprisingly beautiful—each mounted in plexiglass, inscribed in black ink on golden brown leaves. At the First International Conference, held in Cairo while I was there, I delivered a paper on one of the manuscripts (the Dialogue of the Savior),37 and even met one\n\n[ xxviii ]\n\nIntroduction\n\nof the middlemen from al-Qasr who sold the texts illegally in Cairo.\n\nHaving joined the team of scholars, I participated in preparing the first complete edition in English, published in the United States by Harper & Row in 1977. Only with that publication, and with the completion of the photographic edition expected by 1980, have we finally overcome the obstacles to public knowledge caused by what Professor Gerard Garitte of Louvain called \"personal rivalries and . . . pretensions to monopolize documents that belong only to science, that is to say, to all.\"38\n\nBY THE TIME I LEARNED of the discovery, however, gnosticism had already had become the focus of a remarkable amount of research. The first to investigate the gnostics were their orthodox contem- poraries. Attempting to prove that gnosticism was essentially non- Christian, they traced its origins to Greek philosophy, astrology, mystery religions, magic, and even Indian sources. Often they emphasized—and satirized—the bizarre elements that appear in some forms of gnostic mythology. Tertullian ridiculed the gnostics for creating elaborate cosmologies, with multi-storied heavens like apartment houses, \"with room piled on room, and assigned to each god by just as many stairways as there were heresies: The universe has been turned into rooms for rent!\"39 By the end of the nineteenth century, when the few original gnostic sources noted above were discovered, they inspired new research among scholars. The great German historian Adolf von Harnack, basing his research primarily on the church fathers, regarded gnosticism as a Christian heresy. Writing in 1894, Harnack explained that the gnostics, interpreting Christian doctrine in terms of Greek philosophy, became, in one sense, the \"first Christian theologians.\"40 But in the process, he contended, they distorted the Christian message, and propagated false, hybrid forms of Christian teaching—what\n\n[ xxix]\n\nIntroduction\n\nhe called the \"acute Hellenizing of Christianity.\"41 The British scholar Arthur Darby Nock agreed: gnosticism, he said, was a kind of \"Platonism run wild.\"42\n\nOther historians of religion objected. Far from being a Christian heresy, they said, gnosticism originally was an independent religious movement. In the early twentieth century the New Testament scholar Wilhelm Bousset, who traced gnosticism to ancient Babylonian and Persian sources, declared that\n\ngnosticism is first of all a pre-Christian movement which had roots in itself. It is therefore to be understood . . . in its own terms, and not as an offshoot or byproduct of the Christian religion.43\n\nOn this point the philologist Richard Reitzenstein agreed; but Reitzenstein went on to argue that gnosticism derived from ancient Iranian religion and was influenced by Zoroastrian traditions.44 Others, including Professor M. Friedländer, maintained that gnosticism originated in Judaism: the heretics whom the rabbis attacked in the first and second centuries, said Friedlander, were Jewish gnostics.45\n\nIn 1934—more than ten years before the Nag Hammadi discoveries—two important new books appeared. Professor Hans Jonas, turning from the question of the historical sources of gnosticism, asked where it originated existentially. Jonas suggested that gnosticism emerged in a certain \"attitude toward existence.\" He pointed out that the political apathy and cultural stagnation of the Eastern empire in the first two centuries of this era coincided with the influx of Oriental religion into Hellenistic culture. According to Jonas' analysis, many people at the time felt profoundly alienated from the world in which they lived, and longed for a miraculous salvation as an escape from the constraints of political and social existence. Using the few sources available to him with penetrating insight, Jonas reconstructed a gnostic world view—a philosophy of pessimism about the world combined with an attempt at self- transcendence.46 A nontechnical version of his book, translated into English, remains,\n\n[ xxx]\n\nIntroduction\n\neven today, the classic introduction.47 In an epilogue added to the second edition of this book, Jonas drew a parallel between gnosticism and twentieth-century existentialism, acknowledging his debt to existentialist philosophers, especially to Heidegger, in forming his interpretation of \"the gnostic religion.\"48\n\nAnother scholar, Walter Bauer, published a very different view of gnosticism in 1934. Bauer recognized that the early Christian movement was itself far more diverse than orthodox sources chose to indicate. So, Bauer wrote,\n\nperhaps—I repeat, perhaps—certain manifestations of Christian life that the authors of the church renounce as \"heresies\" originally had not been such at all, but, at least here and there, were the only forms of the new religion; that is, for those regions, they were simply \"Christianity.\" The possibility also exists that their adherents . . . looked down with hatred and scorn on the orthodox, who for them were the false believers.49\n\nBauer's critics, notably the British scholars H. E. W. Turner50 and C. H. Roberts,51 have criticized him for oversimplifying the situation and for overlooking evidence that did not fit his theory. Certainly Bauer's suggestion that, in certain Christian groups, those later called \"heretics\" formed the majority, goes beyond even the gnostics' own claims: they typically characterized themselves as \"the few\" in relation to \"the many\" (hoi polloi). But Bauer, like Jonas, opened up new ways of thinking about gnosticism.\n\nThe discoveries at Nag Hammadi in 1945 initiated, as Doresse had foreseen, a whole new epoch of research. The first and most important task was to preserve, edit, and publish the texts themselves. An international team of scholars, including Professors A. Guillaumont and H.-Ch. Puech from France, G. Quispel from the Netherlands, W. Till from Germany, and Y. ‘Abd al Masih from Egypt, collaborated in publishing the Gospel of Thomas in 1959.52 Many of the same scholars worked with Professors M. Malinine of France, R. Kasser of Germany, J. Zandee of the Netherlands, and R. McL. Wilson of Scotland\n\n[ xxxi]\n\nIntroduction\n\nto edit the texts from Codex I. Professor James M. Robinson, secretary of the International Committee for the Nag Hammadi Codices, organized a team of scholars from Europe, Canada, and the United States to edit the facsimile edition of photographs53 as well as a complete scholarly edition of the whole find in Coptic and English. Robinson sent copies of manuscripts and translations to colleagues in Berlin. There, members of the Berliner Arbeitskreis für koptisch- gnostische Schriften (Berlin Working-Group for Coptic-Gnostic Texts), a circle that includes such eminent scholars as Professors H. M. Schenke, K. M. Fischer, and K. W. Tröger, and collaborates with others, including E. Haenchen, W. Schmithals, and K. Rudolf, has prepared editions of the texts in Coptic and German, as well as numerous commentaries, books, and articles.\n\nWhat could this wealth of new material tell us about gnosticism? The abundance of the texts—and their diversity—made generali- zation difficult, and consensus even more difficult. Acknowledging this, most scholars now agree that what we call \"gnosticism\" was a widespread movement that derived its sources from various traditions. A few of the texts describe the multiple heavens, with magic passwords for each one, that the church fathers who had criticized gnosticism led scholars to expect; but many others, surprisingly, contain nothing of the kind. Much of the literature discovered at Nag Hammadi is distinctively Christian; some texts, however, show little or no Christian influence; a few derive primarily from pagan sources (and may not be \"gnostic\" at all); others make extensive use of Jewish traditions. For this reason, the German scholar C. Colpe has challenged the historians' search for the \"origins of gnosticism.\"54 This method, Colpe insists, leads to a potentially infinite regress of ever remoter \"origins\" without contributing much to our understanding of what gnosticism actually is.\n\nRecently several scholars have sought the impetus for the development of gnosticism not in terms of it cultural origins, but in specific events or experiences. Professor R. M. Grant has suggested that gnosticism emerged as a reaction to the shattering\n\n[ xxxii]\n\nIntroduction\n\nof traditional religious views—Jewish and Christian—after the Romans destroyed Jerusalem in A.D. 70.55 Quispel proposed that gnosticism originated in a potentially universal \"experience of the self\" projected into religious mythology.56 Jonas has offered a typological scheme describing gnosticism as a specific kind of philosophical world view.57 The British scholar E. R. Dodds characterized gnosticism as a movement whose writings derived from mystical experience.58 Gershom Scholem, the eminent Professor of Jewish Mysticism at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem, agrees with Dodds that gnosticism involves mystical speculation and practice. Tracing esoteric currents in rabbinic circles that were contemporary with the development of gnosticism, Scholem calls them forms of \"Jewish gnosticism.\"59\n\nToday, those investigating the Nag Hammadi texts are less concerned about constructing comprehensive theories than analyzing in detail the sources unearthed at Nag Hammadi. There are several different types of research, each investigating primarily those specific groups of texts appropriate to the purposes of the inquiry. One type of research, concerned with the relationship of gnosticism to Hellenistic philosophy, focuses primarily on those Nag Hammadi texts that exemplify this relationship. Contributors to this aspect of research include, for example (besides Hans Jonas), the British scholars A. D. Nock60 and A. H. Armstrong,61 and such American scholars as Professors Bentley Layton62 of Yale University and Harold Attridge of Southern Methodist University.63 Professor Morton Smith of Columbia University, on the other hand, whose current research concerns the history of magic, investigates the sources that evince magical practice.64\n\nA second direction of research investigates gnostic texts from a literary and form-critical point of view. Much of this work was initiated by J. M. Robinson and H. Koester in their book Trajectories Through Early Christianity.65 Others have explored the rich symbolism of gnostic texts. The French scholar M. Tardieu, for example, has analyzed gnostic myths;66 Professor L. Schottroff has investigated gnostic accounts of the\n\n[ xxxiii]\n\nIntroduction\n\npowers of evil.67 Many of their American colleagues, too, have contributed to the literary analysis of gnostic sources. Professor P. Perkins has investigated both genre68 and imagery;69 Professor George MacRae has contributed to our understandings of gnostic metaphors,70 myth,71 and literary form;72 he and others, including Quispel and Professor B. A. Pearson, have shown how certain gnostic myths drew upon material traditional in Judaism.73\n\nA third direction of research (which often overlaps with the second) explores the relation of gnosticism to its contemporary religious environment. While Scholem, MacRae, Quispel, Pearson (to name a few) have demonstrated that some gnostic sources refer extensively to Jewish tradition, others are examining the question: What do the gnostic texts tell us about the origins of Christianity? The many scholars who have shared in this research, besides those mentioned above, include Professors R. M. Grant and E. Yamauchi in the United States; R. McL. Wilson in Scotland; G. C. Stead and H. Chadwick in England; W. C. van Unnik in the Netherlands; H.-Ch. Puech and Dr. S. Petrement in France; A. Orbe in Spain; S. Arai in Japan; J. Menard and F. Wisse in Canada; and, in Germany, besides the members of the Berliner Arbeitskreis, A. Böhlig and Dr. K. Koschorke. Because my own research falls into this category (i.e., gnosticism and early Christianity), I have selected primarily the gnostic Christian sources as the basis for this book. Rather than considering the question of the origins of gnosticism, I intend here to show how gnostic forms of Christianity interact with orthodoxy—and what this tells us about the origins of Christianity itself.\n\nGiven the enormous amount of current research in the field, this sketch is necessarily brief and incomplete. Whoever wants to follow the research in detail will find invaluable help in the Nag Hammadi Bibliography, published by Professor D. M. Scholer.74 Kept up to date by regular supplements published in the journal Novum Testamentum, Scholer's bibliography currently lists nearly 4,000 books, editions, articles, and reviews\n\n[ xxxiv]\n\nIntroduction\n\npublished in the last thirty years concerning research on the Nag Hammadi texts.\n\nYet even the fifty-two writings discovered at Nag Hammadi offer only a glimpse of the complexity of the early Christian movement. We now begin to see that what we call Christianity—and what we identify as Christian tradition—actually represents only a small selection of specific sources, chosen from among dozens of others. Who made that selection, and for what reasons? Why were these other writings excluded and banned as \"heresy\"? What made them so dangerous? Now, for the first time, we have the opportunity to find out about the earliest Christian heresy; for the first time, the heretics can speak for themselves.\n\nGnostic Christians undoubtedly expressed ideas that the orthodox abhored. For example, some of these gnostic texts question whether all suffering, labor, and death derive from human sin, which, in the orthodox version, marred an originally perfect creation. Others speak of the feminine element in the divine, celebrating God as Father and Mother. Still others suggest that Christ's resurrection is to be understood symbolically, not literally. A few radical texts even denounce catholic Christians themselves as heretics, who, although they \"do not understand mystery . . . boast that the mystery of truth belongs to them alone.\"75 Such gnostic ideas fascinated the psychoanalyst C. G. Jung: he thought they expressed \"the other side of the mind\"—the spontaneous, unconscious thoughts that any orthodoxy requires its adherents to repress.\n\nYet orthodox Christianity, as the apostolic creed defines it, contains some ideas that many of us today might find even stranger. The creed requires, for example, that Christians confess that God is perfectly good, and still, he created a world that includes pain, injustice, and death; that Jesus of Nazareth was born of a virgin mother; and that, after being executed by order of the Roman procurator, Pontius Pilate, he arose from his grave \"on the third day.\"\n\n[xxxv]\n\nIntroduction\n\nWhy did the consensus of Christian churches not only accept these astonishing views but establish them as the only true form of Christian doctrine? Traditionally, historians have told us that the orthodox objected to gnostic views for religious and philosophic reasons. Certainly they did; yet investigation of the newly discovered gnostic sources suggests another dimension of the controversy. It suggests that these religious debates—questions of the nature of God, or of Christ—simultaneously bear social and political implications that are crucial to the development of Christianity as an institutional religion. In simplest terms, ideas which bear implications contrary to that development come to be labeled as \"heresy\"; ideas which implicitly support it become \"orthodox.\"\n\nBy investigating the texts from Nag Hammadi, together with sources known for well over a thousand years from orthodox tradition, we can see how politics and religion coincide in the development of Christianity. We can see, for example, the political implications of such orthodox doctrines as the bodily resurrection—and how gnostic views of resurrection bear opposite implications. In the process, we can gain a startlingly new perspective on the origins of Christianity.\n\n[xxxvi]\n\nThe Controversy over\n\nChrist's Resurrection:\n\nHistorical Event or Symbol?\n\n\"JESUS CHRIST ROSE from the grave.\" With this proclamation, the Christian church began. This may be the fundamental element of Christian faith; certainly it is the most radical. Other religions celebrate cycles of birth and death: Christianity insists that in one unique historical moment, the cycle reversed, and a dead man came back to life! For Jesus' followers this was the turning point in world history, the sign of its coming end. Orthodox Christians since then have confessed in the creed that Jesus of Nazareth, \"crucified, dead, and buried,\" was raised \"on the third day.\"1 Many today recite that creed without thinking about what they are saying, much less actually believing it. Recently some ministers, theologians, and scholars have challenged the literal view of resurrection. To account for this doctrine, they point out its psychological appeal to our deepest fears and hopes; to explain it, they offer symbolic interpretations. But much of the early tradition insists literally that a man —Jesus—had come back to life. What makes these Christian\n\n[3]\n\nTHE G N O S T I C G O S P E L S\n\naccounts so extraordinary is not the claim that his friends had \"seen\" Jesus after his death—ghost stories, hallucinations, and visions were even more commonplace then than now—but that they saw an actual human being. At first, according to Luke, the disciples themselves, in their astonishment and terror at the appearance of Jesus among them, immediately assumed that they were seeing his ghost. But Jesus challenged them: \"Handle me and see, for a spirit does not have flesh and bones, as you see that I have.\"2 Since they remained incredulous, he asked for something to eat; as they watched in amazement, he ate a piece of broiled fish. The point is clear: no ghost could do that.\n\nHad they said that Jesus' spirit lived on, surviving bodily decay, their contemporaries might have thought that their stories made sense. Five hundred years before, Socrates' disciples had claimed that their teacher's soul was immortal. But what the Christians said was different, and, in ordinary terms, wholly implausible. The finality of death, which had always been a part of the human experience, was being transformed. Peter contrasts King David, who died and was buried, and whose tomb was well known, with Jesus, who, although killed, rose from the grave, \"because it was not possible for him to be held by it\"—that is, by death.3 Luke says that Peter excluded metaphorical interpretation of the event he said he witnessed: \"[We] ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead.\"4\n\nTertullian, a brilliantly talented writer (A.D. C. 190), speaking for the majority, defines the orthodox position: as Christ rose bodily from the grave, so every believer should anticipate the resurrection of the flesh. He leaves no room for doubt. He is not, he says, talking about the immortality of the soul: \"The salvation of the soul I believe needs no discussion: for almost all heretics, in whatever way they accept it, at least do not deny it.\"5 What is raised is \"this flesh, suffused with blood, built up with bones, interwoven with nerves, entwined with veins, (a flesh) which . . . was born, and . . . dies, undoubtedly human.\"6 Tertullian expects the idea of Christ's suffering, death, and\n\n[4]\n\nThe Controversy over Christ's Resurrection\n\nresurrection to shock his readers; he insists that \"it must be believed, because it is absurd! \"7\n\nYet some Christians—those he calls heretics—dissent. Without denying the resurrection, they reject the literal interpretation; some find it \"extremely revolting, repugnant, and impossible.\" Gnostic Christians interpret resurrection in various ways. Some say that the person who experiences the resurrection does not meet Jesus raised physically back to life; rather, he encounters Christ on a spiritual level. This may occur in dreams, in ecstatic trance, in visions, or in moments of spiritual illumination. But the orthodox condemn all such interpretations; Tertullian declares that anyone who denies the resurrection of the flesh is a heretic, not a Christian.\n\nWhy did orthodox tradition adopt the literal view of resurrection? The question becomes even more puzzling when we look at what the New Testament says about it. Some accounts, like the story we noted from Luke, tell how Jesus appears to his disciples in the form they know from his earthly life; he eats with them, and invites them to touch him, to prove that he is \"not a ghost.\" John tells a similar story: Thomas declares that he will not believe that Jesus had actually risen from the grave unless he personally can see and touch him. When Jesus appears, he tells Thomas, \"Put your finger here, and see my hands; and put out your hand, and place it in my side; do not be faithless, but believing.\"8 But other stories, directly juxtaposed with these, suggest different views of the resurrection. Luke and Mark both relate that Jesus appeared \"in another form\"9—not his former earthly form—to two disciples as they walked on the road to Emmaus. Luke says that the disciples, deeply troubled about Jesus' death, talked with the stranger, apparently for several hours. They invited him to dinner; when he sat down with them to bless the bread, suddenly they recognized him as Jesus. At that moment \"he vanished out of their sight.\"10 John, too, places directly before the story of \"doubting Thomas\" another of a very different kind: Mary\n\n[5]\n\nTHE G N O S T I C GOSPELS\n\nMagdalene, mourning for Jesus near his grave, sees a man she takes to be the gardener. When he speaks her name, suddenly she recognizes the presence of Jesus—but he orders her not to touch him.11\n\nSo if some of the New Testament stories insist on a literal view of resurrection, others lend themselves to different interpretations. One could suggest that certain people, in moments of great emotional stress, suddenly felt that they experienced Jesus' presence. Paul's experience can be read this way. As he traveled on the Damascus road, intent on arresting Christians, \"suddenly a light from heaven flashed about him. And he fell to the ground,\" hearing the voice of Jesus rebuking him for the intended persecution.12 One version of this story says, \"The men who were traveling with him stood speechless, hearing the voice, but seeing no one\";13 another says the opposite (as Luke tells it, Paul said that \"those who were with me saw the light, but did not hear the voice of the one who was speaking to me\").14 Paul himself, of course, later defended the teaching on resurrection as fundamental to Christian faith. But although his discussion often is read as an argument for bodily resurrection, it concludes with the words \"I tell you this, brethren: flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God, nor does the perishable [that is, the mortal body] inherit the imperishable.\"15 Paul describes the resurrection as \"a mystery,\"16 the transformation from physical to spiritual existence.\n\nIf the New Testament accounts could support a range of interpretations, why did orthodox Christians in the second century insist on a literal view of resurrection and reject all others as heretical? I suggest that we cannot answer this question adequately as long as we consider the doctrine only in terms of its religious content. But when we examine its practical effect on the Christian movement, we can see, paradoxically, that the doctrine of bodily resurrection also serves an essential political function: it legitimizes the authority of certain men who claim to exercise exclusive leadership over the churches as the successors of the apostle Peter. From the second century, the doctrine has\n\n[6]\n\nThe Controversy over Christ's Resurrection\n\nserved to validate the apostolic succession of bishops, the basis of papal authority to this day. Gnostic Christians who interpret resurrection in other ways have a lesser claim to authority: when they claim priority over the orthodox, they are denounced as heretics.\n\nSuch political and religious authority developed in a most remarkable way. As we have noted, diverse forms of Christianity flourished in the early years of the Christian movement. Hundreds of rival teachers all claimed to teach the \"true doctrine of Christ\" and denounced one another as frauds. Christians in churches scattered from Asia Minor to Greece, Jerusalem, and Rome split into factions, arguing over church leadership. All claimed to represent \"the authentic tradition.\"\n\nHow could Christians resolve such contrary claims? Jesus himself was the only authority they all recognized. Even during his lifetime, among the small group traveling through Palestine with him, no one challenged—and no one matched—the authority of Jesus himself. Independent and assertive a leader as he was, Jesus censured such traits among his followers. Mark relates that when James and John came to him privately to ask for special positions in his administration, he spoke out sharply against their ambition:\n\nYou know that those who are supposed to rule over the Gentiles lord it over them, and their great men exercise authority over them. But it shall not be so among you; but whoever would be great among you must be your servant, and whoever would be first among you must be slave of all.17\n\nAfter Jesus' execution his followers scattered, shaken with grief and terrified for their own lives. Most assumed that their enemies were right—the movement had died with their master. Suddenly, astonishing news electrified the group. Luke says that they heard that \"the Lord has risen indeed, and has appeared to Simon [Peter]!\"18 What had he said to Peter? Luke's account suggested to Christians in later generations that he named Peter as his\n\n[ 7 ]\n\nTHE G N O S T I C G O S P E L S\n\nsuccessor, delegating the leadership to him. Matthew says that during his lifetime Jesus already had decided that Peter, the \"rock,\" was to found the future institution.19 Only John claims to tell what the risen Christ said: he told Peter that he was to take Jesus' place as \"shepherd\" for the flock.20\n\nWhatever the truth of this claim, we can neither verify nor disprove it on historical grounds alone. We have only secondhand testimony from believers who affirm it, and skeptics who deny it. But what we do know as historical fact is that certain disciples—notably, Peter— claimed that the resurrection had happened. More important, we know the result: shortly after Jesus' death, Peter took charge of the group as its leader and spokesman. According to John, he had received his authority from the only source the group recognized— from Jesus himself, now speaking from beyond the grave.\n\nWhat linked the group gathered around Jesus with the world-wide organization that developed within 170 years of his death into a three-rank hierarchy of bishops, priests, and deacons? Christians in later generations maintained that it was the claim that Jesus himself had come back to life! The German scholar Hans von Campenhausen says that because \"Peter was the first to whom Jesus appeared after his resurrection,\"21 Peter became the first leader of the Christian community. One can dispute Campenhausen's claim on the basis of New Testament evidence: the gospels of Mark and John both name Mary Magdalene, not Peter, as the first witness of the resurrection.22 But orthodox churches that trace their origin to Peter developed the tradition—sustained to this day among Catholic and some Protestant churches—that Peter had been the \"first witness of the resurrection,\" and hence the rightful leader of the church. As early as the second century, Christians realized the potential political consequences of having \"seen the risen Lord\": in Jerusalem, where James, Jesus' brother, successfully rivaled Peter's authority, one tradition maintained that James, not Peter (and certainly not Mary Magdalene) was the \"first witness of the resurrection.\"\n\n[8]\n\nThe Controversy over Christ's Resurrection\n\nNew Testament evidence indicates that Jesus appeared to many others besides Peter—Paul says that once he appeared to five hundred people simultaneously. But from the second century, orthodox churches developed the view that only certain resurrection appearances actually conferred authority on those who received them. These were Jesus' appearances to Peter and to \"the eleven\" (the disciples minus Judas Iscariot, who had betrayed Jesus and committed suicide).23 The orthodox noted the account in Matthew, which tells how the resurrected Jesus announced to \"the eleven\" that his own authority now has reached cosmic proportions: \"All authority, on heaven and on earth, has been given to me.\" Then he delegated that authority to \"the eleven disciples.\"24 Luke, too, indicates that although many others had known Jesus, and even had witnessed his resurrection, \"the eleven\" alone held the position of official witnesses—and hence became official leaders of the whole community. Luke relates that Peter, acting as spokesman for the group, proposed that since Judas Iscariot had defected, a twelfth man should now \"take the office\" that he vacated, restoring the group as \"the twelve.\"25 But to receive a share in the disciples' authority, Peter declared that he must be\n\none of the men who have accompanied us during all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us, beginning from the baptism of John until the day he was taken up from us—one of these men must become with us a witness to his resurrection.26\n\nMatthias, who met these qualifications, was selected and \"enrolled with the eleven apostles.\"27\n\nAfter forty days, having completed the transfer of power, he resurrected Lord abruptly withdrew his bodily presence from them, and ascended into heaven as they watched in amazement.28 Luke, who tells the story, sees this as a momentous event. Henceforth, for the duration of the world, no one would ever experience Christ's actual presence as the twelve disciples had during his lifetime—and for forty days after his death. After\n\n[9]\n\nTHE G N O S T I C G O S P E L S\n\nthat time, as Luke tells it, others received only less direct forms of communication with Christ. Luke admits that Stephen saw a vision of Jesus \"standing at the right hand of God\";29 that Paul first encountered Jesus in a dramatic vision, and later in a trance30 (Luke claims to record his words: \"When I had returned to Jerusalem and was praying in the temple, I fell into a trance and saw him speaking to me\"31). Yet Luke's account implies that these incidents cannot compare with the original events attested by the Twelve. In the first place, they occurred to persons not included among the Twelve. Second, they occurred only after Jesus' bodily ascension to heaven. Third, although visions, dreams, and ecstatic trances manifested traces of Christ's spiritual presence, the experience of the Twelve differed entirely. They alone, having known Jesus throughout his lifetime, could testify to those unique events which they knew firsthand—and to the resurrection of one who was dead to his complete, physical presence with them.32\n\nWhatever we think of the historicity of the orthodox account, we can admire its ingenuity. For this theory—that all authority derives from certain apostles' experience of the resurrected Christ, an experience now closed forever—bears enormous implications for the political structure of the community. First, as the German scholar Karl Holl has pointed out, it restricts the circle of leadership to a small band of persons whose members stand in a position of incontestable authority.33 Second, it suggests that only the apostles had the right to ordain future leaders as their successors.34 Christians in the second century used Luke's account to set the groundwork for establishing specific, restricted chains of command for all future generations of Christians. Any potential leader of the community would have to derive, or claim to derive, authority from the same apostles. Yet, according to the orthodox view, none can ever claim to equal their authority—much less challenge it. What the apostles experienced and attested their successors cannot verify for themselves; instead, they must only believe, protect, and hand down to future generations the apostles' testimony.35\n\n[10]\n\nThe Controversy over Christ's Resurrection\n\nThis theory gained extraordinary success: for nearly 2,000 years, orthodox Christians have accepted the view that the apostles alone held definitive religious authority, and that their only legitimate heirs are priests and bishops, who trace their ordination back to that same apostolic succession. Even today the pope traces his—and the primacy he claims over the rest—to Peter himself, \"first of the apostles,\" since he was \"first witness of the resurrection.\"\n\nBut the gnostic Christians rejected Luke's theory. Some gnostics called the literal view of resurrection the \"faith of fools.\"36 The resurrection, they insisted, was not a unique event in the past: instead, it symbolized how Christ's presence could be experienced in the present. What mattered was not literal seeing, but spiritual vision.37 They pointed out that many who witnessed the events of Jesus' life remained blind to their meaning. The disciples themselves often misunderstood what Jesus said: those who announced that their dead master had come back physically to life mistook a spiritual truth for an actual event.38 But the true disciple may never have seen the earthly Jesus, having been born at the wrong time, as Paul said of himself.39 Yet this physical disability may become a spiritual advantage: such persons, like Paul, may encounter Christ first on the level of inner experience.\n\nHow is Christ's presence experienced? The author of the Gospel of Mary, one of the few gnostic texts discovered before Nag Hammadi, interprets the resurrection appearances as visions received in dreams or in ecstatic trance. This gnostic gospel recalls traditions recorded in Mark and John, that Mary Magdalene was the first to see the risen Christ.40 John says that Mary saw Jesus on the morning of his resurrection, and that he appeared to the other disciples only later, on the evening of the same day.41 According to the Gospel of Mary, Mary Magdalene, seeing the Lord in a vision, asked him, \"How does he who sees the vision see it? [Through] the soul, [or] through the spirit?\"42 He answered that the visionary perceives through the mind. The Apocalypse of Peter, discovered at Nag Hammadi, tells how\n\n[11]\n\nTHE G N O S T I C G O S P E L S\n\nPeter, deep in trance, saw Christ, who explained that \"I am the intellectual spirit, filled with radiant light.\"43 Gnostic accounts often mention how the recipients respond to Christ's presence with intense emotions—terror, awe, distress, and joy.\n\nYet these gnostic writers do not dismiss visions as fantasies or hallucinations. They respect—even revere—such experiences, through which spiritual intuition discloses insight into the nature of reality. One gnostic teacher, whose Treatise on Resurrection, a letter to Rheginos, his student, was found at Nag Hammadi, says: \"Do not suppose that resurrection is an apparition [phantasia; literally, \"fantasy\"]. It is not an apparition; rather it is something real. Instead,\" he continues, \"one ought to maintain that the world is an apparition, rather than resurrection.\"44 Like a Buddhist master, Rheginos' teacher, himself anonymous, goes on to explain that ordinary human existence is spiritual death. But the resurrection is the moment of enlightenment: \"It is . . . the revealing of what truly exists . . . and a migration (metabole—change, transition) into newness.\"45 Whoever grasps this becomes spiritually alive. This means, he declares, that you can be \"resurrected from the dead\" right now: \"Are you—the real you—mere corruption? . . . Why do you not examine your own self, and see that you have arisen?\"46 A third text from Nag Hammadi, the Gospel of Philip, expresses the same view, ridiculing ignorant Christians who take the resurrection literally. \"Those who say they will die first and then rise are in error.\"47 Instead they must \"receive the resurrection while they live.\" The author says ironically that in one sense, then, of course \"it is necessary to rise 'in this flesh,' since everything exists in it! \"48\n\nWhat interested these gnostics far more than past events attributed to the \"historical Jesus\" was the possibility of encountering the risen Christ in the present.49 The Gospel of Mary illustrates the contrast between orthodox and gnostic viewpoints. The account recalls what Mark relates:\n\nNow when he rose early on the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene . . . She went and told\n\n[12]\n\nThe Controversy over Christ's Resurrection\n\nthose who had been with him, as they mourned and wept. But when they heard that he was alive and had been seen by her, they would not believe it.50\n\nAs the Gospel of Mary opens, the disciples are mourning Jesus' death and terrified for their own lives. Then Mary Magdalene stands up to encourage them, recalling Christ's continual presence with them: \"Do not weep, and do not grieve, and do not doubt; for his grace will be with you completely, and will protect you.\"51 Peter invites Mary to \"tell us the words of the Savior which you remember.\"52 But to Peter's surprise, Mary does not tell anecdotes from the past; instead, she explains that she has just seen the Lord in a vision received through the mind, and she goes on to tell what he revealed to her. When Mary finishes,\n\nshe fell silent, since it was to this point that the Savior had spoken with her. But Andrew answered and said to the brethren, \"Say what you will about what she has said. I, at least, do not believe that the Savior has said this. For certainly these teachings are strange ideas! \"53\n\nPeter agrees with Andrew, ridiculing the idea that Mary actually saw the Lord in her vision. Then, the story continues,\n\nMary wept and said to Peter, \"My brother Peter, what do you think? Do you think that I thought this up myself in my heart? Do you think I am lying about the Savior?\" Levi answered and said to Peter, \"Peter, you have always been hot-tempered . . . If the Savior made her worthy, who are you to reject her?\"54\n\nFinally Mary, vindicated, joins the other apostles as they go out to preach. Peter, apparently representing the orthodox position, looks to past events, suspicious of those who \"see the Lord\" in visions: Mary, representing the gnostic, claims to experience his continuing presence.55\n\nThese gnostics recognized that their theory, like the orthodox one, bore political implications. It suggests that whoever \"sees the Lord\" through inner vision can claim that his or her\n\n[13]\n\nTHE G N O S T I C G O S P E L S\n\nown authority equals, or surpasses, that of the Twelve—and of their successors. Consider the political implications of the Gospel of Mary: Peter and Andrew, here representing the leaders of the orthodox group, accuse Mary—the gnostic—of pretending to have seen the Lord in order to justify the strange ideas, fictions, and lies she invents and attributes to divine inspiration. Mary lacks the proper credentials for leadership, from the orthodox viewpoint: she is not one of the \"twelve.\" But as Mary stands up to Peter, so the gnostics who take her as their prototype challenge the authority of those priests and bishops who claim to be Peter's successors.\n\nWe know that gnostic teachers challenged the orthodox in precisely this way. While, according to them, the orthodox relied solely on the public, exoteric teaching which Christ and the apostles offered to \"the many,\" gnostic Christians claimed to offer, in addition, their secret teaching, known only to the few.56 The gnostic teacher and poet Valentinus (c. 140) points out that even during his lifetime, Jesus shared with his disciples certain mysteries, which he kept secret from outsiders.57 According to the New Testament gospel of Mark, Jesus said to his disciples,\n\n. . . \"To you has been given the secret of the kingdom of God, but for those outside everything is in parables; so that they may indeed see but not perceive, and may indeed hear but not understand; lest they should turn again, and be forgiven.\"58\n\nMatthew, too, relates that when Jesus spoke in public, he spoke only in parables; when his disciples asked the reason, he replied, \"To you it has been given to know the secrets [mysteria; literally, \"mysteries\"] of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it has not been given.\"59 According to the gnostics, some of the disciples, following his instructions, kept secret Jesus' esoteric teaching: this they taught only in private, to certain persons who had proven themselves to be spiritually mature, and who therefore\n\n[14]\n\nThe Controversy over Christ's Resurrection\n\nqualified for \"initiation into gnosis\"—that is, into secret knowledge.\n\nFollowing the crucifixion, they allege that the risen Christ continued to reveal himself to certain disciples, opening to them, through visions, new insights into divine mysteries. Paul, referring to himself obliquely in the third person, says that he was \"caught up to the third heaven—whether in the body or out of the body I do not know.\" There, in an ecstatic trance, he heard \"things that cannot be told, which man may not utter.\"60 Through his spiritual communication with Christ, Paul says he discovered \"hidden mysteries\" and \"secret wisdom,\" which, he explains, he shares only with those Christians he considers \"mature\"61 but not with every- one. Many contemporary Biblical scholars, themselves orthodox, have followed Rudolph Bultmann, who insists that Paul does not mean what he says in this passage.62 They argue that Paul does not claim to have a secret tradition; such a claim would apparently make Paul sound too \"gnostic.\" Recently Professor Robin Scroggs has taken the opposite view, pointing out that Paul clearly says that he does have secret wisdom.63 Gnostic Christians in ancient times came to the same conclusion. Valentinus, the gnostic poet who traveled from Egypt to teach in Rome (c. 140), even claimed that he himself learned Paul's secret teaching from Theudas, one of Paul's own disciples.\n\nFollowers of Valentinus say that only their own gospels and revelations disclose those secret teachings. These writings tell countless stories about the risen Christ—the spiritual being whom Jesus represented—a figure who fascinated them far more than the merely human Jesus, the obscure rabbi from Nazareth. For this reason, gnostic writings often reverse the pattern of the New Testament gospels. Instead of telling the history of Jesus biographically, from birth to death, gnostic accounts begin where the others end—with stories of the spiritual Christ appearing to his disciples. The Apocryphon of John, for example, begins as John tells how he went out after the crucifixion in \"great grief\":\n\n[15]\n\nTHE G N O S T I C G O S P E L S\n\nImmediately . . . the [heavens were opened, and the whole] creation [which is] under heaven shone, and [the world] was shaken. [I was afraid, and I] saw in the light [a child] . . . while I looked he became like an old man. And he [changed his] form again, becoming like a servant . . . I saw . . . a[n image] with multiple forms in the light . . ,64\n\nAs he marveled, the presence spoke:\n\n\"John, Jo[h]n, why do you doubt, and why are you afraid? You are not unfamiliar with this form, are you? . . . Do not be afraid! I am the one who [is with you] always . . . [I have come to teach] you what is [and what was], and what will come to [be] . . .\"65\n\nThe Letter of Peter to Philip, also discovered at Nag Hammadi, relates that after Jesus' death, the disciples were praying on the Mount of Olives when\n\na great light appeared, so that the mountain shone from the sight of him who had appeared. And a voice called out to them saying \"Listen . . . I am Jesus Christ, who is with you forever.\"66\n\nThen, as the disciples ask him about the secrets of the universe, \"a voice came out of the light\" answering them. The Wisdom of Jesus Christ tells a similar story. Here again the disciples are gathered on a mountain after Jesus' death, when \"then there appeared to them the Redeemer, not in his original form but in the invisible spirit. But his appearance was the appearance of a great angel of light.\" Responding to their amazement and terror, he smiles, and offers to teach them the \"secrets [mysteria; literally, \"mysteries\"] of the holy plan\" of the universe and its destiny.67\n\nBut the contrast with the orthodox view is striking.68 Here Jesus does not appear in the ordinary human form the disciples recognize—and certainly not in bodily form. Either he appears as a luminous presence speaking out of the light, or he transforms himself into multiple forms. The Gospel of Philip takes up the same theme:\n\n[16]\n\nThe Controversy over Christ's Resurrection\n\nJesus took them all by stealth, for he did not reveal himself in the manner [in which] he was, but in the manner in which [they would] be able to see him. He revealed himself to [them all. He revealed himself] to the great as great. . . (and) to the small as small.69\n\nTo the immature disciple, Jesus appears as a child; to the mature, as an old man, symbol of wisdom. As the gnostic teacher Theodotus says, \"each person recognizes the Lord in his own way, not all alike.\"70\n\nOrthodox leaders, including Irenaeus, accused the gnostics of fraud. Such texts as those discovered at Nag Hammadi—the Gospel of Thomas, the Gospel of Philip, the Letter of Peter to Philip, and the Apocryphon (Secret Book) of John—proved, according to Irenaeus, that the heretics were trying to pass off as \"apostolic\" what they themselves had invented. He declares that the followers of the gnostic teacher Valentinus, being \"utterly reckless,\"\n\nput forth their own compositions, while boasting that they have more gospels than there really are . . . They really have no gospel which is not full of blasphemy. For what they have published . . . is totally unlike what has been handed down to us from the apostles.71\n\nWhat proves the validity of the four gospels, Irenaeus says, is that they actually were written by Jesus' own disciples and their followers, who personally witnessed the events they described. Some contemporary Biblical scholars have challenged this view: few today believe that contemporaries of Jesus actually wrote the New Testament gospels. Although Irenaeus, defending their exclusive legitimacy, insisted that they were written by Jesus' own followers, we know virtually nothing about the persons who wrote the gospels we call Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. We only know that these writings are attributed to apostles (Matthew and John) or followers of the apostles (Mark and Luke).\n\nGnostic authors, in the same way, attributed their secret writings to various disciples. Like those who wrote the New\n\n[17]\n\nTHE G N O S T I C G O S P E L S\n\nTestament gospels, they may have received some of their material from early traditions. But in other cases, the accusation that the gnostics invented what they wrote contains some truth: certain gnostics openly acknowledged that they derived their gnosis from their own experience.\n\nHow, for example, could a Christian living in the second century write the Secret Book of John? We could imagine the author in the situation he attributes to John at the opening of the book: troubled by doubts, he begins to ponder the meaning of Jesus' mission and destiny. In the process of such internal questioning, answers may occur spontaneously to the mind; changing patterns of images may appear. The person who understands this process not in terms of modern psychology, as the activity of the imagination or unconscious, but in religious terms, could experience these as forms of spiritual communication with Christ. Seeing his own communion with Christ as a continuation of what the disciples enjoyed, the author, when he casts the \"dialogue\" into literary form, could well give to them the role of the questioners. Few among his contemporaries— except the orthodox, whom he considers \"literal- minded\"—would accuse him of forgery; rather, the titles of these works indicate that they were written \"in the spirit\" of John, Mary Magdalene, Philip, or Peter.\n\nAttributing a writing to a specific apostle may also bear a symbolic meaning. The title of the Gospel of Mary suggests that its revelation came from a direct, intimate communication with the Savior. The hint of an erotic relationship between him and Mary Magdalene may indicate claims to mystical communion; throughout history, mystics of many traditions have chosen sexual metaphors to describe their experiences. The titles of the Gospel of Thomas and the Book of Thomas the Contender (attributed to Jesus' \"twin brother\") may suggest that \"you, the reader, are Jesus' twin brother.\" Whoever comes to understand these books discovers, like Thomas, that Jesus is his \"twin,\" his spiritual \"other self.\" Jesus' words to Thomas, then, are addressed to the reader:\n\n[18]\n\nThe Controversy over Christ's Resurrection\n\n\"Since it has been said that you are my twin and true companion, examine yourself so that you may understand who you are . . . I am the knowledge of the truth. So while you accompany me, although you do not understand (it), you already have come to know, and you will be called 'the one who knows himself.' For whoever has not known himself has known nothing, but whoever has known himself has simultaneously achieved knowledge about the depth of all things.\"72\n\nLike circles of artists today, gnostics considered original creative invention to be the mark of anyone who becomes spiritually alive. Each one, like students of a painter or writer, expected to express his own perceptions by revising and transforming what he was taught. Whoever merely repeated his teacher's words was considered immature. Bishop Irenaeus complains that\n\nevery one of them generates something new every day, according to his ability; for no one is considered initiated [or: \"mature\"] among them unless he develops some enormous fictions!73\n\nHe charges that \"they boast that they are the discoverers and inventors of this kind of imaginary fiction,\" and accuses them of creating new forms of mythological poetry. No doubt he is ight: first- and second-century gnostic literature includes some remarkable poems, like the \"Round Dance of the Cross\"74 and the \"Thunder, Perfect Mind.\" Most offensive, from his point of view, is that they admit that nothing supports their writings except their own intuition. When challenged, \"they either mention mere human feelings, or else refer to the harmony that can be seen in creation\":75\n\nThey are to be blamed for . . . describing human feelings, and passions, and mental tendencies . . . and ascribing the things that happen to human beings, and whatever they recognize themselves as experiencing, to the divine Word.76\n\n[19]\n\nTHE GNOSTIC G O S P E L S\n\nOn this basis, like artists, they express their own insight—their own gnosis—by creating new myths, poems, rituals, \"dialogues\" with Christ, revelations, and accounts of their visions.\n\nLike Baptists, Quakers, and many others, the gnostic is convinced that whoever receives the spirit communicates directly with the divine. One of Valentinus' students, the gnostic teacher Heracleon (c. 160), says that \"at first, people believe because of the testimony of others . . .\" but then \"they come to believe from the truth itself.\"77 So his own teacher, Valentinus, claimed to have first learned Paul's secret teaching; then he experienced a vision which became the source of his own gnosis:\n\nHe saw a newborn infant, and when he asked who he might be, the child answered, \"I am the Logos.\"78\n\nMarcus, another student of Valentinus' (c. 150), who went on to become a teacher himself, tells how he came to his own firsthand knowledge of the truth. He says that a vision\n\ndescended upon him . . . in the form of a woman . . . and expounded to him alone its own nature, and the origin of things, which it had never revealed to anyone, divine or human.79\n\nThe presence then said to him,\n\n\"I wish to show you Truth herself; for I have brought her down from above, so that you may see her without a veil, and understand her beauty.\"80\n\nAnd that, Marcus adds, is how \"the naked Truth\" came to him in a woman's form, disclosing her secrets to him. Marcus expects, in turn, that everyone whom he initiates into gnosis will also receive such experiences. In the initiation ritual, after invoking the spirit, he commands the candidate to speak in prophecy,81 to demonstrate that the person has received direct contact with the divine.\n\nWhat differentiates these gnostics from those who, throughout the history of Christianity, have claimed to receive special visions and revelations, and who have expressed these in art,\n\n[20]\n\nThe Controversy over Christ's Resurrection\n\npoetry, and mystical literature? Christians who stand in orthodox tradition, Catholics and Protestants, expect that the revelations they receive will confirm (in principle, at least) apostolic tradition: this, they agree, sets the boundaries of Christian faith. The apostles' original teaching remains the criterion; whatever deviates is heresy. Bishop Irenaeus declares that the apostles,\n\nlike a rich man (depositing money) in a bank, placed in the church fully everything that belongs to truth: so that everyone, whoever will, can draw from her the water of life.82\n\nThe orthodox Christian believes \"the one and only truth from the apostles, which is handed down by the church.\" And he accepts no gospels but the four in the New Testament which erve as the canon (literally, \"guideline\") to measure all future doctrine and practice.\n\nBut the gnostic Christians, whom Irenaeus opposed, assumed that they had gone far beyond the apostles' original teaching. Just as many people today assume that the most recent experiments in science or psychology will surpass earlier ones, so the gnostics anticipated that the present and future would yield a continual increase in knowledge. Irenaeus takes this as proof of their arrogance:\n\nThey consider themselves \"mature,\" so that no one can be compared with them in the greatness of their gnosis, not even if you mention Peter or Paul or any of the other apostles. . . . They imagine that they themselves have discovered more than the apostles, and that the apostles preached the gospel still under the influence of Jewish opinions, but that they themselves are wiser and more intelligent than the apostles.83\n\nAnd those who consider themselves \"wiser than the apostles\" also consider themselves \"wiser than the priests.\"84 For what the gnostics say about the apostles—and, in particular, about the Twelve— expresses their attitude toward the priests and bishops, who claim to stand in the orthodox apostolic succession.\n\nBut despite their emphasis on free creativity, some gnostic\n\n[ 2 1 ]\n\nTHE G N O S T I C G O S P E L S\n\nteachers—rather inconsistently—claim to have their own, secret sources of \"apostolic tradition.\" Thereby they claim access to different lines of apostolic sucession from that commonly accepted in the churches. The gnostic teacher Ptolemy explains to Flora, a woman he sees as a potential initiate, that \"we too have received\" apostolic tradition from a sucession of teachers— one that, he says, offers an esoteric supplement to the canonical collection of Jesus' words.85\n\nGnostic authors often attribute their own traditions to persons who stand outside the circle of the Twelve—Paul, Mary Magdalene, and James. Some insist that the Twelve—including Peter—had not received gnosis when they first witnessed to Christ's resurrection. Another group of gnostics, called Sethians because they identified themselves as sons of Seth, the third child of Adam and Eve, say that the disciples, deluded by \"a very great error,\" imagined that Christ had risen from the dead in bodily form. But the risen Christ appeared to \"a few of these disciples, who he recognized were capable of understanding such great mysteries,\"86 and taught them to understand his resurrection in spiritual, not physical, terms. Furthermore, as we have seen, the Gospel of Mary depicts Mary Magdalene (never recognized as an apostle by the orthodox) as the one favored with visions and insight that far surpass Peter's. The Dialogue of the Savior praises her not only as a visionary, but as the apostle who excels all the rest. She is the \"woman who knew the All.\"87 Valentinus claims that his apostolic tradition comes from Paul—another outsider to the Twelve, but one of the greatest authorities of the orthodox, and, after Luke, the author most extensively represented in the New Testament.\n\nOther gnostics explain that certain members of the Twelve later received special visions and revelations, and so attained enlight- enment. The Apocalypse of Peter describes how Peter, deep in trance, experiences the presence of Christ, who opens his eyes to spiritual insight:\n\n[The Savior] said to me . . .,\". . . put your hands upon (your) eyes . . . and say what you see!\" But when I\n\n[22]\n\nThe Controversy over Christ's Resurrection\n\nhad done it, I did not see anything. I said, \"No one sees (this way).\" Again he told me, \"Do it again.\" And there came into me fear with joy, for I saw a new light, greater than the light of day. Then it came down upon the Savior. And I told him about the things which I saw.88\n\nThe Secret Book of James tells how \"the twelve disciples were all sitting together and recalling what the Savior had said to each one of them, whether in secret or openly, and [setting it in order] in books.\"89 But when Christ appeared, he chose Peter and James, and drew them apart from the rest to tell them what the others were not to know. Either version of this theory bears the same implication: it asserts the superiority of gnostic forms of secret tradition—and hence, of gnostic teachers—over that of the priests and bishops, who can offer only \"common\" tradition. Further, ecause earlier traditions, from this point of view, are at best incomplete, and at worst simply false, gnostic Christians continually drew upon their own spiritual experience—their own gnosis—to revise and transform them.\n\nBut what gnostics celebrated as proof of spiritual maturity, the orthodox denounced as \"deviation\" from apostolic tradition. Tertullian finds it outrageous that\n\nevery one of them, just as it suits his own temperament, modifies the traditions he has received, just as the one who handed them down modified them, when he shaped them according to his own will.90\n\nhat they \"disagree on specific matters, even from their own founders\" meant to Tertullian that they were \"unfaithful\" to apostolic tradition. Diversity of teaching was the very mark of heresy:\n\nOn what grounds are heretics strangers and enemies to the apostles, if it is not from the difference of their teaching, which each individual of his own mere will has either advanced or received?91\n\nDoctrinal conformity defined the orthodox faith. Bishop Irenaeus declares that the catholic church\n\n[23]\n\nTHE G N O S T I C G O S P E L S\n\nbelieves these points of doctrine just as if she had only one soul, and one and the same heart, and she proclaims them and teaches them in perfect harmony. . . . For although the languages of the world are different, still the meaning of the tradition is one and the same. For the churches which have been planted in Germany do not believe or hand down anything different, nor do those in Spain, nor those in Gaul, nor those in the east, nor those in Egypt, nor those in Africa, nor those which have been established in the central regions of the world .92\n\nWhat would happen if arguments did arise among such scattered churches? Who should decide which traditions would take priority? Irenaeus considers the question:\n\nBut how is it? Suppose a dispute concerning some important question arises among us; should we not have recourse to the most ancient churches, with which the apostles held continual intercourse, and learn from them what is clear and certain in regard to the present question?93\n\nIrenaeus prescribes terminating any disagreement\n\nby indicating that tradition, derived-from the apostles, of the very great, the very ancient, and universally known church founded and organized at Rome by the two most glorious apostles, Peter and Paul . . . and by indicating the faith . . . which came down to our time by means of the succession of the bishops. For it is necessary that every church should agree with this church, on account of its preeminent authority.94\n\nSince no one of later generations can have access to Christ as the apostles did, during his lifetime and at his resurrection, every believer must look to the church at Rome, which they founded, and to the bishops for authority.\n\nSome gnostic Christians counterattacked. The Apocalypse of Peter, probably among the latest writings discovered at Nag Hammadi (c. 200-300), tells how dismayed Peter was to hear\n\n[24]\n\nThe Controversy over Christ's Resurrection\n\nthat many believers \"will fall into an erroneous name\" and \"will be ruled heretically.\"95 The risen Christ explains to Peter that those who \"name themselves bishop, and also deacon, as if they had received their authority from God,\" are, in reality, \"waterless can"
