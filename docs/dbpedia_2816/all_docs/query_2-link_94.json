Its aim is to present these texts in a uniform edition that will promptly follow the appearance of The Facsimile Edition o f the Nag Ham­ madi Codices and that can be a basis for more detailed technical and interpre­ tive investigations. Further studies of this sort are expected to appear in the monograph series Nag Hammadi Studies, of which the present edition is a part. The gnostic religion was not only a force that interacted with early Chris­ tianity and Judaism in their formative periods, but also a significant religious position in its own right. General acceptance of this modem insight had been seriously impeded by the scarcity of original source material. Now this situa­ tion has been decisively altered. It is thus under a sense of obligation imposed by the discovery of these largely unique documents that the present edition has been prepared. This edition is a project of the Institute for Antiquity and Christianity, Claremont, California. The translation team consists of Harold W. Attridge, J. W. B. Bam st, Hans-Gebhard Bethge, Alexander Bohlig, James Brashler, G. M. Browne, Roger A. Bullard, Peter A. Dirkse, Stephen Emmel, Joseph A. Gibbons, S0ren Giversen, Charles W. Hedrick, Wesley W. Isenberg, T. O. Lambdin, Bentley Layton, Violet MacDermot, George W. MacRaef, Dieter Muellert, William R. Murdock, Douglas M. Parrott, Birger A. Pearson, Mal­ colm L. Peel, James M. Robinson, William C. Robinson, Jr., William R. Schoedel, J. C. Shelton, John H. Sieber, John D. Turner, Francis E. Williams, R. McL. Wilson, Orval S. Wintermute, Frederik Wisse, and Jan Zandee. The project was initiated in 1966 with only a limited number of tractates accessible, but rapidly developed as the texts became increasingly available. In view of the fact that the bulk of the material in Codices I-V I had at that time either been published or announced for imminent publication in com­ plete editions in other languages, the edition in the Coptic Gnostic Library was envisaged in the complementary role of providing merely English trans­ lations in a single volume, which in subsequent planning was then envisaged as two volumes. It was at this stage that preliminary announcements were made in New Testament Studies 16 (1969) 185-90 and Novum Testamentum 12 (1970) 83-85, reprinted in Essays on the Coptic Gnostic Library (Leiden: Brill, 1970). The publisher and editorial board of Nag Hammadi Studies at their meeting in Uppsala, Sweden, in August 1973, recommended that the Coptic Gnostic Library edition be complete for Codices I-V I and BG as well as for VII-XIII. This plan was adopted by the volume editors at their Sep­ tember 1973 work session in Cairo. This resulted in Codices I—VI and BG\n\nVlll\n\nFOREWORD\n\nbeing planned for six, then nine volumes. They do not correspond precisely to the seven codices, for it is preferable to publish parallel texts together. Thus the present volume presents in parallel columns the two copies of Eug­ nostos (III,J and V ,7) and the two copies of its Christianized second edition, The Sophia o f Jesus Christ (111,4 and BG,5) in order to facilitate study of the complex interrelations involved. After it was decided to include in Nag Hammadi Studies a new English edition of the other Coptic Gnostic codices known previously, the Askew and Bruce codices, the publisher included them in the Coptic Gnostic Library to make it complete. The volumes and the editors of the Coptic Gnostic Library are as follows: Nag Hammadi Codex I (The Jung Codex): Volume I, Introduction, Texts, and Translation; Volume 2, Notes, volume editor Harold W. Attridge; NHS 22 and 23, 1985; Nag Hammadi Codices 11,1 and IV,1: The Apocryphon o f John, Long Recension, edited by Frederik Wisse, NHS 32, in preparation; Nag Ham­ madi Codex 11,2-7, together with XIII,2*, Brit. Lib. Or.4926(1), and P. Oxy. 1, 654, 655: Volume 1, Gospel According to Thomas, Gospel According to Phi­ lip, Hypostasis o f the Archons, Indexes; Volume 2, On the Origin o f the World, Expository Treatise on the Soul, Book o f Thomas the Contender, Indexes, edited by Bentley Layton, NHS 20 and 21, 1989; Nag Hammadi Codex 111,1 and Papyrus Berolinensis 8502,2: The Apocryphon o f John, Short Recension, edited by Peter Nagel, volume editor Frederik Wisse; Nag Ham­ madi Codices 111,2 and IV,2: The Gospel o f the Egyptians (The Holy Book of the Great Invisible Spirit), edited by Alexander Bohlig and Frederik Wisse in cooperation with Pahor Labib, NHS 4, 1975; Nag Hammadi Codices 1113 -4 and V,1 with Papyrus Berolinensis 8502,3 and Oxyrhynchus Papyrus 1081: Eugnostos and The Sophia o f Jesus Christ, edited and translated by Douglas M. Parrott, NHS 27, 1990; Nag Hammadi Codex 111,5: The Dialogue of the Savior, volume editor Stephen Emmel, NHS XX, 1984; Nag Hammadi Cod­ ices V,2-5 and VI with Papyrus Berolinensis 8502,1 and 4, volume editor Douglas M. Parrott, NHS 11, 1979; Nag Hammadi Codex VII, volume editor Frederik Wisse; Nag Hammadi Codex VIII, volume editor John H. Sieber, NHS 31, in the press; Nag Hammadi Codices IX and X, volume editor Birger A. Pearson, NHS 15, 1981; Nag Hammadi Codices XI, XII and XIII, volume editor Charles W. Hedrick, NHS 28,1990; Nag Hammadi Codices: Greek and Coptic Papyri from the Cartonnage o f the Covers, edited by J. W. B. Bamsf, G. M. Browne and J. C. Shelton, NHS 16, 1981; Pistis Sophia, text edited by Carl Schmidt, translation and notes by Violet MacDermot, volume editor R. McL. Wilson, NHS 9, 1978; The Books ofJeu and the Untitled Text in the Bruce Codex, edited by Carl Schmidt, translation and notes by Violet Mac­ Dermot, volume editor R. McL. Wilson, NHS 13, 1978. Thus, as now envisaged, the full scope of the edition is seventeen volumes. An English translation of all thirteen Nag Hammadi Codices and P. Berol. 8502 has also been published in 1977 in a single volume, The Nag Hammadi Library in English, by E. J. Brill and Harper & Row. A first paperback edition of that preprint augmented by the inclusion of Yale inv. 1784 of the Beinecke Library at NHC III 145/146 (p. 238) appeared in 1981 at Harper & Row and\n\nFOREWORD\n\nix\n\nin 1984 at E. J. Brill. It was not possible to include there subsequent improve­ ments in translations. A third, completely revised edition appeared in 1988 at E. J. Brill and Harper & Row. The team research of the project has been supported primarily through the Institute for Antiquity and Christianity by the National Endowment for the Humanities, the American Philosophical Society, the John Simon Gug­ genheim Memorial Foundation, and Claremont Graduate School; and through the American Research Center in Egypt by the Smithsonian Institution. Members of the project have participated in the preparatory work of the Technical Sub-Committee of the International Committee for the Nag Ham­ madi Codices, which has been done at the Coptic Museum in Cairo under the sponsorship of the Arab Republic of Egypt and u nesco . The extensive work in the reassembly of fragments, the reconstruction of page sequence, and the col­ lation of the transcriptions by the originals not only served the immediate needs of the facsimile edition, but also provided a basis for a critical edition. Without such generous support and such mutual cooperation of all parties con­ cerned this edition could not have been prepared. Therefore we wish to express our sincere gratitude to all who have been involved. A special word of thanks is due to the Egyptian and unesco officials through whose assistance the work has been carried on: Gamal Mokhtar, President until 1977 of the Egyptian Antiquities Organization, our gracious and able host in Egypt; Pahor Labib, Victor Girgis, and Mounir Basta, Direc­ tors Emeriti, and Dr. Gawdat Gabra, currently Director of the Coptic Museum, who together have guided the work on the manuscript material; Samiha Abd El-Shaheed, First Curator for Manuscripts at the Coptic Museum, who is per­ sonally responsible for the codices and was constantly by our side in the rooms of the Coptic Museum; and, at unesco , N. Bammate, Deputy Assistant Direc­ tor General for the Social Sciences, Human Sciences, and Culture until 1978, who has guided the unesco planning since its beginning, and Dina Zeidan, spe­ cialist in the Arab Program of the Division of Cultural Studies, who has always proved ready with gracious assistance and helpful advice. Gary A. Bisbee (Chiron Inc.) in conjunction with the Computer Based Laboratory of Harvard University has designed the Coptic characters, key­ punched the manuscript and produced the camera-ready copy for this volume with great commitment and competence. Edmund S. Meltzer was kind enough to read the typescript and make valu­ able suggestions before the volume went to press. We also wish to acknowledge our great indebtedness to the directors of E.J. Brill during the years in which this volume was in preparation, F.C. Wieder, Jr., Director Emeritus, the late T. A. Edridge, and Dr. W. Backhuys, Director Emeritus, and Drs. M. G. Elisabeth Venekamp, Vice-President, who is in charge of Nag Hammadi Studies for Brill. James M. Robinson General Editor\n\nPR EFA C E This project was begun in 1967, while I was a graduate student at the Gra­ duate Theological Union. In connection with the Coptic Gnostic Library Project at the Institute for Antiquity and Christianity, James M. Robinson suggested that I try to produce the parallels of Eug and 5/C , using the only source then available to us, namely, the text of Till’s edition of BG and his footnotes, which contained the variants from 5/C -B G found in Eug-III and 5/C-III. His hope was that we might be able to test the then recently pub­ lished arguments of Krause regarding the priority of Eug. The result was somewhat less than satisfactory because of the gaps in £m#-III in Till’s edition— gaps made necessary by restricitons imposed upon him. When pho­ tos of the Nag Hammadi texts became available to the Institute for Antiquity and Christianity later in the decade, I began working on the parallels of Ewg-111 and 5/C -B G in translation (with variant readings in footnotes), which would have been part of the then projected volume of Codices I-VI in English translation only. When that was replaced in 1973, as a result of the decision to publish criti­ cal editions of all the texts, I put aside the parallels project in order to com­ plete Nag Hammadi Codices V, 2-5, and VI and Papyrus Berolinensis 8502, I and 4, which was published in 1979. I have worked on various aspects of this edition since that time, using portions of the earlier work. I want to express my thanks to a number of persons who have helped with this project. Stephen Emmel, while working as the Cairo representative of the Coptic Gnostic Library Project, recollated Eug III and retranscribed 5/C-III, both with the aid of ultraviolet light, identified important fragments in Eug-V (after publication of the facsimile edition) and provided invaluable feedback for textual questions about Eug-V. Bentley Layton, while he was also in Cairo, recollated the whole of E ug-V with the use of ultraviolet light and made numerous important suggestions regarding the filling of lacunae. Martin Krause made available an early draft of his anticipated parallel edi­ tion. Hans-Martin Schenke provided photos of BG. And Harold Attridge lent his infrared photos of P. Oxy. 1081 for the new edition of that fragment included here. Egyptologist Leonard Lesko (then at UC Berkeley, now at Brown Univer­ sity) and his assistant David Larkin gave expert and invaluable advice regarding knotty translational problems during a week in Berkeley in the spring of 1981. Also, this edition has benefited in a variety of ways from the discussions at the fortnightly meetings of the Coptic Texts Seminar at Claremont Graduate School during the 1983-84 academic year. The regular participants in that group, besides myself, were James Goehring, Edmund S. Meltzer and James M. Robinson, all three from the CGS faculty; graduate students Jon Daniels,\n\nXll\n\nPREFACE\n\nClayton Jefford, Stephen Patterson and Leif Vaage; and Richard Smith, then Instructor in Coptic at Fuller Theological Seminary. Finally I want to thank Howard Jackson, Tulane Peterson, Jirair Tashjian and Leif Vaage, graduate students at CGS, who assisted me at various stages in the preparation of this volume. I am also grateful to Lenore Brashler for mediating expertly between me and her word processor. The editing of this volume was made possible in part by grants from the Committee on Research of the University of California at Riverside. Readers are requested to communicate to the general editor of the Coptic Gnostic Library any errors that may be found so that a list of corrections can be published.\n\nAlthough this volume was accepted for publication in 1984, for a variety of reasons, including the special problems involved in setting it up, actual publication has been delayed for some time. During this time, of course, scholarship has continued, and I have been able to take some of it into con­ sideration, but by no means all. I especially regret that limitations on the number of changes have not allowed me to incorporate references to Michel Tardieu’s translation, with notes and comments, of Eugnostos and the Sophia o f Jesus Christ in his Ecrits gnostiques: Codex de Berlin, Sources gnostiques et manicheennes 1 (1984). I anticipate making good use of it in a future commentary. Douglas M.

D ISCOVERY The thirteen Nag Hammadi codices were discovered in December, 1945, on the right bank of the Nile, near the town of al-Qasr (ancient Chenoboskia) and close to the larger town of Nag Hammadi, which is on the opposite bank.1 Facsimile editions of all thirteen have been published. The MSS are now preserved in the Coptic Museum in Old Cairo, Egypt. Evidence in the cartonnage used to stiffen the leather covers suggests the library was buried sometime in the last half of the fourth century C.E. (Bams et al.: nos. 63-65). It is possible the codices had been used by monks in the nearby Pachomian monasteries and were buried during a time of heresyhunting.2 P. Berolinensis 8502 (commonly designated simply BG) was purchased in or near the city of Achmim, Egypt, and acquired for the Berlin Museum in 1896. At first Carl Schmidt, who initially proposed to edit it, gave it a fifthcentury date, although subsequently he thought it should be dated later. Stegemann placed it in the early fifth century (Till-Schenke: 6-1)? II. PU B LIC A TIO N H ISTORY The four tractates published here are two versions of Eugnostos and two of The Sophia o f Jesus Christ. They are presented in parallel form because of the large amount of common material. Eugnostos (abbreviated, Eug-V) is the first tractate of Nag Hammadi Codex V (1,1-17,18) and has not been published before in a critical edition. Eugnostos, The Blessed (abbreviated, £wg-III) is the third tractate of Nag Hammadi Codex III (70,1-90,13). The portions of the text and translation of Eug-YH that are variations of sections in The Sophia o f Jesus Christ were published in Till (1955) and Till-Schenke. However, non-parallel parts, including all the frame material, were omitted. The text and translation (modem Greek) of E ug-\\\\\\ was published by Trakatellis as part of his Har­ vard dissertation. His text was based on preliminary work of my own with 1The most authoritative account of the discovery and subsequent history of the codices is to be found in Robinson’s introduction to the facsimile edition (1984). 2See Bams: 9-18. But for cautions about Bams’s conclusions, see Shelton’s introduction to Bams et al. 3 For a brief account of the unsuccessful efforts of Schmidt to publish BG during his lifetime, see Till-Schenke: 1-2.\n\n2\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nsome modifications by George MacRae, who was the dissertation director (corrrespondence with MacRae). Translations of E ug-lll by Krause (1974: 27-34) and myself (NHLE 3 : 206-43) have been published. In both cases the portion of Eug-V covering the missing two pages of £Mg-III (79-80) was also published. The two versions of The Sophia o f Jesus Christ (hereafter, SJC) vary from each other in relatively minor ways. One version is the third tractate of BG (77,8-127,12), which was edited (text and German translation) by Till (1955). His edition was later revised by Schenke (Till-Schenke). Translated portions were also published by Puech (77,9-79,18; 124,9-126,16; 126,17-127,10) (1963: 246-47). The other version is the fourth tractate of NHC III (90,14-119,18). It was published by Till with the BG version, in the sense that places where it varied from the BG text were printed in the footnotes. Unfortunately, in many instances the Till edition (and its revision) did not completely reflect the vari­ ations, particularly the orthographic ones. Krause translated the portions of 5/C -III that vary from E ug-lll and published them in endnotes (1974: 35-39). A translation by myself of all of 5/C -III is published in NHLE3. In both cases, the parts of 5/C -B G covering the missing four pages of 5/C-III (109-10; 115-16) were also published. In addition to the two Coptic MSS of 5/C, one leaf of a Greek copy has survived among the Oxyrhynchus papyri. It is numbered 1081 and is presented here in a new edition, following the parallels. III. TITLES The title of E ug-lll in the incipit is eyrN ojcT oc ttm&k&pioc , “Eug­ nostos, the Blessed,” which agrees with the subscript title (90,12-13). But Eug-V has only faint traces of its subscript title and the incipit is very frag­ mentary. Enough of the latter is visible, however, to make clear that ttm&kapioc , “the Blessed,” was not part of the line. It is also evident that ttm&kapioc could not have been part of the subscript title (see V 17,18n.). But what of “Eugnostos”? It appears nowhere in the tractate. The correct number of spaces is available in the incipit. And the same is true of the sub­ script, where, in addition, the only visible letter (omicron) is in the correct position for the reconstruction of “Eugnostos.” But since other names would also be possible, the designation of “Eugnostos” as the title of the tractate depends on the recognition of the similarity of this tractate and Eug-lll. The titles of both copies of 5/C appear in superscriptions and subscripts. The superscriptions are the same in both, except that the spelling of the nomina sacra in BG (FcT and x c ) differs from that in Codex III (me and xpc). In 5/C-BG , the same title appears in the subscript, except that this time the nomina sacra are spelled as they are in the superscription of 5/C-III. The subscript of 5/C -III omits xpc', “Christ,” perhaps through scribal error (see m.A, below). In regard to the difference between the nomina sacra in the\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n3\n\nsuperscription and subscript of BG, it is noteworthy that while the former conform to the usage elsewhere in the codex (based on the Till-Schenke index), the latter are unique, suggesting a copyist’s adjustment. Till leaves coia. untranslated, on the ground that the word refers to the divine hypostasis who appears prominently in the tractate (1955: 55). Doresse (1948: 146) and Puech (1963: 245), however, prefer to translate it, on the ground that it refers to the teachings of Jesus found in the tractate. The latter view seems preferable because Sophia is not the dominant figure in the tractate, as one would expect if the tractate were titled after her. How­ ever, we have adopted Till’s practice because it seems to have become gen­ erally accepted. IV. THE R E L A T IO N SH IP OF THE TRACTATES AND ITS SIG N IF IC A N C E Because most of Eug is found in SJC, where it is attributed to Jesus, and because Eug seems to be without any obvious Christian elements, the ques­ tion of priority was raised very early. It was thought that if Eug were com­ posed first and had been used in the editing of SJC, then we would have a clear example of the movement from non-Christian Gnosticism to Christian Gnosticism. Doresse argued for the priority of Eug (1948: 137-60) and was followed by Puech (1963: 248). Till, however, took the opposite position (1955: 54), without arguing the point. Schenke joined him, after carefully examining and rejecting the arguments of Doresse (1962: 265-67). (Schenke has since changed his mind [personal conversation in November, 1982].) A more per­ suasive approach (than that of Doresse) in favor of the priority of Eug was taken by Krause (1964). He began by distinguishing between the material common to both Eug and SJC and the material each has separately, and argued that that tractate was primary in which the common material and its separate material were most compatible. Using this criterion he concluded that the material special to Eug fitted better with the common material than did that of SJC, and that Eug therefore preceded SJC. Although individual points of Krause’s argument are not convincing (Par­ rott, 1971: 399-404), his method has had a significant effect: since he wrote, no one has attempted to argue the priority of SJC. It appears that as scholars have examined the tractates for themselves, in the light of his approach, they have become convinced of the greater likelihood of the priority of Eug by observing the artificiality of the dialogue framework of SJC and the differ­ ences in vocabulary and ideas between the common material in SJC and its separate material (on the latter point, see Parrott, 1971: 405-06). The priority of Eug is now usually simply assumed (e.g., Perkins: 35). That conclusion would diminish in importance, however, if Eug could be shown to be Christian in some significant way. Schenke maintained that there were signs of Christian influence, without giving any specifics (1962:\n\n4\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n265). Wilson listed terminology that might be Christian (115), but admitted that it fell short of demonstrating Christian influence. I suggested that the so-called summary section of Eug-III (85,9ff) was deliberately edited in a Christian direction, but it is also possible that haplography occurred (1971: 412-13; 1975: 180-81), and in any case Eug-V lacks the changes. The one rather clear indication of Christian influence in E ug-\\\\\\ is found at the con­ clusion, where editing appears to have sharpened the reference to the one who is expected (90,7-11), so that it easily is seen to refer to Christ in the next tractate, which is SJC. Since that sharpening is not found in Eug-V, it is possible that Eug-III has been subject to some Christian modifications, but that does not alter the basic non-Christian character of the original form of Eug (similarly, Menard: 137). One should perhaps note here that the last sentence in Eug-V may be a direct quote from Mark 4:25 or one of its paral­ lels, but it could also have been drawn from the common treasury of secular proverbs assumed by Bultmann as the source for the passage in the gospels (102-04). There is another aspect of the relationship between these two tractates that needs to be discussed, namely, what appears to be their symbiosis. This is immediately suggested by their juxtaposition in Codex III. It is further sug­ gested by the above-mentioned ending of Eug, which in its clearest expres­ sion, in Codex III, looks forward to the coming of one who will not need to be taught but who will “speak all these things to you joyously and in pure knowledge” (90,7-11), clearly (in Codex III) pointing to Christ in SJC. What could be the reason for this juxtaposition and interconnection? When Doresse discussed SJC, he assumed the tractate was an attempt to make Christians think that Christ taught Gnosticism (so also Krause, 1964: 223) and suggested that the knowledge Christians had of the existence of Eug would have made clear to them that that was in fact a fraud (1960: 198). One suspects that problem would have been obvious to the Gnostics, which sug­ gests then that they had something else in mind for SJC, something which would have made the relating of these two tractates more than a mistake. An alternative would be that Christian Gnostics were interested in having those who knew and revered Eug come to know that Christ fulfilled the pro­ phecy of Eugnostos (probably initially known by them in its more ambiguous form found in Codex V). That would make it possible for them to accept Christ as the new revealer and recognize that he had triumphed over the sin­ ister powers, thereby opening the way for them to do so also. In other words, the intention may have been to convert non-Christian Gnostics to Christian Gnosticism. Supporting this is the allusive nature of the references to traditional gnos­ tic doctrines in the material added to Eug to produce SJC. The reader learns something, but not very much, about the ignorant and bad creator god (III 107,5-11), the sin of Sophia (III 114,14-18), the fall of the divine drops of light into the prison of this cosmic order (III 106,24-107,6, par.), the evil of sexuality (III 108,10-16, par.), and the punishment of the creator god and his\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n5\n\nminions (BG 121,13-122,5). In no case is one of these doctrines presented in a fully developed way. That suggests that the intended audience was made up of those who already knew those doctrines; that is, that the intended audi­ ence were Gnostics. The one doctrine that is fully developed is the doctrine of Christ. (For a similar argument and conclusion, see Perkins, 1980: 98; see also Perkins, 1971: 177.) Eug and SJC could both have a life of their own, as is demonstrated by Codex V, which has Eug but not S JC ; and BG, which has SJC but not Eug. But it is the symbiotic relationship as seen in Codex III that seems to reveal the reason for the creation of SJC. V. D ATING The dating of the composition of the tractates is difficult because no dateable events are referred to in them. Krause has suggested the first or second centuries C.E. for Eug without specifying the reasons (1974: 26). D. Trakatellis is more specific, suggesting the beginning of the second cen­ tury C.E., because he thinks that Eug belongs early in the period in which the leading figures of Gnosticism made their appearance (32). However, those figures produced systems with clear Christian elements, whereas Eug has none. A date no later than the first century C.E. seems justified. An even ear­ lier date is likely. Eug is directed against the views of “all the philosophers” (III 70,15). From the brief descriptions of these views, the philosophers can be identified as Stoic, Epicurean, and the theoreticians of Babylonian astrol­ ogy. The latest time when these could be thought of as “all the philosophers” was probably the first century B.C.E. (Parrott, 1988). As to the date of SJC, Puech has dated P. Oxy. 1081 early in the fourth century, thus providing a terminus ad quem (1950: 98 n. 2; 1963: 245). He also suggests that SJC might have been composed in the second half of the second century, or at the latest, the third century, but gives no reason (1963: 248). Till suggests a relative dating between Ap. John (NHC 11,7; 111,7; IV, 7 ; BG 7) and Pist. Soph. Assuming that SJC is an integrated whole, he argues that in it the understandable philosophical viewpoint found in Ap. John and its consistent development are diminished, while SJC seems to represent an early state in the development of a Weltbild that ends in Pist. Soph. (Till-Schenke: 56). Doresse puts SJC close to the first books of Pist. Soph. (1948: 159). In contrast to these rather late datings, there are certain crucial elements that taken together suggest an early date. The likelihood that SJC was pro­ duced to persuade non-Christian Gnostics to accept Christian Gnosticism has already been mentioned. That suggests an early date, especially in view of the fact that it seems to be assumed that the intended audience knows little or nothing about Christ, although one cannot deny the possibility of a continu­ ing body of non-Christian Gnostics to whom Christian Gnostics might have wanted to appeal.\n\n6\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nFurther, there is the absence of polemics connected with the gnosticorthodox struggle. This is seen rather dramatically when the frame material of SJC is compared with that of Ap. John. In Ap. John, both the beginning and the ending contain elements that seem to refer to the conflict. John is depicted as a traditional Jewish Christian (going to the temple) at the start, who is confronted with charges against Christ by the Pharisee Arimanius. He is unable to answer them and so turns away from the temple and goes to the desert (II 1,5-19). John, then, is seen as moving from the inadequate ortho­ dox way (based on Jewish tradition) to the gnostic way. At the end of Ap. John, we sense the defensive posture of a group that anticipates attack in the instructions from Christ that the words of the revela­ tion are to be given only to John’s fellow spirits (“for this is the mystery of the immoveable race”), that John is to write down and keep secure what he has heard, and in the curse that follows against anyone who might sell what is written (probably to opponents) (II 31,28-37). There is none of that in SJC. In the beginning the disciples are perplexed (no reason is given) and go to the place where they have reason to think they will receive answers from the risen savior. And in the end, they are simply told to continue the savior's mission, which, according to the account, they begin to do by preaching the Gospel (i.e., what they have just heard). Another reason for assigning an early date is the fact that SJC contains nothing that would clearly indicate that it had been influenced by the great systems of the middle third of the second century. There are numerous points of contact, of course, but nothing that demonstrates dependence. Finally, when one examines the attempt in SJC to integrate the person of Christ into the system of Eug, it is clear that problems remain: Christ is identified with Son of Man, but not with Savior; but a major section on the work of Christ (III 106,24-108,16, par.) is placed immediately after the sec­ tion on the appearing of Savior, who is the son of Son of Man (III 106,15-24), which would lead one to think that a second identification of Christ— this time, with Savior— was being made. Perhaps in an attempt to resolve this confusion, the bridge section, which provides a summary of sorts, in SJC identifies Savior with Son of Man and ignores the son of Son of Man (BG 108,1-7) (although he is mentioned in the Eug-V parallel). All this suggests that in SJC we are at the beginning of the process by which Christian Gnosticism was to become rationalized or theologized. Taken together, then, these points tend to the conclusion that SJC should be dated early. If Eug is dated in the first-century B.C.E., then SJC should probably be dated late in the first or early in the second century. VI. O R IG IN A L LA N G U A G E Prior to the identification by Puech of P. Oxy. 1081 as a leaf from a Greek copy of SJC (1950: 98, n. 2), Doresse asserted that SJC was composed origi­\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n7\n\nnally in Coptic (1948: 152). But once the identification was made, a Coptic original became improbable. And given a Greek original of SJC, a Greek original of Eug is very likely. Further confirmation of this is provided by the presence in Eng-III of an untranslated conjugated Greek verb (75,8); evi­ dently it was unfamiliar to the scribe-translator, so he left it as it was. VII. PRO V EN A N C E Trakatellis holds that nothing can be concluded about the provenance of Eug. The fact that the scribe of Gos. Eg. has the name Eugnostos as his spirir tual name, and could therefore be the same person as the writer of Eug (on the unlikelihood of which, see the next section), might suggest Egypt. But Trakatellis argues (following Bohlig-Wisse) that one cannot be certain that Gos. Eg. was in fact directed to the Egyptians (32). There is, however, another element in Eug that suggests Egypt, namely, the reference to “the three hundred sixty days of the year” (III 84,4-5). In Eug the number of days of the year is thought of as existing because it is a reflection (“type”) of the 360 supercelestial powers. Hence it is part of the necessary ordering of things. From ancient times the Egyptians had calcu­ lated the year as having 360 days, divided into twelve months of thirty days each, plus five epagomenal days (Bickerman: 42). Furthermore, when the Romans conquered Egypt they left the 360 day period intact, decreeing only that every four years another day should be added to the epagomenal days (Decree of Augustus, 26 B.C. [Bickerman: 49]), thus bringing the Egyptian year into line with the Julian year, which was standard elsewhere in the Roman Empire. Przybylski has suggested several possible sources other than Egypt for the 360 day reference (1 Enoch, Jubilees, a purely theoretical rather than a prac­ tical calendar, ancient Babylon) (60-62), but it seems unlikely that any of them would have been the source without some word of explanation to the reader. It was only in Egypt where such a reference would have been taken for granted.4 A further reason for believing in an Egyptian provenance is found in the discussion of sources in Section IX. If Eug had an Egyptian provenance, it is reasonable to think that SJC had one also.\n\n4 As noted, 360 days did not constitute the whole year for the Egyptians. But the references in Eug-IH and Eug-V do not claim that, and indeed Eug-lU seems to suggest that it is only a part of the year, with its strange word order and odd (for the context) preposition: no)MT{T}ojece n t n TepoM® n z o o y , lit., “The three hundred sixty from the year days” (84,4-5). It should be noted that the Valentinians also assumed a 360 day period (Iren., Haer. 2.15.1, and Val.Exp. [XI,2] 30,34-38).\n\n8\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nVIII. W RITERS AND A U D IEN C ES Eug The name Eugnostos is not widely attested, but there is one reference to it (Pape and Bensler: s.v.; contra Bellet [47]). From the tractate there is no rea­ son to think that it is anything other than a proper noun (derived from an adjective). It may be a spiritual name here (in contrast to a birth name), since Eugnostos is the spiritual name of the scribe of the colophon of Gos. Eg. (Ill 69,10-11). Or, if we can assume that the non-Christian Eug was earlier than the colophon of the Christianized Gos. Eg., it may be that the name became spiritual within a gnostic community because it was the name of the revered writer of our tractate. Bellet’s conjecture that Eugnostos is the title of an official in a gnostic circle requires for credibility an unlikely transposition, since the title should be in second position in relation to the name of the per­ son possessing the title. Such a transposition has not been found in other sources, as Bellet himself admits (47 and 55-56). The designation ttm akapioc , “the Blessed,” which appears only in £«£-III, would probably not have been applied by the writer to himself, since it is honorific, and should therefore be considered secondary. It may have been inserted to indicate that Eugnostos was dead. Such usage was not lim­ ited to Christian communities, contrary to Bellet (55) (see TDNT 4:362 [Hauck] and LSJ: s.v.). The writer of Eug may have been a teacher of some significance, since his writing is preserved in two quite different versions, testifying to long usage. In view of the fact that the compiler of Codex III placed Gos. Eg. and Eug side-by-side, he may have identified Eugnostos with the scribe of the colo­ phon of Gos. Eg. If that was the case, it seems unlikely that he was correct (contra Doresse, 1948: 159; 1960: 196), in view of the probability that Eug was considerably earlier than Gos. Eg. Eug is ostensively addressed to “those who are his” (ID 70,1-2). “His” may refer to Eugnostos himself, in which case the audience would be his dis­ ciples. But one gains the impression from the tractate that the audience may not be familiar with some of Eugnostos’ teachings (see, e.g., Ill 74,12-14). If that is the case, “his” could refer to a deity to whom the audience is thought to belong. “Sons of Unbegotten Father” are mentioned in III 75,22. SJC The author of SJC wants it to appear that he is a disciple (III 91,12-19, par.).5 However in point of fact we have no knowledge of who the author is. 5In Pist. Soph., Philip, Matthew and Thomas, all of whom are named in SJC (along with Bartholew and Mary), are designated as “those who are to write everything that Jesus says” (71,18-72,1; 72,11-20).\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n9\n\nIt seems clear, however, who the audience is. It is made up of those who, like the disciples in SJC, seek answers to basic questions about the meaning and purpose of the whole cosmic system, and about their place in it. As men­ tioned above, they are probably non-Christian Gnostics who are being encouraged by the writer to adopt Christianized Gnosticism. IX. SOU RCES OF EU G N O STO S It may be that Eug originally existed without the letter format, as a cosmo­ gonic text, as Krause has suggested (1964: 222). The minor items that make it a letter could easily have been added, but there is no way to be certain (see XVII below). There is evidence, however, that Eug, as we have received it, in both its versions, is the result of major earlier editorial activity. That can be seen in two places: in the first major portion of Eug (III 70,1-85,9, par.) (Part A), where two originally separate speculative patterns seem to have been com­ bined; and in the second major part (III 85,9-90,3, par.) (Part B) where evi­ dence is found that it may originally have been an independent unit. A. Two Speculative Patterns in Part A The two patterns emerge when a comparison is made of the first group of major deities and the second, the latter of which is described as “the type of those who preceded them” (HI 82,10-11, a phrase omitted in Eug-V\\), that is, the type of the first group. The following chart shows the comparison: First Group (III 71,13-82,6, par.) Second Group (III 82,7-83,2, par.) (Variant terms found in only one text are indicated.) 1) He Who Is; Unbegotten; Father of the Universe; Forefather; First Existent (HI) (III 71,13-75,2,3)\n\n1) Unbegotten (III); Unbegotten All things (V). Cowso rt: All-Wise Sophia.\n\n2) Self-Father; Self-Begetter; Con- 2) Self-begotten. Consort: Allfronter (III); Self-grown, Self- Mother Sophia (III), constructed Father (III); He who Put Forth Himself (V) (III 75,3-11; 76,14-17) 3) Man (V); Immortal Man; 3) Begetter (IH); Begotten (V). Immortal Androgynous Man (III); Consort: All-Begettress Sophia Self-perfected Begetter (V); (III). Begetter Mind who Perfects Him­ self (V); Begotten; Perfect Mind (HI); Father; Self-Father Man; Man of the Depth (V); First Man (III).\n\n10\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nConsort'. All-wise Begettress Sophia; Thought, She of All Wis­ doms, Begettress of the Wisdoms (V); Truth (V); Great Sophia (V). (Ill 76,19-V 8,32) 4) First-begotten Son of God (V); First Begetter Father (III); Adam of the Light (III); son of Man. Con­ sort : First-begotten Sophia, Mother of the Universe; Love. (V 8,33-111 81,21)\n\n4) First Begetter (III); Begotten of the First (V). Consort: First Beget­ tress Sophia (III).\n\n5) Savior, Begetter of All Things; All-Begetter (84,13) Son of Son of Man (V 13,12-13). Consort: Sophia, All-Begettress (III); Pistis Sophia (III 81,21-82,6)\n\n5) All-Begetter (III); All-begotten (V). Consort: Love Sophia.\n\n6) Arch-Begetter (III) (V, in la­ cuna). Consort: Pistis Sophia. The most obvious and significant thing to observe is that the second group has one more deity than the first. It is also notable that the name of the con­ sort of the fifth deity in the second group, namely, Love, is one of the names of the consort of the fourth being in the first group. Also, the name Pistis Sophia, which belongs to the consort of the sixth deity in the second group, is one of the names of the consort of the fifth deity in the first group. Notable also is the fact that the second group lacks the terms Man, Son of Man, Son of Son of Man, and Savior. Contrary to III 82,10-11, then, the second group is not now the type of those who preceded them in any complete sense. If we ask which list is primary, the answer seems to be the second, since the number six is important subsequently in the tractate (see discussion below), whereas the number five is not. If we assume that III 82,10-11 originally was correct, the first group once had six members; now it lacks Arch-Begetter. The reason for the dropping of the antetype of Arch-Begetter seems to be that another pattern was superimposed on the first group, the pattern of Immortal Man, Son of Man, and son of Son of Man—Savior. This pattern had no figure to identify with the antetype of Arch-Begetter.6\n\n6The name Arch-Begetter (by some translators, simply transliterated as Archigenetor) does not appear in Eug after IE 82,18; however, it does appear in SJC, in a non-Eug section, where it is identified with Yaldabaoth, the ignorant and malevolent creator god (BG 119,14-16).\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n11\n\nThe original form of the first group, then, would have resembled that of the second, except raised to a higher level of perfection. Thus, Unbegotten Father in the second group has a consort, while Unbegotten in the first is sim­ ply one. Moreover, Unbegotten in the second group is merely father of the multiplicities (“all things”), while Unbegotten in the first group is Father of the Universe. Therefore the first group would originally have looked some­ thing like the following: 1) He Who Is; Unbegotten; Father of the Universe; Forefather; First Existent. 2) Self-Father; Self-Begetter; Confronter; Self-grown, Self-constructed Father. 3) Begotten; Self-perfected Begetter; Perfect Mind; Begetter Mind who Perfects Himself (V). Consort: All-wise Begettress Sophia; Thought, She of All Wisdoms, Begettress of the Wisdoms; Truth; Great Sophia. 4) First-begotten; First Begetter Father. Consort : First-begotten Sophia, Mother of the Universe. 5) Begetter of All Things; All-Begetter. Consort: Love Sophia. 6) Arch-Begetter. Consort: Pistis Sophia. The pattern here is one that is found in Egyptian religion: An initial allencompassing divinity (Amun, in Egyptian thought), creates a separate divin­ ity by himself (i.e., no consort is involved). This divinity is then responsible for the creation of four other divinities, each of whom have a single female consort, thus making a total of eight (in Egyptian thought, the Eight Urgdtter of Hermopolis). These, in turn, are responsible for the creation of various heavenly realms and other divine beings, leading ultimately to the structures of this world (in Egyptian thought, they create the gods who bring structure to the cosmos). This pattern can be traced to the Theban theology of the Ramesside period and (judging from Eug) became more abstract and hence more universal by the end of the Ptolemaic period. Since the pattern was not found elsewhere in the period under study, it seems reasonable to think that Egyptian religion is its source (Parrott, 1987: 82-88). The pattern imposed on this reconstructed original pattern, namely, the pattern of three androgynous men, Immortal man, Son of Man, and Savior, appears to be the result of speculation on the first five chapters of Genesis. An important clue to that is the identification of Son of Man with Adam. He is not earthly Adam, of course, but his antetype, Adam of the Light (III 81,12), who exists in the transcendent realm. Another clue is the identification of Son of Man as also “Son of God” (V 9,2-3). The idea that Adam was androgynous comes from Gen 1:27 and 5:1, where it is said that God created Adam male and female. He also created him in his own image, which can be taken to mean that God himself is man and that he too is androgynous. Hence, if antetype Adam is Son of Man, antetype God is Immortal Man, Adam’s father. Son of son of Man-Savior\n\n12\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nshould then in all probability be identified with the antetype of Seth, since only of Seth is it said that he was begotten in Adam’s image (Gen 5:3) (and hence was androgynous). The three man pattern appears to presuppose a myth like that found in Apoc. Mos., where God is the benign ruler and Seth is the eschatological savior of Adam’s progeny (13.1-3). One can speculate that the reason for combining this pattern with the Egyptian one was that those who thought of Seth as a savior felt the need to give their beliefs the support of a broader theological-philosophical context. The beginning of Eug makes clear that the writer, at any rate, felt that he was having to deal with a spiritual threat from various philosophical teachings— teachings that presupposed either that there was no transcendent world (Stoicism and astrology) or, if there were, that there was no connection between that world and this one (Epicureanism) (Parrott, 1988: 166-67). The two patterns were combined by the simple expedient of adding the names of the second pattern at appropriate places. This is the same method used in SJC, where, in the Christianization process, Christ is identified with Son of Man. Probably the same thing has occurred in such tractates as Ap. John and Gos. Eg. (see Krause, 1964: 223; Hedrick, 1981). Since the names of the consorts are present in the second group, which was not affected by this combining, it seems likely that the three-man pattern lacked such names, and was simply identified as androgynous. As we have noted, because there was no fourth man, the antetype of Arch-Begetter (in the second group) was dropped. But instead of merely dropping his consort Pistis Sophia, the editor identified her with the consort of the preceding figure, which led, then, to the shifting of the name “Love” from that figure to the next preceding one. These names must have had some importance in the conceptuality of the edi­ tor, but what it might have been at the early date of Eug is not clear. Part A then permits us to see the combining of a universalized Egyptian cosmological system and a speculative system based on Genesis. To the extent that these or similar elements are present in combined and elaborated form in later tractates, such as Ap. John and Gos. Eg., we are probably justified in thinking of Eug as the source. B. An Originally Independent Second Part: Part B (III 85,9-90,3, par.) The originally independent character of Part B is suggested by the fact that it is at odds in a number of important ways with the earlier part of the tractate. The following analysis will show the points of conflict. Part B is introduced by a bridge section, whose purpose is to relate it to the foregoing. In particular, the intention is to relate the number of aeons in Part B to those in Part A and to suggest that the aeons to be described are the types of the preceding ones. It is here that the problems begin.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n13\n\nThe earliest version of the bridge section is undoubtedly in E ug-V (13,8-20), as Krause observed (1964: 221), which states that three aeons pre­ ceded (the same number as in Part B), with another aeon (that of Unbegotten, presumably) embracing them. The three are the aeons of Immortal Man, Son of Man, and Son of Son of Man. Left out of account, however, are SelfBegetter (the reflection of Unbegotten) and the twelve aeons created by AllBegetter for the twelve angels (III 84,13-17, par.). To be sure, no aeon is mentioned as having been created for Self-Begetter in Part A, but neither is one mentioned for son of Son of Man. So the three aeons of the bridge sec­ tion (in Eug-V) do not accurately reflect the preceding material. It appears that they were designed to meet the need created by the presence of three aeons in Part B, in the light of what might be called the typological dogma. What is described subsequently is called “the Eighth that appeared in Chaos” (III 85,19-21, par.). “Eighth” is probably to be thought of as the highest sphere of the visible cosmos (Chaos), perhaps the sphere of the fixed stars (the seven planets—including the sun and moon—each having their own spheres below it; for the fixed stars, see the description of the “multitu­ dinous lights” in III 86,6-8). However, one cannot rule out the possibility, in view of the discussion below, that “Eighth” refers to the eighth day of crea­ tion. The creation described in Part B is said to be the work of Immortal Man, even though his work seemed to have been concluded in Part A (V 8,15-18). The whole section appears to be based on Genesis 1-5, as was the case with the three-man pattern earlier. The clue to the Genesis connection is in the discussion of the androgyne “Assembly” (€ k k a h c ia ), which begins in III 86,24, par. Its female portion is called “Life” (zojh), and it is explained that in this way (by giving her this name) “it might be shown that from a female came the life in all the aeons” (III 87,5-8, par.). That is closely parallel to the LXX version of Gen 3:20, where the woman is given the name Zan\\ rather than Eve, and where it is explained that she has that name “because she is the mother of all living things” (oxt a w r | |J.TiTr|p ndvtcov t at 17,7. b. Use of a dot (“stop”) to set off an attributive from the noun it depends on (5,4; 7,10; 17,14), perhaps as a way of rendering a Greek attributive adjective in the second position (note that the parallels for 5,4 and 17,14 have relative clauses in place of the attributives). c. Use of low dots as word separators in 8,7.16; 12,10 (see also 34,10). d. In 7,25 a dot may replace a sentence pronoun. e. Numeral written at end of 11,20 (a gloss, similar to those later in the codex [Parrott, 1979: 5]), with a stroke above. f. Instead of using a second present with a noun and an adverbial expres­ sion, the scribe in one instance uses a sentence pronoun and puts the adverbial expression in first position (11,14). Also sentence pronouns are used as shorthand for cyume e - in 7,24—29 and for u) aymoyt 6 epooY x e in 11,18-20 (cf. Ill 106,22). g. x is mistakenly written for x in 6,29; 7,20-22.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n21\n\nEug-lll and SJC -lll The scribe of Codex III is much more error prone than his counterpart in Codex V. 1. Errors corrected by the scribe. a. Haplography, corrected by letters written above the line at the place of omission: 72,14; 91,11; 95,2; 105,8; 113,11. b. Replacement of erased or partially erased letters by letters written on top of them: 70,2; 71,21; 72,8.21; 73,12.19.22; 77,16; 84,3; 85,9.16; 87,10; 89,10.12; 91,2; 94,15.20; 96,15 (correction of dittography); 97,11; 100,21; 102,7; 106,13; 107,1.6; 113,11; 118,2.5.6; 119,7. c. Erasure of unnecessary letters, etc.: 81,11 (erased point); 85,8; 87,22; 92,24 (erased dot); 95,24; 96,14 (erased stroke). d. Replacement of marked out letters by letters written above them: 72,12; 95,6 (marking out omitted); 97,18; 113,8. In all of these a change of meaning occurs. e. Marking out of unnecessary letters: 72,12; 89,10; 95,6; 106,19 (dialec­ tal change); 113,8. f. Re-forming of a letter to make another without erasure: 73,4. It is possible that a second scribe made some of these corrections. The letters written by the corrector under “d” seem somewhat different from letters in the rest of the tractate, but the differences are not sufficient to make a determination of a second scribe certain (see Bohlig-Wisse for a similar judgment regarding 111,2 [4]; Wisse expresses more assurance about there being only one scribe in his later essay [1975: 236]). 2. Errors not corrected by the scribe. a. Haplography: 71,5; 73,10.14; 76,14; 83,5; 86,3.4.10.14.17; 89,10; 94,13(7); 95,22; 96,2.23; 97,7.17; 98,24.25; 99,8; 102,9; 103,6.10.23; 104,1; 107,7.8.21; 111,18.20; 113,7. b. Unnecessary letters: 74,10; 76,5 (dittography); 77,7; 84,5 (dittography).16; 85,4; 86,17; 95,6; 97,3 (dittography). 18; 99,11; 113,8; 118,1 (dittography). c. Incorrect letters: 78,22-23 (reversal of letters); 82,2; 83,13.14; 84,13; 86,7; 87,23; 89,2; 91,15; 93,22; 101,20; 105,22; 106,14; 107,11; 113,1. d. Corruptions: 86,17; 99,8-9.19-22; 112,7-11. 3. Other Peculiarities. a. In 99,8-9 a Greek phrase is partially, and incorrectly, translated. It is left untranslated or rendered correctly in the parallels. b. The status pronominalis of c o j t m is always spelled c o t m c #. c. The lack of care of the scribe is further attested by random drops of ink that appear here and there; e.g., at 92,1.10.14; 94,12-13; 100,8. d. A sentence pronoun is used as shorthand for qjayMOYTe e p o c x e in 106,22 (cf.V 11,18-20).\n\n22\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nSJC-BG 1. Errors corrected by the scribe. a. Haplography, corrected by letters written above the line at the place of omission: 84,1; 89,14; 92,2; 102,15; 112,16; 127,8. b. Replacement of erased letters by letters written on top of them: 92,18; 116,18. c. Erasure of unnecessary letters: 93,13; 108,15; 109,12; 116,17. d. Marking out of unnecessary letters: 78,10. 2. Errors not corrected by the scribe a. Haplogrpahy: 84,3.12; 86,11; 89,17; 91,16; 93,10; 95,10; 98,6; 101,12.18; 102,9; 110,4.5.11; 111,3.7; 112,7.10.12.16; 113,16; 114,7; 116,5; 118,15; 119,2; 123,9; 125,8 (misplacement). b. Unnecessary letters: 91,1; 95,10; 102,18; 105,7; 108,16; 110,12; 112,12; 115,16; 120,16; 124,15. c. Incorrect letters: 84,12; 87,5; 90,16; 92,11-12; 95,1.6; 99,4; 102,11; 103,15-16; 104,11; 105,8; 107,13; 109,15; 110,10; 112,14.16; 113,1.4.7 (mistranslation of Greek); 115,17; 119,11; 120,15; 121,4; 125,9-10 (misplacement). Of the above, the following may be errors of hearing: 84,12; 87,5; 105,8. d. Corruptions: 87,5; 103,15-16; 105,8; 116,8-9. 3. Other peculiarities a. Strokes are used instead of diereses over the diphthong ai in 104,11; 115,11; 123,16 (for the use of the dieresis, see 97,9). b. Ae appears three times in the phrase cboa ac zn , when cboa is not in first position in the sentence, in 111,3-4; 112,10; 126,2. It may be that Ae simply provides a mild emphasis in these instances. c. Plene writing occurs in 83,7-8 (eMneapxH and e M n e e a o y c ia .) and 122,15 (qjopen). d. x is used for x in 112,15.17. e. Asterisks and diples in the body of the text highlight certain questions and answers (see detailed description below under Transcriptions). B. Dialectal Influences Eug-V Although the dialect is basically S, there are numerous signs of other dialects, as is the case in the rest of the codex (Bdhlig-Labib: 11-14): 1. The regular use of the demonstrative t t h , t h , n h with the relative, as in B and F. 2. The regular use of ctas* for the first perfect relative and the second perfect, as in BA FtA J (for second perfect: 12,6; 14, 18). 3. The frequent irregular (from the point of view of S) use of ntc in the genitive construction.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n23\n\n4. The occasional appearance of the pronominal form n t c #, as in A- (e.g. 3,8.15). 5. The consistent use of e as the qualitative of eipe , as in A and F. 6. The use of M iz-, as in A, A2, and B, for the prefix for ordinal numbers (13,9.12), although Mez- (S) occurs also (10,19). 7. The single appearance of e \\ e - , as in F, instead of e p e- (7,18). 8. The single appearance of the F form of the sign of the future (Ne*) (17,16). 9. The BAF form of the second perfect used as a temporal, apractice fre­ quent in B and F (6,21; 10,13; 11,22; 14,18). 10. The AA2 form of the negative third future (16,4). 11. The AA2 form of the negative consuetudinis (2,17),although the S form also occurs. 12. p regularly precedes Greek verbs as in A and A2 (but this occurs in early S MSS also—Crum: 84a). 13. The following non-standard (for S) orthography: a. mm€ as in A and A2 (4,25); b. N i6 as in A, A2 and F (6,22.25; 9,10); c. sa.M as in A, A2 and F (6,10; 7,29; 12,27); d. x a e i c as in A, A2 and F (6,30). I have not mentioned ni -. f - , ni - in the above. This form of the article is identified by Till as most characteristic of B and F (1961: sec. 64), but Krause subsequently noted that at least the plural is quite characteristic of early upper-Egyptian dialects as well (Krause-Labib: 29). In Codex V these forms are found intermingled with n-, t -, n -, without discernible difference in emphasis to a modem reader. Nor is it possible to see that one form of the article is preferred to the other with certain words. As mentioned, these characteristics are essentially the same as in the rest of Codex V. Bohlig-Labib accounts for them by positing a Middle Egyptian (presumably, F) translator who intended to render the original into S but occasionally reverted to his native dialect (12). Schenke disagrees, seeing a pre-classical S dialect with A2 features and only occasional signs of F (1966: col. 24). For Eug-V, Schenke is correct regarding the small number of items that occur only in Middle Egyptian (7. and 8. above). But his characteriza­ tion of the dialect as pre-classical S makes it hard to understand the variations that go beyond spelling differences, since even the pre-classical stages of a language would need to have the internal consistency necessary for satisfac­ tory communication. It is perhaps better to think of those differences as having appeared in the course of transmission as scribes from different regions adjusted the text in an ad hoc fashion (see Bohlig-Wisse, for a simi­ lar explanation as applied to Codex III [11-12]).\n\n24\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nEug-III and SJC-III The dialect employed is S with no significant indications of other influences. Occasionally one finds orthography more familiar in other dialects according to Crum (e.g. anhzc [A A2] for eNez ; eMAZTe [A2] for a.Ma.zTe and Meoye [A] for Meeye, all of which are found along with standard S spelling). But these are also found in S texts that have become available since Crum (see Kasser) and therefore are best accounted for as reflecting an earlier non-standardized state of S spelling rather than A or A2 influences, as proposed by Till-Schenke (21) (Bohlig-Wisse has made an observation similar to the one adopted here on the orthography of 111,2 [6-7]). SJC-BG The dialect is basically S with some features that are similar to other dialects, especially A2. Those features are not sufficient to make one think that we are dealing with a mixed dialect. Till-Schenke agrees with this and thinks that the translator intended to translate into pure S, that some forms were in doubt, and that in those cases he would sometimes revert to his native (non-S) dialect (21). Although all the orthographic forms referred to by Till-Schenke (18-20) are also found in S texts, the other features are not (the irregular use of the preposition n t c - , and the doubling of the n before an ini­ tial vowel), and therefore support Till-Schenke’s view. The fact of the widespread nature of these peculiarities in the tractate makes Till-Schenke’s explanation preferable here to the one proposed above for Eug-V. It should be noted here that the use of n i -, f-, n i - is frequent in BG. This form of the article is preferred with words beginning with a . Mostly its use adds nothing discernible to the emphasis of the word to which it is attached beyond an ordinary article. When demonstrative force is desired, ctmmay is normally added (105,7; 111,4; 119,12-13; 120,11-12; 121,5.8). In at least one instance, however, this form of the article (without eTMMay) does have demonstrative force: 96,6. C. Scribal Style 1. Script In Codex V, the script is small and ligature occurs frequently where the line of one letter can naturally be extended to meet another, often without regard to word separation. The letters m, y and qj regularly lean to the left, giving many lines the appearance of a bias in that direction. The scribe often ends a long vertical stroke (as with a p, t , q and t ) with a slight curve to the left, showing a certain flair. The scribe also varies the width of his strokes (e.g., the middle horizontal stroke of the e is thinner than the rest of the letter). He enlarges the x when it comes at the beginning of a line. Often y,\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n25\n\nwhen it appears at the end of a line (and sometimes elsewhere too), will have a non-cursive form (like a printed “y”). Codex III has a larger script than Codex V. Ligature often occurs where lines can be naturally extended, but there is less here than in Codex V. The scribe’s strokes are uniformly thin in width with little interest shown in decorative accents. Letter size tends to be uniform throughout. No letters regularly lean, which gives a sense of verticality to the whole. Altogether, the impression is of ascetic spareness. In BG, the script is bold and square in character, with strokes that tend to be heavier than in Codex IH, but that vary in width, as in Codex V. Ligature occurs often within words. Letter size tends to be uniform, although some­ times letters become smaller toward the end of a line, as a result (apparently) of an attempt to stay within a margin (unmarked). It should be noted that an unusually large M ecece^N e t c s e M Moq e e i\n\nn e T e o y N u j| s o m\n\ne z o y N M n|boa.
