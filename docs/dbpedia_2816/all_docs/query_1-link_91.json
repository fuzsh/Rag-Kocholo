During the last dozen years many of the Foundation's grantees and visiting scholars have confronted us with questions varying from what are the collections of a museum in Hanoi to how accessible is the library of the Minzokugaku Kenkyujo in Tokyo? Field- bound anthropologists wanted to know if there were local scientific societies in the country of their interest, where they might attend discussion conferences and just when such meetings might be held. Other more technically minded investigators wished information on laboratory facilities in universities and museums, and frequent were the questions as to the rank and status of a Dozent in Vienna or a fil. kand. in Uppsala. Students corresponded with us, inquiring which educational institution would be the most suitable for study of a certain regional or cultural specialty, and where it was located. They, of course, also wished information on entrance requirements, tuition fees, existing scholarships, language of instruction, and so on. IMany hundreds of man-hours were spent by Foundation staff members in locating and supplying such information. Sizeable sums were spent for corre- spondence, telephone calls, and cables, and charged to administrative expenses. Our file dealing with such information grew to ever larger proportions, and it became evident that an organized effort might well be made to systematize and correlate our data and possibly make it available for the profession by publishing a sort of handbook on world-wide facilities for the anthropologist. When the Wenner-Gren Foundation International Symposium on Anthropology was being organized, we inquired if the Planning Committee thought it an auspicious time to realize such a dream through the collaboration of the many anthropologists who came to the Symposium from all corners of the world. Professor A. L. Kroeber, President of the Symposium, and the members of the Planning Committee encouraged the idea, and the Foimdation's Board of Directors generously allocated the finances for the project. While it was recognized that there were already m existence standard reference volumes such as World of Learning, Yearbook of International Organizations, and Universities of the World Outside U.S.A., it was hoped that a volume embodying a specific orientation toward the fulfillment of the expressed felt-needs of the members of a single scientific disciphne would be of value. Therein lies the uniqueness of this under- taking, which, perhaps, in a larger sense, may serve as a model for similar volumes treatmg other fields of learning. Anthropologists, native of, or specializing in, various geographic areas, were Invited to participate as editors, but the heavy responsibility of collation and organization of the voluminous data was placed on the shoulders of William L. Thomas, Jr., the Foundation's Assistant Director of Research, and the Sym- posium's Editorial Assistant, Miss Anna M. Pikelis. To them, and to the thirty contributing editors, I wish to express grateful thanks in the name of the Foun- dation. The casual reader of this volume can scarcely realize the extent of their labors. Paul Fejos Director of Research. New York City March, 1953 IX EDITORS' PREFACE The International Directory of Anthropological Institutions is a handbook of world resources for research and education in anthropology, conceived as a stock- taking supplementary to that inventory of the achievements of anthropological science, since published as Anthropology Today, which formed the basis for dis- cussion at the Wenner-Gren Foundation International Symposium on Anthro- pology held in New York City during June, 1952. In December, 195 1, invitations to act as contributing editors were extended to twenty-seven scholars, selected for their reputations for familiarity with anthropological institutions in given areas of the world, and upon their acceptances, the Foundation gratefully transferred the burden of responsibility to them and resumed its customary function of standing ready to assist in any way possible. This \"stocktaking\" is confined to institutions of interest largely to persons engaged in the pursuit of anthropology on an academic and research level equiva- lent to one at, and above, that of a senior college in the United States of America. Havmg thus been designed primarily for the use of teachers, researchers, and students contemplating study abroad, data on governmental agencies which hire persons to carry out anthropological projects, properly subject matter for a directory of employment possibilities, are generally absent. From the outset primary emphasis has been placed on a description of the organization and operation of all institutions with interest in anthropology, broadly defined to include archeology, prehistory, folklore, linguistics, physical anthro- pology, ethnography, ethnology, social anthropology, cultural anthropology, and such other fields as the institutions themselves consider to be anthropologically oriented. Data on personnel were considered secondary, and the reasoning behind this emphasis is substantiated by recognition that, in some cases, such data are already obsolete by virtue of having been compiled during 1952. The several introductory sections highlight for the reader significant facts and trends, often colored by the priceless shadings possible only through firsthand experience, and serve to make for ready comparison, with regard to the development, function, and present status of anthropology, between one part of the world and another. The arrangement of entries within chapters is not consistent, some contributing editors having chosen to create a pattern of descending order of importance, some having employed an alphabetical sequence; mechanism for ready reference is, however, available in the form of alphabetical indexes. The world-wide scope of this undertaking has consistently proved a pivotal problem point, from the devising of questionnaires flexible enough to fit every case (see Appendix), through the byways of uncertain or nonexistent mail service in disturbed areas of the world, to the attempt at giving final manuscript the maximum unity consonant with nondistortion of substantive matter. Infor- mation submitted to contributing editors varied from case to case in terms of extent of detail, languages employed, and even nature of content â resulting from inter- pretation of the questionnaires in light of local peculiarities. Problems of stand- ardization often funneled down to the editors, who have, in the last analysis, treated each chapter as a unit unto itself, in the recognition that attempting to fit a square peg in a round hole would operate both to destroy clarity and to glorify, out of proportion, their function. The editors have, however, been obliged to take certain liberties with manuscript, under the necessity of condensing it to manageable proportions. The result is an abbreviated format, some aspects of which require explanation, which is to be found in the Appendix. xi xii Editors' Preface It goes without saying that the human factor is of extreme importance in a work of this kind, and it should be made clear at the outset that the bulk of institutions not detailed in the following pages are omitted or touched on only lightly not because of ignorance as to their existence or importance but because data simply were not forthcoming even after as many as three requests. By the same token, that information which does appear is due to the generous response and kind cooperation of thousands of officials of institutions throughout the world, to whom the editors take this opportunity to express, on behalf of the compiling editors, their very grateful appreciation. The organization of the volume according to geographical regions and categories of institutions, the devising of the questionnaires utilized for soliciting information, the contributing of the chapter on international institutions, the supervision of the compilation of the indexes, and the editing of the chapters concerned with the eastern hemisphere are the work of William L. Thomas, Jr. Suggestions to compiling editors regarding content for their introductory sections originated with Anna M. Pikelis, who also determined the criteria applied in condensing the several chapters and edited the chapters concerned with the western hemisphere. The two editors, notwithstanding this expedient division of labor, collaborated closely throughout the progress of the work, and hold themselves jointly respon- sible for existent shortcomings. Many already full hands at the Wenner-Gren Foundation have, at one time or another, been willingly applied to the preparation of press copy for this volume, and the editors wish, in this context, to extend their sincere appreciation to Elizabeth Davis, Mary Dell'Oro, Nell Rodgers, Judith Rosenthal, Nancy Silbo- witz, and Alice Uchida. Grateful thanks are also extended for the special con- tributions of Emil Vernei and Steven Foltinyi, Muriel Porter, and Claude Tardits, who translated those chapters submitted in the German, Spanish, and French languages, respectively. The editors are most particularly indebted to Jean Stewart, whose competence and spirit of willing cooperation have, in the nature of human nature, encouraged the editors to make demands on her above and beyond the call of duty, to the greater good of the volume. Anna M. Pikelis William L. Thomas, Jr. New York City March, 1953 INTERNATIONAL Three types of institutions are considered in this chapter: intergovernmental organizations, interna- tional nongovernmental organizations, and interna- tional nongovernmental regional organizations. The intergovernmental organizations are agencies established by the cooperative efforts of two or more national governments. The scope of their activities extends over two or more of the countries or regions treated in the separate chapters that follow. None of the institutions is devoted exclusively to anthro- pological interests, though all draw upon the services of anthropologists for administration or research. Through their programs and publications anthro- pological work is being supported. The editors are indebted for data to Dr. Alfred Metraux for the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), Dr. Juan Comas for the Institute Panamericano de Geografi'a e Historia and its Comision de Historia, and the Inter-Ameri- can Indian Institute, and to Dr. Felix A'l. Keesing for the South Pacific Commission. The international nongovernmental organizations are more numerous than the intergovernmental agencies. They nearly all include the word \"interna- tional\" in their titles. Their concern is world-wide, without country or regional limitation; their orienta- tion topical, bearing upon anthropology as a whole, upon one of its subdisciplines, or upon a closely- related science. These institutions function princi- pally through periodic congresses to further the in- ternational exchange of scientific information. The editors wish to thank Dr. Robert Heine-Geldern for furnishing current data on the Congres International des Sciences Anthropologiques et Ethnologiques and the Union International des Sciences Anthropo- logiques et Ethnologiques. The international nongovernmental regional or- ganizations are concerned principally with the co- ordination of information for a continental or oceanic area, or major portion thereof. Their titles reflect this orientation. The extent to which anthropology falls within the purview of these organizations varies wideh^ â from a predominant interest, as with the Congres International des Americanistes, to a minor role, as with the Conseil Scientifique pour Afrique au Sud du Sahara (C.S.A.). The editors are grate- ful for additional specific data to Dr. Daryil Forde for the International African Institute, Dr. Felix M. Keesing for the Pacific Science Association, and to Dr. L. S. B. Leakey for the Pan-African Congress of Prehistory. The twenty institutions described in this chapter are those of principal interest to anthropology at the international level. Whether governmental or nongovernmental, emphasis is upon the support of conferences, research, and publications. Nearly all of these organizations have multiple functions; learned societies, research institutions, professional associations, and subsidizing agencies are all repre- sented. Detailed data on the many hundreds of other internationally-oriented institutions, including those in fields closely related to anthropolog}', may be obtained by reference to the Yearbook of Interna- tional Organizations, 1951-1952, published at Palais d'Egmont, Brussels, Belgium, b}^ the Union of International Associations, Service Center for Inter- national Non-Governmental Organizations (in al- ternate years, in French, as Annuaire des Organisa- tions Internationales ) . INTERGOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS UNITED NATIONS EDUCATIONAL, SCIENTIFIC, AND CULTURAL ORGANIZATION (UNESCO) 19 Avenue Kleber Paris 16, France Principal Officer: Director-General. Fo-unded: 1946, as a Specialized Agency of the United Nations. Governing Body: Administered by Director-General and an Executive Board of IS members; budget and policies are de- cided by the General Conference, which meets every second year and consists of delegates from the 66 member States. Organization: The Department of Cultural .Activities and the Department of Social Sciences have been, up to the present, those mainly concerned with anthropology and anthropolo- gical research. The Departments of Education, Natural Sci- ences, and Technical Assistance have also been interested in activities which have required the participation of anthro- pology as a science and of anthropologists as specialists. The Secretariat includes both administrative officers and program specialists. Principal Activities: Department of Cultural Activities: or- ganized in 1948 the International Union of .Anthropological and Ethnological Sciences, which has been a member, since 1949, of the International Council of Philosophy and Human- istic Studies (CIPSH) through which the Union receives UNESCO subsidies. UNESCO has given subventions to the Bibliography of Americanism published by the Societe des Americanistes, to the Bibliography of Oceania published by the Societe des Oceanistes, to African Abstracts published by the International African Institute, and has subsidized two missions of the International African Institute to .Africa to study social values and religion among certain .African peoples (.Anuk of Sudan and Bonin of Nigeria). The pilot- project of the Mezquital Valley (Mexico), undertaken by the Inter-American Indian Institute to study material and mental traits of Otomi culture for the improvement of their standard International Directory of Anthropological Institutions of living and a better integration in society, also was subsi- dized. UNESCO has provided funds for the fares of scien- tists who could not otherwise attend international confer- ences such as the International Congress of Americanists at Cambridge (1952) and the International Congress of An- thropological and Ethnological Sciences at Vienna (1952). Several works of a general character have been published thanks to UNESCO subsidies, e.g., African Systems of Kin- ship and Marriage, edited by A. R. Radcliffe-Brown and D. Forde. Department of Social Sciences: Anthropology and anthro- pologists are included in the implementation of the Depart- ment's program, e.g., in the campaign against racial prejudice and discrimination. Two statements on the concept of race were prepared (1950 and 1952) by committees of experts in- cluding physical and cultural antbropologists, while in 1951, the Department undertook a survey of race relations in Brazil, in which several anthropologists (mainly in Bahia and Recife) participated. In 1952, surveys were undertaken in six countries to study measures taken to facilitate the integration of ethnic and cultural minorities and evaluate re- sults; in the West Indies, Mexico, and Brazil, the research was entrusted to anthropologists. In 1953-1954 a study will be made of the progress of native elites. The problem of the social impact of industrialization is foremost in the so- cial science program, and a party of anthropologists has been entrusted with a study of the effects of industrialization in Stanleyville (Belgian Congo). The research projects in this field, which will deal with underdeveloped areas, will use anthropological methods and specialties. An International Council of Social Sciences was created by UNESCO in 1952, the Secretary-General of which is a cultural anthropologist, Dr. Claude Levi-Strauss. Department of Education: Anthropology is included in the Department's fundamental education program. A desira- ble prerequisite of every project in fundamental education is an anthropological survey of the area in which it is to take place. This condition was actually fulfilled only in the case of Marbial (Haiti). The Division of Fundamental Education plans to develop the application of evaluation techniques for its different projects. Anthropology is destined to play an important part in these schemes. Department of Natural Sciences: Anthropological research (survey of the Huallaga River and of an .Amazonian town) was sponsored in connection with the Hylean Amazon project. The International Study of Arid Zones will also entail the participation of anthropologists in relation to population problems. Department of Technical Assistance: Educational, scien- tific and technical advice and training is provided to under- developed areas by making available, on the request of the respective member States, experts to promote and develop governmental plans in their respective fields. The help of anthropologists is required particularly at the preparatory and briefing stages. Research Facilities: Library, which includes standard works in anthropology. Publications: Department of Social Sciences: Those dealing with anthropological matters include the series \"The Race Question in Modern Science,\" the series \"Race and Society,\" and the International Social Science Bulletin, quarterly; also published, Cultural Patterns and Technical Change, a manual edited by Dr. Margaret Mead. Methods of Operation: To carry out its program, UNESCO works with the United Nations and its other Specialized Agencies, with national groups and individuals, and with international nongovernmental organizations, and also calls upon commissions of experts to exchange information and techniques. It participates in national and international con- ferences allied to UNESCO's work. UNESCO is therefore neither a foundation nor a scientific institution. It promotes learning as an instrument for peace and for understanding among peoples.

KEESING Oceania has been a vital zone for anthropologi- cal research. But it has only limited institutional facilities apart from the metropolitan countries which control the various territories in the area. Scientific organizations with area-wide research interests are the Pacific Science Association (see p. 7), with branches in the major Pacific countries and a central international office and secretariat in Hono- lulu, Hawaii, and the Pacific Science Board of the United States National Research Council, with headquarters in Washington, D. C, and a branch office in Honolulu. These each include all fields of anthropology within their scientific interests, and their officers stand ready to aid institutions and scholars wishing to get official clearances and to otherwise open the way to research within the area. The Pacific Science Association convenes periodic Congress meetings which provide opportunities for specialists in Oceanic studies to report on current research and participate in significant symposia (see Proceedings to date). It has a Standing Committee on Anthropology and Social Sciences in the Pacific Area. The Pacific Science Board initiates or spon- sors various types of group and individual research and technical interchange, e.g., the now completed \"Coordinated Investigation of Micronesian Anthro- pology\"; continuing \"Scientific Investigations in Micronesia\"; coral island team surveys; conservation conferences. University level institutions, apart from those in the metropolitan countries which emphasize train- ing and research relating to the area (see below), are limited to one, the University of Hawaii, in Honolulu. This is a government-supported institu- tion maintained by the Territory, teaching to the master's degree level and also to the doctorate level in a few fields; it currently gives the B.A. and M.A. degrees in anthropology, and also an M.A. in \"Pacific Islands Area Studies.\" Its anthropology staff con- sists mainly of specialists on Micronesia and Poly- nesia; informal cooperation is maintained with the Bishop Museum, and a modest but active program of training and research relating to the area is carried forward. Studies of Asian peoples, strongly repre- sented in Hawaii's population, have also received some emphasis in the anthropology department and in interdisciplinary programs. In Suva, Fiji, hub for the British central Pacific territories, official plan- ning contemplates the possible development of a university college to be built outward from the Cen- tral Medical School which trains island medical prac- titioners. In New Caledonia, a corresponding French university college may be built up from the La Perouse College technical and sub-professional train- ing center at Noumea. Of research institutions, the outstanding one is the Bernice Pauahi Bishop Museum in Honolulu, Hawaii. This, founded in 1889, is a research center as well as a museum repository, and includes all fields of anthropology in its scientific program and serial publications. Its work has concentrated on island Polynesia, but its interests extend to Microne- sia and eastern Melanesia. In addition to extensive ethnographic, archeological, linguistic, and skeletal collections, it has a first-class research library, with well organized reference catalog, maps, photographic collections, and much unpublished documentation, and also workroom and laboratory facilities. His- torically, through an institutional linkage with Yale University and otherwise, it has been a study center for visiting scholars, and has organized group ex- peditions and individual field trips. On a smaller scale, but also of scientific importance to the area, is the more recently established Institut Frangais d'Oceanie (IFO) at Anse Vata, New Caledonia. This, established in 1946 in former military hospital buildings donated by the United States Government, includes a \"Laboratoire d'Ethnologie\" with modest but useful office, workroom, and display space. A full-time ethnologist, with part-time colleagues and technical assistants, has been developing ethnologi- cal, and to some extent linguistic and archeological, studies in the French zones of Melanesia. Properly sponsored visiting scholars are given facilities, and possibly living accommodations if available. Local scientific societies can also be of aid to the anthropological field worker in the area concerned. In Hawaii the Anthropological Society of Hawaii, with headquarters in Honolulu, issues News from the Pacific and draws together professionals and in- terested nonprofessionals in periodic meetings. There is also a Conservation Council for Hawaii, of which the Archaeological and Historical Sites Com- mittee is concerned with archeological conservation. More marginally the Hawaiian Academy of Science includes anthropology in a wide range of scien- tific interests. In Fiji, The Fiji Society marshals local official and citizen interest in anthropology along with other scientific knowledge, holding periodic meetings and publishing occasional Trans- 10 International Directory of Anthropological Institutions actions; it is something of a successor to the now defunct Fijian Society which speciahzed in anthro- pological studies. In French territories there are two such organizations, each receiving some local government support, the Societe des Etudes Melane- siennes, based in Noumea, New Caledonia, and pub- lishing its occasional bulletin titled Etudes Melane- siennes, and the Societe des Etudes Oceaniennes, based on Papeete in Tahiti, French Establishments in Oceania, with its Bulletin. A Samoan Society has been sporadically active in Apia, Western Samoa, but not recently. In Port Moresby, Australian Ter- ritory of Papua and New Guinea, the Papua and New Guinea Scientific Society includes anthro- pology among its interests; it holds periodic meetings and publishes an Annual Report of its activities. Museums, other than the Bishop Museum in Honolulu, are all small, though their collections in- clude old and often valuable materials. In Honolulu, the Hawaiian Academy of Arts is particularly strong in art pieces from East and South Asia. In Fiji the local government authorities maintain the Suva Museum, displaying Fijian and other Oceanic arti- facts; but it has no technical staff or significant workroom and storage space. New Caledonia has the Musee Neo-Caledonien, operated by the local government in conjunction with the Bernheim Li- brary, with collections from New Caledonia and adjacent areas, and the Institut Frangais d'Oceanie (above) is developing modest museum displays in connection with its research work in French Mel- anesia. Tahiti, in the French Establishments, has the Papeete Museum, associated administratively with the Societe des Etudes Oceaniennes, and dis- playing eastern Polynesian artifacts. Before the war devastation, similar local government-supported mu- seums existed at Agaiia, capital of the United States territory of Guam, and in what were then the sepa- rate Australian territories of Papua (at Port Moresby) and New Guinea (at Rabaul). There are hopes that museum collections can be reestablished at Guam, relative to Micronesia, and also at Port Moresby, capital of the now combined Territory of Papua and New Guinea. The metropolitan countries which control terri- tories in the area continue to provide the main insti- tutional framework for training and research relat- ing to their respective zones of authority. While the institutions concerned are discussed in the context of these countries, a brief summary may be included here for cross-reference purposes, i.e., to show which institutions stress studies of Oceania. Treated alpha- betically by countries they are as follows: Australia: The Australian National Research Council (with its anthropological journal, Oceania); the Australian National University, Graduate School of Pacific Studies, Canberra (social anthropology); the University of Sydney, Department of Anthro- pology (ethnology, social anthropology, linguistics); the Australian School of Pacific Administration, Mosman, Sydney (applied anthropology, training of administrative personnel, journal South Pacific); Institute of Anatomy, Canberra (physical anthro- pology, nutrition); Australian Museum, Sydney (archeology); National Museum of Victoria, Mel- bourne (archeology). France: Societe des Oceanistes, based on the Musee de I'Homme, Paris (with its Journal); Office de la Recherche Scientifique Outre-Mer. The Netherlands: Koninklijk Instituut voor de Tropen, Amsterdam; Koninklijk Instituut voor Taal-, Land- en Volkenkunde, The Hague; Leiden University, Department of Anthropology, and Museum of Antiquities. New Zealand: Polynesian Society (with its Jour- nal and Memoirs); Otago University Museum (archeology); Auckland Institute and Museum (ethnography, archeology); Auckland University College, Department of Anthropology (ethnology, social anthropology, linguistics). United Kingdom: British Museum, London; an- thropology departments and museums in major uni- versities; School of Oriental and African Studies, London (linguistics). United States: Pacific Science Board and Hawaii institutions; several universities emphasizing Oceanic studies, notably Yale, Stanford, University of Cali- fornia, University of California at Los Angeles, Penn- sylvania; American Museum of Natural History, New York; Chicago Museum of Natural History; University of Pennsylvania Museum. Government authorities administering the terri- tories in the area welcome properly sponsored an- thropological research, and some employ anthropo- logical specialists temporarily or permanently, and may give financial and other aid in furthering pro- jects. Communications on such matters could go di- rectly to the administrative headquarters concerned, or be processed through institutions in the metro- politan countries. In Hawaii the National Park Service fosters scientific (including archeological) interests, and this Service is also aiding with con- servation problems in American Micronesia. In the United States Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands extensive anthropological studies have been carried on with official aid since World War II, and the administration has had, formerly under the Navy Department and now under the Department of the Interior, a small staff cadre of government anthro- pologists at its Honolulu headquarters and attached Oceania 11 to the major district centers. The AustraHan Ter- ritory of Papua and New Guinea has a long tradi- tion of government-sponsored \"applied anthro- pology,\" and supports projects of various kinds, especially within the Education Department and the Department of District Services and Native Affairs, by anthropologically trained officers and to some extent by private scholars. The authorities in other territories have generally encouraged anthro- pological work by officials, missionaries, and other local personnel with anthropological interests, and may aid visiting scholars with transport, accom- modations and other help within their means; some may employ specialists temporarily to deal with linguistic and other applied problems. The South Pacific Commission, the advisory and consultative body formed in 1948 by the six nations listed above to advance economic and social wel- fare and development within their territories, has become a major instrument for governmental spon- sorship of applied research in anthropology as in other fields. Its Research Council, which gives it advice on technical problems, includes several an- thropologically trained scholars. Of a considerable number of projects which the Commission has been advancing in the fields of health, economic develop- ment, and social development, most anthropologi- cally oriented work lies within the last named field. The social development program has included basic regional surveys of completed and needed research in social anthropology and in linguistics; archeologi- cal conservation; and studies of population dy- namics, cult phenomena, literacy, community de- velopment, cooperation, etc. Parallel work in health (e.g., incidence and treatment of disease, alimenta- tion and nutrition) and economic development (e.g., agriculture, fisheries, economics of coral islands, po- tential industrialization) also have anthropological dimensions. The Commission publishes a Quarterly Bulletm, also Social Developtjient Notes, mono- graphs, and other materials. Its Executive Officer for Social Development is prepared to aid anthro- pologists wishing to work in Oceania with official and technical information, possibly to help with modest publication subsidies and to lend linguistic recording apparatus, and to advise on whether the Commission itself might sponsor any proposed research project. Concluding this survey, it may be said that Oceania, as one of the classic areas for anthropo- logical work, offers wide opportunities in all fields of anthropology far beyond what the present small group of specialists can cover. The Polynesian and Micronesian areas are most documented, but there are many gaps in standard knowledge and they offer significant \"laboratories\" for the investigation of culture change and other problem-oriented studies. The Melanesian areas, geographically extensive and ethnically diverse, have received sporadic study only; research opportunities range from newly open- ing central highland areas in New Guinea to groups around port centers where acculturation is very advanced. Most of the current work is being done in ethnology or social anthropology, often with an applied emphasis. Along with important continuing opportunities here, there is also urgent need for more specialists in Oceanic archeology, linguistics, and physical anthropology to work these fields in terms of recent advances in knowledge and tech- nique. In addition to students from outside, an edu- cated scholar from among the indigenous peoples themselves is here and there engaged in significant investigation and recording, and it can be hoped that this phase of anthropological research, sup- ported by opportunities for adequate training, will greatly increase in the future.
