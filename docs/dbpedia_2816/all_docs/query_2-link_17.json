        "text": "This article centers on the Archaic Period, Dynasty 0 through Dynasty 2, a comparatively unknown time. It focuses on the apparent instability that dominated much of that period, particularly in Dynasty 2 and proposes a sequence of the kings and a clarification of their chronology that varies from what is usually enumerated. As long-term friends and colleagues of Dr. Zahi Hawass, we are pleased and honored to offer the following commentary for inclusion in his well-deserved Festschrift. Zahi has, for many years, been a leading proponent of archaeological research into the ancient monuments of Egypt and has a long record of cooperation and collegiality with both Egyptian and foreign researchers. This has permitted an unparalleled volume of exploration and the knowledge obtained from it. He also has become a worldwide icon for the promotion of ancient Egypt.\n\nManetho’s Aegyptiaca is one of the most important sources for ancient Egyptian chronology. This applies particularly to Old Kingdom chronology, because the archaeological and inscriptional evidence is sparse and contradictory. Although the late date of its composition may provoke doubts about its historical accuracy, W. Helck has already identified genuine Egyptian historiographical sources which were used by Manetho. A reevaluation of previous results concerning the kings’ names and lengths of reign provided by Manetho allows for the following conclusions: Manetho made use of at least two different Egyptian historiographical accounts for his Third and Fourth Dynasties. One of these contained in part the number of census-cycles for the Fourth Dynasty, while the other contained only correctly converted numbers of regnal years. Manetho’s account of the Fourth dynasty is therefore an important, but not yet fully recognized source for the determination of the regularity of the census until the late Fifth Dynasty."
