The colloquium was originally conceived as a kind of follow-up on the one that was held in October 2015 at the Humboldt University in Berlin and dealt with the Nag Hammadi codices and their place in the history of early Christian theology1. Due attention was paid to the so-called “new philology” approach, asking whether these texts should be read in their “original” context or rather in that in which the copies that came to us are to be dated. The Leuven colloquium picked up on the Berlin meeting, but did not just focus on Gnostic texts. It also studied other writings for which much the same questions are on the table with regard to determining their place in the development of Christian theology in that early period. The better part of second- and early third-century Christian writings has come down to us with only few and mostly vague or disputed indications about their author, date, provenance, intentions, and readership – in short, without much of a contextualisation. The consequences of this situation for interpreting these writings or assessing whatever relationships there might be between some of them, let alone for situating them in a genealogy or a survey of the development of Christian theology in that early period are obvious and most regrettable. To mention just one recent example: some scholars have challenged the generally accepted position that the synoptic gospels are among the oldest Christian writings that have come to us, firmly dated to the latter decades of the first century, and have started to propose to date them well into the second century. Even if their arguments are disputed and probably cannot prove the hypothesis, such proposals are illustrative of the difficulties there are in dating and contextualising many of these early writings, and also of the ingenuity of some to come up with really innovating, though so far unconvincing, proposals. The situation is very much the same for many other texts. Many have given up on the old opinion about the early dating of the letters of Ignatius, but no consensus has been reached about when to date this corpus in the second century, in part also because the corpus 1. Cf. J. SCHRÖTER – K. SCHWARZ (eds.), Die Nag-Hammadi-Schriften in der Literaturund Theologiegeschichte des frühen Christentums (STAC, 106), Tübingen, Mohr Siebeck, 2017.\n\n2\n\nJ. VERHEYDEN – J. SCHRÖTER – T. NICKLAS\n\nseems to have had a rather complicated composition and transmission history. But dating and identifying a particular writing is just one aspect of the problem. More important, though closely linked to the former, is the broader question of how these writings are then to be used in attempts at reconstructing a history of earliest Christian theology. One thing seems to be clear: there is no way that this history can be conceived of as one of steady intellectual progress. Bearing in mind the dangers of accepting a straightforward development of Christian thinking, one must take seriously the possibility that writings which seem to represent an “older theology” (however that is to be defined) may well be younger in origin than some other works that apparently promote a more developed form of theology. The whole situation is further complicated by the fact that we do not possess any autographs but only copies that (by far) postdate the commonly accepted date of composition of a particular writing. This has brought some scholars fundamentally to question what should be our main focus in studying these texts: trying to give them a place in (what is thought to be) their original context, or perhaps rather to look for why such writings where divulged and transmitted long after they were composed, possibly even for quite other reasons than those of the original author. These ancient texts are studied here for what they can tell us about their author, their date of composition, the theology they represent or seek to promote, and if possible the reasons why they were after all preserved and passed on to later generations of readers. Among them are letters (Ignatius’ letters to several communities, 1 Clement), a work whose genre is more difficult to define (2 Clement), one that looks like the Church orders of a later period (the Didache), several works that show similarities in content and composition to the canonical gospels or claim to be “a gospel” (the Gospel according to the Hebrews, the Gospel of Thomas, the Gospel of Philip, and the Gospel of Judas), and a number of other writings of various genre and nature that were discovered, together with some of the gospels just mentioned, as part of a larger corpus of which the origins remain unknown and that are quite innovative or peculiar in content and reasoning (the Nag Hammadi codices). Paul FOSTER (Edinburgh) surveys the problems related to the collection and textual transmission of the letters attributed to Ignatius of Antioch. The question of dating remains a vexed issue, and so is that of assessing the origin and purpose of the various types and recensions of the collection which prove an ongoing interest in the writings of the famous church leader, but also illustrate the liberty with which later generations of readers defined the corpus. Christopher M. TUCKETT (Oxford) deals with the dating of the two “letters” ascribed to Clement. He argues for the\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n3\n\n“classical” date of 1 Clement at the turn of the first and second century, or perhaps even in the very last years of the first century; he remains slightly more hesitant about 2 Clement, favouring a rather earlier date against recent suggestions to read the text as a critique of Marcion. John S. KLOPPENBORG (Toronto) presents a rather innovative approach to the Didache when comparing its rules and stipulations and similar material in Apostolic Constitutions 7 with the bylaws of cultic associations. If some of this material with regard to organising the community/group is strikingly similar, the Didache stands out in its interest in prayers, in teaching and in behaving towards teachers. Jörg FREY (Zürich) surveys the whole range of problems with regard to determining the origin, date and context of Jewish-Christian gospels in general and the Gospel according to the Hebrews in particular. His analysis leads him to conclude the latter dates from the first decades of the second century, but was soon circulated also outside the community for which it was originally composed though it never received an authoritative status and was doomed to fade away. The remaining essays all have to do with texts that were discovered at Nag Hammadi or are related to this material. Hugo LUNDHAUG (Oslo) promotes what he calls “a multi-methodological approach” to our efforts to date the Nag Hammadi codices. Special attention is given to the radiocarbon dating that can complement the more classical approaches based on form and format of the material and information gained from the archaeological context. Christine JACOBI (HU-Berlin) compares the views of Irenaeus, Tertullian and the Gospel of Philip on bodily resurrection as a way to contextualise the latter writing. She points out several interesting similarities between the Gospel of Philip and Irenaeus in the way both understand the relation of the believer with the risen Lord and the sacramental dimension this can receive. Konrad SCHWARZ (HU-Berlin) situates the Gospel of Thomas in relation to Judaism, other early Christian writings, and contemporary philosophical teachings, arguing that the first of these is given only limited attention, using elements of Jewish ritual praxis primarily in a metaphorical way, that there are isolated points of convergence with the Gospel of Matthew and John, though the motif of faith is largely missing, and that there are interesting similarities with philosophical traditions both with regard to anthropology and the notion of the divine. Francis WATSON (Durham) studies the Apocryphon of James as one more testimony of the dispute on the status of the apostles besides such writings as the Gospel of Mary and the Gospel of Judas. The Apocryphon has its own agenda in this dispute as the work emphasises above all the superiority of its own testimony over that of the apostles and promotes an (elitist) position that nuances the role of the apostles as reliable witnesses in favour of the knowledge granted to the blessed\n\n4\n\nJ. VERHEYDEN – J. SCHRÖTER – T. NICKLAS\n\nby the Saviour. It is another “apocryphon”, the Apocryphon of John, Jean-Daniel DUBOIS (EPHE-Paris) deals with in discussing the various options for dating and locating the work and assessing the criteria that can be used for this purpose, including indications based on its interest in philosophical matters, Christology and use of the Scriptures. The most plausible option is a date sometime in the midst of the second century, when New Testament writings were not yet commonly cited as authoritative, without trying to be too precise given the sorry state of our evidence. Three more documents are studied by Dylan M. BURNS (FU-Berlin). They all deal, in a critical way, with “pagan” philosophical views on providence and cosmogony in the format of doxographies – the closely Eugnostos and the Wisdom of Jesus Christ aiming at Greek philosophy, the Tripartite Tractate tackling both pagan and elements from Christian (and Jewish) philosophical thought on the matter. The texts are to be situated at the intersection of Christian apologetics and heresiography highlighting the differences rather than the similarities there might be between the various traditions and warning against the lure of Greek (“barbarian”) wisdom. Anna VAN DEN KERCHOVE (Faculty of Protestant Theology – Paris) discusses Irenaeus’ views on the Gospel of Judas, focusing on the question whether there might have been circulating two writings with this title, but settling for the “simpler” solution that Irenaeus was talking about the same work that has been preserved in Coptic and deriving from this a proposal for dating the text in the third quarter of the second century. There is no easy way for contextualising the large majority of secondand early third-century Christian writings. Any such effort must be a combined effort that takes into account all possible indications given by the these texts and all tools modern science can offer us. Among the former are external witnesses, linguistic and stylistic criteria and content-related indications; among the latter, archaeological evidence and other ways for dating ancient material. The sheer wealth and diversity of the contents of many of these writings, the apologetic or polemical intention of most of the external witnesses, and the brutal fact that Christian theology developed at various speeds and certainly not onedirectionally all contribute to keeping scholars aware of the difficulties involved in the task and of the relativity of many of their findings. Relative chronologies and the relative positioning of writings among each other are perhaps the best we can aim for, but in any case it is better than keeping blind for the problems and indulging in delusive certainties.

INTRODUCTION If the level of tampering with contents is an indicator of importance, then the letters of Ignatius constitute one of the most important collections of early Christian literature. The relationship between the various recensions of this corpus has fascinated many subsequent generations. The concerns expressed over the relationship between these differing forms of the letter collection is not simply a knotty problem, which is the preserve of ivory-towered scholars alone. Rather, arguments relating to the authenticity, or otherwise, of these various recensions has been the basis of polarised debates between leading church figures over matters of ecclesiastic structure, and in regard to key questions of theology and doctrine for many centuries and also in multiple contexts within Christian history. Therefore, far from being abstract and arcane, discussions concerning the form of the Ignatian letter collection and the authenticity of the contents of the individual letters have played a significant role in some of the major theological debates in the church from the patristic era to the contemporary period. There is much to be learnt from a close study of the various corpora of the letters of Ignatius, especially when each collection form is studied in its own terms with its own theological concerns and agendas. As such, the writings of Ignatius provide multiple windows into various moments of church history and the related theological debates spanning not only many centuries, but in fact stretching across the first two millennia of the Christian religion. However, due to the very widely and correctly accepted scholarly consensus that the so-called middle recension of the letters of Ignatius represented the authentic writings of the bishop of Antioch, the result has been the virtual neglect of study concerning the later expanded form of the Ignatius’ writings – the so-called long recension. Yet even that terminology requires clarification. It should be noted that the “long recension”, occurs in two distinct forms and phases. Both of these phases reflects the literary creativity of later generations of Christian thought. For this reason, close analysis of the long recension provides invaluable insight into the theological concerns and the ecclesiastical structures of\n\n6\n\nP. FOSTER\n\nvarious groups of believers both during the second half of the fourth century, and also at a later more indeterminate time. It should also be noted that while the long recension has been labelled as a “recension”, this belies the fact that it comprises of six fresh epistolary compositions in Greek, and then also at a later phase a further four brief Latin letters. In fact, the long recension of the letters of Ignatius, as a development of the middle recension, contains far more original material than for instance Matthew’s Gospel does in comparison to its largest source, Mark’s Gospel1. Yet, while the long recension of the letters of Ignatius contains far more original material than Matthew does in comparison to Mark, this larger corpora of Ignatian writings has received only marginal interest2. In part, this might perhaps be due to the more explicit attempt of the long recension of the letters of Ignatius to displace the shorter form of the middle recension. Ultimately, this literary ruse may have led to the “downfall” of the long recension, when in the modern period it was finally exposed as being a later literary expansion of the earlier, authentic middle recension of the writings of Ignatius. The result has been the almost total neglect of the long recension in its own right as a collection of important Christian writings expressing a particular set of theological concerns. However, that change of focus was a reversal of the dominance of the long recension from the time of its composition until the seventeenth century, when it was shown not to represent the authentic letter collection of Ignatius. However, continued study of the long recension can reveal much about the evolution and development of Christian theology in the late fourth century and later periods. Therefore, as a means of providing insight into the ways in which a particular strand of theological thought evolved and grew from earlier traditions into later expressions and formulations, the long recension represents an important example of such development of theological thought and argument. 1. The Gospel of Matthew contains 1068 verses and the Gospel of Mark comprises 661 verses. According to Streeter, on a maximalist count “Matthew reproduces the substance of all but 55 verses of Mark”. B.H. STREETER, The Four Gospels: A Study in Origins, London, Macmillan, 1924, p. 169. Streeter, however, believes this is an over-estimate, and that some of the 55 verses in question are not cases of omission but rather substitution. Based on a different method of counting, Beaton estimates that Matthew reproduces 73% of Matthew’s words. This percentage is obtained on the basis of Beaton count that Matthew has reproduced 8555 of the 11,708 words contained in the Gospel of Mark. R.C. BEATON, How Matthew Writes, in M. BOCKMUEHL – D.A. CARSON (eds.), The Written Gospels, Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 2005, p. 120, n. 25. 2. The comparison between the scholarly focus on Matthew’s Gospel – which is never labelled as a mere recension, and the long recension of the letters of Ignatius which is rarely studied is illustrative of the status of the former as a new composition and the latter as a mere revision. Therefore, perhaps part of the reason for this is that the Gospel of Matthew does not claim to be an expanded authentic version of Mark.\n\nTHE IGNATIAN PROBLEM\n\n7\n\nII. THE MANY RECENSIONS OF THE LETTERS OF IGNATIUS AND THEIR RELATIONSHIP It is generally agreed that there are three major recensions of the letters of Ignatius, one of which has two identifiable phases. In what follows, a brief overview will be provided of these three recensions, focusing on their contents, sequence, and relationship. The scholarly consensus or debate concerning the date of each recension will be briefly discussed. However, the theological concerns and developments in each of the major recensions will be discussed in separate sections that follow after this initial discussion of the relationship between the various recensions of the letters of Ignatius. 1. The Middle Recension It is widely, but not universally accepted that the middle recension reflects the earliest form of the corpus of the letters of Ignatius. Moreover, these letters are generally accepted to be the genuine literary compositions of Ignatius, the bishop of Antioch. This recension comprises seven letters, all written in a relative short period of time while Ignatius was being transported under custody of Roman guard to face execution in the imperial capital3. The epistles of the middle recension are typically divided into two groups. The first group consists of the four letters that were written by Ignatius while he was at Smyrna. These are the letters to the Ephesians, Magnesians, Trallians, and to the Romans. The next group of three letters, also written by Ignatius but from Troas, are the letters to the Philadelphians and the one to the Smyrnaeans, as well as the only letter of the middle recension addressed to an individual, the Letter to Polycarp, the bishop of Smyrna4. The arguments in favour of the originality and authenticity of the middle recension are many and varied. First, the earliest manuscript evidence for a writing from the Ignatian corpus is a substantial fragment of the 3. In relation to the compressed period of composition of all seven letters of Ignatius, Holmes makes the following comment. “We meet him for the first and only time for just a few weeks not long before his death as a martyr in Rome early in the second century. But during those weeks he wrote, virtually as his ‘last will and testament’, seven letters of extraordinary interest because of the unparalleled light they shed on the history of the church at that time, and because of what they reveal about the remarkable personality of the author”. M.W. HOLMES (ed.), The Apostolic Fathers: Greek Texts and English Translations, Grand Rapids, MI, Baker, 32007, p. 166. 4. Lightfoot uses a larger division of the Ignatian letters into five groups for his classification of the long recension. The two groups of the middle recension still stand as separate groups in that larger five group system. See J.B. LIGHTFOOT, The Apostolic Fathers. Part 2: Ignatius and Polycarp, London, Macmillan, 1889, vol. 3, p. 128.\n\n8\n\nP. FOSTER\n\nLetter to the Smyrnaeans (Ign., Smyr. 3,3–12,1). This fragment, P. Berol. 10581, is in the form of a papyrus codex, and the portion of the text of the Letter to the Smyrnaeans that it preserves reflects the textual form of the middle recension. Second, the evidence preserved in the early fourth century writings of Eusebius of Caesarea shows that the form of text he used was the middle recension of the Ignatian corpus5. Describing the writings of Ignatius, Eusebius refers only to the seven letters of the middle recension. Moreover, the excerpts he cites agree with the textual form contained in the middle recension (Eusebius, Hist. Eccl. 3,36). Third, the expansions to the seven letters of the middle recension that are found in the textual form of the long recension, as well as the contents of the additional letters of the letters of the long recension, betray at several points later theological concerns. Hence, the long recension clearly appears secondary in nature, and thus it is best understood as a subsequent and later form of the Ignatian letter corpus in comparison to the earlier middle recension. While it is widely accept that the textual form of the middle recension is earlier than that of the long recension, nonetheless a number of scholars have questioned the authenticity of the middle recension. That is, while they see the middle recension as being the earliest form of the Ignatian corpus, such scholars have questioned whether this seven letter form of the corpus originates with Ignatius himself. Two separate lines of approach have been adopted in relation to questioning the authenticity of the middle recension as a set of writings authored by Ignatius. First, Rius-Camps has suggested that the middle recension itself is a mix of authentic and inauthentic letters. His hypothesis is that Ignatius was the author of only four of the letters of the middle recension, and that the other three were spurious6. The second approach comprises a more thoroughgoing rejection of the entire seven letter collection of the middle recension as having been written by Ignatius. In this vein, Joly argues that the entire seven letter corpus is a fabrication7. This line of argument 5. The determination of the date of the Historia Ecclesiastica has occasioned scholarly investigation. Andrew Louth argued that the work was first issued in AD 313, but the current form was updated around 323 or 324 to include more recent events. See A. LOUTH, The Date of Eusebius’ Historia Ecclesiastica, in JTS 41 (1990) 111-123. See also, T.D. BARNES, The Editions of Eusebius’ Ecclesiastical History, in Greek, Roman and Byzantine Studies 21 (1980) 191-201, p. 196. 6. The four letters written from Smyrna are considered authentic (Ephesians, Magnesians, Trallians, and Romans), while the three from Troas (Philadelphians, Smyrnaeans, and the Letter to Polycarp) are deemed to be later creations.

JOLY, Le Dossier d’Ignace d’Antioch (Université libre Bruxelles, Faculté de Philosophie et lettres, 69), Bruxelles, Éditions de l’Universitié de Bruxelles, 1979.\n\nTHE IGNATIAN PROBLEM\n\n9\n\nhas been developed further by Hübner, who argues that the seven letters of the middle recension at various points reflect knowledge of a more developed form of Gnosticism, which was not known prior to the second half of the second century. Consequently, it is argued that the contents of the seven letters are not chronologically consistent with the date of the final years of the life and martyrdom of Ignatius, which is traditionally placed towards the beginning of the second century8. The arguments of Hübner have been greatly developed and supplemented by his student Thomas Lechner9. The main positive argument Lechner presents in favour of the rejection of Ignatius’ authorship of the middle recension is that he considers the so-called “Hymn of the Star” (Ign., Eph. 19) to be a parody of Valentinian myth. Thus, it is suggested that some of the material contained in the middle recension reflects a rebuttal of Valentinian cosmology. On this basis, he dates the middle recension to the period AD 165 to 17510. Even if Lechner’s arguments concerning the target of the polemic in the Hymn of the Star were widely viewed as persuasive, then all that could be inferred is that this single section of the Letter to the Ephesians might be later material. The implication might then be that this short section were an interpolation into a genuine letter. However, the arguments of Lechner and Hübner have not thus far altered the scholarly consensus that the middle recension does represent the authentic writings of Ignatius. The reason for the lack of acceptance of this theory is that the proposed points of contact between the middle recension of the Ignatian letters and Valentinian cosmology are neither obvious or persuasive. Therefore, the consensus that the middle recension stems from Ignatius himself and reflects the earliest form of the corpus of his writings remains intact and largely supported. 2. The Long Recension The long recension is universally agreed to reflect later stages in the development of the Ignatian corpus. However, it would be incorrect to speak without qualification of the long recension being composed either at a single point of time, or as exemplifying a unified compositional 8. R.M. HÜBNER, Thesen zur Echtheit und Datierung der sieben Briefe des Ignatius von Antiochien, in ZAC 1 (1997) 44-72. 9. T. LECHNER, Ignatius adversus Valentinianos?

Typically the long recension is understood as comprising the seven letters of the middle recension but in expanded forms, and combined with six additional letters written in Greek11. This standard definition of the contents of the long recension was challenged by Jack Hannah, who stated that the long recension “consists of the same letters [as the middle recension] but extensively expanded and edited”12. Hannah described the three letters that survive in Syriac and which are known as the short recension as his third group. Subsequently he identifies a fourth group which “consists of six letters which are regarded by most scholars as spurious”13. Not only is Hannah’s classification system non-standard, it is motivated by the thesis he presents in his article. On the basis of his understanding of the long recension, comprising only the expanded forms of the seven letters of the middle recension, he argues that “this recension was made about A.D. 140 in the vicinity of Ephesus”14. Later in his article Hannah dates the long recension more broadly to AD 135-155, commenting that “the LR becomes the earliest truly anti-Gnostic writing”15. Hannah adds one further argument to his thesis. He sees the type of editorial work that was undertaken by the redactor of the long recension as mirroring that of the supposed redactor of the Pauline corpus, who is viewed as having produced the Pauline letter to the Ephesians and was one of the architects of the revival of Paulinism in this same period of the second quarter of the second century. From this set of observations, Hannah advances his major conclusion: The fact that two sets of literature, the Pauline and the Ignatian, both appear to have undergone a similar type of redaction, suggests that a school existed in southwestern Asia Minor whose purpose was to establish the lines of orthodoxy for the churches16.\n\n11. This standard understanding of the long recension has been proposed by LIGHTThe Apostolic Fathers 2 (n. 4), vol. 1, pp. 109-134; and more recently repeated by W.R. Schoedel and by Foster. P. FOSTER, The Epistles of Ignatius of Antioch, in ID. (ed.), The Writings of the Apostolic Fathers, London, T&T Clark, 2007, 81-107, p. 84. Schoedel states, “[t]he long recension contains an expanded version of the seven letters of the middle recension and six additional letters”. W.R. SCHOEDEL, Ignatius of Antioch (Hermeneia), Philadelphia, PA, Fortress, 1985, p. 4. 12. J.W. HANNAH, The Setting of the Ignatian Long Recension, in JBL 79 (1960) 221-238, p. 221. 13. Ibid. 14. Ibid. 15. Ibid., p. 234. 16. Ibid., pp. 237-238. FOOT,\n\nTHE IGNATIAN PROBLEM\n\n11\n\nThis argument is predicated on a number of dubious assertions. First, the decision to separate the redactional work of the interpolations to the seven genuine letters from the composition of the six additional Greek letters is both arbitrary and unfounded. Second, the claim that the Pauline letters underwent the same type of redactional activity is unsupported. Additional non-Pauline letters may have been composed in the apostle’s name, but there is little evidence for the redactional expansion of the authentic Pauline letters. Third, the proposal of a redactional “school” in Asia Minor has no evidential basis, it is incredibly naïve, and it proposes an “orthodox” system of control that was unknown even in the fourth and fifth centuries. Lightfoot anticipated the type of argument that would divide the expansions to the seven authentic letters as being due to a different literary act than that of the composition of the additional letters. He bases his argument for the unity of the redactional expansions of the genuine letters and the composition of the additional letters on two pieces of evidence, which he poses as questions. The points of investigation then are twofold: First, Is the resemblance of these [additional] letters sufficiently close to justify us in assigning them to the same author [as the interpolations to the seven letters of the middle recension]: and Secondly, Does the external evidence – the phenomena of MSS and the catena of quotations – lead to the same or to an opposite conclusion17?\n\nLightfoot answers the first question with four mutually supporting observations that arise from a consideration of the internal characteristics of the interpolations and the additional compositions. First, in comparison to the sparing use of scriptural citations in the middle recension, both elements of the long recension – the expanded parts of the seven authentic letters and the additional letters – contain a preponderance of scriptural citations. Therefore, both forms of additional material employ scriptural citations in common ways, but in notably distinct manner in comparison with the authentic form of the seven letters. The second observation is the most important for the discussion of this study, but in this part of his discussion Lightfoot says relatively little. He briefly observes, “[of] the doctrinal features nothing need be said here”18. Then in good academic fashion Lightfoot comments that, “throughout the thirteen letters the same doctrines are maintained, the same heresies assailed, and the same\n\n17. LIGHTFOOT, The Apostolic Fathers 2 (n. 4), vol. 1, p. 246. 18. Ibid., p. 247.\n\n12\n\nP. FOSTER\n\ntheological terms employed”19. Consideration of these doctrinal ideas will form the basis of the discussion of the theological concerns and developments to be found in the long recension. Third, Lightfoot notes similar “literary obligations”. This term denotes literary borrowing of the same material from the authentic Ignatian letters (and from the Apostolic Constitutions) and its reuse both in the interpolations to the genuine epistles and in the additional letters. Fourth, the style and expression of interpolated passages and the additional letters is similar in a number of respects. Thus Lightfoot observes “we find in both sets of epistles the same terms applied to false teachers … there is a fondness for adjectives ending in -ικός … there is a recurrence of the same phrases … [and] there is a partiality for certain other words”20. The external evidence is a little more complex since the additional letters (sometimes without the Letter to the Philippians) are found in manuscripts both in combination with the middle recension of the seven authentic letters and chiefly with the longer form of those letters. This may reflect the way collections were formed and expanded, rather than suggesting that the additional letters circulated independently of the interpolated form of the seven genuine letters, and hence had a separate origin. Moreover, Lightfoot makes the telling point concerning the citation of material from different recensions of the Ignatian letters. In fact the tenour of external evidence will be sufficiently plain when it is stated that, whereas the seven letters are quoted by a fairly continuous series of Greek, Latin, and Syriac writers, beginning with Irenaeus and Origen in the second and third centuries, not a single quotation from the Additional Letters has been discovered prior to the last decade of the sixth century at the very earliest21.\n\nConsequently, based on both consideration of the internal feature of the interpolated passages and the additional letters, and on the external evidence that material from interpolated passages or additional letters is not cited before the end of the sixth century, a strong case can be presented for the interpolations and additional letters stemming from the same compositional hand. Writing at the beginning of the fourth century, Eusebius knew of only seven Ignatian letters, and the extensive citations he provides all reflect the form preserved in the middle recension. Therefore, there is strong reason to date the long recension, entailing both the interpolations to the seven letters of the middle recension and the six 19. Ibid., p. 248. 20. Ibid., pp. 248-249. 21. Ibid., p. 251.\n\nTHE IGNATIAN PROBLEM\n\n13\n\nadditional Greek letters, to the period after the beginning of the fourth century when Eusebius composed his Historia Ecclesiastica and prior to the end of the sixth century when citations of the long recension begin to emerge. That is the composition of the long recension is broadly, but plausibly dated to the period AD 330-590. This, however, does not quite end the discussion of the contents of the long recension of the Ignatian letters. At an even later stage four further letters began to circulate in Latin versions of manuscripts of the letters of Ignatius. The addition of these four letters may be described as the second phase of the long recension. The purpose of these four extra epistles entails further theological concerns that are no doubt part of the contemporary theological interests of the author. As will be seen from even a superficial analysis of the contents, this expansion reflects an increased interest in the figure of Mary, and the expression of piety towards her. While there have been attempts to locate the date of composition by linking it to particular moments of flourishing in Marian piety, the reality is that Marian devotion is a theological phenomenon that developed over many centuries and consequently while the theological perspective of these additional letters is transparent, the time of composition remains unclear. 3. The Short Recension The evolution of the short recension of the letters of Ignatius will be discussed more fully below, when an assessment will be made of whether there are any theological perspectives or motivations in the formation of this form of the Ignatian corpus. It is sufficient to note that this recension is known and survives only in Syriac. It consisted of three of the letters of the middle recension, Ephesians, Romans, and the letter addressed to Polycarp. These three letters have all been abbreviated in comparison with the middle recension, the Epistle to the Ephesians is the most radically abbreviated of the three. Of the three Syriac manuscripts which survive for the short recension, the earliest is typically dated to the first half of the sixth century22. Hence, it is difficult to date the short recension with any certainty prior to the sixth century.\n\n22. W. WRIGHT, Catalogue of Syriac MSS in the British Museum, London, British Museum, 1870-1872, p. 778.\n\n14\n\nP. FOSTER\n\nIII. THE THEOLOGICAL CONCERNS OF THE MIDDLE RECENSION The vast majority of scholarly attention has been focused on the so-called middle recension of the letters of Ignatius. This is understandable and likely a correct focus since the shorter form of these letters represents the authentic writings of Ignatius and also reflects Christian thought in the first half of the second century, a period from which there is a paucity of Christian documents. Due to this focus of attention, the theological profile and concerns of the middle recension are well-known. Themes that are particularly prominent include Ignatius’ christological understandings especially in response to docetic views, his reflection on the theological basis for ecclesial structures, the nature of the eucharist and the importance of corporate participation, and the rejection of what Ignatius sees as Judaising tendencies. Several of these theological themes will be treated briefly in turn, both to reflect the theological concerns of the middle recension in its own right, but then to establish a base-line with which the theological perspectives of the long recension may be compared. 1. Christological Perspectives of the Middle Recension For Ignatius, Jesus is God. This is a bold and unambiguous claim made in several places in the seven authentic letters of the middle recension. While such a claim may be based on statements in several of the writings that were later to constitute the collection of texts contained in the New Testament, none of those writings refer to the divinity of Jesus with the same levels of confidence, clarity and regularity as is found in the writings of Ignatius. Some of the strongest examples among the writings of the New Testament include the following. In the resurrection appearance scene in the fourth gospel the response from Thomas to Jesus “my Lord and my God” (John 20,28) has been frequently understood as a declaration of the deity of Jesus. While recognising the striking nature of this evocative declaration and describing it as “the supreme Christological pronouncement of the Fourth Gospel”23, Brown sees this as not equating to a doctrinal statement. Instead, Brown states, “the NT use of ‘God’ for Jesus is not yet a truly dogmatic formulation, but appears in a liturgical or cultic context”24. Whether Brown’s assessment gives due 23. R.E. BROWN, The Gospel according to John XIII–XXI (AB, 29A), New York, Doubleday, 1970, p. 1047. 24. Ibid.\n\nTHE IGNATIAN PROBLEM\n\n15\n\nweight to the significance of this declaration may be questioned. It is the case that he appears to create an arbitrary distinction between “doctrinal” and “liturgical” use. Such a distinction may not be helpful and almost certainly would not have been recognised by the fourth evangelist. Thus, in contrast, Jörg Frey has seen the affirmation in John 20,28 as fundamentally and unambiguously being a theological statement, albeit without anachronistically representing it as akin to the credal statements that emerged from the councillor discussions of the fourth and fifth centuries. Therefore, specifically in relation to John 20,28, but also taking into account the wider Johannine material, Frey states, The Johannine manner of relating God and Christ, but also Christ and the Spirit-Paraclete and even God and the Spirit, marks a decisive step towards the Trinitarian thought pattern later established by the utilization of Greek philosophical terms. Of course, the later clarifications are still far away in John, but there is at least a “proto-Trinitarian” element in the God-talk or “theology” of John25.\n\nA similar example may be found in Luke’s account of Paul’s Miletus speech, with the reference to τὴν ἐκκλησίαν τοῦ ϑεοῦ, ἣν περιεποιήσατο διὰ τοῦ αἵματος τοῦ ἰδίου, “the church of God which he purchased with his own blood” (Acts 20,28). Apart from the complicating textual variant τὴν ἐκκλησίαν τοῦ κυρίου (𝔓74 A C* D E Ψ)26, the statement has been seen as ambiguous. Taking the reading ϑεοῦ as original and as the antecedent of the pronoun in the phrase “his own blood”, it is unclear whether the author is referring to Jesus as God, or whether this is some type of anthropomorphism to describe the redemptive act of God27. When compared with these and other important yet nonetheless ambiguous statements contained in the writings of the New Testament, the affirmations that Ignatius makes concerning the divinity of Christ are far more decisive. Ignatius describes Jesus as God on multiple occasions, in 25. J. FREY, The Glory of the Crucified One: Christology and Theology in the Gospel of John (Baylor – Mohr Siebeck Studies in Early Christianity), Waco, TX, Baylor, 2018, pp. xxx-xxxi. 26. Several variants exist. The reading τὴν ἐκκλησίαν τοῦ ϑεοῦ is supported by manuscripts ‫ א‬B 614 1175 1505. What appears to be a conflation of the two basic variants, τὴν ἐκκλησίαν τοῦ κυρίου καὶ ϑεοῦ, is attested in C3 𝔐. In relation to this textual evidence, Metzger notes “The external evidence is singularly balanced between ‘church of God’ and ‘church of the Lord’ (the reading ‘church of the Lord and God’ is obviously conflate, and therefore secondary – as are also the other variant readings)”. B.M. METZGER, A Textual Commentary on the Greek New Testament, Stuttgart, Deutsche Bibelgesellschaft, 2 1994, p. 425. 27. For a discussion of the hermeneutical complexities and ambiguities of this verse see C.K. BARRETT, The Acts of the Apostles. Vol. II: Introduction and Commentary on Acts XV–XXVIII (ICC), Edinburgh, T&T Clark, 1998, pp. 976-977.\n\n16\n\nP. FOSTER\n\na variety of ways, including several that are best understood as creedal or doctrinal statements28. Towards the beginning of the Letter to the Smyrnaeans Ignatius states, Δοξάζω Ἰησοῦν Χριστὸν τὸν ϑεὸν τὸν οὕτως ὑμᾶς σοφίσαντα, “I glorify Jesus Christ the God who made you wise” (Ign., Smyr. 1,1). The referent ϑεόν is placed in apposition to Ἰησοῦν Χριστόν, and these two nominal terms are dual ways of denoting the same entity. Here Schoedel notes that “Ignatius goes beyond Paul in calling Christ ‘God’”29. This provides an unambiguous example of language in the middle recension of the letters of Ignatius where Jesus is unhesitatingly named as “God”. In one of Ignatius’ semi-credal statements30, as an expression of his doctrinal understanding, Ignatius writes: ὁ γὰρ ϑεὸς ἡμῶν Ἰησοῦς ὁ Χριστὸς ἐκυοφορήϑη ὑπὸ Μαρίας κατ᾽ οἰκονομίαν ϑεοῦ ἐκ σπέρματος μὲν Δαυείδ πνεύματος δὲ ἁγίου ὃς ἐγεννήϑη καὶ ἐβαπτίσϑη ἵνα τῷ πάϑει τὸ ὕδωρ καϑαρίσῃ (Ign., Eph. 18,2). For our God, Jesus the Christ, was conceived by Mary according to God’s plan, both from the seed of David and of the Holy Spirit. He was born and baptized in order that by his suffering he may cleanse the water (Ign., Eph. 18,2).\n\nHere Ignatius names “our God” as “Jesus the Christ”, as the first statement in a sequence of christological affirmations. It is striking to observe that while Ignatius calls Jesus “our God”, he can also describe Jesus as being conceived by Mary. Therefore, Ignatius perceives no fundamental tension between affirming Jesus as divine, while in the same breadth declaring him to have been conceived through a human mother. The use of the possessive pronoun is typical of Ignatius’ phraseology (cf. Ign., Eph. inscrip.)31. However, attempts to argue on the basis of this grammatical feature that Ignatius is distinguishing between types of divinity possessed by Christ and the Father are unconvincing32. Within this theological framework of declaring the divinity of Jesus, Ignatius articulates an incarnational theology that expresses the idea that this divinity was present in the human form of Jesus. When describing Jesus\n\n28. This observation is also stated by Helmut Löhr. See H. LÖHR, The Epistles of Ignatius of Antioch, in W. PRATSCHER (ed.), The Apostolic Fathers: An Introduction, Waco, TX, Baylor, 2010, 91-115, p. 110. 29. SCHOEDEL, Ignatius of Antioch (n. 11), p. 220. 30. There are five such statements. These are found in Ign., Eph. 7,2; 18,2; Magn. 11,1; Trall. 9,1-2; Smyr. 1,1-2. 31. LIGHTFOOT, The Apostolic Fathers 2 (n. 4), vol. 3, p. 26. 32. E. VON DER GOLTZ, Ignatius von Antiochien als Christ und Theologe (TU, 12/3), Leipzig, Hinrichs, 1894, pp. 21-28.\n\nTHE IGNATIAN PROBLEM\n\n17\n\nas the “one physician”, Ignatius explicates the apparent tension due to the incarnation simply by affirming both aspects of seemingly contradictory pairings: “both flesh and spirit, born and unborn, God come in the flesh, true life in death…” (Ign., Eph. 7,2). The phrase “God come in the flesh” is the way in which Ignatius expresses his claim that the human person of Jesus is to be regarded as divine. Instead of reading the phrase as σαρκὶ γενόμενος ϑεός, “God come in the flesh”, some printed texts read ἐν ἀνϑρώπῳ ϑεός, “in man – God”33. It is surprising that the latter reading, supported by a Syriac version Sf, and various Christian writers (Athanasius, Theodoret, Gelasius and Severus of Antioch) is preferred over the combined witness of Codex Mediceo-Laurentianus 57,7 (the only surviving Greek manuscript of the middle recension) and L (the Latin translation of the middle recension)34. In many ways, for the observation being made here, little is at stake. Both expressions affirm the incarnation and express Ignatius’ clear view that Jesus is to be understood as divine. It is equally striking that while Ignatius can attribute divinity to Jesus, he can also attribute to God the sufferings of Jesus. Thus addressing the Romans on the topic of his own impending martyrdom, and expressing the concern that the Roman believers will intervene on his behalf, Ignatius pleads with them not to attempt to prevent his death. He writes, “[a]llow me to be an imitator of the sufferings of my God” (Ign., Rom. 6,3). The use of the phrase τοῦ πάϑους τοῦ ϑεοῦ μου, “the suffering of my God”, reveals that Ignatius regards the model of Christ’s death, which he himself hopes to imitate, as capable of being described appropriately as God’s suffering. There is no confusion here on Ignatius’ part. His affirmation of the divinity of Christ makes it entirely valid from his perspective to speak of the sufferings as being those of God, as much as they are those of Christ35. Therefore, one of the key theological developments in the middle recension, or earliest form of the letters of Ignatius, in comparison with the Pauline epistles, the synoptic gospels and several of the other writings contained in the New Testament is the unambiguous declaration of the\n\n33. HOLMES (ed.), The Apostolic Fathers (n. 3), p. 188. 34. A theological motivation has been discerned for the change to the formula ἐν ἀνϑρώπῳ ϑεός. Schoedel states, “[t]he change can be ascribed to the desire of later theologians to avoid any suggestion of an Arian or Apollinarian Christology which denied a human soul to Christ (hence ‘man’ instead of merely flesh was required)”. SCHOEDEL, Ignatius of Antioch (n. 11), p. 61. 35. R.M. GRANT, The Apostolic Fathers: A Translation and Commentary. Vol. IV: Ignatius of Antioch, Camden, NJ, Thomas Nelson and Sons, 1966, p. 92.\n\n18\n\nP. FOSTER\n\ndivinity of Christ. These repeated affirmations are to be found at various points throughout the letters. Ignatius’ affirmation of the divinity of Jesus is found in letter openings (Ign., Eph. inscrip.; Smyr. 1,1), in the semicredal doctrinal statements (Ign., Eph. 18,2), and even in the context of discussing his own impending martyrdom. The incarnational language that Ignatius employs to describe Jesus as “God come in the flesh” (Ign., Eph. 7,2), does resonate with a similar expression found in what might be one of the later writings in the New Testament. In the Johannine epistles the author presents a test of christological orthodoxy in the following terms: ἐν τούτῳ γινώσκετε τὸ πνεῦμα τοῦ ϑεοῦ· πᾶν πνεῦμα ὃ ὁμολογεῖ Ἰησοῦν Χριστὸν ἐν σαρκὶ ἐληλυϑότα ἐκ τοῦ ϑεοῦ ἐστιν (1 John 4,2). By this you know the Spirit of God: every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God (1 John 4,2).\n\nSome of the later New Testament texts, in particular the Johannine writings, perhaps stemming from the late first century or early second century, appear to present a theological outlook that is closely related to that found in Ign., Eph. 7,2 regarding the reality of the incarnation. Ignatius’ letter is also close to the Johannine writings in terms of the date of composition, since his letters were almost certainly written in the first third of the second century. However, notwithstanding the link, in the letters of Ignatius this type of affirmation finds more explicit expression, especially through placing it alongside the claim that Jesus has not just come in the flesh, but that he is God come in the flesh. There is, therefore, no reservation in the writings of Ignatius about affirming the divinity of Christ. Rather, the issue in which Ignatius is in conflict with his opponents in the letters to the Ephesians and Trallians is the reality of the incarnation. Namely, that Jesus was truly human. The assertion that Jesus was divine, that is that he could be described as “our God, Jesus the Christ” (Ign., Eph. 18,2), appears not to have been a source of controversy. Consequently, it is possible to trace a highly significant theological development in christological understanding and expression between the writings of the New Testament and the letters of Ignatius. 2. Ecclesiology and Episcopacy in the Middle Recension Perhaps the most recognisable feature of Ignatius’ ecclesiological concerns is his advocacy for a hierarchical system of three forms of ministry. The leadership centres on a single bishop in each location, supported by presbyters, and under them deacons are involved in various aspects\n\nTHE IGNATIAN PROBLEM\n\n19\n\nof ministry. This pattern of a tripartite system of ecclesial offices is recurrent in the letters. Perhaps one of the clearest descriptions of what Ignatius envisages in the pattern is found in the Letter to the Trallians. In that context, Ignatius describes all three levels of ministry as apostolic and also as having a hierarchical relationship. It is essential, therefore, that you continue your current practice and do nothing without the bishop, but be subject also to the council of the presbyters as to the apostles of Jesus Christ … Furthermore, it is necessary that those who are deacons of the mysteries of Jesus Christ please everyone in every respect. For they are not merely deacons of food and drink, but ministers of God’s church (Ign., Trall. 2,2-3).\n\nFollowing from this statement, Ignatius also declares that deacons should be respected “as Jesus Christ”, that the bishop “is a model of the Father”, and that presbyters are a model both of “God’s council” as well as “the band of apostles” (Ign., Trall. 3,1). Ignatius demands unqualified respect for these three offices, since he sees them as typological representations of God, or of the apostles. While the fluid and imprecise nature of Ignatius’ analogical typologies have frequently been noted36, the key point is that for Ignatius the three roles of church leadership are modelled on a more fundamental ontological reality. Therefore each office has a dignity that is derived from a reality that surpasses that of the office-holder. Consequently, the three roles are to be respected precisely because they enshrine through a typological schema a divine or apostolic basis of existence. The ecclesial structure that Ignatius advocates is seen by him as being fundamental to the existence of Christian communities. Having described the three offices and their typological patterning, Ignatius boldly states, “[w]ithout these no group can be called a church” (Ign., Trall. 3,1). Such a threefold structure is, according to the Ignatian conception of ecclesiology, not merely preferential, but fundamentally essential to the constitution of such communities. In regard to Ignatius’ concept of ecclesial structure, Sullivan makes the astute observations that “he [Ignatius] had no doubt about the structure a church ought to have, but there is reason to doubt that all Christian churches of his day actually realized it”37. In fact Sullivan might be a little circumspect here. Ignatius demand for, or perhaps attempted imposition of his preferred threefold 36. For a summary of various scholars who have noted the shifting typological patterns see G. VALL, Learning Christ: Ignatius of Antioch & the Mystery of Redemption, Washington, DC, Catholic University of America Press, 2013, p. 343. 37. F.A. SULLIVAN, From Apostles to Bishops: The Development of the Episcopacy in the Early Church, New York – Mahwah, NJ, Newman, 2001, p. 111.\n\n20\n\nP. FOSTER\n\necclesial structure was in all likelihood part of the cause of the friction between him and his opponents. By rejecting the legitimacy of any rites, such as the eucharist, in Christian groups that did not adhere this threefold pattern of ministry Ignatius declared such believers to be deviant and thus not patterned on the Jesus, the Father or the apostles. Although the innovation of this threefold pattern of ministry may not have been an innovation created by Ignatius, he advocates for it in particularly strong tones and to the exclusion of any other pattern. Moreover, within this three-level scheme he argues for the exaltation of the role of the bishop to a degree that appears to be more prominent than that reflected in other Christian texts of the period, or earlier38. The consistent advocacy of this threefold pattern of ministry differs from what is envisaged in the Pauline letters. Among those letters that are typically considered to be authentic Paul does not tend to address individuals or even a smaller subset of the community as the authority figures. Thus Thompson can conclude his study on leadership in the Pauline churches by noting that “[t]he undisputed letters of Paul give little indication of the emergence of the ecclesiastical offices that are evident in the Pastoral Epistles and the literature of the next generation”39. While Dunn sees the development of institutional offices as described in the Pastoral Epistles as a typical routinisation of the charisma familiar in new religious movements, nonetheless he sees that development as being in line with the Pauline heritage. However, Dunn argues that while Paul envisaged his communities as spirit-led charismatic entities, alongside this “[l]eadership did emerge”40. According to Dunn, this is seen with named individuals such as Stephanus and his household, as well as Fortunatus and Achaicus (1 Cor 16,15-18). The leadership role of such figures is seen when Paul instructs the Corinthians that they should “be in subjection to such men and to everyone who helps in the work” (1 Cor 16,16). As Dunn states, this is “an appeal for the charismatic authority of their actions to be acknowledged. The initiatives they had taken and the hard work they had displayed were so obviously good that their lead should\n\n38. While Schoedel assumes that the threefold pattern of ministry must have been widely the norm among Christian communities, he does see the focus on the episcopal office as due to Ignatius’ own concerns and perspectives. Thus he states, “[i]t is only his exaltation of the role of the bishop that sometimes strikes us as going beyond what was commonly accepted”. SCHOEDEL, Ignatius of Antioch (n. 11), p. 142. 39. J.W.

This perspective is obviously different from the set and hierarchically structured pattern of leadership found in the writings of Ignatius. What Ignatius describes is more noticeably akin to the pattern of leadership outlined in the Pastoral Epistles. In the letters to Timothy and the letter to Titus at various points the three terms ἐπισκοπή/ ἐπίσκοπος42, πρεσβύτερος43, and διάκονος44, are all used to designate leadership roles in the contexts being addressed. While the use of the terms overlaps with the terms employed in the letters of Ignatius, the two sets of terms are not used in identical ways. Trebilco argues that in the Pastoral Epistles the terms ἐπισκοπή and πρεσβύτερος do not refer to two discrete roles, but are alternative and overlapping ways of referring to a leadership role, although the terms are not coterminous. From this viewpoint he argues that the term πρεσβύτερος is used in two senses. First, it originally designated “senior members” of the community, a meaning found in 1 Tim 5,1. This was a group of people who were not necessarily the leaders with the requisite skills laid out in the Pastoral Epistles45. Second, there are ruling presbyters. Trebilco argues, “that the ‘presbyters’ who according to 1 Tim 5:17-19 are to rule well and teach are the same group as the ‘overseers’ in 1 Tim 3”46. Therefore, Trebilco envisages only two leadership groups in the Pastoral Epistles, but described using three terms. These leadership groups are the “presbyter-elders” and the “deacons”. If Trebilco’s analysis is correct, this reveals a marked difference from the threefold pattern in the writings of Ignatius. If Trebilco were not correct, then it is still the case that the roles attributed to the leadership offices in the Pastoral Epistles are loosely defined and fall short of the authority ascribed in particular to the ἐπισκοπή in the letters of Ignatius. Therefore, the Pastoral Epistles reflect some kind of medial position in regard to the leadership structures in early Christian communities in comparison to the charismatic roles described in the authentic Pauline letters and the more hierarchically structured system of church governance envisaged in the letters of Ignatius. However, despite the development reflected in the Pastoral Epistles in comparison with the authentic or earlier letters of Paul, they do not display the same level of development found in 41.

Consequently, the letters of Ignatius portray a marked development in the structure of church leadership in comparison to all phases of the Pauline writings. 3. The Eucharist in the Middle Recension Within the middle recension there is also a marked development in the theological understanding of the eucharist in comparison with the ideas expressed in the gospels and the Pauline letters. In many ways Ignatius’ eucharistic thought should be considered to be one of his fundamental and lasting contributions to a Christian theology of the eucharist. The ideas that he expressed, although admittedly undergoing development and refinement in the thought of later Christian writers, were without doubt foundational for those theological reflections of subsequent generations. Within the New Testament, broadly speaking there are two interlinked strands of eucharistic traditions. The first is the description of Jesus’ Last Supper as recorded in the synoptic gospels (Matt 26,26-29// Mark 14,22-25//Luke 22,14-20). Although there are some important differences, the Markan and Matthean are broadly similar. Also, as is well known, the Lukan account is more divergent with the most striking feature being the use of two cups, one before (Luke 22,17) and one after (Luke 22,20) the breaking of bread (Luke 22,19)47. The second strand of eucharistic tradition is found in the Pauline letters (1 Cor 11,23-26). Within the synoptic accounts the meal is shared as part of the Passover ritual. Thus in Matthew’s Gospel, Jesus instructs his disciples to find a certain man and to inform him “I am to keep the Passover at your house with my disciples” (Matt 26,18). Similarly in Luke’s Gospel immediately prior to the sharing of the first cup, the Lukan Jesus declares, “I have earnestly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer” (Luke 22,15). As Fitzmyer notes, “[t]he Synoptic evangelists present that Last Supper as a Passover meal (Mark 14:1-2,12-17; Luke 22:1,7-14; Matt 26:2,5,17-20), and Luke more pronouncedly than the others”48. Within the synoptic tradition, the dominical saying identifies the bread with Jesus’ body (Mark 14,22) and the wine with Jesus’ blood. Moreover, the blood is further denoted as being covenantal in some sense and also representative, “this is my blood of the covenant which is poured out for many” (Mark 14,24). Matthew glosses Jesus’ words over 47. The Western text, principally represented in Codex Bezae, deletes the second cup in Luke 22,20. This shorter form is one of the so-called Western non-interpolations. 48. J.A. FITZMYER, The Gospel according to Luke X–XXIV (AB, 28A), New York, Doubleday, 1985, p. 1378.\n\nTHE IGNATIAN PROBLEM\n\n23\n\nthe cup to clarify that the blood poured out is “for forgiveness of sins” (Matt 26,28). Thus Matthew introduces more clearly the notion of blood poured out as a sacrificial and atoning act. The theme of the forgiving of sins is prominent in Matthew’s Gospel. Luz comments on the centrality of that theme by noting that, For Matthew the forgiveness of sins stands at the center of Jesus’ mission. Even his name indicated that he will save his people from their sins (1:21). … Once again we see here that the words of interpretation on the breaking of the bread and the cup are not merely parables that explain; they are a word of promise that permits the churches in the ritual of eating and drinking to share in the saving power of Jesus’ death49.\n\nHowever, the words “for forgiveness of sins” are also climactic within the gospel narrative. This redactional phrase unique to Matthew’s account, “underlines that the death of Jesus is soteriological, a deliverance from slavery to sin. The same words are omitted from 3.2 diff. Mk 1.4 … Matthew saves them for association with the covenant made through Jesus’ sacrificial death”50. Therefore, in the synoptic tradition the bread and the wine of the Passover meal are seen as representing, in some symbolic sense, the body and blood of Christ. Moreover, the blood of Christ which is figuratively represented by the Passover wine is seen as covenantal, it is representative in that it is offered on behalf of many, and according to Matthew it is soteriological in that it brings about forgiveness of sins. By contrast, in the Pauline account of the Last Supper the Passover link is not explicit. However, elsewhere in 1 Corinthians the Passover association with Christ is preserved, “for Christ our Passover has been sacrificed” (1 Cor 5,7). In common with the synoptic tradition, Paul makes the equation between the bread and the wine as representing the body and blood of Christ (1 Cor 11,24-25). Paul describes the words of institution over the bread as stating, “this is my body, which is for you” (1 Cor 11,24). In a fairly undefined sense the body of Christ, which the bread represents, is seen as benefitting the Corinthian believers and as being offered on their behalf51. Paul also presents the shared meal of bread and wine as being carried out in remembrance of Jesus. However, 49. U. LUZ, Matthew 21–28 (Hermeneia), Minneapolis, MN, Fortress, 2005, p. 381. 50. W.D. DAVIES – D.C. ALLISON, The Gospel according to Saint Matthew (ICC), vol. 3, Edinburgh, T&T Clark, 1997, p. 474. 51. Fee interprets this verse with even more precise theological significance. He states, “Paul surely understands this language regarding the bread as referring to Jesus’ body as given in death ‘in behalf of/in place of’ those who are now eating at the table”. G.D. FEE, The First Epistle to the Corinthians (The New International Commentary on the New Testament), rev. ed., Grand Rapids, MI, Eerdmans, 2014, p. 610.\n\n24\n\nP. FOSTER\n\nhe notion of “remembrance” transcends simple recall. As Fitzmyer notes, “[i]t is not merely a recollection of Jesus and what he did at his supper, but a representing of him and a re-enactment of his acts at the Last Supper for the conscious awareness of the Christians at Roman Corinth”52. Perhaps in a similar way, the statement that participation in the eucharistic meal means that one “proclaims the Lord’s death until he comes again” (1 Cor 11,26) entails more than historical memory. The eucharist connects Christ’s first coming with his second coming, by making Jesus present and empoweringly active among those who participate in the eucharistic meal53. In the New Testament, there is some theological reflection on the significance of the eucharist. However, despite the theological weight placed on both the synoptic accounts and the Pauline tradition, the theological inferences drawn by later authors and the explicit interpretations they provide are slight. The Paschal links are more prominent in the synoptic tradition. By contrast, the ideas of remembrance and proleptic preparation for the Parousia are key elements in the Pauline understanding of the eucharist. In distinction to the minimal theological reflection to be found in the New Testament on the significance of the Last Supper, in the writings of Ignatius one finds a more developed theological understanding of the eucharist. In fact, this theological development is one of Ignatius’ key theological contributions to the larger development of Christian thought. As Löhr observes, The Ignatian letters show a concept of the Christian meal celebration called “Thanksgiving” (εὐχαριστία) developed beyond that of the New Testament writings. The term (as in Did 9.1, 5) is to be understood as a metonym for the entire celebration. The letters also speak of “breaking-bread” (IgnEph 20.2), or simply of “God’s bread” (IgnEph 5.2; IgnRom 7.3)54.\n\nTherefore, in Ignatius’ writings, theological perspectives on the eucharist coalesce with his thought on ecclesiology and episcopacy. It is in the collective ecclesial gathering, overseen by the bishop, that the eucharistic meal is to be celebrated, and it is within that context according to Ignatius that the theological significance of the ritual meal is actualised. As 52. J.A. FITZMYER, First Corinthians (Anchor Yale Bible, 32), New Haven, CT, Yale University Press, 2008, p. 441. 53. As Barrett observes, “[t]he church as it met round the supper table would form a living link between the beginning at the end of the interim between the two comings of the Lord”. C.K. BARRETT, The First Epistle to the Corinthians (Black’s New Testament Commentary), London, A&C Black, 21971, p. 271. 54. LÖHR, The Epistles of Ignatius of Antioch (n. 28), p. 108.\n\nTHE IGNATIAN PROBLEM\n\n25\n\nSchoedel states, “[t]he eucharist is the center of worship for Ignatius (cf. Eph. 5.2; 13.1; Phd. 4; Smyr. 7.1; 8.1) and serves as the focus for the sense of saving power in the Christian community (cf. Eph. 20.2)”55. Discussing episcopal authority and leadership in his Letter to the Ephesians, Ignatius declares that anyone who is not in fellowship with the local bishop actually “lacks the bread of God” (Ign., Eph. 5,2). Here Ignatius links the concept of unity with the bishop to that of the efficacy of the eucharistic. It appears that behind this rhetoric Ignatius is calling into question the validity of the eucharistic meals of his opponents who did not recognise the authority of the local bishop. In a striking passage Ignatius attributes curative spiritual power to the eucharistic elements. He declares the act of “breaking one bread” to be “the medicine of immortality, the antidote we take in order not to die but to live forever in Jesus Christ” (Ign., Eph. 20,2). For Ignatius the antithesis of death is not simply life, but life in Jesus Christ. Therefore the eucharist is not simply a remedy against mortality, but it facilitates participation in the life of Jesus. While the related images of medicine and antidote suggest a mystical (if not even a magical) aspect within the healing imagery, the thought is perhaps more involved than simply asserting that partaking of the eucharist is a protective against mortality56. The protective aspect of the eucharist appears to be in Ignatius’ thought when he addresses the Trallians. In a somewhat fleeting aside Ignatius comments, “you, therefore, must arm yourselves with gentleness and regain your strength in faith (which is the flesh of the Lord) and in love (which is the blood of Jesus Christ)” (Ign., Trall. 8,1). The references to “the flesh of the Lord” and “the blood of Jesus Christ” in combination naturally evoke eucharistic perspectives. Here Ignatius declares “strength in faith” to be equivalent to “the flesh of the Lord”, and “love” as equivalent to “the blood of Jesus Christ”. He does not, however, explain the basis for these suggestive equivalencies that he presents. In many ways, Ignatius’ simply presents these pairs alongside each other as striking juxtapositions, without the need to explain the basis of the linkage57. A similar metaphor, or juxtaposition of bread and wine with other theological claims, occurs in the Letter to the Romans. In this context Ignatius states that “I want the bread of God, which is the flesh of Christ who is of the seed of David; and for drink I want his\n\n55. SCHOEDEL, Ignatius of Antioch (n. 11), p. 21. 56. According to Schoedel the imagery in this description “is generally taken to support a very ‘realistic’ (if not ‘magical’) conception of the sacrament”. Ibid., p. 97. 57. Ibid., p. 149.\n\n26\n\nP. FOSTER\n\nblood, which is incorruptible love” (Ign., Rom. 7,3). Here the focus appears more on another of Ignatius’ key theological concerns, rather than developing his eucharistic thought. That concern is arguing against a docetic Christology. This is achieved by equating the bread of God, with the flesh of Christ which in turn is identified with the Christ being from the seed of David. Hence the bread of God language affords Ignatius another opportunity to affirm the reality of Jesus’ Davidic descent and thus to present the reality of the incarnation. Writing to the Philadelphians, Ignatius again presents his concerns over unity in Christian communities. He sees that unity being achieved in a twofold manner – by participating in the “one eucharist”, and submitting oneself to the threefold ministry of bishop, presbyters and deacons. Thus he warns the Philadelphians: Take care, therefore, to participate in one eucharist (for there is one flesh of our Lord Jesus Christ, and one cup that leads to unity through his blood; there is one altar, just as there is one bishop, together with the council of presbyters and the deacons, my fellow servants), in order that whatever you do, you do it in accordance with God (Ign., Philad. 4,1).\n\nAlmost incidentally, Ignatius makes a number of affirmations concerning the eucharist. Although the bread is not explicitly mentioned, implicitly it is identified with the “flesh of our Lord Jesus Christ” and the eucharistic is explicitly seen as the container of the blood of Christ. The eucharist is to be celebrated in accordance with God, which as the parenthetical comment suggests is achieved when the eucharist is celebrated under the sanction of the local bishop. Thus as Vall observes, “Ignatius ties the eucharist very closely to the episcopal ministry”58. However, it is in the letter to the Smyrnaeans that the theology of the eucharist comes to the fore, and it is presented as a dividing issue between Ignatius and those whom he accuses of holding “heretical opinions about the grace of Jesus Christ”. These opponents are accused of refusing to participate in the eucharist because of their docetic Christology. Thus Ignatius declares, “[t]hey abstain from the eucharist and prayer because they refuse to acknowledge that the eucharist is the flesh of our saviour Jesus Christ” (Ign., Smyr. 6,2). In this key passage Ignatius unambiguously declares the eucharist to be the flesh of Christ, and concludes that his opponents refuse to participate in the eucharistic meals conducted by the local bishop because they deny the reality of the incarnation or enfleshment of Christ. Therefore, in this context “identifying 58. VALL, Learning Christ (n. 36), p. 306.\n\nTHE IGNATIAN PROBLEM\n\n27\n\nthe eucharistic flesh with Jesus’ historical flesh”59, Ignatius insists “on the strongest possible bond between the paschal mystery and the church’s sacramental life”60. Again it is in Smyrnaeans that the strongest statement is provided between the link of episcopal authority and the validity of the eucharistic meal. Ignatius states, “only that eucharist which is under the authority of the bishop (or whomever he himself designates) is to be considered valid” (Ign., Smyr. 8,1). Therefore, in the writings of Ignatius it is possible to trace a marked development and shift in eucharistic thought in comparison with the same topic as articulated in the New Testament. In the synoptic gospels the links with the Jewish Passover meal are far more prominent. By contrast, in Ignatius this aspect has disappeared. Moreover, the Pauline perspective that the eucharist is both preparation for and anticipation of the Parousia are also absent in Ignatian thought. For Ignatius, the eucharist is the central sacramental demonstration of the reality of Christ’s incarnation, and hence it rebuts the claims of his docetic opponents and explains their refusal to participate in the eucharistic meal. The reality of Christ’s flesh in the eucharist, according to Ignatius, negates their claims that Christ’s human appearance was only a mere semblance. Furthermore, the refusal to participate in a valid eucharist under the authority of the local bishop demonstrates the opponents’ refusal to accept the divinely ordered structure of the church in the pattern of bishops, presbyters and deacons. These are marked developments in theology from those eucharistic ideas to be found in the New Testament. Moreover, the ideas on the eucharist that occur in Ignatius’ writings are foundational for subsequent developments in regard to eucharistic theology at least till the time of the Reformation. Numerous theological developments are present in the middle recension, or earliest form of the letters of Ignatius in comparison with perspectives contained in the Pauline epistles, the synoptic gospels and the Johannine writings. In relation to eucharistic ideas, Ignatius’ writing presents ways of viewing the eucharist that are markedly different from the embryonic reflections contained in the accounts of the Last Supper and Paul’s description of the eucharist61. Even more significantly, the 59. Ibid., p. 323. 60. Ibid. 61. There have been attempts to find continuity between perspectives contained in the New Testament on the eucharist and the theological reflections of Ignatius. In this vein Pitre argues in relation to John 6,53-55 that Jesus’ words about eating his flesh and drinking his blood as the vehicle for resurrection and eternal life are aligned with Ignatius’ description of the bread and wine as “the medicine of immortality” (Ign., Eph. 20,2). Thus\n\n28\n\nP. FOSTER\n\nideas that Ignatius expresses around the eucharist became highly influential and formed the basis for much Christian theology on the sacramental nature of the eucharist. In relation to christological statements, Ignatius’ unambiguous affirmations of the divinity of Christ go beyond anything found explicitly in the Pauline letters, although there may be some closer theological alignment with Thomas’ confession in John 20,28. Similarly, Ignatius’ description of leadership roles shares some of the terminology found, in particular, in the Pastoral Epistles. However, the fixed threefold hierarchical pattern of leadership is an obvious development in comparison with anything found in the corpus of Pauline writings. Therefore, in the middle recension one may detect clear examples of theological development in important areas of Christian thought in comparison with ideas on the same topics to be found in writings from the Jesus movement that were written a generation or two prior to Ignatius.\n\nIV. THE THEOLOGICAL CONCERNS OF THE LONG RECENSION Remarkably little work has been undertaken on the long recension of the letters of Ignatius in its own right. Typically the discussion has focused on the relationship of the long recension to the other forms of the letter collection, with primary focus on demonstrating that the long recension is later than, and dependent upon the middle recension. Although Hannah argued that the long recension in the form of the interpolated versions of the seven letters of the middle recension came into existence in the second century (AD 135-155) as a response to Gnosticism62, this position is not defensible. As has been argued by others, and will be shown more fully below, the theological concerns of the long recension of Ignatius’ letters reflect the theological disputes of the second half of the fourth century. Specifically, the christological perspectives contained\n\nPitre argues, “Jesus’ teaching in the synagogue at Capernaum stands in continuity with the thought of Ignatius of Antioch. … We have here a textbook case of the teaching of Jesus in Capernaum being translated from an early Jewish key into the language of a more developed Gentile Christianity”. B. PITRE, Jesus and the Last Supper, Grand Rapids, MI, Eerdmans, 2016, pp. 426-427. Apart from the apparent conclusion that the Johannine discourse in John 6,53-55 represents the teachings of Jesus in Capernaum, it should also be noted that an actual eucharist is absent from the fourth gospel. Moreover, the points of verbal contact between the fourth gospel and Ignatius’ comments on the eucharist, in particular as the “medicine of immortality” are low. Therefore, it is difficult to detect the type of continuity that Pitre sees between the Gospel of John and the letters of Ignatius in regard to the eucharistic thought. 62. HANNAH, The Setting of the Ignatian Long Recension (n. 12).\n\nTHE IGNATIAN PROBLEM\n\n29\n\nin the long recension align with ultra-Arianism of the type found after the dissolution of the Nicene consensus. In particular, the christological viewpoints articulated by proponents of this extreme Arianism survive in the works of Eunomius, and to a lesser extent in the literary remains of works by Aëtius, and by Thallus63. The key claim of the extreme Arians, which brought adherents of this party into conflict with the then dominant semi-Arians, was there repudiation of the idea that the Son was of “like” (homoiousia) nature with the Father. The writings of Aëtius, the prime instigator of ultra-Arianism, on the topic of the incarnation survive in quotation or excerpts contained in the writings of his opponents. Epiphanius cites an isolated saying of Aëtius in the following form, “The Ingenerate [unbegotten] cannot be like the Generate [begotten]. Indeed they differ in name, the one is ‘ingenerate’, and the other, ‘generate’”64. This perspective, centring upon the fundamental difference between the natures of the Father and the Son, was the intractable point of division between the semi-Arians and the ultra-Arians. During the second half of the fourth century the inability of both parties to find a compromise between their views resulted in decades of bitter polemic. Ultimately, this led to reciprocal condemnations being issued. The semi-Arians condemned the ultra-Arians at the Council of Seleucia (359), and subsequently the ultra-Arians denounced the semiArians at the Council of Constantinople (360), and again at the Council of Antioch (360/361). The latter council held at Antioch demonstrates the strength of the ultra-Arian party in that location. It is possible that this might account, at least in part, for the reason for recasting the letters of Ignatius, the bishop of Antioch, to transform his Christology into one that provided support for the ultra-Arian christological views. By doing this, it both created an ancient pedigree for ultra-Arian views, and moreover it established Antioch as a place where the doctrine of the difference between the natures of the Father and the Son had been preserved since the beginnings of Christianity in one of the most prominent sees of the church. 63. There is some dispute concerning the correct terminology to name this group. The terms “Anomoenism” or “Anhomoian” were preferred by Simonetti. See M. SIMONETTI, La Crisi Ariana nel IV Secolo (Studia Ephemeridis Augustinianum, 11), Roma, Institutum Patristicum Augustinianum, 1975. However, Hanson prefers the term “Neo-Arian” because as he argues “Anhomoian” “is incorrect because the Neo-Arians on several occasions repudiated the view that the Son was, without qualification, ‘unlike (anhomoios) the Father’: this was an insulting label given to them by their opponents”.

Christological Perspectives of the Long Recension Without any shadow of doubt, it is the christological perspectives of the long recension of the letters of Ignatius that reflect the most thoroughgoing theological concern both in the interpolated passages added to the seven letters of the middle recension, and also in the text of the additional letters. Here that theological perspective will be illustrated in the seven interpolated letters by presenting both the form of the long and middle recensions synoptically. This will, perhaps, provide the most striking examples of the handiwork and the theological concerns of the compositor of the long recension. However, the thoroughgoing and sustained nature of these christological concerns will be further illustrated by citing passages from the additional letters (which obviously are unparalleled in the middle recension) in order to show how those same perspectives are carried over into the supplementary epistles that stand as part of the long recension stemming from the same author. Turning to a number of Ignatius’ semi-credal statements, it is immediately apparent how affirmations that attribute divinity to Jesus are removed or are radically rewritten. Moreover, there is a marked desire to show that Jesus was of a different οὐσία from the Father. Furthermore, within the long recension it is affirmed that while the λόγος existed before time, the Son was not co-eternal with the Father, and therefore was separable in nature and consequently distinguishable in substance from the Father who alone was the only true God. Ign., Eph. 7,2 Middle Recension\n\nIgn., Eph. 7,2 Long Recension\n\nThere is only one physician, who is both of flesh and spirit, both born and unborn, God in man, true life in death, both from Mary and from God; first subject to suffering and then beyond it, Jesus Christ our Lord.\n\nBut our Physician is the only true God, the unbegotten and unapproachable, the Lord of all, the Father and Begetter of the onlybegotten Son. We have also as a Physician the Lord our God, Jesus the Christ, the only-begotten Son and Word, before time began, but who afterwards became also man, of Mary the virgin. For “the word was made flesh”. Being incorporeal, He was in the body; being impassible, He was in a passible body; being immortal, He was in a mortal body; being life, He became subject to corruption, that He might free our souls from death and corruption, and heal them, and might restore them to health, when they were diseased with ungodliness and wicked lusts.\n\nTHE IGNATIAN PROBLEM\n\n31\n\nThere are some primary observations that are helpful in relation to the differences between the middle and long recensions. First, the long recension is more than triple the length of the middle recension. The long recension also cites the fourth gospel “the word was made flesh” (John 1,14), whereas the Gospel of John is never cited in the middle recension of the Ignatian letters65. In terms of the key medical image, whereas the middle recension declares there to be “only one physician” and identifies “Jesus Christ our Lord” as that person, the long recension makes a different and dual identification. The physician is “the only true God … the Father”. However, there is another who also serves as physician “the Lord our God, Jesus the Christ, the only-begotten Son and Word”. Therefore, the metaphor is changed from the image of one physician to that of two. While the Father, who is the primary physician, is described as “the only true God”, Jesus can nonetheless be described as “the Lord our God”. This does not cohere with the perspectives in the middle recension for this ascription of divinity is relativised through other qualifications in the semi-credal material of the long recension. The one described as “Son and Word” is “only-begotten”, but not in Nicene formulation eternally begotten. While affirming that he exists before time, the statement steers away from declaring him to be co-eternal with the Father. By affirming that the Son was begotten before time, the statement in the long recension avoids the crude notion of the Son being begotten at a point in time. Such ideas were attributed to Arius by those who wrote against him. Thus Socrates of Constantinople cites Arius as teaching, “[i]f the Father begat the Son, he that was begotten had a beginning of existence: and from this it is evident, that there was a time when the Son was not” (Socrates, Hist. Eccl. 1,5)66. Such a perspective is reported as the key error of Arius in multiple sources. Thus Alexander in his Deposition of Arius, lists Arius as the head of the list of the apostates, and attributes to him “novelties contrary to the scriptures” which include the following description of the Son, the Word of God: 65. It has been argued that for the middle recension “Ignatius’ use of the Fourth Gospel cannot be established with any degree of certainty”. P.

FOSTER\n\nThe Word of God was not always, but originated from things that were not; for God that is, has made him that was not, of that which was not; wherefore there was a time when He was not; for the Son is a creature and a work. Neither is He like in essence to the Father; neither is He the true and natural Word of the Father; neither is He His true Wisdom; but He is one of the things made and created, and is called the Word and Wisdom by an abuse of terms, since He Himself originated by the proper Word of God, and by the Wisdom that is in God, by which God has made not only all other things but Him also. Wherefore He is by nature subject to change and variation as are all rational creatures. And the Word is foreign from the essence of the Father, and is alien and separated therefrom. And the Father cannot be described by the Son, for the Word does not know the Father perfectly and accurately, neither can He see Him perfectly. Moreover, the Son knows not His own essence as it really is; for He is made for us, that God might create us by Him, as by an instrument; and He would not have existed, had not God wished to create us (Alexander, Deposition of Arius)67.\n\nTherefore, the rewritten material in the first semi-credal statement of the long recension of Ignatius’ Letter to the Ephesians (Ign., Eph. 7,2) does avoid the crudeness and the temporal limitation placed on the existence of the Word in the statements attributed to Arius in texts such as Alexander’s Deposition of Arius. However, while stating that the Word existed before time, and even affirming that Jesus could be designated by believers as “the Lord our God”, there is a clear tendency to separate the Son’s duration of existence (albeit outside of time) from that of the Father, and to separate the Son from the Father so that the incarnation of the Son could not transmit the corruption of being in the flesh back to the Father, who was understood to incorruptible because the substance of his being was beyond subjection to corruptibility. However, the statement affirms that the Son was like the Father in respect of them both acting as a physician for believers. Thus the Son was able to mediate the work of the Father to believers. However, according to the long form of this semi credal statement the Son was not eternally begotten, and hence was not co-eternal with the Father68. In the additional letters contained in the long recension, the christological views of the ultra-Arians find fuller expression. Thus, building on Ignatius’ anti-docetic rhetoric, the Letter to the Tarsians has Ignatius condemning the idea that Jesus is divine, an idea which one finds articulated clearly in the authentic letters. In Tarsians, the editor attributes the following words to Ignatius. 67. See Alexander, The Deposition of Arius, trans. M. ATKINSON (rev. A. ROBERTSON), in P. SCHAFF – H. WALLACE (eds.), Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers, second series, vol. 4, Buffalo, NY, Christian Literature Publishing Co, 1892, pp. 68-72. 68. See HANSON, The Search for the Christian Doctrine of God (n. 63), p. 634.\n\nTHE IGNATIAN PROBLEM\n\n33\n\nI have learned that certain of the ministers of Satan have wished to disturb you, some of them asserting that Jesus was born only in appearance, was crucified in appearance; others that he is not the Son of the creator, and others that he is himself God over all (Ign., Tarsians 2,1).\n\nThe editor skilfully presents in rapid sequence a number of statements that either Ignatius could have written against docetic opponents, or that represent opinions rejected by both Arian and Nicene Christians. Then as the climax to this sequence, the editor presents Ignatius as rejecting a view that stands at the heart of the christological views that the ultraArians rejected. Yet even here, the editor has presented the view of his opponents in an extreme form. He alludes to a group who state of the Son, “that he is himself God over all”. This representation of Nicene Christology presents a potential confusion between the person of the Son and the Father in such a fashion that makes the perspective akin to the theologically suspect views of modalism. 2. Ecclesiology and Episcopacy in the Long Recension In regard to church structures and leadership patterns and roles, there is much shared ground between the perspectives of Ignatius contained in the middle recension of his letters, and those of the editor of the long recension of the Ignatian corpus. The editor does provide a few additional theological reflections on the nature of the threefold pattern of ecclesial leadership, but in essence the long recension upholds Ignatius’ perspective of this topic. Ign., Trall. 2,2-3 Middle Recension\n\nIgn., Trall. 2,2-3 Long Recension\n\nIt is essential, therefore, that you continue your current practice and do nothing without the bishop, but be subject also to the council of the presbyters as to the apostles of Jesus Christ … Furthermore, it is necessary that those who are deacons of the mysteries of Jesus Christ please everyone in every respect. For they are not merely deacons of food and drink, but ministers of God’s church.\n\nIt is essential, therefore, that you continue your current practice and do nothing without the bishop, but be subject also to the council of the presbyters as to the apostles of Jesus Christ … Furthermore, it is fitting also, that in every way to please the deacons who are deacons of the mysteries of Christ Jesus. For they are not merely deacons of food and drink, but ministers of God’s church.\n\nThus, here one sees only minor changes in wording. In this way the long recension largely adheres to Ignatius’ own perspectives on the pattern and functions of the three offices of ministry.\n\n34\n\nP. FOSTER\n\nNotwithstanding this, within some of the additional letters of the long recension, the perspective on the various ecclesial leadership roles appears to reflect a more fully developed understanding of the functions of these offices, than is present in the descriptions of those roles as described in the middle recension. For example, in the letter addressed to the deacon Hero, the editor of the long recension has Ignatius instruct Hero in the following manner: Do nothing without the bishops; for they are priests, and you are a servant of the priests. They baptise, offer sacrifice, ordain, and lay on hands; but you minister to them, as the holy Stephen did at Jerusalem to James and the presbyters. Do not neglect the sacred meetings; inquire after every one by name. Let no man despise your youth, but be an example to believers both in word and deed (Ign., Hero 3,1).\n\nThe opening injunction resonates with instructions Ignatius gives in the authentic epistles of the middle recension69. However, after this, the contents betray a later period and reflect a more developed understanding of leadership roles. Bishops are called priests, and a list of sacred duties is given. The offering of sacrifice most likely reflects a sacrificial understanding of the eucharist. Deacons are more explicitly seen as subservient to the bishop and to the presbyters. The role of deacon appears to involve taking an attendance register in the regular meetings, something not mentioned in the middle recension of the letters of Ignatius. Therefore, there is no concern to contradict or correct Ignatius’ theological perspectives on ecclesiology and episcopacy as contained in the middle recension. Notwithstanding this, there are some anachronistic descriptions of the functions of these ecclesial roles, which reveal that the perspectives expressed do not originate from the first half of the second century, but from a significantly later period. 3. Eucharistic Thought in the Long Recension While the long recension has been recognised as deviating from the christological perspectives articulated in the middle recension of Ignatius’ letters, little attention has been focused on the way the eucharistic thought of the middle recension is handled and evolves in the long recension70. In order to consider Ignatius’ eucharistic thought in the long 69. See Ign., Magn. 7,1. “So you must do nothing without the bishop and the presbyters”. 70. One partial consideration of this issue was discussed in a recent SBL paper. T. FLEMMING, The Meal in the Letters of Ignatius: Textual Variants as Evidence for Transforming Practice and Theology, SBL Annual Meeting, Denver, CO, 17 Nov 2018,\n\nTHE IGNATIAN PROBLEM\n\n35\n\nrecension it is again helpful to place passages from the interpolated forms of the seven letters of the long recension in parallel with the relevant passages in the middle recension. In Philadelphians, the eucharistic material as it is rewritten in the long recension is modified in two major ways. First, it is recast in such a manner that it is no longer presented as protective adv"
