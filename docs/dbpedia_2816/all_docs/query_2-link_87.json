MANY CHRISTOLOGIES, MANY CHRISTIANITIES? Whether one asks, ‘Quid sit christianum esse?’ or explores ‘das Wesen des Christentums,’ the question, ‘What is Christianity?’ looms over scholarly investigations on the origins of Christianity as well as studies on its expansion and doctrinal development in the early centuries. 1 The question of early Christian identity has been asked and answered in a variety of ways by scholars from various confessional and presuppositional backgrounds. Yet the search for an ‘essence’ of Christianity—or the rejection of such an essence— that will satisfactorily explain both unity and diversity in the earliest centuries remains elusive, as the answers to the question are nearly as numerous as the scholars who ask it.\n\nTHE CONTEXT OF THE QUESTION In the last decade of the twentieth century, Arland Hultgren described four twentieth-century approaches to the issue of continuity from Jesus to early Christianity. The first, or ‘traditional view,’ is the model of a true apostolic doctrine that preceded heresy, that is, ‘after the death of the apostles, evil and crafty persons perverted the teachings of the Lord and his apostles.’ 2 The See Adolf von Harnack, What Is Christianity? trans. Thomas Bailey Saunders, 2d rev. edn (New York: Putnam’s Sons, 1903). 2 Arland J. Hultgren, The Rise of Normative Christianity (Minneapolis: Fortress, 1994), 8. Hultgren ties this view to not only Eusebius, Tertullian, and Hegesippus but also to Clement of Rome and even Paul himself. This view is often associated with a confessional historiography, but see Simone Pétrement, Le Dieu séparé: les origines du gnosticisme (Paris: Cerf, 1\n\n1\n\n2\n\nTHE CENTER AND THE SOURCE\n\nsecond view is illustrated by the ‘Bauer Thesis,’ that ‘in many geographical areas of antiquity that which would be called “heresy” at later times was actually the original manifestation of Christianity.’ 3 Thus, in this model, heresy preceded orthodoxy. Hultgren associated the third model with the work of H. E. W. Turner and the interaction of ‘fixed and flexible elements’ in the development of orthodoxy. 4 The final model is that of Robinson and Koester, with their dynamic theory of diverse trajectories developing simultaneously from the beginning and never coalescing, but rather fragmenting into distinct Christianities. 5 Today, statements like Lyman’s have become common: ‘Revisions of our understanding of ancient culture and religious identity must … prompt re-evaluations of our assumptions concerning the history of Christian identity and theology.’ 6 Historians have appealed to modern studies on self-definition, rhetoric, and polemics of various social, philosophical, religious, and political groups in Greco-Roman antiquity as new lenses through which one can better understand ancient Christian selfdefinition. They often argue that early Christians’ understanding of their own identity was not distinct or stable until at least the late 1984).\n\nHultgren, The Rise of Normative Christianity, 9. The original German publication was Walter Bauer, Rechtgläubigkeit und Ketzerei im ältesten Christentum, Beitrage zur historischen Theologie, vol. 10 (Tübingen: Mohr Siebeck, 1934). This work—and its own legacy—will be discussed below, pp. 9–11. 4 Hultgren, The Rise of Normative Christianity, 14. See the original work in H. E. W. Turner, The Pattern of Christian Truth: A Study in the Relations between Orthodoxy and Heresy in the Early Church (London: Mowbray, 1954). 5 James M. Robinson and Helmut Koester, Trajectories through Early Christianity (Philadelphia: Fortress, 1971). The same theories of diversity and conflict can be seen in more recent and popular books like Bart D. Ehrman, Lost Christianities: The Battles for Scripture and the Faiths We Never Knew (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2003); Elaine Pagels, The Gnostic Gospels (New York: Random House, 1978). 6 Rebecca Lyman, ‘Hellenism and Heresy: 2002 NAPS Presidential Address,’ Journal of Early Christian Studies 11 (2003): 212. 3\n\n1. MANY CHRISTOLOGIES, MANY CHRISTIANITIES?\n\n3\n\nsecond century. 7 Rather than identifying a coalition of Christian communities centered on a shared tradition about Jesus, more and more scholars speak of many christologies and many Christianities in early Christian history. Indeed, the study of the second century church seems to have become a study in dichotomies: continuity and discontinuity, fixed and flexible, central and marginal, unity and diversity, orthodoxy and heresy. In the storm of ideas that have contributed to the scholarly debates concerning the rise of catholic Christianity, 8 two names have risen to the fore, and scholars in the last century have had to take their foundational works into account. Regardless of how historians position themselves in relationship to these scholars, the legacies of Adolf von Harnack and Walter Bauer have established the course along which—and the context within which—scholarly discussions on catholic Christian development and identity take place today. 9 It is therefore within the streams of Dunn writes, ‘The history of Christianity between 70 and 180 is much more complex … than has traditionally been thought. … The historical reality was evidently much more of a tension and struggle between competing ideas/faiths/practices than the disputed but apparently irresistible emergence of the great church with a clearly defined rule of faith and clearly defined structures’ (James D. G. Dunn, Neither Jew nor Greek: A Contested Identity, Christianity in the Making, vol. 3 [Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 2015], 40). 8 I use the term ‘catholic Christianity’ to refer to those local communities of Christians that maintained some degree of unity and amicable relationships with other communities in various parts of the empire. As will be shown in this study, the intersecting network of Christian communities that made up this web of catholicity in the first several decades of the second century maintained their relationships through personal visits, correspondence, and jointly sponsored tasks or missions. The nature of this unity will be the focus of this study. 9 See Alain Le Boulluec, La notion d’hérésie dans la littérature grecque, IIe– IIIe siècles (Paris: Etudes augustiniennes, 1985), 13–20; Gerd Lüdemann, Primitive Christianity: A Survey of Recent Studies and Some New Proposals, trans. John Bowden (London: T. & T. Clark, 2003), 5–6; Robert L. Wilken, ‘Diversity and Unity in Early Christianity,’ Second Century 1 (1981): 101. 7\n\n4\n\nTHE CENTER AND THE SOURCE\n\nscholarly tradition since Harnack and Bauer that the questions of definition and self-identity in early catholic Christianity must be asked and answered. The Legacy of Harnack In his second volume of History of Dogma, Adolf von Harnack pointed to three foundations of the ‘catholic church’: ‘an “apostolic” law of faith, a collection of “apostolic” writings, and finally, an “apostolic” organisation.’ 10 Harnack’s inclusion of quotation marks around ‘apostolic’ should not be ignored, for he argued that although later catholic writers affirmed that these elements had first-generation apostolic origins, in fact the concrete of these foundations was poured and hardened throughout the second century. 11 Harnack wrote, ‘In opposition to Gnosticism and Marcionitism, the main articles forming the estate and possession Regarding Harnack’s influence on twentieth studies on the origins of catholic Christianity, see Jarolsav Pelikan, Historical Theology: Continuity and Change in Christian Doctrine (New York: Corpus, 1971), 58–67. 10 Adolf von Harnack, History of Dogma, trans. Neil Buchanen, vol. 2 (London: Williams & Norgate, 1910), 1. Harnack did not entirely invent the convenient threefold pillars of catholic orthodoxy himself, but confirmed these as the definition of catholic Christianity in modern scholarship. These three foundations already appeared in late second century defenses of the catholic faith in writers such as Irenaeus, Tertullian, and others (see Tertullian, De praescriptione haereticorum 21–39; Iren. Adv. haer. 1.1.15). Yet prior to Harnack, these threefold marks of the identity of catholic Christianity were difficult to find in such simple terms. So, for example, Philip Schaff discussed the development of the episcopacy, the canon, and the rule of faith through the second and third centuries, but regarded these as developments within apostolic Christianity, not necessarily as the three identifying marks of a new and distinct ‘catholic Christianity’ (Philip Schaff, History of the Christian Church, 2d rev. edn, vol. 2, Ante-Nicene Christianity, A.D. 100–325 [New York: Scribner’s, 1916]). Also see Ernest Renan, The History of the Origins of Christianity, Comprising the Reigns of Hadrian and Antoninus Pius (A.D. 117– 161) [London: Mathieson, 1888], iii–iv). 11 Harnack, What Is Christianity?, 206–8.\n\n1. MANY CHRISTOLOGIES, MANY CHRISTIANITIES?\n\n5\n\nof orthodox Christianity were raised to the rank of apostolic regulations and laws, and thereby placed beyond all discussion and assault.’ 12 Harnack placed this ‘fixing of the tradition under the title of apostolic’ as the result of the conflicts between the free and independent spirit that marked primitive Christianity and the structures of doctrine and institutions of later Hellenized Christianity, which conflicts raged throughout the second century. 13 Yet Harnack argued that the emergent catholic identity of the second century never in fact clearly defined what it meant to be ‘Christian.’ That catholic Christian identity developed in reaction to the threat of Gnosticism in the second century was presupposed in Harnack’s history of dogma: The conflict with Gnosticism made it necessary to find some sort of solution to the question, ‘What is Christian?’ and to fix this answer. But indeed the Fathers were not able to answer the question confidently and definitely. They therefore made a selection from tradition and contented themselves with making it binding on Christians. 14\n\nThe ‘fixing of the tradition,’ according to Harnack, corresponded with the establishment of the collection of apostolic writings. 15 Thus, in Harnack’s model of early Christian history, ‘catholic Christianity’ and, indeed, catholic self-identity, developed in reaction to forces of acute Hellenization—especially Gnosticism and the Marcionites—that threatened to take Christianity too far from its Jewish and Old Testament roots. Thus, catholic selfidentity did not find clear expression apart from the rise of the primitive Christian canon of apostolic Scripture, the consistent ‘rule of faith,’ and the establishment of ecclesiastical structures and authority, which elements coalesced into a clear catholic identity only near the end of the second century with figures like Irenaeus, Tertullian, and Hippolytus (see Figure 1). 16 Harnack, History of Dogma, 1. Ibid., 2. 14 Ibid., 8. 15 Ibid., 8, note 7. 16 Ibid., 9. 12 13\n\n6\n\nTHE CENTER AND THE SOURCE Figure 1: Adolf von Harnack’s development of catholic Christian identity Canon Creed Cathedra\n\nPeriod of Confusion 50\n\nA.D.\n\nPeriod of Controversy 100\n\nPeriod of Clarity 150\n\n200\n\nWith these first theologians of late second century catholic Christianity Harnack associated the centrality of the doctrine of the incarnation. He wrote: But in yet another respect Irenaeus and Hippolytus denote an immense advance beyond the Apologists, which, paradoxically enough, results both from the progress of Christian Hellenism and from a deeper study of the Pauline theology, that is, emanates from the controversy with Gnosticism. In them a religious and realistic idea takes the place of the moralism of the Apologists, namely, the deifying of the human race through the incarnation of the Son of God. The apotheosis of mortal man through his acquisition of immortality (divine life) is the idea of salvation which was taught in the ancient mysteries. It is here adopted as a Christian one, supported by the Pauline theology (especially as contained in the Epistle to the Ephesians), and brought into the closest connection with the historical Christ, the Son of God and Son of man (filius dei et filius hominis). 17\n\nSo, in Harnack’s model of the rise of catholic Christianity, even as late as the middle of the second century, Christian churches still 17\n\nIbid., 10–11.\n\n1. MANY CHRISTOLOGIES, MANY CHRISTIANITIES?\n\n7\n\ngrasped for a clear sense of catholic identity. 18 Yet Harnack acknowledged that something had to have distinguished Christians from non-Christians before that time. What was it that united Christians in the early decades before the rise of catholic Christianity? Harnack answered, ‘There was a time when the majority of Christians knew themselves to be such, (1) because they had the “Spirit” and found in that an indestructible guarantee of their Christian position, (2) because they observed all the commandments of Jesus.’ 19 Thus, the subjective experience of the Spirit, described elsewhere as the ‘warmth and spontaneity’ of the Christian religious life, 20 and the objective observance of the logia of Jesus were the earliest loose standards of Christian self-identity. One can see, given these vague and subjective definitional centers, that such an association of communities would have been open to fragmentation through diversity and conflict. In sum, Harnack’s construction of the rise of catholic Christianity and its relationship to incarnational christology involved a central incarnational idea that grew out of the conflicts of the middle and late second century, expressed most forcefully in turn-of-the-century fathers like Irenaeus and Hippolytus, which eventually supplanted competing concepts of Christian identity. This centering of catholic dogma coincided with the coronation of the ‘apostolic’ triumvirate of canonical Scripture, the creedal rule of faith, and the ordained ecclesiastical offices. Since Harnack, scholars have continued to define catholic Christianity—and thus identify its emergence—with the crystallization of these three pillars of canon, creed, and cathedra. 21 Harnack pointed to Justin in the middle of the second century as ‘he who began the great literary struggle for the expulsion of heterodoxy … but, judging from those writings of his that have been preserved to us, it seems very unlikely that he was already successful in finding a fixed standard for determining orthodox Christianity’ (ibid., 24). 19 Ibid., 25. 20 Ibid. 21 Von Campenhausen’s notes, ‘The concept, which Harnack popularised, of “Early Catholicism” is characterised by the validity of three constitutive norms—Bible, Creed, and Episcopate. It is, however, a 18\n\n8\n\nTHE CENTER AND THE SOURCE\n\nIn the first issue of the journal Second Century, Outler reprinted an article originally published in 1968, in which he noted: The mid-second century is a crepuscular zone for the Christian community, with undisciplined experiments in liturgy, polity and doctrine going on all over the place, with ‘heresy’ preceding and outpacing ‘orthodoxy,’ with ‘catholic Christianity’ ‘developing’ but by no means yet shaped or firm in its faith and order. The rudiments of a baptismal symbol, a canon of Scripture and a catholic polity are all there—in nuclear fragments—but the course of their development is still highly contingent. 22\n\nThis same identification of the three sine qua non of catholic Christianity has become rather common and is virtually unchallenged, though variously stated and sometimes more carefully nuanced. 23 Because these three pillars are clearly found misleading abstraction which in no way corresponds to the selfunderstanding of the early Church. Even in later antiquity there is not a single text known to me which links these three things as normative’ (Hans von Campenhausen, The Formation of the Christian Bible, trans. J. A. Baker [Philadelphia: Fortress, 1972], 329). Interestingly, Ritter notes that the notion of Harnack’s three norms ‘had been common’ until Campenhausen’s criticism, and that Campenhausen’s research on confession, the canon, and ecclesiastical law had been more or less wellreceived by scholarship (Adolf M. Ritter, ‘ “Orthodoxy,” “Heresy” and the Unity of the Church in pre-Constantinian Times,’ Studia patristica 24 [1993]: 322–27). Nevertheless, the tendency to continue defining catholic Christianity by the three norms persists, as I demonstrate below, note 23. 22 Albert C.

MANY CHRISTOLOGIES, MANY CHRISTIANITIES?\n\n9\n\nfunctioning together only near the end of the second century, many historians date the most reasonable terminus a quo for the rise of a distinct catholic Christian identity in the late second century. 24 The Legacy of Bauer In 1934 Walter Bauer published his now legendary thesis that certain forms of Christianity that the church later regarded as ‘heresies’ were originally not distinguished as such but were in some places the earlier and stronger forms of Christianity while the form that eventually identified itself as orthodox catholic Christianity was sometimes a later minority (see Figure 2). 25 Such diverse forms of Christianity were necessarily characterized by diverse christological narratives. The general validity of the Bauer thesis was mostly accepted by peer reviewers in Germany immediately after its 1934 publication. 26 Though many scholars Louth, vol. 1 (Crestwood, NY: St. Vladimir’s Seminary Press, 2007), 189; John Knox, The Early Church and the Coming Great Church (New York: Abingdon, 1955), 101–29; Hans Lietzmann, A History of the Early Church, trans.

Today, there\n\n10\n\nTHE CENTER AND THE SOURCE\n\nhave disagreed with Bauer’s evidences, arguments, and answers concerning the development of orthodoxy and heresy, 27 they have generally agreed that the traditional view was untenable and that early Christianity was characterized even by ‘radical diversity.’ 28 Several scholars since have sought to confirm and strengthen many of Bauer’s assertions. 29\n\nare few scholars who would actually defend ‘the Bauer thesis’ as it originally stood in 1934. However, the basic thesis that the early church was characterized by diversity and conflict, and that ‘orthodoxy’ was merely one of many developing and competing forms of Christianity, is widely accepted. This emphasis on diversity and conflict in earliest Christianity can still generally be termed ‘the Bauer thesis.’ 27 The most thorough critiques of Bauer’s thesis include Thomas A.

On one end of the spectrum non-confessional scholars may speak of diverse Christianities, christologies, and churches that competed for converts or waged a war of words as traditions vied for dominance. On the other end confessional scholars may refer to an original Christianity versus secondary schismatics, the true christology versus false christs, and the one catholic church versus heretical sects. Though few historians would want to be chained to either of these two poles, these outer limits represent two tendencies toward which scholars may lean in their historiographic portrayals of the early church. Therefore, between these two poles lies the broad field on which historians of various confessions, presuppositions, and methodological approaches ask and answer questions on the origins of catholic Christianity. In the wake of Harnack’s developmental model of catholic Christianity as coalescing in the late second century and Bauer’s thesis of later catholic orthodoxy arising from diverse and competing movements, it becomes clear that the old model of an early, distinctive, and strong sense of catholic identity has been all but replaced by an array of ‘many christologies’ and ‘many Christianities’ that preceded the rise of one orthodox christology and one catholic Christianity.\n\n12\n\nTHE CENTER AND THE SOURCE\n\nContemporary Scholarly Tendencies Since Harnack and Bauer, the twentieth and twenty-first century scholarly investigations of early catholic identity have taken a number of approaches to both the questions and the answers. The various presuppositions, methods, and models are rarely mutually exclusive. Rather, they overlap and intersect in many historiographical treatments of the rise of catholic Christianity. A brief illustrative survey of some of the major tendencies follows. For many scholars, the question of Christian identity is often related specifically to Christianity’s separation from Judaism, or its transformation from a Jewish messianic sect to a distinct religion with its own separate rituals, beliefs, and structures. 30 This is often associated in some form with the Hellenization of an original Jewish Christianity and a new identity based on Hellenistic changes in doctrine and practice. This has led to explorations of not only the social factors involved in such a split between two parties, but the cultural influences that would have precipitated the parting of the ways between an originally Jewish to an increasingly Gentile order. 31 Another significant tendency is the study of conflict in establishing and maintaining religious identity. 32 R.

MANY CHRISTOLOGIES, MANY CHRISTIANITIES?\n\n13\n\nexample, suggested that the emergence of Christian self-definition should be understood as ‘born of the “crisis of identity” precipitated by the encounter between Christian and “gnostic” movements. In its essentials this phase in the crystallization of Christian self-consciousness was completed by about 200 CE.” 33 He therefore explicitly downplays internal and traditional christological considerations as constituting the self-identity of early Christians. 34 Along these same lines, Virginia Burrus notes, ‘It is now generally acknowledged that the second-century gnostic controversy provided the context for the earliest crystallization of a Christian orthodoxy.’ 35 Keith Hopkins paints this picture in vivid hues: ‘Christianity started as a tiny and embattled sect, surrounded by enemies. The perceived hostility of Jews and pagans to Christians, and the complementary hostility of Christians to their enemies, were fundamental ingredients in early Christian identity.’ 36 And though Hopkins acknowledges that Christianity was a ‘religion of belief,’ he notes, ‘Correct belief was forged in conflict with dissident insiders.’ 37 This ‘model of struggle’ has become a common paradigm for understanding the process of identity formation that began in the first century and continued throughout the establishment of orthodoxy and catholic Christianity. As such, methods of rhetorical criticism have displaced exegesis as a major tool for interpreting texts. Often applying a ‘hermeneutic of suspicion,’ many scholars have discerned motives among early Christian leaders of increasing\n\nR. A.

Also see the similar approach in Mark Edwards, Catholicity and Heresy in the Early Church (New York: Routledge, 2009). 33\n\n14\n\nTHE CENTER AND THE SOURCE\n\necclesiastical power rather than defending inspired doctrines. 38 Hultgren summarizes the present scholarly perspective thusly: Our picture of early Christianity is one of many competing, disembodied voices represented in the New Testament and other early Christian literature. And … there is a widely held view that the triumph of orthodoxy was a rather late and even highhanded achievement of ecclesiastical leaders representing one strand, however diverse that strand was, who appealed to apostolic tradition to give legitimacy to their own position. 39\n\nHowever, Hultgren’s response to this model of diversity and conflict should force us to return to the actual texts and ask whether it was power and personalities that were of primary interest, or whether the power struggles were themselves the effects of the clash of serious theological controversies: One cannot exclude from consideration the presence of struggles for power between parties and personalities in the shaping of that tradition. But the penchant for leaving the matter at that in some quarters of modern scholarship is reductionistic. The primary struggle was the struggle for the truth of the gospel (right confession of faith) and community life congruent with it. Inevitably, the normative-orthodox tradition and its alternatives had to go their separate ways. 40\n\nThe result is that today the diversity and conflict model of early Christian origins is virtually presupposed in the relevant literature.\n\nFrances Young notes, ‘Suspicion of received accounts is characteristic of the historico-critical method. … No longer can we give an account of the Church of the Fathers as if there were from the beginning a pristine orthodoxy from which heretics diverged. Though it has sometimes sat a little uneasily with faith commitments, we owe much to modern suspicion’ (‘From Suspicion and Sociology to Spirituality: On Method, Hermeneutics and Appropriation with Respect to Patristic Material,’ Studia patristica 29 [1997]: 421). 39 Hultgren, The Rise of Normative Christianity, 21. 40 Ibid., 104. 38\n\n1. MANY CHRISTOLOGIES, MANY CHRISTIANITIES?\n\n15\n\nFor several scholars, though, identity is seen as an association with a particular pattern of social structures: the rites, rituals, customs, and practices of a group. 41 In the case of the early Christians, scholars may point to practices like baptism, the Eucharist, and a life that imitates Christ as external markers that helped establish a particular Christian identity, without denying confessional content as well. 42 In the final paragraph of his book, Hopkins writes,\n\nSociological approaches to the identity of Christianity arise from and are informed by similar studies of religion in general (ibid., 19–23). See Gerardus van der Leeuw, Religion in Essence and Manifestation (New York: Harper and Row, 1963); Arthur D. Nock, ‘The Historical Importance of Cult Associations,’ Classical Review 38 (1924): 105–9; John E. Stambaugh and David L. Balch, The Social World of the First Christians (London: SPCK, 1986); Joachim Walch, Sociology of Religion (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1944). For an extensive account of studies in the social history of early Christianity, see Lüdemann, Primitive Christianity, 61–81. 42 Samuel Byrskog, ‘A New Quest for the Sitz im Leben: Social Memory, the Jesus Tradition and the Gospel of Matthew,’ New Testament Studies 52 (2006): 335; Martin Elze, ‘Häresie und Einheit der Kirche im 2.

Koester emphasizes a unified morality as an identityforging norm for at least some early Christian communities (Helmut Koester, ‘The Apostolic Fathers and the Struggle for Christian Identity,’ in The Writings of the Apostolic Fathers, ed. Paul Foster [London: T. & T. Clark, 2007], 1–12). In Koester’s approach, the person and work of Christ has almost no bearing on the establishment of Christian identity of at least most of Christian communities represented by the literature of the late first and early second centuries. These communities were ‘not just moral and pious but also concerned with principles of love nad mutual care, hospitality and concern for the poor, widows and orphans, and ritual that would bind the communities together in common celebration’ (ibid., 10– 11). 41\n\n16\n\nTHE CENTER AND THE SOURCE What gave Christians a sense of common identity was the hymn-singing and prayers, the moralising sermons explaining half-familiar texts, and the eucharist of bread and wine for the elect; plus, every year, the humbling initiation of new Christians through repeated exorcisms and naked baptism. … For most, being a Christian may have mattered even more than believing. 43\n\nUnder the umbrella of sociological approaches to the study of early Christianity, other scholars have pointed to the early Christians’ use of common ideas about race and ethnicity in establishing identity in contradistinction to other ‘races’ such as Jews and Greeks, often delineating various categories of ethnic identity to define Christianity as a distinct and superior ‘race.’ 44 Such an approach skirts issues of doctrine and belief as definitional forces, as Buell notes: ‘Paying attention to ethnic reasoning helps us reconstruct the diversity among early Christian thinking and practices without recourse to problematic frameworks like orthodoxy, heterodoxy, and heresy.’ 45 Another approach, functioning within a post-colonial interpretation of the sources, focuses on authoritative discourse as establishing early Christian identity. For example, with regard to the issue of the decline in ecstatic prophecy and the rise of catholic authority in early Christianity, Laura Nasrallah makes the following comment about the texts of Paul, Tertullian, and Epiphanius: ‘While engaging in a debate about prophecy, these texts contest who has access to the divine and to divine knowledge, and who has authority to define the identity of a community.’ 46 In such a view, a Hopkins, A World Full of Gods, 335. See, for example, Denise Kimber Buell, ‘Race and Universalism in Early Christianity,’ Journal of Early Christian Studies 10 (2002): 429–68; Aaron P. Johnson, ‘Identity, Descent, and Polemic: Ethnic Argumentation in Eusebius’ Praeparatio Evangelica,’ Journal of Early Christian Studies 12 (2004): 23–56. 45 Buell, ‘Race and Universalism in Early Christianity,’ 468. 46 Laura Salah Nasrallah, ‘An Ecstasy of Folly’: Prophecy and Authority in Early Christianity, Harvard Theological Studies, ed. François Bovon, 43 44\n\n1. MANY CHRISTOLOGIES, MANY CHRISTIANITIES?\n\n17\n\nclear and distinct Christian identity cannot be wrought apart from the hammer and anvil of authoritative text and authoritative teacher. This approach regards a fully catholic Christian identity as impossible without a broadly received canon and well established ecclesiastical offices. So, catholic Christian identity is viewed as having manifested itself only with the establishment of canon and authority at the end of the second century and into the third century. Though methodologically distinct, this model does not move much beyond Harnack’s three pillars of catholic Christianity. The new trio of knowledge, power, and authority becomes an epistemological and sociological triumvirate and the actual doctrines of the early Christians are regarded as having secondary relevance. Prior to these structures and discourses Christianity would have consisted of competing and conflicting sources of authority with few common characteristics. What would eventually become ‘catholic Christianity’ was originally one of many traditions vying for dominance—a conclusion in keeping with Bauer’s original thesis. 47 In sum, modern contemporary approaches to the rise of catholic identity often find themselves within the field of sociology and its various models. The methodologies involved in these approaches differ sometimes dramatically from approaches that attempt to place development of catholic Christianity in the context of theological development or confessional identity, that is, in the context of orthodoxy and heresy. Indeed, any approach to the study of Christian origins in which social formation models are primary ‘resists essentialisms and the static and determinative relationships between thought and practice that result from them. … Thus discourse becomes less an implicit “expression” of what society is and what its members do think, than it is a description of\n\nElisabeth Schüssler Fiorenza, and Peter B. Machinist, vol. 52 (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 2003), 5. 47 See Birger Albert Pearson, The Emergence of Christian Religion: Essays on Early Christianity (Harrisburg, PA: Trinity Press International, 1997), 185.\n\n18\n\nTHE CENTER AND THE SOURCE\n\nor an argument for what society should be and what should be thought.’ 48 In short, a sociological approach sometimes finds itself at odds with confessional approaches to early Christian history. For example, in an article that seeks to offer an alternative to ‘models of Christianization that are premised primarily on notions of ideological persuasion,’ Chad Kile comments on the ‘ahistorical insistence on an extrahistorical Christian essence as the motivating factor in Christian affiliation’ which ‘makes Christian adherence primarily a matter of ideological consent and places the burden of understanding the process of (effective) Christianization on the successful transmission of doctrinal material through persuasion at the level of ideas, concepts, and creeds.’ 49 Kile thus relegates the theological content of Christianity and its role in establishing Christian identity as functions of Christian socialization rather than its primary motivation. In light of this overview of the scholarly context, it would be easy to get lost in the jungles of contemporary methodologies and to direct attention to dismantling the theories or presuppositions that undergird these methodologies. Though this is a necessary pursuit, it is not mine. I have provided a general and perhaps overly simplified sampling of current trends in explaining identity formation in early catholic Christianity. Though these vary, they often result in the same general conclusion about the nature of early Christian history as constituted by many christologies and many Christianities. Burton Mack describes what he regards as a growing consensus of scholarship regarding the rise of Christianity: The picture coming into view is that of many different configurations of groups and movements that appealed to Jesus as their founder. We now refer to the Jesus schools, the Christ cults, the Pauline churches, Thomas Christianity, the Chad Kile, ‘Feeling Persuaded: Christianization as Social Formation,’ in Rhetoric and Reality in Early Christianity, ed. Willi Braun, Studies in Christianity and Judaism, ed. Stephen G. Wilson, vol. 16 (Waterloo, Ontario: Wilfrid Laurier University Press, 2005), 228. 49 Ibid., 220–21. 48\n\n1. MANY CHRISTOLOGIES, MANY CHRISTIANITIES?\n\n19\n\nJohannine enclaves, Jewish-Christian communities, GnosticChristian groups, the Pauline school, and others as distinct and particular configurations of social experimentation in the first centuries. … Despite their common appeal to Jesus as founder, these groups are very difficult to comprehend as variants of a common persuasion or as cells within a single social network, i.e., ‘the church.’ 50\n\nTHE NEED FOR THIS STUDY As part of the ongoing scholarly discussions regarding catholic selfdefinition and models of unity and diversity in early Christianity, this book will focus on the role of the incarnational christological narrative as the essential, conscious, and intentional doctrinal norm of early catholic identity. 51 The Role of Christology in Early Catholic Self-Definition If one were to accept the common scholarly definition of catholic Christianity as a harmonious trio consisting of a discernible canon of Scripture, stable rule of faith, and authoritative episcopacy, the common date for the emergence of catholic Christianity around the end of the second century would fit the evidence. 52 The question, Burton L. Mack, ‘Many Movements, Many Myths: Redescribing the Attractions of Early Christianities,’ Religious Studies Review 25 (1999): 133. 51 By ‘identity,’ I do not mean an individual’s personal sense of identity, which can and does change with the various social functions and roles of the individual. Rather, I refer to social identity, ‘the identity based on belonging to a particular and defined group’ (Horrell, ‘Becoming Christian,’ 312). This is a voluntary membership to a particular group ‘based on commitment to beliefs and a community that shares those same beliefs’ (Hultgren, The Rise of Normative Christianity, 19). 52 Jürgen Becker (Das Urchristentum als gegliederte Epoche, Stuttgarter Bibelstudien, vol. 155 [Stuttgart: Verlag Katholisches Bibelwerk, 1993], 377) suggests the period of transition from a diverse ‘primitive Christianity’ to the more unified ‘early church’ occurred between 120 and 130 CE. Henning Paulsen (‘Zur Wissenschaft vom Urchristentum und der alten Kirche—ein methodischer Versuch,’ Zeitschrift für die Neutestamentliche 50\n\n20\n\nTHE CENTER AND THE SOURCE\n\nhowever, is whether such a definition accurately reflects the definition of earlier catholic Christians themselves. Is it not possible that a clear sense of catholic identity existed much earlier in the second century, revolving around a different definitional standard than that assumed by many in modern scholarship? 53 I have shown that the problem of early catholic self-definition as well as the lack of an enduring model to explain both unity and diversity in the early church have led to a number of competing views and methodologies. I will therefore explore the selfdefinition of catholic Christians in the early second century and determine the basis for their self-identification as ‘catholic.’ In this study, I present a model in which the unifying factor among ‘catholic’ Christians was faithfulness to the incarnational narrative in which the one Creator God sent His divine Son/Logos to become incarnate as a fleshly human being, who died for the sins of humanity, rose bodily from the dead, and ascended bodily to heaven. 54 I will demonstrate that the centrality of this incarnational Wissenschaft 68 [1977]: 210) believes the transition occurred between 150 and 180. In light of my thesis, I would propose that any such transition occurred between 70 and 90 CE. Other scholars, by applying criteria such as the rise of the bishopric or a New Testament canon as the sine qua non of ‘the catholic church,’ end up dating the rise of the early church according to anachronistic or reductionistic definitional standards. 53 John Knox admits that ‘there is something arbitrary, perhaps, in focusing this discussion of early Catholicism upon canon, creed, and ministry’ (Knox, The Early Church and the Coming Great Church, 128). 54 The term ‘incarnational narrative’ is used in a similar way in C. Stephen Evans, “The Incarnational Narrative as Myth and History,” Christian Scholar’s Review 23 (1993): 387–407; The Historical Christ and the Jesus of Faith: The Incarnational Narrative as History (Oxford: Clarendon 1996). Evans’s use refers to the Christian account of Jesus of Nazareth who was more than a mere human being, but also ‘the Son of God, a unique, divine person’ who lived, died, and rose again (Evans, The Historical Christ and the Jesus of Faith, 2). My own use includes these notions, but also emphasizes that the incarnation of the Son of God was maintained throughout all events of the narrative—the birth, life, suffering, death, resurrection, and ascension.\n\n1. MANY CHRISTOLOGIES, MANY CHRISTIANITIES?\n\n21\n\nnarrative unified widespread leaders and communities even amidst a great diversity of teachings, traditions, and texts. 55 Thus, the picture that emerges with such a model of early catholic identity is one of great diversity orbiting around a clear and conscious standard of definition, at least in the minds of its propagators and defenders. Though he identifies a different gravitational center, Hultgren offers a similar picture of unity and diversity in early Christianity when he writes, ‘Like the finalized canon of the New Testament, normative Christianity recognizes and preserves different expressions of Christian faith, while acknowledging that there are limits to acceptable diversity.’ 56 Indeed, Hultgren notes that ‘the tradition of Jesus as crucified and raised would become ascendant in the earliest communities of faith and then in normative Christianity.’ 57 However, it is the emphasis on the person of Christ as both divine and human, spirit and flesh, that brings the uniqueness of this gospel narrative to a higher level in second century Christianity. It is this unique christological element that is lacking in many discussions of the doctrinal norms of early Christianity. Those scholars who have advanced a central unifying force among catholic Christians often mean by this a less objective and conscious awareness of doctrinal unity. For example, immediately after the publication of Bauer’s Rechtgläubigkeit und Ketzerei im ältesten Christentum, Moffat responded that Bauer’s thesis did not account for the ‘sense of the centre’ evident in early Christianity that Crucial elements of this narrative were not only contained in early confessions, hymns, and writings, but also portrayed in the worship of the community through the sacraments of baptism and the Eucharist and, I will show, even in the offices of the churches and the nature and mission of the church itself. Thus the ‘incarnational christological narrative’ can be portrayed by a variety of signs and symbols, not merely in words. At the same time, polemics against the incarnational christological narrative can take the form not only of attacks on the words, but also on the symbols and implications of such a christology. 56 Hultgren, The Rise of Normative Christianity, 105. 57 Ibid., 112. 55\n\n22\n\nTHE CENTER AND THE SOURCE\n\nformed a central unity among a number of churches. 58 Likewise, Turner held to an ‘instinctive feeling’ among the churches regarding the center of catholic unity rather than ‘fixed and definable doctrinal norms.’ 59 Wilken also speaks of a ‘center,’ but regards this as a later second century development, and in any case it is not seen as primarily doctrinal. 60 In contrast to such notions of a late or loose sense of unity, I would like to re-offer just the opposite standard of catholic identity. Though certainly not an advocate of the specific thesis I will develop, Hopkins’s statement regarding the relationship of the unique christology of catholic Christians to their own identity should demonstrate that the move is sufficiently tolerable for me to proceed with the investigation. He writes: Genetically, Christian leaders’ fixation on their common beliefs arose from their extraordinary nature: Jesus was both human and divine, he suffered death to save humanity; by believing in him as the son of God, we will be saved. By both Jewish and pagan standards, this message was extraordinary. No wonder it played a crucial role in Christians’ self-definition. 61\n\nIn short, I will argue that early catholic Christians identified themselves with the incarnational christological narrative and therefore with each other in contrast with non-incarnational James Moffatt, ‘Review of Rechtgläubigkeit und Ketzerei im ältesten Christentum,’ Expository Times 45 (1933–34): 475–76. 59 Turner, The Pattern of Christian Truth, 10. 60 Wilken, ‘Diversity and Unity in Early Christianity,’ 110. Elsewhere he writes, ‘Of course Christianity was also defined by its beliefs. … But to be baptized meant becoming part of a society within society with its own rituals and rules, governance and discipline. The office of the bishop, baptism, and the Eucharist gave shape to the community. … I single out these three at the beginning to stress that what set Christianity apart was not simply its beliefs but also the architecture of its communal life’ (Robert L. Wilken, The First Thousand Years: A Global History of Christianity [New Haven: Yale University Press, 2012], 35–36). 61 Keith Hopkins, ‘Christian Number and Its Implications,’ Journal of Early Christian Studies 6 (1998): 220–21. 58\n\n1. MANY CHRISTOLOGIES, MANY CHRISTIANITIES?\n\n23\n\nchristologies and thus non-catholic Christian communities. Furthermore, I will show that this incarnational center of catholic identity was early, geographically widespread, and theological fundamental, suggesting that it had to have been formulated and promoted around the middle of the first century. The Catholicity of the Incarnational Narrative James D. G. Dunn, in his Christology in the Making, argues that incarnational christology was a late first century development representing one of many Jesus traditions vying for dominance among early Christians. 62 New Testament scholars in fact have identified several strata or stages in the development of christology in the first century. For example, Fuller begins with an early Palestinian christology focusing on the earthly life and teachings of Jesus, his death and resurrection, and his anticipated return. The second stratum of Hellenistic Jewish christology emphasized the sending of Jesus and his present lordship over the entire world. And the final stratum included personal pre-existence and incarnation, with the use of ontological rather than merely functional language. 63 Kysar—relying on Fuller—develops these stages in a way that seems to suggest an exclusivity for each James D. G. Dunn, Christology in the Making: A New Testament Inquiry into the Origins of the Doctrine of the Incarnation, 2 ed. (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1996). For differing perspectives on this issue, see Udo Schnelle, Antidocetic Christology in the Gospel of John: An Investigation of the Place of the Fourth Gospel in the Johannine School, trans. Linda M. Maloney (Minneapolis: Fortress, 1992); N. T. Wright, Jesus and the Victory of God, Christian Origins and the Question of God, vol. 2 (Minneapolis: Fortress, 1996). Many scholars agree, however, that by the end of the first century at least the ‘Johannine circle’ held a clear incarnational christology. See C. K. Barrett, The Gospel According to St. John, 2d edn (Philadelphia: Westminster, 1978), 96–97; Alois Grillmeier, Christ in Christian Tradition, trans. John Bowden, 2d edn, vol. 1, From the Apostolic Age to Chalcedon (451) (London: Mowbrays, 1975), 26–32; T. E. Pollard, Johannine Christology and the Early Church (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1970), 18–19. 63 R. H. Fuller, The Foundations of New Testament Christology (London: Lutterworth, 1965). 62\n\n24\n\nTHE CENTER AND THE SOURCE\n\nstratum, labeling the developments as ‘adoptionistic,’ ‘agency,’ and ‘incarnational.’ 64 In these categorizations, an adoptionistic christology portrayed a human Jesus adopted as the Son of God or Messiah because of purity or holiness, either during his earthly life or at the time of his resurrection. An agency christology saw Christ as God’s human prophetic representative, endowed perhaps with unique spiritual power and divine presence, having been given the authority of God and ‘sent’ to function as his agent. An incarnational christology, however, emphasized the divine Son of God, or Logos, coming from heaven to become incarnate in fleshly humanity, to die, and to rise again. Evidence for all of these christological portraits can be found in the New Testament and early Christian writings, but a common presupposition (or at least a frequent practice) among many scholars is that they be treated as mutually exclusive. There is no doubt that certain individual teachers and traditions embraced one Jesus tradition while excluding others, but we will show that an authentic incarnational christological understanding actually accommodates the various Jesus traditions under a unifying metanarrative. Thus, the catholic incarnational narrative could regard the incarnate God-man, Jesus of Nazareth, as the agent of God who was indwelled by the Holy Spirit in a special messianic anointing at his baptism, and adopted as the royal Son of God at his ascension to the Father after his resurrection from the dead. The forced distinction between functional and ontological christologies is a false one unless such a distinction is explicitly stated in the text. 65 It is only when an adoptionistic or agency christology claims to exhaust the meaning of Christ’s person and work that other christological categories and descriptions are excluded. However, in any scheme that synthesizes adoptionistic, agency, and incarnational concepts, the incarnational christological narrative must by necessity serve as the metanarrative according to which other concepts are understood. 66 See Robert Kysar, John: The Maverick Gospel, rev. edn (Lousiville: Westminster John Knox, 1993), 33–35. 65 See Fuller, The Foundations of New Testament Christology, 247–50. 66 For more positive, though confessional, appraisals of the bibilical 64\n\n1. MANY CHRISTOLOGIES, MANY CHRISTIANITIES?\n\n25\n\nYet in the current hermeneutical and historiographical climate, many understand the documentary phenomena as evidencing independent community narratives that rule out a meaningful metanarrative. As mentioned earlier, some have posited a sometimes radically diverse array of Christianities based on competing christologies well beyond the first and into the second century. 67 This diversity is said to have led to christological conflict and the eventual dominance of incarnational christology—to the exclusion or absorption of others—by the third century CE. Irenaeus is often regarded as the clearest example of the dominance of incarnational christology in catholic Christianity. 68 In my treatment of the rise of catholic Christianity in relation to the incarnational narrative, I will simultaneously contribute to the question of the development of incarnational christology itself by entering the first century through the back door, so to speak. By establishing the early, foundational, and widespread influence of the incarnational narrative in the second century, I will suggest that this evidences an earlier development of the paradoxical formulation of incarnational christology perhaps as early as the mid-first century. 69 In turn, this suggests a conscious identity for evidence, see, for example, Raymond E. Brown, An Introduction to New Testament Christology (New York: Paulist, 1994); Richard N. Longenecker, ed., Contours of Christology in the New Testament, McMaster New Testament Studies (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 2005). 67 Willi Braun, ed., Rhetoric and Reality in Early Christianities, Studies in Christianity and Judaism, ed.

As one then places the collective evidence of early catholic Christianity in the second century alongside New Testament expressions of the incarnational narrative, the evidence becomes compelling for a mid-first century formulation of this christology, which places it in the climax of the apostolic period. An Explanation of the Dual Phenomena of Unity and Diversity in Early Christianity As I have already shown, identifying the unifying factors and diversifying forces among Christians in the second century has proven difficult. For example, Pearson argued that social and theological unity among second century Christians—though an ideal—was largely just that. Suggesting that this ideal of unity was not tied to doctrinal unity but to the authority of the bishop in both Ignatius and Irenaeus, he noted that, according to the early fathers, ‘there is no real diversity in the church.’ 70 He then demonstrated that the reality was quite different—that even the united church of Irenaeus was marked by great diversity. 71 In contrast, I will argue that the early fathers of the second century were able not only to idealize, but to actualize, a catholic unity in the midst of very diverse teachings, traditions, and texts by centering on the incarnational narrative as a standard of confessional unity. Although external and institutional marks of canon, creed, and cathedra clearly developed in later decades and centuries as the sentinels of catholic orthodoxy, the catholic churches of the early second century primarily emphasized faithfulness to the incarnational narrative as the primary mark of catholic self-identity. This allowed—either intentionally or by practical default—a broad latitude within the bounds of incarnational catholicity. These three issues therefore set the agenda and create the bounds for study: catholic identity centered on faithfulness to the 70 71\n\nPearson, The Emergence of Christian Religion, 175. Ibid., 176–78.\n\n1. MANY CHRISTOLOGIES, MANY CHRISTIANITIES?\n\n27\n\nincarnational narrative, the universal breadth of the incarnational narrative, and the unity of catholic Christianity centered on the incarnational narrative in the midst of diverse traditions.\n\nCHAPTER 2. METHODOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS The thesis which I will demonstrate in the following study is that the incarnational christological narrative was already geographically widespread in the early second century and played a foundational role in the theology and paraenesis of those who identified themselves as and with ‘catholic’ Christians. Thus, rather than a clear catholic identity coalescing from first and second century diversity and conflict, catholic identity actually centered on the incarnational narrative at the beginning of the second century, both preceding and precipitating identity-challenging christological conflict. As such, the shared incarnational christological narrative was the center of catholic Christian identity and therefore the source of internal catholic unity amidst diversity as well as the source of external conflict with communities that rejected the incarnational narrative. This thesis differs from both the traditional (or Eusebian) view of Christian origins as well as from non-traditional (or antiEusebian) perspectives. This ‘traditional view’ is described by Mack as a ‘monolinear development of a single Christian church.’ 1 Indeed, such a model is difficult to defend in light of the evidence of diversity and conflict in earliest Christianity. Thus, the ‘traditional view’ itself requires modification. However, an opposite tendency toward accentuated diversity of Christianities fails to Burton L. Mack, ‘Many Movements, Many Myths: Redescribing the Attractions of Early Christianities,’ Religious Studies Review 25 (1999): 133. For a helpful review of the Eusebian view, see James D. G. Dunn, Neither Jew nor Greek: A Contested Identity, Christianity in the Making, vol. 3 (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 2015), 7–10. 1\n\n29\n\n30\n\nTHE CENTER AND THE SOURCE\n\naccount for powerful, early, and concrete unifying tendencies among far-flung communities of Christians who eventually identified themselves as ‘catholic Christians’ or ‘the Great Church.’ In this light, I will propose a model of early Christian identity in which a sometimes radical diversity of teachers, traditions, and texts could maintain a ‘catholic’ identity in the late first and early second centuries around a clear and distinct christological narrative. In general terms this is not a revolutionary concept. As Frend notes, ‘Early Christianity was not a monolithic movement but a kaleidoscope of varied traditions, beliefs, and hopes centred on the single figure of Jesus Christ.’ 2 However, I will argue that the ‘centering’ force of catholic Christianity was not merely any notion of ‘Jesus Christ,’ but the Jesus Christ who was the divine Son of God, who was born, suffered, died, rose again, and ascended to heaven in the flesh—a clear and distinct ‘incarnational narrative.’ Therefore, although there was no monolinear development of a single catholic institution or network, there was a central focus of identity among the Christians who regarded themselves (and were regarded by others) as ‘catholic,’ a confessional identity which noncatholic Christians did not share. Most modern descriptions of the unifying beliefs and practices of early catholic Christianity tend to focus on factors broader than an incarnational narrative center. Hultgren, for instance, suggests that the beginnings of a normative tradition in the middle of the first century included beliefs in the one God of Israel, the essential humanity of Jesus, redemption by his crucifixion and resurrection, the dawn of a new era of the Spirit, and a Christ-inspired love for the community. 3 In the sub-apostolic period, from 70 to 100 CE, to these previous commonalities were added the composition of ecclesiastical literature and idealization of the apostolic teachers. Yet amidst these inter-community continuities, Hultgren asserts that major differences existed in christology and christological W. H. C. Frend, ‘“And I Have Other Sheep”—John 10:16,’ in The Making of Orthodoxy: Essays in Honor of Henry Chadwick, ed. Rowan Williams (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1989), 36. 3 Arland J. Hultgren, The Rise of Normative Christianity (Minneapolis: Fortress, 1994), 53. 2\n\n2. METHODOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS\n\n31\n\ntitles. 4 Incorporating the second century, Hultgren identifies six factors that distinguished normative Christianity from other forms:\n\n1. The God of Israel can be loved and trusted as the Creator of all that is and as benevolent to humanity.\n\n2. Jesus of Nazareth can be trusted as the one sent by God to reveal God and to redeem humanity.\n\n3. In spite of human failure, which would disqualify one from salvation, trust in God’s redemptive work in Christ is the way to salvation, which is begun in this life, but completed beyond it. 4. The person saved by faith in God’s redemptive work in Christ is expected to care about, indeed love, others and be worthy of their trust. 5. Those who trust in Jesus as revealer of God and redeemer of humanity are expected to live as disciples in a community whose ethos is congruent with the legacy of his life and teaching.\n\n6. Those who live in communities of faith belong to a fellowship that is larger than that provided by the local community, an extended fellowship. 5\n\nWhereas Hultgren’s approach is diachronic, tracing commonalities within a succession of periods, my own approach will be to examine one period synchronically and geographically—the late first to early second century between approximately 90 and 150. After developing a picture of the nature of catholic Christian selfidentity in that period, I will then use these findings to draw historical implications for earlier periods in the first century. To sum up, in developing the thesis of a unifying incarnational christological narrative in the second century, I will establish four things. First, I will establish a connection between the incarnational christological narrative and catholic self-identity. Primarily through an analysis of early second century writings, I will show that early catholic Christians identified themselves with other 4 5\n\nIbid., 78–80. Ibid., 86.\n\n32\n\nTHE CENTER AND THE SOURCE\n\ncatholics on the basis of a shared incarnational christological narrative, and that ecclesiastical, social, and liturgical concerns served to defend and promote the christological center. The question to answer is this: was early catholic Christianity ‘catholic’ precisely because of its incarnational christology? The evidence will show that this should be answered in the affirmative. Second, I will show that because incarnational christology formed the positive center of early catholic self-definition, the early catholic Christians used this christological center as the standard by which they distinguished between ‘orthodoxy’ and ‘heresy’. 6 I will therefore interact with scholars who have suggested that incarnational christology as well as catholic self-identity developed in reaction to christological diversity and social conflict in the first and second centuries and that the early distinction between orthodoxy and heresy was either ‘soft’ or muddled. As catholic identity encountered competing social or ecclesiastical communities, their infant incarnational narrative continued to be refined throughout the second and third centuries, but the distinction between ‘orthodox’ and ‘heretical’ or between ‘catholic’ and ‘non-catholic’ was determined primarily based on traditional christological considerations. Third, I will show that it was in light of a traditional and authoritative incarnational narrative that catholic writers interpreted both texts and worldviews, so that an incarnational hermeneutic was applied in catholic communities while non-catholic groups applied a distinctly non-incarnational or even anti-incarnational hermeneutic to the same texts and traditions. Therefore, the basis of incarnational christology was not primarily reflective exegesis of authoritative texts, but a received incarnational tradition within the early catholic communities. Finally, I will suggest that the early, foundational, and widespread establishment of incarnational christology supports the Depending on how one understands the situation of the first two hundred years of Christian history, the labels ‘orthodoxy’ and ‘heresy’ are variously used. Though their use sometimes presupposes the truth of a particular theology and the falsehood of another, when I use these terms, I will do so from the perspective of particular ancient writers. 6\n\n2. METHODOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS\n\n33\n\nsecond century tradition that apostolic leaders with perceived authority exercised influence over the theology and thought of early catholic communities into the late first century. 7 Their disciples, then, exercised relative authority in the early second century. Thus, doctrinal authority in early catholic communities primarily centered on the teachings of individuals and communities rather than texts, and texts had similar authority only when written or received by these individuals or communities and interpreted in conformity with their incarnational theology. 8 My method of establishing the elements of my thesis will be to carry on a dialogue with the ancient texts—that is, to pose a variety of questions to the primary documents available to us from the early second century and slightly beyond. 9 These questions will Contra Conzelmann, who has argued that the idea of the authoritative ‘twelve apostles’ developed ‘in the “post-apostolic age”’ and had ‘no concrete influence on the theology and the form of the church generally. They are influential only as an idea’ (Hans Conzelmann, An Outline of the Theology of the New Testament, trans. John Bowden [New York: Harper and Row, 1969], 290–91). 8 Though this sounds close to the critical assertion that in the period of early Christianity ‘there was already Christian faith and a Christian church before a New Testament text’ (Gerd Lüdemann, Heretics: The Other Side of Early Christianity, trans. John Bowden [Louisville: Westminster John Knox, 1996], 1), I am asserting that in the absence of a universally received and stable collection of apostolic and prophetic New Testament books, the early catholic communities still had authoritative doctrinal norms. 9 One danger in asking questions of these various documents is that the enthusiastic interrogator will ask questions that the documents do not answer. Unsatisfied with silence, the interrogator might extract a coerced confession. Yet the alternative to the impossibility of a purely objective investigation is a subjective investigation conducted in a community of scholarly accountability. For background literature on hermeneutics that have influenced my perspective on understanding, see Hans-Georg Gadamer, Truth and Method, trans. Garret Barden and William G. Doerpel (New York: Seabury, 1975) and Werner Jeanrond, Theological Hermeneutics: Development and Significance (New York: Crossroad, 1991). 7\n\n34\n\nTHE CENTER AND THE SOURCE\n\naddress three major issues: the status of the incarnational narrative, the notion of catholic self-identity, and the standard of interecclesiastical unity. These questions, however, bring up a number of preliminary methodological issues.\n\nTHE PRIMARY SOURCES Most of the work of this study will be done in the available primary sources, with preference given to those non-canonical sources from the late first and early second centuries, to about 150 CE. However, I am conscious of the fact that scholars have available for study only those documents that were regarded by later Christians as worthy of preservation. Naturally, later doctrinal biases would play a role in the preservation of these texts. 10 Therefore, the extant works may reflect the interests of later ‘catholic’ Christianity simply because the works from the same period that represented other forms of Christianity were not preserved. We must remember, though, that even among writers regarded by later catholic Christians as ‘orthodox,’ we have only a representation of their entire collections of writings. This is not because some of the writings of particular authors were selected and the others rejected, for we know that later fathers actually quoted from or referred to then-extant writings favorably. The simple fact is that some of these were not copied frequently enough and were lost. One author notes: The written sources on which we must base our understanding of second century Christianity are very few, and for the most part these deal with very particular matters and were not written with an eye to the broad questions of later historians. We have a piece from Rome from the end of the first century, a few letters from Antioch from a bit later, and a scattering of\n\nHowever, this is not always the rule, as many documents regarded as non-orthodox were copied or extensively quoted for the purpose of refutation, which led to their preservation. 10\n\n2. METHODOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS\n\n35\n\ndocuments written we are not altogether sure where, why, or when. 11\n\nThis estimation sounds rather bleak, but I believe the reality is much more promising. For the documents available from the early second century are of such a character that their contents may still be analyzed with a view toward discerning the state of ‘catholic’ Christianity during this period. These are not just documents written in Rome and Antioch, but often correspondences that provide evidence for the extent and nature of existing personal and geographical relationships between people and communities— relationships that indicate the extent of unity and diversity among these groups and evidence a particular center of shared catholic identity. It is in this historical light that these documents must be read. The order and nature of this historical exposition will be seen in the ‘Overview’ section below. Though I am confident that I can demonstrate the usefulness of the extant documents of the earliest generations of Christians to answer questions about the nature of early catholic Christianity, I admit that with the exception of the Nag Hammadi Codexes and the recent Gospel of Judas, very few new documents have been found in the last century that help paint a clearer picture of the early second century than had been sketched before. The sources—at least for what was later regarded as ‘catholic’ Christianity—have not changed significantly. Yet the historiographical approaches to these documents have shifted in the last century, as indicated in chapter 1.\n\nJames F.

This of course involves answering the question of whether the elements of the incarnational narrative are even present in the text, or if some other christology or narrative is found therein. If the distinctive elements of the narrative are either explicit or implicit in the text, then the investigation may explore the place of this incarnational christology in the thought and theology of the document as a whole. Does it play a central and organizational role? Or does the incarnational doctrine cower in the margins? Another realm of inquiry which I will pose to the primary documents will be to determine how the writing addresses the question of Christian self-identity.

METHODOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS\n\n37\n\nnarrative or structure? How does the author or community that stands behind the text conceive of Christian identity vis-à-vis competing communities? And how does this relate to the question of the place of the unique incarnational narrative? A third set of questions I will explore involves how the writer or community represented by the text perceived the relationship with other leaders and communities outside their own. Does it either explicitly or implicitly point to a unifying standard of identity—a ‘catholicity’? If so, does this relate to the established incarnational narrative? What effect did the ‘almost obsessional mutual interest and interchange’ between certain Christian communities have on the preservation or establishment of catholic self-identity? 12 Ultimately, however, it is my opinion as a twenty-first century scholar affected as I am by contemporary discussions on hermeneutics in a postmodern context, 13 that the evaluation and interpretation of the extant documentary evidence plays a significant but not determinative role in the views of scholars regarding unity and diversity in early Christianity. Presuppositions often mold the valuation (and not simply the evaluation) of evidences, the methods of interpretation, and even the types of conclusions that will be regarded as scientifically, philosophically, or historically acceptable. Hermeneutics, historiography,\n\nRowan Williams writes that non-gnostic churches of the second century presents us with an enormous amount of evidence for what can sometimes seem like an ‘almost obsessional mutual interest and interchange’ (Rowan Williams, ‘Does It Make Sense to Speak of PreNicene Orthodoxy?,’ in The Making of Orthodoxy: Essays in Honor of Henry Chadwick, ed. Rowan Williams [Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1989], 11). 13 On the problems identified and created by post-modern approaches to hermeneutics, and a hopeful perspective, see Frances Young, ‘From Suspicion and Sociology to Spirituality: On Method, Hermeneutics and Appropriation with Respect to Patristic Material,’ Studia patristica 29 (1997): 421–35. 12\n\n38\n\nTHE CENTER AND THE SOURCE\n\nworldview, theology, and even economics and politics all play their roles in how individual scholars handle the same evidences. 14 For some, these presuppositions are non-negotiable (or at least stubborn) obstacles to objective appraisal, analysis, and interpretation. 15 Scholarship must therefore employ the lever of evidence from primary sources, applying a careful analysis of texts in their most likely historical contexts in ways that are verifiable among diverse and even conflicting schools of historiography and hermeneutics. It seems the only approach that will satisfy this demand is to read texts in a way that strives to allow the authors themselves to express their ideas, definitions, emphases, biases, presuppositions, and theologies in their own words. Thus, prooftexting, synthesizing, surveying, or systematizing across authors cannot be employed uncritically, as this method presupposes that which is in question—an inherent inter-textual unity. However, neither can the opposite be allowed—a critical approach that presupposes radical diversity and conflict prior to See William Everett Ferguson, ed., Doctrinal Diversity: Varieties of Early Christianity, Recent Studies in Early Christianity, vol. 4 (New York: Garland, 1999); Robert A.

Each ancient author must therefore be allowed to speak. And language must be seen as a vehicle for ideas—in this case, theological ideas. Unfortunately, the result of my expositional method is a sometimes tedious detailed examination of each individual text, but anything less would necessarily render unrestrained subjective results. The presuppositions in the study of early Christianity are numerous for so many reasons. While very few scholars would dare to argue that diversity did not exist in early Christianity, the degree of diversity is a perennial question. The real issue, though, is whether diversity necessarily meant disunity and conflict. And even this question is difficult. Did conflict imply schism and ‘heresy’? Is it possible that later catholic communities put up with far less diversity than earlier catholic communities, while at the same time earlier communities had a more conscious and bettercommunicated sense of the unifying aspects of their beliefs and practices? Also, scholars often speak about the diversity within early Christianity, the opposing forces in the early church, and so forth, without clearly defining these categories. We cannot assume that an author of a particular ancient writing ever regarded himself or herself as part of the church or as part of Christianity, and we must take care that we do not anachronistically define these terms either too narrowly or too broadly. Only a careful examination of the uses of these terms and concepts in the early second century literature will help establish more accurate categories—if, indeed, they existed.\n\nPRESUPPOSITIONAL PROBLEMS: HISTORIOGRAPHY OR HAGIOGRAPHY? In his critique of Rodney Stark’s The Rise of Christianity, Mack notes, ‘The tendency has been to read our texts as historical documents, taking their constructions at face value, and fitting together all the reports in support of the canonical sketch of Christian origins.’ 16 Mack’s alternative is a more ‘objective’ hermeneutic of suspicion, in 16\n\nMack, ‘Many Movements, Many Myths,’ 134.\n\n40\n\nTHE CENTER AND THE SOURCE\n\nwhich the texts are read as ‘arguments, accounts, and rhetorical persuasions composed at particular times as self-serving constructions of their present situations and invented construals of the past.’ 17 Fair enough, but one must take care here. Unrestrained suspicion is no less virtuous than unbridled naiveté; neither distortion should be donned with the mantel of ‘objectivity.’ Each approach is burdened by its own set of conscious or unconscious prejudices and presuppositions. With an awareness of these two tendencies, my own method of reading these texts begins with an exegetical analysis and exposition of the primary texts, closely examining their context, arguments, and tone. This does not necessarily presuppose that a particular text’s construal of reality actually corresponds to reality. Thus, when Ignatius of Antioch described what it meant to be ‘catholic,’ we can of course assume that Ignatius himself propounded this view of catholicity. However, without some means of validation, we cannot assume that this was the common understanding among his recipients. This is why my method of historical investigation must move beyond a single text for validation, especially in key places in the argument. I must, so to speak, doubt my own exposition and understanding and, to a certain reasonable degree, grant the benefit of the doubt to those who would challenge my evidence and arguments. So, as I examine the reception of various teachers, traditions, and texts, I will test whether the ideas of the individual authors were received in such a way that the reception validated the author’s construal of reality. Therefore, my method cannot be strictly exegetical, but synthetic; it must be both diachronic and synchronic in its analysis of the relationship between various teachers, traditions, and texts. Taken together, this will either validate or correct the claims of various documents. Yet in this hermeneutical and historiographical approach, I seek to avoid an all-too-common habit among scholars of Christian origins. Many seek to distance themselves from the historical theological issues addressed in the primary sources and to follow the trend—illustrated above by Mack—to all but banish theology 17\n\nIbid.\n\n2. METHODOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS\n\n41\n\nand faith from scholarly discussions on Christian origins. By treating the history of Christianity as an object of sociological inquiry (which in itself is necessary and helpful), the theological and ideological questions that so concerned the original authors and audiences of the historical documents are in danger of being absorbed by sociological, psychological, political, or cultural theories and explanations. 18 I suspect that the unintentional result will sometimes be an anachronistically secular reading of originally sacred sources. Historians, sociologists, and philologists, in a commendable attempt to avoid theological and confessional judgments, often seek to apply an ‘objective’ scientific methodology. However, such attempts run the risk of failing to grasp the deeper emotional, motivational, and existential power of theological concerns contained in the very documents they are seeking to objectively interpret. Thus, the theology of the fathers seems to be read as merely the functional trappings of religion—the accidents of a sociological essence rather than the ‘thing’ itself.
