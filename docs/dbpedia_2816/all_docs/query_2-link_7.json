        "text": "In the autumn of 1947 Togo Mina, Director of the Coptic Museum in Old Cairo, showed to Jean Doresse a Coptic manuscript acquired the previous year, which we today call Codex III. Doresse recognized its gnostic character and its importance, and began inquiries as to whether there were other manuscripts in the same find, a find dated ‘about 1945’. Parts of one other codex—today called Codex I—were located in the possession of a Belgian antiquities dealer Albert Eid. This incomplete codex was subsequently taken out of Egypt and, via America and Benelux, emerged in Zürich, where it was purchased for the Jung Institute by Mr George H. Page and named the Jung Codex. It was presented to Jung as a birthday gift, and is not, as one usually infers from the literature, the possession of the Jung Institute, but rather of the heirs of C. G. Jung. An agreement to return it to Egypt after its publication has been made in principle. The Gospel of Truth (1, 2) has been turned over to the Egyptian Embassy in Berne, and from there wad returned to the Coptic Museum; however, the tractate On the Resurrection (1, 3), though published, ahs not been thus far returned. What is still in Zürich is in the Leu Bank.\n\n1 The text of the appeal is as follows:\n\n(1) The Nag Hammadi codices are of quite fundamental significance for the study of Gnosticism, whichis itself of considerable importance for understanding the context of ideas out of which our modern world emerged.\n\n(2) We wish to express our satisfaction over the adoption, by the General Conference of UNESCO, of the project of producing facsimile photographs of the pages of these codices. We are also pleased with the amount of work that has been accomplished thus far. We are furthermore grateful for the interest and co-operation of the United Arab Republic in this project. (One recalls in the case of the comparable Manichaean documents discovered a generation ago that the failure to take such measures led to the irretrievable loss of many of them as a result of the troubled political circumstances of ourtimes.)\n\n(3) The work that has thus far been done in preparation for a facsimile edition is not yet accessible to the scholarly world, pending the completion of the photography and the publication of the plates. It is hence important that this project be carried through to completion and that the work thus far done should not be lost.\n\n(4) Transcriptions that have been published of a part of the codices do not replace photographs.For in many cases a repeated study of photographs of the original text, after it has been translated and interpreted, produces corrections of the readings of the transcription made at the beginning of the process. Lacunae and fragmentary pages can be restored reliably only when one can study photographs of the original, to detect vestiges of letters in broken areas and to calculate exactly how manyletters were originally in part of a page that is now lost.\n\n(5) In some cases the papyri need to be prepared prior to definitive photography. For some of the plexiglass sheets into which the pages have been placed contain fragments that do not belong together.The final photography of such pages would best be subsequent to an ordering of the fragments that puts them in their original relationship to each other. And some fragments are stuck to the cover of one codex, from which they must be disengaged by an expert prior to photographing. It is hoped that UNESCO can provide assistance to make possible this aspect of the photographing project.\n\n(6) The publication of the photographic plates in a series of volumes of facsimiles should begin as soon as possible, so as to make the documents available to scholars. (In the case of the Gospel of Thomas, in which case the plates were published a decade ago, one can observe the number of translations, scholarly monographs and discussions that follow upon such publication.)\n\n(7) In view of the factors stated above, the 66 experts assembled from eleven countries in April 1966 at Messina for an ‘International Colloquium on the Origins of Gnosticism’, arranged bythe University of Messina and the International Association for the History of Religions, wish to express unanimously their fervent wish that this project can be carried through to its completion withthe support of UNESCO without delay.\n\n5 ‘Is Chenoboskion Worth Visiting?’, Catholic Biblical Quarterly, XXI (1959), 494. The description in the French edition, which North uses, is not on p. 158, as he says, but rather p. 151 (p. 133 of the Eng. ed.). He says Doresse ‘seems unable or unwilling to indicate with Baedeker-precision exactly where the finds were made’. But Doresse refers to ‘the southern part of the cemetery’, and explains: ‘As to the exact location of the find, opinion differed by some few dozen yards; but everyone was sure that it was just about here.’ Of course North's following comment is a pleasantry: ‘possibly to prevent amateurs from browsing around and picking up a few more gospels for the college museum back home’. He says the taxi goes ‘as far as Kasr Sayyad’ (mine took me on dirt roads all the way to the cemetery). He refers there to ‘a solicitous and friendly individual who turns out to be a police-man safeguarding him’. In 1966 the guard of the pharaonic tombs lived at el Kasr es Sayyad, was clearly identifiable by his double-barrelled shotgun, which functioned as a badge of authority, and was the only hostile personality I met. He has since been replaced. The police station at Nag Hammadi, to which I went first from the train station, was very co-operative in securing for me taxi, interpreter, and lodging."
