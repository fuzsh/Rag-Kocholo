        "text": "Citation preview\n\nThe Christianization of Knowledge in Late Antiquity\n\nThe Christianization of Knowledge in Late Antiquity: Intellectual and Material Transformations traces the beginning of Late Antiquity from a new angle. Shifting the focus away from the Christianization of people or the transformation of institutions, Mark Letteney interrogates the creation of novel and durable structures of knowledge across the Roman scholarly landscape, and the embedding of those changes in manuscript witnesses. Letteney explores scholarly productions ranging from juristic writings and legal compendia to theological tractates, military handbooks, historical accounts, miscellanies, grammatical treatises, and the Palestinian Talmud. He demonstrates how imperial Christianity inﬂected the production of truth far beyond the domain of theology – and how intellectual tools forged in the ﬁres of doctrinal controversy shed their theological baggage and came to undergird the great intellectual productions of the Theodosian Age and their material expressions. Letteney’s volume offers new insights and a new approach to answering the perennial question: What does it mean for Rome to become Christian? This title is also available as Open Access on Cambridge Core. Mark Letteney is an assistant professor of history at the University of Washington. He holds a PhD from Princeton University and has held fellowships at the American Academy in Rome and the American School of Classical Studies in Athens. He is coauthor, with Matthew D. C. Larsen, of Ancient Mediterranean Incarceration (University of California Press, forthcoming ).\n\nPublished online by Cambridge University Press\n\n“Mark Letteney’s book approaches the question of the rise of Christianity in the late Roman Empire through a new perspective: not the more traditional one of Christianizing people, doctrinal controversies or demographic changes, but that of knowledge structures. The book is characterized by a particularly careful exegesis of the sources and a very extensive comparison with the earlier literature. It stands out for its great originality and is an uncommon example of how productive research in Late Antiquity can be given the aptitude for capturing the echoes that can come from texts of diverse origins.” – Lucio De Giovanni, Università di Napoli Federico II “Letteney’s remarkable new book charts the impact of Christianity not on religion or institutions – the focus of so much work on early Christianity – but rather on the organization of knowledge and the production of meaning in Late Antiquity. Drawing on a range of specialized texts (law codes, technical and bureaucratic treatises, military handbooks, and so on), he demonstrates that the particular forms of meaning-making that emerged in the context of theological and doctrinal dispute became broadly generalized in late-antique thought, and could be found in everything from the writings of the jurists to the Palestinian Talmud. A compelling and sensitive new sociology of knowledge, The Christianization of Knowledge in Late Antiquity will be required reading for students of early Christianity and the cultures of Late Antiquity, and will also be of interest to everyone working on the production of knowledge in premodern societies more generally.” – Carlos F. Noreña, University of California, Berkeley “Mark Letteney has produced a remarkable book that seeks to answer a question of relevance still today: What difference did Christianity make to Rome? Letteney contends that the fourth century was not a time of pagan–Christian conﬂict, nor a simple transition from a Roman to a new Christian empire, but rather a period of rupture as well as creative construction in the very ways in which fourth-century Nicene Christians made arguments and conveyed knowledge. These changes were promoted by the emergence of the codex and of new tools of Christian scholarship that promulgated a novel and long-lasting late antique book-oriented culture. Drawing on Roman law, ancient technical treatises, Christian theology, and Rabbinic texts, Letteney shows the development of this shared book culture and new scholarly practices that gradually permeated the empire and transcended religious differences as Nicene Christians emerged in the late fourth century in positions of power as the new elite of Rome. Letteney’s book thus provides original and thoughtful insight into why the Christianization of Rome matters to intellectual as well as religious history.” – Michele Salzman, University of California, Riverside\n\nPublished online by Cambridge University Press\n\nThe Christianization of Knowledge in Late Antiquity Intellectual and Material Transformations\n\nMARK LETTENEY University of Washington\n\nPublished online by Cambridge University Press\n\nShaftesbury Road, Cambridge  , United Kingdom One Liberty Plaza, th Floor, New York,  , USA  Williamstown Road, Port Melbourne,  , Australia –, rd Floor, Plot , Splendor Forum, Jasola District Centre, New Delhi – , India  Penang Road, #-/, Visioncrest Commercial, Singapore  Cambridge University Press is part of Cambridge University Press & Assessment, a department of the University of Cambridge.

Letteney’s book thus provides original and thoughtful insight into why the Christianization of Rome matters to intellectual as well as religious history.” – Michele Salzman, University of California, Riverside\n\nPublished online by Cambridge University Press\n\nThe Christianization of Knowledge in Late Antiquity Intellectual and Material Transformations\n\nMARK LETTENEY University of Washington\n\nPublished online by Cambridge University Press\n\nShaftesbury Road, Cambridge  , United Kingdom One Liberty Plaza, th Floor, New York,  , USA  Williamstown Road, Port Melbourne,  , Australia –, rd Floor, Plot , Splendor Forum, Jasola District Centre, New Delhi – , India  Penang Road, #-/, Visioncrest Commercial, Singapore  Cambridge University Press is part of Cambridge University Press & Assessment, a department of the University of Cambridge.

There is a sense in which this book began in , when I was fortunate to read two books that introduced to me a new form of investigation and type of analysis; in parallel but distinct monographs of , Ramsay MacMullen and Fergus Millar each opened doors through which my work has tried to step. The project would not have been possible without their intellectual guidance and it would not have been the same without their personal encouragement that the questions I was asking, and the answers that I sought, were worthwhile. Both Ramsay and Fergus passed before this book went to print; I wish them a peaceful rest, and thank them for their work, their mirth, and their kindness. This project has morphed and grown considerably since my graduate school days, but it began as many ﬁrst books do – advised by a team of extraordinary scholars with whom I am honored to have worked. Elaine Pagels, AnneMarie Luijendijk, Anthony Grafton, Brent Shaw, and Moulie Vidas came together to advise a rather unorthodox project, and I received valuable advice from Martha Himmelfarb and Helmut Reimitz along the way. I consider myself incalculably lucky to have been given the opportunity to sit at the feet of these inimitable scholars, and to learn from each the trade of research, the craft of writing, and the joy of teaching. Each taught me many of the skills on display in this book, but more so they showed me the virtue of academic kindness and the value of attention paid to people as friends and colleagues ﬁrst and foremost, quite apart from the work that we produce. I cannot thank them enough, but I plan to spend the rest of my career trying. xi\n\nPublished online by Cambridge University Press\n\nxii\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThe majority of this book was written in a small ofﬁce on the second ﬂoor of the American Academy in Rome, between sumptuous meals and outings with an extraordinary collection of humanists, artists, and administrators that made my Rome Prize year unforgettable and unimaginably joyous. A great debt of gratitude is due to John Ochsendorf and Lynne Lancaster for overseeing operations and curating an intellectual community from whom I learned immensely and with whom laughed blissfully, including Liana Brent, Allison L. C. Emmerson, Victoria C. Moses, Karyn Olivier, Basil Twist, Austin Powell, Jim Carter, Denis J.-J. Robichaud, Kirsten Valdez Quade, Helen O’Leary, Anna Majeski, Marcel Sanchez Prieto, and Zaneta Hong. The staff of the Vatican Library made working on Chapters  and  smoother than it might have been without their congeniality, and P. Petrus Tschreppitsch OSB and Christine Ottowitz at St. Paul Stift im Lavanttal kindly provided me with high-quality facsimiles of the Ambrose manuscript that serves as a cornerstone my analysis. Thanks is due, as well, to the Provost at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and the MIT Library’s department of Scholarly Communications for providing funds to publish this book Open Access. Clifford Ando offered prescient advice at an early point that colored this project throughout; if it is impactful, it will have been for his insistence that I tackle the question of causation head-on. Mark Vessey and Éric Rebillard each encouraged me to take up questions that they had raised in seminal articles, and their work remains an inspiration. I thank Mary Beard for many spirituous and spirited conversations ﬁlled with erudite suggestions for further reading that have leavened the project as a whole, and Silvia Orlandi for academic and administrative support that allowed me to bring this project to completion in Rome. Two anonymous peer reviewers performed the all too often thankless task of reading and critiquing a manuscript that needed critical eyes and thorough revision. Not only did they offer their considerable expertise and wisdom, but they read the book again, ﬁnding both something ready to be published and what is perhaps best described as a small armada of typos. I cannot thank them enough. Beatrice Rehl took an early and active interest in this project, and showed me the ropes of academic publishing – I thank her for shepherding this book to completion. The Appendix was drafted during an intense and invigorating month at the Centro Studi e Ricerche sui Diritti Antichi in Pavia and is indebted to long conversations, many through late evenings, with Sebastian SchmidtHofner, Bernhard Palme, Boudewijn Sirks, Dario Mantovani, Detlef Liebs, Gisella Bassanelli Sommariva, Benet Salway, Serena Ammirati,\n\nPublished online by Cambridge University Press\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nxiii\n\nLorena Atzeri, Elio Dovere, Marzena Wojtczak, Laurent Cases, Joanna Kulawiak-Cyrankowska, and David Pitz. I was honored to receive time, space, funding, and impetus to revise the Appendix alongside brilliant colleagues and mentors as a recipient of a Premio di merito alla ricerca from the Associazione Internazionale di Studi Tardoantichi. I want to thank Lucio De Giovanni especially for coordinating a wonderful visit to Naples, and to my fellow recipients, with whom it was a joy to celebrate and an honor to learn beside: Julia Aguilar Miquel, Guilhem Bartolotti, Marco Cristini, Miriam Cutino, Emanuela Malafronte, Giulia Marolla, and Simone Mollea. As this project changed and grew over the years, my academic circle expanded; colleagues became interlocutors, and interlocutors became friends. I want particularly to thank Cavan Concannon, Jeremiah Coogan, J. Gregory Given, Joe Glynias, Sarit Kattan Gribetz, Henry Gruber, Amit Gvaryahu, Zachary Herz, Joseph Howley, Caroline Humfress, David Hunter, Yitz Landes, Rachel Love, Jessica Marglin, Irene Soto Marín, Charles Mathewes, Candida Moss, Travis Proctor, Sailakshmi Ramgopal, Michele Renee Salzman, and Jakub Urbanik for reading and strengthening parts of this book through their critique. Matthew D. C. Larsen has been a constant interlocutor, performing the virtuous duty of ﬁrst responder to half-formed thoughts and incipient ideas; all of my work is better for his friendship and his sage advice. All along my family did what families do best (to paraphrase David Sedaris): remind me that I might reinvent myself to colleagues, but to this day I’m still the one most likely to set the house on ﬁre. Stephanie Nelli came into my life only late in this process, but her presence has made it immeasurably sweeter. To all these, and to those whom I’ve inevitably missed, I offer my sincerest gratitude.

A. Judge told his mentor A. H. M.

Augustine reports a conversation between Simplician, bishop of Milan, and the renowned Neoplatonic philosopher Marius Victorinus. The philosopher would often say to the churchman, “You know that I am already a Christian,” and the bishop would reply, “I won’t believe or count you among the Christians until I see you in a church of Christ.” The philosopher offered a sarcastic response, using the Socratic method to point out the absurdity of Simplician’s assertion. Ergo parietes faciunt Christianos? “Oh, is it walls that create Christians?” For many scholars aiming to understand Christianity in the later Roman empire, the answer to Victorinus’s jest is “yes.”\n\n  \n\nBarnes, “Statistics and the Conversion of the Roman Aristocracy.” Brenk, Die Christianisierung der spätrömischen Welt: Stadt, Land, Haus, Kirche und Kloster in frühchristlicher Zeit. “Christianization” as an object of study has its detractors, as well. David Hunt, for instance: Papers and books about Christianising the Roman Empire ought not to be encouraged. The concept is certainly a snare, and very probably a delusion as well. It is so big an aspect of Late Antiquity as to be all but beyond the control of the historian, and admits of so many layers of meaning and varieties of interpretation that it is in danger of becoming meaningless.\n\n \n\nHunt, “Christianising the Roman Empire: The Evidence of the Code,” . Robin Whelan is among the few contemporary scholars approaching the question of Christianization beyond simple allegiance. See especially a recent Journal of Roman Studies article which “considers how the Christian identity of imperial ofﬁcials manifested itself when the Theodosian dynasty ruled the Roman Empire in both East and West.” Whelan, “Mirrors for Bureaucrats: Expectations of Christian Ofﬁcials in the Theodosian Empire,” .

My method, however, diverges from the classic treatments. Rather than asking after numbers of Christians or moral renewal in late ancient Rome, I investigate the methods by which a meaningful truth claim could be made at a particular moment: during the period of ﬂux when Christians ﬁrst came to overtake state institutions with sufﬁcient inﬂuence to effect a dramatic change on the structure of meaning-making in the Roman empire. My goal is to trace shifting practices of knowledge production in the fourth and ﬁfth centuries, paying particular attention to scholastic sources in the domains of theology, historiography, and law. This is to make a rather simple claim, but perhaps one with signiﬁcant implications. There is no “rise of Christianity” beyond the “rise” – increase in social standing and inﬂuence – of large numbers of individual Christians. I argue that investigating a shift in the way that individual, inﬂuential Christians make arguments can offer insight into the rise of Christianity generally because during the years of the Theodosian dynasty the methods of these individual, inﬂuential Christians were taken up across scholarly disciplines by Christians and non-Christians alike, and far beyond the realm of theology. This is a study of what counts as a fact. In trying to understand what counts as a fact, I have done what countless sociologists and historians of science did before me: go to the laboratory where facts are produced and pay close attention to their conjuring. What I’ve found is similar to what historians of science have remarked since the early days of that discipline, namely that “scientiﬁc fact is the product of average, ordinary people and settings, linked to one another by no special norms of communication forms, who work with inscription devices” in the form of “writing, schooling, printing, [and] recording procedures.” “The mysterious thinking process that seemed to ﬂoat like an inaccessible ghost over social studies of science,” Latour writes, “at last has ﬂesh and bones and can be thoroughly examined. The mistake before was to oppose heavy matter . . . to spiritual, cognitive thinking processes instead of focusing on the most ubiquitous and lightest of all materials: the written one.” In his study of Pasteur’s work on a bovine anthrax vaccine, Latour insists that the scientist’s laboratory is a political space – political in so far\n\n\n\nLatour, “Give Me a Laboratory and I Will Raise the World,” .\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009363341.001 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n\n\n\nChristianizing Knowledge\n\nas laboratory results powerfully and fundamentally changed the society into which they were unleashed. But the nature of that change is twofold, and does not consist solely in the solution to a veterinary problem. First, veriﬁcation of the effect of Pasteur’s vaccine required new forms of data to be collected on a national scale and in a novel manner. Knowing whether the vaccine was effective required the expansion of statistical and quantitative methods devised in and for laboratory science to the whole of nineteenth-century French society. Second, the acceptance of such facts, and the economic beneﬁts that compound therefrom, require a lay public to accept a new way of making arguments, presented in forms and formats previously conﬁned to the microcosm of the laboratory. In order for a vaccine’s success to become a “fact,” laboratory methods of knowledge creation and veriﬁcation needed to be governmentally operationalized and then societally accepted. Argumentative forms are notoriously fecund, in this way, escaping from the labs which create them and roaming free through a combination of top-down implementation and bottom-up opportunism. This book studies another time when a novel form of argumentation escaped from the lab. Rather than a microcosm of the farm recreated in a Petri dish, the laboratory that I engage here attempted to form a true micro-cosmos, distilling grand questions of divine ontology to propositional statements, debating those statements, and determining their proper resolution in nuce – or in Nicaea, as it were. These scientists (or in this case we should call them “theologians,” while keeping in mind that their aims and methods were, in their own estimation, fundamentally empirical) engaged a question of how to deﬁne the nature of the deity: what god consisted in, and how the various forms that god takes relate to one another. They created an intellectual lab, overseen by the imperial government and by the deity under discussion, and yet their pronouncements could not be truly universal until and unless their form of knowledge production came to be accepted outside the theological laboratory. Pasteur had an advantage over the scientists of Nicaea: none of his lab mates came to ﬁeld trials intent on denigrating the vaccine, as was the case with dueling factions in the wake of Nicaea. Nevertheless, Pasteur’s ﬁeld trials were not widely acceptable until the physical procedures of the lab were duplicated on a national scale: categorizing outbreaks through microbial sampling, isolating agents in the lab, and registering them on a standardized ledger. The acceptance of a scientiﬁc fact required the world to replicate the methods of the lab in its approach to the production of reliable knowledge. Likewise, the acceptance of a set of theological\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009363341.001 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n\nChristianizing Knowledge\n\n\n\npropositions in the fourth century required both the creation of new procedures for devising reliable theological facts and the widespread acceptance of those argumentative methods. This book tells a story about the creation and implementation of a new way of making theological arguments in Late Antiquity. The forging of a new form of theological praxis is only half of the story, however. In the years after Nicene Christians came to be a ruling elite for the ﬁrst time, their way of making arguments, devised in a lab and aimed at answering a particular (however cosmic) problem, became detached from the question posed and roamed free. I argue that early in the fourth century, Christians adjudicating all sides of the “Nicene controversy” forged new tools for argumentation in the ﬁres of doctrinal controversy. While wrestling over the nature of Christ, these clerics created a new scholastic regime: new arguments were made in novel ways. By the late fourth century, when these Christians came into power as a ruling elite, their approach to truth – how it could be accessed and how it should be presented – was fundamentally different from where it began, and was even more at odds with the prevailing epistemic framework of their Roman Traditionalist neighbors. Nicene Christians had invented a new book culture, but that book culture did not long remain unique to Christian scholars. When Nicene Christians came to power as a political ruling class, this peculiarly Christian argumentative structure found its way quickly into the domains of law, history, miscellany, and even Talmud. One answer to the question of “what difference did Christianity make?” is this: Nicene Christians, ascending to positions of power, changed the way that an entire scholastic culture approached the creation, veriﬁcation, and dissemination of facts. My study pays close attention to the intellectual culture of the Theodosian Age. Or, to borrow terminology from Roger Chartier’s groundbreaking work, I am interested to describe and explain historical \n\nMy argument, it should be made clear, bears no relation to the spate of books and articles over the past decade returning to a Gibbon-esque teleology of Christian decline, decrying the rise of intolerance and violence and the failure of “dialogue” during the years surrounding the Council of Chalcedon in  – on which see importantly Goldhill, The End of Dialogue in Antiquity and Athanassiadi, Vers la pensée unique: la montée de l’intolérance dans l’Antiquité tardive. For a strenuous rejoinder to the latter, see Morlet, “L’Antiquité tardive fut-elle une période d’obscurantisme? À propos d’un ouvrage récent.” More nuanced analyses of the issue of dialogue in Late Antiquity can be found in Lim, Public Disputation, Power, and Social Order in Late Antiquity and a useful counterpoint in van Nuffelen, “The End of Open Competition?

The outline of the cage has an externally coherent logic; it was created in a particular place, with a particular shape, for historically contingent reasons. When later inhabitants forgot why the cage took its shape, the underlying logic moved into the domain of historical knowledge. The cage deﬁnes the boundaries of proper knowledge production. It can be ﬂexed and punctured in places but, at least for the extent of the Theodosian Age, it remained identiﬁably intact. It is possible to glimpse argumentative expectations in two places. They are visible where scholars explicitly discuss what their work sets out to accomplish, and what constitutes the boundaries of “good” work in their technical domain – a long tradition beginning at least with Aristotle, who urged writers, orators, and even ﬂute players to preface their productions with a short discourse on method. Such moments of self-conscious methodological reﬂection are rare in ancient scholarship, but they prove illuminating when available and serve as an anchor for my discussion. Latent expectations about the structure of a good argument are visible in another place as well: in the sum total of scholastic production as it looked and was utilized in the Theodosian Age. Even when scholars are not forthcoming with plain declarations of their methodology, we can see their prejudices and intuitions in the products of their scholarship: the form in which they lay out their arguments, the way that they organize their pages, the places to which they send those pages, and the manner in which they read the work of others who they consider to be peers. If intellectual culture is conceived as a “ﬂexible and invisible cage” that “offers to the individual a horizon of latent possibilities,” with this book I aim to describe the history of the cage itself: how it came to have the shape that it does, and how that shape deﬁned the scholarship produced inside it.\n\n  \n\nChartier, The Order of Books: Readers, Authors, and Libraries in Europe between the Fourteenth and Eighteenth Centuries.

The history of the book can be described as something of a punctuated equilibrium: long stretches of incremental change interrupted by moments of rupture and transition to a new order and a new set of expectations regarding what a book is, how it is to be used, and what potentialities and dangers lie among its leaves. My aim is to describe one such moment of rupture, in which widespread and durable changes in the order of books are visible across seemingly discrete domains of scholarly, technical literature. Material and literary witnesses to the later Roman empire suggest that during the Theodosian Age, scholastic elites developed a distinctly new book culture, one deﬁned by the rise of authorized codes and implicated in the great scholarly productions of the period: the Theodosian Code, the golden age of patristic literature, the renaissance of Latin and Greek historiography, and even the Palestinian Talmud. Changes visible across the Roman literary landscape of the late fourth century played out throughout the subsequent eighty years, and in turn continue to shape contemporary notions of what books do and what one can do with books. The epistemic primacy of written sources in our contemporary world – the notion of a constitutional democracy, for instance – has roots in Rome of the Theodosian Age. In the pages that follow, I endeavor to tell part of that story of transformation. This book, then, attempts to frame the beginning of Late Antiquity as a moment of rupture not only in politics but in praxis. It describes the transition between a late Roman world in which Christians appear as interlopers and a late ancient world in which the structures and ideologies undergirding an ascendant Christianity appear always already part of the fabric of the Jesus movement. There are other transitions to be described: turning points toward a new trajectory that cannot be linearly assimilated to what came before. My work does not describe the only beginning of Late Antiquity, but it describes an important beginning nevertheless. My argument proceeds in stages. Chapter  reﬂects on the interconnected social world of elite readers and writers during the Theodosian dynasty, showing how they comprise a single intellectual culture expressed in different disciplinary domains. The core of the argument comprises two parts. Part I (Chapters –) deals with the history of Christian argumentative forms and the creation of novel intellectual tools\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009363341.001 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n\n\n\nChristianizing Knowledge\n\nin early fourth century, and Part II (Chapters –) considers the proliferation of those tools through diverse domains of scholarship in the late fourth through the middle of the ﬁfth centuries . Chapter  demonstrates the diversity of Christian approaches to truth before the Constantinian Age. I turn to Constantine and Athanasius in Chapter , showing the inﬂuence of each on a new way of making arguments that became widespread throughout the Orthodox Christian movement during the fourth century. Chapter  traces that new, Christian way of making arguments from the realm of theology into “secular” domains during the Theodosian Age, showing how a scholastic method created to solve theological problems came to be used in legal, historical, and scientiﬁc texts of the late fourth and ﬁfth centuries. Chapters – comprise a second unit which describes the implementation of new argumentative forms by Theodosian Age writers and readers in the ways that they approach books and in the manuscripts that they produced, copied, and used. Chapter  focuses on the “rise of the code” and the investiture of the codex format with new meanings when it took center stage as the preferred bookform for scholastic productions. I turn to manuscripts themselves in Chapter , showing ﬁrst the newly instituted scholastic practices that inﬂuenced the production and use of books during the ﬁfth century, and then detailing a number of “Christian” scribal tools that were designiﬁed and reused in “secular” manuscripts of the period in Chapter . Chapter  describes the net effect of scholastic and material changes on the way that Theodosian Age readers approached and interpreted books. A short conclusion offers reﬂections on the project as a whole and the reverberations that Theodosian Age book culture has had down to our present day, and an Appendix presents a detailed case study on the Theodosian Code, showing how language that was peculiar to Christian theological disputation before the Theodosian Age came to be generalized and ultimately to undergird the great juristic achievement of the ﬁfth century.\n\n   Before discussing the interimplication of scholarly domains in the Theodosian Age, I want to offer some observations on method. First, I have distilled a set of characteristics that I argue in detail are part of a class of analysis: a “new order of books.” This class deﬁnition is not exclusive: not every member of the class will possess every characteristic by which the class deﬁned. Put differently: not every attribute of\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009363341.001 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n\nObservations on Method\n\n\n\nTheodosian book culture ﬁnds expression in every example adduced. My deﬁnition of a “new order of books” follows what Ludwig Wittgenstein termed “family resemblances,” or what Rodney Needham calls a “polythetic classiﬁcation.” As a result, the sense in which any particular example speaks to a wider book culture is not static. I hope that my reader will consider the strength of my argument overall, and the relationships between part and whole. Second, I ascribe a certain amount of agency to texts themselves – agency that compounds from the actions of writers, readers, scribes, and bookbinders, and the structure of knowledge that each imposes on or reads from the texts that they encounter. It is in this sense that texts can be agents; in their material form texts reﬂect some intention of their creator, and their form in turn telegraphs to subsequent users a set of argumentative expectations and practices that are related to, but not coterminous with, the intention of the creator. Consider, for instance, a rock wall intended to delineate a property line. The wall indicates materially an imaginary legal boundary dividing an otherwise contiguous tract of land. A subsequent user of this wall may be a group of children who designate the line of the wall as one terminus in a game of hide-and-seek: in this case the intention of the wall’s creator and the later users’ understanding align to a signiﬁcant degree. In Latour’s vocabulary, the rock wall in this example is an intermediary: an object that “transports meaning or force without transformation: deﬁning its inputs is enough to deﬁne its outputs.” Another user of the wall, however, may be a pilot looking to align their plane with the runway ten miles ahead, who knows that the wall happens to sit on the required axis. The old intention of the rock wall remains intact even as a user, the pilot, exploits that structure to new, unforeseen ends. In this scenario the landowner’s agency has found unexpected expression in local ﬂight paths, and that agency is mediated through a rock wall that acts as an agent itself. It is an intermediate agent, but its agency is not passive: it actively orients real-world phenomena. Again in Latour’s framework, in this instance the wall is a mediator: “Their input is never a good predictor of their output; their speciﬁcity has to be taken into account every time. Mediators transform, translate, distort, and modify the meaning or the elements they are supposed to carry.” These are the senses in which    \n\nWittgenstein, Philosophische Untersuchungen, paragraph .

In cases where an author’s intended use of an argument or work line up, more or less, with the way that scribes and readers actualize the material, manuscripts act as intermediaries. This is not always the case, however, because material texts often – perhaps more often than not – work as mediators instead. As Part II argues in detail, their effect on readers can be the result of authorial intention, clever reuses, or unintended eventualities. The passivity of parchment should not be mistaken for a lack of agency. Next, a note on the sources upon which my analysis is built. The literature that I engage here is not popular; the majority of it was obscure technical literature in antiquity, and for the most part it remains so today, even among ancient historians. The “new order of books” that I describe, rooted in an argumentative method inﬂected by the great Christian doctrinal debates of the fourth century, did not extend to the entire population of the Roman empire in the fourth and ﬁfth centuries; perhaps it did not extend in the form that I describe beyond the scholars engaged in intellectual debate under the Theodosian dynasty. A distinction between scholarly productions and those meant for popular consumption is not solely mine, however. This division of literary material between that which is “scholarly” or “elite” and that which is purposefully popular is visible throughout the sources. The Theodosian Code claims explicitly to be intended as a resource for the scholarly efforts “of more industrious people (diligentioribus),” while Ambrose afﬁrmed to his congregation that “the faithful interpreter of the mysteries preaches more through silence” than through divulging to the masses that which is rightly the purview of the scholar. I hope it will become clear over the course of my analysis that the senatorial aristocracy, of which Ambrose and the jurists responsible for the Theodosian Code were part, considered each other to be peers, and intended their work to be engaged and exploited by scholars with like-minded scholastic methods, even when they held divergent substantive commitments. And ﬁnally, a note on “method” itself. It is often observed that historical narratives predicated on case studies and close readings risk mistaking the anecdotal for the universal.

My analysis responds to such critiques with the proliferation of examples, but the central concern will nevertheless remain for readers engaged in more technical, neo-formalist disciplines that ascribe particular and ultimately peculiar motivations to any work if it is scrutinized in sufﬁciently granular detail. I could perhaps produce an extended analysis justifying my use of particular texts and case studies in order to understand a book culture of which the selected texts comprise, at best, only a small part. Such an analysis would focus on movement in social-historical method after the so-called linguistic turn. Or, alternatively, I could offer a quantitative analysis which tabulates each and every instance of the scholastic features that I describe as they appear in Theodosian era scholastic literature. I fear, however, that either option would, in the words of Tomoko Masuzawa, “seem too intricate to be fully credible; it could appear either suspiciously obscure or improbably clever, and in the end, devious and inscrutable.” Instead, I have chosen to begin my project with this chapter, and end with another, in an Appendix. The ﬁrst describes the imbricated nature of elite scholastic discourses during the period under analysis, while my Appendix presents a analysis of interconnections between Christian and juristic scholarship of the fourth and ﬁfth centuries, demonstrating that the analytical method that I propose can be implemented in terms of purely philological analysis, though such a reduction will always involve loss of explanatory value. Again to paraphrase Masuzawa, the aim of this book is to excavate the half-forgotten worries, hopes, and controversies that animated a dramatic shift in the way that readers approached books and the work of scholarship during the Theodosian Age. I cannot ultimately justify the method on purely analytical grounds. Historical research, after all, is not science, and connoisseurship will always play a central role. I cannot hope to convince my reader of a somewhat novel method from the ﬁrst pages of a long, and yet singularly interested, piece of analysis. I hope only that my reader will, for the moment, offer the beneﬁt of the doubt, and test the utility of the analysis only after the work is complete.\n\n \n\nMasuzawa, The Invention of World Religions, Religions, or, How European Universalism Was Preserved in the Language of Pluralism, .

This change in citational form was a revolution in Christian literary practice, and as Vessey has pointed out, “[i]f the conciliar and imperial enactments of – ushered in a new ecclesiastico-doctrinal order, they also heralded a new order of books.” Scholarly description of this “new order of books” in the Theodosian era has only just begun. Vessey compellingly ties the rise of new forms of Christian documentary practice to internal, Christian doctrinal disputes, arguing that new doctrinal concerns among Christians led to new textual forms. His intuition ﬁnds support in the explanation of changes in Christian documentary culture adduced by Christian scholars of the period. In , for instance, Hilary famously wrote that “necessity introduced the custom of deﬁning the faith and of signing on to the deﬁnition (exponi ﬁdes, et expositis subscribi).” But the institution of new citational forms among the Christian scholastic elite did not long remain an internal facet of the Orthodox movement; in  the emperor Gratian was born. It was under his rule that Christians, for the ﬁrst time, rose to enough prominence among the late Roman nobility that their numbers appear in rough parity with those of Roman Traditionalists in the Senate. According to Mark the Deacon, by the reign of Arcadius nearly\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nVessey, “The Forging of Orthodoxy in Latin Christian Literature: A Case Study”; Rebillard, “A New Style of Argument in Christian Polemic: Augustine and the Use of Patristic Citations.” Vessey, “The Forging of Orthodoxy,” .

The Christianization of the empire did not only affect public discourse on what could be true, but also how scholars went about proving the point. In Chapter  I argue that this shift in scholarly practice arose from a tradition of doctrinal argumentation that found ultimate value in deﬁning a universal statement and promulgating that statement as the bounds of Orthodoxy. It is not surprising that other forms of knowledge produced by Christians were presented with a similar structure. It is not surprising, for instance, that a Nicene Christian approach to law would privilege the subordination of a commentarial and multivocal tradition to an authorized statement of legal orthodoxy that looks something like the magisterium vitae, “guide to life,” of which the Theodosian Code was intended as a precursor. Yet modern scholars of Roman law have proven reticent to acknowledge any Christian inﬂuence on the structure of the Code itself, even though the majority of the men compiling Theodosius II’s law code were part of the Christian elite of the Theodosian Age, as I detail later. It is often argued, instead, that the Theodosian Code does no normative, constructive theological work, and thus it is wholly separate from other normative aspects of the Christian culture in which it was produced. I argue, however, that fourth-century debates over Orthodoxy spurred a scholastic shift that deﬁned the contours of a book culture which inﬂuenced the Theodosian Code, as well as works such as the acta of Ephesus and Chalcedon. One may argue that the Theodosian Code is a Christian document whether or not it does constructive theological work because it is built according to scholastic speciﬁcations which arose from of Christian doctrinal dispute, an argument to which I return in the Appendix. Contemporary scholars of each of these corpora often explain changes in the format of documents and readerly expectations during the  \n\nMark the Deacon, Life of Porphyry, .

Changes in legal argumentation result from new legal exigencies, for instance, and shifts in historiographical method can be explained as resulting from an evolution internal to the ancient discipline of history. Rather like Vessey’s understanding of the advent of “patristic commentary,” scholars of rabbinic literature and Roman law habitually resist the suggestion that fundamental innovations in form could be attributable to external, cultural factors, or drift on wider scholastic currents. For example, Seth Schwartz follows generations of rabbinic scholars in arguing that “[t]he Rabbis produced a body of literature unlike anything else ever written in the Roman world. Its alienation or self-alienation from the classical tradition is nearly absolute . . . The Talmud’s status as Roman literature needs to be argued in ways that the status of other literary artifacts of the same time and place does not. The Rabbis proclaimed their alienation from normative Roman culture in every line they wrote.” A similar perspective is common among scholars of Roman law. John Matthews goes to great lengths to cobble together an answer to the question of why, “at this late hour in Roman history [ ],” a codiﬁcation of law should be undertaken. Matthews admits that “with the Theodosian Code . . . we ﬁnd ourselves at such a moment, when a need is felt to make this clear, to sum up an achievement because it forms a part of the perceived aims of a state or because these aims are threatened.” Along with the vast majority of scholars of Roman law, Matthews steadfastly refuses to consider that the “need” for a clear summation of legal Orthodoxy arose only within Christian intellectual culture in which such universal statements of truth, distilled from commentarial and discursive traditions, were in fact quite commonplace. By the time of the Code’s promulgation, Christian scholars had undertaken similar efforts as their central scholastic aim for nearly two generations. Despite an admitted paucity of evidence, Matthews contends instead that political expediency and general unease with the state of the law in the mid-ﬁfth century animated the compilation of the Code. He repeats an orthodoxy among\n\n  \n\nSchwartz, Were the Jews a Mediterranean Society?

In and of themselves, internal explanations for changes in documentary culture and citational practice are not wrong, or even misguided. But in this instance, such explanations fail to account for one simple datum: remarkably similar changes to documentary practice took place across all domains of scholarly literature during the Theodosian Age. It may be the case that similar innovations in the presentation and utilization of textual material coincidentally occurred across traditions simultaneously. However, I argue that in this instance broader changes in cultural expectations of texts – what they are, what the look like, and what they do – simply found varied expressions in different scholarly genres. These cultural expectations were forged in the Christian doctrinal controversies of the fourth century and codiﬁed in the great literary achievements of the ﬁfth. And, importantly, the changes are not limited to the form of arguments, but extend to the format of scholastic manuscripts from the period, as I demonstrate in Part II. This is to say something that, on its face, is rather uncontroversial: that the theologians, jurists, rabbis, and assorted scholars of technical disciplines responsible for the literary remains of the Theodosian era are not sui generis. They were educated alongside peers of elite households, and share reading habits and hermeneutic strategies. Some of these men went into imperial administration, while others went into Church administration. Some argued Christological points with compendia of previous theological debates and pronouncements; many more argued legal points with compendia of previous laws and analysis. Theologians created dossiers of conciliar pronouncements and acta while jurists created compendia of legal statutes and juristic opinions. In the case of two corpora – dossiers of conciliar acta and compendia of legal statutes and juristic opinions – both were compiled in the same court chancery, likely by the same imperial ofﬁcials. As Susanna Elm notes of the Emperor Julian and Gregory of Nazianzus: “Both were entirely men of their time. They shared with each other and their elite contemporaries far more than divided them.” The same could be said of a great number of elite men engaged in late ancient scholarly disciplines. As Blossom Stefaniw rightly observes: “To study  \n\nHarries, “Constantine the Lawgiver,” .

Cognate literatures offer a window on the structure of readerly and writerly expectations, and scholarly disciplines on either side of the redescriptive divide of “theological/secular” are cognate literatures, indeed. This is, I hope, not to ﬂirt with parallelomania. I do not want merely to show that the concerns of one corpus are echoed in another. It is hardly surprising that in some aspects the acta of Chalcedon and the Theodosian Code share similar concerns. Further, it is not surprising that the Palestinian Talmud, a quasi-legal code compiled in the late fourth century, would hold some ideas or issues in common with the other great legal codiﬁcation of its day. Rather, I attempt to demonstrate convergences between these corpora on a structural level – to show that Theodosian Age scholars approached their task of commentary and codiﬁcation with analogous prejudices and expectations about scholarship. These prejudices and expectations were new to the Theodosian era, widespread, and durable. A note on terminology: my distinction between “Christian” and “Juristic” scholarship is not meant to imply that jurists could not be Christians, or that their Christianity was ancillary to their judicial work. Quite the opposite: this book purposefully militates against such bifurcation. Rather, I use the terms in their disciplinary sense: “Christian scholarship” refers to a tradition of theological disputation that the subjects of my analysis considered to have a deﬁnite form of internal coherence. For instance, for Jerome, “Christian scholarship” includes works of the  men whom he deemed “eminent” (illustres) in his explication of the tradition, whether he agreed with their substantive commitments or not. There is no doubt that Jerome conceived of juristic scholarship as a separate domain from the discourse of Christian scholarship exempliﬁed by his “eminent men”: he says as much in Letter ., on which I have more to say later. Many centrally important jurists of the Theodosian court were Christians, and their Christianity inﬂuenced their scholarly production in the same way that Ambrose’s legal training inﬂects his own works of Christian scholarship. Likewise there is no doubt that the professorship of jurisprudence endowed by Theodosius II and Valentinian III in  was awarded to a professing Nicene Christian.  \n\nStefaniw, Christian Reading: Language, Ethics, and the Order of Things, .  Jerome, On Eminent Men.

Both were equally domains of scholarship, or what Caroline Humfress has called “specialist form[s] of imperial prose literature.” When I distinguish between “Christian” and “Juristic” work in the Theodosian empire, I invoke this emic distinction. One intention of this book is to clarify the extent of interimplication of scholastic domains in the Theodosian Age, especially between Christian and juristic scholarship, but also including other areas of literary expertise: history, medicine, military science, and Jewish law. Because of the nature of the comparison and the nature of contemporary scholarship on each domain, I proceed through my argument in two steps. I begin by focusing on the shared book culture evident in of the Theodosian Age which was primarily undertaken by Christians and Traditionalists, distilling from the extant sources an overview of the “new order of books” as well as speciﬁc, discrete innovations that populate the literary landscape of the late fourth and ﬁfth centuries. I turn to rabbinic sources only at the end of my analysis, offering a reading of the Palestinian Talmud in Chapter  contextualized by the convergences visible between scholarship in the other domains of Theodosian scholarship. I have two reasons to proceed in this manner. First, avenues of exchange, to which I turn shortly, are signiﬁcantly clearer between theologians and jurists than among any other scholastic group. The extent and nature of their contact is explicit. On the other hand, as Schwartz argued earlier, rabbis formally disclaim the type of cultural inﬂuence that we can see between theologians, jurists, and a wider Roman book culture. The nature of exchange among scholars in the domains of theology, law, history, etc. is reasonably clear; in the case of the rabbis, contact is somewhat more diffuse, and perhaps involved less reciprocity between groups. Second, this is a book with a comparative methodology, and as such it is particularly prone to muddy waters in which the distinctiveness of corpora dissolve into a puddle of similarity without obvious implication. Comparison is always carried out with reference to a background of similarity, between three objects of inquiry. In order for a comparison  \n\nHumfress, “Ordering Divine Knowledge in Late Roman Legal Discourse,” .

In this case, comparison between scholars working in and around the various imperial courts will help to clarify the substratum of identity, which I identify as components of the “Theodosian order of books” – facets shared between the technical literature of each that arose from a shared intellectual culture. Subsequent comparison with rabbinic material offers a crucible in which to test hypotheses regarding the scholastic environment of the later Roman empire, and its separate discussion is intended to guard against the multiplication of exempla that disbands any useful or rigorous basis for analysis. Only after establishing a “new order of books” can the concepts that it comprises be used as a basis upon which to ask whether rabbinic material truly takes part in the same book culture as other literate Romans in the Theodosian Age. If the Roman rabbinic material, in turn, shares distinctive aspects of Theodosian book culture that differ from what is found in other instantiations of the genre, like the Sassanian recension of the Talmud, then such correlations point to a distinctive and shared book culture between scholars of all stripes living in the later Roman empire.\n\n   I am hardly the ﬁrst historian to suggest that theologians and jurists beneﬁted from similar training, and that they brought to their divergent tasks a similar textual habitus. Texts from the Theodosian Age demonstrate this clearly. For instance, the Collatio legum Mosaicarum et Romanarum comprises an importation of Roman juristic writing and legal pronouncements into a Christian framework, and amply demonstrates its compilers’ interest in rectifying Roman juristic and biblical scholarship as separate but compatible domains of inquiry. Jerome, too, speaks regularly and learnedly of the Roman juristic tradition, expecting his interlocutors at least to understand his references, such as one in Epistle  ( ), where he announces that “Caesar’s laws differ from Christ’s. Papinian prescribes one thing, and our own Paul \n\nOften referred to as the Lex dei. The collection, admittedly, may be of Jewish origin. Nevertheless Robert Frakes has made a compelling case for the document arising out of Christian circles, likely in Rome between  and .

Lines of transmission, however, do not lead invariably from the elite, “secular” culture of law to the specialized, “sacred” culture of Christian theological disputation. Noel Lenski has shown conclusively with a case study on the Arian controversy that the distinction between doctrinal and legal disputation had already become meaningless by the beginning of the fourth century, during Constantine’s own reign: [I]nsofar as doctrinal disputes truly mattered to the late antique mindset, and indeed they did, in many ways they simply constituted yet another arena of contention that took its place alongside more traditional ﬁelds of competition like wealth, status, euergetic display, and rhetorical or intellectual showmanship. Peer polity interaction/rivalry thus simply absorbed Christian credal dispute as an additional arena within which the new local leaders could vie for power and prestige.\n\nOne hundred years before the compilation of the Theodosian Code, when the empire, by the most generous estimates, was around  percent populated by people identifying as Christian, civic and theological \n\n  \n\n\n\nAliae sunt leges Caesarum, aliae Christi; aliud Papinianus, aliud Paulus noster praecipit.

By the time that more Christians were members of the Roman senate than Roman Traditionalists another half century had passed, Theodosius I had ascended to the purple, and a new era of Christian and juristic scholarship was on the horizon. John Matthews argues that it was precisely the early years of the reign of Theodosius I in which we see the full dissolution of any meaningful distinction between the emperor’s religious and legislative agendas. I add here that the distinction between agendas fails to mark a difference, but so does a distinction between imperial staffs.
