In 2019 Philipp started working in the group of Ivan Dikic as an intern, before he officially started his Ph.D. project. He moved on in 2020.\n\nRajeshwari studied Microbiology at Bikaner University, India, and completed her Ph.D. at the National Chemical Laboratory, Pune. During her Ph.D. she focused on Biomarker discovery in Prediabetic clinical subjects and the mechanism of Insulin resistance, and to perform this, she used different mass spectrometry platforms. Rajeshwari joined the Dikic group in March 2021 and worked in the field of Targeted Protein Degradation (TPD). She is working on various Proxidrugs projects where she performs characterization of Target protein degraders like Molecular Glue and PROTACs using Proteomics. She left the group and returned to India at the end of 2022.\n\nRukmini worked as a PhD student in the lab of Dr Oishee Chakrabarti at the Saha Institute of Nuclear Physics, Kolkata. She submitted her Ph.D. thesis on E3 ligases and their importance in mitochondrial homeostasis in December 2016. Following this, she worked in the lab of Dr Tony Hunter at the Salk Institute, California. She has joined the Dikic group in October 2017 and worked on ADP-ribosylation of ubiquitin in mammalian cells. She finished her projects and moved on in 2023.\n\nSantosh has completed his PhD from Center for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB), Hyderabad, India under the supervision of Dr. Rajan Sankaranarayanan and which was funded by DST-INSPIRE (Dept. of Science and Technology, India) fellowship. His Ph.D. thesis was mainly focused in deciphering the “Mechanism and Physiological Role of Chiral Proofreading Modules Involved in Translation of the Genetic Code”. In the process of his Ph.D. training, he has acquired expertise in the field of structural and molecular cell biology. After a brief postdoc in India, Santosh moved to Germany to join the Dikic group to pursue the structural and physiological consequences of phosphoribosyl-ubiquitination. He move on in 2023.\n\nStefan studied medicine at the University of Zagreb, Croatia, where he obtained his MD studying the role of BMP 1-3 signaling in bone fracture healing. He continued his scientific interest by joining the Dikic group in 2014 for 2 years, while he was focused on the characterization of the newly identified protein SPRTN and identified its essential role in DNA damage repair as a protease that cleaves DNA-protein-crosslinks. Subsequently he started his clinical and neurologic career first as a resident at the Clinic for Neurosurgery for 2 years and since 2019 at the Clinic for Neurology at the Goethe-University. He is in parallel continuing his scientific work at the Dr. Senckenberg Institute for Neurooncology and after achieving a fellowship from the Goethe-University Patenschaftsmodell he rejoined the Dikic group for 2020 to study the role of SPRTN and DNA-protein-crosslinks in brain tumors.\n\nVéronique did her Ph.D. in joint supervision between the University of Basel (Switzerland) and the University of Strasbourg (France), investigating the role of endogenous neurosteroids in regulating neurodegenerative processes. Afterward, Véronique worked in the group of Michel Goedert (MRC - Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Cambridge, UK), where she developed and characterized a transgenic mouse model of TDP-43 proteinopathy. She also conducted another project investigating the effect of autophagy stimulation on neurodegeneration in a mouse model of tauopathy. Véronique joined the group of Ivan Dikic, where she investigated autophagic pathways in the context of neurodiseases. She left the group in 2018.\n\nIn July 2016 Wenbo obtained his master degree in Institute of Biophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, where he received preliminary training in the field of cryo-electron microscopy(cryo-EM). Afterwards Wenbo initiated his PhD study in Max-Planck-Institute of Biophysics and researched the structures of rabbit ryanodine receptor 1 (RyR1) in native membrane by cryo-EM, he will finish his PhD study in August 2020 and join the Dikic lab as postdoc researcher since September 2020. Wenbo will carry out structural studies of important proteins involved in autophagy and ubiquitylation by cryo-EM.\n\nYi-Lin obtained her Bachelor and Master degree in Department of Medical Laboratory Science and Biotechnology, National Cheng Kung University, Taiwan. Afterwards, she received her PhD degree in Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, National Cheng Kung University, Taiwan in 2016. Following this, she studied on the mechanism of defective xenophagy of group A streptococcus in endothelial cells supervised by Dr. Jiunn-Jung Wu and Dr. Yee-Shin Lin as a postdoctoral fellow in Department of Biotechnology and Laboratory Science in Medicine, National Yang Ming University, Taiwan. With great interest in the autophagy field, Yi-Lin joined the Dikic group as a postdoctoral researcher investigating the role of ER-phagy in Salmonella infection in September 2019. In August 2022, she moved to Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, National Cheng Kung University, Taiwan as an assistant professor and study the role of exosomes in bacterial infection and sepsis."
