Patterson\n\nThe Gospel of Thomas ranks among the most important manuscript discoveries in the last two hundred years. The debate it unleashed in the 1950s, when scholars first got a glimpse of the new gospel, continues unabated today. It has reshaped the discussion of Christian origins by introducing students of early Christianity to a new set of ideas and practices that, a generation ago, one could hardly imagine as deriving from the words of Jesus. And the words of Jesus themselves have fallen under renewed scrutiny in view of Thomas’ new witness to the shape and scope of the Jesus tradition. Scholars now find themselves debating basic aspects of the mission and message of Jesus because of the way the Gospel of Thomas presents the sayings of Jesus. It consists entirely of sayings of Jesus arranged in a simple list. There are no miracles here, no stories of Jesus’ birth, death, or resurrection from the dead. It presents itself as the secret teaching of the living Jesus. For some, the new gospel has become the holy grail of all we ever thought, or wanted to believe, about Jesus. For others it is nothing but a deviant cast-off from the more reliable main-stream of canonical voices enshrined in the New Testament itself. Controversy has courted it from the day it was discovered.\n\nIt was discovered in 1945 as part of a larger collection of\n\nancient books known as the Nag Hammadi Library, so-named for\n\nviii I ntro ducti o n the modern-day city of Nag Hammadi, which lies close to the site of this remarkable discovery. An Egyptian peasant happened upon this collection of books while rummaging around in the talus at the base of the cliffs that line the Nile River in Upper Egypt. There they had lain, sealed in a large, rough clay jar, for more than fifteen centuries, until time and the shifting of rocks and sand had exposed them to view. Scholars would eventually learn that the jar contained thirteen papyrus books, or codices, dating to the fourth century, C.E. They are written in Coptic, a form of the ancient tongue of Pharonic Egypt in use when Christians first came to Egypt in the late first or early second century. These early Christians used the Greek alphabet (together with a few characters unique to Coptic) to create a written form of this language, into which Christian works composed in Greek could be translated for use among the local population. The Nag Hammadi texts all share this history: they are Coptic translations of Greek originals made by Christian scribes for use in Egypt.\n\nWithin the thirteen volumes of the Nag Hammadi Library\n\nwere found almost fifty previously unknown or lost texts. Most of them are Christian tracts, though there are a number of Jewish texts, and at least one Greek philosophical text – a section of Plato’s Republic. Thus, the Nag Hammadi Library ranks among the major manuscript discoveries of the twentieth century of relevance to biblical studies. But by far the most important of the Nag Hammadi texts is the second tractate in Codex II of the Library: the Gospel of Thomas. Its discovery was quite astonishing, for here was a gospel known to have existed in antiquity, but long lost in the deep mists of history, presumably never to be heard from again. And yet here it was. Before, its content could only be guessed at. Now scholars could see that it contains approximately one hundred and fourteen sayings of Jesus, usually presented in the form of a\n\nI ntro ducti o n\n\nix\n\nbrief chreia – that is, a short vignette in which Jesus speaks a word of wisdom. A good number (about half) of these sayings were already known, since they are found also in the canonical gospels, principally in Matthew, Mark, and Luke. Of the remaining sayings, a few were known from an occasional reference or odd quote from Thomas found scattered in the literature of early Christianity. But the discovery of the Gospel of Thomas brought to light dozens of new sayings of Jesus – and with them the question: could any of these sayings also be authentic sayings of Jesus?\n\nThis was not the first time a manuscript discovery had\n\nbrought to light new sayings of Jesus. Fifty years earlier, about 120 kilo­meters southwest of Cairo, two young British archaeologists made what should be considered one of the most remarkable finds in the history of archaeological discovery. B. P. Grenfell and A. S. Hunt were in their twenties, and labouring through their first season at Oxyrhynchus, where a dry climate and some ancient trash heaps made it a promising place to look for ancient payri. Indeed it was. A young Bernard Grenfell managed to capture a little of the excitement and romance of their expedition when he penned the following account for an 1897 issue of McClure’s magazine: On January 11th we sallied forth at sunrise with some seventy workmen and boys, and set them to dig trenches through a mound near a large space covered with piles of limestone chips, which probably denotes the site of an ancient temple, though its walls have been all but entirely dug out for the sake of the stone. The choice proved a very fortunate one, for papyrus scraps began to come to light in considerable quantities, varied by occasional complete or nearly complete private and official documents containing letters, contracts, accounts, and so on; and there were also a number of fragments written in uncials,\n\nx I ntro ducti o n or rounded capital letters, the form of writing used in copying classical or theological manuscripts. Later in the week Mr. Hunt, in sorting through the papyri found on the second day, noticed on a crumpled uncial fragment written on both sides the Greek word KARFOS (“mote”), which at once suggested to him the verse in the Gospels concerning the mote and the beam. A further examination showed that the passage in the papyrus really was the conclusion of the verse, “Thou hypocrite, cast out first the beam out of thine own eye, and then shalt thou see clearly to pull out the mote that is in thy brother’s eye;” but the rest of the papyrus differed considerably from the Gospels, and was, in fact, a leaf of a book containing a collection of sayings of Christ, some of which, apparently, were new. More than that could not be determined until we came back to England.1\n\nLater that year, back in Oxford, Grenfell and Hunt were able to examine the leaf more carefully. What they found, in addition to the familiar saying from the Sermon on the Mount, were what appeared to be a series of sayings of Jesus, some of them unknown until this chance discovery. They read: J(esu)s says: “If you do not fast to the world, you will not see the kingdom of God; if you do not observe the Sabbath as a sabbath, you will not see the f(athe)r.” And then further: J(esu)s says: “I stood in the midst of the world and appeared to them in the flesh. I found them all drunk. I found none of them thirsty. And my soul ached for the sons of men, because they are blind in their hearts and do not have sight…”. In all, there turned out to be eight sayings of Jesus inscribed on the front and back of this papyrus scrap, originally a page from a papyrus book or codex. Six of them had not been read for fifteen centuries. This was Papyrus Oxyrhynchus 1. When Grenfell and Hunt published a popular account of their find later that year it would sell more than\n\nI ntro ducti o n\n\nxi\n\n30,000 copies.2 In subsequent seasons Grenfell and Hunt would discover other papyri containing previously unknown sayings of Jesus, including Papyrus Oxyrhynchus 654 and 655. Until the 1950s they were known simply as “the unknown sayings of Jesus.” But that all changed with the discovery of the Gospel of Thomas, for it turned out that Grenfell and Hunt’s unknown sayings were in fact bits and pieces of the Gospel of Thomas. Papyrus Oxyrhynchus 1 contained parts of what we now know as Gospel of Thomas 26–33, 654 contained fragments of sayings 1–7, and 655 contained sayings 36–39.\n\nThe Oxyrhynchus papyri notwithstanding, the Coptic Gospel\n\nof Thomas from Nag Hammadi remains to this day our only complete version of this gospel. Thus, when one speaks of the Gospel of Thomas, it is usually to the Coptic version that one is referring. The first critical edition of the Coptic Gospel of Thomas appeared in 1959, just in time for the Christmas rush3, and promptly sold over 40,000 copies. This very popular version of Thomas became the scholarly standard for many years to come, even though it was produced before scholarship had advanced very far in understanding the textual problems in the manuscript and the many translational difficulties posed by the text. Since then, scholars have continued to study Thomas, and theiradvances have made it possible to produce new and improved texts and translations of this important document of early Christianity.\n\nWe are pleased to offer, within the present volume, a translation\n\nof Thomas that we believe represents the culmination of the best scholarship on Thomas, gathered over many years in the same centre of research that produced the initial edition of Thomas, Berlin. Out of that early flurry of activity there emerged a team of scholars with the disarming self-designation: The Berlin Working Group for Coptic Gnostic Writings. Originally founded by Hans-Martin\n\nxii I ntro ducti o n Schenke, it is led today by Schenke’s former student, Hans-Gebhard Bethge. The Berlin Working Group continues to be one of the most important centres for the study of the Nag Hammadi texts. It is therefore not surprising that, as the fruit of more than a generation of concentrated work, they have produced a critical Coptic text of the Gospel of Thomas that is superior to any previously available. Furthermore, their translation into German and English provides the most reliable access to the sayings themselves. Their original Coptic text and translations are available in the newer editions of Kurt Aland’s Synopsis Quattuor Evangeliorum, published by the German Bible Society.4\n\nIn the 1990s we decided to make the work of the Berlin\n\nWorking Group available to a wider audience in the first edition of this book. In that volume, published in 1998, we used the text and translation of the Gospel of Thomas that appeared in the 1996 edition of Aland’s Synopsis. Since that time, the Working Group has continued to revise and refine its translation for various publications, including subsequent editions of the Synopsis, the standard German-language translation of the Nag Hammadi Library, the Nag Hammadi Deutch, and the latest edition of Hennecke and Schneemelcher’s Neutestamentliche Apokryphen. In addition, important studies have emerged, such as Uwe-Karsten Plisch’s recent commentary, from which helpful insights into the text and translation might be gleaned.5 All of these developments are reflected in the latest updated version of the Working Group’s text and translation, printed in the most recent edition of the Aland Synopsis.\n\nAs in 1998, our intention in issuing this revised edition of The\n\nFifth Gospel is to offer the scholar and layperson alike a tool for the study of the Gospel of Thomas that reflects the best work of the Berlin Working Group through the years. The text and translation\n\nI ntro ducti o n\n\nxiii\n\nare taken from the Synopsis Quattuor Evangeliorum (15th edition, 3rd corrected printing, 2001, revised 20096), with a few noted improvements from the authors. As in the original edition, the following standard sigla will alert the reader to problems and editorial decisions reflected in the text: ( ) Parentheses surround words not in the Coptic text itself, but those which an English reader needs in order to catch the tone of the original. < > Pointed brackets surround a word or words where the translation involves the correction of an error in the manuscript. [ ] Square brackets indicate places where a hole in the manuscript had led to the loss of one or more letters. Often the team is able to supply the missing letters by conjecture; other times they must be left blank. In such cases a series of dots may indicate approximately how many characters are missing. { } Curly brackets indicate that the translators have omitted something that occurs in the original manuscript on the suspicion that it is in error. In addition to the revised translation of Thomas, we have once again provided two essays for those who may be unfamiliar with this new gospel, or with the events that led to its discovery and publication. The first (by Patterson) is a revised version of the essay that first appeared in this volume in 1998, “Understanding the Gospel of Thomas Today.” It is intended to provide a general introduction to current scholarly thinking on the interpretation of this gospel. The second (by Robinson) is unchanged from the original\n\nxiv I ntro ducti o n 1998 edition. It tells the story of the discovery of the Nag Hammadi Library, recounts the subsequent work of bringing the new gospel to light, and assesses how the Nag Hammadi discovery has changed the landscape of New Testament scholarship. As before, it is hoped that these essays will initiate the general reader to the discussion of this new text, and indicate avenues for further investigation. For those who are interested in reading more about Thomas and the Nag Hammadi Library, we have also provided a brief annotated list entitled “Further Reading.”\n\nC H A P T E R\n\n1\n\nRevised English Translation1\n\nIntroduction Saying 1 These are the hidden words that the living Jesus spoke. And Didymos Judas Thomas wrote them down. And he said: “Whoever finds the meaning of these words will not taste death.” Saying 2 (1) Jesus says2: “The one who seeks should not cease seeking until he finds. (2) And when he finds, he will be dismayed. (3) And when he is dismayed, he will be astonished. (4) And he will be king over the All.” Saying 3 (1) Jesus says: “If those who lead you say to you: ‘Look, the kingdom is in the sky!’, then the birds of the sky will precede you. (2) If they say to you: ‘It is in the sea’, then the fish will precede you. (3) Rather, the kingdom is inside of you and outside of you.” (4) “When you come to know yourselves, then you will be known, and you will realize that you are children of the living Father. (5) But if you do not come to know yourselves, then you exist in poverty and you are poverty.”\n\n2\n\nR e v ised E nglish T ranslati o n1\n\nSaying 4 (1) Jesus says: “The person old in his days will not hesitate to ask a child seven days old about the place of life, and he will live. (2) For many who are first will be last. (3) And they will become a single one.” Saying 5 (1) Jesus says, “Come to know what is in front of you, and that which is hidden from you will become clear to you. (2) For there is nothing hidden that will not become manifest.” Saying 6 (1) His disciples questioned him, (and) they said to him, “Do you want us to fast? And in which way should we pray and give alms? And what diet should we observe?”3 (2) Jesus says, “Do not lie. (3) And do not do what you hate. (4) For everything is disclosed in view of 4. (5) For there is nothing hidden that will not become revealed. (6) And there is nothing covered that will remain undisclosed.” Saying 7 (1) Jesus says, “Blessed is the lion that a person will eat and the lion will become human. (2) And cursed is the person whom a lion will eat, and the lion will become human.”5 Saying 8 (1) And he says, “The human being is like a sensible fisherman, who cast his net into the sea, (and) drew it up from the sea filled with little fish. (2) Among them, the sensible fisherman found a large fine fish. (3) He threw all the little fish back into the sea, (and) readily chose the large fish.\n\nR e v ised E nglish T ranslati o n1\n\n3\n\n(4) Whoever has ears to hear should hear.” Saying 9 (1) Jesus says: “Look, a sower went out. He filled his hands (with seeds), (and) he scattered (them). (2) Some fell on the path. The birds came and pecked them up. (3) Others fell on rock and did not take root in the soil, and they did not sprout up ears into the sky. (4) And others fell among the thorns, they choked the seeds, and the worm ate them. (5) And others fell on good soil, and it produced good fruit, yielding sixty per measure and one hundred and twenty per measure (of crop).” Saying 10 Jesus says: “I have cast fire upon the world, and see, I am guarding it until it blazes6.” Saying 11 (1) Jesus says: “This heaven will pass away and the (heaven) above it will pass away. (2) And the dead are not alive, and those who are alive will not die. (3) In the days when you consumed what was dead, you made it alive. When you are in the light, what will you do? (4) On the day you were one, you became two. But when you become two, what will you do?” Saying 12 (1) The disciples said to Jesus: “We know that you will depart from us. Who (then) will rule7 over us?” (2) Jesus said to them: “ (No matter) where you came from, you should go to James the Just for whose sake heaven and earth came into being.”\n\n4\n\nR e v ised E nglish T ranslati o n1\n\nSaying 13 (1) Jesus said to his disciples: “Compare me and tell me whom I am like.” (2) Simon Peter said to him: “You are like a just messenger8.” (3) Matthew said to him: “You are like an (especially) wise philosopher.” (4) Thomas said to him: “Teacher, my mouth not bear at all to say whom you are like.” (5) Jesus said: “I am not your teacher. For you have drunk, (and) you have become frenzied from the bubbling spring that I have measured out.” (6) And he took him, withdrew, (and) he said three words to him. (7) But when Thomas came back to his companions, they asked him: “What did Jesus say to you?” (8) Thomas said to them: “If I tell you one of the words he said to me, you will pick up stones (and) throw them at me, and fire will come out of the stones (and) burn you up.” Saying 14 (1) Jesus said to them: “If you fast, you will bring forth sin for yourselves. (2) And if you pray, you will be condemned. (3) And if you give alms, you will do harm to your spirits.”9 (4) “And if you go into any land and wander from place to place10, (and) if they accommodate you, (then) eat what they will set before you. Heal the sick among11 them! (5) For what goes into your mouth will not make you unclean. Rather, what comes out of your mouth will make you unclean.” Saying 15 Jesus says: “If you see someone who was not born of woman, fall on your face (and) worship him. That one is your Father.”\n\nR e v ised E nglish T ranslati o n1\n\n5\n\nSaying 16 (1) Jesus says: “Perhaps people think that I have come to cast peace upon the earth. (2) But they do not know that I have come to cast dissension upon the earth: fire, sword, (and) war. (3) For there will be five in one house: there will be three against two and two against three, the father against the son, and the son against the father. (4) And they will stand as solitary ones.” Saying 17 Jesus says: “I will give you what no eye has seen, and what no ear has heard, and what no hand has touched, and what has not occurred to the human mind.”12 Saying 18 (1) The disciples said to Jesus: “Tell us how our end will be.” (2) Jesus said: “Have you already discovered the beginning that you are now asking about the end? For where the beginning is, there also will be the end. (3) Blessed is he who will stand at the beginning. And he will know the end, and he will not taste death.” Saying 19 (1) Jesus says: “Blessed is he who was before he came into being. (2) If you become disciples of mine (and) listen to my words, these stones will serve you. (3) For you have five trees in Paradise that do not sway in summer (nor) winter, and their leaves do not fall. (4) Whoever will come to know them will not taste death.”\n\n6\n\nR e v ised E nglish T ranslati o n1\n\nSaying 20 (1) The disciples said to Jesus: “Tell us what13 the kingdom of heaven is like!” (2) He said to them: “It is like a mustard seed. (3) 14 is the smallest of all seeds. (4) But when it falls on soil that is cultivated, it (the soil) produces a large branch (and) it (the branch) becomes a shelter for the birds of the sky.” Saying 21 (1) Mary said to Jesus: “Whom are your disciples like?” (2) He said: “They are like servants15 who are entrusted with a field16 that is not theirs. (3) When the owners of the field arrive, they will say: ‘Let us have our field.’ (4) (But) they are naked17 in their presence in order to let them have have them (i.e., their clothes18) so that they give them their field.” (5) “That is why I say: When the master of the house learns that the thief is about to come, he will be on guard before he comes (and) will not let him break into his house, his domain19, to carry away his possessions. (6) (But) you, be on guard against the world! (7) Gird your loins with great strength, so that the robbers will not find a way to get to you.” (8) “For the necessities for which you wait (with longing) will be found.20 (9) There ought to be a wise person among you! (10) When the fruit was ripe, he came quickly with his sickle in hand, (and) harvested it. (11) Whoever has ears to hear should hear.” Saying 22 (1) Jesus saw little (children) being nursed.21 (2) He said to his disciples: “These little ones being nursed22 are like those who enter the kingdom.”\n\nR e v ised E nglish T ranslati o n1\n\n7\n\n(3) They said to him: “Will we enter the kingdom as little ones?” (4) Jesus said to them: “When you make the two into one and when you make the inside like the outside and the outside like the inside and the above like the below, – (5) that is, to make the male and the female into a single one, so that the male will no longer be male and the female no longer female – (6) and when you make eyes instead of an eye and a hand instead of a hand and a foot instead of a foot, (and) an image instead of an image23, (7) then you will enter [the kingdom].” Saying 23 (1) Jesus says: “I will choose you, one from a thousand and two from ten thousand. (2) And they will stand as a single one.” Saying 24 (1) His disciples said: “Show us the place where you are, because it is necessary for us to seek it.” (2) He said to them: “Whoever has ears should hear! (3) Light exists inside a person of light, and he24 shines on the whole world. If he25 does not shine, there is darkness.” Saying 25 (1) Jesus says: “Love your brother like your life! (2) Protect him like the apple of your eye!” Saying 26 (1) Jesus says: “You see the splinter that is in your brother’s eye, but you do not see the beam that is in your (own) eye. (2) When you remove the beam from your eye, then you will see clearly (enough) to remove the splinter from your brother’s eye.”\n\n8\n\nR e v ised E nglish T ranslati o n1\n\nSaying 27 (1) “If you do not abstain from the (entire) world26, you will not find the kingdom. (2) If you do not make the (entire) week into a Sabbath27, you will not see the Father.” Saying 28 (1) Jesus says: “I stood in the middle of the world, and in flesh I appeared to them. (2) I found all of them drunk. None of them did I find thirsty. (3) And my soul ached for the children of humanity, because they are blind in their heart, and they cannot see; for they came into the world empty, (and) they also seek to depart from the world empty. (4) But now they are drunk. (But) when they shake off their wine (frenzy), then they will change their mind.” Saying 29 (1) Jesus says: “If the flesh came into being because of the spirit, it is a wonder. (2) But if the spirit (came into being) because of the body, it is a wonder of wonders.” (3) Yet I marvel at how this great wealth has taken up residence in this poverty. Saying 30 (1) Jesus says: “Where there are three gods, they are gods.28 (2) Where there are two or one, I am with him.” Saying 31 (1) Jesus says: “No prophet is accepted in his (own) village.

(2) For no one lights a lamp (and) puts it under a bushel, nor does he put it in a hidden place. (3) Rather, he puts it on a lamp stand, so that everyone who comes in and goes out will see its light.” Saying 34 Jesus says: “If a blind (person) leads a blind (person), both will fall into a pit.” Saying 35 (1) Jesus says: “It is not possible for someone to enter the house of a strong one ([and] which [do not] care nor) take it by force unless he binds his hands. (2) Then he will loot his house.” Saying 36 Jesus says: “Do not worry from morning to evening and from evening to morning about what you will wear.”30 Saying 37 (1) His disciples said: “When will you appear to us, and when will we see you?” (2) Jesus said: “When you undress (yourselves) without being ashamed31 and take your clothes (and) put them under your feet like little children, (and) trample on them, (3) then [you] will see the son of the Living One, and you will not be afraid.”\n\n10\n\nR e v ised E nglish T ranslati o n1\n\nSaying 38 (1) Jesus says: “Many times you have desired to hear these very words that I am speaking to you, and you have no one else from whom to hear them.

(2) Neither have they entered, nor did they let enter those who wished to (enter). (3) You, however, be as shrewd as serpents and as innocent as doves!” Saying 40 (1) Jesus says: “A grapevine was planted outside (the vineyard) of the Father. (2) And since it is not supported, it will be pulled up by its root (and) will perish.” Saying 41 (1) Jesus says: “Whoever has (something) in his hand, (more) will be given to him. (2) And whoever has nothing, even the little he has will be taken from him.” Saying 42 Jesus says: “Become passers-by.” Saying 43 (1) His disciples said to him: “Who are you to say this to us?” (2) “Do you not realize from what I say to you who I am?\n\nR e v ised E nglish T ranslati o n1\n\n11\n\n(3) But you have become like the Jews: They love the tree, (but) they hate its fruit.

(2) And whoever blasphemes against the Son, it will be forgiven him. (3) But whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit, it will not be forgiven him, neither on earth nor in heaven.” Saying 45 (1) Jesus says: “Grapes are not harvested from thorns, nor are figs picked from thistles, for they do not produce fruit. (2) A good person brings forth good from his treasure. (3) A bad person brings forth evil from the bad34 treasure that is in his heart, and (in fact) he speaks evil. (4) For out of the abundance of the heart he brings forth evil.” Saying 46 (1) Jesus says: “From Adam to John the Baptist, among those born of women there is no one who surpasses John the Baptist so that his (i.e. John’s) eyes need not be downcast35.” (2) “But I have (also) said: ‘Whoever among you becomes little will know the kingdom and will surpass John.’” Saying 47 (1) Jesus says: “It is impossible for a person to mount two horses and to stretch two bows. (2) And it is impossible for a servant to serve two masters, or else he will honor the one and insult the other.” (3) “No person drinks old wine and immediately desires to drink new wine.\n\n12\n\nR e v ised E nglish T ranslati o n1\n\n(4) And new wine is not put into old wineskins, so that they do not burst; nor is old wine put into (a) new wineskin, so that it does not spoil it.

For you will find the kingdom. (2) For you come from it (and) will return to it.” Saying 50 (1) Jesus says: “If they say to you: ‘Where are you from?’, (then) say to them: ‘We have come from the light, the place where the light has come into being by itself, has established [itself] and has appeared in their (pl.) image.’ (2) If they say to you: ‘Is it you?’37, (then) say: ‘We are his children, and we are the elect of the living Father.’ (3) If they ask you: ‘What is the sign of your Father among you?’, (then) say to them: ‘It is movement and repose.’” Saying 51 (1) His disciples said to him: “When will the 38 of the dead take place, and when will the new world come?” (2) He said to them: “That (resurrection) which you are awaiting has (already) come, but you do not recognize it.”\n\nR e v ised E nglish T ranslati o n1\n\n13\n\nSaying 52 (1) His disciples said to him: “Twenty-four prophets have spoken in Israel, and all (of them) have spoken through you39.” (2) He said to them: “You have pushed away the Living One from you, and you have begun40 to speak of the dead.” Saying 53 (1) His disciples said to him: “Is circumcision beneficial, or not?” (2) He said to them: “If it were beneficial, their Father would beget them circumcised from their mother. (3) But the true circumcision in the spirit has prevailed over everything41.” Saying 54 Jesus says: “Blessed are the poor. For the kingdom of heaven belongs to you.” Saying 55 (1) Jesus says: “Whoever does not hate his Father and his mother cannot become a disciple of mine. (2) And whoever does not hate his brothers and his sisters (and) will not take up his cross as I do, will not be worthy of me.” Saying 56 (1) Jesus says: “Whoever has come to know the world has found a corpse. (2) And whoever has found (this) corpse, of him the world is not worthy.” Saying57 (1) Jesus says: “The kingdom of the Father is like a man who had (good) seed. (2) His enemy came by night. He sowed weeds among the good seed. (3) The man did not allow (the slaves) to pull out\n\n14\n\nR e v ised E nglish T ranslati o n1\n\nthe weeds. He said to them: ‘Lest you go to pull out the weeds (and then) pull out the wheat along with it.’”42 (4) For on the day of the harvest the weeds will be apparent43 and will be pulled out (and) burned.” Saying 58 Jesus says: “Blessed is the man who has struggled44. He has found life.”45 Saying 59 Jesus says: “Watch out for the Living One while you are alive, so that you will not die and (then) seek to see him. And you will not be able to see (him).”46 Saying 60 (1) a Samaritan who was trying to take (away) a lamb47 while he was on his way to Judea. (2) He said to his disciples: “That (man) is pursuing the lamb48.” (3) They said to him: “So that he may kill it (and) eat it.” (4) He said to them: “As long as it is alive he will not eat it, but (only) when he has killed it (and) it has become a corpse.” (5) They said: “He cannot do it in any other way.” (6) He said to them: “You, too, look for your resting place so that you may not become a corpse (and) get eaten.” Saying 61 (1) Jesus said: “Two will rest on a lounge. One will die, the other will live.” (2) Salome said: “ (So) who are you, man? You have gotten a place on my lounge as a 49 and you have eaten at my table.” (3) Jesus said to her: “I am the one who comes from the One who\n\nR e v ised E nglish T ranslati o n1\n\n15\n\nis (always) at one with himself. I was given some of that which is my Father‘s.” (4) “I am your disciple!” (5) Therefore I say: “If someone is 50, he will become full of light. But if someone is not at one with himself, he will become full of darkness.” Saying 62 (1) Jesus says: “I tell my secrets to those who [are worthy] of [my] secrets.” (2) “Whatever your right hand will do, your left hand should not know what it is doing.” Saying 63 (1) Jesus says: “There was a rich man who had many possessions. (2) He said: ‘I will use my possessions so that I might sow, reap, plant, (and) fill my storehouses with fruit so that I will not lack anything.’ (3) This was what he was thinking in his heart. And in that night he died. (4) Whoever has ears should hear.” Saying 64 (1) Jesus says: “A man had guests. And when he had prepared the dinner, he sent his slave so that he might invite the guests. (2) He came to the first (man and) said to him: ‘My master invites you.’ (3) He said: ‘I have money due from some merchants. They are coming to me this evening.

Since I am going to collect the rent, I will not be able to come. Excuse me.’ (10) The servant went away. He said to his master: ‘Those whom you invited to dinner have asked to be excused.’ (11) The master said to his servant: ‘Go out to the streets. Bring (back) whomever you find, so that they might have dinner.’ (12) Dealers and merchants [will] not enter the places of my Father.” Saying 65 (1) He said: “A [usurer]51 owned a vineyard. He gave it to some farmers so that they would work it (and) he would receive its fruit from them. (2) He sent his slave52 so that the farmers would give him the fruit of the vineyard.

(2) If you do not have that within you, (then) that which you do not have within you [will] kill you.” Saying 71 Jesus says: “I will [destroy this] house and no one will be able to rebuild it [except me].”57 Saying 72 (1) A [man said] to him: “Tell my brothers that they have to divide my Father’s possessions with me.” (2) He said to him: “Man, who made me a divider?” (3) He turned to his disciples (and) said to them: “I am not a divider, am I?” Saying 73 Jesus says: “The harvest is plentiful but there are few laborers.

(2) That merchant is prudent. He sold the goods (and) bought the pearl alone for himself. (3) You too seek the treasure that does not perish, that stays where no moth comes near to eat (it), and (where) no worm destroys (it).” Saying 77 (1) Jesus says: “I am the light that is above all. I am the All. The All came forth out of me. And to me the All has come.” (2) “Split a piece of wood (and) I am there. (3) Lift the stone, and you will find me there.” Saying 78 (1) Jesus says: “Why did you go out to the countryside? To see a reed shaken by the wind, (2) and to see a man dressed in soft clothing [like your] kings and your persons61 of rank?

(2) But whoever has found the (dead) body, of him the world is not worthy62.” Saying 81 (1) Jesus says: “Whoever has become rich shall be king. (2) And whoever has power shall renounce63 (it).” Saying 82 (1) Jesus says: “Whoever is near me is near the fire. (2) And whoever is far from me is far from the kingdom.” Saying 83 (1) Jesus says: “The images are visible to a person, but the light within them is hidden in the image. (2) {}64 The light of the Father will reveal itself, but his image is hidden by his light.” Saying 84 (1) Jesus says: “When you see your likenesses you are full of joy. (2) But when you will see your likenesses that came into existence before you – they can neither die nor become manifest – how much will you bear?” Saying 85 (1) Jesus says: “Adam came from a great power and great wealth.\n\n20\n\nR e v ised E nglish T ranslati o n1\n\nBut he did not become worthy of you.

(2) But the son of man has no place to lay his head down (and) to rest.” Saying 87 (1) Jesus said: “Wretched is the body that depends on a body. (2) And wretched is the soul that depends on these two.” Saying 88 (1) Jesus says: “The messengers65 and the prophets will come to you, and they will give you what belongs to you. (2) And you, in turn, give to them what is in your hands (and) you say to yourselves: ‘When will they come (and) take what belongs to them?’” Saying 89 (1) Jesus says: “Why do you wash the outside of the cup?

Patterson The Discovery of a New Gospel Discoveries in the world of Biblical Studies are always exciting. The books of the Bible are ancient texts, shrouded in the mysteries of the remote past, a time and place about which we know precious little. We long for more information, any tidbit of evidence that might open up one more shadowy corner of the ancient world to our eager eyes. New discoveries excite us because they hold out the promise and possibility for disclosure, although rarely do the greatly heralded discoveries of the past live up to our inflated expectations of them. The discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls is an exceptional case, as are a handful of less well-known discoveries, such as the Chester Beatty and the Bodmer papyri.\n\nThe discovery of the Nag Hammadi Library in December 1945\n\nfalls into this rare category of astounding finds. The hero of the story, narrated by James M. Robinson in the final chapter of this volume, was an Egyptian peasant by the name of Muḥammad Ἀlī al-Samman, who happened upon this remarkable cache of texts sealed in an ancient clay jar, buried for safe keeping at the base of the cliffs that run along the Nile in upper Egypt, near the presentday town of Nag Hammadi.1 In the years since Muḥammad Ἀlī’s chance find in the dry sands of Egypt, it has become clear that this\n\nU nderstanding the G o spel o f T h o mas T o day\n\n27\n\nis one discovery that has lived up to its promise. Among the many reasons that allow one to make this claim, none is more significant than the second tractate in codex two of the Nag Hammadi Library, the text known today as the Gospel of Thomas.\n\nThe Gospel of Thomas was not always known by this name.\n\nHalf a century before the famous discovery at Nag Hammadi, two British explorers, B. P. Grenfell and A. S. Hunt, had actually found fragments of this lost gospel among the ancient papyrus rubbish heaps of Oxyrhynchus, some 200 kilometers downstream from Nag Hammadi. But these fragments held only a few sayings of the Gospel of Thomas, and no title nor any indication of where the sayings might have come from. Grenfell and Hunt called them simply “Sayings of Our Lord,” “New Sayings of Jesus,” and a “Fragment of a Lost Gospel.”2 With the discovery of the new text from Nag Hammadi, it soon became clear that what Grenfell and Hunt had discovered were actually fragments of the lost Gospel of Thomas.3\n\nThe Gospel of Thomas turned out not to be like the better-\n\nknown gospels from the New Testament. Perhaps the most striking difference is the fact that in this gospel there is no narrative to speak of. It tells no story of Jesus’ life. Rather, it is simply a collection of Jesus’ sayings, each introduced by the simple formula “Jesus says.”4\n\nThe one complete copy of the Gospel of Thomas we possess\n\nfrom Nag Hammadi has 114 such sayings. This copy, however, may not be identical to the original Gospel of Thomas. For one thing, it is a translation into Coptic of a more original, Greek version of this text, of which Grenfell and Hunt’s Oxyrhynchus fragments are a reminder. Coptic is a written form of late Egyptian used by the Christians who brought Christianity to Egypt in the second century. It uses the Greek alphabet (together with a few unique characters to represent the Egyptian sounds not found in Greek) to give\n\n28\n\nU nderstanding the G o spel o f T h o mas T o day\n\nexpression to the native Egyptian language commonly spoken, but rarely written during this period. Thus, our sole surviving complete copy of Thomas is actually a missionary’s translation. The Greek fragments of Thomas discovered by Grenfell and Hunt are linguistically closer to the original. But the texts they represent were not identical to the Coptic version from Nag Hammadi. For example, one Greek fragment, POxy 1, lists Saying 30 and part of Saying 77 from the Coptic version in consecutive order. Another fragment, POxy 655, offers a version of Saying 36 that is much longer than the same saying in the Coptic text. One of the reasons for such differences may be the fact that the Gospel of Thomas is a sayings collection. As a simple collection, unlike the more complicated narrative texts of the Bible, Thomas would have been much more malleable and susceptible to change over the course of its transmission, as new sayings were added or sloughed away, expanded, contracted, or shifted around as usefulness dictated. There may have been many versions of the Gospel of Thomas at one time or another. The three Oxyrhynchus fragments of Thomas actually come from three different copies of the text, made at different times. The earliest of these (POxy 1) was created early in the third century.5 The Coptic version of Thomas from Nag Hammadi was created sometime in the fourth century, but may itself be an adaptation of an earlier Coptic text that was written in a different dialect of the Coptic language.6 Thus we know that Thomas enjoyed a long history of popularity in upper Egypt. Over the course of this history, and in the years it circulated prior to its arrival in Egypt, the Gospel of Thomas was probably altered many times.\n\nThe Gospel of Thomas, as a sayings collection, was not unique\n\nin the ancient world. In fact, such collections were rather common. The students of well-known philosophers, such as Epicurus or\n\nU nderstanding the G o spel o f T h o mas T o day\n\n29\n\nEpictetus, often collected the sayings of their teachers into gnomologia, or collected words of insight, which they might then use as they evangelized the public in the market places and streets of the ancient city. This practice extended across cultures in antiquity. Jews, Egyptians, Persians, and other peoples of the Mediterranean basin also gathered the proverbial wisdom of their sages into collections of logoi sophon, or sayings of the wise.7 In the Jewish tradition one finds such collections embedded, for example, in the book of Proverbs, or in the inter-testamental books, the Wisdom of Solomon, or the Wisdom of Jesus ben Sirach. The gathering of Jesus’ sayings into such a collection was therefore not a neutral activity. It placed him among the great sages of Israel’s history. He was, as the writer of the Wisdom of Solomon might have said, one of those holy souls found in each generation, into whom the goddess Wisdom sends her spirit to make them friends of God and prophets (Wis Sol 7:27).\n\nWho Wrote the Gospel of Thomas? The opening lines of the Gospel of Thomas read as follows: These are the hidden words which the living Jesus spoke. And Didymos Judas Thomas wrote them down. (Thom. Prologue)\n\nThe collection of these sayings is ascribed to a certain Didymos Judas Thomas, or in the Greek original (see POxy 654) simply “Judas, who is also called Thomas.” This is a curious name. Only one part of it is a bona fide given name: Judas. Didymos and Thomas are simply the Greek and Semitic words for “twin,” respectively. Originally the writer was identified as Judas Thomas (that is,\n\n30\n\nU nderstanding the G o spel o f T h o mas T o day\n\nJudas the Twin); later someone added the Greek word for twin for audiences unfamiliar with the Semitic word thoma. In any event, our purported scribe is Judas the Twin. Who was he?\n\nThe name Judas Thomas belongs to a well-known apostolic\n\nfigure from eastern Syria, where he appears in a number of works, including the Acts of Thomas, the Book of Thomas the Contender, the Doctrines of Addai, and Ephraem’s Sermons on Faith. He also appears in the legendary accounts of how the gospel was brought to Edessa narrated by Eusebius: it was Judas Thomas who sent the apostle Thaddaeus to Edessa to fulfill a promise Jesus had made to King Abgar to send a disciple who could heal him.8 In another version of this story, it is Judas Thomas himself who is sent to Edessa. By this same account his body was entombed in a shrine in Edessa, where pilgrims could come to venerate him.9 In the Acts of Thomas he is the apostle sent to evangelize the east, and travels to India. After his martyrdom there, legend has it that his bones were transported back to “the west,” presumably Edessa.10 Thus it was that the Christians of eastern Syria came to regard Judas Thomas as the founding apostle of the church there.\n\nWith a name like Judas, one can imagine that those who revered\n\nhim would want to distinguish him from the other, infamous apostle with whom he shares this name. So, in the list of apostles found in chapter 1 of the Acts of Thomas he appears as “Judas of James,” meaning probably Judas the brother of James. He also carries this designation in Luke’s apostolic lists (Luke 6:16 and Acts 1:13), and in John he is called simply “Judas, not Iscariot” (14:22), to make clear the distinction. He is also probably the apostle to whom the Epistle of Jude (Ioudas) is attributed.\n\nBut he also shares the second half of his name, Thomas, with\n\nanother famous disciple, “doubting Thomas” (from John 20), and this has also caused some confusion over the years. In the Syrian\n\nU nderstanding the G o spel o f T h o mas T o day\n\n31\n\nChristian tradition, the apostle Judas Thomas was not the same person as the doubting Thomas encountered in John 20. This can be seen in Syriac versions of John, where “Judas, not Iscariot” is called Judas Thomas and not associated with the apostle Thomas in chapter 20. This is also clear from the Acts of Thomas, where the apostle Thomas also appears in the same list of disciples that concludes with the name Judas of James. As the story begins, it is this Judas who is the protagonist and main character of the story, not Thomas.11 In fact, this work should rightly be called the Acts of Judas Thomas, just as our gospel should rightly be called the Gospel of Judas Thomas. Over time, the Christian tradition seems to have shied away from apostles named Judas – even as modern interpreters refer to the Epistle of Jude, not Judas – and so he became simply “Thomas.” This is perhaps why the later colophon title affixed to the end of our gospel reads simply “Gospel According to Thomas,” rather than Judas Thomas.\n\nBut just who was this Judas Thomas, or Judas the Twin? In\n\nchapter 13 of the Acts of Thomas Jesus appears in the guise of Judas Thomas but explains: “I am not Judas who is also called Thomas, but his brother.” Thus, in this early Syrian tradition, Judas Thomas appears to have been a brother of Jesus. This, of course, calls to mind the curious fact that in Mark 6:3 we find named among the brothers of Jesus a certain “Judas.” Could it be that the Gospel of Thomas intends to claim as its author Judas, the brother of Jesus?12 Perhaps so. In Saying 12 of the gospel, the authority of another brother of Jesus is invoked, namely, “James the Just”: The disciples said to Jesus, “We know that you will depart from us. Who is to become preeminent among us?” Jesus said to them, “Wherever you have come from, you are to go to James the Just, the one for whom heaven and earth came into being.”\n\n32\n\nU nderstanding the G o spel o f T h o mas T o day\n\nWe do not know how or why these two brothers of Jesus came to be associated with this gospel. But it seems clear enough that the claims to authority being made here go beyond mere apostolic authority, and include family ties as well. Nonetheless, these claims must be assessed critically. Was this text really written by Judas Thomas, the brother of Jesus? Probably not. In all likelihood, Jesus’ brothers, all from the same peasant family of hand-workers in Nazareth, would not have been literate. Moreover, it is unlikely that the Gospel of Thomas, a simple list of sayings, was composed at a single stroke, but compiled over time, with materials added or deleted as time and circumstance dictated. Over the years it may have had many curators, including the fourth century Egyptian monks to whom we owe the sole surviving complete exemplar of the gospel in Coptic. It therefore seems best not to attach too much historical significance to the text’s own authorial claims and to assume that the authorship asserted in the opening line is pseudonymous.\n\nWhere Was the Gospel of Thomas Written? As we have seen, the name Judas Thomas, or Didymos Judas Thomas, is to be found primarily in early Christian texts associated with eastern Syria. In early Christianity it may be observed that often the name of a particularly prominent leader will come to have significance within a distinct geographic region. Peter, for example, was associated with Rome, John with Asia Minor, James with Jerusalem, and so forth. Whether such associations are grounded in an historical memory of the evangelization of that area, or are purely legendary, is difficult to say. Judas Thomas was apparently the patron apostle for eastern Syria, particularly the area around the ancient city of Edessa, modern Urfa, in far eastern Turkey. As\n\nU nderstanding the G o spel o f T h o mas T o day\n\n33\n\nsuch, it seems reasonable to assume that the Gospel of Thomas came originally from eastern Syria.13\n\nYet all of the Syrian sources in which we find evidence for the\n\nJudas Thomas tradition post-date the Gospel of Thomas by at least a century, and more. This raises the question of whether the Gospel of Thomas was simply heir to the Syrian Judas Thomas tradition, or in fact pre-dates it. Could the Gospel of Thomas have even played a role in bringing this tradition to Syria in the first place? After all, as a collection of Jesus’ sayings, much of the material in the Gospel of Thomas would have come originally from out of the early Jesus movement in Palestine. Furthermore, Thomas 12 grants considerable authority to “James the Just,” that is, James the brother of Jesus, who is thought to have been a leader in the early church in Jerusalem (see Gal 1:19). And in Eusebius’ version of the Abgar legend, Judas Thomas himself is an authority figure, not in Edessa, but in the Jewish homeland, from where he sends out emissaries, like Thaddeus.14 Thus, it may be that the Gospel of Thomas was originally assembled not in Syria, but further west, in Christian circles active in and around Jerusalem. Later it may have been transported to the east, where it became the basis for the subsequent flowering of the Judas Thomas tradition in Syria.\n\nWhen Was the Gospel of Thomas Written? Thomas is difficult to date with any precision. The problem lies with the nature of the text itself: it is a sayings collection. As I have already indicated, this means that as a document Thomas would have been much more malleable than the better-known canonical gospels. It is this malleability that poses the greatest difficulty in reaching any consensus about when this text might have been written. The problem is quite simple: a collection of sayings cannot\n\n34\n\nU nderstanding the G o spel o f T h o mas T o day\n\nbe dated in the same way as a novel or treatise, where the creation of the whole composition in all its constituent parts might be located within a relatively limited time frame. In a sayings collection such as Thomas, the sayings themselves might well stem from quite disparate time periods; some originating with Jesus himself, others having been coined a century or more later. Therefore, one should probably not try to date Thomas in the same way that one might date a text like the Gospel of Mark. Rather, one should ask about the history of the Gospel of Thomas: When did it begin? How did it continue? Did it ever end?\n\nWhen did it begin? There are several indications that some\n\nversion of the Gospel of Thomas may have existed relatively early, before the end of the first century. The sayings collection as a literary form belongs to the earliest period of Christian literary activity, as evidenced by the so-called Synoptic Sayings Source, or Q, a collection of sayings and parables used by Matthew and Luke in the composition of their respective gospels. Another, shorter example of this literary form may be the collection of parables found in Mark 4. The fate of these two examples of the genre is instructive: neither survived as an independent document; rather, both were absorbed into the narrative genres favoured by Christians in the latter part of the first century. In the second century a new form of gospel emerged, in which a risen Jesus imparts esoteric knowledge to elect apostles who then are to disseminate it to other electi. The older sayings forms were taken up and developed in this genre as well. In any event, for reasons that will perhaps never be entirely clear, the simple sayings collection as a gospel form seems to have passed out of fashion after the first century.\n\nAn original date before the end of the first century is also\n\nsuggested by the way various authority figures appear in Thomas.15 In Thom. 12 James is appealed to as an authority. In Thom. 13\n\nU nderstanding the G o spel o f T h o mas T o day\n\n35\n\nanother authority is lifted up: (Judas) Thomas. Other apostles do not fare so well, however. In Thom. 13, Thomas is exalted, but Peter and Matthew must play the fool, unable to understand the real significance and identity of Jesus. This suggests a time in early Christianity when local communities still appealed to the authority of particular well-known leaders from the past to guarantee the reliability of their claims, even while rejecting the rival claims of others and their apostolic heroes. The rather pointed criticism of Matthew and Peter in Thom. 13 suggests that perhaps the author of this saying has the Gospel of Matthew in view, and the particular form of Christianity associated with it. This sort of rivalry seems more at home in the first century than later. As apostolic history gradually faded into the distant past, such apostolic-inspired rivalries seem to have quieted – or shifted to other flash-points – as the apostles themselves became revered figures of that remote time of sacred origins. Perhaps Luke made the first step in this direction. In Acts, written around the turn of the first century or perhaps slightly later,16 the twelve have become heroes of the early church, only a little less in stature than Jesus himself. And old rivalries, even as fierce as that which existed between Peter and Paul, are smoothed out. In Acts, Paul accepts the Jerusalem church’s position on circumcision (Acts 16:3), and Peter accepts the Pauline position on eating with Gentiles (Acts 10). The Gospel of Thomas, with its raw display of apostolic rivalries, probably originated before this period of accommodation.\n\nFinally, there is the way in which Jesus himself is treated in\n\nthis collection. Throughout the collection, one is hard pressed to find an instance in which Jesus is referred to as using any of the Christological titles that became ever more prominent as the early followership of Jesus grew into a full fledged religious movement.17 He is not the “Son of Man,”18 or the “Son of God,” the “Messiah”\n\n36\n\nU nderstanding the G o spel o f T h o mas T o day\n\nor “Christ,” or even the “Lord.”19 He is just Jesus. Of course, the content of many of Thomas’ sayings imply a view of Jesus that was more exalted than this lack of Christological titles would suggest. Nonetheless, their absence is indicative of a generally early, rather than late, time frame.\n\nAll of this suggests that some form of the Gospel of Thomas\n\nalready existed before the end of the first century. This does not mean, however, that everything we now see in this gospel derives from this early period. There is evidence that over time this gospel did indeed grow and change, as newer sayings were added or older sayings were changed. A good example of a newer saying in Thomas is Thom. 7, a mysterious logion that reads as follows: (1) Jesus says: “Blessed is the lion, that a person will eat and the lion will become human. (2) And anathema is the person whom a lion will eat and the lion will become human.”\n\nThis odd image fits into the religious environment one finds among the ascetic monks of upper Egypt in the second century and later, where the lion had come to symbolize the human passions those ascetics fought to resist. It was probably added to the collection some time after it had come to Egypt and been adopted by Christian ascetics living there.20 Other sayings in Thomas show how traditions that may have themselves been very old, were nonetheless changed over the course of their transmission under the influence of other texts and traditions, such as the canonical gospels. A good instance of this is to be found in Thom. 65–66. Thom. 65 is a version of the Parable of the Tenants found also in Mark 12:1–12, and its parallels in Matthew and Luke. The Thomas version is distinctive in that here the parable is a true parable; it has not been secondarily allegorized, as is the\n\nU nderstanding the G o spel o f T h o mas T o day\n\n37\n\ncase with the Markan version. In this sense, it derives ultimately from a stage in the Jesus tradition that predates the Gospel of Mark. However, even though Thom. 65 has none of the allegorical features of Mark’s more developed version, it is followed in the collection curiously by Thom. 66, a citation of Ps 118:22. This is the psalm that Mark just happens also to append to his version of the parable (Mark 12:10b-11) to complete his allegorical reading of it. For Mark, Jesus is the rejected stone of the psalm. Since Thomas has no apparent interest in reading the parable allegorically, there is no real reason for the psalm to appear together with the parable in Thomas. Indeed, in Thomas they are presented as separate sayings, each introduced by “Jesus says,” so that one is not explicitly directed to read them together. Still, the location of the psalm directly after the parable in Thomas seems to be too much of a coincidence not to suppose that one of the synoptic versions of this parable has exercised an influence on the formation of the Thomas text.21\n\nSo not everything in the Gospel of Thomas comes from the\n\nfirst century. And not everything in Thomas that does come from this early period remained unchanged and free from the influence of other texts and traditions. As generations of scribes tinkered and tweaked this tradition, influence from any number of directions would have exercised an effect on the text of Thomas. It is unlikely that we will be able to sort out all the intertextual possibilities with certainty. Thus, we must be content for now with a more general picture. The genesis of the Gospel of Thomas probably lies in the last decades of the first century, when sayings collections were still current, apostolic pedigrees were still disputed, and Jesus was still sometimes just “Jesus.” But this collection grew and changed. Scribes were probably still adding and altering things when the Coptic version we now possess was copied in the fourth century by a monk in upper Egypt. The interpreter of Thomas\n\n38\n\nU nderstanding the G o spel o f T h o mas T o day\n\nmust always hold open the possibility of various time frames for individual logia.22\n\nThomas and Early Christian Social Radicalism Early Christianity was a diverse phenomenon. From its very inception, the followership of Jesus comprised disparate groups that came in various ways to understand Jesus as significant for their lives, and for many, determinative for their understanding of who God is. Based on what we read in the Gospel of Thomas, what can be said about the sort of Christianity (if one may rightly call such early followers of Jesus “Christians” at all) that is reflected here?\n\nThose who used this gospel must have embraced an attitude\n\nabout conventional life and the world around them that can only be described as ‘socially radical’. The Thomas Christians were not alone among the followers of Jesus in coming to this understanding of the significance of Jesus’ life and teaching. In fact, in recent years the study of the synoptic gospels and their antecedent traditions has shown that, among the earliest followers of Jesus, it was quite common to find this sort of social radicalism. Gerd Theissen initiated the study of this aspect of the early Jesus movement and coined a term to describe it: “Wanderradikalismus,” or “wandering radicalism.”23 According to Theissen, the early Jesus movement included many who embraced an itinerant lifestyle in imitation of the itinerant life of Jesus himself. This is the origin and context within which such familiar sayings as this would have been remembered: [Foxes have] their holes and birds have their nest. (2) But the son of man has no place to lay his head down (and) to rest. (Thom. 86; cf. Matt 8:20//Luke 9:58 [Q])\n\nU nderstanding the G o spel o f T h o mas T o day\n\n39\n\nThese early itinerants would have left behind conventional family life, of which they had become critical: (1) Jesus says: “Whoever does not hate his father and his mother cannot become a disciple of mine. (2) And whoever does not hate his brothers and his sisters (and) will not take up his cross as I do, will not be worthy of me.” (Thom. 55; cf. Matt 10:37–38//Luke 14:26–27 [Q])\n\nThey would also have become critical of common piety, distinctions of clean and unclean, and purity as a means of validating human worth and belonging: “There is nothing outside a person which by going in can defile….” (Mark 7:15; Matt 5:11; Thom. 14:5). They embraced those who had fallen out of the mainstream of society into the realm of human expendability: Jesus says: “Blessed are the poor. For the kingdom of heaven belongs to you.” (Thom. 54; cf. Matt 5:3//Luke 6:20b [Q]) Blessed are you who hunger, for you will be fed. (Matt 5:6//Luke 6:21a [Q]; cf. Thom. 69:2) Blessed are you who are hated and persecuted… (Matt 5:10–11//Luke 6:22 [Q]; cf. Thom. 68)\n\nThey characterized wealth as useless: (1) [Jesus says:] “If you have money, do not lend (it) out at interest. (2) Rather give [it] to the one from whom you will not get it (back).” (Thom. 95:1–2; cf. Matt 5:42//Luke 6:30, 34–35 [Q])\n\n40\n\nU nderstanding the G o spel o f T h o mas T o day\n\nIn the Jesus tradition this unconventional and critical view of the world comes to expression especially in the parables of Jesus – those brief narratives set in the common life of the Galilean peasant, in which the unusual strains of Jesus’ new kingdom of God are played out. A rich man invests all he has in storing up resources for the future, and then suddenly he dies (Thom. 63; cf. Luke 6:12–20); another aspires to host a great feast for his friends, but they all stand him up, so he decides to befriend the common crowd and open his table to anyone (Thom. 64; cf. Luke 14:16–23; Matt 22:2–13); another owns a vineyard, but loses everything – his property, his honour, and his son – when the tenants rebel and take over (Thom. 65; cf. Mark 12:1–11, pars.). Thomas embraces these parables of social comment and critique with minimal elaboration. Other parables in Thomas celebrate unconventional choices: the fisher, who sacrifices all the fish in his net to possess one exceptionally large and beautiful fish (Thom. 8; cf. Matt 13:47–8); a merchant who sells all to buy a single pearl for himself (Thom. 76; cf. Matt 13:45–46); a sower who sows willy-nilly and still manages to raise a crop (Thom. 9; cf. Mark 4:3–8). Still others liken the kingdom to a weed – the mustard (Thom. 20; cf. Mark 13:31–2, pars.) – or to the proverbially unclean leaven (Thom. 96; cf. Luke 13:20–1; Matt 13:33). The parable, as a wisdom form, seems to have been particularly well-suited to the kind of unconventional view of the world that was cultivated among those who prized the Gospel of Thomas. In the parables they could hear their own values and view of the world come to expression.\n\nThe Theology of the Gospel of Thomas Those who used this gospel did not simply rely on the original words of Jesus to fund an unusual way of life. They, no less than anyone else who created and used gospels in nascent Christianity, were interpreters of\n\nU nderstanding the G o spel o f T h o mas T o day\n\n41\n\nJesus, not just recipients of his teaching. Their interpretive fingerprints may be seen throughout this collection of Jesus’ sayings. Even the form of this gospel – the sayings collection – says much about the direction their interpretive efforts took. As we have already noted above, the fact that Thomas is a sayings collection places it within a well-used genre of ancient literature – logoi sophon, or “sayings of the wise,” as James M. Robinson has called it. The Thomas Christians believed in the power of words, and in the wisdom of words to guide their lives. Much of what they valued could be captured in simple every-day proverbs that embodied the most common of insights. For example: Jesus says: “If a blind (person) leads a blind (person), both will fall into a pit.” (Thom. 34)\n\nOr: Jesus says, “No prophet is accepted in his own village. A physician does not heal those who know him.” (Thom. 31)\n\nOr: It is impossible for a person to mount two horses and to stretch two bows. And it is impossible for a servant to serve two masters. Else he will honour the one and insult the other. (Thom. 47:1–2)\n\nHowever, the important questions of life are sometimes not so simply answered. What if, for example, one’s experience of the world is not conventional? What if one feels alienated or out of\n\n42\n\nU nderstanding the G o spel o f T h o mas T o day\n\nplace in the world? This was true of many followers of Jesus, who on the one hand had come to embrace his socially radical critique of common life, and on the other had seen how the world had treated him. The apostle Paul offers a good example of someone who felt this way. The wisdom teaching he was developing within the Jesus movement was far from conventional. He writes: Yet among the mature we do impart wisdom, although it is not a wisdom of this age or of the rulers of this age, who are doomed to pass away. But we impart a secret and hidden wisdom of God, which God decreed before the ages for our glorification. None of the rulers of this age understood this; for if they had, they would not have killed the lord of glory. (1 Cor 2:6–8)\n\nThe Gospel of Thomas shares this negative attitude toward the world. In fact, the very next words from Paul’s pen in the passage just cited are a saying that is also found also in the Gospel of Thomas, but presented in Thomas as a saying of Jesus: But, as it is written, “What no eye has seen, nor ear heard, nor the human heart conceived, what God has prepared for those who love him,” God has revealed to us through the spirit. (1 Cor 2:9)\n\nCompare: Jesus said, “I will give you what no eye has seen, what no ear has heard, what no hand has touched, and what has not arisen in the human heart.” (Thom. 17)\n\nU nderstanding the G o spel o f T h o mas T o day\n\n43\n\nWhat Thomas and Paul share is the conviction that the world is not as it seems. To know it – to really know it as it is – one must attend not simply to conventional proverbial wisdom, but to the true wisdom that is revealed from God. In the Gospel of Thomas, Jesus is the bearer of such revelation. Of the world, he says: “Whoever has come to know the world has found a corpse. And whoever has found (this) corpse, of him the world is not worthy.” (Thom. 56)\n\nOr: (1) “If you do not abstain from the world, you will not find the kingdom. (Thom. 27:1)\n\nThe Gospel of Thomas does not hold the world in high esteem. It is a dead place, a mere corpse, unworthy of the followers of Jesus who have the misfortune to dwell in it. How does one come to understand the world in such terms? Paul came to such an understanding through his experience of the world as a place hostile to the utopian vision he had gained from Christianity – a vision he expected to come to fruition very soon, when Jesus would return to earth as the Son of Man to initiate the final apocalyptic drama. Paul gave expression to his frustration with the world by embracing an apocalyptic world view.\n\nThomas Christians did not think this way. Instead, they embraced\n\na world view that is more akin to what one finds in the Gospel of John. John’s view of the world was also hostile. “If the world hates you, know that it hated me before it hated you,” says Jesus to his disciples in John’s “Farewell Discourse” (John 15:18). And so Jesus departs from the world to go to another place, where his followers, too, will someday go:\n\n44\n\nU nderstanding the G o spel o f T h o mas T o day\n\nIn my Father’s house are many rooms. If it were not so I would have told you. I go now to prepare a place for you. And when I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and will take you to myself, that where I am you may be also. (John 14:2–3)\n\nThis is very much like the view we find in Thomas. In Thomas, too, Jesus appears as one who has come to redeem his followers and lead them to another world. Just as John’s Jesus comes into a world that “received him not” (John 1:11), so also in the Gospel of Thomas Jesus expresses his disappointment with what he finds in the world: (1) Jesus says: “I stood in the middle of the world, and in flesh I appeared to them. (2) I found all of them drunk. None of them did I find thirsty. (3) And my soul ached for the children of humanity, because they are blind in their heart, and they cannot see; for they came into the world empty, (and) they also seek to depart from the world empty. (4) But now they are drunk. (But) when they shake off their wine, then they will change their mind.” (Thom. 28)\n\nLike John’s Jesus, Jesus in Thomas is here for just a brief time. He sojourns in the world, shares his words of divine wisdom, but ultimately must return to the heavenly abode from whence he came. In John 7:33–34 Jesus says: I will be with you a little longer, and then I will go to the one who sent me; you will seek me and you will not find me; where I am you will not be able to come.\n\nCompare this to Jesus’ words in Thom. 38:\n\nU nderstanding the G o spel o f T h o mas T o day\n\n45\n\n(1) Jesus says: “Many times you have desired to hear these words, these that I am speaking to you, and you have no one else from whom to hear them. (2) There will be days when you will seek me, (and) you will not find me.”\n\nFinally, as with Jesus in John, in Thomas Jesus promises that someday his followers will return to their place of origin. They will not stay in this world, but shall someday return to God: (1) Jesus says: “Blessed are the solitary ones, the elect. For you will find the kingdom. (2) For you come from it (and) will return to it.” (Thom. 49)\n\nIn John this will happen as an answer to Jesus’ prayer on behalf of the disciples (John 17). Not so in Thomas. In Thomas, the followers of Jesus must know who they really are, and how to identify themselves to the powers of the universe, if they wish to return to the heavenly realm from whence they have come. Just so, the next saying reads like a brief catechism for passing this test : (1) Jesus says: “If they say to you: ‘Where do you come from?’, (then) say to them: ‘We have come from the light, the place where the light has come into being by itself, has established [itself] and has appeared in their image.’ (2) If they say to you: ‘Is it you?’, (then) say: ‘We are his children, and we are the elect of the living Father.’ (3) If they ask you: ‘What is the sign of your Father among you?’, (then) say to them: ‘It is movement and repose.’” (Thom. 50)\n\nIn these ideas, that Jesus is the redeemer come from God sent into a hostile world to lead the elect out the world and home to the\n\n46\n\nU nderstanding the G o spel o f T h o mas T o day\n\nheavenly world from whence they have come, some have found the ingredients of Gnosticism, an ancient religious movement that found expression in many different religions of the ancient orient. Indeed, the influence of so-called Gnosticism on Thomas, John, and even Paul, has long been a topic of debate among New Testament scholars. But in recent years a critical shift has occurred in that discussion. It seems the term ‘Gnostic’ is not so well-defined a category as its frequent invocation would suggest. It has become a catch-all term applied to anything of an esoteric or speculative nature.24 If it is to be retained at all, some have suggested that it be used only to describe those theological systems in which the world is understood to be a great cosmic mistake, perpetrated by an evil demiurge, a rebellious creator god, who seeks to keep its unenlightened inhabitants imprisoned in their own sleepy ignorance. But it is precisely this “cosmic devolution” that does not appear in the Gospel of Thomas (or John or Paul). How, then, shall we describe the theology of the Gospel of Thomas more precisely and accurately?\n\nScholars have over the years fished around for other ways to\n\ndescribe Thomas. Some have called it “Hermetic,” and compared it to ancient Hermetic texts like Poimandres. Others have placed it within the family of Jewish mystical writings. Still others have compared its ideas to the great Jewish theologian, Philo of Alexandria, who interpreted the Torah in terms of Hellenistic philosophy. Gnosticism, Hermeticism, mysticism, Philo–Thomas has certain affinities with all of these contemporaneous religious voices. Why? It is because all of them were making use of a religious and philosophical view of the world that was widely in vogue during the period of Christian origins: Platonism.\n\nAfter an extended period of skepticism in the ancient philo-\n\nsophical world, the later Hellenistic period saw a resurgence of\n\nU nderstanding the G o spel o f T h o mas T o day\n\n47\n\ninterest in questions about the nature of the world, the cosmos, and the nature of human being. It was a time of change. People had begun to question whether they really knew the world, and whether they really understood themselves. To gain answers to these questions, many turned once more to the ancient sage, Socrates, and to his interpreter, Plato. These Middle Platonists – so-called to distinguish them from earlier Platonists and later Neo-Platonists – began to explore the more speculative passages in the Republic, Alcibiades, The Sophist, and especially the Timaeus, the most sweeping of Plato’s attempts to describe the world and human being within it. They began to take to heart Plato’s description of the way things are. It was Plato who gave these seekers the notion that the human being consists of a mortal part and an immortal part, and that the latter comes from God and returns to God when mortal life is ended. It was Plato who provided them with the cosmos in which they lived: an earthly world below, inferior, imperfect, a mere shadow of the real, and the heavenly sphere above, the place of light and life, the real world to which the immortal soul returns when the body dies. Eventually Platonic notions would come to dominate Christian theology, through the great Alexandrian theologians, Clement and Origen, and later, Augustine, who read them avidly. But now we are seeing that Plato’s influence was felt earlier as well. The Thomas gospel is one of these earlier attempts to read the Jesus tradition through the lens of Platonism – or rather, Middle Platonism.\n\n25\n\nThis gospel’s Platonic inclinations can be seen at the very\n\nbeginning of the gospel, where the origins of this tradition in Jewish Wisdom theology can be seen to blend quite naturally with a concept that lies near the centre of Middle Platonic thinking. Thomas 3 begins like this:\n\n48\n\nU nderstanding the G o spel o f T h o mas T o day\n\n(1) Jesus says: “If those who lead you say to you: ‘Look, the kingdom is in the sky!’, then the birds of the sky will precede you. (2) If they say to you: ‘It is in the sea’, then the fish will precede you. (3) Rather, the kingdom is inside of you and outside of you.”\n\nHere Thomas mimics an old Jewish wisdom motif: the search for Wisdom in all the wrong places. In Deuteronomy 30:11–14, for example, the word of God is said not to be in the heavens, and not beyond the sea, but “very near to you… in your mouth and in your heart for you to observe.”26 In Thomas the saying continues in a similar vein, but now making use of the familiar Platonic concept of self-knowledge: (4) “When you come to know yourselves, then you will be known, and you will realize that you are children of the living Father. (5) But if you do not come to know yourselves, then you exist in poverty and you are poverty.”\n\n“Know thyself ” – the ancient Delphic maxim. In the late Hellenistic period, this saying had come to hold a very specific meaning among Platonists: Know yourself, your true self, that you are of God.27 Cicero, who was touched by Middle Platonic thought, expresses it nicely: For he who knows himself will realize, in the first place, that he has a divine element within him, and will think of his own inner nature as a kind of consecrated image of God; and so he will always act and think in a way worthy of so great a gift of the gods, and, when he has examined and thoroughly tested himself, he will understand how nobly equipped by Nature he entered life,\n\nU nderstanding the G o spel o f T h o mas T o day\n\n49\n\nand what manifold means he possesses for the attainment and acquisition of wisdom.28\n\nThe key to the well-lead life, according to the Middle Platonists, was proper self-knowledge, the content of which was the divine origins and nature of the true self. In Thomas 3 this concept is expressed using a term drawn from Jewish and early Christian tradition: to discover the true self is to discover that you are “children of the living Father.”29\n\nIn the above passage Cicero makes use of notion that is also\n\ncentral to the Platonic version of reality: the element of the divine contained in the human being is simply a tiny version of the great divine that rules the universe. Here Cicero expresses the thought when he calls this divine element the “image of God.” This, of course, was a concept well-known to Jews like Philo of Alexandria, interested in reading the Jewish tradition through Platonic lenses. When Philo read in Genesis 1:26–27 that God created the human in “the image and likeness of God,” he assumed that it naturally refers to that part of the person that is immortal and God-like. Like God, he says, it is “an idea, or a genus, or a seal, perceptible only to the mind, incorporeal, neither male nor female, imperishable by nature.”30 Philo’s language here is thoroughly Platonic. The “image of God” is the divine element thought to be embedded in the mortal human being according to the Platonic anthropology. When, then, is the mortal part created? According to Philo, Genesis speaks of this only later, in Genesis 2, in what modern scholarship recognizes as a second, distinct creation account, in which the human one is created from the dust of the earth. But Philo did not see it this way. He saw the two accounts as two episodes of a single story. In the first episode, the immortal part – what Plato usually calls nous, or “mind” – is created “in the image of God.” In the second, God creates the mortal body in which this\n\n50\n\nU nderstanding the G o spel o f T h o mas T o day\n\nimmortal image of God will dwell. This part, he says, is “perceptible to the external senses, partaking of qualities, consisting of body and soul, man or woman, by nature mortal.”31 In this way the whole Platonic anthropology is read into the Genesis creation account. The immortal, divine element, what Plato calls the “mind” (nous), is the part created in the image of God in Gen 1:26–27; the mortal parts, body (soma) and “soul” (psyche), are created later, in Gen 2:7.\n\nSomething like this Platonized Jewish anthropology is reflected\n\nin Thomas 84, which speaks of rediscovering one’s divine image that “came into being before you:” Jesus says: “When you see your likenesses you are full of joy. But when you will see your images that came into existence before you – they can neither die nor become manifest – how much will you bear?”\n\nThe saying speaks first of “your likenesses,” what you see in a mirror, or a puddle, staring back at you. But delightful as this experience may be, the thing staring back at you is not the true self. What you see is merely the mortal body – what is referred to in Genesis 2:7. “But when you see your images,” the true self created in the image of God, “that came into existence before you,” – what is referred to earlier in Genesis 1:26–27 – that is the true self. When you come face to face with this true self, “how much will you bear?”\n\nIn Jewish exegesis of Genesis it was common to conclude that\n\nwhen Adam sinned, he forfeited the divine image, and the immortality that went with it. Thus Thomas 85 continues in this vein: Jesus says: “Adam came from a great power and great wealth. But he did not become worthy of you. For if he had been worthy, (then) [he would] not [have tasted] death.”\n\nU nderstanding the G o spel o f T h o mas T o day\n\n51\n\nThomas 84 speaks of rediscovering the divine image that was lost in the garden when Adam sinned. Saying 85 intimates that the one who recovers that divine image undoes what Adam did, and so surpasses him.\n\nThese ideas are not unique to Thomas. Paul, too, saw in Christ a\n\nway to undo the effects of the first Adam. For him, Christ is the second Adam, who restores in people the heavenly image, and with it the immortality that was lost when the first Adam sinned.32 For Paul, this is accomplished by the power of the risen Christ at the resurrection of the dead. Among the Thomas Christians recapturing the divine image was probably associated with certain ascetical practices. This is idea behind the mysterious logion 22 in the Gospel of Thomas. Notice how it speaks of replacing the mortal body – body part by body part – until at last the mortal body is replaced by the divine image: Jesus saw little (children) being nursed. He said to his disciples: “These little ones being nursed are like those who enter the kingdom.” They said to him: “Will we enter the kingdom as little ones?” Jesus said to them: “When you make the two into one and when you make the inside like the outside and the outside like the inside and the above like the below, – that is, to make the male and the female into a single one, so that the male will no longer be male and the female no longer female – and when you make eyes instead of an eye and a hand instead of a hand and a foot instead of a foot, and an image instead of an image, then you will enter [the kingdom].” (Thom. 22:4–7)\n\nHere again one sees the peculiar language of Genesis read through a Platonic lens. Recall that in Genesis 1:26–27 the human being\n\n52\n\nU nderstanding the G o spel o f T h o mas T o day\n\nis created both “male and female.” Hellenistic Jewish exegetes saw in this language the idea (probably originally Platonic) that the primordial human being was originally androgynous – that is, both male and female – and they speculated that there would come a time when human beings would once again return to this original state of androgynous perfection.33 Here and elsewhere in the Gospel of Thomas we encounter the idea of the “single one.”34 In Thomas 22 the term is explained: it refers to someone who has recovered the original, immortal, image of God that was “both male and female.” How was it to be recovered? The language of bodily regeneration that is employed in this mysterious saying probably derives from the ancient world of asceticism. Early Christian ascetics engaged in their severe practices as a way of re-creating themselves anew – thus, “eyes instead of an eye, and hand instead of a hand, a foot instead of a foot.” And so the process goes, bodily part by bodily part, until the whole self is remade in the image of God.35 Of course, Genesis was not really a speculative philosophical text. Without a lot of help, its anthropology is very straightforward. But the Middle Platonists had Plato, from whom they would develop more elaborate ideas about, among other things, the human being. One of these developments was the idea that a human being consists not of two parts (say, body and soul), but of three. Plutarch states the concept clearly: Most people rightly hold a person to be composite but wrongly hold them to be composed of only two parts. The reason is that they suppose mind to be somehow part of soul, thus erring no less than those who suppose soul to be part of body, for in the same degree as soul is superior to body so is mind better and more divine than soul (Mor 943A).\n\nU nderstanding the G o spel o f T h o mas T o day\n\n53\n\nPlutarch thought that a correct reading of Plato would yield not a bi-partite anthropology consisting of body and soul, but a tri-partite anthropology consisting of body, soul, and mind. Among the Middle Platonists it was this third element, the mind, which is the immortal part of the human being, the part that is like unto God, bearing the image of God. Philo of Alexandria thought this way as well. The whole person, he believed, consisted of body and soul, but the soul, he says, consists of both a rational and an irrational part.36 The rational part he calls mind, like Plutarch, to distinguish it from the lesser, irrational soul, or psyche.37 He also uses various synonyms for mind. The most common of them is pneuma, or “spirit.” His point of reference is again Genesis 2:7, where he notes that God breathes into the human one the divine spirit (pneuma theion), thus enlivening the human made of dust with the divine breath.38 Philo thought that Genesis was here describing the process by which the divine image of God, the spirit, was breathed into the mortal human body, thus completing the creation of the human one as both mortal and immortal.\n\nIn Thomas one sees this tripartite anthropology as well. In a\n\nseries of sayings Thomas speaks on the one hand of body and soul, and on the other of body and spirit. The difference is important and revealing. Thomas 112 reads as follows: Jesus says: “Woe to the flesh that depends on the soul. Woe to the soul that depends on the flesh.”\n\nNotice how flesh39 and soul are juxtaposed here, but not placed in a hierarchy of value. In the first clause, it is the flesh that suffers because of the soul; in the second, it is the soul that suffers because of the flesh. The detriment of the body to the soul is easily grasped, but the Platonists also thought about the detriments of the soul to\n\n54\n\nU nderstanding the G o spel o f T h o mas T o day\n\nthe body: the soul occupied with unhealthy passions – lust, greed, jealousy – can lead to problems with the body.40 Flesh and soul are here understood as different parts of the mortal human being struggling one against the other to the detriment of both. But the relationship of body and spirit is different. Notice the difference in the wording of this second saying: Jesus says: “If the flesh came into being because of the spirit, it is a wonder. But if the spirit (came into being) because of the body, it is a wonder of wonders.” Yet I marvel at how this great wealth has taken up residence in this poverty.\n\nHere body and spirit are not equal: the spirit is wealth; the body is poverty. Why, it asks, would God wish the spirit to take up residence in the body? In reflecting on Genesis 2:7, Philo pondered this question as well. His answer was two-fold: first, God likes to give gifts, and second, such a gift makes the human being more aware of virtue, and thus closer to God.41 In Thomas the question remains paradox, “a wonder of wonders.”\n\nWhat about God in the Gospel of Thomas? The gospel says much\n\nabout the world, and much about the human being. But its statements about God are relatively few. This relative paucity lies in keeping with the Jewish wisdom tradition on the one hand, and Middle Platonism on the other – the two traditions from which the Thomas theology generally takes it bearings. In both of these theological traditions, God is seldom described, and anthropomorphic references to God are avoided as primitive and unsophisticated. God, for the most part, remains in the background. God does not speak, but communicates through sages and emissaries. When God is mentioned in the Gospel of Thomas, it is in terms we can readily recognize as Jewish. Thus, like many pious Jews of this period, those who created the\n\nU nderstanding the G o spel o f T h o mas T o day\n\n55\n\nThomas gospel generally avoided the actual word “God” as a pagan impiety – in the Coptic version it occurs just once (in Saying 100), and once more in the Greek fragments (Saying 30). When referring to the kingdom of God, for example, Thomas prefers the simple “kingdom” (thus, “the kingdom is like…”42), or occasionally the “kingdom of Heaven,”43 or more commonly the “kingdom of the Father.”44 God is the “Living Father” in Thomas, and those who follow God are “children of the living Father.”45 The Father’s word (Thomas 79) and will (Thomas 99) can be known and obeyed. The Father offers solace to the persecuted and oppressed (Thomas 69). All of these views are firmly rooted in Jewish tradition.\n\nThe closest Thomas comes to a statement about God’s\n\nappearance and character is in Saying 83, which, after the work of the Berlin Working Group, reads as follows: (1) Jesus says: “The images are visible to a person, but the light within them is hidden in the image. (2) The light of the Father will reveal itself, but his image is hidden by his light.”\n\nThis saying is a study in the way Platonism and Jewish tradition could come together quite naturally. Light in Platonism is a fundamental feature of the divine realm. It represents the real, as opposed to the illusory. One need only remember the iconic Allegory of the Cave in Plato’s Republic: when the captive is freed from his chains to look about, he soon discovers that the shadows that were his only reality are in fact poor im"
