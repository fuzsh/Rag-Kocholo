This book definitely bears the stamp of the unique environment of Macquarie’s Department of Ancient History, where the study of the papyrological and epigraphic record of ancient Christians has been central for decades. I also owe a huge debt to Gill Ellis and the whole Arts Research Office at Macquarie for teaching me how to navigate the Australian grant system, a system to which I am equally indebted. Funding that supported this research came from the Department of Ancient History at Macquarie, the Society for the Study of Early Christianity, a Macquarie University Research Fellowship, and a Discovery Early Career Research Award from the Australian Research Council. The last revisions on the book took place during an enjoyable stay at Aarhus University. I am obliged especially to René Falkenberg and Kasper Bro Larsen for making that happen. Special thanks are due to Paul Dilley, Melissa Moreton, and everyone at the University of Iowa involved in the Mellon Sawyer Seminar on manuscripts across premodern Eurasia, which was an eye-opening experience that helped to broaden my perspective on the history of book production at a key moment of the project. Many of the ideas presented in this book were first hammered out in talks presented at Fordham University, Princeton University, Trinity College Melbourne, the University of Manchester, the Uniix\n\nx Acknowledgments\n\nversity of Notre Dame, the University of Sydney, the University of Texas at Austin, and Yale University. The Papyrology and Early Christian Backgrounds group at the annual meetings of the Society of Biblical Literature has become my home away from home for the past decade, and I very much appreciate the organizers, fellow presenters, and audience members at these sessions. I would be remiss not to thank Ann Hanson, who first introduced me to papyri and changed the direction of my research. Thanks are also due to the curators of the many manuscripts and archives that I was fortunate enough to study. I express my gratitude to the staff at the Bentley Historical Library and the Papyrology Collection at the University of Michigan; the Biblioteca Apostolica Vaticana; the British Library; the Chester Beatty Library; the Houghton Library at Harvard University; the John Rylands Library at the University of Manchester; the Pierpont Morgan Library; the Magdalen College, Sackler, and Bodleian libraries at the University of Oxford; the Scheide Library and the Seeley G. Mudd Manuscript Library at Princeton University; the Special Collections at the Clare­ mont Colleges Library; and the Special Collections at the University of Western Australia. Stasa Bibic, Florence Darbre, and the entire staff of the Fondation Martin Bodmer were especially helpful and accommodating during my visits to Cologny, and David Hogge’s guidance in the archives at the Freer Gallery at the Smithsonian Institution was indispensable. This book has evolved over a number of years and owes much to the patience and guidance of Jennifer Banks, Heather Gold, Susan Laity, and the production team at Yale University Press. Jessie Dolch provided expert copyediting on this challenging manuscript. I am deeply grateful to all these people. One of the real pleasures of undertaking this project has been benefiting from the boundless enthusiasm and knowledge of Anne­ Marie Luijendijk. I have learned a great deal by watching how she frames questions about early Christian book culture, and I’m thankful for her input on the manuscript at several points in the project. I’m also obliged to others who read part or all of the manuscript at various stages: Roger Bagnall, Doug Boin, Josephine Dru, Sean Durbin, Felicity Harley-McGowan, Edwin Judge, Hugo Lundhaug, Dale Martin, Julia Miller, Roberta Mazza, and Gregg Schwendner.\n\nAcknowledgments xi\n\nMany other friends have patiently answered questions over the past few years. I single out Malcolm Choat, Cavan Concannon, Stephen Emmel, Larry Hurtado, D. C. Parker, Dan Sharp, and Sofía Torallas Tovar. Their advice saved me from many errors. Those that remain are on me. I began this project just after I married Mary Jane Cuyler, who has been an inspiring conversation partner through every step of the research, writing, and revision process. Her insightful feedback and admirable lack of tolerance for scholarly “fibs” have made this a much better and more honest work.\n\nMap showing locations in Egypt mentioned in the text. (Cartography by Bill Nelson.)\n\nPrologue: Reintroducing the Earliest Christian Manuscripts\n\nate in 1907, it was publicly revealed that the American busi nessman Charles Lang Freer (1854–1919) had acquired a group of four early Christian books from an antiquities dealer in Egypt. Freer, who made a fortune from the production of railcars in Detroit during the 1890s, had established himself as a discerning art collector well before he first traveled to Egypt in 1906.1 Shortly after his arrival there, he spent December 17 and 18 with two Greek scholars looking over a group of manuscripts for sale by a local dealer.2 His diary entry for Wednesday, December 19, is terse: “Cairo: Bought manuscripts in forenoon & paid for them during afternoon.”3 For the next twelve months, only a select circle of experts knew the significance of what Freer had bought. Then, in December 1907, one of these scholars announced to the world that Freer’s purchase had consisted of —a Greek manuscript on parchment containing Deuteronomy and Joshua datable by its handwriting to the fourth or fifth century CE —a Greek manuscript on parchment containing the Psalms datable by its handwriting to the sixth or seventh century —a Greek manuscript on parchment containing the four 1\n\n2 Prologue\n\ngospels (in the order Matthew, John, Luke, and then Mark) datable by its handwriting to the fifth or sixth century, enclosed in wooden covers decorated with portraits of the evangelists —a Greek manuscript on parchment containing the letters of Paul datable by its handwriting to the fifth century.4 The manuscript of the gospels was in an especially fine state of preservation and was considered to be nearly as old as the earliest known Greek copies of the New Testament. It also preserved an unusual ending for the Gospel According to Mark, an ending unknown from other early Greek witnesses that included the ominous line “Christ replied to them, ‘The term of years of Satan’s power has been fulfilled, but other terrible things draw near.’” This news generated a great deal of interest, not only among biblical scholars and historians, but also among the general public. Newspaper headlines spun the story in a variety of ways:5 BIBLE ERRORS TO BE CORRECTED BY NEWLY FOUND MANUSCRIPTS: Valuable Writings Locked Up in Detroit Safety Vault Supply Lost Parts A NEW VERSE FOR ST.

The headlines also give a sense of the allure of the manuscripts: “Newly Discovered Scripture,” “Dug from the Sands,” found by a “Millionaire Archaeologist,” “First revealed in Chicago,” and now kept in Detroit. That is to say, early Christian treasures from Egypt had now been taken to America’s heartland—a “Marvelous Story” (Figure 0.1).\n\nFigure 0.1. Newspaper clipping from press cutting book, tentatively identified as from the Chicago Examiner, January 5, 1908. (Charles Lang Freer Papers, Freer Gallery of Art and Arthur M. Sackler Gallery Archives, Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C.)\n\n4 Prologue\n\nAfter the excitement of the first announcement came the serious work of editing and publishing the books. This task was given to Henry A. Sanders (1868–1956), a junior professor of Latin at the University of Michigan, who worked with remarkable speed and acumen to produce a study of the text of the Deuteronomy and Joshua manuscript by 1910. Freer supplied the necessary funding to produce a companion photographic facsimile of stunning quality.6 But it was the release of the study and facsimile of the gospel manuscript in 1912 that brought a second wave of publicity that seems at least as intense as the first.7 Newspapers across the country reproduced leaves of the manuscript and retold the tale of its purchase. The New York Times ran a front-page story on May 13, 1913, and then had a longer feature the following Sunday with illustrations of the book’s decorated covers (Figure 0.2).8 The stories announced the new publications as well as scholars’ reactions, and they noted that the gospel manuscript, along with Freer’s other ancient books, were to be kept in the art gallery Freer was funding for the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C. Thus the books are sometimes known as “the Washington Manuscripts” and the gospel manuscript as Codex Washingtonensis. With its new name, the codex was in no way inferior, the newspapers claimed, to other famous Bibles around the world: “This happy find of Mr. Freer’s places the United States on the list with Russia, which owns the Sinaiticus manuscript at St. Petersburg; with Italy and its Codex Vaticanus at Rome, with England’s Alexandrinus at London and Codex Bezae at Cambridge.”9 Freer’s gospel manuscript had also, by some accounts, aged significantly since its unveiling as a “fifth or sixth century” manuscript in 1907. According to the New York Times of May 18, 1913, the date of the Freer manuscript of the gospels had been established as “the third, or at the latest the early fourth, century.”10 Yet, on May 14, the same paper had cited an article in the Times of London stating that the book “probably belongs to the fifth or sixth centuries.”11 Both reports are somewhat curious, since, after an extensive discussion, Sanders himself had concluded that most of the evidence “seems to point to the fourth century, though the beginning of the fifth must still be admitted as a possibility.”12 With regard to the place where the manuscripts were discovered, Sanders offered only mysterious hints: “While I am not as yet allowed to publish the exact spot where\n\nPrologue\n\n5\n\nFigure 0.2. Article announcing the publication of the Freer gospels, the New York Times, May 18, 1913, sec. 7, p. 8. (Image courtesy of the New York Times.)\n\nthe MSS were found, the statements made by the finders fix it definitely and are consistent with the evidence gathered.”13 But even now, more than one hundred years after the publication of Freer’s books, what do we actually know, both about the age of the manuscripts and about their origins? Paleography, or the determination of the age of a manuscript through the analysis of handwriting, was in its infancy in the early twentieth century, and it still remains a highly subjective exercise to this day. While Sanders ultimately concluded that the Freer manuscript of the gospels was most likely copied in the fourth century, some scholars continued to believe it was a product of the fifth or even the sixth century.14 The most recent assessment of the age of the gospel manuscript concluded that we are simply not in a position to offer a precise date for the codex on the basis of handwriting and closed with a plea for radiocarbon analysis.15 The case with the other manuscripts is no clearer.\n\n6 Prologue\n\nOne highly respected specialist has assigned the Deuteronomy and Joshua manuscript to the sixth century, rather than the fourth or fifth.16 Another authority places the Psalms codex in the fifth century, instead of the sixth or seventh.17 Expert opinions can differ by a hundred years or more. Our knowledge of the provenance of the manuscripts is equally shaky. The first reports said that they had come from Akhmim, a city in southern, or “Upper” Egypt, but this story, like just about every story of the provenance of ancient manuscripts, turns out to be a lot more complicated when we scratch the surface. In that initial public announcement, Sanders described the origin of the manuscripts as follows: Mr. Charles L. Freer of Detroit, Michigan, has in his possession four very ancient manuscripts of parts of the Bible. He purchased these early in 1907, in Cairo, from a dealer named Ali Arabi,18 who stated that the manuscripts came from Akhmîm (the ancient Panopolis). . . . What I have thus far learned of the four manuscripts is not inconsistent with the statement that they came from Akhmîm, and I am now inclined to believe that they once formed parts of a Bible in use in Upper Egypt. Either during or soon after the Moslem conquest in 639 A.D., this Bible ceased to be needed because of the withdrawal of the Greek Christians, and so was either buried or lost.19 In the wake of this announcement, Carl Schmidt, an expert in early Christian manuscripts, claimed with utter certainty that the books came from the White Monastery located across the Nile from Akhmim, while a professor at the University of Chicago was equally sure the books had been associated with a monastery in the Nitrian Desert, some six hundred kilometers north of Akhmim.20 When Sanders published on the topic again a year later, his own views had shifted considerably: “Professor Schmidt has probably been deceived by one of the numerous Arab stories; all are of equal value with the first one told, viz. that the Mss. came from Akhmim. To accept the White Monastery as the last home of the Mss. would imply that this first story was near the truth. Yet any one acquainted with Arab sto-\n\nPrologue\n\n7\n\nries would advise us to look in every other direction first, as toward the Nitrian Desert, or the Fayoum, or the region toward Sinai, if we wish to find the last resting place of this ancient Bible.”21 This change in opinion was probably due to investigations being undertaken by Charles Freer himself. In the winter of 1907–1908, he had returned to Egypt to try to find out more precisely the location of the discovery and to acquire any other manuscripts that might have been part of the find. Upon arrival, he immediately met with the dealer Ali Arabi, who changed his story completely and now told Freer that the books had come from Dime, ancient Soknopaiou Nesos in the Fayum region (see the inset map in the front matter). The area is well north of Akhmim but not so far north as the monasteries of the Nitrian Desert. Furthermore, Ali provided Freer with a detailed story of the discovery of the manuscripts by a man known only as “the digger.” Among Freer’s papers is a breathless summary of the meeting with Ali Arabi, which reads like a mystery novel: The four mss. I bought last year from Arabi, were dug up at night, about one month before I first saw them, by “the digger.” . . . The place where these four manuscripts were dug up is called Medinet Dimay. It is in the Fayoum . . . Dimay was once a big city with a big wall around it. Some of the wall still remains. In the middle of the big city stands the ruins of the monastery. . . . The “digger” was the first man to dig there and during his first digging he found the four bibles you have. Found them all in one place, only a little digging, one corner of all the big place, many more papyrus must be there.22 Freer, along with the scholars working on the publication of the manuscripts, did not disclose this news and deliberately allowed the spread of misinformation regarding the location of the find. Questions about the place of discovery were referred to Schmidt’s article about the White Monastery.23 If other manuscripts from the same find were available, Freer wanted to be the one to get them. And Dime was the place he expected to find them.24 The most recent and thorough investigation of the provenance of the Freer books undertaken by Kent D. Clarke (published in 2006)\n\n8 Prologue\n\noffers a qualified acceptance of Ali Arabi’s story: “Many of the details pertaining to both the general region and specific location where the Washington Manuscripts were supposedly discovered reveal close similarities to independent descriptions of Dimai and its environs. . . . If the Washington Manuscripts were not actually discovered at this location, a great deal of thought and effort went into correctly describing Dimai and the surrounding area.”25 But a number of problems remain. For one thing, Ali Arabi’s accurate knowledge of Dime by no means necessitates that Freer’s books were found there, only that the dealer or his informant had visited the site. Also, “the digger” could not have been the first person to set a spade to Soknopaiou Nesos. The site already had a reasonably well-documented history of excavation, especially during the second half of the nineteenth century. The famous British manuscript hunters Bernard P. Grenfell and Arthur S. Hunt had dug there at the turn of the century.26 Sanders himself would visit the site of Soknopaiou Nesos in 1913 and find that it did not at all meet his expectations. There were no visible remains of a monastery. By 1920, at least one experienced Cairo dealer, Maurice Nahman, was certain that the Freer manuscripts were found not at Dime but farther south in the Fayum at Batn Harit (ancient Theadelphia).27 Nevertheless, the University of Michigan carried out excavations at Dime during 1931–1932 and concluded that the area “appeared to have been abandoned about the middle of the third century,” well before the Freer manuscripts were copied.28 More recent and extensive archaeological investigations at the site have uncovered a single fragmentary Coptic papyrus perhaps datable to the sixth century and three ostraca, or potsherds, with Coptic writing, as well as one ostracon that may display a roughly drawn Christian symbol. These findings, along with the presence of later ceramics and other signs of later human and animal occupation of the site, led the excavators to conclude that after the site was abandoned, its main temple may have become a remote monastic hermitage.29 While it is of course possible that the Freer books were found at this site, this is not exactly the setting where one would imagine the production or use of luxurious books like the Freer volumes.30 At the end of the day, the only real connection between the books and the town of Dime is the word of an antiquities dealer who had also claimed that the manuscripts were found elsewhere. No-\n\nPrologue\n\n9\n\nbody involved with the books—the dealer, the buyer, and to a degree even the scholars who studied and published the manuscripts—was completely forthcoming about provenance. The result is an obfuscation of origins at every level. Thus, we don’t know exactly how old the books are, and we don’t know where in Egypt they came from.31 This is not to say that we have no secure knowledge about these books. We know a good deal about the texts they carry, especially the very peculiar text of the gospel manuscript, which captivated textual critics of the New Testament for decades after its discovery.32 But the books themselves quite quickly faded from public view. The Freer manuscripts have rarely been on display.33 Subsequent high-­ profile purchases of ancient Christian manuscripts from Egypt were either larger than Freer’s set of books (such as the wealth of Coptic books acquired by J. Pierpont Morgan in 1911; see Chapter 3) or even older than the Freer manuscripts (such as the Greek papyrus books bought by Chester Beatty in 1930; see Chapter 4). Then in the 1940s, not just a forgotten verse, but whole texts that had been lost from view showed up on the antiquities market and were said to have come from Nag Hammadi, a site whose very name now conjures up the idea of “secret gnostic heresies.” In the 1950s another collection of well-preserved books emerged. These were mostly purchased by the Swiss collector Martin Bodmer and included Greek papyrus copies of the gospels of Luke and John that were thought to date from perhaps as early as the second century (see Chapter 5). The appearance of these manuscripts was surely a key reason why Freer’s books, despite the excitement they generated early on, have fallen into what one prominent scholar has described as a state of “comparative neglect” such that academics do not often pay serious attention to them, and “the general public today scarcely knows of them.”34 I have opened with this extended consideration of Freer’s books because their story is instructive in a number of ways. First, it illustrates how little we know with any certainty about the dates and provenance of many early Christian manuscripts. Second, it emphasizes that our lack of knowledge is often the result of the operations of the antiquities market. Third, we can see how academic publications and the popular media can provide both information and misinformation about early Christian manuscripts. Fourth, only through\n\n10 Prologue\n\na combination of archival research, archaeological exploration, and the use of newer technologies such as radiocarbon analysis can we begin to increase our knowledge of these artifacts. Finally, even the scholarly loss of interest in the Freer manuscripts is illuminating. Historically, the value of ancient Christian manuscripts has been gauged primarily in relation to their ability to provide access to authentic knowledge about the “original text” of the Bible, especially the New Testament. When seemingly older Christian books appeared on the scene, Freer’s manuscripts receded into the background. A related issue is the fact that Freer’s manuscripts were copied on parchment, that is, animal skin, rather than papyrus, a writing surface manufactured from the reeds of the Cyperus papyrus and related plants. The subsequent finds associated with Chester Beatty and Martin Bodmer mentioned above included papyrus books thought to be very old, which has tended to give Christian manuscripts preserved on papyrus an air of prestige in both the popular and academic imaginations. To state flatly that Christian manuscripts have been understudied would be inaccurate, especially as regards those that preserve parts of the New Testament. First and foremost, papyrologists have made important contributions to the study of early Christian manuscripts. The academic division of labor is such that papyrologists generally edit and publish the earliest Christian manuscripts and therefore usually have the first word about any newly discovered books. Papyrological specialists have also frequently been intrigued by the apparent Christian preference for the codex (the modern form of a bound book with pages) as opposed to the roll, which had been the medium of choice for the transmission of literature for centuries.35 At the same time, generations of biblical scholars have expended an enormous amount of time and energy using ancient manuscripts to try to determine the “original text” of the documents of the New Testament. Even though the goal of establishing a single, original text has come to seem more and more problematic in recent years, this work continues.36 Manuals of New Testament textual criticism will thus often introduce a selection of early Christian books in relation to their value for reconstructing the early text of the New Testament, but the details of the ancient manuscripts themselves are often sparse\n\nPrologue\n\n11\n\nin such works, and they are, naturally, limited to manuscripts containing parts of the New Testament.37 As an outgrowth of the text-­ critical task, a number of scholars have come to pay close attention to the “scribal habits” of the copyists of individual manuscripts.38 These studies often illuminate physical features of manuscripts in a helpful way with close descriptions of the written page, but they ultimately function in service to the text-critical enterprise.39 Other scholars have undertaken in-depth studies of the copyists of Christian books and used the manuscripts to think further about issues regarding church history, such as the formation of the New Testament canon.40 Thus, while biblical scholars have for the most part focused intently on the texts contained within our earliest Christian manuscripts and papyrologists have exploited these manuscripts for the study of certain historical phenomena, the same kind of attention has not been paid to the books themselves as three-dimensional archaeological artifacts worthy of study in their own right. Many of our most important early Christian manuscripts were apparently found, like the Freer manuscripts, as parts of ancient collections of books. The contours of those groups are sometimes unclear, but even the parts of the broader context that we do know tend to be neglected in favor of the isolated study of individual manuscripts, or even of individual texts within a manuscript. This lack of consideration of the books as physical objects has resulted in implausibly precise (and often implausibly early) dates being assigned to a number of important manuscripts. In fact, despite the useful data sometimes provided by factors such as the archaeological context of the collections, the codicology of the manuscript (its size and layout), the binding techniques used to assemble the books, and the availability of technology like radiocarbon analysis, early Christian manuscripts are most frequently dated by means of only paleography, which is, as we will see again and again, a deeply problematic practice. What we need is greater attention to the books themselves as artifacts, to the archaeology of early Christian manuscripts. In saying this, I do not mean to imply that no work at all has been done in this area. Conferences and collections of essays dedicated to studying manuscripts in context have been appearing for several years now, and detailed studies of individual manuscripts con-\n\n12 Prologue\n\ntinue to be produced.41 Three synthetic studies written over the past quarter century need to be mentioned at the outset, as they especially help to frame my own project. Published in 1995, Harry Gamble’s Books and Readers in the Early Church brought together a wealth of evidence for the production and consumption of books by ancient Christians. Who made early Christian books? Who read them? What did “publication” mean in an ancient context? Gamble addressed these questions by mining the literature written by early Christian authors for references to books and reading practices and weaving together a rich history of the place of the book in early Christian groups. While the extant remains of ancient books do occasionally feature in Gamble’s discussions, he drew mainly from literary evidence, with the physical artifacts playing a secondary role. I have written the present book in part to complement Gamble’s excellent work by turning attention to the surviving books themselves and what we can know about their age and their histories, both ancient and modern. In 2006, the field received a second strong push in the right direction with the publication of Larry Hurtado’s collection of essays The Earliest Christian Artifacts: Manuscripts and Christian Origins.42 Pointing out that a large portion of professional scholars of the New Testament lack familiarity with the manuscripts of the New Testament, Hurtado presented a series of studies on the contents, forms, and scribal features of the earliest Christian manuscripts (those he recognized as predating the fourth century). I very much share Hurtado’s sense that the field of biblical studies would be well served by an improved knowledge of Christian manuscripts. Yet, although Hurtado’s book has a good deal of useful information in it, some features of its organization tend to obscure what I am calling the archaeology of the manuscripts. For instance, when Hurtado first introduces “The Texts,” he does so by dividing them into “Old Testament Texts,” “New Testament Texts,” and “Other Early Christian Writings.” Hurtado rightly flags the potential anachronism involved in such an approach (and the tacit reinforcement of modern canonical divisions should also be noted).43 What concerns me more, however, is the decontextualization that this framework causes. That is to say, such an organizational scheme makes it more difficult to see the fact that what we call “Old Testament” and “New Testament”\n\nPrologue\n\n13\n\ntexts sometimes occur in the same physical book or that such “biblical” books seem to have been found together not only with what we would now call “apocryphal” books but also with non-Christian writings. It is my hope that the present book will supplement Hurtado’s studies with more detailed discussions of the major groups of early Christian manuscripts as groups, to the degree that such groups can be established. Whereas Gamble and Hurtado have approached early Christian books from within the field of biblical studies, Roger Bagnall has recently given a bird’s-eye view of the study of Christian manuscripts from the perspective of a papyrologist. The published version of a set of lectures, Bagnall’s Early Christian Books in Egypt, appeared in 2009 and laid down a series of challenges. Observing what he characterized as “the excessively self-enclosed character and absence of self-awareness” in the scholarship on early Christian books, Bagnall charged that much of what we think we know about them is “profoundly at odds with fundamental social realities of the ancient world and with basic probability.”44 Bagnall provided an updated treatment of topics perennially interesting to papyrologists, such as the economics of book production (How much did books cost? How many Christians owned books?) and the spread of the codex (Might the phenomenon be as much Roman as Christian?), but the largest portion of the book is dedicated to a problem Hurtado also raised: the uncertain nature of paleographic dating.45 Bagnall emphasized that these paleographic judgments about the ages of early Christian manuscripts deserve more scrutiny than they have generally received because of the key role they play in historical questions concerning the growth of Christianity in Egypt and the development and spread of the technology of the codex. What I attempt to do is offer this scrutiny by way of taking seriously “the character of written texts as archaeological artifacts.”46 And when we think of early Christian manuscripts as archaeological artifacts, one of the first things we notice is that they rarely have a definitive archaeological context. Most of them were not excavated by professional archaeologists using modern methods of precisely and accurately recording the place of the find and the surrounding material. Many were instead discovered by accident, looted and sold on the antiquities market, or even just excavated by scholars\n\n14 Prologue\n\nbefore the advent of “scientific” archaeology. Thus, accurate archaeological information about early Christian books is not easily available. This absence of secure knowledge about these manuscripts creates a vacuum that is often filled by what I would call an “imaginary archaeology” of Christian manuscripts (or, less charitably, a “fake archaeology” of Christian manuscripts). According to this imaginary archaeology, Christian manuscripts are discovered from the sands of Egypt and are essentially self-interpreting. They have secure dates, and they clearly confirm or disconfirm some fact about early Christian history. Whether it is the “reliability” of the biblical text at stake or “lost Christianities” supposedly restored by the discovery of socalled heretical texts, early Christian books are often characterized as providing clear evidence of the past: revealing, unveiling, demonstrating, and confirming. This kind of imaginary archaeology seduces even competent biblical scholars, who regularly speak of “the archaeological discovery” of Christian manuscripts that have no clear archaeological context and proceed to use these manuscripts confidently as the basis for their reconstructions of various aspects of Christian history.47 Even when the role of the antiquities trade is acknowledged, it is usually in the form of the repetition (and embellishment) of one particular form of a discovery or acquisition story, with seemingly no awareness of, or concern for, the existence of equally plausible divergent or contradictory accounts. My intention is to make this sort of scholarly error less frequent by “reintroducing” the earliest Christian books as archaeological artifacts. The present book, then, is a double-edged sword. On one hand, I want to establish what we are able to know about these manuscripts as archaeological artifacts. And there is a certain amount that we can learn about them. We can look closely at some of the best-­ preserved examples in order to better understand the ancient technologies of book production (Chapter 1), take seriously all our options for establishing dates for these books (Chapter 2), and try to trace the histories of these books, whether that means examining archaeological sites and practices (as in the case of Oxyrhynchus in Chapter 6) or following the sometimes complicated series of buyers and sellers of manuscripts to establish which items might actually have belonged to a given ancient collection of manuscripts (as in the case of the Beatty Biblical Papyri [Chapter 4] and the Bodmer\n\nPrologue\n\n15\n\nPapyri [Chapter 5]). On the other hand, I cannot provide the “real history” of these books to displace the imaginary archaeology. Instead, the overall effect of my research is to raise consciousness about how messy and fragmentary our knowledge about these books is. In order to appreciate how these manuscripts can help us know something about the ancient world, we first have to learn as much as possible about the modern history of these books. In the pages that follow, I frequently direct attention toward antiquities dealers and popular media reception, topics that are not always on the radars of students of early Christian manuscripts. I am convinced that these factors must be considered if one is to gain an adequate understanding of how knowledge about these manuscripts is produced. In the course of my discussion, I often call into question the credibility of information solicited from dealers and local Egyptians about discoveries of early Christian books. Professional antiquities dealers are out to make a profit, and everyone agrees that their word should be taken with a grain of salt. But those scholars who have cast doubt upon reports from the finders of manuscripts have sometimes been accused of imperialism or orientalism.48 It is important to be attuned to such possibilities, but it is equally important to be aware of the ways in which imbalances of power in colonial settings can affect the production of knowledge. For example, even well into the second half of the twentieth century, European and American scholars in Egypt were in the habit of offering locals baksheesh, tips or bribes, for information about manuscripts and other discoveries.49 It is thus not surprising to find locals telling scholars what they believe the scholars want to hear. I view this less as dishonesty per se and more as an example of “everyday forms of resistance,” attempts by locals to make the best of a situation of unequal power.50 Thus, to simply take the statements solicited from locals at face value is a dubious policy. My own position is that all accounts, both those of scholars and those of nonscholars, ought to be subjected to critical evaluation. Just as often as I question the reliability of reports from Egyptians, I challenge the reports of “Western” scholars when they seem to lack a basis in evidence. Before getting under way, I should say a few words about spelling conventions, terminology, resources, and methodology. Most of this\n\n16 Prologue\n\nbook deals with manuscripts found in Egypt, where the arid climate helped to preserve papyrus and parchment. My sources employ a variety of transliterations of Arabic toponyms and personal names, and I have not tried to systematize them. Egyptian cities and towns mentioned in the book can be identified on the book’s maps (in the front matter, Figure 4.1, and Figure 5.1). Papyrus manuscripts are usually named using a set of conventional abbreviations in the form “P.xxx.” followed by one or more numbers. For example, P.Oxy. 2.208 (or P.Oxy. II 208) refers to the remains of a single papyrus sheet of the Gospel According to John found in the Egyptian city of Oxyrhynchus and published in the second volume of the series The Oxyrhynchus Papyri. P.Bodmer II refers to a nearly complete papyrus codex of the Gospel According to John published in the Papyrus Bodmer series. For the most part, I follow the key to these abbreviations that can be found online at http:// papyri.info/docs/checklist. I occasionally deviate from these guidelines for various reasons. For example, most scholars know the Chester Beatty codex of Numbers and Deuteronomy as “Chester Beatty Codex VI,” but according to the checklist, it would be P.Beatty V (because it appeared in the fifth volume published in the series). To avoid confusion, I refer to the Beatty Biblical Papyri by their traditional numbering rather than using any “P” abbreviations. I also use Arabic instead of Roman numerals for publications with many volumes (thus P.Oxy. 78.5129 instead of P.Oxy. LXXVIII 5129). The bibliography on many of these manuscripts is quite large, especially concerning those manuscripts that preserve substantial portions of the documents of the New Testament. Citing all the relevant literature for every manuscript I mention would be cumbersome, so when I refer to manuscripts, I also provide a reference to the relevant entry in the Leuven Database of Ancient Books (http:// www.trismegistos.org/ldab/) in the form “LDAB xxxx.” The Washington codices, for example, are LDAB numbers 3288 (Deuteronomy-­ Joshua), 3220 (the Psalms), 2985 (the gospels), and 3044 (the Pauline letters). The bibliography in the Leuven Database is not exhaustive, but it provides a good start for curious readers who may want to follow up with specific manuscripts I cite. Although I have provided Leuven Database numbers in order to cut down on my references, this book still has a lot of notes. This\n\nPrologue\n\n17\n\nwas a considered choice on my part. One of the things I am trying to highlight and combat in this book is a certain sloppiness that plagues the study of early Christian manuscripts, that is, a tendency to simply repeat the assertions of earlier writers without checking to see whether any actual evidence exists to back up the claims (Chapter 7 is in fact a case study of the negative consequences of this ubiquitous practice). For that reason, I opted for thoroughness rather than concision in the notes, especially when it comes to questions of dating. If I say an artifact dates to a certain year or period, I provide the evidence in the notes to show how I reached that conclusion, or at the very least I try to refer accurately to the source from which I obtained the date (I was surprised by how often people don’t do this). Not every reader will be interested in every date and every note, but it’s my way of keeping myself honest. It should already be clear that I want to be relentless in my focus on these manuscripts as objects. At the same time, I also want to avoid losing sight of the fact that it is groups of people that imbue these objects with special meaning. Despite the current trend in some circles toward investing inanimate objects with agency, I remain convinced with Simon Goldhill and many others that “things require people to make them talk, even and especially within the rhetoric which insists that ‘things speak for themselves.’ . . . Things do not have a life of their own, simply awaiting the excavator’s spade, but always take shape and meaning within a cultural milieu, a cultural milieu which is reciprocally created and moulded by things. Things take on cultural authority because they can be taken to express value, ideology, history; things can lose their authority because this invisible, soft power is not integral to them.”51 At one level, the human agency behind manuscripts is obvious: Whoever inscribed these manuscripts did so for a reason and brought them into existence. Similarly, ancient users wrote corrections and notes and made repairs. But it’s not just these ancient copyists and users whom I want to highlight. The perceived importance of these manuscripts has a lot to do with the modern systems of classification that scholars use to organize them. For example, biblical scholars call a number of the pieces we will be examining in this book “New Testament papyri” and invest them with a great deal of value. Textual critics of the New Testament regularly refer to manuscripts con-\n\n18 Prologue\n\ntaining New Testament documents written on papyrus by using a Gothic letter “P” ( 𝔓) followed by a number (for example, 𝔓1 or 𝔓66).52 Within New Testament studies, the very word “papyrus” carries a certain aura of antiquity and authority.53 At first glance, this seems logical enough. These manuscripts contain parts of the New Testament, and they are written on papyrus. Yet, both parts of the description are problematic. For one thing, it is not immediately obvious why texts copied on one particular writing surface should be segregated from texts written on other surfaces.54 In fact, this was not always the case. Before the early twentieth century, the few known papyrus manuscripts carrying texts of the New Testament were simply grouped together with the more numerous parchment manuscripts containing either continuous texts of the New Testament books or manuscripts with selected readings (lectionaries).55 The placement of the papyri in a separate list is usually said to originate with the 1908 handbook of Caspar René Gregory (1864–1917).56 In fact, the idea goes back to at least 1901, when Frederic G. Kenyon (1863–1952) proposed a list for papyri (Pap.1, Pap.2, Pap.3, etc.) that was to be separate from the traditional list of parchment manuscripts of the New Testament. The parchment manuscripts had long been abbreviated using letters of the alphabet—A for the Codex Alexandrinus, B for the Codex Vaticanus, and so on. Kenyon wanted a separate list for the papyri on the grounds that letters, which were in short supply, should not be wasted on small, scrappy fragments of papyrus.57 Gregory preferred to keep a single list and simply reserve the letter “P” for all papyrus manuscripts, which would be individually identified with a number (P1, P2, P3, etc.), just as some letters of the alphabet already did double or triple duty (for example, Dea for Codex Bezae of the gospels [evangelia] and Acts; Dp for a different book, Codex Claromontanus, that contains Paul’s letters). Eventually, however, Gregory agreed to Kenyon’s suggestion to establish a separate list for papyri. But as the twentieth century progressed, more substantial papyrus remains came to light, including nearly complete books containing works from the New Testament. Kenyon’s original reasoning for establishing an independent classification for papyri thus became less and less compelling. Nevertheless, disciplinary inertia has kept\n\nPrologue\n\n19\n\nthe lists separate with the result that texts preserved on papyrus tend to enjoy an unearned prestige. The “New Testament” in “New Testament papyri” is no less problematic. If some scholars are correct that a few Christian papyri were copied as early as the second century (as we will see, none can actually be dated with any certainty to that period), then the designation of any such manuscript as “New Testament” would be highly ambiguous, if not totally meaningless. The very phrase “New Testament” (Greek: kaine¯ diathe¯ke¯) was still only tentatively being applied to Christian writings at the end of the second century.58 And even after that time, it was not at all a settled question exactly which books would be included under such a heading. That problem would be debated for centuries. Furthermore, as best we can tell, none of our extant manuscripts copied on papyrus contains even half of the twenty-­seven documents that would come to be called “the New Testament” in later centuries. Thus, one can in all honesty say that there isn’t really any such thing as “a New Testament papyrus.” I draw attention to this system not because I think it is useless or unhelpful, but rather because I want to emphasize that our systems of classification are not in any sense natural or neutral. They create meanings and provide certain artifacts with importance and power while at the same time directing attention away from other artifacts and generally distracting us from the archaeology of the manuscripts. For instance, consider the designation 𝔓72. For biblical scholars, this sign refers to a Greek manuscript containing Jude and the two letters of Peter. But the codex that contained these works (LDAB 2565) also contained several other early Christian writings, including the Nativity of Mary, the “apocryphal” correspondence of Paul and the Corinthians, the eleventh Ode of Solomon, and the paschal sermon of Melito of Sardis. What is more, the “New Testament” texts, Jude and the letters of Peter, appear to have originally been parts of different books before being bound together secondarily. Referring to these three works in isolation as the “New Testament papyrus” 𝔓72 is at best confusing and at worst misleading.59 The use of Gregory’s “𝔓” numbers tends to flatten manuscripts into a single dimension— their usefulness in the text-critical enterprise. For these reasons, I for the most part avoid Gregory’s “𝔓” numbers in this book. I refer\n\n20 Prologue\n\nto the manuscripts using the usual papyrological abbreviations or other customary designations, which, I think, do a better job of keeping us as aware as possible of the archaeological contexts and/or modern collection histories of the manuscripts.60 Finally, having made this critique, I am not unaware of the irony that this book focuses on the Beatty Biblical Papyri, the Bodmer Papyri, and the Oxyrhynchus Christian materials—groups of manuscripts that have gained fame in large part because they have been regarded as including several of the “earliest New Testament papyri.” And because of the nature of these collections, my focus is mostly limited to Greek and Coptic books to the exclusion of, for example, early Christian books copied in Syriac.61 That broader contextualization would be useful, but I must draw lines somewhere, and coming from a background in biblical studies, I hope that a focus on these three corpora will provide the type of critical introductory book I wish had existed back when I first began my own work on early Christian manuscripts.\n\nchapter one\n\nThe Early Christian Book\n\nhe majority of christian books copied before the fifth century CE survive in the form of a single fragmentary leaf, or, if we are lucky, fragments of multiple leaves. Some books, however, survived antiquity completely intact, or nearly so. Of these, many that were discovered before the middle of the twentieth century were either rebound in modern bindings or disassembled by placing the individual pages between glass plates, with little or no attention paid to recording the details of how they were originally put together. We are fortunate that in a few cases, records of varying quality were kept, and in a few very exceptional cases, ancient Christian books survive for us today in roughly the condition in which they were discovered. Over the decades, scholars have been able to use this evidence to reconstruct how ancient books, including early Christian books, were originally assembled.1 In this chapter, I try to provide sufficient information for a good working knowledge of early book production, which will be helpful in understanding some of the arguments in Chapter 2 and elsewhere about the dates assigned to early Christian books. But I should begin by posing the question: What exactly do we mean by an “early Christian book”? We should first examine the noun. Before about the third century CE, the word “book” (biblos or biblion in Greek, volumen in Latin) invariably referred to rolls. They were the main vehicle for the transmission of literature up until the 21\n\n22\n\nThe Early Christian Book\n\nearly Christian period, when the codex overtook the roll as the chief medium for literature. Using the Leuven Database, we can get a rough sense of the change over time.2 For the first century, codices account for virtually zero percent of surviving books. Codices make up about 5 percent of books assigned to the second century, about 24 percent of books assigned to the third century, about 79 percent of books assigned to the fourth century, and about 96 percent of books assigned to the fifth century. The major shift seems to have occurred over the course of the third and fourth centuries, the same period when many Christians transitioned from being members of a persecuted minority to positions of political power in the Roman Empire. Although we will encounter a few Christian rolls in the following pages, “the book” in the early Christian centuries was almost always the codex. The adjective “early” also merits attention. Studies of ancient Christian manuscripts are frequently limited to the period before the fourth century, or, if the “great majuscules” are to be included, the period before the end of the fourth century.3 I draw evidence from a wider time frame on two grounds. First, for reasons that will be outlined in Chapter 2, it is in most cases impossible to differentiate a book produced in the third century from a book produced in the fourth century. Thus, restricting oneself to “pre–fourth century” manuscripts is somewhat arbitrary because the criteria used to determine what should be placed in that category doubtless color the resulting set of data. Second, the primary foci of this book are the Beatty Biblical Papyri, the Bodmer Papyri, and the fragmentary Oxyrhynchus Christian books. These assemblages include books that were made perhaps as early as the second century to perhaps as late as the seventh century. I therefore draw comparative evidence freely from this whole period. It is true that changes affecting the production of Christian books took place over that time span. The reign of Constantine was surely an important turning point, after which we may imagine that Christian books were produced in greater numbers and more lavish formats. Yet it is clear that there was also continuity in the techniques of book production throughout Late Antiquity, and if the experts who assign dates are even close to correct, it is also the case that synchronic variation in the construction of\n\nThe Early Christian Book\n\n23\n\nChristian books was just as wide as diachronic variation in the early centuries of the Christian era. Last but not least, we need to consider the modifier “Christian.”4 This is deceptively simple: A Christian book is a book containing text that we identify as Christian. Fair enough. But what about a book containing literature that only might be Christian (such as a copy of the Jewish scriptures in Greek)? How do we distinguish between a Jewish book and a Christian book? Or what about a book containing what we might call “pagan” (or, better, “classical”) material that is found among a collection of books that also includes gospels, letters of Paul, and other identifiably Christian compositions? Surely, in some important way, such copies of “classical” literature are also “Christian” books. Or what about a work that has no specifically Christian content but is composed by an author we know to be a Christian? We will encounter each of these situations in the following chapters. Fortunately, most of the books I discuss are not so ambiguous; a majority of scholars would agree that they are “Christian books.” The claim that Christians demonstrated a preference for the codex format well before others in the Roman world rests in large part upon the early dates often assigned to Christian codices.5 It is perhaps more prudent to say simply that the vast majority of Christian books that have survived are in the codex rather than the roll format. The exact origins of the codex and the reasons for its eventual replacement of the roll are matters of debate.6 Papyrologists unanimously see the codex as a derivation from joined sets of wooden tablets used for memoranda and educational purposes.7 But at what point did parchment and papyrus codices begin to be used for the more permanent preservation and transmission of literature? The Roman poet Martial mentions parchment codices, apparently large enough to contain at least the Iliad in a single volume, near the end of the first century CE.8 In a recently rediscovered text written in the late second century, the Roman physician Galen recounts the loss of his medical recipes kept in deluxe parchment codices that were burned in a fire at Rome. While these codices did not contain literature, they were not simply ephemeral notebooks. Galen reports that they were extremely expensive and the type of item that was passed\n\n24\n\nThe Early Christian Book\n\nfrom one generation to the next.9 We also possess a papyrus document from Egypt probably from the second century describing the purchase of what seem to be parchment codices (membranai ) that the buyers had “collated” (antebalomen), which suggests the sale of inscribed parchment codices.10 So, the parchment codex seems to have been known in both Rome and Egypt by the second century. Papyrus codices, on the other hand, do not appear to be mentioned in literary sources during this early period, but they are better represented in terms of actual extant examples (if the dates assigned to these artifacts are correct). The LDAB presently assigns twenty-­eight papyrus codices to the period before 200 CE but only one parchment codex.11 Of these, seven are identified as Christian, which does represent a sizable percentage, but with such small numbers of extant books and the uncertainties of dating assignments, it is hard to know what to make of this statistic. But in whatever way we assess the role of Christians in the spread of the codex, the fact remains that when we speak of early Christian books, we almost always mean codices.\n\nMaterials Most of the books that form the focus of the present study were constructed from papyrus or parchment and inscribed with ink. Papyrus was made by first cutting thin strips from the stem of the papyrus plant and then placing them closely side by side (without overlapping) on a flat surface.12 Then a second layer of strips was placed in the same fashion on top of the first but oriented at a right angle to the first layer of strips. The two layers were pressed together and dried. The two sides of the resulting surface, a kolle¯ma (plural kolle¯mata), would have papyrus fibers running at a perpendicular angle. Several kolle¯mata constructed in this way, usually twenty to twenty-five centimeters wide, were then pasted together to form long rolls.13 The overlapping area of a few centimeters where the pasting occurred is known as a kolle¯sis (plural kolle¯seis). According to a recent analysis, blank rolls usually consisted of twenty such pasted kolle¯mata (if copyists required longer rolls, they could simply glue a new roll to the end of another). These rolls would usually be about twenty-five to thirty-three centimeters high. They would be rolled\n\nThe Early Christian Book\n\n25\n\nup from right to left with the horizontal fibers on the inside of the roll and the vertical fibers on the outside.14 Before the third century, and the increased popularity of the codex, works of literature would usually just be copied on to one or more such rolls. The roll was thus a simple production relative to the more complicated codex. The standard roll was inscribed on the horizontal fibers because it is easier to write along the horizontal fibers rather than against the vertical fibers and because the written surface, being on the inside of the roll, was protected. In some cases, a work would continue to be copied on the back side (that is, the side with vertical fibers). Scholars call such a roll an “opisthograph.” In other cases, a roll would be used for one work, and then later, the blank back side with vertical fibers would be used to copy something else, possibly another work of literature, but more usually some sort of everyday document.15 When codices came to be produced, the sheets were usually cut from blank rolls, as we can see from the frequent presence of kolle¯seis on leaves of codices.16 It seems that only in exceptional cases were papyrus sheets not cut from a roll but instead were “custom made” for a codex.17 Parchment is animal skin that has been processed to create a surface amenable to writing.18 It is most often produced from the skin of sheep, calves, or goats. The term “vellum” is occasionally reserved for writing surfaces produced from calf skin, but it is also sometimes used interchangeably with “parchment.” Parchment is prepared by removing the hair from the flayed animal hide using various methods, including mechanical removal (scraping) and chemical baths, and then stretching and drying the processed hide under tension (as opposed to the production of leather, which involves soaking the depilated hide in tanning agents and a drying process that does not involve a high degree of tension). The result of the parchment-making process is an animal membrane that is fixed in a taut, stretched form that is durable, although it is much more liable to water damage than is leather. Additional scraping while the skin is under tension brings the parchment to the desired thickness. The surfaces of the two sides of the skin differ in color and texture, with the external surface (the hair side) being more porous and slightly darker than the internal surface (the flesh side). The natural shape of a flayed animal hide combined with the stretching and drying pro-\n\n26\n\nThe Early Christian Book\n\ncess leads to irregularly shaped pieces of parchment. Rectangular sheets could be cut from them in any dimensions, depending upon the original size of the pelt. It is hypothesized that for a large Bible like Codex Sinaiticus, a single calf or sheep pelt might have yielded only two sheets (or even just one sheet), which were about eighty-six centimeters wide and thirty-six centimeters high. Sinaiticus is estimated to have originally contained some 370 sheets. Doing the math shows that the number of animals required to produce a large, high-­ quality parchment Bible could be staggering, although it should be remembered that complete Greek Bibles were a rarity in antiquity (only four survive).19 While a few parchment fragments from Egypt are sometimes assigned to quite early dates, most of the codices considered to be the earliest extant books were constructed from papyrus. Parchment codices became more popular in the fourth century and came to be much more common than papyrus codices in the fifth century and beyond. Books were inscribed using different types of inks. A recent analysis of black inks used in the Roman era divides them into three broad groups: (1) carbon inks, which consisted of soot; (2) mixed inks, which consisted of soot mixed with metallic salts; and (3) iron gall inks, which consisted of oak galls and iron sulfate. All three types were mixed with a liquid (usually water) and a binding agent (usually gum arabic). Although there are few detailed studies of the chemical composition of surviving examples of inks, it seems that in general carbon inks were the most frequently used in Egypt in the Roman period. During the third and fourth centuries, we begin to see more inks containing metallic compounds (aging can cause these inks to appear more brown than black, which allows them to be identified without chemical analysis). The shift to metallic inks seems to roughly coincide with the shift from papyrus to parchment, which makes sense, as metallic inks tend to adhere more readily to parchment than do strictly carbon-based inks.20 At this point, it will be helpful to properly define several key words, some of which I have already used. A sheet, also called a bifolium (plural bifolia), is the basic unit of a codex. When folded, it forms two leaves. A leaf, also called a folium or folio (plural folia), is one half of a sheet. It has two sides, each of which is a page. A page\n\nThe Early Christian Book\n\n27\n\nis one face of a leaf. When a codex lies open, the page on the left is called the verso, and the page on the right is called the recto.21 A quire (sometimes called a “gathering”) is a stack of folded sheets, which yields double that number of leaves and quadruple that number of pages. Thus a quire of four sheets will have eight leaves and sixteen pages. Codices can be formed either by folding a large stack of sheets into one quire (a single-quire codex) or by folding and then joining smaller individual stacks of folded sheets (a multi-quire codex). The term bookblock refers to the folded stack of sheets (in the case of a single-quire codex) or to the stack of quires (in the case of a multi-quire codex).\n\nStacking the Sheets As the sheets were cut from the papyrus rolls, they could be stacked in different ways. They might be stacked with the horizontal fibers facing up, or they might be stacked with the vertical fibers facing up. Another method was to stack the sheets in an alternating pattern (one sheet with horizontal fibers facing up, the next sheet with vertical fibers facing up). Papyrus sheets stacked in that way, when folded, will yield a quire in which facing pages will always have the same fiber orientation (Figure 1.1). We see a related phenomenon in the quires of parchment codices, in which facing pages are usually both hair side or both flesh side. Such parchment codices are sometimes described as conforming to “Gregory’s Rule,” since Caspar René Gregory was allegedly the first person to note the practice in a classic article.22 Single-quire papyrus codices could be composed of a surprisingly large stack of sheets. A codex containing the books of Ezekiel, Daniel, Susanna, and Esther in Greek, parts of which are held in several different institutions (LDAB 3090), had at least fifty-nine sheets, or 236 pages.23 Such thick single-quire codices are rare, and for good reason. Large quires can be difficult to keep closed; they tend to spring open. More importantly, as a single stack of identically sized sheets increases in height, the folded quire tends to bulge, and the central-most leaves protrude. Our existing samples of large single-quire codices show that this excess was either trimmed off\n\n28\n\nThe Early Christian Book\n\nFigure 1.1. Papyrus stack with alternating horizontal and vertical faces up, before and after folding.\n\nafter binding or avoided altogether by cutting sheets that gradually decreased in width. The result is that the central leaves of large single-­quire codices have a progressively smaller space for writing.24 The multi-quire codex escapes these difficulties. Multi-quire codices were generally composed of smaller groups of sheets, especially groups of three sheets (a ternio, six leaves, twelve pages), four sheets (a quaternio, eight leaves, sixteen pages), or five sheets (a quinio, ten leaves, twenty pages).25 The formation that came to be preferred was the quaternio or quaternion (from which English “quire” is derived). The earliest codices, however, were often composed of quires containing differing numbers of sheets. For example, a parchment codex containing Jeremiah, Lamentations, the Epistle of Jeremiah, and Baruch in Coptic (LDAB 108176) is reported to be composed of nine quaterniones and one ternio, while a Coptic codex in the British Library (LDAB 107763) containing an intriguing mix of works\n\nThe Early Christian Book\n\n29\n\n(Deuteronomy, Jonah, and the book of Acts) is reported to be composed of a mix of quiniones and seniones (quires of six sheets).26\n\nJoining the Sheets: Single-Quire Codices Single-quire codices could be bound different ways. Most of the Coptic codices discovered near Nag Hammadi in 1945 were single-­ quire constructions. The folded papyrus quire was placed into a leather cover. In most cases, an extra strip of leather (the spine lining strip) lay between the leather cover and the spine of the quire. The sheets were bound using two separate tackets (cords of leather or vegetal fibers) that pierced through the sheets of the quire at the central fold of the codex and through the spine strip and were tied at the back of the spine, either inside or outside the leather covers that encased the quire (Figure 1.2).27 The tackets also passed through leather stays that rested between the tacket and the central papyrus sheet in the quire, thus protecting the papyrus from rubbing against the tacket. One of the two small rectangular stays in the center of Nag Hammadi Codex VI is visible in Figure 1.3. Alternatively, a single-quire codex could be sewn by “stabbing,” that is, sewing the spine through a series of holes punched through the folded quire\n\nFigure 1.2.

This method could be carried out with a single thread or with separate threads, one near the top of the codex and one near the bottom. Another method, the “whipstitch” (“overcasting” or “oversewing”) involves sewing the thread through holes in the quire punched at a slight remove from the central fold and wrapping the thread around the outside of the spine in a helical pattern. Both stabbing and overcasting seem to have been employed on a small codex found in the Monastery of Epiphanius containing acrostic hymns in Greek and Coptic (LDAB 6416, Figure 1.4). As Figure 1.4 indicates, sewing by the stabbing method or overcasting method leaves a pattern of holes in the individual sheets that straddles the central fold. Codices bound in the manner of the Nag Hammadi books described above\n\nThe Early Christian Book\n\n31\n\nFigure 1.4. P.Mon. Epiph. 592, a Greek-Coptic papyrus codex bound by overcasting and stabbing, found at the Monastery of Epiphanius at Thebes. (Detail of Walter E. Crum and H. G. Evelyn White, The Monastery of Epiphanius at Thebes, Part II [New York: Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1926], Plate I.)\n\nwould show a pattern of holes pierced directly through the central fold itself.\n\nSewing the Quires: Multi-Quire Codices Multi-quire codices were made of several independently folded stacks of sheets. The usual manner of binding for the earliest multi-quire codices was sewing by the “link-stitch” or “chain-stitch” method.28 The link-stitch also appears in a wide variety of formations, sometimes using one thread, sometimes using more. But the basic movement of the thread is standard and can be described as follows: The thread enters a sewing station, that is to say, a hole punched through the central fold of the quire; the thread proceeds within the central fold; and then it goes back through to the outside of the spine at the\n\n32\n\nThe Early Christian Book\n\nFigure 1.5. Two methods of link-stitch binding of multi-quire codices, using a continuous thread (top) or two separate threads at two independent pairs of sewing stations (bottom).

The thread then goes back up and in, either through the same sewing station from which it exited (Figure 1.5, top) or through the proximate sewing station in the quire above (Figure 1.5, bottom). The thread then pro-\n\nThe Early Christian Book\n\n33\n\nFigure 1.6. P.Bodmer XVI, codex in leather cover with stitching exposed. (Image courtesy of the Fondation Martin Bodmer, Cologny-Geneva.)\n\nceeds within the central fold to the next sewing station, and so on, climbing up to the next quire when it reaches the head or tail of the spine.29 Two common variations of the link-stitch are illustrated in Figure 1.5. The first shows a codex bound using a continuous thread passing through all the sewing stations. The second shows a codex bound by two separate threads sewn at two independent pairs of sewing stations. Ancient Greek and Coptic codices whose bindings have survived intact show a number of variations on these basic themes.30 One example in which we can see the extant stitching quite clearly is P.Bodmer XVI, a Coptic codex of Exodus (LDAB 108535) that was assigned by its editor to the fourth century. The leather cover is damaged in the area of the spine with the result that the stitching of the quires is visible. The book was composed of six parchment quires sewn using the link-stitch at two independent pairs of sewing stations. Figure 1.6 shows this codex closed with the stitching exposed; Figure 1.7 shows the codex open to the center of the fifth quire. When, as is more usual, the binding structures of codices have not been so nicely preserved, the method of binding can still sometimes be determined by examining any bits of the binding threads that may have survived in place or by examining patterns of rubbing and wear in the center of each quire. As a comparison of Figure 1.3 and Figure 1.7 indicates, the centers of the quires in multi-quire codices can have an appearance very similar to that of the centers\n\n34\n\nThe Early Christian Book\n\nFigure 1.7. P.Bodmer XVI opened at the center of the fifth quire, showing lower parchment stay. (Image courtesy of the Fondation Martin Bodmer, Cologny-Geneva.)\n\nof single-quire codices in that they also often employ parchment or leather stays that sit between the binding cords and the central sheet of each quire to prevent chaffing. In other respects, however, the sewing of the multi-quire codex is considerably more complicated and less intuitive than the relatively simple tackets or stabbing used to bind single-quire codices.\n\nThe Relationship Between Single-Quire Codices and Multi-Quire Codices This difference between the sewing techniques typically used for single-quire codices and the link-stitch of multi-quire codices raises the question of the relationship between the two types of construction. That the multi-quire codex developed from the single-quire codex is not to be doubted.31 We can even see some likely intermediary stages in that development, such as Nag Hammadi Codex I (LDAB 107741), a papyrus codex that contains quires of twenty-two\n\nThe Early Christian Book\n\n35\n\nFigure 1.8. Reconstruction of a cross section of Nag Hammadi Codex I, showing the three quires.\n\nsheets (= eighty-eight pages), eight sheets (= thirty-two pages), and six sheets (= twenty-four pages).32 As Stephen Emmel has observed, “Codex I is more like three single-quire codices bound into a single cover than it is like the usual multi-quired codices.”33 That is to say, rather than having several smaller quires bound by a continuous thread that passed through each of the quires, Codex I consisted of one large quire and two smaller quires, each of which seems to have been pierced with a single independent tacket that attached it to the cover. Only two of the three quires appear to have been attached to each other, and this was accomplished by gluing the inner edge of the last leaf of the second quire to the inner edge of the first leaf of the third quire (Figure 1.8). The result seems to have been a functional book that was somewhat awkward to use. The limitations of this kind of construction are fairly obvious. Quires joined to the cover by a single tacket are not entirely secure and are free to move within the covers, putting stress on the papyrus leaves at the point at which they are pierced by the tackets. Furthermore, adding a second tacket to each quire would double the number of holes piercing the leather cover. Leather is a very sturdy material, but an increasing number of quires would mean an increasing number of tackets piercing the cover, possibly leading to structural instability. The advantages of the link-stitch process are evident. The same threads that move through the centers of quires also link the quires at the multiple sewing stations and provide strength to the structure of the spine. The multi-\n\n36\n\nThe Early Christian Book\n\nquire codex could thus accommodate more material with greater stability. These observations do not, however, have any bearing on the dates of our surviving codices. That is to say, it is not at all the case that single-quire codices are invariably older than multi-quire codices. Rather, the variety of construction techniques of surviving codices from Egypt suggests that the rise and spread of the codex format was a drawn-out process involving both diffusion of the technology from one locality to another and independent experimentation at the local level. Refinement of construction techniques at any given time would have varied widely from place to place. In fact, it would not surprise me if the parchment codices of books such as the Iliad mentioned by Martial in the first century were multiquire constructions. Barring the use of extremely small handwriting or an unusually large format, the 15,693 lines of the Iliad would make for a quite large single-quire codex.34\n\nInscribing the Pages Copyists prepared their writing surfaces in different ways. Pliny informs us that papyrus sheets were smoothed with a piece of ivory or a shell. If papyrus surfaces have been expertly smoothed, it can be difficult to distinguish the face of the leaf with horizontal fibers from the face with vertical fibers.35 Parchment leaves would usually be ruled by gently incising guidelines into the writing surface using a straight-edge, while papyrus leaves were sometimes pricked at four corners to define the written area of the page and provide guidance in keeping the margins consistent. More detailed discussions of page preparations and scribal practice are readily available, so I mention only one mechanical question and one peculiar scribal feature of Christian manuscripts.36 First, the mechanical question: Were the leaves inscribed before or after they were bound? In the case of later medieval codices the answer is almost always copying before binding. The presence of quire signatures tends to suggest that the individual quires would be copied while unbound and then at a later point be bound together. Otherwise, why would it be necessary to keep blank quires in any particular order? Among our earliest codices, however, we can often observe copyists fairly obviously adjust-\n\nThe Early Christian Book\n\n37\n\ning the size and spacing of their writing when they have realized they might have either too few blank leaves remaining or too many blank leaves remaining, which suggests that the addition or removal of extra sheets or quires was either not possible or was a less attractive option than altering the spacing of the writing on the later pages.37 Does this mean that such codices were already bound before copying? It is difficult to say, but I suspect that codices displaying these features were in fact bound and then copied. On occasion, other pieces of evidence are more decisive. In a small papyrus codex containing the Greek version of Psalms 72–88 now in Dublin (LDAB 3158), we find a stroke of a letter written over the binding thread, which indicates that this single-quire codex was bound before it was copied.38 Similarly, when different copyists are responsible for inscribing the two halves of the same bifolium, it is reasonable to suppose that the copyists were not working simultaneously and that the quires were bound before the copying. Such is the case in an intriguing papyrus codex at the Fondation Martin Bodmer (LDAB 4120, discussed in Chapter 5 and illustrated in Figure 5.9). With more lavish codices, the process almost always involved inscribing before binding. We can see that this was the case with, for example, Codex Sinaiticus, the great parchment Bible (LDAB 3478), the leaves of which were inscribed by at least four different copyists. Important divisions in the text start at the beginnings of quires regardless of whether the preceding quire had been completely inscribed, and the resulting blank leaves were cut out.39 This is a good indication that several copyists were working simultaneously on different parts of the book before it was bound.40 Absent this kind of clear evidence, however, it is difficult to know the order of events with certainty. The only scribal feature I mention here is the peculiar Christian method of abbreviating certain words such as ⲓⲏⲥⲟⲩⲥ ( Jesus), ⲑⲉⲟⲥ (God), ⲕⲩⲣⲓⲟⲥ (Lord), and ⲭⲣⲓⲥⲧⲟⲥ (Christ). In Christian manuscripts, these words are generally shortened by contraction. Only selected letters of the word are written, and the abbreviated form was marked with a horizontal stroke above the letters. For instance, the word “God,” ⲑⲉⲟⲥ, would appear in manuscripts as ⲑⲥ. On occasion, some words are shortened by suspension. Thus, ⲓⲏⲥⲟⲩⲥ ( Jesus) can be seen as both ⲓⲥ (contraction) and ⲓⲏ (suspension). Other words, such as ⲡⲛⲉⲩⲙⲁ (spirit), ⲁⲛⲑⲣⲱⲡⲟⲥ (human), ⲩⲓⲟⲥ (son), ⲡⲁⲧⲏⲣ (fa-\n\n38\n\nThe Early Christian Book\n\nther), ⲙⲏⲧⲏⲣ (mother), ⲓⲥⲣⲁⲏⲗ (Israel), ⲓⲉⲣⲟⲩⲥⲁⲗⲏⲙ ( Jerusalem), and even ⲙⲱⲩⲥⲏⲥ (Moses), are also similarly abbreviated, though with less regularity than the first four epithets. It is a scholarly custom to call such a shortened word a nomen sacrum (plural nomina sacra).41 The execution of these abbreviations varies considerably, but the practice is almost universal among extant Christian manuscripts, so much so that the presence of a nomen sacrum is usually regarded as sufficient evidence for declaring that a given manuscript was a Christian production. By the same token, the absence of nomina sacra in, say, a codex of Genesis, is enough to persuade some scholars that such a manuscript is a Jewish rather than a Christian production.42 The origins of the practice are obscure, and no theory commands wide assent among specialists.43\n\nCovers Early Christian books display different sorts of covers, and some books may not have had a cover at all. We can place the surviving examples into two groups: covers of wood and covers of leather. As we saw, two wooden panels decorated with portraits of the evangelists served as the cover of the Freer gospel codex at the time of its purchase.44 Such wooden covers could be attached to each other by a single strip of leather running the length of the spine (a spine strip or back strip) and/or several smaller pieces of leather crossing the spine at intervals (spine slips or hinging thongs). The bookblock could be attached to the covers either through the use of adhesives (pastedowns on the inside of the cover and glue along the spine), sewing (such as incorporating the spine slips into the stitching of the bookblock itself ), or both. Covers constructed of leather were usually stiffened by wrapping the leather around stacks of blank papyrus or waste papyrus before attaching the bookblock.45 The cover could be attached to the bookblock either by means of pastedowns on the inside of the cover or by incorporating one or more leaves from the beginning and end of the bookblock into the cover itself (that is, by actually folding the leather of turn-ins of the cover over some of the leaves of the bookblock; this method was used on P.Bodmer XVI; see Figure 1.6).46 Leather covers can sometimes provide\n\nThe Early Christian Book\n\n39\n\nFigure 1.9. Inside of the leather cover of Nag Hammadi Codex I after the removal of the bookblock but before the removal of all the waste papyrus lining the cover. Two leather stays and three tackets are visible at the spine. (The cover is now MS 1804/1 in the Schøyen Collection.) (Image courtesy of the Institute for Antiquity and Christianity Records, Special Collections, Claremont Colleges Library, Claremont, California.)\n\na means of giving a relatively secure date for the construction of a codex (or at least the construction of the covers). The papyrus used to stiffen the covers often included old documents, which occasionally carry dates. This type of construction was used for the covers of some of the Nag Hammadi codices (Figure 1.9). The covers were disassembled, and the latest dated document (348 CE) was found in the cover of Codex VII (LDAB 107747), which gives us a terminus post quem, that is, the earliest possible date, for the construction of\n\n40\n\nThe Early Christian Book\n\nthe codex in the middle of the fourth century. Both wooden and leather covers were sometimes equipped with strips of leather (wrapping bands) that wrapped around the codex to keep it closed.\n\nAncient Repairing of Codices The preceding discussion indicates that a considerable amount of work went into the production of papyrus and parchment codices, especially multi-quire codices. That being the case, it is not surprising that we find different kinds of repairs made to codices. They seem to have been important possessions, used for relatively long periods of time, and subject to wear and tear.47 Repairs could take various forms. Papyrus sheets sometimes broke at the central fold. This kind of damage could be repaired by using a vertical strip of papyrus as a patch. We see this phenomenon in P.Bodmer II, a papyrus codex of the Gospel According to John (LDAB 2777).48 Any portion of a papyrus leaf could also split horizontally or vertically along the fibers of the plant. Such damage was sometimes repaired by tying a loop of thread through the damaged area. P.Bodmer XXI, a papyrus codex containing Joshua 1–6 and other material (LDAB 108537), has been repaired in this fashion in several places (Figure 1.10).49 In parchment codices, we sometimes see patches added to fix damaged leaves. Figure 1.11 shows a leaf of P.Bodmer XIX, a parchment codex containing part of the Gospel According to Matthew and part of Romans (LDAB 107759), which has been patched at its outer edge. Makers of parchment codices sometimes applied patches during the initial preparation of the sheets to cover over holes or other imperfections in the treated skins. The patches visible on the leaves of P.Bodmer XIX are found on the edges of leaves, areas that would be especially liable to damage due to heavy usage. For that reason, I assume that such patches in this codex are later repairs. The same codex also nicely illustrates the phenomenon of rebinding, which appears to have been quite common.50 As it exists now, the book contains only a portion of Matthew and three leaves of Romans. The last leaf of Romans is pasted to a wooden panel that would have been the back cover of the book. The first inscribed leaf at the beginning of the codex contains only the words “Last Part of Matthew” in a hand distinct from that of the rest of the codex. It\n\nThe Early Christian Book\n\n41\n\nFigure 1.10. P.Bodmer XXI, showing ancient repair of a damaged papyrus leaf using a loop of thread. (Image courtesy of the Fondation Martin Bodmer, Cologny-Geneva.)\n\nseems to be functioning as a title for this rebound codex, the leaves of which were once part of a larger codex.51\n\nModern Conservation of Early Christian Codices The early Christian codices fortunate enough to survive the ravages of time have come to us in widely varying states of preservation. The vast majority of the earliest codices are represented by just fragments of a single leaf or perhaps two leaves. Generally, these scraps are flattened and mounted between panes of glass. And in fact, even those books that did survive in better states of preservation have often been disassembled after their discovery. In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, conservators like the renowned Hugo Ibscher (1874–1943) would take apart even reasonably well-preserved codices and place the individual leaves between panes of glass (Figure 1.12). The benefit of this type of conservation\n\nFigure 1.11. P.Bodmer XIX, showing ancient repair of the damaged edge of a parchment leaf using a parchment patch. (Image courtesy of the Fondation Martin Bodmer, Cologny-Geneva.)\n\nFigure 1.12. Hugo Ibscher at work on the Manichaean codices from Medinet Madi in 1934. (Image originally published in Illustrierter Beobachter, February 10, 1934, p. 186.)\n\n44\n\nThe Early Christian Book\n\nis that it permits close study of individual folia or bifolia with a lower risk of further damage to the leaves. Early scholars were understandably interested in making the most careful possible study of the texts carried on the manuscripts. The drawback is the loss of the sometimes crucial information that could have been provided by the intact binding structures. Also lost is simply the sense of the ancient book as a three-dimensional object. For this reason, the writings of Ibscher and other conservators can be excellent resources for those interested in the construction of Christian books. Ibscher’s desk in Berlin was an early stop for many of the most important early Christian codices found between the 1890s and the 1930s, including the Chester Beatty Biblical Papyri and the Manichaean codices from Medinet Madi. As he took apart these bookblocks and framed the individual leaves, Ibscher often recorded his observations about various aspects of book production.52 Although his descriptions are not as detailed as we might like, they nonetheless provide valuable evidence, given that he had the benefit of seeing many codices in a state near to that in which they were discovered. Only a very few of the earliest Christian codices exist today in something like that condition. One example is a parchment codex now in Barcelona that contains the Gospels According to Luke, John, and Mark in Coptic (LDAB 107904, 107905, and 107760; Figure 1.13). This book is not especially large (16.5 cm by 20 cm), but it is a quality production written on parchment in a spacious two-­ column layout. It is usually assigned on the basis of its handwriting to the fifth century. Its wooden covers and parts of its leather binding structures are very well preserved. It was bound by the linkstitch method using two separate threads sewn at two independent pairs of sewing stations (see Figure 1.5, bottom). In its present form, the book helps us to imagine ancient Christian codices in something approaching their original state. Yet, the excellent appearance of the book now is at least a bit deceptive, for this book is a product of the antiquities market, and when it emerged from that market in the 1970s, it did not look this good. Many of the leaves were detached, and the whole object had to be reassembled through the efforts of dedicated scholars and conservators.53 Unlike the conservators of this codex, their predecessors working during the first half of the twentieth century were essentially\n\nFigure 1.13. P.PalauRib. inv. 181–183, parchment codex containing the Gospels According to Luke, John, and Mark in Coptic bound in wooden covers, shown here closed and open. (Images courtesy of the Arxiu històric dels jesuïtes de Catalunya.)\n\n46\n\nThe Early Christian Book\n\nmaking up the craft as they worked. Thus, some earlier techniques of preservation (such as the use of clear adhesive tape, which became popular for a period in the middle of the twentieth century) are now recognized as less than ideal. Twenty-first-century conservators often spend a good deal of their time undoing the conservation efforts of their early-twentieth-century forerunners.54 Still, the increased knowledge of recent decades has not entirely prevented further destruction of early Christian books, especially those that have been badly handled after their discovery. Most recently, one can look at the case of the antiquities dealer Bruce Ferrini, who did irreparable damage to the so-called Tchacos codex (LDAB 108481), which contains the famous Gospel of Judas, by placing it in a freezer.55 This action was devastating to the papyrus leaves of the codex, as the moisture in the fibers expanded in the freezing process and left the thawed papyrus highly liable to crumbling. This is just one of the many horror stories that could be told about books on the antiquities market. When we turn to books that have been properly excavated and immediately conserved, however, we can often see the latest scientific knowledge put to good use in preserving extremely fragile books that might not have survived had they been discovered a century ago.56 Each area I have discussed in this chapter could be, and on occasion has been, the topic of its own book. The overview that I have presented here should provide a sufficient orientation for readers to appreciate the discussions of books in the following chapters. I have not delved into questions of who produced these codices.57 Were they all written by Christians? Did the same person who manufactured a codex also inscribe it? How much training and what type of training did the copyists have? The answers will of course vary from book to book, and other scholars have pondered these questions in great detail.58 My focus is on the artifacts themselves, but I hope that close attention to the books will at least help us better frame our questions about who made them, used them, preserved them, and, eventually, got rid of them.\n\nchapter two\n\nThe Dating Game\n\nH\n\now do we know how old an ancient manuscript is? The answer depends on the type of manuscript. What papyrologists call “documents,” that is, receipts, deeds, tax returns, official government proclamations—in short, nonliterary texts—often preserve the dates on which they were copied, just as such documents still do today. In Roman Egypt, it was common practice to date documents by combining the regnal years of emperors with the traditional system of Egyptian months. P.Amh. 2.78 is a typical example. It is a petition to a centurion detailing complaints against one Hekusis Euporas, and it carries a date of “the twenty-fifth year of Marcus Aurelius Commodus Antoninus Augustus, Thoth 30,” which in terms of the Gregorian calendar would be September 26 of the year 184 CE.1 So we can often know the dates of documents like these down to the very day that they were copied. But we are interested in manuscripts that contain early Christian literature, which would have no occasion for including such specific dates. Beginning around the ninth century, some copies of Greek biblical manuscripts do give us dates in the form of colophons, that is, short notes to the reader from the scribe who copied the manuscript. Figure 2.1 shows a manuscript of the four gospels. The book is open to the last page of the Gospel According to John, and at the bottom of the page we find a short message from the copyist: “Writ47\n\nFigure 2.1. British Library, Add. Ms. 5107, a parchment codex of the four gospels. The colophon at the base of the page indicates that the book was copied in 1159 CE. (Image by permission of the British Library, London, UK/Bridgeman Images.)\n\nThe Dating Game\n\n49\n\nten by the hand of Nepho, worthless and sinful monk, in the month of April, in the seventh indiction, in the year 6667.” This method of dating was based on the (still alarmingly common) assumption that the world was created in September of 5509 BCE, so we can simply do the math: 6667−5509 (+ 1, because of the difference in how new years were reckoned) = 1159 CE.2 If only it were always so easy! But colophons with dates like this begin to become common in Greek biblical manuscripts only in the ninth century. How do we assign dates to literary papyrus and parchment books from earlier periods? Again, it depends on the specific manuscript. We can almost never be so precise as to know the exact year, or even the exact decade, that a manuscript was copied, but certain features of some manuscripts can help us narrow the window of possible dates. The following discussion introduces a variety of methods that we can use to estimate the date of undated manuscripts: by looking at their contents, by studying their reuse, by comparatively analyzing the handwriting used to copy the manuscript (paleography), and finally by deploying more technologically involved methodologies such as radiocarbon dating and ink analysis.\n\nEstablishing Limits Different sorts of circumstances can on occasion allow us to discern the earliest possible date a manuscript was copied (what scholars call the terminus post quem, “point after which”) or a latest possible date at which it was copied (the terminus ante quem, “point before which”). For instance, the contents of a manuscript may establish a terminus post quem. Among early Christian texts, good examples of this phenomenon are copies of martyrdoms. They are set at precise moments in time, usually ascertainable by the Roman official who is prosecuting the Christians. P.Bodmer XX (LDAB 220465) is a copy of the Apology of Phileas, which recounts the trial of the bishop Phileas under the Roman prefect of Egypt, Clodius Culcianus. Figure 2.2 shows a leaf from this codex. Other versions of this text in fact tell us the exact date of the martyrdom: the twenty-first year of Diocletian, that is, 305 CE.3 The composition of this text, and hence the copying of the Bodmer manuscript, happened at some point after that. How long after Phileas was martyred might this particular manu-\n\n50\n\nThe Dating Game\n\nFigure 2.2. P.Bodmer XX, the Apology of Phileas. Since Phileas was killed in 305 CE, we know this codex was copied sometime after that date. (Image courtesy of the Fondation Martin Bodmer, Cologny-Geneva.)\n\nscript have been copied? This is an open question.4 The only thing we can say with certainty is that this manuscript was copied after 305. Another instance in which a limit for dating can be established is when a manuscript is reused. Recall that for ancient users of papyrus rolls, the “front” surface is almost always the side on which the fibers of the papyrus plant run horizontally. On the “back” surface,\n\nThe Dating Game\n\n51\n\nthe papyrus fibers run vertically.5 On occasion, pieces of papyrus that had already been written along the horizontal fibers were turned over and reused. This kind of reuse can be helpful for dating an undated literary manuscript in two different ways. First, a literary manuscript can be reused for a dated document. Such is the case of P.Ryl. 1.16 (LDAB 2661), a fragment of a roll of an unknown comedy written along the horizontal fibers (Figure 2.3). It was reused for a letter written in either January 253 or January 256 CE.6 This fact gives us a terminus ante quem for P.Ryl. 1.16, which must have been written earlier than 256 CE. How much earlier? Again, it is difficult to say. To propose an answer, we must resort to analyzing the handwriting. Acknowledged experts in the field disagree by seventy-­five years, with one renowned scholar claiming that P.Ryl. 1.16 was copied “about 150 CE” and another equally respected authority saying it was copied between 220 and 225.7 This wide range of possibilities, even for such a relatively “datable” piece as P.Ryl. 1.16, highlights the difficulty of using handwriting to try to assign specific dates to undated manuscripts. The second way reuse can be helpful for establishing a date for a literary manuscript is essentially the opposite situation—when a dated documentary roll is reused for a piece of literature. For example, P.Oxy. 12.1444 is a portion of a report concerning payments of grain from 248–249 CE written along the fibers. At some point after that, the documentary roll was turned over and upside down, and its reverse was reused for a copy of some orations, published as P.Oxy. 11.1366 (LDAB 2432, Figur"
