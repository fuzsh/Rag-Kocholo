        "text": "This article tackles the issue of the possible Egyptian provenance of the Gospel of Thomas (GTh). By the beginning of the third century, GTh already circulated in the Christian circles of Alexandria. Furthermore, at least one version of this document had been transmitted to Oxyrhynchus before 200 C.E., that is, prior to the terminus ad quem for one of the Greek manuscripts of Thomas. In order to reassess this hypothesis, the author delves into the problem of origin of Egyptian monasticism and examines the earliest attestations about the use of GTh in Alexandria (Origen) and Asia Minor (Hippolytus). This inquiry leads to a negative result concerning the possible Egyptian birthplace of Thomas, and allows for the existence of an earlier stratum of sayings in GTh deriving from a first-century source. Due to the paucity of historical data, such a hypothesis would hardly be tenable in the Egyptian context. Therefore, the most one could suggest at this point of research is that the GTh reached Alexandria from Palestine or Asia Minor, where it had already been known in the first half of the second century.\n\nWithin the relevant literature there have been different (often conflicting) approaches to the issue of the sources of the Gospel of Thomas. This topic is connected to the relationship between Th and the Synoptics (and other early Christian texts)—hence, to the vexata quaestio of Th’s “dependence”/“independence.” The article begins with some methodological considerations on the composition and sources of Th, also trying to provide a list of the sources that have been proposed for this gospel. The second part examines the possibility of a relationship between Th and the Pauline epistles, a theme which is emerging with new perspectives in the research on Th’s sources and parallels: some of Th’s logia seem to have connections with certain Pauline trajectories and texts. The final part focuses on Th 17 and 1 Cor 2:9, also exploring their relationship with some parallel texts (e.g. 1 Clem. 34.8, Turfan M 789, and 1 John 1:1), in order to investigate the possible sources of Th 17.\n\nSeven years, and a bibliography of over 100 pages: that is what Detlev Koepke invested in researching the gospel of Thomas. Over 600 carefully worded pages disclose in great detail his intricate study and findings on Jesus in the gospel of Thomas as well as in the New Testament, and Q. Mary Magdalene, John the Baptist and James are discussed in a separate chapter each, and we are presented with a full translation from Coptic, and a commentary on the gospel of Thomas. The second half of this book focuses on the New Testament and history of Christianity: its historical background, Josephus, Paul, the Roman Empire and Christian persecution are some of the highlights. Detlev Koepke passed away in 2015, leaving behind a truly majestic piece of work on the gospel of Thomas, its relation to Christianity, and the historical Jesus. A most complete work on the combination of these topics. Detlev Koepke was fluent in 4 languages, and learned ancient Greek and Coptic specifically for and during his research. Most of his research was conducted utilising Harvard Divinity School library as well as his own extensive personal library: \"no stone has been left unturned\". 2021 edition, republished with permission from his son, David Koepke ______________________ +++Version Management+++ Includes Discussion content (92 pages) - see https://www.academia.edu/57161277/Publication_List_and_Discussion_Content_access\n\nWhat should our primary goal be as readers and interpreters of the Gospel of Thomas? Which form of the gospel text should we privilege, if any? I suggest that we should seek literary questions and literary answers about Thomas. The text obviously must have meant something to the many readers that we might imagine using the surviving Egyptian manuscripts. Perhaps the arrangement or sequence of statements and groups of statements does indeed convey meaning, though not necessarily the sort of meaning that we see even in other sayings gospels or in wisdom books. To explore this possibility requires adopting a more literary sensibility, a focusing of attention on reading the text in its own terms, searching out its hermeneutical soteriology. The task is difficult, and the meanings provided by stark juxtapositions are not always obvious. Perhaps that obscurity is already part of the point."
