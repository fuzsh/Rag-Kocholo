Treatment of these presentations is difficult and challenging. A 44-year-old woman was referred to the dermatology clinic with chronic painful lichen planus-related gingivitis and buccal erosions. She has failed multiple treatments including topical clobetasol and tacrolimus, intralesional corticosteroids and several systemic and immunosuppressive agents. Following completion of three months of treatment with oral apremilast at a dose of 30 mg twice daily, significant improvement was noted in her disease activity. Oral apremilast may be a safe and effective treatment for erosive oral lichen planus.\n\nPerceived oral health status and treatment needs of dental auxiliaries.\n\nPubMed\n\nAzodo, Clement C; Ehizele, Adebola O; Umoh, Agnes; Ojehanon, Patrick I; Akhionbare, Osagie; Okechukwu, Robinson; Igbinosa, Lawrence\n\n2010-03-15\n\nTo determine the perceived oral health status and treatment needs of Nigerian dental therapists in training and dental technology students. A descriptive cross-sectional study of students from Federal School of Dental Therapy and Technology Enugu, Nigeria was conducted using self-administered questionnaire to obtain information on demography, self-reported oral health status, knowledge of impact of oral health on daily life activity, dental attendance and perceived dental need. The perception of oral health status and treatment need of the two groups of dental auxiliaries was the same. Fewer respondents (27.3%) rated their oral health as excellent, while 50.4% rated their oral health as good. Majority (95.5%) agreed that oral health is a part of general health and 94.6% agreed that oral health has a role in daily life. Out of 81.4% that had previous dental treatment, scaling and polishing accounted for 66.1%. Presently, 48.8% think they need dental treatment ranging from scaling and polishing (33.9%), tooth restoration (10.3%), to extraction (1.2%). This survey revealed that most of the students are aware that oral health is a component of general health and that it has an impact on an individual's daily life. More than half of the students perceived their oral health as good, but only a few knew that there is a need for a preventive approach to oral health as evident by the percentage that perceived scaling and polishing as a treatment need.\n\nCross-cultural differences in oral impacts on daily performance between Greek and British older adults.\n\nPubMed\n\nTsakos, G; Marcenes, W; Sheiham, A\n\n2001-12-01\n\nTo examine whether there are significant cross-cultural differences in oral health-related quality of life and perceived treatment need between older people of similar clinical oral status living in Greece and Britain. Cross-sectional surveys of adults living independently aged 65 years or older. In Britain, data from the national diet and nutrition survey were used, while the Greek sample was drawn from two municipalities in Athens. Participants 753 in Britain and 681 in Greece. Oral health-related quality of life, assessed through the modified Oral Impacts on Daily Performance (OIDP) indicator, and perceived need for dental treatment. Thirty-nine per cent of Greek and 12.3% of British dentate and 47.6% of Greek and 16.3% of British edentulous participants had experienced oral impacts affecting their daily life in the last six months. The most prevalent impact was difficulty eating. Apart from that, 56.3% of Greek and 37.1% of British dentate and 33.5% of Greek and 25.3% of British edentulous participants perceived dental treatment need. After controlling for sociodemographic variables, perceived general health and clinical oral status, Greek dentate and edentulous participants were significantly more likely to experience oral impacts than their British counterparts, while in relation to perceived treatment need significant cross-cultural differences existed only between dentate respondents. The results indicated an independent cultural influence in the perception of oral impacts in older people.\n\nA Comparison of Betamethasone Valerate 0.1% Cream Twice Daily Plus Oral Simvastatin Versus Betamethasone Valerate 0.1% Cream Alone in the Treatment of Vitiligo Patients.\n\nPubMed\n\nIraji, Fariba; Banihashemi, Seyed Hossin; Faghihi, Gita; Shahmoradi, Zabihollah; Tajmirriahi, Nabet; Jazi, Safoura Bokaie\n\n2017-01-01\n\nVitiligo, a common disorder of depigmentation, is often difficult to treat. Corticosteroids are known to be effective, but with modest results. Although simvastatin has been reported to be effective for immunorelated dermatologic disorders including vitiligo, controlled trials are lacking. This study was conducted to compare the efficacy of topical betamethasone valerate 0.1% cream (as a standard method of treatment for vitiligo) versus a combination of betamethasone valerate plus oral simvastatin in the treatment of vitiligo. Eighty-eight subjects with symmetric vitiligo who had body surface involvement up to 20% were divided randomly into two groups. Group A were treated with betamethasone valerate 01% cream twice daily and Group B with betamethasone valerate 01% cream twice daily and oral simvastatin 80 mg daily for 12 weeks. Finally, 46 patients completed treatment after 12 weeks in both groups. The results were evaluated by a blind dermatologist using Vitiligo Area Scoring Index (VASI) score at baseline, 4 th , 8 th , and 12 th week of treatment. In a similar way, subjective assessment performed by patients based on photo evaluation at the end of the study. Despite a continuous reduction in VASI score in both groups, according to both physician ( P = 0.13) and patient ( P = 0.374) assessment oral simvastatin was not statistically more effective than conventional treatment of vitiligo. This study indicates that oral simvastatin is not associated with significant impacts in the treatment of vitiligo as compared to other inflammatory dermatologic conditions such as psoriasis. Indeed, other studies should be initiated regarding exact molecular and cellular effects of statins in the treatment of vitiligo.\n\nA Comparison of Betamethasone Valerate 0.1% Cream Twice Daily Plus Oral Simvastatin Versus Betamethasone Valerate 0.1% Cream Alone in the Treatment of Vitiligo Patients\n\nPubMed Central\n\nIraji, Fariba; Banihashemi, Seyed Hossin; Faghihi, Gita; Shahmoradi, Zabihollah; Tajmirriahi, Nabet; Jazi, Safoura Bokaie\n\n2017-01-01\n\nBackground: Vitiligo, a common disorder of depigmentation, is often difficult to treat.

Patients diagnosed with Oral Leukoplakia, Oral submucous fibrosis and Oral Lichen Planus attending the Oral Medicine clinic of Panineeya Institute of Dental Sciences & Research Centre, Hyderabad, India were invited to participate. Eighteen interviews and three focus groups were conducted in a non-clinical setting. Voice recordings were transcribed and translated from Telugu to English. Data coding was performed using the NVivo software. Sample size for this qualitative study comprised 32 patients. Four main themes emerged: (1) difficulties with diagnosis and knowledge about the condition, (2) physical impairment and functional limitations, (3) psychological and social wellbeing and (4) effects of treatment on daily life. In a majority of the patients, most of the interview time was spent discussing physical impairment and functional limitations. Patients also reported their mouth condition having a debilitating effect on their psychological well-being and social interactions. 'Physical impairment and functional limitations' was the most important theme for many of the patients. However, the impacts of OPMD also extended beyond physical impairment and functional limitations to aspects of daily living, notably psychological and social wellbeing.\n\nThe efficacy and safety of oral pharmacokinetically enhanced amoxycillin-clavulanate 2000/125 mg, twice daily, versus oral amoxycillin-clavulanate 1000/125 mg, three times daily, for the treatment of bacterial community-acquired pneumonia in adults.\n\nPubMed\n\nPetitpretz, Patrick; Chidiac, Christian; Soriano, Francisco; Garau, Javier; Stevenson, Katharine; Rouffiac, Elisabeth\n\n2002-08-01\n\nThis double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group study was designed to show that a pharmacokinetically enhanced formulation of oral amoxycillin-clavulanate (16:1, 2000/125 mg), twice daily, is at least as effective clinically and microbiologically as oral amoxycillin-clavulanate 1000/125 mg, three times daily, in the 10 day treatment of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in adults. The pharmacokinetically enhanced formulation is designed to provide higher serum concentrations of amoxycillin for a longer period than standard dosing to achieve coverage of Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates with amoxycillin-clavulanic acid minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) up to and including 4 mg/l. A total of 344 patients with CAP from 77 centres received amoxycillin-clavulanate 2000/125 mg twice daily for 10 days (169 patients) or amoxycillin-clavulanate 1000/125 mg three times daily for 10 days (175 patients). The most common pathogen isolated was S. pneumoniae (52.3% of patients, amoxycillin-clavulanate 2000/125 mg group; 46.8% of patients, amoxycillin-clavulanate 1000/125 mg group). In the clinical per-protocol (PP) population at test of cure (days 18-39), the clinical success rate in the amoxycillin-clavulanate 2000/125 mg group was at least as good as in the amoxycillin-clavulanate 1000/125 mg group (91.5 and 93.0%, respectively; 95% CI, -8.3, 5.4). The radiological and bacteriological success rates at test of cure for the PP populations were 92.4 and 90.6% in the amoxycillin-clavulanate 2000/125 mg group and 93.9 and 84.4% in the amoxycillin-clavulanate 1000/125 mg group, respectively. The clinical, bacteriological and radiological success rates at the end of therapy (days 11-17) for the PP populations were all over 85%. Both regimens were well tolerated, with no differences in adverse events between the groups. Amoxycillin-clavulanate 2000/125 mg, twice daily, is well tolerated and at least as effective clinically as amoxycillin-clavulanate 1000/125 mg, three times\n\nEffects of Once-Daily Oral and Transdermal Methylphenidate on Sleep Behavior of Children with ADHD\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nFaraone, Stephen V.; Glatt, Stephen J.; Bukstein, Oscar G.; Lopez, Frank A.; Arnold, L. Eugene; Findling, Robert L.\n\n2009-01-01\n\nObjective: Methylphenidate is a leading first-line treatment for ADHD (AD/HD). This stimulant has long been suspected to adversely affect sleeping patterns of treated individuals, especially children. There are few studies on the effects of recently developed longer-acting methylphenidate treatments, such as once-daily oral or transdermalâ¦\n\nOral impacts on daily performances and recent use of dental services in schoolchildren.\n\nPubMed\n\nMonsantofils, Monica; BernabÃ©, Eduardo\n\n2014-11-01\n\nTo explore whether oral impacts on daily performances are related to recent use of dental services among children and whether oral impacts on specific daily performances are more strongly related to recent use of dental services. Data from a cross-sectional survey, including 805 11-12-year-old children attending four randomly selected schools in Lima (Peru), were used. The child version of the oral impacts on daily performances (Child-OIDP) was used to assess prevalence, intensity, and extent of oral impacts. Use of dental services was assessed by self-reports of last dental visit and reason for the visit. Associations of the prevalence, intensity, and extent of oral impacts with use of dental services were tested in logistic regression models. Children with oral impacts were 1.99 (95% CI: 1.17-3.37) times more likely to have used dental services recently than their counterparts. The intensity and extent of oral impacts were linearly associated with children's use of dental services. Difficulties in eating were the only type of oral impacts on daily performances associated with use of dental services, independent of children's demographic characteristics, and impacts on other performances. Oral impacts on daily performances were related to recent use of dental services among these schoolchildren. Â© 2013 BSPD, IAPD and John Wiley & Sons A/S.

METHODS: A cross-sectional study with secondary data from the State Oral Health Survey (SB SÃ£o Paulo 2015) conducted in 163 cities of SÃ£o Paulo. A total of 17,560 individuals from three age groups: 15â19-year-old (n = 5,558), 35â44-year-old (n = 6,051), and older people of 65 years or more (n = 5,951) participated in the survey. The selection was made by probabilistic sample by conglomerates in two stages. The endpoint variable was the impact of oral health on daily activities, evaluated by the Oral Impacts on Daily Performances questionnaire, containing questions about eating, talking, oral hygiene, relaxation, sports practice, smile, study or work, social contact, and sleep. Oral Impacts on Daily Performances was dichotomized with and without impact. The independent variables were sociodemographic, clinical and access variables, divided into three blocks. A hierarchical multiple logistic regression analysis was performed considering the complex sampling plan of clusters. Each observation received a specific weight, depending on the location that resulted in weighted frequencies and adjusted for the design effect. RESULTS: The presence of oral health impact was observed in 27.9% of the individuals. In block 1, female gender and black/brown ethnic group had a greater chance of impact of oral health on quality of life, as well as the adults and the older adults in relation to adolescents. In block 2, family income up to R$1,500 was associated with the presence of impact. In block 3, individuals who reported toothache, used the public service and sought dental treatment had a greater chance of impact. CONCLUSIONS: Sociodemographic, clinical and access to health services variables influence the impact of oral health on the daily activities of adolescents, adults and\n\nTreatment of chronic telogen effluvium with oral minoxidil: A retrospective study.\n\nPubMed\n\nPerera, Eshini; Sinclair, Rodney\n\n2017-01-01\n\nBackground : Chronic telogen effluvium (CTE) may be primary or secondary to various causes, including drug reaction, nutritional deficiency and female pattern hair loss (FPHL).Â Oral minoxidil stimulates hair growth, and topical minoxidil is used in the treatment of FPHL and male androgenetic alopecia. minoxidil has not been used to treat CTE. This study aimed to assess the treatment of CTE with once daily oral minoxidil. Methods : Women with a diagnosis of CTE based on >6 month history of increased telogen hair shedding, no visible mid frontal scalp hair loss (Sinclair stage 1) and no hair follicle miniaturization on scalp biopsy were treated with once daily oral minoxidil.Â Hair shedding scores (HSS) at baseline, 6 and 12 months were analysed using the Wilcoxon rank sum test for pair-wise comparisons. Results : Thirty-six women were treated with oral minoxidil (range, 0.25-2.5 mg) daily for 6 months.Â Mean age was 46.9 years (range 20-83), HSS at baseline was 5.64, and duration of diagnosis was 6.55 years (range 1-27).Â There was a reduction in mean HSS scores from baseline to 6 months of 1.7 (p<0.001) and baseline to 12 months of 2.58 (p<0.001). Five women who described trichodynia at baseline, noted improvement or resolution within 3 months.Â Mean change in blood pressure was minus 0.5 mmHg systolic and plus 2.1 mmHg diastolic.Â Two patients developed transient postural dizziness that resolved with continued treatment.Â One patient developed ankle oedema.Â Thirteen women developed facial hypertrichosis.Â For 6 patients this was mild and did not require treatment; 4 had waxing of their upper lip or forehead; 3 had laser hair removal.Â No patients developed any haematological abnormality.Â All 36 women completed 12 months of treatment. Conclusions : Once daily oral minoxidil appears to reduce hair shedding in CTE.Â Placebo controlled studies are recommended to further assess this response.\n\nCan oral 5-aminosalicylic acid be administered once daily in the treatment of mild-to-moderate ulcerative colitis? A meta-analysis of randomized-controlled trials.\n\nPubMed\n\nZhu, Ying; Tang, Ren-Kuan; Zhao, Peng; Zhu, Shi-sheng; Li, Yong-guo; Li, Jian-bo\n\n2012-05-01\n\nSeveral trials have demonstrated that oral delayed-release mesalamine might be administered once daily. We aimed to conduct a meta-analysis to investigate this. A comprehensive and multiple-source literature search was carried out. Only randomized-controlled trials (RCTs) were investigated by comparing a once daily-dosing regime with a divided (twice or thrice daily)-dosing regime of oral delayed-release mesalamine formulations for induction or maintenance of remission in patients with mild-to-moderate ulcerative colitis. The quality of RCTs was assessed using the Jadad scores. Meta-analysis of pooled odds ratios was carried out using Review Manager 5.1. Nine RCTs were finally included. With regard to meta-analyses for induction trials, there were no significant differences for all comparisons between the once daily and the divided groups, including maintenance of just clinical remission (P=0.52) and just endoscopic remission (P=0.23), maintenance of combined clinical and endoscopic remission (P=0.78), and the overall incidence of adverse events (P=0.61). With regard to meta-analyses for maintenance trials, there were also no significant differences for all comparisons between once daily and divided groups, including maintenance of just clinical remission (P=0.73) and just endoscopic remission (P=0.43), maintenance of combined clinical and endoscopic remission (P=0.43), the overall incidence of adverse events (P=0.12) as well as compliance with the prescribed medication (P=0.34). The present work showed that oral delayed-release mesalazine administered as a single or a divided dose demonstrated a good safety profile, which was well tolerated and effective as either maintenance or induction treatment. High clinical and/or endoscopic remission rates can be achieved with once-daily dosing.\n\nAround-the-clock oral THC effects on sleep in male chronic daily cannabis smokers.\n\nPubMed\n\nGorelick, David A; Goodwin, Robert S; Schwilke, Eugene; Schroeder, Jennifer R; Schwope, David M; Kelly, Deanna L; Ortemann-Renon, Catherine; Bonnet, Denis; Huestis, Marilyn A\n\n2013-01-01\n\nÎ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) promotes sleep in animals; clinical use of THC is associated with somnolence. Human laboratory studies of oral THC have not shown consistent effects on sleep. We prospectively evaluated self-reported sleep parameters during controlled oral THC administration to research volunteers. Thirteen male chronic daily cannabis smokers (meanâÂ±âSD age 24.6Â±â3.7 years, self-reported smoking frequency of 5.5âÂ±â5.9 (range 1-24) joint-equivalents daily at study entry) were administered oral THC doses (20âmg) around-the-clock for 7 days (40-120âmg daily) starting the afternoon after admission. The St. Mary's Hospital Sleep Questionnaire was completed every morning. Plasma THC and 11-OH-THC (active metabolite) concentrations were measured in venous blood samples collected every evening. Changes in sleep characteristics over time and associations between sleep characteristics and plasma cannabinoid concentrations were evaluated with repeated measures mixed linear regression. Higher evening THC and 11-OH-THC concentrations were significantly associated with shorter sleep latency, less difficulty falling asleep, and more daytime sleep the following day. In contrast, the duration of calculated and self-reported nighttime sleep decreased slightly (3.54 and 5.34 minutes per night, respectively) but significantly during the study. These findings suggest that tolerance to the somnolent effects of THC may have occurred, but results should be considered preliminary due to design limitations. Somnolence from oral THC may dissipate with chronic, high-dose use. This has implications for patients who may take chronic oral THC for medicinal purposes, including cannabis dependence treatment.

A number of oral 5-ASA agents is commercially available, including azo-bond pro-drugs such as sulfasalazine, olsalazine and balsalazide, and delayed- and controlled-release forms of mesalazine. In addition, the effectiveness of oral therapy relies on good compliance, which may be adversely affected by frequent daily dosing and a large number of tablets. Furthermore, poor adherence has been shown to be an important barrier to successful management of patients with UC. Recently, new, once-daily formulations of mesalazine including the unique multi-matrix delivery system and mesalazine granules were proven to be efficacious in inducing and maintaining remission in mild-to-moderate UC, with a good safety profile comparable to that of other oral mesalazine formulations. In addition, they offer the advantage of low pill burden and may contribute to increased long-term compliance and treatment success in clinical practice and might potentially further contribute to a decline in the risk for UC-associated colon cancers. In this systematic review, the authors summarize the available literature on the short- and medium-term efficacy and safety of the new once-daily mesalazine formulations.\n\nAnalysis of clinical efficacy, side effects, and laboratory changes among patients with acne vulgaris receiving single versus twice daily dose of oral isotretinoin.\n\nPubMed\n\nAhmad, Hesham M\n\n2015-01-01\n\nAcne vulgaris is a debilitating disorder and requires proper treatment. This work evaluates the clinical efficacy, side effects, and laboratory changes of serum lipids and liver function during oral isotretinoin therapy for acne vulgaris, comparing single versus twice daily dose. Fifty-eight patients with acne vulgaris were included and randomized into group I (26 patients), who received once daily dose, and group II (32 patients), who received twice daily dose of oral isotretinoin. Global acne scoring system was used to evaluate acne severity and post-treatment improvement. Both regimens resulted in highly significant clinical improvement of acne with no significant difference. However, side effects were significantly more common among patients of group I. Both regimens caused mild rise of serum cholesterol, alanine transaminase (ALT), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) with more prominent rise of triglycerides especially with twice daily dose. Oral isotretinoin is a very effective treatment for acne vulgaris with no statistically significant difference in clinical efficacy between once and twice daily doses. However, dividing dose to twice per day might cause fewer incidence of side effects without reducing clinical efficacy. The drug causes mild clinically insignificant rise of serum cholesterol, triglycerides, AST, and ALT.

In daily practice, the World Health Organization definition \"white patch or plaque that cannot be characterized clinically or histologically as any other disease\" is completed by including the observation that it cannot be removed by simple scraping, thereby distinguishing it from pseudo-membranous candidiasis. The aim of this study is to find a definitive treatment of oral leukoplakia, because of its recurrence and its potentiality to the malignant transformation. There are currently different approaches to oral leukoplakia: scalpel surgery, systemic therapy (carotenoids, vitamins, etc.), electro-cauterization, cryotherapy and the use of the laser. In every lesion, biopsy and histological analysis has been performed to identify the stage and classification of the oral leukoplakia. Laser can be used for the complete excision of the lesion (which is more effective, but also more invasive), for the photodynamic therapy (non-invasive procedure, which requires several applications) or for the vaporization of the lesion (very precise treatment and relatively easy to perform). Laser treatments have shown better healing, less soft tissues retraction and less post-operative pain, comparing with traditional surgery. The use of systemic therapies and smoking habit interruption (where present) has been also useful to reduce the lesions before the clinical treatments. The treatment has always to be supported by histological analysis to identify the risk and consequently planning the clinical approach.\n\nPharmacokinetic Comparison of Once-Daily Topical Minocycline Foam 4% vs Oral Minocycline for Moderate-to-Severe Acne.\n\nPubMed\n\nJones, Terry M; Ellman, Herman; deVries, Tina\n\n2017-10-01\n\nTo characterize minocycline pharmacokinetics and relative bioavailability following multiple-dose topical administration of minocycline hydrochloride (HCl) foam 4% (FMX101 4%) as compared with single-dose oral administration of minocycline HCl extended-release tablets (SolodynÂ®) in subjects with moderate-to-severe acne. A Phase 1, single-center, nonrandomized, open-label, active-controlled, 2-period, 2-treatment crossover clinical study. The study included 30 healthy adults (mean age, 22.6 years; 90% white, and 60% females) who had moderate-to-severe acne. Subjects were assigned to first receive a single oral dose of a minocycline HCl extended-release tablet (approximately 1 mg/kg). At 10 days after the oral minocycline dose, topical minocycline foam 4% was applied, once daily for 21 days. Serial blood samples were obtained before and after administration of oral minocycline and each topical application of minocycline foam 4% on days 1, 12, and 21. Following oral administration of minocycline (approximately 1 mg/kg), plasma minocycline concentration increased until 3 hours, followed by a log-linear decrease over the remainder of the 96-hour sampling period. Following topical application of a 4-g maximal-use dose of minocycline foam 4% for 21 days, plasma minocycline concentration was very low, with geometric mean Cmax values ranging from 1.1 ng/mL to 1.5 ng/mL. Steady state was achieved by day 6. Overall, minocycline exposure with topical minocycline foam 4% was 730 to 765 times lower than that with oral minocycline. There was no evidence of minocycline accumulation over the 21 days of topical application of minocycline foam 4%. Topical minocycline foam 4% appeared to be safe and well tolerated, with no serious treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), treatment-related TEAEs, or TEAEs that led to treatment discontinuation. Once-daily topical application of minocycline foam 4% did not lead to significant systemic exposure to minocycline. It appears to be a well\n\nTeriflunomide: a once-daily oral medication for the treatment of relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis.\n\nPubMed\n\nMiller, Aaron E\n\n2015-10-01\n\nThe purpose was to summarize US prescribing information for teriflunomide in the treatment of patients with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (RMS), with reference to clinical efficacy and safety outcomes. In September 2012, the US Food and Drug Administration granted approval for the use of teriflunomide, 14 mg and 7 mg once daily, to treat RMS on the basis of the results of a Phase II study and the Phase III TEMSO (Teriflunomide Multiple Sclerosis Oral) trial. After recent updates to the prescribing information (October 2014), key findings from these and 2 other Phase III clinical trials, TOWER (Teriflunomide Oral in People With Relapsing Multiple Sclerosis) and TOPIC (Oral Teriflunomide for Patients with a First Clinical Episode Suggestive of Multiple Sclerosis), and practical considerations for physicians are summarized. Teriflunomide, 14 mg and 7 mg, significantly reduced mean number of unique active lesions on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI; P < 0.05 for both doses) in the Phase II study. In the TEMSO and TOWER studies, the 14-mg dose of teriflunomide significantly reduced annualized relapse rate (31% and 36% relative risk reduction compared with placebo, respectively; both P < 0.001) and risk of disability progression sustained for 12 weeks (hazard ratio vs placebo 0.70 and 0.69, respectively; both P < 0.05). The 7-mg dose significantly (PÂ <Â 0.02) reduced annualized relapse rate in both studies, although the reduction in risk of disability progression was not statistically significant. Teriflunomide treatment was also associated with significant efficacy on MRI measures of disease activity in TEMSO; both doses significantly reduced total lesion volume and number of gadolinium-enhancing T1 lesions. TOPIC evaluated patients with a first clinical event consistent with acute demyelination and brain MRI lesions characteristic of multiple sclerosis. More patients were free of relapse in the teriflunomide 14-mg and 7-mg groups than in the placebo group (P\n\nOnce daily 5-aminosalicylic acid for the treatment of ulcerative colitis; are we there yet?\n\nPubMed\n\nLakatos, Peter Laszlo; Lakatos, Laszlo\n\n2008-01-01\n\n5-Aminosalicylate (5-ASA) agents remain the mainstay treatment in ulcerative colitis (UC). A number of oral 5-ASA agents are commercially available, including azo-bond pro-drugs such as sulfasalazine, olsalazine and balsalazide, and delayed- and controlled-release forms of mesalazine. In addition, the effectiveness of oral therapy relies on good compliance, which may be adversely affected by frequent daily dosing and a large number of tablets. Furthermore, poor adherence has been shown to be an important barrier to successful management of patients with UC. Recently, new, once daily formulations of mesalazine including the unique multi-matrix delivery system and mesalazine granules were proven to be efficacious in inducing and maintaining remission in mild-to-moderate UC, with a good safety profile comparable to that of other oral mesalazine formulations. In addition, they offer the advantage of low pill burden and may contribute to increased long-term compliance and treatment success in clinical practice and might potentially further contribute to a decline in the risk for UC-associated colon cancers. In this systematic review, the authors summarize the available literature on the short- and medium-term efficacy and safety of the new once daily mesalazine formulations.\n\nMulticenter, randomized, open-label Phase II study comparing S-1 alternate-day oral therapy with the standard daily regimen as a first-line treatment in patients with unresectable advanced pancreatic cancer.\n\nPubMed\n\nYamaue, Hiroki; Shimizu, Atsushi; Hagiwara, Yasuhiro; Sho, Masayuki; Yanagimoto, Hiroaki; Nakamori, Shoji; Ueno, Hideki; Ishii, Hiroshi; Kitano, Masayuki; Sugimori, Kazuya; Maguchi, Hiroyuki; Ohkawa, Shinichi; Imaoka, Hiroshi; Hashimoto, Daisuke; Ueda, Kazuki; Nebiki, Hiroko; Nagakawa, Tatsuya; Isayama, Hiroyuki; Yokota, Isao; Ohashi, Yasuo; Shirasaka, Tetsuhiko\n\n2017-04-01\n\nNon-inferiority for overall survival (OS) following alternate-day treatment with the oral anticancer drug S-1 compared with standard daily treatment was assessed in Japanese patients with unresectable advanced pancreatic cancer in a multicenter, randomized, phase II study. This trial was registered at the UMIN Clinical Trials Registry (no. 000008604). Chemotherapy-naÃ¯ve patients with locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer were randomly assigned 2:1 to treatment with alternate-day (twice daily on alternate days from days 1 through 42 of a 42-day cycle) or daily (twice daily on days 1 through 28 of a 42-day cycle) treatment with S-1. The primary endpoint was OS. Secondary endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS), time to treatment failure, response rate, quality of life assessments, and safety. A total of 190 patients were enrolled, of which 185 were included in the final analysis (alternate-day: 121; daily: 64). Median OS was 9.4 for the alternate-day group and 10.4 months for the daily group [hazard ratio (HR), 1.19; 95% credible interval, 0.86 to 1.64], indicating that non-inferiority of alternate-day treatment to daily treatment was not demonstrated. Median PFS was 3.0 for the alternate-day group and 4.2 months for the daily group (HR, 1.65; 95% credible interval, 1.20-2.29). The incidence of anorexia, fatigue, neutrophils, pigmentation, and pneumonitis was lower in alternate-day treatment compared with daily treatment. S-1 for advanced pancreatic cancer should be taken daily as recommended, based on the decreased OS and PFS and marginal improvement in safety observed in the alternate-day group.\n\nTreatment of oral mucosal manifestations of chronic graft-versus-host disease: dexamethasone vs. budesonide.\n\nPubMed\n\nZadik, Yehuda; Elad, Sharon; Shapira, Anat; Shapira, Michael Y\n\n2017-02-01\n\nThe oral mucosa is commonly involved in chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD). Oral mucosal cGVHD markedly affect individual's daily function and wellbeing. In some cases, it might become a life threating complication. Areas covered: This article describes the rationale for treatment, method of topical application in the oral cavity, evidence supporting the topical administration of dexamethasone and budesonide for oral cGVHD, and their adverse effects. Expert opinion: Evidence supports the use of topical dexamethasone and budesonide for treatment of oral cGVHD. Topical corticosteroid choice for oral cGVHD, takes into consideration the potency, bioavailability, preferred concentration, and possible adverse effects. Budesonide's pharmacological characteristics mark it as a preferable topical agent for oral cGVHD.\n\nHormonal Treatment of Transgender Women with Oral Estradiol.\n\nPubMed\n\nLeinung, Matthew C; Feustel, Paul J; Joseph, Jalaja\n\n2018-01-01\n\nPurpose: Maintaining cross-sex hormone levels in the normal physiologic range for the desired gender is the cornerstone of transgender hormonal therapy, but there are limited data on how to achieve this. We investigated the effectiveness of oral estradiol therapy in achieving this goal. Methods: We analyzed data on all transgender females seen in our clinic since 2008 treated with oral estradiol. We looked at the success of achieving serum levels of testosterone and 17-Î² estradiol in the normal range on various doses of estradiol (with and without antiandrogens spironolactone and finasteride). Results: There was a positive correlation between estradiol dose and 17-Î² estradiol, but testosterone suppression was less well correlated. Over 70% achieved treatment goals (adequate 17-Î² estradiol levels and testosterone suppression) on 4âmg daily or more. Nearly a third of patients did not achieve adequate treatment goals on 6 or even 8âmg daily of estradiol. Spironolactone, but not finasteride, use was associated with impairment of obtaining desired 17-Î² estradiol levels. Spironolactone did not enhance testosterone suppression, and finasteride was associated with higher testosterone levels. Conclusions: Oral estradiol was effective in achieving desired serum levels of 17-Î² estradiol, but there was wide individual variability in the amount required. Oral estradiol alone was not infrequently unable to achieve adequate testosterone suppression. Spironolactone did not aid testosterone suppression and seemed to impair achievement of goal serum 17-Î² estradiol levels. Testosterone levels were higher with finasteride use. We recommend that transgender women receiving estradiol therapy have hormone levels monitored so that therapy can be individualized.\n\nLong-term experience with deferasirox (ICL670), a once-daily oral iron chelator, in the treatment of transfusional iron overload.\n\nPubMed\n\nCappellini, M D; Taher, A\n\n2008-09-01\n\nChronic iron overload from frequent blood transfusions to treat patients with severe anaemias leads to significant morbidity and mortality. While deferoxamine, the current standard of care, is an effective iron chelator, it requires subcutaneous infusion for 8-12 h/day, 5-7 days/week. This regimen is problematic and impacts significantly on patients' daily life. To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of deferasirox, a once-daily oral iron chelator. To review the available data reported in peer-reviewed journals (using PubMed) and at medical conferences. Deferasirox is effective in reducing or maintaining iron burden in patients with transfusion-dependent anaemias. As deferasirox is orally administered, the inconvenience of parenteral administration with deferasirox is avoided. Deferasirox improves patient satisfaction and is expected to improve compliance with iron chelation therapy.\n\nPenetration of levofloxacin into skin tissue after oral administration of multiple 750 mg once-daily doses.\n\nPubMed\n\nChow, A T; Chen, A; Lattime, H; Morgan, N; Wong, F; Fowler, C; Williams, R R\n\n2002-04-01\n\nTo probe the pharmacokinetic basis for the use of levofloxacin for complicated skin and skin-structure infections (SSSIs) at a once-daily dosage of 750 mg by investigating its penetration into skin tissue. Ten healthy volunteers were administered three oral, once-daily 750 mg doses of levofloxacin, and levofloxacin concentrations were subsequently measured over time (0.5-24 h) in skin-punch biopsy tissue and plasma. Skin tissue concentrations consistently exceeded those in plasma at every time point, with tissue/plasma ratios of 1.37 +/- 0.81 for peak concentration and 1.97 +/- 0.35 for area under the concentration versus time curve. Three of the ten subjects reported treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) that were considered unrelated to treatment. An 11th subject who had enrolled in the study withdrew after AEs of mild severity that were possibly related to the study drug. The results support the clinical usage of levofloxacin 750 mg once-daily for complicated SSSIs.\n\nDaily oral iron supplementation during pregnancy\n\nPubMed Central\n\nPeÃ±a-Rosas, Juan Pablo; De-Regil, Luz Maria; Dowswell, Therese; Viteri, Fernando E\n\n2014-01-01\n\nBackground Iron and folic acid supplementation has been the preferred intervention to improve iron stores and prevent anaemia among pregnant women, and it may also improve other maternal and birth outcomes. Objectives To assess the effects of daily oral iron supplements for pregnant women, either alone or in conjunction with folic acid, or with other vitamins and minerals as a public health intervention. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Groupâs Trials Register (2 July 2012). We also searched the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (2 July 2012) and contacted relevant organisations for the identification of ongoing and unpublished studies. Selection criteria Randomised or quasi-randomised trials evaluating the effects of oral preventive supplementation with daily iron, iron + folic acid or iron + other vitamins and minerals during pregnancy. Data collection and analysis We assessed the methodological quality of trials using standard Cochrane criteria. Two review authors independently assessed trial eligibility, extracted data and conducted checks for accuracy. Main results We included 60 trials. Forty-three trials, involving more than 27,402 women, contributed data and compared the effects of daily oral supplements containing iron versus no iron or placebo. Overall, women taking iron supplements were less likely to have low birthweight newborns (below 2500 g) compared with controls (8.4% versus 10.2%, average risk ratio (RR) 0.81; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.68 to 0.97, 11 trials, 8480 women) and mean birthweight was 30.81 g greater for those infants whose mothers received iron during pregnancy (average mean difference (MD) 30.81; 95% CI 5.94 to 55.68, 14 trials, 9385 women). Preventive iron supplementation reduced the risk of maternal anaemia at term by 70% (RR 0.30; 95% CI 0.19 to 0.46, 14 trials, 2199 women) and iron deficiency at term by 57% (RR 0.43; 95% CI 0.27 to 0.66, seven trials, 1256 women\n\nAssessing the validity and reliability of the Malagasy version of Oral Impacts on Daily Performance (OIDP): a cross-sectional study.\n\nPubMed\n\nRazanamihaja, Noeline; Ranivoharilanto, Eva\n\n2017-01-01\n\nEvaluating health needs includes measures of the impact of state of health on the quality of life. This entails evaluating the psychosocial aspects of health. To achieve this, several tools for measuring the quality of life related to oral health have been developed. However, it is vital to evaluate the psychometric properties of these tools so they can be used in a new context and on a new population. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the reliability and validity of the Malagasy version of a questionnaire for studying the impacts of oral-dental health on daily activities (Oral Impacts on Daily Performance), and analyse the interrelations between the scores obtained and the oral health indicators. A cross-sectional study was performed for the transcultural adaptation of the Oral Impacts on Daily Performance questionnaire forward translated and back-translated from English to Malagasy and from Malagasy to English, respectively. The psychometric characteristics of the Malagasy version of the Oral Impacts on Daily Performance were then evaluated in terms of internal reliability, test-retest, and construct, criteria and discriminant validity. Four hundred and six adults responded in face-to-face interviews to the Malagasy version of the Oral Impacts on Daily Performance questionnaire. Nearly 74% of the participants indicated impacts of their oral health on their performance in their daily lives during the 6 months prior to the survey. The activities most affected were: \"smiling\", \"eating\" and \"sleeping and relaxing\". Cronbach's alpha was 0.87. The construct validity was demonstrated by a significant association between the Oral Impacts on Daily Performance scores and the subjective evaluation of oral health ( p <0.001). Discriminant validity was demonstrated by the fact that the Oral Impacts on Daily Performance scores were significantly higher in subjects with more than ten missing teeth, compared to those with fewer than ten missing teeth ( p â<â0\n\nA randomized controlled trial to compare the safety and effectiveness of doxycycline (200 mg daily) with oral prednisolone (0.5 mg kg(-1) daily) for initial treatment of bullous pemphigoid: a protocol for the Bullous Pemphigoid Steroids and Tetracyclines (BLISTER) Trial.\n\nPubMed\n\nChalmers, J R; Wojnarowska, F; Kirtschig, G; Nunn, A J; Bratton, D J; Mason, J; Foster, K A; Whitham, D; Williams, H C\n\n2015-07-01\n\nBullous pemphigoid (BP) is the most common autoimmune blistering disease in older people, and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Oral corticosteroids are usually effective but the side-effects are thought to contribute to the high morbidity and mortality rate. Treatment with oral tetracyclines may be effective but high-quality, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are needed to confirm this. To compare the effectiveness and safety of two strategies for treating BP. This is a two-arm, parallel group, 52-week RCT comparing doxycycline with prednisolone for initial treatment of BP. Dose is fixed for the initial 6 weeks of treatment (doxycycline 200 mg daily; prednisolone 0.5 mg kg(-1) daily), after which it can be adjusted according to need. A total of 256 patients with BP will be recruited in the U.K. and Germany. The primary outcomes are: (i) effectiveness (assessor-blinded blister count at 6 weeks) and (ii) safety [proportion of patients experiencing â¥ grade 3 adverse events (i.e. severe, life: threatening or fatal) related to trial medication during the year of follow-up]. Primary effectiveness analysis will be an assessment of whether doxycycline can be considered noninferior to prednisolone after 6 weeks of treatment. Primary safety analysis is a superiority analysis at 12 months. Secondary outcomes include longer-term assessment of effectiveness, relapse rates, the proportion of patients experiencing any grade of adverse events related to treatment, quality of life and cost-effectiveness. The trial will provide good evidence for whether the strategy of starting BP treatment with doxycycline is a useful alternative to prednisolone.

One hundred and ten patients with rosacea were screened. Thirty-eight patients having rosacea associated eyelid and ocular surface changes and dry eye complaints were included in the study. Patients were randomly divided into two groups: nineteen patients were given topical cyclosporine twice daily and nineteen patients were given oral doxycycline 100 mg twice daily for the first month and once daily for the following two months. Symptom and sign scores, ocular surface disease index questionnarie and tear function tests were evaluated at baseline and monthly for 3mo. Three months after results were compared with that of baseline. Mean values of symptom, eyelid sign and corneal/conjunctival sign scores of each treatment group at baseline and 3mo after treatments were compared and both drugs were found to be effective on rosacea associated ocular changes (P<0.001). Cyclosporine was more effective in symptomatic relief and in the treatment of eyelid signs (P=0.01). There was statistically significant increase in the mean Schirmer score with anesthesia and tear break up time scores in the cyclosporine treatment group compared to the doxycycline treatment group (P<0.05). Cyclosporine as a topical drug can be used in the treatment of rosacea associated ocular complications because it is more effective than doxycycline. In addition ocular rosacea as a chronic disease requires long term treatment and doxycycline has various side effects limiting its long term usage.\n\nThe impact of oral health on daily performances and its association with clinical variables in a population in Zambia.\n\nPubMed\n\nAndersson, P; Kavakure, J; LingstrÃ¶m, P\n\n2017-05-01\n\nThe aim of this study was to investigate oral impacts on daily performance and to relate these data to oral clinical variables. The study was performed at a dental clinic in Livingstone, Zambia, and included 78 subjects (mean age 28, range 15-48Â years) consecutively recruited in connection with a dental care visit. Data were collected through a structured interview using the Oral Impacts on Daily Performances (OIDP) index measuring oral health-related quality of life followed by a clinical examination. Oral health affected one or more daily performances during the last 6Â months for 61.5% of the subjects. 'Difficulty of eating and enjoying food' was the performance reported most frequently (42.3%), and 'speaking and pronouncing clearly' was least often reported (10.3%). DMFT was 3.8, Â±3.6 (meanÂ Â±Â SD; range 0-15). A majority of the individuals had periodontal pockets â¥4Â mm (mean 4.3, Â±2.6) (94.9%) and gingival bleeding on probing >20% (88.5%). Two or more decayed teeth were shown to be significantly associated (OR 4.6, CI 1.2-17.1) with one or more oral impacts on daily performances in a multivariate logistic regression analysis. This study shown that there is a significant association between decayed teeth and oral impacts on daily performances. More research is needed, however, for deeper understanding of oral health problems and their impacts on daily life in Zambia. Â© 2015 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

The aim of the study was, based on a systematic review, to draft a guide directed at the team of health professionals involved in the oral care of oncological patients. A systematic search of the literature was performed for articles published between 2000 and April 2017. Searches were made of electronic databases and hand search. The inclusion criteria were systematic reviews of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and RCTs published in English, involving pediatric and adult oncological patients and focused on the prevention and treatment of oral complications as well as studies addressing the maintenance of oral health. Among the 1237 studies identified, 129 were pre-selected and 54 were selected to form the basis for the clinical guide. The studies analyzed stress the need for oral assessments as well as preventive and curative actions prior to oncological treatment. To minimize the severity of oral problems, the studies emphasize daily oral care, the treatment of xerostomia with saliva substitute and hydration, and low-level laser therapy, nystatin, acyclovir, respectively, for the prevention and treatment of oral mucositis, oral candidiasis, and infection by herpes simplex virus. Thus, the guide produced addresses oral assessments and professional and home care before, during, and after oncological treatment. The guide drafted has the function of assisting health professionals involved in the oral care of patients with cancer, enabling the prevention or treatment of oral complications stemming from oncological treatment.\n\n[The impact of oral health on daily performance of municipal waste disposal workers in Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul State, Brazil].\n\nPubMed\n\nGomes, AndrÃ©a Silveira; Abegg, Claides\n\n2007-07-01\n\nThis study aimed to investigate the prevalence of oral health impact on daily performance in Brazilian adults. 276 civil servants 35 to 44 years of age from the Public Works and Waste Disposal Department of Porto Alegre, in southern Brazil, were interviewed and clinically examined. Oral Impacts on Daily Performance (OIDP) was used to evaluate the impact of oral health status on daily performance. 73.6% of all subjects had at least one daily performance affected by an oral impact in the previous six months. The most commonly affected performance was eating (48.6%), while the most common symptoms were discomfort (40.6%) and dissatisfaction with one's appearance (31.5%). Missing teeth (21.7%) and toothache (20.7%) were recognized as the main causes of oral impacts on daily performance. OIDP was useful for measuring (physically, psychologically, and socially) the oral impacts on daily performance.\n\nTreatment of female pattern hair loss with oral antiandrogens.\n\nPubMed\n\nSinclair, R; Wewerinke, M; Jolley, D\n\n2005-03-01\n\nIt has not been conclusively established that female pattern hair loss (FPHL) is either due to androgens or responsive to oral antiandrogen therapy. To evaluate the efficacy of oral antiandrogen therapy in the management of women with FPHL using standardized photographic techniques (Canfield Scientific), and to identify clinical and histological parameters predictive of clinical response. For this single-centre, before-after, open intervention study, 80 women aged between 12 and 79 years, with FPHL and biopsy-confirmed hair follicle miniaturization [terminal/vellus (T/V) hair ratio < or = 4 : 1] were photographed at baseline and again after receiving a minimum of 12 months of oral antiandrogen therapy. Forty women received spironolactone 200 mg daily and 40 women received cyproterone acetate, either 50 mg daily or 100 mg for 10 days per month if premenopausal. Women using topical minoxidil were excluded. Standardized photographs of the midfrontal and vertex scalp were taken with the head positioned in a stereotactic device. Images were evaluated by a panel of three clinicians experienced in the assessment of FPHL, blinded to patient details and treatment and using a three-point scale. As there was no significant difference in the results or the trend between spironolactone and cyproterone acetate the results were combined. Thirty-five (44%) women had hair regrowth, 35 (44%) had no clear change in hair density before and after treatment, and 10 (12%) experienced continuing hair loss during the treatment period. Ordinal logistic regression analysis to identify predictors of response revealed no influence of patient age, menopause status, serum ferritin, serum hormone levels, clinical stage (Ludwig) or histological parameters such as T/V ratio or fibrosis. The only significant predictor was midscalp clinical grade, with higher-scale values associated with a greater response (P = 0.013). Eighty-eight percent of women receiving oral antiandrogens could expect to see no\n\nDoes oral health matter in people's daily life? Oral health-related quality of life in adults 35-47 years of age in Norway.\n\nPubMed\n\nDahl, K E; Wang, N J; Ohrn, K\n\n2012-02-01\n\nThe aim of this study was to assess the effect of oral health on aspects of daily life measured by the Dental Impact Profile (DIP) in 35- to 47-year-old individuals in Norway, and to study associations between reported effects and demographic variables, subjectively assessed oral health, general health, oral health behaviour and clinical oral health. A stratified randomized sample of 249 individuals received a questionnaire regarding demographic questions, dental visits, oral hygiene behaviour, self-rated oral health and general health and satisfaction with oral health. The DIP measured the effects of oral health on daily life. Teeth present and caries experience were registered by clinical examination. Bi- and multivariate analyses and factor analysis were used. Items most frequently reported to be positively or negatively influenced by oral health were chewing and biting, eating, smiling and laughing, feeling comfortable and appearance. Only 1% reported no effects of oral health. Individuals with fewer than two decayed teeth, individuals who rated their oral health as good or practised good oral health habits reported more positive effects than others on oral quality of life (P â¤ 0.05). When the variables were included in multivariate analysis, none was statistically significant. The subscales of the DIP were somewhat different from the originally suggested subscales. This study showed that most adults reported oral health to be important for masticatory functions and confirmed that oral health also had impacts on other aspects of life.

However, it is not known if these drugs effectively increase intragastric pH in cats. To examine the effects of PO administered ranitidine and omeprazole on intragastric pH in cats and to compare the efficacy of once-daily versus twice-daily dosage regimens for omeprazole. Eight domestic shorthair cats. Using a randomized 4-way cross-over design, cats were given enteric-coated omeprazole granules (1.1-1.3 mg/kg q24h and q12h), ranitidine (1.5-2.3 mg/kg q12h), and placebo. Intragastric pH was monitored continuously for 96 hours using the Bravo(â¢) system, starting on day 4 of treatment, followed by a median washout period of 12 days. Mean percentage of time pH was â¥3 and â¥4 was compared among groups using repeated measures ANOVA. Mean Â± SD percentage of time intragastric pH was â¥3 and â¥4 was 67.0 Â± 24.0% and 54.6 Â± 26.4% for twice-daily omeprazole, 24.4 Â± 22.8% and 16.8 Â± 19.3% for once-daily omeprazole, 16.5 Â± 9.0% and 9.6 Â± 5.9% for ranitidine, and 9.4 Â± 8.0% and 7.0 Â± 6.6% for placebo administration. Twice-daily omeprazole treatment significantly increased intragastric pH, whereas pH after once-daily omeprazole and ranitidine treatments did not differ from that of placebo-treated cats. Only twice-daily PO administered omeprazole significantly suppressed gastric acidity in healthy cats, whereas once-daily omeprazole and standard dosages of ranitidine were not effective acid suppressants in cats.

Methods: After systematically analyzing the requirements for treatment delivery verification and understanding the available information from a novel MR-IGRT treatment machine, we designed a method to use 1) treatment plan files, 2) delivery log files, and 3) dosimetric calibration information to verify the accuracy and completeness of daily treatment deliveries. The method verifies the correctness of delivered treatment plans and beams, beammoreÂ Â» segments, and for each segment, the beam-on time and MLC leaf positions. Composite primary fluence maps are calculated from the MLC leaf positions and the beam-on time. Error statistics are calculated on the fluence difference maps between the plan and the delivery. We also designed the daily treatment delivery report by including all required information for MR-IGRT and physics weekly review - the plan and treatment fraction information, dose verification information, daily patient setup screen captures, and the treatment delivery verification results. Results: The parameters in the log files (e.g. MLC positions) were independently verified and deemed accurate and trustable. A computer program was developed to implement the automatic delivery verification and daily report generation. The program was tested and clinically commissioned with sufficient IMRT and 3D treatment delivery data. The final version has been integrated into a commercial MR-IGRT treatment delivery system. Conclusion: A method was developed to automatically verify MR-IGRT treatment deliveries and generate daily treatment reports. Already in clinical use since December 2013, the system is able to facilitate delivery error detection, and expedite physician daily IGRT review and physicist weekly\n\nOral Vitamin B12 Replacement for the Treatment of Pernicious Anemia\n\nPubMed Central\n\nChan, Catherine Qiu Hua; Low, Lian Leng; Lee, Kheng Hock\n\n2016-01-01\n\nMany patients with pernicious anemia are treated with lifelong intramuscular (IM) vitamin B12 replacement. As early as the 1950s, there were studies suggesting that oral vitamin B12 replacement may provide adequate absorption. Nevertheless, oral vitamin B12 replacement in patients with pernicious anemia remains uncommon in clinical practice. The objective of this review is to provide an update on the effectiveness of oral vitamin B12 for the treatment of pernicious anemia, the recommended dosage, and the required frequency of laboratory test and clinical monitoring. Relevant articles were identified by PubMed search from January 1, 1980 to March 31, 2016 and through hand search of relevant reference articles. Two randomized controlled trials, three prospective papers, one systematic review, and three clinical reviews fulfilled our inclusion criteria. We found that oral vitamin B12 replacement at 1000âÎ¼g daily was adequate to replace vitamin B12 levels in patients with pernicious anemia. We conclude that oral vitamin B12 is an effective alternative to vitamin B12 IM injections. Patients should be offered this alternative after an informed discussion on the advantages and disadvantages of both treatment options.

The Child-OIDP index was translated from English into Malay. The Malay version was tested for reliability and validity on a non-random sample of 132, 11-12 year old schoolchildren from two urban schools in Kuala Lumpur. Psychometric analysis of the Malay Child-OIDP involved face, content, criterion and construct validity tests as well as internal and test-retest reliability. Non-parametric statistical methods were used to assess relationships between Child-OIDP scores and other subjective outcome measures. The standardised Cronbach's alpha was 0.80 and the weighted Kappa was 0.84 (intraclass correlation = 0.79). The index showed significant associations with different subjective measures viz. perceived satisfaction with mouth, perceived needs for dental treatment, perceived oral health status and toothache experience in the previous 3 months (p < 0.05). Two-thirds (66.7%) of the sample had oral impacts affecting one or more performances in the past 3 months. The three most frequently affected performances were cleaning teeth (36.4%), eating foods (34.8%) and maintaining emotional stability (26.5%). In terms of severity of impact, the ability to relax was most severely affected by their oral conditions, followed by ability to socialise and doing schoolwork. Almost three-quarters (74.2%) of schoolchildren with oral impacts had up to three performances affected by their oral conditions. This study indicated that the Malay Child-OIDP index is a valid and reliable instrument to measure the oral impacts of daily performances in 11-12 year old urban schoolchildren in Malaysia.\n\nTopical cetirizine and oral vitamin D: a valid treatment for hypotrichosis caused by ectodermal dysplasia.\n\nPubMed\n\nRossi, A; Miraglia, E; Fortuna, M C; Calvieri, S; Giustini, S\n\n2017-02-01\n\nEctodermal dysplasia is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of inherited disorders characterized by abnormal development of two or more of the following ectodermal-derived structures: hair, teeth, nails and sweat glands. The hair is the most frequently affected structure. Hair shaft abnormalities are of great concern to these patients, but no effective treatments are available. We describe three girls with congenital hypotrichosis (9, 5 and 6 years old) caused by ectodermal dysplasia treated with topical cetirizine solution (2 mL. once daily) and oral vitamin D supplementation (1000 IU daily). After 6 months of treatment, the density of hair on the scalp increased in all patients. The vellus hair was replaced by terminal hair. Hair regrowth was evaluated both from the clinical and trichoscopic point of view. We propose a combination of topical cetirizine and oral vitamin D as a rational treatment of choice in congenital hypotrichosis caused by ectodermal dysplasia.

The authors report the case of a male infant who developed maculae and maculopapulae on his legs and abdomen when aged 3.5 months, which spread to all body surfaces within weeks. Diagnosis of DCM was made at the age of 6 months when he had developed extensive bullous eruptions, generalised pruritus, flushing and abdominal pain. Treatment was started with oral dimethindine maleate. At the age of 18 months, oral sodium cromoglicate (SCG) was introduced. At the age of 23 months, additional treatment was started with a cutaneous emulsion containing 4% SCG. Continued treatment with oral dimethindine maleate, oral SCG with the dose maintained at 25 mg/kg/day, and SCG 4% cutaneous emulsion applied two to four times daily has resulted in a steady improvement of symptoms and skin appearance.

The most common indication for an antibiotic group therapy was diarrhoea, and the most frequently used antibiotic was Colistin. On average, 27.33 daily doses in the control farms and 387.21 daily doses in the problem farms per 1000 weaners were administered on a given day. The significant risk factors in the multivariate model were poor hygiene in the water supply of suckling piglets, less than two doses ofprestarter feed daily, lack of an all-in-and-all-out production system in weaners, no herd book performance data analysis, and less than two of the legally prescribed veterinary visits per year. Furthermore, the treatment incidence of weaners for oral antibiotics was calculated on the basis of the drug inventory. This study provides evidence that the use of oral antibiotics in weaners can be reduced by interventions in hygiene and management.\n\nImpact of dental neglect score on oral health among patients receiving fixed orthodontic treatment: A cross-sectional study.\n\nPubMed\n\nPandey, Vijayendra; Chandra, Subhash; Dilip Kumar, H P; Gupta, Ashish; Bhandari, Poonam Preet; Rathod, Pankaj\n\n2016-01-01\n\nMaintenance of meticulous oral health practices is critical for patients who are under orthodontic treatment as failure to do so can result in deterioration of periodontal health. Thus, the present study was commenced to assess dental negligence and oral health status among patients undergoing orthodontic treatment using dental neglect scale (DNS) questionnaire. The present cross-sectional study was planned and carried out among the 40 patients undergoing fixed orthodontic treatment. The study comprised of two questionnaires, one was close-ended questionnaire which consisted of questions regarding patient practice in maintenance of oral health and other questionnaire comprised of DNS followed by examination of oral hygiene status using Oral Hygiene Index Simplified. Data so obtained were subjected to analysis using SPSS version 20 and Chi-square test was used to statistically analyze data with P < 0.05 regarded as a statistically significant value. The present study revealed that 63% among the studied orthodontic patients brushed once daily, 26% brushed twice daily, and 11% brushed thrice. About one-fourth was using brush with soft bristles and only 9% among the respondents used interdental aids. Data revealed positive correlation between DNS and oral hygiene index-simplified score with P < 0.05. The present study found that less frequency of brushing, rinsing mouth, and eating sticky and hard food can be attributed to self-neglect of the orthodontic patients.\n\nAwareness of orthodontists regarding oral hygiene performance during active orthodontic treatment.\n\nPubMed\n\nBerlin-Broner, Y; Levin, L; Ashkenazi, M\n\n2012-09-01\n\nThe aim of the present study was orthodontist's awareness for maintenance of several home and professional prevention measures during active orthodontic treatment according to patients' report. A structured questionnaire was distributed to 122 patients undergoing active orthodontic treatment with fixed appliances. Patients were treated by 38 different orthodontists. The questionnaire accessed information regarding instructions patients received from their orthodontist concerning maintenance of their oral hygiene during orthodontic treatment. Most of the patients (94%) reported that their orthodontists informed them at least once about the importance of tooth-brushing, and 74.5% received instructions for correct performance of tooth brushing or alternatively were referred to dental hygienist. However, only 24.5% of the patients reported that their orthodontist instructed them to use the correct fluoride concentration in their toothpaste, to use daily fluoride mouthwash (31.5%) and to brush their teeth once a week with high concentration of fluoride gel (Elmex gel; 10.2%). Only 13.8% received application of high concentration of fluoride gel or varnish at the dental office, and 52% of the patients reported that their orthodontist verified that they attend regular check-ups by their dentist. A significant positive correlation was found between explaining the patients the importance of tooth brushing and the following variables: instructing them on how to brush their teeth correctly (p<0.0001), explaining them which type of toothbrush is recommended for orthodontic patients (p=0.002), recommending to perform daily fluoride oral rinse (p=0.036) and referring them to periodic check-ups (p=0.024). Orthodontists should increase their awareness and commitment for instructing their patient on how to maintain good oral hygiene in order to prevent caries and periodontal disease during orthodontic treatment.\n\nCost-effectiveness analysis of exenatide twice daily (BID) vs insulin glargine once daily (QD) as add-on therapy in Chinese patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus inadequately controlled by oral therapies.\n\nPubMed\n\nDeng, Jing; Gu, Shuyan; Shao, Hui; Dong, Hengjin; Zou, Dajin; Shi, Lizheng\n\n2015-01-01\n\nTo estimate cost-effectiveness of exenatide twice daily (BID) vs insulin glargine once daily (QD) as add-on therapy in Chinese type 2 diabetes patients not well controlled by oral anti-diabetic (OAD) agents. The Cardiff model was populated with data synthesized from three head-to-head randomized clinical trials of up to 30 weeks in China comparing exenatide BID vs insulin glargine as add-on therapies to oral therapies in the Chinese population. The Cardiff model generated outputs including macrovascular and microvascular complications, diabetes-specific mortality, costs, and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Cost and QALYs were estimated with a time horizon of 40 years at a discount rate of 3% from a societal perspective. Compared with insulin glargine plus OAD treatments, patients on exenatide BID plus OAD gained 1.88 QALYs, at an incremental cost saving of Chinese Renminbi (RMB) 114,593 (i.e., cost saving of RMB 61078/QALY). The cost-effectiveness results were robust to various sensitivity analyses including probabilistic sensitivity analysis. The variables with the most impact on incremental cost-effectiveness ratio included HbA1c level at baseline, health utilities decrement, and BMI at baseline. Compared with insulin glargine QD, exenatide BID as add-on therapy to OAD is a cost-effective treatment in Chinese patients inadequately controlled by OAD treatments.\n\nThe prevalence and severity of oral impacts on daily performances in Thai primary school children\n\nPubMed Central\n\nGherunpong, Sudaduang; Tsakos, Georgios; Sheiham, Aubrey\n\n2004-01-01\n\nBackground Traditional methods of measuring oral health mainly use clinical dental indices and have been complemented by oral health related quality of life (OHRQoL) measures. Most OHRQoL studies have been on adults and elderly populations. There are no systematic OHRQoL studies of a population-based sample of children. The objective of this study was to assess the prevalence, characteristics and severity of oral impacts in primary school children. Methods Cross-sectional study of all 1126 children aged 11â12 years in a municipal area of Suphanburi province, Thailand. An OHRQoL measure, Child-Oral Impacts on Daily Performances index (Child-OIDP) was used to assess oral impacts. Children were also clinically examined and completed a self-administered questionnaire about demographic information and oral behaviours. Results 89.8% of children had one or more oral impacts. The median impact score was 7.6 and mean score was 8.8. Nearly half (47.0%) of the children with impacts had impacts at very little or little levels of intensity. Most (84.8%) of those with impacts had 1â4 daily performances affected (out of 8 performances). Eating was the most common performance affected (72.9%). The severity of impacts was high for eating and smiling and low for study and social contact performances. The main clinical causes of impacts were sensitive tooth (27.9%), oral ulcers (25.8%), toothache (25.1%) and an exfoliating primary tooth (23.4%). Conclusions The study reveals that oral health impacts on quality of life in Thai primary school children. Oral impacts were prevalent, but not severe. The impacts mainly related to difficulty eating and smiling. Toothache, oral ulcers and natural processes contributed largely to the incidence of oral impacts.

We report 2 cases of visually significant corneal epitheliopathy occurring after intravitreal injections of methotrexate for intraocular lymphoma. The first patient did not receive any treatment for the corneal disease, and the second patient with bilateral intraocular lymphoma received 1 mg of oral folic acid daily, a commonly used dosage for patients on systemic methotrexate. In the first patient without treatment, there was a complete regression of the corneal epithelial disease only when the frequency of intravitreal methotrexate was reduced from weekly to monthly as per a commonly used dosage regimen for methotrexate. In the second patient, the corneal disease improved 80% within 1 week of initiating oral folic acid for her eye already experiencing severe epitheliopathy during her weekly dosing regimen of methotrexate and also had significantly decreased epithelial disease in her second eye that started weekly intravitreal methotrexate several weeks after beginning oral folic acid. Currently, oral folic acid supplements are recommended for patients using systemic methotrexate to minimize drug toxicity. We suggest a similar use in patients undergoing intravitreal methotrexate injections to decrease toxic effects on the corneal epithelium.\n\nOral health and self-perceived oral treatment need of adults in Sweden.\n\nPubMed\n\nLundegren, Nina\n\n2012-01-01\n\nThe main aim of this thesis was to study the oral health and the self-perceived oral treatment need of adults in Sweden. The first step was to analyse the self-perceived oral treatment need in a random national sample of young adults (20 to 25-year-olds). This study used one patient and one dentist questionnaire. The patient questionnaire was sent to 611 young adults and the response rate was 78%. After permission from 377 of these individuals, a questionnaire was sent to their dentists and answers were received from 85% (321 dentists). How the individuals perceived their oral treatment need was used as a dependent variable in a multivariate logistic regression model. Independent variables were self-assessed socio-economic situation, general health and dental attitudes together with information from the dentists on their patient's dental status. The results showed that having a high educational level, poorer oral health compared to one's peers, and being concerned about one's oral health significantly increased the odds for a high perceived oral treatment need. In this group of young adults, 33% perceived a high oral treatment need. In order to study if the oral treatment need was the same in all adult age groups and how the perceived oral health was in an adult Swedish population, a new questionnaire was sent to a random sample of 9 690 individuals, 20 to 89-year-olds, living in SkÃ¥ne, Sweden. The response rate was 63%. The results showed that a majority of the adult population in SkÃ¥ne had a positive perception of their oral health, in particular the individuals in the youngest age group. Most individuals had lost few teeth and removable dentures were uncommon. One third rated their dental treatment need as high. The highest proportion of individuals with a perceived high oral treatment need was found in the age group 70-79. In order to study the perceived oral treatment need in all adult age groups, the questionnaire was further analysed.

To examine the frequency of oral mucosal lesions in wearers of orthodontic appliances in comparison to children with malocclusion. This study comprised 111 subjects: 60 wearers of orthodontic appliances and 51 controls (aged between 6 and 18 years). Type and severity of mucosal lesions, their topography, gingival inflammation, and oral hygiene status were determined by using clinical indices. Mucosal lesions were more present in wearers of orthodontic appliances than in children with malocclusion. Gingival inflammation, erosion, ulceration, and contusion were the most common findings in orthodontic patients. The severity of gingival inflammation was in correlation with oral hygiene status; the poorer oral hygiene, the more severe gingival inflammation was. Better oral hygiene status was found in children during orthodontic treatment than in children with malocclusion. Orthodontic treatment carries a higher risk of mucosal lesions and implies greater awareness of better oral hygiene as shown by the results of this study. Oral hygiene instructions and early treatment of oral lesions are important considerations in better patient's motivation, treatment planning, and successful outcome. Â© 2010 The Authors.

Oral alitretinoin (9-cis retinoic acid) was never systematically investigated in clinical trials, although case reports suggest its possible efficacy. To assess the efficacy and safety of oral alitretinoin taken at 30 mg once daily for up to 24 weeks in the treatment of severe oral lichen planus refractory to standard topical therapy. We conducted a prospective open-label single arm pilot study to test the efficacy and safety of 30 mg oral alitretinoin once daily for up to 24 weeks in severe oral lichen planus. Ten patients were included in the study. Primary end point was reduction in signs and symptoms measured by the Escudier severity score. Secondary parameters included pain and quality of life scores. Safety parameters were assessed during a follow-up period of 5 weeks. A substantial response at the end of treatment, i.e. >50% reduction in disease severity measured by the Escudier severity score, was apparent in 40% of patients. Therapy was well tolerated. Adverse events were mild and included headache, mucocutaneous dryness, musculoskeletal pain, increased thyroid-stimulating hormone and dyslipidaemia. Alitretinoin given at 30 mg daily reduced disease severity of severe oral lichen planus in a substantial proportion of patients refractory to standard treatment, was well tolerated and may thus represent one therapeutic option for this special group of patients.

Like other GLP-1 analogs, liraglutide delays gastric emptying, which could potentially affect absorption of concomitantly administered oral drugs. This study investigated the effect of liraglutide on the pharmacokinetics of the components of an oral contraceptive (ethinyl estradiol/levonorgestrel). Postmeno-pausal healthy women (n = 21) were included. A single dose of this contraceptive was administered. Blood samples for ethinyl estradiol/levonorgestrel measurements were drawn until 74 hours post dosing of the contraceptive during liraglutide and placebo treatments. The 90% confidence interval (CI) of the ratio of the area under the curve (AUC) (1.06; 90% CI, 0.99-1.13) for ethinyl estradiol (during liraglutide and placebo) was within defined limits, demonstrating equivalence. The 90% CI for the ratio of AUC for levonorgestrel was not fully contained within the limits (1.18; 90% CI, 1.04-1.34) (levonorgestrel AUC was 18% greater with liraglutide vs placebo). However, equivalence was demonstrated for levonorgestrel AUC(0-t) (1.15; 90% CI, 1.06-1.24). Equivalence was not demonstrated for maximum concentration (C(max)); values for ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel C(max) were 12% and 13% lower with liraglutide versus placebo, respectively. Both reached C(max) ~1.5 hours later with liraglutide. No clinically relevant reduction in bioavailability of ethinyl estradiol/levonorgestrel occurred.\n\nTreatment of streptococcal pharyngitis with once-daily compared with twice-daily amoxicillin: a noninferiority trial.\n\nPubMed\n\nClegg, Herbert W; Ryan, Amy G; Dallas, Steven D; Kaplan, Edward L; Johnson, Dwight R; Norton, H James; Roddey, Oliver F; Martin, Edward S; Swetenburg, Raymond L; Koonce, Elizabeth W; Felkner, Mary M; Giftos, P Michael\n\n2006-09-01\n\nTwo relatively small previous studies comparing once-daily amoxicillin with conventional therapy for group A streptococcal (GAS) pharyngitis reported similar rates of bacteriologic success for each treatment group. The purpose of this study was to further evaluate once-daily amoxicillin for GAS pharyngitis in a larger study. In a single pediatric practice, from October through May for 2 consecutive years (2001-2003), we recruited children 3 to 18 years of age who had symptoms and signs suggestive of GAS pharyngitis. Patients with a positive rapid test for GAS were stratified by weight (<40 kg or >or=40 kg) and then randomly assigned to receive once-daily (750 mg or 1000 mg) or twice-daily (2 doses of 375 mg or 500 mg) amoxicillin for 10 days. We determined bacteriologic failure rates for GAS in the pharynx from subsequent swabs taken at 14 to 21 (visit 2) and 28 to 35 (visit 3) days after treatment initiation. We conducted a randomized, controlled, investigator-blinded, noninferiority trial to evaluate whether amoxicillin given once daily would have a bacteriologic failure rate no worse than that of amoxicillin given twice daily within a prespecified margin of 10%. GAS isolates were characterized to distinguish bacteriologic failures from new acquisitions. Adverse events were described and adherence was evaluated by review of returned daily logs and dosage bottles. Of 2139 potential study patients during the 2-year period, we enrolled 652 patients, 326 into each treatment group. Children in the 2 groups were comparable with respect to all demographic and clinical characteristics except that children <40 kg more often presented with rash in each treatment group. At visit 2, failure rates were 20.1% (59 of 294) for the once-daily group and 15.5% (46 of 296) for the twice-daily group (difference, 4.53%; 90% confidence interval [CI], -0.6 to 9.7). At visit 3, failure rates were 2.8% (6 of 216) for the once-daily group and 7.1% (16 of 225) for the twice-daily group\n\nTreatment of chemotherapy-induced oral mucositis with light-emitting diode.\n\nPubMed\n\nCorti, Luigi; Chiarion-Sileni, Vanna; Aversa, Savina; Ponzoni, Alberto; D'Arcais, Raimondo; Pagnutti, Stefano; Fiore, Davide; Sotti, Guido\n\n2006-04-01\n\nThe aim of this study was to assess the clinical effectiveness of phototherapy with noncoherent light in the alleviation of chemotherapy-induced mucositis in patients with metastatic cancer. Mucositis occurs in more than 40% of chemotherapy-treated patients, significantly reducing the quality of their lives. Many different interventions have been evaluated to reduce oral mucositis. Recently, good results have been achieved by phototherapy with photoradiation, a technique which has virtually no side effects. Some clinical results seem to indicate that also phototherapy through noncoherent light emissions which can be produced by less expensive light sources such as light-emitting diodes (LEDs) may be effective. However, until now, no studies have been available on this subject. Twelve patients, aged from 34 to 82, selected on the basis of a diagnosis of chemotherapy-induced oral mucositis, were treated intra-orally through a noncoherent LED emission, wavelength 645 +/- 15 nm, 7.8 mW, fluence 0.99 J/cm(2), three times a day for 1 week. Mucositis was scored daily using the Daily Mucositis Index (DMI), a scale that evaluates the disease evolution through 16 different items. The primary end-point assessed was the time to recovery, from the start of LED treatment, compared to a nonrandomized control group of 12 patients with comparable stomatitis. The median healing time, expressed as the DMI decrease, was 1.7 (range 1-2.8) and, in seven LED-treated patients, was shorter than in the control group. The healing rate (measured as the ratio of the DMIs) increased from 117% to 164%. This pilot study shows that LED treatment is safe and capable of reducing the duration of chemotherapy-induced mucositis. This result needs to be confirmed in an adequate phase III study.\n\nOral Cryotherapy for Preventing Oral Mucositis in Patients Receiving Cancer Treatment.\n\nPubMed\n\nRiley, Philip; McCabe, Martin G; Glenny, Anne-Marie\n\n2016-10-01\n\nIn patients receiving treatment for cancer, does oral cryotherapy prevent oral mucositis?

The improvement in oral hygiene (OHI) by 33% is in harmony with an additional caries reduction by 33.3% (DMF/S index) and a decrease of the PM index by 47%. A wider use of oral hygiene actions as secondary preventive measures is, therefore, recommended also for towns with fluoridated drinking water.\n\nOnce-daily treatment of rheumatoid arthritis with choline magnesium trisalicylate.\n\nPubMed\n\nMann, C C; Boyer, J T\n\n1984-01-01\n\nA pilot study evaluated once-daily treatment of rheumatoid arthritis with choline magnesium trisalicylate (CMT) in patients diagnosed as having classical or definite rheumatoid arthritis, with morning stiffness as a major complaint. Twenty patients were selected who, in an earlier phase of the study, had found twice-daily treatment with CMT effective and tolerable. Efficacy was evaluated in 15 of these patients and safety was evaluated in all 20. Comparisons were made with the twice-daily regimen and with previous nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) therapy. Changes in clinical indicators (numbers of painful and swollen joints and the duration of morning stiffness) showed that once-daily treatment with CMT was as effective as twice-daily treatment with CMT or as treatment with other prior NSAIDs in controlling signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis. Side effects in both the twice-daily and the once-daily treatment regimens were similar in incidence and nature.\n\nONCE DAILY RISPERIDONE IN TREATMENT OF SCHIZOPHRENIA\n\nPubMed Central\n\nAgarwal, Vivek; Chadda, Rakesh K.\n\n2001-01-01\n\nForty four schizophrenic patients were randomly assigned to receive risperidone in 4-8 mg doses either once daily or twice daily for 8 weeks. An open trial was conducted to determine the efficacy of once daily administration of risperidone as compared to twice daily administration. Assessment were done on Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and Clinical Global Impression (CGI) scale Eighty two percent of the once daily patients and 79% of the twice daily patients showed a significant treatment response. No significant differences were observed between the two groups in response pattern and adverse effects at the end point. Risperidone given once daily was as effective as twice daily administration.

A multicenter, double-blind, randomized, noninferiority study enrolled subjects with AP or cUTI. Subjects received either levofloxacin 750 mg intravenously or orally once daily for 5 days or ciprofloxacin 400 mg intravenously and/or ciprofloxacin 500 mg orally twice daily for 10 days and were evaluated at end of therapy, posttherapy, and poststudy for microbiologic eradication and clinical outcome. A total of 1109 subjects were enrolled; 619 with confirmed diagnosis of AP or cUTI and a study entry uropathogen with a colony count 10(5) CFU/mL or greater and were included in the modified intent-to-treat population. Five hundred six subjects met all criteria for inclusion and were included in the microbiologically evaluable population. At end of therapy, eradication rates in the modified intent-to-treat population were 79.8% for levofloxacin and 77.5% for ciprofloxacin-treated subjects (95% CI, -8.8% to 4.1%). In the microbiologically evaluable population, eradication rates were 88.3% for levofloxacin and 86.7% for ciprofloxacin-treated subjects (95% CI, -7.4% to 4.2%). Outcomes were comparable for the 2 treatments at posttherapy and poststudy. This study demonstrates that both drug regimens are safe and effective and that a 5-day course of therapy with levofloxacin, administered at a dose of 750 mg once daily, is noninferior to a 10-day course of therapy with ciprofloxacin for the treatment of AP and cUTI.\n\nThe anti-tubercular drug delamanid as a potential oral treatment for visceral leishmaniasis\n\nPubMed Central\n\nPatterson, Stephen; Wyllie, Susan; Norval, Suzanne; Stojanovski, Laste; Simeons, Frederick RC; Auer, Jennifer L; Osuna-Cabello, Maria; Read, Kevin "
