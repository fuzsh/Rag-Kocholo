Adams and Zanne Domoney-Lyttle\n\nAbraham the father. Abraham the patriarch. Abraham, the founder of monotheistic faith traditions. Abraham, the recipient of God’s covenantal promises in Genesis. Abraham, the husband to Sarah, Hagar, and Keturah. Abraham, the father of nations. Abraham the exalted. First introduced in Gen. 11:27, the ﬁgure of Abraham has been given these titles as well as many others throughout the reception of his character in ancient Jewish and early Christian texts. His name has become synonymous with the foundations of Israel in the biblical texts, with covenantal promises made between God and Abraham the chosen one, with claims to land, identity, and personhood, and with themes of righteousness, sacredness, hospitality, and inheritance. From where did these constructs of Abraham’s character arise? Why is Abraham considered the ultimate father rather than a strong warrior or political leader? What aspects of his character are illuminated and remembered, and which are forgotten or suppressed? Furthermore, how is he remembered? This volume traces the diverse ways that Jewish and early Christian authors discussed Abraham, adapted his Hebrew and Greek Bible narratives, and used Abraham imagery in their works. The individual essays tease out the various ways that the character of Abraham was described, viewed, understood, and used, both within the Hebrew Bible and across diﬀerent collections of ancient texts, including the Apocrypha, Pseudepigrapha, rewritten Scriptures, and texts produced by Philo, Josephus, New Testament authors, early Church Fathers, Gnostic writers, and Greek and Latin outsiders. Across these chapters, several themes have emerged concerning the representation and memory of Abraham across Jewish and early Christian texts. Most prominently, Abraham is paired with his descendants, Isaac and Jacob, forming a triad of patriarchs through whom God’s covenant promises are given and reinforced. The patriarchal triumvirate is drawn upon in diverse ways, and many of the ancient authors discussed in this volume view Abraham through both a theological and an historical lens, recognizing him as a central ﬁgure of their spiritual belief and as the founding patriarch who lived in history. For Jewish 1\n\n2\n\nAbraham in Jewish and Early Christian Literature\n\nauthors in the Hebrew Bible, for example, Abraham is the father of their people and the person to whom God made his covenant promise; a promise transferred and rearticulated to Jacob and Isaac. For Christian authors, such as Paul and the early Church Fathers, Abraham retains his central position, but is reinterpreted in light of the authors’ understanding of the Christ event and the relationship between these two ﬁgures. A similar interpretive framework is applied by Gnosis authors, but for them Abraham is not a positive ﬁgure that needs to be incorporated into a new theological scheme, but someone who needs to be excised from the pure revelation of the true God that was oﬀered by Jesus. In general, depictions of Abraham are positive, with the patriarch presented as a model for emulation, the progenitor of the Jewish people, and a friend of God. This positive characterization is not surprising in that most of the people who discuss Abraham are Jewish. Some non-Jewish authors also present Abraham in a positive light, either because they are writing a history that is dependent on Scriptural texts, they are positively predisposed to Judaism (e.g., Hermippus), or because they are in the employ of a Jewish king (e.g., Nicolaus of Damascus). A majority of negative depictions come from non-Jewish authors, either historians who are writing polemical works (e.g., Manetho) or Gnostic authors (e.g., Marcion, Valentinus) who, for theological reasons, want to distance Jesus and their understanding of God with the creator God and characters from Jewish Scripture. This diversity of presentations provides a good example of the malleability of Abraham’s depiction and how an author’s starting point strongly inﬂuences, and perhaps even determines, how s/he will portray an individual. Another ﬁnding of this volume is the tendency by authors, both Jewish and Christian, to expand the Abraham narrative. For example, Philo (Rer. Div. Her. 27, 29; Congr. 151–52, 156; Abr. 71, 248–52) and the authors of Jubilees (19:26–22:30) and Genesis Apocryphon (2.3–18; 19.17–21) use constructed speeches to emphasize speciﬁc theological elements pertinent to their argument. Crafted speech is not limited to Abraham and human characters, but statements can also be attributed to God (e.g., LAB 7.4; 10.2; 12.4; 14.2; 18.5; 23.5–7). In contrast, Josephus signiﬁcantly abridges God and Abraham’s extensive dialogue about Sodom’s fate in Gen. 18:16-33 (Ant. 1.199–200), likely because this was not relevant/useful for Josephus’ literary purpose. In addition to creating speeches, ancient authors also sought, on occasion, to make changes to Abraham’s story. One practice was to ﬁll in narrative gaps; Abraham’s early life and post-mortem activities are subject to this approach. Scenes from Abraham’s youth are infrequent, but are found in a few texts that attempt to show how Abraham deviated from the practices and ideas of his father Terah (e.g., Apoc. Abr. 3.2–4; 8.3–4; LAB 6.1–18). These narrative expansions ﬁll gaps within Abraham’s narrative and help explain why Abraham was chosen by God. Depictions of Abraham’s post-mortem activities are less expected, but are prominent in Testament and Apocalypse texts and absent in most other genres. Here we ﬁnd Abraham as one of the people who will be raised at the resurrection of the dead (Sib. Or. 2.245–49), who has escaped from Hades (Apoc. Zeph. 9.4–5) or, alternatively, who exists in the presence of God continuing his intercessory work,\n\nIntroduction: Abraham in Jewish and Christian Authors\n\n3\n\npleading before God on behalf of his descendants and sinners (3 En. 44.7; T. Isaac 6.9–23). For many of these authors Abraham is a person who continues to exist (cf. Mt. 22:29-32). Another practice was to downplay awkward passages and reinterpret them in order to make the actions of Abraham or God less problematic. A good example is found in 4Q225 2.i.9–10 in which the Prince of the Mastemah accused Abraham before God regarding his son Isaac, an incident that is presented as the catalyst for the command to sacriﬁce Isaac. Regarding the relationship between Sarah and Pharaoh (Gen. 12:10-20), certain texts minimize the event by making Pharaoh the active character (Jub. 13:12-13), while others indicate that calling Sarah his sister was the necessary action to preserve his life (i.e., through a dream Gen. Apoc. 20.14–22).1 These changes relate to the exemplarity of Abraham and the need to ensure that what could be construed as morally questionable acts are properly understood.2 The downplaying of awkward narratives highlights the tension felt by ancient authors between being faithful to the text and taking creative license. Most authors use Abraham in a way that aligns closely with the Genesis text. The Testament of Abraham remained true to the Genesis narrative by not creating a death-bed testimony for Abraham, but added the scene in which Abraham asks to see the entire created world before his death (T. Abr. A9.6) and all the faces of Death (A19.5–6).3 The rationale for such an alignment is not always clear, but could be linked to the authority of the original text, the (likely) widely-held knowledge of the Abrahamic narrative by the intended readers, the piety of the author, or a combination of the above. Nevertheless, ancient authors did not feel absolutely constrained in their handling of the character of Abraham. Reading Abraham in light of, and in relationship to, other Scriptural passages or characters was a prominent way for ancient authors to engage with the Abrahamic narrative. The most common example is how authors throughout our chapters grouped Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob together as a triumvirate of Jewish patriarchy. Although Abraham can be, and regularly is, referenced individually, his association with Isaac and Jacob is signiﬁcant as it both traces the succession approved by God and acts as a shorthand for a theological perspective on the land and God’s\n\n1. The parallel, sister-calling narrative of Gen. 20:1-18 is even less prominent and is regularly part of the omitted material. 2. On the exemplarity of Abraham in speciﬁc corpora, see A.Y. Reed, “The Construction of Subversion of Patriarchal Perfection: Abraham and Exemplarity in Philo, Josephus, and the Testament of Abraham”, JSJ 40 (2009): 185–212. Cf. Sir. 44:19-21; Tob. 4:12; CD iii.2–3; Heb. 11:8-12; 1 Clem. 10.1–2. In contrast, the author of the Testament of Abraham, although depicting Abraham as faithful, also recounts how he refused a request from God (9.4–6) and goes back on a promise he made to Michael (15.1–10). 3. Cf. Origen, Hom. Luc. 35.3 in R. Bauckham, “The Dispute over Abraham. A New Translation and Introduction”, in Old Testament Pseudepigrapha: More Noncanonical Scriptures, Vol. 1, eds. R. Bauckham et al. (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 2013), 58–62.\n\n4\n\nAbraham in Jewish and Early Christian Literature\n\npromises. The reading of these lives together is not only important for tracing the history of the Jewish people, but could also be viewed symbolically (e.g., Philo, Abr. 48–51), with the triad oﬀering more than the sum of each part. Abraham’s relationship to Sarah, Hagar, and Keturah is less prominent than his pairing with Isaac and Jacob, and within the Hebrew Bible and Gnostic texts these women rarely feature. In a number of other corpora, the women are infrequently mentioned, and when they are, they are used as part of a wider argument about Abraham (e.g., Gal. 4:22-31).4 In contrast, certain authors, such as Philo, understand Sarah, and, to a lesser extent, Hagar as important ﬁgures in Abraham’s life (Abr. 245–54) and as symbolically meaningful in an interpretation of the Genesis text (e.g., Philo, Congr.). Similarly, Josephus appears bothered by Sarah’s absence from the Akedah narrative, and because of this, he adds that Abraham concealed God’s command from her (Ant. 1.225).5 The association of Abraham and other individuals is not limited to biblical characters who appear in his narrative. For example, in the Commentary on Genesis A (4Q252), the interpreter read the life of Abraham through a wider scriptural lens, especially the book of Deuteronomy. In works of rewritten Scripture, actions attributed to Abraham mirror those of other biblical characters,6 and in the Gnostic Second Discourse of Great Seth the author viewed Abraham as following the path of Adam in contrast to that of Seth (cf. NHC VII.2 62.27–63.3). These points of contact imply a more uniﬁed reading of the biblical texts in which the character of Abraham is not read in isolation, but as part of a wider theological and literary narrative. Ultimately, and perhaps unsurprisingly, the interpretation of Abraham is characterized by diversity. The theological or ideological perspective of the author substantially inﬂuences and often determines how they engage with Abraham and handle his narrative. In general, ancient authors, when evoking Abraham, highlighted one or more of his character traits (e.g., faith, hospitality, fatherhood, etc.) or read his story through a speciﬁc interpretive lens (e.g., allegory). When rewriting his narrative, authors regularly ﬁlled gaps, reordered events, expanded reported speech, and even made claims about Abraham’s current state in the afterlife. All of these actions show that Abraham was an important character for these ancient readers, and that they saw his narrative as particularly fruitful for interpretation and relevant to their lives.\n\n4. For a wider discussion, see J. McDonald, “Searching for Sarah in the Second Temple Era: Portraits in the Hebrew Bible and Second Temple Narratives”, PhD diss; Brite Divinity School, 2015. 5. Another example of the expansion of Sarah’s character is seen in Gen. Apoc. 20.1–8 and the description of her beauty. 6. E.g., Abraham’s escape from the ﬁery furnace by the Tower of Babel (LAB 6.3–18; cf. Dan. 3:1-30); Abraham unlike Noah and his family (CD iii.2–3); Abraham tested like Job (Jub. 17:15-18); cf. b. Sanh. 89b; Rab. Gen. 55.4.\n\nIntroduction: Abraham in Jewish and Christian Authors\n\n5\n\nChapter Summaries This volume contains eleven chapters in which each scholar evaluates how the character of Abraham is employed in their speciﬁc author or corpus. We recognize that this type of division is not always beneﬁcial and is regularly arbitrary (esp. Apocrypha, Pseudepigrapha, Gnostic, etc.), based on later reader or scholarly categories (e.g., canon) that were unlikely to have been germane to their ancient authors. Our volume structure is not an attempt to endorse the siloing of these texts, but is a concession to practicality. The starting point of the author determining a certain portrayal of the patriarch is only one relationship which aﬀects how Abraham is portrayed and perceived; another is the relationship between Abraham and the characters he is often seen interacting with in the texts of Genesis. Reading Abraham in the context of husband and father, for example, can impact how a reader may understand and receive the patriarch. This argument is drawn upon by Zanne Domoney-Lyttle in her chapter concerning Abraham in the Hebrew Bible. In this chapter, Domoney-Lyttle traces the reception not only of Abraham, but of his partners and the mothers of his children Sarah, Hagar, and Keturah throughout the texts of the Hebrew Bible. Domoney-Lyttle argues that, as the reader progresses through the Hebrew Bible, Abraham’s name becomes greater while the memory of his partners is erased, a move on behalf of the authors which indicates Abraham’s name is used to reinforce patriarchal ideologies concerning themes of land ownership and patrilineal descent; in short, the covenantal promises. Abraham’s name becomes a metaphor for those promises, a metaphor which would be threatened with the inclusion of Sarah, or Hagar, or Keturah. Thus, by selectively preserving certain parts of Abraham’s history, the writers of the Hebrew texts present a counter memory of Abraham, which supports a political agenda of land ownership and a social agenda of correct family lineage. Though an important ﬁgure in the Hebrew Bible, Abraham is not one of the central ﬁgures; David, Moses, and even Solomon have stronger claims to this title. One of the emerging themes in this volume is that, despite Abraham’s lack of centrality in the Hebrew Scriptures, he actually becomes increasingly popular in the ancient texts which follow. In Géza G. Xeravits’ chapter concerning Abraham in the Old Testament Apocrypha, he traces common themes of Abraham’s story which suggest that Abraham was not only a popular ﬁgure, but that there is strong evidence of a rich tradition of literature and history built around the patriarch. We can see this for example in the way that Genesis 22 is recalled and re-presented in various apocryphal books such as Judith, 1 Maccabees, and the Book of Wisdom, which suggest not only that the memory of events in Abraham’s later life is still important, but also that he grew in popularity speciﬁcally because his name could be used as a model of faith and trust in God through the invocation of narratives such as Genesis 22. Finally, Xeravits draws attention to the malleability of Abraham’s character as well as thematic variability within his biographical narratives, noting\n\n6\n\nAbraham in Jewish and Early Christian Literature\n\nagain the approach of authors who selected and re-presented aspects of Abraham’s life to reframe his character according to need. Jared Ludlow’s chapter traces the use of Abraham in Old Testament Pseudepigrapha. In this chapter, Ludlow also draws the reader’s attention to the creative approach of ancient authors to gaps in Abraham’s life which add color and intrigue to his character, but which also remain consistent with more traditional approaches to his biography. In the Testament of Abraham for example, Abraham’s refusal to follow the angel Michael to heaven (Recension A) almost presents him as a stubborn and disloyal character, the opposite traits which readers usually associate with Abraham. To rectify this, Ludlow discusses how Recension B of the same story foregrounds Abraham’s intentions as an explanation for the trouble he causes in the text. This short example demonstrates the importance that Abraham’s character should be remembered positively, and with the traits that many Jewish and early Christian communities had come to recognize him for. Moving away from characterization, a number of the chapters identiﬁed a possible relationship between the genre of a work and how the Genesis narrative was used. In her chapter on Rewritten Scripture, Susan Docherty identiﬁes speciﬁc approaches to Abraham’s Genesis narrative by authors of Rewritten Scripture, two of which we have seen in the above chapters: 1) selective abridgement or omission of speciﬁc narratives in Abraham’s story, and 2) the provision of a new context for episodes from Abraham’s life. Other exegetical techniques highlighted by Docherty include: 1) the reordering of some events in the Abraham narrative; 2) the introduction of minor diﬀerence from the Genesis accounts; and 3) the inclusion of supplementary material in which the author’s own emphases can be developed. On this last point, Docherty argues that it is the addition of material which reshapes the ﬁgure of Abraham rather than the tweaking of Genesis narratives. Unlike the previous chapters which have highlighted the ideological concerns of authorship in the presentation of Abraham, Docherty argues that rewritten Scriptures are exegetical in their focus (i.e., concerned with clarifying the texts) and less concerned with propagating political or social concerns. In his chapter on Abraham in the corpus of Philo of Alexandria, Sean Adams adopts a character theory approach, and evaluates how Philo reads Abraham’s life in light of his relationships. Adams argues that modern theories about how character is developed in narratives can be proﬁtably applied to Philo’s interpretation of the Genesis narrative. In particular, an interﬁgural approach, which identiﬁes relations between characters within or from diﬀerent texts, highlights how Philo deﬁnes Abraham through his engagement and relationship to other characters, especially, but not limited to, Sarah, Isaac, Lot, and Pharaoh. Michael Avioz argues in his chapter on Abraham in Josephus’ writings, that they should be considered an exegetical project as well. Avioz’ categorization of Josephus’ writings as exegesis diﬀers from Docherty’s taxonomy; instead, Avioz argues Josephus’ reputation as exegete is concerned with translating the Hebrew biblical text into Greek, with reconciling contradictions in the Hebrew Bible, and with addressing problematic ethical issues which might have troubled GraecoRoman readers.\n\nIntroduction: Abraham in Jewish and Christian Authors\n\n7\n\nJoshua W. Jipp considers the role of Abraham within the Gospels and Acts of the New Testament. In this study, Abraham’s memory is invoked inconsistently across NT texts, and Jipp draws out both the similarities and diﬀerences across the handling of Abraham’s narrative to demonstrate once again that his name and memory is called upon to endorse or suggest social or political ideologies. In the Gospels (excluding Mark), Abraham is used as a link between God’s covenant with Israel and the person of Jesus, through genealogical descent (e.g., the genealogical material in Matthew), but also through his acting of the deeds of Abraham (e.g., in John), for example. Abraham as model of faith, hospitality, and fatherhood is prevalent within these texts and indicates not only how the patriarch was understood, but also the qualities which were of most importance to those ancient communities. The role of Abraham as exemplar is also debated in Pauline scholarship and is typically viewed as falling upon interpretational lines; for scholars who advocate for the “Old Perspective” Abraham represents a model of faith (esp. Romans 4), whereas, for “New Perspective” scholars Abraham is not interpreted primarily in those terms. In his chapter on Abraham in Paul’s letters, Chris Tilling has argued that this classiﬁcation dichotomy does not accurately represent scholarly positions, and dampens the nuance proposed by scholars in their reading of Paul. Seth Ehorn’s chapter on Abraham in the Apostolic Fathers highlights the importance of Abraham’s family line (both literally and spiritually) in forming identities for early Christian writers. Ehorn here notes that these ancient authors often selected and/or modiﬁed speciﬁc narratives from the life of Abraham to support and suggest their own political and social agendas, a theme prevalent across many of the chapters. These agendas may be minor (i.e. using Abraham as a model of hospitality in 1 Clement) or have wider signiﬁcance (i.e. Ignatius Christianizing Abraham, diluting his Jewish origins in his Letter to the Philadelphians). Ehorn’s chapter suggests the continued importance of Abraham as a character in faith traditions, but only when the invocation of his name can be used in speciﬁc ways. Another ﬁnding of this volume is the relationship between the depiction of Abraham and the context of the author who employed him. For example, among non-Jewish authors, the depiction of Abraham changed from that of a militaristic and monarchical individual to that of religious founder knowledgeable of divine lore. This shift paralleled the rise in Christianity within the Empire and the importance of Abraham in religious discussions, an argument proposed by Margaret Williams in her chapter on Abraham in Greek and Latin authors. Csaba Ötvös traces the reception of Abraham in the ancient Gnostic systems. As noted by Ötvös, Abraham is not a central ﬁgure in the Gnostic texts, and does not often appear in primary or secondary sources regarding that literature. Where Abraham’s name does appear, it is often used allusively to suggest a connection with biblical material. In this context then, Abraham’s name is used to legitimize the authority and knowledge of the writer rather than invoking the patriarch’s name to highlight an agenda or suggest the moral implications of Abraham’s life story. This suggests that invoking Abraham’s name is a way for ancient Gnostic\n\n8\n\nAbraham in Jewish and Early Christian Literature\n\nauthors to claim their own power and identity, a move which is arguably a step beyond the reception of Abraham discussed in the previous chapters. The ﬁgure of Abraham has lived many afterlives throughout the texts discussed in this volume. This volume is not only a testament to the importance of the patriarch, but also adds to the living story of Abraham whose name continues to pervade religious and cultural traditions, and whose afterlife continues in these new texts which center on his character. By presenting a more thorough outline of the impact of the ﬁgure and stories of Abraham, we have created a more concise and complete idea of how his narrative was employed throughout the centuries, including how ancient authors adopted and adapted received traditions. This study only traces a few avenues of reception and there are many more paths to investigate. In particular, investigating the reception of Abraham in other faith traditions and in subsequent time periods and texts would be fruitful lines of inquiry in their own right, but would also shed more light on how Abraham was understood in the corpora discussed in this volume.\n\nChapter 1 A B R A HA M I N T H E H E B R EW B I B L E Zanne Domoney-Lyttle\n\nLike much of the Hebrew Bible, Abraham’s narrative is entrenched in a patriarchal structure of creation and reception. It was written by men, for men, and is mostly about men. Where women are represented, they exist as secondary components within an androcentric narrative, allowing men to continue moving, talking, ﬁghting, procreating, establishing dynasties, and even dying.1 Rarely are women given their own stories, and rarely are their perspectives represented in any meaningful way.2 The patriarchal narratives in Genesis 12–50, stories in which Abraham is a key ﬁgure, exist only because there were women who enabled the lineage of Abraham ﬁrstly to come into being, and secondly to continue growing. However, within the Hebrew Bible as a whole, it is Abraham’s name, along with his son Isaac and his grandson Jacob, which are repeatedly remembered and which are invoked to reinforce patriarchal ideologies concerning covenantal themes of land ownership and patrilineal descent, mostly through the concept of Abraham as the father to his people.3 The near complete erasure of women, and in particular of mothers in the reception of the patriarchal narratives, is not particularly surprising given their androcentric origins and history.4 However, it does lead to a quandary for readers\n\n1. For example, Delilah weakens Samson by ﬁnding out his strength is his hair. She shaves his head and hands him over to the Philistines, an action which arguably leads to his death (Judg. 16:17-30). Delilah disappears after handing Samson to his enemies. 2. With the exception, perhaps, of Ruth and Naomi (book of Ruth), Esther (book of Esther), and Judith (book of Judith, in the Apocrypha). 3.

Stavrakopoulou, Land of our Fathers: The Roles of Ancestor Veneration in Biblical Land Claims (London: T&T Clark, 2010). 4. As Ackerman suggests, “Ancient Israel was a kinship-based society, with kinship deﬁned through the patriline, so that both genealogies and rights of inheritance were, with only a very few exceptions, [. . .] traced through patrilineal lines of descent.” See: S. Ackerman, “Women in Ancient Israel and the Hebrew Bible”, Oxford Research Encyclopedia of Religion,\n\n9\n\n10\n\nAbraham in Jewish and Early Christian Literature\n\nas, outside of the book of Genesis, they regularly encounter Abraham as a father of descendants who have no meaningful connections to their mothers. I argue that, as the reader progresses through the books of the Hebrew Bible, the memory of the mothers is so thoroughly erased and subsequently forgotten that it can appear to the reader that Abraham’s descendants are in fact “motherless” children. At least, the sons of Abraham usurp the ﬁgure of mother completely, taking her place in the texts. These ﬁssures in the text are problematic and lead to assumptions that mothers are ﬁrstly non-essential characters in the patriarchal narratives, and secondly, that they are a disposable component in the shaping of Israel’s future. Again, this outcome is unsurprising in a text concerned mostly with presenting and preserving male perspectives, but it does lead to a lopsided view of the relationship between fathers and mothers within the Bible as a whole. Further, the lack of attention paid to the mothers of the Abrahamic narratives shapes how the reader views and understands the ﬁgure of Abraham-the-father in the Hebrew Bible outside of the book of Genesis. This chapter is concerned with tracing the reception of Abraham across the books of the Hebrew Bible outlining Abraham’s identity and reputation as “father”, speciﬁcally with regards to the collective social memory of Abraham as father, juxtaposed against the erasure of his three wives/partners within the books of the Hebrew Bible. I also discuss the implications those representations may carry for the reception of Abraham in the Hebrew Scriptures more broadly. To begin, I turn to the texts of Genesis to explore the characterization of Abraham as father within the patriarchal narratives, before turning to examine the development and proliferation of that characterization throughout the books of the Torah, the Prophets, and the Writings.\n\nAbraham the Father Father of Isaac and Ishmael and the sons of Keturah, husband to Sarah, Hagar and Keturah, Abraham is the recipient of the promise of countless descendants, an area of land and a blessing bestowed by God. Unsurprisingly, the language used to describe Abraham throughout the Hebrew Bible is based in masculine pronouns and male-dominated word-choices, mostly through the use of “father” as a title. In Deut. 1:8, for example, Abraham is referred to as “father” to his people (‫) ַלאֲב ֹתֵ יכֶם‬, who are now charged with claiming the land that was promised to them through him: “See, I have set the land before you; go in and take possession of the land that I swore to your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give to them and to\n\nhttp://religion.oxfordre.com/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780199340378.001.0001/acrefore9780199340378-e-45 (last accessed 17 September 2018). The patrilineal structure, which aﬀected families, law, inheritance, etc., probably meant that space for women was restricted or limited to speciﬁc roles within the community. Ackerman discusses this in her outline on gendered roles in the Hebrew Bible in the above work.\n\nAbraham in the Hebrew Bible\n\n11\n\ntheir descendants after them.” In Isa. 41:8, the reference to Abraham’s fatherhood is brought up again: “But you, Israel, my servant, Jacob, whom I have chosen, the oﬀspring of Abraham, my friend.” The connotation behind the use of ‫ז ֶַרע‬, which is regularly glossed “oﬀspring” (NRSV) and sometimes “seed” (KJV, for example), is linked to male virility, and appears only once in relation to female fertility in the Hebrew Bible.5 Even the name “Abraham” is linked to concepts of masculinity and fatherhood. Abraham’s pre-covenantal name “Abram” means either “exalted father” or “father of elevation”, and “Abraham” can be translated as “father of a multitude”.6 Abraham’s identity as both “man” and “father” is not only central to his narrative and impact in the Hebrew Bible, it is also used to provide an identity and voice to his descendants. Throughout the Hebrew Bible, references abound to Abraham as father,7 or to God identifying himself as the “God of your father(s), Abraham, (Isaac, and Jacob)”.8 Mostly, invocations to the patriarchal triumvirate are bound with appeals from the people of Israel to be remembered by God through his covenant with Abraham. The ability to trace their genealogy to Abraham their father is a method of classifying themselves against other groups in the land, as well as for staking a claim on their promised land,9 and deﬁning social functions, juridical powers and religious imperatives associated with the genealogical system of the Israelite community.10 For such an important ﬁgure who is literarily the father of all of his descendants, it must also be acknowledged that Abraham is not even one of the most recognized ﬁgures in the Hebrew Bible.11 “Abram” is mentioned ﬁfty-nine times in the book of\n\n5. ‫ ז ֶַרע‬relates to sowing seed, semen virile, oﬀspring, and sprouts or shoots. In relation to women, ‫ ז ֶַרע‬appears only once in Gen. 3:15 in connection with Eve. However, J. J. Collins persuasively argues that syntactical features potentially distinguish between ‫ ז ֶַרע‬meaning the singular “seed” or the plural, “seeds”, concluding that in Genesis 3:15, the “seed of the woman” indicates a single descendant rather than multiple descendants, as is the case whenever the word is used in connection with Abraham. See: J. J. Collins, “A Syntactical Note (Genesis 3:15): Is the Woman’s Seed Singular or Plural?”, TynBull 48, no. 1 (1997): 139–48. 6. R. Hendel calls the naming of Abraham in Gen. 17:5 “a performative utterance in which God makes Abraham the ancestor par excellence.” R.

Blenkinsopp, Abraham: The Story of a Life (Grand Rapids, MI: Wm B Eerdmans, 2015), 1.\n\n12\n\nAbraham in Jewish and Early Christian Literature\n\nGenesis and a further two times outside of Genesis (1 Chron. 1:27; Neh. 9:7). “Abraham” is mentioned 117 times in Genesis, and only forty-two times outside of Genesis, and the name “Abram” or “Abraham” appears in isolation (i.e., without reference to his descendants),12 or without reference to the title of “father”, only seven times outside of the book of Genesis.13 From this brief quantitative study, it can be surmised that the connection between Abraham and “father” is consistent throughout the Hebrew Bible. This indicates that Abraham’s signiﬁcance extends beyond the role of a character in a series of legends, using descriptions of Abraham that normally include a patriarchal element. However, this count of Abraham’s name also suggests he is not as important a ﬁgure as other biblical men, such as Moses, David, or even Solomon, whose names appear in the biblical texts much more frequently,14 and unlike these men, he is far more likely to be linked with the concept of father, rather than the idea of his being a great warrior, king, or leader.15 Most current scholarship on the reception of Abraham in the Hebrew Bible is concerned with his identity and role as father and how that relates to possession of territories as promised in his covenant with God.16 It is mostly men who have thus far undertaken such scholarship, and the results, though fruitful, challenging and rigorous, are steeped in androcentric perspectives, often reﬂecting the social location of the scholars. As Frances Klopper notes in relation to biblical studies in general, “[t]raditional male commentators wrote under the guise of neutrality but imposed their assumptions on the text and failed to question its moral diﬃculties.”17 This is true with regards to the reception of Abraham in the Hebrew Bible as well as in other ancient texts.\n\n12. By this I mean descendants in any form, including references to children, seed etc., named or unnamed, preceding or succeeding the name of Abraham. 13. See: Josh. 24:2; 1 Chron. 1:27; Neh. 9:7; Ps. 47:9; Ps. 105:42; Isa. 63:16; Ezek. 33:24. 14. Moses’ name occurs 764 times in 702 verses; David’s name occurs 1,018 times across 859 verses; Solomon’s name occurs 287 times in 260 verses. While it is not the most scientiﬁc way to explore the inﬂuence of these ﬁgures on the rest of the Hebrew Bible, I argue that charting the number of times their names appear does give some indication as to how memories of their names and their deeds are invoked. 15. Granted, Abraham is also associated with characteristics of a great leader, and occasionally a warrior (see Genesis 14, for example), but I maintain that the strongest association with Abraham is as a father. 16. See for example: Römer, “Abraham Traditions in the Hebrew Bible”; ch. 1 in Blenkinsopp, Abraham: The Story of a Life; Hendel, Remembering Abraham; E. Noort, “Abraham and the Nations”, in Abraham, the Nations, and the Hagarites: Jewish, Christian, and Islamic Perspectives on Kinship with Abraham, eds. M. Goodman et al.

A Feminist Perspective on the Objective Fallacy”, Old Testament Essays 22, no. 1 (2009): 88–101.\n\nAbraham in the Hebrew Bible\n\n13\n\nThe emphasis on interpreting Abraham as a father ﬁgure in Genesis and beyond is so well-established, that considerations of how Abraham achieved that title in the ﬁrst place—namely because his wives and sexual partners,18 Sarah, Hagar, and Keturah, became pregnant and gave birth—have been more or less lost in scholarship. As noted, there are a number of studies on Abraham as a father,19 and there are a number of studies on motherhood narratives in Genesis.20 However, little consideration has been given to the reception of Abraham in the Hebrew Bible in relation to his wives/partners,21 and how the erasure of the mothers throughout the Hebrew Bible impacts the reception of Abraham as father.\n\n18. It is understood that Sarah is Abraham’s primary-wife (the Hebrew ‫ ִאשָּׁה‬is used in Gen. 11:29 for example), while Hagar is described as ‫ש ְפחָה‬ ׁ ִ meaning female slave or a maidservant in Gen. 16:1, though is once called “wife” in Gen. 16:3 before her status reverts back to slave in Gen. 16:5. After the death of Sarah, Abraham marries Keturah (Gen. 25:1) and she is described in the same language as Sarah, ‫ ִאשָּׁה‬in the text of Genesis. However, Keturah is then called ‫( פִּי ֶלגֶשׁ‬concubine or paramour) in 1 Chron. 1:32, a demotion from the position of primary-wife which she occupies in Genesis. The insinuation taken from these word choices is that Sarah is Abraham’s primary-wife, Hagar is a handmaid or slave-girl belonging to Sarah but given to Abraham by Sarah, and Keturah assumes ﬁrstly the position of primary-wife after Sarah’s death, but her reception in later biblical texts is as a concubine because she does not embody the same status as Sarah, who has produced Abraham’s heir to the covenantal promise. The legal status of concubines is still contested among biblical scholars, so it is unclear whether Keturah enjoyed the same privileges as Sarah, or if she was treated diﬀerently legally or otherwise. Collectively, I will refer to them as wives/partners. For more on the legal status of women and wives see: I. Hamley, “‘Dis(re)membered and Unaccounted For’: ‫ פִּי ֶלגֶשׁ‬in the Hebrew Bible”, JSOT 42, no. 4 (2018): 415–34; S. DémareLafont, “The Status of Women in the Legal Texts of the Ancient Near East”, in The Bible and Women: An Encyclopaedia of Exegesis and Cultural History—Torah, eds. I. Fischer et al. (Atlanta: SBL, 2011), 109–32. 19. See, for example: C. Delaney, Abraham on Trial: The Social Legacy of Biblical Myth (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1998). There are further examples above. 20. See, for example: E. Fuchs, “The Literary Characterisation of Mothers and Sexual Politics in the Hebrew Bible”, in Women in the Hebrew Bible: A Reader, ed. A. Bach (New York/London: Routledge, 1999), 127–40; Exum, Fragmented Women, especially ch. 4: “The (M)other’s Place”. It should be noted that there are proportionally fewer studies on Keturah than exist on Sarah and Hagar. 21. There are, of course, a few sources which deal with the theme of Abraham and his partners in relation to the covenantal promises. For example, see: U. Bechmann, “Genesis 12 and the Abraham-Paradigm Concerning the Promised Land”, The Ecumenical Review 68, no. 1 (2016): 62–80, https://doi.org/10.1111/erev.12199 (accessed June 11, 2019).\n\n14\n\nAbraham in Jewish and Early Christian Literature\n\nAbraham and His Progeny To be a father, one must have oﬀspring. Generally speaking, to produce oﬀspring one requires a female, and Abraham had three women in his life: Sarah, Hagar, and Keturah.22 Sarah was his ﬁrst wife and the reader is told she was very beautiful, but infertile.23 After a period of time and signiﬁcant events including the HagarIshmael episode (Genesis 16), Sarah eventually becomes pregnant following a divine proclamation (Gen. 18:10) and gives birth to Isaac in Gen. 21:1-3. Hagar was Sarah’s slave and appears to have no diﬃculties bearing children, giving birth to Ishmael in Gen. 16:15 after Sarah oﬀers her to Abraham as a way to procure a child. Keturah was married to Abraham after the death of Sarah and was also seemingly fertile as she gave birth to six sons before Abraham died (Gen. 25:2). It is through these women that Abraham is made a father, a patriarch, yet they do not ﬁgure in the narratives of the Hebrew Bible which call upon Abraham’s name in remembrance, except for on three occasions. In contrast to Abraham’s recurring title of “father” in the Hebrew Bible, Sarah is only called “mother” twice in Genesis (Gen. 17:16; 24:67) and her association with motherhood occurs only once outside of Genesis, in Isa. 51:2: “Look to Abraham your father and to Sarah who bore you”. That is also the only instance that her name occurs outside of Genesis. Keturah is never given the title “mother” but is named as bearer to Abraham’s children twice in the book of Genesis (25:1; 25:4) and twice outside of Genesis in 1 Chron. 1:32-33. Hagar is given the descriptor of “mother” once within Genesis (21:21) but is not mentioned again in the Hebrew Bible. Abraham’s identity of father is strongly reiterated throughout the Hebrew Bible as we have seen, yet the handful of references to the mothers who bear his children suggests both that they are unimportant characters within the covenantal narratives, and, as such, they are not signiﬁcant factors in the future of Abraham and his descendants. Sarah, Hagar, and Keturah do not need to be remembered. Because of this, the memory of the mothers is erased as the reader progresses throughout the Hebrew Bible, so I will now examine the texts of the Hebrew Bible which support this view, and argue that the erasure of motherhood impacts on the characterization of Abraham.\n\nAbraham the Father in Genesis The identity of Abraham as “father” pervades the texts of Genesis. He is ﬁrst introduced to readers of the narrative as part of a genealogical line connecting\n\n22. Following an ancient rabbinic idea, Rashi suggests that Hagar and Keturah are the same person, but there is no textual evidence to suggest this. See: R.E. Friedman, Commentary on the Torah (New York, NY: HarperCollins, 2001), 85. 23. See Gen. 12:11 and 11:29-30, respectively.\n\nAbraham in the Hebrew Bible\n\n15\n\nNoah’s son Shem to Abraham’s father Terah (Gen. 11:10-26), indicating to the reader that Abraham and his brothers, Nahor and Haran, are descended from righteous stock. The genealogical recantation ends with Abraham and his brothers, signaling the beginning of a new narrative which introduces the wives of Abram and Nahor, Sarai and Milcah (Gen. 11:29-30), and tells of Terah’s death (Gen. 11:32). Terah’s death marks the shift from Abraham’s historical family line to his future line in Genesis 12. In the beginning of his story, Abraham is promised land, a blessing, and descendants who will become a great nation (Gen. 12:1-3).24 The text is ambiguous here; it is unclear if this promise refers to direct descendants born to Abraham through his wife Sarah, who is described as infertile in Gen. 11:30, or if the reference is to descendants born through his kin: his brother Nahor, or his nephew Lot, for example. As the narrative progresses in Genesis, Abraham raises this point when he questions God in Gen. 15:3: “You have given me no oﬀspring, and so a slave born in my house is to be heir.” God responds in the negative, reassuring Abraham that “no one but your very own issue shall be your heir” (Gen. 15:4), which Abraham believes, making him righteous in the eyes of his God. A solution to Abraham’s lack of oﬀspring is presented in Genesis 16 when Sarah gives her slave-girl Hagar to Abraham in order that Sarah may “obtain children by her” (Gen. 16:2). Abraham lies with Hagar and she falls pregnant, but Sarah expels her from the community after Hagar “looked with contempt on her mistress”.25 Quite what this means is unclear; suﬃce to say Hagar has harmed her mistress enough for Sarah to expel the only chance Abraham has had at this point to father a child. Arguably, Abraham has thus far been central to the covenantal story between himself and God. Sarah has been by his side for the most part but is a secondary character, and Hagar is only introduced at the beginning of Genesis 16. This structure of power in the narrative alters in Genesis 16 as, arguably, Sarah leads the narrative in this chapter. It is her suggestion to use Hagar as a vessel for a child\n\n24. J.N. Oswalt notes that these promises are “mundane” because they were “neither spiritual nor transcendent” but based on material things that Abraham potentially could have gotten by himself. He also suggests there is nothing “religious” about these promises which were made to Abraham seven times (see: 33–34 of his chapter). However, this misses the point, because a combination of descendants, land, and blessings from God would give Abraham’s name immortality among the people, and is one of the factors which allowed “religious” traditions as we understand them today, to form around the father-ﬁgure. See: J.N. Oswalt, “Abraham’s Experience of Yahweh: An Argument for the Historicity of the Patriarchal Narratives”, in Perspectives on Our Father Abraham: Essays in Honour of Marvin R. Wilson, ed. S.A. Hunt (Grand Rapids, MI/Cambridge: William B. Eerdmans, 2010), 33–43. 25. Van Seters discusses this episode further in: J. van Seters, “The Problem of Childlessness in Near Eastern Law and the Patriarchs of Israel”, JBL 87, no. 4 (1968): 401–8, here 403.\n\n16\n\nAbraham in Jewish and Early Christian Literature\n\n(Gen. 16:2), and it is her demand to banish Hagar (Gen. 16:6). Overarchingly, it is Sarah who takes control of ensuring Abraham becomes a father and fulﬁls God’s covenantal promise, even though Abraham is the character most concerned with his lack of progeny (Gen. 15:3). Sarah’s initial plan for Hagar to fall pregnant is successful but, as noted above, Hagar’s new status of the bearer of Abraham’s child causes friction between her and Sarah, and Hagar is expelled into the wilderness. Here, she receives a divine visitation from a messenger of God, announcing that she will have a son called Ishmael because God has “heard” her plight (Gen. 16:11).26 Abraham is not party to this declaration, and this scene marks Hagar as the ﬁrst woman in biblical text to receive a divine proclamation from an angel of God. That it is Hagar, a lowly Egyptian slave-girl who receives reassurance and a promise from God concerning her son, and not Abraham— who is partly responsible for banishing her to certain death even though she carries his long-sought after progeny—indicates two things. Firstly, Hagar as mother is the parent concerned for the wellbeing of her child and herself, and requires comfort from God,27 but Abraham as father is missing from both the text and the proclamation, which suggests he is seemingly unconcerned with the fate of both mother and child. This reﬂects the passivity of his response to Sarah expelling Hagar in 16:6, as well as his general passivity in resolving the problem of a lack of children despite covenantal promises (cf. Gen. 15:3). Secondly, this suggests that Ishmael’s fate will never be the concern of Abraham the father but only of Hagar the mother, foreshadowing what is to come in Gen. 21:8-21. The expulsion of Hagar and Ishmael in Gen. 16:6-14 demonstrates that Hagar-the-mother is central to the survival of Abraham’s child, whereas Abraham-the-father is accountable for the near-death of his unborn son. Hagar returns to the family and gives birth to Ishmael in Gen. 16:15, and Abraham becomes a father for the ﬁrst time. Despite his reputation in the Hebrew Bible as being the ultimate father, he has not shown many fatherly attributes thus far. The Hagar-Ishmael episode in Genesis 16 is somewhat reversed in Genesis 18. Whereas it was Hagar/mother who received the promise of a son from God without Abraham, in Genesis 18 it is Abraham/father who receives the promise from God that Sarah will bear him a son. This time Sarah/mother is not privy to God’s promise; instead, she must eavesdrop at the door of her tent in order to hear that she will fall pregnant. In this episode, Abraham receives the promise from the visitors in silence, but Sarah is heard laughing, an action which foreshadows the name of her miracle child, Isaac (i.e., “he laughs”).28 Sarah’s response of laughter juxtaposed against Abraham’s silence suggests either her disbelief and Abraham’s acceptance or Abraham’s disbelief (he is too shocked to speak) and Sarah’s joy— the text is unclear.\n\n26. Ishmael’s name is a play on words, often translated as “God hears”, referencing that he heard Hagar’s distress. See: N.M. Sarna ed., The JPS Torah Commentary: Genesis (Philadelphia: The Jewish Publication Society, 1994), 121. 27. Sarna, Genesis, 120–1. 28. Sarna, Genesis, 127.\n\nAbraham in the Hebrew Bible\n\n17\n\nSarah becomes pregnant and gives birth to Isaac in Genesis 21 and, unlike Ishmael who is named by the divine messenger in Gen. 16:11, it is Abraham who names Isaac (Gen. 21:3). This action emphasizes the diﬀerent treatment of each child by Abraham as father; one child is left to the care of God, the other is cared for under the protection of family with Abraham as head. The banishment of Hagar and Ishmael into the wilderness for a second time follows the birth of Isaac (Gen. 21:10), but not before Abraham displays emotion for the ﬁrst time towards one of his children: 11\n\nThe matter was very distressing to Abraham on account of his son.12 But God said to Abraham, “Do not be distressed because of the boy and because of your slave woman; whatever Sarah says to you, do as she tells you, for it is through Isaac that oﬀspring shall be named for you.13 As for the son of the slave women, I will make a nation of him also, because he is your oﬀspring.”\n\nAbraham’s distress at the thought of banishing Ishmael potentially demonstrates that an emotional bond has developed between father and son since the ﬁrst time Hagar was cast out while carrying her child.29 He is now physically and psychologically unwilling to cast out his son, who he has seen grow up before his eyes. From a contemporary perspective, this suggests Abraham acts as a father to his children only after birth when they are able to interact with him, to play with him, to learn and to grow in front of him, but this bond appears to be either nonexistent or much weaker while his children are in utero. However, through the lens of high infant and female mortality rates in antiquity, distance between unborn child and father could also suggest that Abraham did not develop a bond until he knew his child was born safely and healthily. In Gen. 21:12-13, God placates Abraham by promising him that Ishmael will thrive and become a great name if Abraham follows Sarah’s instructions. This reassurance is enough to override any emotional distress Abraham is feeling, and he acquiesces to Sarah’s demand, sending his son and his partner Hagar into the wilderness for a second time. The display of emotion in that narrative contrasts with the infamously emotionless scene of the Akedah narrative in Genesis 22. Described by Erich Auerbach as “fraught with background”,30 God’s command that Abraham sacriﬁce his son, “his only son, Isaac” (Gen. 22:2) is met with silence from Abraham and a\n\n29. Sarna suggests that it is “fatherly love” and “moral considerations” which make Abraham hesitate in carrying out Sarah’s orders. Sarna, Genesis, 147. 30. In Auerbach’s comparison between Genesis 22 and the Odyssey, he describes the biblical text as a text which purposefully lacks details and emotions, in order to accumulate suspense as the reader progresses, as well as to encourage the reader to ﬁt into the world of the Bible rather than ﬁt the Bible into the reader’s world. See: E. Auerbach, Mimesis: The Representation of Reality in Western Literature, trans. W.R. Trask (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1953), esp. ch. 1, “Odysseus’ Scar”.\n\n18\n\nAbraham in Jewish and Early Christian Literature\n\nresolve to carry out the instruction. Many diﬀerent interpretations of the Akedah have been written that cover whether or not Abraham was being tested, whether he knew God would intervene and not allow Isaac to be killed, as well as discussions on Isaac and Sarah’s role in the narrative.31 For the purposes of my argument, I draw upon it to highlight the disparity between Abraham’s treatment of his sons to reveal how his reputation as a father developed from the texts of Genesis. As noted in Gen. 21:10, Abraham is reluctant to expel his son for fear that he will not survive. In contrast, when God instructs Abraham to kill his remaining son in Genesis 22, Abraham shows no emotion but sets out to commit the act directly by his own hand. Finally, when the traumatic scenes in Genesis 22 culminate in a reprieve from God and a reiteration of the covenantal promises (Gen. 22:11-18), it appears that Abraham and Isaac go their separate ways, never appearing together again in the texts of Genesis from this point forth.32 Viewed through the lens of trauma, it is fair to surmise that such an event would create an irreconcilable rift between father (and would-be killer) and son. For the ancient reader as much as the modern reader of the Genesis texts, Abraham’s inconsistency in the treatment of his sons creates an awkward and unﬂattering image of his foray into fatherhood. From a narratological perspective, there appears to be a lack of emotional bond between father and sons except for the single occasion in Gen. 21:11, which is quickly overridden, and there is no reason to suggest that his identity as father is contingent upon developing a relationship with his progeny.33 This is further emphasized when his third partner\n\n31. For example, see: Blenkinsopp, Abraham: The Story of a Life, in particular ch. 7, “In the Land of Moriah” (140–58 of his book); P. Trible, “Genesis 22: The Sacriﬁce of Sarah”, in Women in the Hebrew Bible: a Reader, ed. A. Bach (New York: Routledge, 1999), 271–90; G.W. Coats, “Abraham’s Sacriﬁce of Faith: A Form-Critical Study of Genesis 22”, Interpretation: A Journal of Bible and Theology 27, no. 4 (1973): 389–400, wherein Coats discusses how the theme of obedience often read into Genesis 22 can be understood as a reaﬃrmation of the covenantal promises through Isaac’s salvation; H. Gossai, Power and Marginality in the Abraham Narrative, 2nd edn. (Eugene, OR: Pickwick Publications, 2010), 102–21. 32. Gen. 22:19: “So Abraham returned to his young men, and they arose and went together to Beer-sheba; and Abraham lived at Beer-sheba” suggests that Isaac did not return with Abraham, nor did he live with him. Similarly when Sarah’s death is announced in Genesis 23, it is only Abraham who goes to mourn for her and attend to her burial; Isaac is missing from the story. 33. However, one could also argue that this claim presupposes an idea of fatherhood which is characterized by emotional connection, and it does not consider other elements such as providing food and income for the family or ensuring the safety of children, etc. I have not deﬁned what I understand fatherhood (or indeed, motherhood) to be, purposefully so that the text might speak for itself with regards to the kind of father Abraham is portrayed to be, from a literary perspective. However, I understand this is a problematic approach as I, a modern reader, can only highlight literary aspects from a modern understanding of fatherhood.\n\nAbraham in the Hebrew Bible\n\n19\n\nKeturah gives birth to six more sons in Gen. 25:1-2, although this could reﬂect what the ancient author thinks is important for the reader to know, rather than presenting the reader with a more complete picture of Abraham as father. Here, the biblical text is no more than a short genealogical note and an explanation that before Abraham died, he “gave all he had” to Isaac, but to the sons of his concubines he gave gifts and sent them away from “his son”, Isaac (Gen. 25:56). It is Ishmael and Isaac who bury Abraham,34 but again the biblical text suggests no emotion connected with the event. To summarize, Abraham’s reputation of “father” is based on confusing interactions with his children, and a diﬃcult relationship which does not appear to be typically that of a father who is good to, or who cares for, his children. This suggests his legacy of father is not about his emotional or physical capabilities, but something else entirely.\n\nMothers in Genesis Of Abraham’s three wives/partners, Sarah is given the most space in the texts of Genesis. This is not particularly surprising given that she experienced the longest relationship with her husband out of the three. We do not know Sarah’s age when she marries Abraham, and though we know she dies at the age of 127, the text is unclear with regards to whether or not Abraham and Sarah still lived together at the point of her death (Gen. 23:1-2). Sarah’s introduction to the reader is as Abraham’s wife, who is infertile (Gen. 11:30). The text does not indicate if she is troubled by her lack of childlessness, nor does it suggest Abraham is particularly concerned either. As previously discussed, some thought is given to the issue in Gen. 16:1-2 when Sarah decides that her slave-girl Hagar could be the one to provide Abraham with an heir, an endeavor which is, as we have seen, not altogether successful in how the situation concludes.35\n\n34. The two sons burying their father is another “matter-of-fact” event, which likely took place because the responsibility and duty to bury one’s family fell on the shoulders of the children. See J.A. Callaway, who discusses burial rituals in relation to family duties in ancient Palestine in more depth: J.A. Callaway, “Burials in Ancient Palestine: From the Stone Age to Abraham”, The Biblical Archaeologist 26, no. 3 (1963): 73–91. One could suggest that by bequeathing all of his possessions to Isaac, Abraham is demonstrating some aﬀection to his favored son; after all, there is some suggestion that inheritance laws in ancient Israel stated that the ﬁrstborn son should legally acquire the estate of their father (see for example: E.W. Davies, “The Inheritance of the Firstborn in Israel and the Ancient Near East”, Journal of Semitic Studies 38, no. 2 (1993): 175–91. Abraham disregards this law by ignoring his ﬁrstborn Ishmael and favoring his second born, Isaac. This is a decision which would normally have been made only if the ﬁrstborn son had “committed a serious oﬀence, usually against his own family” (Davies,“Inheritance of the Firstborn”, 191). See also: Stavrakopoulou, Land of our Fathers, particularly chs 1 and 2.\n\n20\n\nAbraham in Jewish and Early Christian Literature\n\nThe practice of using a slave or servant in place of a woman unable to have children was common practice in ancient Near Eastern laws, as demonstrated by scholars such as J. van Seters and N. Sarna, for example.36 Any resulting children would belong to the slave-owner and though the status of the slave would be elevated if she bore sons (daughters did not achieve the same status), it could just as easily be lowered if the slave started to act as equal to her mistress. In Genesis 16, then, Ishmael would belong to Sarah, and according to those laws she would be his legal mother. The biblical text does not recognize this in any capacity: “Hagar bore Abram a son; and Abram named his son, whom Hagar bore, Ishmael” (Gen. 16:5). Sarah has little to do with this birth or the child, and indeed is not mentioned in association with Ishmael at any point in Genesis, except for when she observes him playing with Isaac (Gen. 21:9). She has no motherly feeling towards him, despite the fact her husband now has a legitimate heir to the covenantal promises. When Sarah gives birth to Isaac, she acts to prevent Ishmael from sharing in any of Abraham’s inheritance by again asking Abraham to cast out Ishmael and his mother.37 Hagar does exhibit emotion toward her son, casting him under a bush because she cannot bear to watch him die (Gen. 21:15-16), and when they are both saved, she continues to care for him and ﬁnds him a wife from her own country (Gen. 21:20-21). Sarah’s experience of mothering Isaac is similarly demonstrative of love, nurture, and emotion. She celebrates with joy, reﬂected in her son’s name, and in disbelief at ﬁnally becoming a mother (Gen. 21:7). She protects Isaac’s future by asking Abraham to cast out Hagar and Ishmael (Gen. 21:10) and God agrees with the matriarch, marking Isaac as the successor to Abraham’s covenant with God. Though no other word is written on Sarah’s relationship with Isaac, these short texts arguably demonstrate a parental connection demonstrably stronger than Abraham’s bond with either of his sons. Keturah is the anomaly in the characterization of mothers; to her, no narrative is given only to say that she was taken as a wife, and she bore Abraham another six sons (Gen. 25:1-2). There is one other short verse which suggests Keturah’s role of parent was more enduring than Abraham’s to their sons: following the end of a short genealogical list, the writer has concluded “All these were the children of Keturah” (Gen. 25:4b). Similarly, in 1 Chron. 1:32 Abraham’s sons by Keturah are\n\n35. Gen. 16:2. J. van Seters has argued that this narrative is not concerned with providing Abraham with an heir, because any child born through a slave belongs to Sarah: “the wife of the patriarch gives her maid to her husband in order that she herself may have children through her maid” (p. 403). Van Seters continues that Abraham’s need for an heir obscures this stipulation, but is clear that the child would not belong to the patriarch. Van Seters, “The Problem of Childlessness”, 401–8. 36. Van Seters, “The Problem of Childlessness”, 403; Sarna, Genesis, 146–7. 37. Sarna suggests Sarah is asking Abraham to grant freedom to Hagar and Ishmael so that they forfeit any right to inherit his estate, a legal clause in the laws of Lipit-Ishtar. Sarna, Genesis, 147.\n\nAbraham in the Hebrew Bible\n\n21\n\ndescribed as “the sons of his concubines” suggesting Keturah was the main parent of her children.\n\nParenting in Genesis Abraham’s actions, emotions, and behavior as a father in the texts of Genesis do not suggest he was regarded as a particularly good, loyal, or responsible father. His reputation in the rest of the Hebrew Bible, as we will see, suggests he is remembered particularly as a model father ﬁgure, regardless of his arguably poor relationships with his own children. There exists, then, a discrepancy between Abraham’s characterization of fatherhood discussed above, and the reputation he develops later. In contrast, narratives of motherhood in Genesis suggest that each of Abraham’s wives/partners are characterized as steady, possibly loving mothers, though they are given far less space in the text which makes it diﬃcult to draw out their characters fully. It follows then, that Abraham is not remembered as a model father because of his actions in life, but because of the legacy given to him through the covenantal promises with God. Likewise, Abraham’s wives/partners were not part of those covenantal promises, and their reputations as good mothers in life are not as important for the future destiny of Abraham’s lands, territories, and descendants.\n\nParenting after Genesis As noted above, Abraham’s name appears only forty-four times outside of the book of Genesis, and the majority of these references are to the patriarchal triad of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. As Römer points out: “the triad is used to characterize YHWH as the ‘God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob (Israel)’”,38 or as an “allusion to the divine land promise” made to Abraham and inherited by the succeeding patriarchs.39 The use of Abraham’s name in Exod. 2:24, for example, creates a connection between the covenantal promises in Genesis, and the plight of the Israelites in Egypt—God remembers the Israelites because of Abraham and his descendants. Similarly, in 1 Kgs. 18:36, the prophet Elijah is the one to remind God of his earlier promises by naming him “God of Abraham, Isaac and Israel”. The invocation of Abraham’s name in these passages serves as a connection between the ancestral father and his millions of descendants, but does not appeal to the fatherliness of Abraham’s character. Römer is among a group of scholars who make the link between Abraham’s memory in the Hebrew Bible and the date of the texts which recall him.40 He\n\n38. Römer, Abraham Traditions in the Book of Genesis, 177. 39. Ibid. 40. Ibid., 159–60, 177; See also H.G. Williamson, “Abraham in Exile”, in Perspectives on Our Father Abraham: Essays in Honor of Marvin R. Wilson, ed. S.A. Hunt (Michigan: Wm. B. Eerdmans, 2010), 68–80.\n\n22\n\nAbraham in Jewish and Early Christian Literature\n\nargues that Abraham’s name appears in biblical texts which can be dated to the exilic period. As such, communities exiled from the land promised to Abraham appealed to God to remember his covenant with their “father” Abraham and restore them to their territories. His name is not recalled as frequently (or at all) in texts written pre- or post-exile, because God had already remembered his people, though there are of course exceptions to this.41 Hugh G. M. Williamson develops this premise noting that it was not only exiled communities who called Abraham’s name in times of need, but also the communities who remained in Judah during the exile who needed “reassurance and reorientation”.42 I will turn now to an examination of these texts to discuss this in more detail. Ezek. 33:24 is potentially attributed to the non-deported Judean population during the exile, and it can be read as either a call upon God to restore their land to the Judean population by expelling the Edomites, who occupied it during the years in exile, or as a message to those in exile that they are not the true heirs of Abraham because they left the land promised to him.43 Clearly, the collective social remembrance of Abraham’s name in this passage is not linked to his fatherhood, but to his claim on the land promised to him by God in Genesis: “Abraham was only one man, yet he got possession of the land” (Ezek. 33:24a). The land is claimed by Abraham, and, as descendants of their patriarch, the Judean population may claim that land in his name. Though there is an indirect reference to Abraham as father through the reminder of the text—that the population in Ezek. 33:24 descends from him—his name is used to reinforce the patriarchal ideology concerning land ownership through patrilineal descent and physical occupation, rather than through descent alone. Hendel calls this a counter memory of Abraham; that is, the recasting of a memory which refutes, revises, or even replaces an accepted memory of the past,\n\n41. Abraham’s name appears in post-Exilic literature, including: 1 Chron. 1:1; 1:27-28; 1:32; 1:34; 16:16; 19:18; 2 Chron. 20:7; 30:6; Neh. 9:7. Examples of pre-Exilic literature include proto-Isa. 29:22 and potentially, Mic. 7:20. 42. Williamson, “Abraham in Exile”, 68. Examples here include: Ezek. 33:24: “Mortal, the inhabitants of these waste places in the land of Israel keep saying, ‘Abraham was only one man, yet he got possession of the land’; but we are many; the land is surely given us to possess.”; Jer. 33:26: “would I reject the oﬀspring of Jacob and of my servant David and not choose any of his descendants as rulers over the oﬀspring of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. For I will restore their fortunes and have mercy upon them.” There is a suggestion that Jer. 33:26 is a late addition to the literature, potentially meaning it is a post-exilic insertion designed to reassure the exilic community by invoking Abraham; and Ps. 105:6: “O oﬀspring of his servant Abraham, children of Jacob his chosen ones”, vv. 8-9: “He is mindful of his covenant forever, of the word that he commanded, for a thousand generations, the covenant that he made with Abraham, his sworn promise to Isaac,” and v. 42: “For he remembered his whole promise, and Abraham, his servant.” 43. Römer, “Abraham Traditions in the Hebrew Bible”, 162–4; Hendel, Remembering Abraham, 42.\n\nAbraham in the Hebrew Bible\n\n23\n\nusually as a means of recasting a memory in light of a new political or social agenda.44 In the case of Ezek. 33:24, the Judeans who remain in the land after the destruction of Jerusalem reconﬁgure their collective memory of Abraham to claim that it is no longer enough to be descended from Abraham’s genealogical line; one must also be resident in the land to be considered a legitimate child of Abraham. There is a similar theme in Jer. 33:26. The motif in this passage is primarily concerned with the restoration of Israel, both physically (i.e. a rebuilding of the city), politically, and religiously.45 In this verse, Abraham’s name is remembered by God, who uses it to remind his exiled people (and arguably, himself), that their destiny is rooted in an ancient covenant that he made between himself and the patriarch.46 C. Lombaard calls the inclusion of Abraham and his succeeding patriarchs in this verse an unexpected occurrence,47 arguing that the text brings together separate but “parallel-running” theological streams, including patriarchal kinship, covenantal promise, the kingship of David, and elements of Creation theology.48 Lombaard suggests that Jer. 33:26 is a late addition to the biblical text, possibly making it post-exilic. If this is the case, then the inclusion of the patriarch in this verse is potentially designed to carry over the covenantal blessings received by Abraham into the kingship of David, and the priesthood.49 Jer. 33:26, then, is not a recollection of Abraham as father, but a counter memory of Abraham as the receiver of a blessing from God, which must be carried over and married into the political state of his descendants in post-exilic Judea. Brueggemann writes that “the oracle appeals to memory and tradition in order to assert a theological reality that overrides present historical circumstance”,50 implying that the tradition of Abraham as father is the key to overcoming the political crisis. Invoking both Abraham and David in the same speech is a powerful political move which speaks to each man’s relationship with God, rather than their status as either father or leader (respectively).51\n\n44.

One might also suggest that Matt. 1:1 invokes the names of both Abraham and David to discuss messianic ideas, again drawing on the special relationship between them and God to highlight themes of the chosen people, rather than drawing on Abraham’s status as father or David’s status as leader.\n\n24\n\nAbraham in Jewish and Early Christian Literature\n\nPsalm 105 does not follow the trend of calling upon the memory of Abraham to reinforce claims on land and covenantal blessings. Marty E. Stevens calls Psalm 105 “the cliﬀ notes of the Torah”, arguing that the psalm is concerned with reciting God’s actions towards his people, including the Abrahamic covenant.52 Ted Hildebrandt notes that it is unique among psalms, being the only one to refer to Abraham directly (as opposed to Psalm 47 which mentions the “God of Abraham” in v. 9).53 A lack of reference to David or Zion is also troubling to Hildebrandt, who argues that the inclusion of Abraham reconnects the people of Israel to the patriarchs during the troubling time of the exilic period. Like those in exile and the disparate few who remained in Judea, the patriarchs were “few in number when they ﬁrst came into the land; they arrived after wandering from one nation to another; and they were protected by God from the kings who already occupied the land.”54 The exiled/remaining communities could identify with parts of Abraham’s history, which oﬀered them hope and reassurance for their uncertain futures. Though Hildebrandt also suggests that Psalm 105 is a reaﬃrmation of the Abrahamic covenant by God (for example, the word “land” is repeated ten times in the psalm,55 calling to mind that element of the promise between Abraham and God), the main assertion is that Abraham was used as a model to help guide the diasporic communities through their exile until they could return to their land. Though still not recalling Abraham’s memory of his fatherhood, Psalm 105 is concerned with reminding God of the covenantal promise of land, but it seems the poet-writer was most concerned with recalling Abraham’s history as a model/ guide for moving forward. Erik Haglund supports this concept, noting that Abraham’s whole history is recalled in Psalm 105, as opposed to just his name. Further, the following themes can be read from the psalm, all of which serve to reinforce the connection between Abraham and land: 1) proclaiming God’s deeds to his people; 2) reﬂections on God’s deeds; 3) memories and traditions of God’s deeds; and 4) a reminder to keep the commandments.56\n\n52.

Ps. 47:9 claims that non-Jewish nobles gather as the God of Abraham’s people. The author did not use Abraham’s name leading up to this, nor did they need to use Abraham’s name in this verse, so one could argue that invoking Abraham’s name here is meaningful, especially in its ethnic implication. 54.

Haglund, Historical Motifs in the Psalms (Coniectanea Biblica, Old Testament Series 23; Uppsala: CWK Gleerup, 1984), 22–3.\n\nAbraham in the Hebrew Bible\n\n25\n\nThe use of Abraham’s name in post-exilic texts is mostly to reinforce and claim covenantal themes of land ownership through patrilineal descent. Abraham as father is a symbolic invocation rather than a genealogical aﬀair.57 Patrilineal descent is most important in these texts, because it establishes the legitimacy of the father and rules out the idea that the child does not belong to the father. Further, matrilineal descent would make the mother too important in the text, potentially de-legitimizing and removing power from the father.58 This androcentric concept is at work in the above texts where Abraham is recalled as symbolic father, but the names of the mothers are not mentioned, expect on two occasions. Sarah is mentioned in Isa. 51:2, and Keturah appears twice in 1 Chron. 1:32-33. In the latter instance, possession of Abraham and Keturah’s children belongs to Keturah as indicated in the language of the texts of Genesis and 1 Chronicles: “All these were the children of Keturah (Gen. 25:4); ‘The sons of Keturah, Abraham’s concubine: she bore Zimran [. . .]’ (1 Chron. 1:32); ‘All these were the descendants of Keturah’ (1 Chron. 1:33).59 The word-choice here indicates to the reader that the children belonged to Keturah which means they are not ‘right’ children—i.e. they are not legitimate because they cannot inherit Abraham’s status as patriarch/become party to the covenantal promises—because Keturah was not the ‘right’ mother; that status belongs to Sarah alone (Gen. 18:1519).60 By aligning the children with Keturah rather than Abraham in this way, there can be no questions raised as to who the true heir of the covenantal promises is. However, the inclusion of Keturah in 1 Chron. 1:32-33 signiﬁes that God has kept the promise of descendants with Abraham. Even though Isaac (born through the “right” mother Sarah) is the only heir, Abraham has other children who will procreate to expand his lineage. Along with Isaac and Ishmael, Keturah and Abraham’s children are evidence that the promise is being delivered upon, but the continued emphasis on Keturah as parent means they cannot interfere with patrilineal claims on land. That part of the promise belongs to Isaac alone. Invocation to Keturah, then, is another way of claiming the covenantal promise by the righteous heir as opposed to the wrong descendants, and links this passage with themes discussed above. Isa. 51:2, which is the only time Sarah is mentioned outside of Genesis in the Hebrew Bible, is unusual when considered against the above passages. Williamson suggests that the purpose of this (potentially)61 post-exilically-authored chapter is\n\n57. One could argue that this idea is represented through the ritual of circumcision which physically marks the male as a descendant of Abraham and an adherent to the covenantal promise of Gen. 17:11, but I would argue it does not necessarily mean the male is biologically descended from Abraham. 58. Exum, Fragmented Women, 84. 59. Emphasis my own. 60. Exum, Fragmented Women, 81–2. 61. Römer rightly suggests there are divergent claims among scholars about whether or not Isa. 51 is a post-exilic text. Römer, “Abraham Traditions in the Hebrew Bible”, 164.\n\n26\n\nAbraham in Jewish and Early Christian Literature\n\nnot concerned with claims to land; rather, it is concerned with the development of the community of Israel.62 Williamson suggests that the restoration of Zion (the people, not the land) and “the formation of the character of the community is also prominent”63 in this text, and that is the reason Abraham and Sarah are remembered. Interestingly, there are also intertextual connections with Ezek. 33:23-24; each of the texts present Abraham as “one” from whom “many” descend. But Römer proposes that Isa. 51:2-3 serves as a correction to Ezek. 33:23-24 in the way it suggests overcoming conﬂict between the remaining Judean population and the exiled communities of the diaspora.64 The solution to the conﬂict lies in developing the community, an action that begins with looking “to Abraham your father and to Sarah who bore you” (Isa. 51:2). The invocation to Sarah in this passage, then, is about reinforcing the idea of the “right” descendants who are born through Sarah’s bloodline because she was the recipient of God’s covenantal promise, and she alone of the mothers can deliver legitimate children.65 True descendants of Abraham must come from Sarah’s lineage as well, and only in that genealogical line can a true community develop and claim the promises granted to them from God.\n\nConclusions In the introduction to this chapter, I argued that Abraham is recalled throughout the Hebrew Bible to reinforce patriarchal ideologies concerning land ownership and patrilineal descent, rather than as a model father ﬁgure, which is what he is most remembered for in the texts of Genesis. I also noted that the lack of references to Abraham’s partners in the Hebrew Bible leads to a quandary for readers of the texts, because the memory of the mothers is so thoroughly erased and subsequently forgotten that it can appear that Abraham’s descendants are “motherless” children. The texts I have discussed above support the idea that Abraham’s name is remembered mostly in connection with claims to the promised land, and the title of father is used to suggest that those claiming the land are descended from Abraham, as his children. Likewise, invocations to the patriarch are concerned with establishing the identity of those who call his name; a signiﬁer that they are the “right” descendants. I have not considered in-depth any texts where God recalls Abraham (such as Exod. 2:24), but there is a general consensus among scholars that these instances are about God reminding himself or his people of the ancient covenant he once made with Abraham. In this respect, Abraham’s name is another way of referring to the covenantal promises made in Genesis, not a remembrance of a father-ﬁgure.\n\n62. Williamson, “Abraham in Exile”, 76. 63. Ibid. 64. Ibid., 167. 65. Exum, Fragmented Women, 81–3.\n\nAbraham in the Hebrew Bible\n\n27\n\nThe connection between Abraham, covenant, and especially land is of primary importance to his descendants who wish to claim the land promised to them; the promise that Abraham will have many descendants is already being fulﬁlled and is of lesser importance than physical space. Claiming this space through Abraham’s name turns his memory into a metaphor for a geographical location, an idea that manifests itself when Jacob is re-named Israel (Gen. 32:28; 35:10) and is remembered dually as Jacob/Israel throughout the Hebrew Bible (e.g. Exod. 32:13). Abraham as metaphor for land does not require the mothers, because it is a conceptual idea created in a community who practiced patrilineal descent, a practice which does not require mothers for anything other than giving birth since the children are traced through the father’s line. However, as we have seen, there is such a thing as a “right” and “wrong” mother, and the reader is alerted to this both through the fact that the mothers of Abraham’s children are mostly erased from the Hebrew texts, and because, when they are recalled, it is with the intention of highlighting the correct and incorrect lineages. The author’s explicit word choices in 1 Chron. 1:32-33, which suggest that Keturah’s children primarily belong to her (i.e. not relating them to Abraham in a clear line) indicate that the sons of Keturah are not true descendants of the covenant because Keturah is not the mother who was part of God’s promise in Gen. 18:10. Sarah received that promise, and only a son born from her can inherit Abraham’s status and promises. Invoking Sarah’s name in Isa. 51:2 alludes to this proper lineage by suggesting descendants born of Abraham and Sarah must remember their history and build their community again post-exile. Thus, the lack of attention paid to the mothers in the Abrahamic narratives impacts how the reader understands the ﬁgure of Abraham-the-father; his name is moved away from concepts of fatherhood and fatherliness, which are attributed to him in Genesis, and instead, it becomes a metaphor for covenantal promises—mostly in terms of land—made to the patriarch all those centuries before.66\n\n66.

Xeravits\n\nThe patriarch Abraham is one of the most pre-eminent ﬁgures of the Old Testament. The “ﬁrst Jew,” beneﬁciary of God’s promises and covenant is an exciting personality already according to the primary epical source where he ﬁrst appears (Genesis). It is no wonder that later biblical texts and the authors of the literature of early Judaism were heavily interested in Abraham, and developed a rich tradition around him.1 This contribution intends to explore texts that belong to a rather artiﬁcial category, the Deuterocanonical books or the Old Testament Apocrypha. These late Second Temple period writings do not appear in the Hebrew Bible, but found their way into the Septuagint and its parent versions.2 The evidence might be categorized into four distinct groups. The only text of the ﬁrst group, Sirach 44:19-21, is a complex unit that draws on various themes. Texts belonging to the second group center on the story of the Akedah, the “binding of Isaac” (Genesis 22). The third category has the common Leitmotif “inheritance of the land,” whereas the fourth group does not have a central unifying theme.\n\n*\n\nThe author is indebted to the editors of the volume for their helpful comments on the ﬁrst draft of this paper. 1.

This book—collecting together rich and multifaceted traditions of early Judaism—was written in Hebrew at the beginning of the second century BCE and was translated into Greek by the author’s grandson in 132 BCE, according to the Prologue of the Greek version.3 The book has two main parts: the ﬁrst is a collection of sapiential sayings (chapters 1–43), while the second is a detailed encomium of the high priest Simeon that evokes many important ﬁgures from Israel’s past (the Praise of the Ancestors, chs 44–50).4 The latter section contains a passage on Abraham.5 Below, I quote the entire passage according to the longer, Greek version6: Abraham was the great father of a multitude of nations, and no one has been found like him in glory. 20 He kept the law of the Most High, and entered into a covenant with him; he certiﬁed the covenant in his ﬂesh, and when he was tested he proved faithful. 21 Therefore He [God] assured him with an oath that the nations would be blessed through his oﬀspring; that he would make him as numerous as the dust of the earth, and exalt his oﬀspring like the stars, and give them an inheritance from sea to sea and from the river to the ends of the earth. This passage alludes to various texts from Genesis.7 The opening title “father of a multitude of nations” (πατὴρ πλήθους ἐθνῶν) is taken from Gen. 17:4, the story of the covenant of circumcision between God and Abraham.

Beentjes, “Ben Sira 44:19-23”, 215-16.\n\nAbraham in the Old Testament Apocrypha\n\n31\n\nappears in the present context of Sirach twice, in cola 44:20bc. Colon 20c continues the allusion to Genesis 17, when speaking about the bodily sign of the covenant (“he certiﬁed the covenant in his ﬂesh,” ἐν σαρκὶ αὐτοῦ ἔστησεν διαθήκην), because this chapter speaks about the circumcision. The more general formulation of 44:20b could refer either to Genesis 17 or to Genesis 15—both chapters deal with the issue of the covenant. The fact that Abraham is called “faithful” (πιστός) in colon 20d might suggest the impact of the latter passage, for the verb “believe” (πιστεύω) is its Leitwort. Colon 20d of this text reminds the reader of the Akedah, when alluding to Abraham’s test (“when he was tested he proved faithful,” ἐν πειρασμῷ εὑρέθη πιστός). The creative combination of elements from Genesis 22 (“during testing,” ἐν πειρασμῷ) and Genesis 15 (“faithful,” πιστός) is worth noting, for this aspect places the Akedah into the perspective of covenant. Ben Sira is thus the ﬁrst witness of a longer interpretative tradition, which will be seen later in this chapter (1 Macc. 2:52), and which occurs also in the New Testament (see Jas. 2:22-24).8 Most of 44:21 alludes to the continuation of the Akedah story, in some cases quoting verbatim Gen. 22:16-18. Gen. 22:16-18 By myself I have sworn, says the Lord: Because you have done this, and have not withheld your son, your only son, [17] I w"
