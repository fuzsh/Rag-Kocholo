        "text": "Bio:\n\nThe great architect, Fatima is an architect working and living in Arizona. Originally from Mexico, where she obtained her professional degree in Architecture from Instituto Tecnologico de Monterrey. She moved to Arizona in 2005 and acquired her Arizona license in 2016. With 15 years of experience, most of them in K-12 projects, she focuses in providing clients and the community with quality spaces that allow for growth, learning and well-being.\n\nHow did you first learn about architecture and when did you decide that built environment profession was an area of interest for you?\n\nI was always in social studies, learn how people feel, react, behave. I liked how architecture can influence people’s well-being.\n\n​\n\nWhat do you do?\n\nK-12 Architectural Project Manager.\n\n​\n\nWhat excites you in the work you do?\n\nAll the unknowns and opportunities each project brings.\n\n​\n\nWho or what inspires you professionally?\n\nThe energy and passion of educators.\n\n​\n\nWhat is your proudest professional accomplishment or achievement?\n\nIt still brings me so much joy to see teachers and students get excited about their new spaces, sometimes to the point of happy tears.\n\n​\n\nFeatured Project Name:\n\nAnna Pavlova under the bridge\n\nFeatured Project Location:\n\nTempe, AZ\n\nFeatured Project Completion Date:\n\n2014 - Unbuilt\n\n​\n\nRole in Featured Project:\n\nDesigner\n\n​\n\nFeatured Project Description:\n\nSubmission to the Imagination Cube competition. Unrealistic concept exploring just one real construction material. We didn’t think about gravity, costs, area, or real life. All with the purpose of exercising the imagination muscles that we sometimes forget when doing real projects on tight deadlines. Through this playful exercise we were hoping to activate thinking outside the box when we went back to dealing with reality.\n\n​\n\nPhotography Credit:\n\nFatima Garcia and Luis Cruz-Martinez\n\n​\n\nFeatured Project Name:\n\nCentral High School\n\nFeatured Project Location:\n\nPhoenix, Arizona\n\nFeatured Project Completion Date:\n\n2019\n\n​\n\nRole in Featured Project:\n\nProject Manager/Architect\n\n​\n\nFeatured Project Description:\n\nCentral High School is located in the hearth of Phoenix, along its main avenue, serving a big and diverse community. The challenging renovation of existing buildings included: Updating the administration building to make it safer for students but accessible and recognizable to the community. Renovating and expanding the existing cafeteria space, adding much needed day-lighting and giving it a college feel. And creating new and modern labs and classrooms for the popular culinary arts program.\n\n​\n\nPhotography Credit:\n\nStefan Yarish"
