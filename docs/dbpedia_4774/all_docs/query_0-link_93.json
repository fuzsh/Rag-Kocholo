        "text": "Deadpool VS Pinkie Pie is the 71st episode and Season 3 Finale of Death Battle, featuring Deadpool from Marvel Comics and Pinkie Pie from the My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic series in a battle between crazy fourth wall breakers. Deadpool was reprised by Curtis Arnott and Pinkie Pie was voiced by Brittany Lauda.\n\nInterlude\n\nWiz: Fiction has a very fragile set of rules. Authors should be wary, as one small crack can be enough to smash the boundary and send their stories careening out of control.\n\nBoomstick: Are we really doing this?\n\nWiz: We're really doing this.\n\nBoomstick: Well, here's Deadpool, Marvel's Merc with a Mouth.\n\nWiz: And Pinkie Pie, Equestria's peppy party pony.\n\nBoomstick: He's Wiz and I'm Boomstick.\n\nWiz: And it's our job to analyze their weapons, armor, and skills to find out who would win... a Death Battle.\n\nDeadpool\n\nWiz: Loneliness. Depression. Cancer. When you think of the Merc with a Mouth, these are unlikely to be the first things you associate with the assassin called Deadpool. Yet, before the red and black suit, these were the ingredients in the life of Wade Wilson.\n\nBoomstick: Blah blah blah, we've been over this before. How about we just skip to the best parts?\n\nDeadpool: Hold up, hold up, hold up! You just can't skip my amazing origin story like that! I have a movie now, so we have all this crispy new footage to use. For educational purposes of course.\n\nBoomstick: Wiz, he's back! Where's my shotgun?\n\nWiz: Just ignore him. In short, Wilson was a mercenary who developed cancer.\n\nDeadpool: I had 34 tumors. They were literally everywhere.\n\nBoomstick: So, the guys who messed with Wolverine picked him up, injected him with weird healing fluids, and turned him into a rotten testicle. Hey, that would've been a much better superhero name for you.\n\nDeadpool: Whatever you say, Captain Bucktooth. You know as well as I do that I'm kind of a big deal, and I've always lived that lit, fresh, mercenary life. (Australian accent) And I even partner up with famous little Wolvie on occasion, (back to his normal voice) like when I worked with the... X-Force.\n\nBoomstick: Where's your mute button?\n\nDeadpool: I probably left it in the Savage Land after my dinosaur rodeo.\n\nBoomstick: The Wh-what?\n\nDeadpool: Oh yeah, check it out, I took a selfie. #nofilter.\n\nBoomstick: Huh, would you look at that.\n\nWiz: Speaking of Wolverine, Deadpool gained a healing factor from those experiments, which easily trumps anything the X-Man can do. He's strong enough to redirect a rogue helicopter, fights faster than a normal man can react, and is an expert marksman with virtually any weapon he touches.\n\nDeadpool: To all my adoring fans out there, you know what I'm all about: swords! I got 'em. They're made of this nano-ceramic fiber, sharp enough to cut through Spidey's webs, and right through his franchise! (laughs) Grenades, shurikens, bolas, and sais; all that good Naruto stuff. I got 'em on deck, baby. Personal fave though, bullets. I spread 'em like Santa spreads Christmas joy!\n\nBoomstick: Are those Heckler & Koch Mark 23 pistols?\n\nDeadpool: Yeah, but they can be whatever you want them to be, baby. (blows a kiss)\n\nBoomstick: Oh right, you got the magic bag with the elephant.\n\nDeadpool: Wait, what're you talking about? What elephant?\n\nWiz: After gaining his enhanced abilities, Deadpool's life only got stranger. He's gone on time-traveling adventures with the mutant Cable, joined the Agent X mercenary force, temporarily gained the Power Cosmic, and even got involved in a love triangle involving Death.\n\nDeadpool: Oh, that whole debacle? Okay, so get this: You know the Grim Reaper, specter of death and all that? Well, turns out she's this sexy hot skeleton babe, and she totally digs the Deadpool, but our Facebook status is still on \"It's complicated\" because I'd have to die to be with her, and then Thanos shows up to try and take her for himself! He cursed me with immortality so I could never see my boo again, but he later took the curse back because he really wanted to kill me, but he can't, because then I'd win and he knows it.\n\nBoomstick: And I thought I had issues.\n\nDeadpool: Sucks to be a galactic lord! Pretty good for a Vancouver Canadian, right?\n\nWiz: Deadpool may be effective as a wisecracking merc, but when he gets serious, he becomes nigh-unstoppable, as far as super-enhanced, cancer-ridden assassins go. He's gone toe-to-toe against Captain America, infiltrated Doctor Doom's country of Latveria, and defeated a horde of 100 ninjas while talking on the phone.\n\nBoomstick: Even if you could top that fighting skill, Deadpool's healing factor puts him on a whole 'nother level. It's let him dive head-first out of a moving plane, survive the friggin' Chrysler Building falling on top of him, stroll right out of nuclear explosions, and even regenerated from being turned into a puddle! Though, that same healing factor is also part of Deadpool's biggest weakness.\n\nDeadpool: Hey, you dissing me, bub?\n\nWiz: No, Boomstick actually has a pretty good point. Years of immortality has let you get away with being sloppy in your approach, which allows a clever enough opponent to gain an upper hand, like this.\n\nA pencil shows up out of nowhere and begins to erase Deadpool.\n\nDeadpool: Hey, w-what, hey, hey, what's that? What're you doing!? No, you monsters! I won't go the way of Amazing Spider-Man!\n\nWiz: Oh, quit whining, you'll be back.\n\nDeadpool: NOOO!\n\nThe pencil finishes erasing Deadpool.\n\nBoomstick: Since when could you do that?\n\nWiz: It's been two years since our last Deadpool episode. I've had plenty of prep time.\n\nPinkie Pie\n\nWiz: The land of Equestria, a magical kingdom full of rolling plains, beautiful mountain ranges, and rainbows. A place where you just can't help but be happy...\n\nWiz: Unless you happen to live on a rock farm.\n\nBoomstick: The hell's a rock farm? Like, a quarry?\n\nWiz: No-no-no. They literally farm rocks. For these ponies, rocks were their life. They harvested rocks, they sculpted rocks, they played with rocks, they built their homes from rocks, they even ate rocks.\n\nBoomstick: Well, one pony on this farm wasn't quite as rock crazy as the rest of her family.\n\nBoomstick: Oh no, she's a whole 'nother level of crazy. This is Pinkamina Diane Pie. Just call her Pinkie Pie.\n\nWiz: One day, chipping away in the grueling rock fields as always, Pinkie witnessed something that would change her life forever.\n\nBoomstick: Colors!\n\nWiz: The very sight of this unprecedented explosion of color, which originated from Rainbow Dash's first legendary Sonic Rainboom, instantly brought Pinkie the most joy she had ever felt in her life. Brimming with happiness, she wanted to share her newfound jubilation with her grim-faced family.\n\nBoomstick: So, she stayed up all night organizing a surprise party. It was so off the chain, that it made them all smile for the first time, which was actually quite horrifying.\n\nWiz: That's when Pinkie finally realized that her life's mission was meant to bring joy to all.\n\nPinkie's cutie mark emerges.\n\nBoomstick: Wait, what's that thing on her butt?\n\nWiz: Oh, that's a cutie mark. Every pony gets one when they discover their calling in life.\n\nBoomstick: Oh, I got one of those! After I found out alcohol and guns were my calling, I woke up and found a beer bottle crossed with two shotguns on my left butt cheek.\n\nWiz: Boomstick, that's a tattoo. You don't remember it because you passed out drunk in the parlor chair.\n\nBoomstick: But booze and weapons do define my life, don't they?\n\nWiz: Well, sure, but...\n\nBoomstick: Then it's fate. Anyway, now that she had something better to do than farm rocks for a living, Pinkie left home and ended up in Ponyville. She landed a job and bed at the Sugarcube Corner bakery and set out to befriend every single pony in town, usually with a welcoming song and dance.\n\nPinkie starts up a music wagon, but instead of welcoming Cranky Doodle Donkey like in the source episode...\n\nPinkie: ♫Welcome, welcome, welcome, a fine welcome to you! Welcome, welcome, welcome, Death Battle, how do you do?♫\n\nBoomstick: Wait, what the- How does it know, Wiz?!\n\nWiz: I guess now's as good a time as any to mention that Pinkie Pie also sees past the fourth wall.\n\nPinkie: Sorry, did I interrupt you guys?\n\nBoomstick: Nah, we were just trying to do a show, but yeah, by all means, tell 'em about yourself while I go grab a beer.\n\nPinkie: Well, I can sing, I can dance, I throw the bestest parties, I can—\n\nBoomstick: No, no, no. (He opens a beer) The awesome stuff! Give 'em something lethal!\n\nPinkie: What? I'd never hurt anyone! Well, unless it's an evil, shapeshifting Changeling. That's why I never leave home without my Party Cannon! Usually, this beauty can set up an entire party in a single shot, but when things get tough, I use it to smother my enemies in bubbles of cake batter. It's my own recipe, wanna try some bubble gum cupcakes? They're fresh and sticky!\n\nBoomstick: Eh, I'm good.\n\nPinkie: Okay. Also, I think one time, my Party Cannon blew up half a building! But that totally wasn't my fault!\n\nWiz: Uh, well, Pinkie Pie's Party Cannon is child's play compared to her own abilities. Her body seems to have highly elastic properties, allowing her to stretch impossible distances, inflate like a balloon, or, more practically, shake off hits powerful enough to send her through walls.\n\nPinkie: Bathtubs ARE dangerous!\n\nBoomstick: On top of all that, her mane can morph into a drill and tunnel through the earth, she's fast enough to keep up with Rainbow Dash, and she can control the very laws of physics!\n\nPinkie slides back up a slide as her friends watch.\n\nFluttershy: So, um, do we walk back up the slide, or-or what?\n\nBoomstick: Even if you think you've got the upper hand on her, she's got her own Pinkie Sense that lets her predict oncoming threats.\n\nPinkie: The twitchin' means my Pinkie Sense is telling me that stuff's gonna start falling. Sometimes it's a bunch of random things happening in my body at random times that supposedly predict the future. I call 'em \"combos\".\n\nWe see Pinkie in disguise as Mare Do Well running through falling debris, with an arrow pointing to her with the words \"Pinkie Pie in disguise\" also being shown on-screen.\n\nBoomstick: Her Pinkie Sense is so precise, she can expertly maneuver through a collapsing skyscraper under construction, while saving four other ponies.\n\nWiz: Pinkie Sense? How about nonsense? None of this is scientifically possible!\n\nPinkie: Sometimes you just have to believe in things, even if you can't figure them out!\n\nWiz: No, I can't do that! Deciphering the impossible is literally what we do here!\n\nBoomstick: What the hell's with all these ponies? Are they all like this? Why?\n\nWiz: Oh, this madness goes even further. Even if you were to somehow damage Pinkie Pie's body, she can just reassemble herself on the spot! And no one can escape her. Not even Rainbow Dash. You know, the pony who can fly over 3,800 miles per hour?\n\nBoomstick: Guess we should all be thankful that she uses these powers for good. With the help of her friends, Pinkie's saved the world several times, like when her group went up against a glowy horse powerful enough to move the Moon.\n\nWiz: Pinkie's spastic demeanor might make her seem like a hapless child, but she's actually pretty smart. She knows the names, birthdays, preferences, and locations of every single citizen of Ponyville by memory. She's so meticulous, she plans things out decades in advance from her secret, party-planning Batcave. She also frequently alters her own personal gravity, without having to affect the world around her. By inexplicably changing physics like this, Pinkie Pie is theoretically capable of, well, just about anything.\n\nBoomstick: Okay, for a peppy pink pony, this filly is actually kinda scary. Only way it could get any worse is if there were a whole army of Pinkie Pies.\n\nPinkie: Heh, funny you should say that.\n\nSeveral Pinkie clones begin to storm the screen.\n\nClones: Fun! Fun! Fun!\n\nBoomstick: No... no no no!\n\nPinkie: I can always use the Mirror Pool. My Nana Pinkie taught me how to use it to duplicate myself over and over and over and—\n\nWiz: Pony! No more, no more, just go back to Ponyville. You'll-you'll be getting a new visitor soon. Very soon! Like, right now soon.\n\nPinkie: (gasps) Really?! Oh my gosh, I can't wait!\n\nShe zooms off.\n\nBoomstick: Well, good thing she's easily distracted. She may be some weird, ultra-powerful cartoon being, but she's anything but a fighter.\n\nWiz: What's more, she can be emotionally fragile at times. If her mood turns negative, she loses her will to do the one thing she loves most: spreading happiness to every pony she meets.\n\nBoomstick: And like it or not, Pinkie WILL spread happiness to you, no matter how hard you struggle.\n\nPinkie: Isn't this exciting? Are you excited? Because I'm excited, I've never been so excited, well, except for the time I went *gasps* but I mean—\n\nPrelude\n\nWiz: Alright, the combatants are set. Let's end this debate once and for all!\n\nBoomstick: IT'S TIME FOR A DEATH BATTLEEE!!!\n\nDeath Battle\n\nOn a bright and sunny day in Ponyville near Sweet Apple Acres, Deadpool suddenly is teleported high above the Everfree Forest.\n\nDeadpool lands hard on the ground and gets up.\n\nDeadpool: Ow, dude!\n\nWade looks around his environment.\n\nDeadpool: Oh, hello again, Death Battle! So, who's the lucky victim?\n\nHe then turns his head to get his answer when he hears a noise.\n\nDeadpool: You cannot be serious right now.\n\nPinkie is strolling happily through the forest and becomes ecstatic when she sees Deadpool. She quickly bolts over to him, which leaves behind a cloud of smoke that leaves Wade coughing. Wade slowly starts backing up when Pinkie starts talking fast.\n\nPinkie: Hi there! I'm Pinkie Pie! I've never seen you before? Are you new? You must be new! Prepare to be welcomed!\n\nDeadpool starts looking around when he hears loud music in the background and Pinkie starts singing the Welcome Song.\n\nPinkie: ♫Welcome, welcome, welc—♫\n\nDeadpool stops her by putting his hand in front of her mouth.\n\nDeadpool: NO! None of that! Shame on you!\n\nPinkie kicks Deadpool upward and sends him back a couple of yards.\n\nPinkie: I'm gonna welcome you, one way or another!\n\nPinkie leaps across the beam separating the two fighter locations and kicks Wade. Deadpool kicks her back to the previous area into a combo with Shoryukens. He kicks her back farther and brings out his guns.\n\nDeadpool: I'm gonna turn ya into glue!\n\nPinkie uses her speed to dodge the bullets and goes behind for a sneak attack, but Wade catches her before she can inflict and damage.\n\nDeadpool: Gotcha!\n\nDeadpool kicks her upward and sends her flying away.\n\nPinkie: I'll be back! Pinkie Promise!\n\nDeadpool: Easy-peasy, lemon-squeezy.\n\nDeadpool then starts feeling the ground shake and an onslaught of \"welcomes.\"\n\nPinkie clones: Welcome!\n\nDeadpool: Oh what the-\n\nDeadpool then notices the rating TV-Y7 in the top right corner.\n\nDeadpool: ...heck.\n\nDeadpool uses his katanas to slice through all of the Pinkie clones. He then reaches out of the video for the YouTube like/dislike bar.\n\nDeadpool: Like Ryan Reynolds' senpai once said, MAXIMUM EFFORT!\n\nHe uses the like bar as a lightsaber and slices through the rest of the Pinkie clones. He then leaps up to attack the real Pinkie.\n\nDeadpool: Ya like this!?\n\nPinkie defends herself by grabbing a YouTube ad of Super Rad Raygun.\n\nDeadpool: We're going viral!\n\nHowever, Deadpool then suddenly stops the fight after seeing Pinkie using the ad as a shield.\n\nDeadpool: Hey wait wait wait wait wait whoa... You see those things, too?\n\nPinkie: Yeah! I mean, usually they're kind of annoying, but...\n\nDeadpool: Say no more, tiny pink horse. On the count of three, say what your favorite food is. One, two three, chimichangas!\n\nPinkie: Cherrychangas!\n\nDeadpool pushes behind the line separating the two in the video.\n\nDeadpool: The heck's a cherrychanga?\n\nPinkie: Only the most delicious, most awesomest thing you've ever tasted! BAM!\n\nPinkie slaps a cherrychanga onto Deadpool's face. Wade is stunned.\n\nDeadpool: It's wonderful...\n\nPinkie: Does this mean we're friends now?\n\nDeadpool shakes the rest of the cherrychanga off of his face and hugs her.\n\nDeadpool: Uh, best friends!\n\nPinkie: Wanna have some fun?\n\nDeadpool: Oh, mercilessly!\n\nDeadpool and Pinkie leap out of the video and onto the row of suggested videos, first entering Batman VS Captain America.\n\nCaptain America gets surrounded by smoke grenades in the alley and throws his shield. A figure that bears a resemblance to Batman holding his shield walks up, but it's actually just a disguised Deadpool.\n\nDeadpool: YAAAHOO!\n\nDeadpool throws Captain America's shield right in the hero's face.\n\nIt then cuts over to the opening of Ken VS Terry. After Terry breakdances to evade Ken's attack, he is surprised by Deadpool and Pinkie.\n\nDeadpool: Oh! Dance off!\n\nThe two start dancing with a beatbox in the background.\n\nPinkie: Yeah! Let's move it! Like that! Yeah!\n\nTerry is too shocked at the moment.\n\nTerry: Get serious!\n\nThe equally disturbed Ken then throws a quick Hadouken that catches Terry by surprise.\n\nIt then cuts to the middle of Amy Rose VS Ramona Flowers. Amy starts breaking the arcade machines when she tries to whack Ramona. The two are stopped by Pinkie's crying.\n\nPinkie: NOO! I was gonna play that one!\n\nDeadpool: C'mon! I've found the jackpot!\n\nOn the YouTube menu, Deadpool points to an episode of the DEATH BATTLE Cast.\n\nDeadpool: Look!\n\nHowever, Pinkie is too distracted looking at the thumbnail for the episode Starscream VS Rainbow Dash.\n\nPinkie: Hi, Rainbow Dash!\n\nDeadpool: No, not that one, that one! Those are the guys responsible for sticking us in these battles in the first place!\n\nPinkie: You mean Wiz and Boomstick?\n\nDeadpool: Oh no, I'm talking even MORE meta. I think it's time we had some REAL fun...\n\nIt then cuts to the middle of the first DEATH BATTLE Cast episode.\n\nChad: And that was the last time I ever made a waffle...\n\nDeadpool and Pinkie crash through the ceiling, startling Ben Singer, Chad James, and Nick Cramer.\n\nPinkie: Ow! My tail!\n\nDeadpool gets up and points at the cast.\n\nDeadpool: You! I finally found you!\n\nHe focuses his attention on Ben...\n\nDeadpool: The idiot with the stupid face...\n\n...then Chad...\n\nDeadpool: ...the idiot with the stupid hair...\n\n...and finally Nick.\n\nDeadpool: ...and the idiot who writes my jokes because he thinks he's funnier than me!\n\nNick: Well, I mean, I did write that one so... it was me.\n\nDeadpool: I just got one question for you all. Just one! Why oh why, would you pull me into another one of these battles... on my birthday! Come on!\n\nPinkie: Wait a minute! You didn't tell me it was your birthday!\n\nPinkie quickly snatches Deadpool away from the cast, leaving The three men confused at what just happened.\n\nChad: What the f—\n\nWe then suddenly cut to Pinkie using her Party Cannon and hosting a birthday party for Deadpool back at Ponyville, with many of its residents and most of the Mane Six (as Rainbow Dash is absent for unknown reasons) attending the celebration.\n\nPonies: Surprise!\n\nDeadpool: Well, so much for the \"Death\" in \"Death Battle\" now, right?\n\nPinkie: Another happy ending!\n\nThe two laugh as the camera fades to black.\n\nResults\n\nBoomstick: What the... WHERE'S THE CARNAGE? What a cop-out!\n\nWiz: I don't... I- I can't... this isn't how it's supposed to be!\n\nBoomstick: I mean, I guess it makes sense when you think about it. Weren't you the one who said breaking the rules would careen out of control or whatever?\n\nWiz: Don't ask me, this wasn't my call.\n\nBoomstick: Sooo... who wins? Who loses?\n\nWiz: Boomstick, I think... the loser is us.\n\nBoomstick: F***ing pony!\n\nTrivia\n\nProduction\n\nThe connections between Deadpool and Pinkie Pie are that they are both fourth wall breakers who have comical and eccentric behaviors while also having opposing natures and target demographics (Deadpool loves violence and is targeted towards mature audiences, while Pinkie is a pacifist who is targeted towards younger audiences).\n\nIn Deadpool 2, which released two years after this episode, Deadpool would directly reference Pinkie Pie by jokingly referring to Yukio as her.\n\nThis is the first episode to implement live-action in a battle. Admittedly, only non-combatants were part of the live-action aspect.\n\nBoth the episode's original and current thumbnails use uncredited fan art of Pinkie Pie (which is an edit of a frame from the start of the My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic episode \"Baby Cakes\") by Ocarina0fTimelord on DeviantArt.\n\nThis makes it the ninth episode where at least one of its thumbnails uses fan art, after Zitz VS Leonardo, Kratos VS Spawn, Bomberman VS Dig Dug, Vegeta VS Shadow, Chun-Li VS Mai Shiranui, Ivy VS Orchid, Fulgore VS Sektor, and Godzilla VS Gamera, and with the next 12 being Lucario VS Renamon, Raven VS Twilight Sparkle, Leon Kennedy VS Frank West, Nightwing VS Daredevil, All Might VS Might Guy, Black Canary VS Sindel, Beerus VS Sailor Galaxia, Blake VS Mikasa, Steven Universe VS Star Butterfly, Sauron VS Lich King, Frieza VS Megatron, and Rick Sanchez VS The Doctor.\n\nEaster Eggs\n\nBoomstick saying \"Are we really doing this?\" during the interlude is a call-back to him saying the same thing in the last episode that featured a My Little Pony character, Starscream VS Rainbow Dash.\n\nBoomstick mentioning Deadpool's \"magic bag with the elephant\" during his analysis is a call-back to his analysis from his previous episode, in which he pulled an elephant out of his Magic Satchel.\n\nWhen Deadpool falls from the sky at the start of the fight, the \"Rero Rero\" sound effect from JoJo's Bizarre Adventure can be heard.\n\nDeadpool berating Pinkie Pie for singing with \"No! None of that! Shame on YOU!\" is a nod towards the Dragon Ball Z Abridged version of Bardock: Father of Goku where Bardock, who is also voiced by Curtis Arnott, admonishes a race of aliens who tries to praise him by singing the song \"Welcome Christmas\" from How the Grinch Stole Christmas.\n\nDeadpool's quote to Pinkie \"I'm gonna turn ya into glue!\" is a reference to how glue is made from various parts of horses.\n\nA similar joke would return years later in Bill Cipher VS Discord.\n\nBatman VS Captain America, Ken VS Terry, and Amy Rose VS Ramona Flowers were all visited and altered by Deadpool and Pinkie Pie when the two were traveling through previous episodes.\n\nDeadpool calling Ben Singer \"The idiot with the stupid face\" might be a reference to Takahata101's DEATH BATTLE Debate, where Deadpool's voice actor, Takahata101, keeps saying Ben's face is dumb.\n\nThis fight features the third-highest number of cameos in a single episode, with a total of 49 characters appearing throughout it, only behind Bill Cipher VS Discord's 54 cameos and Rick Sanchez VS The Doctor's 61 cameos. These cameos are as follows:\n\nVia appearing in the main fight itself: the main protagonist of Super Rad Raygun, Rarity, Applejack, Twilight Sparkle, Fluttershy, Angel, and Derpy Hooves.\n\nVia intrusion into other episodes: Captain America, Sakura Kasugano, Sean, Blanka, Dan Hibiki, Terry Bogard, Ken Masters, Amy Rose, and Ramona Flowers.\n\nVia intrusion into YouTube: Batman, Doomsday, Doctor Strange, The Hulk, The Meta, Agent Carolina, Starscream, and Rainbow Dash.\n\nVia intrusion into DEATH BATTLE Cast: Nick Cramer, Chad James, Ben Singer, Son Goku, Superman, Master Chief, Knuckles the Echidna, Luigi, Korosensei, Ezio Auditore da Firenze, a Facehugger, Cyclops, Jean Grey, Beast, Havok, Iceman, Professor X, Colossus, Storm, Nightcrawler, Banshee, Wolverine, Iron Man, Levi Ackerman, and a Creeper.\n\nErrors\n\nIn Deadpool's \"Background\" slide, \"every\" was misspelled as \"ever\", though this error has since been fixed.\n\nOther\n\nThis is the fifth Marvel VS non-DC-themed episode, after Thor VS Raiden, Beast VS Goliath, Darth Vader VS Doctor Doom, and Wolverine VS Raiden, and with the next 15 being Android 18 VS Captain Marvel, Shredder VS Silver Samurai, Carnage VS Lucy, Ultron VS Sigma, Black Widow VS Widowmaker, Deadpool VS Mask, Genos VS War Machine, Venom VS Crona, Hulk VS Broly, Iron Fist VS Po, Korra VS Storm, Thor VS Vegeta, Magneto VS Tetsuo, Stitch VS Rocket Raccoon, and Galactus VS Unicron.\n\nThis is the 11th Male VS Female-themed episode, after Boba Fett VS Samus Aran (2010), Yoshi VS Riptor, Justin Bieber VS Rebecca Black, Starscream VS Rainbow Dash, Gaara VS Toph, Boba Fett VS Samus Aran (2015), Dante VS Bayonetta, Meta VS Carolina, Tracer VS Scout, and Zoro VS Erza, and with the next 14 being Lara Croft VS Nathan Drake, Thor VS Wonder Woman, Carnage VS Lucy, Captain Marvel VS Shazam, Dragonzord VS Mechagodzilla, Mob VS Tatsumaki, Gray VS Esdeath, Beerus VS Sailor Galaxia, The Seven Battle Royale, Red VS Blue, Shadow VS Ryuko, Steven Universe VS Star Butterfly, Killua VS Misaka, and Gojo VS Makima.\n\nThis is the second time the fight ends in a draw, after Justin Bieber VS Rebecca Black.\n\nThis is the seventh episode to feature a returning combatant, after Zitz VS Leonardo, Batman VS Captain America, Boba Fett VS Samus Aran (2015), Goku VS Superman 2, Pokémon VS Digimon, and Mewtwo VS Shadow, and with the next 26 being Metal Sonic VS Zero, Thor VS Wonder Woman, Black Panther VS Batman, Ryu VS Jin, Mario VS Sonic (2018), Mega Man Battle Royale, Captain Marvel VS Shazam, Dragonzord VS Mechagodzilla, Ganondorf VS Dracula, Deadpool VS Mask, Leonardo VS Red Ranger Jason, She-Ra VS Wonder Woman, Venom VS Crona, Hulk VS Broly, Shadow VS Ryuko, Lex Luthor VS Doctor Doom, Link VS Cloud (2021), Batman VS Iron Man, Akuma VS Shao Kahn, Thor VS Vegeta, Boba Fett VS Predator, Excalibur VS Raiden, Darth Vader VS Obito Uchiha, Phoenix VS Raven, Guts VS Dimitri, and Goku VS Superman (2023).\n\nThis is the second Season Finale to feature a returning combatant, after Pokémon VS Digimon, and with the next one being Hulk VS Broly.\n\nThis is the fourth episode to feature a returning winner, after Zitz VS Leonardo, Boba Fett VS Samus Aran (2015), and Goku VS Superman 2, and with the next 18 being Metal Sonic VS Zero, Thor VS Wonder Woman, Black Panther VS Batman, Mario VS Sonic (2018), Ganondorf VS Dracula, Deadpool VS Mask, Leonardo VS Red Ranger Jason, She-Ra VS Wonder Woman, Venom VS Crona, Lex Luthor VS Doctor Doom, Link VS Cloud (2021), Batman VS Iron Man, Akuma VS Shao Kahn, Thor VS Vegeta, Excalibur VS Raiden, Phoenix VS Raven, Guts VS Dimitri, and Goku VS Superman (2023).\n\nThis is the fourth Comic Book VS Cartoon-themed episode, after Starscream VS Rainbow Dash, He-Man VS Lion-O, and Beast VS Goliath, and with the next 10 being Shredder VS Silver Samurai, Batman Beyond VS Spider-Man 2099, Raven VS Twilight Sparkle, Ben 10 VS Green Lantern, She-Ra VS Wonder Woman, Iron Fist VS Po, Korra VS Storm, Saitama VS Popeye, Stitch VS Rocket Raccoon, and Galactus VS Unicron.\n\nThis is the sixth Joke episode, after Goomba VS Koopa, Justin Bieber VS Rebecca Black, Starscream VS Rainbow Dash, Chuck Norris VS Segata Sanshiro, and Hercule Satan VS Dan Hibiki, and with the next four being Smokey Bear VS McGruff the Crime Dog, Deadpool VS Mask, Macho Man VS Kool-Aid Man, and SpongeBob VS Aquaman.\n\nThis is the third episode to not have Boomstick make an ending pun, after Eggman VS Wily and Goku VS Superman 2, and with the next two being Miles Morales VS Static and Macho Man VS Kool-Aid Man.\n\nThis is is the fourth episode to end in a draw, after Goomba VS Koopa, Justin Bieber VS Rebecca Black, and Chuck Norris VS Segata Sanshiro, and with the next one being Scooby-Doo VS Courage the Cowardly Dog.\n\nThis is the second episode where neither of the main combatants die, after Chuck Norris VS Segata Sanshiro, and with the next one being Scooby-Doo VS Courage the Cowardly Dog."
