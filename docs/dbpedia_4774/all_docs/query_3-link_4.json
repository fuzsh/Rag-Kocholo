        "text": "Bio:\n\nThe great designer, Luis Cruz-Martinez is an architect living in Arizona. He often collaborates with Fatima Garcia on personal projects. Luis is from Puerto Rico. He graduated from the University of Puerto Rico and got his masters from ASU in 2002. He obtained his Arizona license in 2009.\n\n​\n\nHow did you first learn about architecture and when did you decide that built environment profession was an area of interest for you?\n\nI had a high school friend that attended architecture school. It became a passion the first day of school.\n\n​\n\nWhat do you do?\n\nProject Architect and Puzzle Solver\n\n​\n\nWhat excites you in the work you do?\n\nFiguring out how things work.\n\n​\n\nWho or what inspires you professionally?\n\nThe human beings I get to work with and provide services to.\n\n​\n\nWhat is your proudest professional accomplishment or achievement?\n\nFinding one of a possibility of solutions to a seemingly unsolvable problem.\n\n​\n\nFeatured Project Name:\n\nAnna Pavlova under the bridge\n\nFeatured Project Location:\n\nTempe, AZ\n\nFeatured Project Completion Date:\n\n2014 - Unbuilt\n\n​\n\nRole in Featured Project:\n\nDesigner\n\n​\n\nFeatured Project Description:\n\nSubmission to the Imagination Cube competition. Unrealistic concept exploring just one real construction material. We didn’t think about gravity, costs, area, or real life. All with the purpose of exercising the imagination muscles that we sometimes forget when doing real projects on tight deadlines. Through this playful exercise we were hoping to activate thinking outside the box when we went back to dealing with reality.\n\n​\n\nPhotography Credit:\n\nFatima Garcia and Luis Cruz-Martinez"
