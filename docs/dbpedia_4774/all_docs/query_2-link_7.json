        "text": "If you're using nearest-neighbor filtering (glTexParameter(GL_TEXTURE_2D, GL_TEXTURE_MIN_FILTER, GL_NEAREST), this is the result of that. Because of the way vertices are transformed, sometimes this results in a texture lookup one pixel outside of the tile you want.\n\nThe solution is fairly simple, just take all your texture coordinates and move them into the tile by the size of half a pixel, i. e. (1.0f / width) * 0.5f. This guarantees that a pixel's nearest neighbor on the texture is never outside the tile you want it to be."
