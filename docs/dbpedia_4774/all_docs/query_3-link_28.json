His farming background and youth ham radio hobby heavily influenced his career in engineering. He earned his State Farmer degree (Minnesota) with the FFA organization. In the world of radio he received the extra class amateur license (AC0P) and a first-class radiotelephone commercial license. He joined the research and development laboratories of Hewlett Packard (HP) in Santa Rosa, CA in 1982. 1980‘s project development activities included spectrum analyzer and vector network analyzer electronic measurement instrumentation. His Ph.D. work (1988-1992) involved design, fabrication and test of single-chip pulsed semiconductor lasers for data communication applications. Dr. Derickson managed multiple project teams at HP for high-speed communication test systems in the 1990s. He moved into the director of product marketing role at a start-up company called Cierra Photonics in Santa Rosa, CA in 2000. After 21 years in industry, he joined the Electrical Engineering Department at California Polytechnic State University in 2005. He served as department chair from 2010 to 2020. Research activities have focused on applications of semiconductor lasers, wireless communication systems, and rf/microwave/mm-wave electronics. He is the editor of two books; Fiber Optics Test and Measurement (1997) and Digital Communication Test and Measurement (2008). With many collaborators he has created 90 publications and 7 patents. He is a founding member of the company Insight Photonics Solutions that is commercializing research initiated at Cal Poly (http://www.sweptlaser.com/). His outreach activities have focused on creating and running summer science camps for Jr. High and Sr. High groups at Cal Poly and through the California 4H Youth Development Program. His current activities include Industry/Alumni research partnerships, entrepreneurship, enabling a project-rich hands-on environment for diverse students, and supporting a strong graduate research program. Dr. Derickson is a Professional Engineer in the State of California and enjoys helping others with his expertise.\n\nHere is an example project that students created in my communication systems lab:\n\nThis is an IQ modulator designed by students in my EE456 Class (Digital Communications). With this modulator, one can generate a wide range of digital communication signals by designing the input waveform to the I and Q ports of the modulator.\n\nSynopsys Hilbert Optical Design Competition winners (June 2022 and June 2023)\n\nI am so proud of the Cal Poly EE students who were winners of the Hilbert Optical Design Competition for June 2022 and June 2023 .

I will be helping with judging the student paper contest. I will also be organizing the Amateur Radio Reception at the Conference. If you want to help with the Amateur Radio reception, please send me an email at ddericks@calpoly.edu.\n\nProject OWL Collaboration 2023-2024;\n\nI have been collaborating with the company project owl in 2022-2024. Here is a link to their web site. https://www.project-owl.com/. I have an STTR grant with Professor Dunton that runs from Sept 2023 to March 2024. We are creating an open source mesh sensor network. Activities including new hardware/software design and and a space sensor program. Here is a link to last years project highlights. We will be doing balloon launches again in June 2024 of our latest prototypes.\n\nhttps://ceng.calpoly.edu/connection/2023/07/student-research-reaching-new-heights/\n\n2023 International Microwave Symposium Student Design Competition - Third Place in power amplifier category.
