        "text": "Parametric design, algorithmic/generative design...are only some of the keywords of a work paradigm that is becoming more and more popular, designed to respond to the complexities of Heritage. The work deepens a research strarted in 2018 with the master's thesis of one of the author, part of which was published already in 2020 [1], and now, is being expanded to issues of contemporary times. Most commonly, such an approach is used for new buildings, but when algorithmic design meets heritage building information modeling (HBIM), the process can take on an even greater centrality—flexibility and control go hand-in-hand, ensuring precious tools for the planning of restoration interventions and management projects. This contribution, oriented to expand the use of these strategies to heritage, deals with the theme of parametric modeling of masonry vaults, a structural–architectural feature that in many forms and combinations characterizes most historic buildings. In particular, the connection of BIM software with algorithmic modeling software can allow the ‘translation’ of complex geometric shapes into elements with full Level of Detail elements (LOD 500) while preserving, at the same time, the algorithmic editing functions. In this paper, it is illustrated as this approach permits the fine-tuning of the vaults’ details, from time to time, based on different survey strategies (e.g., direct measurements, experimental tests, laser scanners, etc.). In other words, using this new connection in real time, architects can design restoration interventions tied to shapes, geometries, and masonry peculiarities that would otherwise be impossible to manage. An updatable virtualization of the actual state of a heritage building thus becomes affordable for the wider public (LOD G). There is also a valuable benefit for the heritage stakeholders in terms of protection of the architectural value and conscious planning in the restoration practice, especially in the museum field.

To counteract the process of disintegration, the departments of geo-information and lower monument protection authority of the City of Nuremburg decided to getting done a three dimensional building model of the Church of St. Catherine’s. A heterogeneous set of data was used for preparation of a parametric architectural model. In effect the modeling of historic buildings can profit from the so called BIM method (Building Information Modeling), as the necessary structuring of the basic data renders it into very sustainable information. The resulting model is perfectly suited to deliver a vivid impression of the interior and exterior of this former mendicant orders’ church to present observers.\n\nOver the last decade, economic, financial and social issues have undermined the construction industry, leading to a worldwide crisis. Restoration and energetic rehabilitation have become increasingly more common within the construction industry. Notwithstanding the fact that it has a significant architectural heritage, Italy has proven not to be ready to face demanding projects regarding the rehabilitation of historical buildings. Therefore, numerous construction companies have missed out an important source of income and have left EU Structural and Investment Funds untouched. The reasons for these Italian problems include: the lack of long term programming; shortage of quality control systems as well as the lack of team work. The aim of this paper is to show that the use of BIM – Building Information Modeling – can solve many of the aforementioned problems connected to rehabilitation projects. In fact, the efficiency and benefits of this kind of approach towards the analysis, manag...\n\nThe validation processes of restoration projects in all institutions are still based on communication and training requisites which continue to influence choices during the preparation of projects, and not only in purely formal terms, but also with respect to content. These requisites are paper documents and digital media, i.e. reproductions of paper documents in PDF format. Furthermore, project representation and communication are substantially established in two-dimensional form (plans, elevations, sections) with rare inroads into three-dimensional formats for explicative and integrative purposes (axonometric and/or perspective images), with the usual separateness, which is also logical and conceptual, between graphic representation and documentation, during the surveying and analysis phase and during the design phase. Even considering recent experiences related to the management of the reconstruction phase in the historical centres affected by the earthquake in L'Aquila on 6 April 2009, the intrinsic possibilities of using of architectural 3D modelling is to be examined, with the purpose of building an information system dedicated to architectural specificities, and to building the project proposal, fully directing its communicative complexity to the synthetic and interactive support of 3D modelling.\n\nThe Maritime Theatre is one of the iconic buildings of Hadrian's Villa, Tivoli. The state of conservation of the theatre is not only the result of weathering over time, but also due to restoration work carried out during the Fifties of the past century. Although this anastylosis process had the virtue of partially restoring a few of the fragments of the compound's original image, it now reveals diverse inconsistencies and genuine errors in the reassembling of the fragments. This study aims at carrying out a digital reinterpretation of the restoration of the architectural fragments in relation to the architectural order, with particular reference to the miscellaneous decoration of the frieze of the Teatro Marittimo (vestibule and atrium). Over the course of the last few years the Teatro Marittimo has been the target of numerous surveying campaigns using digital methodology (laser scanner and photogrammetry SfM/MVS). Starting with the study of the remains of the opus caementicium on the ground, it is possible to identify surfaces which are then used in the model for subsequent cross sections, so as to achieve the best fitting circumferences to use as reference points to put the fragments back into place.\n\nThe different technical and legal tools intended for heritage protection have introduced the novel possibility of enjoying important monumental complexes. The divergence lies in the artistic contexts in which, due to the genesis of their programmatic typology, they require residential uses, as is the case of monasteries. This article collects the results of a long-span research, whose main objective has been to find a tool that could allow us to measure different indicators on a continuous basis in which both the protection of the elements, and the capacity for habitation, are safeguarded. To this aim we have set in context the research at the Monastery of Santa Clara de la Columna in Belalcázar (Córdoba), a location with the highest possible heritage protection of Spanish ranking which, in turn, accommodates a religious community. The results have allowed us to design innovative parameters for habitation, within a protected and endangered heritage context."
