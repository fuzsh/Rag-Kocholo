        "text": "There are a lot of great romantic movies out there—ones that sweep you off your feet and give you unrealistic expectations about love. And a lot of those romance movies have pretty sexy kisses in them, but sexy love scenes are a bit more rare. Don’t get me wrong, there are a lot of sex scenes in Hollywood, but a good, hot, sexual love scene in a romantic movie can be harder to pin down.\n\nA good romantic movie sex scene requires four things: stars with chemistry, a sexy soundtrack, maybe some skin, and real emotional buildup and investment in the love story. It can’t be sex just for sex’s sake (no shade to the porn-adjacent Netflix movies, but 365 DNI isn't exactly what I call romance). The best romantic sex scenes in movies are the ones with emotional weight. And if they also happen to be smokin’ hot and chill-inducing, then that’s even better! It took some digging, but after a lengthy research process (aka being a romance movie addict for over two decades), I have found the 47 best sexual love scenes in movie history. You're welcome.\n\n1. Lust, Caution\n\nBelieve me when I say that this romantic spy drama from director Ang Lee truly earned its NC-17 rating. The film is about a young revolutionary student in the late ‘30s, Wang Jiazhi (Tang Wei), who is tasked with getting close to Mr. Yee (Tony Leung), a political operative, to assassinate him. In the process, lines are blurred, an affair blossoms, loyalties are tested, and ridiculously hot sex is had.\n\n2. Blue Valentine\n\nIf you prefer your romances with a happy ending, I wouldn’t recommend Blue Valentine. That said, if you’re more in it for the journey, the film is an absolute must-watch for any fan of the genre. The movie stars Michelle Williams and Ryan Gosling and follows them as they go from young lovers to bitter husband and wife. And though not all sex scenes are romantic, the scenes that take place in the early days of their relationship definitely are. And, yeah, they’re pretty racy, too. In fact, one particular sex scene involving oral sex caused a bit of drama after the MPAA initially gave it an NC-17 rating, which would have severely limited its box office potential. Producers appealed the decision, and eventually, the movie was released with an R-rating.\n\n3. Mississippi Masala\n\nMississippi Masala isn’t especially explicit—there’s very little nudity and not a lot of sex scenes—but it contains what is quite possibly one of the best phone sex scenes of all time. Need more convincing? The movie stars Denzel Washington and Sarita Choudhury, making it one of Washington’s only romantic leading roles and a rare film about interracial romance that doesn’t have a white lead, and it explores the biases among communities of color while also giving audiences one of the best on-screen romances in recent memory.\n\n4. Secretary\n\nBefore 50 Shades, there was this. It's not the most accurate portrayal of BDSM, but it is a very hot story between an attorney (James Spader) who acts out his fetishes with his more-than-willing secretary (Maggie Gyllenhaal). Their dom-sub relationship is both intense and off-the-charts hot.\n\n5. Bound\n\nThe Wachowski sisters know how to shoot a love scene (*fans self*). Even though this film was released over 25 years ago, they also knew to have an intimacy coordinator on set—we love to see it. Also, they somehow created a love story about two women trying to outsmart the mob, and wow does it work.\n\n6. Atonement\n\nFor this one, I have only three words: Me and who? Okay, actually, three more words: *That* green dress. (Also, for any literary buffs out there, this scene is equally as hot in the book, just saying.)\n\n7. Carol\n\nTwo women fall for each other—in the '50s, when it's not really safe for them to be out—and begin to conduct an illicit affair. When they finally give into their mutual passion and get together on a road trip, it's quiet and tender, but the release of all that tension is still increeeeedibly hot.\n\n8. 9 ½ Weeks\n\nYou might call 9 1/2 Weeks the 50 Shades of the ’80s, by which I mean it was the shockingly sexy, erotic romance of the day that everyone was talking about. For the uninitiated, Kim Basinger and Mickey Rourke's characters share a whirlwind romance for, you guessed it, 9 1/2 weeks. In the process, they engage in all kinds of kinky (and now-iconic) sex scenes, including a certain ice cube moment.\n\n9. Damage\n\nA very hot, very forbidden love affair blooms between a sexy, silver foxy member of British Parliament and, wait for it, his son’s fianceé. Cue: lots and lots of illicit, emotionally charged intimacy between two star-crossed, age-gap lovers. We love the drama.\n\n10. The Lucky One\n\nLook, shower sex in real life is…logistically complicated and often low-key disappointing. Shower sex (outdoor shower sex, no less!) with Zach Efron in a Nicholas Sparks movie on the other hand? Effortlessly hot. Sweepingly romantic. No notes.\n\n11. Sharp Stick\n\nA 26-year-old woman loses her virginity to her married employer in this very sexy, very messy, very Lena Dunham dramedy that is brimming with surprisingly intimate, tender love scenes. Tip: Keep you eyes peeled for the necklace scene—it is everythinggg.\n\n12. Elisa & Marcela\n\nSpeaking of period romances (there are a bunch on this list, I regret nothing), the first (technically illegal) same-sex matrimony in Spain is imagined as the most epic love story of all time. Elisa poses as a man so she can be with her one true love Marcela, and the lengths they go to are impressively romantic. Their first hook up will leave you speechless, tbh.\n\nWatch Now\n\n13. Premature\n\nAh, summer love. This movie has a bunch of weepy stuff, but! It also has a ton of sexy sex scenes between two people falling in love. Just wait until you get to the rooftop scene—trust me on this, ok? The whole thing's so vulnerable and raw that it feels almost voyeuristic, in the best way.\n\n14. Mulholland Dr.\n\nThis trippy, dreamy movie is kinda difficult to explain—just know that it's (sort of) about a woman who loses her memory and another woman tries to help her figure out what happened. Also, it's not at all about that, but the point is that, along the way, the two women explore their intense attraction to incredibly sexy effect.\n\n15. Y Tu Mama Tambien\n\nRoad trips are sexy, apparently, because this is another film on the list with travel-based sexytimes. This one is frank and open around sex between its main characters (played by the incredibly sexy Maribel Verdu, Gael Garcia Bernal, and Diego Luna) and at its climax is an adorable exploration of sexuality between two BFFs who thought they were platonic. And are absolutely not!\n\n16. Portrait of a Lady on Fire\n\nHello, yes, another sexy period movie! A woman is tasked with painting another woman's portrait—who won't sit for it because she doesn't want to consent to the arranged marriage that will follow. Why is that, you ask? Well, the two women meet and immediately have the hottest chemistry ever. When they finally kiss (and every scene after that), it's an incredible release of tension and attraction.\n\n17. Anna Karenina\n\nTurns out period dramas can be sexy, y'all. Technically, this one's v depressing, but it all centers around a married woman (Keira Knightley) trying and absolutely failing to resist a young officer (Aaron Taylor-Johnson). When they finally just say f*ck it and blow up their lives, it's illicit and so hot.\n\n18. House of Gucci\n\nIt's no secret that Adam Driver and Lady Gaga freaking went for it in this one. Their House of Gucci sex scene is knock-down-drag-out passion at some of its most intense. There's sex on a table, slamming into walls, and uh, guttural animal noises. It is, in a word, a lot!\n\n19. Beyond the Lights\n\nA young artist hires a police officer to protect her from the paparazzi. I don't need to tell you anything more; Seriously, just go watch. Gugu Mbatha-Raw and Nate Parker just have the most OTT chemistry on Earth. Two words: Plane sex. Two more words: Yes pls.\n\n20. Crimson Peak\n\nOh hey, Tom Hiddleston! This is technically a horror film about a man who marries a woman (Mia Wasikowska) with nefarious purposes in mind (and also his creepy sister (Jessica Chastain) is in the mix, no biggie). However! This sex scene between the newlyweds is also an exploration of her pleasure and consent—and there's nothing hotter than that.\n\nWatch Now\n\n21. The Handmaiden\n\nThis period thriller has about a million twists and turns. But also, it's a v horny love story between two women. What are their intentions for each other? Unclear—just watch, because the surprises are worth it. Oh, and the sex scenes will take your breath away.\n\n22. Broken Embraces\n\nThis thriller is...rlly intense, ngl. It centers around a love triangle between two colleagues and friends in love with the same woman (Penelope Cruz). When Mateo (Lluís Homar) and Lena decide to secretly get together, in spite of Lena's abusive relationship with Ernesto (José Luis Gómez), their passion is enthusiastic. Like, six times a day enthusiastic.\n\n23. Ride or Die\n\nTwo women are friends (kinda...) with lots of unspoken longing. One of them kind of jokingly suggests they could get her abusive husband out of the way if her friend kills him. Friend legit takes her up on the offer. They go on the run. You have to wait a while, but when the two (spoiler) consummate their relationship, it's everything.\n\nWatch Now\n\n24. Brokeback Mountain\n\nI mean, you probably know about this groundbreaking movie, but if you haven't watched it lately, you should. The late Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal are perfectly cast as two cowboys who can't be apart (as we find out in this hot scene) but also can't be together. Their love scenes have so much longing, it'll break your heart.\n\n25. Troy\n\nHi, Brad Pitt's butt, so great to see you! This long Trojan War epic (which has a lot of fighting and political intrigue, FYI) also contains one of Brad Pitt's hottest scenes ever when Priestess Briseis (Rose Byrne) attempts to kill Achilles (Pitt), and then the two start to have incredibly passionate sex—as you do.\n\n26. 8 Mile\n\nOkay, is the sex scene in 8 Mile more of a raunchy quickie than an act of impassioned lovemaking? Yes. But you can see in Eminem's eyes that he's already head over heels for Brittany Murphy's character. Like, he clearly has a crush, and it's as adorable as it is hot.\n\n27. Love & Basketball\n\nAh, the classic. This whole movie is built on the \"will they won't they\" tension between childhood BFFs and basketball players Monica (Sanaa Lathan) and Quincy (Omar Epps). The ~first time~ they explore their connection, it's as hot and respectful as you dreamed it would be.\n\n28. Before Sunrise\n\nTwo strangers meet and have an unbelievably intense connection—which the film explores in real time. Part of the appeal of this movie (and the ones following it) is the banter between the two. Here, where they discuss whether they should hook up, and then do, is the perfect example of why there are two more movies about the couple.\n\n29. Don Jon\n\nThere are a bunch of sex scenes in this, but the point of the film is sex addiction—Don Jon (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) can't stop watching p*rn (including in class). But his connection to a fellow student (Julianne Moore), who teaches him a thing or two about real intimacy, leads to an incredibly hot and tender moment.\n\n30. Disobedience\n\nA woman (Rachel Weisz) comes back to the Orthodox Jewish community that shunned her after her father dies. The childhood friend she loved (Rachel McAdams) is still in the community and married to a man...but the two women can't deny what they still have. You can guess what happens (see above).\n\n31. My Beautiful Laundrette\n\nThink of this as sort of a forbidden love, Romeo and Juliet story (or, rather, Romeo and Romeo) between a street punk and a young Pakistani man. You'll be surprised by how tender and loving the sex scenes are—and that the movie actually ends on a happier note than you expect. Oh, and a muscular Daniel Day-Lewis is...incredibly hot.\n\n32. The Notebook\n\nEveryone involved in the making of this sex scene knew exactly what they were doing. Right before we get into the act featuring a wet, shirtless Ryan Gosling, we get a deeply romantic revelation in the pouring rain that ends with these iconic lines: “I wrote you 365 letters. I wrote you every day for a year. It wasn't over. It still isn't over.” I mean, how can you hear that and not want to rip their clothes off?\n\n33. Jason’s Lyric\n\nAfter going on a lovely boat ride, Jason (Allen Payne) and Lyric (Jada Pinkett Smith) have sex in a stunning field of flowers, as you do. What’s more romantic than showing your affection in an idyllic and empty public place? The next time a man wants to give me flowers, I’ll be suggesting we do this instead and take some unsquashed flowers to go.\n\n34. Out of Sight\n\nJ.Lo and George Clooney’s flirty dialogue paired with snowfall in the background and edited over their strip tease sex scene makes this sequence worthy of a reenactment. It truly has it all, and comes off sophisticated yet fun.\n\n35. Dirty Dancing\n\nThere’s no denying Baby and Johnny’s love story is one for the ages. Their super sensual love scene starts off with confessions, then moves into passionate dancing, of course, and then ends with sex.\n\n36. Below Her Mouth\n\nLooking for a movie with more than one super hot and romantic sex scene? This film can provide you with that. It follows a woman who is engaged to a straight man, but finds herself in an all-consuming affair with a woman who she can’t get out of her head.\n\n37. Fifty Shades Freed\n\nObviously, every movie in this series has many hot sex scenes. But in the third installment, Anastasia and Christian have solidified their romantic relationship with marriage, which makes this steamy ice cream scene both hot and super romantic.\n\n38. Pretty Woman\n\nWhat’s hotter than sex on a piano in a public restaurant? Staring into each other’s eyes before getting into it. The intensity of Edward and Vivian's looks takes the scene from risqué to deeply romantic. Talk about tickling the ivories (I'll see myself out).\n\n39. Ghost\n\nPottery-making innately looks like a sexual act, objectively speaking, but Demi Moore and Patrick Swayze really make it look like a romantic activity that will get you all hot and bothered in this Ghost scene. It’s worth noting, though, that this situation would be much messier in real life.\n\n40. Wild Things\n\nThree words: The. Pool. Scene. There’s fighting, there’s sex, there’s passion, and some extremely iconic woman-on-woman action.\n\n41. Love & Other Drugs\n\nA womanizer (Jake Gyllenhal) ends up falling in love for the first time with a free-spirited Parkinson's patient (Anne Hathaway). Of course, this happens after they agree to a strictly sexual relationship. In many of the scenes, you just know they’re, uh, in deep—in every sense.\n\n42. Mr. and Mrs. Smith\n\nBrangelia may be over, but their essence lives on through these characters who make the uber romantic gesture of deciding to not kill each other and have very rough sex instead.\n\n43. Cruel Intentions\n\nYou wouldn’t think a storyline about a guy who accepts a bet to take a girl’s virginity would be romantic. That is, until he inevitably falls for her. There are many sex scenes in Cruel Intentions, but only one—between Annette (Reese Witherspoon) and Sebastian (Ryan Phillippe)—could really be called romantic, which is probably why it's so memorable.\n\n44. Love Jones\n\nThe chemistry between Darius and Nina is so powerful that their first kiss leads to sex and lovely cheese omelets for breakfast. While their relationship has its rocky parts, their instant connection is much more than a fling.\n\n45. Black Swan\n\nWhether or not we can truly consider the iconic sex scene between Mila Kunis and Natalie Portman \"romantic\" definitely depends on your definition of that word. But look, there's heat, there's passion, and there's chemistry that definitely transcends your everyday sex scene.\n\n46. Call Me By Your Name\n\nWhile we don’t actually get to see the sex part happening, the foreplay and short dialogue between Elio and Oliver (Timothée Chalamet and Armie Hammer) in this scene is enough to know it’s one of the most romantic ones yet. It has a bit of playfulness, some relatable awkwardness, and includes a confirmation of consent.\n\n47. Titanic\n\nA sweaty car sex scene with foggy window handprints? Iconic. The audience doesn't see much, but the chemistry between co-stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet is so palpable, it doesn't matter. (Pro tip: if you love the romance of Titanic, but aren't wild about the actual, you know, disaster and death that follows, the sex scene is the perfect stopping point.)"
