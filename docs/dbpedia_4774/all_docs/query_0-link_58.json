        "text": "Gray VS Esdeath is the 124th episode of Death Battle, featuring Gray Fullbuster from the Fairy Tail series and Esdeath from the Akame ga Kill! series in a battle between powerful anime cryomancers. Gray was voiced by Mark Allen Jr. and Esdeath was voiced by Emma Breezy.\n\nInterlude\n\nWe cut to Wiz and Boomstick.\n\nWiz: The element of ice is cold and unforgiving.\n\nBoomstick: Literally!\n\nHe shows a beer can in an ice cube, frowning before throwing it away.\n\nWiz: Only in an equally frigid and unmerciful land can one understand its true potential.\n\nWe cut to the combatants' name cards.\n\nBoomstick: Like Gray Fullbuster, ice mage of the Fairy Tail guild.\n\nWiz: And Esdeath, the imperial general from Akame ga Kill!.\n\nWe cut back to Wiz and Boomstick.\n\nBoomstick: He's Wiz and I'm Boomstick.\n\nWiz: And it's our job to analyze their weapons, armor, and skills to find out who would win... a Death Battle.\n\nGray Fullbuster\n\nWiz: In a land far, far away lies the kingdom of Fiore, a place filled with magic.\n\nBoomstick: But not everyone was livin' their best life in magic town.\n\nWiz: Gray Fullbuster was a child of the north, living among the frigid cold.\n\nBoomstick: Until an edgy-lookin' demon showed up and wiped out the whole place. Gray survived, though everyone else wasn't so lucky. But hey, at least he got adopted by a hot stripper!\n\nWiz: This was Ur, and she just so happened to be one of the greatest ice mages in the world.\n\nBoomstick: So, Gray got to trainin'. Who else is gonna take out that creepy demon for revenge and justice, right? And he needed to master ice magic to do it!\n\nWiz: Gray worked tirelessly, and eventually became a master of Ice-Make Molding Magic. Essentially crafting weapons, tools, and other inanimate objects out of ice.\n\nBoomstick: Swords, shields, hammers, grappling hooks, stairs, clones of himself, anything he wants, really. He can even whip out a freakin' ice bazooka! He also took after new mom and became a regular Chippendale himself. Yeah, he really never stopped doin' that.\n\nWiz: But with powerful magic at his beck and call, Gray became reckless, desperate to prove himself and destroy the demon. Sadly, this carelessness would change his life for the worse one more time.\n\nBoomstick: He tried to take the demon out himself, but things didn't go so great, even with his shiny new powers.\n\nWe cut to Wiz and Boomstick.\n\nBoomstick: Whoa whoa whoa, Gray learned how to do all this cool ice magic by stripping?\n\nWiz: Well...\n\nBoomstick rips off his shirt.\n\nBoomstick: Ice magic, here I come! Oil me up, Wiz!\n\nWiz: Uh, no, no no no, removing clothes was just part of Ur's training.\n\nWiz: See, she instructed Gray to do so in order to adapt to the cold to better resist it, letting him have a much greater range when it comes to his own ice magic.\n\nBoomstick looks at him, holding a stripper pole. He lets go and it rises up into the ceiling.\n\nBoomstick: Why didn't you say that five seconds earlier when I still had my favorite shirt?\n\nWe cut back to the analysis.\n\nWiz: Anyway, Gray was outmatched by the demon, and Ur was forced to step in with her ultimate spell, Iced Shell.\n\nBoomstick: It's a super handy move that can freeze a giant demon like that for good! Ha ha!\n\nWiz: At the cost of the caster's life.\n\nBoomstick: Ah, there it is. Big oof. If that's not bad enough, Gray learned an ultimate ultimate version called Lost Iced Shell. This one also kills you, but as a bonus, it also erases the memories of you from everyone who ever knew you.\n\nWiz: Sure, the Lost Iced Shell is hundreds of times more powerful, and basically a guaranteed win move if he has enough time to cast it, but how does that even work? Say Gray cut off your arm, leaving you handicapped for years, then Lost Iced Shell'd himself elsewhere. That would be a very confusing day.\n\nBoomstick: Is that how I lost my leg? Wonder who it was I knew? Ah well, speakin' of loss, Gray Filibuster had lost two families at this point.\n\nWiz: But once again, he found new footing and new friends, this time with the mages of the Fairy Tail guild.\n\nBoomstick: Including a clingy, blue haired water lady, Juvia. I-It's okay, you can ship 'em; everybody does. Including them.\n\nWiz: Now full from a serious helping of humble pie, Gray changed his tune. No longer would he be a reckless avenger, but a cautious, laid-back defender of his new friends. Which works out, since this is the sort of world where fighting for your friends actually increases your magical power. True story.\n\nBoomstick: You could say he started keeping a \"cool head\", huh? Yep, no more demon huntin' for him. Uh, well, until he got his hands on demon-killing magic, of course!\n\nWiz: After becoming an Ice Devil Slayer, Gray learned how to devour ice to replenish his power, become extremely resistant to ice attacks, mess around with other people's ice magic, and conjure spells designed to kill demons.\n\nBoomstick: Which would've been really, really handy just a little bit ago... Oh, well! With all this magic, ice mages can wipe out an entire town all at once, or stir up an ice storm that covered the country of Fiore.\n\nWiz: By comparing Invel's ice storm to the scale of Fiore, based on official maps, it appears the force and energy of the storm would be equivalent to more than 27 gigatons of TNT.\n\nBoomstick: Now that's a big-ass storm! And it makes sense, as Gray can fight on par with fellow guildies Natsu and Erza. Natsu has dodged lightning, and Erza blew up this giant meteor all by herself.\n\nWiz: Measuring the distance between the meteor and land in this shot, and comparing its size to Erza in this one, we found that Erza must have been moving over 20,000 times the speed of sound to intercept it, striking it with a force of over 50 teratons of TNT.\n\nBoomstick: And Gray should definitely be in the same ballpark at least. Especially since Erza wasn't even at her full strength!\n\nWiz: Truly as long as Gray keeps his pants on — literally — he is a fierce warrior who will always fight for his friends.\n\nGray: 'Cause I've got a will all of my own, and it says my friends and I are gonna walk the path of life!\n\nEsdeath\n\nWiz: As a child, Esdeath lived among her clan in the northern frontier, hunting giant monsters called Danger Beasts with her father.\n\nBoomstick: Awesome! Now that's how you raise a kid. Look at the size of that thing! Where can I get a hunting license for those?\n\nWiz: However, Esdeath's destiny would lie further south, among a thousand-year-old empire.\n\nBoomstick: Because whadda you know, her whole clan got wiped out, leaving her as the lone survivor. Now, normally this would lead to a dramatic revenge story and a lesson on friendship and appreciating what you have and stuff. But, uh... that's not what happened.\n\nWiz: Right, Esdeath ascribed herself to a sort of \"survival of the fittest\" philosophy. To her, if her father lay dead before her, that didn't mean she should be sad or angry. That meant her father was weak.\n\nBoomstick: You're damn right! Finally, somebody knows what I'm talkin' about! That's my power of friendship. This girl's got it all figured out.\n\nWiz: Well, now on her own and... maybe a bit insane, Esdeath joined the militant ranks of the widespread Empire...\n\nWiz: ...where her violent nature found a new calling.\n\nBoomstick: Yeah, like when she buried 400,000 people alive! Mama Boomstick always told me you should enjoy your work, so... good for her, I guess. She even got a promotion, and an offer of a new weapon that would change everything: a Teigu.\n\nWiz: Esdeath was already extremely proficient with a sword, but this was something entirely different. A Teigu is a supernatural relic forged from the remnants of special Danger Beasts. They can take the form of anything from a battle axe to a flute to a giant pair of scissors. However, Esdeath chose one so unique, most were absolutely terrified of it. It was blood, the Demon's Extract.\n\nBoomstick: And because she's a totally sane and normal person, she drank it. ALL OF IT. ...Okay.\n\nWiz: After surviving the side effects, you know, the usual headaches, nausea, maddening voices in her head telling her to kill everyone, Esdeath earned her reward.\n\nBoomstick: Ice magic, b*tches! She can make and shape ice out of thin air. Weapons, shields, platforms, horses, freakin' meteors, you name it, she can make it! Plus, she can fly by holding herself in the air with ice and once built an entire army of ice horse-people. Look at them all! There's thousands of 'em!\n\nWiz: Well, it did take her a few days to make them all, implying she has a limit to her ability. Regardless, her enormous power is clear. She can even create a giant suit of armor around herself like some sort of icy mech.\n\nWe cut to Wiz and Boomstick.\n\nBoomstick: So she's a super deadly ice lady, but she's also got a soft side.\n\nWiz: Even with all the power she held, not even sadistic conquest or unstoppable ice magic could fill the void in her heart. Esdeath sought one thing above all else: Love.\n\nBoomstick: The Ice Queen needs some lovin'? I know just the man for the job.\n\nWiz: So does she, apparently. She made a list of the specific qualities in her ideal man, who turned out to be this guy, Tatsumi.\n\nBoomstick spits his beer at Wiz.\n\nBoomstick: Wh— What!? Really!? Aw, some dopey, generic, anime protagonist kid!?\n\nWiz: Well, he literally is an anime protagonist.\n\nBoomstick: Aw, come on, he's like a 3 out of 10 and she's not even on the chart. She's way too good for him.\n\nWiz: Is she?\n\nWiz shows to Boomstick a scene on how Esdeath tortures her captives.\n\nBoomstick: Oh right, she's crazy. Even better!\n\nWe cut back to the analysis.\n\nWiz: Deranged sadism aside, there is one skill of hers which impresses above all else: Mahapadma.\n\nBoomstick: Gesundheit! A-hem, it's a time stop she can only use once per day. It freezes time, but like literally freezes it, with cold.\n\nWiz: This. Makes. No. Sense.\n\nBoomstick: Anyway, Esdeath got to work leading her new hunting group called the Jaegers and doin' as many awesome things as she could to impress that Tatsumi brat. Once she froze an entire river with zero effort. Imagine how many slushies you could make with that.\n\nWiz: That isn't even a fraction of her true potential. After absorbing those tens of thousands of ice cavalry, Esdeath harnessed enough power to create an icy storm that spanned an entire continent. Comparing its size relative to the planet's diameter, producing a storm of this scale would require a kinetic energy over 280 petatons of TNT.\n\nBoomstick: Super impressive! But remember, it took her quote \"a few days\" to make that many ice people.\n\nWiz: Essentially stockpiling a lot more power then she would normally be capable of on any individual day.\n\nBoomstick: But Esdeath has tangled with the toughest rebels out there. Akame, who can dodge lightning, and dumb old Tatsumi, who was strong enough to out-muscle this absolute unit of a Teigu called, ahh...Shi-ko-tazer. What's up with all these made-up German words?\n\nWiz: Shikoutazer, or the Primus Imperator, was powerful enough to create a massive crater outside the Imperial Capital. To make a crater of this size, the blast must have equaled over 900 teratons of TNT.\n\nBoomstick: And Esdeath is even more hardcore! Get this, one time her arm was poisoned. But before she let the poison spread to her body, she karate chopped her whole friggin' arm off and replaced it with an ice sword! ...Yes!\n\nWiz: Sadly, or luckily depending on where you stand, all the power in the world wasn't enough for Esdeath to win Tatsumi's love.\n\nBoomstick: And she didn't even get to conquer the world either, 'cause the main title character had to ruin everything.\n\nWiz: But in the end, she didn't lament her failure to conquer, or see herself as weak. Rather, she simply regretted not being able to look at Tatsumi one more time. Perhaps her cold philosophy was growing a bit warmer... or maybe she was just an insane psychopath.\n\nEsdeath: I will always be on top. I will always be victorious. No matter what gets in my way.\n\nPrelude\n\nDeath Battle\n\nOn a beach of Fiore, several warships are seen on the sea. Their general, Esdeath, steps onto the water, freezing the entire surrounding area of the sea and allowing her to walk to land.\n\nEsdeath: Hmph. Such a paltry country is hardly worth conquering.\n\nWith a wave of her hand, she uses her Ice Calvary Trump Card to summon an army of ice centaur soldiers that begin marching behind her, when she hears a voice.\n\nGray: Hey!\n\nShe sees Gray Fullbuster on the island as he is determined to defend his land.\n\nGray: Take your troops and get out!\n\nEsdeath is initially uninterested until Gray takes off his shirt, the sight of which is shown in slow-motion with a sparkly background as a \"wow\" sound effect plays. Now enraged, Esdeath's eyes darken and clenches her teeth as she commands the cavalry to ready themselves for battle. She then touches the frozen sea, using her ice magic to create a row of ice spikes that hit Gray and knock him back, although he recovers quickly. Esdeath then commands her army to charge at Gray.\n\nGray: Oh, just what I needed. Another crazy, blue-haired woman in my life.\n\nGray summons four ice clones of himself, who proceed to easily take down several of the centaurs. Esdeath comes riding in on a centaur of her own as Gray leaps into the air and throws ice spears down at her, the first two missing and the last one making the centaur skid to a halt to destroy it with its lance.\n\nGray then approaches her with a charged-up ice blast in his hands. Esdeath and the centaur attempt to fend him off with their weapons, but Gray dodges them before firing the blast and knocking his foe back. However, his attack also powderized the centaur into snow in the process, creating a blind spot that Esdeath jumps out of, landing on his head and stabbing him in his right shoulder. She then jumps away, levitating herself by forming ice floats on her wrists and boots.\n\nEsdeath: You have no right to feel my boot against your face! Now...\n\nShe summons the giant ice meteor, Hagelsprung, which she hurls towards Gray.\n\nEsdeath: ...die for me!\n\nHowever, Gray is quick to counter with his Ice-Make magic.\n\nGray: Ice-Make: Crescent Blades!\n\nHe fires several crescent-shaped ice blades which destroy the meteor, breaking it into smaller chunks of ice. Gray then turns these pieces into an Ice-Make: Kite that he mounts to his arm, using it to fly high above Esdeath before forming a giant Ice-Make: Hammer.\n\nGray: Take this!\n\nGray quickly swings down on her, and although Esdeath attempts to block by raising a few ice shields, her attempts are futile, as Gray's hammer plows through them and sends her tumbling onto the ground, landing on and destroying one of her own ice cavalry in the process. Giving his opponent no time to recover, Gray lands onto the ground and reforms his hammer into a cannon.\n\nGray: Ice Cannon!\n\nHe fires it, blasting the still tumbling Esdeath away towards the sea, although she is able to stop her momentum by forming an ice wall behind her, causing her hat to fly off. All the while, Gray's clones and Esdeath's soldiers continue to fight each other.\n\nEsdeath: Very nice!\n\nShe slaps on her ice wall, causing it and her troops to dissipate as she absorbs them, leaving Gray's clones that were fighting them confused.\n\nEsdeath: Ice Storm!\n\nEsdeath points her index finger into the sky as she prepares one of her most infamous Trump Cards: Ice Storm Commander-In-Chief. Ice and snow begin eveloping the entire area, with Gray using Ice-Make: Shield to protect himself. A shot from space of the storm is seen, with it growing wide enough to cover the entire continent. After it lands, the whole land of Fiore is now indeed covered in snow, leaving a floating Esdeath looking down on the battlefield and sneering in satisfaction of her foe's apparent defeat. However, she is suddenly surprised by a sudden explosion of snow, caused by Gray inhaling his surrounding ice into himself, which activates his Ice Devil Mark.\n\nGray: (burps) Thanks for the meal.\n\nHe immediately jumps up to Esdeath and attacks his stunned enemy.\n\nGray: Ice-Make: Impact!\n\nAs he forms another giant hammer, Esdeath attempts to block by forming a shield, which is once again a futile attempt as the hammer strikes her down onto the frozen sea, although she quickly regains her footing. However, Gray gives her no time to recover as he prepares another attack.\n\nGray: Ice Devil: Zeroth Long Sword!\n\nGray clashes his magic sword against Esdeath's summoned ice rapier and the two block each other's blades a few times until Gray parries her, allowing him to kick her away and slice off her right forearm. However, both the severed arm and her stump begin glowing pink. Esdeath quickly recovers and goes to attack Gray, her stump forming an ice arm and rapier in the process, hitting him and knocking him back.\n\nGray: She's... too much! I have no choice!\n\nNow disarmed of his sword, Gray forms two shields that Esdeath easily destroys. She stabs through the third and gets her rapier stuck in it, allowing Gray to push her back. Out of options, Gray prepares his final attack.\n\nGray: Lost Iced Shell!\n\nEsdeath destroys the shield and rapier before witnessing the black and dark blue aura emerging from Gray, which slowly beings enveloping her and freezing her whole body. However, she stops it last second with a Trump Card of her own.\n\nEsdeath: Everything in sight will be encased in ice... Mahapadma!\n\nAs Esdeath casts Mahapadma, everything comes to a halt as time is literally frozen, casting the entire area in a light blue aura. Esdeath clenches her first in celebration of her win, but is shocked when Gray begins resisting Mahapadma and forms magic circles all around her. But before he can attack, Esdeath moves what little remains unfrozen of her body to finish off Gray.\n\nEsdeath: Freeze...\n\nDetaching her frozen prosthetic arm, she launches it towards Gray, impaling his chest and freezing him once again. As the world unfreezes, Esdeath almost collapses when she is freed from the ice as Gray's spell goes away.\n\nEsdeath: Congratulations... and goodbye...\n\nShe walks away, leaving Gray's still-frozen corpse on the icy sea.\n\nResults\n\nWe cut to Wiz and Boomstick, with the latter using a microphone while talking like a news reporter.\n\nBoomstick: This just in: Male stripper found dead after a crazy night with a dominatrix gone wrong. More at 7.\n\nWiz: Let's get to this. This was certainly an interesting matchup, and both cryomancers held their own advantages.\n\nBoomstick: Oh yeah, Gray's awesome Ice-Make powers meant he had a ton of versatility at his frosty fingertips.\n\nWe cut to the post-analysis.\n\nBoomstick: Like how he could eat ice to replenish his magic. She sure didn't see that one comin'.\n\nWiz: Though being the tactician she is, Esdeath likely wouldn't fall for any of Gray's tricks more than once. Also, both were in the same range of speed by scaling to feats of dodging lightning.\n\nBoomstick: Yeah, but the queen of cold kink definitely had more ice power up her sleeves. Just look at those storms! The one Gray scales to covered a country, while Esdeath's covered a whole continent.\n\nWiz: True, but we still had to deduce the exact nature and potential of her storm. Remember, Esdeath specifically claimed it took her a few days to make the ice cavalry she used as fuel for the storm. A few generally means three at minimum, so we can cut the yield of our previous calculation to one-third. Low-balling this a bit, let's assume she used all of her power each day to make one third of the total cavalry. This would mean Esdeath could wield about 93 petatons worth of energy on a daily basis.\n\nBoomstick: Yeah, that's way more than Invel's ice storm, and 1,600 times deadlier than that meteor Erza obliterated. Esdeath definitely had the advantage in sheer magic power. Even with his better resistances, there's no way Gray could survive that much magic force, so he really only had one shot, the Lost Iced Shell.\n\nWiz: Which certainly could have ended things right then and there, if not for Esdeath's time stop ability. Both the Iced Shell and Mahapadma could only be used once. But, Mahapadma was more useful given its immediate effect compared to the Iced Shell's long casting time. And its versatility in that Esdeath could follow it up with whatever she wanted.\n\nBoomstick: Also, it doesn't kill her, so that's a plus.\n\nWiz: Uh, sure.\n\nBoomstick: Technically, Gray's Ice Devil Slayer magic means he could probably resist the Mahaptopotamus a bit. But that brat Tatsumi had crazy good cold resistance, too, and it didn't do him much good against the time freeze.\n\nWe cut to Wiz and Boomstick.\n\nWiz: Gray's speed and versatility meant he could hold his own, but Esdeath's awesome power, uniquely suited time freezing, and domineering perseverance saw her through this battle.\n\nBoomstick: Looks like Esdeath stopped Gray cold.\n\nWe cut to the \"Winner\" card.\n\nWiz: The winner is Esdeath.\n\nOriginal Track\n\nComposition\n\nThe track for this fight is \"Lost Ice Storms\" by Brandon Yates ft. Myriani and Jun Mitsui (both of whom go uncredited on the track cover). It is a rock duet with some slight Celtic touches referencing the musical styles of both series and both combatants' affiliation with the cold. The track further emphasizes the battle between the two with the two singers going against each other, with Brandon portraying Gray and Myriani portraying Esdeath.\n\nTitle\n\nThe title references the names of Gray and Esdeath's most powerful attacks (Lost Iced Shell and Ice Storm: Commander in Chief, respectively).\n\nCover Art\n\nThe cover art done by Luis Cruz depicts two icy Fairy Tail Guild logos overlapping each over with the mark of Esdeath's Teigu encased within its center as snow falls around them.\n\nLyrics\n\nTrivia\n\nProduction\n\nThe connections between Gray and Esdeath are that they are both powerful anime ice manipulators with tattoos on their chests. Both were born and raised in cold northern lands, but lost their parents and had their homes destroyed at a young age. Both of their fathers also inadvertently passed down corrupting influences to them (Gray's father, Silver Fullbuster, giving his son Ice Devil Slayer Magic, which can corrupt Gray's soul, while Esdeath's father's ideals ultimately pushed her to becoming the Darwinistic warmonger she would end up as). Both of their ice manipulation abilities come from sources associated with demons (Ice Devil Slayer Magic and the Demon's Extract Teigu, respectively) and have the capability to use extremely powerful but highly risky and limited-use ice manipulation techniques (Iced Shell and Mahapadma, respectively). Both are also prominent members of teams (Team Natsu and the Jaegers, respectively) within larger organizations (the Fairy Tail Guild and the Empire, respectively).\n\nIronically, whilst Gray is pursued by a blue-haired, love-struck woman, Juvia Lockser, Esdeath herself is a blue-haired woman who is in love with and obsessed with Tatsumi to a similar degree. But whilst Juvia eventually joined Gray's side, Esdeath eventually realized that Tatsumi was her enemy.\n\nBoomstick's ending pun, \"Looks like Esdeath stopped Gray cold,\" is very similar to the one used in Boba Fett VS Samus Aran (2010), \"She sure stopped him cold.\"\n\nErrors\n\nIn Esdeath's \"Background\" slide, her weight is listed as 52 km instead of 52 kg.\n\nGray reverts from his Ice Devil Mark sprite to his normal sprite for the rest of the fight after Esdeath uses Mahapadma.\n\nOther\n\nThis is the 10th Anime-themed episode, after Zoro VS Erza, Natsu VS Ace, Lucario VS Renamon, Naruto VS Ichigo, Jotaro VS Kenshiro, Roshi VS Jiraiya, Sasuke VS Hiei, Mob VS Tatsumaki, and All Might VS Might Guy, and with the next 11 being Beerus VS Sailor Galaxia, Sanji VS Rock Lee, DIO VS Alucard, Madara VS Aizen, Tanjiro VS Jonathan Joestar, Deku VS Asta, Gogeta VS Vegito, Killua VS Misaka, Gojo VS Makima, Mahito VS Shigaraki, and Ash VS Yugi.\n\nThis is the fourth episode in which the track features a lyrical battle between its combatants, after Ryu VS Jin, Thanos VS Darkseid, and Miles Morales VS Static, with the next three being Black Adam VS Apocalypse, Bill Cipher VS Discord, and Cole MacGrath VS Alex Mercer.\n\nThis is the second episode whose track includes female singers, after Meta VS Carolina, and with the next six being Blake VS Mikasa, Harley Quinn VS Jinx, Skyrim VS Dark Souls, Gojo VS Makima, Scooby-Doo VS Courage the Cowardly Dog, and Galactus VS Unicron.\n\nThis is the third ice-themed episode, after Sub-Zero VS Glacius and Weiss VS Mitsuru.\n\nThis is the 18th Male VS Female-themed episode, after Boba Fett VS Samus Aran (2010), Yoshi VS Riptor, Justin Bieber VS Rebecca Black, Starscream VS Rainbow Dash, Gaara VS Toph, Boba Fett VS Samus Aran (2015), Dante VS Bayonetta, Meta VS Carolina, Tracer VS Scout, Zoro VS Erza, Deadpool VS Pinkie Pie, Lara Croft VS Nathan Drake, Thor VS Wonder Woman, Carnage VS Lucy, Captain Marvel VS Shazam, Dragonzord VS Mechagodzilla, and Mob VS Tatsumaki, and with the next seven being Beerus VS Sailor Galaxia, The Seven Battle Royale, Red VS Blue, Shadow VS Ryuko, Steven Universe VS Star Butterfly, Killua VS Misaka, and Gojo VS Makima.\n\nThis is 12th time the Female character wins, after Boba Fett VS Samus Aran (2010), Starscream VS Rainbow Dash, Gaara VS Toph, Boba Fett VS Samus Aran (2015), Meta VS Carolina, Tracer VS Scout, Lara Croft VS Nathan Drake, Thor VS Wonder Woman, Carnage VS Lucy, Dragonzord VS Mechagodzilla, and Mob VS Tatsumaki, and with the next three being Red VS Blue, Steven Universe VS Star Butterfly, and Killua VS Misaka.\n\nThis is the sixth episode to have an Antagonist defeat a Protagonist, after Godzilla VS Gamera, Ryu VS Scorpion, Joker VS Sweet Tooth, Hulk VS Doomsday, and Sephiroth VS Vergil, and with the next five being Hulk VS Broly, DIO VS Alucard, Harley Quinn VS Jinx, Black Adam VS Apocalypse, and Bill Cipher VS Discord.\n\nThis is the second episode to have a Villain defeat a Hero, after Hulk VS Doomsday.\n\nThis episode reached YouTube's Trending page.\n\nThis episode marks the first time a voice actor has been cast for two consecutive episodes (Mark Allen Jr. for Genos VS War Machine and Gray VS Esdeath), followed by Nicholas Andrew Louie (for Obi-Wan Kenobi VS Kakashi and Danny Phantom VS American Dragon Jake Long), both Tom Schalk and Curtis Arnott (for Macho Man VS Kool-Aid Man and DIO VS Alucard), Mornal (for Excalibur VS Raiden and James Bond VS John Wick), Michael Kovach (for Deku VS Asta and Gogeta VS Vegito), and Paul Guyet (for Martian Manhunter VS Silver Surfer and Bill Cipher VS Discord)."
