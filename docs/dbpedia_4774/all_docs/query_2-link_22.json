        "text": "INTRODUCTION\n\nThe acrosome reaction (AR) is a prerequisite for spermatozoa to successfully fertilize the oocyte/egg. This process is strictly dependent on an increase in intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) [1]. Determining the magnitude of the AR and its associated [Ca2+]i changes continuously in time is needed to fully decipher this fundamental process, as many questions remain regarding the kinetic and location correlations between these two physiological parameters (reviewed in [1 –3]). Although [Ca2+]i determinations continuously in time have been performed in both cell populations [4, 5] and single human spermatozoa [4, 6, 7] for quite a while, AR measurements have typically been obtained in fixed spermatozoa previously exposed to the experimental conditions of interest [8]. In an attempt to correlate the AR with its associated [Ca2+]i changes, bovine and human spermatozoa were fixed after the completion of Ca2+ recordings [4, 9, 10]. More recently, transgenic expression of fluorescent proteins allowed real-time measurements of AR progression in mouse sperm [11, 12], but this approach is not available for human sperm. Nonetheless, two novel strategies were devised using fluorescent probes externally added to follow the AR in real time in human spermatozoa. One of them used specific fluorescent labeling of two different acrosome components: soybean trypsin inhibitor, which binds to acrosin, an enzyme contained in the acrosome, and an antibody against CD46, a protein localized in the inner acrosomal membrane [13]. The other strategy monitored real time binding of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated Pisum sativum agglutinin (FITC-PSA), a lectin that has been extensively used as an AR reporter in fixed spermatozoa [8, 14]. However, only one study reported simultaneous [Ca2+]i and AR determinations in human spermatozoa using a single dye (Fluo-3) as indicator of both parameters. In spite of this, it was not firmly established how closely Fluo-3 leakage follows AR, and morphological confirmation of the AR process was not provided [15].\n\nThe sperm AR is an exocytotic event that shares molecular mechanisms with somatic cell exocytosis [16]. The family of FM dyes displays ideal properties for selective tracking of membrane dynamics during exocytosis and endocytosis in somatic cells [17 –20]. Here we found that FM4-64 labeled the sperm plasma membrane, and, interestingly, its fluorescence increased in the acrosome region upon induction of the AR. This increased fluorescence correlated with FITC-PSA staining of the acrosome, suggesting that FM4-64 reliably detects the onset and development of the AR. Also, the delineation of the sperm plasma membrane by FM4-64 allowed us to monitor form and/or size changes of the membrane during and after AR. Interestingly, FM4-64 unveiled the formation of tubular appendages, emerging from different areas of the sperm head as the AR was progressing. The formation of these appendages is not a staining artifact, because they were verified with scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Appendage formation was never observed in non-acrosome-reacted sperm cells.\n\nBecause of its fluorescence properties, FM4-64 imaging can be simultaneously or alternately (here also referred to as concomitantly) performed together with [Ca2+]i imaging using a Ca2+-sensitive dye such as Fluo-4. The combination of these two dyes allowed us to concomitantly determine [Ca2+]i dynamics and AR progress in real time. We anticipate this novel and powerful strategy will further advance our understanding of the AR in mammalian spermatozoa. The results reported here suggest that spontaneous [Ca2+]i oscillations, present in ∼30% of human spermatozoa, as well as those promoted by progesterone, diminish the propensity to undergo AR, perhaps providing a mechanism to prevent untimely AR. Our findings also reveal that after the well described [Ca2+]i increase triggered by progesterone [6, 21], spermatozoa that will acrosome react display a second [Ca2+]i peak just before the reaction starts. Some of these spermatozoa also exhibit a slow Ca2+ rise around 2 min before AR initiation.\n\nRESULTS\n\nFM4-64 Distribution Changes in Response to AR Inductors\n\nFM4-64 readily labels the plasma membrane of motile human spermatozoa. It even allows clear visualization of the cytoplasmic droplet ( A, white arrows right panel), which is hardly distinguishable by phase-contrast microscopy ( A, white arrows left panel). Application of 10 μM ionomycin ( B, black arrowhead), a potent AR inducer, promotes the redistribution of FM4-64 staining and increases its fluorescence in the acrosomal region of spermatozoa ( B and Supplemental Movie S1; all supplemental material is available online at www.biolreprod.org), suggesting that the dye gains access to the internal acrosomal membrane. C illustrates the dynamics of the FM4-64 distribution after ionomycin exposure in a representative experiment. It should be pointed out that because the dye is present in the external media, the addition of progesterone or ionomycin, dissolved in dye-free solution, results initially in FM4-64 fluorescence decrease due to dye dilution. To rule out the possibility that dye uptake could be related to cell damage, viability experiments were performed using SG, a cell death reporter, after exposing spermatozoa to either ionomycin or progesterone in the presence of FM4-64 (see Materials and Methods). D (lower panel) shows that few cells display SG fluorescence even after 30 min of treatment with these AR inductors, whereas a significant proportion of them increase their FM4-64 fluorescence (upper panel). In contrast, many cells increased their SG fluorescence after Triton-induced sperm death (lower panel). Analysis of these experiments reveals that ∼80% and 67% of sperm showed no SG staining even after 30 min exposure to ionomycin or progesterone, respectively ( E). Cells were considered dead when SG fluorescence intensity reached >30% of that shown by Triton-treated spermatozoa.\n\nFM4-64 Labels the Acrosome at the Beginning of the AR\n\nTo confirm that the FM4-64 fluorescence increase observed in the acrosome of spermatozoa is a good indicator of AR, we used FITC-PSA, which in unfixed cells can gain access into the acrosome only when spermatozoa react [14]. In these experiments spermatozoa were incubated in the presence of both FITC-PSA and FM4-64 ( ). When the AR was induced either with progesterone or ionomycin ( , A and B arrowhead at ∼80″), spermatozoa labeling progressed in parallel with both dyes. Sometimes the FM4-64 fluorescence increase in the acrosome region preceded FITC-PSA staining ( , A–C), but the difference in latency was not statistically significant. The percentage of acrosome-reacted sperm stimulated by ionomycin was 79.8% ± 5.9% when detected by FM4-64 fluorescence and 71.2% ± 8.2% when using FITC-PSA; the difference between these AR detection assays was not significant ( D). Comparison of the time course of fluorescence staining with both dyes during the AR revealed gradual increases often reaching a plateau level ( E; red, upper trace, FM4-64; green, lower trace, FITC-PSA). However, F shows that FITC-PSA fluorescence reached a plateau more frequently, whereas in general, FM4-64 staining kept increasing or displayed an increase, a transitory plateau, and then a sustained increase (see Supplemental Fig. S1).\n\nThe AR is an exocytotic process that depends on the presence of extracellular Ca2+. If FM4-64 is truly reporting the occurrence of the AR, the intensity of fluorescence staining should depend on the amount of Ca2+ present in the medium. FM4-64 staining in the acrosome region induced by ionomycin/progesterone application was significantly reduced when extracellular Ca2+ was diminished from 2 mM to 100 nM (*P < 0.05 and **P < 0.01, G; n = 5; 402 and 352 cells analyzed respectively). These findings corroborate that FM4-64 acrosome staining depends on external Ca2+, and therefore it is a potential indicator of the extent of AR. Measurements of FM4-64 fluorescence quantified during 5-min-long time windows showed that about 10 min after ionomycin application, nearly half of the cells were already reacted, whereas in the case of progesterone, spermatozoa continued reacting even after 20 min of its application ( H). Notably, three distinct patterns of FM4-64 fluorescence increase (AR initiation) were observed: 1) apical (AP), characterized by the initial uptake of FM4-64 in the AP zone of the head; 2) lateral (LAT), in which the uptake of FM4-64 started on the side of the acrosome; and 3) ascending (ASC), where the uptake of FM4-64 began at the postacrosomal area or below, continuing upwards, towards the acrosome ( I). The majority of spermatozoa displayed the AP pattern of AR initiation upon progesterone stimulation, whereas after ionomycin the AP and LAT patterns were similarly frequent ( J and ).\n\nFM4-64 Staining Revealed Novel Sperm Membrane Structures\n\nFM4-64 staining also revealed a novel and unique phenomenon. A few minutes (2.65 ± 2.5) after AR initiation with progesterone, striking tubular structures that moved vigorously appeared from the head in approximately 36% ± 5% of spermatozoa. These structures varied in size and number: they sometimes emerged from a LAT region of the head whereas in other instances they developed from the AP zone of the head ( A and Supplemental Movies S2–S4). SEM further confirmed the formation of these structures upon AR stimulation, ruling out that they represented an artifact or damage from FM4-64 staining and/or illumination with excitation light ( B). For SEM observations, experiments were carried out omitting the FM4-64 staining. Briefly, spermatozoa were exposed to progesterone for 15 or 30 min and then fixed and processed as required (see material and methods). It is worth mentioning that SEM underestimates the percentage of AR spermatozoa displaying appendages because the technical procedure required often results in their breakage (Supplemental Fig. S2). For these reasons, we did not attempt a systematic quantification of these structures. Also in accordance with our previous observations, these appendages arose from different head areas. A comparison of appendages seen using FM4-64 fluorescence and SEM is shown in , C–E. The similarities demonstrate not only that these structures are genuine, but that they do not depend on the presence of the dye or its excitation. Similar appendages were also observed when the AR was induced with ionomycin.\n\nAlternate Fluorescence Monitoring of AR (FM4-64) and [Ca2+]i (Fluo-4) in Single Human Spermatozoa\n\nSpermatozoa were loaded with FM4-64 and the Ca2+ sensitive dye Fluo-4 to monitor the occurrence of the AR and the associated Ca2+ dynamics in real time. A representative fluorescence image of nonstimulated cells loaded with both dyes is illustrated in A. As shown earlier, FM4-64 labels the contour of non-acrosome-reacted spermatozoa, whereas Fluo-4 fluorescence is observed homogeneously distributed inside the sperm head and midpiece, the regions usually in focus. In these experiments, ionomycin and progesterone promoted a [Ca2+]i increase that led to the AR in 75.9% ± 14% and 12.1% ± 2.7% of the spermatozoa, respectively ( , B and C, and Supplemental Movies S5 and S6). Right-side panels in , B and C, illustrate representative fluorescence traces from FM4-64 and Fluo-4 labeled single spermatozoa (white arrows) during and after ionomycin and progesterone application, respectively. As previously shown ( B and , A and B), the onset of the AR, revealed by FM4-64, is characterized by an increased staining in the acrosome region and a smaller one in the midpiece ( D, FM4). FM4-64 fluorescence increase is observed on average 114 ± 17 and 539 ± 47 sec after the [Ca2+]i increase promoted by ionomycin and progesterone, respectively. With the time resolution of these experiments (one image every 2.5 sec), the [Ca2+]i increase induced by progesterone appears to begin close to the base of the head. Faster measurements (10 images/sec) performed in spermatozoa immobilized with concanavalin A (not shown) revealed that [Ca2+]i increases initiate in the sperm principal piece, as previously reported [7]. Notably, the majority of cells that displayed FM4-64 fluorescence increase experienced a late decrease of Fluo-4 fluorescence ( D, 172″), which is likely because of the leakage of intracellular dye resulting from the formation of multiple fenestrations associated with the AR. Similar results were reported previously, and in fact, the fall in Fluo-3 fluorescence was used as a reporter of the AR [15]. The full loss of Fluo-4 fluorescence ( D [EF4] and E and Fig. S3 in supplementary material [Empty F4]), could be associated with the emptying of the acrosome content and therefore the termination of the AR. This Fluo-4 fluorescence loss is delayed by approximately 254 ± 4 and 224 ± 8 sec relative to the FM4-64 fluorescence increases induced by progesterone and ionomycin respectively. This delay may be considered as the duration of the AR, which accordingly lasts on average approximately 4 min (see and EF4-FM4, Supplemental Fig. S3). Interestingly, closer inspection of FM4-64 and [Ca2+]i signals in spermatozoa that reacted revealed that the typical progesterone-induced [Ca2+]i transient increase is followed by a second Ca2+ peak (indicated as P in ) that immediately precedes AR initiation (pattern 4; , F–H). Practically all spermatozoa that acrosome reacted (98%) showed this pattern. F shows Fluo-4 and FM4-64 fluorescence images of a representative spermatozoon during and after progesterone stimulation (black arrowhead). The second Ca2+ peak occurred in the panel labeled 731″. The images illustrate that AR initiates concomitantly with this second Ca2+ peak. In fact, the Fluo-4 and FM4-64 fluorescence traces in G corresponding to the same spermatozoon shown in F reveal that the second Ca2+ peak slightly precedes the peak FM4-64 increase. The mean time that the second Ca2+ peak took to reach maximum fluorescence from the baseline was ∼40.9 ± 5.9 sec. Interestingly, ∼40% of spermatozoa that acrosome react show a slow Ca2+ rise (indicated as R in ) that on average started 111.9 ± 13.1 sec before the second Ca2+ peak. After the progesterone initial [Ca2+]i increase (panel labeled 50″ in F) a plateau was reached ( F, panel labeled 243″; see G) and then a slow Ca2+ rise triggered the second Ca2+ peak, ( F, panel labeled 625″) indicated by an arrow in G. The remaining spermatozoa that reacted displayed three different [Ca2+]i patterns before AR (see H). “Single peak” refers to spermatozoa that undergo AR after the first progesterone-induced [Ca2+]i peak. “Two peaks” refers to spermatozoa that react after two consecutive progesterone-induced [Ca2+]i peaks. These two [Ca2+]i patterns were observed in 23% and 18%, respectively of spermatozoa undergoing AR. The third [Ca2+]i pattern, called “slow Ca2+ rise absence,” corresponded to spermatozoa that lacked the slow Ca2+ rise and was present in 20% of acrosome-reacted spermatozoa (115 analyzed sperm, n = 9).\n\nNext we evaluated if the AR was correlated with a certain [Ca2+]i pattern induced by progesterone. We first identified four general patterns of progesterone-induced [Ca2+]i changes in spermatozoa: 1) transient, 2) transient-sustained, 3) transient-oscillatory, and 4) double transient and recovery ( and ). Analysis of these results indicated that the reduction of AR observed in spermatozoa that manifested transient-oscillatory [Ca2+]i responses promoted by progesterone was statistically significant (P = 0.013). Consistent with previous reports [21, 23], we noticed that spermatozoa showed spontaneous [Ca2+]i oscillations of different amplitude and frequency (see , A–C, and Supplemental Movie S7). We quantified this behavior and found that 35% ± 6% of capacitated spermatozoa displayed this behavior and wondered if the presence or absence of spontaneous [Ca2+]i oscillations at rest could influence the ability of sperm to undergo the progesterone-induced AR. Thus, we performed 10-min-long recordings of Fluo-4 and FM4-64 fluorescence signals prior to progesterone stimulation and continued recording for at least another 10 min afterwards. Interestingly, 97.6% ± 2% of the spermatozoa that displayed spontaneous [Ca2+]i oscillations at rest failed to undergo AR upon the addition of progesterone (only 2.3% ± 2% reacted) ( F). The difference between these two preconditions is significant (P = 0.013). Conversely, 32% ± 8% of spermatozoa lacking spontaneous [Ca2+]i oscillations at rest underwent AR in response to progesterone treatment. Given that [Ca2+]i oscillations, both spontaneous as well as those promoted by progesterone, inhibited AR, possibly the spontaneous [Ca2+]i oscillations conditioned spermatozoa to respond to progesterone with an oscillatory [Ca2+]i pattern. However, after analyzing 132 cells (n = 5 donors) displaying spontaneous [Ca2+]i oscillations and determining the percentage of cells displaying transient, transient sustained, and transient oscillatory responses to progesterone, we found no correlation between spontaneous Ca2+ oscillations and an oscillatory Ca2+ component in response to progesterone.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nHere we report a new, simple, and practical technique to monitor the progression of AR in human sperm in real time. The use of the fluorescent dye FM4-64 allows monitoring of morphological membrane changes during the AR and has revealed the appearance of tubular structures in the sperm head along this reaction. Furthermore, the combined use of FM4-64 and Fluo-4 allows the concomitant recording of AR and [Ca2+]i in a single human spermatozoon. Our findings suggest that spontaneous and progesterone-induced [Ca2+]i oscillations determine AR potential in human spermatozoa. Notably, our alternate observations of the progesterone-induced AR and [Ca2+]i changes have revealed that a second [Ca2+]i increase precedes AR and the loss of Fluo-4 fluorescence (see , B–D).\n\nFM4-64 has been used extensively to monitor secretion in several cell types [17 –20], but had not been conceived as a reporter of AR. Validation was accomplished by correlating its fluorescence with that of FITC-PSA, and by their dependence on the presence of extracellular Ca2+, which is anticipated in all exocytotic processes, such as the AR. FITC-PSA uptake appears to be slightly delayed with respect to FM4-64 fluorescence increase, suggesting that the latter is able to enter the acrosome through the first fenestrations generated at the beginning of the AR. FITC-PSA diffuses and binds to glycosylated proteins contained in the acrosome [8], whereas FM4-64, in addition to diffusing, associates to membranes in general [20], so it is likely labeling the inner plasma membrane and acrosomal membranes as fusion begins during AR. Part of the inner acrosomal membrane becomes the plasma membrane of the acrosome-reacted spermatozoon. In this respect, it could be considered as a region equivalent to the secretion vesicle in somatic cells. FM4-64 can be used to label and observe human spermatozoa for up to 30 min, with minimal effects on sperm viability evaluated with SG. The percentage of viable human sperm after exposure to FM4-64 during AR-inducing experimental conditions is similar to that reported in other studies [13, 14].\n\nOur findings with FM4-64 indicate that AR does not initiate in the same region in every spermatozoon, as previous reports of real-time AR detection have revealed in human and mouse spermatozoa [13, 24]. With the strong AR inductor ionomycin, this reaction initiates with no preference regarding the AP or LAT sperm head region. In contrast, AR induced by a more physiological stimulus like progesterone typically starts at the AP region of the sperm head. A similar conclusion was reached in mouse spermatozoa regarding the starting point of AR promoted by either zona pellucida (ZP) or a Ca2+ ionophore [24].\n\nFM4-64 imaging lacks enough spatial resolution to discern acrosomal membrane vesiculation, as it has been observed with electronic microscopy [25]. This is probably due to spatial limitations of conventional optical microscopy. However, we were able to discern novel structural changes in the plasma membrane during and after the triggering of AR, which were corroborated using SEM. Particularly interesting was the emergence of tubular membrane structures (resembling filopodia) from different areas of the sperm head in response to progesterone after AR initiated. Previous studies in guinea pig spermatozoa using electron microscopy reported the presence of sheets of hybrid membranes forming tubules or filaments associated with the luminal surface of the residual outer acrosomal membrane during the AR [26]. Moreover, an earlier study reported the presence of filaments closely resembling the membrane appendages observed in our study, which extended from the head of pig spermatozoa and were observed by phase-contrast microscopy. Interestingly, these structures were observed in spermatozoa embedded in the ZP layer, suggesting they may have a role in approaching the egg and penetrating it [27]. We believe that these tubular membrane structures have seldom been reported because they are difficult to observe with light microscopy, and because a membrane dye such as FM4-64 has not been used before to monitor AR in real time. The resemblance and coincidences between our results and previous studies lead us to think that these appendages are not an artifact and could have a physiological role during spermatozoa-egg interactions [27]. We believe that FM4-64 represents an excellent tool to further examine the involvement of these structures in sperm progression and navigation towards the egg in future studies.\n\nFor many years ZP has been considered the physiological inductor of the AR [28]. However, recent studies in transgenic mice have shown that spermatozoa underwent AR before contacting the ZP during in vitro fertilization of cumulus-egg complexes [12]. Alternatively, progesterone, which exists at micromolar concentrations in the cumulus oophorus, has been proposed as a physiological inductor of AR. This is consistent with the notion that the AR is strictly Ca2+ dependent and that progesterone directly activates the cation channels of sperm (CatSper), the only Ca2+-permeable channel recorded by patch clamp in human spermatozoa so far [5, 29]. Progesterone may stimulate further Ca2+ uptake by alternate pathways [30] because the human sperm AR is only partially inhibited by CatSper blockers [31] and spermatozoa from CatSper knockout mice are still able to undergo this reaction [32]. Taking into account these considerations, we used progesterone to induce AR in human spermatozoa.\n\nWhen the time courses of the progesterone-induced AR detected with FM4-64 or using fixed spermatozoa are compared, important differences are revealed. From the sperm undergoing AR, the FM4-64 signal indicates ∼40% of the cells reacted 5 min after progesterone addition. In contrast, in this time, close to 80% of sperm underwent AR in fixed spermatozoa assayed with FITC-PSA staining [4]. This discrepancy could indicate an overestimation of AR, possibly due to difficulties establishing the condition of the acrosome and the extent of cell death in fixed cells. Differences also exist regarding the correlation between the type of [Ca2+]i increase pattern and the progesterone-induced AR. In our experiments ∼20% of the reacting sperm underwent AR after the first [Ca2+]i transient increase whereas close to 40% acrosome reacted when fixed spermatozoa were examined at different times after progesterone application [4]. In contrast, our results are in agreement with a previous report where the sudden loss of Fluo-3 fluorescence was used as a real-time AR indicator [15]. Our data show that unreacted spermatozoa that sometime later will undergo AR display a transitory-sustained response pattern (also called biphasic response). This observation fits well with a previous quantification of AR in real time [15]. The discrepancies discussed above indicate that it is preferable to measure continuously in time both the AR and [Ca2+]i to adequately examine any possible correlation between them.\n\nIt is well established that a [Ca2+]i increase is necessary for the spermatozoon to achieve AR [1]. Previous efforts to correlate [Ca2+]i changes and AR were carried out in bovine spermatozoa using time-lapse phase-contrast microscopy, following stimulation with solubilized ZP [9]. In human spermatozoa, AR was elicited and then quantified in fixed spermatozoa [4, 9]. However, to our knowledge, no previous study succeeded in concomitant and independently measuring [Ca2+]i changes and AR extent continuously in time in individual spermatozoa. A previous investigation determining [Ca2+]i/AR in real time using Fluo-3 [15] did not reveal details about the relation between [Ca2+]i and the AR because Fluo-3 fluorescence was used for both purposes.\n\nConcomitant analysis of the progesterone-induced [Ca2+]i and AR changes determined here independently in single human spermatozoa indicates that neither the amplitude of the first [Ca2+]i transient nor its total area under the curve resolves whether or not AR is triggered. These observations are similar to those obtained in human spermatozoa where AR was measured using fixed cells [4]. However, analysis of the correlation between [Ca2+]i patterns and AR reveals that the transitory oscillatory [Ca2+]i pattern promoted by progesterone inhibits AR. Notably, closer examination of these recordings also unveiled the presence of a second [Ca2+]i increase (named “second Ca2+ peak”) occurring after the well-known progesterone transient [Ca2+]i. The presence of the second Ca2+ peak is the signal to initiate the AR in >90% of reacting spermatozoa. The sperm second Ca2+ peak resembles the [Ca2+]i increase reported in neuroendocrine cells, where [Ca2+]i reaches a ∼10 μM threshold for triggering hormonal secretion [33]. An alternative explanation for the second Ca2+ peak could be the influx of external Ca2+ through fusion pores generated during AR initiation. The time resolution of our experiments allowed determining that the second Ca2+ peak occurs several seconds before the AR, as assayed by FM4-64 fluorescence. However, faster [Ca2+]i imaging acquisition will be necessary to examine in detail the time delay, the path through which Ca2+ enters causing the second peak, and the molecular events that precede AR. It is worth pointing out that we also found that an important proportion of spermatozoa (∼40%) show a slow Ca2+ rise ∼2 min before the progesterone-induced AR. In neuroendocrine cells, a subthreshold [Ca2+]i facilitates the proper docking of secretory granules before their fusion [34]. Given the similarity between some molecular events that occur during AR spermatozoa and exocytosis in somatic cells [16, 35] one can imagine that the slow Ca2+ rise could facilitate AR. However, some spermatozoa do not display a slow Ca2+ rise prior to reacting. Perhaps their [Ca2+]i reaches the threshold needed to induce AR after one or two [Ca2+]i peaks. As the [Ca2+]i signal that precedes AR is a necessary step for the reaction to occur, it will be important to determine the molecular nature of the transport systems involved, to further elucidate how the AR is triggered.\n\nOur findings showed that close to 30% of human spermatozoa display spontaneous [Ca2+]i oscillations. We found that the majority (98% ± 2%) of spermatozoa undergoing spontaneous [Ca2+]i oscillations prior to the progesterone addition fail to progress to the AR. These observations lead us to consider that perhaps some unknown cell condition associated with these [Ca2+]i oscillations could preclude untimely AR. Thus the mechanisms that control Ca2+ oscillations in human sperm could be crucial to determine the state of the spermatozoa previous to the AR. As spermatozoa have to deal with [Ca2+]i increases during their preparation to fertilize the egg, such as those occurring during capacitation and hyperactivation [36 –38], it is important that these [Ca2+]i increases do not trigger AR prematurely. Therefore, the generation of spontaneous [Ca2+]i oscillations and their termination could be a signal to regulate when the AR must occur. The [Ca2+]i oscillations triggered by progesterone in human spermatozoa have been well characterized [21, 39, 40], and are not drastically altered by Ca2+ channel blockers [21], but modified by ryanodine [39], suggesting that a capacitative Ca2+ entry could be involved in their regulation. Capacitative Ca2+ entry sensitive to ryanodine results from Ca2+ emptying of intracellular stores in various somatic cell types [41]. Considering that the presence of both spontaneous and progesterone-induced [Ca2+]i oscillations reduces AR, it will be necessary in future studies to perform their detailed analysis and compare their pharmacology to determine if they reduce AR probability by the same mechanism(s).\n\nWe recently reported that mouse spermatogenic cells undergo spontaneous [Ca2+]i oscillations that are abolished when the extracellular Ca2+ concentration is low (∼5 μM), and partially inhibited by CaV3 Ca2+ channel blockers and Ni2+ [42]. However, in mature spermatozoa, the spontaneous [Ca2+]i fluctuations have not been well characterized [21, 23]. In hamster sperm their presence has been related to flagellar beating [43]. It would be very important to fully characterize these [Ca2+]i signals in human sperm to determine not only the underlying Ca2+ mobilization mechanisms but also their modes of regulation and how they behave during sperm capacitation.\n\nIn summary, here we describe and validate a new methodology that allows the concomitant and independent recording in real time of the dynamics of [Ca2+]i and the structural membrane changes that accompany the AR in live single human spermatozoa. This methodology can also be applied to study these phenomena in mouse spermatozoa (not shown). Improvements in spatial and temporal resolution of this technique make it an attractive tool to broaden our understanding of the mechanisms involved and the physiological ligand(s) of the AR, matters that are currently debated. FM4-64 staining unveiled the emergence of tubular appendages in the human sperm head during the AR. These structures had never been observed in real time before, and, together with the AR, they could participate in the final steps of sperm-egg interaction. Future studies should examine in detail the role of these structures in fertilization. Finally, our recordings of AR and [Ca2+]i in real time indicate that a second [Ca2+]i increase induced by progesterone usually occurs in human spermatozoa that will undergo AR and that the presence of [Ca2+]i oscillations, both spontaneous as well as induced by progesterone, may prevent untimely AR. It now becomes of utmost importance to understand the nature of this second [Ca2+]i elevation; might it be related to the crucial efflux of Ca2+ from internal stores proposed to be necessary for AR [16, 44]?"
