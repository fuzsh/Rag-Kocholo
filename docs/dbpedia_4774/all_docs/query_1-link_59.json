        "text": "The 50 Best BBQ Joints2021\n\nThere's a new generation of Texas pitmasters in town, many of whom aren't satisfied with doing things the same old way. (Though fear not, staunch traditionalists: many are.)\n\nJust a decade ago, Texans took our state’s basic barbecue meal for granted. It was the sacred trinity of brisket, pork spareribs, and sausage, served with potato salad, coleslaw, and beans on the side. The biggest decision diners had to make was whether they wanted ice cream with their peach cobbler. The lineup seemed as fixed as the brick barbecue pits in which the meats were smoked.\n\nAnd it wasn’t just the menu that was unchanging. Places and personalities seemed perennial as well. Two of the many truths we held to be self-evident were these: Lockhart was the unchallenged capital of Texas barbecue, and Snow’s BBQ, in Lexington, and Franklin Barbecue, in Austin, were the best joints in the state. That pair of enormously admired institutions captured the number one and two spots on Texas Monthly’s 2013 and 2017 lists of the fifty best barbecue joints (Snow’s also ranked first in 2008, before Franklin opened). They epitomized old-school Texas barbecue at its finest. Aspiring and veteran pitmasters alike visited them as if they were shrines.\n\nBut in the past half decade or so, we’ve begun to notice that the winds of change are growing quite gusty. In cities and towns across the state, new joints have been opening, and young, ambitious pitmasters have been getting into the game. Because they’ve been inspired by Texas’s long and storied barbecue tradition, the Texas trinity still dominates, and brisket has only gotten more popular (and expensive). That said, the upstarts have lots of new ideas.\n\nWhat distinguishes the Texas barbecue scene today? In a word: surprises. In another word: variety. We’re talking bacon burnt ends, beef cheeks, birria, blueberry-and-Gouda sausage, brisket-topped elote, and guava-glazed pork ribs. And those are just the meat offerings. Side dishes and desserts range as far afield as Big Red tres leches cake, blistered brussels sprouts, carrot soufflé, citrus-beet salad, and brisket fried rice. And we haven’t even gotten to the wine lists.\n\nAs you would expect at a time of transformation, compiling our Top 50 list was a challenge. Even we were shocked by some of the changes we felt compelled to make. The former lodestars in our firmament, Snow’s and Franklin, no longer occupy our first or second spots (though both made the top ten and are absolutely worth visiting). For the first time, sadly, no Lockhart joints made the list (though the venerated Kreuz Market does appear in our Honorable Mentions). But the flip side of those descents is that Texas barbecue boasts an exciting freshman class: 29 of the 50 entries are new to the list, including the rookie establishment that vaulted to our number one spot.\n\nIn short, if you were hoping for an argument that innovation is getting out of hand and it’s time to retrench and return to the simpler days of barbecue, you won’t find it here. But have no fear: if you’re an old-school stalwart who blanches at the thought of smoked cauliflower, plenty of places on our list will make you very happy.\n\nIs Texas barbecue losing its soul, as some might fear? No. The staples aren’t going anywhere, and the rising generation of pitmasters prepares them as well as—and often better than—anyone ever has. The up-and-comers aren’t erasing anything; they’re adding to what we have and paying tribute to our culinary heritage by reinvigorating it.\n\nWelcome to the brave new era of Texas barbecue. The best is yet to come.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n10\n\nPhotographs by Arturo Olmos\n\nFort Worth\n\nPanther City BBQ\n\nCopy link\n\n10\n\nFriends Chris Magallanes and Ernest Morales, who worked together in the audiovisual world, won an amateur barbecue competition and, fortunately for the rest of us, let it go to their heads. A few years ago, they quit their jobs and opened a food truck outside Republic Street Bar, in Fort Worth’s vibrant Near Southside neighborhood. Now the truck is gone in favor of a permanent space that includes a covered patio. Massive yet tender spareribs are glazed with sweet barbecue sauce, while the moist smoked turkey has a spicy kick. House-made sausages burst with juice, and the pork belly burnt ends, now a Cowtown barbecue staple, are sweet, sticky, fatty morsels that eat like meat candy. Even more over-the-top are the pork belly poppers: burnt ends stuffed inside jalapeño halves along with a bit of cream cheese, then wrapped in bacon. The sensation of biting through the crisp bacon into the meltingly tender cube of pork and fat beneath is pure heaven. But the showstopper is the brisket elote. Layers of creamed corn, chopped brisket, queso fresco, cilantro, and hot sauce are a full meal in a cup. Don’t miss the borracho beans or the collard greens, and although we’re die-hard banana pudding lovers, we prefer the Nutter Butter cheesecake pudding.\n\n201 E. Hattie, Fort Worth; 682-499-5618; Sun & Wed 11–2, Thur–Sat 11–5\n\n9\n\nPhotographs by Mackenzie Smith Kelley\n\nLexington\n\nSnow’s BBQ\n\nCopy link\n\n9\n\nWhen it opened eighteen years ago, Snow’s was a secret known mainly to hardy locals who rose early on Saturdays to attend the weekly cattle auction in the Central Texas town of Lexington (population 1,200). Those peaceful days came to an abrupt halt in 2008, when this magazine ranked the tiny, rustic place number one on our Top 50 list. The renown that followed sparked 45-minute waits in line—just ask “Joe from Wisconsin”—and turned Snow’s expert pitmaster Tootsie Tomanetz into a barbecue celebrity. Her grandmotherly face drew national media coverage, and in 2013 and 2017, Snow’s made our top two again. But it wasn’t until 2020, when the Netflix series Chef ’s Table: BBQ aired a moving and beautifully shot tribute, that Snow’s fame truly went global. Now barbecue hounds hailing from Guatemala to Kenya sleep in lawn chairs under the property’s trees on Friday nights to be first in line the next morning. If they’re lucky, they might get to snap a picture with Tomanetz, skilled co-pitmaster Clay Cowgill, or affable owners Kerry and Kim Bexley. Those devotees are rewarded with smoked meats as good as any in the country, along with a traditional lineup of sides and banana pudding for dessert. So why, then, has Snow’s slipped a few spots down on our list? For the same reason Franklin has: as much as we love the place, the Texas barbecue game has changed profoundly. And that’s not a bad thing at all.\n\n516 Main, Lexington; 979-773-4640; Sat 8–sold out\n\n8\n\nPhotographs by Jeff Wilson\n\nWolfforth\n\nEvie Mae’s Pit Barbeque\n\nCopy link\n\n8\n\nBefore they turned their attention to the culinary arts, Arnis and Mallory Robbins ran a landscaping company in Arizona. They went from cutting grass to cutting some of the best meat in the state when their food truck opened outside Lubbock six years ago. Evie Mae’s moved into an actual building a year later and is now the crown jewel of West Texas barbecue. Don’t be intimidated by the long line—it moves fast. Instead, grab a free beer from the cooler and peruse the desserts on display. Strawberry cake, Texas sheet cake, and no fewer than two versions of pecan pie are available most days. Beef ribs sell out quickly, but you’ll be just as satisfied with the fatty brisket, especially the decadent burnt ends. Saucy pork ribs have gotten trendy, so we appreciate the more subtle seasoning on these perfectly smoked St. Louis–cut ribs. The same could be said of the German smoked sausage. Yes, there’s a spicy, cheesy version too, but the original is bursting with flavor and has the perfect snap, no gimmicks needed. For sides, fresh green beans and green-chile cheese grits are hard to beat, though you shouldn’t ignore the cornbread. For a change of pace, look for the occasional smoked prime rib dinners (so popular you’ll need a reservation). And if you’re in the market for a massive new smoker, Arnis will weld one for you in his shop next door.\n\n217 U.S. 62, Wolfforth; 806-782-2281; Wed–Sat 11–sold out\n\n7\n\nPhotographs by Mackenzie Smith Kelley\n\nAustin\n\nFranklin Barbecue\n\nCopy link\n\n7\n\nThe ebony-hued bark on the fatty brisket is heavy with pepper and beyond caramelized. The glossy pork ribs are a thing of beauty. The sweet, pink pulled pork could star in a holiday picnic. As for the homemade sides—classic potato salad, slaw, and pinto beans—tradition rules. Same with desserts (individual pies such as pecan and key lime), baked by a local purveyor. After twelve years in business, Franklin Barbecue still has the magic, thanks to fanatical smoke master Aaron Franklin, who doesn’t really cook much anymore but supervises all smoking operations. The charismatic native Texan made his mark on the Austin scene in 2009, achieving rock-star status and inspiring young, urban would-be pitmasters statewide. So popular was his little joint that three-hour waits in line were routine. In 2013 and 2017, it captured the number one and number two spots, respectively, on our Top 50 list. But even as the Franklin phenomenon continued unabated—he wrote two cookbooks, won a James Beard Award, and helped start an Austin food and music festival—the newcomers were busy introducing novel dishes, drawing inspiration from far afield, and becoming agents of change themselves. Franklin’s drop into the bottom half of our top ten isn’t a sign that the beloved establishment has diminished—no one does the traditional barbecue lineup better. But it is a sign that the new wave is reshaping the scene in ways we couldn’t have imagined a few short years ago.\n\n900 E. 11th, Austin; 512-653-1187; Order online (minimum 3 pounds) and pick up Tue–Sun 10:30–2\n\nAdvertisement\n\n6\n\nPhotographs by Brittany Conerly\n\nDallas\n\nCattleack Barbeque\n\nCopy link\n\n6\n\nCattleack owners Todd and Misty David clearly respect barbecue tradition: they covered an outside wall with murals of modern pioneers such as Aaron Franklin, Wayne Mueller, and Tootsie Tomanetz. But the Davids are making their own way in the meat world, cooking dishes such as beef bologna, spicy beef boudin, and Wagyu pastrami ribs, which are so big that the bright red meat seems to wave from the bone like a flag. The specials go fast, so get here early if you want anything beyond the standard menu (which, for the record, is hardly a consolation prize). The many varieties of house-made sausages are impeccably crafted, as is the Wagyu brisket, which exhibits the perfect balance of smoke, seasoning, and beefy flavor. The pulled pork is sui generis for Texas because the Davids bought a North Carolina whole hog cooker; the result is tangy, moist, and richer than meat taken just from the shoulder. It’s available daily, and each serving is topped with cracklins. The large dining room, with its friendly vibe and many photos of loyal customers, exudes confidence and conviviality.\n\n13628 Gamma Rd, Dallas; 972-805-0999; Thur & Fri 10:30–2, first Sat of the month 10:30–2\n\n5\n\nPhotographs by Mackenzie Smith Kelley\n\nAustin\n\nLeRoy and Lewis Barbecue\n\nCopy link\n\n5\n\nA pretty, tree-shaded gravel courtyard that’s home to a coffee shop filled with Austinites on laptops is the improbable location of a food truck serving up some of the best ’cue in the state. The joint’s ethos is aptly summed up in its slogan: “New School BBQ, Old School Service.” At LeRoy and Lewis, the new-school approach means Evan LeRoy eschews pork ribs (though on Saturdays he does offer “bacon ribs”—massive pork ribs with the belly still attached) and turkey (except around Thanksgiving) and serves brisket only on Saturdays and Sundays. (Said brisket is Akaushi, by the way, and a good reason for a weekend visit.) The regular offerings are excellent, though, two of the best being glistening, succulent smoked barbacoa and luxurious sliced beef cheeks. There’s also pulled whole hog and salty whole hog sausage with a handmade, country look. Also on tap: unusual sides such as sassy kimchi, vinegary braised cabbage and sausage, and terrific pork hash (a.k.a. rice with a meaty gravy). If you don’t have room after all that, know that the cheddar cheesecake with a dab of apple butter is worth a return visit. Serious backyard cooks can sign up online for a weekend at “New School BBQ University” ($1,500, though there’s also a more affordable option of online videos), where they’ll learn techniques such as the foil-boat wrap method, which produces a magnificently crunchy crust on the brisket. Many of the classes take place at Cosmic Coffee + Beer Garden, where the truck has been parked since it opened, four years ago.\n\n121 Pickle Rd, Austin; 512-945-9882; Wed–Sun 11–9\n\n4\n\nPhotographs by Mackenzie Smith Kelley\n\nSeguin\n\nBurnt Bean Co.\n\nCopy link\n\n4\n\nWe were standing well back in line for a late lunch at Burnt Bean when one of the owners stepped outside to deliver bad news: “Folks, I’m afraid we’re going to run out of brisket in about ten people.” His warning proved correct. We thanked him for his courtesy and vowed to return, considerably earlier, the next day. That’s typical of the thoughtful service you get at this sterling addition to the Central Texas barbecue pantheon. The attractively remodeled commercial building, with bare brick walls and sky-high ceilings, is the perfect place to savor brisket with an impressively thick crust covering a thin layer of translucent fat. The pork ribs are beauts too, with great texture and just a hint of sweetness. Listen as you bite into the coarse-ground sausage: you’ll hear a satisfying snap. Barbecue fans who walk on the mild side will be grateful for the exceptional smoked turkey breast, and big groups will be thrilled with the variety of sides, including the gently seasoned cowboy beans (soupy in the good old-fashioned way) and the excellent street corn pudding. At the end of the long, efficiently run counter, you’ll find an array of Instagrammable desserts. If you must choose between the Big Red tres leches cake and the chocolate cake with fudgy icing, go with the second (though it’s not available every day). And check the chalkboard for daily features, such as the huge, gloriously fatty pork steak we had one Thursday.\n\n108 S. Austin, Seguin; 830-609-7189; Thur–Sat 11–3, Sun 8–3\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3\n\nPhotographs by Arturo Olmos\n\nHouston\n\nTruth Barbeque\n\nCopy link\n\n3\n\nThe Heights neighborhood, in Houston, is packed with outstanding barbecue joints, but Truth (which opened its first outlet in Brenham in 2015) is transcendent. It starts with a homey atmosphere and staff who are both knowledgeable and helpful—no rushing customers through the long line here. The combination of both unconventional and classic sides makes it hard to choose (or not) between corn pudding and creamed spinach or potato salad and pinto beans. Swoon-worthy cakes are made by head pitmaster Leonard Botello’s mom, Janel, and head baker Laquita Wilkins. The three layers of the intense chocolate cake are best separated before eating, lest you devour the entire massive slice in one sitting. A selection of sauces adorns each table, from a spicy red to a vinegary mustard that pops like a hangover remedy. But we digress from the meat. Smoked by Botello and his crew, the ribs have a beet-red, satiny exterior, the perfect counterpoint to the sweet, succulent interior, which can definitely go sauce-free. Ditto the brisket, with its deep, peppery crust and just the right measure of glossy fat to bring out the best in the lush, smoky beef. Botello’s niche specialties are bold as well. Chunks of smoked brisket are stuffed into the Cajun-inspired burnt-end boudin (limited availability daily) and served with house-made hot sauce.

But not for the aptly named InterStellar BBQ. Pit boss John Bates acquired a fine-dining pedigree at Austin institutions Wink and Asti, and he brings that experience and, yes, ambition to bear in everything he offers, which is why InterStellar has quickly risen to destination status. The tidy, agreeable joint is located in a massive strip mall, so just circle the parking lot until you see the two smokers. The larger one is where Bates cooks his most popular meats. The secret to his brisket is simple: salt, pepper, garlic, and obsessive heat management. For his pork ribs, he eschews the usual glaze but, knowing diners expect a little sweetness, adds brown sugar to the rub. He also smokes what he calls the Tipsy Turkey Breast, which marinates overnight in hefeweizen. The smaller smoker is reserved for experiments such as pork belly doused with a peach-tea glaze and an onion stuffed with chopped brisket, a hat tip to Bates’s dad, who threw an onion on the campfire every time he cooked outdoors. As for sides, the usual trio is rounded out with striking additions such as a tomato-and-zucchini salad and scalloped potatoes with a toasted-Parmesan crust. Our nominee for must-try dessert? The Mexican-hot-chocolate rice pudding.\n\n12233 RR 620 N., Austin; 512-382-6248; Wed–Sun 11–5\n\n1\n\nPhotographs by Arturo Olmos\n\nFort Worth\n\nGoldee’s Barbecue\n\nCopy link\n\n1\n\nLast year a few young pitmasters joined forces to take an abandoned building on the southeast side of Fort Worth and create their ideal of a modern barbecue joint. Though they lacked the decades of experience typical of many top-flight cooks, this band of barbecue wunderkinder had worked at some of the best joints in Texas (Franklin, La Barbecue, Micklethwait, Valentina’s). But just after opening, in February 2020, the dining room was forced to shut down because of the coronavirus pandemic. Goldee’s barely hung on as a take-out operation until this April, when it fully reopened. (When we recently joked to Jonny White that they should be selling more than fifteen briskets a day—compared with the hundred or so at Franklin—he replied, “It’s better than the four a day we were selling last May.”) So, what shot this modest joint into our top spot? Simply put, food that’s close to perfection. During repeated visits, we searched for weaknesses and inconsistencies, only to find, again and again, the state’s best spareribs and spectacular sausage and brisket. While many places have come to rely on the common crutches of excess—too much salt on the brisket, too much sugar on the ribs—Goldee’s demonstrates a confident restraint that belies the pitmasters’ youth. They trust the meat and the smoke more than an arsenal of seasonings. That attention doesn’t waver when it comes to sides, especially the peppery cheese grits and the mustard-heavy pork hash. And then there are culinary surprises such as Nupohn Inthanousay’s Laotian sausage: take a chunk, mash it into a bit of sticky rice, and dunk the combo into the spicy-sour jeow som sauce. Your eyes will open wide as you gaze at the new horizons of Texas barbecue.\n\n4645 Dick Price Rd, Fort Worth; 817-480-4131; Fri–Sun 11–sold out\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Rest of the Best\n\nArlington\n\nHurtado Barbecue\n\nCopy link\n\nThe menu at this joint that serves “Central Texas–style barbecue with a Tex-Mex twist” includes such unusual fare as pork belly burnt ends and quail. If you can’t make up your mind, order the El Jefe Platter, a sampling of six meats that includes tender brisket, sweetly glazed pork ribs, and very juicy turkey. If you’re feeling more adventurous, the Big Red barbacoa tostada delivers smoked beef cheeks braised in the Waco-born soft drink and topped with beef-tallow refried beans, salsa verde, Valentina hot sauce, cotija cheese, cilantro, and raw white onions. The desserts rotate; if you get a chance, try the Mexican bread pudding garnished with pork belly burnt ends. Plan for a nap.\n\n205 E.

When owner and pitmaster Damien Brockway first opened his truck, in late February, brisket wasn’t on the menu (he preferred beef chuck). But that’s changed. Distant Relatives now serves up flavorful brisket with smoked-mustard butter, as well as pork spareribs and pulled pork. The “modern African American” menu is Brockway’s interpretation of dishes from various African American cuisines, such as black-eyed peas, which originated in West Africa and are a part of New Year’s traditions in the South. In this hearty version, the beans are cooked with burnt ends. A standout item is the juicy, well-seasoned chicken leg quarters. Small but impressive upgrades—such as toasted slices of Pullman sourdough instead of generic white bread—seal the deal.\n\n3901 Promontory Point Dr, Austin; 512-717-2504; Wed–Sun noon–8 or sold out ; distatantrelativesatx.com\n\nPhotographs by Mackenzie Smith Kelley\n\nAustin\n\nLa Barbecue\n\nCopy link\n\nAfter almost a decade of hopping around East Austin in various food trucks (and sharing a space with a high-end convenience store), La Barbecue has found a permanent home. The new digs are covered in artwork that ranges from the sentimental, like the painting of LeAnn’s mother, Trish (she helped run Louie Mueller Barbecue, in Taylor, with LeAnn’s father, the late Bobby Mueller), to the eclectic, like a T. rex snacking on anthropomorphic sausages. If, like that dinosaur, you crave sausage, you’ll want to try the original, jalapeño, and chipotle versions. They go great with the spicy dill pickles, and it’s hard to beat the flavor combination of a La Barbecue brisket burnt end and a forkful of the sweet-pepper-and-cucumber kimchi. As for pure comfort food, don’t miss the classic shells and cheese or the Japanese-inspired sausage-and-brisket chili.\n\n2401 E.

Though any visitor to Beaumont should sample the region’s meaty specialties, such as beef links and smoked boudin, 1701 offers the best brisket and pork ribs in southeast Texas. The juicy brisket sports a thick crust, and the pork ribs are just sweet enough. The turkey isn’t to be missed either.

The menu varies day to day (though sausage, turkey, brisket, and ribs are always available), but you’ll be satisfied no matter what they have. To wit: the Wednesday we ventured over, we opted for the phenomenal char siu banh mi, smoky Gouda mac and cheese, a piquant jalapeño coleslaw, and the knockout brisket fried rice. Even after calling it a day, we’d already started dreaming of coming back to try the guava-glazed ribs or smoked brisket loco moco, a Hawaiian staple consisting of a brisket burger patty, a fried egg, and gravy made from smoked brisket trimmings on a mountain of white rice.\n\n5425 Bellaire Blvd, Bellaire; 713-664-7776; Wed–Sun 11–3 or sold out (dinner is available Thursdays) ; bloodbrosbbq.com\n\nBelton\n\nMiller’s Smokehouse\n\nCopy link\n\nMiller’s Smokehouse sits right at the crossroads of old-school and new-school Texas barbecue. The restaurant—a sleekly renovated building—looks at first like just another iteration of trendy food-concept design, with its concrete floors and exposed ductwork. But Miller’s represents decades of slow growth. Its first briskets, in true Central Texas style, were cooked in a small smoker in the alley beside the family’s taxidermy shop, and the pies still come mostly from family recipes baked by the matriarch, “Momma” Miller, and her team. The meat, however, is the true testament to old-school barbecue cred. There are a handful of departures from the Texas trinity, but the brisket is the star, with a nice black crust that gives way to fat that’s been rendered almost to butter.\n\n300 E.

By the time we made it to the counter, Matt Lowery himself was slicing brisket at a rapid pace (he’d already sold out of ribs). We walked to the table with a plate of meats and a side we were particularly excited about: the brisket mac and cheese. Buttery in texture and color, with a truly cheesy flavor, the mac could have stood alone. But with a generous serving of chopped brisket atop it? We would have been happy with that as our whole meal. The sliced brisket was also a dream, boasting a beautiful smoke ring, well-peppered bark, and melty fat. The sausage was juicy, with a casing that snapped immediately and then gave way to the sweet and salty flavor of its dense interior. The turkey delighted too, packing a bit of peppery punch. And the house-made barbecue sauce was distinctive: a little sweet, undeniably tangy, and more smoky than peppery. We took one lick of the brownish-red dollop we’d squirted onto our plates and decided we could drink it.\n\n1407 W.

If you’ve come to this joint, the last in the state allowed to cook its meat in an underground pit, you surely aren’t there for standard Middle American fare. The brisket may not be top-notch, but it’s worth trying when wrapped in a tortilla and topped with salsa verde, and the carnitas are tender and satiating. The real draw, though, is the barbacoa de cabeza; Vera’s serves every part of the cow’s head. Even the least adventurous will enjoy the cheek (cachete), and the more adventurous can try tongue (lengua) and eyes (ojos).

When a family-owned building came up for sale in Crockett, they decamped for a return to small-town life and opened Mimsy’s, named after Wade’s great-grandmother. His Central Texas–style smoked meats and links (such as boudin made with brisket) are the perfect partner for Kathy’s elevated sides (mac and cheese made with smoked queso and poblanos) and specials (shrimp and grits), all of which are enriched by the rustic atmosphere of a former ice-making warehouse.\n\n1979 S. 5th, Crockett; 936-544-7000; Tue & Wed 11–3, Thur–Sat 11–8 ; mimsyscraftbbq.com\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDallas\n\nSlow Bone\n\nCopy link\n\nDuring a recent weekday lunch visit, we joined the many dude duos who had crowded the parking lot with their vehicles. “You spend your whole life trying to figure your wife out,” we heard one man say to another; others were eating in reverent silence. In line, we’d asked pitmaster Jeffery Hobbs what the specialty was. “Well, we’re kinda known for all of it,” he said. We thought it was a standard marketing line from a proud meat dad until we tried all of it. The sausage and turkey were heavily smoky; neither needed the sauce, which was deep red and not too sweet, but they were both perfect vessels for it. The pork ribs were rich and peppery, and the meat clung to the bone in just the right fashion. As for the brisket, we ordered from the fatty side and were surprised by how well the crust hung onto the meat in spite of the layer of fat between the two. Upon our first bite, we let out a vulgar little moan.\n\n2234 Irving Blvd, Dallas; 214-377-7727; Daily, 11–2:30 ; slowbone.com\n\nPhotographs by Brittany Conerly\n\nDallas\n\nSmokey Joe’s BBQ\n\nCopy link\n\nSince Joe Melton and Kenneth Manning opened Smokey Joe’s in the mid-eighties and later passed it on to Manning’s son Kris, the joint has smartly adapted to the evolution of Texas barbecue.

Even better is the Maxi, a sandwich with sliced sausage and chopped brisket, whose rough, inky-black bark is nicely juxtaposed with a pink-hued smoke ring. The meat is then topped with thick pickle disks and served in a soft, buttery bun. Finish with a slice of the luscious, scratch-made sweet potato pie.\n\n6403 S. R. L.

We carefully carried our grease-soaked bundle of butcher paper to our table outside, as if it were a little meat baby, then tore into it with animal vigor. We’d visited multiple joints already that day, but we finished nearly everything. The brisket was covered in so much pepper it was almost spicy, but not so much that it distracted from the smokiness of the meat. Even the turkey, the pitfall of many a pitmaster, was a win: the exterior was crispy, but the meat’s moistness wasn’t compromised at all.\n\n3025 Main, Dallas; 469-399-0081; Mon–Thur 11–9, Fri & Sat 10:30–9:30, Sun 10:30–9 ; terryblacksbbq.com\n\nEl Paso\n\nDesert Oak Barbecue\n\nCopy link\n\nDesert Oak’s plastic utensils hint at how tender the meat is.

Virginia, Port Lavaca; 361-894-2333; Sun, Thur & Fri 11–2, Sat 11–8 ; lavacabbq.com\n\nRockdale\n\nBrett’s Backyard Bar-B-Que\n\nCopy link\n\nThe offerings are piled high at Brett’s, which serves some of the most indulgent craft barbecue in Central Texas. From an extensive menu—baby back ribs, pork spareribs, chicken, brisket, pulled pork, four kinds of sausages, sandwiches, nine sides, dessert—a single plate can arrive with enough food to feed multiple mouths. The spot is known for brisket that is so tender and rich that even a few bites feel like enough. The Sunday special doesn’t disappoint either: slices of brisket wrapped in fluffy tortillas and topped with cotija cheese, jalapeños, and a squeeze of lime—a spot-on pairing of oak-infused fat and tangy spice. This festive, largely outdoor joint features a dining area with a stage for live music.\n\n449 W.

These pilgrims have come from all over for brisket with a spicy bark and a fine balance of smoky and beefy flavor that’s so tender it accordions open when you lift a slice. Pitmaster Ramos honed his skills at Austin’s La Barbecue but has brought his own style to 2M. One of his sausages is stuffed with serrano peppers and Oaxaca cheese, and the sides are similarly distinctive: pickled nopales, mac and cheese with chicharrones, and Mexican street corn.\n\n2731 S.

You smell the smoke first, of course, and then you see pile upon pile of neatly stacked wood. Next comes the music: strains of the Texas Tornados’ “(Hey Baby) Que Paso” greeted us as we joined a long line of diners. By the time we made our way inside, our taste buds were primed. They were rewarded with decadently glazed “candy paint” pork ribs, snappy jalapeño-cheese sausage, and brisket that disappeared so quickly we regretted ordering only half a pound. A classic mustard potato salad and a lightly sauced red-cabbage slaw rounded out the tray, along with a divine smoked bread pudding (if it had any smoke, we couldn’t detect it). The hunting lodge–like dining room, replete with a full bar, and the festive outdoor eating area made the whole experience feel like a party you don’t want to end.\n\n107 W.

Bar-B-Que & Catering\n\nCopy link\n\nA lot has changed since this stalwart joint made our 2017 list. The old trailer has been replaced by a large building, a shiplap-and-corrugated-metal affair with tons of natural light. What hasn’t changed is the brisket, which, with its understated bark adding a rich depth to the flavor, continues to stand out, even in the meaty mecca along this stretch of the I-35 corridor. In fact, Hays Co. has made some improvements: the pork ribs are now a perfect balance of sweet and peppery, and there’s a selection of frozen mixed drinks, including the Hays Co. Raspa, a boozy slushy of Big Red and rum. Who knew barbecue and Big Red could get any better?\n\n1612 S. I-35, San Marcos; 512-392-6000; Mon–Thur 11–7, Fri & Sat 11–8, Sun 11–4 or sold out ; hayscobbq.com\n\nSpring\n\nCorkScrew BBQ\n\nCopy link\n\nLicense plates cover the counters at CorkScrew, and on weekends the parking lot is filled with a similar array of plates, symbols of the journeys that barbecue fanatics make to try husband-and-wife duo Will and Nichole Buckman’s fare. You could eat through the entire menu, but you’d be as happy with just the brisket (which we overheard one fellow diner call “elegant”) and the pulled pork, which is some of the best in the state; the meat is smoked bone-in and then mixed with a pepper-and-vinegar sauce. If you’re starved, add the stuffed potato salad, which comes topped with a hearty scoop of the meat of your choice, along with queso, green-chile ranch, and green onions.\n\n26608 Keith, Spring; 832-592-1184; Wed–Sat 11–4 ; corkscreworders.com\n\nTaylor\n\nLouie Mueller Barbecue\n\nCopy link\n\nThe line at Louie Mueller was moving slowly when we visited, and the woman taking orders had no time for small talk. But our request for a beef rib stopped her cold. “You know what you’re doing, right?” she said. “That’s gonna be more than two pounds of meat. Yep, could be seventy or eighty dollars.” She slapped the counter, turned and pulled the rib from the warmer, and dropped it onto a tray, causing the rendered fat and tender beef to roll like waves on an angry sea. The first salty, buttery bite made clear that this is one of the best pieces of smoked meat you’ll find anywhere. The brisket, sliced as thick as a New York strip, and the all-beef sausage, which audibly snaps (and drenches your chin) when bitten, are also near-perfect specimens. And that’s why few things are more sacred in Texas barbecue than a meal at Louie Mueller.\n\n206 W. 2nd, Taylor; 512-352-6206; Wed–Sat 11–4 or sold out ; louiemuellerbarbecue.com\n\nTomball\n\nTejas Chocolate + Barbecue\n\nCopy link\n\nAt Tejas Chocolate + Barbecue, employees might well tell you, “We’ve been crushing it since 2011, smoking it since 2015.” That’s because brothers Greg and Scott Moore’s operation, cofounded with Michelle Holland, originally sold only bean-to-bar chocolates. Needing to find another revenue stream, they turned their love of craft toward barbecue. We’re mighty thankful they did. The USDA Prime brisket oozes with perfectly rendered fat under a hefty salt-and-pepper bark, but the star of the show is the chile relleno sausage, made with brisket trimmings, roasted poblanos, and gooey pepper jack. Complete your meal with sides that expand your idea of what can complement barbecue, like the carrot soufflé, kissed with caramelized sugar.\n\n200 N. Elm, Tomball; 832-761-0670; Tue–Fri 11–6, Sat 11–5 ; tejaschocolate.com\n\nTyler\n\nStanley’s Famous Pit Barbecue\n\nCopy link\n\nThe tagline stenciled on nearly every surface at Stanley’s is “Be Kind, Have Fun,” a somewhat incongruous entreaty in this traditionally rough-and-tumble East Texas railroad town. But Stanley’s lives up to the motto, combining a world-class barbecue joint with two bars stocked with a dizzying selection of beer and assorted whiskeys and a honky tonk–inspired stage for live music. Owner Nick Pencis’s smoked meats are consistently great, anchored by the towering Mother Clucker smoked chicken sandwich and the baby back ribs rubbed with an eleven-spice dry mixture. Above all, Stanley’s is a community gathering place where staff and guests embody the fun and kindness that the restaurant’s slogan extols.\n\n525 S.

But you’d be missing out if you didn’t also stray from the classics. Guess, a former pitmaster at upscale Austin joint Lamberts, had our attention from the moment he opened his Waco food truck, in 2017. He upgraded to a brick-and-mortar restaurant in 2019; the renovated space has allowed him to branch out into a variety of specials. Highlights include a brisket melt with cheddar, caramelized onion, and house aioli on Texas toast; fried baby back ribs; and a fresh broccoli salad that might help you justify ordering a few extra menu items. Don’t skip the desserts; all are made in-house, including a heavenly single-serving coconut cream pie.\n\n2803 Franklin Ave, Waco; 254-313-3436; Wed–Fri 11–8, Sat 10–8, Sun 10–4 ; guessfamilybbq.com\n\nWeslaco\n\nTeddy’s Barbecue\n\nCopy link\n\nThe brothers Garcia are Rio Grande Valley natives, but Joel received his barbecue education in Austin at Freedmen’s and Terry Black’s. Jesse, a culinary school grad, also worked at Freedmen’s and later joined his sibling at Smokin’ Moon BBQ, in nearby Pharr; it was Joel who was manning the smokers there in 2019 when that establishment made our list of the state’s 25 best new barbecue joints. Now running their own place, the sibling scholars are dishing out Central Texas–style barbecue that’s a study in pepper: the perfectly rendered lean brisket has a piquant bark thanks to a pepper, salt, and Season-All rub, which is also used in the pulled pork. The pork ribs’ sweet glaze offers the palate some relief, but the must-have is the sausage, spiced with salt, black pepper, cumin, garlic, cayenne, and crushed red pepper. Enjoy your platter at a picnic table in the outdoor area, which has a stage for live music.\n\n2807 N. Texas Blvd, Weslaco; 956-532-6124; Thur & Fri 11–4, Sat 9–4, Sun 8–4 or sold out ; t3xbbq.com\n\nWoodway\n\nHelberg Barbecue\n\nCopy link\n\nStrike up a conversation about great barbecue in Waco, and chances are you’ll have more than one local pointing you to Phillip and Yvette Helberg’s joint in Woodway, just northwest of town. The couple upgraded from a food truck to a large and simply adorned space that features picnic tables and a familial vibe. We ordered the Quarterback mixed-meat plate, and while the brisket was beautiful, we found ourselves focused on the pork steak, the smoked chicken (also fried for extra-crispy skin), and the toothsome sausages. The highlights among the side dishes were the smoked-cheddar-and-Gouda mac and cheese and the collard greens. A family-recipe banana pudding was decadently creamy—we would have gone back for more if we hadn’t already stuffed ourselves silly.\n\n8532 N.
