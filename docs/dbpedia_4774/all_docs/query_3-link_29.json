        "text": "Dodgers general manager Ned Colletti and team president Stan Kasten went on a hiring spree, bringing in a new international scouting director (Bob Engle), a new assistant to the GM (Pat Corrales), a special assistant, player personnel (Josh Bard), and six international scouts that effectively doubled the size of that department.\n\nThey all came together Monday wearing name tags, along with manager Don Mattingly and co-owner Magic Johnson among others, during the team’s organizational meeting at Dodger Stadium.\n\n“It’s important that you have collaboration among departments,” Colletti said. “Everything is tied together.”\n\nFor Engle, it was a victory party of sorts. On Saturday, the Dodgers won the bidding rights to Korean pitcher Ryu Hyun-Jin for a cool $25,737,737 (7 and 3 are considered lucky numbers in Korea). Engle said his staff scouted Ryu extensively when he was with the Seattle Mariners, including some in person.\n\n“He can definitely come in and contribute immediately,” Engle said. “We think that he can come here and compete for a major-league starting spot.”\n\nColletti views Ryu as a starter, not a reliever, but couldn’t yet say whether the lefty is ready to be in the “top half” of the rotation.\n\nThat makes it a safe bet that the team isn’t done shopping for starters; the Dodgers still have to negotiate a contract with Ryu before the Dec. 10 deadline.\n\nThey are done shopping for front-office executives this winter, after years and years of cutting back under former owner Frank McCourt.\n\n“Everybody that we really like,” Colletti said, “we have.”\n\nWinter in Mexico\n\nDodgers infielder Luis Cruz said he will play winter ball in Mexico for the Culiacan Tomateros beginning Nov. 27. The team has already begun playing but, after getting more plate appearances in 2012 than all but one of his first 11 pro seasons, Cruz was advised to take a month off.\n\n“The last nine years I’ve been playing winter ball,” he said. “Now that I’ve been watching the games on TV, I think it’s better that I rest.”\n\nCruz was at Dodger Stadium on Monday as part of the team’s Veterans Day celebrations, which included a round of batting practice with Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force, Coast Guard and National Guard servicemen.\n\nAlso …\n\nLeft fielder Carl Crawford will be ready to play on Opening Day barring any setbacks in his rehabilitation from Tommy John surgery, Colletti said. On reports that Andre Ethier was on the trading block: “I haven’t talked to one team about Andre,” Colletti said, “either calling them or them calling me.” The Dodgers will announce their 2013 coaching staff today. Third-base coach Tim Wallach, a candidate for the managerial position in Toronto, is expected to return. Triple-A Albuquerque hitting coach John Valentin is expected to be named assistant hitting coach to Mark McGwire."
