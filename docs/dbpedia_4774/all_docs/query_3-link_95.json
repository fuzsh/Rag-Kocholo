At the Harvest Dinner, the organization raised more than $27,000, resulting in 18 new Life Members.\n\n“The campaign is off to a great start,” Kegebein was quoted as saying. “Our goal is to raise enough money to grow our endowment fund to $3 million in the coming decade.”\n\nGuardian Angels\n\nHoly Cross School celebrated Feast Day of the Guardian Angels with some sweet treats.\n\nSecond grader Ben Cube passed out “guardian angel” sugar cookies to his classmates, in honor of the Feast Day of the Guardian Angels, traditionally recognized on Oct. 2.
