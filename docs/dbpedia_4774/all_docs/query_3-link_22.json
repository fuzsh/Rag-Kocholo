        "text": "Introduction\n\nA prominent feature of the cerebral cortex is the columnar organization of cellular bodies particularly evident in Nissl-stained preparations of tissue in the temporal cortex of humans and other primates. These organized vertical neuronal structures have been termed minicolumns (Mountcastle, 1997; 2003), although they sometimes share terminology with other possibly related intracortical elements such as bundles of apical dendrites (Peters, 1994; Rockland and Ichinohe, 2004) or axons of pyramidal cells and pyramidal cell modules (DeFelipe, 1990; Jones, 2000). Physiological evidence of microcolumns may be found from tracer studies in area TE in monkey brains (Saleem et al., 1993) and studies by 2-deoxyglucose labeling in primary somatosensory cortex of monkeys and cats (Tommerdahl et al., 1993). Studies have also indicated that neurons in the microcolumn may be more interconnected than those outside the microcolumn (Constantinidis et al., 2001; Vercelli et al., 2004) and microcolumns have been proposed as a basic computational unit of the cortex (Mountcastle, 1957, 1997, 2003; Peters and Sethares, 1996; Buxhoeveden and Casanova, 2002a). On the other hand, there are other studies that indicate that this characterization of the microcolumn as a fundamental unit of organization and function is not without problems (Jones, 2000; Rockland and Ichinohe, 2004; Buxhoeveden and Casanova, 2005; Krieger, et al., 2007). Even studies of “whisker columns” or barrels in the rodent somatosensory cortex, that are the anatomical equivalent of a functional cortical column, indicate that they are not a functional unit consisting of cells with similar functional properties (Helmstaedter, et al., 2007). Indeed, it has recently been argued that even the very well established and much studied ocular dominance columns seem to not serve a purpose (Horton and Adams, 2005). Thus, the issue regarding the functionality of microcolumns although debatable, is still important and relevant where the definite proof of function is an open question and one that awaits empirical confirmation (Jones, 2000; Mountcastle, 2003; Rockland and Ichinohe, 2004).\n\nThere are many studies concerned with properties of microcolumns and associated structures. For example, there are studies on “cellular” microcolumns (see reviews by Buxhoeveden and Casanova, 2002a; 2002b), pyramidal cell modules (Peters and Kara, 1987; Peters and Sethares, 1991; White and Peters, 1993; Peters and Sethares, 1996; Peters, 1994; Peters, et. al., 1997), and bundles of myelinated axons (DeFelipe et al., 1990; Peters and Sethares, 1996). These studies exemplify a larger body of work that tries to understand the vertical structures in general and that provides a wealth of data related to anatomy, connectivity, and function. Moreover, these data fall short when addressing a crucial question: the distribution of neurons within and between microcolumns. This is an important issue as it is clear that for example the three-dimensional (3D) structural arrangement of neurons around the central bundle of apical dendrites is a critical feature of the microcolumn and its functions. Yet experimental studies of the spatial arrangements of these neurons have been hampered by many technical limitations that prevent these spatial arrangements from being studied efficiently and quantitatively. For example, one could prepare thick plastic sections in which the 3D locations of every neuron are manually marked. This preparation, however, is only practical for small studies of limited areas, preventing studies of entire cortical areas, or large subject populations. Moreover, the required thick plastic sections would have to be specially prepared as most tissue banks and brain section archives consist of thin paraffin sections (5 to 15 μm thick), thin frozen sections (10 to 60 μm thick), or thin celloidin sections (30 to 60 μm thick) (see for example: www.brainmuseum.org and www.brainmaps.org).\n\nSeveral different approaches have been developed to quantify microcolumnar properties by using instead the two-dimensional (2D) coordinates of neurons obtained from widely-available thin sections (Buldyrev et. al. 2000; Buxhoeveden et al. 2000a; Cruz et al, 2005). These methods are of interest as they have provided evidence of changes in microcolumnar properties in a number of different conditions that suggest the potential functional significance for different microcolumnar properties. For example, there are studies of structural differences of microcolumns: across different species (Buxhoeveden, et at., 2001), across different cortical areas within one species (Cruz, et al., 2005) as well as in normal aging (Cruz, et al., 2004), in the AD brain (VanHoesen and Solodkin, 1993; Buldyrev, et al., 2000), in schizophrenia (Benes and Bird, 1987; Buxhoeveden, et al., 2000b), in Down’s syndrome (Buxhoeveden, et al., 2002), in autism (Casanova, et al., 2003), and in dyslexia (Casanova, et al., 2002). In particular, the density map method (Cruz et al., 2005) uses the 2D x,y experimentally-obtained coordinates of neurons to characterize microcolumns by “measures,” such as the strength of microcolumns (ratio of the density of neurons within a defined microcolumn to the total density of neurons in the ROI). Other measures include the width, length, strength of periodicity of nearest neighbor microcolumns, intercolumnar distance, and the vertical distance between neurons within a microcolumn.\n\nDespite the utility of the density map method and its ability to be applied to large samples of tissue sections including most archival brain-banked material, there is currently no clear way to determine how changes in these measures derived from 2D projections of neurons relate to the true 3D spatial locations of neurons in the brain. To address this problem we utilize the microcolumnar measures listed above with a new modeling approach presented here to describe and construct a plausible 3D representation of microcolumns in the sampled tissues. This approach of empirical density map data and a 3D theoretical model uses as input only the experimental x,y coordinates of neurons acquired from Nissl-stained thin sections. This method takes into account z-axis tissue collapse typical in Nissl-stained thin section samples and also the fact that these thin sections, because of the intrinsic curvature of the brain, are cut at angles that are rarely normal to the surface of the brain.\n\nIn this paper we first describe in the Methods section the seven steps that transforms a 3D arrangement of neurons from a crystalline lattice into a spatial arrangement with the same statistical properties, as dictated by its 2D density map, as the experimentally obtained neuronal positions from tissue. Following this, in the Results section we illustrate the application of the method to construct 3D arrangements of neurons using as input the density map data derived in Cruz et al., (2005) from layer III neurons of area 46 of the rhesus monkey.\n\nResults\n\nIn this section, we present an application of the 3D modeling method by using as input previously calculated density maps derived from images of layer III, area 46, of rhesus monkey brains (Cruz, et. al. 2005). This application also serves as a tutorial on how to generate 3D neuronal ensembles from any set of density map measures.\n\nDuring the process of the specific 3D construction below, we will refer to for illustrations of the resulting 3D structures and to for their corresponding density maps. In we list those measures that are either constraints or change as a consequence of a particular step and in we list the experimental values used to build the model as well as the resulting values of the parameters of the model that are obtained from the match to the target values. In we list each step (first column) along with its corresponding measures of microcolumnarity (rows). The target values coming from experimental results are given in the last row of (row Expt.).\n\nTable 2\n\nTissue Property or MeasurementValueY, average interneuron distance.20.0 μm (1) (estimated)P, average intercolumn distance.26.1 μm (1)ρ, slide neuronal density0.0013 neurons/μm2 (1)l341 μm (1)s, thickness of the thin slice30 μm (1)radius or neurons (average)5 μm% interneurons20% (2)Model ParameterValuedn, interneuron distance.23.1 μmdc, intercolumn distance.29 μmθUniform random [0, 2π]φUniform random, [0, π/3]% omitted neurons40%δdnGaussian distribution, σ=4.7μmδxn, δznUniform random, [−6 μm, 6 μm]δxc, δzcUniform random, [−6 μm, 6μm]N, number of images for average.500\n\nTable 3\n\nSTEPSTW (μm)P (μm)L (μm)Y(μm)rho; (neurons/μm2)02.14±0.062.08±0.143.17±0.0124.0±3.3151.2±17.622.1±0.30.0018±7×10−611.70±0.071.61±0.043.14±0.0223.1±3.2147.0±26.520.3±3.00.0023±1×10−521.70±0.041.66±0.073.15±0.0327.9±0.9179.8±62.322.3±00.0013±8×10−631.64±0.041.17±0.013.18±0.0227.1±1.4154.2±47.822.2±0.20.0014±1×10−541.70±0.011.16±0.023.19±0.0127.5±0.835.7±18.021.0±0.60.0014±8×10−651.21±0.021.09±0.0112.89±0.8526.4±0.622.3±6.320.7±0.70.0014±5×10−661.26±0.041.04±0.0113.99±0.7426.2±1.223.6±7.821.5±0.30.0014±6×10−6Expt.1.25±0.061.04±0.0312.8±2.9026.1±2.816.9±9.921.4±1.40.0013±0.0003\n\nTo provide statistics in the comparison between the model and target, N blocks of model neurons are generated after each step from which we get N model thin slices. We note that since the steps involve random numbers, no two 3D blocks will have neurons at exactly the same x,y,z coordinates, thus the procedure creates a set of N distinct blocks. The N blocks are then separated into n groups from which n average density maps are calculated with corresponding n sets of measures of microcolumnarity. From these n sets of model measures, one set of average (plus standard deviation) measures of microcolumnarity are calculated for the model that is compared with the corresponding experimental target measures of microcolumnarity. Because the value of the standard deviations in the measures of microcolumnarity of the model depend on N and n, which both can be made arbitrarily big (only bounded by simulation time), the value of the error in the model is only presented here as a guide and not as a true comparison with the experimental error bars. In the present work, we take N = 500 and divided this into n = 5 groups of 100.\n\nFor convenience, we define the building and modification of neuronal positions up to a given step to obtain N 3D structures the generating phase and the rotating and cutting of these 3D structures into thin slices, plus the calculation of their density map along with the determination of measures of microcolumnarity from this density map, the processing phase.\n\nStep 0\n\nThe size of the block to accommodate the size of our experimental ROI (341×341 μm2) is given by equation (3) to be about 484×484×484 μm3. A block of this size usually contains more than 7000 neurons. As described in the Methods section, at Step 0 an initial crystalline lattice is built. The only two parameters necessary to define this initial lattice are dc and dn. As presented in the Methods, the value of dc is closely related to P. For our specific application of layer III microcolumns, we use a value for dc of 29 μm (from Cruz et al., 2005; Figure 8D). We note that this value is of the same order of magnitude as values found in the literature for the distance between dendrite bundles, a natural measure for distances between microcolumns, in for example: the mouse primary motor cortex bundles of layer V apical dendrites measured at the level of layer IV on average at 31 μm apart (Lev and White, 1997), layer IV of the rat primary somatosensory cortex on average at 49 μm apart (Skoglund et al., 2004), and the monkey visual cortex in layer IV of area 17 at about 30 μm apart (Peters and Sethares, 1991) and between bundles of myelinated axons in layer IVc (and apical dendrites) at 23 μm apart (Peters and Sethares, 1996). Also, in supragranular layers of the rat primary visual cortex bundles were found to be about 27 μm apart (Vercelli et al., 2004).\n\nFor the value of dn, we eliminate for dn in equation (2) and by taking Y = 20 μm (lower bound estimate; Cruz et al., 2005, ) we obtain dn = 23.1 μm. An example of an initial lattice is shown in . After the generating phase up to Step 0 and the processing phase we obtain the density map shown in along with the measures of microcolumnarity plus the average neuronal density listed in the first row of (row 0). It can be seen by simple inspection that the density map (g(x,y) plotted in ) has almost no features that resemble the target density map (Cruz et al., 2005, ). The cross sections along the x- and y-axis of the model density map ( ) show very large and discrete peaks characteristic of crystalline lattices.\n\nStep 1\n\nIn Step 1, interneurons are added to the system as described in the Methods. Here, the radius of neurons is taken as 5 μm where this number is derived from the average size of neurons in our tissue samples from area 46, layer III (Cruz et al., 2005). Interneurons are added to the system such that they make a total of 20% of the total number of neurons in the model system (Hendry et. al., 1987). Carrying out the generating phase up to step 1 with the subsequent processing phase shows that both S and T were changed, as shown in , step 1. The significant decrease in S and T is due to the increased average density of neurons in the system because the random placement of these neurons adds more neurons outside the microcolumn than within the microcolumn.\n\nStep 2\n\nIn Step 2, as described in the Methods, a percentage of all neurons are deleted to match the 2D neuronal density of the model system and the 2D experimentally observed density. For our specific application, we need to delete 40% of all neurons. After this reduction, the percentage of interneurons vs principal neurons is unchanged but the model density for 2D slices matches the experimental value without altering any of the other microcolumnar properties relative to step 1 ( , step 2). The resulting density map up to step 2 (not shown) remains very close to the one shown for step 1 in .\n\nStep 3\n\nIn Step 3 the randomization of y0 produces a radical change in the appearance of the system as illustrated in since neurons across microcolumns no longer coincide at their yn positions. However, the neurons within microcolumns still form perfectly spaced vertical columns, as seen in (dark spheres are interneurons). After the generating up to Step 3 and processing phases, we obtain the density map shown in with the corresponding cross sections in . This density map shows how the periodicity in the y direction is lost and the cross section in the x-axis shows the emergence of wider peaks for the nearest neighbor microcolumns. As shown in , while Step 3 radically changed the 3D structure of the block, it only affected T, the measure of strength of neighboring microcolumns, by reducing it as immediately adjacent neurons are on average more dispersed.\n\nStep 4\n\nIn Step 4, after the generating phase up to Step 4 plus the processing phase, we see that adding δdn in equation (5) does not change the resulting density map (not shown, but similar to ) but does transform the sharp peaks in the y-axis of into the smoother curves of its corresponding cross sections (not shown, but with a y-axis similar to that of ) that approximate the y-axis cross section found in experiment (Cruz et. al., 2005, ). A value for the width of the Gaussian distribution of δdn of σ=4.7 μm was enough to match these two curves. As shown in , adding δdn did not affect significantly most of the measures except L and Y, both of which were brought to values closer to the target. The decrease in L (the vertical span of the microcolumn) comes from its definition as the length scale in an exponential envelope of the peaks in the y-axis cross section. Smaller and smoother peaks yield a faster decay of the exponential envelope, thus a smaller L.\n\nStep 5\n\nIn Step 5, the random displacements of neurons in the x-z plane by the addition of the random variables δxn and δzn, result in microcolumns with a non-zero width W, as shown in , Step 5. Values for δxn and δzn in the range of ±6μm were enough to match W from the model to its target of 12.8 μm (from Cruz et al., 2005). These displacements introduce additional reductions in S and T. Both of these reductions happen because some neurons are displaced considerably far from the center of the microcolumns and no longer contribute to the density map-defined “microcolumn” thus weakening their microcolumnar measures from the previous step.\n\nStep 6\n\nFinally, in Step 6, the positions of the base of the microcolumns are moved in random directions away from the vertices of the underlying hexagonal lattice. After the generating and processing phases, we obtain a density map ( ) with cross sections shown in . This step broadens and lowers the peaks in the model cross section (other than the central peak) along the x-axis ( ), an effect already present but of less magnitude in Step 5, that match with the experimental curve when δxc and δzc are in the range of [−6μm, 6μm]. This step is also essential to bring additional realism to the model, as seen by comparing in which the regular patterns of the underlying idealized hexagonal lattice are diminished. Examination of , step 6 shows that the value of T (strength of neighboring microcolumns) is the only measure that is significantly affected by this step.\n\nAs a result of the transformations described above, a final set of 3D blocks that best approximate the actual microcolumn organization of neurons from layer III in area 46 is obtained. A step-by-step illustration of this particular process is summarized in where the measures of microcolumnarity are plotted as a function of step number. The last point in each graph corresponds to the target values. Significant decreases in S toward its target occur at steps 1 and 5, in which interneurons and planar displacements of neuronal positions are incorporated, respectively. T is significantly reduced toward its target at steps 1 (interneurons are added) and 3, in which the periodicity across microcolumns is reduced smearing the effect of nearest neighbor columns. W increases significantly as neurons are displaced in the x-z plane, thus giving width to the columns. The distance between microcolumns P does not suffer any significant change at any step. This is because the only step that could possibly affect it, step 6, only broadens and decreases the first peak of the cross section in the x-axis ( ) but does not change the average position of the nearest neighbor microcolumns, thus preserving the value of P. L decreases abruptly at step 4 when the decay in the density map cross sections increases, thus truncating L. The value for Y, the vertical distance between neurons within microcolumns, does not change appreciably except at step 4 when the distances between neurons change from being a constant to being values from a distribution. All of these changes along with the step number at which they occur are listed in . We note that the significant changes in the measures at particular steps, shown as big jumps in , will also appear at the same step number when using other data from measures of other cortical areas, but the magnitude of the changes will be dependent on the input data.\n\nComparing the values of the microcolumnar measures after step 6 with the target values (last two rows of ) we observe that most of the values derived from the model were at less than 8% from the values of the target except for W and L where intrinsic large fluctuations in these measures prevented a better fit. However, even for these two measures, the values from the model were within the experimental error of the W and L target values.\n\nDiscussion\n\nSummary\n\nA method is presented that starting from density maps empirically derived from the two-dimensional x,y coordinates of neurons from thin sections, constructs a set of theoretical three-dimensional representations of those neurons. The method transforms, by a series of steps, a 3D crystalline lattice of neurons into a 3D spatial model configuration that gives microcolumnar measures consistent with those calculated from thin tissue sections.\n\nCaveats\n\nThe main limitation of our model is that it cannot generate an exact rendering of individual neuron locations given a set of 2D tissue sections since the density maps are statistical properties of such sections that can only provide average spatial properties. The model provides instead a set of N 3D structures that when taken together, provide the same statistical properties (density maps) as those derived from neurons in tissue. Moreover, since the N 3D structures are statistically equivalent, any of them can be taken as representative of the biological system used to generate them.\n\nThere are two other important questions that remain concerning the validity of this model: (i) whether the steps involved in modifying the crystalline lattice produce a statistically “unique” representation, and (ii) whether these steps are the only way to achieve this representation.\n\nFirst, regarding uniqueness of the 3D model solution, there are enough experimental constraints provided by the neuronal density and microcolumnar measures that the 3D microcolumnar arrangement that results from our specified construction and corrections is the only possible outcome that optimally matches all of the target experimental properties. Also, the specific sequence of steps should not influence the final configuration. However, because here we sequentially apply the steps without returning to previous steps (in a linear fashion), this may introduce errors since at every step there are minor changes to all measures ( ), although these changes are not significant. Instead, an algorithm in which the differences between the measures of microcolumnarity from the model (tuned by all of the adjustable parameters of the model) and those from the target are iteratively minimized might provide a slightly “better fit” between the 3D representation and experiment. However, this “better fit” would only bring second-order corrections (less than 1%) that would not substantially change the final parameters presented here while at the same time increasing significantly the computational effort involved in such a feedback minimizing algorithm.\n\nSecond, our choice of transforming steps is not the only way to derive an underlying 3D model as they depend (by design) upon the initial configuration. Thus instead of a perfect 3D lattice as a starting point, a set of randomly-placed neurons (or columns) could have been used as the initial configuration that are then moved by a different set of steps to cause coalescence into the final microcolumnar arrangement that yields the required target values. However, starting from an ordered lattice that undergoes specified transformations is more amenable to systematic analysis and may yield more insight when studying changes to these transformations relative to observed alterations in development, aging, and disease.\n\nPotential Applications\n\nOur model is relevant to studies that assess the level of organization of neurons in the cortex over a number of variables or conditions, such as across species or between different areas of the cortex, but may be particularly useful in assessing changes across the life span. Specifically, our model could contribute to questions about when and how microcolumns emerge in development and change up to adulthood. Likewise, it is applicable to study how microcolumns change in adulthood as the brain ages (Cruz et al, 2004). For example, building a 3D model of the neuronal locations and their changes in the aging brain could help generate testable hypotheses about the underlying mechanisms and functional consequence for cortical information processing. Also, this method is relevant to studies of neurological diseases in that it can provide a unique perspective into the degree of 3D organization or disorganization in developmental disorders and in neurodegenerative diseases that affect the cortex, for example in the cross-correlation between thioflavine S-positive plaques and neurons in AD (Urbanc et al., 2002).\n\nOn a more practical level, this method offers an alternative to manually acquiring the 3D positions of cells from serial sections of 3D tissue blocks and entails a much lower cost in labor and a savings in material by deriving 3D information from the relatively common Nissl-stained sections available from many collections of brain samples (e.g. brainmaps.org). This is especially true as massive amounts of data in the form of x,y coordinates from such tissue can now be automatically obtained using a recently developed automatic neuronal recognition method based on a combination of image segmentation and machine learning (Inglis, et. al. 2007).\n\nImpact\n\nOur method is not restricted to the values presented here ( ), but is applicable to any set of x,y locations of cells regardless of acquisition method or staining. Also, this method is general in that it can be applied to any arrangement of cells with some underlying vertical organization. The connection with experiments is done via the density map method to characterize microcolumnarity that itself only requires the x,y coordinates of cells. However, since the initial adjusting parameters come from our density maps, other methods that generate equivalent average measures could conceivably be used as starting parameters to generate the 3D model, such as the one presented by Buxhoeveden et al (2000a).\n\nThe model presented here can also be applied to the construction of virtual dendrite forests using the L-Neuron and ArborVitae programs (Ascoli et al., 2001; Ascoli, 2002) or using other models such as DLA-based diffusive growth mechanisms (Luczak, 2006). In this role, our model can dictate the initial x,y,z of neuron somata on which to build these networks of dendrites and could include axonal arborizations (Scorcioni and Ascolia, 2005). These generated “forests” can then be used in compartmental neuron simulations to assess the viability of firing and signaling among neurons in the network, similar to other studies that simulate whole-column realistic simulations such as the Blue Brain project (Markram, 2006).\n\nSoftware\n\nThe code containing the algorithm described in this work to generate 3D configurations given the parameters described in this work is available in the download section of http://polymer.bu.edu/cruz/micros."
