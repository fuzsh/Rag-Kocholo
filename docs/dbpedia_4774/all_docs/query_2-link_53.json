See my answer to it here: https://stackoverflow.com/a/5879551/524368\n\nAnother issue might be, that the corner coordinates of the cubes are not exactly the same. Floating point numbers have some intrinsic error and if you arrange those cubes in a grid by adding some floating point number to it, it may happen, that the vertex positions get slightly off and due to roundoff error you get to see depth fighting. Two things to solve this: 1st: If two cubes' faces touch, don't render them. 2nd: Use integer coordinates for laying out the cube grid and convert the vertices to floating point only when submitting to OpenGL, or don't convert at all."
