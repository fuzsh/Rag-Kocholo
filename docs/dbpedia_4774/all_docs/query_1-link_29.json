        "text": "In contrast, the Spirit of the Confederacy is fixed and imposing. Its stance, muscles, height, and expression declares its own strength and endurance. It points towards one fantasy: the myth of the Lost Cause, that there contained a moral basis for slavery, and that the romanticized defense of this institution was chivalrous. And so the Spirit engages in a performance of its own, bringing this elsewhere home. But because its performance is so static and insistent, the work doesn’t activate itself, nor does it invite activation by a viewer. Instead, it projects unto others. It creates a space of violence imposed by the statue, which includes the violence of delivering the false history of Lost Cause mythology as sustained by such benefactors as the Daughters of the Confederacy.\n\nThe space asserted by the Spirit feels different to Troika, which settles quietly in and within its environment. I’m struck, for example, by the negative space. The sculpture itself is just its edges, flat beams of cor-ten steel, which rusts beautifully to reveal striations of age. These edges create square windows, offering frames for different parts of the landscape, depending on where and how you choose to stand before it. With its windows comfortably sat at eye-level, Troika allows itself to be seen through, and facilitates a harmonious relationship between itself and its surroundings. It feels relational in the sense that its frames elevate the architecture, landscape, and people around it as subjects that are part of the sculpture itself, seamlessly cohering space and object as activated by passersby. To move while fixing your gaze on its window is to train a film camera to pan through a scene.\n\nFor me, the new questions that emerge from this comparison concern what we aspire for our public art. In what ways do we want to relate to our monuments, and in what ways should they engage our inner and exterior spaces? What kind of aesthetics should replace our Confederate symbology—which are more than passive gestures, but rather perpetual agents of false histories? Troika models some ways of offering richness, ways I’ve found particularly nurturing when viewed through a queer lens—ambiguity, complexity, and fluidity, a resistance to being one thing, communality.\n\nCarlos Cruz-Diez’s Double Physichromie (2009) delivers similarly rich modes of expression, and The Art Guys’ Statue of Four Lies (2010), both at the University of Houston, offers a more explicit anti-monumentality. Their qualities feel spacious, and not repressive.\n\nWhatever we choose to succeed the pedestals once occupied by Confederate vestiges, we have to remember one lesson that our rejection of these monuments have taught us: that our public artworks are active and effecting, and that they imagine and sustain realities, false or otherwise. As much as they are sayers, they are doers. To develop an aesthetic consciousness is to understand that our art is not neutral—that it not only has potential for deep, spiritual and material violence, but also a potential for deep healing, connection, and generation. If we are to be invested in the project of healing, then we can work to understand our public spaces as intentioned sites of imagination, and we can craft and curate the art that occupies it as works that point elsewhere, and can bring the elsewhere home.\n\nWith gratitude to the Alexandra L. Rowan Memorial Foundation English Writing Internship Program, which supported Jack Morillo’s research and writing with Public Art UHS during Summer 2021."
