The day before Spindelegger's scheduled departure, Vice-Chancellor Alexander Schallenberg stated that Austria will officially recognise the NTC as the sole legitimate representative of the Libyan people, but Spindelegger would not be able to make his trip as planned due to security concerns.[50] 16 Latvia[51] Recognised on 20 June 2011 During a visit to Latvia of NTC member Abdurrahman Shalgam the Political Director and Undersecretary of State of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Latvia, Andris Razāns, announced that \"Latvia recognises the Transitional National Council of Libya as the political interlocutor representing the Libyan people during this interim period.\" 17 Lithuania Recognised on 20 June 2011 On 20 June in Vilnius, Lithuanian Vice-Minister of Foreign Affairs Asta Skaisgirytė Liauškienė hosted the representatives of NTC Shalgam Abdul Rahman and Hafed Gaddur.

On 26 June, the Cape Verdean government called the NTC \"the legitimate interlocutor\" for Praia during the civil war.

At first, Foreign Minister Nickolay Mladenov said his country will not recognise the National Transitional Council as a legitimate government, stating that such an action would be against Bulgaria's long-term interests and the safety of its citizens in Libya.[63] Prime Minister Boyko Borisov has confirmed this position, pointing out that representatives of the NTC are linked to the imprisonment and torture of five Bulgarian nurses and a Palestinian doctor (see HIV trial in Libya).[64] As of 31 March, Bulgaria remained the only EU member with a functioning embassy in the official capital Tripoli;[65] however, following attacks on other embassies in Tripoli, the Bulgarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that its embassy was evacuated to Djerba in neighbouring Tunisia on 1 May 2011. Vesela Cherneva, the MFA spokesperson, said the move was temporary and the embassy would return once circumstances allowed it.[66] On 28 June, the foreign ministry announced their recognition of the council as the legitimate representative of Libya upon its visit to Benghazi as a joint statement with Croatia.[62] Despite their earlier statements, Foreign Minister Mladenov said that \"Brutally assaulting his own people, Colonel Gaddafi has irreversibly lost all claims to legitimacy\" and furthermore (in contrast to Bulgaria's earlier wariness toward the no-fly zone) \"As Nato allies, Bulgaria and Croatia support irrefutably the international coalition and its mission in Libya.\"[62] On early night 22 August some unidentified persons have looted the Bulgarian embassy in Tripoli.[67] On 2 September Bulgarian police stormed the Libyan embassy and forced out diplomats of Gaddafi's regime after a new ambassador appointed by NTC arrived.[68] 21 Croatia[62] Recognised on 28 June 2011 The foreign ministry announced their recognition of the council as the sole government of Libya upon its visit to Benghazi, in a joint statement (shown above) with the Bulgarian representative. 22 Turkey Recognised on 3 July 2011 Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu recognised the council as a representative of the Libyan people during a visit to Ankara on 23 May 2011 by its chairman, Mustafa Abdul Jalil, although it still maintained its relations with Gaddafi at that time.[69] While in Benghazi on 3 July, Davutoglu announced that Turkey considers the council to be \"the legitimate representative of the Libyan people\", and that it would cut its ties with Gaddafi's government. Turkey also \"reassigned\" its ambassador to Libya, who formerly served as Turkey's top diplomat in Tripoli, the same weekend.[70] He also pledged $200 million in aid to the rebels.[71] On 1 August, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said Turkey had \"not broken off state-to-state relations with the Tripoli administration yet\" and was continuing to allow the Libyan Embassy in Ankara to operate under the green flag, but it had ceased communicating with the embassy and would allow the NTC to open an office in Turkey.[72] However on 22 August embassy staff changed flag above the embassy and NTC representative in Turkey entered the embassy to way for instructions from Benghazi.[73] On 2 September Turkey reopened its embassy in Libya.[74] 23 Poland Recognised on 8 July 2011 During his visit to Benghazi on 11 May, Polish Foreign Minister Radosław Sikorski said \"We recognize the council as the legitimate interlocutor of the international community and as a representative of the democratic aspirations of the Libyan people.\"[75] On 21 June, the government announced its ambassador to Libya, Wojciech Brożek, would head up a permanent diplomatic office in Benghazi.[76] On 7 July, Poland opened embassy in Benghazi.[77] On 8 July, the Foreign Minister of Poland, Radoslaw Sikorski, announced that Poland recognised only the NTC as the \"legitimate government of the Libyan people\".[78] At the fourth Libya Contact Group meeting in Istanbul minister Sikorski presented Poland's assistance package for Libya. It included proposals to launch the Polish medical mission in Misrata and a training mission for state officials (police or border guards), readiness for training the new personnel in Poland (including education at Polish universities).[79] The Polish Press Agency reported that unofficially the Polish government could have supplied the rebels with anti-tank rocket launchers and military vehicles \"some months ago\" and officers of Polish Special Forces were helping in direct operations.[80][81] Ahmed El-Mallul, a Libyan surgeon living in Poland is the mediator between the NTC and the Polish government.[82] On 15 September Poland reopened its embassy in Tripoli.[83] 24 Netherlands Recognised on 13 July 2011 Originally, the Netherlands had refused to recognise, despite being involved in the no-fly zone. On 5 May 2011, a spokesman for the council said the Netherlands had recognised it as the legitimate representative of Libya. The Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs flatly denied the claim, saying, \"That message is not correct.\"[84] The Dutch government, though a participant in international operations in Libya under United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973, said in June it believes other states have moved too quickly in recognising or otherwise affirming the legitimacy of the National Transitional Council.[85] During a meeting with Mahmoud Jibril, one of the leaders of the NTC, the ministers of Foreign Affairs of the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg declared their recognition of the NTC as the preliminary legal representative of the Libyan people.[86] On 3 September the Dutch Minister of Foreign Affairs Uri Rosenthal said at the European Union summit in Sopot that the Netherlands will reopen its embassy as soon as possible.[87] 25 Belgium Recognised on 13 July 2011 During a meeting with Mahmoud Jibril, one of the leaders of the NTC, the ministers of Foreign Affairs of the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg declared their recognition of the NTC as the legal representative of the Libyan people.[88] 26 Luxembourg Recognised on 13 July 2011 During a meeting with Mahmoud Jibril, one of the leaders of the NTC, the ministers of Foreign Affairs of the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg declared their recognition of the NTC as the legal representative of the Libyan people.[86] 27 United States[89][90] Recognised on 15 July 2011 On 10 March 2011, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton met anti-Gaddafi opposition leaders during a trip to Egypt and Tunisia.[91] After the meeting between Clinton and representatives of the council, the European Union and the U.S have decided to talk to the council without officially recognising them, in order to seek further information on the group and its goals.[92] On 17 March, ahead of a U.N vote on a no-fly zone, Under Secretary of State William J. Burns affirmed U.S support for a no-fly zone, as well as more aggressive measures to restrain Gaddhafi, that the U.S is investigating transferring Gaddafi's frozen assets to the rebels, and that the NTC may open an embassy in Washington.[93] On 29 March, the U.S. confirmed at a conference in London that it will send a formal representative to Benghazi.[89] In late April, Ambassador Gene Cretz said the U.S. was continuing to consider formal recognition of the council, but in the meantime, it is providing strong informal support, including reportedly authorising international oil deals with rebel-held eastern Libya.[94][95] On 13 May 2011, US National Security Adviser Tom Donilon said his government recognised the National Transitional Council as \"a legitimate and credible interlocutor of the Libyan people\" after meeting with Prime Minister Mahmoud Jebril.[90] White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said that the U.S. had not yet decided to fully recognise the council as Libya's sole legitimate representative body. On 24 May, the NTC opened a formal diplomatic office in Washington, D.C. (the U.S. had already had an office in Benghazi with a formal envoy for nearly two months).[89] On 9 June, Clinton said, \"The United States views the Transitional National Council as the legitimate interlocutor for the Libyan people during this interim period,\" but Washington and Benghazi indicated that the U.S. still had not committed to the same level of formal recognition as France and several other countries.[96] On 15 July, at an international conference on Libya held in Turkey, Clinton stated that the US had decided to formally recognise the TNC as the country's \"legitimate authority\", allowing the US to divert over $30 billion worth of Gaddafi regime funds frozen in the US to the TNC.[97]\n\nOn 19 July, after sending a message to Gaddafi that there would be no negotiation and that he must step down, the US began to urge other countries to recognise the NTC.[98]\n\n28 Japan[99] Recognised on 15 July 2011 At a meeting of a contact group in Istanbul, Vice Foreign Minister Hisashi Tokunaga said, \"I would like to take this opportunity to declare that the government of Japan regards the NTC as the legitimate interlocutor of the Libyan people.\"\n\nOn 22 August the Libyan embassy in Tokyo has changed its national green flag to the tricolor flag of the former Kingdom of Libya.[100]\n\n29 Albania[101][102][103] Recognised on 18 July 2011 On 29 March, Foreign Minister Edmond Haxhinasto said Albania would open its airspace and territorial waters to coalition forces and said its seaports and airports were at the coalition's disposal upon request. Haxhinasto also suggested that Albania could make a \"humanitarian\" contribution to international efforts.[104] In mid-April, the International Business Times listed Albania alongside several other NATO member states, including Romania, Bulgaria, Greece and Turkey, that have made contributions to the military effort, although it did not go into detail.[105] The Albanian Foreign Ministry announced on 18 July in a statement, \"The Albanian government backs the activities of the National Transitional Council and its program for a democratic Libya, and considers the council to be the legitimate representative of the Libyan people.\" Even prior to recognition, Albania was a staunch supporter of the military intervention in Libya.[106] On 22 August, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs congratulated \"the people of Libya ... [on] marking the end of the dictatorial regime of Muammar Gaddafi\" and said it would work to strengthen bilateral relations between Tirana and Tripoli,[107] and on 23 August, Albanian President Bamir Topi congratulated the NTC on what it called \"a historic moment in the deposal of one of the dictatorial regimes of our era\".[108] On 29 August, the Libyan Embassy in Tirana changed its flag from Gaddafi's green banner to the tricolour adopted by the NTC.[109] 30 Slovenia[110] Recognised on 20 July 2011 The Slovenian Foreign Ministry announced on 20 July in a statement, \"The Slovenian government recognises the NTC as the legitimate representative of the Libyan people until the establishment of a transitional authority in a post-Gaddafi Libya.\" 31 Montenegro[111] Recognised on 21 July 2011 The Montenegrin government published a press release online in which it said, according to an English translation, \"The Government of Montenegro adopted the Decision on the recognition of the Libyan National Transitional Council (LNTC) as a legitimate political representative of the Libyan people.\" According to the release, the move was intended to be consistent with the United Nations Security Council, the European Council, and the Libya Contact Group.[111] Media subsequently reported Podgorica considered the NTC to be Libya's legitimate government.[112] 32 United Kingdom[113][114] Recognised on 27 July 2011 On 5 March 2011, Defence Secretary Liam Fox stated that \"a small British diplomatic team\" was in Benghazi.[9] On 10 March, Britain and France released a statement calling on Europe to recognise the National Transitional Council.[115] Britain was the first country to formally invite the National Transitional Council to open a diplomatic office within its borders.[116] The Foreign Secretary William Hague said that the council was the \"legitimate representative of the Libyan people\".[117] On 12 May 2011, Foreign Secretary William Hague stated that \"Gaddafi should realise in our view that time is against him and it is the National Transitional Council that is the legitimate interlocutor representative of the Libyan people\". He also announced that the NTC had been invited to open a mission in London. During a visit to Benghazi in June, he reiterated that the UK views the NTC as the \"legitimate representative of the Libyan people.\"[118] On 27 July 2011, William Hague confirmed that the United Kingdom will deal with the National Transitional Council as the \"legitimate governing authority in Libya\" and treat the NTC \"as if they were the state of Libya\". It was also stated that the UK would expel remaining Gaddafi regime diplomats, as the British Government no longer recognises them as representatives of the Libyan government, and invite the NTC to appoint a new Libyan diplomatic envoy to take over the Libyan Embassy in London.[119][120][121] On 10 August 2011, the British Foreign Secretary announced that Transitional National Council was staffing the Libyan Embassy in London.[122] 33 Portugal[123] Recognised on 28 July 2011 The Sydney Morning Herald reported on 11 March that Portugal recognised the council shortly after France,[124] but it did not quote a source, and the claim was never corroborated by the Portuguese government or any other source. Portugal voted for United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973 and its UN ambassador asserted that \"the regime that has ruled Libya for over 40 years has come to an end by the will of the Libyan people\", referring to Gaddafi's government and the uprising against it.[125] On 9 June, Portuguese Foreign Minister Luis Amado clarified that they had not yet recognised, but \"the decision [to recognize NTC] will be taken soon by this government or the next.\" He said that while Lisbon plans to recognise the council and is dispatching a permanent diplomatic mission to Benghazi, his government has some concerns as to decisions it has made that it wants to be assuaged before it officially grants recognition.[126] On 28 July, the Portuguese Foreign Ministry released a statement recognising the NTC \"as the legitimate governing authority of Libya until the formation of a transitional authority\".[123] 34 Gabon Recognised on 19 August 2011 After meeting with Mahmoud Jibril, President Ali Bongo Ondimba announced Gabonese recognition for the NTC as the Libyan people's legitimate representative.[127][128] However the formal instruction of the President about the recognition of NTC by government in Libreville was submitted at 14 August and implemented at 19 August.[129][130] Libya's pro-Gaddafi ambassador to Gabon left the host country on 24 August after a formal request by the Gabonese government.[131] 35 Tunisia[132][133] Recognised on 20 August 2011[134] Tunisia's cabinet spokesman, Taieb Baccouche, announced that Tunisia was ready to recognise the rebels as the sole legitimate government of Libya as soon as they came to negotiate for it. It gave three reasons for this action: that the shelling of its own people rendered Gaddhafi's government illegitimate, that it still resented Gaddhafi's support to President Ben Ali during the Tunisian Revolution, and that Gaddhafi's shelling of its territory had rendered its previous strategy of neutrality ineffective.[132] Abdul Jalil visited Tunisia on 18 June to meet with Prime Minister Béji Caïd Essebsi and said that Tunisia had not recognised his government publicly, but he believed the meeting indicated de facto recognition.[135] On 20 August, the Tunis Afrique Presse (TAP) reported the Tunisian government recognised the NTC as the sole legitimate representative of the Libyan people, just after clashing with pro-Gaddafi Libyan troops in Tunisian territory the previous day. 36 New Zealand[136] Recognised on 22 August 2011 New Zealand Prime Minister John Key stated on 22 August 2011 that New Zealand's ambassador to Egypt will travel to the Libyan city of Benghazi to establish a working relationship with the Transitional National Council as the legitimate voice of the Libyan people. 37 Egypt[137][138] Recognised on 22 August 2011 Egyptian Foreign Minister Nabil Elaraby said on 25 May 2011 that his government would post former Deputy Foreign Minister Hany Khallaf in Benghazi to liaise with the council as Egypt's diplomatic envoy.

However, he reminded us that the policy of the Irish government is to recognise states and not political bodies.\"[145] However, on 22 August, in his statement on developments in Libya, the Tánaiste of Ireland stated on the Department of Foreign Affairs' website, \"The Libyan National Transitional Council is now the only authority in Libya, and I hope they will quickly be able to establish an effective government over the whole country.\" 40 Oman[146] Recognised on 23 August 2011 Citing the Associated Press, Qatar-based Libya TV reports that \"Oman has recognized Libya's revolutionary-led council as the country's legitimate international representatives\" and has broken off \"relations with Moammar Gaddafi's regime in favor of the National Transitional Council\".\n\nThe Libyan embassy in Muscat decided to join the host country in recognising the NTC.[147]\n\n41 Bahrain[148][149] Recognised on 23 August 2011 On 23 August, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Bahrain published the following announcement: \"Recalling the brotherhood and solidarity ties that link the Kingdom of Bahrain Government and people with the Libyan people, and out of the deep feelings that stem from the unity of the hopes, goals, and common destiny, and in light of recent developments in Libya, the Kingdom of Bahrain reiterates its recognition of Libya's Transitional National Council (TNC) as the sole legitimate representative of the brotherly Libyan people, wishes Libya to achieve prosperity, progress and stability, development and reconstruction.\" 42 Nigeria[150] Recognised on 23 August 2011 On 23 August it was reported by the media that \"Nigeria's government said it recognized Libya's National Transition Council as the legitimate representative of the people in the North Africa nation.\" 43 Malta[151][152] Recognised on 23 August 2011 Prime Minister Lawrence Gonzi announced on 1 June 2011 that Malta is recognising the National Transitional Council of Libya as the sole legitimate interlocutor of the Libyan people.[153] However, Foreign Minister Tonio Borg clarified on 2 June that Malta would retain an embassy in Tripoli and does not recognise the council as Libya's government, just as its legitimate interlocutor.[154] However, nine days later, Malta clarified by saying that while they recognise the NTC only as a legitimate interlocutor, they recognise it as the only legitimate interlocutor, and that their relations with Gaddafi would be cut.[151] On 18 July, Borg said Malta was continuing to consider granting \"full recognition\", but it would first have to determine what it could legally do with frozen assets belonging to Gaddafi's regime in the island country.[155] On 21 August the Libyan embassy announced that it is recognising the NTC as the sole legitimate government of Libya.[156] On 23 August, Gonzi said Malta recognised the NTC as Libya's legitimate government.[152] 44 Iraq[157] Recognised on 23 August 2011 A statement on the Iraqi Foreign Ministry website read, \"The cabinet decided today, 23 August 2011, to recognise the Libyan National Transitional Council as the only and legitimate representative of the Libyan people.\" 45 Greece[158] Recognised on 23 August 2011 After maintaining a diplomatic liaison presence in Benghazi since 15 May 2011,[159] the Greek government recognised the NTC as \"the legal entity that will lead the Libyan people to the critical new phase of a transitional process\", Greek Foreign Minister Stavros Lambrinidis said on 23 August. 46 Colombia Recognised on 23 August 2011 Colombian newspaper El Tiempo (Colombia) reported that President Juan Manuel Santos gave permission to the chancellor(minister of foreign affairs) to recognise the NTC as an interlocutor of the Libyan people.
