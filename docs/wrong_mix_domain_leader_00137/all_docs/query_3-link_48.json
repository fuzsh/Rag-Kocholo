It retaliates by threatening to strip any Slovak who applies for dual nationality of their Slovak citizenship.\n\n2010 July - Iveta Radicova of the SDKU-DS party appointed prime minister at the head of a four-party centre-right government following parliamentary elections in June.\n\n2011 October - Parliament ratifies a eurozone bailout plan after the government agrees to hold an early general election in March 2012.\n\n2012 March - Leftist opposition party Smer, led by former prime minister Robert Fico, wins landslide victory in general election, taking over half of the seats in parliament."
