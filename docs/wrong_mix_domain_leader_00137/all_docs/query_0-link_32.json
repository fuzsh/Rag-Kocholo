        "text": "The Slovak Presidency of the Council of the European Union in the second half of 2016, and its efforts to obtain the post of UN Secretary-General for Slovak Foreign Minister Miroslav Lajčák, were the key aspects determining the development of the policy of Slovakia towards the countries of the former USSR . While relations with the Russian Federation and Ukraine displayed continuity, relations with Belarus underwent a significant change. These three countries played the most important role in the Eastern policy of Slovakia in 2016.\n\nSlovak security and defence policy have experienced turbulent times and transformation since 1993. After the end of the Cold War, Slovakia also coped with the “peaceful divorce” with the Czech Republic, which has significantly influenced the geopolitical situation of Slovakia. The dissolution of Czechoslovakia predetermined Slovakia into East in terms of geopolitics. This fact has accompanied Slovak foreign and security policy in following years (till 1998). Also attempts to adapt the concept of Slovakia as the “bridge between West and East” developed by E. Beneš and T.G. Masaryk caused that Slovakia was politically pushed to the edge of Europe and the Visegrad region. Due to undemocratic practices in domestic policy and ambiguity in foreign and security policy, Slovakia was excluded from the first round of NATO enlargement. Slovakia struggled in formulating its vital interests in the field of foreign and security policy, as well as its strategic orientation, which can be seen in the strategic documents from that time, that were vague and incoherent.\n\nSlovakia’s relations with the states of Eastern Europe not only have a bilateral impact, but contain geopolitical, security and economic dimensions as well. This article analyzes the domestic, bilateral and multilateral aspects of relations between Slovakia and Russia before and after the parliamentary elections of 1998, when Slovakia adopted a pro-Western course aimed at EU and NATO membership. The article also focuses on bilateral relations with Ukraine, where Slovakia is among the most active supporters of Ukraine’s future EU membership. The final sections analyze the Eastern policy of Slovakia – particularly within the framework of the EU’s Eastern Partnership and the Visegrad Group – as well as Slovakia’s relations with the new Eastern European partners, such as Belarus, Moldova and Georgia, as target countries of Slovakia’s “soft power.”\n\nThis analytical study represents a systematic and comprehensive analysis of the Ukrainian foreign policy in 2020. Fifty one directions were analysed – from cooperation with key partners and international organizations to public diplomacy and COVID-19 pandemic consequences. Five evaluation criteria – indicators, based on the new model of research methodology, were applied. The experts have studied and assessed activities of the President, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine, the Parliamentary Committee on Foreign Affairs, and other governmental institutions and parliamentary committees involved in the development and implementation of the foreign policy of Ukraine. This book is the sixth annual study. Previous years’ analysis can be found at prismua.org\n\nThis analytical study represents a systematic and comprehensive analysis of the Ukrainian foreign policy in 2018.
