The Economist’s style book does this and a bit more. It also warns writers of some common mistakes and encourages them to write with clarity and simplicity. All the prescriptive judgments in the style guide are directly derived from those used each week in writing and editing The Economist. This ninth edition of the “The Economist Style Guide” is in three parts. The first is based on the style book used by those who edit The Economist; it is largely the work of John Grimond, who has over the years been Britain, American and foreign editor. The second, on American and British English, describes some of the main differences between the two great English-speaking areas, in spelling, grammar and usage. To make the style guide of greater general interest, Part 3 consists of information drawing on the reference books published under The Economist Books imprint and expanded to include handy reference material that might appeal to readers of The Economist. Such information is checked and new matter included for every new edition. For this edition the text in Part 3 has been extensively reviewed and reorganised to make the book more modern and up to date. Throughout the text, italic type is used for examples except where they are presented in lists, when the type is Roman, as this text is. Words in bold indicate a separate but relevant entry, that is, a crossreference. Small capitals are used only in the way The Economist uses them, for which see the entries abbreviations and capitals.\n\nvi\n\nIntroduction On only two scores can The Economist hope to outdo its rivals consistently. One is the quality of its analysis; the other is the quality of its writing. The aim of this book is to give some general advice on writing, to point out some common errors and to set some arbitrary rules. The first requirement of The Economist is that it should be readily understandable. Clarity of writing usually follows clarity of thought. So think what you want to say, then say it as simply as possible. Keep in mind George Orwell’s six elementary rules (“Politics and the English Language”, 1946): 1 2 3 4 5 6\n\nNever use a metaphor, simile or other figure of speech which you are used to seeing in print (see metaphors). Never use a long word where a short one will do (see short words). If it is possible to cut out a word, always cut it out (see unnecessary words). Never use the passive where you can use the active (see grammar and syntax). Never use a foreign phrase, a scientific word or a jargon word if you can think of an everyday English equivalent (see jargon). Break any of these rules sooner than say anything outright barbarous (see iconoclasm).\n\nReaders are primarily interested in what you have to say. By the way in which you say it you may encourage them either to read on or to give up. If you want them to read on: Do not be stuffy “To write a genuine, familiar or truly English style”, said Hazlitt, “is to write as anyone would speak in common conversation who had a thorough command or choice of words or who could discourse with ease, force and perspicuity setting aside all pedantic and oratorical flourishes.” Use the language of everyday speech, not that of spokesmen, lawyers or bureaucrats (so prefer let to permit, people to persons, buy to purchase, colleague to peer, way out to exit, present to gift, rich to wealthy, show to demonstrate, break to violate). Pomposity 1\n\nintroduction\n\nand long-windedness tend to obscure meaning, or reveal the lack of it: strip them away in favour of plain words. Do not be hectoring or arrogant Those who disagree with you are not necessarily stupid or insane. Nobody needs to be described as silly: let your analysis show that he is. When you express opinions, do not simply make assertions. The aim is not just to tell readers what you think, but to persuade them; if you use arguments, reasoning and evidence, you may succeed. Go easy on the oughts and shoulds. Do not be too pleased with yourself Don’t boast of your own cleverness by telling readers that you correctly predicted something or that you have a scoop. You are more likely to bore or irritate them than to impress them. Do not be too chatty Surprise, surprise is more irritating than informative. So is Ho, ho and, in the middle of a sentence, wait for it, etc. Do not be too didactic If too many sentences begin Compare, Consider, Expect, Imagine, Look at, Note, Prepare for, Remember or Take, readers will think they are reading a textbook (or, indeed, a style book). Do your best to be lucid (“I see but one rule: to be clear”, Stendhal) Simple sentences help. Keep complicated constructions and gimmicks to a minimum, if necessary by remembering the New Yorker’s comment: “Backward ran sentences until reeled the mind.” The following letter from a reader may be chastening: Sir At times just one sentence in The Economist can give us hours of enjoyment, such as “Yet German diplomats in Belgrade failed to persuade their government that it was wrong to think that the threat of international recognition of Croatia and Slovenia would itself deter Serbia.” During my many years as a reader of your newspaper, I have distilled two lessons about the use of our language. Firstly, it is usually easier to write a double negative than it is to interpret it. Secondly, unless the description of an event which is considered to be not without consequence includes a double or higher-order 2\n\nintroduction\n\nnegative, then it cannot be disproven that the writer has neglected to eliminate other interpretations of the event which are not satisfactory in light of other possibly not unrelated events which might not have occurred at all. For these reasons, I have not neglected your timely reminder that I ought not to let my subscription lapse. It certainly cannot be said that I am an unhappy reader. Willard Dunning Mark Twain described how a good writer treats sentences: “At times he may indulge himself with a long one, but he will make sure there are no folds in it, no vaguenesses, no parenthetical interruptions of its view as a whole; when he has done with it, it won’t be a sea-serpent with half of its arches under the water; it will be a torch-light procession.” Long paragraphs, like long sentences, can confuse the reader. “The paragraph”, according to Fowler, “is essentially a unit of thought, not of length; it must be homogeneous in subject matter and sequential in treatment.” One-sentence paragraphs should be used only occasionally. Clear thinking is the key to clear writing. “A scrupulous writer”, observed Orwell, “in every sentence that he writes will ask himself at least four questions, thus: What am I trying to say? What words will express it? What image or idiom will make it clearer? Is this image fresh enough to have an effect? And he will probably ask himself two more: Could I put it more shortly? Have I said anything that is avoidably ugly?” Scrupulous writers will also notice that their copy is edited only lightly and is likely to be used. It may even be read.\n\n3\n\nA note on editing Editing has always made a large contribution to The Economist’s excellence. It should continue to do so. But editing on a screen is beguilingly simple. It is quite easy to rewrite an article without realising that one has done much to it at all: the cursor leaves no trace of crossings-out, handwritten insertions, rearranged sentences or reordered paragraphs. The temptation is to continue to make changes until something emerges that the editor himself might have written. One benefit of this is a tightly edited newspaper. One cost is a certain sameness. The risk is that the newspaper will turn into a collection of 70 or 80 articles which read as though they have been written by no more than half a dozen hands. The Economist has a single editorial outlook, and it is anonymous. But it is the work of many people, both in London and abroad, as its datelines testify. If the prose of our Tokyo correspondent is indistinguishable from the prose of our Nairobi correspondent, readers will feel they are being robbed of variety. They may also wonder whether these two people really exist, or whether the entire newspaper is not written in London. The moral for editors is that they should respect good writing. That is mainly what this style sheet is designed to promote. It is not intended to impose a single style on all The Economist’s journalists. A writer’s style, after all, should reflect his mind and personality. So long as they are compatible with The Economist’s editorial outlook, and so long as the prose is good, editors should exercise suitable self-restraint. Remember that your copy, too, will be edited. And even if you think you are not guilty, bear in mind this comment from John Gross: Most writers I know have tales to tell of being mangled by editors and mauled by fact-checkers, and naturally it is the flagrant instances they choose to single out - absurdities, outright distortions of meaning, glaring errors. But most of the damage done is a good deal less spectacular. It consists of small changes (usually too boring to describe to anyone else) that flatten a writer’s style, slow down his argument, neutralise his irony; that ruin the rhythm of a sentence or the balance of paragraph; that deaden the tone that makes the music. I sometimes think of the process as one of “desophistication”. John Grimond 4\n\npart part 11 the essence of style\n\na a or the see grammar and syntax. abbreviations Unless an abbreviation (or acronym) is so familiar that it is used more often than the full form:\n\naids bbc cia eu fbi hiv imf nato ngo oecd unesco or unless the full form would provide little illumination – awacs, dna – write the words in full on first appearance: thus, Trades Union Congress (not tuc). If in doubt about its familiarity, explain what the organisation is or does. After the first mention, try not to repeat the abbreviation too often; so write the agency rather than the iaea, the party rather than the kmt, to avoid spattering the page with capital letters. There is no need to give the initials of an organisation if it is not referred to again. Do not use spatterings of abbreviations and acronyms simply in order to cram more words in; you will end up irritating readers rather than informing them. An article in a recent issue of The Economist contained the following:\n\ncia dci dni dod dvd fbi nctc nsa The article immediately following had:\n\nctac cx dis fco gchq it jic jtac mi5 mi6 mp scope wmd Some of these are well known to most readers and can readily be held in the mind. But unfamiliar abbreviations may oblige the reader to be constantly referring back to the first use. Better to repeat some names in full, or to write the agency, the committee, the party, etc, than to allow an undisciplined proliferation. And prefer chief executive or boss to ceo.\n\n6\n\nabbreviations\n\nampersands should be used: 1 when they are part of the name of a company: Procter & Gamble Pratt & Whitney 2 for such things as constituencies where two names are linked to form one unit: The rest of Brighouse & Spenborough joins with the Batley part of Batley & Morley to form Batley & Spen. The area thus became the Pakistani province of Kashmir and the Indian state of Jammu & Kashmir. 3 in r&d and s&l. definite article If an abbreviation can be pronounced – efta, nato, unesco – it does not generally require the definite article. Other organisations, except companies, should usually be preceded by the: the bbc the kgb the nhs the niesr the unhcr elements do not take small caps when abbreviated: carbon dioxide is CO2 chlorofluorocarbons are CFCs lead is Pb methane is CH4 the oxides of nitrogen are generally NOX Different isotopes of the same element are distinguished by raised (superscript) prefixes: carbon-14 is 14C helium-3 is 3He headings, cross-heads, captions, etc In headings, rubrics, crossheads, footnotes, captions, tables, charts (including sources), use ordinary caps, not small caps. initials in people’s and companies’ names take points (with a space between initials and name, but not between initials). In general, follow the practice preferred by people, companies and organisations in writing their own names. F.W. de Klerk E.I. Du Pont de Nemours V.P. Singh F.W. Woolworth\n\n7\n\npart 1: the essence of style\n\njunior and senior Spell out in full (and lower case) junior and senior after a name: George Bush junior George Bush senior lower case Abbreviate: kilograms (not kilogrammes) to kg kilometres per hour to kph kilometres to kg (or kilos) and km miles per hour to mph Use lower case for kg, km, lb (never lbs), mph and other measures, and for ie, eg, which should both be followed by commas. When used with figures, these lower-case abbreviations should follow immediately, with no space: 11am 4.30pm 15kg 35mm 100mph 78rpm. Two abbreviations together, however, must be separated: 60m b/d. Use b/d not bpd as an abbreviation for barrels per day. MPs Except in British contexts, use mp only after first spelling out member of Parliament in full (in many places an mp is a military policeman). Members of the Scottish Parliament are msps. Members of the European Parliament are meps (not Euro-mps). organisations\n\nefta is the European Free Trade Association. ida is the International Development Association. nafta is the North American Free-Trade Agreement. the fao is the Food and Agriculture Organisation. the fda is the Food and Drug Administration. the plo is the Palestine Liberation Organisation. pronounceable abbreviations Abbreviations that can be pronounced and are composed of bits of words rather than just initials should be spelt out in upper and lower case: Cocom Frelimo Kfor Legco 8\n\nMercosur Nepad Renamo Sfor\n\nUnicef Unisom Unprofor\n\nabbreviations\n\nAnd Trips (trade-related aspects of intellectual property rights). There is generally no need for more than one initial capital letter, unless the word is a company or a trade name: MiG, ConsGold. ranks and titles Do not use Prof, Sen, Col, etc. Lieut-Colonel and Lieut-Commander are permissible. So is Rev, but it must be preceded by the and followed by a Christian name or initial: the Rev Jesse Jackson (thereafter Mr Jackson). scientific units named after individuals Most scientific units, except those of temperature, that are named after individuals, should be set in small capitals, though any attachments denoting multiples go in lower case: ampère is a or amp öhm is o watt is w kilowatt, 1,000 watts, is kw milliwatt, one-thousandth of a watt, is mw megawatt, 1m watts, is mw small caps usage 1\n\nIn the text abbreviations, whether they can be pronounced as words or not:\n\ngnp gdp fob cif a-levels d-marks t-shirts x-rays\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4 5\n\nshould be set in small capitals, with no points, unless they are currencies like Nkr or SFr, elements like H and O or degrees of temperature like °F and °C. Brackets, apostrophes and all other typographical furniture accompanying small capitals are generally set in ordinary roman, with a lower-case s (also roman) for plurals and genitives: ious, mps’ salaries, sdrs, etc. Ampersands are set as small capitals, as are numerals and any hyphens attaching them to a small capital (see also below). Thus: r&d a23 m1 f-16 ad and bc (76ad, 55bc): figures and numbers thus joined should both be set in small capitals. Abbreviations that include upper-case and lower-case\n\n9\n\npart 1: the essence of style\n\n6\n\nletters must be set in a mixture of small capitals and roman: bphils, phds. Do not use small caps for roman numerals.\n\nwriting out upper-case abbreviations Most upper-case abbreviations take upper-case initial letters when written in full. The lso is the London Symphony Orchestra. However, there are exceptions:\n\ncap but common agricultural policy emu but economic and monetary union gdp but gross domestic product psbr but public-sector borrowing requirement vlsi but very large-scale integration miscellaneous Spell out: page pages hectares miles Remember, too, that the V of hiv stands for virus, so do not write hiv virus. See measures in Part 3. absent In Latin absent is a verb meaning they are away. In English it is either an adjective (absent friends) or a verb (to absent yourself). It is not a preposition meaning in the absence of. accents On words now accepted as English, use accents only when they make a crucial difference to pronunciation: café cliché communiqué exposé façade soupçon But: chateau decor elite feted naive The main accents and diacritical signs are: acute grave circumflex umlaut cedilla tilde\n\n10\n\nrépublique grand’mère bête noire Länder, Österreich (Austria) français señor, São Paulo\n\naccents\n\n> affirmative action\n\nIf you use one accent (except the tilde – strictly, a diacritical sign), use all: émigré mêlée protégé résumé Put the accents and diacritical signs on French, German, Spanish and Portuguese names and words: José Manuel Barroso Federico Peña\n\nFrançoise de Panafieu Wolfgang Schäuble\n\nLeave accents and diacritical signs off other foreign names. Any foreign word in italics should, however, be given its proper accents. (See also italics.) acronym A pronounceable word, formed from the initials of other words, like radar or nato. It is not a set of initials, like the bbc or the imf. actionable means giving ground for a lawsuit. Do not use it to mean susceptible of being put into practice: prefer practical. active, not passive Be direct. A hit B describes the event more concisely than B was hit by A. adjectives and adverbs see grammar and syntax, punctuation. adjectives of proper nouns see grammar and syntax, punctuation. address What did journalists and politicians do in the days, not so long ago, when address was used as a verb only before objects such as audience, letter, ball, haggis and, occasionally, themselves? Questions can be answered, issues discussed, problems solved, difficulties dealt with. See clichés. aetiology is the science of causation, or an inquiry into something’s origins. Etiolate is to make or become pale for lack of light. affect the verb, means to have an influence on, as in the novel affected his attitude to immigrants. See also effect. affirmative action is a euphemism, uglier even than human-rights abuses and more obscure even than comfort station, with little to be said for it. It is too late to suppress it altogether and perhaps 11\n\npart 1: the essence of style\n\ntoo soon to consign it to the midden of civil-rights studies, but try to avoid it as much as possible. If you cannot escape it, put it in quotation marks on first mention and, unless the context makes its meaning clear, explain what it is. You may, however, find that preferential treatment, job preferment or even discrimination serve just as well as alternatives. See euphemisms. affordable By whom? Avoid affordable housing, affordable computers and other unthinking uses of advertising lingo. Afghan names see names. aggravate means make worse, not irritate or annoy. aggression is an unattractive quality, so do not call a keen salesman an aggressive one (unless his foot is in the door). agony column Remember that when Sherlock Holmes perused this, it was a personal column. Only recently has it come to mean letters to an agony aunt. agree Things are agreed on, to or about, not just agreed. alibi An alibi is the fact of being elsewhere, not a false explanation. alternate, alternative Alternate (as an adjective) means every other. Alternative (as a noun), strictly, means one of two, not one of three, four, five or more (which may be options). As an adjective, alternative means of two (or, loosely, more) things, or possible as an alternative. Americanisms Many American words and expressions have passed into the language; others have vigour, particularly if used sparingly. Some are short and to the point, so for example prefer lay off to make redundant. Spat and scam, two words beloved by some journalists, have the merit of brevity, but so do row and fraud; squabble and swindle might sometimes be used instead. But many words favoured in American English usage are unnecessarily long, so use: and not additionally the army not the military (noun) car not automobile 12\n\nAmericanisms\n\ncompany not corporation court not courtroom or courthouse district not neighbourhood normality not normalcy oblige not obligate rocket not skyrocket speciality not specialty stocks not inventories, unless there is the risk of confusion with stocks and shares) transport not transportation Other Americanisms are euphemistic or obscure, so avoid: affirmative action ball games end runs\n\npoint men rookies stand-off\n\nadverbs Put adverbs where you would put them in normal speech, which is usually after the verb (not before it, which usually is where Americans put them). avoiding nouning adjectives Similarly, do not noun adjectives such as: advisory – prefer warning centennial – prefer centenary inaugural – prefer inauguration meet (verb) – meeting is better spend (verb) – spending is preferable avoiding verbing and adjectiving nouns Try not to verb nouns or to adjective them. So do not: access files author books (still less co-author them) critique style guides gun someone down, use shoot haemorrhage red ink (haemorrhage is a noun) let one event impact another loan money pressure colleagues (press will do) progress reports source inputs trial programmes 13\n\npart 1: the essence of style\n\nAvoid parenting (or using the word) and parenting skills. (See also grammar and syntax.) And though it is sometimes necessary to use nouns as adjectives, there is no need to call: an attempted coup a coup attempt a suspected terrorist a terrorist suspect the Californian legislature the California legislature Vilest of all is the habit of throwing together several nouns into one ghastly adjectival reticule: Texas millionaire real-estate developer and failed thrift entrepreneur Hiram Turnipseed ... coining words Avoid coining verbs and adjectives unnecessarily. Instead of: dining experiences and writing experiences: use dining and writing downplaying criticism, you can play it down (or perhaps minimise it) skiing Vail, ski at Vail upcoming and ongoing are better put as forthcoming and continuing Why outfit your children when you can fit them out? old-fashioned terms Some American expressions that were once common in English English (and some still used in Scottish English) now sound old-fashioned to most British ears. So prefer: clothes or clothing to apparel or garments doctors to physicians got to gotten lawyers to attorneys often to oftentimes over or too to overly overuse of American words Do not feel obliged to follow American fashion in overusing such words as: constituency – try supporters gubernatorial – this means “relating to a governor” perception – try belief or view 14\n\nAmericanisms\n\nrhetoric (of which there is too little, not too much) – try language or speeches or exaggeration if that is what you mean some differences In an American context you may run for office (but please stand in countries with parliamentary systems) and your car may sometimes run on gasoline instead of petrol. But if you use corn in the American sense you should explain that this is maize to most people (unless it is an old chestnut). Slate can also mean abuse (as a verb) but does not, in Britain, mean predict, schedule or nominate. And if you must use American expressions, use them correctly (a rain-check does not imply checking on the weather outside). In Britain: Cars are hired, not rented, and are left in car parks, not parking lots. City centres are not central cities. Companies: call for a record profit if you wish to exhort the workers, but not if you merely predict one. And do not post it if it has been achieved. If it has not, look for someone new to head, not head up, the company. Countries, nations and states: London is the country’s capital, not the nation’s. If you wish to build a nation, you will bind its peoples together; if you wish to build a state, you will forge its institutions. Deep: make a deep study or even a study in depth, but not an in-depth study. Ex-servicemen are not necessarily veterans. Football for most people is a game – you do not have to call it a sport – that Americans call soccer. Do not figure out if you can work out. Fresh should be used of vegetables, not teenagers. Grow a beard or a tomato but not a company (or indeed a salesman: the Financial Times reported on August 8th 2003 that bmw was “to grow its own car salesmen”). Hikes are walks, not increases. Hospital: when we are seriously ill we are in hospital, not in the hospital, still less hospitalised. Do not use likely to mean probably. Make a rumpus rather than a ruckus, be rumbustious rather than rambunctious, and snigger rather than snicker. On-site inspections are allowed, but not on-train teams or in-ear headphones. 15\n\npart 1: the essence of style\n\nOutside America, nowadays, you stay outside the door, not outside of it. Programme: you may program a computer but in all other contexts the word is programme. Keep a promise, rather than deliver on it. Raise cattle and pigs, but children are (or should be) brought up. Regular is not a synonym for ordinary or normal: Mussolini brought in the regular train, All-Bran the regular man; it is quite normal to be without either. A religious group sounds better than a faith-based organisation. Scenarios are best kept for the theatre, postures for the gym, parameters for the parabola. School: children are at school, not in it. Do not task people, or meet with them. Throw stones, not rock. Trains run from railway stations, not train stations. The people in them, and on buses, are passengers, not riders. Use senior rather than ranking. And only the speechless are dumb, the well-dressed (and a few devices) smart and the insane mad. tenses Choose tenses according to British usage, too. In particular, do not fight shy – as Americans often do – of the perfect tense, especially where no date or time is given. Thus: Mr Bush has woken up to the danger is preferable to Mr Bush woke up to the danger, unless you can add last week or when he heard the explosion. Do not write Your salary just got smaller or I shrunk the kids. In British English Your salary has just got smaller and I’ve shrunk the kids. See also adjectives of proper nouns, euphemisms, grammar and syntax, and Part 2. aircraft see hyphens and italics. among and between Some sticklers insist that, where division is involved, among should be used where three or more are concerned, between where only two are concerned. So: The plum jobs were shared among the Socialists, the Liberals and\n\n16\n\namong and between\n\n> anon\n\nthe Christian Democrats, while the president and the vice-president divided the cash between themselves. This distinction is unnecessary. But take care with between. To fall between two stools, however painful, is grammatically acceptable; to fall between the cracks is to challenge the laws of physics. Prefer among to amongst. an should be used before a word beginning with a vowel sound (an egg, an umbrella, an MP) or an h if, and only if, the h is silent (an honorary degree). But a European, a university, a U-turn, a hospital, a hotel. Historical is an exception: it is preceded by an, the h remaining silent. anarchy means the complete absence of law or government. It may be harmonious or chaotic. animals For the spelling of the Latin names of animals, plants, etc, see Latin names. annus horribilis, annus mirabilis Annus horribilis is often used, presumably in contrast to annus mirabilis, to describe an awful year, for example by Queen Elizabeth in 1992 (the year of her daughter’s divorce, the separation of the Duke and Duchess of York and a fire at Windsor Castle) and by Kofi Annan in 2004 (a year of scandal and controversy at the United Nations). It serves its purpose well, but it should be noted that annus mirabilis originally meant much the same thing: 1666, of which it was first used, was the year of the great fire of London and the second year of the great plague in England, although English spirits were lifted a bit by a defeat of the Dutch navy. Physicists, however, have latterly used the term to describe 1932, the year in which the neutron was discovered, the positron identified and the atomic nucleus first broken up artificially. And Philip Larkin, more understandably, used it to describe 1963, the year in which sexual intercourse began. anon means soon, though it once meant straight away. Presently also means soon, though it is increasingly misused to mean now. (See also presently.)\n\n17\n\npart 1: the essence of style\n\nanticipate does not mean expect. Jack and Jill expected to marry; if they anticipated marriage, only Jill might find herself expectant. apostasy, heresy If you abandon your religion, you commit apostasy. If that religion is the prevailing one in your community and your beliefs are contrary to its orthodoxy, you commit heresy. apostrophes see punctuation. appeal is intransitive nowadays (except in America), so appeal against decisions. appraise means set a price on. Apprise means inform. Arabic The Arabic alphabet has several consonants which have no exact equivalents in English: for example, a hard t as well as a normal soft one, a hard s as well as a soft one, two different (one vocalised, the other not) th sounds. Moreover, there are three sounds – a glottal stop like a hiccup, a glottal sound akin to strangulation and a uvular trill like a Frenchman gargling. Ultrafastidious transliterators try to reproduce these subtleties with a profusion of apostrophes and hs which yield spellings like Mu’ammar al-Qadhdhafi. The risk of error and the sheer ugliness on the page are too great to justify the effort, so usually ignore the differences. Vowels present a lesser problem. There are only three – a, u, i – but each can be lengthened. Do not bother to differentiate between the short and the long a. Occasionally, a spelling is established where the u has been lengthened by using oo, as in Sultan Qaboos. In such instances, follow that convention, but in general go for ou, as in murabitoun or Ibn Khaldoun. For a long i you should normally use ee (as in mujahideen). Muhammad is the correct spelling unless it is part of the name of someone who spells it differently. (See also names.) as of say, April 5th or April. Prefer on (or after, or since) April 5th, in April. assassinate is, properly, the term used not just for any old killing, but for the murder of a prominent person, usually for a political purpose.\n\n18\n\nas to\n\n> avocation\n\nas to There is usually a more appropriate preposition than as to. autarchy, autarky Autarchy means absolute sovereignty. Autarky means self-sufficiency. avocation An avocation is a distraction or diversion from your ordinary employment, not a synonym for vocation.\n\n19\n\nb bail, bale In the hayfield, bale; otherwise bail, bail out and bail-out (noun). Bangladeshi names see names. -based A Paris-based group may be all right, if, say, that group operates abroad (otherwise just say a group in Paris). But avoid communitybased, faith-based, knowledge-based, etc. A community-based organisation is perhaps a community organisation; a faith-based organisation is probably a church (or might it be the Labour or Republican Party?); a knowledge-based industry needs explanation: all industries depend on knowledge. beg the question means neither raise the question, invite the question nor evade the answer. To beg the question is to adopt an argument whose conclusion depends upon assuming the truth of the very conclusion the argument is designed to produce. All governments should promote free trade because otherwise protectionism will increase. This begs the question. Belarusian names see names. bellwether This is the leading sheep of a flock, on whose neck a bell is hung. It is nothing to do with climate, prevailing winds or the like, but the term is used in the stockmarket. between see among and between. biannual, biennial Biannual can mean twice a year or once every two years. Avoid. Since biennial also means once every two years, that is best avoided too. bicentennial Prefer bicentenary (as a noun).\n\n20\n\nblack\n\n> by contrast, in contrast\n\nblack In the black means in profit in Britain, but making losses in some places. Use in profit. blooded, bloodied Blooded means pedigreed (as in blue-blooded) or initiated. Bloodied means wounded. bon vivant not bon viveur. both ... and A preposition placed after both should be repeated after and. Thus both to right and to left; but to both right and left is all right. brackets see punctuation. British titles see titles. brokerage is what a stockbroking firm does, not what it is. by contrast, in contrast Use by contrast only when you are comparing one thing with another: Somalia is a poor country. By contrast, Egypt is rich. This means Egypt is rich by comparision with Somalia, though by other standards it is poor. If you are simply noting a difference, say in contrast: Tony Blair takes his holidays in Tuscany. In contrast, Gordon Brown goes to Kirkaldy.\n\n21\n\nc cadre Keep this word for the framework of a military unit or the officers of such a unit, not for a communist functionary. calibres see hyphens. Cambodian names see names. Canute’s exercise on the seashore was designed to persuade his courtiers of what he knew to be true but they doubted, ie, that he was not omnipotent. Don’t imply he was surprised to get his feet wet. capitals A balance has to be struck between so many capitals that the eyes dance and so few that the reader is diverted more by our style than by our substance. The general rules are to dignify with capital letters organisations and institutions, but not people; and full names, but not informal ones. More exact rules are laid out below. Even these, however, leave some decisions to individual judgment. If in doubt use lower case unless it looks absurd. And remember that “a foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds” (Emerson). avoiding confusion Use capitals to avoid confusion, especially with no (and therefore yes). In Bergen no votes predominated suggests a stalemate, whereas In Bergen No votes predominated suggests a triumph of noes over yeses. In most contexts, though, yes and no should be lower case: “The answer is no.” Organisations with unusual or misleading names, such as the African National Congress and Civic Forum, may become the Congress and the Forum on second and subsequent mentions. cities City with a capital, even though City is not an integral part of their names:\n\n22\n\ncapitals\n\nGuatemala City Ho Chi Minh City Kuwait City Mexico City\n\nNew York City Panama City Quebec City\n\nCity also takes a capital when it is part of the name: Dodge City Kansas City Oklahoma City\n\nQuezon City Salt Lake City\n\ncompass points Lower case for: east west north south except when part of a name (North Korea, South Africa, West End) or part of a thinking group: the South, the Mid-West, the West (but lower case for vaguer areas such as the American north-east, north-west, south-east, south-west). If you are, say, comparing regions some of which would normally be upper case and some lower case, and it would look odd to leave them that way, put them all lower case: House prices in the north-east and the south are rising faster than those in the mid-west and the south-west. The regions of Africa are southern, east, west and north Africa. But South Africa is the name of the country. The third world (an unsatisfactory term now that the communist second world has disappeared) is lower case. Europe Europe’s divisions are no longer neatly political, and are now geographically imprecise, so use lower case for central, eastern and western Europe. Use West Germany (West Berlin) and East Germany (East Berlin) only in historical references. They are now west or western Germany (Berlin) and east or eastern Germany (eastern Berlin). The Basque country (or region) is ill-defined and contentious, and may include parts of both France and Spain, so lower case for country (or region). Euro-terms The usual rules apply for the full, proper names (with informal equivalents on the right below). Thus:\n\n23\n\npart 1: the essence of style\n\nEuropean Commission European Parliament European Union Treaty of Rome Treaty on European Union\n\nthe commission the parliament the Union the Rome treaty the Maastricht treaty\n\nThe eu grouping may be called eu-15, eu-25 When making Euro- or euro-words, always introduce a hyphen, except for Europhile, Europhobe and Eurosceptic. Prefer euro zone or euro area (two words, no hyphen) to euro-land. Eurobond Euroyen bond cap is the common agricultural policy. emu stands for economic and (not European) monetary union. erm is the exchange-rate mechanism. igc is an inter-governmental conference. finance In finance there are particular exceptions to the general rule of initial caps for full names, lower case for informal ones. There are also rules about what to do on second mention. Deutschmarks are still known just as d-marks, even though all references are historical. Special drawing rights are lower case but are abbreviated as sdr. The Bank of England and its foreign equivalents have initial caps when named formally and separately, but collectively they are central banks in lower case, except those like Brazil’s and Ireland’s, which are actually named the Central Bank. The Bank of England becomes the bank on second mention. The IMF may become the fund on second mention. The World Bank and the Fed (after first spelling it out as the Federal Reserve) take initial upper case, although these are shortened, informal names. The World Bank becomes the bank on second mention. Treasury bonds issued by America’s Treasury should be upper case; treasury bills (or bonds) of a general kind should be lower case. Avoid t-bonds and t-bills.\n\n24\n\ncapitals\n\nhistorical terms Black Death Cultural Revolution the Depression Holocaust (Hitler’s) Middle Ages New Deal\n\nReconstruction Renaissance Restoration Thirty Years War Year of the Dog (but new year)\n\nlabels formed from proper names A political, economic or religious label formed from a proper name should have a capital: Buddhism Christian Finlandisation Gaullism Hindu Hobbesian Islamic Jacobite\n\nLeninist Luddite Maronite Marxist Napoleonic Paisleyite Thatcherism\n\nNote that Indian castes are lower-case italic, except for brahmin, which has now become an English word and is therefore lower-case roman (unless it is mentioned along with several other less familiar caste names in italic). organisations, institutions, acts, etc 1 Organisations, ministries, departments, treaties, acts, etc, generally take upper case when their full name (or something pretty close to it, eg, State Department) is used. Amnesty International Arab League Bank of England (the bank) Central Committee Court of Appeal the Crown (Britain) Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (defra) Department of State (the department) European Commission Forestry Commission Health and Safety at Work Act\n\n25\n\npart 1: the essence of style\n\nHigh Court House of Commons House of Lords House of Representatives Household Cavalry Metropolitan Police Ministry of Defence New York Stock Exchange Oxford University Politburo Scottish Parliament (the parliament) Senate St Paul’s Cathedral (the cathedral) Supreme Court Treasury Treaty of Rome Welsh Assembly (the assembly) World Bank (the bank) 2 Organisations with unusual or misleading names, such as the African National Congress and Civic Forum, may become the Congress and the Forum on second and subsequent mentions. 3 But most other organisations – agencies, banks, commissions (including the European Commission and the European Union), etc – take lower case when referred to incompletely on second mention. 4 Informal names Organisations, committees, commissions, special groups, etc, that are impermanent, ad hoc, local or relatively insignificant should be lower case: international economic subcommittee of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee Market Blandings rural district council Oxford University bowls club subcommittee on journalists’ rights of the National Executive Committee of the Labour Party 5 Rough descriptions or translations Use lower case for rough descriptions (the safety act, the American health department, the French parliament, as distinct\n\n26\n\ncapitals\n\nfrom its National Assembly). If you are not sure whether the English translation of a foreign name is exact or not, assume it is rough and use lower case. 6 Congress and Parliament Congress and Parliament are upper case, unless parliament is used not to describe the institution but the period of time for which it sits. This bill will not be brought forward until the next parliament. But congressional and parliamentary are lower case, as is the opposition, even when used in the sense of her majesty’s loyal opposition. The government, the administration and the cabinet are always lower case. After first mention, the House of Commons (or Lords, or Representatives) becomes the House. 7 Acts In America acts given the names of their sponsors (eg, GlassSteagall, Helms-Burton) are always rough descriptions (see above) and so take a lower-case act. people 1 Ranks and titles Use upper case when written in conjunction with a name, but lower case when on their own: Colonel Qaddafi, but the colonel Pope John Paul, but the pope President Bush, but the president Queen Elizabeth, but the queen Vice-President Cheney, but the vice-president Do not write Prime Minister Blair or Defence Secretary Rumsfeld; they are the prime minister, Mr Blair, and the defence secretary, Mr Rumsfeld. You might, however, write Chancellor Schröder. 2 Office-holders When referred to merely by their office, not by their name, office-holders are lower case: the chairman of British Airways the chancellor of the exchequer 27\n\npart 1: the essence of style\n\nthe foreign secretary the president of the United States the prime minister the speaker the treasury secretary The only exceptions are a few titles that would look unduly peculiar without capitals: Black Rod Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster Lord Chancellor Lord Privy Seal Master of the Rolls and a few exalted people, such as: the Dalai Lama, the Aga Khan. Also God and the Prophet. 3 Some titles serve as names, and therefore have initial capitals, though they also serve as descriptions: the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Emir of Kuwait. If you want to describe the office rather than the individual, use lower case: The next archbishop of Canterbury will be a woman. Since the demise of the ninth duke, there has never been another duke of Portland. places Use upper case for definite geographical places, regions, areas and countries (The Hague, Transylvania, Germany), and for vague but recognised political or geographical areas (but see Europe, page 23): Central, South, East and South-East Asia the Gulf East Asia (which is to be preferred to the Far East) Highlands (of Scotland) Middle East Midlands (of England) North Atlantic North, Central and South America South Atlantic the West (as in the decline of the West) West Country Use capitals for particular buildings even if the name is not strictly accurate, eg, the Foreign Office.\n\n28\n\ncapitals\n\nAnd if in doubt use lower case (the sunbelt). political terms 1 The full name of political parties is upper case, including the word party: Communist (if a particular party) Labour Party Peasants’ Party Republican Party 2 But note that some parties do not have party as part of their names, so this should therefore be lower case: Greece’s New Democracy party India’s Congress party Indonesia’s Golkar party Turkey’s Justice and Development party 3 Note that usually only people are: Democrats Christian Democrats Liberal Democrats or Social Democrats. Their parties, policies, candidates, committees, etc, are: Democratic Christian Democratic Liberal Democratic or Social Democratic (although a committee may be Democratcontrolled). The exceptions are Britain’s Liberal Democrat Party and Thailand’s Democrat Party. 4 When referring to a specific party, write Labour, the Republican nominee, a prominent Liberal, etc, but use lower case in looser references to liberals, conservatism, communists, etc. Tories, however, are upper case, as is New Labour. province, county, river, state, city Lower case when not strictly part of the name: Cabanas province Limpopo river Mississippi River\n\nNew York state River Thames Washington state\n\ntrade names Use capitals: Hoover Teflon Valium Walkman\n\n29\n\npart 1: the essence of style\n\nmiscellaneous (lower case) 19th amendment (but Article 19) aborigines amazon (female warrior) angst blacks cabinet civil servant civil service civil war (even America’s) cold war common market communist (generally) constitution (even America’s) cruise missile draconian first world war french windows general synod gentile government Gulf war gypsy internet junior (as in George Bush junior) Kyoto protocol the left mafia (any old group of criminals) miscellaneous (upper case) Anglophone (but prefer English-speaking) Antichrist anti-Semitism Atlanticist the Bar the Bible Catholics CD-ROM (should be set in small capitals) 30\n\nmecca (when used as a mecca for tourists) new year (but New Year’s Day) Olympic games (and Asian, Commonwealth, European, etc) opposition philistine platonic the pope the press pyrrhic the queen quisling realpolitik revolution (everyone’s) the right second world war senior (as in George Bush senior) six-day war the shah the speaker state-of-the-union message titanic white paper wild west world wide web young turk\n\nChrist Christmas Day Christmas Eve Coloureds (in South Africa) the Cup Final the Davis Cup Earth (when, and only when, it is being discussed as a planet like Mars or Venus)\n\ncapitals\n\nFrancophone (but prefer French-speaking) Hispanics House of Laity Koran Labour Day Mafia (the genuine article) May Day Mecca (in Saudi Arabia, California and Liberia) Memorial Day New Year’s Day New Year’s Eve Pershing missile (because it is named after somebody) Protestants Quartet (United States, EU, Russia, the UN)\n\n> challenge\n\nthe Queen’s Speech Russify Semitic (-ism) Social Security (in American contexts only, where it is used to mean pensions; what is usually understood by social security elsewhere is welfare in the United States) Stealth fighter, bomber Teamster Ten Commandments Test match Utopia (-n) Warsaw Pact\n\ncartel A cartel is a group that restricts supply in order to drive up prices. Do not use it to describe any old syndicate or association of producers – especially of drugs. case “There is perhaps no single word so freely resorted to as a trouble-saver,” says Gowers, “and consequently responsible for so much flabby writing.” Often you can do without it. There are many cases of it being unnecessary is better as It is often unnecessary. If it is the case that simply means If. It is not the case means It is not so. Cassandra Do not use Cassandra just as a synonym for a prophet of doom. The most notable characteristic about her was that her predictions were always correct but never believed. catalyst A catalyst is something that speeds up a chemical reaction while itself remaining unchanged. Do not confuse it with one of the agents. Central Asian names see names. centred on not around or in. challenge Although duels and gauntlets have largely disappeared into 31\n\npart 1: the essence of style\n\nhistory, modern life seems to consist of little else but challenges. At every turn, every president, every minister, every government, every business, everyone everywhere is faced with challenges. No one nowadays has to face a change, difficulty, task or job. Rather these are challenges – fiscal challenges, organisational challenges, structural challenges, regional challenges, demographic challenges, etc. Next time you grab the word challenge, drop it at once and think again. charge If you charge intransitively, do so as a bull, cavalry officer or somesuch, not as an accuser (so avoid The standard of writing was abysmal, he charged). charts and tables should, ideally, be understandable without reading the accompanying text. The main point of the heading should therefore be to assist understanding, though if it does so amusingly, so much the better. If the subject of the chart (or table) is unambiguous (because, say, it is in the middle of a story about Germany), the title need not reflect the subject. In that case, however, the subtitle should clearly state: Number of occasions on which the word angst appears in German company reports, 2000-05. cherry-pick If you must use this cliché, note that to cherry-pick means to engage in careful rather than indiscriminate selection, whereas a cherry-picker is a machine for raising pickers (and cleaners and so on) off the ground. Chinese is a language. It may be either Mandarin or Cantonese. Chinese names see names. circumstances stand around a thing, so it is in, not under, them. civil society pops up a lot these days, often in the company of citizenship skills, community leaders, good governance, the international community, social capital and the like (“Development of civil society is social-reality specific” is a typical example). That should serve as a warning. It can, however, be a useful, albeit ill-defined term to describe collectively all non-commercial organisations between the family and the state. But do not use it as a euphemism for ngos (non-governmental organisations), which is how it is usually employed. 32\n\nclerical titles\n\n> clichés\n\nclerical titles see titles. clichés It would be quixotic to try to banish all clichés, and silly: a phrase often becomes a cliché precisely because it does its job rather well – at first. It is then copied so often and so unthinkingly that the reader wearies of it, and groans. In his “A Dictionary of Clichés” (1940), Eric Partridge wrote: “Clichés range from flyblown phrases (much of a muchness; to all intents and purposes), metaphors that are now pointless (lock, stock and barrel), formulas that have become mere counters (far be it from me to…) – through sobriquets that have lost all their freshness and most of their significance (the Iron Duke) – to quotations that are nauseating (cups that cheer but not inebriate), and foreign phrases that are tags (longo intervallo, bête noire).” In truth, many of yesterday’s clichés have become so much a part of the language that they pass unnoticed; they are like Orwell’s dead metaphors. The ones most to be avoided are the latest, the trendiest. Since they usually appeal to people who do not have the energy to pick their own words, they are often found in the wooden prose of bureaucrats, academics and businessmen, though journalese is far from immune. Can you speak the language of New Citizenship? asked an advertisement placed by the British Home Office recently. It had just set up a board to “advise on ways in which existing language and citizenship education resources and support services might be developed”, and was looking for a “Vice Chair and 13 Board members to help progress the challenging agenda that [lay] ahead”. The advertisement went on, not surprisingly, to mention overall strategic leadership, effective governance, a board fully focused on delivery, a record of significant achievement in the Academic, Education, Voluntary or Business Sectors, a keen interest in integration and community cohesion, those experienced in social cohesion and the need for strong interpersonal skills. A short article written by four European politicians for the International Herald Tribune (July 3rd 2004) was in much the same vein. It contained an ambitious strategy, reform process, send a message, momentum for structural economic reform back on track, important impulse, significant challenges, immediate and fundamental reforms, relocating operations, meet the competitiveness challenge proactively, focus of reform efforts, social cohesion and environmental sustainability, a number of key issues, innovative (twice), latest knowledge, excessively burdensome rules, knowledge 33\n\npart 1: the essence of style\n\ncreation, concrete measures, industry-science networks, key to this goal, proactive course of action, at the end of the day, and so on. Perceptively, the authors added, It is clear we have a lot of hard work to do. Difficult decisions will have to be made. (“Political language is designed to … give an appearance of solidity to pure wind.” Orwell) Clichés appear in lots of other contexts (see also horrible words, journalese and slang, metaphors). The following paragraphs may alert you to some of the commoner ones: “At this moment in time, with all due respect, let me take this window of opportunity to share with you a few clichés that some people may find particularly irritating. Basically, I would have to begin by kick-starting the economy, on a level playingfield, of course, and then, going forward, I would want to give 110% to the creation of a global footprint before cherry-picking the co-workers to empower the underprivileged, motivate the on-train team and craft an exciting public space, not forgetting that, if the infrastructure is not to find itself between a rock and a hard place, at the end of the day, we shall have to get networking and engage in some blue-sky thinking to push the envelope way beyond even our usual out-of-the-box metrics.” “You see, unless you have vision and passion you will never grow the company. You won’t even be able to trial your peers’ road maps. You can talk the talk, but can you walk the walk? Can you commit to those parameters? Good. But right now it’s time to draw a line in the sand and move on.” Nothing betrays the lazy writer faster than fly-blown phrases used in the belief that they are snappy, trendy or cool. bridges too far empires striking back kinder, gentler F-words flavours of the month Generation X hearts and minds\n\n$64,000 questions southern discomfort back to the future shaken, not stirred thirty-somethings windows of opportunity where’s the beef?\n\nThese are usually from a film or television, or perhaps a politician.

You may collapse, but you may not collapse something. colons see punctuation. 35\n\npart 1: the essence of style\n\ncome up with Try suggest, originate or produce. commas see punctuation. commit Do not commit to, but by all means commit yourself to something. community is a useful word in the context of religious or ethnic groups. But in many other others it jars. Not only is it often unnecessary, it also purports to convey a sense of togetherness that may well not exist: The black community means blacks. The business community means businessmen (who are supposed to be competing, not colluding). The homosexual community means homosexuals or gays. The intelligence community means spies. The online community means geeks and nerds. The migration and development communities means ngos. The international community, if it means anything, means other countries, aid agencies or, just occasionally, the family of nations. What the global community (Financial Times, July 12th 2005) means is a mystery. Community is a word that crops up in the company of the meaningless jargon and vacuous expressions beloved of bombastic bureaucrats. Here is John Negroponte, appearing before the American Senate: “Teamwork will remain my north star as director of national intelligence – not just for my immediate office but for the entire intelligence community. My objective will be to foster proactive cooperation … The Office of Director of National Intelligence should be a catalyst for focusing on the hardest, most important questions … Some argue that there are three intelligence communities … a military intelligence community … a foreign intelligence community … and a domestic intelligence community …” company names Call companies by the names they call themselves.

ZenithOptimedia\n\ncomparatives Take care. One thing may be many times more expensive than another. It cannot be many times cheaper (The Economist, August 9th 2003). Indeed, it can be cheaper only by proportion that is less than one. A different but similar mistake is to say that Zimbabweans have grown twice as poor under his stewardship (The Economist, April 9th 2005). Instead, say Zimbabweans’ incomes have fallen by half under his stewardship (if that is what you mean, which, since it confuses income with wealth, it may not be). compare A is compared with B when you draw attention to the difference. A is compared to B only when you want to stress their similarity. Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day? compound the verb, does not mean make worse. It may mean 37\n\npart 1: the essence of style\n\ncombine or, intransitively, it may mean to agree or come to terms. To compound a felony means to agree for a consideration not to prosecute. (It is also used, with different senses, as a noun and adjective.) comprise means is composed of. The Democratic coalition comprises women, workers, blacks and Jews. Women make up (not comprise) three-fifths of the Democratic coalition. Alternatively, Three-fifths of the Democratic coalition is composed of women. confectionary is a sweet; confectionery is sweets in general. contemporary see current. continuous describes something uninterrupted. Continual admits of a break. If your neighbours play loud music every night, it is a continual nuisance; it is not a continuous one unless the music is never turned off. contract see subcontract. contrast, by or in see by contrast, in contrast. convince Don’t convince people to do something. In that context the word you want is persuade. The prime minister was persuaded to call a June election; he was convinced of the wisdom of doing so only after he had won. coruscate means sparkle or throw off flashes of light, not wither, devastate or reduce to wrinkles (that’s corrugate). could is sometimes useful as a variant of might: His coalition could (or might) collapse. But take care. Does He could call an election in May mean He might call an election in May or He would be allowed to call an election in May? countries and their inhabitants In most contexts favour simplicity over precision and use Britain rather than Great Britain or the United Kingdom, and America rather than the United States. (“In all pointed sentences, some degree of accuracy must be sacrificed to conciseness.” Dr Johnson.) Sometimes, however, it may be important to be precise. Remember therefore that Great Britain consists of England, Scotland 38\n\ncountries and their inhabitants\n\nand Wales, which together with Northern Ireland (which we generally call Ulster, though Ulster strictly includes three counties in Ireland) make up the United Kingdom. Holland, though a nice, short, familiar name, is strictly only two of the 11 provinces that make up the Netherlands, and the Dutch do not like the misuse of the shorter name. So use the Netherlands. Ireland is simply Ireland. Although it is a republic, it is not the Republic of Ireland. Neither is it, in English, Eire. Americans: Remember too that, although it is usually all right to talk about the inhabitants of the United States as Americans, the term also applies to everyone from Canada to Cape Horn. In a context where other North, Central or South American countries are mentioned, you should write United States rather than America or American, and it may even be necessary to write United States citizens. USA and US are not to be used (if they were they would spatter the paper), except in charts and as part of an official name (eg, US Steel). Do not use the names of capital cities as synonyms for their governments. Britain will send a gunboat is fine, but London will send a gunboat suggests that this will be the action of the people of London alone. To write Washington and Moscow now differ only in their approach to Havana is absurd. EU should not be used without first spelling out the European Union. Europe and Europeans may sometimes be used as shorthand for citizens of countries of the European Union, but be careful: there are plenty of other Europeans too. Scandinavia is primarily Norway and Sweden, but the term is often used to include Denmark, Iceland, Norway and Sweden, which, with Finland, make up the Nordic countries. Madagascar: Malagasy is its adjective and the name of the inhabitants. Note that a country is it, not she. changes of name Where countries have made it clear that they wish to be called by a new (or an old) name, respect their requests. Thus: Burkina Faso Côte d’Ivoire Myanmar Sri Lanka Thailand Zimbabwe Zaire has now reverted to Congo. In contexts where 39\n\npart 1: the essence of style\n\nthere can be no confusion with the ex-French country of the same name, plain Congo will do. But if there is a risk of misunderstanding, call it the Democratic Republic of Congo (never drc). The other Congo can be Congo-Brazzaville if necssary. The river is now also the Congo. The people of either country are also Congolese. Former Soviet republics that are now independent countries include: Belarus (not Belorus or Belorussia), Belarusian (adjective) Kazakhstan Moldova (not Moldavia) Tajikistan Turkmenistan (see Turk, Turkic, Turkmen, Turkoman below) Kyrgyzstan is the name of the country. Its adjective is Kyrgyzstani, which is also the name of one of its inhabitants. But Kirgiz is the noun and adjective of the language, and the adjective of Kirgiz people outside Kyrgyzstan. (See also names.) Follow local practice when a country changes the names of rivers, towns, etc, within it. Thus: Almaty not Alma Ata Chemnitz not Karl-Marx-Stadt Chennai not Madras Chernihiv not Chernigov Chur not Coire Kyiv not Kiev Kolkata not Calcutta Lviv not Lvov Mumbai not Bombay Nizhny Novgorod not Gorky Papua not Irian Jaya Polokwane not Pietersburg Yangon not Rangoon St Petersburg not Leningrad Tshwane is the new name for the area round Pretoria but not yet for the city itself. (See also placenames.) Turk, Turkic, Turkmen, Turkoman, etc Turk, Turkish: noun and adjective of Turkey. Turkoman, Turkomans: member, members, of a branch 40\n\ncountries and their inhabitants\n\nof the Turkish race mostly living in the region east of the Caspian sea once known as Turkestan and parts of Iran and Afghanistan; Turkoman may also be the language of the Turkmen – and an adjective. Turkic: adjective applied to one of the branches of the Ural-Altaic family of languages – Uighur, Kazan Tatar, Kirgiz. Turkmen: Turkoman or Turkomans living in Turkmenistan; adjective pertaining to them. Turkmenistani: adjective of Turkmenistan; also a native of that country. crescendo Not an acme, apogee, peak, summit or zenith but a passage of increasing loudness. You cannot therefore build to a crescendo. crisis A decisive event or turning-point. Many of the economic and political troubles wrongly described as crises are really persistent difficulties, sagas or affairs. critique is a noun. If you want a verb, try criticise. currencies Use $ as the standard currency and, on first mention of sums in all other currencies except euros, give a dollar conversion in brackets. Apart from those currencies that are written out in full (see below), write the abbreviation followed by the number. Britain pound, abbreviated as £ pence, abbreviated as p 1p, 2p, 3p, etc to 99p (not £0.99) £6 (not £6.00), £6.47 £5,000-6,000 (not £5,000-£6,000) £5m-6m (not £5m-£6m) £5 billion-6 billion (not £5-6 billion), £5.2 billion-6.2 billion America dollar, abbreviated as $, will do generally; US$ if there is a mixture of dollar currencies (see below) cents, abbreviated as c; but spell out, unless part of a larger number: $4.99\n\n41\n\npart 1: the essence of style\n\nother dollar currencies A$ Australian dollars C$ Canadian dollars HK$ Hong Kong dollars M$ Malaysian dollars\n\nNT$ Taiwanese dollars NZ$ New Zealand dollars S$ Singaporean dollars\n\nEurope euro, plural euros, abbreviated as €, for those countries that have adopted it cents, abbreviated as c: spell out, unless part of a larger number Write the abbreviation followed by the figure: €100 (not 100 euros). DM, BFr, drachmas, FFr, Italian lire, IR£ (punts), markkas, Asch, Ptas and other currencies of the euro area have all been replaced by €, but may turn up in historical references. DKr Danish krone (plural kroner) NKr Norwegian krone (kroner) SFr Swiss franc, SFr1m (not 1m Swiss francs) SKr Swedish krona (plural kronor) sums in all other currencies are written in full, with the number first. Brazil, real China, yuan India, rupee Nigeria, naira peso currencies South Africa, rand Turkey, Turkish lira But Japan, yen\n\n100m reais (see below) 100m yuan (not renminbi) (see below) 100m rupees 100m naira 100m pesos 100m rand (not rands) 100m liras ¥, ¥1,000 (not 1,000 yen)\n\nBrazil Because of the risk of confusion with its English homonym, the real (plural reais) – but no other currency – is italicised in all text. China Properly, Chinese sums are expressed as, eg, 1 yuan rmb, meaning 1 yuan renminbi. Yuan, which means money, is the Chinese unit of currency. Renminbi, which means the people’s currency, is the description of the yuan, as sterling is the description of the pound. Use yuan. See also figures; and currencies and measures in Part 3. 42\n\ncurrent, contemporary\n\n> cyber-expressions\n\ncurrent, contemporary Current and contemporary mean at that time, not necessarily at this time. So a series of current prices from 1960 to 1970 will not be in today’s prices, just as contemporary art in 1800 was not modern art. Contemporary history is a contradiction in terms. cusp is a pointed end or a horn of, for example, the moon, or the point at which two branches of a curve meet. So it is odd to write, say, “Japan is on the cusp of a recovery” unless you think that recovery is about to end. cyber-expressions Most cyber-terms are lower case: cyber-attack, cyber-soccer, etc, but cybernetics, cyberspace and cyberwars.\n\n43\n\nd dashes see punctuation. dates month, day, year, in that order, with no commas: July 5th Monday July 5th July 5th 2005 July 27th-August 3rd 2005 July 2002\n\n1996-99 2002-05 1998-2003 1990s\n\nDo not write on June 10th-14th; prefer between June 10th and 14th. If, say, ministers are to meet over two days, write on December 14th and 15th. Do not burden the reader with dates of no significance, but give a date rather than just last week, which can cause confusion. This week and next week are permissible. Dates are often crucial to an account of events, but sentences (and, even more, articles) that begin with a date can be clumsy and off-putting. This week Congress is due to consider the matter is often better put as Congress is due to consider the matter this week. The effect is even more numbing if a comma is inserted: This week, Congress is due to consider the matter, though this construction is sometimes merited when emphasis is needed on the date. deal (verb) Transitively, deal means distribute: “He was dealt two aces, two kings and a six.” Intransitively, deal means engage in business. Do not deal drugs, horses, weapons, etc; deal in them. decimate means to destroy a proportion (originally a tenth) of a group of people or things, not to destroy them all or nearly all. demographics No, the word is demography. deprecate, depreciate To deprecate is to argue or plead against (by prayer or otherwise). To depreciate is to lower in value.\n\n44\n\ndifferent from\n\n> Dutch names\n\ndifferent from not to or than. dilemma Not just any old awkwardness but one with horns, being, properly, a form of argument (the horned syllogism) in which you find yourself committed to accept one of two propositions each of which contradicts your original contention. Thus a dilemma offers the choice between two alternatives, each with equally nasty consequences. discreet, discrete Discreet means circumspect or prudent. Discrete means separate or distinct. Remember that “Questions are never indiscreet. Answers sometimes are.” (Oscar Wilde) disinterested means impartial; uninterested means bored. “Disinterested curiosity is the lifeblood of civilisation.” (G.M. Trevelyan) Dominicans Take care. Do they come from Dominica? Or the Dominican Republic? Or are they friars? down to earth yes, but Occasional court victories are not down to human rights (The Economist). No: down to does not mean attributable to, the responsibility of or even up to (It’s up to you). due process is a technical term, or piece of jargon, which was first used in England in 1355. It comes in two forms, substantive due process, which relates to the duties of governments to act rationally and proportionally when doing anything that affects citizens’ rights, and procedural due process, which relates to the need for fair procedures. If you use the expression, make sure it is clear what you mean by it. due to when used to mean caused by must follow a noun, as in The cancellation, due to rain, of ... Do not write It was cancelled due to rain. If you mean because of and for some reason are reluctant to say it, you probably want owing to. It was cancelled owing to rain is all right. Dutch names see names.\n\n45\n\ne earnings Do not write earnings when you mean profits (try to say if they are operating, gross, pre-tax or net). -ee employees, evacuees, detainees, divorcee, referees, refugees but, please, no attendees (those attending), draftees (conscripts), enrollees (participants), escapees (escapers), indictees (the indicted), retirees (the retired), or standees. A divorcee may be male or female. e-expressions Except at the start of a sentence, the e- is lower case and hyphenated: e-business e-commerce e-mail When giving websites, do not include http://. Just www is enough: www.economist.com Computer terms are also usually lower case: dotcom home-page laptop online the net (and internet) the web, website and world wide web See also cyber-expressions. effect the verb, means to accomplish, so The novel effected a change in his attitude. See also affect. -effective, -efficient Cost-effective sounds authoritative, but does it mean good value for money, gives a big bang for the buck or just plain cheap? If cheap, say cheap. Energy-efficient is also dubious. Does it mean thrifty, economical or something else? Efficiency is the ratio of energy put out to energy put in.\n\n46\n\neffectively, in effect\n\n> eponymous\n\neffectively, in effect Effectively means with effect; if you mean in effect, say it. The matter was effectively dealt with on Friday means it was done well on Friday. The matter was, in effect, dealt with on Friday means it was more or less attended to on Friday. Effectively leaderless would do as a description of the demonstrators in East Germany in 1989 but not those in Tiananmen Square, also in 1989. The devaluation of the Slovak currency in 1993, described by some as an effective 8%, turned out to be a rather ineffective 8%. either … or see none. elections see grammar and syntax. enclave, exclave An enclave is a piece of territory or territorial water entirely surrounded by foreign territory (Ceuta, Kaliningrad, Melilla, Nagorno-Karabakh, Nakhichevan). An exclave is the same thing, viewed differently, if, and only if, it belongs to another country (so Andorra and San Marino are not exclaves). enormity means a crime, sin or monstrous wickedness. It does not mean immensity. environment is often unavoidable, but it’s not a pretty word. Avoid the business environment, the school environment, the work environment, etc. Try to rephrase the sentence – conditions for business, at school, at work, etc. Surroundings can sometimes do the job. epicentre means that point on the earth’s surface above the centre of an earthquake. To say that Mr Putin was at the epicentre of the dispute suggests that the argument took place underground. The hypocentre, incidentally, is the place on the surface of the earth below an explosion (which at Hiroshima in 1945, for example, was 580 metres above the ground). It is the same as ground zero. eponymous is the adjective of eponym, which is the person or thing after which something is named. So George Canning was the eponymous hero of the Canning Club, Hellen was the eponymous ancestor of the Hellenes (Greeks), Ninus was the eponymous founder of Nineveh. Do not say John Sainsbury, the founder of the eponymous supermarket. Rather he was the eponymous founder of J. Sainsbury’s. 47\n\npart 1: the essence of style\n\nethnic groups Your first concern should be to avoid giving offence. But also avoid mealy-mouthed euphemisms and terms that have not generally caught on despite promotion by pressure-groups. Ethnic meaning concerning nations or races, or even something ill-defined in between, is a useful word. But do not be shy of race and racial. After several years in which race was seen as a purely social concept, not a scientific one, the term is coming back among scientists as a shorthand way of speaking about genetic rather than cultural or political differences. See also political correctness. Anglo-Saxon is not a synonym for English-speaking. Neither the United States nor Australia is an Anglo-Saxon country; nor is Britain. Anglo-Saxon capitalism does not exist. Asians In Britain, but nowhere else, Asians is often used to mean immigrants and their descendants from the Indian subcontinent. Many such people are coming to dislike the term, and many foreigners must assume it means people from all over Asia, so take care. Note that, even in the usage peculiar to Britain, Asian is not synonymous with Muslim. blacks In many countries, including the United States, many black people are happy to be called blacks, although some prefer to be African-Americans. Black is shorter and more straightforward, but use either. mixed race Do not call people who are neither pure white nor pure black browns. People of mixed race in South Africa are Coloureds. other groups The inhabitants of Azerbaijan are Azerbaijanis, some of whom, but not all, are Azeris. Those Azeris who live in other places, such as Iran, are not Azerbaijanis. Similarly, many Croats are not Croatian, many Serbs not Serbian, many Uzbeks not Uzbekistanis, etc. Spanish-speakers in the US When writing about Spanishspeaking people in the United States, use either Latino or Hispanic as a general term, but try to be specific (eg, MexicanAmerican). Many Latin Americans (eg, those from Brazil) are not Hispanic.\n\n48\n\neuphemisms\n\n> execute\n\neuphemisms Avoid, where possible, euphemisms and circumlocutions, especially those promoted by interest-groups keen to please their clients or organisations anxious to avoid embarrassment. This does not mean that good writers should be insensitive of giving offence: on the contrary, if you are to be persuasive, you would do well to be courteous. But a good writer owes something to plain speech, the English language and the truth, as well as to manners. Political correctness can be carried too far. So, in most contexts, offending behaviour is probably criminal behaviour. Female teenagers are girls, not women. Living with mobility impairment probably means wheelchair-bound. Developing countries are often stagnating or even regressing (try poor) countries. The underprivileged may be disadvantaged, but are more likely just poor (the very concept of underprivilege is absurd, since it implies that some people receive less than their fair share of something that is by definition an advantage or prerogative). Enron’s document-management policy simply meant shredding. The Pentagon’s practice of enhanced interrogation is torture, just as its practice of rendition is probably torture contracted out to foreigners. France’s proposed solidarity contribution on airline tickets is a tax. The British solicitor-general’s evidential deficiency is no evidence, and George Bush’s reputational problem just means he is mistrusted. It is sometimes useful to talk of human-rights abuses but often the sentence can be rephrased more pithily and accurately. The army is accused of committing numerous humanrights abuses probably means The army is accused of torture and murder. Decommissioning weapons means disarming. Being economical with the truth famously means lying. A high net-worth individual is a rich man or rich woman. Zero-percent financing means an interest-free loan. See also affirmative action. Euro-terms see capitals. ex- (and former) Be careful. A Labour Party ex-member has lost his seat; an ex-Labour member has lost his party. execute means put to death by law. Do not use it as a synonym for murder. An extra-judicial execution is a contradiction in terms.\n\n49\n\nf fact The fact that can often be reduced to that. factoid A factoid is something that sounds like a fact, is thought by many to be a fact (perhaps because it is repeated so often), but is not in fact a fact. federalist in Britain, someone who believes in centralising the powers of associated states; in the United States and Europe, someone who believes in decentralising them. fellow Often unnecessary, especially before countrymen (“Friends, Romans, fellow-countrymen”?). fewer than, less than Fewer (not less) than seven speeches, fewer than seven samurai. Use fewer, not less, with numbers of individual items or people. Less than £200, less than 700 tonnes of oil, less than a third, because these are measured quantities or proportions, not individual items. fief not fiefdom. figures Never start a sentence with a figure; write the number in words instead. Use words for simple numerals from one to ten inclusive, except: in references to pages; in percentages (eg, 4%); and in sets of numerals, some of which are higher than ten. Deaths from this cause in the past three years were 14, 9 and 6. Always use numbers with units of measurement, even for those less than ten: 4 metres, but four cows It is occasionally permissible to use words rather than numbers when referring to a rough or rhetorical figure (such as a\n\n50\n\nfigures\n\nthousand curses, a hundred years of solitude). In all other cases, though, use figures for numerals from 11 upwards. first to tenth centuries, the 11th century 20th century, 21st century 20th-century ideas in 100 years’ time\n\na 29-year-old man a man in his 20s 20th anniversary\n\nThe Thirty Years War is an exception. decimal point Use figures for all numerals that include a decimal point (eg, 4.25). fractions Figures may be appropriate for fractions, if the context is either technical or precise, or both: Though the poll’s figures were supposed to be accurate to within 1%, his lead of 41/4 points turned out on election day to be minus 31/2. Where precision is less important but it is nonetheless impossible to shoot off the fraction, words may look better: Though the beast was sold as two-year-old, it turned out to be two-and-a-half times that. Fractions should be hyphenated (one-half, three-quarters, etc) and, unless they are attached to whole numbers (81/2, 293/4), spelled out in words, even when the figures are higher than ten: He gave a tenth of his salary to the church, a twentieth to his mistress and a thirtieth to his wife. fractions and decimals Do not compare a fraction with a decimal. So avoid: The rate fell from 31/4% to 3.1%. Fractions are more precise than decimals (3.33 neglects an infinity of figures that are embraced by 1/3), but your readers probably do not think so. You should therefore use fractions for rough figures: Kenya’s population is growing at 31/2% a year, A hectare is 21/2 acres 51\n\npart 1: the essence of style\n\nand decimals for more exact ones: The retail price index is rising at an annual rate of 10.6%. But treat all numbers with respect. That usually means resisting the precision of more than one decimal place, and generally favouring rounding off. Beware of phoney overprecision. hyphens and figures Do not use a hyphen in place of to except with figures: He received a sentence of 15-20 years in jail but He promised to have escaped within three to four weeks. Latin usage It is outdated to use Latin words. So, with figures, do not write per caput, per capita or per annum. Use: a head or per head a person or per person a year or per year 2 litres of water per person prices rose by 10% a year See also per caput. measurements Since Britain has gone over to the metric system, in most non-American contexts prefer: hectares to acres kilometres (or km) to miles metres to yards litres to gallons kilos (kg) to lb tonnes to tons Celsius to Fahrenheit, etc k, m and M are standard international metric abbreviations for thousand, thousandth and million. 1\n\n52\n\nIn American contexts, you may use the measurements more familiar to Americans (though remember that American pints, quarts, gallons, etc, are smaller than imperial ones). Regardless of which you choose, you should give an equivalent, on first use, in the other units:\n\nfigures\n\nIt was hoped that after improvements to the engine the car would give 20km to the litre (47 miles per American gallon), compared with its present average of 15km per litre. 2\n\nPetrol Remember that in only a few countries do you now buy petrol in imperial gallons. In America it is sold in American gallons; in most other places it is sold in litres.\n\n3\n\nNote that a four-by-four vehicle can be a 4×4.\n\nmillion, billion, trillion, quadrillion Use m for million. Spell out billion and trillion (though their conventional abbreviations are bn and trn). 8m £8m\n\n8 billion €8 billion\n\nA billion is a thousand million, a trillion a thousand billion. (A quadrillion is a thousand trillion.) per cent, percentage points Use the sign % instead of per cent. But write percentage, never %age (though in most contexts proportion or share is preferable). A fall from 4% to 2% is a drop of two percentage points, or of 50%, but not of 2%. (See also per cent.) ranges Write: 5,000-6,000 5-6% 5m-6m (not 5-6m) 5 billion-6 billion But: Sales rose from 5m to 6m (not 5m-6m); estimates ranged between 5m and 6m (not 5m-6m). ratios Where to is being used as part of a ratio, it is usually best to spell it out. They decided, by nine votes to two, to put the matter to the general assembly which voted, 27 to 19, to insist that the ratio of vodka to tomato juice in a bloody mary should be at least one to three, though the odds of this being so in most bars were put at no better than 11 to 4. 53\n\npart 1: the essence of style\n\nWhere a ratio is being used adjectivally, figures and hyphens may be used, but only if one of the figures is greater than ten: a 50-20 vote a 19-9 vote Otherwise, spell out the figures and use to: a two-to-one vote a ten-to-one probability finally Do not use finally when you mean at last. Richard Burton finally marries Liz Taylor would have been all right second time round but not first. firm Accountants’, consultants’, lawyers’ and other partnerships are firms, not companies. Huge enterprises, like ge, gm, Ford, Microsoft and so on, should, by contrast, normally be called companies, although such outfits can sometimes be called firms for variety. flaunt, flout Flaunt means display; flout means disdain. If you flout this distinction, you will flaunt your ignorance. focus can be a useful word. It is shorter than concentrate and sharper than look at. But it is overused (see page 35). footnotes, sources, references see footnotes, sources, references in Part 3. foreign languages and translation Occasionally, a foreign language may provide the mot juste. But try not to use foreign words and phrases unless there is no English alternative, which is unusual. So: a year or per year, not per annum a person or per person, not per caput or per capita beyond one’s authority, not ultra vires (See also italics.) names of foreign companies, institutions, groups, parties, etc Do not translate, or italicise, the name of a foreign company, institution or organisation even if it is, or includes, an ordinary word with an English equivalent. So:\n\n54\n\nforeign languages and translation\n\nForza Italia Médecins Sans Frontières the Parti Québécois in Canada yakuza (not 8-9-3) Note that if an abbreviation is also given, that may be the initials of the foreign name:\n\nUMP for France’s Union for a Presidential Majority SPD for the Social Democratic Party of Germany PAN for Mexico’s National Action Party But some should be translated: Italy’s Olive Tree (not Ulivo) the German Christian Democratic Union (not the Christlich Demokratische Union) the Shining Path (not Sendero Luminoso) the National Assembly (not the Assemblée Nationale) placenames Some placenames are better translated if they are well known in English: St Mark’s Square in Venice (not Piazza San Marco) the French Elysée Palace (not the Palais de l’Elysée) titles of foreign books, films, etc The titles of foreign books, films, plays, operas and TV programmes present difficulties. Some are so well known that they are unlikely to need translation: “Das Kapital” “Mein Kampf” “Le Petit Prince” “Die Fledermaus” And sometimes the meaning of the title may be unimportant in the context, so a translation is not necessary: “Hiroshima, Mon Amour” But often the title will be significant, and you will want to translate it. One solution, easy with classics, is simply to give the English translation: “One Hundred Years of Solitude” “The Leopard” “War and Peace” “The Tin Drum” This is usually the best practice to follow with pamphlets, articles and non-fiction, too.\n\n55\n\npart 1: the essence of style\n\nBut sometimes, especially with books and films that are little known among English-speakers or unobtainable in English (perhaps you are reviewing one), you may want to give both the original title and a translation, thus: “11 Septembre 2001: l’Effroyable Imposture” (“September 11th 2001: the Appalling Deception”) “La Régle du Jeu” (“The Rules of the Game”) “La Traviata” (“The Sinner”) Such titles do not follow the rule of italicising for foreign words. Treat them as if they were in English. Note that book publishers follow different rules here. (See italics.) translating words and phrases If you want to translate a foreign word or phrase, even if it is the name of a group or newspaper or party, just put it in brackets without inverted commas, so: Arbeit macht frei (work makes free) jihad (struggle) Médecins Sans Frontières (Doctors Without Borders) Pravda (Truth) zapatero (shoemaker) forensic means pertaining to courts of law (held by the Romans in the forum) or, more loosely, the application of science to legal issues. Forensic medicine is medical jurisprudence. forgo, forego Forgo means do without; it forgoes the e. Forego means go before. A foregone conclusion is one that is predetermined; a forgone conclusion is non-existent. former see ex-. former and latter Avoid the use of the former and the latter whenever possible. It usually causes confusion. Frankenstein was not the monster, but its creator. free is an adjective or an adverb (and also a transitive verb), so you cannot have or do anything for free. Either you have it free or you have it for nothing.\n\n56\n\nFrench names\n\n> fund\n\nFrench names see names. fresh is not a synonym for new or more. A few hundred fresh bodies are being recovered every day, reported The Economist improbably, two months after a tsunami had struck. Use with care. full stops see punctuation. fulsome is an old word that Americans generally use only to mean cloying, insincere or excessively flattering. In British English it can also mean copious, abundant or lavish. fund (verb) is a technical term, meaning to convert floating debt into more or less permanent debt at fixed interest. Try to avoid it if you mean to finance or to pay for.\n\n57\n\ng garner means store, not gather. gearing is an ugly word which, if used, needs to be explained. It may be either the ratio of debt to equity or the ratio of debt to total capital employed. (See also leverage.) gender is nowadays used in several ways. One is common in feminist writing, where the term has a technical meaning. “One is not born a woman, one becomes one,” argued Simone de Beauvoir: in other words, one chooses one’s gender. In such a context it would be absurd to use the word sex; the term must be gender. But, in using it thus, try to explain what you mean by it. Even feminists do not agree on a definition. The primary use of gender, though, is in grammar, where it is applied to words, not people. If someone is female, that is her sex, not her gender. (The gender of Mädchen, the German word for girl, is neuter, as is Weib, a wife or woman.) So do not use gender as a synonym for sex. Gender studies probably means feminism. generation Take care. You can be a second-generation Frenchman, but if you are a second-generation immigrant it means you have left the country your parents came to. gentlemen’s agreement not gentleman’s. German names see names. get is an adaptable verb, but it has its limits. A man does not get sacked or promoted, he is sacked or promoted. Nor does a prizewinner get to shake hands with the president, or spend the money all at once; he gets the chance to, is able to, or allowed to. global Globalisation can go to the head. It is not necessary to describe, eg, the head of Baker & Mackenzie as the global head of that firm.\n\n58\n\nglobal\n\n> grammar and syntax\n\nAnd what is a global vacancy (as advertised by The Economist Group)? good in parts is what the curate said about an egg that was wholly bad. He was trying to be polite. gourmet, gourmand Gourmet means epicure; gourmand means greedy-guts. governance Corporate governance has now entered the language as a useful, albeit ugly and ill-defined, term to describe the rules relating to the conduct of business. The popularity of governance in other contexts is more difficult to understand. An old word, it had largely fallen into suitable disuse until Harold Wilson chose it in 1976 for the title of his memoirs (“The Governance of Britain”), presumably to dignify an undistinguished prime ministership. It means simply government, a word that serves the same purpose without any of the pretensions or pomposity of governance. grammar and syntax Try not to be sloppy in the construction of your sentences and paragraphs. A single issue of The Economist contained the following: When closed at night, the fear is that this would shut off rather than open up part of the city centre. Unlike Canary Wharf, the public will be able to go to the top to look out over the city. Only a couple of months ago, after an unbroken string of successes in state and local elections, pollsters said ... Some hints are provided here on avoiding pitfalls, infelicities and mistakes; this is not a comprehensive guide to English grammar and syntax. a or the Remember that Barclays is a British bank, not the British bank, just as Ford is a car company, not the car company, and Luciano Pavarotti is an opera singer, not the opera singer. If it seems absurd to describe someone or something thus – that is, with the indefinite article – you can probably dispense with the description altogether or insert an extra word or two that may be useful to the reader: Ford, America’s second-biggest car company. adjectives and adverbs Adjectives qualify nouns, adverbs modify 59\n\npart 1: the essence of style\n\nverbs. If you have a sentence that contains the words firstly, secondly, more importantly, etc, they almost certainly ought to be first, second, more important. adjectives of proper nouns If proper nouns have adjectives, use them. Crimean war (not the Crimea war) Dutch East India Company (not the Holland East India Company) Lebanese (not Lebanon) civil war Mexican (not Mexico) problem Pakistani (not Pakistan) government Scottish Office (not the Scotland Office) It is permissible to use the noun as an adjective if to do otherwise would cause confusion. An African initiative suggests the proposal came from Africa, whereas an Africa initiative suggests it was about Africa. Californian, Texan Do not feel you have to follow American convention in using words like Californian and Texan only as nouns. In British English, it is quite acceptable to write a Californian (not California) judge, Texan (not Texas) scandal, etc. “Mr Gedge … was not fond of St Rocque, and this morning it would have seemed less attractive to him than ever, for three of his letters bore Californian postmarks and their contents had aggravated the fever of his home-sickness.” (P.G. Wodehouse, “Hot Water”) “The local avant-garde was in one of its ‘painting is dead’ phases, and was automatically dismissive of things Californian anyway.” (Peter Schjeldahl, The New Yorker, May 9th 2005) collective nouns – singular or plural? There is no firm rule about the number of a verb governed by a singular collective noun. It is best to go by the sense – that is, whether the collective noun stands for a single entity: The council was elected in March. The me generation has run its course. The staff is loyal. 60\n\ngrammar and syntax\n\nor for its constituents: The council are at sixes and sevens. The preceding generation are all dead. The staff are at each other’s throats). Do not, in any event, slavishly give all singular collective nouns singular verbs: The couple are now living apart is preferable to The couple is now living apart. pair and couple Treat both a pair and a couple as plural. majority When it is used in an abstract sense, it takes the singular; when it is used to denote the elements making up the majority, it should be plural. A two-thirds majority is needed to amend the constitution but A majority of the Senate were opposed. number Rule: The number is …; A number are … comparisons Take care, too, when making comparisons, to compare like with like: The Belgian economy is bigger than Russia should be Belgium’s economy is bigger than Russia’s. An advertisement for The Economist recently declared, Our style and our whole philosophy are different from other publications. contractions Don’t overdo the use of don’t, isn’t, can’t, won’t, etc. false possessive Avoid the false possessive: London’s Heathrow Airport. genitive Take care with the genitive. It is fine to say a friend of Bill’s, just as you would say a friend of mine, so you can also say a friend of Bill’s and Carol’s. But it is also fine to say a friend of Bill, or a friend of Bill and Carol. What you must not say is Bill and Carol’s friend. If you wish to use that construction, you must say Bill’s and Carol’s friend, which is cumbersome.\n\n61\n\npart 1: the essence of style\n\ngerunds Respect the gerund. Gerunds look like participles – running, jumping, standing – but are more noun-like, and should never therefore be preceded by a personal pronoun. So the following are wrong: I was awoken by him snoring, He could not prevent them drowning, Please forgive me coming late. Those sentences should have ended: his snoring, their drowning, my coming late. In other words, use the possessive adjective rather than the personal pronoun"
