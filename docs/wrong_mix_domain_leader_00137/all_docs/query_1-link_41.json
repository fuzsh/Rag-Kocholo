        "text": "Briefing No 13\n\nSlovakia and the enlargement of the European Union\n\nThe views expressed in this document are not necessarily those held by the European Parliament as an institution.\n\nII. POLITICAL SITUATION\n\na) Recent history\n\nThe present state of Slovakia came into existence on 1 January 1993, following the break-up of the Czech and Slovak Federal Republic. Slovakia had long been part of the Hungarian empire, and then, after the first world war, became part of the new state of Czechoslovakia. Following the Munich agreement in 1938, Czechoslovakia was partitioned, with a separate Slovak state, led by the Catholic monsignor Jozef Tiso, established by Nazi diktat. The Czechoslovakian state was restored after the war in 1945, although the eastern province of sub-Carpathian Ruthenia was ceded to the Soviet Union.\n\nAfter the war, the Communist Party was able gradually to take over power, with a communist regime being set up in February 1948. The communists enjoyed much less popular support in Slovakia than in the Czech Lands, forcing Slovak communists, who had favoured an independent \"socialist\" Slovakia following the 1944 national uprising against the Tiso regime, to support a unitary Czechoslovak state. In return, Slovakia benefited from policies intended to draw the two nations together through economic convergence. Large subsidies were given to Slovakia, and heavy industry, including most of the armaments factories, were located there.\n\nDiscontent with the unitary state continued however, and after the fall of the communist regime in the \"Velvet Revolution\" of 1989, tensions between Czech and Slovak politicians rose to the surface. A broad devolution of power was agreed at the end of 1990. However, by the spring of 1991, political fragmentation was jeopardising the transition to a unified Western-style market economy. The most popular Slovak politician Vladimir Meciar set up the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS), which pressed for even greater Slovak autonomy, to be based on a declaration of sovereignty, after which a loose confederal state could be negotiated.\n\nThis call for sovereignty, in particular the advocacy of a separate economic strategy for Slovakia found a receptive audience amid growing dissatisfaction with the uncompromising laissez-faire policies followed at a federal level. Unemployment in Slovakia was three times higher than in the Czech Lands by mid-1991, and the HZDS's combined appeal to nationalist sentiment, fear of rapid change among industrial workers and enterprise managers and a more socially oriented reform path proved attractive. After the election of 1992, the new Slovak government was formed entirely by the HZDS (except one minister). With many small parties unable to win representation because of the 5% threshhold, the HZDS won 74 seats out of 150 with just 37.2% of the vote.\n\nWhile avoiding separatist rhetoric, Mr Meciar stood firm in his insistence on a Slovak declaration of sovereignty. Even though opinion polls indicated that the overwhelming majority in Slovakia favoured maintaining a common state with the Czechs, it became increasingly difficult to reconcile this with Mr Meciar's insistence on a declaration of Slovak sovereignty. As a result, Vaclav Klaus, the Czech Prime Minister, pushed him to agree a timetable for separation. The plan to hold a referendum was abandoned, when it became clear that there was a clear majority in favour of maintaining the common state. However, the separation came into effect on 1 January 1993.\n\nAfter independence, Mr Meciar started to concentrate power in the hands of his staunchest loyalists. Press freedoms were compromised, economic reform slowed, and relations with Slovakia's neighbours and the west deteriorated. The increasingly authoritarian tendencies in the government led to HZDS members of the parliament leaving the party. This undermined Mr Meciar's position, and he was forced to seek support from the far-right Slovak National Party, which itself was split. After a few uneasy months of coalition, the government lost a vote of no confidence and fell, and was defeated at the election that followed\n\nA new government was formed by a broad coalition of five parties, led by Jozef Moravcik, who had been foreign minister under Mr Meciar before joining the opposition in early 1994. The cabinet, with tacit support from a coalition of three ethnic Hungarian parties, included the centre- right Christian Democratic Movement (KDH), the centre-left Party of the Democratic Left (SDL, the former Communist Party) and three parties created by Mr Meciar's former allies. After a promising start, the government called early parliamentary elections in September 1994, in the hope of gaining a firm mandate.\n\nHowever, the government parties remained too distinct in both ideology and organisation for an effective campaign to be waged, and they lacked an appealing leader to present their programme clearly. Mr Meciar, on the other hand, portrayed the government as \"anti-Slovak\", and his populist appeal continued to resonate with workers, the elderly and rural voters. As a result, the HZDS won 35% of the total vote, three times as much as any of the other parties. It formed a government with the Slovak National Party and the far-left Association of Slovak Workers. Mr Meciar maintained that EU and NATO accession were Slovakia's overriding aims, while rejecting racial and ethnic discrimination. However, the government's reputation abroad remained tarnished due to a variety of factors. These included the lack of firm support for western integration within the HZDS, the manipulation of the privatisation programme to benefit government sympathisers and the introduction of a language law, making Slovak the only legal language in official proceedings and much of daily public life. In addition, there was growing concern at the use of the Slovak Information Service in operations against opponents of Mr Meciar, and the ongoing public wrangling between Mr Meciar and the president, Michal Kovac. The style of government became increasingly populist, nationalist and authoritarian in nature, and some of its actions led commentators to wonder whether Mr Meciar had decided to subordinate his stated aim of western integration to strengthening his hold on power by non-democratic means. For example, in June 1997, in defiance of a decision by the constitutional court, Mr Meciar ordered the interior minister to remove an opposition-backed question on whether the president should be directly elected from a referendum ballot containing questions on NATO inclusion. This rendered the entire exercise invalid.\n\nThe political situation became increasingly fractious towards the end of the parliament. The electoral law was changed, and there were arguments about media coverage of the election campaign. In the end, however, Mr Meciar's coalition was defeated in the 1998 elections, and Mikulas Dzurinda became the new prime minister.\n\nb) Institutions\n\nThe Slovak National Parliament proclaimed Slovakia's sovereignty in July 1992. The Slovak constitution was adopted on 3 September 1992, and the Czechoslovak Federal Assembly gave the required three-fifths majority to a law terminating the federation on 25 November 1992. The new state of Slovakia officially came into existence on 1 January 1993. The constitution affirms a multiparty system, a free-market economy and respect for human rights. Legislative power is vested in a unicameral parliament, which was renamed the National Council of the Slovak Republic on independence. The parliament has 150 members, elected for a four-year term. The prime minister is appointed by the president.\n\nSlovakia is organised as a unitary national state. In July 1996, a new administrative structure was introduced, under which the country is divided into eight regions and 79 administrative regions. The establishment of the new structure was criticised by the opposition since it required an additional 20,000 state employees to run it, which it was feared could be a further source of patronage for Mr Meciar.\n\nThe most recent elections to the Slovak National Council took place on 25-26 September 1998. Turnout was very high at 84%, one of the highest figures for any election in central and eastern Europe since 1989. The result was a defeat for the outgoing prime minister, Vladimir Meciar. Although his HZDS party won the most seats, its showing was down 8% from the previous election, and its former coalition parties fared poorly. As a result, Mikulas Dzurinda, the leader of the Slovak Democratic Coalition (SDK), was eventually invited to form a government. After a not entirely smooth negotiation process, a four party coalition was agreed, encompassing the SDK, the Party of the Democratic Left (SDL), the Party of Civic Understanding (SOP) and the Hungarian Coalition Party (SMK). Together these parties have 93 of the 150 seats in the parliament, more than the three fifths majority needed to enact certain key measures, such as electing a president. One interesting feature of the result was the performance of the SOP, led by Rolf Schuster, the mayor of Kosice, the second largest city in Slovakia, with 19% of its total vote coming from that city and over 50% from the east of the country. SOP served as a vehicule for Schuster's successful bid for the Presidency in May 1999.\n\nThe results were as follows:\n\nPARTYSEATS 1994% VOTE 1998SEATS 1998 Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS)6127.0043 Slovak National Party (SNS)99.0714 Hungarian Coalition (SMK) a179.1215 Party of the Democratic Left (SDL) a-14.6623 Slovak Democratic Coalition (SDK) a-26.3342 Party of Civic Understanding (SOP) a-8.0113 Common Choice18-- Christian Democratic Movement (KDH)17-- Democratic Union (DU)15-- Association of Slovak Workers (ZRS)131.300 Others04.51- Total150100.0150\n\na Party in coalition government\n\nc) Recent Developments\n\ni) Party political fragmentation\n\nThe governing coalition remained in power despite a climate of instability characterised by a no-confidence motion tabled by the opposition, pressure for a referendum on early elections and calls for a cabinet re-shuffle. These pressures stem from the polarisation between government aand opposition as well as the fragile relations between the broad coalition of ruling parties.\n\nThe political scene continued to be dominated by party realignments following the creation of two new parties in 1999. Prime Minister Dzurinda pressed ahead with the formation of his new party, the Slovak Democratic Christian Union (SDKU) announced in February following his failure to turn the main centre-right SDK from a loose tactical five-party alliance into an effective and unified political force.( In 1996/97 Dzurinda had already tried unsucessfully to transform the Christian Democrat KDH into a broader-based 'people's party' ). Parliament voted a new law, initiated by the opposition and coalition parties SDL and SOP, which bans MPs from holding membership of more than one political party. This move is seen as directed primarily against Dzurinda's new party and which will further precipitate the demise of the SDK parliamentary faction.\n\nThe ruling coalition parties languished in the opinion polls as the government's 1999 austerity programme began to bite, although Dzurinda's new SDKU fluctuated between 10% and 13%, well above the figures for any of the SDK founding parties. One of the latter, the Democratic Union (DU), voted at its May council meeting to merge with the SDKU, a decision ratified at a party congress in August. However, some delegates boycotted the conference and a new party, the Liberal and Democratic Union of Slovakia is likely to be officially registered by liberal opponents of the merger in September.\n\nOn the left of the coalition, tensions in the Party of the Democratic Left (SDL) over the pace and scope of economic reform surfaced amid indications of declining popular support and accusations of lack of influence within the government, which led to demands for a new coalition agreement. The dismissal in March of Stefan Kosovan, an SDL nominee to the post of Director of the main state-owned power utility, Slovenske Elektrarne, following serious breaches of tender rules and other irregularities, exposed a potentially serious split between supporters of SDL chairman and Parliamentary Speaker, Josef Migas, and the party's pro-reform wing, whose representatives include the Defence, Finance and Education Ministers. In April Migas and four other SDL MPs supported an unsuccessful no-confidence motion against the Prime Minister and, although Migas defeated Education Minister Ftacnik's leadership bid at a special congress in July, observers do not rule out a further challenge at the October conference. The SDL is also still suffering from the creation last year of the centre-left Smer movement by its former Vice-chairman, Robert Fico, especially as the latter's support in opinion polls has been second only to Vladimir Meciar's opposition HZDS.\n\nOf the junior partners in the coalition, the SOP has been slow to evolve beyond its establishment in early 1998 as an organisational vehicle for Rudolph Schuster's presidential election campaign. Its leader, Deputy Prime Minister for European Integration, Pavol Hamzik, has had to deal with a leadership challenge over the party's low standing in the polls as well as the damage caused by corruption charges levelled at one of SOP's former members. Discontent in the Hungarian Coalition Party boiled over in August when its leader, Béla Bugár, threatened to leave the ruling coalition over the government's failure to reshape regional government. Hungarian demands for a separate administrative unit in an area with a major ethnic Hungarian population were rejected by the other coalition partners.\n\nThe opposition is still dominated by the HZDS, supported by the far-right Slovak National Party (SNS). As well as pressing for a referendum, HZDS leader Vladimir Meciar has recently attempted to improve the party's image and end its isolation, notably by renaming the party the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia-People's Party and affirming unequivocal support for membership of the EU and NATO. These moves have been dismissed by the other parties, although HZDS consistently tops the opinion polls, largely due to Mr Meciar's charismatic authority. However, any broader political reconciliation with HZDS seems unlikely while Meciar remains leader and, indeed, the government has been anxious to investigate and prosecute him in connection with serious abuses of power.\n\nii) Referendum on early elections\n\nThe opposition Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS), with the support of the Slovak National Party (SNS) kept up its pressure for a referendum and has now gathered more than the 350 000 valid signatures needed. However opposition and governing parties alike have no real interest in early elections and the move is seen more as a means of maintaining pressure on the embattled Prime Minister, Mr Dzurinda. The proposed referendum could result, if successful, in new elections being called within 150 days, although a turnout of 50% is necessary for a referendum to be valid and the result must be approved by three-fifths of parliament to take effect.. After verification of the petition and consultation of seven constitutional lawyers, President Schuster finally announced on 5 September that the referendum would take place on 11 November. Schuster said recently that he was certain that the 50% turnout would not be achieved and he warned that the return to power of Vladimir Meciar would lead to Slovakia's isolation. He felt he had no choice but to announce the referendum since by not doing so he would risk removal from office if the Constitutional Court were to decide that the referendum was not unconstitutional.\n\nLate last year the President refused to call another referendum demanded in a HZDS- organised petition to prohibit the use of minority languages in official texts and to ban the privatisation of strategic companies.\n\n(Source: Radio Slovakia International, September 5 2000)\n\niii) Illness of President Schuster\n\nThe political scene in Slovakia was overshadowed in the summer by the life-threatening illness of the President, Rudolph Schuster who was hospitalised in mid-June for colon surgery and subsequently underwent treatment in Austria before returning to Slovakia on 15 August. Following public and media criticism of the medical treatment he received in Slovakia, the Health Minister, Tibor Sagat, resigned and was replaced by party colleague Roman Kovac. An inquiry is underway to establish whether any mistakes made by doctors constitute criminal negligence.\n\nAlthough the President has relatively few powers, the threat that he might be unable to resume office and that a presidential election would have to be held has caused alarm. Mr Schuster's period in office has been seen as an important factor in lifting the international isolation Slovakia suffered under Mr Meciar's administration.\n\niv) Arrest of former Prime Minister Meciar\n\nOn 20 April Vladimir Meciar was arrested after police stormed his villa in western Slovakia. He was charged with fraud and abuse of power relating to the payment of illegal bonuses to cabinet members. He was released later the same day. Supporters of Mr Meciar staged mass protests against his arrest. Largely in response to Meciar's brief detention by the police, his party, the HZDS, boycotted parliamentary work for several weeks in May 2000\n\nv) Roma minority\n\nThe treatment of Slovakia's large Roma population (officially 1.6% but unofficially estimated at between 4.8 and 10% of the population) continues to cause mounting concern within the EU. A significant number of Slovak Roma have recently sought asylum in EU member states. However, while EU officials have expressed concern over the poor living conditions and high levels of unemployment among the Roma, they have also recognised the deep-seated nature of the problem, and view the Dzurinda government's efforts to resolve it as credible. For example, the government recently sought to eliminate the vestiges of official discrimination by ordering the National Labour Office (NUP) to stop identifying unemployed Roma in registration records. The Justice Ministry announced that it would be proposing amendments to the penal code to define more clearly what constitutes racially motivated attacks and to provide for stiffer sentences. The issue was given sharper focus in August following the murder of a Roma mother of eight.\n\nThe government insists that much of the recent emigration has been economically motivated, and in a clear sign of support for this stance, Norway and Finland have deported virtually all Slovak Roma asylum-seekers. Belgium reintroduced visa requirements for Slovak citizens on 1 September 2000 in response to a renewed wave of asylum requests from Roma.\n\nvi) Nuclear energy\n\nSlovakia has two operational nuclear power plants, Bohunice and Mochovce. In the face of safety concerns Slovakia had originally agreed to close the Soviet-designed Jaslovske Bohunice nuclear power plant in 2000, but then pushed the date back to 2010. Slovakia has since agreed to close the facility's two units in 2006 and 2008. The Commission has accepted this as a reasonable compromise, and has been pressing this view on Austrian officials, since the Austrian government has been threatening to veto Slovak EU accession failing a satisfactory solution to this problem.\n\nHowever, the government has postponed making a decision on whether to stop the construction of a third and a fourth bloc at the Mochovce nuclear power plant. Economy Minister Lubomir Harach indicated in February that there would be a surplus of electricity output and hence no need to complete the extra blocs, although some energy experts maintain they would be needed to make up the deficit caused by the shutdown of the old plant in Bohunice. Environmental groups and economic analysts say the country cannot afford to finish the construction. The cost of completing the project is estimated at 51 billion crowns ($1.23 billion), while returns from the initial investment are not expected for 17 years.\n\nvii) Corruption and abuse of power.\n\nIvan Lexa, former chief of the Slovak Intelligence Service, has filed a complaint with the European Court of Human Rights in connection with his continued investigation for alleged abuse of power and participation in the kidnapping of former President Michal Kovac's son in 1995. Mr Lexa had been granted an amnesty by former Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar, whose successor, Mikulas Dzurinda, revoked that pardon. A panel of judges on Slovakia's Constitutional Court examining the case of Mr Lexa's former deputy said the revoking of the amnesty was unconstitutional. Earlier, however, a panel of judges examining Mr Lexa's own case said that move was legal. The Slovak authorities are proceeding with Mr Lexa's investigation. In his appeal, Mr Lexa said his constitutional rights were being infringed, as his the principle of presumption of innocence before being proved guilty. On 24 August the Slovak Parliament decided that Lexa could be arrested . He is believed to have fled abroad and an arrest warrant has been issued.\n\nIn the other major case in which an amnesty had been granted by Mr Meciar, that against former Interior Minister Gustáv Krajcì charged with preventing the proper conduct of the 1997 referendum on NATO entry, a Bratislava district court decided on 1 July that the amnesty should be respected and effectively halted legal proceedings for the time being.\n\nThere have been several instances of allegations of corruption against ministers of the present government and party appointees to state enterprises since the beginning of the year. On a more general note the government presented the findings of a World Bank/USAID study on 20 June which claimed that corruption was widespread in Slovakia and that the situation had improved only slightly since the 1998 elections. The healthcare sector, the judicial system, customs offices, the National Property fund privatisation agency and licensing authorities were cited as the most corrupt. The current government's inaugural proramme contained a pledge to fight the endemic corruption and cronyism that characterised the Meciar administration, but the subsequent public exposure by the coalition parties of each other's alleged wrongdoings has served only to highlight the lack of action, especially as the governing coalition maintained its predecessor's policy of appointing political nominees to run state enterprises. Finally waking up to the problem, the government in January established an independent Bureau for Public tenders based on EU guidelines and in February unveiled a National Programme for the Fight against Corruption. However, although a Freedom of Information Law was passed on 18 May, the package of concrete measures announced in February by the Prime Minister has been delayed and ministries now have until 13 September to produce action plans. Many analysts believe that changes to the law on political party funding is the real way forward, as money has often been channelled to parties from state enterprises, but there seems to be little support for change among MPs who fear adverse public reaction to any move to increase state funding.\n\nviii) Memorial to Jozef Tiso\n\nThe city council of Zilina decided to unveil a plaque in memory of Slovakia's war-time head of state, Jozef Tiso. The unveiling was to take place on 14 March, the anniversary of the establishment of the Nazi puppet state, led by Tiso but the proposal was abandoned amid widespread criticism in government circles and from Romany groups, although it had been defended by the city mayor, a former leader of the nationalist SNS.\n\nIII. ECONOMIC SITUATION\n\na) Summary\n\nAlthough the Slovak economy grew at high rates during the mid 1990s it was also characterised by large macroeconomic imbalances and the absence of key structural reforms, thus making it vulnerable to crisis. While rapid growth in investment helped fuel rapid real GDP growth, much of this investment was financed either from abroad using government guarantees, or from the unreformed state-owned banks. This resulted in an exceptionally rapid increase in overall external indebtedness and a worsening bad loan problem domestically. The deficit of the general government reached about 5 percent of GDP in 1998. And the external current account deficit was 10 percent of GDP or more in each of the three years to 1998.\n\nA strong policy response was essential to reduce macroeconomic imbalances and re-invigorate structural reform. In this regard, the deficit of the general government has been reduced, the external current account deficit has narrowed, and, though yet to be completed, important steps have been made toward restructuring and privatising state-owned banks and enterprises, including by strengthening the bankruptcy framework. The decision by the EU to invite the Slovak Republic to start negotiations on EU accession has added to market confidence (1) .\n\nb) Forecast Performance\n\nThe Slovak economy continued to expand in 1999, albeit by a sluggish 1.9%, down from real GDP growth of 4.4% in 1998 and 6.5% in 1997. The austerity measures introduced in 1999 led to a contraction in domestic demand. However, favourable foreign demand helped the Slovak economy as a whole to avoid contraction in 1999. The Commission (2) expects that GDP growth will recover slightly in 2000 (2.2%) and more noticeably in 2000 (3.3%). Growth in 2000 is expected to remain moderate because domestic demand will be subdued, although less than in 1999.\n\nAlthough continued strong export growth is likely to continue, the contribution from net exports to growth should decline because import growth will accelerate again as a result of the less negative developments in domestic demand.\n\nLocal industry is to undergo massive restructuring during 2000-01. There will be a substantial improvement of the economy's competitiveness after dominant state banks are sold off and most of the utilities are part-privatised.\n\nc) Budget and Prices\n\nDetermined fiscal tightening - with the government policy package of May 1999 - was a key component to reducing macroeconomic imbalances. The general government deficit (excluding privatisation receipts) was reduced to 3.6% of GDP in 1999. Key elements of the package included an increase in the lower value added tax rate, higher excises, an import surcharge, measures to rationalise social assistance programs, as well as significant increases in important administered prices. Although tax collection was relatively weak, and social transfers were higher than budgeted, the authorities were able to hold the line on their target for the state budget by achieving savings in other areas. The 3% of GDP target for the general government deficit was exceeded mainly because of overruns in the extra budgetary funds.\n\nThe budget for 2000 again aims at a general government deficit of 3% of GDP. The plans include a number of tax reductions to promote entrepreneurial activity. The government counts significant revenues from privatisation, including banks and Slovak Telecom. These revenues will be used for settling outstanding debts (for example Slovak Railways), covering expected payments for existing state guarantees, and for a number of public investment projects.\n\nOwing to the legacy of the previous government, Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) levels remain comparatively low (3) . This has had a clear negative impact not only on the country's economic development, (high unemployment above 17%), but also on its political position. Several years without foreign capital, know-how and entrepreneurial culture led to a strong consensus in the ruling coalition on the need to remove obstacles to FDI flows, consisting of new incentives to attract FDI (institutional support, financial support, special economic zones). The government decided to privatise monopolies and to improve its international image. In the foreseeable future FDI flows are expected to be determined by the pace of privatisation and reforms in business legislation, approaching EU standards.\n\nIn order to promote enterprise restructuring, a revised bankruptcy law is currently being discussed by Parliament. By accelerating procedures, reinforcing the role of the creditors, and by increasing the possibilities for restructuring of the enterprise without liquidation, the bankruptcy framework should become an effective instrument for enterprise restructuring.\n\nConsumer prices rose sharply in 1999 owing to the liberalisation of administered prices, high global oil prices and the imposition of the import surcharge. Inflation ended 1999 with 10.6%, up from 6.7% in 1998. Due to the profile of the price increases in the past, inflation is expected to remain relatively high in 2000. With most of the backlog of administered price increases cleared by the end of 2000, inflation could fall further to amount 7.5% in 2000 (4) . The unemployment increased rapidly in 1999 and reached a level of above 17%. The main solution of the unemployment problem will have to come from a more dynamic private sector that starts creating jobs, especially in small and medium-sized enterprises.\n\nd) Trade\n\nSlovakia's external position improved substantially in 1999, with the current-account deficit falling to 0.7% of GDP, down from 10.1% of GDP in 1998 (5). The negative effects of the weak domestic developments on GDP growth were largely compensated by the contribution from net exports. Real exports grew by 7%, which is a good performance given the feeble economic growth during most of the year in Germany, the Czech Republic and Italy, Slovakia's main export markets. In addition, the sharp contraction of domestic demand resulted in a decline of real imports by 2.5%, compared to an increase by close to 10% in 1998. As a result, both the trade and current account deficits were almost halved to below 6% of GDP. Figures for the first months of 2000 confirm this positive trend.\n\nIn 2000 and 2001, the trade deficit is expected to shrink as export growth remains buoyant. Exports continue to be redirected to EU countries. In 1999 almost 57% of exports went to the EU (Germany 27.2%, Italy 8.8% and Austria 8.1%). The EU supplied almost 51% of imports (Germany 26.2%, Austria 7.1%). The Czech Republic took 10% of Slovak exports, and supplied 17% of Slovak imports.\n\nSlovakia is a member of the WTO and the Central Europe Free Trade Agreement, and has special trade agreements with the EU and the Czech Republic.\n\ne) Main Economic Trends and Forecast Summary\n\n19981999(e)2000(f)2001(f) Real GDP growth Rate (percent)4.41.92.23.3 Inflation (CPI, annual average percent)6.710.613.27.5 General Government budget balance (% of DGP)-4.8-3.6 Current Account balance (% of GDP)-10.1-5.7-4.9-3.8 Unemployment rate (end-of-year, ILO definition)12.517.1\n\n(e) estimate. (f) forecast.\n\nSource: European Commission, European Economy Supplement, May 2000\n\nf) External Relations\n\nThe main body of the Community acquis in the area of external economic relations consists of standards that are directly binding in all states. In principle, this means that no legal harmonisation is required. Within the WTO, of which Slovakia is a member, Slovakia needs to adopt agreements on public procurement and civil aviation. Laws on antidumping and safeguards were adopted in 1997 (6).\n\nSlovakia is optimistic that it will be able to join the European Union at the same time or soon after the Czech Republic, according to Jan Figel, deputy foreign minister and the country's chief negotiator with the EU (7).\n\nSlovakia only began negotiating with the EU this year, two years after the Czechs, because it failed to meet the democratic criteria for membership under the previous government of Vladimir Meciar.\n\nThe current government, which took office in November 1998, has set a target date of 2004 to join the EU, one year after the target date for the Czech Republic, Poland and Hungary. Slovakia hopes to either to catch up with the other three, or to agree special transitional arrangements which could ease the problems of different entry dates.\n\nHowever, if the Czech Republic joined first and, as looks likely, the EU refused to allow it to retain its customs union with Slovakia, the government would seek an addendum to its Europe Agreement with the EU covering a limited number of farm products. Alternatively Slovakia could ask for compensation from the EU under World Trade Organisation rules.\n\nAt the end of July 2000, Slovakia (8) was invited to join the OECD and will become a member in the autumn. Membership had been stalled by considerations concerning structural reforms and radio-television broadcasting rules. Membership should provide a positive signal to foreign investors and stimulate the government's recent efforts to attract greater guarantees of foreign capital.\n\n(See annexes 2 and 3 for basic statistics and external trade data.)\n\n(1) IMF, \"IMF Concludes Article IV Consultation with Slovak Republic\", July 28, 2000.\n\n(2) European Commission, DG, Economic and Financial Affairs, \"Country Notes: Slovak Republic\", May 2000.\n\n(3) Oxford Analytica, \"Slovak: Government boosts FDI incentues\", June 23, 2000.\n\n(4) Economic Intelligence Unit, \"Slovakia Economy Country Briefing\", July 19, 2000.\n\n(5) European Commission, European Economy, Supplement C, \"Results from the Commission's spring 2000 Economic Forecast of the Candidate Countries\", May 2000.\n\n(6) Oxford Analytica, \"Slovakia: EU negotiations begin\", May 1, 2000.\n\n(7) Financial Times, \"Slovakia Economy - Optimistic over EU entry\", May 12, 2000\n\n(8) OxfordAnalytica, \"Slovakia\", July 31, 2000."
