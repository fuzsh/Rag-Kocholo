        "text": "Right at the heart of Europe with a history closely intertwined with its neighbours, Slovakia has managed to preserve its own language and distinct culture.\n\nIt was part of Czechoslovakia until the \"velvet divorce\" in January 1993.\n\nIndependent Slovakia went through an initial period of political turbulence, but it weathered the 2008 financial crisis to emerge as a prosperous and stable parliamentary democracy.\n\nThe country joined Nato and the European Union in 2004, and the eurozone in 2009, and sent troops on peacekeeping missions to Afghanistan, Iraq, and Kosovo.\n\nSlovakia has a significant Romany population, which suffers disproportionately high levels of poverty and social deprivation.\n\nThe country has recently seen an increasingly toxic political climate, and the 2024 attempted assassination of populist Prime Minister Robert Fico threatens to deepen the polarisation still further.\n\nPrime Minister Robert Fico is recovering after being shot and seriously wounded in an assassination attempt in May 2024.\n\nThe prime minister was left fighting for his life after being shot four times at close range in the central town of Handlova as he greeted supporters after a government meeting.\n\nHe is said to have undergone a number of operations.\n\nThe veteran politician, who has previously served as prime minister, returned to power in September 2023 at the head of a populist-nationalist coalition.\n\nDuring the election campaign, Fico's party, Smer-SSD pledged an immediate end to military support for Ukraine but denied being pro-Russian.\n\nMEDIA\n\nSome key dates in the history of Slovakia:\n\n1st Century AD - Roman Empire establishes military forts and border settlements along the Danube.\n\n377 - Huns cross the Danube and establish short-lived Hunnic Empire in the region under Attila.\n\n5th Century - Slavic peoples begin settling in the area.\n\n568 - Avars invade and settle in the Middle Danube region.\n\n803 - Avar Khaganate collapses as a result of several successful military campaigns launched by Charlemagne.\n\n825-870 - Principality of Nitra.
