Carnrick, which was founded almost 100 years ago, is a subsidiary of GWC Health, and specialises in relief for acute painful musculoskeletal conditions. It had sales last year of $51.2m.

Elan says the acquisition will be earnings neutral in the current year, and the $150m price tag will be paid in a combination of cash and a promissory note.

The acquisition fits with Elan's strategy to acquire pharmaceutical companies which have complementary treatments to its existing drug-delivery and neurological products, thereby increasing its ``stable'' of products for the market now and in-development products for future changes in the market.

``The acquisition of Carnrick will significantly expand our neuromuscular portfolio of directly-marketed products,'' Donal Geaney, Elan chairman and chief executive said.

The deal will provide further promotion opportunities through the addition of of Carnrick's 130 strong sales force to Elan's existing 150 people in the US, Mr Geaney said.

``The transaction will accelerate the development of our US pharmaceuticals business by increasing the range of products we offer, and will enhance our capability to fully exploit our pipeline of late-stage products in development,'' Mr Geaney added.

Carnrick will operate as a business unit of Athena Neurosciences, which since its acquisition by Elan last year is the group's neurology division focussed on the discovery, development and marketing of therapeutic products and diagnostic services for patients with neurological disorders.

Edmond Bergeron, chairman and chief executive officer of Carnrick, will continue in that role in Elan.

Carnrick's principal product is Skelaxin, which is used for the relief of acute painful musculoskeletal conditions by general practitioners and pain specialists in the United States and Puerto Rico.

Elan employs almost 1,000 people in its Dublin headquarters, research laboratories and its pharmaceutical facility in Athlone.
