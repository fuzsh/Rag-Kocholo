Elan Corporation grew to success through a strategy of smaller acquisitions rather than mega-mergers. It acquired Athena Neurosciences in 1996, gaining a neuroscience focus and drugs to market. Athena provided marketing capabilities while Elan had manufacturing and development strengths. The acquisition transformed Elan into a fully integrated pharmaceutical company. Elan subsequently acquired marketing rights to additional neurological drugs, expanding its portfolio while avoiding conflicts with existing drug delivery clients. Through such targeted acquisitions and strategic alliances, Elan was able to maximize growth without the risks of larger mergers.",
