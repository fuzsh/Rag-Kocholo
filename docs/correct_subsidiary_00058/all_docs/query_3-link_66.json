SELKOE, M.D., (hereinafter \"CONSULTANT\"), having an address at 166 Moss Hill Road, Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts 02130. The following terms and conditions will govern the parties to this Agreement: 1. Prior and Other Work of Consultant. (a) CONSULTANT is a member of the Professional Staff of Brigham and Women's Hospital (\"Brigham\"), is a member of the Faculty of Medicine of Harvard University (\"Harvard\"), is responsible for a variety of clinical and research duties, and is subject to all requirements imposed by the following instruments, warranted by CONSULTANT to be in force on the Effective Date (as hereinafter defined), a copy of each of which is attached hereto and made a part hereof: (a) Brigham and Women's Hospital Patent Policy, (b) Brigham's Statement of Policy on Consulting Agreements, and (c) a certain Brigham and Women's Hospital Participation Agreement, dated March 16, 1986 between Brigham and the CONSULTANT (all of <PAGE> which individually or collectively are referred to hereinafter as \"instruments\"). (b) Subject to his obligations under the instruments, the CONSULTANT hereby warrants that he is free to enter into this Agreement with the COMPANY and to provide the consulting services required hereunder and the CONSULTANT represents that he is not a party to any existing agreement which would prevent his entering into this Agreement or which would affect the COMPANY'S rights or the CONSULTANT'S duties under this Agreement. (c) The CONSULTANT advises the COMPANY that the CONSULTANT is a member of the professional staff of Brigham and the faculty of Harvard, as described above, and that to his best knowledge and belief, this Agreement is not in conflict with the patent and copyright policy of Brigham or Harvard, if any, or in conflict with the instruments or any of the CONSULTANT'S commitments thereunder. The CONSULTANT agrees to use his best efforts to (i) segregate work done under this Agreement from his work done for Brigham or Harvard, as the case may be, so as to minimize any questions of disclosure of, or rights under, any inventions to Brigham or Harvard, as the case may be, and (ii) assist the COMPANY and Brigham or Harvard, as the case may 2 <PAGE> be, in fairly resolving any such questions which may arise. (d) The CONSULTANT agrees that for the term of this Agreement, and for a period of six (6) months thereafter, the CONSULTANT will not, without the prior written consent of the COMPANY, enter into any agreement with anyone other than the COMPANY to consult or otherwise render services in the Field (as hereinafter defined), provided that this Agreement shall not abrogate the CONSULTANT'S obligations to Brigham or Harvard. During the term of this Agreement, and for a period of six (6) months thereafter, CONSULTANT will not (i) own, manage, operate or control, or participate in the ownership, management, operation or control of (except that, for purposes of this subparagraph, an ownership interest of one percent (1%) or less of a corporation with a class of securities registered under the Securities Act of 1934, as amended, shall not be prohibited), or (ii) be associated with as a director, officer, employee, partner or consultant (whether or not for compensation), or (iii) permit the use of his name in connection with any corporation, partnership, joint venture, sole proprietorship or any other form of business which is or will be, directly or indirectly, 3 <PAGE> selling products or services in the Field (as hereinafter defined). Before performing any services for others, as a consultant or otherwise, in the Field other than the services required by his principal employment, CONSULTANT shall, during the term of this Agreement, and for a period of six (6) months thereafter, notify the COMPANY of the general nature of the services to be performed and the party for whom they will be performed, in order that the COMPANY may determine whether a conflict of interest may arise. (e) The CONSULTANT agrees not to disclose to the COMPANY any trade secrets or other information which he does not have the right to disclose, and which the COMPANY is not free to use without liability of any kind. The CONSULTANT further agrees to inform the COMPANY of any patents, known to him, which the COMPANY may be in a position to violate as a result of information provided by the CONSULTANT. Consistent with and during the term of this Agreement, the CONSULTANT agrees to inform the COMPANY of any other research he is involved in which is or becomes directly within the scope of the work described on Appendix A attached hereto and related to the 4 <PAGE> subject matter of this Agreement. It is understood and agreed that as a member of the professional staff of Brigham, CONSULTANT is responsible to disclose to Brigham any discovery or inventions made by him as defined in the Brigham Participation Agreement and to file this present Consulting Agreement with Brigham, before execution hereof, in order that Brigham can fully comply with its contractual obligations and commitments. 2.

Effective as of the date this Consulting Agreement is executed by CONSULTANT (\"Effective Date\"), and continuing for the next following year (365 days), CONSULTANT shall serve as a consultant and scientific advisor to COMPANY within the field of research and clinical practice pertaining to diagnostic strategies relating to Alzheimer's Disease, as and to the extent described on the attached Appendix A (hereinafter \"Field\"), and also including such other work as hereinafter from time to time may be designated by the parties in writing to be part of the Field, to the extent his commitments to Brigham and Harvard do not preclude such engagement. This Agreement shall renew automatically for consecutive one-year (365 day) terms, unless either party notifies the other at least 60 days prior to any anniversary of the Effective Date hereof of an intent not to renew under the terms hereof. 5 <PAGE> 3.

At the end of said period the CONSULTANT at his sole discretion, shall have the right to submit the manuscript for publication.
