In 1988, she joined the research department at Biogen and was a member of project teams that have moved drugs from development, into the clinic and finally to regulatory approval (Avonex, Tysabri, Tecfidera). In 2011, Susan joined Elan Pharmaceuticals as Vice President of Translational Science and in 2013 became an independent scientific advisor in the field of translational science with a focus on neurological diseases.\n\nSince about 2000, finding areas of collaboration between the biotech industry and academic groups has also been a major area of her focus. She has initiated and managed more than 100 collaborations in these areas. Dr. Goelz is an author on more than 60 publications, dozens of posters and lectures presented at international meetings; and is named as an inventor on several patents.\n\n- Back to top -\n\nPeter Calabresi, M.D., Director of the Multiple Sclerosis Center at Johns Hopkins.\n\nDr. Peter Calabresi received his undergraduate degree from Yale University and his medical degree from Brown University. He then completed an internship and residency training in internal medicine at Strong Memorial Hospital. He went on to complete a fellowship in Neuroimmunology at the National Institutes of Health.\n\nNow a Professor of Neurology at Johns Hopkins, Dr. Calabresi serves as the Director of the Multiple Sclerosis Center, focusing on the diagnosis and management of MS. He is the principal investigator on several clinical trials and oversees research projects seeking to create new anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective therapies for MS.\n\nDr. Calabresi’s specific laboratory research interest lies in understanding the mechanisms of T lymphocyte migration into the brain and spinal cord. He has published numerous articles on the adhesion molecules and chemokine receptors responsible for T cell homing to the brain in MS, and was involved in the early testing of natalizumab (Tysabri). He also has funding from the National Institutes of Health to study a potassium channel, Kv1.3, which is specifically and highly expressed on chronically activated immune cells in the blood and brains of people with MS.\n\nDr. Calabresi’s group was awarded a five year Tissue Repair MS center grant from the National MS Society to study mechanisms of neurodegeneration and strategies for neuroprotection in MS. This has fueled extensive collaborations with neuroscientists at Hopkins utilizing a variety of transgenic and knockout mice to examine the mechanisms of myelin and axon pathology that may occur in MS. Im addition, his group collaborates with imaging experts at Hopkins and NIH utilizing cutting edge brain and spinal cord MRI technologies such as diffusion tensor imaging as well as optical coherence tomography (OCT), which allow assessments of axonal integrity.\n\n- Back to top -\n\nProfessor Gavin Giovannoni MBBCh, Ph.D., FCP (S.A., Neurol.), FRCP, FRCPath\n\nGavin Giovannoni was appointed to the Chair of Neurology, Blizard Institute, Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University London and the Department of Neurology, Barts Health NHS Trust in November 2006. Gavin did his undergraduate medical training at the University of the Witwatersrand, South Africa, where he graduated in 1987. He moved to the Institute of Neurology, University College London, Queen Square, London in 1993 after completing his specialist training in neurology in South Africa. He was awarded a PhD in immunology from the University of London in 1998. He was appointed as a Clinical Senior Lecturer, Royal Free and University College Medical School, in 1998 and moved back to Institute of Neurology, Queen Square in 1999. He was promoted to Reader in Neuroimmunology in 2004.\n\nHis clinical interests are multiple sclerosis and other inflammatory disorders of the central nervous system. He is particularly interested in clinical issues related to optimizing MS disease modifying therapies. His current research is focused on Epstein Barr virus as a possible cause of multiple sclerosis, defining the “multiple sclerosis endophenotype”, multiple sclerosis related neurodegeneration, multiple sclerosis biomarker discovery, multiple sclerosis clinical outcomes and immune tolerance strategies. His team focuses on translational research and therefore have an active clinical trial programme.\n\n- Back to top -\n\nAndrew Hill, Ph.D., Director of the La Trobe Research Centre for the Study of Extracellular Vesicles (RCEV)\n\nProfessor Andy Hill gained his PhD at Imperial College, London, studying the molecular basis of human prion disease strains. He has spent nearly 30 years researching the molecular basis of neurodegenerative diseases and identifying new biomarkers for disorders such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s and prion diseases. His laboratory works on the understanding of molecular mechanisms underpinning neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s and prion diseases with an aim of translating fundamental discoveries into the design of novel therapeutics and diagnostics for neurodegenerative diseases. He has published over 200 publications, been the recipient of several awards and prizes including a Victorian Young Tall Poppy Award in 2006, the Beckman Coulter Discovery Science Award (2019) from the Australian Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, and the 2020 Special Achievement Award from the International Society for Extracellular Vesicles.\n\nThe Hill lab uses a combination of Biochemistry, Molecular and Cell Biology to investigate neurodegenerative diseases. The lab is interested in understanding the molecular mechanisms by which these proteins exert their neurodegenerative properties and in the case of prion proteins, gain their infectious properties.\n\nThe lab is also interested in extracellular vesicles such as exosomes and microvesicles as vehicles for the transfer of misfolded proteins between cells. It also investigates the RNA content of these vesicles using next generation sequencing.\n\nThe lab is based at the La Trobe Institute for Molecular Science, at La Trobe University in Melbourne, Australia\n\n- Back to top -\n\nTed Yednock, Ph.D., Consultant\n\nDr. Yednock is a scientific advisor to several companies and foundations focused on neurodegeneration, inflammation and oncology. He was previously Chief Scientific Officer for Prothena Biosciences, Head of Research for Elan Pharmaceuticals and a scientist at Athena Neurosciences (which was purchased by Elan). While at Athena, Dr. Yednock initiated research on multiple sclerosis that led to the development of Tysabri®, a marketed monoclonal antibody with 2012 sales exceeding $1.5 billion. In addition to his work in multiple sclerosis, Dr. Yednock has contributed to the invention or progression of more than a dozen drugs in the areas of rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn’s disease, pain, Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson's disease. He has been involved in collaborations with Biogen-Idec, Wyeth/Genetics Institute, Johnson & Johnson, Janssen Alzheimer's Immunotherapy, the Michael J. Fox Foundation, the Alzheimer’s Drug Discovery Foundation and the Parkinson’s Institute, among many others. Dr. Yednock earned his B.S. in Biology and Chemistry from the University of Illinois and his Ph.D. in Anatomy and Cell Biology from UCSF, where he also completed postdoctoral fellowships in Cell Biology and Immunology."
