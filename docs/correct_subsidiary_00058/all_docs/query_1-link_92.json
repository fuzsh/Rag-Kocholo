Rydel, Ph.D has been working with the Myelin Repair Foundation since November 2007, bringing more than 20 years of experience in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries. He is interested in a number of therapeutic areas including neurology, pain, inflammation, and associated autoimmune disorders such at multiple sclerosis. \n\t\n\tFrom 1996–2005 he held a number of leadership positions at Elan Pharmaceuticals, Inc., most recently as Vice President and Head, Department of Pharmacology, where his groups had responsibilities for a number of drug discovery programs within the therapeutic areas of Alzheimer’s disease, asthma, multiple sclerosis, neuropathic pain, and Parkinson’s disease. Prior to its acquisition by Elan in 1996, Russell was Associate Director of Neurobiology at Athena Neurosciences, Inc. where he published seminal findings on the biology of the amyloid-b protein and the amyloid-b precursor protein, and focused on the development of novel therapies for Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease. \n\t\n\tRussell received his B.A. in Chemistry from Grinnell College and his M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Neurobiology and Pharmacology from the Department of Pharmacology at New York University School of Medicine. Prior to joining Athena Neurosciences, Inc. in 1989, Russell was an American Cancer Society Postdoctoral Fellow in the Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry at the University of California, Berkeley.",
