Thomas E. RATHJEN Genencor Hires Wall Street Veteran as VP of Investor Relations Genencor International Inc. has hired Thomas E. Rathjen, a Wall Street veteran, to lead its investor relations efforts.

This is the top award given annually by the American Red Cross. Ms. Smith received this award May 30, 2002, at the American Red Cross National Convention. Beginning her volunteer work with the American Red Cross in her high school years, Ms. Smith has continued in her devotion to helping others. She began working with disaster services in 1988 with the local Chapter, and accepted her first national assignment in Puerto Rico serv ing victims of Hurricane Hugo in 1989. Ms. Smith is fluent in Spanish so she was ideally equipped to serve in Puerto Rico. Since that time she has served on many national and local assignments. Currently, she is the Disaster Services chairperson for the local Chapter and chair of the Dis aster Committee for the Red Cross in the state of Tennessee. Ms. Smith holds an Ph.D. from the University of Texas, Austin; a master of science in nursing from the University of Maryland, in mental health nursing; and a bachelor of science in nursing from ETSU. She works as a clinical research associate for CTMS Inc. (Clinical Trial Man agement Services Inc.) in Bristol, Tenn. Congress has charged the American Red Cross with the responsibili ty for disaster response and aid to military families. Disaster response occurs essentially every day. The most common type of disaster is dis placement of a single family caused by fire. In this case, immediate assis tance is needed in finding a safe environment, food, and clothing. The American Red Cross also may assist with needed medication or occupa tional needs such as uniforms for working persons to be able to return to work following a fire in their home. Recently, Ms. Smith’s services were requested for disaster response in New York City, following the tragedies of September 11, 2001. Ms. Smith provides mental health counseling and is a soughtafter resource because not all mental health professionals can readily provide services across state lines in times of disaster. Recognizing the need, Ms. Smith’s employer, CTMS, granted her two weeks’ leave to travel to New York. “This was a significant contribution from CTMS because others in mental health services are in private practice and have to rearrange patient loads in order to respond,” Ms. Smith says. In New York City, the American Red Cross set up a variety of services for those affected. Many were without shelter because their apartments were inaccessi ble due to safety and security reasons. Her primary role is to provide mental health counseling, but in NewYorkCity she did many things. “It is important to take care of the responders, fire fighters, and police offi cers,” she says. “We are there to make sure rescuers get that cup of coffee and sand wich, as would anyone else. In New York City, mental health needs of the responders were multiplied by the fact that they knew many of their colleagues had been killed or injured. When responders know the victims, it causes them to react differently and we are there to make sure the stresses and strains are being addressed. We assist through counseling, direct intervention, education, and occasional ly with the interjection of humor.” A Nashville apartment fire in 2001 was a tragedy that also required Ms. Smith’s presence. More than 150 people, mostly elderly, were dis placed. They were without essentials such as medications, dentures, glass es, and oxygen equipment, and the American Red Cross came to the res cue by reconnecting or replacing these things. CTMS is a contract research organization providing clinical trial man agement, data management, and quality assurance services to the phar maceutical/biotechnology industries. CTMS employs 133 people, with offices in Bristol, and WinstonSalem, N.C. Beth Smith was the recipient of the American Red Cross’ to award — the 2002 National Disaster Services’ volunteer.
