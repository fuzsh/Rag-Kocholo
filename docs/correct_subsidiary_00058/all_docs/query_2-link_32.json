        "text": "The drug industry has bet heavily on one theory about the disease. What if that theory is wrong?\n\nIn 1906 a German psychiatrist described the puzzling case of a 56-year-old woman who had just died after years of progressive memory loss and hallucinations. An autopsy found her brain shriveled and filled with strange protein deposits. The disease, which took on the name of the psychiatrist, Alois Alzheimer, still mystifies doctors a century later. Researchers still debate its cause. And there are no treatments that stop its relentless and fatal course.\n\nBut that could be about to change. In a multibillion-dollar gamble, some of the world's biggest drug companies have begun final-stage trials of drugs that aim to slow or halt the progression of the devastating dementia. The products of over two decades of research, these drugs target the prime suspect in Alzheimer's disease, the telltale amyloid clumps spotted by the German doctor.\n\nBy clearing out those deposits or halting their production, researchers hope to slow brain cell death and alter the course of the illness. Even a drug that eased the decline only modestly could keep millions of patients out of nursing homes for years. \"If we could keep people who are still functioning from having any further decline for five years--then they would probably die from something else,\" says Todd Golde, a neuroscientist at the Mayo Clinic, in Jacksonville, Fla. \"The impact would be immeasurable.\"\n\nUltimately, doctors hope to use the disease-slowing drugs in conjunction with new brain-scanning methods being tested at General Electric and elsewhere that will detect early signs of amyloid buildup. People with mild memory loss will get a brain scan to see if plaques are present. If they are, they'll then start the drugs right away to stop the disease in its tracks.\n\n\"Pretty much every pharmaceutical company in the world\" is testing amyloid-busting drugs, says Menelas Pangalos, vice president for neuroscience research at the pharmaceutical firm Wyeth. Wyeth has spent over $500 million on Alzheimer's since 2001 and has four antiamyloid drugs in human testing. Its lead one is an antibody developed with Elan Corp. that has been shown to destroy 80% of the amyloid in the brains of affected mice.\n\nEli Lilly is hot on Wyeth's heels. Lilly has pursued Alzheimer's for nearly a quarter of a century. Its pill blocks an enzyme involved in amyloid production. Says Lilly's research chief, Steven Paul, \"If amyloid isn't connected to the disease pathogenesis, God is playing a fairly mean trick on us.\" A dark horse in the race is Myriad Genetics , whose Flurizan pill aims to prevent the body from producing the most toxic form of amyloid.\n\nBut by focusing so heavily on amyloid, the drug industry is taking a big risk. Even after decades of research, the case that amyloid buildup is the main cause of the disease is hardly airtight. Studies have found that some people who die from other diseases, with no dementia, still have amyloid in their brains.\n\nThe trials \"are based largely on theory and hope--and some rather considerable business considerations,\" says University of Southern California psychiatrist Lon Schneider, a consultant to several companies. \"None of the drugs have shown evidence of efficacy yet.\" Geneticist John Hardy, one of the first to finger amyloid as a suspect, puts the odds at 50-50 that one of the antiamyloid drugs will work. \"We are all on tenterhooks,\" he says.\n\nSome researchers argue that amyloid is one of many factors in the disease and may not be the primary one for most people. \"We may get rid of plaques, but it may not do anything,\" says John Trojanowski of the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nAnother potential culprit in the brains of Alzheimer's patients is neurofibrillary tangles. And other researchers are examining the role of a bad gene, apolipoprotein E e4. It can increase the risk of Alzheimer's disease tenfold.\n\nProponents of the amyloid theory \"listen to each other and reinforce each other, and after a while it becomes more of a religious belief,\" says Zaven Khachaturian, former head of Alzheimer's research at the National Institutes of Health. He thinks companies should diversify--but until recently \"if you spoke against amyloid it was like committing religious heresy.\"\n\nThe stakes could hardly be higher. Five million Americans suffer from Alzheimer's; the number could surge to 7.7 million by 2030. One in six women and one in ten men will get it. Existing drugs such as Aricept merely improve symptoms temporarily without slowing brain cell death. Drugs that slowed the decline would be surefire bestsellers.\n\nMyriad will wrap up its final-stage trial any month now. Even more intensely awaited are the results of a second-stage trial of Wyeth's antibody, bapineuzumab. Both companies may reveal results this summer. Says Khachaturian, \"If these trials work, it will open the floodgates. If they don't, we are back to square one.\"\n\nHarvard neurologist Dennis Selkoe is a champion of the amyloid theory. A charismatic and convincing speaker, he has been touting it for two decades. \"There's hardly a piece of evidence that doesn't support the idea that amyloid is the cause,\" he insists. \"The naysayers say, 'People like you pollute the field,' and 'People are hoodwinked.' But [scientists] aren't that stupid. They vote with their test tubes, and they have put their test tubes into a huge number of experiments over this amyloid hypothesis.\"\n\nSelkoe teamed up with venture capitalists in 1986 to found Athena Neurosciences, now part of Elan Corp. of Dublin, Ireland. He stayed at Harvard but serves as an Elan board member.\n\nSubscribe to Forbes and Save.

The research initially \"was very vague,\" says Patrick May, a researcher at Lilly; the scientists had no clear molecular targets at which to aim their drugs. But in 1991 British researchers identified a gene defect that causes rare, early-onset Alzheimer's. It does so, Selkoe's lab figured out, by boosting the secretion of amyloid fragments by brain cells. Those fragments later clump into larger amyloid plaques.\n\nThe finding provided a clue for drug designers. The Lilly and Elan scientists figured that by blocking gamma secretase, an enzyme responsible for creating the amyloid fragments, they might halt amyloid production itself. By the mid-1990s Lilly's chemists had devised drugs that did this in lab mice. Everything looked very promising--until animal safety tests began. One day May got an unwelcome call. \"We've never seen this before,\" a toxicologist told him. Just a few doses had damaged the intestinal linings of rats. It turns out gamma secretase plays a role in regulating cell growth in the intestines.\n\nElan and Eli Lilly went their separate ways when their deal expired in 1998. By then a researcher at Elan named Dale Schenk had come up with a radical new idea for removing plaques: Why couldn't you make a vaccine to stimulate the immune system to clear the plaques? He developed one, and it worked beautifully in mice. The results caught the eye of a Wyeth researcher, J. Steven Jacobsen, who made sure his boss met Schenk when the latter spoke at a conference near Wyeth's lab. The companies started collaborating in 2000.\n\nThe vaccine sped into a second-stage trial amid worldwide excitement. But after only two of six scheduled doses in 2002, Elan and Wyeth had to halt the trial. Eighteen of 300 patients suffered brain swelling, an apparent immune reaction to the vaccine. The vaccine was dead.\n\nWyeth and Elan next turned their attention to amyloid antibodies that Elan had previously prepared. The antibodies were just as effective as the vaccine at scarfing up plaques. Patient trials began in 2003, and by 2006 the companies had a glimmer of good news. In a tiny 30-patient trial, 8 patients who got the same particular dosage all seemed to improve after four months; patients who got greater or lesser dosages didn't do better.\n\nBy this point Eli Lilly had resurrected its gamma-secretase program. Soon after the Elan deal ended, Lilly's chemists made a few tweaks and devised a new secretase blocker that showed fewer side effects in animals. Serendipitously, the new drug was digested quickly in the blood, reducing its intestinal side effects, but was more stable once it reached the brain. Human trials began in 2000. They proceeded at a glacial pace because of the safety concerns, but by 2006 researchers had found a dosage that seemed safe and was slashing amyloid blood levels by 60%.\n\nMyriad got into the antiamyloid business almost by accident. In 2000 the Salt Lake City biotech firm bought the rights to a chemical cousin of an existing anti-inflammatory, hoping it would work as a cancer preventive. The next year Golde, at the Mayo Clinic, and his collaborator Edward Koo, at uc, San Diego, showed--at least in the test tube--that high doses of ibuprofen and other anti-inflammatories could lower production of amyloid-beta-42, which was believed to be a bad type of amyloid. Anti-inflammatory drugs can cause ulcers, so Koo and Golde searched for chemically similar drugs without this shortcoming. That led them to the drug Myriad had licensed, Flurizan. In mice it slashed brain amyloid levels by 50%, and it boosted their ability to navigate mazes.\n\nWhen it learned of these results Myriad switched its focus from cancer to Alzheimer's disease and began a trial of 210 men and women with mild to moderate Alzheimer's symptoms. \"It's almost a miracle drugs get to the market, given the obstacles. When serendipity comes, you pay attention,\" says Adrian Hobden, the president of Myriad's drug unit. The drug didn't help those with moderate cases, but at the highest dose it did tend to help those with mild symptoms.\n\nMyriad could have done a midsize trial to nail down that result. Instead, it boldly risked everything on its current trial of 1,684 patients--a $100 million gamble. \"If this trial is positive, all hell breaks loose,\" Hobden says. Wyeth and Elan began final-stage trials of their antibody on 4,000 patients in December, without waiting for the full results of their 240-patient second-stage trial. Lilly is testing its gamma-secretase inhibitor on 1,500 patients. The course of Alzheimer's disease is so slow and variable that only giant trials are likely to prove an effect. Wyeth and Lilly won't get results until 2011. Lilly and Wyeth say they are looking into nonamyloid drugs as well.\n\nAs the drug trials proceed, theories challenging the amyloid-only hypothesis are emerging. One comes from a maverick Harvard researcher, Jie Shen. Likening plaque deposits to \"tombstones,\" she says the field historically has been too focused on autopsy findings like plaques rather than on whatever is killing brain cells while people are still alive.\n\nShe doesn't rule out a role for amyloid, but she blames Alzheimer's on damage to two proteins called presenilin. Mutations in the genes for the proteins cause early-onset Alzheimer's. Researchers have traditionally figured that that was because the mutations boost amyloid buildup. But Shen argues that presenilin may have important functions in nourishing neurons that are disrupted in Alzheimer's. When she created a strain of mice with the presenilin genes missing in their brains, the mice developed dementia and brain cell death just like Alzheimer's sufferers, but the mice had no amyloid deposits. Her mice, she argues, better mimic Alzheimer's disease than do mice that are genetically engineered to have amyloid gunking up their brains; those mice tend to have little brain cell death.\n\nOthers say the Alzheimer's field has it backwards. Far from being harmful, amyloid is \"actually a response to injury that the brain secretes to protect itself, like a scar,\" argues Mark Smith, a neuroscientist at Case Western Reserve University. By removing it, \"you will make the disease worse.\" Amyloid deposits are often found near cerebral blood vessels, hinting that amyloid may act as a sealant for damaged blood vessels.\n\nUniversity of Southampton neuropathologist James Nicoll autopsied nine Alzheimer's patients who got Elan's vaccine in 2000. Their brains had 60% less amyloid than a control group. Yet eight of nine still had end-stage dementia before they died, suggesting that plaque removal won't stop the disease, he says. (Elan points to another study showing that some vaccine patients had less disability after five years than those who got a placebo.) If amyloid researchers fail, says Smith, \"it will be like they have run a marathon in the wrong direction.\"\n\nBy the Numbers\n\n5.2 million Americans have Alzheimer's disease now.\n\n7.7 million Americans will have it by 2030.\n\n71,696 Deaths from Alzheimer's in 2005.\n\n45% Increase in Alzheimer's deaths since 2000.\n\n$148 billion Yearly cost of treating and caring for these patients.\n\nSource: Alzheimer's Association."
