        "text": "Chief Technology Officer & Sr. Vice President, xMRC\n\nServing as the CTO and Senior Vice President for Xfinity Mobile Retail Convergence - XMRC, Franklyn drives the division’s overall technology strategy, as well as helps to ensure alignment of the architecture and product portfolio for the next era of wireless communication.

Additionally, Franklyn frequently volunteers with young adults teaching code development, software user interface methods, and engineering design process and fundamentals, as well as application and systems programming.\n\nRetired Principal Systems Consultant\n\nLPA Software\n\nAlice Jo Lichtman was born in Buffalo, N. Y. in 1937, where her father John Josiah Maisel was an internist-gastroenterologist and her mother Ida Rubenstein Maisel was a homemaker who was active in various organizations in the community.\n\nAlice Jo, along with her mother and sister, lived in Phoenix, Arizona from 1942 to 1945 to be near the military base where her father was stationed during World War II. They remained there while he was sent overseas. He was a medical officer and was in France, Austria, and Germany caring for wounded troops in mobile military hospitals. He was attached to Patton’s 3rd Army and participated in the liberation of the concentration camps, the conditions in which he documented on a small pocket camera.\n\nAfter the war her family returned to Buffalo, where Alice Jo completed grade and high school. She attended Wellesley College for three years majoring in economics. In the summer after here third year, she married Marshall A. Lichtman, a medical student at the University of Buffalo, and finished her fourth year of college at the University of Buffalo. After graduation, she worked as the administrator of a small psychiatric clinic, newly established to provide services for patients of limited means.\n\nShe moved to Rochester, New York in 1960 for her husband’s medical residency training and had two daughters during that time, Susan and Joanne. The family spent two years in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where her husband fulfilled the government service required of young men in that era. In his case, he served in the Public Health Service.\n\nThey returned to Rochester where he completed his training and joined the faculty of the University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry. Soon, thereafter, Alice Jo had her third daughter, Pamela. Alice Jo returned to work as a school librarian, which provided her with flexible hours. As her children became more independent, she returned to graduate school to obtain her master’s degree in computer science at RIT.\n\nThereafter, she worked, initially, for Security Trust Company where she was part of a team that designed the first automatic teller machine in Rochester. Subsequently, she joined LPA Software, a small company that provided consulting services for the development of customized computer programs for companies, many at that time in the Fortune Five Hundred category, including Eastman Kodak, Xerox, Data General, Hewlett-Packard, IBM, and others. Since several of the installations were in Central American subsidiaries, she traveled to those locales and learned sufficient Spanish to help in her dealings at those facilities.\n\nShe retired in 2002, after which she has done volunteer work with a number of community groups. She also has the great joy of spending time with her six grandsons and one granddaughter. She resides in Los Angeles to be closer to family.\n\nTechnical Lead & Manager for App Engine,\n\nGoogle and Co-founder, Exablox\n\nWhile Exablox Co-Founder and former CTO Tad Hunt ’97 is certainly proud of the technology he built at the startup that revolutionized data storage by making it scalable, the team he built there is perhaps his biggest accomplishment.\n\n“The dream of every good founder is to build such a great team that you work yourself out of a job,” Hunt said. This year he was able to do just that.\n\nHunt recently joined Google as a Technical Lead and Manager for App Engine, a platform that enables users to more easily create and run applications in the cloud. Customers simply upload their applications and the platform takes care of the rest. App Engine is what current social media favorite, SnapChat, is built on.\n\nIn his new role, Hunt will be able to motivate and inspire his team to create. It’s the type of leadership position he started gravitating towards during his tenure at Exablox.\n\n“It’s not enough to just be the best in your field, individually. You can do things much bigger than yourself if you work in a team,” Hunt said. “Creating and growing Exablox taught me how to translate my technical ability to leadership ability.”\n\nTeam building and teamwork are concepts that have grown with Hunt through an unlikely avenue—rock climbing. An avid and accomplished climber, the lessons learned from his hobby have informed his career in technology as well.\n\n“In rock climbing you need to first trust your partner and second trust the system you’ve built,” Hunt says. “Learning that level of trust helps you to let go and accept the consequences, should it fail.”\n\nHunt has climbed some of the most difficult peaks in nature and in business, and he encourages others to do the same. “Pick something you’re a little bit scared to try. Push your limits and always find something more challenging. You need to be open to, and accept, fear and failing. Use that fear as a tool.”\n\nIt is this mindset that has driven Hunt's success and allowed him to become this year's Distinguished Alumni from the B. Thomas Golisano College of Computing and Information Sciences.\n\nJust about any time you navigate the internet, you encounter John Resig's work, whether you know it or not. John is the creator of the jQuery JavaScript library. He has also contributed to numerous other JavaScript libraries including Processing.js, Env.js, Sizzle.js, and QUnit. He is the author of the books Pro JavaScript Techniques and Secrets of the JavaScript Ninja.\n\nResig has transformed the way that developers look at creating JavaScript for their personal or corporate websites. Leading sites like Google, Microsoft, Apple, Nokia and thousands of others manage and simplify their JavaScript using jQuery. John also contributed to research done at the Center for Discovery Informatics at RIT, primarily in Instant Messaging (Project: IMSCAN). In recognition of the revolutionary and global impact of his work, John was inducted into the first RIT Innovation Hall of Fame in 2010.\n\nJohn is currently the Dean of Computer Science at Khan Academy where he is leading an innovative project, Khan Academy Computer Science, a new platform that targets people with no programming knowledge and gives them an engaging and fun environment to learn in. The program emphasizes creativity and exploration and makes computer science approachable for people of all ages, including young kids.\n\nWhile at RIT, he was a resident of the Computer Science House and was named House Member of the Year during his sophomore year. With concentrations in economics and psychology, he had the opportunity to work with Professor Ankur Teredesai on data mining instant messaging networks and published two papers on the topic. Additionally he worked with Professor Jon Schull on exploring new ways of encouraging real-time online collaboration.\n\nThe opportunities that RIT presented in learning from fellow students in Computer Science House and from collaborating with professors have greatly influenced John's drive to continue learning in his career and beyond. It is not surprising, then, that John is currently pursuing more knowledge, serving as a Visiting Researcher at Ritsumeikan University in Kyoto where he is working on the study of Ukiyo-e (Japanese Woodblock printing), applying his programming expertise to create a comprehensive woodblock print database and image search engine (found at: http://ukiyo-e.org).\n\nKatie Linendoll is an Emmy award-winning TV personality and technology expert, appearing on CNN and the CBS Early Show and regularly contributing her expertise to magazines like People, People Style Watch, Marie Claire, Shape and Fitness.\n\nPrior to working on-air, Linendoll gained behind-the-scenes experience with ESPN and won an Emmy as Associate Producer for SportsCenter. Knowing what a producer wants and what it takes to create a show helped her transition to her new role in front of the camera, where she develops and creates all her own segments. Linendoll also co-hosted the Emmy nominated series, 'We Mean Business' on A&E and has blogged for Dell and Oprah.com. She has also worked on projects with AOL, Gizmodo and HP. She recently agreed to a one year deal with Lincoln and signed as a spokesperson for Polaroid.\n\nWhile the tech world is ever changing, her passion centers on finding and showcasing new, innovative technologies. Recent favorites include robotic lifeguards and new speech software for children with autism. RIT fostered my early passion for technologies. I was challenged and taught programs that were advanced and applicable. The IT New Media program was a perfect fit for me and the biggest benefit was the environment: I learned and absorbed all I could from the brilliant minds that surrounded me every day. Additionally, RIT offered a unique on campus media experience through RIT SportsZone where I learned the ins and outs of TV production. This allowed me to transition into a full time position at ESPN, which then led to my current work for several major networks and national publications. I am grateful for my RIT experience and feel in comparison to other schools, I graduated way ahead of the curve.\n\nCroswell Phillip Chambers began his career with IBM in 1988 and has been with Lexmark since the company's inception in 1991.

Recognized internationally for brilliant design-driven production that is limited only by the imagination, Erin and her firm have forged long standing relationships with proven leaders of the advertising and entertainment industries. Under Erin’s leadership, Sarofsky is well known for creating gorgeous, innovative main title sequences for blockbuster movies and television series, including “Captain America: The Winter Soldier,” “Guardians of the Galaxy,” “The Suicide Squad,” “Doctor Strange,” “Animal Kingdom,” “Shameless” “Community,” “Full Frontal with Samantha Bee,” and many others.\n\nOver time, Erin’s artistry has expanded exponentially in every conceivable way, including in style and medium. Stylistically, she constantly breaks new ground as a live-action director. Recent examples include her mesmerizing macro imagery that sublimely introduces each episode of “Animal Kingdom” and her patent, iconic look brought to life for Jeep’s three-spot Release Your Renegade campaign.

While her early work combined ideologies of feminism and traditional craft objects, her newer work moves beyond the boundaries of traditional studio craft and into the realm of social practice.\n\nSince 1994, Wendy has been creating works inspired by the memory of her childhood growing up as a Japanese-American, her interpretation of her ethnic heritage, and her observations of the Japanese culture, looking in from the outside. Born in La Junta, Colorado, to second-generation Japanese American parents, she has made several pilgrimages to the land of her heritage, Japan. At times reverent of Japan’s craft history and advanced technology, and appalled by Japan’s self-indulgent, materialistic and almost faceless and patriarchal society, Wendy vacillates between creating works that both emulate and satirize that culture.\n\nWendy was awarded an artist-in-residency opportunity at SUNY Purchase in fall 2008 and during this time she immersed herself in research and historical investigation of Executive Order 9066. The Tag Project was born out of this residency.\n\nThe Tag Project was part of a companion body of work, Executive Order 9066, addressing the forced evacuation and incarceration of Japanese Americans in 1942 after the bombing of Pearl Harbor. Her family was directly affected by the evacuation: but little was mentioned of this by Wendy’s mother or grandparents. This chapter in her family history was heavily veiled: because of this, she avoided any association with this connection.\n\nHer latest work, The wildLIFE Project, focuses on the endangerment of elephants, a cause personal to Wendy. She recently took a sojourn to Kenya and met with wildlife advocates to investigate the dangers of the continued poaching of these magnificent animals. The trip served as a source of inspiration for the artist to create a new body of work and incorporate a strong societal message.\n\nWendy has recently retired from teaching at San Diego State University. In addition to SDSU, she has taught at Appalachian Center for Crafts, California College of Arts, and has taught for 35 years all total. She exhibited her work nationally for over four decades, with solo shows in New York City, San Francisco, Scottsdale, Indianapolis, Savannah, and Easthampton. She has exhibited internationally in Tokyo, Seoul, and London. Maruyama’s work can also be found in both national and international permanent museum collections, including the Victoria and Albert Museum, London; Dallas Museum of Art, Dallas; Tennessee State Museum, Nashville; Queen Victoria Museum and Art Gallery, Launceston, Australia; Museum of Fine Arts, Boston; Philadelphia Museum of Art; Museum of Art and Design, New York; Los Angeles County Museum of Art, Los Angeles; Mint Museum of Art, Charlotte; Fuller Craft Museum, Brockton; Mingei International Museum, San Diego; and the Oakland Museum of California.\n\nWendy is a recipient of several prestigious awards, including the California Civil Liberties Public Education Grant, 2010; several National Endowment for the Arts Grants for Visual Artists; the Japan/US Fellowship; and a Fulbright Research Grant to work in the UK.\n\nVice President of Design Innovation, Nike\n\nNike's Vice President of Design Innovation and 2016 CIAS Distinguished Alumni, Eric Avar '90, grew up with a mechanical engineer father and fine artist mother, but did not know a marriage of the two disciplines could exist beyond his parent's union until he came to RIT. “I had no idea what industrial design or product design was before RIT,” Avar said. “Within the first two weeks on campus, I just happened to find my way up to the fourth floor of the design building and was immediately enthralled by this balance of art and science.”\n\nHaving started with the mechanical engineering program, Avar begged to be let into the industrial design program. Despite not having a formal portfolio, rather a collection of drawings his mother sent him in a plastic bag, CIAS faculty saw promise and gave Avar a shot. Starting at Nike in 1991, Avar has helped create some of the company's most innovative and award-winning designs of the past 25 years, including products within the Nike Basketball, Nike Free, Lunar and Kobe Bryant series of footwear. He currently oversees projects in an extension of Nike's Innovation Kitchen.\n\nAvar believes the foundation to his success as a designer is his upbringing and education, which bred his harmony of science, style, and function. He credits RIT's diversity of programs with giving him the necessary skills to “relate, talk, work, and collaborate with anyone.” For other design students who aim to follow in his Nike-adorned footsteps, Avar offers some advice:\n\n“Be a sponge. Go out to the perimeter, go out to the fringes and learn as much as possible. Not in an effort to be an expert at anything, but to embody the spirit of being a sponge, which helps inform design-thinking and the creative problem-solving process.”\n\nRevelers attending the Presidents’ Alumni Ball in the Gordon Field House on campus last fall had the chance to be frozen in time by Robert Latorre’s “Big Freeze” camera array system, just like Hollywood stars making their red carpet entrance to an awards extravaganza.\n\nRobert Latorre grew up in a creative family headed by his sculptor grandfather and jazz musician father. His own creativity flourished in photography. After earning his BS in Commercial Photography from RIT, he began his photography career with the National News and Wire services in New York City as a photojournalist with a global beat. He eventually settled in Texas where he opened Robert Latorre Productions, which grew into Big Fish Films, a successful TV commercial film company in Dallas. Not only is Robert an award-winning commercial photographer, he is also an accomplished director known for his dramatic lighting and innovative directorial approach. ADWEEK chose Latorre Commercial Film Director of the Year and Creative All-Star Photographer twice.\n\nIn 1995, he became fascinated with the frozen moment, and he engineered ways to use this unique look in his commercials. He designed and built his first Big Freeze system which produced a cutting-edge frozen effect, earning him an Emmy nomination and a Clio award for Special Effects.\n\nThe Big Freeze Worldwide is the largest and most advanced camera array system in the world. Now in its 5th generation, the system is completely digital and driven by software. It is unique in its ability to capture, download and playback the frozen effects in stunning HD or 3D, delivering a 360-degree virtual or frozen moment image in seconds to live broadcast or any social media site. It has evolved into PODCAM360, the ultimate photo and movie booth. Entirely visitor activated, the camera system is enclosed in freestanding exhibit walls, lit with fine pixel LEDs depicting any scene imaginable. Within seconds, users can capture a unique, frozen 360° movie of themselves immersed in a scene of their choosing which they can then share instantaneously with the rest of the world.\n\nLatorre and his Big Freeze system were honored at CES 2015 for their collaboration with Nikon. The 360 booth received high praise from participants and the media alike, earning multiple spotlight features from the news media and blogging communities, including TechCrunch, Popular Science and Fox News.\n\nLatorre has one simple philosophy, \"Photography and filmmaking is very much about the inner eye. If you can capture on film what you can see, you can tell a story to everyone who sees it. It's a marrying of science with creativity that allows an artist to really reach that higher level of perception.\"\n\nWith an associate degree in applied science and a Bachelor of Fine Arts in professional photographic illustration from RIT, Kwaku Alston '93, '94 says that RIT prepared him for his career in photography by giving him the discipline to compete. He remembers sitting in Webb Auditorium and being told to look to his left and to his right and understand that these are the people who might someday hire him: A major key to success in business is relationships. Many of those same classmates went on to pursue careers as photo editors and art producers–and many remain his close friends and professional peers.\n\nAlston encourages today's RIT photography students to follow their dreams as well as their hearts, to have the courage to show their work and to have faith in their ability to succeed. He also believes it is important to live a balanced life, making time for family and friends, which are–\"the most important things in life,\" he says. Alston encourages professional equilibrium, balancing the artistic side of photography with the business side and to remember that everyone makes mistakes.\"With as many accolades as I have, there are just as many mistakes that I've made. It's all part of the process.\"\n\nBrooks Bower is chairman and chief executive officer of Papercone Corporation, the largest privately held specialty envelope manufacturer in the U.S. with over 125 employees. He graduated from RIT in 1974 with a Bachelor of Science degree in printing. Bower is deeply involved in philanthropic activities, which include serving on the boards of the Envelope Manufacturers Association and Foundation, Walden School, The Salvation Army Advisory Board and the Kentucky Derby Museum Foundation. Additionally, he is an active member of the Chief Executives' Organization, the World Presidents' Organization and the Young Presidents' Organization The education I received at RIT was second to none; the printing program was world class. In the printing industry, having a degree from RIT was held in high regard. In addition to their strength and credibility as having a top notch printing program, their business classes were excellent. The program at RIT was a very hands-on program and it has led to me being a very hands-on manager and leader within my organization. A lot of executives try to manage their companies from their desk and are far less successful with that approach. I'm forever grateful that RIT gave me the foundation and skills necessary to lead a successful organization... I consider my four years at Rochester Institute of Technology four of the greatest years of my life. I was living 3000 miles from home, far from any family or friends, too far to travel home on weekends or holidays. RIT became a second home for me and helped mold me into the person that I am today. Living on campus helped teach me responsibility and how to live and interact with people. In the years I spent at RIT, I went from a young and naive 18 year old student to a young man ready to take what the world had to throw at me. I grew immensely through the experience. Today, Bower lives in Louisville with his wife, Marilyn. They travel extensively for business and pleasure, especially for snow skiing around the world. The Bowers have two children, five grandchildren and they love animals.\n\nStephen Whittaker credits his degree in printing management for saving his life. After graduating from RIT in 1968, Stephen married his wife Ann, and by fall he was drafted into the US Army and sent to South Vietnam. A chance meeting with an outgoing soldier who needed a replacement pressman secured Stephen a job in a classified printing plant in a combat zone. Sadly, the thirteen other servicemen who arrived the same day were sent to the field and did not return home. After a fourteen month tour, Stephen returned home and was awarded the Bronze Star Medal, Army Commendation Medal and seven other military decorations. More recently, he was presented with the John Peter Zenger Medal for military bravery by the Printing Industry Alliance of N.Y., N.J., and Pa.\n\nMr. Whittaker has worked at Monroe Litho, Inc. in Rochester, New York for the past 26 years where he is currently the Vice President of Quality Management and Sustainability Initiatives. A senior member of the American Society for Quality, he manages and organizes third party external audits for quality and sustainability systems within Monroe Litho, and he is also responsible for the management of the firm's FSC and SFI Certifications. In 2008 Monroe Litho became the fifth commercial printer in the US to earn the Sustainable Green Printing Partnership Certification and the company was recognized as one of the sixteen safest companies in the United States by EHS Magazine.\n\nDedicated to his profession and his community, Mr. Whittaker is an adjunct professor in the School of Print Media, College of Imaging Arts and Sciences at RIT and is also a member of the Rochester Area Business Ethics Foundation, a group that promotes business ethics and recognizes local companies for their exemplary ethical practices. A 33o Scottish Rite Freemason, he serves on the Board of Governors of the Frank and Bette Paul 32oMasonic Learning Center for Children, a non-fee organization that teaches children with dyslexia to read.\n\nPresident, JN White\n\nAfter earning his degree in Packaging Science at RIT, Jason began his career at Diamond Packaging, advancing from co-op to VP of Sales & Marketing. During his tenure at Diamond, Jason received his MBA at the Simon School of Business at the University of Rochester. As a skilled and knowledgeable consultant in asset and stock purchases, Jason has led numerous successful acquisitions with Rochester-based companies.\n\nJason is currently the president of JN White, a manufacturer of complex human machine interfaces founded in 1960, with locations in Perry, N.Y. and Watertown, Conn. Under Jason's leadership, JN White has achieved record-level growth. Also an inventor, Jason was awarded a patent for a single-piece polycarbonate face shield to help protect people during the pandemic.

Born in a sleepy little town named after General Joseph Warren in the heart of the Allegheny National Forest in Northwest Pennsylvania, it was a place that benefited from the post-World War II industrial boom. The collapse of the United States steel industry would come a decade later.\n\nEd’s first recollections of healthcare were that of penicillin and the pain inflicted by the blunt bit end of autoclaved needles, as well as from the orthopedic visits he received monthly in a cold, dark basement of a church where the physicians came to care for his feet at the “Crippled Children’s Center.” It was these experiences that began his quest to “find a better way” in all he pursued.\n\nAfter an exceptional high school education, Ed headed to RIT to pursue chemistry and biotechnology, minoring in philosophy. Eight years of pharmacology research and a master's degree in education and human development from the University of Rochester Warner School followed. Soon after, a unique opportunity presented itself.\n\nIn 1997, shortly after Congress passed the Balanced Budget Act, Rochester's Strong Memorial Hospital was faced with an immediate need to reduce costs. This was Ed's opportunity to use his background in science and technology on reengineering efforts. His team was successful, yet it also led to the department's dismantling. Off he went to rural Home Healthcare and Finger Lakes Visiting Nurse Service (FLVNS) which faced an equally daunting transition from Medicare Fee-for-Service to Medicare Prospective Payment System. Ed made this project the thesis for his master of science in health systems administration from RIT's College of Health Sciences and Technology. The success of this project was easy to measure—while 30% of the nation's 10,000 Medicare Certified Home Health Agencies went out of business—FLVNS did not!\n\nNext, Ed headed to urban Rochester Primary Health Network a Federally Qualified Health Center. It was here he first encountered the “Health Center Movement” which aligned health care with community and a focus on primary preventive care. Eager to apply skills honed, he accepted the invitation of CEO Norrine Williams, to join Ammonoosuc Community Health Services, Inc. (ACHS) in rural New Hampshire In 2005 to become COO transitioning to CEO in 2008 when Norrine retired.\n\nToday, Ed enjoys being part of a team that wrestles with the hard questions facing today’s healthcare. He is a leader in healthcare at a time that is demanding a paradigmatic shift in how we think about individual and population-based health. He works to forge a healthcare paradigm that embraces healthcare as prerequisite to our right of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Together with his team they seek to redefine the funding of healthcare as an investment with a return on investment, and to create support structures for individuals and populations to take accountability for their healthcare choices now and for future generations. The goal is to develop the right interventions, for the right people, at the right time, at the right price; increasing access and decreasing disparities. He believes this is the nexus for investing in healthcare.\n\nEd’s career can best be described as eclectic and circuitous. He continues to be a life-long learner and has had the privilege of mentorship from individuals who have pushed him professionally and personally to pursue excellence. He considers himself a curator of a corporate and clinical culture—where language matters in framing the why, what, and how of our mission. He believes people do not work for him, rather with him, and together for the patient in the process of co-creating optimal individual health and community wellness across the continuum of care and the span of a well lived life experience. This is where his passion lies; in leading the way forward with those of like mind; focusing on primary preventive efforts some of which have yet to be imagined.\n\nSonographer, SUNY Upstate Medical University\n\nLisa M.

After graduating from RIT's physician assistant program, Badillo, born and raised in Brooklyn, returned to the New York City area to treat patients at a men's homeless shelter. “I worked with the chronic homeless,” Badillo said. “These were men that people tried to ignore and stay away from on the subway or in the street. When I treated these men, it was the first time someone had actually touched or even looked at them in a while.” Less than a year after Badillo treated a homeless man in his early 30s, he returned to the shelter almost unrecognizable. “He was dressed in a suit, his hair was short and he was clean shaven. He had just gotten a new job,” Badillo said. “He'd come to thank me for changing his life. He told me I was the first person who had treated him like a human being in a long time.” These patients in turn inspired Badillo to pursue her medical degree at Stanford University so that she could provide underserved populations the best care possible. She is currently a primary care physician in a low-income neighborhood in Queens, serving a diverse population. Badillo credits her education at RIT for allowing her to flourish in her career. “Having gone further in my training as a physician, I realized how outstanding my education as a PA was,” she said. And even though Badillo is an accomplished physician, she still believes that being a doctor is more than just providing medical treatment. “The best part of the job is getting to be the person people turn to when they are in their greatest need. It's an honor and privilege to be that first line when people need you. I get to give them hope.”\n\nDr. Mary Dombovy MS '01 leads an experienced, compassionate team of professionals who provide medical care, rehabilitation, and hope to patients and their families.

A native of Clifton Springs, N.Y., Hartmann arrived at RIT with aspirations of becoming a police officer. The criminal justice major excelled at RIT and his professors encouraged him to pursue a law degree after graduation. “RIT really opened my eyes to education,” Hartmann said. “That, combined with the classroom experience and understanding other people’s points of view, has impacted my entire career.”\n\nAfter law school, Hartmann went on to enjoy a career in the FBI, but recalibrated his plan after 10 years with the bureau to pursue a corporate career, listing business leader and, in time, CEO as objectives. “If you don’t choose to plan, then ultimately you are choosing to have others plan for you. Work your plan in a way that positions you to achieve your goals and aspirations. At the same time, keep your mind open to all the other possibilities and directions you can go.” As president and CEO of True Value, Hartmann now oversees a co-op of 4,500 independently owned hardware stores, providing them with the resources they need to be successful. Under his leadership, True Value has gone on to see its best sales in over 20 years. Hartmann credits this success, and others throughout his varied career, to a simple, yet unexpected, asset. “Listening is more important than talking. Whether you’re in a classroom setting, corporate role or in public service, the skill of listening is an important one for all of us to focus on.”\n\nJeffrey Culver BS '82 (criminal justice) never imagined that his career would take him to where he is now: director of corporate security for the World Bank. Yet as soon as Culver enrolled in RIT's criminal justice program, he knew he was on the right track. He spent 24 years working for the Bureau of Diplomatic Security, the government agency responsible for providing a safe and secure environment for the conduct of U.S. foreign policy throughout the world as well as managing reciprocity and immunity issues for foreign diplomats in the United States.\n\nA member of the Senior Foreign Service with the rank of Minister Counselor, Culver served as Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary and Director of Diplomatic Security from October 2009 until his recent retirement from public service. After many years of service in the public sector, Culver made a change to the private sector. This move has made it possible for him to spend more time with his wife and daughter.\n\nIn his current position at the World Bank, he is responsible for the safety and security of the bank's operations and personnel in Washington, D.C., and in 128 country and regional offices around the world.\n\nDale Dangremond BS ’81 has over 30 years of experience working in the disability field as an advocate, administrator, consultant, systems change agent, and parent of children with neurological disorders. Since 1990, she has worked nationally as an expert consultant on the topics of abuse and neglect, critical incident investigations, and incident/quality management in the disability, eldercare, and juvenile justice fields with federal, state, and local governments, as well as with private organizations through her company, Dangremond Consulting.\n\nHer areas of expertise include design and implementation of processes to prevent harm in human service organizations, and competency-based assessment tools for investigation and incident management process. She also serves as an expert witness and monitor of incident management and critical incident investigation systems in connection with court orders and litigation settlements. She has extensive experience in the field of deafness, including: developing and managing specialized support programs; working as a professional sign language interpreter and faculty in interpreter training programs; and developing and implementing regulation and policy involving protection from harm/incident management, and accessibility/rights issues for individuals with hearing loss.\n\nDangremond has consulted for the Center for Medicaid and Medicare Services on protection from harm issues in the Medicaid Waiver Program and on the \"look behind\" contract assessing ICF/MRs; as an expert with the US Department of Justice, Special Litigation Section/Civil Rights Division on CRIPA investigations; and she has worked for community-based organizations supporting children and adults with disabilities in New York, Colorado, Maryland, Virginia, and Washington, D.C. Prior to forming Dangremond Consulting, she served in a variety of executive management positions at organizations including Labor Relations Alternatives, Inc., the District of Columbia Department of Human Services, Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities Administration (MRDDA), National Children's Center (NCC) and Seneca ARC.\n\nDangremond speaks highly of the impact that both faculty and RIT's unique program structure had on her career: The Social Work program at RIT provided me the challenges and opportunities that helped form the framework for my personal and professional philosophies and values related to advocacy and systems change work in the disability and human service fields. Professors like Marshall Smith, Barbara Kasper, Helen Irving, and Burt Caswell instilled a sense of responsibility of service to others through their teaching and advising. They not only challenged students to think, but to act as well. The relationship between the Social Work Program and NTID, unlike any other at the time, provided a unique opportunity for me to explore and develop my interests and professional skills in deaf culture and sign language. The RIT experience created the foundation of knowledge that opened the doors for my professional endeavors and led me to this stage of my career. For that, I am especially grateful. In addition to earning her bachelor’s degree in Social Work from RIT's College of Liberal Arts, she also holds a Certificate from NTID's Interpreter Training Program, and earned her master's in Business Administration from University of Phoenix. Dangremond lives in Wellington, FL, with her husband, Bill, and sons Zack and Will.\n\nIrene Jacobs BS ’78 is committed to creating a world where all children have the opportunity to achieve their full potential. She attests that her RIT education provided her with the knowledge about how to be a change agent in the world and taught her the value of laughter and light-heartedness in the face of dealing with challenging social problems such as poverty and injustice.\n\nSince March of 2009, she has served as a consultant for government, philanthropy, and non-profit organizations. Her clients include the W.K. Kellogg Foundation, University of Arizona and First Things First, Arizona's early childhood development and health organization. Previously, Irene served on Arizona Governor Janet Napolitano's Executive Team as Senior Policy Advisor and Director of the Office of Children, Youth & Families, overseeing eight divisions in the governor's office that served the community on the issues of early childhood education, substance abuse prevention and treatment, youth development, juvenile justice, domestic violence, women and children's health, finance and community relations.\n\nMs. Jacobs believes that the optimum time to positively impact a child's success is during the first years of life. She has put her belief into action through her work as director of the State School Readiness Board, serving from 2003 until she was promoted to Senior Policy Advisor in 2006. The board's work guided the Governor's actions pertaining to early education and laid a foundation for First Things First. Ms. Jacobs serves on the Board of Directors of Educare of Arizona, United Healthcare Children's Foundation, and the Clothes Helping Kids Foundation. Prior to her transition to consulting, she served on the boards of the Arizona Early Education Funds, Arizona Grantmaker's Forum, Interagency Council on Homelessness and Arizonan Substance Abuse Partnership.\n\nPresident and CEO, Central Electric Power Cooperative\n\nRobert C. Hochstetler MS’04 was raised in Southern Indiana. He received a master’s in statistics from RIT in May 2004 while living in Victor, N.Y., and working at Kodak Park. Rob graduated from Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology in 1991 with an electrical engineering degree. He began his career in the power industry at a power plant in his hometown of Terre Haute, Indiana. As he began his career as an engineer, Rob quickly realized that he had many great ideas to improve operations at the plant, but he struggled to get funding for projects because, as he puts it, “I just didn’t know how to speak the language of finance.” This led to more school and him receiving an MBA from Indiana State in 1995. He parlayed this degree and his leadership abilities into numerous positions for the power company before arriving in Rochester with his wife and two daughters. While in New York, the Hochstetler’s became foster parents to numerous children and ultimately adopted a son. It was during this period, Rob attended RIT in the late afternoon and evening. When asked why he wanted to study statistics at the beginning of this century he replied, “This was right at the time storing data was becoming inexpensive and I knew our world was going to be able to use data to make decisions closer to real-time. RIT and the degree have not let me down and decades later, I find myself using the theories and lessons almost every day.”\n\nRob parlayed his degree to a new position at the power company’s corporate office in Cincinnati to manage risk on an energy trading floor. From here Rob was recruited back to Indiana to work for the electric cooperatives of the state. While at Hoosier Energy, Rob had a vision of a new strategy in the industry and again returned to school in the evening to receive a master’s degree in strategic management from Indiana University in 2012. He used this degree to begin transitioning the organization into a more sustainable future. While in Bloomington, the Hochstetlers brought two more older children into their family.\n\nIn 2014, Mr. Hochstetler was named president and CEO of Central Electric Power Cooperative in Columbia South Carolina. Central has annual revenue approaching $1.5 billion per year and through the twenty cooperatives of South Carolina provide competitively priced power to nearly two million citizens of the state. Rob and his wife Linda reside in Chapin South Carolina with their children residing in London, San Clemente, California, Richmond, Virginia, South Carolina, and the youngest in school at Clemson.\n\nSenior Vice President of Marketplace Strategy\n\nFidelity Investments\n\nSue Gordona BS ’94 is a leader with over 25 years of experience delivering innovative solutions and value to customers and leading diverse teams of highly engaged employees.

He is a subject matter expert for satellite ground processing systems and flight and ground software development and acquisitions.\n\nVice President, Cargill, Inc.\n\nChemistry was something that Eric Kuckhoff MS ’84 knew well. It wasn’t just the science behind polymers and reaction rates that the 2016 Distinguished Alumni from the College Science and president of the Alumni Association has mastered, but the delicate chemistry of business as well. In 2002, Kuckhoff started his own company, Polystar LLC. The industrial chemicals manufacturer grew quickly from nothing to $50 million in just ten years. He is currently vice president and general manager for North America at Cargill, Inc., who acquired Polystar, in the industrial specialties group. Kuckhoff was honored during the Distinguished Alumni Dinner and Awards Celebration in April 2016, in part because of his achievements as an entrepreneur and his contribution to RIT. As with the chemical compounds he works with, Kuckhoff combined various elements to reach success. He began his career at The Dow Chemical Company and then Cytec Industries, both large, multi-billion dollar companies. Kuckhoff thrived by listening to his customers and responding to their needs, but he saw gaps in these large organizations. It was his innate desire to find solutions that led Kuckhoff to create and grow Polystar. “There were so many missed opportunities,” Kuckhoff said. “What mattered to me was solving customer problems and creating an organization that could solve these problems, while doing it faster and better than the competitors.”\n\nThe relationships Kuckhoff forged during the early part of his career were also instrumental in Polystar’s creation. The most striking example of this for Kuckhoff is the friendship with a former Cytec customer, which led to an introduction to the business partner who helped him start Polystar. “The people around you ultimately come back around in ways that are hard to imagine,” Kuckhoff said. “You can never understate the value of relationships and hard work. Every now and then, you are going to have a brilliant person with a difficult personality who is successful despite themselves, but generally it is somebody who has the ability to form and keep relationships while delivering value.”\n\nAnother surprising element to Kuckhoff’s success—mistakes—some which he feels fortunate to have made and learned from before Polystar. “If you really want to be an entrepreneur, learn how to run a business from someone who already knows how to run a business. The real lessons are very subtle and not always obvious.”\n\nA noted scientist, award-winning educator, and respected leader, Dr. Karen Kashmanian Oates BS ’81, MS ’82 is a professor of Biochemistry and the Peterson Family Dean of Arts & Sciences at Worcester Polytechnic Institute.
