        "text": "Elan, the Irish drug company, announced yesterday that testing of its Alzheimer’s treatment was stopped. This drug failure was a surprise to the Street, and Elan’s stock is down approximately 7% intraday today.\n\nThe story of Elan’s history of pipeline disappointments is a cautionary one for companies that over-promise and investors who are too often caught up in the excitement around pipeline drugs and their potential to transform a company, rather than looking at value. Elan’s pipeline and its stock have been like a rollercoaster of hype and disappointment.\n\nEleven years ago, Elan was a Wall Street king of a stock – it was over $60, having doubled in the previous two years. And as every king wants a castle, Elan did too. Yes, the Irish drug company Elan had bought a castle near its headquarters so that visiting executives and important investors would have a place to stay.\n\nAt that time I was a Wall Street analyst and put out a series of reports critical of Elan's accounting, its off balance sheet vehicles, and its pipeline. Following these reports and press coverage, the SEC investigated the company, the off balance sheet vehicles were unwound, a clearer and less positive understanding of the company’s finances emerged. The CEO and CFO stepped down. And the stock dropped.\n\nIn the year following the financial scandal surrounding Elan’s off balance sheet vehicles, the stock dropped from about $60 to under $2.\n\nElan’s stock would never recover from the scandal. The stock would see dramatic rallies and severe drops - in 2005, the stock was $3. On the hype of Alzheimer’s data, three years later in 2008 it was $35. When the data came out, the stock dropped from $35 to $6.\n\nIn 2011, the stock was $3, and rose to $15 this year again on the hopes of the Alzheimer’s data release. In the past month, it has dropped 30%.\n\nThese dramatic moves are not typical of stock but reflects a company where investor enthusiasm gets out of hand.\n\nAlzheimers Program - Doubts A Decade Ago\n\nOn the Alzheimer’s program, even 11 years ago, I issued a bold challenge to all other sell-side analysts who were supporting Elan’s stock at the time, offering to bet anyone $1,000 that the Alzheimer’s drug that Elan was working on would never work. [for an interesting background on this controversy, see: http://bit.ly/N9DPSF ]\n\nDespite almost all of the analysts of them having high hopes for such a drug, and many of them putting the product in their models, not one of the analysts took me up on the bet.\n\nYesterday, we found out who was right. Elan and its partners announced that bapineuzumab failed its Phase III study.\n\nMany investors that will point to the study design or some obscure thing that “if they had just done this, then it would have worked.” My answer to you is that it wouldn’t have made a difference at all. I believe the thesis and the approach is completely wrong. I do not suspect you will see yet another try by any one of the companies using the Elan approach.\n\nThe Bigger Picture\n\nBut the failure of Elan’s bapineuzumab should be looked at through a longer lens of Elan’s disappointing R&D history. Elan’s R&D pipeline has even seen programs go backwards in development and disappear completely from their pipeline charts with no explanation. Repeatedly, investors have been fooled by a series of Elan R&D programs that were promoted and repeatedly, investors have been burned.\n\nThe Alzheimer’s program is a good example of this. From the beginning, in March 1996, with the acquisition of Athena Neurosciences, Elan has been barking up the wrong tree. Elan acquired Athena for $625 million in stock – Elan’s stock at the time was $60.50. What at the time the Irish drug delivery company knew about Alzheimer’s research still remains a mystery – how did they know enough to analyze the attractiveness of the science? I would argue they didn’t.\n\nAt the time, Elan was just starting a series of acquisitions in the hopes of buying its way to becoming a fully integrated research-driven pharmaceutical company – an effort that would end up costing the company billions and resulting in one of the greatest declines in market value of any healthcare stock.\n\nTwo year later, in 1998, with Elan at $59, Elan acquired Neurex, a pain company for $700m –a 52% premium. The CEO of the company, would tout ziconotide, a pain drug in development for the next several years as a large market opportunity. Of course, the drug would turn out to be a commercial and clinical dud, divested a few years after approval.\n\nElan then acquired Dura Pharmaceuticals in 2000, spending $1.8 billion for Dura so it could have access to the hyped Spiros pipeline of inhalable drugs that were in development to revolutionize asthma treatment. Not one of the Spiros programs were ever developed. Dura had its own history similar to Elan [a lawsuit filed years ago is juicy reading http://bit.ly/Qcjb1i ]\n\nThe rising debt of Elan as a result of serial acquisitions during the period may have been the reason it turned to off-balance sheet financings as a way to finance the rising R&D spend.\n\nOver the years, very few of the drugs that appeared in Elan’s pipeline ever were the commercial successes that were hoped for. As a serial acquirer, Elan paid tens of millions to the Street in fees – perhaps this is why so many analysts refused to go against them.\n\nAfter The Mess aka The More Things Change...\n\nOver the years, Elan brought in new management and much of the problems of years ago, were addressed. The finances were easier to understand for the average investor. Disclosure was better. And management more focused. However, to me, the Elan culture and its problems never really changed too dramatically over time despite changes in management.\n\nThere are several examples, such as the first set of Alzheimer's data that was released a few years ago. Ahead of this data, the stock soared to $35, jumping significantly in the days ahead of its release. Several institutional investors indicated to me that they still blame management for baseless rise (and subsequent collapse when the data was actually discouraging) in the shares.\n\nMore recently, in May 2011, Elan issued a press release announced it was making a $20 million investment in a Proteostasis Therapeutics and Elan was to invest another $30 million in R&D funding for some promising compounds. Proteostasis also issued a press release.\n\nAt the time, Kelly Martin, Chief Executive Officer of Elan, stated in the press release:\n\n“This initiative with Proteostasis reinforces our commitment and strategic business objective of being an exceptionally high-caliber, science-driven company and provides a multitude of opportunities for Elan to advance its position as a world leader in the broad field of neuroscience. Importantly, and given the construct of the deal as a capital investment, this transaction is being consummated in a manner that will have a minimal near-term financial impact on our income statement…”\n\nJust this past quarter and only a year after it was announced, Elan and Proteostasis terminated their strategic alliance. Elan mentions it in their 2Q results press release with no explanation.\n\nAlthough this is a small transaction, it matters to me for two reasons – transparency and financial treatment of cash. First, from a transparency standpoint, if the deal was important enough to announce when it was formed, I believe that a company should make investors aware when it is killed in the same manner you made them aware of its formation. For the investor that might have bought the stock when it was announced because they were so excited about the news, companies owe it to them to tell them that it ended and why.\n\nFrom a financial standpoint, it is important to note that Elan’s CEO’s said the deal construction was important as since it was a capital deal, it would not impact the reported expenses in the Income Statement. I hate when companies try to make a point that balance sheet cash is somehow less precious than income statement cash. If you want to set up your R&D spending as investments to avoid them being included on your R&D line, I consider it as you are trying to make investors think you are more profitable than you are. A smart investor will look at serial acquisitions and deals like this and add them to the R&D line. In other words, you are not fooling anyone.\n\nDon't Give Away Money If You Are Not Making Any\n\nSince Elan is not reporting a profit yet, Elan hopes now is to minimize its spending and try to be profitable. They better try harder because to me, they spend money like they are big pharma in 1980’s.\n\nJust last month Elan announced it donated €3.17 million (about $4 million) to University College of Dublin for scholarships in the Business of Biotechnology area to fund the Laurence Crowley 'Business of Biotechnology' lecture series.\n\nThere is something funny about a company that is trying to save money and become consistently profitable for its first time in 15 years giving its money away, let along to a speaker series named for one of their former Board members who is an alum. I have no issue with alums wanting to give money to their alma mater, but please don’t give shareholder’s money away.\n\nSome will say it is part of being a good corporate citizen, but I think is a luxury best reserved for those companies making money in my opinion.\n\nThe Balance Sheet\n\nWhen I look at Elan’s balance sheet, I do not see a company that should be giving away millions so freely. Elan has as of June 30, Elan has about $1 of cash per share. However, net of liabilities and debt this falls below $1 per share.\n\nBut Elan does have one powerful thing in its corner – Tysabri, a product that generated $576 million for Elan in the first six months of 2012 – it should hit $1.2 billion this year. Tysabri is doing great, however due to the deals Elan struck with partners, it carries a lower gross margin than most brand drugs – thus Elan’s challenge to be profitable despite having a blockbuster on its hands. With nearly 600 million shares outstanding, many of them issued over the years where Elan was a serial acquirer buying companies and products that never lived up to their billing, Elan will need to make a lot of changes to generate sizable profits on a per share basis.\n\nFor that, they might need a lot more than just a little luck of the Irish.\n\n______________________\n\nNo part of this post should be construed as investment advice as advice is neither intended or implied."
