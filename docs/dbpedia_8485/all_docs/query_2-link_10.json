        "text": "Don Gutteridge\n\nThe Joplin Globe, September 7, 2008\n\nPITTSBURG, Kan. (AP)  Don Gutteridge, who played for four major league teams and managed the Chicago White Sox in 1969 and 1970, has died. He was 96.\n\nHe died at his home Sunday, after contracting pneumonia about a month ago, son Don Gutteridge Jr. said.\n\nGutteridge spent 12 years in the majors and debuted with the St. Louis Cardinals on Sept. 7, 1936, 72 years to the day before his death. He also played with the St. Louis Browns, Pittsburgh Pirates and Boston Red Sox.\n\nHe was listed as the seventh-oldest living former player and was the last living St. Louis Brown who played in the 1944 World Series. During that series, he turned five double plays in one game at second base. For his career, he batted .256, playing second and third base. He had 39 home runs and 391 RBIs.\n\nHe later was a scout for the Kansas City Royals, the New York Yankees and the Los Angeles Dodgers.\n\nDon Joseph Gutteridge Sr.\n\n(Died September 7, 2008)\n\nDon Joseph Gutteridge Sr., 96, of Pittsburg, Kansas, went to be with the Lord Jesus Christ on September 7, 2008, due to complications arising from pneumonia.\n\nDon died peacefully at his home surrounded by friends and family. Don accepted Jesus Christ as lord and Savior at a very young age in Pittsburg, Kansas and began a lifelong walk with Him that was evident in all his relationships and actions for the rest of his life.\n\nBorn June 19, 1912 in Pittsburg, Kansas, he never called any other city home. His first and foremost love was his beautiful bride Helen Frances whom he married on October 16, 1931. The only other goal he had was to be a big league baseball player and that he accomplished in a huge way!\n\nDon Gutteridge was a member of the rough-and-tumble Gas House Gang Cardinals from 1936-1940 and logged four more years with the Browns from 1942-1945, spending his most productive years in St. Louis.\n\nThe third baseman registered career highs in triples (15), home runs (9), and RBI (64) in 1938. That same season, Don was named the fastest man in the National League and over his career, ranked in the top 20 in the league in triples and stolen bases four times.\n\nAfter leaving the Redbirds, Don led off the 1944 World Series for the Browns from the second base position as they fell to Billy Southworths Cardinals in the Streetcar Series. He posted career highs in doubles (35) in 1943 and stolen bases (20) as a Brown in 1944. Don played for the Boston Red Sox in the 1946 World Series against the Cardinals. He went 2-for-5 with an RBI as he covered for future Hall-of-Famer Bobby Doerr, who missed Game Six with a migraine. Don was sold to the Pirates in March 1948, where he ended his 12 years in the majors.\n\nOverall, he logged a .256 career batting average and .956 fielding percentage, primarily as a second and third baseman. He scored 586 runs and had 200 doubles, 64 triples, 39 home runs, and 391 RBI over 4202 career at-bats.\n\nAfter managing in the minor leagues and coaching third base for the White Sox for years under Al Lopez, Don managed the Chicago White Sox in 1969 and 1970. He later was a scout for the Kansas City Royals, the New York Yankees, and the Los Angeles Dodgers.\n\nAfter his retirement, Don took an interest in youth baseball in his hometown. The J L Hutchinson League last week renamed the intermediate league (ages 13-15) the Don Gutteridge League.\n\nRecently, Don and longtime friend Todd Biggs wrote the book Getting Started in Baseball: A Guide to Learning and Teaching Baseball in the Early Years. He and Mr. Biggs handed out free copies to every player in the J L Hutchinson League during the summer season. Don had a positive impact on every single person he ever met, Mr. Biggs told The Morning Sun in Pittsburg. No matter how long your conversation is, whenever you left his company, you always felt better about yourself.\n\nWhat Don Gutteridge leaves behind is a legacy of character, love, and hope. His motto was Kill em with kindness. He is preceded in death by his father, Joe Gutteridge and mother, Mary (Archer), two brothers, Alfred and Earl Gutteridge, and one sister Hazel Gutteridge.\n\nDon is survived by one brother Merle Gutteridge and his wife Maxine of Pittsburg, one son, Don Jr. Gutteridge and his wife Sonja of Oklahoma City, OK. Three grandsons; Lance Gutteridge and his wife Amy with their boys Christian, Don Joseph the 3rd, and Carder, Sean Gutteridge and his wife Rene and their children John and Cate, and Joshua Gutteridge and his wife Cheri and their girls, Abigail, Ashley, Allison, and Audrey.\n\nWhile we acknowledge that the world is not quite as sweet without our Husband, Brother, Dad, Paw Paw, and Friend, we know that he is with his Lord and Savior Jesus Christ Celebrating! We miss him, but celebrate his life!\n\nA memorial service for Mr. Gutteridge is set for 2:00 p.m., Tuesday, September 16, 2008, at the Pittsburg Memorial Auditorium, Pittsburg, KS, with Pastors Lance and Joshua Gutteridge officiating. The family suggests memorials to the Community Foundation of Southeast Kansas for the J. L. Hutchinson Baseball League. These may be left at or mailed to the Brenner Mortuary, 114 E. 4th St., Pittsburg, KS 66762.\n\nFriends may sign the register book and leave condolences online at www.brennermortuary.com.\n\nArrangements are under the direction of the Brenner Mortuary, Pittsburg."
