        "text": "For obvious reasons, the Brooklyn Dodgers from the years of 1947-1957 get credit for being the top Dodgers teams of all time. It is understandable, that the integrated Dodgers, led by Jackie Robinson, Roy Campanella, Don Newcombe, and Jim Gilliam, were also the most complete and deepest Dodgers clubs in the history of the franchise. Those teams also had the benefits of 2022 Baseball Hall of Famer Gil Hodges, one of the greatest players in the era Duke Snider, in addition to Pee Wee Reese and many others. For all these reasons, it is easy to miss out on talking about some other Dodgers teams that are easier to forget.\n\nIn 1941, the Dodgers won the National League Pennant. Led by NL MVP Dolph Camilli, eventual Hall of Fame second baseman Billy Herman, and an outfield which consisted of .300 hitters Dixie Walker, Pete Reiser, and Hall of Famer Joe \"Ducky\" Medwick. Catcher Mickey Owen failed to catch a pivotal strike three that would have won Game Four of the 1941 World Series and the Dodgers never caught up, losing to the New York Yankees in five games.\n\nThe fact that baseball as a whole had not yet integrated provides an understandable reason that the Dodgers teams prior to 1947 are not discussed. The Dodgers won three pennants during the decade of the 1940's as only the St. Louis Cardinals won more (four), (The Cincinnati Reds won the pennant in 1940, the Chicago Cubs in 1945, and the Boston Braves in 1948.) I spent a little time looking over the 1945 team in particular, the team that finished in third place in the National League behind the 1942, 1943, and 1944 NL Champion Cardinals and the 1945 National League Champion Cubs. The Dodgers finished eleven games out of first in 1945, enjoying a brief 20 day stretch where they were in first place from June 17th- July 7th. I am going to attempt to interest you with some players of reference on the 1945 Dodgers. Please let me know if I have intrigued you enough.\n\nThe starting catcher on the team was Mike Sandlock, leading a group of seven (7) catchers to suit up that season for the Dodgers with 80 games played. Sandlock would later gain a little bit of fame for being the game's oldest living player before passing away in 2016 at the age of 100. Others to get some pt (playing time) at the position were Johnny Peacock (48 games played), Fats Dantonio (47), Owen (24), Stan Andrews (21), 43 year old Clyde Sukeforth (18), and 41 year old Ray Hayworth (2).\n\nThe Dodgers infield was 75% composed of players named in David Frishberg's \"Van Lingle Mungo,\" one of the best baseball songs of all time.\n\nAugie Galan was the starting first baseman, playing in 152 games, also hitting .307 with 9 home runs, 91 runs batted in, 114 runs scored and a 141 OPS+. Galan finished off his third straight solid season for Brooklyn, the previous two starting in centerfield and left field, respectively. The starting shortstop was Eddie Basinski, who played in a career high 108 games that season and hit .262. Basinski was the last player to pass away that was mentioned in Frishberg's song (2022), Frishberg himself passed in 2021. Third baseman Frenchy Bordagaray played in 114 games and hit .256. The only notable holdover was Eddie Stanky, the starting second baseman acquired the previous season from the Cubs. Stanky led the National League in runs scored (128) and walks (148). Pee Wee Reese spent the last of his three seasons serving in the US Military, returning to his full-time role as the starting shortstop in 1946.\n\nThe outfield was led by Dixie Walker, who hit .300, driving in 124 runs, scoring 102 more, and hit 42 doubles. Luis Olmo also had a banner year for the Dodgers, driving in 110 runs and leading the league with his 13 triples. The center fielder was Goody Rosen, who also had his best season. Rosen hit .325, had 197 hits, scored 126 runs, and had 234 doubles, 11 triples, 12 home runs, and drove in 75 runs.\n\n20-year-old Ed Stevens got into 52 games, primarily at first base for the Dodgers in 1945. Stevens was being groomed to be the starting first baseman for Brooklyn, likely scheduled to be the starter in 1947. The Dodgers changed their mind once Jackie Robinson dominated the minor leagues in 1946, leading the Dodgers to carve out a place at first base for him the next season. Stevens had a good season in Triple-A in 1947, hitting .290, 27, 108 before he was sold to the Pittsburgh Pirates after the season.\n\nOn April 18th, the Dodgers played a game against the Philadelphia Phillies. Manager Leo Durocher started his second straight game at second base. Sukeforth, who was serving as a part time player, like others helping out because so many MLB players were serving in World War II, pinch hit in this game even though he had already become a coach and scout as early as 1943. Sukeforth played in games for the first time in over eleven (11) years. Former Yankees outfielder Ben Chapman, by this time a pitcher, started the game for the Dodgers. Chapman would later gain infamy while serving as the Philadelphia Phillies manager for his racist taunts directed at Robinson during a game in 1947. Babe Herman also returned to the field after a long absence, getting into 37 games mostly as a pinch hitter at age 42, having not appeared in a MLB game since 1937.\n\nThe Dodgers \"closer\" that season was Cy Buker, a 27 year old who pitched in his only big league season in 1945. Reportedly because of a salary dispute, Buker was sent to the minors in 1946 and never made it back to the big leagues. He led the Dodgers with five (5) saves. 21 year old Clyde King was an important reliever for the Dodgers that season. King would later manage in the major leagues for the San Francisco Giants (1969-1970), Atlanta Braves (1974-1975) and Yankees (1982).\n\nThe 1945 Brooklyn Dodgers provided a nice baseball history lesson, if nothing else. I hope you enjoyed the recap of some of the players that made this season interesting. Please let me know if you would be interested in reading similar recaps of random MLB seasons for particular teams that are not often discussed.\n\nJeff Innis, a middle reliever for the New York Mets from the years of 1987-1993, passed away on January 30, 2022, at the age of 59 after a battle with cancer. During the years of 1991-1993, Innis pitched in 69, 73, and 67 games, respectively, leading the team in appearances each season. Overall, He pitched to a 3.05 ERA, 3.71 FIP, and a 1.272 WHIP over the course of his seven MLB seasons. It is easy to remember Innis as a submarine throwing right hand pitcher during a time when there were not too many that used that type of arm slot.\n\nIn fact, it really was Kent Tekulve who brought back the nearly underhanded delivery, something that was very prominent in early baseball and through the 20th century. In fact, when baseball was in its infancy, pitchers were actually required to throw the ball underhand and were penalized if they threw a pitch overhand. The underhand pitching rule, which lasted through 1883 stated, \"The ball must be pitched, not thrown, for the bat.\" \"Pitched\", in the traditional sense of the term: a stiff, underhanded motion, almost like bowling.\"\n\nOnce pitchers got the hang of throwing the ball overhand, and once it was legalized, there was little benefit in a pitcher throwing the ball sidearm. Several years went by before anybody pitched exclusively as a sidearm pitcher. Some underliers included Dick Hyde and Russ Christopher, among others. Pitchers like the before mentioned Tekulve, Dan Quisenberry, and Gene Garber had a lot of success in the 1970's and 1980's throwing sidearm.\n\nThe Mets had Terry Leach as well, a sidearm pitcher who pitched with the Mets in 1981 and 1982, then again for the team from 1985-1990. Leach, on many occasions, was used as a starting pitcher making 18 of his 176 appearances as a starting pitcher, three of them complete game shutouts.\n\nThe Mets of 1987 had a lot of things go wrong for them, the least of whom the hangover from winning the World Series the previous season. Dwight Gooden missed the start of the season due to being forced to enter a rehab center to avoid suspension after testing positive for the use cocaine. Injuries to Bob Ojeda and Rick Aguilera as well as an injury that cost Sid Fernandez 18 days led the Mets to use multiple starting pitchers during the 1987 baseball season. The Mets used twelve starters that season, seven of whom made at least twelve starts for the team. The Mets made a March 27th trade with the Royals to acquire David Cone, a May 11th deal for Indians pitcher Don Schulze, then a September 15th trade for Angels left-handed pitcher John Candelaria.\n\n​On May 26, 1987, the Mets were set to play the San Francisco Giants during the first leg of their three team, West Coast trip. A day before, the Mets won the opener of the series 8-7 over the Giants in a game started by John Mitchell, who at the time, was only the sixth different starting pitcher for the Mets that season. Gooden had not yet started a game and Bob Ojeda was already on the Disabled List (now referred to as the Injured List). Sid Fernandez was in the process of skipping a start due to an unknown ailment. The Mets would call on a relief pitcher who had only made two appearances in the big leagues to make the spot start.\n\nJeff Innis would give the Mets as much, if not more, than they could have imagined as he pitched four innings, giving up just two runs, seven hits with three strikeouts while giving up a solo home run to Will Clark. The Giants led the game 2-1 going into the top of the eighth inning. Jeff Robinson was pitching for the Giants in his second inning of relief. He gave up a single to Keith Hernandez before walking Darryl Strawberry to start the inning. After a Mookie Wilson infield single loaded the bases, Giants manager Roger Craig (himself a former Mets pitcher) went to ace reliever Scott Garrelts, who promptly threw a wild pitch allowing the tying run to score and moving the other two runners into scoring position. Garrelts struck out Howard Johnson and Barry Lyons before uncorking another wild pitch to score Strawberry to give the Mets a 3-2 lead. After striking out Rafael Santana, the box score would make it seem as if the Giants relief ace did his job by striking out all three batters he faced. The two wild pitches turned out to be the difference in the game as the Mets held on for a 3-2 victory with Jesse Orosco pitching the ninth to earn the save for Doug Sisk, who pitched the eighth inning. For the record, Randy Myers pitched scoreless fifth and sixth innings for a Mets bullpen who kept the Giants off the board for all four innings they were in the game.\n\nInnis' next 285 appearances for the Mets would all come in relief, the last of whom was on October 3, 1993. He pitched in the minors for the Twins, Padres, and Phillies before walking away from the game after the 1995 season.He should have earned some more big-league time during the 1987-1990, earning 14 wins and 38 saves in 128 appearances while pitching for the Triple- A Tidewater Tides. The Mets had a deep bullpen for the majority of those seasons, and it was tough for Innis to get a lot of big-league work. Plus, I bet the Mets felt Innis as a side arming pitcher was redundant since they already had Leach in the bullpen. Innis' start in 1987 was the only one he ever made as a professional pitcher.\n\nFor the heck of it, here is a list of some other post 1980 side arming pitchers-\n\nMark Eichhorn\n\nSteve Olin (RIP)\n\nSteve Reed\n\nBob Long\n\nBrad Clontz\n\nMike Myers\n\nChad Bradford\n\nMike Venafro\n\nByung-Hung Kim\n\nKelly Wunsch\n\nEddie Oropesa\n\nBret Prinz\n\nBrad Ziegler\n\nAdam Cimber\n\nTyler Rogers\n\nBen Rowen.\n\n​Any more not mentioned, please add to the comment section.\n\nIn 1987, the Baseball Hall of Fame added a valuable and perhaps underrated outfielder. Billy Williams played in the shadows of Ernie Banks with the Chicago Cubs and because of that, did not get much of the national credit he deserved. The ,290 career hitter with over 400 home runs, over 2700 hits, and six all-star selections spent all but his last two seasons in the windy city. Injuries led to his trade to the Oakland Athletics where he finished his career as a designated hitter in 1975 and 1976.\n\nWhat if I told you there was another Billy Williams that played in the major leagues, but only had ten at bats and did not record a hit? I bet one could envision that- a player that happened to have that same name, not the most uncommon name in the history of names. I am also sure the expectation would be that the latter Williams' MLB cup of coffee would be the end of the story.\n\nWilliam Williams was the latter Billy Williams' birthname and he was born in Newberry, South Carolina. He made his professional baseball debut in the Mountain States League in 1950. This was the second version of the Mountain States League, the first one lasted just two seasons in 1911 and 1912, This version started in 1948 and ran through 1954. Williams hit .270 with six home runs in 95 games in 1950 before a breakout 1951 season saw him hit ,344 with a ,991 on base plus slugging where he also scored 134 runs and drove in 140 runs.\n\nThis season piqued the interest of the Cleveland Indians, who signed the then 22-year-old outfielder. Billy would spend the next six seasons bouncing around to and from B and C levels in the Cleveland organization. While putting up consistent numbers, Williams never got a chance to play in the big leagues. He had a breakout season in 1958 playing for the Minot Mallards of the Northern League, when he hit.330 with a .944 OPS with 14 triples, 13 home runs, 102 runs batted in and 21 stolen bases.\n\nHe followed that up with a couple solid, but not all-star level seasons. In 1959, he hit .286 with a .767 OPS, 10 triples, 7 home runs and 93 RBI before playing for the Cleveland A level team in 1960 where he hit .284 with a .779 OPS, 17 home runs and 96 RBI. He remained a regular at the Triple- A level for the next six seasons, still not getting a call-up to the big club. He was finally emancipated from the Indians organization after the 1967 season and fourteen (14) seasons playing in the minor leagues! He would split the 1968 season between the Hawaii Islanders of the Chicago White Sox organization and the Seattle Angels of the California Angels club and had a respectable, but not eye catching, showing in about 100 games. A year later, he played for the Vancouver Mounties in the expansion Montreal Expos organization and hit .283 with 7 home runs and 79 RBI.\n\nSeemingly just out of the blue, Williams found himself called up to the Major Leagues in August of 1969 by the expansion Seattle Pilots. Perhaps scouts had seen something during his brief time in Seattle in 1968. Baseball reference has a vague transaction history stating that he went back and forth between the Pilots and Chicago White Sox franchises, but nothing really explains how he ended up on the Seattle Pilots' roster. He made his MLB debut on August 15, aged 37 years and 63 days. As stated earlier, Williams did not get a hit in ten at bats, however he did score a run when he was hit by a pitch and scored on a double by Tommy Davis.\n\nWilliams would not play in another professional game after 1969. He would then embark on a career in business as the owner of the Billy Williams' Men's Boutique in Oakland, California. He joined John McNamara's MLB coaching staff in 1990 with the Indians, finally getting to wear the uniform he had earned to wear after spending 14 seasons in their minor league system. He coached for many minor league baseball teams through his seventies, even serving as the interim manager of the Sioux City Explorers in 2005. Williams passed away on June 11, 2013, just two days shy of his 81st birthday.\n\nOne of my favorite baseball movies of all time is Major League. To me, it is a perfect combination of plot, central characters- all of whom with roles relatable to everybody watching the movie- all the way to the buildup and conclusion of the movie. Its success was obvious and Major League was followed up with a sequel. While most of the main characters returned for the second movie, a few new ones were introduced. Catchers Jack Parkman and Rube Baker, Taka Tanaka, and a starting pitcher with the last name of Schoup.\n\nThe latter was played by former MLB relief pitcher Kevin Hickey, who sadly passed away on February 25, 2012. Though Hickey pitched six seasons in the big leagues with the Chicago White Sox and Baltimore Orioles, his path to the show was unorthodox, to say the least. Hickey went to Kelly High School, in Chicago, and was not scouted while he played baseball. In fact, he played very little baseball at all in high school. He did not go to college. It is safe to say, if it wasn't for legendary Chicago White Sox owner Bill Veeck, Hickey would have never gotten an opportunity to play at any level of professional baseball. See, it was Veeck who held an annual tryout giving amateur players an opportunity each spring to get discovered. On only few occasions would any of the players at the tryout stand out enough to get a contract offer from Mr. Veeck to play for the White Sox organization,\n\nHickey played semi-pro softball, almost at a pick-up level, during his free time while he worked on a steel mill. It was at the behest of his collogues that he decided to attend this tryout. Though Hickey did not have an overpowering fastball, his location and ability to get hitters out impressed those scouting the players. Defying the odds, Hickey was offered a contract to play for the Chicago organization. However, he ended up playing for the Paintsville Highlanders in 1978, a co-op team in the Appalachian League which rostered several players on loan from many organizations. And the reviews were mixed, it was not as if he necessarily distinguished himself.\n\nIn 1979, he moved up to Chicago's Single- A team in Appleton, and despite a 5-10 record had a low enough ERA that the organization moved him up to Double- A for 1980. He had a break-out season and earned an opportunity to pitch in Major League spring training in 1981.\n\nThough his rise through the minor league system was relatively rapid, it was still unexpected that this would lead to anything more than an opportunity to face some big-league hitters. However, he made the White Sox ballclub out of spring training. As a lefty reliever, he got into 41 games, pitched 44 innings and had three saves for the 1981 White Sox. He followed that up with a solid 1982 season, pitching in 60 games and 78 innings, and won 4 games, saving six others. After a down season in 1983, he was released at the end of spring training in 1984. He quickly signed a minor league contract and started the season in Triple- A. After a 6.27 ERA in just over 47 innings, he was demoted to Double- A for three games before finding himself in Single- A, pitching for the Appleton squad once again. He had some better results pitching mostly as a starting pitcher. In August, Hickey was traded to the New York Yankees along with future Cy Young Award winner Doug Drabek for shortstop Roy Smalley. In 1985, he split the time in the minor league organizations of the Yankees and Philadelphia Phillies. A year later, he pitched to a 6.51 ERA for the Triple- A Portland team of the Pacific Coast League (Phillies). He split the 1987 season with the White Sox and San Francisco Giants organizations, producing similarly bad results.\n\nHickey's track record of the past five seasons would have made him the prototypical player fictitious Cleveland Indians owner Rachel Phelps would have brought to spring training in the first Major League movie. Perhaps the directors were motivated by his struggles in real life and found him to be perfect for the sequel. Fortunately for Hickey, his story was not over. He signed a minor league contract with the Baltimore Orioles and had a solid season pitching as a lefty specialist for the Rochester Red Wings of the International League. He pitched to a sub two ERA and walked just nine batters in 37 innings pitched. The following season, Hickey made the Orioles out of spring training, getting back to the majors for the first time since 1983. He pitched in 51 games and a 2.92 ERA for a team that improved 33 games in the standings from 1988. After a couple of less impressive seasons in 1990 and 1991, Hickey finally called it a career. Amazing that he pitched all the way through age 35. Just in time to make his appearance in Major League 2.\n\nThere are few people whose real life fit in as perfectly for the character he played like Kevin Hickey and Schoup. I wish director David Ward found a better way to use Hickey's underdog, unsung experience to better personify Schoup's character. It would have been the perfect backdrop for a small part in one of the best sequels ever made.\n\nJames McCann may be a solid addition for the New York Mets assuming he is their target and that he does sign with the team. From a defensive standpoint, the team can use a catcher that has the appropriate attributes needed to guide a pitching staff, provide above average defense behind the plate, and even throw out a couple would be base stealers. As an offensive player, any of the positive rhetoric is an overrating of what McCann can bring to the plate.\n\nFor five seasons, McCann was a well below average MLB hitter (76 OPS+) on a very bad Detroit Tigers baseball team. The last two seasons, while playing for the Chicago White Sox, he has been more productive, culminating with an American League All Star selection in 2019. In the truncated 2020 season, he provided a career best 144 OPS+, though it was only over 111 plate appearances.\n\nFor those that may not want to pay the extra money for JT Realmuto, McCann is a reasonable alternative. He is, however, older than Realmuto; he will turn 31 three months after Realmuto turns 30. Realmuto is arguably as good of a defensive catcher as McCann, especially using stats like defensive runs saved (Realmuto -4, McCann -1) and percentage when it comes to throwing out base stealers (both have thrown out 36% for their career). Obviously, Realmuto brings more to the table as an offensive player. Regardless of what the Mets (or any team that signs him this offseason) do, he will bat somewhere between 2nd and 5th in the lineup. In an offseason where money is not expected to hinder the Mets, in my opinion, they should sign the better catcher.\n\nLets say McCann signs with the Mets. This could lead to what may be an underwhelming offseason for the team. Expectations are high because for the first time in the free agent era, the Mets are expected to be extremely aggressive in free agency without any financial constraints to hold them back. Offering a four year deal is insane, in my opinion, and could lead to other overpays for second tier-type players. In addition, not signing Realmuto will increase the likelihood he ends up in either Philadelphia or Washington.\n\nMaybe the Mets could pivot to Trevor Bauer. But what if Bauer decides he wants to pitch elsewhere and does not sign with the Mets even if they offer him the most lucrative deal? Fans then get to sit and watch the introductory press conferences for both Realmuto and Bauer as they get set to join their new teams. George Springer would be a solid signing. But what happens if the Toronto Blue Jays have him set as their top free agent target and top or match the Mets best offer? They can trade for Francisco Lindor. But what happens if Lindor seems most likely to be interested in signing long term with either the Yankees or Dodgers and the amount of money offered in an extension is not enough to convince him to stay in Flushing long term? That would probably be a deterrent to any deal the Mets could make for Lindor with the Cleveland Indians.\n\nSo, imagine... Not signing Realmuto, Bauer, Springer, or trading for Lindor. The Mets could still have a solid offseason. The Trevor May signing was great. Lets say they add McCann, then make free agent deals for Manuel Margot, Justin Turner, Corey Kluber, Jon Lester, and Brad Hand. That is not a bad offseason. In fact, some could say that it was a very successful one. But not for the Mets in their first offseason after Steve Cohen bought the team.\n\nThe list took over three years to put together. It took the study of every possible era of every possible professional baseball league. Hundreds of SABR biographies were read. Thousands of newspaper articles covering over 150 years, all treating the moment as if it is the only time baseball was in existence. Of course, there was some value in looking at the lists of the top of all time totaling different stats. But this compilation was bigger than that. It was intended to answer more questions than just \"Which player had the highest number or finished with a greater total of an individual stat?\"\n\nWhen the question is asked, \"Who is the greatest baseball player of all time?\", it is all relative to what the person answering the question prefers or enjoys about the game of baseball. It could be limited to the person's favorite team, or at the very least, the time the person most enjoyed baseball. It could be about the now or it could be about the person's childhood. It could also be about the \"Golden Era,\" a timeframe where one insists that baseball was just simply better. Another baseball fan may insist that the game now is the best that it has ever been. Obviously, any biasness will force a difference in opinion when it comes to the best players of all time.\n\nI would love to put together a list of the best baseball players to ever play. That player would be the best when it comes to hitting, fielding, and even pitching. The problem is that there is no way to ever quantify whether is hitter is better than a pitcher or a pitcher is better than a hitter. Their stats can never be compared to each other. It is apples to oranges. Wins above replacement is a respectable equalizer, but no stat can normalize what a hitter brings to the table and what the pitcher is trying to accomplish. It is safe to say a separate list has to exist when it comes to hitters and pitchers.\n\nWhat about defense? We now live in a day and age where defensive metrics tell more than ever about a player's ability to field and his usefulness by being able to get to a ball. These numbers were not always quantified. In addition, field and equipment conditions are advantageous to the modern day baseball player. How do you judge a player who was forced to use a dishrag for a glove? Or a player who made a lot of \"errors\" because his team's infield was a gravel pit?\n\nHere are a couple other things that need to be straightened out. What a player accomplished on the field means just that. There is no character clause. If a player did something devious, perhaps even criminal, that should not take away anything from what the player did on the field. Steroids may have given some players an unfair advantage, but the numbers are just that, the numbers. How a player did it may have a place in the judging over whether the player was a good person. The is not a list of the 100 greatest people.\n\nFinally, this list contains the best players to ever play in any major league. This includes the National League, American League, American Association, National Association, any Negro Leagues, as well as any foreign or Latin American League. There are active MLB players on this list and there are players who played in 1871. Each player considered for this list had their accomplishments weighed over the time they played against their competition. Who were the best players of each generation? Who were their contemporaries? There are some players who rank high on this list that had shortened careers. Others lost valuable time serving the country in a World War. The entire top 100 list can be found on www.johnpielli.com. If that does not appeal, the list is contained on my twitter feed @john_pielli or Instagram johnpielli.\n\nHere are the top twelve players left off this list.\n\n12. Lou Brock\n\nBrock held the MLB stolen base record until Rickey Henderson broke it. He also had over 3000 hits. A Hall of Famer, no doubt. I have nothing else to say other than there are 100 better offensive players than Brock.\n\n11. Lefty O'Doul\n\nO'Doul has the fourth highest batting average in the history of Major League Baseball. (Minimum 1000 plate appearances.) What hurts O'Doul is the few seasons he had as a MLB hitter after starting his career as a pitcher.\n\n10. Ryan Howard\n\nIt is easy to dismiss Howard until you look at his five year peak at the beginning of his career. Howard's top five seasons are all time but he was never the same player after tearing his Achilles making the last out of the 2011 NLDS.\n\n9. Fred McGriff\n\nFred McGriff has the same amount of career home runs as Lou Gehrig. McGriff belongs in the Baseball Hall of Fame. What leaves him out is maybe the same reason he is not getting the credit by the Baseball Writers- he was never considered a top player in the entire game. Does that make him a compiler? No, just a really good player who managed to get his career in under the radar.\n\n8.. Cool Papa Bell\n\nBell was considered to be the fastest man to ever play baseball. The most difficult assessment is that of the Negro Leagues player because of the last of paralleled full season stats. His stats were great, but the stories of his talent were even better.\n\n7. Gary Sheffield\n\nSheff is a similar case to that of McGriff, except he was a little more well known. His numbers stack up, but he played in the back round of the best in the game.\n\n6. Todd Helton\n\nLarry Walker getting into the Baseball Hall of Fame will help Helton's future case. Is it the Colorado inflation that holds him back? Maybe. But his numbers are certainly top 100 worthy.\n\n5. Robin Yount\n\nYount won the American League MVP as a shortstop and as a centerfielder. I sense many in the Midwest are annoyed Yount is not in the top 100. Perhaps if defense had any weight in this discussion, he may have slipped in.\n\n4. Harmon Killebrew\n\nKillebrew was the best power hitter not included in the top 100. His 573 home runs almost seem sacrilegious to leave out. But he only hit .256 for his career. A sure fire Hall of Famer- yes.\n\n3. Hugh Duffy\n\nDuffy played in the 1800's and while a lot of players from that timeframe made the list, Duffy misses out. His .440 batting average is one of the highest recorded in the history of the game. The longevity of his career compared to some of his contemporaries, works against him and leaves him on the outside looking in.\n\n2. Willie Stargell\n\nIt pains me to leave Pops off the list. This man is one of the reasons for this post. 475 home runs, a National League MVP, three straight years finishing either 2 or 3 in the voting. Those Pirates teams would not have won without Stargell, but that speaks to his value from an intangible standpoint. He never played in more than 148 games and lost a good amount of his career playing second fiddle to Roberto Clemente. After Clemente's passing, Stargell had years of greatness, but his total resume just misses out.\n\n1. Billy Williams\n\nWilliams was the sidekick to Ernie Banks. Banks was the big time Chicago Cubs star. I look at Williams as the best player to not be on the list. His numbers are deserving and he clearly is the best player I have profiled to this point. I look at Sheffield's numbers and see a similarity in that Williams produced consistently every year, but did not get the credit he deserves.\n\nPlease check out the actual list of the Top 100 Offensive Position Players of All Time on www.johnpielli.com. I am sure legitimate cases can be made for these twelve as well as many other great players when it comes to the history of the sport. Please join me for the discussion.\n\nSeven of the twelve are deserved members of the Baseball Hall of Fame. Four of the remaining five really should be in the Hall. And Howard, who will get some consideration, had a five year stretch that has seldom been paralleled. Perhaps O'Doul did not play long enough, but he did manage some of the better hitting offensive seasons of memory. It is safe to say these twelve players can each switch places with some of the top 100 players.\n\nWhy is there just 12? In all honesty, I felt like the top 100 list was really the top 112. After number 112, I saw a significant drop off in the quality of player being evaluated.\n\nPlenty has happened over the history of professional baseball. When it comes to the year of the current, there is heated debate over whether the National League should adopt (and adapt to every other baseball league) the designated hitter. Over time, this will become a formality. The fact that the National League does not use the designated hitter may be the only difference left if it were trying to separate itself from every other baseball league.\n\nThere was a time in baseball history when the National League reigned supreme. The National League has always been referred to as the senior circuit and a lot of that has to do with the fact that NL baseball can be traced back to 1876. The American League formed in 1901, but before that, there was the American Association that lasted from 1882-1891 and the Players League which only funded itself to last the 1890 season.\n\nTo provide a little backdrop for the 1894 season, please let me describe professional baseball at that time. While baseball had earned its stripe as \"America's Pastime,\" the National League had grown into an empire. During this time, the league ran unopposed- in other words, there was no other Major League at the moment. The beforementioned American Association disbanded in 1891 and even though there was talk of organization, nothing had materialized to this point. The National League consisted of twelve teams. The following eight are all still active in the current National League- Boston Beaneaters, Philadelphia Phillies, Chicago Colts, Cincinnati Reds, St. Louis Browns, Pittsburgh Pirates, New York Giants, and Brooklyn Grooms. Boston is now the Atlanta Braves, the Colts are now the Cubs, the Browns are now the Cardinals, the Giants are now in San Francisco, and the Brooklyn Grooms are now the Los Angeles Dodgers. The other four teams would be contracted after the 1899 season- Baltimore Orioles, Washington Senators, Cleveland Spiders, and Louisville Colonels. Three of the four contracted cities would get new teams in the American League, which played its first season in 1901.\n\nThe National League of 1894 had a 130 game season and the Baltimore Orioles won the Pennant with a 89-39 record. Teams played as many as 132 games and as little as 128. The Louisville Colonels finished at the bottom of the league with a record of 36-94. While six teams finished with winning records and six with losing seasons, every team except for the Colonels had a winning record at home. Conversely, only the League Champion Orioles and New York Giants finished with winning records on the road.\n\nMany times, 1968 is referred to as the year of the pitcher. 1894 was the year of the hitter. Or maybe, the year of the bad pitcher. The collective batting average of the NL in 1894 was .309 and the cumulative earned run average for the league was 5.33. The ERA number is a little misleading though. There were a total of just over 13,381 innings pitched for the entire season. There were a total of 11,796 runs scored, even though just 8187 of them were earned. That would result in a run average of 7.93. That was right on par with the 7.38 runs averaged per game, per game.\n\nAnother baffling instance was the amount of stolen bases that season. The twelve teams stole a total of 3148 bases during the 1894 season. The same twelve teams struck out a total of 3333 times. Compare that to the National League during the season of 2019, when its 15 teams stole a total of 1133 bases but struck out a total of 21,048 times! \"Sliding\" Billy Hamilton of the Phillies led the league with 100 stolen bases. Tom Brown of the Colonels led the league with 76 strikeouts. No other NL player struck out more than 43 times.\n\nTwo teams stood out as the NL batted a collective .309. The Philadelphia Phillies hit .350 as a team and had four of the top five in the NL batting champion race. Even though Hugh Duffy of the Braves won the NL Batting title with a .440 batting average, the four Phillies are part of something we will never, ever, see again. Outfielders Sam Thompson (.415), Ed Delahanty (.405), and the before mentioned Hamilton (.403) all hit over .400. Back up outfielder Tuck Turner qualified for the batting title due to his 382 plate appearances. He actually finished second in the NL with his .418 batting average. That means five players, four from the same team (and the same outfield) all batted over .400. Hamilton also led the league with 198 runs scored, a MLB record that stands to this day. Unfortunately, the Phillies finished in fourth place.\n\nHome runs were not yet a big thing- Duffy of the Braves led the league with 18. However, a total of nine players had 20 or more triples, led by Baltimore Orioles second baseman Heinie Reitz with 31. Speaking of the Orioles, they hit .343 as a team and their entire lineup hit over .300. Outside of Reitz, every regular Orioles player hit at least .335.\n\nWhile it was clearly the year of the hitter, not every pitcher had poor results. Yes, batters hit .309 collectively for the season and pitchers not only had an ERA of 5.33, but a run average of 7.93. There was one qualified starting pitcher who managed to finish the season with an ERA under 3.70. Amos Rusie went 36-13 with a 2.78 ERA and led the league with 1.41 walks and hits per inning pitched. His 195 strikeouts led the league, but so did his 200 walks. In spite of his 188 ERA plus, which adjusted his ERA according to the variance of the ballpark, he did give up another 91 unearned runs.\n\nThe last thing worth mentioning about this season is the unbelievable amount of Hall of Famers that played (and managed) in the National League in 1894. Not to mention three players whose accomplishments may have been overlooked by the Baseball Hall of Fame- George Van Haltren, Bill Dahlen, and Dummy Hoy. I can also make a fair case for Kid Gleason and Pete Browning. The Orioles alone had seven Hall of Famers- manager Ned Hanlon, John McGraw, Wilbert Robinson, Joe Kelley, Hughie Jennings, Willie Keeler, and Dan Brouthers. Other Hall of Famers include manager Frank Selee (Bos), Duffy (Bos), Tommy McCarthy (Bos), Kid Nichols (Bos), Cap Anson (Chi), Clark Griffith (Chi), Charlie Comiskey (Cin), Cy Young (Cle), John Clarkson (Cle), Jesse Burkett (Cle), Buck Ewing (Cle), Bobby Wallace (Cle), Fred Clarke (Lou), Rusie (NY), Roger Connor (NY/ SL), George Davis (NY), John Montgomery Ward (NY), Thompson (Phil), Hamilton (Phil), Delahanty (Phil), Jake Beckley (Pit), and Connie Mack (Pit). That is 29 Hall of Fame players, managers, and pioneers that changed the game forever!\n\nIf I was to pick a season to simply embrace the history of, it would be difficult to top 1894. It is incredible to absorb some of the events and occurrences of this season. Of course, the game was played differently than it is now. The fielders used the equivalent of dish rags for gloves, resulting in the record amount of errors committed. At least for one person, this was a fun season to recap. It is unfortunate many baseball fans try to forget about baseball before the live ball era. Yes, the game is different now, but the 29 Hall of Famers did not just earn a participation trophy. The game of then has made the game we witness in the day we are fortunate to live in. Here is my own version of the 1894 National League baseball season epilogue-\n\nNL Pennant winning team- Baltimore Orioles\n\nMost Valuable Player (Unofficial)- Hugh Duffy (Bos)\n\nCy Young (I know the pitcher the award is named after is only in his fifth season)- Amos Rusie (NY)\n\nRookie of the Year- Fred Clarke (Bos)\n\n​Rolaids Relief Man of the Year (LOL)\n\nCast Iron or Rock Glove Award Winners (Award for Fielding Futility)-\n\nCharlie Irwin (Chi)- 91 errors\n\nBones Ely (SL)- 81 errors\n\nTommy Corcoran (Brk)- 76 errors\n\nBill Dahlen (Chi)- 75 errors\n\nGermany Smith (Cin)- 74 errors\n\nPaul Radford (Was)- 73 errors\n\nShorty Fuller (NY)- 73 errors\n\nBaseball fans, people who cover the game, as well as those associated with the game all have their takes on the sport's annual Hall of Fame discussion. The problem is, the three other major sports acknowledge who the best players were to ever play their respective games and honor those players accordingly in their respective Hall of Fame. Baseball is the only major sport that has the equivalent of their all time hits leader, all time home run leader, the player with the most MVP's, most Cy Young Awards, the players with the third and fourth highest cumulative batting average of all time, and the four players who hit the most home runs in single season history all NOT in its respective Hall of Fame.\n\nI promised I would not talk about Barry Bonds, Pete Rose, Roger Clemens, Joe Jackson, or any of the other players included in my rant from last paragraph. Those wrongs should be corrected before the Baseball Hall of Fame expects to take itself seriously. There are other deserving players who are left out of the Hall of Fame that legitimate cases could be made for. Let me make a couple of those cases today.\n\n1. Fred McGriff\n\nMcGriff was not the most flashy player of his time. Nor was he the most dominant. But you put together his finish line totals and it is hard to explain why he is not a Hall of Famer. The 493 home runs he hit in his career is the exact total Lou Gehrig finished with. For the decade of the 1990's, McGriff averaged 30 home runs a season, hit .291 and had slugging percentage of over .500. His 135 OPS+ for that decade was just a point higher than the number for his career. His career had a real parallel to that of Willie Stargell, except Pops did it with a lot more flare and got a lot more attention.\n\n2. Gil Hodges\n\nHodges was the best all around first baseman in the National League in the decade of the 1950's. Unfortunately, he gets compared to the best first baseman of all time. The likes of Gehrig and Jimmie Foxx are often brought up when any comparison to Hodges comes out. Hodges could never shine either of their shoes, but there was not a better power hitting first baseman during Gil's playing career. For the decade of the 1950's, Hodges was good for 30 home runs and 100 runs batted in during a time when runs batted in mattered. When the National League started giving out Gold Gloves, Hodges won the award the first three years. Stargell would be a decent comp, but I see a combination of Hall of Famer Harmon Killebrew and the first five seasons of Don Mattingly's career. Hodges' role on the 1950's Dodgers team was very important and without him, the team would likely not won two World Series and a total of five National League Pennants.\n\n3. Dan Quisenberry\n\nDan Quisenberry is a name that is pretty easy to forget, especially with Lee Smith getting his Hall of Fame due in 2019. Much respect is due to the multiple inning closer. Baseball has done a lot to make sure those elite pitchers of yesteryear are put in. Rollie Fingers, Goose Gossage, and Bruce Sutter have all gotten the call. From the years of 1980 to 1985, it hard to make a case that even Gossage and Fingers were more dominant (or any six year period for that matter). And Quisenberry was Sutter- prove to me otherwise.\n\n4. Al Oliver\n\nAl Oliver's case revolves around one's opinion on whether 3000 hits is the magic number to get into the Hall of Fame. Because if it is, Oliver got cheated by major league baseball. Collusion was running rampant during the mid to late 1980's and owners had control over what team free agents were playing for. Also, what free agents were able to play baseball at all. Oliver helped the 1985 Toronto Blue Jays in the ALCS as a designated hitter, getting 3 hits and driving in three runs. Oliver was planning to play in 1986. The owners colluded him out of a job and his career was over. A fair free agent market would have likely secured Oliver a two year contract as a DH. All he needed was 129 hits each season and he would have his 3000 hits. There is not a restricted player in MLB history who has not been put in the Hall of Fame with 3000 hits.\n\n5. Jim Kaat\n\nKaat makes a similar case when it comes to 300 wins. This also looks like a free ride into the Hall of Fame; there is not a pitcher with 300 wins that is missing from the Hall of Fame. (Outside of Clemens which we know is not being held out because he did not finish with enough wins.) Kaat was sold to the New York Yankees early in 1979 after the Phillies no longer had a spot in their rotation for him. Kaat was instantly put into the bullpen, something he had not done before. Because he was a true professional, he did it. And he did it well. Well enough that after the St. Louis Cardinals acquired Kaat to use as a starter the following season, it was easy to put him in the bullpen when Whitey Herzog had a chance to. Kaat pitched effectively, predominantly as a reliever from 1979 to 1982, clearly showing he had a lot left. Had he four more seasons as a number five starting pitcher left, he could have clearly averaged 10 wins a season from 1979 to 1982. If he had remained a starter, he would have had over 300 wins.\n\nEthics is a very big issue when it comes to baseball and its history. And even if it is right to leave out players who used performance enhancing drugs from its Hall of Fame, baseball has excluded a lot of its top talent. As hard as one may want to be on Pete Rose and Joe Jackson, the Hall is still missing legitimate cases. Hopefully over time the Veterans Committee can get some of the deserved players in the Hall of Fame where they belong. Which players from baseball's past do you want to see in Baseball's Hall of Fame?\n\nThe New York Yankees are the most successful franchise in the history of professional sports. Yankees fans will remind you every day the amount of World Series Championships the team has won. Those who have followed the team for a long time have a lot to be proud of. But, many fans inherited a successful team when they started their fandom. If you became a fan in 1960, the Yankees had already won eighteen (18) World Series. The later you were born, the more championships you inherited.\n\nI know it is hard to fathom, but there was a time where the Yankees were not known in the light they are now. The run the Yankees had in the late 1930's (winning consecutive World Series from 1936-1939) put the team on the map as the most successful team in the World Series era. When the Yankees completed their fifth straight championship in October of 1953, the team's sixteenth (16th), the next team had won only six (6). The point is, many fans who remember enjoying the run of 1949-1953 are getting to the age of eighty (80) or older. The majority of Yankees fans did not see Joe DiMaggio play.\n\nThe Yankees (or the city of New York for that matter) were not part of the original American League in 1901. The competition to the mighty National League, started by Ban Johnson, consisted of eight teams in the cities of Boston, Detroit, Washington, D.C., Baltimore, Milwaukee, Philadelphia, Cleveland, and Chicago. Imagine starting a \"Major League\" and not including a New York team. The National League tried it from the years of 1958-1961. This was not by design as AL Commissioner Johnson wanted to have a team in New York and understood how it would increase the opportunity of success to the league. After the league's first season, the Milwaukee Brewers moved to St. Louis. But it wasn't until the internal struggles of the Baltimore Orioles that a real possibility existed of a team coming to New York. Johnson feuded with Orioles manager John McGraw, leading to McGraw jumping back to the National League. He took many of his top players with him when he joined the New York Giants during the 1902 season. The financial problems of the Orioles had led to the team being sold to Andrew Freedman, the owner of the New York Giants, and John Brush, the owner of the Cincinnati Reds- both of the National League. Obviously, there was a conflict of interest which led to the before mentioned roster being raided.\n\nThe technical wording for the Orioles franchise termination was \"contraction,\" which led the American League with just seven teams. I think it was a bunch of baloney because the league was never going to survive with an odd number of teams. But history recorded it that way, and a new team started in 1903 in the city of New York.\n\nThe Highlanders (as they were known from 1903-1912) were led (in 1903) by future Hall of Famer Clark Griffith, who doubled as a member of a solid three man rotation with Jack Chesbro and Jesse Tannehill. The three of them combined to win 50 of the team's 72 games, good enough for fourth place in the American League. During their time as the Highlanders, New York would never win an American League Pennant, finishing as high as second in 1904, 1906, and 1910.\n\nA couple of things happened to benefit the franchise after the 1912 season. They moved from Hilltop Park to the Polo Grounds, the home of the National League's Giants. Also, legendary manager Frank Chance, he of the .664 winning percentage, four National League Pennants, and two World Series Championships with the Chicago Cubs (NL), had become unhappy with the direction of the franchise. When he was released from his contract, the Yankees (as they were known officially as) picked him up. The Yankees would finish with a losing record for five of the next six seasons as their future rival Boston Red Sox started racking up World Series (winning in 1915, 1916, and 1918).\n\nA turning point in the history of the franchise was adding St. Louis Cardinals manager Miller Huggins for the 1918 season. The best future comp of Huggins would be Billy Martin, as Huggins was a baseball genius, but would insist of doing things \"his\" way. It led to some confrontation from players, many of whom looked down on Miller because he was shorter than they were. But Huggins instilled discipline to a franchise that needed it. The acquisition of Babe Ruth made Huggins' job a little tougher, especially when the owners' would take the side of Ruth during disputes.\n\nIt was Huggins' discipline that kept that team together. In spite of losing back to back World Series in 1921 and 1922 to the local New York Giants, it seemed as if this team was starting to turn the corner. Pressure was starting to mount though as the team was expected to be good enough to win a World Series. I know this sounds sacrilegious to say, but the Yankees of 1923 could later be compared to the current Los Angeles Angels teams. The Yankees had the best player in baseball, Babe Ruth, and had not won anything yet. Sound familiar?\n\nThe opening of Yankee Stadium in 1923 gave the Yankees a home of their own. They would no longer have to share a stadium with their National League rivals, the team that had just defeated them in consecutive World Series. The Yankees would win 98 games that season, the fourth straight time the franchise won 90 or more games. Ruth would set a franchise record that still exists today with his .393 batting average. He still finished second in the American League to Detroit's Harry Heilmann (.403). Ruth would have a solid cast around him, led by first baseman Wally Pipp (.304 batting average, 109 runs batted in), second baseman Aaron Ward (.284, 10 home runs, 81 RBI), and third baseman Joe Dugan .283, 65 RBI, 111 runs scored). Ruth was complemented in the outfield by Bob Meusel (.313 BA, 91 RBI) and Whitey Witt (.314 BA, 187 hits, 113 runs scored).\n\nWhat showed the most improvement, though, was the pitching. The Yankees had a pitching staff that featured as strong of a starting five as they may have ever had in their history. The five man starting staff of Bullet Joe Bush, Sad Sam Jones, Waite Hoyt, Herb Pennock, and Bob Shawkey combined to win 92 of the team's 98 games. In fact, the quintet combined to pitch just over 1254 of the team's just under 1381 innings during the regular season. Jones won 21 games, while Pennock and Bush won 19. Hoyt won 17 and Shawkey won 16.\n\nThe World Series seemed to start off a lot like the previous two. The Giants won games one and three on home runs by none other than Casey Stengel. The Yankees would roar to easy victories in games four and five, setting up a game six showdown in the Polo Grounds. Ruth would hit a solo home run in the top of the first, with the Giants scoring a single run in the bottom of the inning. The Giants seemed to have the game under control, building a 4-1 lead with single runs in the fourth, fifth, and sixth innings. Giants starting pitcher Art Nehf would start to tire in the eighth though, giving up consecutive singles, then walking three straight batters to cut the deficit to 4-3. Meusel would come up with a big two-run single with a third run scoring on an error. All of the sudden, the Yankees were up 6-4. Jones would come in relief of Pennock and get a six out save as the \"underdog\" Yankees captured their first World Series Championship.\n\nLou Gehrig did not burst on the scene until 1925, but made his MLB debut in 1923. He did not play in the World Series. Just as interesting, future stars Bill Terry and Hack Wilson played for the first time in the same season. Neither would play in the World Series, but both would be very important pieces for the Giants as they would return to the Fall Classic in 1924. The Yankees and Giants playing in three consecutive World Series would be a first... and last as that has yet to again happen in the history of Major League Baseball. Finally, the Yankees winning a World Series in the first year of their new ballpark would happen two more times in baseball history- the 2006 St. Louis Cardinals, and the 2009... New York Yankees.\n\nThe reason I put this together is to put a different light on the New York Yankees franchise. They are known for their success and they are always the line of what winning in sports is compared to. But, just like any other winner, there was a time where the Yankees were the underdog. Imagine this 1923 team, a team with 0 World Series victories (0-2 record in the Fall Classic), trailing the Red Sox (5), Athletics (3), Giants (3), Cubs (2), White Sox (2), as well as the Pirates, Braves, Reds, and Indians, all of whom had won one a piece. It is hard to imagine the Yankees ever being the underdog, but they were in 1923."
