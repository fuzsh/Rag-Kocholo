        "text": "1998 – Jack Overman, community supporter, PSU employee\n\n​\n\nJack Overman was presented the first Distinguished Alumnus Award at the Pittsburg High School Graduation Ceremony. The Distinguished Alumnus Award was created to recognize the outstanding leadership, special contributions, and significant achievements that Pittsburg High School graduates have made in their profession, community, country or the world. By presenting the award at our high school graduation, we hope to inspire our students to greater achievement and service to others.\n\nMr. Overman graduated from Pittsburg High School in 1936. Throughout his life, he has been known to be a true giver. Active on the YMCA Board, Rotary, PSU Foundation, Hospital Foundation Board, First State Bank Board, and his church board, Mr. Overman has made significant contributions to Pittsburg as ha civic and community leader. A devoted state employee, he was honored by Pittsburg State University with the naming of Overman Student Center for him. Although now retired, Mr. Overman is still very active in all of the organizations mentioned above. Pittsburg Community Schools is honored to recognize Jack Overman as the first Distinguished Alumnus Award winner.\n\n1999 – Dr. Donald Cooper, Sports Medicine physician\n\nFor more than half a century, Dr. Donald Cooper has roamed the sidelines of stadiums and arenas around the world. His circle of friends and acquaintances ranges from Jesse Owens to Arnold Schwarzenegger. When and where did his “sideline roaming” begin? The answer is Pittsburg High School way back in the mid-1940s where he volunteered for water boy after concluding that, at 5-foot-1 and 105 pounds, his participation options were limited.\n\nFrom Pittsburg High School, Cooper went to Kansas State College in Pittsburg, where he served as team trainer and equipment manager and graduated in three years. He completed the University of Kansas Medical School in 1953. After service as a captain in the Air Force he began private practice in Manhattan, Kansas. In 1957 he became team physician for the Kansas State Wildcats and assistant director of student health services.\n\nIn 1960, Cooper moved to Oklahoma State University in Stillwater taking on the roles of team physician and director of the Student Health Center until 1990. He continued as team physician and the director of Athletic Medicine until his retirement in 1998.\n\nFor 38 years, Cooper served as OSU’s team doctor and was a favorite of fans. He is known for his vivid sideline manner. “I’ve been standing on sidelines and sitting on benches for over 50 years, and I’ve never gotten a technical foul or a penalty.” Said Cooper, I’ve been warned hundreds of times to be quiet.” Once when an OSU coach berated Cooper for attending to an injured opponent Cooper shot back, “This is somebody’s son. He’s hurt and I’m going to take care of him.”\n\nCooper does not reserve his penetrating voice for game officials and coaches. He has used his voice to become one of sports medicine’s most recognized figures. During his career he spoke widely to describe the dangers of performance-enhancing drugs and bigger, faster, stronger bodies colliding on the football field. He appeared on national television programs and was quoted in books, magazines, and newspapers.\n\nAmong other career highlights, Cooper served as 1968 U.S. Olympic Team Physician, won the Edward Hitchcock Award for outstanding contributions to college health, and twice testified before Congress on issues related to sports medicine. Appointed by President Ronald Reagan and again by President George Bush, he served twelve years as a member of the President’s Council on Physical Fitness and Sports.\n\nCooper chaired the first Russian-American Conference on Student Health. He has served the American Medical Association, NCAA, U.S. Wrestling Federation, International Federation of Body Builders, Southwestern and the American College Health Associations, National Athletic Trainer’s Association, U.S. Olympic Committee, and the Presbyterian Church.\n\n​\n\n2000 – Gary Zukav, author\n\nAfter graduating from Pittsburg High School in 1960, Gary Zukav furthered his education and graduated from Harvard University. He also served in Vietnam as a Green Beret.\n\nIn describing his life, Zukav wrote, “My journey from an angry man with no regard for Life to who I am now has been long, often difficult, joyful, and extremely rewarding. It has shown me that anyone can make the same kind of journey in his or her own way. For the last ten years I felt that the best contribution that I could make to the world that is being born is to live a conscious life, challenge and heal the frightened parts of myself and be a good neighbor.”\n\nIn 1979 he wrote The Dancing Wu Li Masters which won The American Book Award for Science. The book explains quantum physics in terms a layman can understand. In 1989 he wrote The Seat of the Soul, a U.S. National Best Seller, about evolution and the soul. Together his first two books have sold two and a half million copies, and have been translated into sixteen languages.\n\nZukav wrote his third book, Soul Stories, in 2000. Soul Stories relates true stories that show how such concepts as intuition, harmony, sharing and forgiveness actually express themselves in people’s lives.\n\nZukav has also appeared numerous times on the Oprah Winfrey television program and is featured on her www.oprah.com website.\n\n​\n\n​\n\n2001 - Ron Marrone, Class of 1969. Business owner, Marrone’s, community volunteer.\n\nRon Marrone is a person who epitomizes the graduate of the USD 250 school system whom we work to send out into the world based on the guidelines set forth in our mission statement. He is our student who continues to live, learn in and contribute to our ever changing society- and how lucky for us, that he has chosen to stay and do this in the Pittsburg community.\n\nMarrone graduated from PHS in 1969 and has since become a vital part of the Pittsburg community. Ask anyone ins Pittsburg if they know Ron Marrone, and if they do not know him personally, they have read about him in the paper or heard his name.\n\nRon is part of everything that happens in Pittsburg. His peers refer to him as “Mr. Community” and say he is on about every civic committee that exists in Pittsburg. It is truly amazing how he finds the times to do all these things, run his business successfully and yet work closely with his family – but he does! Additionally, Ron serves in all these capacities as a volunteer, neither seeking nor getting reimbursement or recognition for his service.\n\nAlways encouraging and supportive, Ron goes out of his way to help, in any way he can, the students and staff at PHS as well as the other schools in USD 250. Because of his interest in the district, he has served on any committees, the last being the successful committee to pass the school bond issue last January. His unfailing enthusiasm and support is admired by all.\n\nIn 1994, Ron organized the PHS Alumni Association and quickly established a scholarship fund for graduating seniors of PHS. This scholarship fund has grown each year with contributions from alumni, through Ron’s promotion at class reunions, and the establishment of the annual PHS Alumni Basketball Game. Ron not only tries to inspire students to continue their education but also works to raise money needed to help them make their dreams and goals possible.\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​2002 – Dr. Robert M Golub, Class of 1973. Physician, Educator for Princeton, Harvard Medical Schools.\n\nAfter graduating from PS in 1973, Robert M. Golub MD went on to attend Princeton University where he graduated Magna Cum Laude in 1977. He then attended Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons in New York where he received his M.D. in Internal Medicine in 1981. Later Robert went on to North Western Memorial Hospital in Chicago where he did his internship and residency from 1981 to 1985. The last year of his residency, he acquired the honor of Chief Medical Resident at the hospital.\n\nRobert’s main contributions to his profession include a focus on curriculum development with teaching and significant professional achievement. He has been given the responsibility to figure out exactly how future doctors at one of the top medical schools in the country will be educated. Out of his work, he has been nationally and internationally recognized for his research, teaching and published writings.\n\nThe curriculum he has developed includes topics such as clinical epidemiology, study and design, literature critiquing, biostatistics, use and interpretation of diagnostic tests, psychology of decision making, decision analysis, medical informatics and computer decision aids. Because of these efforts, Robert has been on the visiting faculty for Stanford University Faculty Development Program and Decision Making since 1990.\n\nAt the request of Dr. Robert Fletcher of Harvard, Dr. Golub has provided his student and faculty guides to help Harvard Medical School develop courses with similar goals. He has also assisted with the development of curriculum at school in Japan, Hungary, Puerto Rico and other US institutions. Dr. Golub has an ongoing relationship with the University of Buenos Aires Medical School in Argentina where he has been on the visiting faculty since 1994. This program is jointly sponsored by Harvard School of Public Health. Robert is the only faculty member outside of Harvard that has been asked to teach in Argentina.\n\nMuch of Robert’s work involves clinical practice with patients, medical research and numerous writings for publications. Although he is very deserving of this award for his work in any of these areas, his accomplishments in teaching and training are outstanding. “I believe that being a physician is one of the most complex tasks a person can do. It involves a combination of skills and knowledge that includes communication, ethics, decision-making, economics, law and a huge body of science. These are being applied moment by moment directly with people who are all unique and therefore the physician must be able to appreciate the personality and culture, and to adjust their approach and application of these skills” says Golub.\n\n2003 – Dick and Kaye Lynne Webb, Class of 1956. Founders of Watco Companies\n\nDick and Kaye Lynne Webb have been members of this community for virtually their entire lives. They both graduated from Pittsburg High School in 1956.\n\nThe Webbs exemplify graduates who have not only excelled personally and professionally, but have returned such time, talent and treasure to our community and to PHS.\n\nThey provide leadership to the Pittsburg community and their generosity is often unknown. They are a strong booster of many community projects and provide ideas, manpower, and monetary resources. They are well known among their peers as having a “no nonsense” approach to solving community problems.\n\nIn 1983, Dick Webb founded Wat.co Companies in Pittsburg with the assistance of Kaye Lynne and other family members. He has quietly been the driving force behind the development of this company which today is recognized in the transportation industry as a very successful, innovative leader in customer service, primarily involving rail related activities. Watco maintains a deep commitment to its associates, helping them to develop and improve in their roles in the community and workplace.\n\nToday, with Dick’s foresight and the support/efforts of Kaye Lynne other family members and staff, Watco has a presence in 16 states, and the distinction of operating the largest privately held short line railroad network in the United States.\n\nOver the years, the Webbs and Watco have brought educational opportunities such as the “A train” to the community, as well as investing time, money and effort into the proposed Immigrant Park. While many people are involved in their communities, the Webbs are the type of people who don’t just attend meetings – they roll up their sleeves and get to work.\n\nCongratulations to Dick and Kaye Lynne Webb for your outstanding service to USD 250 and the community of Pittsburg.\n\n​\n\n​\n\n2004 – Don Gutteridge, Class of 1930.

Shortly after graduating from Pittsburg High School in 1930, his baseball career began with the St. Louis Browns. He was a member of the Browns’ organization that won the pennant in 1944. He later joined the Boston Red Sox in 1946.\n\nDon used his talents as a major league coach and manager after his playing days ended. From the sandlots of Pittsburg, Kansas, to the major leagues, he left an indelible mark on the game of baseball. He had great dedication and love for the game of baseball and served as a positive role model for others.

The book features great stories from Don’s days with the Gas House Gang, the St. Louis Browns, the Boston Red Sox, the Chicago White Sox and is packed with over 100 vintage photos from Don’s personal collection. “I wanted to get my story out there not so much for what I’ve done in my baseball career,” Mr. Gutteridge humbly says, “but I wanted people to enjoy the funny stories that I experienced first-hand involving Pepper Martin, Dizzy Dean, Lon Warneke and a host of others.”\n\nTo say that Don Gutteridge has distinguished himself, inspired others to greater achievements, made special contribution of time, talent and effort to his profession and community, is of high moral character and served as a positive example to others is to describe his exemplary life. Don is a man of many lifetime achievements and he has never forgotten his family, friends and where he got his start...Pittsburg, Kansas.\n\n​\n\n​\n\n2004 - Bob Timmons, Class of 1942. KU Track and Cross Country coach\n\nAfter over 50 years of coaching, Bob Timmons was recognized for his accomplishments at the University of Kansas with his induction into the inaugural class of the KU Relays Hall of Fame (Spring 2004.) Quite an accomplishment for a guy who described himself as an athlete that “was not very good” at Pittsburg High School. Bob was the head coach of the KU track and cross country teams from 1965-1988, leading them to twenty-nine Big 8 titles and four national championships. One of Bob’s athletes included world record holder, Jim Ryun.\n\nAfter graduating from PHS in 1942, he spent a year and two summers at Pittsburg State University before heading to KU. Bob was having difficulty making up his mind on a major, as options in college were quite different than today. While trying to make a career decision, Bob spent three years in the U.S. Marine Corps. Bob recently told a reporter at the Morning Sun “I was just terribly unhappy with school and the only thing I was really interested in was sports. I finally had the courage to tell my folks that I was going to change my major to physical education and that I wanted to be a coach.” And one of the men who turned Bob on to coaching was none other than legendary KU basketball coach, Forrest “Phog” Allen.\n\nBob’s first coaching assignment was at Caldwell High School as assistant football and head basketball coach. He then went to Wichita and coached at Wichita East and Wichita West High Schools. He later returned to Wichita East High School where he added seven more state titles in track to their trophy case.\n\nIn addition to being coach and mentor to world class athletes, Coach Timmons also is famous for being a great motivator, teacher and mentor. He has made a profound and positive impact on the lives and personal value systems of athletes, managers, trainers, and parents who have been privileged to take part in his high school, and college level programs. These programs date back from the mid-1950s and continue to the current day.\n\nTimmons Memorial Chapel on the Pittsburg State University campus is named in honor of Timmons’s mother, Bess Spiva Timmons. Aside from his coaching accomplishments, Timmons is now known for his Rim Rock Farm, which has hosted the KSHSAA Class 5A and 6A State Cross Country Championships since 1992. When one thinks of world class track and field athletes and coaching in Kansas, one thinks of Bob Timmons and the impact his life has had on the sport and its participants in this state and worldwide.\n\n​\n\n​\n\n2005 – Dr. Phillip Cedeno, Class of 1974.

He is always willing to get involved and help in Pittsburg Community Schools.
