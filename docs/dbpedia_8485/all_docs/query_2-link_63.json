        "text": "BOOK ONE\n\nSt. Vitus Dance\n\nPART ONE\n\nLily\n\n1\n\nMoore Township, 1845\n\nSomething stirred in the darkness ahead. It made no sound, as yet. But it was present, and alive, or coming alive: she always knew. She did. The breath from a fawn’s cough could tease her skin – like this ripple of shaded wind against her cheek – long before her ear caught the sound and recorded it. Lil was glad once again to be in the comfort of the trees’ canopy. It was cozy here, like the cabin with Papa’s fire blazing out of icy logs, when Mama was not in her bed. Lil wasn’t afraid of the dark. Mama sometimes shivered in the dark at night, the rare night when Papa was off and Lil was beckoned to press her thighs and chest and swan’s belly against her mother’s clenched form. She dreamt she was a moth spinning a cocoon of silver words about them both, full of charms to drive the gremlins from Mama’s eyes, while outside, heard only by her, the snow sang to the wind and no one in the world was lonely.\n\nIt was never lonesome in the bush. Here things bulged and endured in the dappled undergrowth – ferns and worts and fungi and mosses, and, in the few random spots freckled by sun, surprised violets. They made their voices known. Lil could hear them already though she was moving with short quick steps towards the deepest cove of the back bush, the place forbidden by Mama, the home of the almost-sound that vibrated the air with furred bat-wings and no eyes. She stopped. Beyond, a branch stretched, umbilical and biding. Ferns sighed in currents only they could feel. A thrush untangled his song: pastel and longing. Lil set her face against the tiny drafts of air raised by her own body-heat. A snakeskin combed the grass; she heard a birdwing flex and fold, a deermouse scuttle and freeze, a caterpillar dissecting a resistant leaf. The sound had stopped.\n\nYou stay away from the Indians, you hear? Mama said so every day. Mama hated Indians. They were the cause of everything. They took whiskey; they went crazy and hurt people; they never did a lick of work; they went off hunting god-knows-where in the back bush, taking good men with them, so’s the trees didn’t get cut. And them squaws, Mama would say in a special voice, her eyes getting fiery and pure, why they – she’d look at Lil and stop, and the passion would ebb from her face. Well, they’re wicked, Lil, they take whiskey and – dance and do bad things with men… Lil would be trembling with anticipation at seeing her mother’s pale flesh puff out with some kind of necessity beyond self-preservation. Lil wanted to ask, not about the bad things, but about the dancing. Though she never did. It was after one of these bouts that Mama often took to her bed.\n\nBut Lil knew where they stayed. Many nights, curled in the straw of her loft, she heard the drumbeats come across the tree-tops from miles away and settle into their clearing as if they had been aimed there. They were not like her heartbeat, back and forth, nor like the sprightly songs Mama sang in her other language when she was feeling better and sitting before her spinning wheel in the bright sun of the garden she had helped to clear. It was a pounding, repetitive music that set her heart ajar, that made her dream of strange creatures who preferred breathing in the dark, that made her long to know what words would be sung to such cadence, what dances would find their feet in such grooved frenzies. She wanted to see these women, how they moved in the firelight that twisted above the black roof of the bush, what their eyes did when they danced in their smoky, burnished, mosquito-driven dark.\n\nAn axe rang against a tree-trunk, clear as a church bell. Papa’s back. Lil recognized the signature of his chopping: two vicious slashes, the second slightly more terrifying than the first, followed by two diminished, tentative ‘chunks’. Maybe Mama would hear it and leave her bed. He was in the North Field. That was good. He’d only gone off as far as the Frenchman’s. Sometimes one of the Frenchman’s boys came back with him and helped Papa. Lil hated them, all three of them. They watched her all the time with the edges of their eyes. And Papa would shout at her to go away. Sometimes though he brought Thérese back. Lil liked Thérese though she talked crooked and had an ugly belly that poked out in front of her like an old melon. Thérese cooked soup, made bread in the mornings, and laughed. She was happy.\n\nThérese showed Lil how to skip. She put a small tin instrument to her mouth and made music. She laughed when Lil hopped and jigged, and then Papa came along and took her by the hand and swung her about in the midst of the music, and laughed from the back of his throat. Well, my Lady Fair Child, so you can dance, eh? We’ll have to take her down to London to see the Queen, won’t we, Thérese?\n\nThérese got pains in her ugly belly, though, and had to go back to the Frenchman’s.\n\nShe’s dead, Papa said, that evening, standing in the open doorway, his hands helpless. The babe, too.\n\nAll for the best, Mama whispered from her bed. Whose was it?\n\nLuc’s I guess. The eldest. Papa did not see Lil at his knee peering up with the question What’s dead? on her lips. \"God damn them all, may they rot in hell,\" he hissed in a voice that came from nowhere inside him Lil had ever known.\n\nPapa was back. Every day he swore he would kill that damn Frenchman, but all the same he went over there. Though Mama didn’t mind too much. It was the Indians she hated. Whenever Papa went off in that direction – through the East Field to the back bush, where Lil was at this very second – Mama got mean. So Lil would look for berries along the edges of the cleared area, and when she got back Mama would be in her own bed in the curtained-off area to the right of the fire, her body folded on the straw pallet, rigid as a pin.\n\nFor a moment Lil thought she ought to go over to the North Field. The place where the Indians were was forbidden. The strange sound she thought she had heard had stopped, or never been. Papa might be in a good mood. She listened carefully to the desperate repetition of Papa’s axe against the grained flesh of the tree. He was at one of the hardwoods again. She would not go. Though she wanted so to dance for him again, the way Thérese had showed her, to have Papa laugh and say Lady Fair Child, may I have the pleasure of the next dance?\n\nSuddenly the axe-blows ceased. Lil held her breath. Then she heard the thunderous, sustained shriek of disbelief and betrayal as the two-hundred-year-old walnut came crashing through the forest to stun the ground with its abrupt goodbye. Lil sat for a while in the sun-lit beaver meadow below the creek and listened to the tree’s dying reverberate through the earth.\n\nShe hated him. He trapped rabbits in the east corner, their strung-up bodies stiffened by the night air, the warmest morning could not thaw them. He nailed the head of the deer-with-no-eyes above the fireplace, where it stared down at them pretending to see like Old Samuels, the blind Indian who sometimes sat in the sun in the dooryard, telling stories to the Frenchman’s boys and twitching his white head about from person to person as if it could perceive the smiles and nods of an audience. She hated Papa. He made Thérese be dead.\n\nLil laughed. A butterfly, yellow as honey, was tilting the breeze on one wing, then the other, before a thistle rescued it. When Lil stretched out a finger, it gratefully accepted the offer. She could feel the wind’s ripple flow down the golden sails of its wings, shudder through its stiff rigging and hum against her fingertips. Then she saw its ugly mouth-parts, scissoring and askew. A hand pounced. The sails exploded. She was about to regret something when the premonition of the sound came again. From the grove just beyond the clearing. This time she felt it. She knew.\n\nThere were two sounds. The strongest was a tearing, pent-up sensation she felt somewhere in her groin, forcing its way upwards towards her throat, an inchoate cry of pain in which anguish and joy were equally mixed, as if something precious was fighting to be liberated and lost, welcomed and regretted. Lil’s stomach twisted with the urgency of her need as she waited for its full articulation to reach her ears. At which point she felt the presence of the second voice, in her lungs and swelling through her heart and up behind her eyes where she often measured the echoes of Thérese’s music – a cry not nearly so loud or anxious as the first but somehow stronger, not yet formed but ripe with confidence and possibility.\n\nLil’s bones rang like tuning forks. Something alive and dangerous lay in the forbidden place where the Indians dwelt, where they drummed and sang. Tremors of pure fright shook her body. She was scared; she was alive; she wanted to dance; she wanted to know where Thérese lived. She stepped into the gloom ahead. She saw before she heard.\n\nThe tableau that materialized in front of her could not have lasted more than a few seconds, yet was vivid and detailed, illuminated as it was by that curious half-glow which thrives in the underbrush, relishes its kinship with the mushroom dark, and is more defining to the eye in tune with its motives than the most glaring sunlight.\n\nThough the images came almost as one, Lil picked out the doe’s eyes, fear afloat in them; a dishevelled mane of black hair electric around them; then a mouth, attached to nothing but the tongue whose cry it seemed desperate to swallow. The shriek from that disembodied instrument struck the pine-boles behind Lil at the very instant she felt its incredible agony burst up through her own throat and enter the air. In the increasing light, Lil saw the stems of a woman’s breasts aimed upward and knew she was witnessing someone or something going dead. Her instinct now was to run, to save something precious and violable inside her from annihilation. Instead, she watched the woman’s hands thrash, independent of each other, against the unresisting air, and waited for the next, the final, cry.\n\nThen Lil saw that the eyes, hair, tongue, hands and nipples were connected to a single body, were even curiously coordinated to some mysterious purpose. The bronze skin, utterly vulnerable to the air, told her she was seeing, for the first time, an Indian woman in her own place. She was lying on her back, braced now on her elbows, her legs flung or pulled wide, in a sort of protected hollow in the brush that looked as if it had been prepared for this chance event in some way. Even before the next wrenching cry came out of her, Lil herself heard the second voice and gazed, in horror and delight, as a tiny head, like a water-logged walnut, battered against the woman’s opening, timing its own assaults with the latter’s convulsive flinching, till at last its gleaming skull burst forth in a halo of blood whose petals spun at Lil’s feet, whose medallions dripped from the slow leafage. Behind the blood-slick head a brown vermiform trunk thrashed and strove, till its dormant extremities kicked clear. As the babe slid onto the carpet of the forest floor, the little head twisted sunward, then turned to reveal a miniature face with eyes that looked straight at Lil.\n\nThey were as black as Thérese’s.\n\n2\n\n1\n\nMama was in her bed again. She went there quite a lot now. Yesterday she had smiled at Lil and said, Well, little one, it’s time we went down to see this North Field of ours. Pale and tiny, occasionally clutching at Lil’s shoulder, she picked her way past the charred stumps of last year’s slash-and-burn, careful to avoid the ripening wheat of the older East Field, and coming at last out of the shadow of the huge pines to a point where she could see, at a glance, the five acres of cleared land to be called forever after the North Field. The odour of ash and singed wood and languishing smoke struck their nostrils. Mama breathed it in, like an elixir. In the distance Papa turned, stood still, and then waved. Pick some raspberries this side of the creek, she said to Lil. I’ll make a pie.\n\nThere was no pie. The berries had shrivelled a month before and Mama had one of her coughing spells. Papa as usual took some day-old soup in to her. Lil listened, as she always did, to catch the slightest whisper of a word between them. There was none. Though Papa stayed a long while, until the haze of evening grew like a moss along the sills and Mama’s breathing became regular again, heavy with exhaustion.\n\nThis morning he went off. Gotta have meat for that soup, he used to say to Lil, taking down his gun and putting on the buckskin he’d gotten from Old Samuels. Lately he just went off. Probably, Mama said, her voice shaking with effort, with that Acorn fellow. Acorn, one of Old Samuels’ nephews, never came near the house, sometimes standing for hours (Lil had seen him at the edge of the East Field) just waiting, before slipping back into the bush.\n\nBut Lil was ‘a help’ now. She was seven. If Papa set the pot on the irons and started the fire, she could cut the turnips up and toss them in, and stir the soup with its tiny rabbit bones disconnected and afloat. Papa had made a lovely stone oven at one side of the fireplace, and Lil would take the sourdough prepared by Maman LaRouche, and doing exactly what she had been shown, make bread for Papa’s supper. Next spring Papa was going to get them a pig. Already he’d built a pen for it against the east wall.\n\nPlenty pigs in the bush, Old Samuels would chortle. Only White Mens builds him a house and grows him food. Then he would shake his head in mock bewilderment at the folly of his hosts. Nonetheless, he would wait with the patience of his seventy-odd years till Lil or Papa reached into the stew and offered a respectfully large morsel. Mama didn’t like the way Old Samuels came into the main room without announcing his arrival. Sometimes Lil would be working over the fire, humming one of Mama’s songs, and when she turned, Old Samuels would be no more than five feet behind her, the black pennies where his eyes should have been giving nothing away. You gonna be a good cook, like the Frenchman’s woman.\n\nOccasionally he would stay all day, sitting on his knees to the left of the fire where he could detect any cool draft from the curtained doorway, saying nothing. Sometimes he would talk to Lil, raising his thin voice just enough to include Mama, willing or no, in the one-way conversation. Old Samuels told long stories, most of which began, Wasn’t like that here in the olden days and ended and that’s the truth, and I know ‘cause I seen it, I seen it before these eyes of mine withered up on me. When Papa made the slightest demurral, he’d say, Besides, blind men don’t lie.\n\nHe’s got the manners of a ghost, Mama used to say, but not once did she ask him to leave.\n\nHow does he get here if he can’t see? Lil asked Papa. He says he’s lived here so long he knows every bush and beetle in the territory, Papa said. And it seemed to be true, as Lil would watch him enter their land at the far corner of the East Field just past the Brown Creek (that went, they said, all the way to the Indian camp in the back bush), and then thread his way through the maze of stumps and ash-heaps, never once stepping on the haphazard swirls of wheat between.\n\nRedmen smells his way in the bush, he told Lil. Don’t need eyes. Redmen sniffs the air currents like the white-tail. He demonstrated. Raspberry jam, he announced, from the Frenchman’s woman.\n\nYes, said Lil, duly amazed.\n\nLast week, though, after the Frenchman and his three eldest – Luc, Jean-Pierre and Anatole – had finished piling and burning the last log in the North Field, and after some firewater had been consumed by all, Lil saw Old Samuels weave his way towards the back bush, teetering and righting himself as he went. At the corner of the East Field, he paused. The sounds of the men parting in the other direction diminished and died. Old Samuels appeared to look towards the east. Then a small brown boy slipped from the bush and touched Old Samuels’ hand. He shook it off. The boy turned. Old Samuels followed, exactly two paces behind until the woods reclaimed them.\n\nYour Papa got a nose for the wind, he said whenever Papa went off with Acorn or Sounder. Hunting’s no good here now. Not like the olden days. They go all the way to Chatham, I guess, to find any bucks this time of year.\n\nLil wanted to know more about Chatham but Mama began coughing and she had to take the soup in. When she got back, she saw it was no use: Old Samuels had lit up his pipe, stuffed with aromatic tobacco. White Mens’ tobacco no good, he would say. Not like the olden days. But when he got smoking, he didn’t talk.\n\nLil may not have known much about Chatham yet, or any other town – Port Sarnia, Sandwich, London – but she was seven and she had travelled some miles into the bush with Papa when he trapped in the winter; she had seen the other farms along the line north of them. She could read the blazes on the trees and find the faint paths through the bush that would open suddenly upon sun-lit beaver meadows, some of them as big as the East Field. Beyond the Millar’s farm she had seen the ‘road’ that was said to meander all the way to Port Sarnia, and from there to London hundreds and thousands of miles to the east. She knew too that a great river swept by them no more than half-a-day’s walk from their own doorstep.\n\nSomeday Papa would take her with him.\n\nYes, little-blond-one-with-doe’s-feet, your Papa he likes Chatham very much. Not like it used to be. I was there a long time ago when the Yankees come across and my brothers all died in the field there by the antler river. All changed now. Full of niggers now.\n\nLil knew it was futile to ask but did so anyway. Old Samuels surprised her. Black men, he said. Come from where the Yankees live. Niggers is afraid of the Yankees. The Yankees takes their land, their houses, their women. They run away, a thousand days journey, all the way to Chatham.\n\nDo the white people there help them?\n\nOld Samuels paused. Then he began to laugh. Since he was blind, Lil was used to watching, not his blank eyes, but his mouth and nostrils. The laughter started with a trembling of the latter, spread to the wrinkling corners of the lips and shook without mercy the flaps of flesh below his chin.\n\nLil waited.\n\nNiggers run away. Ojibwa and Attawandaron just stands around and wonders what’ll happen next. Once we get some place, we don’t like to leave.\n\nLil wasn’t sure what he meant, but she found herself laughing along with him. Make me laugh, little one. Good for the rheumatism.\n\n2\n\nLil was not prepared for the Frenchman’s place. The customary procedure for the homesteader in the new territory was to clear room for his cabin near the front ‘line’ of the property, then proceed in a systematic fashion to open up ‘fields’ to the north, east and south. When at last Lil was allowed to accompany Anatole back to his place to fetch some garden greens for Mama, she was surprised to find their house somewhere near the centre of several haphazard ‘fields’ of no determinate shape. Several nut trees had been left standing, in random wonder, amidst the fledgling wheat and enthusiastic if undisciplined vegetable garden. All trees were to be cut down: that was the unspoken code here, one of the unarticulated motives that drove the homesteaders to the mutual service and support they required to survive.\n\nThe Frenchman’s cabin had begun life as a log structure of the typical rectangular design, but time, weather, whim and exigency had added their intentions to the original. Rooms of planks and split logs – packed with mortar and straw – jutted out, sagged, or lay half-built and dazed where the Frenchman’s imagination or optimism had failed him. No windows looked in or out. Against the east wall, roughly speaking, a lean-to of sorts had been erected wherein the ox-team of Bessie and Bert found little comfort at day’s end among the resident pigs and visiting barred rocks.\n\nMuch of the cooking and indeed family life took place outside the murky interior of the homestead. LaRouche, using the trade he had abandoned for farming after the war against the States, had built a fine stone oven-and-fireplace protected from the rain by a canvas affair rigged out of army tenting, deer-hides and one old sail salvaged, according to its owner, from the Battle of Put-In Bay. Here Madame LaRouche – referred to as Maman by her brood of eleven and as Fluffy by her husband in undisguised admiration for her three hundred pounds of flesh, sturdiness and good health – presided over hearth and oven with a temper that alternated between wheezing cheeriness and tongue-biting pique.\n\nLil could not for an instant take her eyes off Maman. She watched in awe as Maman punched and tormented the sourdough as if she were beating the belly of an obdurate husband, her great breasts rolling and protesting beneath the homespun smock she wore night and day. Lil shuddered whenever Maman’s hand, operating on its own, would shoot out or back to stun the cheek of anyone who ventured too close or dared too much. Later, she would see that same child comfortably housed in Maman’s lap, drifting into secure sleep.\n\nIn return for offerings from Papa’s hunting expeditions, Maman LaRouche made much of the staple food during the times when Mama was in bed. Preserves, jams, greens from her garden in season, salt-port and ‘bully beef’ from the venison Papa brought home. While the Frenchman himself did not hunt – having given up guns following his service – he usually went along on the shorter excursions to supply encouragement, unsolicited advice, and refreshments from his still in the bush. The older boys did not share their father’s pacifism.\n\nOften, then, Lil was left alone with Maman and her youngest children, all boys except for Madeleine who was just six and now the only girl. Maman soon took Lil under wing. She was teaching her to cook and spin and sew – all of which Lil had a talent for though not as much persistence and application as Maman would have hoped. But then Lil was not French. Often Maman sang while she worked – wistful melodies in her Norman tongue that seemed more sweetly fragile because they sailed towards serenity out of such an unnavigable bulk. Although Maman did not tell conventional stories, she had opinions on everyone and everything.\n\nThose Millars, she said with the usual hushed stridency reserved for such remarks, they’re gonna be trouble, wait and see. Scotch, the both of ’em. Give me the Irish any day, even your kind.\n\nFor good measure, Lil smiled back.\n\nAn’ you keep away from that Ol’ Sams, she said daily in another more sinister tone. That carrot of his may be shrivelled up but it’s still got juice in the root. You mind them hands too, little chickadee; believe-you-me, Maman knows all about them kind of paws.\n\nLil of course paid little direct attention to any of this, but she nodded and queried and did all she could to get Maman going.\n\nA pretty, fair thing like you oughta get away from this place as soon as you can. That’s Maman’s advice. Go to the city. Go to Chatham or Sandwich. They’re real nice places. Lots of people.\n\nThen Maman would be launched on a description of her brief but dazzling courtship with Corporal LaRouche of Malden, of the clapboard house they lived in, the dances they went to, the clothes they wore, the times they had before the Yankees came and the world collapsed. I said to Gaston, I’ll go with you to the bush, I’ll have your babies, I’ll clean your shit, but I’m not about to die out there without a priest at my side, prayin’ in my ear and rubbin’ my head with holy oil an’ smoothin’ my slide into Heaven.\n\nLil swallowed her gooseberry tart.\n\nI told him I don’t care if he has to hop to Sandwich on one snowshoe in a blizzard – a promise is a promise. Maman surprised the pastry dough with a sucker-punch to the gut.\n\nWhat’s a priest? Lil ventured, at last.\n\nA priest, it turned out, was a kind of preacher. Papa didn’t like preachers. Once, last summer, when Lil had been on her own in the withered garden near the ‘line’, watching the black ants ooze in and out of their honeycomb, she heard the crack of a twig along the Frenchman’s path. She looked up in time to see before her a large florid man dressed all in black. He was still puffing from the exertion of his trek through the bush. His blue eyes bounced like agates in his puffed face before they came to temporary rest on the rims of his cheeks. His smile was as broad as his belly.\n\nGood afternoon, little elf. The sound boomed, echoed, receded.\n\nLil stared.\n\nI am a man of God.\n\nI’ve come all the way from London.\n\nJust to see you.\n\nDo you know who God is, little one?\n\nWould you kindly tell your pa that the Methodist man is here.\n\nLil did not have to tell Papa. He had heard, even in the North Field, and had come striding past the cabin towards them. Lil knew enough to run. She heard Papa’s voice raised the way it was when he cursed Bert and Bessie or a stubborn ironwood. His axe flashed in the sun. However, the preacher was already scuttling like a duck into the safety of the Lord’s bush.\n\nLil wanted to ask Papa who God was.\n\nMama did not hate preachers as much. Sometimes, after being in her bed for several days, when some colour had come back into her eyes, she would reach under the little bed Papa had built especially for her and pull out the large, dark book she called the Bible. Lil watched, poised and alert, as Mama’s fingers made the pages, thin as bee’s wings, flutter and settle.\n\nThere are the words God gave us.\n\nRead me some of them, Mama.\n\nNot today, my sweet. Mama’s just a bit too tired. Tomorrow.\n\nPromise?\n\nPromise.\n\nThen, seeing the look in her child’s eye, she would close the book and in a reedy quaver begin to sing the spinning song, which reached Lil’s ear in this form:\n\nHi diddle dum, hi diddle dare-o\n\nHi diddly iddly, hi diddle air-o\n\nHi diddle diddly, hi diddle um\n\nAt first Lil would hum along, then gradually pick up the exotic, tongue-tumbling syllables one at a time, like stitches, giving to them whatever meaning the emotions of the moment allowed.\n\n3\n\nPapa was not back. Lil had been able to find enough small logs to keep the fire alive overnight though it was not banked properly, the cabin became suffocating in the late August heat. She made some tea, warmed up the soup and went into Mama’s room.\n\nMama spilled most of the soup. Lil held her hand to guide the tin cup to her lips. Mama closed her eyes.\n\nThe morning outside was beautiful. The sun, sensing the loss of its powers, steeped the windless air over the fields. High in the pines and arching elms, cicadas announced noon.\n\nWhen Lil came in, Mama was sitting in the rocker Papa had fashioned for her out of cedar. She gave Lil a wan smile and said: Would you help Mama with her hair? As her mother watched her in tender, wordless encouragement, Lil managed to heat a kettle of water and get it foaming with some of the soap Maman said she bought off the pedlar Papa had chased away. Mama leaned over, her brow at rest on the arm of the chair, her long hair caressing the floor. For a moment she seemed to be asleep, but when Lil began to pour the soft warm water over her, letting it fall gently back into the kettle, she murmured and her hand reached out to squeeze some part of Lil’s. How beautiful Mama’s hair was, its former glory regained as she lay back in the rocker and let the afternoon sun kindle and hearten and scatter praise where it would, and Lil took her mother’s bone-brush and stroked and stroked, and Mama’s eyes brightened before entering some dream where beauty was still possible. A long time after she said, Let’s have tea, little one.\n\nLil, excited, got out the china pot and the two tiny tea-cups with their matching blue saucers, stirred the slumbering fire and prepared tea just as she remembered Mama doing it. She even fetched the last of the little blueberry cakes Maman LaRouche had given them. But best of all Mama began to talk – in brief whispered phrases, the pauses like hours or seasons between them.\n\nThe place we come from, your Papa and me, is a long ways across the biggest ocean in the world. We were married there. We were very happy. But it wasn’t a happy land. The priests and the preachers didn’t get along. The crops failed, many times. We were hungry. Papa got angry and decided to leave. You were already tucked inside my belly. We went on a sailing ship three times bigger than this house. We packed everything we owned into two trunks they put in the hold.\n\nThe odour of hot ash and decay hung in the humid air outside the cabin and in the room itself, as if a whole summer’s burning was spreading like fungus in the thickening heat. Blue-bottles buzzed, unappeased.\n\nI figured we’d die on that ship, but we didn’t. We made it because we loved one another, we wanted happiness or death. Then after we got onto another ship, a smaller one, we sailed along the big lake just south of here, and a storm struck us down. The boat come apart in the waves near the long point. Dozens of people drowned. Papa and me were in the only boat that got to shore. We lost everything but our lives. Even the tools Papa bought for us in Quebec.\n\nThe room darkened steeply, the sun was eclipsed by the high horizon of the trees. Gently Lil unwound Mama’s fingers from the blue tea-cup, hearing her deep, anxious breathing. How Lil wished that Old Samuels would slip in unnoticed, and be in the mood to tell a long story. Mama could just rock there and listen and smile.\n\nBefore the White Mens come, this was a magic place, he would say, that ambiguous twinkle ever at the edge of his voice. The gods of the Mohawk and the gods of the Huron fought their great battles here among the spirits of my own people, the Attawandaron. In them days, the bears were as big as hickory trees. Pause: for the power of that image to take root. When the foreign gods left, they took all of the Hurons and most of my brothers with them. But the souls of my ancestors stayed right here where they been for a thousand generations. Attawandaron don’t run; they hang round, like Old Samuels and Sounder and Acorn. Even when them silly Ojibwa sells this land they don’t own to the White Mens, Old Samuels just laugh. And smoke his pipe – with White Mens’ tobacco stolen from our gods who gave it as a gift to all men.\n\nOld Samuels did not come. The smoke of early evening drifted in, adhered. Lil decided to let the fire go out; the air was already too warm. Leaving her mother asleep in the chair, Lil started up the ladder to the loft.\n\nLil. Don’t go up. Sleep with Mama tonight.\n\nBarely able to contain her excitement, Lil scrambled back down and then helped her mother towards her curtained-off cubicle. Her arms were thin as willow, the flesh draped over the bones. Lil slipped out of her cotton dress and under the sheet with Mama.\n\nOpen this, please, Mama said. In her hand, in the fading light, Lil could see a small box made of aromatic, in-laid woods. It was the most beautiful object she had ever seen. With her nimble fingers she tripped the slim gold latch, and the lid opened.\n\nMama held out a cameo pendant with a silver chain that shimmered in the gloaming. Fortuitously the last log in the fire burst into brief and final flame, and Lil was able to see that there was, beneath the cameo’s glaze, the merest sketch of a woman’s head: two or three quick but telling strokes. With a start, Lil recognized her own eyes.\n\nLily. Your grandmother.\n\nMama’s eyes filled with tears. She reached into the box again. I saved this, out of the storm. She held up a gold chain on the end of which dangled a slender cross no more than half an inch long. Instinctively Lil leaned forward and the crucifix settled on her throat as if it had always expected to be there.\n\nThen Mama fell back against her pillow. She crooked her left arm and Lil, as she had seen Maman LaRouche’s little ones do so often, slid into the embrace and held herself there as if the world would leave if she blinked.\n\nLil had left the curtain open. In the dark, the embers of the fire glowed, blood-red, and succumbed without a murmur. The night-air, remembering that it was almost September, turned as chill and sharp as the sabre-shaped moon guiding it. The season’s heat and smoke and ash rose with it: distilled, crystalline, translated.\n\nWhen Lil woke, the sun was already above the tree-line, sifting through the east window and toasting her feet. She had been kept warm throughout the night by the final, fierce heat of her mother’s will. Beside her now, that flesh lay as cold as the ice that clenched the streams of mid-December.\n\n3\n\n1\n\nSometimes Lil tried hard to remember Mama exactly as she was before she took to her bed and left. It wasn’t easy. In summer, the wheat in the East Field turned golden brown under the lazing sun. The LaRouche boys came over to help them cut and thresh it. Lil sat in the shade of the big maple near the house and let the kernels whisper through her fingers like Indian beads. Papa smiled. Luc and Jean-Pierre watched her as they worked. When she turned her own gaze back on them, they looked away sharply. Lil felt something fresh, unruly and alien surge up through her chest: she wondered at it but gave it no name or image. In the fall, the trees that were not pine gave forth their second bloom – brighter and more prodigal than the green gifts of April: like a rush of blood against the sudden foreboding of cold. The leaves swam – dizzying, breathless – and drowned in pools of their own composition. For a while even the bush relented a little: the eye could meander now, reconnoitre, improvise, surprise the sun here and there in hollows of snow, loiter among shape and shadow where the winter light married the dark configurations of trees. In the winter you breathed out more than in.\n\nThey put Mama’s body – carefully wrapped in a white sheet of the softest cotton from Maman LaRouche’s cedar chest – in the ground on a slight knoll where the East Field was about to join the North one. Jean-Pierre and Anatole dug the hole; Maman sent everyone out of the house while she dressed Mama’s body. Papa and the Frenchman and Luc sat in the lean-to shed sipping from a jug, murmuring occasionally in low voices, but mostly staring straight ahead into the bush. Once Lil thought she heard her mother’s name spoken – ‘Kathleen’ – like a sort of unintentional exhalation of breath, but she wasn’t sure. The best part was when Maman surrounded her with her generous arms, clapped her close and fast, and crooned some soothing French lament just for her. After a time she was able to cry.\n\nOld Samuels came with his nephews Sounder and Acorn and, to Lil’s astonishment, a tribe of wives and children who stayed well behind them with heads down, though still resplendent in their skins, secret furs and black-and white featherage. The Millars and even the two new families from the North section came also. Lil had never before seen so many people gathered in one place. She held Papa’s hand tightly, and he squeezed back, hurting her, gently. Her heart reared through its sadness.\n\nMr. Millar stepped forward, opened a black book, read some words from it that the wind caught with ease and carried off. Maman suddenly burst into sobs which she made no effort to staunch. They rose and fell drowning the Bible words of Mr. Millar, vanquishing the wind-sound in the pines, and Lil knew even then that Maman LaRouche was weeping for them all.\n\nOld Samuels began to hum from somewhere deep in his body, letting the music of it find its own course and pace. The gravesite became quiet; the wind shrank. Old Samuels’ mouth opened and the music of his lamentation found syllables and eerie repetitions that might have been words though no one present had ever heard the language they had borrowed. His blank eyes like death’s pennies began to shuffle in time with the rising/falling cadences of his song. He turned his ancient face upward, and the syllables rolled in his mouth as in water, muted and infinitely mysterious. His whole frame tensed, expectant, as if he had been asking some question over and over. He turned and looked towards Papa and Lil. He smiled as only a man without eyes can smile: with every feature of his face. In English he said: The gods are listening; that is all we can ask.\n\nMany times, of course, during that long winter when Papa was away trapping or hunting, Lil asked who God was, thinking of Mama lying unattended in that cold oven under the snow. But Maman used the question to get herself started on her obsessive musing about priests and the promises of faithless husbands. Papa, who was always too tired to talk after his journeys, would just grunt in an almost hurting tone, Go ask that Millar, he knows all about everythin’. Then he would be off.\n\nOff to Chatham, Old Samuels would shake his head sadly. Plenty bad people in Chatham, for sure. Or when Papa sometimes pointedly picked up his gun, leather pouches and haversack, and said to Lil, Better tell them lady deer to stay back in the bush, darlin’, your Papa’s comin’, Old Samuels would whisper after him, \"Your Papa’s gone to Chatham to hunt bucks,\" and chortle.\n\nOn the subject of God, though, Old Samuels was eager and loquacious. White Mens has the silliest ideas about the gods. It takes us Indians a day to stop laughin’ when we hear about it. For sure. First they say there’s only one god. If that’s true then the white god must fight with himself. Anybody with ears and eyes (he’d always pause here for a tiny ironic smile) knows about the god in the thundercloud whose voice speaks blackly to the quiet gods in the lake and the summer creeks. And the god of the gentle winds has no love for the god of the blizzard that tears the trees in half and buries the earth. Anybody knows there’s the good gods and the wicked gods, the guardian spirits and the demons that lurk everywhere. We must listen to the good gods to keep them on our side: they will help those who listen for them. Remember that, little one. But we must also help the gods. Sometimes the demons are too strong and the good gods go into hiding. That is a sad time for the world.\n\nWhen Lil mentioned that Maman LaRouche told her that Mama was in heaven, Old Samuels chuckled bitterly. That woman talks silliness. I tell her I come to her funeral and dance on her grave, and she throws a pot at me. Me, a man with no eyes. The gods made her miss, for sure.\n\nWhat about heaven?\n\nYour Mama, who was the dearest White Womens in this world, is not in heaven, little dancing one. That Millar, he tells me heaven is a pretty house with beads and ornaments on it up over the moon and the stars. That is silliness. The good gods would not build their house up there, they live here in the green world and in the stars themselves. Your Mama’s body is under the earth, but the guardian gods have taken her spirit with them. Wherever they are, she will be also. If your eyes and ears are listening to the good gods, you will hear her voice among theirs. In that way she will always be near you. You must not listen to the silliness of that Millar.\n\nHow do you know the good gods’ll speak to me?\n\nAh, that is easy. Because you sing their song, and you dance, and you are happy even when you’re sad. And you make Old Samuels happy.\n\nI can’t dance, said Lil.\n\nOld Samuels paused to light his pipe. Lil thought he was finished talking for the day. But you can. I hear dancing in your voice; every day.\n\nLil did not like to be teased. For a while she sulked and hated Old Samuels. She waited in the woods by the gravesite for a demon to whisper something outrageous to her. The old man took no notice. He stayed his usual time and without saying goodbye made his way across the field towards his great-nephew at the edge of the bush.\n\nOne night, alone in her loft, Lil woke to the harvest moon igniting the straw at her feet. She caught herself humming:\n\nHi diddle dum, hi diddle dare-o\n\nHi diddly iddly, hi diddle air-o\n\nHi diddle diddly, hi diddle um\n\nSoon she felt the presence of a second part in flawless harmony with her own. She stopped. Her mother’s voice continued, as elfin and crystal as the moon’s.\n\nLil was often alone. But then she had been as long as she could remember, even when Mama was here. She was not lonely though. She could sit beside her father while he chopped wood or cursed after Bert and Bessie – for hours without the need to speak. Often she hummed, sang songs or made them up as she watched whatever rhythmic, repetitive scenes were being played out before her. By herself in the fields she would lie on her back and dream the clouds into shapes of her wishing, or follow, minute by minute, the extravagant exit of the sun as it boiled and dissolved or tossed itself on the antlered tree-line and uttered its blood. The few acres that demarcated her world pulsated with sights, sounds, smells; with minute dramas of birth, struggle and demise. And now there were the guardians and the demons to listen for, the good gods in their hiding to be touched and revealed.\n\nThis bush don’t go on forever, Old Samuels said that spring, sensing restlessness in the girl. Half a day’s walk towards the sunset and you’ll come to the River of Light that’s been flowin’ there since the last time the wild gods stirred the earth like a soup and started it over again. Two days walk towards the North Star where that river begins and there’s the Freshwater Sea of the Hurons, bigger than the lakes on the moon. Someday you’ll get to see them. For sure.\n\nI already have, thought Lil. She had been dreaming of water ever since the first snow had widened the woods in October. In the midst of the bush, beyond the last blazed trail, she would suddenly see before her a stretch of blue, unrippled water, without edges or end, clear as cadmium and silent as if waiting for the wind to be invented or a sun to come birthing out of it. Then a crow would caw and the snow-bound trees pop back into view. In the early spring the bubbling of Brown Creek below the East Field would unexpectedly become magnified as if it were a torrent ripping out the throat of a narrows, roaring triumph and terror until Lil stopped her ears, knowing somehow that she had transgressed, that the demons had indeed inherited part of the earth.\n\nYou’re like Old Samuels, little one. Sometimes you know.\n\nI’ll ask the guardian to bring back your eyes, Lil said.\n\nSo I can see all the wickedness and all the silliness again? It’s not like olden times any more. Two days walk south of here and they say you’ll come to roads chopped through the bush, and White Mens drives his wagons on roads made of dead trees, and Chatham is bigger than ten Ojibwa villages and the niggers prowls at night with eyes as white as a cat’s.\n\nWhy does Papa go there?\n\n\"I like your Papa. He’s a good White Mens. He gave me my name: Old Samuels. I tell him my name is Uhessemau, he says ‘I can’t say that so I’ll just call you Old Samuels, all right?’ I like the name Old Samuels, so I keep it. Redmen don’t fuss about names; we have many names before we die. If I die with Old Samuels, well that’s okay with me.\" The old man puffed on his pipe and thought about the many names he had lived through.\n\nLily was only half-surprised , then, when Papa appeared that evening at dusk, his haversack full of store-bought bacon and sausages, and said: Start packin’, little one, we’re goin’ up to Port Sarnia to watch the ceremonies.\n\n2\n\nIt was Indian summer. The leaves had turned but not fallen. No wind disturbed their shining in a sun that blazed with more hope than heat. Along the forest track, purged of summer’s mosquitoes, autumnal shadows stretched and stilled, preserved in light. Air in the lungs was claret, flensing. Lil breathed and strode. Papa measured his own practiced stride to hers; she floated in his grateful wake. She was holding his hand as surely as if they were touching.\n\nThey had left home while the sun was still a promise in the east, and the path linking the four farms to the north was sullen with shadow. Lil had never been north of Millar’s farm; Lil had never seen the River. In the absence of birdsong this day, her heart fluttered and drummed. The beaten path, so familiar to their feet, disappeared. The sun had risen but not above the tree-line; there was just enough light to see the blazes, newly slashed, that marked the bush-trail ahead. They were going north, through nowhere to somewhere. At last.\n\nJust as the sun bested the tree-line far to their right, they were joined by Old Samuel’s nephews – Metagomin or Acorn, and Pwau-na-shig or Sounder. They slipped behind Lil without a word. Only when they stopped much later for a drink from a shallow spring and a brief rest did she notice that they were not in their hunting attire. Their red and blue sashes against the white calico of their capots were dazzling, even amongst the maples and elms. Like Papa they carried haversacks stuffed with supplies. Sounder, as usual, grinned broadly at Lil, giving her a glimpse of the merriment that must have once quickened the eyes of Old Samuel himself. Acorn, according to his custom, nodded at Lil without changing the impassive, set features of his face. Lil stared at the grimace of the black squirrel peering out of the fur on Acorn’s shoulder.\n\nTo Papa they spoke in Pottawatomie, the speech (according to Old Samuels) their parents had adopted when to utter Attawandaron or Petun meant death. No one was alive now who remembered those sweet/sharp sounds. Lil thought sadly of her mother’s lullaby tongue. Sounder was chattering away to Papa like a jay in the soprano range. Already Lil could pick out some words; the pitch of rising excitement was plain. She detected presents (several times), white soldier, big river and village. Papa replied laconically, half listening as he did with Lil. But he was happy. His large hands cradled the back of his head, his eyes glowed with something remembered and anticipated. Lil found herself beside him. She put her hand on his knee.\n\nSounder had switched to English. Little-maiden-with-the-goldenrod-hair is a brave walker, no?\n\nThe ghost of a hand bent over hers…\n\nBig white general only give presents to squaws with black hair. White generals plenty fussy ’bout presents.\n\n…brushed and settled.\n\nSounder like all squaws; give presents to everybody. His eyes danced at the thought. Even Acorn, he laughed, and did a little jig around his unimpressed cousin. The squirrel seemed curious.\n\nReady to move? Papa said, in Acorn’s direction.\n\nSome time after noon, they turned north-west, still following the blazed trail. To the west lay the River. Lil strained to hear its voice. The bush was awesomely silent. The odd crow, unmated, cawed in complaint; a bear crumpled the dry brush nearby, seeking the late berries, the crab-apple windfalls, a sour-cherry unravaged by headlong flocks. Unobserved, squirrels broke open the chestnut, hazel, beech, walnut, acorn. In the pines, steadily diminishing now, chickadees tumbled out of tune. More and more, there were large natural clearings – beaver meadows or sandy patches where the hundred-foot oaks and pines had given in to be replaced by clans of cherry, crab and snow-apple which, though silent and satiate now, in the spring must have emblazoned the bush with immaculate flame.\n\nMostly, though, they heard their own footfalls in sunny glade or pillared gloom. Sounder, impatient with Papa’s considered pace, scooted off into the semi-dark and popped up in front of them with a red squirrel in his hand kicking out the last of its life.\n\nFor supper, he explained, setting off again, guided by his own compass.\n\nThey came not to the River but to a genuine road, a fifteen-foot swath cut through the bush, the stumps pulled out and smoothed over with sand. Across the myriad streams trickling west towards the river, bridges of demi-logs had been crudely constructed. Lil realized that a horse and cart could travel here. No vehicle approached. They followed the road due north until the sun began to tilt sharply to their left. It will sink soon, right in the River, Lil thought.\n\nAre we near the water? she said, no longer able to keep this feeling to herself. How she wished she were Sounder, able to dance sideways and chatter jay-like to any tree that would listen.\n\nPapa increased his pace. Acorn muttered his disapproval. After a while Sounder said quietly to Lil: River of Light is just through the trees there; we been following it; but no path, even for a brave walker.\n\nLil looked longingly through the trees to her left but saw only black irregular columns fluted by the sun behind them. Her disappointment was interrupted by Sounder’s exclamation.\n\nHere’s the farms.\n\nNever had Lil seen such an expanse of open space unimpeded by trees. To the east of the road the bush had been, in typical pioneer fashion, denuded of all timber, all brush. Not even a windbreak separated one farm from another. The stumps of the slain trees had been piled lengthwise to create makeshift fences demarcating fields, properties, gardens, dooryards. At first such angularity seemed alien to Lil, even painful to look at. But the sight of cabins, several of them the largest buildings she had ever seen, ranged neatly back from the road in neighbourly view of one another, was overwhelming. She barely noticed that the sun was fading quickly, the dusk rising from the newly ploughed fields already burgeoning with fall wheat, its fern-green haze lending the last of its light to this miraculous community.\n\nThe others were apparently impervious to miracles for they had moved well ahead of her and were stopped, waiting for her, in front of the third cabin, the smoke from its fieldstone chimney lingering and friendly in the motionless air. It was only when Lil came up to them that she glanced away from the farms to the west again and discovered that the bush had, for a stretch of two or three hundred yards, been cleared all the way down to what could only be called the River.\n\nThis way, Papa commanded as she stood staring into the scarlet, gouged eye of the sun.\n\nMrs. Partridge was really very kind to her. She bathed Lil’s blistered feet in soda water, rubbed them with ewe’s grease, and put into her moccasins little pads of the softest cotton in the world. Store-bought at Cameron’s, she said with restrained pride, up to Port Sarnia. After the meal of quail roasted in a genuine iron stove, potatoes, squash, corn-bread with molasses, tart apple-pie and mugs of warm goat’s milk, the men slouched together by the fire, lit up their pipes, and conversed partly in English and partly in Pottawatomie. They were soon joined by two sturdy neighbours with buffed red cheeks and flaming hair. Mrs. Partridge and her two elder daughters sat near the stove in the kitchen, one carding wool, the other preparing to ‘full’ several man-sized macintoshes. Lil had many questions to ask but no sentences in which to express them. She listened, though, her eye never leaving the printed calico dresses of the elder daughters and the rounded, urgent flesh so restless beneath them.\n\nThe Partridges had a small shed where you went to relieve yourself. Lil left the door ajar; the moon poured its amber warmth through the wedge in the tree-line. Lil did not go back to the cabin right away; she walked past it and straight onto the moon’s carpet. She heard the River just ahead in the darkness behind the beam of light. Strange sand-grasses caressed her bare legs. She came to the edge. The voice of the River filled her ears. On either side of the brilliant filament she could see only a blackness deeper and more resonant than the darkest sky in January. The weight of the moon was a feather on its face. It roared with the hoarse breath of a stag plunging through blood-soaked snow towards absolute cold. In it, Lil thought she detected longing, anticipation, and the joyous ache of seeking what always lay a handspan ahead. Under the circling stars, Lil listened for the language it used, but it was no tongue she had ever\n\nheard.\n\nFrom her cot near the board wall that separated the sleeping area from the main room, Lil tried to catch the meaning of the scattered words spoken by the men.\n\nThem surveyors was through here again last week, Michael.\n\nI heard, said Papa’s voice, barely recognizable.\n\nRumours floatin’ about, up an’ down the line. Talk of makin’ this here territory a county, they say.\n\nWhite fella draws lines in the bush, said Sounder, making no attempt to disguise his disdain for the irremediable folly of the intruders.\n\nLil dozed. Dreamed of water bigger than counties, borderless and infinitely serene.\n\nIt’s all right, I reckon they’re all asleep by now.\n\nWent to the meetin’ down at Chatham. Things is gettin’ worse, we hear tell. Some new law comin’ in over there about returnin’ the poor devils. All legal-like, too.\n\nSun-in-bitch Yankees, Sounder added.\n\nOver a hundred come across since August. We’re lookin’ for a new route, Harry. Them raiders is gettin’ smarter by the hour. New houses, too. Reckon things could get real bad by summer.\n\nThe committee can count on us.\n\nDamn right. None of us forgets what it was like to be a Highlander under George’s boot. What do you want us to do?\n\nSun-in-bitch English!\n\nLil was swimming, her hair fanned out like a parasol in the blue wind.\n\nOnce again they rose and were well on their way before sunrise. But this time Lil knew more about what lay ahead. From various overheard conversations at the Partridges she learned that the village of Port Sarnia sat less than two hours walk along River Road to the north; and that one was not to be surprised by periodic farms in lee of the road, though the spread of a dozen at what the locals called Bloomfield was the largest group below the Port itself. Here and there slash-roads were cut eastward through the woods so that one could imagine not merely strips of humanity but blocks or successive waves challenging the hidden heart at the centre of the territory, known only to the natives and the hibernating bears said to rule there unmolested. At the end of River Road the bush would relent and they would come to a huge clearing where the river eased into a wide bay, the site of the new town, and behind it to the south and east the Ojibwa, or Chippewa, Reserve where several thousand Indians lived in scattered equanimity. What they were heading towards, what Sounder couldn’t stop dancing about, was the arrival of the government ship for the annual dispersal of the presents given in exchange for lands of which the aboriginal owners had already been dispossessed. And Lil watched it all come about amidst the wonder of being eight.\n\n3\n\nJust moments before Lil and the others emerged from the bush into the misty dawn-light, the steamer Hastings weighed anchor and slipped from its overnight mooring in the bay towards the river bank below the town. Major John Richardson, of literary and military fame, who had joined the official expedition at Windsor on October 9, 1948, has left a vivid account of those gift-giving ceremonies at the Reserves on Walpole Island and at Port Sarnia. The weather was flawless: the sky unscarred by cloud, the sun brilliant as a rubbed coin, the wind at ease in the sea-grasses along the shoreline. As"
