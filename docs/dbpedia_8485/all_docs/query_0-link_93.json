        "text": "Nebraska Minor League Baseball\n\nWestern League 1952 Lincoln Athletics\n\nImage courtesy Dan Bretta\n\nThe Western League was a class \"A\" league in 1952. In 1952 the Pacific Coast League was classified as an \"Open\" league in anticipation of it becoming a third major league. Of course the moves of the Dodgers to Los Angeles and the Giants to San Francisco stopped the move of the PCL to major league status. There were two \"AAA\" leagues, two \"AA\" leagues and four class \"A\" leagues in 1952.\n\nWestern League 1952 Standings\n\nPresident: Senator Edwin C.
