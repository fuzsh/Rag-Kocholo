He married Rebecca Brookes of Hathern in Loughborough on 2 May 1830. They had 3 children, Henry 1831, John 1835 (my g.grandfather) and Rowland (who died in infancy). It appears that Rebecca died sometime before the 1861 census as Charles is recorded in 1861 as Widower, age 58 lodging with Richard Barton of Nottingham Road, Loughborough. He is later recorded in the 1881 census as lodging with Mary Armstrong in Dovecot Street, Hathern. He is still widowerer and appears to have moved back to his town of birth. Also lodging at that address was Charles Hickingbottom (born abt 1841 Hathern). That same Charles Hickingbottom was informant at the registration of Charles Gutteridge's death on 29th Sep 1881.\n\nTwo requests:\n\n1. Could sks with access to Leicestershire 1841 or 1851 census please let me know what we learn about the family at those dates?\n\n2. Is there anyone who can establish something more about Charles parents, John Gutteridge and Sarah. Where and when were they born, where did they marry?\n\nPerhaps someone can help me get back before Charles Gutteridge to John or earlier.\n\nHello, Looking on LDS for a marriage between John and Sarah in the period 1780 to 1800 in Leicester I could only see 1 possibility.\n\nJohn Guttridge\n\nCh: 27 JAN 1754 Walton On The Wolds, Leicester\n\nFather: Samuel Guttridge\n\nMother: Ann Taylor\n\nSpouse: Sarah Lines\n\nMarriage: 21 JAN 1781\n\nSource Information:\n\nFilm Number: 457931\n\n...........................\n\n*if this is the right family these are John's siblings all born Walton On The Wolds to Samuel & Ann.\n\n1.
