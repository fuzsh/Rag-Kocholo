        "text": "Marion Danne \"Bill\" Adair (February 10, 1913 - June 17, 2002) was an American coach and interim manager in Major League Baseball. A second baseman, he was a career minor-league player who never rose above the Class AA level but who spent 21 years as a manager in the minors.\n\nBorn in Mobile, Alabama, Adair was a skipper in the Braves organization (he managed farm clubs for all three cities the Braves played in), as well as the Detroit Tigers, San Diego Padres, Montreal Expos, and the Chicago White Sox organizations. He compiled a 1,611-1,305 (.552) record in the minors, but his managing career in the major leagues was limited to ten games with the 1970 White Sox. Skipper Don Gutteridge was fired September 3 with 26 games left in the season. Adair then compiled a 4-6 (.400) record before Chuck Tanner was appointed permanent manager on September 14, 1970. The White Sox lost 106 games that season.\n\nAdair also was a major league coach for the Braves (1962; 1966), White Sox (1970) and Expos (1976).\n\nHe died in Bay Minette, Alabama at age 89 in 2002.\n\nReference[]\n\nReichler, Joseph, ed.
