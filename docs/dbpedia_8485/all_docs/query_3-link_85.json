The area was taped off amid the incident.\n\nAmbulances could also be seen lining the streets as specialist crews went down to the river. Witnesses saw rescue teams on the water in a small boat behind the Lock Keeper pub.\n\nOne witness on social media said: \"My heart was in my throat, we passed as the first police were arriving on scene and circled back, there were firemen down in the water at that point.\"\n\nThe Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service (GMFRS) confirmed that fire engines from Bury and Broughton, along with technical response and water rescue units were called to the scene.\n\nA spokesperson for Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service (GMFRS) said: “Shortly after 8.10pm this evening (Monday 5 August), two fire engines from Bury and Broughton fire stations, one fire engine and the water incident unit from Heywood, the technical response unit from Ashton and the air support unit were called to reports of three people in the River Irwell.\n\n“Crews arrived quickly and used specialist water rescue equipment including a short extension ladder to help two men and one woman in the water. One man was transferred into the care of North West Ambulance Service and taken to hospital. Crews were in attendance for roughly one hour.”"
