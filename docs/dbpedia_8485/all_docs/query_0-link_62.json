        "text": "Blogger’s note: I haven’t blogged in a while for a couple of reasons.\n\nFirstly, my jobs have kept me busy on nights and weekends since the start of 2013 and it picked up more when a couple of folks I work with left and put more on my plate at the full-time radio gig. Add to that PA duties at Pittsburg High School (and a surprisingly few rainouts during what was a wet baseball season), and I’ve been busy.\n\nSecondly I came to the realization that writing is not a relaxing exercise for me… at least not as much as actually relaxing with a good book, a DVR full of shows recorded while I’ve been working or just visiting my folks and friends.\n\nThose reasons, along with finding time to do laundry (a must), clean (been a bit lax there) and sleep (mandatory), and the old Highway 69 Blues has been put on the back burner.\n\nBut now that high school and junior college baseball season has come to a close, I have more free time. Out of the most recently-concluded high school baseball campaign a blog post has germinated."
