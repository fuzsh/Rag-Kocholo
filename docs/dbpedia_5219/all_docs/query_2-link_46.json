        "text": "The controversies and provocations generated by the West and its media over depictions of Prophet Muhammad (SAW) are not only related to recent caricatures or cartoons but are also about the display of historical artwork. Recently, many Western organisations, newspapers, magazines, social networks and even websites organised seminars and events like the cartoon \"Everybody Draw Mohammed Day!\" to hurt and provoke the Muslim world. Muslims believe that visual depictions of all the Prophets should be prohibited and are particularly averse to visual representations of Prophet Muhammad (SAW). The key concern is that the use of images can encourage idolatry. Islam does not allow the depictions of Prophet Muhammad (SAW); to do so goes against the faith of the Muslims and hurts their emotions. This article will focus on providing an analysis of the distorted images, fabricated views, and overgeneralizations which typically characterize Western representation of the Prophet (SAW) of Islam with reference to some particular incidents, chiefly the Charlie Hebdo controversy, Danish newspaper, controversial movie Innocence of Muslims, animated films and social networks. This analysis comprises of works by both Western and Muslim thinkers; it also includes biased and moderate/ fair views depicted in the Western media.\n\nThis article provides a textual and visual analysis of Hirsi Ali and van Gogh’s controversial short film Submission (2004) and Marc Forster’s The Kite Runner (2007). Emphasis is placed on rhetorical and plot strategies, aimed at reinforcing unproductive Orientalist stereotypes of Islam and Muslims. The aim of this analysis is to find out how Muslims and Islam are presented in Submission and The Kite Runner, based on E. Said&#39;s (1978) work “Orientalism” and to identify Theo van Gogh&#39;s assassination, influenced public attitudes towards Muslims. The following means are used to reach the aim: to analyze the concept of Orientalism and stereotypes, connections with the media and the influence of popular culture on their expression; to find out the role of the Muslim minority in the process of constructing social reality (stereotypes); to analyze how Muslims and Islam are presented in the films Submission and The Kite Runner. Summarizing the analysis of the film Submission, it shoul...\n\nIn 1976 The Message, the first feature film about Muhammad, had its premiere. It was a very special film because as a result of the restrictions imposed by some prominent Muslim legal scholars, the Prophet was not depicted, nor his wives nor his cousin Ali. After an analytical impression of the contents of the film, the article discusses the relationship between the image of Muhammad in The Message and the pictures of the Prophet delineated by Muslim tradition and modern biographies of him. It then considers some new declarations made by Muslim religious authorities in 2002 and 2004 about films dealing with the life of the Prophet. Finally attention is given to the consequences of the rules announced by Muslim religious scholars concerning the image of the Prophet and to the acceptance of such an image by non-Muslims.\n\nBook includes selected writings about the Prophet Muhammad from writers as in the table of contents below: The Koran: Commonly Called The Alkoran of Mohammed 1 George Sale ii The Hero As Prophet – Mahomet 5 Thomas Carlyle iii Histoire de la Turquie 23 Alphonse Marie Louis de Lamartine iv Mohammed: The Man and His Faith 25 Tor Andrae v Muhammad: Prophet and Statesman 34 W.
