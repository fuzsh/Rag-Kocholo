        "text": "Talent, skill, passion, and ambition- these are the traits that many young men and women around the world possess, but often lack the opportunities to capitalize on for a number of reasons. Whether it is their location, economic situation or a myriad of other unfortunate circumstances- these diamonds in the rough often fail in obtaining the necessary education, guidance, tools, and support that allow them to shine and flourish.\n\nMoustapah Akkad would never forget his humble beginnings, nor his difficulties in pulling himself out of poverty and obscurity. It was his profound humility, and a deep appreciation for the opportunities offered him, that compelled him to consistently give back to those in need. He would never turn away an aspiring filmmaker that sought his advice. He supported numerous causes and organizations that promoted the arts, and on many occasions, even contributed directly to projects and filmmakers in need. Unfortunately, when Moustapha Akkad’s life was tragically ended in 2005, the world lost a noble and tireless champion for this cause and pursuit.\n\nFortunately his personal legacy lives on, in his beautiful work, and in the paths of numerous young filmmakers that have been inspired by his example. Unfortunately, many of these aspiring young filmmakers lack the opportunities to join the global exchange of ideas that is Cinema as it’s finest.\n\nThe Moustapha Akkad Endowment for The School of Cinematic Arts will be a vehicle to continue his dream, and allow future filmmakers to have an opportunity that they would otherwise never have. In this way, we continue his work, and honor his memory.\n\nWith a donation to The Moustapha Akkad Endowment for The School of Cinematic Arts you can continue his legacy of giving future generations a chance to improve the world we live in through the experience of cinema.\n\nWith your donation, you help fund an endowment that will send one deserving young filmmaker a year to the USC School of Cinematic Arts Summer Program. This one of a kind experience will help give voice to a developing talent that would otherwise go unheard. You will be directly involved in helping to build the career of future visionaries and artists.\n\nThere is no better way to celebrate and memorialize the life of a true pioneer and trailblazer.\n\nThank you for Your Donation."
