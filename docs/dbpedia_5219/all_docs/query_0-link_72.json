        "text": "The maker of the \"Halloween\" horror films, Mustafa Akkad, was buried in his home city of Aleppo, north Syria, on Sunday, two days after he died of wounds suffered in the Jordanian hotel bombings.\n\nEPA\n\nArab actors, Syrian Cabinet ministers and about 2,000 people attended the ceremonies at Aleppo's Al Rawdah Mosque and Al Jadidah cemetery. The chief family representative was his son, Malek.\n\nAkkad's daughter, Rima Akkad Monla, 34, died in one of the suicide attacks in Amman on Wednesday night that killed 60 people, including the bombers.\n\nShe was buried on Thursday in her husband's hometown of Tripoli, north Lebanon.\n\nAkkad, 75, who lived in Los Angeles, died on Friday in a Jordanian hospital. He had gone to Jordan to meet his daughter and attend a wedding.\n\n\"He was not only a victim of terrorism, but also a big loss to Arab culture,\" Syrian Information Minister Mahdi Dakhlallah said in Sunday's funeral. The Al Qaida in Iraq group has claimed responsibility for the attacks.\n\nAkkad's coffin was draped in the Syrian flag and bore a wreathe from President Bashar Assad.\n\nThe eldest of eight children, Akkad was born in Aleppo in 1930. He came to California in 1950 to study film making and took a degree in theatre arts from the University of California, Los Angeles."
