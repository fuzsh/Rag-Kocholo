        "text": "STEVE INSKEEP, host:\n\nOne person at the scene of the bombings was Moustapha Akkad. He was born in Syria but came to the United States and went to work in Hollywood as a film producer. He may have been best-known for producing the \"Halloween\" horror movies, but in 1976, he also produced a film called \"The Message.\" The movie starred Anthony Quinn, and it told the story of the prophet Muhammad. Moustapha Akkad said he did that film for personal reasons. He said, `Being a Muslim myself, I felt it was my obligation, my duty, to tell the truth about Islam and bridge this gap to the West.' The suicide bombers who killed dozens in Jordan this week also injured Moustapha Akkad, and today he died of his wounds. The attacks also killed Akkad's American-born daughter.\n\nCopyright © 2005 NPR. All rights reserved.
