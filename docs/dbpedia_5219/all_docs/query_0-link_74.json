        "text": "THE producer of the Halloween horror movie series, has died from wounds sustained in the triple hotel bombings in Jordan.\n\nSyrian-born Moustapha Akkad, 75, who lived in Los Angeles, died at 7.30am local time in a Jordanian hospital, said Dr Yousef Qisous in Amman.\n\nAkkad's sister, Leila, confirmed her brother's death.\n\nHis daughter, Rima Akkad Monla, 34, also died in one of the explosions that rocked three US-based hotels in the Jordanian capital Amman on Wednesday night, according to her mother and Akkad's ex-wife, Patricia Akkad.\n\nRima's body was flown to Lebanon and buried in Tripoli after Friday prayers in the city's main mosque. Her husband, Ziad Monla, and other relatives were joined at the funeral by former Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati.\n\nThree suicide bombers hit the Grand Hyatt, Radisson SAS and Days Inn hotels in Amman, killing 60 people, including the three suicide bombers.\n\nOfficials suspect Iraqi involvement in the attacks, which were claimed by al-Qaeda in Iraq.\n\nAkkad's sister said the world was saddened by the tragic death of her brother and called for an end to terrorist attacks on civilians.\n\n\"I feel sad and the world feels sorrow with us. This kind of incident rarely happens, but it has happened with Moustapha Akkad,\" said Leila Akkad.\n\nShe spoke from Amman where she had flown to be with her wounded brother.\n\nMoustapha Akkad, best known for producing all eight films in the Halloween franchise, also produced and directed The Message (1977) and Lion of the Desert (1981). Both starred Anthony Quinn.\n\nBorn in the northern Syrian city of Aleppo in July 1930, Akkad gained fame as a creative movie director and producer in the Arab world and in the West.\n\nIn an interview a few years ago Akkad said that, before he left Syria for America in 1950, his father gave him $US200 ($A275) and a copy of the Koran, the Muslim holy book. He said his main reason for going to the US was to study film-making.\n\nHe earned a degree in theatre arts from the University of California, Los Angeles, then went to work as a production assistant for renowned director Sam Peckinpah on the Western, Ride the High Country in 1962.\n\nAkkad's most serious and creative efforts showed in Lion of the Desert and The Message, dramas about the history of Islam.\n\nThe Message, a film about the Prophet Muhammad, was widely acclaimed in the Middle East.\n\n- AP"
