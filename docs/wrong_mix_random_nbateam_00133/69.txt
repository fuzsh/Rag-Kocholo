All business! Rachel Zoe looks smart and classy in grey pant suit and white shirt as she attends boutique opening

You can always count on celebrity stylist Rachel Zoe to look sharp and on Saturday, she didn't disappoint.

The 42-year-old and her husband of 16 years Rodger Berman made an appearance at the Naked Princess flagship boutique opening in Beverly Hills, California.

And in true Rachel form, she chose a sophisticated pant suit ensemble, which she paired with a crisp white shirt with black trim, a black tie and black platform heels.

But Rachel always makes sure to add some pizazz to her outfits.

This time, the mother of two accessorized with a Givenchy handbag that featured a vicious barking dog.

But despite the odd choice of bag, it didn't seem to distract any of the other attendees such as Ali Larter, who posed for pictures alongside Rachel.

The Heroes actress wore a long sleeveless dress with a funky striped pattern and an orange print on the bottom.

Rachel also posed with Rodger and posted an Instagram of themselves looking cosy at the event.

'Way fun @nakedprincess launch party...beyond gorgeous new boutique!! #nakedprincess#livinginstyle#laliving xoRZ.'

Rodger looked handsome in a simple white button down and blue slacks.

Rachel and Rodger are often times seen out together with theirthree-year-old son Skyler either at the farmers market or going for a frozen yogurt.

They welcomed five-month old Kaius Jagger, or Kai for short, last December.

But it appeared the couple left the children at home for an evening out together.
