        "text": "On April 10, The Women’s Cancer Research Fund (WCRF) held “An Unforgettable Evening” at the Beverly Wilshire, A Four Seasons Hotel. Hosted by Tig Notaro, the event has been raising money to benefit the Women’s Cancer Research Fund, a program of the Breast Cancer Research Foundation, for the past 25 years. WCRF was founded by Jamie Alexander Tisch, Kate Capshaw, Kelly Chapman Meyer, Quinn Ezralow, Rita Wilson, the late Anne Douglas, Renette Ezralow and Marion Laurie.\n\nHonorary Chairs Rita Wilson and Tom Hanks, along with Gala Chairs Jamie Alexander Tisch, Kelly Chapman Meyer, Quinn Ezralow, Anastasia Soare, and Co-Chairs NJ Falk, Tom Ford, Kris Levine, Judy and Leonard Lauder, Dr. Stacie J. Stephenson and Richard J Stephenson, Steve Tisch and Lori Kanter Tritsch and William P. Lauder, were all in attendance. The evening featured several honorees as well as tributes to cancer survivors and the memory of those impacted by cancer.\n\n“There isn’t a person in this room who has not been touched by this,” said Hanks before he took the stage.\n\nThe Beverly Wilshire ballroom was decorated in mauve and lavender hues with red rose floral arrangements by Eric Buterbaugh who was in attendance with Melanie Griffith. Guests dined on Scottish smoked salmon carpaccio, Mary’s organic grilled chicken, and a mixed berry salad with lemon yogurt semifreddo.\n\nPhilanthropist Wallis Annenberg received the 2024 Unsung Hero Award, presented by Jamie Alexander Tisch and Rita Wilson, for her dedication to fighting cancer through the Annenberg Foundation. Wilson introduced Annenberg as an “unsung hero, a dear friend, longtime supporter and visionary force for good in our community and world today.” During her acceptance speech, Annenberg said, “Information has the power to heal, to transform, to revitalize—that is why we all need to band together, to work together, for the Women’s Cancer Research Fund, to keep the information coming.” Annenberg also announced her gift of $1 million dollars to support the WCRF.\n\nA Special Tribute video from actor and producer Michael Douglas announced a $500,000 pledge to the Women’s Cancer Research Fund in honor of the late Anne Douglas.\n\nActress Demi Moore, in a black Gucci gown, received the 2024 Courage Award, also presented by Rita Wilson, for her support and dedication to raising awareness for breast cancer. Moore, who came to the event with her Aunt Deanna, a breast cancer survivor, said during her acceptance speech, “This award is truly for the sisterhood of incredible women who have shown me what courage looks like. Women like my aunt who survived breast cancer and has been free of it for 18 years. As women, we don’t get to be courageous just once. We have to do it every damn day. And we cannot, will not, do it alone.”\n\nGrammy Award-winning artist Sting, clad in a black mock turtleneck and high-top sneakers, sat on a black stool while singing “My One and Only Love” acapella before playing his electric-acoustic guitar and dedicating “Fields of Gold” to his wife Trudi Styler, and his mother whom he lost to breast cancer over 30 years ago. He also performed a heartfelt version of “Every Breath You Take.”\n\nOther guests in attendance included Sofia Vergara, Nia Vardalos, Ashley Greene, Carly Steel, Chord Overstreet, Crystal Kung Minkoff, Cynthia Bailey, Jesse Johnson, Jonathan Simkhai, Justin Sylvester, Kathy and Rick Hilton, Josh Flagg, Gigi Gharai, Kayla Ewell, Keni Silva, Kyle Richards, Lisa Rinna, Lori Loughlin, Monique Lhuillier, Martin and Kelly Katz, Rachel Zoe, Alina Cho and Tanner Novlan."
