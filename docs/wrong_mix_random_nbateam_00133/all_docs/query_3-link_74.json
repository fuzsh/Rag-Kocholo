        "text": "Local family's ice dream for Zoe\n\nby JENNY MONROE\n\nWHILE most people in Northern Ireland are cheering on Bangor girl Zoe Salmon in Dancing on Ice, some local people have an extra special reason for making sure they cast their votes.\n\nFor 29-year-old TV presenter Zoe's aunt and uncle Margaret and Bertie Salmon live in Hillsborough while her cousin Heather Wilson lives in Dromara.\n\nThe Salmon family are hoping people in the Lisburn area will get behind the ex-blue Peter presenter and make her the queen of the Ice.\n\nThe star's cousin Heather said that the family circle is \"so proud of her\".\n\nShe said: \"We are absolutely delighted that she is doing so well.\n\n\"When My mother goes to the hairdressers all the talk is about Zoe. We just want her do as well as she can. We are all very proud of her and we would love it if Lisburn showed their support for her too.\"\n\nShe continued: \"My heart stopped beating when she stumbled a little on Sunday and it just showed how difficult it, is but she recovered so well.\n\n\"They make it look so easy and when somebody does wobble it makes you realise how difficult it actually is.\"\n\nZoe whos late grandparents Mary and Joe also lived in Lisburn, injured herself during tough rehearsals before Sunday's live show. Speaking after her performance she said: \"It was a tough week and an injury at the last minute didn't help.\n\nThe star said she rested her sore leg on Monday and was back to training.\n\n\"I'm having such a wonderful experience. Thanks so much again for all your votes. I really, really do appreciate it.\"\n\nCatch Zoe on ITV1 on Sunday evening and show your support.\n\njenny.monroe@jpress.co.uk"
