        "text": "The Golden Globe Awards likes to think of itself as the party of the year, but instead of a debauched, champagne-fueled romp, it can sometimes feel more like a strange high school reunion for the extremely famous.\n\nSome are catching up with old friends and co-stars, some are kissing their dates in plain sight and some fawn over the cool kids they haven’t yet met.\n\nSometimes it happens on camera, as with “Poor Things” director Yorgos Lanthimos swooning over his proximity to a personal idol, Bruce Springsteen, but most of the time those interactions are saved for when the cameras are off – though Timothée Chalamet and Kylie Jenner clearly didn’t get the memo that there were still live cameras even during the commercial breaks.\n\n▶ This is an excerpt from a full story.

But for all the immensity of ‘Oppenheimer,’ this is Nolan’s most human-scaled film — and one of his greatest achievements,” AP Film Writer Jake Coyle said in his review.\n\nLily Gladstone won the best actress in a drama award for her role as Mollie Burkhart in Martin Scorsese’s epic “Killers of the Flower Moon.”\n\nShe opened her acceptance speech in the Blackfeet language.\n\n“A beautiful community, nation, that encouraged me to keep going, keep doing this,” Gladstone said.\n\n“I’m so grateful that I can speak even a little bit of my language, which I’m not fluent in up here, because in this business, Native actors used to speak their lines in English, and then the sound mixers would run them backwards to accomplish Native languages on camera,” she said.\n\nGladstone is the first Indigenous winner of this award. She was named one of 2023’s AP Breakthrough Entertainers.\n\n“It is, of course, something I have to think about, insofar as I would just really love to speak some of my language — and teach myself a little bit more of my language — to have and to hold in that moment,” Gladstone told AP Film Writer Jake Coyle about the possibility of winning an Oscar. “It would be an incredible moment in my life, but it would mean so much more than just me.”\n\nAli Wong and Steven Yeun made history by sweeping the limited series lead acting categories for their roles in “Beef.”\n\nWong is the first Asian American to win best actress in a limited series. Yeun is the second, following Darren Criss, who won in 2019 for “The Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story.”\n\nBackstage, “Beef” creator Lee Sung Jin said he was unaware of the milestone.\n\n“It’s news to me too. That’s amazing. Steven and Ali are on top of their game – not only in their craft, but also as people,” he said.\n\nUpdate (Jan. 8): This post has been expanded to clarify that Yeun is the second Asian American actor to win in his category.\n\n“I was kind of hoping I didn’t have to get up. Kieran’s usually better at these speeches, do you want to get up instead?” Sarah Snook joked about relinquishing her award to the Culkin who played her rival sibling on HBO’s “Succession.” “Yeah, you take it instead.”\n\nA little earlier, Culkin won best actor in a TV drama for his role as the dysfunctional Roman Roy.\n\n“This show has changed my life,” Snook said. “It was always a team and that’s what made the show always amazing to be a part of.”\n\nAfter “The Bear” leads Jeremy Allen White and Ayo Edebiri took home awards for best actor and best actress in a TV comedy, the show won for best comedy TV series.\n\nLionel Boyce, who portrays the too-sweet pastry chef Marcus on the show, gave the acceptance speech.\n\n“I don’t know why they chose me to speak. I think I don’t know if they believed that we will win,” he said.\n\n“Thank you to the entire restaurant community.” he said. “You know, we played these characters for a couple of hours a day for a couple of months out of the year, but this is y’alls reality, the highs and the lows. So thank you for embracing us.”\n\nThe 10-episode Netflix show captured the award for limited series, anthology or motion picture made for TV, on the heels of stars Ali Wong and Steven Yeun’s wins.\n\nThe show follows an epic feud between two strangers, played by Yeun (“The Walking Dead,” “Minari”) and Wong (“Always Be My Maybe”), that stems from a wild case of road rage.\n\nYeun told AP’s Alicia Rancilio last year that he thought the show said a lot about society.\n\n“I just see a giant mirror up to all of us,” he said in a recent interview. “We’re living in a lot of isolation, building a lot of stories up in our head. Maybe all we really want to do is connect to somebody.”\n\nBackstage after her win, Wong said she initially questioned whether she could take on her Amy Lau role on “Beef.”\n\n“I’ve been on tour doing standup mostly,” she said. “Doing this project was really big. When I got asked to do this, I honestly thought to myself, ‘I don’t know if I can do this.’ So to feel seen and recognized for the work we did on that show, it has meaning.”\n\nActors Margot Robbieand Ryan Gosling discuss balancing comedy and poignancy while filming Greta Gerwig’s eagerly anticipated “Barbie.” (July 10)\n\nThe Globes introduced a brand-new award for cinematic and box office achievement this year.\n\nTaking on “Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,” ‘John Wick: Chapter 4,” “Mission Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part 1,” “Oppenheimer,” “Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,” “The Super Mario Bros. Movie” and the seemingly impossible “Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour” — take a breath now — “Barbie” captured the first trophy.\n\nThe award recognizes highly watched films and was to be decided “based on creativity, originality and artistry.” It was the only category with eight nominees.\n\nSwift is 0-for-5 at the Golden Globes. She was nominated last year in the original song category for “Carolina” from “Where the Crawdads Sing.”\n\nLudwig Göransson took home the award for best motion picture score for his work on Christopher Nolan’s “Oppenheimer,” a soundtrack that had him using musical materials from the time period — including radios, nuclear computers and machines from the 1950s.\n\n“I want to also thank Cillian Murphy. I’ve been watching your face over and over and over and over again. It’s been an incredible experience,” he said in his speech.\n\nBillie Eilish and her brother Finneas won best song for “What Was I Made For?” her big-hearted, big hit “Barbie” ballad.\n\n“You are the reason I am the way I am,” Eilish said to her brother in her speech, later adding: “I was very very miserable and depressed at the time and writing that song kind of saved me a little bit.”\n\n“Almost like a Miyazaki greatest hits, ‘The Boy and the Heron’ is filled with little fluffy orbs and fantastical oversized creatures, with drips of blood and drops of tears,” AP Film Writer Jake Coyle wrote in his review of the best animated film winner.\n\n“You’ll leave ‘The Boy and the Heron’ in disbelief that this, supposedly, is a filmmaker in autumn. It’s just as uncompromising a vision, and just as attuned to the experience of childhood. ... It’s a grand culmination of both Miyazaki’s extraordinary body of work and of a film that gathers, like a flock, or a symphony, so many of his trademark obsessions.”\n\nDa’Vine Joy Randolph, who won the Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actress in a Motion Picture, explains how she connected to her character Mary in “The Holdovers.”\n\n“The Holdovers” star Da’Vine Joy Randolph spoke about the energy inside the ballroom and what her victory meant to her.\n\n“It’s a party in there. It’s a good time. We got through the pandemic. We stuck through our two strikes. There’s a sense of buzz in there. People are excited to be here. It’s a really wonderful year.”\n\n“The beauty of this is that all the times I had poured into my craft, stayed up, the sleepless nights and tried to contribute to this industry. I looked at how I can do this as a woman of color, how I can tell these women’s stories and being in this moment. This award means the world to me.”\n\nAlthough it was Christopher Nolan’s first win, it wasn’t his first acceptance speech at the Golden Globes. In 2009, he accepted on behalf of the late actor Heath Ledger, who won a posthumous award for his iconic role in “The Dark Knight.”\n\n“And in the middle of speaking, I glanced up and Robert Downey Jr. caught my eye and gave me a look of love and support,” the “Oppenheimer” director said, with the camera cutting to an emotional Downey. \" Same look he’s giving me now, the same love and support he’s shown so many people and in our community over so many years.”\n\nBy the way, if you want Nolan’s tips on the best way to watch a movie, AP Film Writer Lindsey Bahr has you covered.\n\nFive-time nominee Kieran Culkin accepted his first Golden Globe — best actor in a TV drama — for his role as the dysfunctional Roman Roy in HBO’s “Succession.”\n\n“I was nominated for a Golden Globe like 20 years ago. And when that moment passed, I sort of remember thinking, ‘I’m never going to be back in this room again.’ And which was fine, whatever,” he said, referring to 2003’s “Igby Goes Down.” But thanks to ‘Succession,’ I’ve been in here a couple of times,” he said. “It’s nice, but I sort of accepted I was never going to be on the stage, so this is a nice moment.”\n\n“Suck it, Pedro,” he joked to his fellow nominee, actor Pedro Pascal.\n\nCulkin was up against his fellow “Succession” actors Brian Cox (who portrayed Logan Roy on the show) and Jeremy Strong (Kendall Roy). Neither was in attendance.\n\nLast month, The Associated Press anointed Ayo Edebiri one of 2023’s AP Breakthrough Entertainers.\n\n“I think it’s like not the reason why you do any of this, but it’s very humbling and moving that it’s happening because I think that it means that people are responding to my work,” Edebiri said of all her newfound recognition in a conversation with AP’s Leslie Ambriz. “And that is all you can ask for as an artist, for just people to pick up what you’re putting down and in whatever way possible.”\n\nTonight, she won a Golden Globe for her role in “The Bear.”\n\n“Yeah, I’m really, really grateful. If I forgot to thank you, I’m sorry, unless you were mean or something,” she said in her acceptance speech. “Okay, Bye. Thank you.”\n\nRicky Gervais, the five-time Golden Globes host, was nowhere to be seen tonight — though he still won the brand-new award for stand-up comedy television special for his “Armageddon.”\n\nGervais’ last stint hosting was in 2020, which he repeatedly promised would be his final time.\n\n“Gervais has a sterling track record; that’s why he’s been back five times. But it was hard to miss the weariness in some of the faces of audience members watching him Sunday,” AP Media Writer David Bauder wrote at the time.\n\nThanks to a quirk of the Emmys eligibility season and that ceremony’s postponement amid the Hollywood strikes, Jeremy Allen White won his second consecutive Golden Globe for “The Bear” before having a chance to win his first Emmy for the hit show.\n\nWhite is nominated for an Emmy at the Jan. 15 show, but it’s for his work on the first season. The critically acclaimed and popular series debuted in June 2022, AP’s Alicia Rancilio explained last year, but it was too late for the 2022 Emmy Awards.\n\nWhite, who plays Carmen “Carmy” Berzatto is hot off a buzzy Calvin Klein campaign.\n\n“I can’t believe I’m in this room with all these all these people I’ve loved so much, admired so much for so long. It’s unreal,” he said in his acceptance speech. “I love this show.”\n\nFor acting out the lives of the rich and famous, Elizabeth Debicki and Matthew Macfadyen won supporting TV role Globes.\n\nDebicki was awarded for her role as Princess Diana in “The Crown,” while Macfadyen won for his supporting role as Tom Wambsgans in “Succession.”\n\n“I just adored every second playing the weird and wonderful human grease stain that is Tom Wambsgans and — Tom Wambsgans, CEO, I should say,” Macfadyen said in his speech. “God help us.”\n\nTaylor Swift was one of the first in the room to stand up for MacFayden’s win.\n\n“I took a beta blocker so this is going to be a breeze,” Robert Downey Jr. said, beginning his acceptance speech.\n\nDowney Jr. portrayed Lewis Strauss in Christopher Nolan’s biopic “Oppenheimer,” but misspoke when naming his character.\n\n“Dozens of folks have come up to me since the summertime saying that I was, I quote, ‘unrecognizably subtle as Leonard Strauss,’” the actor said. “To my fellow nominees, let’s not pretend this is a compliment.”\n\nDa’Vine Joy Randolph won the first award of the night for her supporting actress role in the holiday movie “The Holdovers” as Mary Lamb, the grieving school cook who lost her son in Vietnam.\n\n“I hope I have helped you find your inner Mary because there is a little bit of her in all of us,” she said during her acceptance speech.\n\nShe also thanked the now-defunct Hollywood Foreign Press Association, prompting many in the audience to say, in near-unison, “They’re not called that.”\n\n“Barbenheimer” was guaranteed some attention during comedian Jo Koy’s opening monologue. And it only took a few minutes to get there.\n\n“My new year’s resolution for 2024 is to finish ‘Oppenheimer’ in 2025,” the host joked, before jumping to a few “Barbie” gags, including a line about “Barbie’s” central conflict being when she moves from “perfect beauty to bad breath, cellulite, and flat feet, or what casting directors call character acting.” It was met with few laughs, resulting in Koy breaking the fourth wall.\n\n“Some I wrote, some other people wrote,” he said.\n\n“Yo, I got the gig 10 days ago, you want a perfect monologue? Yo, shut up. You’re kidding me, right? Slow down, I wrote some of these and they’re the ones you’re laughing at.”\n\nKoy opened with a joke about watching the nominated titles: “I lied. I only watch ‘Beef,’” the Filipino American actor joked. “It’s mandatory. I’m Asian.”\n\nMinutes before the 81st Golden Globes was set to start, Taylor Swift emerged on the carpet in a brilliant green sequined gown. Her attendance at the award show was the subject of much online chatter: Would she attend Kansas City Chiefs’ Sunday game against the Los Angeles Chargers ahead of the Golden Globe Awards in relatively nearby Beverly Hills? Her beau, Chiefs’ tight end Travis Kelce was ruled inactive for that final game of the regular season, and onto the carpet she went.\n\nThis year, the Globes introduced a new category, for cinematic and box office achievement for which the popstar’s history-making “Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour” is nominated. If Swift wins, it would be her first Globe. She’s been nominated four times previously.\n\nGolden Globes host Jo Koy says this year’s ceremony will be “a fun night.” The 81st Golden Globe Awards airs Sunday, Jan. 7 on CBS. (Jan. 4)\n\nThe Golden Globes host for tonight is Jo Koy, a Filpino American actor and comedian. He’s released five stand-up comedy specials on Comedy Central and Netflix, and in 2022 starred in “Easter Sunday” – the first big studio movie with an all-Filipino ensemble.\n\nAhead of the ceremony, Koy told AP Entertainment Writer Jonathan Landrum that watching award shows with his mother was a childhood ritual.\n\n“This is a throwback to my childhood, and now I’m the guy who’s onstage,” he said.\n\nKoy promises an entertaining show.\n\n“They’re giving me the blessing to be me,” he said of producers. “I want to bring my style to the Globes. Of course, I’m going to have fun. But most importantly, I want to make sure everyone’s happy. I’m going to make fun of myself. If I can do that, I can make fun of other people.”\n\nOn the red carpet, Reese Witherspoon told Variety that she’s at work on a third season of the HBO show “Big Little Lies.”\n\nWhen asked to confirm Nicole Kidman’s statement that the show was returning, Witherspoon simply said: “We are working on it.”\n\nThe star-studded show about five women harboring dark secrets in a seaside California town featured Witherspoon, Kidman, Laura Dern, Zoë Kravitz and Shailene Woodley. The last season of the show aired in 2019.\n\nJustin Hartley is not Glen Powell. But the latter is having a little fun with being mistaken for the Golden Globes presenter.\n\n“I think this is the perfect time to announce that ⁦@justinhartley⁩ and I will be starring in the most boring body-swap movie of all time,” he wrote above a screenshot of a post that identified Hartley as him.\n\n“Damn, I look good,” he captioned the same screenshot in an Instagram story.\n\n“There’s Indiana Jones!” one Globes guest gushed as Harrison Ford stealthily made his way inside the ballroom, AP Film Writer Lindsey Bahr reports. “Nice to meet you” he said to a female fan who reached out to shake his hand.\n\nElsewhere, “Priscilla” star Cailee Spaeny looked starry-eyed making her way to her seat, while a waiter gushed to Quinta Brunson how gorgeous she looked.\n\nHannah Waddingham, of “Ted Lasso,” and Lenny Kravitz greeted each other, too.\n\n“Rustin” star Colman Domingo tells AP about his outfit while on the red carpet at the Golden Globe Awards in Los Angeles.\n\nGolden Globes nominee Colman Domingo made his way on the red carpet in a Louis Vuitton Nehru suit. On the carpet, Domingo found the parallels between his movie “Rustin” to the recent writer’s strike.\n\n“It’s a very sexy film about organizing and watching people who are very spirited, come to the table and agree to not leave the table until we get a resolution,” he told the AP. “And hopefully for me, watching ‘Rustin,’ I think that hopefully people will be inspired to come to tables before we get to a state to ever have to stop, have a work stoppage. Sometimes that’s something we can do and its powerful.”\n\nNo one ever talks much about the Golden Globes dinner. Chicken and fish and root vegetables that are gone by the time most famous people get to sit aren’t the kind of dishes that inspire poetic reflection.\n\nBut this year several people gasped when they saw “Nobu” on the menus tucked into the napkins, AP Film Writer Lindsey Bahr observes. The tasting plate included black cod with miso, salmon tartare with caviar and “tai nigiri Matsuhisa style.”\n\nThe novelty not only seems to be working to draw people to their seats but also something even more shocking is happening for a seated ballroom dinner: Some are asking if they can have seconds. (The answer is no.)"
