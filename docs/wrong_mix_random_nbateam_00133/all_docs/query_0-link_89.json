        "text": "Marjorie Chelius wrote in with an eventful update: “Exciting news from my world! I married Blake Seymour (Duke ’08) last November in a beautiful park in Memphis, Tennessee, surrounded by our immediate families. Shoutout to Brandon Aiono for joining the pre-wedding bachelorette fun! Blake and I met while getting our M.B.A.s at U Chicago Booth (an instant connection from before orientation!).\n\n“On the professional front, I transitioned out of Mockingbird (baby gear startup) last fall and enjoyed some well-deserved time off. Now I’m diving back into the consumer sector, eager to leverage my 12-plus years of experience in general management, marketing, and strategy. Reconnecting with fellow alumni has been a highlight, including Kelly Hopley at Lego and Molly Schloss at Google (who even recruited me to join her San Francisco women’s soccer team).\n\n“If you’re interested in connecting, checking in, or need any job search tips (I have plenty!), reach out at marjorie@chelius.com.”\n\nWe also received news that Yuan Liang joined the intellectual property group of the boutique law firm Ambrose, Mills & Lazarow, PLLC, in Reston, Virginia, as a partner. Congratulations, Yuan!\n\nChris Bilger wrote in to say that she got married in the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta (also known as “the California Delta”) and celebrated with 22 other Dartmouth alums. “Very importantly, I got to play volleyball and pong on our wedding day. My husband, Erick, isn’t a Dartmouth alum but has been in a very thorough pong-training program to be ready for the next class reunion. We are still living in Sunnyvale, California, with our 80-pound couch potato Maddie.” Congratulations on your wedding, Chris!\n\n—Hillary S. Cheng, 26611 La Roda, Mission Viejo, CA 92691; (603) 546-8452; hillary.s.cheng@dartmouth.edu\n\nPlease welcome a guest column by Matt Oh.\n\nVox clamantis in deserto: Challenges test your faith and develop your perseverance and endurance. The modern world imposes the idea that following your passion and growing an empire on a screen, alone, is more valuable than compassion. But to me, “compassion” means community with passion—a core value of mine. It takes me back to where I was when my career paths took off, as I write to you from the Twin Cities, where I lived exactly 10 years ago.\n\nAfter graduating from a fifth-year football season, I bounced around professional football teams in pursuit of my dream to play at the highest level: the NFL, which really stands for “not for long” a.k.a. “really never happened.” Roger Erickson, former Super Bowl champion coach, helped me learn how to become flexible. I always prided myself on being strong on my own and only recently realized what true strength really means: healthy together for the longevity of the greater team.\n\nMy first wakeup call was when I was cut from my first professional football team, the CFL’s Hamilton Tiger Cats. Coach Buddy Teevens ’79 phoned in a favor to Brendan Mahoney ’91, and I was hired at the Capital Croup Cos. in Irvine, California. At the time my good friend P.J. Nestler worked nearby as the head of performance at Velocity Sports. He saw me change from my suit and tie into my athletic clothes at 5:15 p.m. Monday through Friday and attempt to deadlift the house with a white-knuckle grip on my dream of becoming the first Korean American linebacker in the NFL. I received a call to play for the Montreal Alouettes with coach Dan Hawkins. While working in the corporate sphere I saved up my vacation time to ensure that if any teams called, I had enough paid time off to give them my best. I am so blessed to have iron-strong coaches, brothers, and mentors who sharpen me.\n\nI turned 35 on October 15, a birthday I share with my Minnesotan second mom, and recalled Buddy Teevens’ mantras: “Next play” and “Count on me.” I feel like I finally understand what it means to be a “wearer of the green.” As mentioned, I recognize with immense gratitude that my mentors played a crucial role in my cross-career success. Coach Dan Hawkins of the CFL Montreal Alouettes called me when I was in Japan playing football for the Panasonic Impulse to share the news that I had been invited to play for Team USA. We won the gold medal, qualifying me to be inducted into the Dartmouth Hall of Fame. My family and I had the joy of traveling back to Dartmouth last Homecoming for this award and recognition. It served as another reminder to see past the fame, money, and other motivating factors this world preaches; to focus on what is in the garden we stand on, to ask what seeds we are planting for the next generation rather than chasing a single carrot. As my mentor Anthony Acheson said, “Don’t gain the world and lose your soul.”\n\nMy spidey senses are tingling: Now is the time to step up, be a champion, and pay it forward to the role models who have shaped me. It is time to “find a way!” (Shoutout to Dartmouth football’s new head coach, Sammy McCorkle.) We must put down our devices, remember to embrace the waves, and marvel at the vastness of the ocean, because our true north will never mislead. Champions, thank you, let’s pay it forward.\n\n—Hillary S. Cheng, 26611 La Roda, Mission Viejo, CA 92691; (603) 546-8452; hillary.s.cheng@dartmouth.edu\n\nPlease welcome a guest column by Frank Santo.\n\nSince leaving Hanover I’ve focused almost all my energy on one thing: writing a novel. It was a dumb idea and I don’t know where I got it. But anyway, here I am, 13 years later, finally presenting my book The Birthparents to the world on September 12 via a Chicago-based literary press called Tortoise Books. It’s a novel about a foster care caseworker with a white savior complex and a questionable moral compass who tries to make a difference by helping a troubled young mother in the Bronx and in so doing makes her life a whole lot more difficult. It’s inspired by (but not based on) my own experiences working in this exact situation for my first five years out of college, and I personally think that it is very good. On the other hand, one time at a writer’s conference, an academic who I’d paid $150 to give me feedback on an early draft looked at me with grave, almost fatherly concern and whispered: “You cannot publish this, people are going to hate you.” So I guess it’s my word against his.\n\nAnyway, thanks for indulging that bit of shameless self-promotion. I feel a little hypocritical attempting to leverage the Dartmouth network for my own advantage, because the truth is, outside of a few close friends and my wife, I’ve mostly lost touch with my ’11 classmates through the years. Sometimes I wonder if I ever felt the deep connection to Dartmouth that so many alumni cherish. As the years pass by and memories fade, it’s harder and harder to say.\n\nThe other day though, my wife Andrea Jaresova ’12 and I happened to be driving through the area with our two little kids, and I felt a sudden urge to visit campus again. We parked near the library, and I held our 3 1/2-year-old on my shoulders and showed her various buildings: the Choates, frat row, the unnervingly warm top floor of Baker. As we went around campus I was struck by how little changed most of it seemed. Even the students looked like slight variations on people that I used to know. Finally, we ended up at Novack. “This is where Mommy and Daddy met,” I told my daughter. “We used to work here together.” Of course, my kid could not possibly have cared about that less. I’m pretty sure she thinks her mom and I are brother and sister. But still, in that moment, it all came rushing back. There was something special about being here, I thought—as everyone else has been saying all this time. I hugged my daughter close and told her maybe someday she would go here too. She’d swim in the river I was telling her about, study in that fetid tower. Maybe she’d even meet her partner in this same coffee shop, like Mommy and Daddy did 15 years ago. I felt Andrea looking at me then.\n\n“Why are you telling her that?” she said.\n\n“What?” I said. “It’s nice.”\n\nAndrea rolled her eyes at me, the way I’ve always loved.\n\n“We met in the Bones Gate basement.”\n\nI guess I’d remembered that part wrong too. Still, the point stands, right?\n\n—Hillary S. Cheng, 26611 La Roda, Mission Viejo, CA 92691; (603) 546-8452; hillary.s.cheng@dartmouth.edu\n\nPlease welcome a guest column by Anise Vance.\n\nHi, everyone! How lovely to be in touch through these Class Notes. Many thanks to Hillary for maintaining such a wonderful service. Here are some updates.\n\nPrompted by snowstorms, my wife, Candace, and I moved from Boston to North Carolina almost a decade ago. Our two children, Taraz (6) and Ella (3), were born in Chapel Hill and have spent much of their lives toddling about the woods. We’ve recently discovered the joys of birdwatching, and I’ve found few greater joys than learning about thrashers and nuthatches and chickadees alongside my kids.\n\nFamily life has been coupled with especially rejuvenating and purposeful work. Following the murder of George Floyd, the City of Durham formed a community safety department tasked with diverting a subset of 911 calls away from law enforcement and to behavioral health specialists. I help to grow and guide that department and its 911 teams, which have now demonstrated that unarmed responses are safe, effective, and often the best method of meeting the needs of people in crisis. The work is rooted in principles of racial equity and at the forefront of a movement toward reimagining public safety.\n\nI am also excited to share that my debut novel, Hush Harbor, will be published this September by the Hanover Square Imprint at HarperCollins. Its premise: “After the murder of an unarmed Black teenager by the hands of the police, protests spread like wildfire in Bliss City, New Jersey. A full-scale resistance group takes control of an abandoned housing project and decide to call it Hush Harbor, a term once used to describe the secret spaces where slaves would gather to pray.” (It’s available at all the major online book retailers if anyone wants to take a further look.) I’m thrilled to see it almost out in the world after working on it for nine years!\n\nWhile the paragraphs above can read a little like a social media highlight reel, life has been filled with setbacks and struggles as well—missteps, accidents, deaths, anxieties, stressors ranging from the mundane (how I hate commuting) to the global (Covid-ing with a then newborn and 3 year old). If you’re reading this and feeling some of those struggles, please know that you’re not alone in that experience. Some books that have helped me process a troublesome world during the last six months: Carrying by Ada Limón (a collection of poems), Hell of a Book by Jason Mott (fiction), and Saving Time by Jenny Odell (nonfiction).\n\nAs for the future, my wife and I continue to experience a profound longing to move back overseas (she grew up in Jamaica and Israel; I grew up in Kenya, Botswana, and Egypt). Who knows when or how that will happen. For the time being, though, there is a bluebird couple that have nested in a hole some downy woodpeckers spent winter creating just off my balcony. My family is quite curious to see theirs grow.\n\n—Hillary S. Cheng, 26611 La Roda, Mission Viejo, CA 92691; (603) 546-8452; hillary.s.cheng@dartmouth.edu\n\nLaura Calvo wrote with an update for the first time since graduation: “After graduation I returned to my home country Bolivia for medical school, got married, adopted my terrier mix Chela, and returned to the United States to have my son, Lucas Julian (now 4!). Last year I completed my pediatrics residency in Corpus Christi, Texas, during which time I had my daughter, Zoe Luna (now 2!). I am currently in my first year of neonatal-perinatal medicine fellowship at Duke University and would love to connect with any other alum in the Triangle area.”\n\nAdditionally, James Cart ’10—who is the newly elected president for the class of 2010—wrote to let me know of Reid Duke’s first individual win in a Magic: The Gathering Pro Tour event on February 19. Congratulations, Reid! I was also alerted by a fellow classmate to Reid’s participation in the event while it was happening, as Reid’s winning gameplay was livestreamed on Twitch! But Thomas Lane and I happened to be roaming a park in Las Vegas for a Pokémon Go Tour: Hoenn event and were preoccupied with catching Pokémon and taking photos with giant Pokémon balloons (of Torchic, Mudkip, and Treecko) and a costumed Pikachu mascot. I cannot recommend Las Vegas winter weather, but the food was great as usual!\n\nIn other news I have gleaned from Instagram and Facebook recently, Genevieve O’Mara has started a new product platform for mothers called Mamieli (@be_mamieli on Instagram, www.mamieli.com). Kaleigh Wood (@kaleighw2011) and Korey McCants (@ikrossfinishlines) seem to be doing great running marathons! Thomas Tao and Julie Fiveash ’13 successfully visited Yan Fan in Tokyo, and it appeared to be a charming reunion.\n\nPlease write in with your updates, big or small! No news is too inconsequential for this space. Adam Reed’s fluffy ragdoll cat Mortimer agrees, after having recently survived a visit to the veterinarian following his allergy-induced hunger strike! Also, if you would like to pen a longer piece (word count limit of 600!), we very much welcome guest columnists on any topic you deem interesting to your classmates or the broader alumni community readership.\n\n—Hillary S. Cheng, 26611 La Roda, Mission Viejo, CA 92691; (603) 546-8452; hillary.s.cheng@dartmouth.edu\n\nPeter Sutoris, currently an assistant professor at the University of York in the United Kingdom, wrote in about his “research into the ways in which education systems are failing to adequately respond to the climate crisis.” Peter has published a book about his research and articles for Politico, The Guardian, Scientific American, Undark, and Salon.\n\nIn the absence of other volunteered updates, fall 2022 has been quite eventful for Thomas Lane and me in terms of classmate interactions, so here’s our personal narrative of recent classmate-related life. In October Allison Lure flew in from Columbus, Ohio, for the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics. Allison is doing a fellowship in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), and it is so interesting to hear about her experiences in the hospital. Allison, Thomas, and I explored the Anaheim Packing District together, and we picked her up the next day so that she could visit us in Mission Viejo and meet our three dogs! We also FaceTimed with Yiwei Wang and his wife, Stella, in the Bay Area.\n\nIn November Trevor King and Steve Avila both visited southern California. David Gomez joined Trevor, Thomas, and me for a walk along Crystal Cove State Park, Laguna Beach, and an oceanside lunch at Shake Shack (unrelated to the franchise). Steve Avila flaunted his impressive Mandarin and Cantonese skills over dim sum at NBC Seafood Restaurant in Monterey Park, and Steve enthralled Thomas and me with stories of his adventures around the world and in the Republican political world.\n\nIn December Thomas and I made the one-hour trek to Santa Monica for the holiday celebration organized by the Dartmouth Club of Los Angeles, which is always a wonderful and welcoming event. (We highly encourage your attendance!) There, we ran into the indomitable Marco Chu, who we’ve known since moving here in 2016, and we met for the first time Waheed Zarif and Stephen Jangro, as well as Olivia Baptista ’12. Thomas recognized Waheed from their time at Thayer Engineering School as they are both engineers. Waheed moved from New York City to Los Angeles in January 2020, and this was one of the first times he was venturing out! Stephen and Olivia also reentered the social world through this holiday event and regaled us with hilarious stories about working in the film industry. (Catch Olivia in Episode 5 of Netflix’s original series The Lincoln Lawyer!)\n\nThat same weekend, Thomas and I FaceTimed with a handful of our freshman floormates (including adopted floormates!): Allison Lure, Young-joong Kim, Matthew Elkherj, Amine Abouzaid, Martin Liu, and Andrea Choi. Matt and his wife, Rose, are living in the Bay Area and expecting a baby in June! We are so excited for them and are planning a floormate reunion in May.\n\nThomas also went to Japan for two weeks in December and met up with Yan Fan for unagi and ran into a Santa parade where they handed out full-size Meiji Hello Panda cookies! Thomas Tao has plans to visit Yan in February, and we so look forward to hearing and seeing photos of their reunion.\n\nSome nostalgia to wrap up: I discovered in November—15 years after the fact—that Chris Takeuchi ’09 as DJ Keystone Cowboy and Andy Sloan ’09 as DJ Grimee were responsible for the sick beats at TriKap (now known as Kappa Pi Kappa) during our freshman year. This belated discovery is also funny because I met Chris once on campus when he was wearing a cowboy hat crafted from Keystone boxes, and I didn’t put two and two together—but I know now!\n\n—Hillary S. Cheng, 26611 La Roda, Mission Viejo, CA 92691; (603) 546-8452; hillary.s.cheng@dartmouth.edu\n\nThe obituary for John McInerney “Mac” Morris has been published at dartmouthalumnimagazine.com/class-obituaries/2011. One update from Lane Bracken: As of mid-October Mac’s family postponed the memorial service, initially scheduled for November 5 in N.Y.C., to April 29. Please contact Lane at lane.bracken@gmail.com if you are interested in attending Mac’s memorial service.\n\nWe would like to compile a memorial Class Notes column dedicated to Mac’s memory. Lane, Marshall Bartlett, Trevor G. King, and I (in my capacity as secretary) will be helping to organize and collect memories from classmates and friends. Please reach out to any of them or me, but please copy me on correspondence so I can be sure to include your contribution and ensure nothing gets lost in anyone’s inboxes. My email and contact information are listed at the bottom of this (and every) Class Notes column.\n\nIn other news, Bryan Alston postponed the guest column planned for this issue, but we hope to see him back soon!\n\nGenevieve Adams wrote in with an update: She wrote, directed, produced, and stars in indie feature Simchas and Sorrows, which has received critical acclaim at the Bentonville Film Festival, the San Francisco Jewish Film Festival, and the Cinequest Film & Creativity Festival. Simchas and Sorrows ran in Los Angeles at the Laemmle NoHo 7 theater in mid-September 2022 and Gravitas Ventures digitally released the film on September 20, 2022. Genevieve and her husband, Ben Groveman, also welcomed the birth of their first child, Leonardo Nathaniel Groveman, on April 17, 2022!\n\nClaire Scott recently moved to Nashville, Tennessee, to start a job as senior lecturer in German language at Vanderbilt University. Her first book, Murderous Mothers: Late Twentieth-Century Medea Figures and Feminism, came out in September 2022 with Peter Lang Press.\n\nLauren Glover wrote in for the first time with news for Class Notes! Lauren’s lovely update: “After graduation I moved to the Bay Area and bounced around many industries—from nonprofits to women’s health and reproductive justice to consulting and, finally, tech. I’ve been focused on employee-executive strategy and communications at Dolby Laboratories Inc. since 2016.\n\n“In 2017 I met my now-husband, Colin Poindexter, a 2013 graduate of Franklin and Marshall College. We got engaged in March 2021 on Big Sur’s Pfeiffer Beach, where we first said that we love each other in 2018; moved across the country to Brooklyn together; adopted a lilac British shorthair (a ridiculously adorable and lovable goblin—as most cats are); and got married on Saturday, October 8, 2022, at St. Patrick’s Cathedral in Manhattan. After the ceremony the reception was held aboard a private yacht that sailed the Hudson at sunset. A few Dartmouth folks were in attendance: Shayla Mars and Angelo Carino. Shawn Hawk ’13 celebrated with us in spirit as he was unable to make it but wished us well!”\n\nIn the same vein of delightful events, Sam Lloyd got married to Nina Deoras in Madison, New Hampshire, on August 27, 2022. I saw Nina post wedding photos to Instagram in mid-October and thought to myself, “Wow, Sam looks like royalty. Why is that? Oh my God, he looks like Prince Harry!” I found Sam on Facebook Messenger to tell him of his royal resemblance, and Sam responded, “Yea. One time on a bus in N.Y.C. someone flagged the bus down just to poke his head in and yell at me that I looked like him (Prince Harry).” So there you have it, we have our very own Prince Harry doppelgänger.\n\nAs always, please write in with updates; we truly love hearing from you!\n\n—Hillary S. Cheng, 26611 La Roda, Mission Viejo, CA 92691; (603) 546-8452; hillary.s.cheng@dartmouth.edu\n\nWe are sad to learn of the death of our classmate John McInerney “Mac” Morris on August 8. More details will be available in an obituary to be published on the Dartmouth Alumni Magazine’s website.\n\nIn happier news, Bryan Alston’s ecommerce startup Greater Than (DrinkGT.com) ranked as the No. 1 fastest-growing hydration brand on this year’s Inc5000 list (and is the #198th fastest-growing private company in the United States).\n\nBryan joined the failing sports drink company as a consultant who noticed something interesting in the data: Pregnant and breastfeeding moms were using the drink to increase milk supply, soothe muscle cramps, fight fatigue, and more. After going all-in on this highly overlooked group, the company grew sales by 27 times in three years. Bryan joined full-time in 2020 as chief marketing officer and has since been promoted to cofounder.\n\nBryan writes, “Pivoting from a healthy (but struggling) sports drink to now being the top hydration brand for breastfeeding moms has been a very exciting business journey during the past three years.\n\n“The explosive grassroots growth Greater Than has seen among new moms is a true testament to what happens when we focus on solving big problems for an overlooked customer group. I can’t wait to share more about this crazy journey in the next Class Notes column!”\n\nThe lack of voluntary updates for the April submission (published in the July/August issue) prompted classmates to write in. Without further ado, here are the updates! And please, continue writing with more!\n\nJohn Lee wrote to say, “It’s my first time writing in with an update for the Class Notes. I got married on July 9 to Hannah Kim (University of California, Berkeley, class of 2014). Leonard Chang was, I think, the only Dartmouth guest at our wedding. Hannah and I will be settling in San Francisco (where we’ve both been working in tech) for now, but we plan to move to Southeast Asia for at least a couple years before we start a family. I’d love to hear from any of our classmates who’ve moved to or are in Southeast Asia, especially Malaysia or Singapore!” Congratulations to John and good luck with the international move!\n\nAfter taking note that zero new updates were submitted for the July/August issue, Marjorie Chelius took pity on me and wrote in with an update. After cutting her teeth at Booth getting an M.B.A. and managing your favorite billion-dollar brands at P&G, Marjorie is now doing what she loves most: leading growth at an early-stage startup. Mockingbird was designed to bring high-quality, stylish baby goods to expecting parents at prices that don’t cost an arm and a leg. Marjorie would like our whole child-bearing-age class to know that you can purchase Mockingbird products, including its No. 1-rated single-to-double stroller at www.hellomockingbird.com or in your local Target store! She’s also hiring on her team, so drop her a note at mche@hellomockingbird.com if you’re in the job market.\n\nAnd shortly after I finished drafting the last Class Notes column, Shanel Balloo added, “Andrea Imhof and Lars Osterberg—in attendance at Erin (Jaeger) Gunaratna’s wedding—had a baby boy last July. Genevieve O’Mara also had a baby last year.” Congratulations to all the new parents!\n\nAnother followup to that column: Amanda Devine wrote back to say, “I got married to Jacob Wexler (not a Dartmouth alum) in Gaithersburg, Maryland, during Memorial Day Weekend. In attendance were Allison Lure, Kevin Liao, Kathryn Arion, Stephanie Han, Jennifer Fownes, and Nozomi Hitomi!”\n\nWrite me with more updates; we’ll publish them in the submission following Bryan’s guest column!\n\n—Hillary S. Cheng, 26611 La Roda, Mission Viejo, CA 92691; (603) 546-8452; hillary.s.cheng@dartmouth.edu\n\nExcitingly, Rebecca Wall wrote with an update in early June! I was curious as to her full postgraduation journey, and in response, Rebecca summarized, “In the 11 years since graduation I have not sent in a single update, so there is a lot to catch up on. After two years working for the Mahindra Group in Mumbai, India, I spent the next seven years in the Bay Area completing a Ph.D. in history at Stanford University alongside dissertation research in Mali, Senegal, and France, as well as becoming convinced California was the best state. More recently, I’ve been working as a history professor at Hamilton College in Clinton, New York, and regretting shedding my Dartmouth winter wardrobe in the intervening decade. After two years in upstate New York, I’m moving to Los Angeles to start a job as an assistant professor of history at Loyola Marymount University. Looking forward to reconnecting with all the other Dartmouth folks in the area and trading in endless winter for sunshine—reach out if you’re in SoCal or passing through!”\n\nAs volunteered updates have been sparse, I was on alert for classmates on Instagram in late May after submitting the last Class Notes column. (Feel free to DM @hillbearie with updates!) On May 21 Uthman Olagoke, Korey McCants, and Sarah Seng ran in the Brooklyn Half Marathon in N.Y.C., and Matt Raskind was in attendance to support Sarah’s run. They look overjoyed in their post-run photos; it was a beautiful day to be outside!\n\nThe same day I saw Ahra Cho post to Instagram stories a photo of our classmates celebrating a wedding. Today, dear class president Katie Paxton “pinged” (hehe) Erin (Jaeger) Gunaratna for details, and Erin wrote, “I married Mahen Gunaratna (Georgetown ’08) in September 2020. We met through Andrea Imhof and Katie Gandy in 2014! He was roommates with them in a five-bedroom apartment in Brooklyn, and I had just moved to N.Y.C. We started dating in 2015, got engaged at the end of 2018, planned a May 2020 wedding, and postponed it four times due to you-know-what. Not wanting to put our lives on hold indefinitely, we officially tied the knot with our families on September 12, 2020. That was pre-vaccines, so we couldn’t do any sort of big celebration.\n\n“Fast forward to September 17, 2021, and we welcomed son Ian Tishan Gunaratna and then just finally had our big wedding celebration on May 20 at the Omni Mount Washington Resort in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire! We were incredibly lucky to have lots of ’11s in attendance: Shanel Balloo and Katie Gandy were bridesmaids, and Grace Taveras, Ahra Cho, Katie Paxton, Isaiah Berg, Calvin and Tess (Korndorf) Woodring, Masha Barsky, Lars Osterberg, Andrea Imhof, Jenii Shin, Anna Pudimat, Emily Baxter, Sophie Novack, Marielle (Battistoni) Fortune, and Dennis Zeveloff ’12 all joined us to celebrate. It was the best—we can’t believe it finally happened, and we are now very much enjoying the summer as boring married people and parents to a rambunctious and adorable almost-10-month-old!”\n\nThanks to Katie, Shanel also wrote in with a big update! “Isaiah and I had a baby last year: Elijah Berg, born July 2021. He’s been a pretty great baby overall, and at almost a year in, we’re still adjusting to being parents.”\n\nOn May 31 I saw that Allison Lure posted photos of Jen Fownes, Nozomi Hitomi, Kate Arion, and Stephanie Han at Amanda Devine’s wedding. I asked for more details from Allison and Amanda, but no responses as of press time, so stay tuned! (Getting Class Notes updates can be like herding cats!)\n\n—Hillary S. Cheng, 26611 La Roda, Mission Viejo, CA 92691; (603) 546-8452; hillary.s.cheng@dartmouth.edu\n\nNo one sent in any updates for this column, so I’ll mention some class news from February: Rosie Brennan competed in cross country skiing at the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics. Rosie skied in the women’s sprint free (where she came in fourth), women’s team sprint classic (fifth), women’s 4-by-5 relay (sixth), women’s 30K free mass start (sixth), women’s 10K classic (13th), and women’s skiathlon (14th). Rosie was one of eight Dartmouth alums who participated in the most recent Olympics; the others were Susan Dunklee ’08 (biathlon), Tommy Ford ’12 (alpine skiing), A.J. Hurt ’23 (alpine skiing), Julia Kern ’19 (cross-country skiing), Tricia Mangan ’19 (alpine skiing), Nina O’Brien ’20 (alpine skiing), and Laura Stacey ’16 (ice hockey—Canada). Congrats to all!\n\nAs for me and Thomas Lane, we wrapped up fostering five surprise Asian spitz puppies in mid-March and were quite relieved to see them adopted out. Five puppies are a nightmare; I don’t know how breeders do it! And I thought we were saving one dog off a shelter euthanasia list, but I guess we saved six. Anyway, we are getting the puppies’ mom, Yuki—our original foster!—spayed in May and then we will adopt her. (“Yuki” means “snow” in Japanese. Xiaolu Li ’12 says every white dog is named Yuki or Mochi, and she’s right, haha. So I decided Yuki’s full name is Yuki Doggu, inspired by our vet’s Korean grandparents living in Japan who called all their dogs Doggu, but we still just call her Yuki.)\n\nYuki is getting along superbly with our two resident Shorkie-poo mixes Kuro (girl) and Goma (boy). (Their names mean “black” and “sesame” in Japanese—for “black sesame.”) Kuro and Goma are rescues themselves that are on their third home after they were adopted from a shelter as 9-week-old puppies, surrendered at 2 years old, adopted by a second family, surrendered again at 3 years old, and adopted by us in October 2020 after they spent 24 hours in foster. We’re taking all three to Pismo Beach, California, next week where they’ll see the beach and ocean for the first time!\n\nPlease write in with your updates! We love hearing from y’all!\n\n—Hillary S. Cheng, 26611 La Roda, Mission Viejo, CA 92691; (603) 546-8452; hillary.s.cheng@dartmouth.edu\n\nBrandon Aiono wrote the following overheard-style update toward the end of December. Have fun guessing the secret ’11s! Note: While some attributions reflect our classmates’ true initials, some have been further anonymized! We asked y’all to send in coincidental encounters with other ’11s you had throughout 2021—a year that saw us leaving (and, in some cases, fleeing) our homes and intermingling once again. Here are some (curated) highlights.\n\n“What a trip! I saw L.V. in a jazz venue on Frenchmen Street in New Orleans when I was passing through during the summer. Turns out she was only around for the weekend too. We cheers-ed to that,” says A.S.\n\n“I matched with B.B. on Hinge during lockdown. We hung out a few times in Los Angeles and we’re still hanging out,” says R.S.\n\n“Does watching the Sex Lives of College Girls and being accosted with Dartmouth references count as a coincidental encounter?” asks M.C.\n\n“I ran into C.C. and her fiancé taking engagement photos in front of the Bellagio. At first I was like, ‘Who is blocking the whole sidewalk off during the fountain show?’ Of course only a Dartmouth ’11 would be so bold,” says A.V.\n\n“I saw M.K. drive by me in Park City, Utah, and waved. Then she stole my parking spot,” says A.V.\n\n“I saw J.C. at the N.Y.C. Marathon. We smiled and nodded at one another, then continued on our way. That’s generally my desired form of interaction when I run into alumni out in the world,” says B.M.\n\n“A friend invited me to a movie premiere showing in Denver, and the director was K.K.!” says T.K.\n\n“K.A. and L.B. sat a row behind me at the Spider-Man: No Way Home premiere,” says S.R.\n\n“I was walking through Alamo Square when I heard a shout and saw a figure slip down a sloped muddy hill on my left. I grabbed the person, who turned out to be S.M. Behind her walking a massive dog was B.H., who she was visiting in San Francisco. Party on, ladies,” says B.A.\n\n“For the entire year I fortunately have avoided any unanticipated Dartmouth encounters (or have blocked them from memory). I hope this streak will continue in 2022,” says J.K.\n\n—Hillary S. Cheng, 26611 La Roda, Mission Viejo, CA 92691; (603) 546-8452; hillary.s.cheng@dartmouth.edu\n\nNo one sent in Class Notes updates in the last two months, so I went around soliciting some, and this is what I got in response! For context, a decent amount of the following conversations occurred in a group text among the class officers.\n\nYan Fan is entering her fifth year in Tokyo, where she spends most of her time petting her French bulldog Potato and stress-exercising. She would like to let everyone know that living in Tokyo is awesome. Yan told me that I am the only Microsoft Word user she knows who is under 50, but such is life as an attorney, and I said Thomas Lane is even more pro at Word since he is an engineer and they love their documentation.\n\nAdam J. Reed says: “Thirty-two-year-old divorced male sees doctor for first time since Dartmouth. Doctor tells him he’s fat and lazy.” Katie Paxton (class president) says, “He’s a sweet guy.” I agree!\n\nJames Khun (class treasurer) moved to San Francisco in March of 2020, and when people ask what he does for a living, his response is, “Cry.” Brandon Aiono (class vice president) confirms, “He really does cry a lot.”\n\nBrandon was in Irvine, California, during the last week of October, when I happened to be visiting Big Bear Lake, California. (I got super carsick on the way up. I do not recommend the car ride to Big Bear, but the 40-to-60-degree weather was a huge improvement over the 90-degree heatwave in Orange County.) Brandon was a groomsman and emcee at his cousin’s wedding, and he says it was the “best night of my life.” Brandon being in Irvine reminded me that David Gomez lives in Orange County too (apparently Thomasand I have been living practically next to him since we moved in January 2020), and Brandon insisted, “David Gomez was objectively the best-looking ’11 by far. Quote me.” Brandon also says that Maya Granit got married. Congratulations, Maya!\n\nBrandon, James, and Katiethen discussed the origins of the “one-full-two-halves” reference from our college days, which apparently involved Stephen Greif. (I had never heard of the reference before, and on that note, send us your stories from undergrad for discussion in Class Notes! James suggests we can do “a redemption story on real-world two-halves-one-full dilemmas.”) Katie also says she has a photo of “some ’11s going up for Homecoming,” but she did not say who these classmates were. But Katie did play pong while visiting Dartmouth with this group of ’11s!\n\nThat’s a wrap! Now please send us some college stories for discussion and inclusion in future Class Notes! Oh, and per Brandon, Sydney Ribot is our bequest chair, “So if you’re making a will, check in with her.”\n\n—Hillary S. Cheng, 26611 La Roda, Mission Viejo, CA 92691; (603) 546-8452; hillary.s.cheng@dartmouth.edu\n\nThe following is a message from our class executive committee.\n\nThe votes have been tallied, and it is with a hearty hail that we greet Katie Paxton in her newly elected position as president and James Khun in his new position as treasurer. The two will join a “core” team with incumbents Brandon Aiono as vice president and Hillary S. Cheng as secretary. These officers will serve until our next reunion in 2025, which will again be a clustered reunion with the classes of 2009 and 2010.\n\nWe applaud and praise the time and effort that Christine Souffrant Ntim and Shelley Han invested in their respective roles as president and treasurer. During the past six years, our country and our world have been through so much since the five-year reunion, and our class is lucky to have had such a fine core at its helm.\n\nPlease still feel free to contact us to indicate your interest in participating in class activities and serving in an appointed role on the class executive committee. We can be reached via our class email address, dartmouth.class.of.2011@dartmouth.edu. We welcome all levels of involvement, and we truly enjoy forging and strengthening classmate relationships. To those who have already expressed interest in supporting class-related activities: We will be in touch in the coming months and look forward to working together.\n\nAs always, we hope you are well and staying safe. Please send in updates to let us know how you are doing. We love hearing from you!\n\n—Hillary S. Cheng, 26611 La Roda, Mission Viejo, CA 92691; (603) 546-8452; hillary.s.cheng@ dartmouth.edu\n\nJen McDonald wrote in with an update. She is still in Burlington, Vermont, and has tried to make the most of the pandemic by finishing hiking the 100 highest mountains in New England this past summer with her now-husband, Peter Johnson. They got married in a small ceremony in September and are looking forward to celebrating their anniversary at the Lodge, where the ceremony was originally going to be held. Congratulations, Jen!\n\nAnd congratulations and Happy Mother’s Day to Nadine Fedorenko (daughter Sasha), Kathleen Mayer (daughter Eleanore), and Kim Ross (daughter Sloane)! As always, send all your updates on births, weddings, and other fun celebratory events my way—or to whoever the class secretary is for the next four years!\n\nOn that note, our 10-year reunion, which was originally scheduled for 2020 and rescheduled to this year, has been canceled as of February 2. As such, we will next see each other in 2025 for our 15-year reunion, and by the time this Class Notes update reaches you, we will be in the process of selecting our new class officers or onboarding our new officers. The new leadership team will officially begin their terms on or after July 1. (Given the publication delay in Class Notes updates, I will be writing the column through the June 28 deadline for the September/October issue. I will forward any further updates to the new secretary after that date!) Christine Souffrant (president), Brandon Aiono (vice president), Shelley Han (treasurer), and I (secretary) thank you for the opportunity to have served as your class officers from 2016 through 2021, and we have greatly enjoyed working with you and our executive board members. We look forward to seeing you at alumni events or wherever our paths may cross, and we hope you are doing well and staying safe. Take care!\n\n—Hillary S. Cheng, 26611 La Roda, Mission Viejo, CA 92691; (603) 546-8452; hillary.s.cheng@dartmouth.edu\n\nPlease welcome a guest column from Kalina Newmark.\n\nHello from snowy Calgary! I am excited to be your guest columnist and share with you all my recent appointment to Dartmouth’s Association of Alumni (AOA) executive committee in addition to other personal highlights for the year. As for many of you, 2020 has been a year of lows and highs, including the passing of my grandfather and great uncle, both Air Force veterans, the birth of niece Lily Jane, and the purchase of a new home in Seattle. Although 2021 cannot come soon enough, I am grateful for the time that I have spent with my family and loved ones.\n\nIn that spirit of gratitude, I will talk about Dartmouth. Almost 14 years ago (can you believe it?!) we embarked on our journey to Hanover—a place we would call home for the next four years. We went on DOC trips, ran around the bonfire during Homecoming, and participated in Winter Carnival. Although Dartmouth is not a perfect place, I have tried my best to make Dartmouth a better place than when we left it. Since graduation I have served on Alumni Council, the Native American visiting committee and the Native American Alumni at Dartmouth board, interviewed students as part of the admissions ambassador program, and presented my linguistics research on Native American English on-campus. Most recently I have been nominated and appointed as the second vice president of the AOA executive committee. As part of my appointment I also sit on the professional development and alumni liaison committees on Alumni Council.\n\nThe AOA was organized in 1854 to represent all Dartmouth alumni. AOA membership includes “every person who has ever matriculated as a fulltime student in pursuit of a Dartmouth degree.” I am excited to contribute to this longstanding institution at Dartmouth and share my perspective not only as a young alumnus but as a Native American alumnus as well. Through all of my volunteer activities at the College, there is only one thing that I am constantly amazed by—the love our alumni have for Dartmouth and for our students.\n\nIt is an honor to serve as your second vice president on the AOA. If you have any concerns or feedback about the College, please feel free to reach out at kalina.newmark@gmail.com. Mahsi cho (thank you) for the opportunity to be your guest columnist. Wishing you and your families a safe, healthy, and abundant year.\n\n—Hillary S. Cheng, 26611 La Roda, Mission Viejo, CA 92691; (603) 546-8452; hillary.s.cheng@dartmouth.edu\n\nI learned that Danny Kim had become a professor at Wharton and was working on some interesting research about immigrants, so I reached out to him to see how he was doing! He wrote in, “Hi, ’11s! Sending in a quick update here: After finishing my Ph.D. (six years—brutal), my wife, Grace, and I recently moved from Boston to Philly for my first academic job as an assistant professor at the Wharton School at University of Pennsylvania. It’s been a lot of fun researching and teaching entrepreneurship. As an example, my colleagues and I recently put out a study showing that immigrants in the United States create more jobs than they take. Using confidential, population-level data from the federal government, we find that immigrants are much more likely to start new companies than natives, and the resulting job creation from these immigrant-founded startups far exceeds the number of jobs that immigrants take in the labor market—ultimately creating a positive ripple-effect on the economy. Of course, let me know if you’re ever in the Philly area when we’re back to our new normal!”\n\nSpeaking of entrepreneurship generally, our classmate Sam McIntire, along with his cofounder Matt Davis, has opened a food business, Mosaic Foods, that makes plant-centric frozen meals and delivers to the northeastern United States.\n\nHope you are all staying safe and warm during these cold months! As always, please reach out to me with classmate updates (or if you’d like to write a guest column!).\n\n—Hillary S. Cheng, 26611 La Roda, Mission Viejo, CA 92691; (603) 546-8452; hillary.s.cheng@dartmouth.edu\n\nPlease welcome a guest column by Nikki Del Principe.\n\nHello, fellow ’11s! I’m writing this from my husband’s and my new home in Memphis, Tennessee (you may have known me as Nikki Brown, but after getting married last August to Kevin Del Principe, I changed my last name). For me, these challenging times have shed light on the value of adaptability—a quality that my time at Dartmouth helped foster.\n\nI had a career plan when I started my freshman year, but, probably like many of you, my path ultimately diverged quite a bit from my initial conception. I arrived in the fall of 2007 with the aim of studying biology to become a naturalist. In fact, my dream since third grade had been to become a sort of Jane Goodall for wild cats. As fantastical and perhaps naive as this ambition was, I was on track to realize my goal. While at Dartmouth I did an internship modeling the population dynamics of wildebeest, went on the biology study abroad program in Costa Rica and the Cayman Islands, and then did another study abroad program for aspiring animal behavioralists in Kenya through Michigan State University. Throughout this time I was also taking film classes and feeding a hunger for storytelling that I’ve had since I was a child. As much as I loved learning about the natural world, by the time spring of 2011 rolled around I realized that storytelling was my real calling.\n\nI started the M.F.A. writing for screen and television program at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles that fall. Film school was challenging in a very different way than my biology studies had been. It took me a few years to learn that writing wasn’t about getting the right answer and more about a process of discovery that never really ends. Perhaps the best part of USC was that I met my eventual husband and creative partner, Kevin Del Principe, there.\n\nWe became a couple and creative team after graduation and made two short films before embarking on our first feature, Up on the Glass (watch the trailer here: https://vimeo.com/369844065).\n\nThe story is about a wanderer named Jack DiMercurio who secretly desires the life and wife of his more affluent friend, Andy Shelton. One heinous act allows Jack to draw closer to Andy’s wife, Liz, but Jack finds living Andy’s life is a dangerous lie. Fun movie fact: The three main characters met at Dartmouth. It’s been quite the journey to work on one project for six years and finally arrive at the point where we can share it with audiences. (It’s currently available across streaming platforms and on Blu-ray and DVD in North American via our distributor, Gravitas Ventures.)\n\nThough I did not end up researching animal behavior as I had planned, the ability to adapt to changing circumstances and interests that I originally fostered at Dartmouth has been immensely helpful in independent filmmaking. It is this ability to evolve in the face of new challenges that has allowed me to continue to grow as an artist. Kevin and I created our production company, Save Them Wild Dogs, to tell the stories of the misunderstood, misrepresented, and too-often overlooked, with a focus on the Midwest and mid-South. To find out more about the film, visit upontheglass.com and our production company at savethemwilddogs.com. Feel free to reach out to me via my website, nikkidelprincipe.com. I’d love to hear from you!\n\n—Hillary S. Cheng, 26611 La Roda, Mission Viejo, CA 92691; (603) 546-8452; hillary.s.cheng@dartmouth.edu\n\nIn June our executive committee issued the following message.While the submissions via Google Forms have since closed, please get in touch with us at dartmouth.class.of.2011@dartmouth.edu with any comments you would like to share.\n\n“Dear 2011 classmates, our hearts are extraordinarily heavy. We have been saddened and enraged by the recent murders of Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, George Floyd, Tony McDade, Rayshard Brooks, Dominique Fells, and the countless others who have had their lives cut short due to police brutality and systemic racism and oppression. We condemn racism, white supremacy, and state-sanctioned and extralegal violence, and we stand in solidarity with our Black classmates and the Black communities around the globe: Black Lives Matter.\n\n“We have heard from you and seen some of your reactions to the present moment and know many of you are working to learn and unlearn. You are supporting our peers and other friends and colleagues. You are mobilizing in the streets, donating, and challenging yourselves, your family members, coworkers, and each other. We write to you to ask that you continue this throughout the summer and beyond. Do not let this momentum fade away! It will feel uncomfortable, but there cannot be a return to ‘normal.’ We must remember: Our agency, our actions, and our futures are all interconnected, and we owe it to ourselves and each other to help build a better world. In the words of Fannie Lou Hamer, ‘Nobody’s free until everybody’s free.’ We must all speak up and show up whenever and wherever there is injustice.\n\n“As your class executive committee, it is our job to serve as liaisons between you and the College. We are always here to communicate your questions, suggestions, and concerns to Dartmouth leadership, and we are especially committed to using our platform to do so at this time, particularly since we know issues related to race, access, and inclusion are, of course, deeply rooted and pervade every aspect of our society—including Dartmouth. If Dartmouth leadership continues to rhetorically emphasize the importance of ‘diversity,’ they must actually confront and dismantle the College’s own institutional racism and meet the intellectual, physical, mental, emotional, financial, and social needs of all students.\n\n“As alumni, our voices carry weight. As the committee communicates with the College regarding these issues over the next few months and throughout our tenure, we want our correspondence to be informed by your specific feedback and calls for action. If you have questions, recommendations, or solutions you would like us to relay, please submit them here by June 30, and we will communicate them to President Hanlon and other leaders on behalf of the members of the class of 2011. We also are working to create a coalition with other young alumni classes and regional clubs so that they may do the same.\n\n“Thank you for your time and energy. Be well and stay safe.”\n\n—Hillary S. Cheng, 26611 La Roda, Mission Viejo, CA 92691; (603) 546-8452; hillary.s.cheng@dartmouth.edu\n\nWe’re happy to announce that Emily Duke will be taking over the Alumni Council representative position as we say goodbye to Delfina Gonzalez, who just finished her three-year term as our representative! Thank you again, Delfina, for a wonderful three years of service!\n\nAnother bit of class notes—while we won’t be seeing each other this summer due to the quarantine, planning is underway for a delayed reunion, so stay tuned. Your class officers—Christine Souffrant (president), Brandon Aiono (vice president), Shelley Han (treasurer), and me, Hillary S. Cheng (secretary)—and the 10-year reunion chairs Michael Brown, Marguerite V. Imbert, and Shayla Mars—will remain in their positions through 2021, when we hope to celebrate our rescheduled reunion.\n\nCynthia Akagbosu wrote in with an update: “Hello, fellow ’11s. I had the pleasure of marrying fellow ’11 Nathan Swire last summer in May. It was a three-day Jewish, Nigerian, and Catholic wedding bonanza. The bridal party had a great showing from the ’11 class, with Alex Gonazalez, Adriene McCance, Sarah Seng, and Caroline Ward as well as Nathan’s mother, Anne Scott-Putney ’81. I graduated from Tufts University School of Medicine in 2017 and am finishing up my last year at Boston Children’s Hospital in its pediatrics residency program. I am starting a pediatric gastroenterology fellowship at Children’s National Medical Center this summer. Nathan graduated from Harvard Law School shortly after the wedding, has been clerking in the federal district court in Boston under Judge William Young during the past year, and will be joining me in Washington, D.C., to start as an associate lawyer at White & Case.”\n\nHow have you been spending the quarantine? Write in and let us know!\n\n—Hillary S. Cheng, 26611 La Roda, Mission Viejo, CA 92691; (603) 546-8452; hillary.s.cheng@dartmouth.edu\n\nPlease welcome a guest column by Jennifer Robinson.\n\nHello fellow ‘11s! I currently live in North Carolina, where I’ve been working for the past 4 years as an attorney with Legal Aid of North Carolina (LANC) Battered Immigrant Project. (This is written in my personal capacity and does not reflect the opinion of LANC.) I represent survivors of domestic violence, sexual assault, and human trafficking in applying for legal immigration status so they can remain in the United States—where their support network is, where they are protected by our law enforcement, and where they are receiving social services and therapy related to their victimization.\n\nI can’t imagine doing anything else, but it is emotionally challenging work. Handing someone their first-ever work permit or green card is a meaningful and humbling experience. However, we are constantly facing new challenges. You can imagine for yourself the traumas my clients experience before meeting me, so I want to share with you the policy change that has impacted my daily work the most. At my organization, we provide free legal services to low-income people, who often cannot afford to pay immigration application fees, which range from $400 to more than $2,000 for a single case. For a family of five, you do the math. It’s possible to request a fee waiver if the applicant demonstrates an inability to pay. For survivors of violence, this used to be a simple process of explaining their income or lack thereof.\n\nIn the summer of 2018, humanitarian fee waiver requests were being denied with no warning of a policy change. Now, the government is drastically stricter on the evidence required to obtain a fee waiver. Many of my clients win a fee waiver by submitting their tax returns, but sometimes even these are denied in a manner that can only be described as random. Unfortunately, I just received a second denial for one client. For our second attempt, we again submitted her taxes and added more proof of her struggling business. It still wasn’t enough. She is a single mother recovering from her abusive ex-husband both emotionally and financially, and she doesn’t have an extra $2,000 for her application, so we’ll try a third time.\n\nUndocumented people can file taxes, and millions of them do every year. However, many people experiencing domestic violence or human trafficking are not permitted by their abusers to file taxes or are too afraid to do so. What if someone is a stay-at-home mother, recently escaped from her abusive husband and staying with a friend? She has no income, no rent payment, and no evidence to show that she cannot afford the immigration fee. I have seen families go into debt to come up with $4,000 that could have been spent on food and clothes for their children. For the survivors of violence I work with, these fee waiver denials stand in the way of applying for legal status, preventing deportation, staying here with their U.S. citizen children, and continuing their healing journeys in the United States.\n\nWe persevere, and we often win. I just received an email with Christmas greetings from a former client whom I helped win her green card: “We remember you with immense gratitude for all the good you did for us.” It’s the best feeling in the world to read that. Please feel free to reach out to me if you have questions about immigration. My husband, Dan Mott ’12, and I live in the Raleigh, North Carolina, area with our dog Maya. Let us know if you are ever in North Carolina!\n\n—Hillary S. Cheng, 16013 Legacy Road, Unit 304, Tustin CA 92782; (603) 546-8452; hillary.s.cheng@dartmouth.edu\n\nClass VP Brandon Aiono here, filling in for this issue. I was on campus in March for the Granite Challenge, reaching out to several of you alongside seven other ’11s who made the trek up to Hanover for the weekend. Also in attendance were the following.\n\nCaroline Ward is currently working at a startup based out of Providence, Rhode Island, where she manages support and security operations.\n\nEvan Lambert is writing fulltime for the Buzzfeed-lite site Topix.com and performing in a monthly show in N.Y.C. called the Improvised Real Housewives Episode (a metro New York critics’ pick)!\n\nRyan Speers lives in Washington, D.C., and is focusing on running his security consulting business (River Loop Security) along with Ricky Melgares, while working on a product startup focused on firmware security (Pilot Security).\n\nJames Khun also lives in D.C. and works as a quantitative analyst for an applied research firm. When not running regression models, he’s embracing entering his 30s by curating his newfound obsession with houseplants.\n\nTina Alexander is living it up in Austin, Texas, and just closed out her first year of graduate school, earning a master’s in social work at the University of Texas. She occasionally meets up with Chris Alexander, her twin brother, who feeds her now that she’s a broke student again.\n\nZach Blatt is living out his dream this summer, driving all the way from his home in New Hampshire to Lake Tahoe, California, and, he hopes, down the coastline in July. The trip will roughly follow I-80 and should include plenty of baseball games and national parks (Zach has only been to two).\n\nDelfina Gonzalez is starting her eighth year living in the Boston area. When she’s not busy torturing her boyfriend with Dartmouth stories, the two enjoy salsa dancing, eating out, and playing board games with friends. In addition to currently working in clinical operations managing clinical studies, Delfina continues to serve as our class representative to the Alumni Council, so be sure to send her any comments, questions, and concerns that you have about the College before the next session meets in October!\n\nThanks to everyone who answered our calls during the Camp Granite weekend, and be aware that there’s a new Dartmouth College Fund challenge that’s just begun. Each class that reaches 45-percent participation this year will have a $100,000 financial aid endowment created in its name (one that lasts forever)! For current standings, check here: www.dartgo.org/d11challenge.\n\nTwo additional updates through the mailbag.\n\nFirst, William Aubin saved up all his major post-graduation life accomplishments thus far into the past year. Not only was he married to Hayley Tran in June 2018—celebrating with Mateusz Grudzien, Brandon Floch, Nick and Priya (Rajgopal) Rolfes, John Roland, John Underwood, David Friedman, Ryan Murphy ’09, Brendan Mahoney ’12, and Ryan Tincher ’12—he also just completed his M.B.A. at University of Chicago in June and started a job at AveXis, a biotech company, in May. But the highlight of the year is welcoming his first child, Calvin Tran Aubin, into the world at the end of August. He’d love to have more Dartmouth alums come visit, so if you’re ever swinging through Chicago, let him know!\n\nFinally, Thomas Tao moved to L.A. with his girlfriend, Julie Fiveash ’13, for a new position as a senior producer at Marvel, where he’ll be handling its Asia partnerships for video games. He hopes to acquire a lot of Marvel swag, and I hope he can tell me what’s next for the Avengers.\n\n—Hillary S. Cheng, 16013 Legacy Road, Unit 304, Tustin CA 92782; (603) 546-8452; hillary.s.cheng@dartmouth.edu\n\nPlease welcome a guest column by Maggie Lin: “Like many, I have spent every year since graduation attempting to live up to my Dartmouth education. As a philosophy major, that proved to be difficult as evidenced by my resume, which reflects a different job every single year in four different countries since our graduation in 2011. However, all the jobs I had around the world brought me closer to my Dartmouth family than I could possibly imagine. And perhaps that was always the intention behind the small College on the Hill. I reside in L.A., where I run a nonprofit called Foster Nation (www.fosternation.org) with a mission to support and empower foster youth as they age out of the foster care system. Our goal is to rally and engage millennials and young leaders to champion the foster care cause so that we can foster a nation of supporters, mentors, and future foster parents for the 400,000-plus children who are in the system today through no fault of their own. We have been fortunate enough to have the generous support of the Anthony & Jeanne Pritzker Family Foundation (led by Tony Pritzker ’81), which allows our organization to collaborate with the county and established nonprofits working in the foster care space because they are also part of the Pritzker foster care initiative.\n\n“My journey to Foster Nation was not easy. I understand firsthand the vulnerability of sharing your life story with people who may possibly not understand. In my time at Dartmouth I may have shared with a few of my classmates, but not more than a handful, that I grew up in the foster care system. While this was a large part of my identity, having lived through eight different foster homes in 10 years, I was too ashamed and afraid to stand out from my classmates—many of whom had families to return to during the winter and summer vacations. While I had a foster family that I was close to, I spent the majority of my breaks looking for opportunities. The reality is that the years I spent at Dartmouth were the most stable and the longest period of time I had spent anywhere. For the safe haven Dartmouth gave me, I have always felt an undying loyalty to serve and give back to the Dartmouth community.\n\n“I overcame the fear of being seen as ‘different’ or ‘damaged’ by asking myself this question: How can anyone actually find a solution to a problem they don’t know exists? The answer came in the form of cofounding Foster Nation and starting the Young Leaders Collective, a group of professionals and change-makers who are successful in their careers and want to give back in some way. The launch of the L.A. chapter included Kyle Battle and Shayla Mars, and the New York chapter includes Amaris Galea-Orbe and previously Jane Cai ’13. We have had incredible supporters such as Tony Pritzker and his family, Jan Brzeski ’89 and his wife, the Dartmouth Club of Los Angeles, and many other alums from different years. When I realized that it was important to speak up and speak out about my experiences in foster care, the support and love I received from the people around me, especially the Dartmouth community, was unbelievable. This was when I understood what Daniel Webster meant when he uttered, ‘Sir, it is a small college, yet there are those who love it.’ It is precisely the smallness of Dartmouth, with the bigness of those who attend it, that reminds me why I loved and continue to love our College.”\n\n—Hillary S. Cheng, 16013 Legacy Road, Unit 304, Tustin, CA 92782; (603) 546-8452; hillary.s.cheng@dartmouth.edu\n\nPlease join me in welcoming Katie Dowty to our class! Our dear classmate Melanie Pastuck recommended that we adopt Katie into our class earlier this year, and the adoption process has finally finished! Katie is currently the varsity head coach of the Dartmouth women’s rugby program. In nominating Katie, Melanie Pastuck wrote, “Katie Dowty became the first varsity head coach of the Dartmouth women’s rugby program when she was hired in June 2015. Since that time, she has brought the team (with a club sports history) to the very top of the rankings for U.S. collegiate rugby, with multiple Ivy League titles under her belt and Dartmouth currently ranked No. 2 in the country. Her commitment to the program and the way that she is inspiring Dartmouth undergrads is truly incredible. Attracting top national and international talent to Hanover as assistant and guest coaches, Coach Dowty has given the student-athletes an amazing and unparalleled rugby experience. Coach Dowty has also often said that she feels so much more connected to the passion and the spirit of Dartmouth than she ever did to her own alma mater (Harvard), and loves our community so much that she has recently purchased a home in Hanover. With regard to connection with our class, the class of 2011 formally applied for the women’s rugby team to become varsity at the end of my senior year. Four years later the proposal was finally approved by the athletics department (budget and recommendations virtually unchanged!)—and Coach Dowty has become the living embodiment of the vision we had for the future NCAA program. I would love to extend an invitation for her adoption into our class, as she helped make the dream for the players in our class year a reality.” In a recent email, Melanie also noted this exciting update: “Coach Dowty and the team also just won the first-ever national championship in the program’s history in a huge win over Harvard two weeks ago!”\n\nIn other news, two of our classmates made the Forbes’ “30 Under 30” list this year. Congratulations to Daniel Hochman and Jana Landon for their incredible work. To quote from the Dartmouth alumni website feature, Daniel “heads research into environmental, social, and governance factors in investing at Bridgewater Associates,” and Jana “manages Google’s outreach efforts with historically black colleges and universities, matching engineers with computer science classes at the schools.” Keep doing amazing things! (And drop me an email so we can include your amazing deeds in our Class Notes!)\n\n—Hillary S. Cheng, 16013 Legacy Road, Unit 304, Tustin, CA 92782; (603) 546-8452; hillary.s.cheng@dartmouth.edu\n\nHard to believe you’ll be reading this column in 2019! Time flies. It’s still October as I’m writing this, and Homecoming Weekend at Dartmouth is about to begin. Eleven years have passed since we paraded around campus and ran our 11 (or 111) laps around the bonfire!\n\nJen McDonald wrote in with a wonderful update about her recent engagement in early October. She wrote, “After a couple trips to the old lodge to help with the new bunkhouses and hike other N.H. mountains, Peter Johnson (UVM ’11) and I got engaged this month on the top of Mount Moosilauke. I had initially thought that the momentous relationship milestone of the weekend was simply our first Moosilauke hike together! We’re also currently working on hiking New England’s 100 highest peaks and would love to catch up with any of you next time you’re near Burlington, Vermont!”\n\nThomas Lane and I saw Jenny Zhao and Roger Zhu a few weekends ago when they were visiting Los Angeles. Jenny loves animals, and they visited the Shambala Preserve in Acton, California, about an hour outside of L.A., which cares for big cats that used to belong to circuses, zoos, or private owners. Before Jenny and Roger left on their flight out of LAX, we had brunch in Venice and visited the canals, inspired by the Venetian canals in Italy, that were just around the corner!\n\nAmanda Trunzo was recently quoted by The Boston Globe in an article about Fenway Park hosting an extreme winter sports event, the ice cross downhill course, in February. Amanda is the reigning women’s ice cross downhill world champion, and she played hockey while at Dartmouth.\n\nWrite me with your updates! How far have the ’11s come in the 11 years since we first arrived at the College on the Hill? And where will we be in another 11?!\n\n—Hillary S. Cheng, 16013 Legacy Road, Unit 304, Tustin, CA 92782; (603) 546-8452; hillary.s.cheng@dartmouth.edu\n\nHey, ’11s! Brandon Aiono here, writing a guest Class Notes column so that Hillary Cheng and her beau, Thomas Lane, can enjoy some summer fun.\n\nWhat a wonderful and exciting year it has been for our class! A few months ago I traveled up to Beijing to help Sydney Ribot direct a short film she wrote; it was a whirlwind of a weekend, but not only did we (and almost all of the extras) survive, but her work earned her acceptance into the American Film Institute! Soon after taking the train back to Shanghai, I embarked once again to attend a writing retreat on Chongming Island organized by Lelia Taha-Burt; she led us in composing stories, songs, and slam poems by unlocking our creative energy—all this only a few weeks before her four-stop wedding tour and a few months before finishing her master’s program in intercultural communication at Shanghai Theatre Academy. Even more recently I was honored to be reinstated as vice president of the College alumni club’s China chapter for a second term alongside two classmates on the executive board—Stephenie Lee (club secretary) and Trevor King (Shanghai regional representative). We hope our first act of business will be planning a trip down to Hong Kong so local legend Steve Avila can take us for a day on the harbor and night on the town.\n\nRight now I’m home in the Bay Area, reconnecting with family and counting down the hours until Kathleen Mayer’s wedding festivities. The bride-to-be, who continues shattering societal norms even after graduation—she was the one to propose to her man—is saying her vows at a woodland retreat in the Cascades. I’m looking forward to reuniting with Amanda and Bennett Siegel, Brielle Milano, Eileen Vogl ’12, Ellie Hunter, Marian Mathias, Maya Granit, Meredith Greenberg, and Taja Braggs, and I already have bets placed on who will give the most outlandish gift, who will make the drunkest speech, and who will end up catching the bouquet (obviously me…y’all better watch out).\n\nMany ’11s are tying the knot this year—including Emily Duke, Genevieve Adams, and Mary Rockwell—with even more on the way, such as Tyler Ford, who just got engaged while on a trip to Monaco. For those of you who are nuptial-ed out, fret not—bridal parties are about to be replaced with baby showers. Carter Scott spent this Father’s Day celebrating the birth of his new daughter, just one of a handful of ’11s to ascend into parenthood. As the season for dads is also one for grads, we want to congratulate all of the masters, doctors, and b-school ballers who completed degrees this spring, such as Joe Coleman, who I’m sad to have missed while he toured China earlier in the summer. Remember to keep sending in your announcements and updates to the class account. We love knowing what y’all are doing, and we know your classmates do, too!\n\nWhen I passed through New Orleans a few weeks back, I serendipitously ran into Lindsay Van Landeghem, who was in town from South Africa for a conference. I am making plans to meet with Madolyn Mertz, who recently moved to San Francisco to be with her fiancé (another wedding!). I love meeting and catching up with members of our great class. At my sister’s graduation earlier this month I discovered that her best friend’s father (Matthew Berardo ’86) is a Dartmouth alumnus, and as we shared our memories with one another, I felt a tacit understanding pass between us. There is truly no feeling more magical ’round this girdled earth than running into another soul whose heart has bled green in the wilderness of the still north.\n\n—Hillary S. Cheng, 16013 Legacy Road, #304, Tustin, CA 92782; (603) 546-8452; hillary.s.cheng@dartmouth.edu\n\nIt’s April now, and the class of 2011’s executive committee will be hopping on a conference call in May for a planning session headed up by our class president, Christine Souffrant. Would you like to see a mini-reunion in your area? Drop us a note at dartmouth classof2011@gmail.com so we can pass it on to our regional chairs!\n\nSydney Thomashow sent me an update to say that she and Chris Barth ’08 met and collaborated on a panel at SXSW, where they discussed “design thinking” and how it can be applied to branding, marketing, and other creative endeavors.\n\nIda Sargent and Rosie Brennan were mentioned in the Valley News for Ida’s third-place and Rosie’s fifth-place finishes in the six-athlete final of the women’s sprint of the U.S. Ski and Snowboard SuperTour at the Craftsbury (Vermont) Outdoor Center on March 23.\n\nAlice Bradley also sent a note to say that she’ll be starting a faculty position as an assistant professor at Williams College this summer. Alice writes, “I’ll be in the geoscience department, where I’ll teach classes related to climate and continue my research in how to measure changing Arctic sea ice environments.”\n\nBrandon Aiono is stateside for a few months while transitioning between jobs in China. Say hi to him if you’re in the Bay Area! He’ll be here until August, so hurry up before you miss him. After August you can find him in Shanghai. Adam Reed has also recently relocated to the Bay Area to work at an accounting firm. He just successfully completed the firm’s usual probationary internship and received a fulltime offer! Now you know who to contact for your taxes.\n\nRaj Majumder is currently in an M.B.A. program at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee, and will be in Thousand Oaks, near L.A., for his summer internship at Amgen. He and Tom Lane will be doing a week-long road trip from Nashville out to the West Coast!\n\nSpeaking of L.A., Marco Chu just completed another stair-climb and fundraising effort for the American Lung Association’s Fight for Air Climb here, involving 1,391 stairs and 63 floors.\n\nWhenasked for an update, Gabriel Lopez, who is now an attorney, said, “I left my beloved Connecticut and took my talents down to South Beach to work at White & Case’s bank finance practice.”\n\nConrad Whitaker has had an exciting 11 years out of college in places quite far from Hanover. He writes, “Since graduating, I’ve spent most of my time abroad (except for a brief stint in San Francisco). I studied Arabic in Egypt, lived in a tent on the Nile in South Sudan while working for a research company, and in 2014, I moved to Nairobi initially to work as a consultant supporting renewable energy companies in East Africa. For the past three years I’ve been managing operations and distribution for a PayGo solar company, Azuri Technologies, where we distribute integrated solar home systems (solar panels, batteries, lights, etc.), coupled with new mobile money-enabled financing solutions to allow some of the 600M Sub-Saharan Africans who are not connected to the grid to affordably adopt solar technology as an improved way to access energy. (If you are interested in this topic, you can learn more on the ‘The East Africa Business Podcast,’ where I discuss the distributed economy as a development thesis.) For anyone making their way through East Africa, give me a shout; I am always looking to catch up!”\n\n—Hillary S. Cheng, 16013 Legacy Road, #304, Tustin, CA 92782; (603) 546-8452; hillary.s.cheng@dartmouth.edu\n\nJennifer Robinson got married to Dan Mott ’12 in October, and Jenny Zhao was one of her bridesmaids!\n\nMike Lewis recently published a book, When to Jump, and he writes in: “I sketched a book cover five years ago after reading an alumni update in the winter 2013 DAM issue of a banker who turned into an Olympic cyclist. It’s been a Dartmouth-heavy project with tons of help from alums and many fellow ’11s—Tom Mandel helped edit the first story, Emily Hirshey helped me start the publishing process and Kyle Battle and Abigail Holden are featured in the book, sharing their own jumps. If anyone has a jump they want to share, send me a note at mike@whentojump.com!”\n\nDaryl Concha competed in the 2017 Women’s Flat Track Derby Association International Championships in Philadelphia on November 3-5, 2017. She is a member of the Gotham Girls Roller Derby All-Stars, based out of New York City. The Gotham All-Stars finished its season third in the world. Daryl will also compete in the Roller Derby World Cup on February 1-4, in Manchester, United Kingdom, as part of Team Indigenous. Reid Duke also wrote in: “I play Magic: The Gathering for a living and—at the time of writing—I’m the No. 2 ranked player in the world. Magic is a collectible, strategy card game that I’ve played since I was 5 years old. The professional circuit has me traveling nearly every weekend and competing against players from all across the world. In December I’ll be representing the United States at the World Magic Cup in Nice, France, as captain of the national team. Wish me luck!”\n\nWe also had a fun mini-reunion here in L.A. with the classes of 2008 to 2013 in December. Quite a few ’11s showed up—it was great to see you all!\n\n—Hillary S. Cheng, 16013 Legacy Road, #304, Tustin, CA 92782; (603) 546-8452; hillary.s.cheng@dartmouth.edu\n\nSteve Avila reports that he is alive. That’s all. Just kidding. He also writes in, “I’ve been living in southern China for the last two and a half years and work for an overseas education consulting company. I’ve been taking Mandarin classes (and took a few Cantonese classes) and can now go to KTV and ‘sing’ with my colleagues. (I was a Romance studies major, Spanish, Portuguese and French, but these languages have nothing in common with them.) Hong Kong is a border hop away (90 minutes to the island) and they have a pretty active alumni club. Caught up with Betty Jiang and Kevin Jae Hoon Koo at the Dartmouth Club of Hong Kong summer event. (We rented a yacht. Super sweet.) Oh! And I met up with Trevor King in Shanghai! The Bund is super awesome.”\n\nAbigail Ogilvy also wrote in about her contemporary art gallery, the Abigail Ogilvy Gallery in the South End in Boston, which featured Katherine Taylor ’97 and Natalia Wrobel during an exhibition that ran October 4-29. (See a profile on her and the gallery on page 55.)\n\nBill Gerath dropped a line about Denise Hotta-Moung and Lane Donald Zimmerman’s July marriage at New York City Hall and their first dog, Yoshi, a corgi.\n\nJessica Krug also has a wedding announcement to make: She married Boston University graduate Lauren Ranieri at Paradise Ridge Winter in Santa Rosa, California, with Marisa Gilmore, Mike Abendroth, Alicia Driscoll, Vera Bergengruen, Ali Herdeg, Sam McIntire, Travis Whitfield, Eliana Piper ’12 and Myesha Jackson ’02 attending. Sadly, the winery burned down in the Tubbs Fire, so the happy newlywed sends a PSA to drink more Sonoma and Napa wine so the wineries can rebuild!\n\nAnd we can expect at least one more wedding to come: Florence Ling said yes to Matt Mizuhara when he proposed! Congratulations, all!\n\n—Hillary S. Cheng, 16013 Legacy Road, #304, Tustin, CA 92782; (603) 546-8452; hillary.s.cheng@dartmouth.edu\n\nA couple of updates this time! Courtney Gerwin and Brandon Parks got married on September 3 on campus at St. Thomas Church with the reception at the DOC House. They met on campus their senior year at the Daniel Webster reception and were both elated to head back to campus to tie the knot.\n\nIn May Claire Scott received her Ph.D. from the Carolina-Duke graduate program in German studies, also completing a certificate in feminist studies at Duke University. This fall she begins a position as a lecturer in the department of Germanic and Slavic languages and literatures at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.\n\nFrom Justin Varilek: “Hey from across the pond! So I just did a slight jaunt throughout the United States and saw some amazing Dartmouth people whom I hadn’t seen for about two to three years. Shout out to Anise Vance, Suz Parker, Vera Bergengruen, Myra Altman, Antonio Brown, Elizabeth Shribman ’10, Jake Sotak ’13 and Jason Klein ’82! Apologies to everyone else I didn’t get to see. Time is not on my side.\n\n“But the trip made me realize how long I’ve been out of it. I even missed the whole Trump-a-thon. So when our class secretary reached out, I figured I should make sure people hadn’t forgotten about my existence.\n\n“After about five years in Russia I’m hoping to call Berlin home for the next two years. Don’t get me wrong, it’s not that I got my fill in Russia of running from a few riot police with a journalist or cozying up to an oligarch or two while helping MIT found a university there. It’s really just that my startup, HackPack.press, makes the decisions in my life and has banished me to a rave- and history-filled Berlin. To be honest, the startup is worse than twins as it gives me no rest and hasn’t let me stay in one country for more than a month for the entire past year.\n\n“But the good news is that the child is growing into the toddler stage and I’m getting a better grip on the reins. Essentially my team and I are building a global network for the media industry that helps publications and marketers find and hire journalists to tell the stories that matter from around the world. Basically, think of Uber, but hiring photographers, videographers and journalists instead of drivers. After launching in Moscow, then Berlin, we’ve grown to more than 10,000 members in 150 countries, and we are planning to focus on the United States after presenting the startup at a yearly journalism conference this October in D.C.\n\n“Otherwise, if you happen to be traveling through Berlin and looking for a place to stay or someone to grab a bier und currywurst with, then hit me up. Best option is via Facebook—I should be the Justin right above Bieber in the search.”\n\n—Hillary S. Cheng, 16013 Legacy Road #304, Tustin, CA 92782; (603) 546-8452; hillary.s.cheng@dartmouth.edu\n\nHere is the puppies and doggies column! But first off, some non-canine-related announcements about ’11s.\n\nAshley Morishige graduated with her Ph.D. in June from MIT, and her research focused on solar cells. She now works at a company near Boston that manufactures crystalline silicon wafers for solar cells. About a year ago she got married to Kellie Kravarik, a fellow graduate student she met at MIT. Class of ’11s who attended her wedding included Max Lifson, Nozomi Hitomi and Jen Fownes.\n\nKalina Newmark and Nacole Walker were both featured in Yes! Magazine for their research showing that ethnic identity is shaped not only by the loss—and revitalization—of mother tongues but also by the remixing of English.\n\nAbigail Ogilvy Ryan owns the Abigail Ogilvy Gallery, a contemporary art gallery in the South End in Boston that focuses on predominately female, emerging and mid-career artists. Natalia Wrobel recently spoke to a full room of both women and men at a Women of Dartmouth event at the gallery about advancing careers in the arts.\n\nAlexandra Gakos is working in academic publishing at W.W. Norton & Co. and doing freelance work. She also helped renovate a homeless shelter in Newark, New Jersey, this past May.\n\nAnd now onto the doggie updates!\n\nJenny Zhao and Roger Zhu (congratulations on your recent marriage!) are the proud parents of a rescue dog named Geoff, who has the sweetest temperament but has to get checked into doggie daycare during the week because of his disposition toward howling when he is alone in the apartment!\n\nBest friend Jennifer Robinson is also mother to a 1.5-year-old rescue pup named Maya in North Carolina. She is enjoying her work as an immigration attorney at Legal Aid of North Carolina!\n\nMax Bickett recently welcomed a puppy, Lucy, into his house in Seattle, where she will be joining Finn, his flat-coated retriever. Finn is doing great and was excited that it’s warm enough for him to go swimming in Lake Washington again (was, because this is being written in June!).\n\nMariana Estevez does not have a dog herself, but she loves all doggies! Neil Basu is in a similar situation—he loves Scottish terriers but does not have one himself. He recently hit his one-year anniversary living in Singapore, where he loves the food, travel opportunities and people, but he dislikes the humidity one degree south of the equator.\n\nMelissa Wong lives in Arlington, Virginia, with her 5-year-old beagle mix, Daphne. Melissa is plotting to move back to California soon!\n\nDiana Lim is in medical school in North Carolina and lives with a 10-month-old Australian labradoodle named Teddy. She is so cute!\n\nJohn Lee works at NerdWallet, where their office building used to allow dogs. So he used to have office dogs, but no longer because they moved buildings. Sad.\n\nBerk Ozturk is back in Turkey and he tells me that, although he does not have an actual dog, he calls his cousin a dog. Interesting.\n\nBack to real dogs. Erica Hoffmaster just finished up her first year of business school at University of Texas in Austin, and she lives there with her dog, Gus!\n\n—Hillary S. Cheng, 10930 Gray Place, Tustin, CA 92782; (603) 546-8452; hillary.s.cheng@dartmouth.edu\n\nWe almost had a whole column about Mortimer, a beautiful, gray ragdoll cat keeping house with Adam J. Reed in family-oriented Salt Lake City, Utah, but Adam didn’t want to hog the spotlight. In April Mortimer will be 3, which means he shares a birth month with my own feline, PJ. Her name is short for Patty Jr., named after my dear friend, Patrick, who acquired one cat per year in his childhood because each perished by automobile mere months after adoption, until a one-eyed cat, whose one eye works better than most cats’ two eyes, followed him home. PJ lives at home with my parents in New Hampshire. Mortimer, a pure ragdoll (the “puppy cat”), came from a breeder; PJ came from the Humane Society of Greater Nashua after she was surrendered there by a family with quite a few pets.\n\nYan Fan, who is currently working as a software engineer, also has a furry roommate, Meow Zedong, in her place in the Bay Area. Meow loves wearing cute little costumes reminiscent of her namesake, Fearless Leader, and she’s just a little under a year old! (Yan will soon be moving to Tokyo and taking Meow with her!) Also in the Bay Area is Milo, who is related to us by way of Angelo Carino, who, although not his official owner, is Milo’s second father. The sweet orange tabby loves to cuddle and lodge himself into random items of clothing.\n\nAlso in the Bay Area is Serra, Yiwei Wang’s former feline housemate. Warm and cuddly, the gray tabby and Yiwei parted ways when Yiwei moved into another apartment a few years ago, leaving behind Serra and her owner, Adam Dohner ’10.\n\nLacey resides in the same state as Meow, Milo and Serra, with Allison Parsley, who is currently living in downtown Los Angeles. She is a lovely longhair cat with a docile, sweet personality. I had the wonderful opportunity to meet her once, and she is a dear! Mariana Estevez, Annora Ng and Ji Lin also got to meet Lacey during their visits to L.A., and after her visit to L.A. and to Leo Anzagira in San Jose, Ji went home to her darling orange feline fatso (weighing in at 14 pounds!) named Autumn. She can shake hands and high-five! (Also, Annora visited quite a few ’11s while in the United States, including Jin Yan in Austin and Lei Qi in San Francisco.)\n\nA mention of Angelo Carino cannot go without speaking of Ariana Almas, who is currently in an M.B.A. program at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. She has two cats at home in New Jersey and she misses both dearly.\n\nAs I write this during a chilly February in West L.A., I envy Qianqian Zhao for the warm weather she must be having in Gainesville, Florida, with her kitty, Kimmie, who is a ripe old 15 years old! Kimmie came home with Qianqian from the shelter when she was just a few months old, and like many older cats, she sleeps a lot, but she can still jump to countertops and tabletops!\n\nThe next edition of Class Notes for ’11s will be puppies and doggies! Send me stories about your furry pals and I’ll try to include them!\n\n—Hillary S. Cheng, 10930 Gray Place, Tustin, CA 92782; (603) 546-8452; hillary.s.cheng@dartmouth.edu\n\nCongratulations! We officially have our first reunion under our belts, and what a reunion it was! Shayla Mars, our outgoing class president, reports that approximately 400 classmates registered, with 300 in the official attendance count and many more who arrived after check-in closed. The June 17-19 weekend was full of tours, events, receptions and dinners; many of the events were held at the class tent set up next to the new Life Sciences building. Check out the #backtoco11ege tag on social media for updates from your classmates.\n\nYear Five brings a changing of the guard. Your new class officers are headed up by Christine Souffrant (Dubai, United Arab Emirates), Brandon Aiono (Shanghai, China), Shelley Han (N.Y.C.) and myself, Hillary Cheng (Irvine, California). Please join us in welcoming the following officers into the fold: Chris Parker, Zach Blatt, Megan Caughey, Stephenie Lee, Tina Alexander, Neil Basu, Jessica Krug, Kelly Hopley, Joe Coleman, Tiffany Tai, Maggie Lin, Lauren Bowman, Maya Granit, Uyi Agho, Alexandra Maceda, Matthew Scott, Nadine Moezinia, Katie Paxton Christ and Susan Matthews.\n\nWe are introducing a new mini-reunion board to plan class activities between now and our next reunion in 2021: Chris Martella (Pacific Northwest), Thomas Lane and Alicia Driscoll (SoCal), Manasi Desai and Otega Ogban (Texas), Casey Gardiner and Marcella Vieraitis (Rocky Mountains), Brielle Milano and Danielle O’Bannon (N.Y.C.), Angelo Carino (Boston), Wendy Hado and Shanel Balloo (Washington, D.C.), Georgie Smyser and Molly Scott (Southeast) and Catie Burkhard and Joy Njoroge (Midwest). We’re still looking for a few other officers, so drop us a line at dartmouthclassof2011@gmail.com if this sounds like your gig!\n\nAnd now for your regularly scheduled (but highly anticipated) programming: classmate updates. Isaiah Berg is happy to announce that Shanel Balloo said yes! Congratulations on your engagement! Shanel is working in D.C. and Isaiah is stationed with the U.S. Marine Corps in Quantico, Virginia, for the next couple of years. Addie Gorlin, who is a degree candidate in the Brown University/Trinity Repertory Company’s M.F.A. program, and Chris Han, a first-year medical student at Brown University, have also just gotten engaged. Happy wedding planning!\n\nMarshall Bartlett made the news in Mississippi’s The Oxford Eagle with a feature on his family’s farm. Marshall, founder and president of Home Place Pastures in Como, Mississippi, writes, “We are a couple weeks away from opening the only U.S.D.A.-inspected meat processing facility for pork, beef and lamb in the state of Mississippi, one of very few in the entire Southeast. We also produce these animals on my family farm, which surrounds the processing facility and has been in my family since 1871. We wholesale to chefs from Memphis to New Orleans and also sell to individuals through farmers markets and an online store. We will have a retail store attached to our processing plant as soon as we are up and running.” Reach out to Marshall if you want to know more about their goals and business model!\n\nAlso, fun fact: Marshall’s appearance in this update is particularly timely for this winter issue since you have Marshall to thank for Phi Delt’s DIY hot tub during Winter Carnival 2011.\n\n—Hillary S. Cheng, 10930 Gray Place, Tustin CA 92782; (603) 546-8452; hillary.s.cheng@dartmouth.edu\n\nHowdy, ’11s. Well, this is it, my last column after five years as your secretary. It’s been a blast having an excuse to badger you about all the incredible things you’re doing. Many thanks for responding to my emails, Facebook messages and texts, and special kudos to those of you who actually sent in updates about your lives without me pestering you. Seriously, never be shy about that. I can tell you from experience that you can never have too many updates when it’s time to compile a column. Hillary Cheng is taking over as secretary for me and I’m sure she’s going to do an incredible job. Be sure to hit her up at hillary.s.cheng@gmail.com.\n\nNow, for the last time from me, let’s get to the updates.\n\nKasia Vincunas got married in May and has left her job at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. She is now off to London to get her master’s in Byzantine art at the Courtauld Institute of Art. Kasia writes, “We’d love to connect with Dartmouth alums in our new home!”\n\nMore news on the engagement front: Sydney Thomashow and Ben Gifford ’10 got engaged in May. Ben is entering his last year at Harvard Law School, Sydney is a product marketing manager at Google and they live in Cambridge, Massachusetts, with their corgi puppy Louie (which you can apparently follow on Instagram @louiecinnamon). Also, Elizabeth Howland and Adrian Doran got engaged in April. Big congrats to all!\n\nChris Silberman, who had been in D.C. and is making his way to San Francisco, first spent some time in South America. He traveled through Argentina, Uruguay, Chile and Peru, living on couches, Airbnbs and, of course, a camper van.\n\nKi Suh Jung has been a Navy officer stationed in Japan since 2013. Because of his service, he couldn’t make it to reunion, and we of course missed him there. The highlight of his service, Ki Suh writes, has been providing humanitarian assistance to the Philippines after Typhoon Haiyan hit the region. “My ship was in Hong Kong at the time for a port visit and we were ordered to leave a day early and make best speed for Ormoc,” he wrote. “We used our helicopters to deliver food to remote villages that were cut off from the city and we sent sailors to shore to clean up debris and rebuild at an Army base so that they could take charge of the situation after we left. Other Navy ships relieved us after about five days and we continued with our deployment.”\n\nAnd lastly, some news on the grad school front. Jonathan Panzl graduated from Columbia Law School in May. Andrew Citrin, who spent the last few years leading research strategy at MediaLink, a boutique advisory firm, has headed to L.A. to pursue an M.B.A. at USC. He plans to concentrate on strategy management in the media and entertainment landscape.\n\nThat’s it for now and from me. Be sure to send Hillary your updates, and thanks for taking the time to read the column after the last five years. As Miley Cyrus famously said in that song that was popular freshman year, I can’t wait to see you again. Joseph out.\n\n—Drew Joseph, 49 Grove St., Somerville, MA 02144; (510) 418-2244; aqjoseph@gmail.com\n\nHi there, ’11s. This is my second to last column as your secretary and by the time it’s published we will have already had our five-year reunion and selected our next class secretary. An early good luck to her or him! And I hope we all had as much fun and EBAs at reunion as we are talking about now (it’s late April as I write this). Now, onto the updates!\n\nAnother academic year has wrapped up, and that means lots of our classmates are headed to or are finishing grad school. That includes plenty of ’11s who recently finished med school and are now off to their residencies. Cathleen Kenary has graduated from George Washington and is headed to Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston for an anesthesiology residency. Laura Goldstein finished up at Mount Sinai and will be doing a pediatrics residency at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. Will Levine also wrapped up at Mount Sinai and has matched for an internal medicine residency at Penn. And Joyce Njoroge graduated from Case Western and will be going to Northwestern for internal medicine. She says she’s excited for Chicago, but will probably stay a Cavs fan. (As a Warriors fan, I can tell Joy she’s making a mistake on that one.)\n\nAmong those starting grad school in the fall is Alex Maceda, now in San Francisco, who is headed to Stanford Graduate School of Business.\n\nSomeone who can’t seem to get enough school is Shima Dowla, who is an M.D./Ph.D. student at the University of Alabama-Birmingham. Her Ph.D. is in nutrition and health behavior. “I’m currently designing a randomized control trial to test the effects of a low-carbohydrate diet on metabolic health-related outcomes in obese children,” Shima writes. “I also recently received a Schweitzer fellowship to conduct a living healthy program for patients with diabetes from disadvantaged households.” In her free time (how can an M.D./Ph.D. student have free time?!) Shima likes to blog about sciences.\n\nSusan Matthews (my former boss at The D!) is now the senior science editor at Slate, where she is overseeing all science and health coverage at the site. Before that, Susan was most recently senior web editor at Audubon.\n\nI think this is the first time I’ve reported this kind of update: Verjin Aprahamian has legally changed her name to adopt her stepfather’s surname and, as she says, “to finally have a phonetic name.” So she is now officially Virginia Weeks. And speaking of legal changes, V. is headed to law school in the fall, so, she writes, “Nametags will soon read, Virginia Weeks, Esq.”\n\nAnd Anne Brown writes that she has a new couch. Congrats, Anne.\n\n—Drew Joseph, 49 Grove St., Somerville, MA 02144; (510) 418-2244; aqjoseph@gmail.com\n\nHello, ’11s. It is my duty, responsibility and honor to give you one last reminder (in case you somehow didn’t know already, as if that were possible) that our reunion is coming up this summer. So make sure you block off the weekend, and see you then.\n\nNow, onto the updates. Jean Mason, who had been working in New York in digital brand strategy, is now getting her M.F.A. at the Savannah College of Art and Design, where she’s studying textile design. “It’s a great program—good mix of fine arts and industry-oriented design work,” Jean writes. She’s specializing in print and pattern design, so is doing lots of screenprinting and digital pattern design. Right now Jean is creating a line of saris.\n\nEmily Duke and Matt Scott, who you may remember once had a column in The D about being the “drunkest girls at the party,” are taking their antics to the big screen. Well, not quite the big screen, but still. They have started their own web series with the help of Emma Fidel ’12 called Garbage People. Here’s how they describe the new comedy series: “As far as the idea—Garbage People is basically ‘Drunkest Girls at the Party’ in the real world. Original idea probably came in the midst of drunken Will & Grace binge (on brand) and is highly inspired by Absolutely Fabulous (as we are in real life).” Glad to know Matt and Emily haven’t changed since college. You can catch up here: www.facebook.com/GarbagePeopleSeries/?fref=ts.\n\nAnd of course we have lots of wedding news to report. Owen Jennings and Kelly McHenry got engaged last summer in Sonoma, California, and are planning to get married in nearby Calistoga next spring. Owen and Kelly live in San Francisco, where Owen is the head of business operations at Square and Kelly manages a global sales team at Google. They spend their time enjoying the beautiful outdoors in the Bay Area, hanging out with fellow Dartmouth alumni and dreaming about the day they will finally get a dog. Leonard Chang and Stephenie Lee, another ’11-’11 couple living in the Bay Area, got married at the Audubon Zoo in New Orleans in November and, as Stephenie says, “Dartmouth alums were rolling deep!” Stephenie is working at an educational company committed to transforming the delivery of education globally called Axiom Learning. Leonard is working at a fintech firm called NerdWallet, which gives out credit card recommendations. Stephenie writes, “The Bay Area continues to be super chill and every year more and more people move out here!” Emily Hirshey also recently got engaged, to Joe Tracy ’12. Emily is in L.A., where she’s a staff writer on a new Netflix sitcom starring Ashton Kutcher called The Ranch. “And I’m really happy to see that coloring books have become more socially accepted among the grownup community,” Emily writes. But despite the wedding news and big job, it sounds like the most exciting thing in Emily’s life is that she just got a dog named Rosie. That’s it for now! Please send me any updates, and see you in June!\n\n—Drew Joseph, 49 Grove St., Somerville, MA 02144; (510) 418-2244; aqjoseph@gmail.com\n\nHey there, ’11s. First up, a reminder from one of our reunion chairs Katie Paxton (now Katie Paxton Christ) to make sure you mark the calendars for the big five-year reunion: June 17 to June 19. Already looking forward to being back in Hanover with you all then. It’s coming up soon!\n\nNow onto the updates.\n\nAthena Aicher moved to Newport, Rhode Island, in the fall to attend the International Yacht Restoration School (IYRS), a classic wooden yacht building and restoration trade school. Athena, who was working as a research assistant at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute on Cape Cod before heading to IYRS, hopes to own her own shop in a few years. And I hope to one day own a boat that Athena can restore. Now who can teach me to sail?\n\nAhmad Nazeri writes from Atlanta, where he’s doing operations management at McMaster-Carr and is working on his M.B.A. at Emory. Ahmad, who previously was doing Teach for America in Baltimore, is living with fellow ’11 Don Kephart and says he gets to see classmates James Kim and Zach Stolzenberg every so often.\n\nMayuka Kowaguchi is living in Tokyo, where she’s worked for Booz Allen Hamilton and Uber a"
