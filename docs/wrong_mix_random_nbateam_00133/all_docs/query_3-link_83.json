        "text": "It’s hard to believe Zoe Salmon was announced as a new Blue Peter presenter all the way back in 2004, at the height of the CBBC show’s heyday. With a bubbly personality, flowing hair and an enviable complexion, Zoe quickly became a favourite TV personality amongst kids and adults alike.\n\nNow, as she’s preparing to welcome her first child, the Northern Irish star looks very different with a whole new beauty look. In a couple of festive-themed posts from last month, Zoe can be seen with a mid-brunette hair shade, which is probably a lot closer in tone to her natural colour.\n\n“You look ageless and stunning,” commented one fan under the snap, while another said, “Zoe you look absolutely glowing, what an exciting year ahead.”\n\nA third voiced all of our thoughts, “Zoe you are so beautiful and you have the most beautiful long hair ever! You are such an inspiration.”\n\nZoe’s hair length seems to be one thing that hasn’t changed since her CBBC days. The 42 year old still wears her thick tresses down to her waist, with not a single split end in sight. Her Instagram grid from the past few months also shows several sleek styles with her hair nearly reaching her bum, prompting many fans to ask if she’s “growing it long enough to sit on”.\n\nThough Zoe hasn’t been a regular on our TV screens in the past few years, some fans will remember that she took part in Dancing on Ice back in 2009. She was partnered with pro Matt Evers and reached the quarter-finals, losing out on the semi-final spot to Liberty X singer Jessica Taylor.\n\nNow, Zoe and her husband Will Corrie are looking forward to giving birth to baby number one this coming spring. She recently told the Belfast Telegraph, “We are both so excited at the thought of this magical new addition to our family.\n\n“It’s a real fairytale moment for us after such a crazy year and a half and we are so pleased we can share this lovely news with our families and friends.”\n\nWe hope the baby inherits Zoe’s amazing hair genes!"
