        "text": "Chef Suzanne Goin has made a name for herself with easy yet elegant seasonal California cooking, working under fellow Golden State icons like Alice Waters and Mark Peel before opening her first restaurant, Lucques, in 1998. At A.O.C., her beloved West Hollywood wine bar, the effortlessly chic cooking is perfectly matched by a beautifully homey atmosphere, including a main dining room replete with hefty dark wooden beams and a rustic fireplace, as well as an adjacent vine-wrapped garden accented with laurel trees. For larger affairs, the garden can seat up to accommodate up to 70 seated guests, while the main dining room offers space for 120.\n\nChefs Keith Corbin and Daniel Patterson first met at LocoL, an experimental concept in Watts with Roy Choi, then cooked together at the Alta Group in the Bay Area, before opening Alta Adams. The duo has drawn diners from across the city to historic West Adams for a highly personal take on soul food, examining the connections between traditional West African dishes and California cuisine. If you’re looking to dine outdoors, the vine-covered back patio can be arranged with seating for up to 50.\n\nNamed after the James Beard-nominated chef’s daughter Birdie and grandmother Gladys, the Santa Monica staple from Jeremy Fox (of Rustic Canyon fame) channels homestyle Eastern European cooking through a California lens, producing nearly everything in house with a zero-waste approach. Located inside the historic Bergamot Station, Birdie G’s offers a variety of spaces both indoor and outdoor. “Al’s workshop” is their most secluded private dining area, offering space in the back of the restaurant for up to 45 seated guests. Larger groups of up to 80 can take over the main dining room, while a full buyout affords seating for up to 150.\n\nLaunched in collaboration with Chicago’s Boka Group, this spirited restaurant and bar on the roof of The Hoxton, Downtown is the latest Los Angeles project from Chef Stephanie Izard. The menu showcases flavorful Peruvian classics like ceviches and skewers, alongside dips, snacks, and larger share plates. The airy dining room, replete with a sweeping skyline views and a retractable roof to take in prime Southern California sunshine, can accommodate up to 80 guests for a seated dinner, while the adjacent bar and lounge, flush with greenery, offers custom arrangements for semi-private dining with smaller groups.\n\nLed by chef owner Bryant Ng with his wife Kim alongside Zoe Nathan and Josh Loeb (of Rustic Canyon fame), Cassia marries the fresh and vibrant flavors and culinary traditions of Southeast Asia with the warm and soulful hospitality of a neighborhood California brasserie. The downtown Santa Monica hotspot has won over the hearts and stomachs of Angelenos and diners further afield, including Pete Wells, who awarded Cassia the New York Times’ first three star review outside of the New York metropolitan area. The patio offers heated outdoor seating for up to 45 guests to enjoy a family style meal of Singaporean-Chinese and Vietnamese-inspired dishes, using ingredients sourced from local farms.\n\nHelmed by husband and wife duo Lance Mueller and Cobi Marsh (of Cobi’s Curries), this Bib gourmand-winning celebration of Asian street food sits in the space is housed in the space formerly occupied by Dhaba’s, an Indian dining institution in the heart of Santa Monica. The diverse menu draws on the couple’s Polynesian and Balinese heritage, as well as the recipes of the Southeast Asian diaspora they enjoyed working in Australia and the Pacific Islands. Decor pays tribute to Dhaba’s, retaining homey details like pastel pink walls and a hanging rose garden by the bar and foyer to foster a sense of intimacy. The lush garden and outdoor covered patio can be booked together, providing space for 48 seated guests.\n\nThe group behind Scopa Italian Roots and Black Market Liquor Bar has transformed the former Pacific Banana Co. building in the fashion district into a lush tropical oasis. The sprawling venue offers a variety of spaces indoor and outdoor to enjoy Chef Antonia Lofaso’s island-hopping menu inspired by the Caribbean and Latin American cooking, as well as a festive classic meets tiki cocktail program by Pablo Moix. The outdoor patio seats 83 across a combination of booths, banquettes, and tables, while a full buyout - including a dedicated cocktail hour at the three-sided bar - provides seating for 190.\n\nJust a couple blocks from the beach, this downtown indoor-outdoor Santa Monica rooftop offers refreshing if expensive cocktails and a sizable wine list alongside an all-day menu of familiar Italian dishes. It’s hardly the most memorable take on small plates, pizzas, and pastas you’ll find on the west side, but you’ll enjoy pristine ocean views and sexy Mediterranean design (all the more swoon worthy after a couple of those cocktails). With a large group, we’d spring for the private ocean room, which seats 44.\n\nSince 1983, this Fairfax District staple founded by music producer Allan Rinde has delighted Angelenos with NYC-style Chinese food, live tunes, and so-called “Foo Foo” drinks - think Szechuan margaritas with yuzu, thai basil, and green chile, and lychee martinis with coconut oil infused vodka, to name just a couple. The main dining room is awash in red and black, with paper lanterns hanging from the ceiling, plush leather booths, and marble lazy Susans for easy family-style feasting. The adjacent banquet hall accommodates 50 seated.\n\nOriginally envisioned as a commissary kitchen for Gjelina, Gjusta has evolved into a powerhouse, offering the Southern California brunch to end all brunches. The indoor-outdoor marketplace and cafe effortlessly traverses between traditional Ashkenazi appetizing (bagels, pastrami, smoked fish aplenty) and pan Mediterranean fare (falafel, tuna conserva, flatbread pizzas), with the occasional excellent diversion into east Asia (banh mi, salmon rice bowls), plus an array of seasonal pastries and desserts. The garden courtyard, replete with a wood burning pizza oven, a cluster of olive trees, and oversized terracotta planters, is an adaptable space seating up to 50 guests.\n\nAn old school steakhouse in Beverly Hills from the makers of America’s favorite seasoned salt? That’s Lawry’s the Prime Rib, a La Cienega landmark where you can enjoy the namesake dish served tableside from a gleaming silver cart, alongside mashed potatoes, Yorkshire pudding, whipped cream horseradish, and their famed spinning bowl salad. Some may deride it as dated, but to us, there’s a time and place for everything; with three private dining rooms, it’s a solid spot for a little throwback style fête. Larger groups can ball out in the Oak Room, offering seating for 80 alongside a grand fireplace and bold beamed ceiling.\n\nIf you're looking for a quintessential old-school spot, seek out the blinking neon sign advertising the “oldest in Hollywood,” and enter the doors of Musso & Frank Grill. An industry favorite since 1919, Musso & Frank’s has been serving up thick steaks paired with cold martinis to regulars and tourists alike for over a century. It’s a restaurant whose service, decor, and menu have remained reliable and pretty much unchanged since its opening. The tables are draped in crisp white linens, adorned with polished silverware and classic glassware, while a mahogany bar offering classic craft cocktails serves as the centerpiece. Two larger private rooms offer seating for up to 25, and can be combined for a party of 50.\n\nIn a city with no shortage of great omakase offerings, Nobu’s menu might not jump out as the most exciting, but for what it’s worth, this LA institution was arguably the pioneer behind what now seems like the high end sushi standard. Nobu’s Malibu location is undoubtedly one of the most breathtaking restaurants in the city, perched on a cliff overlooking the Pacific, with warm lighting and minimalist decor befitting a ryokan (which they also just to happen to have next door). It’s undoubtedly a place to see and be seen, but if you’re keen on avoiding the paparazzi they’ve got a private dining room with uninterrupted ocean views that seats up to 30 guests. Weather permitting, the partially covered patio offers seating for 50, with a fireplace providing intimacy and warmth against those ocean breezes. When booked together, the two adjacent spaces can seat 80.\n\nNative Angeleno and two Michelin-star chef Josiah Citrin has taken over the kitchen at Openaire, a greenhouse and tented garden oasis with baskets of fragrant plants and abundant sunlight on the second floor terrace of the LINE hotel. His menu celebrates California bounty and the diversity of culinary influences across Los Angeles, with an ambitious variety of dishes served all day especially impressive for a hotel restaurant. Opposite the Openaire greenhouse by the pool deck is a private outdoor gathering space that seats up to 50. A full restaurant buyout provides seating for 110.\n\nNamed for the Latin term to describe leisurely gathering, Otium is the convivial restaurant attached to the Broad Museum. Much like the dining room, a sprawling space showcasing high quality materials in understated designs, the menu by Chef Timothy Hollingsworth, formerly chef de cuisine of The French Laundry, is an exercise in elegant rusticity. It’s a place where high quality service and execution effortlessly blends with a casual and inviting atmosphere, perfect for your next group outing. The patio with a fire pit and woodfire rotisserie can be privately booked for parties of up to 65 guests.\n\nNestled within a historic church, Redbird stands as the embodiment of cool in downtown LA. The restaurant boasts an exciting menu of modern American cuisine designed for sharing, and a welcoming atmosphere suitable for almost every occasion in your life. Each of the private spaces takes on a distinctive design identity, and many feature their own private kitchens, making them the perfect setting for cooking classes, cocktail demonstrations, and exclusive experiences with Chef Neal Fraser. Be sure not to miss the creative cocktails by the renowned bar duo Julian Cox and Tobin Shea. Additionally, sommelier Ben Teig has thoughtfully curated an eclectic wine list, with a special focus on selections from Burgundy, Bordeaux, and California. The Cardinal's Quarters on the fourth floor offers private seating for up to 44 guests, while the West Room on the second floor seats up to 75, and also features an outdoor balcony. The latter can be combined with the East Room to seat 100. For al fresco dining, the garden accommodates 108 seated guests.\n\nCelebrated husband and wife chef duo Walter and Margarita Manzke have transformed the famed Mid City building that once housed La Brea Bakery and Campanile into a bastion of modern French cooking. République incorporates a casual bakery, café, and bar in the front of the space, including a soaring central nave with a glass ceiling and neo-gothic detailing, as well as a more formal dining area in the rear. Most of the spaces can be rented or combined for private events to suit your party's size and needs. The main dining room accommodates up to 68 guests seated, while a full buyout of the space offers seating for 154.\n\nWhether you’re looking for an elevated location for brunch, lunch or dinner, The Rose Venice has you covered. For 36 years, this boho-chic eatery has offered a reliable menu and a relaxed, spacious vibe, including a full market and bakery, coffee bar, and cocktail bar, alongside indoor and outdoor dining spaces. The restaurant’s unique layout allows for many different options private dining. The main dining room can be bought out in part, offering semi-private space for 80 seated, while a full buyout affords seating for 200. For outdoor parties, the full Beer Garden sits 50.\n\nFrom the get-go, chef/owner Josh Loeb of Rustic Canyon wanted to create a restaurant that kept community in mind. The dream was for the space to feel cozy without sacrificing craft. His beloved restaurant was born from this vision, offering a menu that's eclectic and comforting, showcasing the best of California’s seasonal ingredients. Nowadays, the kitchen is helmed by the talented Zarah Khan, the first female chef to lead the culinary team since its opening in 2006. The 300+ bottle wine list, curated by Kathryn Coker, celebrates smaller producers whose focus is on soil health and chemical-free processes. A full buyout (including the main dining room, sidewalk, and back patios) accommodates up to 120 guests.\n\nCrafted by the dynamic duo, Jon Shook and Vinny Dotolo, this Beverly Grove gem replete with walls of fish taxidermy and other knick knacks offers a unique blend of classic seafood and creative interpretations. Get a group together, dive into the mini buttery lobster rolls or sticky salmon collars adorned with yakitori glaze, and enjoy. Don’t let the maritime decor keep you from ordering more land-based fare like the fried chicken sandwich, which many claim to be the best in LA. A buyout of this cozy dining room offers seating for up to 50 of your nearest and dearest."
