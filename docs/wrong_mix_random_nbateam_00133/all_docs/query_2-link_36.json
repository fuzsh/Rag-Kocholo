        "text": "You should always receive an email after booking a reservation which contains your parking pass. If you do not receive an email from us within 15 minutes after booking a reservation, please contact ParkChirp support at support@parkchirp.com.\n\nYou may refund your reservation at any time prior to the reservation start time. You will receive a full refund on your original purchase amount.\n\nVisit the Purchase History page located within the Account Settings area. You will be prompted to log in to your account if you are not already logged in.\n\nYou may enter the garage any time after the start time on your reservation, and you may exit the garage any time before the end time on your reservation.\n\nIf you remain in the parking facility past your reservation time, then you will be subject to additional charge (at garage posted rates). The overstay policies are established by the operator of each parking facility. In some cases, staying past your reservation time could result in a ticket or potentially being towed by the parking facility operator.\n\nAt this time, we do not have the ability to extend reservations once you have entered the garage. However, you can stay in the garage longer and pay the posted parking rates.\n\nVisit the Change Password page located within the Account Settings area. You will be prompted to log in to your account if you are not already logged in.\n\nHourly Parkers: For most garages, in-and-out privileges are not allowed for hourly parkers. Each location will specify the in-and-out privileges in the “Things You Should Know” section.\n\nMonthly Parkers: In most cases, in-and-out privileges are allowed for customers who purchase monthly parking passes."
