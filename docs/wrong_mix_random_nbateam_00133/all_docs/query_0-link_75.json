The decisive steps we have taken and are announced today, act to further strengthen the welfare and support in place for everyone involved with this production.”\n\nThe news comes a few hours after former contestant Zara McDermott spoke for the first time about her treatment on the show. McDermott’s partner Graziano Di Prima has left the show after allegations of “gross misconduct.” He has apologized and said he “deeply regrets” the events that led to his exit.\n\nAnother popular dancer, Giovanni Pernice, has announced he is to leave the show, following allegations by a celebrity partner, actress Amanda Abbington, that she suffered PTSD after training with him. Pernice denies all reports of inappropriate behaviour, and the BBC’s investigation is continuing.\n\nStrictly Come Dancing is one of the BBC’s most popular TV shows, often topping its annual most-watched list.\n\nBest of Deadline\n\n2024-25 Awards Season Calendar - Dates For Oscars, Emmys, Grammys, Guilds & More\n\n2024 Premiere Dates For New & Returning Series On Broadcast, Cable & Streaming\n\n'UnPrisoned' Season 1 Recap: What To Remember For Season 2"
