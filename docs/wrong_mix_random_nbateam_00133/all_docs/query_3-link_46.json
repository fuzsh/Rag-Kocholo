        "text": "Former Blue Peter presenter Zoe Salmon has said she is “looking forward to embracing new projects as a working mum” after giving birth to her first child.\n\nSalmon, 42, welcomed her son Fitzwilliam with husband William Corrie on April 1.\n\nSpeaking to Hello! magazine about becoming a mother, Salmon said: “It’s amazing to join the parent’s club. Fitz is my new little favourite person in the world.”\n\nAfter taking a break from presenting work during lockdown and her pregnancy, Salmon revealed she was excited to begin working again.\n\nShe said: “I’m grateful that I took that time for myself, but I’m looking forward to embracing new projects as a working mum.”\n\nSalmon added: “It’s a new me; I’ve changed from Zoe the TV presenter to Zoe the mummy and TV presenter.\n\n“I want Fitz to grow up seeing both his mum and his dad working hard.”\n\nSalmon lives with Corrie, 36, who works for his family’s butcher’s business, in Co Down, Northern Ireland.\n\nThe couple eloped to Barbados for a surprise wedding ceremony in 2016.\n\nSalmon shared her delight that her son will grow up in the countryside, saying: “Will grew up on the farm and he always speaks so lovingly and fondly of it. I’m looking forward to Fitz getting involved in all of that too.\n\n“It’s a beautiful part of the world.”\n\nSpeaking about the possibility of expanding her family in the future, Salmon added: “It’d be lovely for Fitz to be a big brother, but we don’t want to get ahead of ourselves.”\n\nThe full interview with Zoe Salmon is available in Hello! magazine now."
