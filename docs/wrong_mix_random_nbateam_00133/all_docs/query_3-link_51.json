        "text": "Former Blue Peter presenter Zoe Salmon is preparing to welcome her first child but she might be a little difficult to recognise having switched up her look over the years.\n\nThe TV presenter, 42, is currently pregnant with her first child with husband William Corrie.\n\nMany will remember her as sporting blonde hair during her days hosting the BBC children‚Äôs programme in the mid-noughties, but Zoe has undergone a makeover in recent years and is now a brunette.\n\nIn recent weeks, the presenter has treated her Instagram followers to stunning photos of her baby bump, including snaps of the star posing beside a Christmas tree while cradling her stomach.\n\nZoe announced she was expecting a baby in October with a photo of her and husband Will on their wedding day, alongside the caption: ‚ÄòOur fairy tale continues‚Ä¶we have been carrying a little secret‚Ä¶an extra heartbeat ü§ç‚ú® We are over the moonüåô üë∂üèª Coming soon‚Ä¶ü§ç‚Äô\n\nSharing her excitement for motherhood, the TV star recently told the Belfast Telegraph: ‚ÄòWe are both so excited at the thought of this magical new addition to our family.\n\n‚ÄòIt‚Äôs a real fairytale moment for us after such a crazy year and a half and we are so pleased we can share this lovely news with our families and friends.‚Äô\n\nShe added: ‚ÄòWe see this pregnancy as a lovely gift and the timing is just perfect for us. I really couldn‚Äôt be any happier.‚Äô\n\nZoe hosted Blue Peter from 2004 to 2008 before appearing on ITV‚Äôs Dancing On Ice in 2009. She missed out on nabbing the win after reaching the quarter-finals.\n\nHer other TV appearances include a stint on Celebrity MasterChef in 2012, while she also had a cameo alongside Russell Brand in his hit 2010 movie, Get Him To The Greek.\n\nIn addition to her celebrity career, Zoe is also a trained lawyer.\n\nGot a story?\n\nIf you‚Äôve got a celebrity story, video or pictures get in touch with the Metro.co.uk entertainment team by emailing us celebtips@metro.co.uk, calling 020 3615 2145 or by visiting our Submit Stuff page ‚Äì we‚Äôd love to hear from you.\n\nMORE : Good Morning Britain guest slams conservatories as she films from her conservatory"
