        "text": "Step behind the velvet ropes to see how the stars celebrated television’s biggest night. Though not quite back to pre-pandemic levels, Hollywood hit the party circuit with a slate of events with stops at the TV Academy’s Governors Ball, Netflix, Disney, HBO and Apple TV+ after the Fox telecast.\n\nHBO + Max\n\nSome things change, others stay the same. HBO and streaming counterpart Max once again topped the competition with a field-leading 31 wins Monday night thanks to eight trophies for The Last of Us, six for Succession, five for The White Lotus and another two for Last Week Tonight With John Oliver, among others. “Everyone is holding an Emmy,” relayed one guest as he surveyed the scene inside San Vicente Bungalows, which hosted the party of the night thanks to all that glittering gold and stars like Pedro Pascal making rounds. Speaking of the Last of Us heartthrob, after dropping the mic during the Emmys by blaming Kieran Culkin for his shoulder injury, he was all smiles hanging with the best dramatic actor winner for a chunk of the night. Faux beef squashed! Pascal — who kept close to sister Lux, CAA agent Franklin Latt and publicist Nicole Caruso all night — congratulated Culkin, who was, in turn, mobbed by a stream of well wishers. In the most touching display of the night witnessed by THR, Culkin and onscreen sibling and fellow Emmy winner Sarah Snook wrapped their arms around one another for a close embrace that lasted for at least a minute or two. When they emerged, both had tears in their eyes and Snook bid the Succession team adieu and headed home.\n\nOn the other end of the emotional spectrum, Alana Haim was busting a move on the dance floor, where she was joined by The White Lotus star Beatrice Granno thanks to beats by another Haim sister, Este, who got a coveted gig providing the event’s soundtrack on the decks. Upon arrival, guests were given decorative note cards that matched the party motif and laid out the event’s 411, including a Spotify playlist of Este’s set. It also featured a map of where to find attractions like signature Tuscan schiacciata sandwiches by Florence sandwich shop All’Antico Vinaio, caviar cones by Caviar Kaspia, hand-crafted Jell-O shots by Solid Wiggles in what marked an L.A. debut for Brooklyn pastry chef Jena Derman and master mixologist Jack Schramm, “Stayin’ Gold” cocktails from mixologist Rosemarie Ruiz, and napkin illustrations from Napkin Killa. The upstairs sushi bar proved to be an intimate hot spot where, at one point, Alexander Skarsgard, Nicholas Braun and Jack McBrayer bellied up to the bar for baked crab, bluefin tuna and spicy salmon handrolls. (Kudos to creative producer and production agency Bespoke Bohéme.)\n\nCasey Bloys held court in the back bar, where Matthew Macfadyen was spotted in conversation with his “other work wife” Braun. While they were chatting, Arian Moayed casually snapped a pic of his co-stars. Over his shoulder, Hacks co-creators Jen Statsky and Lucia Aniello interrupted a conversation to introduce themselves to Puck founding partner Matthew Belloni and reveal themselves to be weekly listeners of his Ringer podcast The Town. THR also overheard The Last of Us co-creators Neil Druckmann and Craig Mazin fostering an introduction between Bella Ramsey and John Oliver, and James Marsden telling The White Lotus star Sabrina Impacciatore, “We miss you in L.A.” Another guest was longing for pre-pandemic party days. “It’s a sign of the times,” detailed the well-placed reveler as he explained that while HBO once again finished the night at No. 1, the celebration no longer is the gargantuan event it used to be. Once upon a time, HBO hosted thousands at Pacific Design Center, which last night only hosted the parking for press and working staff. “It’s intimate and exclusive and while that is great, it’s indicative of how everyone has consolidated and scaled back.” That said, there are perks to exclusivity. Stars are not besieged by selfie requests and winners can kick off their heels and have a good time. Looking at you, Ali Wong, who made the rounds in a pair of Adidas sneakers while holding the hand of Barry beau Bill Hader.\n\nNetflix\n\nThe streamer once again had a lot to celebrate after the Emmys, like a big sweep for Beef, including a historic win for star Ali Wong. She joined Emmy pals like Steven Yeun and creator Lee Sung Jin in downtown Los Angeles at Ristorante Per L’Ora, where winner Niecy Nash-Betts danced it up with co-star Evan Peters, Dave Chappelle drew a crowd, Katherine Heigl cut a rug on the dance floor and the cast of Martin made the rounds after their onstage reunion.\n\nWalt Disney Company\n\nThe studio hosted a beary good time at Otium, site of a post-show bash to celebrate nominees and winners from its roster of companies including ABC, Disney+, Disney Television Studios, FX, Disney Branded Television, Hulu, Freeform, National Geographic, Onyx Collective, Searchlight Television and Walt Disney Studios. There was plenty of gold in the building here, too, thanks to a near sweep from FX’s The Bear, which earned 10 trophies, making it the night’s top winning series overall. The comedy from Christopher Storer and exec producer Joanna Calo picked up the top comedy prize and trophies for stars Jeremy Allen White, Ayo Edebiri and Ebon Moss-Bachrach.\n\nApple TV+\n\nThe streamer celebrated the Emmys at a post-ceremony party at Hollywood hot spot Mother Wolf, which served up classic Italian favorites from chef Evan Funke. Winner Paul Walter Hauser from Black Bird worked the room (at times barefoot) while holding his new golden accessory. Jason Sudeikis and the crew from Ted Lasso may have come up empty-handed Monday night, but they didn’t appear deflated in any of the high-energy party pics toasting the show’s Emmy-winning run alongside co-creator Bill Lawrence. On the scene were Brendan Hunt, Brett Goldstein, Hannah Waddingham, Phil Dunster, Jason Segal, Harrison Ford and Calista Flockhart, Jessica Williams, Sharon Horgan, Jon Hamm, Patricia Arquette, Britt Lower, Kurt and Wyatt Russell, Stephen Colbert, George Wendt, Amber Ruffin, Weird Al Yankovic and others. The bash featured special performances by DJ Pee.Wee (Anderson .Paak), who spun an all-vinyl set joined by a live horn section, as well as DJ Kiss.\n\nEmmy Awards Governors Gala\n\nFollowing the telecast, well-heeled guests hoofed it from the Peacock Theater across the way to the Convention Center for a sprawling post-show bash. After strolling by a welcome stack of bottles of Fiji Water, guests were greeted inside by stars and food stations galore. Beef star Ali Wong made the rounds with Bill Hader, who did not win for Barry but earned raves online as boyfriend of the year after being spotted carrying Wong’s bag (with an Emmy tucked discreetly inside). The couple spent time chatting up Emmy-winning queens from RuPaul’s Drag Race. Across the way, Trevor Noah seemed content to sit quietly with his Daily Show team, surrounded by their new hardware. Not long after THR passed by Noah’s table, we bumped into Roy Wood Jr. who confirmed his onstage plea for a new host by saying, “This has gone on too long.” Moments after that, a crush of flashbulbs at the entrance signaled the arrival of winners Jeremy Allen White, Kieran Culkin and Sarah Snook. Since this event is the official post-show party of the Emmy Awards, where all the winners get their trophies engraved, we’ll make it official and offer up some more details about what went down inside: Franciacorta, Johnnie Walker Blended Scotch Whisky and Justin Vineyards & Winery provided libations; pastry chef Sherry Yard served up the desserts; Drybar offered touch-ups; and chef Rachel Haggstrom operated a Dungeness crab salad on tapioca chips, among other features.\n\nWME Awards Season Toast\n\nThe powerhouse agency took over Soho House West Hollywood on Sunday night for an intimate celebration to honor clients and collaborators during this busy time that has included such awards shows as the Golden Globes, Critics Choice Awards and Emmys. As with any post-show shindig, it’s always nice to have some winners in the building, and WME had a handful thanks to the timing directly after the CCAs. Winners like Jeremy Allen White, Ebon Moss-Bachrach, Kieran Culkin, Robert Downey Jr. and Steven Yeun made the rounds along with Brie Larson, Tina Fey, Julianne Moore, Tom Holland, Dan Levy, Ayo Edebiri, Rachel Sennott, Emma Seligman, Cami Morrone, Jason Segel, Gael García Bernal, Diego Luna, Charles Melton and Keri Russell. On the company side, Endeavor executive chairman Patrick Whitesell was in the room, as were WME scripted TV co-heads Erin Junkin and Tom Wellington, WME talent co-heads Doug Lucterhand and Andrew Dunlap, WME motion picture co-head Roger Green and Samantha Stone, chief experience officer for Soho House. But wait, there’s more: Robert Pattinson, Bob Odenkirk, Aziz Ansari, Celine Song, Matty Matheson, Simona Tabasco, Matthew Rhys, Lionel Boyce and Lee Sung Jin also toasted the season.\n\nSuccession Creator Jesse Armstrong and UTA Toast HBO Hit\n\nThe team from Succession had a lot to celebrate this weekend. Though the critically acclaimed HBO hit bid adieu last May after four seasons, it topped the small screen field with a total of 27 Emmy nominations for its final season. Creator Jesse Armstrong partnered with his reps at UTA to toast the run ahead of the Emmys with an exclusive bash at Spago in Beverly Hills on Friday night. Joining their boss were stars Brian Cox, Sarah Snook, Matthew Macfadyen, Nicholas Braun, Kieran Culkin, Justin Kirk, Justine Lupe, Zoe Winters, J. Smith-Cameron, Alan Ruck and Arian Moayed, along with scribes Tony Roche, Jon Brown, Miriam Battye and Ted Cohen. Armstrong’s UTA agents, Dan Erli and Gregory McKnight, also worked the room, as did agency boss Jeremy Zimmer. (UTA also reps Snook, Macfadyen, Braun, Kirk, Moayed, Roche, Brown, Battye, Cohen, exec producers Will Ferrell and Lucy Prebble, co-exec producer Georgia Pritchett and supervising producer Susan Soon He Stanton.) About halfway through the party — the gathering kicked off at 5 p.m. and ended three hours later with the cast huddling privately at a back table — Armstrong addressed the room by raising a glass and offering a few words. He thanked everyone for going on a long and memorable journey together. Cox, who played foul-mouthed patriarch Logan Roy, told The Hollywood Reporter that the party was a wonderful reunion. “It was really lovely to see everybody again because I haven’t seen anybody in about nine months, so it was great.”\n\nMPTF’s 17th Annual Evening Before\n\nWho doesn’t love a group photo packed with big-name actors? A slew of stars came together to say cheese and help raise north of $2.5 million in West Hollywood on Saturday night at MPTF’s 17th annual Evening Before benefit, co-chaired by Quinta Brunson and Bob Odenkirk. “We’ve had quite a year, and this organization and its fundraiser has helped many weather the storm,” said Brunson. Added Odenkirk, “MPTF really stepped up during a very challenging year to support the entertainment community, and I’m proud to be a part of a fundraiser that will help to sustain that vital support.” Evening Before, held at Pacific Design Center, was designed as a relaxed town square by Studio Komorebi with specialty food served up by Carmelized Prods., run by Jon Shook and Vinny Dotolo of Jon and Vinny’s fame. The pizza fueled the party as did beats by DJ Daisy O’Dell and lively conversations among stars of some of this year’s most nominated shows. The Succession cast made the rounds, as did the Ted Lasso crew, including Jason Sudeikis, Brett Goldstein, Brendan Hunt, Phil Dunster, Hannah Waddingham, Kola Bokinni, Billy Harris and James Lance. Stars of The White Lotus like Meghann Fahy, Theo James, Will Sharpe, F. Murray Abraham, Adam DiMarco, Beatrice Grannò and Simona Tabasco also made an appearance.

The event moved from its longtime home at the Four Seasons to The Maybourne Beverly Hills on Canon Drive and switched dates by a week, shifting from Golden Globes weekend to a date that strategically fell ahead of the Critics Choice Awards and Emmy Awards. Some things remained the same. There were plenty of tiny sandwiches and tea bags for all, and the invite list featured contenders, members and guests for an afternoon soirée in the run-up to the EE BAFTA Film Awards in London on Feb. 18. “We’re having an English tea at The Maybourne, what could be more quintessentially English?” asked BAFTA North America chair Joyce Pierpoline. However, the welcoming spirit was deflated upon arrival for hordes of guests, due to long wait times for red carpet photos. The delay led to impatient publicists and a crush of bold-faced name actors who waited for their turn, including Mark Ruffalo, Brett Goldstein, Phil Dunster and Glenn Howerton. Some, however, crossed behind the step-and-repeat to begin media interviews first while others bailed on pics altogether in favor of heading upstairs for the actual party. “It’s cramped, it’s crowded and the biggest of the biggest are waiting in line. It’s a good party, so a lot of people come out for it, so that’s to be expected,” detailed one insider, while another was more sharp-tongued. “It’s an absolute crush of people, what a clusterfuck.” Emmy winner Sam Richardson took it all in stride, telling THR that he kept busy by keeping up with NFL playoff scores on his cellphone. Presented by Delta Air Lines, Virgin Atlantic and BBC Studios Los Angeles Prods., the star-packed celebration hosted Jonathan Bailey, Fantasia Barrino, Emily Blunt, Danielle Brooks, Brunson, Cox, Willem Dafoe, Elizabeth Debicki, Leonardo DiCaprio, Colman Domingo, Phil Dunster, Emerald Fennell, Greta Gerwig, Paul Giamatti, Paul Walter Hauser, Tom Hiddleston, Cord Jefferson, Julianne Moore, Carey Mulligan, Cillian Murphy, Rosamund Pike, Bella Ramsey, Sam Richardson, Andrea Riseborough, Seth Rogen, Mark Ruffalo, Rhea Seehorn, Dominic Sessa, Smith-Cameron, Celine Song, Jeffrey Wright and dozens of others.\n\nTV Academy Performer Nominee Celebration\n\nThere was a frenzy of activity around L.A. Live on Saturday afternoon amid prep work for Monday night’s Emmys (including star-studded rehearsals) and the general hustle and bustle of downtown Los Angeles. Tucked away in a much more quiet corner of the JW Marriott, well-heeled guests headed inside the platinum ballroom for the TV Academy’s annual performers’ nominee celebration. The bash serves as a way to honor “the outstanding creative achievements of top performers.” Among those who dropped by were Joseph Lee, Kathryn Hahn, Luke Kirby, Marin Hinkle, Macfadyen, Michael Learned, Braun, Tom Wright, Tyler James Williams and Dominque Fishback. Support came from Drybar, Fiji Water, Franciacorta, Johnnie Walker Blended Scotch Whiskey, Justin Vineyards, People, The Ritz-Carlton and United Airlines. In addition to the clinking of glasses and requisite chatter, the party featured an adjacent suite that hosted the official Emmys Giving Suite produced by Backstage Creations. The suite, which supported the Television Academy Foundation, featured brands like Ricardo Beverly Hills, Yaamava’ Resort & Casino, Moritek Beauty, Purdori Skincare, SpiritHoods faux fur coats and trips to Lush Africa Safaris, Museum Hotel in Turkey and Villa Caprichosa in Panama. THR spotted Oscar winner Angela Bassett making the rounds inside.\n\nAMC Better Call Saul Brunch\n\nIt’s the end of the road for AMC’s critically acclaimed hit Better Call Saul. But first … brunch! The network hosted the gang, including Vince Gilligan, Peter Gould, Bob Odenkirk, Rhea Seehorn and the rest of the cast, along with press and industry insiders for a brunch event at Lavo in West Hollywood. The day offered a chance for the team to reunite after the show bid adieu following six seasons, and before Monday’s Emmy Awards, where the show was nominated for seven awards. One special guest is said to have caused a stir at the brunch — guest star Carol Burnett — so much so that even acting peers like Betsy Brandt had superfan moments.\n\nAriana DeBose + Eva Longoria\n\nThe Oscar winner hosted a breezy beautiful brunch at Mandarin Oriental Residences Beverly Hills in celebration of her director pal on the heels of the success of Longoria’s Hulu film Flamin’ Hot as well as her recently launched tequila line Casa Del Sol. Bold-faced name guests who roamed the Enzo Enea-designed rooftop lounge included Jessica Alba, Marc Cherry, Julianne Hough, Diane Warren, Wilmer Valderrama, Kelly Sawyer Patricoff, Carlos Eric Lopez, Phillip Picardi, Jeannie Mai, Amaury Nolasco, Ken Paves, Judy Reyes, Lisa Vidal and Gloria Calderón Kellett.\n\nCanada’s House Hosts Canadian Emmy Nominees\n\nThe Consul General of Canada in Los Angeles, Zaib Shaikh, teamed with Canada’s U.S. ambassador, Kirsten Hillman, and Canada Media Fund CEO Valerie Creighton to host Emmy nominees from up north. The private reception was co-hosted by the Canada Media Fund. The agenda included presenting keys to the consulate to honorees, including the late Robbie Robertson and Kirk Pickersgill, founder of fashion label Greta Constantine. Emmy nominees and talent from nominated shows in attendance included Lamar Johnson (The Last of Us), Kirby (The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel), Susan Coyne (Daisy Jones & The Six), Paul Healy (The Last of Us), Adam Haisinger (The Amazing Race), Sophie Nélisse (Yellowjackets) and Adam DiMarco (The White Lotus)."
