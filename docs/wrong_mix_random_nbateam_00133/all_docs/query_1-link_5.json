        "text": "Rag ’N’ Bone Man is reportedly planning to marry his girlfriend this summer.\n\nThe 39-year-old ‘Human’ singer, born Rory Charles Graham, told in October how he proposed to his partner Zoe Beardsall during an airplane trip, and the pair are now apparently “counting the days until they wed”.\n\nA source told The Sun about how the Brit award-winner asked for Zoe’s hand nine months ago: “Rory and Zoe have been planning their wedding ever since he proposed in September.\n\n“He has got a really busy summer with festivals but there is some time in August which has been set aside for their special day.\n\n“Rory is really down to earth and he and Zoe love their quiet life out of the spotlight.\n\n“But the wedding won’t be low-key, as they’re having all their friends and family involved for a massive celebration, with a huge party afterwards.\n\n“Rory is the happiest he has been in years and has now really found his -soulmate in Zoe.”\n\nInsiders also told The Sun the couple will tie the knot in Sussex, close to their home, then “celebrate with a massive boozy party”.\n\nThe pair’s guest list is expected to be star-studded as their famous friends include DJ Calvin Harris, 40, and 44-year-old singer Pink.\n\nIt was revealed in January 2021 Rory had fallen for aspiring actress Zoe after his split from his wife Beth Rouy in 2019.\n\nThe singer told in October how he had proposed to his girlfriend at 30,000 ft on a plane trip to Nashville.\n\nHe said during a joint chat with Zoe at Shocktober Fest in Sussex: “We got engaged on the plane, on the way to Nashville.”\n\nZoe added: “He was going to do it when we got there but his anxiety was getting the better of him and he didn’t want to ruin the holiday.\n\n“He was p****** about with the divider between our seats and he put it down and was just sitting there with a box.”"
