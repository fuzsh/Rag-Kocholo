        "text": "It seems Shanna Moakler is taking the high road. After recently throwing some shade at ex-husband Travis Barker’s new girlfriend, Kourtney Kardashian, Moakler, 45, reportedly told a paparazzo outside LAX that she is \"happy\" for the pair.\n\n\"He’s my friend and co-parent, and I want him to be happy, and if being with her makes him happy, and she’s happy, I’m happy for both of them, honestly,\" she said.\n\nDespite the warm sentiment, she couldn’t help but get in one more dig at the couple. \"He can handle that Kardashian drama.\"\n\nMoakler married the tattooed Blink-182 rocker in 2004 and divorced in 2008. They first split in 2006, but tried to rekindle their relationship after he was injured in a horrific plane crash that took the lives of four people in 2008. The couple finally separated for good. They share children Landon Asher Barker, 17, and Alabama Luella Barker, 15.\n\nThe news did not come out of left field, as the couple has known one another for many years. The musician met Kim Kardashian in Amsterdam when he was seeing Paris Hilton, and he and Kourtney now conveniently live in the same Calabasas neighborhood.\n\nAn insider previously told OK! that \"Travis has been in the Kardashians’ inner circle for many years now, and he’s always had a soft spot for Kourtney – and vice versa.\"\n\nNEW MAN! KOURTNEY KARDASHIAN AND TRAVIS BARKER HAVE 'BEEN DATING FOR ABOUT A MONTH OR TWO'\n\nDespite their known ties, Barker recently had heads turning at the onset of his relationship with Kardashian, which clearly got under Moakler’s skin. According to a screenshot by E! News, an Instagram follower left a comment under a picture of Moakler, which was soon liked by the stunning model-actress."
