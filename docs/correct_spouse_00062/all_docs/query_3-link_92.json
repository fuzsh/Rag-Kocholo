        "text": "Not much is known about Travis and Melissa's relationship, other than the fact that they got married in September 2001 and divorced a year later.\n\nTravis and Shanna, a model, wed in October 2004, but after experiencing a fair share of ups and downs throughout the course of their marriage, the Blink-182 drummer filed for divorce in August 2006. Despite the filing, the couple still tried to make things work, but they eventually split for good in 2008.\n\nTravis and Shanna have two kids together, 15-year-old daughter Alabama and 17-year-old son Landon, and Travis is also a stepdad to Shanna's 21-year-old daughter, Atiana, whom she shares with Oscar De La Hoya. \"Travis and Shanna are in a very good place coparenting their children,\" a source told Us Weekly in February 2021.\n\nFollowing his split from Shanna, Travis briefly dated Paris in 2006, though nothing serious ever came out of their relationship. Travis later told Us Weekly that he had actually been eyeing Kim Kardashian, Paris's assistant at the time, while they were together. \"How could you not stare at Kim? Mind you, I enjoyed hanging out with Paris, but I love curvy girls,\" Travis admitted. \"Kim was eye candy. I was no way disrespectful to Paris, but I couldn't keep my eyes off Kim!\"\n\nTravis dated the model in the spring of 2015 after they reportedly met at one of his shows. According to People, things weren't exactly serious, but they were \"crazy about each other\" and had \"tons of fun.\"\n\nTravis began dating Rita in the fall of 2015. In an interview with People, Travis said their relationship came \"out of nowhere\" after they met at a charity basketball game. \"My kids are there, I'm seeing people I haven't seen in a long time, and my buddy goes, 'Hey, Travis, take a picture with Rita!'\" Travis recalled. \"And I look over, and there she is. We'd never met, and she's just, she's stunning. She's a sweetheart.\"\n\nTravis added: \"I mean, she's awesome. She's one of those great things that happen that you're like: 'Whoa, wasn't expecting that.' And I just never second-guess it. Just enjoy it.\" Sadly, their relationship was short-lived, as they split in October 2015.\n\nTravis is currently romancing the Keeping Up With the Kardashians star. The two had been friends for years, but their relationship turned romantic at the end of 2020. Now, they are getting ready to exchange \"I dos\" after Travis proposed to Kourtney on the beach in Montecito, CA, on Oct. 17."
