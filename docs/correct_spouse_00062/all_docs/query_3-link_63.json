        "text": "Kourtney Kardashian, the 44-year-old reality television star and fashion entrepreneur, and her husband, 47-year-old Blink-182 drummer Travis Barker, will soon be parents. Kardashian made the announcement at a Blink-182 show at BMO Stadium in Los Angeles on Friday night, by holding a sign that read “TRAVIS I’M PREGNANT,” which was then put up on the arena’s video screens.\n\nWith cheering from his bandmates, the heavily tattooed Barker, wearing no shirt and a wool cap, came out from behind the drum kit to give his bride a smooch. As is the Kardashian way, all of this was captured on Instagram.\n\nV.F. has reached out to representatives for both Kardashian and Barker, but did not hear back.\n\nOn her Instagram Stories, following some ads for Matcha tea, Kardashian shared another angle of the announcement video. According to People, it was shot by her longtime friend Simon Huck. Another video on her Stories tipped the couple’s hand a bit for the evening's inspiration.\n\nTrue heads know that the “TRAVIS I’M PREGNANT” sign is a reference to classic Blink-182 lore. We’ve embedded the group’s 1999 video for the tune “All The Small Things” below. Should you hit play, two things will happen. One, you will say “Oh, I know this song!” After a parade of goofy, self-effacing imagery, you’ll see one of the band’s fans holding a sign very similar to Kourtney’s at 2:29 mark. (The one in the video is yellow, though.)\n\nCurrent reports are a little unclear about precisely when Kourtney pulled this gag, but according to Setlist.fm the group did play their power-pop anthem as a penultimate number. If the mother-to-be decided to do it at the appropriate time, she had to wait the whole night before she could do her thing. Probably a little nerve-wracking!\n\nKourtney Kardashian and Travis Barker were married a little over a year ago in a 16th-century castle in Portofino, Italy. (They previously had an exchange of vows in Las Vegas, then a legal ceremony at a Santa Barbara courthouse.) Kardashian and her former partner Scott Disick have three children. Barker has two children with his ex-wife Shanna Moakler, and he also helped raise Moakler’s first child, the daughter of her ex-fiancé, boxer Oscar De La Hoya.\n\nIn October last year, the couple purchased a $14.5 million beach house in Santa Barbara from Conan O’Brien. The couple, however, maintain their own households close to one another in Los Angeles. In April, an aggressive fan crashed her automobile into the gate outside Barker’s house in an attempt to speak with him."
