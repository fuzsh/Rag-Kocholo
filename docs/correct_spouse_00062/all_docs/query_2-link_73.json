        "text": "Shanna Moakler has laid heavy accusations against her former spouse, Travis Barker.\n\nThe actress claimed that she found damaging emails about her person on the Blink-182 drummer's computer shortly after he survived a near-fatal plane crash in 2008.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nShanna Moakler Has Accused Travis Barker Of Being An Online Troll\n\nMoakler appears to be contemplating her reconciliation with Barker during his recovery after the crash. She opened up on the subject when she joined Bunnie XO on her Dumb Blonde\" podcast. A teaser of her appearance was shared on social, containing a text overlay that read:\n\n\"Shanna breaks down in tears talking about what finally broke her heart with Travis.\"\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\n\"I've never shared this with anyone before, so it's kind of crazy. I got his computer. And we were doing it so the kids could FaceTime him, because mind you, the kids hadn't seen their dad now for almost a month and a half,\" she began.\n\nAfter disclosing that the heavily-reported occurrence caused Travis pain which she found \"f——g horrifying,\" Moakler touched on the emails she claims to have discovered on her ex's computer, which ultimately resulted in their separation. In her words:\n\n\"When I was setting up his computer and he FaceTimed with the kids, he was getting a blood transfusion, and I looked in his email, and I saw all of the emails from all of the women.\"\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nShe declared that she was not as bothered by the \"other women\" as she was about \"when he went to TMZ and he wrote a comment.\" Moakler continued in the teaser:\n\n\"You write a comment and then [TMZ] will email you a link, and you have to click on the link to approve the comment. And I saw all of these comments in his email that he was posting about me on TMZ, about what a s—— mother I was [and] what a s—— person I was.\"\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nShe expressed her disbelief that Barker was the one \"behind these comments,\" adding that the betrayal led her to go cry in her \"mother's arms for hours.\" The post, uploaded via TikTok, unsurprisingly caught the attention of many, and they wasted no time in airing their thoughts in the comments section.\n\n\"Travis love bombs the fk out of his partner. He treats them all the same. All of you talking about meet the barkers should know how he is with Kourtney he was like with Shanna,\" one viewer asserted, while another declared, \"Travis Barker has always given me the ick!\"\n\nA third person agreeably commented, \"I just don't feel like Barker is a good person. Gives me massive ick.\"\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nCritics of Moakler also stepped into the discussion, and one of them penned, \"My soul cringes at this woman. Something isn't right,\" and a second added, \"Y'all didn't watch Meet the Barkers. She's mean, petty, laid in bed most of the time and not a good mom. There's a reason Alabama is estranged.\"\n\nMoakler Spilled The Beans On Her Broken Marriage Years After The Crash\n\nOn September 19, 2008, Barker was onboard a plane destined for Los Angeles when it crashed. The private Learjet had departed from Columbia, South Carolina, but unfortunately, it never reached its destination.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nThe plane's tires blew out during takeoff due to a loss of pressure. As a result, the plane veered off the end of the runway, crashed into a fence, and subsequently burst into flames after aborting takeoff. Three of the renowned drummer's closest friends lost their lives in the tragic accident, and he suffered burns covering 65 percent of his body.\n\nThe 48-year-old avoided flying for 13 years following his harrowing 2008 accident. However, in 2021, he posted a photo of himself and his now-wife, Kourtney Kardashian, standing in front of a plane, captioned, \"With you, anything is possible.\"\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nMoakler responded to a fan's comment, disclosing the woman responsible for the collapse of her and Barker's union. The drama began after the first runner-up at Miss USA 1995 posted a close-up snapshot of herself in a leopard one-piece.\n\nThe ensemble showcased a deep v-neckline and a significant midriff cutout that emphasized the beauty queen's cleavage and well-toned belly. The post earned thousands of likes and comments from her adoring supporters. However, one netizen shifted the focus to Moakler's romantic decisions, writing:\n\n\"You should've stayed with Travis; you'd have a lot more $$$ and living in a big home.\" In response, Moakler stated, \"and imagine I walked away from that for happiness.\"\n\nMoakler's reply did nothing to wade off the commenter as they asked, \"he didn't make you happy? He seems like the type that does everything for his wife and kids.\" She then clarified, \"I left because of Kim.\""
