        "text": "It’s a new chapter.\n\nShanna Moakler appears to have had a change of heart about her ex-husband Travis Barker’s relationship with Kourtney Kardashian.\n\nThe former Miss USA contestant, 48, shared via an Instagram comment Saturday that she is “excited” that the Blink-182 drummer, 47, and “Kardashians” star, 44, are expecting a child of their own.\n\nWhen a fan asked, “Thoughts on the new baby?,” she responded, “Very excited for them, hope they have a great experience bringing in a new life to the world.”\n\nKardashian announced she is having a baby at Blink-182’s concert in Los Angeles Friday.\n\nThe Poosh founder held up a sign that read, “Travis I’m pregnant,” which was a tribute to the 1999 music video for “All the Small Things.”\n\nMoakler is one of many to be happy for the couple’s new bundle of joy, but it certainly one of the most unexpected sources.\n\nThe former model — who shares son Landon, 19, and daughter Alabama, 17, with Barker — just two months ago was throwing shade at her ex’s marriage with Kardashian.\n\n“I just think the whole thing is so f—king weird,” Moakler said on the “Miss Understood With Rachel Uchitel” podcast in April.\n\n“I really don’t have anything positive to say about it. It’s not because I’m bitter, and I’m definitely not jealous.”\n\nThe beauty queen, who was married to Barker from 2004 to 2008, then added, “I wish them nothing but the best, and as long as they’re good to my kids, that’s all I care about. But I think the whole thing is really weird.”\n\nThat same month, Moakler accused Kardashian of spending more time with her children than the reality star’s own three kids, whom the latter shares with ex Scott Disick.\n\n“She post more of my kids then [sic] her own lol,” the “Meet the Barkers” alum previously told a fan on Instagram.\n\nWhile Kardashian did not directly respond to the diss, she slammed the onslaught of “criticism and hate and negativity” shortly after.\n\n“let’s do better if not for the world, for yourself, for your children, for your friends and family,” the Lemme CEO wrote on her Instagram Story at the time.\n\nFor more Page Six reality TV updates…\n\nListen to our “Virtual Reali-Tea” podcast\n\nShop our exclusive merch\n\n“I know the positive far outweighs the negative but it’s still hard not to be aware of it and it feels like every little action is criticized. Imagine the good we could do with that energy.”\n\nMeanwhile, Moakler’s kids appear to have a strong bond with both their dad and Kardashian.\n\nAlabama reposted her stepmom’s pregnancy announcement on social media Saturday.\n\nThe teen happily captioned it, “Baby #7.”"
