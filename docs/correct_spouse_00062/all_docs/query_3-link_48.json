        "text": "Co-parenting when your ex marries into one of the most watched families on earth can be hard – as Travis Barker’s ex Shanna Moakler knows too well.\n\nTravis, 47, has become a regular feature on reality show The Kardashians – even more so now he has a baby on the way with wife Kourtney Kardashian Barker, 44.\n\nHis ex-wife Shanna recently admitted she wasn’t the biggest fan of the famous family due to ‘personal reasons’ and no longer recognises Travis.\n\nAlthough the 48-year-old didn’t go into detail as to why this is, she did add if they are ‘good’ to her children that is what matters most.\n\nShanna shares two children with the Blink-182 drummer; Landon, 19, and Alabama, 17.\n\nTravis also continues to act as stepfather to Shanna’s 24-year-old daughter from a previous relationship, Atiana De La Hoya.\n\n‘I have my own personal reasons for not liking the Kardashians, which I won’t get into,’ she told the New York Post’s Page Six column.\n\n‘But as long as he’s happy [and] as long as they are good to my kids, that’s all I care about.’\n\nThe model is no stranger to reality TV as she and Travis had their own show, Meet The Barkers, which ran for two seasons in 2005 and 2006.\n\nTravis and Shanna were married for four years but split in 2008, although they had a rumoured rekindling of their romance in 2009.\n\nDespite their long history, the former Miss USA went on to suggest that loved-up Travis is not the same man now that she was with.\n\nShe explained: ‘I haven’t been with him for well over a decade, but you know what — he’s not mine.\n\n‘He’s not the person that I was with anymore. He’s a completely different human being, so I don’t even really know him as a man right now.\n\n‘I don’t even know if we would be compatible or even good for one another anymore because he’s not the person that he was on Meet The Barkers.’\n\nWhile she may not be a big fan of the Kardashian clan, Shanna is reportedly ‘really happy’ for the couple who are expecting their first child together.\n\nKourtney and Travis documented their IVF journey on the reality show but had said they were no longer undergoing treatment before the surprise Blink-182-inspired announcement.\n\nShe revealed she would ‘love’ to have another child, joining her brood which she shares with ex-partner Scott Disick; Reign, eight, Penelope, 11, and Mason, 13.\n\n‘We are officially done with IVF. We would love a baby more than anything, but I really believe in what God has in store for us,’ Kourtney said on The Kardashians.\n\n‘If that’s a baby, I believe it will happen.’\n\nA source told Us Weekly: ‘Shanna is really happy for Travis and Kourtney. And she knows they’ll make amazing parents to their child.’\n\nAfter over a decade separated, the model is apparently ‘living her best life’ according to the insider.\n\n‘Shanna is too busy living her best life and doesn’t have the time or energy for any negativity in her life,’ they said.\n\nShanna previously reacted to the news on Twitter, revealing that she’d been aware of Kourtney’s pregnancy for some time.\n\nAsked for her thoughts about the announcement, she wrote: ‘Very excited for them, hope they have a great experience bringing in a new life to the world.\n\n‘I’ve known for weeks. This is not new news to me.’\n\nGot a story?\n\nIf you’ve got a celebrity story, video or pictures get in touch with the Metro.co.uk entertainment team by emailing us celebtips@metro.co.uk, calling 020 3615 2145 or by visiting our Submit Stuff page – we’d love to hear from you.\n\nMORE : Travis Barker wins Threads with tear-jerking message and Kourtney Kardashian must be in bits"
