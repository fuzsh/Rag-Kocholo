Shanna claims she saw something that turned her world upside down -- this while setting up a video call on the drummer's computer as he underwent a blood transfusion at a burns unit after his 2008 plane crash.\n\nShe says she not only saw emails from loads of women ... but saw he was trashing her online and leaving nasty comments about what a shitty and terrible mother she was.\n\nWaiting for your permission to load TikTok Post.\n\nShanna immediately left the hospital and cried in her mother's arms for hours ... unable to wrap her head around her then-husband trolling her. It's not exactly clear how she pieced together Travis' alleged bashing -- but in any case, she seems certain it was him.\n\nNow, Shanna also slams the Kardashians in the podcast -- though it's nothing new as she's frequently made her distaste for Travis' new wife, Kourtney, loud and clear.\n\nIn her latest rant, she doubles down on disliking the family ... insisting she's not in the minority 'cause there are loads of people 'who don't watch the show and don't give a f*** what Kim's doing with her a**.\" Nothing new there, Shanna stays hatin' on them.\n\nProbably annoyingly for Shanna, Kourt made big news back in November ... welcoming her first child with Travis -- a baby boy named Rocky. TB himself seems happy, and has more than clearly moved on ... whereas Shanna looks to be holding on to the past for dear life."
