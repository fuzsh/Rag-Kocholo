        "text": "Hahaha I know what you mean! When I first started watching that show it was like watching a train wreck. Her ignoring her daughter, sleeping all day and over whiny use of the endearment ''papa'' made me cringe. Not that he didn''t eithier........smoking pot before your wedding planning dinner?? Come on.....BUT it always seemed to me that as flawed as they were they had a really great love for each other that wasn''t hollywood or fake. Travis''s whole voice changes when he talks to her and his children and the romantic gestures he does for her!! Gah!! You can see she truly loves and adores him. I was surprised to hear in the new season they go to marriage counseling because they were thinking of breaking up! I imagine being pregnant while caring for other little ones and your husband being away for long periods of time can be stressful for the marriage.\n\nOMG!!! I thought I was the only PSer to watch this show. My daughter and I crack on these people all the time. Travis, while some may think he looks strange, is actually the stable one of the two, it seems. This lazy heifer slept through Christmas morning and made the whole family wait for her to wake up!!! And poor Atiana!!!The only time she gets attention is when she''s in trouble.(We''ll be reading about her in the tabloids in a few years) I too love getting looks at her wedding set. Isn''t it funny that these people are so ''out there'' with the rest of their lives but keep their wedding so guarded. Maybe they made a deal w/someone and gave them exclusive rights to it. Maybe like a VH1 or InStyle Wedding special.\n\nDate: 1/12/2006 7:13:57 PM\n\nAuthor: moon river\n\nOMG!!! I thought I was the only PSer to watch this show.

Maybe like a VH1 or InStyle Wedding special.\n\nI thought I was the only one who noticed that Atiana gets totally ignored! Also has anybody noticed that Atiana dad, Oscar De La Hoya is not on the scene at all? It''s as if the little girl doesnâ€™t'' exist. It''s all about Travis, Shanna, and their baby son.\n\nAs of December 29, 2005 they had their second child.\n\nhttp://www.soundgenerator.com/news/index.cfm?articleid=6722\n\nBack in 2000 Shanna filed a suit against Oscar De La Hoya:\n\nhttp://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=105&STORY=/www/story/12-20-2000/0001391447\n\nDate: 1/13/2006 5:10:14 PM\n\nAuthor: bling*diva*\n\n~~Okay, I know I''m really late, but they really do ignore little Atianna. I saw Travis interacting with her maybe two or three times last season. I hope it gets better!!!\n\nI''ve actually seen Travis pay more attention to her than her mother does. She will be pushed aside even more with the birth of Alabama. I heard them say the nanny is quitting in this coming season. That should be interesting!! I remember Shanna complaining about being up every couple of hours and how hard it was...then realized she was talking about the dog!!! I do feel bad for what she went through w/Oscar. I had no idea. She needs to appreciate Travis more since she''s been down a rocky road before. He really seems to be the more balanced of the two, with the exeption of the pot smoking-I missed that one.\n\nI''m so glad everyone else noticed the poor little girl getting ignored! Travis will just walk in the house and say hi to her and then go crazy when he see''s his \"birth\" son. Feel so bad for her. They''re naming they''re new child Alabama? I thought they were having a girl? That''s the name they chose? I won''t touch that one.....\n\nThat ring does look massive and beautiful though! Definatley pave because I heard him say it to a friend or something last season. Can''t find a pic of it!!!\n\nThey do seem so much in love but this article from the NY DailyPost begs to differ:\n\nSHRINK-WRAPPED REALITY: Apparently the hot lights of reality TV are taking their toll on Blink-182 drummer Travis Barker and his wife, former Miss USA Shanna Moakler. Their MTV show, \"Meet the Barkers,\" the punk cousin of Nick Lachey and Jessica Simpson''s \"Newlyweds,\" is filming the second season, to air in the fall. A Lowdown spy close to the production reports: \"They were talking about splitting, but wanted to try for the kids, so the whole next season is about them in therapy.\""
