Barker then fought back with a post of his own on his own page saying that he took care of the kids while she slept in, and that she often was out late partying. \"I was informed by our realtor [sic] that Shanna was doing Dancing wit [sic] the Stars? Why wouldn't she tell me, right?\" he wrote. \"A MySpace account? Where she posts pix of our kids and her and I half naked??????? Weird [sic]???\" Barker wrote. He also said he got suspicious of his wife when he found condoms in their home because the two did not use condoms. But it didn't end there. Moakler retorted back via her publicist. \"I have been 100 percent faithful in my marriage and a devoted mother, two facts of which Travis is well aware. I still happen to be very much in love with Travis, and his using the media to take low blows at me isn't just embarrassing, it's hurtful,\" she said. She also claimed the entry was not written by Barker, and said she was afraid for her safety. Soon after that, Barker removed his statement from his MySpace Page. Looks like the reality show for these two stars hasn't ended yet.\n\neitmonline.com\n\nBarker: I Still Love Shanna\n\nTravis Barker isn't keeping quiet about the reasons he's divorcing his wife and Meet the Barkers costar Shanna Moakler.\n\nOn Aug. 14 – a week after he filed for divorce – Barker, 30, posted a scathing message on his MySpace.com page accusing Moakler, 31, of partying hard, not spending enough time with their kids (Landon, 2, and Alabama, 7 months) and sleeping too much.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with PEOPLE, Barker explains, \"I was hearing things in the press that Shanna was saying about me and it got to the point where it got so foul and so false that I wanted my fans to hear from me directly.\"\n\nMoakler fired back to PEOPLE, \"(His) airing of our dirty laundry in the media is not conducive to the well-being of my children, and I want no part of it.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, Barker talked to PEOPLE about what went wrong in his marriage, a certain egg-throwing problem and the MTV curse.\n\nPEOPLE: How are you doing? Are you angry or sad?\n\nBARKER: I'm not in the angry phase at all because I'm still absolutely in love with Shan. It feels weird to not wake up to my children every day, to be honest. But I sneak over every morning to see the babies.\n\nPEOPLE: Do they understand what's going on?\n\nBARKER: Well, 'Bam is seven months old. She just pisses herself when she sees me because she's so excited because she was used to seeing me so much during the day. And my son just thinks I'm working like crazy right now.\n\nPEOPLE: When did things start going downhill with you and Shanna?\n\nBARKER: About a year ago. I don't know if it was me touring and me constantly getting accused of things. She was unfortunately in a relationship before where someone was unfaithful to her and she told me when we first met that it scared her. I understood that going into it, but I didn't know it would be to the extreme that it was. To the point where I couldn't have friends that were girls and I couldn't hang out with my guy friends. They would get egged if they came to my house.\n\nPEOPLE: Wait, is that a metaphor?\n\nBARKER: There were times where I'd be accused of whatever. She'd say I was a bad father, just saying she hated me or whatever. Then I would leave the house because I couldn't take it. My manager would pick me up and he would get served with a dozen eggs. This would happen on the daily. This would happen on the weekly.\n\n(Through her rep, Moakler responds: \"I did egg his manager's car on one occasion and at the time it was well deserved and well worth it.\")\n\npeople.com"
