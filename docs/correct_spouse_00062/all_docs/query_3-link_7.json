        "text": "Credit: Cindy Ord/MG22/Getty Images for The Met Museum/Vogue\n\nFrom Friends to More! Kourtney Kardashian and Travis Barker’s Relationship Timeline\n\nWhile Kourtney Kardashian and Travis Barker’s relationship came as a surprise to many, the pair knew each other for years before their whirlwind romance. After Barker spent time with Kardashian at her mom Kris Jenner’s Palm Springs, California, home in January 2021, Us Weekly confirmed that the pair were dating. “Kourtney and Travis are officially a couple,” the insider told Us. “They have been close friends for years and have been dating for a couple months. Travis is very smitten with Kourtney and has been for a while.” Kardashian and Barker’s bond goes way back. The duo, who lived in the same Calabasas, California, gated community, had been spotted out together on numerous occasions including in 2018 when they grabbed dinner and attended an evening church service. The musician made appearances on her family’s first show, Keeping Up With the Kardashians, alongside his ex-wife Shanna Moakler. The couple blended families when they tied the knot in 2022. Kardashian shares children Mason, Penelope and Reign with ex Scott Disick, from whom she split in 2015 after nine years of dating off and on. Barker was married to Moakler from 2004 to 2008. The exes share daughter Alabama and son Landon.

I want to go to Italy with you. I want to go to Cabo with you. I want to go to Paris with you. I want to go to Bora Bora with you,’” he said at the time. “And I said, ‘Well, when the day comes you want to fly, I’m telling you I’ll do it with you. I would do anything with you. And just give me 24 hours’ notice.’ And that’s what she did.”\n\nHe added, “It’s still something very new to me, but having something that gives me the strength and hope to be able to overcome things that were so traumatic in my life, it just says a ton. She’s definitely that for me. I’m invincible when I’m with her.
