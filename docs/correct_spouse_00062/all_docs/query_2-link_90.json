        "text": "Shanna Moakler is the wife of Blink 182 drummer, Travis Barker, and star of MTV’s reality show “Meet The Barkers.” The blond bombshell is a former Miss USA (1995) and a working actress (TV’s Pacific Blue and feature films such as The Wedding Singer and Love Stinks). Moakler has been modeling since the age of fifteen and has appeared in many fashion publications. Listen in as she charms Animal Fair …\n\nAF : Tell us about your two cats!\n\nSM: Mufasa and Sergio are both Pixie Bobs, a relatively new breed. They don’t have tails, and they have what you call paddy paws extra toes. It’s really cute. Mufasa is almost one. He’s still a baby. Sergio is one and a half years old and he’s beautiful. They both get along well, they are good friends. I’m a cat person, 100%.\n\nAF: Do they have any quirky personality traits?\n\nSM: Sergio is a little anti-social. He is really shy and lives\n\nin my closet. Mufasa is more outgoing and gets into everything. He uses his paws and grabs things. He can open doors. He is obsessed with my makeup sponges. I have them in glass jars and he actually takes the top off and grabs them. We’ll find the tissue box on his head. He’ll just use his paws like crazy. Pixie Bobs are also nocturnal. They are on fire at one in the morning, just bouncing off the walls.The two of them together are like horses running through my bedroom.\n\nAF: Most people know your hubby, Travis, as Blink 182’s drummer. What breed of dog is he?\n\nSM: He loves pit bulls, but I’m going to say he’s a Rottweiler. Even though they are big and tough, they are so loving inside. Travis is a gentle giant.\n\nAF: Tell us about your MTV hit, Meet The Barkers.\n\nSM: We just finished filming the second season. It’s a combination of The Osbornes and Newlyweds. Travis and I are both young, we are parents, we are focused on our careers. Travis is very romantic and I think women enjoy watching that side of him.We have three kids. It’s a happy balance. Our kids adore the cats. My son’s first word was: “meow, meow!”\n\nAF: You were a former Miss USA. Did that help launch your career?\n\nSM: I’m from Rhode Island and I always wanted to be an actress. There wasn’t this booming industry there, so I got into pageants to get noticed. It got me to LA and opened some doors for me, which was good.\n\nAF: What’s on your plate for the future?\n\nSM: I just shot an episode of CSI: Las Vegas. Travis was in it too. It’s really cool. You’ll have to look for it. I love acting. That is my passion.\n\nAF: Best piece of acting advice?\n\nSM: Always look at children. Children don’t have those insecurities yet. They are so unaware, so in the moment, so themselves. Let loose!\n\nComments\n\ncomments"
