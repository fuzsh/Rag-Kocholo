        "text": "Shanna Moakler has been making some serious claims about how Travis Barker and Kourtney Kardashian‘s romance has affected her relationship with her kids. The 46-year-old model recently told TMZ that Kourtney’s romance with her ex, also 46, has put a strain on her relationship with her two teens. “My family is broken because of this family and now my kids and I are alienated from each other because of another sister in the family, so yay for me,” she told the outlet late on May 21, 2021. When asked if she had a message for the 41-year-old Poosh founder, Shanna said, “thanks for destroying my family.” Learn more about Shanna with the five facts below.\n\nTravis Barker & Shanna Moakler’s Relationship\n\nShanna married the Blink-182 drummer in 2004 after two years of dating in a gothic, The Nightmare Before Christmas-inspired wedding. Travis actually proposed to Shanna in the elevator portion of the Haunted Mansion ride at Disneyland. Just two years later, Travis would file for divorce — and it was messy. The exes dragged each other on MySpace (it was that long ago) and aired their dirty laundry. They rekindled their relationship twice — even after finalizing their divorce in 2008. Ultimately, they ended their romance for good in 2009.\n\nThings are amicable between the exes. They have two beautiful children together — son Landon Asher Barker, 17, and daughter Alabama Luella Barker, 15. Shanna told HollywoodLife in a recent interview that she and Travis were co-parenting well during quarantine, and that the kids were “rotating” between their houses.\n\nShanna’s Reaction To Travis & Kourtney’s Romance\n\nShanna clearly hasn’t taken the news well. After posting a sexy photo on Instagram, the model liked a shady comment from a fan saying Travis “downgrading” with his new girlfriend. “Shhhhiiiii that broad don’t got nothin’ on you. Travis downgraded big time,” the fan wrote. But that hasn’t been her only sign of shade.\n\nAs Travis and Kourtney’s romance has heated up, the couple has taken to social media to share steamy and intimate PDA pics. “I’m very much over my ex. It’s been a long time. However, do I think some of the PDA that he’s doing with her is weird? [Yes],” Shanna told People on May 12, 2021.\n\nShanna and Kourtney actually go way back. When Shanna and Travis were still together, their kids would play with Kourtney and Scott Disick‘s little ones — Mason, 11, Penelope, 8, and Reign, 6! The trio was so tight that the Barker family even appeared in early episodes of Keeping Up With The Kardashians.\n\nShanna’s Other High-Profile Relationships\n\nPrior to getting with Travis, Shanna was in relationships with a number of famous men. Shanna was engaged to boxing heavyweight Oscar De La Hoya in 1998. The couple welcomed a daughter together, Atiana Cecilia De La Hoya (now 21) the following year. Shanna called off the engagement after watching the Latin Grammys at home and seeing Oscar with another woman at the awards show!\n\nShe also dated rocker Billy Idol from 1994 to 1996, after sharing a scene together in The Wedding Singer. Other early boyfriends included New Kids on the Block heartthrob Jordan Knight (1996 to 1997) and Dennis Quaid (2001). After splitting with Travis in 2008, Shanna moved on with Gerard Butler and biker Bryan Sollima.\n\nShanna’s Successful Modeling & Acting Career\n\nAfter winning Miss USA in 1995, Shanna made her first foray into TV with a small appearance on Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman. She became a series regular on Pacific Blue in 1998. She’s also had small roles in shows like Entourage, Joey, and CSI: Crime Scene Investigation. She’s best known for her modeling, though. She started modeling at 15 and later appeared in the pages of Playboy. She was named Playboy‘s Playmate of the Month in 2001.\n\nShanna Moakler’s Current Relationship Status"
