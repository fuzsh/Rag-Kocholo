        "text": "The other day LAist posted a link to Travis Barker's MySpace page where he went off about his ex-wife embarrassing him and their kids by being so public about her Las Vegas Divorce Party tonight at the Bellagio. We even took his side in the tragic divorce, which was hard for us because after watching their MTV reality show, he seemed like a freaky prick.\n\nShanna, the former Playboy centerfold and Miss USA, fired back at her ex-husband today in her MySpace page saying that tonight's party represents the beginning of a new phase in her life. Hopefully a phase that includes unforgettable romps with West Coast blog editors.\n\nFor some reason her MySpace has been locked to only allow \"Friends\" to view her blog posts, so of course someone sent it to us and is now available for your perusal after the jump.\n\nfirst and foremost i find playing a seperation out in the public arena not only immature but quite frankly in poor tatse, but i feel i have to stand up for myself at this point. airing dirty laundry is not a hard task, it doesnt take any skill on putting your ex's personal business or faults out in the public. it doesnt take alot of skill to LIE to make others look bad. i do not conviently and for my best intrest edit and leave huge parts of the storys out.\n\ni have since tried to take the high road and turn the other cheek even when my soon to be ex was verbally bashing me on the internet, in the media and flaunting his spiteful and vindictive relationships in my face.\n\ni am NOT the one running around the world with the town drug obsessed clown who is the epitome of everything i claim i am NOT! i have been forced to defend myslef, my character and my morals and values all the while still not putting my ex on blast.\n\ntravis has made our marriage and all that we stood for a joke at this point with his actions and creative story telling and i will find it very hard to ever forgive him.\n\ni have no problems going to vegas and celebrating a day that wasnt the end of my life but the beginning, beside being mentally and verbally abused in my marriage, i sat home alone ignored and disrespected. and i still wasnt the one who left. because i took my vows seriously and they actually meant something to me! this is not a new concept, infact this has nothing to do with me having a party in vegas at all and my ex knows that.\n\ni will not after this day spend another ounce of energy defending myself to a camp of people whose motives are to LIE and knock others down when they find happiness. at the end of the day, i have had many accomplishents BEFORE my marriage and ill have many more after, i moved to california to become an actress when i was 19! ive worked hard, i feel blessed to have the opportunitys that i have and i dont feel an ounce of guilt for taking them.\n\nim sorry that my ex feels i am beneath him as a person, as a woman and that i am not worthy of him and his band of flunkys, i guess i will have to live with that."
