        "text": "Shanna Moakler hasn’t always been supportive of her ex-husband, Travis Barker’s, relationship with Kourtney Kardashian. When Travis popped the question to the Keeping Up With the Kardashians star in October of 2021, Shanna made some shady comments. The rose and candle-strewn proposal was filmed for the new Hulu show, The Kardashians.\n\n“Before you ask why someone hates you, ask yourself why you give a f–k,” the former Miss New York USA posted in an Instagram Story.\n\nShanna claimed that she was “super happy” for her ex, but added, “I think they’re deserving of one another. I hope they get good ratings.” Ouch!\n\nSince that time, Shanna seems to have a change of heart about Kravis. In March of 2022, Shanna reconciled with her daughter with Travis, Alabama Barker.\n\nOn April 4, 2022, the Blink-182 drummer and KUWTK star went to the One Love Wedding Chapel in Las Vegas and were married by Elvis. While the world speculated as to whether the wedding was legal, Kourtney explained the early-morning nuptials on her Instagram. “Once upon a time in a land far, far away (Las Vegas) at 2am, after an epic night and a little tequila, a queen and her handsome king ventured out to the only open chapel with an Elvis and got married (with no license),” Kourtney wrote. “Practice makes perfect.”\n\nShanna reacted to the not legal ceremony in a positive way. “As long as she’s good to my children, this is the biggest point that I keep saying. And my kids like her. That’s all I care about,” Shanna stated. “My kids are happy. They’re happy. I wish them all the best,” she added.\n\nOn May 15, 2022, Kourtney and Travis legally tied the knot in the courthouse in Santa Barbara. Shanna spoke to US Weekly after Kravis tied the knot for a third time in a lavish ceremony in Portofino, Italy on May 22, 2022.\n\n“I wish the happy couple a lovely marriage,” Shanna remarked. “I will continue to only want the best for my children. It was a beautiful gesture to include my children in such a gorgeous affair,” she added.\n\nShanna shares son Landon Barker with the rocker. Travis has always had a close-knit relationship with Shanna’s daughter Atiana De La Hoya. Atiana’s father is Oscar De La Hoya.\n\nTravis and Shanna were married from 2004 to 2008. Shanna commented that she was “happy” that her children “looked happy and got to see Italy.” Kourtney’s three children with ex-boyfriend Scott Disick were also in Italy for the ceremony.\n\nRELATED: Shanna Moakler Comments On Travis Barker And Kourtney Kardashian’s IVF Journey\n\nIn February of 2022, Shanna went through a tough time while appearing on Celebrity Big Brother. House guest Todrick Hall convinced Shanna’s allies in the house, Queer Eye star Carson Kressley and Real Housewives of Atlanta star Cynthia Bailey, that Shanna was trying to evict Carson. Lies! But Carson and Cynthia fell for it, and Shanna was evicted.\n\nMeanwhile, Shanna’s boyfriend at the time, Matthew Rondeau, slid into the DM’s of CBB cast member Teddi Mellencamp. He also deleted all the photos of Shanna from his Instagram.\n\nThen everything took a scary turn when Matthew went live on social media and accused Shanna of having multiple affairs and still being in love with Travis. His rant allegedly included threats.\n\nShanna’s manager updated everyone about Shanna’s condition after this incident. “Thank you to everyone calling with concern about Shanna. She is OK and survived this traumatic experience,” her manager said. “Thankfully the police saved her from harm’s way, and she is doing fine.”\n\nTELL US- WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT SHANNA’S REACTION TO KRAVIS’ WEDDING IN ITALY?
