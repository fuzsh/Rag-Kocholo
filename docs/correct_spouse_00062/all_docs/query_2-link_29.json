More information in regards to his return to Europe and rescheduled dates will be provided as soon as available.\"\n\nThe hitmakers recently reunited for the first time in 10 years and recorded their new single Edging.\n\nALMOST HERE\n\nKourtney is currently pregnant with the couple's first child and has shown off her baby bump in recent weeks.\n\nThe news has sparked speculation that his absence is due to her and has expressed concern about the famous reality star.\n\nIn mid-June, Kourtney announced they were expecting their first child together at a Blink-182 concert in Los Angeles.\n\nShe held up a sign that said: \"Travis, I'm pregnant\" - a nod to the band's music video for All The Small Things."
