        "text": "Two years after her wedding, Kourtney Kardashian finds herself fighting off divorce rumors – again.\n\nIs her marriage with Travis Barker really in trouble? If it is, the pair have a funny way of showing that they’re anything less than madly in love with each other.\n\nBut to say that a divorce couldn’t happen is premature also. After all, show us a happily married Hollywood couple and we’ll show you 50 more that didn’t make it.\n\nSo what is the latest with Kourtney and Travis? Let’s dive in.\n\nKourtney Kardashian’s Not Getting A Divorce\n\nKravis fans can take a deep breathe. So far as we know, the love between Kourtney and Travis is stronger than ever, even when they’re worlds apart.\n\nThe trouble all started as fans became concerned by the fact that Kourtney hasn’t posted any new photos with Travis for a bit on her social media. Since these two live for a PDA shot, it did strike us as odd as well.\n\nThat is, until you take into account that Travis is in the middle of a world tour with Blink-182. To quote Luke Hobbs, “Daddy’s gotta go to work!”\n\nFears should be quelled though. Travis is back stateside for the summer dates of the tour, and by all accounts, he was on hand for her birthday on April 18. Plus, if someone who didn’t want to stay married write this to his wife?\n\n“Happy Birthday to my beautiful wife, soulmate and best friend forever,” Travis posted on Instagram. “I love you, I love our life together. Thank you for being the most amazing wife a person could ask for. Here’s to many more years of adventures together”\n\nUm, sounds pretty happy to us! Oh, and if you needed further proof, behold her response:\n\n“Husband of my dreams. I love our life!!”\n\nHow Did Kourtney and Travis Divorce Rumors Start?\n\nSo why all the commotion about Kourtney getting a divorce if everything she says and does screams to the contrary? Two words for you: Scott Disick.\n\nAs many Kravis fans that are out there, some still hold dear to the love Kourtney had before. Scott Disick was Kourtney’s on-and-off again boyfriend for nearly a decade. The pair share three children together, yet despite all that time, they never actually got married.\n\nDuring the 2021 KUWTK reunion special, Kourtney admitted to Andy Cohen that Scott’s drug abuse was the “deal breaker” that kept them for taking the next step. He also had a history of cheating on Kourtney multiple times.\n\nSo why so much love for Scott? Well, aside from being the father of Mason, Penelope, and Reign, he also has strong relationships with Kourtney’s sisters. In a way, many view him to be the second brother the girls never had. (LOVE YOU ROB!)\n\nTravis Barker’s Behavior During Kourt’s Labor Was ‘Grounds for Divorce’\n\nScott aside, sometimes fans like to throw out the “D” word when it comes to these two just because, well, they find the pair a bit odd.\n\nTake the arrival of their son, Rocky. The little one was born at the end of 2023, and while it took awhile for the parents to share the first picture, they did share details about the birth.\n\nTravis was slammed online after sharing a video of him practicing the drums while his wife Kourtney was in labor. The Blink-182 drummer said that he was “practicing to his baby’s heartbeat.” You may find that precious, but others called the move “obnoxious”\n\nOne fan actually wrote: “Travis was doing this to the baby’s heartbeat so that’s sweet but still…. DIVORCE!!!”\n\nA little over the top, but it’s stuff like this the fuels the flame."
