        "text": "Congratulations are in order for Kourtney Kardashian and Travis Barker, who tied the knot over the weekend.\n\nAccording to multiple outlets, the couple secretly wed at the famous One Love Wedding Chapel in Las Vegas, shortly after the 2022 Grammy Awards, where Barker performed with H.E.R. and Lenny Kravitz.\n\nThe surprise ceremony reportedly took place close to 1:45 a.m. on Monday morning, with Kardashian and Barker in the same clothes they wore to the Grammys. The Poosh founder wore a black, cutout jumpsuit by Et Ochs from the brand’s fall 2022 ready-to-wear collection, while the musician wore a sleeveless black suit by Givenchy.\n\nThe couple called ahead and supposedly requested that an Elvis Presley impersonator officiate the ceremony. The nuptials reportedly lasted approximately 30 minutes and no video recording was allowed.\n\nYou May Also Like\n\nHowever, some sources reveal that the two are actually not legally married yet as they did not get a marriage license beforehand.\n\nOn Wednesday, Kardashian addressed their union, and the fact that they did not have a license, by uploading a carousel of images on her official Instagram page.\n\n“Once upon a time in a land far, far away (Las Vegas) at 2am, after an epic night and a little tequila, a queen and her handsome king ventured out to the only open chapel with an Elvis and got married (with no license),” she captioned the post. “Practice makes perfect.”\n\nThe images show the two in matching leather jackets and sunglasses, smiling, laughing and kissing from the ceremony.\n\nThe duo also attended the 2022 Oscars the previous week, with Kardashian attending to support Barker, who also performed at the awards show.\n\nKardashian and Barker started dating in January 2021. Later that year in October, Barker proposed to her at a beachside hotel in Montecito, Calif.\n\nThroughout their relationship, the duo have never shied away from their affection for one another. Similar to Megan Fox and Machine Gun Kelly, Kardashian and Barker found ways to complement each other’s styles and personalities well in different iterations of all-black couple outfits.\n\nThe two finally made their red carpet debut at the MTV Video Music Awards in September, where both appeared in all-black ensembles and snapped photos touching tongues alongside Fox and Machine Gun Kelly.\n\nREAD MORE HERE:\n\nKourtney Kardashian Looks to Vintage Mugler at 2022 Oscars\n\nKourtney Kardashian and Travis Barker Are Engaged: A Look at Their Couples’ Style"
