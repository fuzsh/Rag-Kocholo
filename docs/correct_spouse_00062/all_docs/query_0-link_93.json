        "text": "It’s been 13 long years since Shanna Moakler and Travis Barker ended their relationship, but that doesn’t mean the former Miss USA wants to see her ex-husband and his new bae Kourtney Kardashian all over social media and in the headlines.\n\nA source close to Moakler told People that she has \"moved on\" from the Blink-182 drummer, but it's been troubling for her to see all those romantic grand gestures Barker is doing for Kardashian (and splashing all over Instagram) since they're apparently identical to things he did for Moakler during their relationship.\n\n“It’s been hurtful that everything he’s doing for Kourtney he did before for her, like the plane flying overhead, the flowers. It’s all exactly the same,” the source said.\n\nBarker celebrated Kardashian’s 42nd birthday over the weekend. He gifted her an amazing floral display that included white tulips and green moss in a vase with white gardenias hanging FROM 👏 THE 👏 CEILING 👏. They also took off to Laguna Beach for a romantic getaway and he surprised her with an airplane sky banner that flew across the beach, reading, “Happy Birthday Kourtney!!❤️”\n\n&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;nbsp;\n\nThe source said that Moakler and Barker, who were married from 2004 to 2008, “are cordial with each other and are friendly — they have a long history together,” but seeing her ex-husband’s romantic gestures for Kardashian has been difficult for her to handle.\n\n“Again she’s moved on from Travis and has her own boyfriend and life, but this is just hurtful to her,” the source added.\n\nMoakler shares three children with Barker: 15-year-old Alabama Luella, 17-year-old Landon Asher and 22-year-old Atiana De La Hoya (whose biological dad is Oscar De La Hoya).\n\nBarker and Kardashian recently took a ski vacation to Deer Valley, Utah, with their children, but now the former Playboy model reportedly feels uncomfortable with Keeping Up With the Kardashians star buying her kids gifts.\n\n“Shanna of course, wants her children to get along with their father’s girlfriend,” the source said, but added that Moakler feels uncomfortable when it comes to Kardashian buying the kids lavish gifts because “she isn’t as rich and can’t compete with that.”\n\nThis isn’t the first time that Moakler has thrown shade towards Barker and his new girlfriend.\n\nAfter Barker got Kardashian’s name tattooed on his chest, Moakler said: “Welcome to the club. He’s got a couple more on there too.” She said that Barker has her name and their wedding date tattooed somewhere on his body. Moakler pointed out that she still has “Travis” tattooed on her wrist, but said now it’s Kardashian’s turn to ink his name on her body.\n\n&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;nbsp;\n\nShe also took a dig at the entire Kardashian family over Instagram in early April. Moakler posted a glamour shot of herself and captioned it: “My mama don’t like you and she likes everyone.... ❤️⚓️.”\n\nA fan commented, “My mama likes everyone besides the Kardashians” and Moakler replied, “mine too lol.”\n\nMeanwhile, it seems that Kardashian’s ex-boyfriend Scott Disick is also having a hard time with her new relationship.\n\nA source recently told People that Disick, who shares Mason, 11, Penelope, 8, and Reign, 6, with Kardashian, is “struggling.”\n\n“Scott was pretty shocked when he found out that they are dating, and he can tell that they have moved very quickly,” the source said. “His kids love Travis, which is also hard for Scott. Kourtney and Travis are like a family with the kids. Scott is having a hard time with this situation.”\n\nThe insider added that Disick knows he \"messed up their relationship\" together but he still hoped \"that they would end up back together.\"\n\nIt's understandable on some level that it would be difficult to watch your ex fall in love very publicly with another person but here's to hoping that Moakler and Disick let Barker and Kardashian thrive in their relationship.\n\nBEFORE YOU GO: Travis Barker got a new Kardashian tattoo\n\n[video_embed id='2184063']BEFORE YOU GO: Travis Barker got a new Kardashian tattoo[/video_embed]"
