        "text": "Kourtney Kardashian and Travis Barker have had a very passionate and public relationship and were engaged after less than a year of dating in October 2021. They shared photos from the beach proposal in Montecito, California.\n\nThey ended up having quite a few weddings ceremonies, one in las Vegas, one in a Santa Barbara clerk's office to make things legal, and one in Italy. This might all seem fast, but they have actually been friends and neighbors for quite some time. They both have homes in Calabasas but have been in other relationships.\n\nKardashian has three children with her ex, Scott Disick: Mason, Penelope, and Reign. Barker has two children: Landon and Alabama, with his ex-wife Shanna Moakler, and is the step-dad to Moakler's daughter, Atiana Cecilia De La Hoya.\n\nIn June, Kardashian and Barker announced they were expecting their first child together.\n\nHere's Kourtney Kardashian and Travis Barker’s complete relationship timeline.\n\nJanuary 2021\n\nThe couple was seen together in Palm Springs at Kris Jenner’s home there, sparking rumors they might be dating. People reported in late January that it was official, with a source saying, “They’re in Palm Springs together. They’ve been dating for about a month or two.” The source added, “Travis has liked her for a while.”\n\nFebruary 2021\n\nE! reported they went to dinner at Matsuhisa in Los Angeles, and an eyewitness told the publication that “they seem very connected, very close. Travis took her hand, and they giggled as they started having a little thumb war with one another. It was playful and sweet. They were talking constantly and very engaged with one another. It seems like such a natural fit.”\n\nThey spent that Valentine's Day together, according to Page Six. Barker went semi-Instagram official by sharing a photo of a diamond anklet that he gave her on his Instagram Story. Kardashian shared an ode to her new boyfriend on her Instagram Story: “Roses are red / Violets are blue / Garlic bread / Blink-182,” the poem read.\n\nShe later went official-official with a picture of her hand and Barker's entwined. Barker commented “🖤” on the post. A source told People at the time,“Kourtney is very happy with Travis. She wanted to confirm their relationship, because it's something positive.”\n\nMarch 2021\n\nIn early March, Barker made an appearance on The Drew Barrymore Show. Barrymore asked Barker about dating with kids, and he took the opportunity to praise Kardashian.\n\n“Up until now, I would date girls who didn't have kids, and I find it kind of hard because I think they would have trouble understanding, like, ‘Why don't you want to go to dinner every night with me? Or why don't you want to see me every night?’,” Barker said. “And now, I'm spending time with a woman who's a great mom, who's a great friend, and you don't have to worry about any of those things. It just comes natural.”\n\nLater in March, they were photographed at UFC 260: Miocic vs. Ngannou 2 fight, alongside friends Megan Fox and Machine Gun Kelly.\n\nApril 2021\n\nThey took their first family vacation in April, heading to Deer Valley, Utah. Kardashian shared pics featuring Alabama and Atiana on snowmobiles.\n\nKardashian called Barker her boyfriend for the first time in a TikTok posted by Barker's daughter, Alabama, while playing the viral “Pass the Phone” challenge.\n\n“I'm passing the phone to my boyfriend,” she said.\n\nBarker also shared content from the vacation, including some videos from the slopes.\n\nThey spent that Easter together as well, and Kris Jenner shared pics of the family gathering on Instagram.\n\n“Happy Easter, and thank you @callawaygolf #irvingazoff for making our Easter so special!!! 🙏🐰🐣🐥🙏 and thank you for the @coreygamble @realtristan13 @travisscott @travisbarker that are already on the golf course!!!!!!! LOL #impatient,” Jenner captioned the post.\n\nThat month, a source told Entertainment Tonight that things had become “way more serious.”\n\n“This is the happiest Kourtney has been in a while, and her family is thrilled for her,” the source said. “Kourtney and Travis' kids get along great, and all have the best time together.

But After dinner, I developed excruciating pain and have been hospitalized ever since.”\n\nHe continued, “During the endoscopy, I had a very small polyp removed right in a very sensitive area, usually handled by specialists, which unfortunately damaged a critical pancreatic drainage tube.

If that’s a baby, then I believe that it will happen.”\n\nShe said added that her seven frozen eggs from before she started dating Barker “didn’t survive, [and none of them] made it to an embryo.”\n\n“The freezing of the eggs isn’t guaranteed,” she said. “I think that that’s a misunderstanding. People do it thinking that it’s like a safety net and it’s not.”\n\nShe added, “Whatever’s meant to be... Being happy is most important, and being a good parent to my kids.”\n\nJune 2023\n\nIn June, Kardashian and Barker announced they were expecting a baby by having the POOSH founder hold up a sign reading, “Travis, I'm pregnant” at a Blink-182 concert.\n\nJust one week later, they shared the baby’s sex with a shot of blue confetti: They are having a boy.\n\nA source told Entertainment Tonight in June, “Kourtney and Travis are on cloud nine.

She says she had even given up on tracking her ovulation, but she still new when the baby was conceived.\n\n“It happened on Valentine's Day,” Kourtney announced.\n\nIn a confessional, a produce asked her to clarify, saying, “You know when it happened?”\n\nKourtney answered, “Yeah, of course. I mean, people would always say to us, ‘The second you stop trying it's just gonna happen.’ We stopped doing IVF maybe two months before our wedding, so it took a year, I think, for all of those hormones and chemicals to get out of my system.”\n\nShe went on, “We were not trying whatsoever. I didn't even check my ovulation anymore. We decided to put it in God's hands. I thought it was just not happening, and we were, like, accepting of it, and then, God's plan.”\n\nThe show went on to explain that Kourtney knew of her pregnancy all season and offered some flashbacks from previous moments alluding to a possible pregnancy.\n\n“I mean, it truly feels like a miracle, being able to be pregnant and have a baby with the love of my life,” Kourtney concluded.\n\nDecember 2023\n\nSince the birth of Rocky Thirteen, a source says these two parents have only gotten closer.\n\n“Kourtney and Travis are over the moon and could not be more elated that they share a child of their own together,” the insider told Entertainment Tonight. “Kourtney and Travis already had an unbreakable bond, but having a baby together has brought them even closer and made them fall even more in love. This experience has solidified their feelings that they were destined to be together.”\n\nThey went on, “Travis loves to shower Kourtney with gifts, but is also there for her on a deep level. He is an incredibly dedicated father and partner. They’re so excited to experience this new chapter together and unite their families even more.”\n\nThe baby has been in good health and the couple's previous kids have only gotten closer, too.\n\n“It’s been so much fun for all of them to have a baby brother around and something new that they can all share together,” said the source. “Each of them have a special bond with Rocky in their own unique ways. Kourtney's family is also always coming over and her sisters and Kris are all very hands-on and helpful.”\n\nThings have also been going well with Scott Disick and his co-parenting with Kardashian.\n\n“Scott is doing his best to keep things balanced in terms of co-parenting and making sure to be present and communicative,” the source said. “He’s continuing to fulfill all his responsibilities and be a great father to his kids.”\n\nJanuary 2024\n\nKardashian and Barker made a surprise appearance together at the Emmys on January 15.

Kardashian’s pregnancy with Rocky “was touch and go for a moment, but everyone is healthy and happy, and it has made them want even more children together,” the source claimed. “This pregnancy challenged their love for each other in such a way that it is even better than it was—it makes people vomit with all the lovey-dovey high school related PDA they share.”\n\n“Since Rocky is so young and they are enjoying him, next year would be the soonest time to start thinking about more kids,” they continued. “They have talked about trying for another child, but this time around they would likely go through a surrogate.
