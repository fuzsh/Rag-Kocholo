        "text": "Shanna Moakler has accused ex-husband Travis Barker of \"womanizing\" and wooing their children with expensive gifts and experiences she cannot afford.\n\nThe 48-year-old model has daughter Alabama, 18, and son Landon, 20, with the 48-year-old Blink-182 rocker — who is also stepfather to her 24-year-old daughter Atiana with Oscar De La Hoya — and she has ripped into the musician and accused him of having a \"drinking problem\" and addiction in a scathing new podcast interview.\n\nSpeaking on Bunnie XO's Dumb Blonde podcast, she fumed: \"He did me pretty dirty. His drinking is a problem. His womanising, his addiction.\"\n\nShanna went on to slam Travis' wife Kourtney Kardashian's family as \"disgusting\" and accused Travis of \"parental alienation\" when he got together with the Poosh founder — who is the mother of his newborn son Rocky Thirteen.\n\nShe moaned: \"You're disgusting. I removed myself so that they couldn't bond with my children over hating me. Go do what you guys need to do and when you're ready, I will be here loving you unconditionally.\n\n\"And I will be here as your mother, and I will wait. And that's what I did.\n\n\"There are people that don't like that family, don't watch their show and don't give a [damn] what Kim [Kardashian] is doing with her [butt].\"\n\nShanna — who was married to Travis from 2004 to 2008 — claims Travis uses his wealth to impress his children and make out he's the better parent.\n\nShe continued: \"When Travis got with Kourtney, there was some parental alienation going on there, where Travis — even when we weren't together — always wanted to be the 'super dad'.\n\n\"'I'm the best parent. I'm the this and that, and I'm like, 'Bro, you win.' Like, you're the winner here. You have all the money and you have all this. You're the winner.\"\n\nAnd she believes her children were \"caught up\" in the famous family's \"glitter and fame\" that she can never compete with.\n\nShe went on: \"I think there was a lot of glitter and fame and they watched them on TV and now their dad is dating one and they're going to be on the show. And I think they got caught up in that, which young kids would do.\n\n\"They're buying them Prada, and they're buying them gifts, and they're going to these events and they're meeting Kanye and, you know, all this big stuff.\n\n\"I can't give them that. I don't have that. I don't have access to that. I don't have the money to do that. I can't buy you guys Prada every other week and stuff. I don't. I can't do it. My house isn't a mansion like, Travis'. I don't have a movie theatre. I don't have golf carts for you kids to drive.\""
