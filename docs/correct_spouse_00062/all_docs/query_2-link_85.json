        "text": "Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor were both married when they met on the set of Cleopatra. The actors left their spouses for one another, got married in 1964, and after 10 years divorced in 1974. Don't worry: The following year, they reunited and eloped in Botswana, but divorced *again* in 1976.\n\nPamela Anderson wed her longtime friend, Rick Salomon, in Las Vegas in October 2007. It was the Baywatch star's third marriage, but it didn't last long, as she petitioned for an annulment two months later. The couple's marriage was annulled in 2008 and Pamela reunited with her other ex-husband, Tommy Lee, shortly after. Ready for a curveball? In 2014, Pamela and Rick shocked everyone when they announced they'd secretly tied the knot for the second time. Their union lasted six months this time.\n\nMelanie Griffith was 14 years old and Don Johnson was 22 when they met on the set of The Harrad Experiment. By her 18th birthday, they were engaged. They eloped in Las Vegas in 1976, but their marriage only lasted six months. After years apart (plus a marriage for Melanie and children for both), they reunited in 1989 and remarried in a small ceremony in Aspen, Colorado. However, their second marriage didn't last forever, either, and they divorced in 1996.\n\nIn 1956, Natalie Wood and Robert Wagner were set up by their Hollywood studio as a publicity stunt, but a year later they were married. They were one of Hollywood's favorite couples, but got divorced in 1962. They both married other people and moved on, only to reunite and tie the knot again in 1972. They were married until Natalie's tragic death in 1981.\n\nElon Musk and actress Talulah Riley got married in 2010, but split after two years, which the Tesla CEO announced via Twitter, saying, \"@rileytalulah It was an amazing four years. I will love you forever. You will make someone very happy one day.\" Just one year later, the divorced couple remarried; however, they finalized their second divorce in 2016.\n\nThe TV journalist and Hollywood producer, known for his work on shows like The Waltons, first married in 1981, only to divorce in 1984. They remarried in an at-home ceremony in Beverly Hills in 1986. According to People, Barbara spoke at the reception, telling her guests, \"This is the way it will always be: Merv will always say the perfect thing, and I’ll always get the last word.\" Alas, they divorced again in 1992.\n\nLarry King was married eight (!) times, but his third and fifth marriages were to the same person. Larry married former Playboy bunny Alene Akins in 1961, and they were married for two years before he filed for divorce in 1963. In 1969, Larry and Alene reunited and remarried, only to divorce (yep) again in 1972. In 2017, Larry mourned the loss of his ex-wife, sharing on Twitter, \"So very saddened over the passing of Alene Akins, who died peacefully with our children Chaia and Andy by her side. She was a grand lady.\"\n\nEminem and his high school sweetheart, Kimberly Scott, were together during his rise to fame in the late '90s. In 1999, the couple said \"I do.\" However, the rapper and Kim had a tumultuous relationship, and ultimately, they divorced in 2001. While sharing custody of their daughter, they rekindled their relationship and remarried in 2006, but they didn't sign the marriage license and were broken up again one month later.\n\nGrammy Award-winning singer Dionne Warwick married actor and musician William Elliott in 1966, but the couple parted ways a year later. The separation didn't last long and they remarried in 1967, but separated for good in 1975. \"I was the major earning power in the family and that is very difficult for the male ego,\" Dionne told The Guardian. \"It just got too much to bear for my husband, and we decided that it would be best for us to part ways.\"\n\nElliott Gould and Jennifer Bogart met when she was just 18 years old and dated for four years before tying the knot in 1973. Two years later they divorced, and three years after that they remarried in 1978. Their second union lasted for more than 10 years, but ultimately they divorced again in 1989. Elliott has not remarried since his marriage to Jennifer and told The Guardian that he \"will be married to Jenny forever—until she can do better.\"\n\nJudge Judy Sheindlin met her husband, Jerry Sheindlin, while working as a prosecutor. The couple married in 1976 and had three children, but after 14 years, the couple divorced in 1990. They didn't stay apart for too long, remarrying a year later, and they've been together ever since. \"I missed Jerry,\" Judge Judy told Closer Weekly. \"I like to have someone to fuss over. I like to be mated. It’s natural for me. I learned the hard way that sometimes what you think makes you happy won't.\"\n\nThe Hollywood actress first married Richard Fincher in 1957, but they divorced in 1963, only to remarry in 1966. Two children later, they divorced once more in 1969. Richard was Gloria's third and fourth marriage, and she never married again.\n\nJennifer Lee met comedian Richard Pryor in 1977, after being hired to decorate his home. The couple said \"I do\" in 1981 and were married for a year before divorcing.

They got married for the second time in 2001 and were together until his death in 2005.\n\nRenowned Mexican painter Frida Kahlo's marriage to Diego Rivera was known for being complex.

One year after the dissolution of their union, the artists remarried in 1940 and were together until Frida's death in 1954.\n\nFormer Real Housewives of Atlanta star NeNe Leakes married Gregg Leakes long before her reality TV fame. The couple was first married in 1997, but three years after she joined the reality show, they filed for divorce. As viewers know, the Leakes reunited and remarried in 2013.\n\nLana Turner and her second husband, Joseph Stephen Crane, were first married in 1942.

They had one daughter together and divorced in 1944.\n\nMarie Osmond and Steve Craig were married from 1982 to 1985. After years apart, and after Marie divorced her second husband, they reunited and remarried in 2011—she even wore the same wedding dress! \"Stephen was getting married and we [realized] we can't go to our son's wedding and not be married,\" Marie told People. \"So we got married a few months before he did. He joked that he never thought it would happen, but it did.\"\n\nSophia Loren and Carlo Ponti's road to marriage was rocky, as the Italian film producer was married with two children when they met. In 1957, they wed by proxy in Mexico. For years after, they were forced to live in exile, as charges of bigamy were raised against them in Italy and by the Vatican. In 1962, it was revealed that their marriage was not valid, so it was annulled, and the couple remarried four years later in France.\n\nTerrence Howard and Lori McCommas first got married in 1989, but divorced in 2003.
