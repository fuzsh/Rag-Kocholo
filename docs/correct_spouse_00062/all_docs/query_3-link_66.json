        "text": "Kourtney Kardashian and Travis Barker have been friends for years, but in late 2020 that all changed, and now they're shaping up to be one of our favourite celebrity couples. Here's a look back at how it all began for these two, from family dinners to finally making things official - and their epic Italian wedding!\n\nLet's take a look at their relationship timeline, starting with the most recent update:\n\n17th June 2023: So many congratulations are in order for Kourtney and Travis, who have revealed she is pregnant and expecting their first child together. In a video from a Blink-182 gig, where Travis plays the drums, Kourtney jumped around in the audience holding up a 'TRAVIS I'M PREGNANT' banner, and honestly, it's made our weekend.\n\nThe pair have been open about their fertility struggles, so this is the best news for them. Kourtney has three children with ex-partner Scott Disick (Mason, 12, Penelope, 10, and Reign, eight), while Travis shares three children with his ex-wife, Shanna Moakler: Atiana De La Hoya, Landon Asher Barker, and Alabama Luella Barker.\n\nHere's the rest of Kourtney and Travis's relationship history, because let's face it – this is a true modern romance story:\n\n2019: Kourtney and Travis dating rumours first start doing the rounds when the pair are spotted having dinner with their kids in Malibu. However, the Blink 182 drummer swiftly plays things down at the time, telling People, “Kourtney’s like a dear friend. That’s it... I mean, I love her to death. I love her family to death. But yeah, just friends.”\n\nWhile a source told E! News that it was nothing more than a friendly family dinner. \"They've been friends for years,\" the insider revealed. \"They've lived in the same neighbourhood for a long time and they see each other at church and with their kids.\"\n\n11 January, 2021: But, two years later, it looks like friendship has developed into something romantic when eagle-eyed fans notice Kourtney bought Travis's daughter Alabama a Prada bag for Christmas - the same bag she also bought sister Khloé. A source told The Sun at the time, \"Kourtney and Travis are very close and they have unreal chemistry.\"\n\n24 January, 2021: The pair's Instagram followers notice they're posting pictures from the same location: Kris Jenner's incredible Palm Springs home. Confirming the news, a source told People, \"They're in Palm Springs together. They've been dating for about a month or two. They've been friends for a long time but it's turned romantic. Travis has liked her for a while.\"\n\n27 January, 2021: A source reveals how Scott Disick feels about Kourtney and Travis dating (not that Kourt should care, but y'know). \"Scott hasn't been reacting much to Kourtney and Travis dating,\" the insider told Entertainment Tonight. \"It's always a bit of an adjustment when one of them is dating someone new, but at the end of the day, he obviously wants Kourtney to be happy and they're focused on co-parenting together.\"\n\n1 February, 2021: The Instagram flirting has officially started. The Blink 182 star uploaded a video of him playing the drums for a group called Feeble in 1995 on Instagram, showing off his impressive skills. \"Wow,\" Kourtney replied. We see you, Kourt.\n\n2 February, 2021: Fans are convinced Travis's lock screen is a picture of Kourtney after she posted a picture of *someone's* lock screen featuring a fire bikini pic of her to her Instagram Stories and added: “P.S. This lock screen does not belong to me.”\n\n3 February, 2021: This time it's Travis's turn to leave a comment on one of Kourtney's pictures:\n\n4 February, 2021: An Entertainment Tonight source now says Scott is actually a little \"jealous\" of their relationship after all. \"[Scott] is definitely a little jealous. Scott does know that he has the upper hand being the father of Kourtney’s kids and that they still have an incredibly special bond, and no one can come between that. Their history together and love for each other can’t be touched by anyone else, and they both know that.”\n\n9 February, 2021: Kourtney and Travis are spotted together for the first time since the relationship rumours started, and they weren't shy about showing some interesting PDA. And by interesting PDA we mean playing thumb wars across the table. Cute. The duo enjoyed a date night at a Japanese restaurant in Los Angeles, with an eyewitness saying they seemed \"very close\".\n\n\"They seemed completely taken with one another as if they were the only two people in the world,\" they told E! News. \"They seem very connected, very close. Travis took her hand and they giggled as they started having a little thumb war with one another. It was playful and sweet. They were talking constantly and very engaged in one another.\"\n\n17 February, 2021: It's Instagram official! Kourtney posts the sweetest picture of her hand in Travis's and although she keeps it simple and forgoes a caption, close family friend Khadijah Haqq McCray confirms the news by writing, \"When friends become lovers ❤️\" in the comments.\n\nKourtney's lifestyle and wellbeing brand, Poosh, also chimes in with a reference to a Blink 182 song (the band which Travis is the drummer in) saying: \"We’re feeling this 😉.\" (Ten points for whoever is behind that account). As for Travis, he opts for a black heart emoji and reshares the post on his Instagram Stories. OH YOU GUYS!\n\n21 February, 2021: Travis took to Instagram to show off just how loved up the couple already are. On his Instagram Story, he shared a love note from Kourtney, which read: \"To lots of fun adventures, may we destroy each other completely. Love Kourtney.\"\n\n4 March, 2021: Travis has opened up about his relationship with Kourtney during an appearance on Drew Barrymore's CBS talk show. While he didn't mention the KUWTK star by name, he did reference the love note Kourtney recently wrote him.\n\n\"To lots of fun adventures. May we destroy each other completely. Love, Kourtney,\" the note read. Drew joked, \"My love note would be like, 'Can we get to bed early and watch a movie?'\"\n\nBut Travis disagreed, saying: \"I would prefer the opposite. I would prefer to, kind of, go in the blaze of glory and ball of flames.\"\n\nThe father-of-three also opened up about dating partners who don't have kids and those who do. \"I've done both up until now. I dated girls who didn't have kids and I find it hard because they would have trouble understanding like, 'Why don't you want to go to dinner every night with me?' or 'Why don't you want to see me every night?' And now I'm spending time with a woman who's a great mum, who's a great friend and you don't have to worry about any of those things,\" he said.\n\nThe Blink 182 star continued, \"It just comes natural, it's like a maturity thing. And I also really like missing someone and cherishing the time that I spend with them instead of every day being with them, especially in the beginning of the relationship. I think missing someone is so important.\" So cute.\n\n14 March, 2021: Travis leaves an emoji comment on Kourtney's Instagram page and fans pick up on the cheeky message. \"My happy place,\" she wrote alongside two bikini photos in front of a swimming pool.\n\n\"😍\" Travis commented, which has since had over 4,000 likes and 100 replies. People are very much shipping this couple!\n\n19 March, 2021: Love is well and truly in the air for Kourtney and Travis, who have been sharing cute pics on socials like there’s no tomorrow. Most recently, on Friday 19 March, Travis took to Instagram to show off their romance once again.\n\nA photo posted to his story shows “Travis [heart] Kourtney” written in chocolate on a white plate.\n\nJust a few days before, the pair were spotted packing on the PDA while out and about in Los Angeles. Kourtney had her arms wrapped around Travis’ waist and her head on his chest as they waited for the valet to drop off their car. When the car arrived, Travis held open the door for her while she got in.\n\nSo, uhhh, if anyone wants to write us a cute message in chocolate let us know, yeah?\n\n24 March, 2021: Right, these two are getting pretty serious now. It's not just Instagram comments and winky faces (although, it's still that a bit), now it's full-blown \"I love you\" notes.\n\nIn his latest Instagram Story Travis shared a picture with fans of a note from Kourtney reading \"I love you\" along with a little heart drawn next to it. Although he didn't explicitly say the note was from Kourtney, fans quickly recognised her handwriting from a previous note she had left for Travis a few weeks earlier.\n\nThese two, eh?\n\n29 March, 2021: Kourtney Kardashian and Travis Barker are spotted on a double date with Machine Gun Kelly, who has collaborated with the Blink 182 star in the past, and actor Megan Fox in Las Vegas. The two couples were in sin city to watch a UFC match, and both were snapped looking extremely cosy in the VIP section.\n\nThe outing comes as Travis got a new tattoo that fans are convinced might be a tribute to his girlfriend. There are two clues potentially linking the new tat to Kourtney, so be prepared to get your detective hat on for this one:\n\nTravis's new thigh tattoo reads \"You're so cool!\" in what looks like somebody's handwriting along with a love heart, with Travis even sharing a video of him finishing his own tattoo himself. Rather you than us, Travis.\n\nKourtney, of course, showed her support for the new tat by commenting \"You’re so cool!\" on Travis's video too.\n\nSafe to say the pair love the quote, and that's because it's actually a line from the Quentin Tarantino film True Romance. Eagle-eyed fans have spotted that Kourtney actually posted some screenshots from the film on Instagram back in January, and it's thought that the couple have a mutual love for the film.\n\nBut the clues don't stop there. Fans have spotted that the handwriting on Travis's tattoo looks just like Kourtney's own handwriting, which we've previously seen in a sweet note that Kourtney left for Travis.\n\nThe note, which Travis previously shared on his Instagram story, said: \"To lots of fun adventures, may we destroy each other completely. Love, Kourtney.\"\n\nFans have certainly spotted the link between the notes and Travis's tattoo, with one commenting on his Instagram post, \"Did Kourt write that on you! ❤️\". Meanwhile, another said, \"Kourtney wrote that huh 😍❤️🙌🔥\".\n\n9 April, 2021: If there's one thing we know, it's that celebrities in relationships love getting tattoos, and Kourtney and Travis are apparently no different. The new couple who went public in January look to be getting pretty serious. Not only are there 'I love you' notes, but now it looks as though Travis has got Kourtney's name tattooed on his chest.\n\nEarlier on today, while on the set of a new music video Travis was spotted with what looked to be the word Kourtney tattooed across his chest, just above his left nipple. While we were busy zooming in to confirm that it was definitely the word we thought it was, Kourtney herself posted a close up of the tattoo on her own Instagram.\n\nWhile we don't know when exactly he got the tattoo, it wasn't there in a picture of Travis from the end of March so it looks like it could be a pretty recent addition. Well that's quite the commitment isn't it...\n\n12 April, 2021: Fans CANNOT get over the candid admission Travis just made about his sex life with Kourtney. The drummer took to Instagram to share a super suggestive caption, before tagging the Keeping Up With The Kardashians star in the photo, despite the fact she's not actually present. Wo-oh.\n\n\"All day I dream about sex w/ you,\" he wrote with the picture of him drumming, tagging Kourtney in the sky. Not only did Kourtney like the pic, but fans were all over it in the comments.\n\nOne wrote, \"Awww Kourtney forever ❤️❤️❤️ \" while another added ,\"Lucky Kourt!\" another put, \"He's in love!\"\n\n27 April 2021: There's no better way to say 'we're in love and we want everyone to know it' than a cuddle in swimwear in the middle of the desert, right? \"Just Like Heaven,\" Kourtney wrote with a photo of her straddling Travis as he picked her up.\n\n\"🖤 EVERYTHING,\" the Blink-182 drummer commented, before sharing the post to his story with a screengrab of The Cure's song 'Just Like Heaven' on his Stories.\n\n12 May, 2021: These two are quickly becoming the PDA-est of all couples. From the kissing in the desert picture to that thumb sucking video we feel like we've had quite the insight into their whirlwind romance. And it doesn't look like they'll be stopping anytime soon either. Travis recently took to Instagram Stories to show fans his brand new Goop candle, and it's \"Kourtney's Orgasm\" scented, of course.\n\nI mean, congratulations to Kourt and Travis who seem to be having the time of their lives together, but also, wow.\n\n21 May 2021: Kourtney and Travis go to Disneyland just days after Kylie Jenner and Travis Scott, and the Blink-182 drummer shares some PDA pics from their trip (because of course).\n\n\"Happiest Place On Earth 🌍\" he wrote with a picture holding Kourt's hand, to which she replied, \"happiest\" with a red love heart.\n\n3 July, 2021: Kourtney and Travis spent the weekend together with his daughter (15-year-old Alabama Barker) and step-daughter (22-year-old Atiana De La Hoya, who he helped raise with his ex, Shanna Moakler). Atiana tagged Kourtney in her Instagram Story as she shared snaps from their weekend away.\n\nSpeaking to E! News about Kourtney's relationship with Travis' kids, a close source revealed she's become like a \"second mother\" to them.\n\n\"Kourtney has become very close with Travis' kids recently,\" said the source, adding that she's been \"a huge support system.\"\n\n7 July, 2021: Travis' daughter Alabama catches the couple playing a duet of 'Heart and Soul' on the piano together and uploads a video of the sweet moment to her Story. She captions the clip: \"This is what I come home to 🥺.\"\n\nIn the video Kourtney and Travis, aka Kravis, look *so* loved up as they sit close together on the piano bench – each with a massive smile on their face.\n\nTravis later shared the video to his own Instagram feed, captioned: \"Album coming soon.\"\n\nSeriously! Just when we thought these two couldn't get ANY cuter.\n\n9 July, 2021:\n\nThe pair celebrate the ninth birthday of Kourt's daughter Penelope, and according to Kourtney's Insta Travis got her the most ridiculous bday present. The Blink 182 drummer gifted Penelope her very own personalised pink drum kit.\n\nKourtney even posted an adorable video of Travis teaching P how to play the drums, and we're all sorts of obsessed.\n\n10 July, 2021: If there's one celebrity couple who aren't afraid of a little (read: a lot) of public PDA, it's Kourtney and Travis.\n\nOn Saturday night they were spotted enjoying a major make out session at an Ultimate Fighting Championship match in Las Vegas. The official UFC Twitter account shared a video of them kissing in front of the crowd, along with the caption: \"The hottest ticket in town! @TravisBarker, @KourtneyKardash & @JustinBieber just some of the stars shining at #UFC264!\"\n\nIn the clip, the couple look playfully at the camera before smiling at each other and locking lips.\n\nWe wonder if they even watched the match or just, err, made out the whole time...\n\n21 July, 2021: Travis hints that he used to dream about Kourtney Kardashian in a post which she then shared on Instagram, which is pretty sweet. The Blink-182 drummer tweeted to his 1.5million followers, \"I dreamt what I’m living right now.\"\n\nKourtney then popped it on her Instagram stories:\n\n20 September, 2021: Halloween? One month early? We are totally here for it.\n\nThe latest instalment in Kourtney and Travis' love story sees the couple put on a show full of PDA while they enjoyed a Halloween event more than a month before spooky season arrives. The loved-up couple attended the annual Knott's Scary Farm event in California where they posed for some super cute snaps.\n\nThe event they attended in Cali is dubbed, \"the largest and most haunting Halloween event in Southern California, with unimaginable scares and innovative thrills that can’t be found anywhere else.\" So it's lucky they had each other to cuddle up to if they were feeling a little spooked.\n\nKourtney also posted a snap of the couple enjoying a log flume ride where she also tagged Travis' 17-year-old son Landon.\n\nAfter arriving home from the event, Kourtney posted the most adorable snaps to her Instagram stories that same day, where the couple could be seen wearing matching necklaces with each other's names on.\n\nPosting black and white photos to her social media page, Kourtney snapped a selfie where she could be seen wearing a beaded necklace that read Travis, while he wore one that spelled out Kourtney.\n\n16 October, 2021: Travis Barker appeared on America's hit TV show Saturday Night Live on 16 October. Yep, one week after Kim's iconic hosting stint.\n\nTravis performed on the show for the first time in more than 20 years, as he drummed for musical guest Young Thug, and of course his girlfriend Kourtney was there to support him. And you guessed it, there was plenty of PDA – as per.\n\nKourtney took to Instagram to post some PDA-packed snaps of her and Travis making out while she wore wore a blue leopard print sparkly corset-style top, teamed with some leather trousers. Travis was shirtless and wearing a red beanie. The pair looked insanely happy and loved up as she draped her body over his, as they sat on the sofa, backstage at SNL.\n\nIn the photos, Kourtney was holding some drumsticks as she mimicked using her boyfriend as a drum kit. Travis then commented on his girlfriend's post, \"You're the best drummer I know,\" to which Kourtney replied, \"I learned from the best.\" Travis then shared the photos to his Instagram account.\n\n18 October 2021: Omg! Travis and Kourtney are ENGAGED. The pair took to social media to reveal they are tying the knot after less than one year of dating. What a fairytale!\n\nOn her Instagram, Kourtney shared a photo of the pair as they kissed on the beach, surrounded by red roses and candles. She captioned the post: \"Forever @travisbarker.\" How romantic!?\n\n22 October, 2021: We all know just how much the Kardashian-Jenners love spooky season. It makes sense then, that to celebrate their first Halloween as an engaged couple, Kourtney and Travis went all out for their costumes.\n\nChanneling Travis' rockstar past, the duo dressed up as Sid Vicious and Nancy Spungen. Sex Pistols' bassist Sid and his gf Nancy were the poster children for all-things-edgy back in the 70s, and they dated up until October 1978 when she tragically died aged 20 of a stab wound. Sid was later arrested and charged with her murder, but died of a heroin overdose just four months later, before his case made it to trial.\n\nKourtney shared a series of photos to Insta, and captioned the post: \"Till death do us part.\" In response, Travis commented \"Our love will never dieeee.\"\n\n26 October 2021: Not content with already having 'You're so cool!' tattooed on in Kourtney's writing, as well as her actual name on his chest, loved up Travis just went a step further and got another inking dedicated to his fiancé. This time, the drummer opted for a scorpion on his upper, inner arm, along with an exact replica of Kourt's kiss mark.\n\nPosting a snap of it on Instagram, tattoo artist Scott Campbell said, \"Scorpio season. On @travisbarker… Lips straight from the mouth of @kourtneykardash. Congrats you two\".\n\nAdditional fun bonus fact? Jennifer Aniston liked Scott's post, meaning she's clearly as big a Kravis stan as the rest of us!\n\n14 November 2021: Kourtney Kardashian took to Instagram to share a sweet birthday message to her husband-to-be. Posting a series of seriously loved-up photos, the Poosh founder said: \"I f**king love you more than anything. My favourite everything. Happy birthday to you my baby!\"\n\nIn the comments section, Travis responded with an equally adorable message, telling his fiancé: \"You’re a dream come true, my soul mate, my everything. I LOVE YOU.\"\n\nOur hearts officially just melted.\n\n23 November 2021: It's no secret that Travis Barker and Kourtney Kardashian are the definition of loved-up. But, that doesn't seem to stop them from reminding the world just how in love they are. And, tbh, we're very here for it.\n\nTaking to Instagram to once again show off their love story, Travis told his 6.1 million followers that life with Kourtney is \"perfect.\" Sharing a series of photos from their family holiday in Cabo San Lucas in Mexico, he simply wrote: \"Perfect day.\"\n\nIn the carousel of holiday snaps, Travis and Kourtney cuddle up for a beachside embrace. Other photos show him spending some quality time with his kids, Alabama (15), Landon (18), and stepdaughter Atiana (22) — all of whom he shares with ex-wife Shanna Moakler.\n\nAs always, fans took to the comments section to share their appreciation for the couple. \"You look so cute together, can’t wait to see your wedding,\" wrote one fan, with another adding \"I love you two together.\"\n\n31 January 2022: It seems as though Kourtney and Travis are preparing for their wedding vows already – proving that they've nailed the whole \"til death do us part\" vibe.\n\nTaking to Instagram, Travis shared a photo of him and Kourtney sharing a kiss as they wear matching leather get-ups (very on brand). \"I Would Die 4 U\" he wrote in the caption, to which his fiancé responded: \"You, I would die for you\".\n\n14 March 2022: Kourtney and Travis are back at it again with the major PDA. While kissing and cuddling pics were a huge part of their early relationship, getting engagement and hitting the year-mark hasn't seemed to change that.\n\nTaking to Instagram to share a new kissing pic, Travis wrote, \"Laguna with you forever\" and Kourtney replied, \"Forever and always.\" We get it, you guys.\n\nErm, that's a pretty big statement if you ask us. The only thing we'd die for rn is an iced latte and the next series of Selling Sunset...\n\n3 April 2022: Another day, another PDA sesh – right, Kravis?\n\nProving they're still just as big on the PDA as ever before, Kourtney and Travis tied tongues at a Grammys afterparty, prompting onlookers to brand them: \"Madly in love\".\n\n\"Travis and Kourtney kept grabbing each other's faces and looked madly in love,\" a source (who spotted the pair at Las Vegas hotspot Delilah LV after the event) told E! Online. \"They were showing major PDA and were really cute.\"\n\nThe insider went on: \"They were seated at a table in the back and making out... They weren't holding back and were having a lot of fun.\" We'd expect nothing less, tbh.\n\nWhile there aren't any snaps from their afterparty PDA, this shot of them locking lips on the Grammys red carpet earlier in the evening leaves little to the imagination...\n\n7 April 2022: Kourtney has opened up about the connection she and Travis have always had and, yep, it sounds as if these two were made for each other.\n\nSpeaking during ABC News's 'The Kardashians' special, she told Good Morning America co-host Robin Roberts how she and Travis have always felt about each other, despite being friends for years before becoming a couple.\n\nShe explained, \"It’s so funny when we think about, like, this is us. Can you believe it? We’re, like, Kourtney and Travis, who are friends.\"\n\n\"I felt like deep down, if we looked into each other’s eyes and made it, you know, physical, that it would just be over,\" she continued.\n\n12 April 2022: In the new Kardashian-Jenner TV show, The Kardashians, Kourtney revealed she was \"definitely always attracted to Travis\" before touching on how they got together.\n\n\"It was the right time in my life,\" she said in the confessional. \"I had taken a year to myself, but my closest best friends always said, ‘You have to hook up with Travis’. Last year during the pandemic we were texting, so I just put it out there with flirtatious conversation.\"\n\nOn how she made the first move, Kourt added, \"Finally, once I made it known, he asked me to watch a movie. The whole movie he didn't make a move. He was taking a long time. The movie was over, we started another movie. I was like, ‘I don't have time for this movie marathon’. So, I made the first move.”\n\nThese two!\n\nApril 2022: Kourtney and Travis are married! The pair tied the knot in a Las Vegas courthouse wedding, for the first of three ceremonies. \"Found these in my camera roll,\" Kourt wrote in the caption.\n\n\"Once upon a time in a land far, far away (Las Vegas) at 2am, after an epic night and a little tequila, a queen and her handsome king ventured out to the only open chapel with an Elvis and got married (with no license). Practice makes perfect.\"\n\nMay 2022: The pair then had a ceremony in Santa Barbara, California, in front of a small guest list of people, back where Travis had proposed the October before. Congrats guys!\n\nJune 2022: To top it all off, the pair threw a big party in Portofino, Italy, where Kourtney wore a Dolce and Gabbana mini dress and a huge lace veil.\n\n7 June 2022: After three v glamorous weddings, it's about time that Kourtney and Travis settled into married life. And now, Kourtney has apparently opened up about exactly what that married life is like, with a source close to the star telling HollywoodLife that she is: \"Loving every second of playing wife.\"\n\nThe insider also revealed that she is \"telling everyone to call her Mrs. Barker\", adding that the happy couple \"cannot stop looking at photos from their wedding\".\n\nAnd their trio of weddings hasn't just cemented their own bond, but also the bond they have with their respective children. \"Marrying Travis has only strengthened the bond that she has with his children, and they were so happy to have been included in their wedding party,\" the source pointed out. \"She will care for his children the same way she does for hers.\"\n\n6th July 2022: Kourtney gives Travis *another* very personal tattoo. We know these two love to, well, show their love for one another in big ways (hello, all that PDA). And they're back again, as Kourtney has tattooed a new very personal bit of ink on Travis' arm.\n\nWe've previously seen pics of Kourtney actually tattooing the words \"I love you\" onto Travis' skin - and now she's done so again, inking a \"K\" and a love heart for her husband.\n\nKourt shared the latest update with fans via her Instagram Stories, posting a close up of Travis' arm and the new tattoo along with the caption, \"some of my finest work @travisbarker\". Take a look at the ink here:\n\nReckon we'll see Kourtney getting a \"T\" tat any time soon?\n\n21 July: Kourtney poked fun at herself over her *very* public displays of affection with husband Travis Barker, with a special personalised mug. \"Little Miss PDA,\" the picture, shared by her lifestyle brand @poosh said, and honestly it couldn't sum The Kardashians star up more. Although shouldn't it be Mrs?\n\n15th August 2022: Kourtney and Travis are still on the PDA train, this time sharing some truly loved up snaps from the studio. \"Time for drum practice,\" Kourtney wrote, alongside some pictures of her sat on his lap straddling his waist, while he's topless. Do we think the drumming is a euphemism or what?\n\n22 January, 2023: If you thought getting a tattoo dedicated to your partner was romantic, then think again. In fact, the bar is now set at four tattoos – yes, four! – thanks to Travis, who just got yet another inking for his wife.\n\n\"Oh hey there,\" Travis wrote in an Instagram post, which featured a photo of him and Kourtney on the first slide. In the third and fourth photos, Travis gave fans a peek at the new tattoo, which is quite clearly of his wife's eyes – although some fans argued in the comments section that the eyes look more like Kim Kardashian's.\n\nSwipe for tatt pics...\n\nAlthough Travis is no stranger to tattoos, this new inking joins at least three others that he has dedicated to Kourtney: a 'K' with a heart; the outline of Kourtney's lip print; and the words 'I love you', which she infamously tattooed on him."
