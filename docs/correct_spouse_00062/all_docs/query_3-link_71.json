        "text": "31 October 2023\n\nBy Chloe Kim , BBC News\n\nWhile speaking on a podcast the musician shared that their son will be named Rocky Thirteen Barker.\n\nThe Blink 182 drummer said the baby is due around \"Halloween or like, the first week of November\".\n\nThe two married in 2022 and both have children from previous relationships.\n\nBarker, 47, speaking on the One Life One Chance with Toby Morse podcast, said: \"There's a benefit for Hawaii that we were going to do, but it's the week that Rocky's due.\"\n\nThe host, Toby Morse said: \"Rocky Thirteen Barker.\"\n\n\"Rocky Thirteen Barker,\" repeated Barker.\n\nThere were already rumours that Barker and the reality star might name their first child together \"Rocky\".\n\nDuring the couple's Disney themed baby shower, fans zoomed in on decorations where guests could leave messages to the family. One partially read: \"May Baby Rocky have the most...life filled with love, happiness.\"\n\nBarker had also mentioned he liked the name while speaking to his teenage daughter, Alabama, during an interview with Complex.\n\nHe shared why he likes the name, saying \"Rocky George played guitar for Suicidal Tendencies, and 13 is just the greatest number of all time\".\n\nAlabama, who seemed less than impressed, replied: \"Let's see how this goes when he's at school.\"\n\nIn September, Kardashian, 44, thanked doctors for \"saving my baby's life\" after she was rushed into \"urgent foetal surgery\", in which surgeons operate on babies while they are still in the womb.\n\nShe has previously spoken about her struggles to conceive with Barker, but in June she posted an Instagram video showing her holding up a sign at a Blink-182 concert saying: \"Travis I'm pregnant.\""
