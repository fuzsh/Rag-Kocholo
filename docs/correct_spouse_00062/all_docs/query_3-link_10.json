        "text": "Travis Barker Facts To Know: Age, Children, Ex-Wife And Famous Songs\n\nHere’s everything you need to know about Kourtney Kardashian’s husband, Blink-182 drummer Travis Barker.\n\nTravis Barker is a rock music icon who also happens to be married to one of the most famous Kardashian sisters, Kourtney Kardashian.\n\nAway from the famous family, Travis is part of one of the biggest bands in the world Blink-182, but what do we know about his life away from music?\n\nRead more: Kourtney Kardashian’s Ex Boyfriends And Dating History: From Scott Disick To Travis Barker\n\nRead more: Why Kourtney Kardashian Won't Show Baby Rocky's Face Any Time Soon\n\nHere’s everything you need to know about Travis Barker.\n\nHow many kids does Travis Barker have?\n\nTravis has three biological children; daughter, Alabama Luella Barker who is 18 years old and son Landon Asher Barker, who is 20, with his ex-wife Shanna Moakler, and son Rocky, who was born in November 2023, with wife Kourtney.\n\nHe also has a former stepchild; Atiana De La Hoya from his previous marriage to Shanna Moajler. Atiana is 25 years old and Travis adorably treats her as his own daughter. Atiana's biological dad is former boxer Oscar De La Hoya.\n\nWho is Travis Barker’s ex-wife?\n\nTravis was married to American model and actress Shanna Moakler for four years but they split in 2008, keeping a good relationship for the sake of their kids.\n\nThe former couple starred in the MTV reality series Meet the Barkers from 2005 to 2008.\n\nWhich songs is Travis Barker known for?\n\nTravis is part of legendary rock band Blink-182, who have iconic songs like ‘All the Small Things’, ‘What’s My Age Again?’, ‘I Miss You’ and ‘Always’.\n\nHow many tattoos does Travis Barker have?\n\nHonestly? Too many to count. Travis has over 100 tattoos on his body, with over 70 per cent of his body covered in inkings each with a very special meaning.\n\nHe said in an interview he has so many tattoos as a way to tell the story of his life.\n\nThe drummer told GQ in an interview: “For me, it's documenting part of my life or people, things, times in my life. When I'm dead and gone, I want people to be able to look at my body and basically relive my life in some ways.”\n\nHow did Travis Barker and Kourtney get together?\n\nTravis and Kourtney were friends for around 15 years before they officially started dating, as they lived close to one another and their kids would play together.\n\nIn fact, he was a friend of the whole Kardashian family. Travis first met Kim in 2006 when she was an assistant to Paris Hilton, who Travis was dating at the time.\n\nHe later recalled to Us Weekly in 2015 that he’d encouraged Kim to start her own reality show after she expressed interest in the concept. And look at 'em now!\n\nIn January 2021 Kourtney and Travis were spotted together in Palm Springs, keeping the early stage of their relationship low-key as things blossomed beyond friendship. They made their relationship Instagram official a month later and got engaged in October that same year.\n\nIn May 2022 they got married in a luxurious ceremony in Portofino, Italy, an occasion hosted at Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana’s seaside villa, named L’Olivett."
