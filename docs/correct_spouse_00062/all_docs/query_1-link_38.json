        "text": "Shanna Moakler’s relationship with her children remains fractured as Travis Barker continues his very public relationship with Kourtney Kardashian.\n\nThe former model told Page Six that she and her two children with Barker, 17-year-old Landon and 15-year-old Alabama, still aren’t speaking after Alabama accused her last month of being an absentee parent — and that her ex’s romance could have something to do with it.\n\n“Sadly right now at this moment there’s still some distance. I’m just trying to give everybody some space,” Moakler, 46, told Page Six over the phone, saying the space is necessary “so we can heal and come back together again.”\n\nThe former Playboy Playmate, who just launched an OnlyFans account, told us she’s unsure her relationship with her kids can ever heal so long as the Blink-182 drummer continues to date the “Keeping Up With the Kardashians” star.\n\n“I don’t know. Right now I’m really just trying to let [my kids] all know that I’m here for them and I love them and I’m their mom and I’ll always want to be in their lives,” Moakler said. “All I can do is just sort of give it some time so we all can heal, but I don’t really know what’s going to happen in the future.\n\n“It’s been very difficult and emotional and sad.”\n\nBut Moakler said she genuinely wishes Barker and the Poosh founder happiness — so long as it doesn’t affect her bond with her children.\n\n“I want them all to have a great relationship. I don’t have animosity toward them. I’m not jealous of them,” Moakler told us. “I wish them really truly nothing but the best. I just don’t want them interfering with my children and I’s relationships.”\n\nMoakler and Barker were married from 2004 to 2008."
