        "text": "If we've learned anything about Blink-182 drummer Travis Barker over the years, it's that he loves tattoos and his kids. With their rock-star dad in the spotlight for much of their childhood, Travis's older kids, Landon and Alabama, and their stepsister, Atiana, haven't had the most conventional upbringing. And this month, Travis and wife Kourtney Kardashian Barker welcomed their first child together, expanding the family ever more.\n\nFor his part, Travis has made it known since the beginning that his family is his number-one priority. The musician even bought a home near their school when he and his ex-wife Shanna Moakler were separating, so the kids would have a home base. \"I bought a home that's very close to my children's school, so when she's with the kids, she's there; when I'm with the kids, I'm there. There's no making them travel back and forth to different houses,\" he explained to People back in 2017.\n\nWhether he's opening up about his love for his children on Twitter, saying, \"I love being a Dad more than anything, best thing to have ever happened in my entire life,\" posting sappy throwback photos on Instagram, or enjoying a nice family vacation, Travis is all about dad life â€” which is probably even busier now with the additions of stepchildren Mason, Penelope, and Reign, Kardashian Barker's kids from her relationship with Scott Disick. Certainly, things are even busier now with their new baby.\n\nOn top of that, we can't help but admire Travis's older kids' close bond, both as siblings and with their dad. During Travis's sudden hospitalization in the summer of 2022, his daughter Alabama was right by his side to support him, asking fans via her Instagram Story to send prayers, per Us Weekly. Atiana also thanked fans via her Instagram Story for their \"outpouring of love and prayers sent our way,\" adding, \"It is heard, felt, and appreciated.\"\n\nGet to know Travis's kids ahead."
