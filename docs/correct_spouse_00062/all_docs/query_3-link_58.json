        "text": "Travis Barker might have sent his new wife a gushing birthday tribute, but it's clear to see his ex Shanna Moakler isn't best impressed with the pair.\n\nThe former model, 48, took aim at the loved-up duo in a scathing new rant to Rachel Uchitel on the Miss Understood podcast.\n\nShanna spoke out about her early life, career and past relationships in the open discussion before letting rip on her now null and void connection with the Blink-182 drummer.\n\nShe blasted that she had been treated \"so unfairly\" by sections of the media when Trav and Kourtney Kardashian first got together and admitted it \"put a really bad taste in my mouth\" from the off.\n\nDiving deeper into the couple's relationship, Shanna confessed she \"wasn't a fan\".\n\n\"I don't even know Travis Barker anymore,\" she told the host. \"We haven't been together since almost 2010-12 and I don't even know him. I don't know what his favourite movie is, I don't know what his favourite food or colour is.\n\n\"We're not together [and] I have been in my own relationships.\"\n\nSavagely she continued: \"We only have our 17-year-old, who will be 18 this year, and then our work is done here and we never have to see or talk to each other ever again and I look forward to that day.\"\n\nAs the rant went on, Shanna branded her ex-hubby's current relationship with the reality TV star \"so f***ing weird\".\n\n\"I really don't have anything positive to say about it. It's not because I'm bitter and I'm definitely not jealous.\n\n\"I think things that have been said and things that have been done are absolutely disgusting.\"\n\nHowever, she stopped short of wishing them bad luck as she said as long as they're good to her kids that is all that matters.\n\nFormer Playboy model Shanna was married to the drummer between 2004 and 2008. They share two children together - Alabama, 17, and Landon, 19.\n\nThe kids have previously been complimentary in their words about their new step-mum and praised her relationship with their dad.\n\nTo mark Kourtney's birthday this week, Alabama took to Instagram to share a snap of her dad and his new wife.\n\nShe gushed over the \"best step mom I could ask for\" before thanking her for always putting family first.\n\nAlabama ended her message by saying: \"You have such a beautiful aura I wouldn't want another step mom.\"\n\n* Follow Mirror Celebs on Snapchat, Instagram, Twitter and Facebook."
