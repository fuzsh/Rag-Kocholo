        "text": "Travis Barker celebrated wife Kourtney Kardashian Barker‚Äôs 45th birthday on Thursday (April 18) by sharing some sweet (and one pretty salty) pics of his beloved, as well as one of the first glimpses of the couple‚Äôs adorable 5-month-old son, Rocky Thirteen Barker.\n\nThe Instagram pics included a rare image of the little guy, caught snuggling nose-to-nose with Kardashian in bed while wearing a striped onesie. And while we don‚Äôt see the baby‚Äôs face, the beaming look of love on Kardashian‚Äôs face says it all.\n\n‚ÄúHappy Birthday to my beautiful wife, soulmate and best friend forever,‚Äù Barker wrote. ‚ÄúI love you, I love our life together. Thank you for being the most amazing wife a person could ask for. Here‚Äôs to many more years of adventures together ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•‚Äù\n\nThe passel of pics opened with a shot of the couple canoodling on a boat in the ocean, kissing before boarding a private plane (with Barker swaddling Rocky in his arms), another of Kardashian standing on her bed in front of a series of white picture frames, as well as snaps of her fully asleep mid crossword puzzle, a pantsless pic of KK opening a gift, a few throwback shots of Kourtney smiling and sticking out her tongue and a final shot of her on the toilet.\n\nBarker and Blink-182 just finished a run of dates in Australia/New Zealand and a run of festivals in South America. After a few months off they will kick off the North American run of their tour, slated to open on June 20 at the Kia Center in Orlando. That run of gigs will keep them on the road through an August 15 show at Rogers Center in Toronto before it moves to Europe for a run of festival and arena dates.\n\nCheck out Barker‚Äôs post below."
