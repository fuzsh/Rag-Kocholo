        "text": "Shanna Moakler has recently spoken up about having no relationship with former husband Travis Barker.\n\nIn a new interview with PEOPLE, Shanna said, “We don't speak anymore.”\n\nShe told the outlet, “I think that's okay. I don't feel like it'll be like that forever, but I feel like right now.”\n\n“I think that's where we are at in our evolution, and maybe in the future, it'll change,” remarked the mom-of-three, who co-parents with Travis.\n\nReflecting on her relationship with Travis, Shanna remarked, “Honestly, I just don't care about my exes at the moment.”\n\n“I don't care about Oscar or Travis,” said the 49-year-old.\n\nThe blonde beauty mentioned, “I know I'm talking about it here with you — and I really can't do anything without talking about it — because it's just kind of stuck with me, which is fine.”\n\nShanna noted, “They were both propelled to fame, and I was with them both at the height of their careers. They both were very poor.”\n\n“They both yearn for power, money and fame, and they are similar in that way,” she dished.\n\nElsewhere in the interview, Shanna discussed about her exes, saying, “I don't think anyone has a clue about who I am.”\n\n“I'm more than just the ex-wife of famous men. I was Miss USA at 19. I'm smart,” she further said.\n\nShanna added, “Every part I've ever got in any movie, or every show I hosted or auditioned for, I worked hard to get it.”"
