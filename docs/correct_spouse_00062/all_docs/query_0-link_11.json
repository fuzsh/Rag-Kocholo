All three of their kids are super close to Travis.\n\nWhile Travis and Shanna were together, they starred in the MTV reality series, Meet The Barkers, which chronicled the highs and lows of their relationship. The pair briefly rekindled their romance in 2009, though split for good shortly after.\n\nToday, as you might be aware, Travis is married to Kourtney Kardashian, whom he’d been close friends and neighbors with for years before they tied the knot in May 2022. Kourtney has three kids of her own: Mason, Penelope, and Reign, all of whom now live as a blended family with her, Travis, and his children.\n\nHowever, Shanna has repeatedly been vocal about her dislike of Kourt’s relationship with her kids.\n\nIn May 2021, Shanna claimed that Kourtney had “put a wedge” in her relationship with her kids, and said that her family was “broken” because of the Kardashians.\n\n“My family’s broken because of this family, and now my kids are alienated from each other because of another sister in this family,” she told TMZ.\n\n“I don't care about Travis and Kourtney in any capacity whatsoever,” she continued. “All I care about are my children — mending and healing my relationship with my children and moving forward. I don't even think twice about them.”\n\nMeanwhile, Shanna has previously shut down Alabama and Landon's claims that she's an \"absent parent\" who has never \"completely been\" in their lives.\n\nMore recently, Shanna shaded her kids’ close relationship with Kourt after her and Travis’s wedding special, ‘Til Death Do Us Part, aired on Hulu.\n\nThe episode gave viewers a close look into Landon, Alabama, and Atiana’s presence at the lavish ceremony, with Landon memorably praising Kourtney for filling “the empty spot” in his heart and looking out for him “like a mother” in a heartwarming speech delivered at the reception.\n\n“Since the day I met you, you have had such a great and bright personality that always showed and shined,” he said. “You look out for me like a mother and always have had my back… I really think you have filled the empty spot in my heart so well and have shown me great morals that have taught me so much.”\n\nOnce the wedding special aired, Shanna heavily suggested that she wasn’t pleased with Landon’s comment, responding to a fan who said she was deserving of an “apology” with a shady remark about Kourtney: “she posts more of my kids then [sic] her own lol.”\n\nAround the same time, Shanna described Kourtney and Travis’s marriage as “really weird.”\n\n“I wish them nothing but the best, and as long as they're good to my kids, that’s all I care about, but I think the whole thing is really weird,” she said, before adding that while she wasn’t “bitter or jealous,” she didn’t have “anything positive to say” about the relationship.\n\nNow, Shanna has publicly commented on her feelings toward Kourtney and her sisters once again.\n\nSpeaking with Page Six this week, Shanna noted that she has her “own personal reasons” for disliking the Kardashians, though added that she simply cares that they’re “good” to her kids.\n\n“I have my own personal reasons for not liking the Kardashians, which I won’t get into,” she said. “But as long as [Travis is] happy [and] as long as they are good to my kids, that’s all I care about.”\n\nGoing on to speak about Travis a little more closely, Shanna said, “I haven’t been with him for well over a decade… But you know what — he’s not mine.”\n\nAnd Shanna went on to say that Travis is a “completely different” person now from who he was when they were together. “He’s not the person that I was with anymore. He’s a completely different human being, so I don’t even really know him as a man right now,” she said.\n\n“I don’t even know if we would be compatible or even good for one another anymore because he’s not the person that he was on Meet The Barkers,” she added."
