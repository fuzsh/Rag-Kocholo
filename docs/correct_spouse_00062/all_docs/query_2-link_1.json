        "text": "Travis Barker and Shanna Moakler’s relationship has been plagued with custody battles, cheating accusations and more.\n\nThe former spouses originally called it quits in 2006 after two years of marriage and the arrival of son Landon and daughter Alabama. For the next two years, however, they continued an on-and-off relationship before finalizing their divorce in 2008.\n\nAccording to court documents obtained by Us Weekly in May 2021, their custody battle got messy in 2014.\n\n“Please keep your drug addict girlfriends away from my kids. All kids from divorced families go through a transition period, I should have never allowed this from when we were separated …” Moakler texted Barker at the time, per the court docs.\n\nBarker replied that he “hate[s]” his ex and said he had “nothing nice” to say to her. He also called her a “f–king call girl.”\n\nHe further alleged that Moakler was an absent parent to their kids. “I am a very involved parent,” he wrote. “Not only do I regularly take our children to and from school, tutoring, doctors’ appointments and extracurricular events, but I also see that they do their homework, cook them meals, play with them, plan all of their birthday parties and select all of their activities. I purchased another home in Cheviot Hills so that we could be closer to their school. I have concerns about our children’s safety and well-being when in Shanna’s home.”\n\nScroll through for Barker and Moakler’s relationship timeline:"
