        "text": "If you've been on social media lately, you've probably seen Kourtney Kardashian and Travis Barker’s almost daily Instagram posts. I mean, they’re hard to miss and they’re so hot, I almost burned myself liking one of their pictures the other day. The relationship between the longtime friends turned lovers culminated in a Vegas wedding, courthouse ceremony, and most recently, a lavish seaside ceremony overlooking the Italian Riviera. That's right, they married (for the third time) on May 22, 2022. But, of course, nuptials aren’t where this story ends. We’ve got a complete timeline of Kourtney and Travis’s relationship, so you don’t miss one steamy detail, from how they started dating, to red carpet pics and tales of their engagement.\n\nJuly 19. 2023: Travis Reveals What He Wants to Name His Son with Kourtney\n\nTravis already has names picked out for his son with Kourtney Kardashian. The rocker appeared on Complex's GOAT Talk with his daughter, Alabama Barker, where they discussed possible baby names. \"I like Rocky 13,\" he said. \"That's so bad,\" his daughter replied. The proud father-to-be agreed that the name is \"bad\" and that it's been \"going through [his] head lately.\"\n\nIn case you were wondering where the inspo for the baby's name came from, Travis explained, \"Rocky George played guitar for Suicidal Tendencies. And 13 is just the greatest number of all time.\" The Blink-182 star also gushed about a classic film that inspired the baby's name as well. \"And Rocky, the greatest boxing movie of all time,\" he said.\n\nJuly 14, 2023: Kourtney Says She's Protecting Her Energy with Her Husband Amid Family Turmoil\n\nThere's no denying that there's major drama going down between Kourtney and her sister Kim. As the turmoil continues to mount, the oldest Kardashian sibling revealed that she's seeking refuge in her hubby Travis. In a preview for the next episode of Hulu's The Kardashian, Kourt said, \"With my family, I'm like 'protect my energy.'\" The expectant mother added, \"And like, 'I'm married! Bye everyone,\" before ending with, \"It's so nice.\"\n\nJuly 12, 2023: Travis Celebrates 30th Flight Since His 2008 Plane Crash, Thanks “Amazing Wife” Kourtney\n\nKourt is there for Travis. ❤️ As the couple prepares for the arrival of their baby boy with some rest and relaxation in Hawaii, Travis took to Threads to celebrate his 30th flight and praise Kourtney for her “healing love” as he overcomes his fear of flying. “Just flew for the 30th time since my plane crash. Wouldn’t be able to tour or enjoy life again the way I do without the healing love of my amazing wife,” the Blink-182 drummer wrote. “I love you @kourtneykardash.”\n\nIn 2008, Travis was one of two survivors after a plane carrying himself, his security guard, Charles “Che” Still, his assistant, Chris Baker, and his friend, Adam “DJ Adam” Goldstein, crashed during take-off at a South Carolina airport. Travis refused to fly until August 2021, when he took his first flight in 13 years with his then-girlfriend (now-wife) Kourtney.\n\nOn her own Instagram Story, the reality star re-posted Travis’s Threads post, adding, “so proud of my husband.”\n\nJune 25, 2023: Kourtney and Travis Host Rock N Roll Themed-Gender Reveal\n\nIt's official. Kourtney and Travis revealed they were expecting a baby boy during a rock 'n roll themed-gender reveal that the Poosh founder shared on Instagram. Kourt sat on her hubby's lap as the Blink-182 drummer played a drumroll and kissed his wife. As soon as Travis struck the drum's symbols, blue streamers shot into the air, confirming that their first child together will be a boy.\n\nJune 22, 2023: Kourtney Shares an Update on Her Growing Baby Bump\n\nIt’s been nearly one week since Kourtney announced that she’s pregnant with her and Travis’s first baby, and tbh, we’re still emotional over the news. 🥲 On Wednesday, the reality star took to Instagram to show off her growing baby bump and, dressed in a mini dress, oversized bomber jacket, and knee-length leather boots, prove that her pregnancy style is perfection.\n\nJune 18, 2023: Kourtney Is Pregnant and “Overwhelmed With Gratitude”\n\nICYMI, Kourtney and Travis are expecting their first child together and we couldn’t be happier for the rock-star couple. ❤️ Kourt made her pregnancy announcement at Travis’s Blink-182 concert in Los Angeles on June 16 (where she held up a sign that read, “Travis I’m pregnant, an epic reference to a Blink-182 music video), and two days later, debuted her growing baby bump on the ’gram.\n\n“Overwhelmed with gratitude and joy for God’s blessing and plan,” she wrote alongside a carousel of photos of her and Trav. BRB, crying.\n\nApril 18, 2023: Travis Gives Kourt a $$$ Birthday Gift\n\nKourtney just rang in her 44th birthday, and in a carousel of pics on Instagram, the reality star shared some of the highlights from her special day — including the verrrry expensive gift from her hubby.\n\nAccording to E! News, Trav gifted Kourt a drawing by artist Yoshitomo Nara, which was exhibited at the Santa Monica Museum of Art back in 2000. As for the price tag? Luxury auction house Sotheby’s reports that the art piece sold for approximately (wait for it...) $161,819. 🤑 “Feeling so overwhelmed with gratitude for all of the birthday love and wishes,” Kourtney captioned her post. “Turning 44 was a dream.”\n\nApril 18, 2023: Travis Calls Kourtney His \"Soulmate\"\n\nTravis posted the sweetest series of photos for Kourtney's 44th birthday, along with a sincere message about his love for her. The PDA-packed carousel featured photos of the two of them cuddling in bed, making out in public, and staring deeply into each others eyes. Honestly, we'd expect nothing less from them!\n\n\"My soulmate. I’m so grateful that today you were born. You deserve everything your heart desires,\" he wrote. \"Nothing makes me happier than seeing you smile. You stole my heart the moment we met. Happy birthday to the most beautiful amazing woman to walk the face of the earth. I love you my wife ❤️\".\n\n\"I’m crying because you make me so happy. I love you my husband 🥹❤️,\" Kourtney responded in the comments. Awwwwww.\n\nApril 14, 2023: Kourt Praises Trav's Coachella Performance\n\nKendall Jenner isn't the only KarJenner sister who hit the Coachella festival in support of her SO this year.

So there's a few.\"\n\nDecember 10, 2022: Kourtney Shares an IVF Update\n\nKourtney and Travis began their journey to have a child through in vitro fertilization back in 2021, and the couple hasn't been shy about sharing the nitty-gritty details of their struggles on The Kardashians. \"The medication they've been giving me [...] put me into menopause,\" she revealed. \"The medication put me into depression.\"\n\nKourtney also explained that the IVF treatments changed her body, with her fluctuating weight sparking pregnancy rumors amidst her and Travis's difficulty with getting pregnant.

I would say it’s probably one of the more difficult things in my life.\"\n\nAlthough he's struggling to find his place in the family, Scott explained that he will always do what's best for Kourt and their three children, Mason, Penelope, and Reign. \"At the end of the day, I understand what the bigger picture is, what would be best for Kourtney and she's happy,\" he said. \"She's in a real thing and I believe that's true 'cause I also felt like I did so much wrong to her over so many years that I felt super guilty.
