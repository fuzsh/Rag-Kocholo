        "text": "It's been just over a year since the wedding that broke the internet, yes we're talking about Travis Barker and Kourtney Kardashian saying I Do.\n\nIn what was a three-event affair, the pair tied the knot in a 'practice' ceremony in Las Vegas complete with an Elvis impersonator, as well as having a quiet church wedding, and a big, in-your-face Dolce & Gabanna event in Italy with the whole Kardashian-Jenner brood.\n\nToday's top videos\n\nNow, a year on, Travis Barker's ex-wife Playboy model Shanna Moakler who was married to Travis from 2004 to 2006, has spoken her mind about the couple and their whirlwind romance, saying that it's 'so f**king weird'.\n\nWe're not sure whether Shanna is referencing the fact that Kourtney spoke publically about drinking her husband's semen for fertility purposes, all of the inappropriate shifting on the latest two series of The Kardashians, or all of the above, but regardless, she seems to want to distance herself from the couple.\n\nAiring out her feelings about the PDA-proud newlyweds on the Miss Understood podcast with Rachel Uchitel, Shanna didn't hold back, saying 'I don't even know Travis Barker anymore' and continuing by explaining that she doesn't want to know him anymore.\n\nIn one of the bluntest references to an ex that we have ever heard, Shanna said: 'We only have our 17-year-old, who will be 18 this year, and then our work is done here and we never have to see or talk to each other ever again and I look forward to that day'. Ouch!\n\nBut that's not all - Shanna didn't mince her words when she talked about the massively famous couple's 'disgusting' antics. She said: 'I really don't have anything positive to say about it'.\n\nShe even went as far as to call the relationship 'so f**king weird' but insisted that so long as they treat her children well, that's all that truly matters to her.\n\nShe said: 'I really don't have anything positive to say about it. It's not because I'm bitter and I'm definitely not jealous. I think things that have been said and things that have been done are absolutely disgusting.\n\n'I wish them nothing but the best and as long as they're good to my kids, that's all I care about. But I think the whole thing is really weird.'\n\nTravis and Shanna share two children together, Alabama, 17, and Landon, 19."
