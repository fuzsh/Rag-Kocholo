        "text": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanna_Moakler\n\nShanna Lynn Moakler (born March 28, 1975) is an American model, actress, and reality television star. She was the winner of the Miss New York USA pageant in 1995 and was the first runner-up at Miss USA 1995. After winner Chelsi Smith won the Miss Universe 1995 pageant, Moakler succeeded her as Miss USA. Moakler began modeling at age 15 and was later chosen as a Playmate of the Month for Playboy magazine in December 2001.\n\nMoakler eventually branched out into an acting career, appearing as a regular for two seasons on the USA Network television series Pacific Blue in 1998, and in 2005 she starred as herself on the reality television series Meet the Barkers with her then-husband Travis Barker, drummer in the rock band Blink-182. The series aired for two seasons on MTV. She hosted E!'s Bridalplasty during its two-month run in 2010/2011. In January 2014, it was announced that Moakler had joined the cast of the VH1 reality series, Hollywood Exes.\n\nMoakler's private life has been much discussed in the media, including her relationship with rock singer Billy Idol, as well as her relationships with Olympic champion boxer Oscar De La Hoya and Hollywood actor Dennis Quaid.\n\nMoakler has served as the executive producer of the Miss Nevada USA state pageant since 2012, after joining as a director in 2011, and acquired the Miss Utah USA franchise in 2018."
