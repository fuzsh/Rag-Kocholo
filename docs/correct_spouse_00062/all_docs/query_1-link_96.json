        "text": "Moakler and the Blink-182 drummer first met in 2002, Elite Daily reported. The pair had a Disney-themed wedding in 2004, then divorced in 2008, but reportedly continued to live together to raise their kids until about 2016.\n\nBarker and Moakler have two children together, Landon and Alabama Barker, and the musician remains close to his former stepdaughter, Moakler's daughter Atiana De La Hoya, whose biological father is former professional boxer Oscar De La Hoya.\n\nMoakler told Insider that making their kids a priority and putting them first \"has always been the one thing\" that she and Barker \"do agree on.\"\n\nAs of now, she told Insider she's open to talking to Barker \"maybe down the road in the future.\"\n\nThe model, who once starred in a reality show with her ex called \"Meet the Barkers,\" has had a complicated relationship with the Kardashian family long before Barker got engaged to Kourtney.\n\nIn 2008, E! News reported that Kim Kardashian told Ryan Seacrest that she had a \"little altercation\" with Moakler on Seacrest's KIIS-FM show. \"Shanna came over and kind of just said a few things and threw a drink,\" Kim said, per E! News. \"I was just a little bit caught off guard. It kind of hit my leg.\"\n\nKim said at the time that she thought Moakler was reacting to rumors that Kim was dating Barker, though she was unclear why the drink was thrown.\n\nMoakler couldn't escape the Kardashian family inside the \"Celebrity Big Brother\" house. Lamar Odom, the ex-husband of Khloé Kardashian, was another contestant this season. Moakler told Insider that Odom, who's still in the game, talked about how \"he would love to marry\" Khloé again, which she described as \"very sweet.\"\n\nRelated stories\n\nShe said Odom was \"aware\" that his ex's sister Kourtney is now engaged to Moakler's ex-husband. \"But we didn't really talk too much about the Kardashian family,\" she added.\n\n\"Celebrity Big Brother\" airs its next episode on Friday, February 18 at 8 p.m. ET on CBS."
