He also has son Rocky Thirteen with wife Kourtney Kardashian.\n\nHe also has a former stepchild; Atiana De La Hoya from his previous marriage. Atiana is 25 years old and he treats her as his own daughter. Atiana's biological dad is former boxer Oscar De La Hoya.\n\nThe star has walked the red carpet with his kids on multiple occasions and is a seriously incredible dad, often taking to Instagram to shout out how much he loves them!\n\nWe can see why Kourtney fell for this guy.\n\nDo Travis Barker's children know Kourtney Kardashian's kids?\n\nFortunately for Travis and Kourtney's blossoming romance, things are made a whole lot easier by the fact their children not only know each other already, but are close and have grown up in each other's lives.\n\nThis is due to the fact they have been mansion neighbours in the same gated community since 2017.\n\nTravis has popped up on Keeping Up With The Kardashians before as they were often at one another's houses during their 15 years of friendship before it turned into something more!\n\nIn one episode, Kourtney says: \"Our neighbour and friend, Travis Barker, decided to come over because his kids and my kids are really good friends.\""
