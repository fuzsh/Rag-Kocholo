        "text": "Shanna Moakler is claiming that her ex-husband, Travis Barker, planned a sexual rendezvous with Kim Kardashian.\n\nThe ex reality star explained that an anonymous person texted her alleged conversations between the Blink-182 drummer and the sister of his current wife, on Wednesday’s episode of her podcast, “Dumb Blonde.”\n\n“They were trying to meet up at her sister’s house to f–k,” the “Meet the Barkers” alum claimed the messages revealed.\n\n“I wanted this relationship to work. I was so in love with him,” she said.\n\nShe added that she showed Barker the messages, which he swiftly “deleted.”\n\nMoakler, 48, claimed — “[He] said, ‘I don’t see anything.’”\n\nShe also claimed that she called Kardashian, 43, to confront her over the messages.\n\n“She just said to me, ‘I don’t like white guys,’” Moakler recalled. “I was like, ‘You’ll f–k anyone to be famous.’ … Travis and I never really recovered from that. I felt stupid.”\n\nMoakler and Barker share two children together, Landon, 20, and Alabama, 18. The former reality TV duo split in 2008. Moakler also shares a 24-year-old daughter, Atiana, with ex, Oscar De La Hoya.\n\nThe rock star has denied all affair allegations involving the “Kardashians” personality multiple times.\n\nBarker told the Los Angeles Times — “You give people a little information and they think they’ve solved the mystery of ‘this is why they’re fighting.’ It’s just so ridiculous.”\n\nHe added — “It’s like, ‘Kourtney’s fans are worried about Travis. He’s a womanizer.’ Stop it.”\n\nKim Kardashian labeled the rumors a “false narrative.”\n\nThe rocker recently welcomed a son, Rocky, with his wife, Kourtney Kardashian.\n\nMoakler called the Kardashian family “disgusting,” adding that she “removed herself” from the clan so “they couldn’t bond with my children over hating me.”\n\n“Go do what you guys need to do and when you’re ready, I will be here loving you unconditionally,” the former Miss New York said about her kids. “And I will be here as your mother, and I will wait. And that’s what I did.”\n\nMoakler alleged that Barker alienated her from her children and allowed them to become “enamored” by the affluence of the musician and his famous wife. She noted that she cannot afford the same luxuries.\n\n“They’re buying them Prada, and they’re buying them gifts, and they’re going to these events and they’re meeting Kanye [West] and, you know, all this big stuff,” she said."
