        "text": "Shanna Moakler has nothing but kind words for her ex-husband and his new girlfriend.\n\nMoakler, 45, told a paparazzo outside LAX that she’s “happy” for Travis Barker and Kourtney Kardashian.\n\n“He’s my friend and co-parent, and I want him to be happy,” she said, “and if being with her makes him happy, and she’s happy, I’m happy for both of them, honestly.”\n\nShe added of the Blink-182 rocker, “He can handle that Kardashian drama.”\n\nThe model-actress was also photographed packing on the PDA with 28-year-old boyfriend Matthew Rondeau when she picked him up from LAX on Thursday. Moakler wore a huge rock on her left ring finger, but a source confirms to Page Six they’re not engaged.\n\nOur insider also explained that Moakler and Rondeau have an on-again, off-again relationship, but she said in the video that they’re currently “doing great.”\n\nA rep for Moakler didn’t immediately return Page Six’s request for comment.\n\nMoakler married Barker in 2004, but they finalized their divorce four years later. They have two kids: 17-year-old son Landon and 15-year-old daughter Alabama.\n\nBarker recently moved on with longtime pal Kardashian, which some thought irked Moakler, as she reportedly “liked” a comment that shaded his new relationship with the E! reality star. She clarified that it was just “in jest.”"
