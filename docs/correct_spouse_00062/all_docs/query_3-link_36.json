        "text": "Kourtney Kardashian and Travis Barker may have gotten married just over a year after they officially started dating, but their love for each other actually began long ago.\n\nPrior to things turning romantic, Kardashian and Barker built a friendship while they were neighbors for years in their respective Hidden Hills, Calif., homes.\n\nThe Blink-182 rocker even opened up about their friendship in 2019 after rumors swirled that they were romantically linked.\n\n“Kourtney’s like a dear friend. That’s it,” Barker told E! News at the iHeartRadio Music Awards that year. “I mean, I love her to death. I love her family to death. But yeah, just friends.”\n\nNeedless to say, a lot has changed since then. The two have proven that the sparks are now hot and heavy, flaunting their love for all to see, getting engaged and having three weddings (one of which ended up not being legal).\n\nThey also had a baby together after previously welcoming children with their exes Scott Disick and Shanna Moakler, respectively.\n\nFrom where it all began to what their future holds, Page Six is breaking down Kardashian and Barker’s full relationship timeline.\n\nRumors swirl\n\nKardashian and Barker were close pals and neighbors for years, so it was no surprise that they sparked speculation that they were more than just friends.\n\nIn 2018, the Poosh founder and the Grammy nominee were spotted all over town together, leading some to believe that they were dating.\n\nThey were reportedly seen leaving the same vegan restaurant, attending a church service and grabbing dinner with Kardashian’s ex-bestie Larsa Pippen.\n\nTheir joint outings trickled into the next year as they were spotted hitting the town together in Malibu in February 2019.\n\nIt’s official\n\nNews of Kardashian’s relationship with Barker broke in January 2021.\n\nTheir relationship was confirmed after the pair were spotted hanging out together at Kris Jenner’s Palm Springs, Calif., vacation home.\n\nA day of love\n\nTheir relationship appeared to be getting more serious when Kardashian and Barker spent Valentine’s Day together in February 2021.\n\nThey both hinted that they were celebrating the romantic occasion by posting a photo of the same fireplace to their respective social media accounts.\n\nKourt also shared a sweet poem hinting at their romance which read, “Roses are red / Violets are blue / Garlic bread / Blink-182.” She also posted a photo of a diamond ankle bracelet that was apparently a gift from the rocker.\n\nSocial media secured\n\nShortly after Valentine’s Day, the “Keeping Up With the Kardashians” star went Instagram-official with Barker.\n\nShe posted a picture of herself holding hands with the rock star while they were seated next to each other in a car. No caption was necessary.\n\nOf course, with social media comes great responsibility. Following their public Instagram debut, Barker’s ex-wife Shanna Moakler stirred the pot by “liking” a shady comment about Kardashian in which a fan wrote, “Travis downgraded big time.” She backtracked, however, saying that she mistakingly “liked” the post.\n\nPDA begins\n\nBarker and Kardashian began going on several public outings together in March 2021, and they weren’t shy about flaunting their emotional and physical attraction toward each other.\n\nBarker shared that he received an “I Love You” note from Kardashian, and he proved his deep feelings for her again when he was seen sucking her finger in public.\n\nFrom there, the couple began their love tour, with Kardashian confirming that the drummer was her boyfriend in a TikTok video.\n\nFamilies combine\n\nAt first, it appeared Kardashian and Barker were keeping their hangouts between the two of them, but as things became more serious, they gradually introduced their children to the mix.\n\nIn April 2021, Barker joined Kardashian’s family for Easter. One month later, Barker and his kids, Landon and Alabama, joined Kardashian’s children, Mason, Penelope, and Reign, on a trip to Disneyland.\n\nIn July 2021, Barker gifted Penelope a drum set, while Alabama called Kardashian her “stepmom.”\n\nForever love\n\nThe couple also made their love for each other permanent by getting some ink done.\n\nIn April 2021, Barker had Kardashian’s name tattooed on his chest, and a month prior, he showed off a tat of the words “You’re so cool” that fans speculated was an homage to his girlfriend.\n\nIn May of that year, Kardashian tattooed “I love you” onto Barker’s arm.\n\nA fearsome friendship forms\n\nIn true couple form, Kardashian and Barker found another hot Hollywood couple to hang out with.\n\nThe pair went on a double date with Machine Gun Kelly and Megan Fox for the “Bloody Valentine” singer’s 31st birthday in April 2021. This followed the foursome’s gathering at the UFC 260 fight the previous month.\n\nBut the new friends really made a splash when Kardashian and Fox introduced their respective lovers during the 2021 MTV Video Music Awards, where the “Transformers” actress referred to the men as their “future baby daddies.” They’ve went on plenty of other double dates since then.\n\nPDA prompts ex drama\n\nKardashian and Barker continued to show off their intimacy to the world, from the musician braiding her hair to Kardashian cozying up to her man.\n\nBut things hit the fan when the reality star was seen straddling Barker while on a boat on vacation in Italy.\n\nKardashian’s ex-partner Scott Disick, with whom she shares her three children, was put on blast by another one of her exes, Younes Bendjima, when Disick slammed Barker and Kardashian’s PDA.\n\n“Yo is this chick ok!???? Broooo like what is this. In the middle of Italy,” Disick wrote in a private message to Bendjima on Instagram. Bendjima then responded with class, writing back, “Doesn’t matter to me as long as she’s happy. PS: i aint your bro.”\n\nDisick later gave the couple his blessing, however, saying he also just wanted Kardashian to be happy.\n\nDisick and Bendjima weren’t the only exes to come out of the woodwork. Moakler, who is the mother of Barker’s two children, admitted that she thought their PDA was “weird.”\n\nAnd the shade didn’t stop there. Moakler accused Kardashian’s family of ruining her own, alleging that Kim Kardashian had an affair with Barker years ago. Kim vehemently denied the claims.\n\nLove is in the air\n\nBarker shared in August 2021 that because of Kardashian, he was able to overcome his fear of flying following his near-fatal plane crash in 2008.\n\nBarker flew on a plane for the first time a crash in West Columbia, South Carolina, following a show he performed at. The accident claimed the lives of two pilots as well as Barker’s assistant and security guard. Barker luckily survived with severe burns.\n\nHe later said he felt “invincible” after overcoming his fear of flying with Kardashian.\n\nRed carpet romance\n\nKardashian and Barker made their red carpet debut as a couple at the MTV Video Music Awards in September 2021.\n\nShe wore a sexy leather dress for the occasion, while he rocked an edgy black getup complete with silver spikes.\n\nSaturday Night Love\n\nKardashian and Barker hit up the Big Apple together for the drummer’s appearance on “Saturday Night Live” in October 2021.\n\nKardashian posted photos where she was all over her man backstage at the time, getting flirty on a couch.\n\nThey were then spotted walking all around Soho together, both dressed in all leather as they made the rounds in Manhattan.\n\nPopping the question\n\nShortly after their New York City adventures, the couple flew back to California.\n\nThey reemerged on a beach in Montecito on Oct. 17, 2021, where Barker proposed to Kardashian surrounded by hundreds of roses and candles in the shape of a heart.\n\nKardashian confirmed the news by posting two pictures from the proposal on her Instagram.\n\n“forever,” she captioned her post.\n\nKardashian’s massive engagement ring from Barker is estimated to be worth $1 million. Barker reportedly had a major role in the design of the sparkler.\n\nThis is Kardashian’s first marriage. Barker was married to Moakler from 2004 to 2008 and Melissa Kennedy from 2001 to 2002.\n\nGetting hitched\n\nKardashian and Barker officially tied the knot at a courthouse in Santa Barbara, Calif., on May 15, 2022, nearly a month after they got fake-married in Las Vegas with an Elvis impersonator.\n\nA week after they legally wed, they celebrated their marriage in front of friends and family with an extravagant ceremony and reception in Portofino, Italy, on May 22.\n\nThe Hulu personality wore a short white satin corset Dolce & Gabbana wedding dress with a long veil for the nuptials and changed into a black number for the reception.\n\nMeanwhile, Barker went a more traditional route in a black suit by Dolce & Gabbana featuring a double-breasted jacket with peaked lapels.\n\nBarker, who has been no stranger to showing PDA with Kardashian, removed his wife’s garter with his teeth during the celebration attended by Kim and Khloé Kardashian, Kendall and Kylie Jenner, Fox and Kelly, and the newlyweds’ combined kids.\n\nExpanding their family\n\nBarker and Kardashian were open about their desire to expand their family throughout their romance.\n\nThe pair struggled to conceive naturally and turned to fertility treatments — including some that were unconventional — to have a baby together.\n\nThe Poosh founder announced in the “Kardashians” Season 3 premiere that she and the rock star were “officially done with IVF,” explaining that they would leave conception up to fate.\n\n“We would love a baby more than anything, but I just really believe in what God has in store for us,” she said. “If that’s a baby, then I believe that it will happen.”\n\nLess than one month later, in June 2023, Kardashian attended Barker’s Blink-182 concert in LA holding a very telling sign — “TRAVIS I’M PREGNANT.”\n\nTragedy nearly struck in September 2023 when Kardashian had to undergo emergency fetal surgery to save her unborn baby boy’s life.\n\n“I am eternally grateful to my husband who rushed to my side from tour to be with me in the hospital and take care of me afterwards, my rock,” the reality star wrote on Instagram at the time.\n\n“And to my mom, thank you for holding my hand through this.”\n\nFortunately, Kardashian was healthy enough to have a Disney-themed baby shower less than one month after her medical emergency.\n\nWelcoming baby Barker\n\nKardashian gave birth to the couple’s first child together, a son named Rocky, in November 2023.\n\nFans first got wind of the birth when Kardashian’s youngest sister, Kylie Jenner, and husband were spotted arriving to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles.\n\n“Kourtney is over the moon about her son’s arrival,” a source told People shortly after the infant made his way into the world, adding that the Lemme founder “feels so blessed” to have a healthy baby following a “stressful” pregnancy.\n\n“She is happy to just be able to snuggle her baby boy now,” the insider noted."
