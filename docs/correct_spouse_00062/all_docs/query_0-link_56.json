        "text": "Travis Barker's ex-wife Shanna Moakler has revealed what she thinks about Kourtney Kardashian 's baby news.\n\nThe 48-year-old American model was married to Travis for four years from 2004 until 2008 and they share two children, Landon, 19, and Alabama, 17.\n\nShortly after Kourtney revealed her pregnancy to the world at a Blink 182 concert on Friday night, Shanna shared her well wishes for the couple.\n\nBut she also stuck her foot in it as she revealed that the pregnancy isn't new news - dispelling rumours that the couple's rock 'n' roll announcement was genuinely the moment Travis found out.\n\n\"Very excited for them, hope they have a great experience bringing in a new life to the world,\" she told a fan on Instagram.\n\nAfter Travis acted shocked after spotting Kourtney's sign in the crowd, Shanna burst their bubble.\n\n\"I've known for weeks,\" she said. \"This is not new news to me.\"\n\nAlthough it seems the couple had already told their inner circle of the news, Kourtney's announcement was the first time she had publicly confirmed the news.\n\nEarlier this weekend, Kourtney revealed the pop punk inspiration behind her shock pregnancy announcement.\n\nThe 44-year-old reality star could be seen bouncing up and down at Friday night's Blink 182 concert holding a sign that read: \"Travis I'm Pregnant\".\n\nAnd it's not the first time the drummer has been confronted with a woman holding up the sign as it made an appearance in the band's 1999 music video for All The Small Things.\n\nThe iconic music video famously parodies boy bands including Backstreet Boys and 'N Sync, as well as pop princesses Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera.\n\nAs the three band members make their way through an airport hanger, a woman in a leopard print bikini holds up the sign.\n\nThe memorable tongue-in-cheek video won \"Best Group Video\" at the 2000 MTV Video Music Awards.\n\nAnd as Kourtney is taking her new role as rockstar's wife very seriously she recreated the sign while backstage at Blink 182's latest concert.\n\nHer close friend Stephanie Shepherd shared a picture of Kourtney writing the sign and shared with another Blink 182 lyric from 2001 song Rock Show: \"Fell in love with the girl at the rock show.\"\n\nAfter seeing his wife's sign, Travis jumped off the stage and ran towards her to give her a big kiss.\n\nThe couple have made no secret of their plans to have a baby together after they got married in Italy last year.\n\nKourtney shared her IVF journey with fans of The Karadshians before revealing she was stopping fertility treatment for the sake of her health.\n\nBut they were still trying to conceive naturally and in the third season of the reality show, Kourtney rushed off for a 15-minute sex session with her husband - leaving sister Khloe bemused.\n\nKourtney shares three children - Mason , Penelope and Reign with her ex Scott Disick , while Travis is dad to his son Landon, daughter Alabama and his step daughter Atiana , with ex-wife Shanna Moakler .\n\nKourtney had gone to extreme and bizarre strengths to improve the pair's chances of conception, including drinking Travis' semen and vaginal steaming.\n\nKourtney and Travis' IVF journey started after the 44-year-old froze her eggs prior to the start of their relationship in 2020. However, she explained that most of her eggs “didn't survive the thaw” and “none of them made it to an embryo.”\n\nKourtney added: “The freezing of the eggs isn't guaranteed. I think that that's a misunderstanding. People do it thinking that it's like a safety net and it's not.”\n\nShe added: “We would love a baby more than anything, but I just really believe in what God has in store for us. If that's a baby, then I believe that it will happen.\"\n\nKourtney also shared that the process had been physically and mentally difficult and \"took a toll\" on the Poosh founder, and the medications she took reportedly put her into \"early menopause.\"\n\n“It took a toll on me physically. My health is still impacted because it's hormones and also mentally, it definitely took a toll,” she explained. “I think being happy is most important and being a good parent to my kids.\n\n\"We are just embracing whatever is meant to be will be.”\n\n* Follow Mirror Celebs on Snapchat, Instagram, Twitter and Facebook."
