        "text": "Travis is now married to Kourtney Kardashian and they were said to be dating in 2021 but had known each other for years prior with Travis making cameos in the Kardashian-Jenner TV show, Keeping Up With The Kardashians.\n\nTravis and his ex-wife Shanna, who he was married to for four years and shares children Alabama and Landon with, announced their split in 2006 and finalised their divorce in 2008.\n\nBut Shanna has implied that there may have been some overlaps.\n\nOne fan took the comments of Shanna's selfie and wrote: \"I hope that you get a huge apology someday for what was said on that exploitative, money-grabbing, circus. 'He's been through Hell.' 'Kourtney has filled a void for me.'\"\n\nShanna responded: \"She posts more of my kids than her own lol.\"\n\nAnother fan then made some inappropriate comments about Travis's dating history and Shanna replied: \"I love watching the TikToks about all the women he was with and no one wants to address the fact he was married.\"\n\nThings started off civil between Kourtney and Shanna, although the model did reveal that Kourtney and Travis's relationship \"did affect\" her relationship with her kids.\n\n“At one point in time, [his relationship] did affect my relationship with my kids, but my kids and I are in an amazing place,\" she told Us Weekly in April 2022.\n\n\"We have a great relationship with one another,” she said. “I’ve been a very active mother for the last two decades. My kids and I are in a great headspace.”\n\nBut things reportedly grew tense between Kourtney and Shanna and in July 2022 a source said that the pair \"do not communicate.\"\n\n\"Kourtney and Shanna don’t communicate. Shanna supports Travis and Kourtney’s relationship and co-parents well with Travis, but Shanna and Kourtney don’t have a relationship or friendship of any sort,\" they said.\n\n\"That barrier has not been broken. It might get better over time, but for now, they have very separate and different lives and the kids are very much independent so they just never cross paths.\"\n\nThe Mirror has reached out to Travis' and Kourtney's representatives.\n\nFollow theMirror US News page on Facebook."
