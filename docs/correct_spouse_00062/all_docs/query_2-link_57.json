        "text": "Kidding....she did it via laptop.\n\nFor those who don't know who she is.. she's Travis Barker's wife.\n\nWhile she is rarely seen on our website, make no mistake that Shanna Moakler is one involved and hands-on celeb mama! Keenly aware of the paparazzi-infested spots to avoid, this protective mom of three says that she is a \"great mother,\" although she has been criticized for not being as involved as her ex. Stating that the cameras \"ruined\" her marriage, Shanna vows to protect her family as much as possible.\n\nIn a candid look at her life, her children, her dreams to be \"seen as a serious actress,\" her belief that \"anything is possible\" with ex Travis Barker although they \"both have a lot of growing up to do,\" Shanna spoke to Celebrity Baby Scoop with an open heart and an honest voice.\n\nCBS: You are mom to three children: Atiana, 10, Landon, 6, and Alabama, 4. How has motherhood changed you? What is the most challenging part of motherhood? The most rewarding?\n\nSM: \"Motherhood changed me in so many ways. I look at the world different. I was a young mother, and a single mother quickly. I am constantly striving to be a better person for my children, for my family. I want to give them the opportunities I didn't have.\n\nHaving three kids, I find the most challenging part is just making sure I take the time to individually nurture their different needs. They actually work very well together and I've made sure that they have a mutual respect for one another and their ages. I really try to make time to sit with each on daily, talk to them, see how they are feeling. Coming from a divorced home, I want my children to know they are loved. I want to breed confidence and I want them to know how to work through life's challenges; alone and together.\n\nThe most rewarding part is seeing them grow and develop into these beautiful personalities and people. There is nothing like when your babies tell you they love you!\"\n\nCBS: How are your children doing?\n\nSM: \"My children are wonderful! They are all in school now and they are adjusting well.\n\nMy oldest daughter is 10. We have now gone through an Abercrombie & Fitch stage. It's the 'cool' thing to wear! The Gap is a thing of the past. Watching her start to do her hair and find herself is cute. She is my arts 'n crafts fanatic!\n\nLandon is really into music. My ex Travis has a band mate who plays the guitar (Mark Hoppus of Blink 182). It's funny 'cause Landon wants to play the guitar and his son (Mark Hoppos' of Blink 182) wants to play the drums! Everyday I have a new rockstar in the house. I've already told him no tattoos! Landon also is a Lego boy, and it's my favorite thing to do with him.\n\nAlabama is my girly girl. She just loves nails and makeup! This Christmas I got her a 'real' glitz pageant gown. She begged for it. Watching her open it was amazing! She was like Elizabeth Taylor: 'oh myyyyyy God! I wanted thissssss sooooo bad!' It made my holiday!\"\n\nCBS: Do you want more children in the future?\n\nSM: \"I do. I would love to have at least one, but I would have two.\"\n\nCBS: You and Travis Barker have been on and off for years. Perhaps there's a chance for reconciliation?\n\nSM: \"I believe anything is possible, but we both have a lot of growing up to do (still) and we also have a lot of healing. We have gone back and forth as we both have the same dream. We both have strong personalities and we have different parenting styles. This has made it hard.\"\n\nCBS: Although you and Travis are not together, he seems like such a hands-on dad. Are you two able to co-parent well amidst living apart?\n\nSM: \"Travis and I are lucky, we live very close to each other. So, yes, we try very hard to work with each other per our schedules and co-parent [situation]. We are both very hands on and our children come first. Always have.\n\nTravis is a morning person and loves driving the kids to school. I am a night owl and prefer to take on the bath times and homework, etc.\"\n\nCBS: What is the custody agreement with all 3 of your children? Do they live with both sets of parents, or are they with you full time?\n\nSM: \"We split the week. I have them weekdays and he has them on the weekends. I try to work with him and his schedule as much as possible as we don't really have 9 to 5 jobs. Sometimes he is gone for months. Others, I am gone for weeks. So we try to accommodate each other as best we can.\"\n\nCBS: Your children are rarely seen on our website. Do you make a point of staying away from paparazzi-infested spots? Do the paps drive you crazy? Are your children scared of them?\n\nSM: \"I make a major point to stay away from paparazzi spots. Sadly, by doing this, I have been criticized as not being a good mother as I am just not 'seen' with them as much as my ex is. I find it sad that being considered a good mother meant I had to parade my children around Robertson and Malibu. I have chosen to pass.\n\nSometimes paps do scare my children and other times not. I have allowed the cameras into my home, I let them see me when I go out with friends.\n\nThey have covered my marriage and I think it ruined my marriage.\n\nThere is one part of my life that I don't share with anyone and that is my family and children. I don't need the public or my ex to tell me I am a good mother. I am a great mother!\"\n\nCBS: How do you manage your busy career with being a mom to 3?\n\nSM: \"Now that all 3 kids are in school, it gives me much more time in the day to do the meetings and the personal things I need done. I have a lot of help and I just make lists and I prioritize. I figure out the kids' time-frames first, after-school programs, etc., and then I make mine from there. Things come up but we work together.\"\n\nCBS: What is the hardest part about being a celebrity mom?\n\nSM: \"The public becomes interested in your children. They make websites for them, your kids in essence have 'fans.' This can be flattering but at the same time a little scary. There are times as well I want to 'show off' my kids like other moms and I simply can't.\n\nThe public can also be cruel when life challenges you. The first thing people will say is 'oh, the poor kids' or attack the fact you are a mother, when they really know nothing of the matters at hand or how I parent.\n\nI have said before in blogs as well, when people attack you as a mother, I think it's the lowest form of abuse to a woman and being a celebrity it's for the world to see.\"\n\nCBS: If you could make one confession about being a mom, what would it be?\n\nSM: \"That I am obsessed with their toys! LOL. I love the Barbie and Tinkerbell movies and could watch them over and over.\"\n\nCBS: Do you cook? What are some of your favorite family meals?\n\nSM: \"I actually just started a cooking class. I go every Wednesday. My kids are vegetarians. Atiana is agua-vegetarian (she eats fish), but I love to cook.\n\nFor breakfast: quiche! And my kids love it. I also love pasta. I make it fun for the kids and let them dip their pasta into their sauce. My kids love to cook as well and we make homemade pizza together and cookies. It's one of my favorite things to do with them: cook!\"\n\nCBS: You were Miss USA in 1995. Do you want your girls to enter beauty pageants?\n\nSM: \"I have no problem with my daughters doing beauty pageants if they so choose. They may like it, they may hate it. Beauty pageants get a bad rap, but most pageant contestants are some of the most intelligent, driven women I have ever met. They are brave and they want to better themselves and be involved in their communities.\n\nWe need role models and we need systems that are positive for young women. This may bot be everyone's ideal, but it works. My experience in pageants have taught me confidence, poise, amazing life skills and I have met friends for life along the way.\"\n\nCBS: What do you think about beauty pageants for children?\n\nSM: \"I think they are fine as long as the child wants to do it. I also think networks like to exploit the glitz ones that you see on TV. I think there are far worse things mothers are doing than spending time with their daughters and dressing up and dancing.\"\n\nCBS: Have you told your children about your past nude modeling career? What will you say to your girls if they want to pose nude when they are young adults?\n\nSM: \"My children know and I try to make nudity not a big deal in our home. We have art with nudity as well. I do teach my children self respect and self love and that our bodies are to be honored.\n\nIf my daughters wanted to pose nude, I would support them, but I would also let them know how it has affected my life and in what ways I thought it was going to help and in what ways it has hindered.\n\nThere are times I wish I hadn't posed and others I am very proud I did. I think honesty and communication and really helping your children learn what is best for dad or I, or Bob and Joe, may not be best for them.\"\n\nCBS: When you were growing up, did you envision your life to be the way it is? What dreams have come true? Which ones haven't?\n\nSM: \"In some ways, I envisioned red carpets and being in front of the camera. I have a strong, beautiful family. And yes, children I wanted very much. I worked very hard to be able to live the life I have and I do love it.\n\nI did not envision my children coming from a divorced family. My parents have been married for 40 years and I know the joys of having your parents together. It is something I wanted my children to have.\n\nI can't saying having your marriage woes played out in the public was part of the plan either! But it's life and it's part of what I signed up for to an extent.\n\nI have dreams of being seen as a serious actress and not as someone played out in the tabloids. But I have an amazing life thus far, more than many can dream of. I get to do what I love, great family and friends, TV shows, marriage, babies, the wedding, etc. For me, everything from here on out is a perk.\"\n\nCBS: I read that one of your favorite books of all time is Conversations With God by Neale Donald Walsch. Please tell us why you love this book and what spirituality means to you. Do you teach your children about God and do you want them to have a sense of spirituality?\n\nSM: \"I am a very spiritual person and I think it's what has helped me get through so many challenges where most would crumble. It's also another area of my life I don't share with most. I pray every night. I teach my children to have a personal relationship with God.\n\nI find it very important to be able to ground yourself and to be able to connect and listen to your intuition, especially when you are lost. I don't want my children to pray just 'cause they were told to, I want them to have a clear understanding of what prayer is and when they are ready to help them find a true, loving connection from prayer and what it means to them, I think this is very important.\n\nI meditate often and sometimes my kids like to try with me.\n\nI found this book [Conversations With God] so wonderful as it's how I always envisioned our universe and the heavens - I just couldn't put it into words and he did for me. I read many books dealing with spirituality, but this was by far life-changing and one of my favorites.\"\n\nCBS: What's next for you?\n\nSM: \"I am working on my cosmetic line SMOAK which I am very proud of. It is a mineral line that is simply amazing! It's chic, it has the healing benefits of minerals but it's not like you are powdering your face with dirt. The products are divine and I am truly living a dream with its creation!\n\nI am also working and back as the co-executive director of Miss California USA and I am very excited for Miss USA this April!\n\nI am in the works for a couple reality TV shows which will be fun and getting back out there for scripted projects!\n\nBesides that I am 'Mama.'\"\n\nSOURCE"
