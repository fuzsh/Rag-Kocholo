        "text": "Shanna Moakler says she thinks it's 'fantastic' that her ex Travis Barker and Kourtney Kardashian are reportedly trying for a baby.\n\nThe American model was married to the Blink-182 drummer for four years and together they share two teenage children.\n\nBut she won't be watching his new life with Kourtney play out on TV, saying she isn't going to be tuning in to the new Kardashians show.\n\nOn the second episode, which aired earlier on Hulu this week, Kourtney opened up about her struggles with IVF and reveals in confession that her and Travis want to have a baby.\n\nShanna seems to be pleased for her former husband despite the challenges the couple say they face to have a child together.\n\nThe mother-of-three told Us Weekly : \"If that's a desire between the two of them to have children, that's fantastic.\n\n\"I don't have any issues with that. Their personal relationship is really nothing I get involved in.\n\n\"All I know is kind of, like, what everyone knows. I think they were trying with IVF and there were some complications.\"\n\nKourtney said on the show she is growing sick and tired of people speculating about her having a baby - and says they have no idea about the difficulties the couple have to overcome.\n\nShe said: \"Every single person on social media is always like, Kourtney's pregnant, Kourtney's pregnant. Kourtney's gained so much weight.\n\n\"I'm like, it's so rude to comment on people when you have no idea what they are actually going through.\n\n\"The medication that they have been giving me, they put me into menopause, literally into menopause.\n\n\"I think because I'm so clean and careful about what I put into my body, it's just like having the complete opposite reaction and working as a contraceptive instead of helping us.\"\n\nShanna was married to 46-year-old Blink-182 drummer Travis from 2004 until 2008 and together they share two children; 18-year-old son Landon and 16-year-old daughter Alabama.\n\nBut she said last week that she won't be watching the latest programme.\n\nShe told Us Weekly: “I’ve never seen an episode of the Kardashians and I won’t start now,.\n\n“However, I wish them nothing but success. As long as my children are happy that’s all I care about. My ex’s relationship really isn’t any of my business but I wish them continued happiness.”"
