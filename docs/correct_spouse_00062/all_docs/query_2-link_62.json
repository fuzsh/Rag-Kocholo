        "text": "Former reality stars Travis Barker and Shanna Moakler reportedly blame their MTV reality show for their failed marriage.\n\nRadar Online reports that the Blink-182 drummer and former beauty queen both blamed their divorce on the initial decision to film Meet the Barkers, an MTV reality show which aired for two seasons (2005-06).\n\nAccording to the report, the former spouses openly discussed their reasoning behind that statement in Barker’s new memoir, Can I Say.\n\nHowever, Travis Barker and Shanna Moakler apparently have different takes on how the reality show ruined their marriage.\n\nFor instance, Shanna Moakler states that Barker distanced himself from her due to his fear of being recognized as a reality TV star more than a rock star.\n\n“I think the show destroyed our relationship. I think he was afraid he was going to be looked on as a reality star. So when the cameras stopped rolling, he distanced himself from me in every way that he possibly could.”\n\nWhile Moakler wrote about how the reality show allegedly changed Travis Barker, the 39-year-old Blink-182 drummer focused his writings on how the show changed his former wife, instead.\n\n“I felt like having the reality show changed Shanna’s character. Shanna wanted to be an actress, and I felt she started doing things just for the cameras— for attention, or maybe it was just her dramatic personality. It was turning into a variety show instead of a reality show— and in my mind, she was behaving out of character on camera, which was carrying over to her not being genuine with me.”\n\nBarker further claims that the “toxic” energy that he received from the reality show was the key factor that led to him deciding to pull the plug after only two seasons.\n\nTravis Barker and Shanna Moakler first became husband and wife on October 30, 2004. They share two children together: 12-year-old Landon Asher and 9-year-old Alabama Luella.\n\nNearly two years after they got married, Barker filed for divorce in August 2006, according to Access Hollywood.\n\nBy ending their marriage, Barker and Moakler became the third couple with an MTV reality series about their lives together that ended in divorce.\n\nDave Navarro and Carmen Electra ended their marriage nearly three years after their wedding aired on the show, Til Death Do Us Part: Carmen and Dave.\n\nNick Lachey and Jessica Simpson became the first reality couple on MTV with the series, Newlyweds, and sadly became the first reality power couple on the network to get a divorce.\n\nEven after they separated, Travis Barker and Shanna Moakler seemed to have an on-again/off-again relationship. However, in a February 2008 interview with People magazine, Barker confirmed that their divorce was finalized. He further claimed that his main focus at the time was on his “beautiful son” and “beautiful daughter.” He did not “have time for anything else.”\n\nIn addition to discussing his brief marriage and kids, Barker also focused on the aftermath of his tragic plane crash in 2008. After he survived the crash, Barker made it clear that he no longer felt comfortable flying on an airplane.\n\nHowever, he makes it clear in his memoir that he apparently has one exception to the stance that he has maintained for over six years.\n\n“I tell my children, ‘When you’re ready to fly, I’m ready to fly.’ So if my son came to me and said, ‘Dad, let’s fly to Hawaii,’ or, ‘Dad, let’s go to Australia,’ I’m in Australia… I don’t want it to be a handicap for them, and I dread it. You know, I lose sleep over it, but if and when they say they want to do it, I’m going to do it.”\n\nEven though Travis Barker has been romantically linked to other women in the years that have passed since his divorce, he has not taken a third stroll down the aisle toward marriage yet.\n\n[Photo by Peter Kramer/Getty Images]"
