        "text": "Shanna Moakler was seen wearing a very revealing outfit in her first sighting since ex-husband, Travis Barker proposed to Kourtney Kardashian.\n\nThe day after the couple's engagement news, Shanna was seen out pumping gas into her car in Los Angeles on Monday.\n\nThe 46-year-old former Playboy Playmate appeared to be none too bothered by her ex's news as she went about running her errands for the day.\n\nMoakler wore a very revealing low-cut white top that left little to the imagination while pumping her gas.\n\nThe Pacific Blue actress also wore a pair of blue-and-white tie-dye sweat pants that obscured her chiseled legs, as well as a set of sandals.\n\nShe accessorized with a stylish set of orange-tinted sunglasses, and kept her phone attached to a gold crossbody chain that was slung over her right shoulder.\n\nHer gorgeous blonde locks were tied into two lengthy braids that fell onto her backside during her solo outing.\n\nShe seemed to be one of the few individuals who were not too pleased with the news about her ex's engagement.\n\nMoakler previously took to Instagram on Sunday night hours after the engagement with a dramatic reaction as she admitted to being 'temporarily closed for spiritual maintenance.'\n\nThe former pageant queen has had a contentious time with Kravis, and even at one time admitted that their romance was 'putting a wedge' between her relationship with her kids.\n\nThe Blink-182 drummer dropped down to one knee and proposed to Kourtney on the beach overlooking the sunset in Montecito on Sunday night with her famous family looking on from the Miramar hotel.\n\nAnd while the happy couple were certainly in celebration mode, her ex, Scott Disick, became a trending topic after fans were curious about his reaction to the engagement.\n\nThe occasion comes after his disastrous leaked direct message to her ex, Younes Bendjima, where he criticized Kourtney for too much PDA with Travis on their trip to Italy.\n\nTravis famously filed for divorce from Shanna in 2006 after just two years of marriage.\n\nThe end of the pair's time together came after claims emerged regarding the drummer's fidelity to his former spouse.\n\nPrior to becoming involved with his second wife, the musician was married to Melissa Kennedy, although their marriage only lasted for a year and ended in 2002.\n\nEarlier this year, the television figure decried her ex's very public new romance and told Us Weekly that it's negatively affecting the bond she has with her two kids.\n\n'The Kardashians are buying my kids Prada every other day,' the former Miss USA told the publication.\n\n'They're going on lavish trips. They're doing all these things, which is fine. I think it's nice that they're being kind to my kids. I want that for my children.'\n\nShe noted that there's 'severe distancing' between her and Alabama, 15, and Landon, 18, and noted: 'I don't think it's great when they put a wedge in between their biological mother.'\n\nKourtney went public with her new romance at the beginning of the year, and has Reign, six, Penelope, eight, and Mason, 11, from her previous relationship to Scott Disick\n\nShanna also recently told US Weekly that his alleged infidelity with Kim Kardashian was the catalyst to finally end their relationship.\n\n'I divorced my ex because, I saw them — I caught them having an affair,' she claimed.\n\nShanna added that she 'saw text messages' between the pair and alleged the 'affair' took place before Keeping Up With The Kardashians premiered in 2007.\n\nShe claimed mutual friends of the trio told her of the alleged affair, stating 'they sent me all their [text] conversations and I'm also close friends with people who were there, while things were happening.'\n\nAccording to Shanna's timeline, Kim was still working alongside Paris Hilton as her 'closet organizer' when she first came in contact with Travis.\n\nShe said: '[Travis] had already had an affair with Paris Hilton. And… at the time Kim was Paris' closet organizer, they were best friends. And he started using [Kim] as a model for [his clothing company], Famous Stars and Straps.'\n\nShe added that she had asked her former husband to 'not to use' Kim as a model due to her direct ties to Paris, and that she and Travis had been 'working on our marriage and trying to heal through that affair', that but he continued to work with Kim despite her wishes.\n\nShanna continued: 'Then I received all the text messages and the other third parties kind of let me know. It's something I was well aware of.'"
