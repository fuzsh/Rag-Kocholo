        "text": "Travis Barker’s ex-wife and mother to two of his kids, Shanna Moakler, seemingly doesn’t like Kourtney Kardashian being step-mom to her son and daughter, adding yet more tension to the tense family dynamic.\n\nFormer beauty queen Shanna is said to be jealous of Kourtney (who recently gave birth to her first child with Travis earlier this month) and her close relationship with 19-year-old Landon and 17-year-old Alabama.\n\nIn April this year, Shanna shocked fans as she publicly slammed Kourtney for posting photos of her kids and calling the Kardashian star’s relationship with Travis “so f***ing weird,” before adding “I’m definitely not jealous.”\n\nShortly after her rant on Miss Understood, eagled-eyed Instagrammers clocked that Shanna was no longer being followed by the two kids she shares with Travis. That same month, both Alabama and Landon shared sweet tributes for their stepmother, Kourtney, for her birthday.\n\nREAD MORE:Travis Barker slammed for 'grounds for divorce' behavior when wife Kourtney was in labor\n\nAlthough tensions seem to have now died down, the relationships between Shanna, who is renowned for reigniting tension, her kids and Kourtney remains complicated.\n\nComplications in the relationship between Shanna and her two children can be dated back to around April 2021, when Landon and Alabama began publicly criticizing their mom’s parenting skills in Instagram comments as well as videos which were circulated widely on TikTok.\n\n“My mom has never completely been in my life. Can you guys stop painting her out to be an amazing mom?,” Alabama wrote on her Instagram story, before claiming Shanna didn’t try and make Mother’s Day plans with her kids.\n\n“Did your moms ask to see you on Mother’s Day [because] mine didn’t? I’m done keeping it a secret, reality shows.”\n\nThe teenager, who was 15 at the time, also uploaded a video of herself lipsyncing Kehlani’s lyrics ‘The Letter’ lyrics, including “And every girl needs a mother,” insinuating Shanna had been somewhat absent from her parenting duties, claims that her brother seemed to verify in his own Instagram post which said his mother “isn’t in [their] lives” to the same extent as Travis.\n\nShanna was quick to respond, telling Us Weekly that her children’s comments were confusing and hurtful.\n\n\"I’m not really sure why my kids put that out there,” she told the magazine in May 2021.\n\n“It’s hurtful and heartbreaking to have your kids say that. ... I feel like, as teenagers, they do rebel and say things sometimes they don’t mean,” she added.\n\nThings seemed to deteriorate from there as the reality star mother told Page Six she was no longer on speaking terms with either Landon or Alabama in June the same year.\n\n“There’s still some distance,” she explained. “I’m just trying to give everybody some space so we can heal and come back together again.”\n\nThat same month an insider told US Weekly that the three “definitely had a strained relationship and it’s because of the Kardashians.”\n\nAlthough the kids supported their mother through her dramatic breakup with Matthew Rondeau during which he was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence during 2022, Shanna lashing out in April is thought to have put strain on the already complicated relationship."
