        "text": "Shanna Moakler said she is “praying” for her ex-husband, Travis Barker, and his pregnant wife, Kourtney Kardashian, after his band had to abruptly postpone their European tour due to an “urgent family matter.”\n\n“I don’t know what’s going on, I just know that our kids are safe and sound — obviously that’s important to me,” the model — who shares kids Landon, 19, and Alabama, 17, with Barker — told photographers in Los Angeles Friday.\n\n“Obviously, whenever they have to cancel shows, it’s a really big deal. I’m just praying that his immediate family — and the baby and Kourtney and everyone — is safe and OK.”\n\nAs Page Six previously reported, the 47-year-old drummer rushed back to the US as Blink-182’s tour was set to kick off overseas.\n\n“Due to an urgent family matter, Travis has had to return home to the States,” the band tweeted early Friday morning. “The Glasgow, Belfast, and Dublin shows are being postponed.”\n\n“More information in regards to his return to Europe and rescheduled dates will be provided as soon as available.”\n\nJust hours before news broke about the family emergency, the drummer posted photos of the Glasgow Airport prayer room and a banner that read, “Together we pray.”\n\nAdditionally, around the time that Barker was headed home, his teen daughter, Alabama, shared a TikTok video of herself lip-syncing to Coi Leray’s “No More Parties.”\n\nIn the clip, the aspiring rapper rocked full glam while wearing a black-and-pink pajama set.\n\nKardashian and Barker’s reps did not immediately respond to Page Six’s requests for comment.\n\nFor more Page Six you love…\n\nListen to our weekly “We Hear” podcast\n\nShop our exclusive merch\n\nThe couple — who tied the knot in May 2022 — are currently expecting their first child together.\n\nThe Poosh founder, 44, announced the exciting news in June during Barker’s concert with Blink-182 in Los Angeles. At the time, she held up a sign that read, “Travis I’m pregnant,” as he performed on stage.\n\nLater that month, Kardashian and the Transplants drummer revealed that they were expecting a baby boy.\n\nKardashian is already a mom to three kids — Mason, 13, Penelope, 11, and Reign, 8 — with ex Scott Disick.\n\nIn addition to Barker’s two children, he also raised Moakler’s daughter from another relationship, Atiana De La Hoya, 24, as his own.\n\nThe former pageant queen, 48, and rockstar were married from 2004 to 2008."
