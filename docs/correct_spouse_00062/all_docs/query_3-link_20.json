        "text": "In April of 2021, Kourtney Kardashian and Travis Barker had a whirlwind wedding ceremony in Las Vegas, kicking off their spring of nuptials. They went on to have a legal ceremony in Santa Barbara and then an elaborate Italian ceremony a month later. That's a lot of anniversaries, but the couple is up for the challenge.\n\nA year into their marriage, Kardashian and Barker are still happy and in love according to an insider speaking with Entertainment Tonight, who stated that the pair are “enjoying their new life together.”\n\n“It's a new chapter, so Kourtney just wants to continue to keep it sacred,” the source continued. “Kourtney and Travis are doing fantastic and are over the moon in love. Things couldn't be better between them and they're growing even closer every day.”\n\nThis year wasn't without challenges, however. The Kardashians star has spoken about their attempts to expand their family through IVF and needing to take a break from her fertility treatments. Both of them have children from previous relationships. Kardashian shares 13-year-old Mason, ten-year-old Penelope and eight-year-old Reign with her ex, Scott Disick. Barker and his ex, Shanna Moakler, share 19-year-old Landon and 17-year-old Alabama.\n\nThe source said that they are “taking things one day at a time when it comes to bringing a baby into their family.”\n\nThe insider added, “Things have been very seamless between their kids. Everyone has been getting along and hopes to keep it that way.”\n\nKardashian and Disick “are doing a lot better with co-parenting” as well, despite Disick's rumored issues with Barker.\n\n“Scott's jealousy has subsided for the most part,” they said. “Those types of feelings have faded on his end. He will always have so much love for Kourtney, but he's also focusing on himself.”"
