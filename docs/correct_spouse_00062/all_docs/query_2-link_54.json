More than anything, she was my best friend and I will miss her every day of my life.\"\n\nThe former model, 47, concluded: \"I understand that this is a part of life and something that we all can actually support one another with, which is the loss of someone we love. Godspeed.\"\n\nShanna was married to Travis between 2004 and 2008 and is mum to his kids Landon, 19, and Alabama, 17. She also shared 23-year-old daughter Atiana with former beau and boxing champion Oscar De La Hoya.\n\nLast year, she paid a sweet tribute to her mum on Instagram for Mother's Day, writing: \"\"#happymothersday @gailmoakler there will never be enough words to express how thankful I am to have you as my mom!\n\n\"Thank you for always standing by me and supporting me through this crazy life. I love you so much! You truly are the most amazing mother....\"\n\nShe also shared a number of throwback snaps a year earlier, showcasing the pair's strong bond. She captioned the upload at the time: \"Happy Mother's Day to my beautiful mom @gailmoakler how lucky I am to have a mom like you! You're my best friend and my idol! I love you so much.\"\n\nThere were several other posts throughout the years in which Shanna paid special tribute to her mum, including on Gail's 50th wedding anniversary to her husband.\n\nIn the post, Shanna once again thanked her mum for being an inspiration in her life.\n\n* Follow Mirror Celebs on Snapchat, Instagram, Twitter and Facebook."
