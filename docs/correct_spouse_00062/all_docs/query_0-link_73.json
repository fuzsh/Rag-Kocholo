        "text": "Shanna Moakler has wished ex Travis Barker the best of luck after reports suggested he had tied the knot with his new partner Kourtney Kardashian.\n\nThe former Playboy Bunny, 47, was the former wife of the Blink-182 drummer and shares two kids with the musician - daughter Alabama, 16, and son Landon, 18.\n\nTravis, 46, also acts as stepdad to her 23-year-old daughter Atiana, whose dad is Oscar De La Hoya.\n\nAnd despite previous niggles surrounding Travis' relationship with the 42-year-old Keeping Up With The Kardashians star, Shanna sent a message of congratulations to the pair on Tuesday.\n\nIn a statement to People, she said: \"Congratulations to the happy couple. I wish them the best that life has to offer on their journey together.\"\n\nShanna and Travis were married between 2004 and 2008, with the model previously blaming their split on Travis having an affair with Kourtney's sister Kim Kardashian.\n\nIt's now been reported that Kourtney is officially the new wife of the drummer after the pair allegedly wed in Las Vegas after the Grammy Awards at the weekend.\n\nAnd it seems her outfit of choice for the star-studded bash was good enough for her first ever wedding later in the evening.\n\nThe mum-of-three's Grammy-turned-wedding attire consisted of a figure-hugging Et Ochs onesie - complete with a plunging neckline - and sheer opera-length gloves and dark black shades as accessories.\n\nThe ceremony, said to take place at 1.45am, reportedly lasted just 30 minutes, much to the delight of the pair.\n\nChapel owner Marty Frierson explained to the publication how the couple were very affectionate throughout their ceremony.\n\nHe said \"There was a lot of that â€” kissing and hugging. They barely came up for air! They just seemed totally in love.\"\n\nHe added that there were only four people at the ceremony but each of them was taking a load of snaps and videos using their phones.\n\nMarty continued: \"I don't know if they were the friends or their social media team. They filmed everything from the time they walked in, to the time they walked out.\n\n\"The vows, the kiss, the rose bouquet toss, the dancing. I usually take pictures for the chapel but they wanted to handle it all themselves.\"\n\nTravis and Kourtney got engaged in October after nine months of being together.\n\nThe rocker put on a lavish show at a beachfront location as he got down on one knee - much to the delight of the POOSH founder.\n\nDo you have a story to sell?
