The couple are also raising Kourtney’s kids with Scott Disick – Mason, 14, Penelope, 11, and Reign, 9. Barker has also been a father figure to Shanna’s daughter Atiana, whom she shares with her ex Oscar de la Hoya.\n\n“[I] don’t have to like the f–king Kardashians, and I’m honestly sick of talking about them,” Moakler confessed to People.\n\n“As I stand here today, as a mature woman who’s gone through all that … I do not give a f–k what anyone thinks of me anymore. I’m proud of who I am,” she added.\n\n“I’m more than just the ex-wife of famous men,” she remarked. “I was Miss USA at 19. I’m smart. Every part I’ve ever got in any movie, or every show I hosted or auditioned for, I worked my f–king ass off to get.”"
