        "text": "It appears Travis Barker has spilled the beans on two important facts relating to his unborn child.\n\nAs he and Kourtney Kardashian Barker await the arrival of their first baby together, he let slip the full name they have chosen for their unborn son - and when he is expected to make his grand arrival.\n\nWATCH THE VIDEO ABOVE: Kourtney Kardashian and Travis Barker announce pregnancy.\n\nKnow the news with the 7NEWS app: Download today\n\nBoth already have children with previous partners, and they have been candid with their struggles to fall pregnant together, undergoing IVF and announcing in June that they were expecting.\n\nDuring an appearance on the One Life One Chance with Toby Morse podcast, the Blink-182 drummer was quizzed over whether there would be another album from his previous band, Transplants.\n\nBarker responded that he nearly joined the band for a benefit concert in Hawaii they were going to do, “but it’s the week Rocky’s due”.\n\n“Rocky Thirteen Barker?” Toby Morse asked, to which Barker confirmed, “Rocky Thirteen Barker.”\n\n“Such a hard name, man,” the host told the drummer.\n\n“I was like he’s going to come out of...my wife’s vagina doing front kicks and push-ups and...” the rockstar said.\n\n“That’s such a great name,” Morse told him before asking when Rocky was expected.\n\nBarker told him the due date was Halloween.\n\n“C’mon dude, you couldn’t have planned that any better,” the host told his guest.\n\n“I know. It’s either Halloween or like, the first week of November.”\n\nThis name reveal is not the first time fans have heard the name Rocky Barker teased.\n\nAn eagle-eyed fan spotted ‘Rocky’ on one of the cards placed on a wishing tree at the couple’s baby shower in September.\n\nThe note appeared to read, “May Baby Rocky...” as discovered by a Reddit user who zoomed in on Kardashian’s since-deleted Instagram story to reveal the blurry words.\n\nThe baby will be Kardashian’s fourth child, her first with husband Barker.\n\nShe has three children with ex-partner Scott Disick - Mason, 13, Penelope, 11 and Reign, eight.\n\nBlink-182 drummer Barker has two children - Landon, 19, and Alabama, 17, and stepdaughter Atiana, 24.\n\nIn June, the expectant parents, who married in May 2022, shared that they already knew their unborn child’s name.\n\n“I already know his name,” Barker revealed on Instagram after Kardashian shared new pregnancy photos.\n\nThe baby shower was held at the home of Kardashian’s mother Kris Jenner and, in true Kourtney style, was Disneyland-themed.\n\nThe Poosh founder is a self-confessed “Disney adult” having had a love for the ‘happiest place on earth’ since her childhood.\n\nMicky Mouse balloons and food featured at the event, as did a musical performance from a barbershop quartet, mimicking Disney’s Dapper Dans.\n\nGuests were given Disney Mouse ears on arrival, featuring ‘Baby Barker’ engraved on the back.\n\nKardashian announced she was pregnant in a video on Instagram in June - in which she was seen in the audience at a Blink-182 concert holding a sign reading, “Travis I’m pregnant.”\n\nLater that month, the pair revealed the sex of the baby in a video shared to the couple’s Instagram pages, in which Barker provided a drum roll seconds before blue confetti shot out to reveal they were expecting a boy.\n\nOn September 7, Kardashian thanked her medical team for “saving our baby’s life” after she required emergency surgery.\n\nThe black-and-white Instagram post came six days after Barker delayed his band Blink-182’s UK tour for an “urgent family matter”.\n\n“I will be forever grateful to my incredible doctors for saving our baby’s life,” she wrote at the time.\n\n“I am eternally grateful to my husband who rushed to my side from tour to be with me in the hospital and take care of me afterward, my rock.\n\n“And to my mom, thank you for holding my hand through this.”\n\nFor more engaging celebrity content, visit 7Life on Facebook.\n\nYour cookie settings are preventing this third party content from displaying.\n\nIf you’d like to view this content, please adjust your .\n\nTo find out more about how we use cookies, please see our Cookie Guide."
