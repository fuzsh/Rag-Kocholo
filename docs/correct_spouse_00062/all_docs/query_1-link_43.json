        "text": "Shanna Moakler is once again out here dishing on her relationship with Travis Barker, and things still seem to be...somewhat tense between the exes.\n\nDuring a convo on Jeff Lewis Live, Shanna explained that she and Travis are barely in touch (though he did wish her happy Mother's Day!) and she's given up on competing with him over their kids, Alabama and Landon.\n\n\"My ex is a very powerful, famous person, it’s kind of hard to compete on that level,\" Shanna said. \"I gave up, I was never really trying to compete. I gave that up a long time ago. I was like, 'You win. Like, you’re the winner.'\"\n\nThis echoes comments the former reality star made on Bunnie XO's Dumb Blonde podcast back in January, where she said, in part, \"Travis—even when we weren’t together—always wanted to be the 'super dad.' 'I’m the best parent. I’m the this and that,' and I’m like, 'bro, you win.' Like, you’re the winner here. You have all the money and you have all this. You’re the winner.\"\n\nAfter this ^ interview, a friend of Kravis's told People that \"Travis and Kourtney don't pay attention to what Shanna's doing. They're so happy in life right now.\"\n\nA source also recently told the Daily Mail that \"Travis wants to move on from all the endless chatter and anything she says negatively about him or Kourtney. Travis has formed an emotional callus after all these years. He only wants to do what is right for their kids, but every time she talks about him he just gets frustrated that she bashes him. He is acting the way he does with his kids because that is their relationship, it is not to one-up Shanna. Kourtney only respects her since she is the mother of his children, but a friendship is out of the question.\"\n\nThe insider then added the following: \"They both try to go through their day not thinking about her, but when she opens her mouth to give them shit, it is a temporary annoyance that they have to just let roll off of them. They refuse to let her words consume them no matter how outlandish.\"\n\nWell! Then!!!"
