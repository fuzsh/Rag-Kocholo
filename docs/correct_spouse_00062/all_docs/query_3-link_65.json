What in the world is happening, time is twirling so fast and I can't believe you are 45!!!\" Kris, 68, captioned the Instagram post. \"It seems like just the other day you were wearing your 5 year old party hat going to Buckley to be the line leader and I was bringing cupcakes for the class to celebrate.\"\n\n\"Well you have grown into the most beautiful and amazing daughter, wife, mommy, sister, auntie and best friend a girl can have,\" she continued. \"You are a kick ass business boss and I am so proud of you every day!

The topper refers to the viral insult lobbed at Kourtney by Kim, who previously called her older sister \"the least exciting to look at\" during an episode of their former reality show, Keeping Up with the Kardashians.\n\nThe other cakes read \"Aries Baby\" and \"Just Living Life,\" a saying Kourtney often uses on the family's Hulu show.\n\nIt's a fitting celebration for Kourtney whose had an exciting several months: the reality star welcomed her and Travis' bundle of joy on Nov. 1. The baby boy joins Travis' children -- son Landon, 20, and daughter Alabama, 18, whom he shares with ex-wife Shanna Moakler, and stepdaughter Atiana De La Hoya -- as well as Kourtney's three kids, whom she shares with ex-Scott Disick -- sons Mason, 14, and Reign, 9, and daughter Penelope, 11.\n\nA source told ET back in January that Kourt \"is beyond elated since welcoming Rocky.\"\n\n\"Spending time as a big family with their new addition has been amazing for Kourtney and Travis,\" the source said of the pair's blended family. \"Kourtney‚Äôs family is so excited for her, and they already love Rocky so much. They‚Äôve been showering Rocky with love and soaking up this time together.\"\n\nThe source also said that Travis seamlessly transitioned into his role as a father once again, sharing, \"Travis has always been a great dad, which is one of the reasons Kourtney was so drawn to him at the beginning of their relationship, and seeing him in this role again in a different way has been very special. They're doing great as a couple and continuing to be there for each other in this new chapter.\""
