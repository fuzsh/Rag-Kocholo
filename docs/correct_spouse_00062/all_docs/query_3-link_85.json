        "text": "Kourtney Kardashian Barker gave birth this week to her first child with husband Travis Barker, according to two sources close to Kardashian Barker.\n\nKardashian Barker, who married the Blink-182 drummer last year and announced her pregnancy in June, welcomed a baby boy.\n\nThe couple had documented Kardashian Barker’s struggle to get pregnant on the Hulu television series “The Kardashians.” The show followed her journey as she started IVF treatments. She later announced that she had stopped the process and would leave her family planning in God’s hands.\n\nIn September, Kardashian Barker underwent “urgent fetal surgery” and credited her doctors with saving her baby’s life. Several Blink-182 shows were postponed and Barker briefly left the tour to be with his wife.\n\n“As someone who has had three really easy pregnancies in the past, I wasn’t prepared for the fear of rushing into urgent fetal surgery,” she wrote on Instagram at the time. “I don’t think anyone who hasn’t been through a similar situation can begin to understand that feeling of fear.”\n\nKardashian Barker, a reality television star and founder of lifestyle and wellness company Poosh, revealed her pregnancy by re-creating a scene from a Blink-182 video. While in the audience at one of the band’s shows, she held up a giant handwritten sign that read “Travis I’m pregnant.”\n\nThe moment, captured on video and shared on her Instagram page, was a reenactment of Blink-182’s 1999 video for the hit song “All the Small Things,” in which a woman does the same thing.\n\nA stunned Barker jumped down from the stage and hugged and kissed his wife."
