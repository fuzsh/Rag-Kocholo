        "text": "Do you remember where you were when you found out your fave Blink-182 member Travis Barker and Kourtney Kardashian were rumored to be dating?? Same. At first, there was shock and disbelief. But after multiple outlets reported that Travis and Kourtney had been longtime friends (aaaaand the fact that they’re legit married and absolutely THIRIVING now), their relationship seems truly meant to be!\n\nWe’ve compiled all the details of their ’ship through FBI-levels of snooping for your pleasure, so read it and weep, below.\n\nEditor’s note: This timeline is in reverse chronological order, meaning that the newest and juiciest updates are at the tippy-top. Happy scrolling!\n\nJuly 6, 2024\n\nThe couple takes part in Travis's inaugural Run Travis Run 5K event in Inglewood only eight months (!!!!) after Kourtney gave birth to their first bb together. \"My wife’s a beast!\" Travis gushes to Page Six about the feat. \"She’s never done this. She thinks I’m crazy because some mornings I’ll wake up and she’ll be like, ‘Where are you going?’ I’m like, ‘I heard there’s a 5K, babe, I’m gonna run it.’\"\n\nJuly 2, 2024\n\nJune 16, 2024\n\nKourtney posts the sweetest tribute to Travis in honor of Father's Day:\n\nMay 30, 2025\n\nThe May 30 episode of The Kardashians sees Khloé visiting Kourtney while her oldest sister is on bedrest during her third trimester. \"Did you see my blood vial in there?\" the Poosh founder asks Khloé, who replies, \"What? No.\"\n\n\"Gotta see the blood,\" she adds as she looks at items spread out on a table for the second time. \"It's a real thing of blood?\" the Good American founder asks in disbelief once she finds it. \"What was the point?\"\n\n\"Just to, like, have each other's,\" Kourt replies.\n\nIn a later confessional, Khloé muses, \"To want to show off your blood vials is also like, alright, if that's what you're into. But it's very, like, Billy Bob Thornton of them. In my every minute of the day, do I want to be like, harnessing a tube of blood? Not for me.\"\n\nHonestly living for this exchange. 😂\n\nMay 23, 2024\n\nDuring the season 5 premiere episode of The Kardashians, Kourt reveals she contracted COVID from Travis during her pregnancy after the two returned home from touring Europe with Blink-182 and made out \"for six hours\" (the musician had taken a test and got a negative result beforehand).\n\nIt was then that the reality star noticed Travis was \"hot. Like, his head feels very warm.\"\n\n\"Not a making-out type of warm. Like really warm,\" the Poosh founder recalls, adding that her husband took a second COVID test and discovered he was positive. And thanks to \"that first six hours of just making out, I got COVID,\" says Kourtney, who then adds that the news came on the morning of her Disney Land-themed baby shower.\n\nThey ultimately didn't call the event off, because according to Kris Jenner, \"The shower starts in 20 minutes, right? So I think it's crazy to call 50 guests or 100 people and go, don't come. With all this beautiful food and everything going on here that you guys have worked for two days putting it together, I think everybody who comes by has breakfast. Some things, you just don't have any control of, and the most important thing today is Kourtney's health and making sure her and the baby are OK.\"\n\nA refresher that Kourtney and Travis welcomed their son Rocky in November 2023. So happy for them!\n\nApril 20, 2024\n\nA source dishes to People that Travis treats Kourtney \"like a queen\" and that the Poosh founder has found \"much more of an inner peace\" since they began their relationship.\n\n\"She enjoys a lot of family time and work very much comes second,\" the insider notes before adding, \"She seems calmer, much happier, and content with life. Travis is amazing. He treats Kourtney like a queen. They talk about growing old together—it’s very cute!\"\n\nLove their love!\n\nApril 19, 2024\n\nIn honor of Kourt's milestone 45th birthday, Travis pens a touching Instagram tribute that reads, \"Happy Birthday to my beautiful wife, soulmate and best friend forever. I love you, I love our life together. Thank you for being the most amazing wife a person could ask for. Here’s to many more years of adventures together ❤️‍🔥.\"\n\nMarch 24, 2024\n\nKourtney takes to Instagram to post a series of loved-up pics of herself and Travis. Ahem:\n\nFebruary 27, 2024\n\nThe celebs—who btw are in Australia while Travis is on tour with Blink-182—share a buncha snaps from the National Gallery of Victoria in Melbourne.\n\nPersonally obsessed with this \"iykyk\" one shared by Kourt:\n\nBut our absolute fave pic is one the reality star shares of herself and Travis resting their heads on each other as they look up at a neon sign that reads, \"You put your hand across my mouth but still the noise continues. Every part of my body is screaming smashed into a thousand million pieces each part for ever belonging to you.\"\n\nWe're not crying you, you are!\n\nFebruary 14, 2024\n\nThe musician posts a v Kravis-coded Valentine's Day carousel. Ahem:\n\nJanuary 18, 2024\n\n\"Rocky's parents\" is an iconic caption, just saying:\n\nJanuary 15, 2024\n\nKravis make their first post-baby red carpet appearance, and yep: they're back at it with the PDA:\n\nDecember 22, 2023\n\nKourt and Travis share the first pics of Rocky and he is soooo cute:\n\nDecember 14, 2023\n\nA source tells Entertainment Tonight that \"Kourtney and Travis are over the moon and could not be more elated that they share a child of their own together. Kourtney and Travis already had an unbreakable bond, but having a baby together has brought them even closer and made them fall even more in love. This experience has solidified their feelings that they were destined to be together.\"\n\nNovember 5, 2023\n\nAccording to People, sources say that Kravis’s baby has officially been born (specifically on November 1)! However, neither Kourtney or Travis publicly announce Baby Barker’s arrival.\n\nOctober 31, 2023\n\nDuring an appearance on the One Life One Chance podcast, Travis dished on Baby Barker’s name and due date. Travis revealed that the baby’s name is Rocky Thirteen and that his due date is “either Halloween or, like, the first week of November.” Obsessed with Kravis keeping the crazy celeb baby name train running.\n\nAugust 2, 2023\n\nKravis is clearly still thriving, and we’re living for every moment. On August 2, the couple seemingly took a trip to their stomping grounds in Santa Barbara—aka where they got engaged in 2021.\n\nKourt wished her followers a “good morning” on her Instagram Stories before posting a series of stunning footage from her romantic getaway with Travis. The clips included a pan of the oceanfront view and a shot of the couple basking in the California sun. Per E! News, she also posted gorgeous views of the moon hanging above the ocean, the sandy beach, and a pink vintage car in front of some palm trees. Travis also posted a peaceful video of the night sky during their dreamy vacay.\n\nJune 17, 2023\n\nTravis and Kourtney reveal they are expecting their first child together!!!!!!\n\nA source later tells Entertainment Tonight, “Kourtney and Travis are on cloud nine. This pregnancy is beyond Kourtney’s wildest dreams. Kourtney and Travis feel like this is one of the most magical things to happen to them and a complete miracle. They are so thrilled and can’t wait to experience this pregnancy together, bring a baby into the world as a unit, and expand and grow their families.”\n\nApril 13, 2023\n\nKourt and Travis share an intimate, behind-the-scenes look at their weddings in the Hulu special . During one moment, we even get an inside look at the night the two got married in Vegas. Turns out, the Elvis impersonator who officiated the wedding messed up Kourtney’s name and told Travis to say, “I, Travis, take you, Khloé, to be my wife.” In response, Kourtney fell to the ground and laughed, saying, “I’m gonna cry. Wait, we need to FaceTime Khloé, we need to FaceTime her. She’s gonna literally die.”\n\nThe couple also open up about their wedding in Italy, including how mom Kris Jenner gave Kourtney her wedding ring from late husband Robert Kardashian. “When my dad died, I remember thinking I never want to get married because my dad isn’t there to walk me down the aisle,” the eldest Kardashian explains. “So that gift meant so much.” I’m not crying, you are!\n\nApril 4, 2023\n\nThe duo celebrate the first anniversary of the time they did that whole wedding in Vegas thing right after they attended the 2022 Grammy Awards and had “too much tequila,” according to the reality star.\n\n“It was one of the best nights of our lives, dreaming of a lifetime filled with fun adventures together. And yes, that’s me about to throw up on the floor in the car,” reads the caption in part.\n\nIn the comments, the drummer responds and writes, “Kourtney you’re my hunk a hunk burning love. ❤️‍🔥” S’cute!\n\nFebruary 14, 2023\n\nTrav marks his first Valentine’s Day married to Kourt by sharing the sweetest carousel of photos of himself and the reality star on Instagram. Just some of the moments included in the post? The two of them posing in front of picturesque mountains, lounging around, and a bed full of rose petals in the shape of a heart. “First Valentine’s Day with you as my wife. I love you,” the musician gushes in the caption.\n\nJanuary 22, 2023\n\nTravis debuts a new tattoo of Kourt’s eyes on his upper thigh (gonna have to swipe through to see it):\n\nOctober 17, 2022\n\nKravis are caught celebrating their anniversary (and re-creating Travis’s proposal!) by Rebel Wilson, lol:\n\nOctober 10, 2022\n\nKravis kick off their favorite season (spooky, obviously) by celebrating Travis’s son Landon Barker’s birthday in full black tie:\n\nSeptember 11, 2022\n\nKravis attend the Tommy Hilfiger show looking all kinds of in love.\n\nAugust 25, 2022\n\nKourt and Travis show up at Kylie Jenner’s party for Kylie Cosmetics x Ulta Beauty, and they’re obviously hand in hand (can never! not be! touching!):\n\nAugust 13, 2022\n\nTravis goes on tour following his health scare, and Kourtney is right by his side. Also, they’re just as horny as ever.\n\nJuly 8, 2022\n\nA source tells E! News that Travis is back at home and “feeling much better” and that “Kourtney took action immediately when he was in pain, and he’s really thankful. It was definitely an eye-opening experience for the whole family, and they are all rallying around Travis.”\n\nThe source also notes that Travis’s hospitalization was “really emotional and scary” for Kourt and that Travis is “forever grateful for her being by his side.”\n\nJuly 2, 2022\n\nFollowing news of Travis’s hospitalization on June 29, he and Kourtney release statements thanking fans for their support and explaining that Travis was suffering from “life-threatening pancreatitis.”\n\n“Oh, what a scary and emotional week it has been,” Kourtney said in her statement. “Our health is everything and sometimes we take for granted how quickly it can change. Travis and I went in for a routine endoscopy together and he ended up with severe, life-threatening pancreatitis. I am so grateful to God for healing my husband, for all of your prayers for him and for us, for the overwhelming outpouring of love and support. I am so touched and appreciative. I am so thankful to our specialists, doctors, and nurses at Cedars Sinai for taking such wonderful care of my husband and me during our stay.”\n\nKourtney also sent a message to paparazzi who sold old photos and tried to pass them off as current during Travis’s hospitalization. “And to the paparazzi who sold pictures of me ‘out and about’ while my husband was in the hospital fighting for his life…these were photos actually taken weeks ago (I can’t even remember the last time I wore that sweatsuit in the photos)…I didn’t forget about you,” she said. “A new level of low, monetizing off of our nightmare. Really savagely uncool when I actually didn’t leave his side…shame on you.”\n\nJune 20, 2022\n\nKourtney throws Travis a sweet and intimate Father’s Day party with his kids, and she says “You deserve the world and more” when he thanks her on Insta.\n\nMay 22, 2022\n\nKourt goes ahead and changes her name on Insta:\n\nMay 22, 2022\n\nKravis get married 2.0! The couple has an extravagant Italian wedding in Portofino and Kourt wears a stunning veil embroidered with Travis’s head tattoo:\n\nMay 15, 2022\n\nKravis get married! Again! And this time, it’s for real. Photos of the couple in a car with “Just Married” on it drop on TMZ, which reports that Kourt and Trav “got the legal paperwork in order Sunday—so they are, in fact, married now.” The outlet also notes that they are “having an actual wedding ceremony in Italy in the near future.” Meanwhile, a source tells People, “They had to legally get married first ahead of their big Italian wedding, which is happening very soon. All the details are set and the whole family, including all the kids, are very excited.”\n\nMay 4, 2022\n\nThe Kardashians airs the BTS of Kravis’s engagement, including Kris Jenner’s emotional speech at their post-proposal dinner!\n\nMay 2, 2022\n\nKravis make their debut at the Met Gala in matching outfits, no less.\n\nAnd yes, there’s PDA:\n\nApril 17, 2022\n\nTravis tells a follower trolling him that he, ahem, “still got the finger up the ass, and my intestines, were totally nude and full PDA with my fiancée.” Kay!\n\nApril 6, 2022\n\nKourt shuts down Jimmy Kimmel when he calls her “fake married,” saying, “Well, it’s not called fake married. There was no, like, possibility to get a marriage license at that hour,” explaining that she tried her best to get one. “I’m like, ‘Are you guys lying?’ We asked, like, five times, ‘What do we have to do to make this happen?’ It was 2 a.m. and they were like, ‘It opens at 8 o’clock.’”\n\nApril 5, 2022\n\nNews breaks that KRAVIS ARE MARRIED! The couple tied the knot on Grammys night in Las Vegas, and their wedding was officiated by an Elvis impersonator. Like…truly iconic.\n\nApril 3, 2022\n\nKravis make a surprise appearance at the Grammy Awards, and this was the vibe:\n\nMarch 27, 2022\n\nKourtney and Travis hit the Oscars! And make out on the red carpet, as ya do.\n\nMarch 14, 2022\n\nOn March 14, Hulu dropped a trailer for the Kardashians’ new reality show and it included some major Kravis news: They want to grow their blended family.\n\n“Travis and I want to have a baby,” Kourtney says in the trailer, which includes a scene showing the couple at a doctor’s office being asked for a sample (!!!).\n\nMarch 10, 2022\n\nBeing engaged and *almost* married has not done anything to cool off Kourtney and Travis’s red-hot PDA. Case in point: In early March, TMZ published pics of a very steamy and *very* public make-out sesh Kourt and Travis enjoyed (whilst rolling around in the sand, no less) in Laguna Beach, California. The PDA was so intense, in fact, that a family that was also hanging out on the beach at the time actually reportedly asked them to cool it (which Kourtney and Travis did—by hopping in the ocean to continue enjoying their love bubble).\n\nThe next day, Kourtney posted pictures and video from the outing on Instagram that confirmed just how horny they were for each other during the beach day:\n\nFebruary 18, 2022\n\nBy late February, reports were circulating that Kourtney and Travis were *considering* growing their family. Neither Kourtney nor Travis has talked about having more kids together publicly, but a source close to the pair told Entertainment Tonight that they are “open to the idea of having children together and growing their family” and that “their families are both supportive of it too and just want them to be happy.”\n\nFebruary 14, 2022\n\nTravis went all out for Valentine’s Day, surprising Kourtney with a giant statue of Mickey and Minnie gazing at each other with love, surrounded by ALL THE ROSES.\n\nJanuary 2022\n\nAs 2022 kicked off, Kravis insiders started teasing details of the couple’s wedding planning process, including the fact that they planned to keep the event small and intimate and that they were eyeing spring dates for the big day.\n\nDecember 18, 2021\n\nOver the holidays, Travis and Kourtney took a blended family trip to Disneyland with two of their sons, Landon and Reign.\n\nNovember 14, 2021\n\nKourtney and Travis took their love to the chapel—for Simon Huck and Phil Riportella’s wedding. But still.\n\nOctober 31, 2021\n\nTravis and Kourtney revealed their True Romance Halloween costumes on Instagram—which caused a bit of drama with Travis’s ex Shanna Moakler. When a fan commented to Shanna that it was “odd” that Kravis were bonding over the movie that was “your and his thing when you were married,” Shanna replied, “It’s like an episode of Punk’d. 😂”\n\nThe next day, Kourtney shared pics of her and Travis in their second Halloween couples costume—a perfect recreation of Winona Ryder’s and Johnny Depp’s characters in Edward Scissorhands.\n\nOctober 17, 2021\n\nTravis and Kourtney are engaged! Travis proposed in Montecito on the beach and—duh—Kourtney said yes. Pics or it didn’t happen? Here ya go:\n\nSeptember 12, 2021\n\nAmid all the Scott-Younes drama, Kourtney and Travis make their first public appearance as a couple at the 2021 MTV VMAs—where Travis performed with Machine Gun Kelly.\n\nTheir vibe on the carpet? What do you think?!\n\nAugust 31, 2021\n\nKourtney’s ex Younes Bendjima leaks a DM he got from Scott Disick, in which Scott called out Kravis’s PDA, saying, “Yo is this chick ok!???? Broooo like what is this. In the middle of Italy.”\n\nNot a great look, and apparently, Kourtney was unimpressed.\n\nAugust 29, 2021\n\nTravis and Kourtney head to Italy and spend most of their time being adorable and making out:\n\nAugust 17, 2021\n\nTravis reveals that he and Kourtney have taken their first flight together as a couple. This marks Travis’s first time on a plane since surviving a crash in 2008, which tragically killed his security guard, Charles Still, his assistant, Chris Baker, and the plane’s two pilots.\n\nJuly 15, 2021\n\nFans briefly spiral thinking Kourtney and Travis got engaged in Vegas thanks to THIS POST and some evidence you can read about right this way:\n\nJuly 10, 2021\n\nKourtney and Travis fully make out on camera at the UFC 264 match. It’s a lot!\n\nJune 21, 2021\n\nKravis spend a cute lil beach weekend with their families:\n\nJune 19, 2021\n\nKourtney and Travis make out in the studio with MGK lurking in the background:\n\nJune 9, 2021\n\nKourt’s on the fence about getting engaged right now, but the good news? It’s “likely” a possibility, a source detailed to Entertainment Tonight.\n\nET’s source says, “Kourtney and Travis really recognize now more than ever how special their relationship is and how fortunate they are to spend their time together whether it’s just the two of them, with friends, or with their families. They could also definitely see themselves ending up together one day and it’s really whatever makes Kourtney happy.” More than anything, they’re “just living in the moment and enjoying each day.”\n\nAnd even better news: “Building a future together in a more permanent respect could likely happen,” that source adds.\n\nJune 8, 2021\n\nKourtney casually posts a vial of Travis’s blood on Instagram. Yes, it’s a little disturbing!\n\nMay 13, 2021\n\nMore engagement updates about Kourtney and Travis start rolling in—and it turns out that it’s a little more complicated than Travis just popping the question.\n\nA source tells Entertainment Tonight that “getting engaged and married one day has definitely been a topic of conversation between Kourtney and Travis. Travis would absolutely love to tie the knot with Kourtney, but Kourtney hasn’t been sure that’s the step she wants to take in their relationship right now. She is extraordinarily happy and doesn’t feel the need or want the pressure of getting married.”\n\nPer ET’s source, Kourtney’s a little hesitant because “there are a lot of other factors that concern her” if she and Travis marry, “one of them being Scott [Disick] and, more importantly, her kids and what that adjustment would mean for them. It could be a lot to process, even though everyone sees that Kourtney is undeniably in love with Travis. Kourtney sees herself loving this moment and is just taking everything one day at a time and enjoying their time together.”\n\nThe source does make a point to say that Kourt’s hesitation has nothing to do with how she actually feels about Travis. For the record, “Travis makes Kourtney laugh uncontrollably and she loves that he always brings a smile to her face. She also really loves that Travis is such a great, hands-on dad. Travis loves that Kourtney has such an entrepreneurial spirit and that she is a strong, independent mom. They feel like they’re the perfect match.”\n\nAs for how things are going between Kourt and Scott? Yeah…an E! News source says, “Scott and Kourtney have a tense relationship right now primarily because he’s been focusing on his new life in Miami and because of Kourtney getting serious with Travis. They are barely speaking. It’s hard for him to see Kourtney in love with someone else.”\n\nMay 12, 2021\n\nHow are the Kardashians reacting to Kourtney and Travis’s love parade, you ask? Welp, “Kourtney’s family is happy for her, but they’re also in a little bit of shock because they’ve never seen her like this before,” according to Entertainment Tonight. Honestly? Same!\n\nAnd it doesn’t seem like the two have plans to stop anytime either. “They’re so in love and constantly fawning over one another,” ET’s source says. “They have such a strong connection and can’t get enough of each other.”\n\n“Travis makes Kourtney feel so special and he is always showing her how much he loves her and how important she is to him,” the source continues. “Kourtney has been extremely loving toward him as well and has also been making a big effort to show how much she cares.”\n\nSpeaking of loving, Kourt actually tattoos the words “I love you” on Travis’s arm. You know, just in case he wasn’t 100 percent sure:\n\nMay 5, 2021\n\nWelp, don’t be surprised if Kourt and Trav start sporting bling on that finger soon, because a source tells Entertainment Tonight that “Kourtney and Travis are in love and have talked about their future and the possibility of getting engaged and married. Kourtney hasn’t felt this strongly about anyone in a while and can see a forever with Travis.”\n\nThe fact that their families adore each other also helps a possible marriage along quite nicely. “Although the couple hasn’t been together for a while, they’ve known each other for years and have a strong connection,” the source continues. “Kourtney’s family hasn’t seen her this happy in a while and they love Travis. The couple’s kids get along great and that has made things much easier for them.”\n\nApril 27, 2021\n\nKourtney and Travis go on vacation YET AGAIN (seriously, does the concept of a pandemic even exist to them?), this time to Utah’s Amangiri resort in Canyon Point. To mark the occasion, Kourt posts a pic of her and Travis engaging in their raunchiest PDA to date:\n\nBut wait! That’s not all—Travis is also overcome with the vacation feels and raises Kourt’s already raunchy post with a photo set with snaps and video from their stay, which just so happens to include Travis casually resting his hand on Kourtney’s butt:\n\nApril 18, 2021\n\nIt’s Kourtney’s birthday!!! And truly no one’s Instagram feed is safe because Travis posts the sappiest b-day tribute to her—a picture set that casually happens to include a video of Kourt sucking on his actual thumb (can’t believe I had to type that, wow). Yes, really:\n\nAnd since Travis just loves spoiling his best girl, he also got Kourt a massive flower bouquet of gardenias and tulips—I’m jelly!\n\n“Travis often spoils her and he gave her the most amazing, beautiful flower arrangement for her birthday,” a source tells People of the gift. “They are celebrating with her family today.”\n\n“Kourtney still seems very happy with Travis. He is very into her,” the source adds. “He constantly gives her compliments and attention. You can tell he is thrilled to be dating her. Kourtney is soaking it all up and enjoying life.” Cool, guess engagement is imminent!\n\nApril 11, 2021\n\nAaaaand Travis and Kourtney are back at it again with the thirsty Instagrams! Trav posts a photo of himself playing drums with the caption, “All day I dream about sex w/ you.” And then actually tags Kourtney in the photo. Discreet? They’ve never heard of it.\n\nApril 9, 2021\n\nAnd we have yet another big relationship milestone happening, this time courtesy of Travis! Travis is spotted on the set of a new music video with Kourtney’s name tattooed over his heart (or his left nipple, if ya wanna be more technical)—you can take a look at the ~masterpiece~ here.\n\nMeanwhile, Kourtney and Travis are being hella horny on Instagram. Kourt posts a very 👀 photo with the caption, “Watchin’ movies, but we ain’t seen a thing tonight.” Aka lyrics from Ariana Grande’s sexually charged bop “34+35.”\n\nThen Travis posts this in response:\n\nI’d tell these two to get a room, but looks like they already have!\n\nApril 3, 2021\n\nBiiig relationship milestone here—Travis and Kourtney take a trip to Utah to go snowboarding…and their entire family tags along with them! Peep the pics below:\n\nFans then learn that Travis’s and Kourtney’s kids are with them when Alabama Barker (Travis’s 15-year-old daughter) posts a “Pass the Phone” TikTok challenge video featuring her older sister and brother, Atiana De La Hoya and Landon Barker, as well as Penelope, Mason, and Reign Disick.\n\nMarch 29, 2021\n\nPandemic be damned! Travis and Kourtney attend a UFC game in Las Vegas and are seen in the VIP section engaging in some very…interesting PDA—Travis is seen sucking Kourtney’s finger in a video from Shane Handler’s Instagram Stories—which podcaster Amanda Hirsch later shares on her @NotSkinnyButNotFat Insta:\n\nWhat is even happening.\n\nMarch 22, 2021\n\nTravis and Kourt have evolved to the stage in the relationship where they’re exchanging “I love you”s. Kourtney writes a handwritten note to Travis with these three special words, which he later posts to his Instagram Stories.\n\nMarch 2, 2021\n\nAn Entertainment Tonight source gets Scott Disick’s POV on how he’s feeling about Kourtney and Travis’s relationship. In short: Scott is chilling and doesn’t think Kourtney will be pushing him out of her life anytime soon.\n\n“Scott knows he always has a special place in Kourtney’s heart and that he can’t ever be replaced and will always be in the picture since he’s the father of their children,” the source says. “He isn’t threatened by Kourtney and Travis’s relationship at this point.”\n\nFebruary 20, 2021\n\nTrav and Kourt are taking a page from the Megan Fox and Machine Gun Kelly book of romance by engaging in some serious twin flame lingo. Travis posts a note that Kourtney left him to his Instagram Stories, which reads, “To lots of fun adventures. May we destroy each other completely. Love, Kourtney.”\n\nSounds familiar? It should, because a few days earlier, Travis posted this to his Twitter:\n\nFebruary 17, 2021\n\nKourtney and Travis take the next major step in their relationship—going Instagram official, duh! Kourtney posts a pic of her holding Travis’s hand to her feed, and Travis signals his love/approval with a lil black heart emoji in the comments.\n\nFebruary 14, 2021\n\nSince COVID-19 is still very much a thing, Travis and Kourtney keep their Valentine’s Day celebrations low-key and likely spend the evening together cuddled up by a romantic outdoor fireplace, which Kourtney posts to her Instagram Stories.\n\nFebruary 10, 2021\n\nKourtney and Travis go out for dinner in Los Angeles, and they pack on the cutest PDA. Lucky for us, an E! News source dishes all the adorable details of their outing.\n\n“They seemed completely taken with one another as if they were the only two people in the world,” the source says. “They seem very connected, very close. Travis took her hand and they giggled as they started having a little thumb war with one another. It was playful and sweet. They were talking constantly and very engaged in one another. It seems like such a natural fit, being that they have been friends for so long. There was no awkwardness.”\n\nYep, too cute not to ship.\n\nFebruary 2, 2021\n\nKourt reveals that someone in her life went through the trouble of cropping her bikini-clad bod into a lock-screen photo. And although it’s pretty believable that Kourt would have her own bod as her lock screen (shoot, I def would if my abs looked that good), she makes a point to note, “P.S. This lock screen does not belong to me.”\n\nPodcast account @NotSkinnyButNotFat is the first to make the Travis connection here, theorizing that it’s actually his lock screen (which checks out, TBH):\n\nJanuary 24, 2021\n\nUs Weekly drops the news we’ve been waiting for—Travis and Kourtney are indeed dating! “Kourtney and Travis are officially a couple,” a source tells the outlet. “They have been close friends for years and have been dating for a couple months. Travis is very smitten with Kourtney and has been for a while.”\n\nYeah, and about those poolside Palm Springs pictures (try saying that five times fast)? “They’re in Palm Springs together. They’ve been dating for about a month or two,” a separate source tells People. “They’ve been friends for a long time but it’s turned romantic.”\n\nJanuary 23, 2021\n\nFans of Travis and Kourtney notice that their faves’ Instagram activity looks kiiinda sus. Kourt posts this picture of the poolside view from Kris Jenner’s home in Palm Springs:\n\nTravis also posts a daytime pic of the same poolside view, which naturally makes people wonder if he and Kourtney are dating:\n\nJanuary 21, 2021\n\nKourtney posts a very 🔥 picture to the ’gram, and Travis fawns over it in the comments, giving her the virtual equivalent of a red rose. Suspicions about their relationship status arise!\n\nMarch 14, 2019\n\nBy mid-March of 2019, the dating speculation was getting enough traction that Travis was asked about it on the red carpet at the 2019 iHeartRadio Music Awards.\n\n“Kourtney’s like a dear friend. That’s it,” he said. “I mean, I love her to death. I love her family to death. But yeah, just friends.”\n\nMarch 5, 2019\n\nWithin a couple of weeks of their Nobu Malibu dinner, romance rumors were a ~thing~. RadarOnline reported that even though Kourtney and Travis publicly claimed to be just friends, “something more” was developing IRL.\n\n“Ever since Kourt has been single, they’ve gotten closer and closer—to the point where he sneakily stays at her place now,” a source told the site.\n\nThe Radar report claimed that Travis had “always” been interested in Kourtney and that she was finally “really falling for him” too.\n\n“Their friendship is definitely turning romantic, which has taken her by surprise,” an “insider” explained.\n\nFebruary 17, 2019\n\nA few months later, Kourtney and Travis made headlines again when they went to dinner together (and with some other ppl) at Nobu in Malibu.\n\n“They had dinner at Nobu with the kids because they are friendly. It was a family dinner. They’ve been friends for years. They’ve lived in the same neighborhood for a long time and they see each other at church and with their kids,” a source told E! News at the time. “They’ve hung out together many times and often get together with the kids to see movies or to get ice cream. They always have fun together. He’s a nice guy and their kids really get along well. Kourtney has his kids over for playdates and vice versa.”\n\nAt the time, the E! source described their relationship in very platonic terms, saying, “They have a really nice friendship.”\n\nSeptember 19, 2018\n\nIn September 2018, the first inklings of a potential romance between Kourtney and Travis hit the internet when they were both spotted having dinner at vegan restaurant Crossroads Kitchen in Los Angeles. According to a report from Metro at the time, the sighting came just a month after Travis was rumored to have slid into Kourt’s DMs.\n\nAccording to Metro’s report, Kourtney and Travis sipped matcha teas together and then Travis “proved to be a true gentleman” when he walked her to her car, where they talked for a while before finally saying goodnight. The Metro article also says Kourtney “shared a telling Instagram Story of what appeared to be Travis’s tattooed hand playing with a miniature fake hand” and then “stroked the rocker showing just how comfortable she was with her companion.” Eyebrows. Raised.\n\nOctober 20, 2015\n\nTravis confesses that he definitely had a crush on Kourtney’s younger sister Kim Kardashian back in 2006. Despite dating Kim’s employer—hotel heiress Paris Hilton—Travis says he couldn’t keep his eyes off her (which is kinda awk now, LOL).\n\n“How could you not stare at Kim? Mind you, I enjoyed hanging out with Paris, but I love curvy girls,” he tells Us Weekly at the time. “Kim was eye candy. I was in no way disrespectful to Paris, but I couldn’t keep my eyes off Kim!”\n\n“I had a crush on her and we were flirtatious but nothing ever happened,” Travis adds. “I don’t know! She was so kind and polite, I just felt like being a perfect gentleman around her. It was a trip!”\n\nAnd not to alarm you or anything, but Travis is pretty much the reason Keeping Up With the Kardashians is a thing. In 2005, Travis’s own reality show, Meet the Barkers, was on television, which is why Kim hit him up for advice.\n\n“Kim was like, ‘I really want to do this reality show. We’re supposed to do it with Ryan Seacrest. I just think my family’s interesting,’” Travis recalls. “I gave her the best advice I could but I still remember the conversation like yesterday: ‘I think my family is interesting and it could be something.’ Well, you were absolutely right!” Travis and Kim remain close throughout the aughts, and he becomes super close to the rest of the fam since they all live in Calabasas, California. And the rest, as they say, is history.\n\nThat’s all we have for Travis and Kourtney’s timeline, but be sure to check back here for additional Instagram Stories and cute updates about their ’ship!"
