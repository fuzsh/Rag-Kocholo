        "text": "Travis Barker’s ex-wife Shanna Moakler is fed up. The former Miss USA is once again trying to set the record straight on her relationship with her family, and she’s not mincing words.\n\n“I’m not a deadbeat mom,” she told People. Moakler, who shares daughter Atiana De La Hoya with ex Oscar De La Hoya and Alabama Barker and Landon Barker with Barker said that, aside from during the COVID-19 lockdown, she has “been present” in her kids’ lives. Her comments come after\n\n“I have a very close relationship with my children who are now adults,” she continued.\n\nThe comments come after Alabama, 18 and Landon, 20 previously “liked” a post on Instagram that called out bad moms. According to Moakler, the two have “taken back what they said [and apologized].”\n\nAs for Moakler’s relationship with Barker and his wife Kourtney Kardashian, well, that’s a different story. “I don’t have a relationship with Travis, but I think that’s OK,” she said. “I don’t feel like it’ll be like that forever, but I feel like right now — I think that’s where we are at in our evolution, and maybe in the future, it’ll change.”\n\nThe break in communication seemingly happened after Moakler spoke on Bunnie XO’s podcast at the beginning of the year and called the Kardashians “disgusting.”\n\n“I removed myself so that they couldn’t bond over my children hating me,” she said.\n\nNearly six months later, her feelings about the Kardashians and how they’ve impacted her life and her image don’t seem to have changed.\n\n“I’m more than just the ex-wife of famous men. I was Miss USA at 19. I’m smart. Every part I’ve ever got in any movie, or every show I hosted or auditioned for, I worked my f*cking a** off to get,” she emphasizes. “I also don’t have to like the f*cking Kardashians, and I’m honestly sick of talking about them.”\n\nBack in 2022, a few months before the Blink-182 drummer and the Lemme founder tied the knot, Moakler said she had one condition as her three kids got ready to have a new step-family. “As long as the Kardashians are good to my kids, that’s all that matters to me as a mom,” she said at the time.\n\n“My children are my first priority, and that’s one thing that I think Travis and I do agree on,” she continued. “That’s probably the only thing we agree on, but our children come first and their happiness.”"
