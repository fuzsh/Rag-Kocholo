        "text": "Travis Barker’s family got a whole lot bigger when he married Kourtney Kardashian.\n\nThe couple’s May 2022 wedding gave the Blink-182 drummer three stepchildren, joining his own two kids with ex-wife Shanna Moakler plus the stepdaughter he helped raise while married to the model from 2004 to 2008.\n\nThe brood got even bigger the following year when Barker and Kardashian welcomed their first child together.\n\nThe couple announced in June 2023 that they had a baby on the way when Kardashian debuted her bump at a concert.\n\nFive months later, she gave birth to son Rocky.\n\nSo, who are Barker’s children and stepkids? Meet Landon, Alabama, Atiana, Mason, Penelope, Reign and Rocky below.\n\nLandon Asher Barker\n\nLandon, taken from his father’s middle name, was born on Oct. 9, 2003, as the rocker’s first child with Moakler.\n\nIn April 2005, the toddler made his television debut on the now-former couple’s MTV reality series, “Meet the Barkers.”\n\nOutside of their family’s show, Landon remained relatively under the radar until he began pursuing a rap career under the name OTG Landon, OTG standing for “on the grind.”\n\nHe dropped his first single “Don’t Need Her” in October 2018 and has hit the stage with his father several times over the years, with Barker praising his son’s first solo show in February 2022.\n\n“Proud of you son,” he captioned a photo of himself hugging Landon during the gig at the Roxy Theatre in West Hollywood.\n\nLandon was rumored to have briefly dated social media star Devenity Perkins in 2016. He is currently seeing another social media influencer, Charli D’Amelio, with whom he stepped out for the first time at a Fourth of July bash in the Hamptons in July 2022.\n\nAlabama Luella Barker\n\nBarker’s second child with Moakler, daughter Alabama, was born on Dec. 24, 2005.\n\nLike her big brother, Alabama made her TV debut on “Meet the Barkers,” but she was only introduced in the series finale in February 2006.\n\nAt just 12 years old, Alabama released her first pop single, “Our House,” in October 2017.\n\n“She’s seen everything from punk-rock tours to the most extravagant awards shows like the Grammys, so she’s seen it all … and she’s great in the studio,” Barker told KTLA of her potential at the time. “She has amazing studio etiquette, and she’s a really hard worker.”\n\nShe followed up her debut with “Heartbreaker” in October 2018.\n\nWhile Alabama has never publicly addressed her relationships, she was rumored to have dated TikTok user @girlzluhdev, who commented, “❤️muah” on a clip of the pair together in February 2022.\n\nAtiana Cecelia De La Hoya\n\nAtiana, Moakler’s daughter from her previous relationship with boxer Oscar De La Hoya, was born on March 29, 1999.\n\nHer parents began dating in October 1997, got engaged one year later and broke up in September 2000 when De La Hoya was seen with another woman at the Latin Grammy Awards.\n\nShe was also featured on “Meet the Barkers” as a child, growing closer to her stepdad over the years and often praising him as a father figure while remaining close to her biological dad.\n\nAtiana has worked as a model since the age of 14 and joined a Lifetime reality show in August 2017 called “Growing Up Supermodel.”\n\nShe has since been featured on “MasterChef Celebrity Family Showdown” and served as a bridesmaid in Barker’s Italian wedding on “The Kardashians.”\n\nAs for her love life, the brunette beauty has stayed out of the spotlight.\n\nMason Dash Disick, Penelope Scotland Disick and Reign Aston Disick\n\nBarker picked up three more stepchildren in Mason, Penelope and Reign after marrying Kardashian in May 2022.\n\nAre you keeping up? More on the Kardashians:\n\nKardashian-Jenner family net worth\n\nThe Kardashian-Jenner family tree\n\nUnforgettable “Keeping Up With the Kardashians” moments\n\nThe reality star welcomed son Mason on Dec. 14, 2009, daughter Penelope on July 8, 2012, and youngest son Reign on Dec. 14, 2014, with Scott Disick, whom she dated for nearly 10 years before dumping the Talentless founder in July 2015.\n\nBarker and Kardashian have seamlessly integrated their families, frequently taking trips together and developing stronger bonds as their union solidifies.\n\nRocky 13 Barker\n\nAfter Kardashian and Barker stopped pursuing in vitro fertilization and “no longer even thought about” expanding their family, they conceived naturally, the reality star told Vanity Fair in October 2023.\n\nShe called their pregnancy news “God’s plan.”"
