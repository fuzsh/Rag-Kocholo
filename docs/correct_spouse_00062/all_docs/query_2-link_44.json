        "text": "TRAVIS Barker's ex-wife has shared her thoughts and feelings over the surprise news Kourtney Kardashian is pregnant.\n\nShanna Moakler was married to the Blink-182 drummer for three years.\n\nTravis and Shanna were married from October 2004 to February 2008. They share two children: Landon, 19, and Alabama, 17.\n\nNot long after Kourtney revealed her big baby news, Shanna was asked on Instagram for her reaction.\n\n\"Thoughts on the new baby?\" one fan asked over a photo of Shanna hanging in her hot tub in a revealing swimsuit.\n\nShanna shared she was happy for the couple: \"Very excited for them, hope they have a great experience bringing in a new life to the world.\"\n\nThe former Playboy Playmate even revealed she had known the bombshell news for awhile.\n\n\"I've known for weeks,\" she shot back to another follower with the same question. \"This is not new news to me.\"\n\nBABY ON BOARD\n\nIt was sure news to Travis.\n\nKourtney shared her pregnancy with the world at the same time that she told her husband, which was from the crowd at a Blink-182 concert in Los Angeles.\n\nShe made the reveal by holding a sign that read, \"Travis I'm pregnant\" - a nod to the band's iconic All The Small Things video in which an attractive groupie held up a similar sign while rocking out to the music.\n\nIt brought the gig to a halt as a stunned Travis left his drum kit to celebrate with his wife, standing in front of the stage.\n\nThe pair shared a cuddle and kiss as the crowd went wild.\n\nFrontman Mark Hoppus ensured everyone in the stadium knew what was happening as Kourtney and Travis had their special moment.\n\nRumors have been swirling for months that the couple was expecting, and they have been open about wanting to expand their brood.\n\nHAPPY ENDING\n\nKourtney is already mother to: Mason, 13; Penelope, 10; and Reign, eight, with Scott.\n\nDuring Season 2 of The Kardashians, Kourtney opened up about her attempts to get pregnant - including IVF.\n\n“Travis and I want to have a baby, and so my doctor took us down this road of doing IVF,” Kourtney said in a confessional during one episode.\n\n“Like, it hasn’t been the most amazing experience,\" she added.\n\nKourtney eventually finished IVF after suffering setbacks with the process, but in December 2022, an insider close to the pair exclusively confirmed to The U.S. Sun that they were \"still trying\" to conceive, despite the difficulties.\n\nThe source said: \"Travis and Kourtney would still love a baby together. They're still trying.\n\n\"She took a break from IVF, but that doesn't mean plans changed.\"\n\nThe insider concluded: \"They're hoping to welcome a baby in the near future.\""
