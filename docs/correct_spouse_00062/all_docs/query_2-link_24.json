        "text": "Travis Barker's ex-wife did not hold back while talking about the Blink 182 drummer's new family.\n\nShanna Moakler, 48, was married to Barker for four years before splitting in 2008. The former couple also shares two children, Landon and Alabama.\n\nIn 2022, Barker married Kourtney Kardashian and the couple welcomed a baby boy this past November.\n\nMoakler doesn't seem keen on Barker's new family.\n\nKOURTNEY KARDASHIAN, 44, ANNOUNCES SHE'S PREGNANT, EXPECTING FIRST CHILD WITH TRAVIS BARKER, 47\n\n\"I'm tired of people s----ing on me,\" she said during a teaser clip of the \"Dumb Blonde\" podcast. \"I don't have to like that f---ing family.\"\n\n\"There are people that don’t like that family, don’t watch their f---ing show and don’t give a f--- what Kim Kardashian is doing with her a--.\"\n\nMoakler, who starred in the reality TV show \"Meet the Barkers\" while married to Travis, alleged Barker had a \"drinking problem\" and struggled with \"addiction.\" The TV personality also slammed her former husband for \"womanizing,\" claiming she found emails from Barker to other women on his computer once.\n\n\"I looked in his email and I saw all the emails from all the women,\" Moakler alleged.\n\nTRAVIS BARKER'S EX-WIFE ‘HURT’ BY ROCKER'S PUBLIC RELATIONSHIP WITH KOURTNEY KARDASHIAN\n\nThe former Miss USA pageant queen explained the emails \"didn't bother her\" as much as finding out Barker had allegedly sent comments to TMZ calling Moakler a \"s----y mother\" and a \"terrible person.\"\n\n\"I even read some of them and I couldn't f---ing believe he was the one behind some of those comments,\" she said.\n\nA representative for Barker did not respond to Fox News Digital's immediate request for comment.\n\nLIKE WHAT YOU’RE READING?

A user claimed the drummer's daughter was \"taking sides\" in the apparent feud that was emerging between Barker and Moakler.\n\nHowever, Alabama claimed: \"Actually if you weren't such a dumb a-- you would realize our mom has never been in our lives and isn't there for us like our dad is.\"\n\n\"My mom has never completely been in my life,\" she later posted on her Instagram story. \"Can you guys stop painting her out to be an amazing mom? Did your moms ask to see you on Mother's Day cause mine didn't? I'm done keeping it a secret, reality shows.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER\n\nMoakler slammed the accusation as false.\n\n\"The claims of being absent from my children's lives are false and incredibly hurtful. Co-parenting is hard, but I have always and will continue to prioritize my children's happiness and well-being,\" she told People magazine.\n\n\"I refuse to involve them in a vindictive parenting competition where feelings are bound to get hurt,\" Moakler added. \"Encouraging relationships with both parents is a duty on both mother and father. I know one day my children will see through the fame and money machine they have been thrust into and realize their mother loves and will always be there for them.\""
