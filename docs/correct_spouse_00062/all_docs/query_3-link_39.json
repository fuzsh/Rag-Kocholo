It’s not because I’m bitter, and I’m definitely not jealous.”\n\nThe 48-year-old model continued: “I wish them nothing but the best, and as long as they’re good to my kids, that’s all I care about. But I think the whole thing is really weird.”\n\nShanna confessed she's \"looking forward\" to the day she has nothing more to do with the 'Feeling This' hitmaker - who had three weddings with Kourtney last year - once their youngest child turns 18.\n\nThe mother-of-three - who also has Atiana, 24, with ex Oscar De La Hoya - said: “I don’t even know Travis Barker anymore.\n\n“We haven’t been together since almost 2010 to 2012 and I don’t even know him.\n\n“We only have our 17 year old, who will be 18 this year, and then our work is done here, and we never have to see or talk to each other ever again. And I look forward to that day.”\n\nShanna recently called out Poosh founder Kourtney, 44 - who has Mason, 13, daughter Penelope, 10, and eight-year-old Reign with ex-partner Scott Disick - for posting more photos of her children than her own.\n\nA follower posted on her selfie: \"I hope that you get a huge apology some day for what was said on that exploitative, money grabbing, circus. 'He's been through Hell' 'Kourtney has filled a void for me.' #parentalalienationawareness. (sic)\"\n\nAnd Shanna quipped back: \"She post more of my kids then her own, lol.(sic)\""
