        "text": "The Kardashian-Jenner family has had more than its fair share of drama over the years, and a lot of it has been connected to romantic relationships. Whether it be the ups and downs of Khloe Kardashian’s relationship with Tristian Thompson or the rocky marriage of Kim Kardashian and Kanye West, there always seems to be something going on. Most recently, oldest Kardashian sibling Kourtney has found herself in a whirlwind romance with Blink-182 drummer Travis Barker. While things seem to have been going well between the two, Barker’s ex, Shanna Moakler, has caused a bit of drama outside of the relationship. So what’s going down with this situation?\n\nKourtney Kardashian and Travis Barker reportedly began dating earlier this year, but the two went Instagram official via a February post from Kardashian. The two appear to be inseparable right now, and even Kardashian’s famous family is said to be happy for her. According to reports, they’re actually surprised as to how different the typically witty Kardashian sibling is when she’s with him.\n\nOf course, high-profile celebrity relationships are bound to draw attention from different people, whether they be fellow celebrities or general members of the public. In this case, Shana Moakler has a few things to say, and she recently made a major claim that involves Kim Kardashian.\n\nThe Rumor That’s Swirled Around Shanna Moakler, Travis Barker And Kim Kardashian\n\nShanna Moakler, who was married to Travis Barker from 2004-2008, has spoken on the relationship between him and Kourtney Kardashian before. Though she’s recently said she has “no ill will” against Kardashian, she did say that she finds their PDA “weird.”\n\nHowever, Shanna Moakler truly made headlines when she claimed that her marriage to Travis Barker ended because he allegedly had an affair with Kim Kardashian. Moakler appeared to have made the claim in an alleged DM that’s been floating around the internet. In the same reported message, Moakler also claims that Barker was “emotionally abusive” towards her.\n\nHow Travis Barker And Shanna Moakler’s Daughter Responded To The Claim\n\nSince Shanna Moakler made the initial claim, her and Travis Barker’s 15-year-old daughter, Alabama, has chimed in on the matter. On her Instagram Stories, the teen shared an image of the alleged DM and called out her mother, claiming that she’s an absent parent:\n\nTravis Barker and Shanna Moakler’s 17-year-old son, Landon, also seemed to agree with his sister’s sentiments. In a recent social media comment from the young man, he mentioned that their mother hasn’t been in their lives as much as their dad. Moakler has since denied the claims.\n\nWhat Allegedly Really Went Down Between Kim Kardashian and Travis Barker\n\nWhile Shana Moakler’s claims have caused some major buzz, there now seems to be some opposition to her assertion. While speaking with Page Six, a source close to Kardashian alleges that the relationship between her and Barker was not romantic:\n\nAccording to the source, Kim Kardashian and Travis Barker were not an item but only friends introduced by a mutual friend. Page Six spoke to another source, who criticized Moakler for making claims against Kim Kardashian (who’s in the midst of her own divorce), accusing her of “spreading lies”:\n\nAs of this writing, Shana Moakler has not responded to the counter reports against her claims. It remains to be seen how things will continue to progress between Kourtney Kardashian and Travis Barker but, on the surface, it doesn’t appear there’s any drama between the two lovers or Kim Kardashian."
