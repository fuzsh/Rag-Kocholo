After winner Chelsi Smith won the Miss Universe 1995 pageant, Moakler succeeded her as Miss USA.[4] She was chosen as a Playmate of the Month for Playboy magazine in December 2001.[5]\n\nMoakler eventually branched out into an acting career, appearing as a regular for two seasons on the USA Network television series Pacific Blue in 1998,[6] and in 2005 she starred as herself on the reality television series Meet the Barkers with her then-husband Travis Barker, drummer in the rock band Blink-182.[7] She hosted E!'s Bridalplasty during its two-month run in 2010/2011. In January 2014, it was announced that Moakler had joined the cast of the VH1 reality series, Hollywood Exes.[8]\n\nMoakler has served as the executive producer of the Miss Nevada USA state pageant since 2012, after joining as a director in 2011, and acquired the Miss Utah USA franchise in 2018.[9][10][11]\n\nEarly life\n\n[edit]\n\nMoakler, who is of German, Irish, Portuguese, and Polish descent,[4] was born in Providence, Rhode Island.[12][13][14] She has two older brothers and had an older sister, who died in 2012.[5][15] As a child, Moakler enjoyed weekend visits to her grandfather's farm, where she could \"play outdoors and be a tomboy.\"[5] Moakler was a competitive roller skater for 12 years (participating in roller skating competitions analogous to ice skating competitions).[16] She attended Barrington High School,[13] where she claims to have been \"the biggest dork.\"[17] According to Moakler, she was 4 feet 11 inches (1.50 m) and 75 pounds (34 kg) until she finally hit puberty at age 17.[17] By the time she graduated, however, Moakler had dated the captain of the football team and was voted as best dressed.[17] She moved to Miami after high school to pursue a modeling career.[13] Moakler later moved to New York City and then to Los Angeles.\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nPageants\n\n[edit]\n\nShanna Moakler, at the age of 17, represented Rhode Island in the Miss Teen USA 1992 pageant. She placed third in the preliminaries, sixth in the interview segment, and fifth in the swimsuit competition (scoring 9.115, 9.279 and 9.087 respectively). Moakler made it to the semi-finals and finished seventh overall.[18] Moakler won the Miss Teen All American title for 1993.[19]\n\nIn 1995, Moakler was named Miss New York USA and represented New York in the Miss USA pageant, held that year in South Padre Island, Texas.

However, she has complained that the experience required her to \"sign autographs at places like Bob's Home Furnishing Rentals.\" She was also forced to live with a pageant chaperone, who made sure she dressed and acted appropriately.[4]\n\nMoakler responded to the 2009 Miss USA gay marriage controversy by appearing in a public service announcement supporting efforts to overturn the result of California's Proposition 8.[21] Following allegations that reigning Miss California USA Carrie Prejean had posed for risqué photos and violated terms of her contract, Donald Trump decided that there had been no breach and therefore declined to strip Prejean of her crown.[22] Moakler then resigned as co-director for the pageant on May 13, 2009, stating \"I cannot with a clear conscience move forward supporting and promoting the Miss Universe Organization when I no longer believe in it, or the contracts I signed committing myself as a youth.\"[23] However, on November 13, 2009, it was announced that Moakler returned to the Miss California USA organization, around the same time Carrie Prejean was dethroned.[24]\n\nIn 2008, Moakler made a pro-vegetarianism ad for PETA[25] and in 2013 she posed nude for a PETA anti-fur ad campaign, stating that as long as she is the director of Miss Nevada, fur coats would not be given as prizes.[26]\n\nModeling\n\n[edit]\n\nMoakler began her modeling career at the age of fifteen.[3] She appeared in various publications, including such magazines as Cosmopolitan and Brentwood.[3] She signed a contract with Playboy and in December 2001, was named Playmate of the Month.[5] She has admitted that posing nude was \"a little scary at first.\"[5] Moakler's Playmate data sheet listed her measurements as: 34\" bust, 24\" waist, 34\" hips, 5 feet 8 inches (1.73 m) tall and 117 pounds.[12][27] She later appeared in a campaign for Cutty Sark that was photographed by David LaChapelle.[5]\n\nTelevision\n\n[edit]\n\nMoakler started her television career in 1996 with appearances on Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman and Due South.[28] Moakler then played Lisa in Friends 'Til the End, a 1997 NBC movie of the week starring Shannen Doherty.

The USA Network series featured a team of police officers who patrolled the beaches of Santa Monica, California on bicycles.[4] In seasons four and five Moakler played Officer Monica Harper, described as the trouble-maker rookie.[6] Moakler has admitted that, even equipped with a $5,000 Trek bike, she was somewhat accident-prone on the set, saying that when the cast had to \"ride really close together for the camera\" they would often \"crash into each other like idiots and end up in a big ball of arms and legs.\"[4]\n\nMoakler was a celebrity contestant on Search Party, a game show on the E! network. The show filmed at exotic beach resort locations and required contestants to team up for competitions such as athletic events and scavenger hunts.
