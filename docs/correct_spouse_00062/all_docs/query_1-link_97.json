        "text": "Kourtney Kardashian and Travis Barker seemed like an unlikely couple at the start of their romance. Less than a year into their relationship, they shocked the public with an engagement. In 2022, Kardashian and Travis tied the knot and had a baby, Rocky Thirteen, in 2023. Now, a source alleges that Kardashian feels “scared” of Barker’s ex, Shanna Moakler, creating “tension” between Kardashian and Barker.\n\nKourtney Kardashian is allegedly ‘scared’ of Travis Barker’s ex, Shanna Moakler\n\nKourtney Kardashian and Travis Barker are living the rockstar lifestyle. The media mogul and the Blink-182 drummer don’t mind showing off their relationship in the public eye, and Kardashian was very vocal about having a baby, Rocky Thirteen, at 45.\n\nWhile Kardashian and Barker are living their life as a happily married couple, they have significant relationship histories they still deal with. Kardashian has three children — Mason, 14, Penelope, 11, and Reign, 9 — with her ex-boyfriend of many years, Scott Disick. Barker has two children — Alabama, 18, and Landon, 20 — with his ex-wife, Shanna Moakler.\n\nMoakler and Barker were married for four years before calling it quits in 2008. The couple had a volatile, dysfunctional relationship. A source told Life & Style in June 2024 that Kardashian “has been pretty avoidant” regarding Moakler. Barker also allegedly “can’t stand” Disick and does his best to avoid him.\n\n“[The] truth is, [Kardashian’s] scared of Shanna, so she doesn’t want to risk seeing her face to face,” the source said. “So, unfortunately, it still does create situations where they have to take time apart on the weekends. It’s beyond aggravating that Scott and Shanna still have this sort of power over them.”\n\n“They’re both so careful not to overstep boundaries when it comes to the kids,” the source continued regarding the couple. “But it does create tension in their relationship.”\n\nShanna Moakler called her ex’s family ‘disgusting’\n\nShanna Moakler spoke out against the Kardashians on the Dumb Blonde podcast in January 2024. While on the podcast, Moakler told host Bunnie XO that she believed Travis Barker and Kardashian were “alienating” her as a parent. She called the Kardashians “disgusting.”\n\n“I removed myself so that they couldn’t bond over my children hating me,” Moakler said, according to People.\n\n“When Travis got with Kourtney, there was some parental alienation going on there, where Travis — even when we weren’t together — always wanted to be the ‘super dad,'” Moakler explained. “‘I’m the best parent. I’m the this and that,’ and I’m like, ‘Bro, you win.’ Like you’re the winner here. You have all the money, and you have all this. You’re the winner.”\n\nShe added that she thinks her kids got “caught up” in the Kardashian’s fame and hoped to be on TV. “They’re buying them Prada, and they’re buying them gifts, and they’re going to these events, and they’re meeting Kanye and, you know, all this big stuff,” she continued.\n\nTravis Barker’s ex said she’s ‘never met’ Kourtney Kardashian or the new baby\n\nShanna Moakler spoke to People in June 2024 that she’s “never even met” Kourtney Kardashian or the new baby, Rocky Thirteen. But she admitted that her children “love the baby” and are “all happy” to spend time with Travis Barker and Kardashian.\n\nDuring the interview, she commented on how people on Barker’s side accused her of not being there for her children through the years. She explained that during the coronavirus (COVID-19) lockdown, her kids spent more time with Barker because of the amenities in his home. However, she was still present in their lives.\n\n“I think the most disgusting thing you can do to a woman is to demean her as a mother,” Moakler said. “I’m there for my children every day.”"
