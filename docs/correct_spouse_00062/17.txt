Travis Barker's ex-wife Shanna Moakler is reportedly not thrilled with how her former spouse is behaving in public with his new girlfriend Kourtney Kardashian.

A source told People magazine, "Shanna's moved on from Travis, but it's been hurtful that everything he's doing for Kourtney he did before for her, like the plane flying overhead, the flowers. It's all exactly the same."

Moakler and the Blink-182 drummer were married from 2004 to 2008 and they share two children together: daughter Alabama Luella, 15, son Landon Asher, 17. He's also a stepfather to Moakler's older daughter Atiana De la Hoya, 22. Moakler is also currently dating Matthew Rondeau.

"Shanna and Travis are cordial with each other and are friendly â€” they have a long history together," the source described. "Again she's moved on from Travis and has her own boyfriend and life, but this is just hurtful to her."
