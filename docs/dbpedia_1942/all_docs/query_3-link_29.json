        "text": "Charles Cecil Guyton, Jr. died suddenly, in March 2024. The Kids in Birmingham 1963 community will miss him greatly. Anyone who gathers for our monthly Zoom get-together remembers Cecil for his knack for sparking conversations! And he brought us two of our most popular guests â€“ his musician friends West Byrd and Eric Essix. Those of us at the September 2023 Kids gathering treasured the chance to meet him in person and to hear his story as he spoke before UAB Honors students at our luncheon at the Birmingham Museum of Art. We feel fortunate that during that weekend, Pam Powell was able to squeeze Cecil in for an interview. We will post the recording of that oral history soon. Cecil was a riveting storyteller and a good friend. Here is the bio he wrote for his story, posted on our website in 2019:\n\nI was born on October 20th, 1954, at Holy Family Hospital. At the time my family lived in Cleveland, Ohio. But by the end of that year, my parents would divorce and my mother would move my sister and me back to Birmingham. I grew up in the Titusville Neighborhood and attended Center Street Elementary. I graduated from West End High School and attended Alabama State University. I currently live in the Chicago area where I operate a Black Car Service.\n\nI was born in Birmingham in 1954. My family lived in the Titusville neighborhood and I attended Center Street Elementary. My family were members of Sixth Avenue Baptist Church. My family was also very involved in the Civil Rights Movement. My uncle, Bernard H. Williams, had attended Morehouse College with Dr. King and they were Frat Brothers. My mother and grandmother were very close friends of Rev. Fred Shuttlesworth, a Birmingham pastor who had taken many brave actions to push for changes in the Jim Crow laws. Many of the people in this group were and still are very close friends.\n\nI remember 1963 vividly, mainly because of how violent it was, but also because of the bombing of 16th Street Baptist Church. Denise McNair, one of the girls who was killed, was one of my playmates, and we attended the same school at the time."
