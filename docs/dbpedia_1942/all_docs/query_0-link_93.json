        "text": "WORLD WAR II\n\nMurray Men in World War II\n\nThis project only succeeded because of the dedication and determined efforts of about a hundred individuals who assisted the museum's endeavor to collect and record history that should have been saved in the 1940s and 50s.\n\nAlthough the monument on the courthouse lawn contains a listing of Murray County's war dead, including the names of those who made the supreme sacrifice in World War II, it appears that nobody bothered to collect and record the faces and facts belonging with those names.\n\nAbout a dozen people interested in local history recently joined together, working to identify people who might know details about these dead men. We continue searching for reliable information about Ben Moore, Jr.\n\nThe following assisted greatly in the research effort: Pat Ausmus; Anne Brindle; Emily Cogburn; Diane Davis; \"Miss Mary\" Dill; Robert Green; Tim Howard; William Leonard; Carolyn Luffman; Bobby Mosteller; and Marcelle White. Robert Green found graves for several of the dead soldiers, a surprising number have tombstones in Murray County. Bobby Mosteller enlisted the help of his coffee buddies. Herman McDaniel did much of the online research and assembled the materials collected to create this new section of the museum.\n\nThese people consulted more than 50 others that they thought might have helpful information or be able to point them to others who might know. Thankfully, all of the folks contacted by this group answered our questions, provided information, pointed us to other possible sourceswho often were family members, gave us information from family histories, pointed us to grave sites, and, in a few cases, shared family pictures of their dead soldier. The pictures will be added to this section shortly.\n\nTogether we have assembled both family and military information about these men who died while serving in World War II. Because this is being preserved in an on-line museum rather than printed in a book, the information can be modified as neededcorrecting errors or adding new information and pictures. This section of the museum will continue to evolve.\n\nSpecial thanks to all who have assisted in this effort!\n\nWorld War II A Brief Overview\n\nWorld War II began in Europe in 1939 and in Asia in 1937. This war involved most of the countries of the world and resulted in major changes for all.\n\nPrior to this conflict many European countries held colonies around the world. England, France, Italy, Spain, Germany, The Netherlands, Belgium, Portugal, and others claimed ownership of colonial possessions.\n\nThe fighting in Europe started when Germany invaded Poland September 1, 1939. Within months the German army had gained control of most of continental Europe. The United States did not enter the war in Europe until December 1941, after the Japanese bombed the American Navy at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. The U. S. immediately declared war on both Japan and Germany.\n\nOur government put America's total resources and capabilities behind the war effort. Most factories ceased normal production and turned to producing things needed for the war. Auto manufacturers ceased production of cars and trucks and started to make war vehicles. Since most of the manufacturing capabilities in Europe had been destroyed or taken over by Germany, European forces had to turn to the United States for nearly all of their war vehicles. The U. S. Government started to ration consumer items such as gas, oil, tires, shoe, coffee, sugar, and meat; these were rationed throughout the war years.\n\nThe fighting occurred across Europe, North Africa, the South Pacific, and much of Asia.\n\nMore than 100 million military personnel were mobilized for the war.\n\nMajor countries fighting with the United States included Great Britain, China, France, Canada, New Zealand, and Brazil. Some of the countries that had been overrun by the Germans very early in the war had national armies in exile fighting with the American allies. The Netherlands, Belgium, and Poland were among these. These countries reported more than 16 million military deaths. The estimate of their civilian deaths was put at more than 45 million; this figure includes those killed by Germany in the Holocaust.\n\nThe war in Europe turned in favor of the American allies in 1944 when the Allies invaded France and began to retake the continent. The Soviet Union invaded Europe from the East and the two forces eventually met in Berlin. Germany unconditionally surrendered May 8, 1945.\n\nMajor countries allied with Germany and Japan included Bulgaria, Hungary, Italy, and Romania. The German-Japan group reported more than 8 million military deaths. They experienced an estimated 4 million civilian death, including those who died when American forces dropped the atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.\n\nThe Japanese, soon after the second atomic bomb was dropped, surrendered August 15, 1945.\n\nTINIAN ISLAND, A TINY AIRSTRIP THAT WAS CRUCIAL TO WINNING THE WAR IN THE PACIFIC\n\nNOTE: The museum extends special thanks to Marine Corps Captain Tommy Neuman for permission to use this article. Tommy enlisted in 1964, completed boot camp at Parris Island, SC, then Officer's Training at Quantico, VA. He served with 3rd Force Recon until he was wounded and medically retired. He currently is involved with numerous military groups in Virginia. Along the way he became Dr. Tommy Neuman and now lives at Warsaw, Virginia. Thank You, Sir.\n\nTINIAN IS A SMALL ISLAND, less than 40 square miles, a flat green dot in the vastness of Pacific blue.\n\nFly over it and you notice a slash across its north end of uninhabited bush, a long thin line that looks like an overgrown dirt runway. If you didn't know what it was, you wouldn't give it a second glance out your airplane window.\n\nOn the ground, you see the runway isn't dirt but tarmac and crushed limestone, abandoned with weeds sticking out of it. Yet this is arguably the most historical airstrip on earth. This is where World War II was won. This is Runway Able:\n\nOn July 24, 1944, 30,000 US Marines landed on the beaches of Tinian .... Eight days later, over 8,000 of the 8,800 Japanese soldiers on the island were dead (vs. 328 Marines), and four months later the Seabees had built the busiest airfield of WWII - dubbed North Field - enabling B-29 Superfortresses to launch air attacks on the Philippines, Okinawa, and mainland Japan.\n\nLate in the afternoon of August 5, 1945, a B-29 was maneuvered over a bomb loading pit, then after lengthy preparations, taxied to the east end of North Field's main runway, Runway Able, and at 2:45am in the early morning darkness of August 6, took off.\n\nThe B-29 was piloted by Col. Paul Tibbets of the US Army Air Force, who had named the plane after his mother, Enola Gay. The crew named the bomb they were carrying Little Boy. 6 hours later at 8:15am Japan time, the first atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima ..\n\nThree days later, in the pre-dawn hours of August 9, a B-29 named Bockscar (a pun on \"boxcar\" after its flight commander Capt. Fred Bock), piloted by Major Charles Sweeney took off from Runway Able. Finding its primary target of Kokura obscured by clouds, Sweeney proceeded to the secondary target of Nagasaki, over which, at 11:01am, bombardier Kermit Beahan released the atomic bomb dubbed Fat Man.\n\nHere is \"Atomic Bomb Pit #1\" where Little Boy was loaded onto Enola Gay:\n\nAnd here on the other side of ramp is \"Atomic Bomb Pit #2\" where Fat Man was loaded onto Bockscar.\n\nThe commemorative plaque records that 16 hours after the nuking of Nagasaki, \"On August 10, 1945 at 0300, the Japanese Emperor without his cabinet's consent decided to end the Pacific War.\"\n\nTake a good look at these pictures, folks. This is where World War II ended with total victory of America over Japan. I was there all alone. There were no other visitors and no one lives anywhere near for miles. Visiting the Bomb Pits, walking along deserted Runway Able in solitude, was a moment of extraordinarily powerful solemnity.\n\nIt was a moment of deep reflection. Most people, when they think of Hiroshima and Nagasaki , reflect on the numbers of lives killed in the nuclear blasts - at least 70,000 and 50,000 respectively. Being here caused me to reflect on the number of lives saved - how many more Japanese and Americans would have died in a continuation of the war had the nukes not been dropped.\n\nYet that was not all. It's not just that the nukes obviated the US invasion of Japan, Operation Downfall, that would have caused upwards of a million American and Japanese deaths or more. It's that nuking Hiroshima and Nagasaki were of extraordinary humanitarian benefit to the nation and people of Japan.\n\nLet's go to this cliff on the nearby island of Saipan to learn why:\n\nSaipan is less than a mile north of Tinian .... The month before the Marines took Tinian, on June 15, 1944, 71,000 Marines landed on Saipan ..... They faced 31,000 Japanese soldiers determined not to surrender.\n\nJapan had colonized Saipan after World War I and turned the island into a giant sugar cane plantation. By the time of the Marine invasion, in addition to the 31,000 entrenched soldiers, some 25,000 Japanese settlers were living on Saipan, plus thousands more Okinawans, Koreans, and native islanders brutalized as slaves to cut the sugar cane.\n\nThere were also one or two thousand Korean \"comfort women\" (kanji in Japanese), abducted young women from Japan's colony of Korea to service the Japanese soldiers as sex slaves. (See The Comfort Women: Japan 's Brutal Regime of Enforced Prostitution in the Second World War, by George Hicks.)\n\nWithin a week of their landing, the Marines set up a civilian prisoner encampment that quickly attracted a couple thousand Japanese and others wanting US food and protection. When word of this reached Emperor Hirohito - who contrary to the myth was in full charge of the war - he became alarmed that radio interviews of the well-treated prisoners broadcast to Japan would subvert his people's will to fight.\n\nAs meticulously documented by historian Herbert Bix in Hirohito and the Making of Modern Japan, the Emperor issued an order for all Japanese civilians on Saipan to commit suicide. The order included the promise that, although the civilians were of low caste, their suicide would grant them a status in heaven equal to those honored soldiers who died in combat for their Emperor.\n\nAnd that is why the precipice in the picture above is known as Suicide Cliff, off which over 20,000 Japanese civilians jumped to their deaths to comply with their fascist emperor's desire - mothers flinging their babies off the cliff first or in their arms as they jumped.\n\nAnyone reluctant or refused, such as the Okinawan or Korean slaves, were shoved off at gunpoint by the Jap soldiers. Then the soldiers themselves proceeded to hurl themselves into the ocean to drown off a sea cliff afterwards called Banzai Cliff. Of the 31,000 Japanese soldiers on Saipan, the Marines killed 25,000, 5,000 jumped off Banzai Cliff, and only the remaining thousand were taken prisoner.\n\nThe extent of this demented fanaticism is very hard for any civilized mind to fathom - especially when it is devoted not to anything noble but barbarian evil instead. The vast brutalities inflicted by the Japanese on their conquered and colonized peoples of China, Korea, the Philippines, and throughout their \"Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere\" was a hideously depraved horror.\n\nAnd they were willing to fight to the death to defend it. So they had to be nuked. The only way to put an end to the Japanese barbarian horror was unimaginably colossal destruction against which they had no defense whatever. Nuking Japan was not a matter of justice, revenge, or it getting what it deserved. It was the only way to end the Japanese dementia.\n\nAnd it worked - for the Japanese. They stopped being barbarians and started being civilized. They achieved more prosperity - and peace - than they ever knew, or could have achieved had they continued fighting and not been nuked. The shock of getting nuked is responsible.\n\nWe achieved this because we were determined to achieve victory. Victory without apologies. Despite perennial liberal demands we do so, America and its government has never apologized for nuking Japan ... Hopefully, America never will.\n\nTommy Neuman\n\nMurray Men Who Died While Serving In World War II\n\nGeorge Luther Akins was born in 1924 to George L. Akins and M. Ola Akins. Family and friends called the soldier Luther. Siblings included Aileen, Louise, and John H. Akins, all in the 1930 Census, showing the family then lived in Shuck Pen District of Murray County.\n\nHis enlistment form indicates that he enlisted from Murray County, Georgia, had attended one year of high school and worked as a general farm hand. He enlisted as a Private, July 24, 1943 at Fort McPherson, Atlanta. He was unmarried. He attained the rank of Sergeant in the Army. Service Number: 34826014. Sergeant Akins died in Italy on December 14, 1944, as the result of mortar fire. A military marker in Chatsworth Heights Cemetery reads: George L. Akins, Jr., December 29, 1924, December 14, 1944, WW II. An adjacent marker for his mother is inscribed: Ola Akins Henderson, November 5, 1903, May 22, 1986. Next in the row is a military marker for his father: George L. Akins, October 13, 1896, June 8, 1966, WW I.\n\nLuther's youngest brother, John Harlan Akins, provided additional information and submitted photos to the museum.\n\nHe reported that the family increased by three after the 1930 Census was taken. Charles Lamar Akins, Betty Faye Akins, and Clara Lynn Akins were siblings to Luther.\n\nThe following pictures depict:\n\nLuther Akins in uniform,\n\nLuther wearing overalls in group of three (other two are his brother John on left and cousin Hoyle Lents in middle),\n\nLuther's parents, George L. and M. Ola Akins,\n\nHis mother alone,\n\nHis brother, John Harlan Akins,\n\nBrother Charles Lamar Akins in boat with unidentified younger man,\n\nHis sister Betty Faye\n\nand sister Clara Lynn Akins\n\nThanks to Robert Green for submitting this picture of Sergeant Akins' grave marker.\n\nJim D. Bonds was born in 1908 to Will and Beckie Bonds. Siblings included William, Rowena, Omie, and Mandy, all in the 1920 Census. The family was then living in Eton. He enlisted as a Private at Fort McPherson, Atlanta, April 4, 1942.\n\nHis enlistment form stated that Jim was 67 inches tall and weighed 132 pounds. It stated that he had attended two years of high school and worked as a general farm hand. His military service number was 34266812. At time of enlistment he was living in Murray. Pfc Bonds was serving with the 128th Field Artillery Battalion, 6th Armored Division, when he was killed March 5, 1945, in the Netherlands. He was buried there in Margraten Cemetery, Grave Number 2012.\n\nThe Chatsworth Times reported April 26, 1945, as follows: \"Jim Bonds Killed in Germany. Pfc. Jim Bonds, son of Mr. And Mrs. Will Bonds, of Eton, was killed on March t in Germany, the War Department has notified the soldier's parents. Besides his parents, the soldier is survived by three sisters: Mrs. Dennis Holloway, or Rome; Misses Rowena and Louis Bonds, of Eton, and one brother, Pete Bonds, of Dalton. Pfc. Bonds had been overseas almost two years. Before entering the service he was engaged in farming.\"\n\nThis picture was taken in 1927, when Jim was a student at Eton High School.\n\nWinston Eugene Brown was born in 1918 to Calvin Alexander and Zeffie (Snyder) Brown, who lived on the Colvard Place in Little Murray. Family history indicates that he was named for his uncle Winston Eugene Brown. Both the 1920 and 1930 Census show the family living in Polk County, Tennessee. Siblings included Norris, Esta, Dorothy, Ruth, Mildred, and Virginia. The 1930 Census listed the name Hester M. Brown instead of Esta shown in 1920. The 1930 also listed Junior M. Brown, age 1.\n\nThe young Winston attended Oak Grove School. His military records indicate that he had completed 4 years of high school, but the school he attended is not known.\n\nHis enlistment form indicates that Winston was born in Tennessee but was living in Murray County, Georgia when he enlisted on January 28, 1942 at Fort Oglethorpe, Georgia. That form indicated that he was 68 inches tall and weighed 153 pounds. He had attended 4 years of high school. His Army serial number was 34186713. He was killed August 18, 1944, in an airplane crash. His body was returned and he was buried with full military honors at Boanerges Baptist Church Cemetery in Polk County, Tennessee.\n\nThe following pictures, provided by Betty Bryant Bandy, are of Winston E. Brown in uniform, and the honor guard at his funeral in Polk County, Tennessee.\n\nA. J. Cagle was born in 1920 in Georgia. His name was Allen James Cagle. The Census for 1930 listed Jackson and Emma Cagle, living in Coosawattee, Murray County. Their family included Floyd Cagle, age 16; A. J. Cagle, age 9; and Harold Cagle, one month old. All of these had been born in Georgia. That Census listed five other Cagle families on the same page as the family of Jackson and Emma, meaning they all lived nearby. The Census indicated that every member of those six Cagle families had been born in Georgia. Apparently the Cagles had been settled in Georgia for decades. A. J., born in 1920, eventually married, fathered two boys, Jimmy and Ronnie. Ronnie never saw his father. His son A. J. Jr., ironically was the first Murray County man to die in the Vietnam War.\n\nThe father's Army enlistment record indicates that A. J. enlisted from Murray County, Georgia, had completed one year of high school and was married. He had worked as a farm hand. He enlisted as a Private on August 21, 1943, at Fort McPherson, Georgia. He had attained the rank of Sergeant when the Army notified his parents that he was missing in action. Six months later authorities notified the family that he had been killed in France, in action near the Rhine River. His official date of death was determined to be March 7, 1944. After the war the Army returned his body to America and his family buried him in Murray's New Prospect Cemetery.\n\nSidney L. Cantrell was born in 1919, in Georgia, to Sidney L. and Anemy (?) J. Cantrell. The 1930 Census listed two older brothers, Willie L., and Earl L. Cantrell. The family then was living in Crandall.\n\nHis enlistment form shows that he was living in Murray County at the time of his enlistment. The form indicated that he had completed grammar school, then worked as a semi-skilled woodworker. He enlisted as a Private at Fort McPherson, Atlanta, on September 25, 1943. Pvt. Cantrell was killed June 22, 1944 at Cherbourg, France. He was buried in grave E-4-10 at Saint Laurent Cemetery, Saint Laurent, France. His Army rank was Private when he died. His service number was 34828898. A grave marker was erected in Eton Cemetery, Eton, Georgia.\n\nHis death was reported in the August 3, 1944, issue of The Chatsworth Times: \"Sidney Cantrell Killed in France. Pvt. Sidney L. Cantrell, 25, of Crandall, was killed in action on June 22 in France, the soldier's mother, Mrs. Annie Morrison Cantrell, of Crandall, has been notified. Having previously received a message that her son was wounded, Mrs. Cantrell received the news last Sunday night that he had been killed.\n\nThe soldier is also survived by two brother, Lee Cantrell, of Crandall, and Earl Cantrell, of Knoxville, Tenn., and one sister, Mrs. H. G. McPherson, of Knoxville, Tenn. Private Cantrell was with the infantry and had been stationed in England since last April.\"\n\nThanks to Robert Green for acquiring the following picture of Sidney Cantrell. Robert contacted Cathryn Cantrell Wilbanks and told her he wanted a picture of the deceased soldier for the museum. She told him that she had a framed picture of Sidney that had been hanging on a wall in her home since shortly after he died. She invited Robert to come to her home with his camera to take a picture of her prized photo. He did.\n\nThe following photograph of Sidney Cantrell's grave marker was obtained through teamwork involving Robert Green, Joy fRiggers, and Katie Lemerre. Thanks to all!\n\nWillie A. Champion was born August 4, 1915, in Georgia. His parents were Charles and Alma Champion. The 1910 Census listed his parents in Worth County, Ga., as follows: Charlie, age 23; Alma, age 21; J. D., age 6 months. Family members report that Charlie died about 1918 or 1919, but do not recall the circumstances of his death.\n\nThe 1920 Census listed Alma, age 30; Mary L., age 12; Julia, age 7; Albert, age 5; and Carter, age 7 months. They were enumerated in the home of Alma's parents, Jessie and Sarah Hammontree, at Coosawattee, Gordon County, Georgia. Starling Hammontree, age 10, was also listed.\n\nAlma married Jae B. McElrath between the Censuses. In 1930, the household listed Jae B. McElrath, age 42; Alma McElrath, age 41; John McElrath, age 4; Jewell McElrath, age 2; and Ola Mae McElrath, 2 months. Also living in that household in 1930 were Albert, age 14, and Carter Tate Champion, age 10, both listed as stepsons.\n\nJo Mae Smith, half sister to Albert, said that Albert did not get along well with his step-father, so he left home and went off somewhere, she thinks Louisiana, where he married a woman he called Abby. She knows nothing about Albert's wife and whether they had a family.\n\nAlbert's brother, Carter Champion, also served in the Army, in World War II. He was living in Polk County, Tennessee, with a wife (name unknown) when he enlisted.\n\nSo far as Albert's death, Jo Mae said that the family was told by the Army that he had been injured (no details), spent several months in a hospital, and recovered sufficiently that he was returned to duty. He then got pneumonia and died February 7, 1945, but family does not know where he died.\n\nEventually the Army returned his body and he was buried in Hopewell Baptist Cemetery, just off of Highway 411, approximately 1 mile north of Oakman.\n\nInterestingly, both Murray and Gordon County listed this man as one of their dead soldiers of World War II. Yet neither had any public records detailing his life and death. After the museum had an article in the Chatsworth Times, Calhoun Times, and Dalton Citizen, headlined \"Who Was Willie A. Champion?\" with an accompanying photo of his grave marker, did someone come forward with helpful information regarding this man.\n\nSpecial thanks are due to Jo Mae Smith, Albert's half-sister, and her granddaughter, Sherry Smith, for providing basic family details which enabled the museum to find relevant Census records for Willie Albert Champion's family.\n\nThey have also promised to provide pictures of the dead soldier to the museum soon.\n\nFrank J. Davenport was born in 1921 in Murray County, Georgia. The 1930 Census listed his family living at Coosawattee, Gordon County, Georgia, as follows: John Davenport, age 46, Sellie Davenport, age 46, and Frank Davenport, age 9. His mother's name actually was Sallie. Grave markers at Fairview Cemetery, Gordon County, indicate that John R. Davenport lived from 1883 to 1960, and that Sallie N. Davenport lived from 1883 to 1976. The marker for Pvt. Frank J. Davenport contains the dates January 22, 1921 - September 19, 1944.\n\nThe Chatsworth Times, October 5, 1944, ran the following story: \"Frank Davenport Killed in France. Pvt. Frank J. Davenport, husband of Mrs. Mary Chance Davenport, was killed in action in France on September 19, according to a telegram Mrs. Davenport received from the War Department on October 2.\n\nPrivate Davenport, who had been in the regular army for five years, had been overseas for a year. He was 33 years old. A native of Gordon County, the soldier is survived by his wife and 20-month-old son, Ronald; his parents, Mr. And Mrs. J. R. Davenport, of Carters; two brothers Jewel Davenport of Knoxville, Tenn., and Herbert Davenport of Carters; and one sister, Dorothy Davenport of Spring Place.\"\n\nEnoch Thomas Davis was the son of Virgil C. and Addie R. Davis. When the 1930 Census was taken, the family lived in the Tenth District of Murray County. The parents were listed as Virgil C. Davis, age 53, born in Georgia, and Addie R. Davis, age 47, born in Georgia. The only other person listed in the household was Enoch Davis, age 5, born in Georgia.\n\nHis enlistment record indicates that Enoch completed 4 years of high school, and had worked at general farming. (Note: he enlisted December 5, 1942. The list of graduates of Murray County High School for 1943, includes his name.) He was shown being single, being 65 inches tall, and weighing 127 pounds. He enlisted as a Private in the Army Air Corps at Camp Forrest, Tennessee, December 5, 1942. He died May 5, 1944, but details of his death were not found. A grave marker in Sumach Cumberland Presbyterian Church Cemetery lists Enoch Thomas Davis, Cpl. US Air Corps, 14161823, born Oct. 19, 1924, died May 5, 1944. Son of V. C. and Addie (Ridley) Davis. Two nearby markers appear to be his parents. One lists V. C. Davis, 1887 -1959. The other has Addie J. Ridley, wife of V. C. Davis, 1882-1938.\n\nThe Chatsworth Times reported his death in the issue of May 11, 1944: \"Cpl. E. T. Davis Killed at Camp. Cpl. Enoch T. Davis, age 18, died from an accidental gun shot wound received in line of duty at his camp near Savannah, on May 5. He is survived by his father, Virgil Davis, of Crandall; aunts, Mrs. Olla Petty and Mrs. Lillie Hannah, of Dalton, Mrs. Carrie Dunn and Mrs. Ruby Dixon, of Crandall; uncles, Bob Pulliam and Henry Ridley.\n\nFuneral services were held from Fairy Valley Baptist Church Thursday afternoon at 2:30 o'clock with Rev. Kirby Parks, Rev Edd Payne, Rev Charlie Plemmons and Rev. Raymond Arrowwood officiating. Pallbearers were Billy Patterson, Cage Plemmons, W. P. Rymer, Samuel Higdon, Bobbie Houghton, and Billy Hall. Burial was in Sumach Cemetery with Kenemer Brothers in charge.\"\n\nJohnnie V. Davis was the son of Rev. and Mrs. Oscar Davis. He was born October 24, 1923. The family moved frequently, living sometimes in Murray County and other times in Whitfield. The Census of 1920 listed the family as Oscar E. Davis, age 37; Maude Davis, age 35; Venoy H. Davis, age 14; Clevy C. Davis, age 12; Ona Davis, age 8; Mattie J. Davis, age 5; Albert L. Davis, age 4: and Raymond Davis, age 1.\n\nMaude died in 1929 and was buried in Murray County's Free Hope Cemetery. The 1930 Census listed the family as: E. O. Davis, age 46; Clevie C. Davis, age 23; Mattie Gene Davis, age 15; Albert Davis, age 14; Raymond Davis, age 11; Mabel Davis, age 9; Johnnie Davis, age 6; and Jefferson Davis, age 4.\n\nRev. Davis was pastoring Free Hope Baptist Church and living in the former Gladden home-place at Gladden Springs, when he died in 1934. Shortly after his death all of his offspring moved to Whitfield County.\n\nArmy enlistment records for Johnnie V. Davis, born in 1923, service number 14133903, show that he enlisted from Whitfield County. He entered service July 21, 1942 at Camp Forrest, Tennessee, as a private. He had completed two years of high school and was working in the textiles industry just prior to entering the service. The form indicates that he was single, with no dependents.\n\nJohnnie's 5 brothers, Albert, Clevie, Jeff, Onnie, and Raymond also served during that war. Clevie was in the Navy and Jeff was a Marine. Others served in the Army.\n\nJohnnie was killed in action in France, December 10, 1944. His commanding officer sent the family a letter stating that \"Sgt. Johnnie\" had served honorably and well as a member of his battalion for 22 months. He had been awarded a Purple Heart and a Bronze Star for meritorious service in combat. The commander told the family only that Johnnie had been buried in \"northeastern France.\"\n\nAfter the war the military exhumed Johnnie's body and returned it to his family. His brothers served as pall bearers, proudly carrying their brother's flag-draped coffin into Free Hope Baptist Church for a funeral service, then to Free Hope Cemetery for burial. His tombstone, a military marker, is inscribed: Johnnie V. Davis, Oct. 24, 1923, Dec. 10, 1944, WW II. Johnnie's mother and father had been buried in the same row.\n\nCarlton McDaniel said that after Johnnie's father died in the early 1930s, the brothers had all moved to Whitfield County. When the war commenced Johnnie and his brother, Jeff, were living next door to the McDaniel family just off Highway 41, south of Dalton. Carlton remembered they were living with relatives, family name Beavers.\n\nWhen he learned that the museum was seeking pictures of Murray men who had died while serving in World War II, Carlton remembered that the Atlanta Constitution had published a picture of Johnnie with several of his fellow soldiers and that his mother, Amie McDaniel, had kept that newspaper picture of her young neighbor. Amazingly, Carlton found that picture among his deceased mother's papers and sent it to the museum.\n\nThis picture appeared in the March 6, 1944, issue of the Atlanta Constitution, with this text: \"Daltonite Wins Breather.' Back for a rest from front-line action, Corporal Johnnie Davis (second from left), of Dalton, Ga., enjoys a well earned rest and a chat with his tank pals somewhere on the beachhead south of Rome. Johnnie's pals are, left to right, Private Walter McClain, Kingsport, Tenn.; Private Vincent Cusenowicz, New York; T-5 Frank Wynegan, Belt, Montana; and T-4 Fred Weissflog, Chicago.\"\n\nPeggy Davis provided to the museum the following pictures. First is of Johnnie. Next is his father, Rev. Oscar Davis (about 1930). Third is from a newspaper article about the 6 Davis brothers who were serving during World War II. Last shows Johnnie's brothers carrying his casket from Free Hope Baptist Church.\n\nJohn S. Dixon was born in 1914, the son of Henry T. and Millie Dixon. The 1920 Census showed the family had two other children, Unar, age 2, and Robert Lee, newly born. They lived in the Eight District of Murray. The 1930 Census listed the family as Henry, age 45; Millie, age 45; J. S., age 15; Enna, age 11; Robert, age 9; Rose, age 7; Roby, age 5, and Opal age 3, in Militia District 984, Murray County.\n\nHis enlistment record stated that John was single and had no dependents. His service number was 34087096. He stood 68 inches tall and weighed 135 pounds. He had completed grammar school and worked as a general farm hand. He enlisted as a Private at Fort McPherson, Atlanta, August 20, 1941. He was killed on July 24, 1944 but details of his death were not found. A grave marker in New Prospect Baptist Church Cemetery, Murray County, contains the following information: John S. Dixon, Pvt. Co. E, 3rd Regt., 90th Div. US Army, born May 14, 1914, died July 26, 1944.\n\nDerrell O. Fuller was born February 14, 1922. Both his parents taught school at Ramhurst in the 1940s. His father's name was George but for now his mother's name is not known.\n\nWhen originally discovered, the following information did not appear to relate to the dead soldier from Murray County, there was too much that suggested that it might, for it to be ignored. Derrell O. Fuller qualifies as an unusual name, so it seems highly unlikely that two men with that exact name died in World War II.\n\nThe only enlistment form found for the name Derrell O. Fuller describes a man born in Oklahoma who entered the military from Oklahoma. He was 66 inches tall and weighed 154 pounds. He had completed grammar school and worked in general farming. The 1930 Census for Caddo County, Oklahoma, lists a family headed by George A. Fuller, age 46, who had been born in Texas, and his wife, Adie M. Fuller, age 38, who had been born in Georgia. They had 9 children listed. There is a Caddo County monument listing the names of local sons who died in World War II, and one of those names is Derrell O. Fuller, same as the man from Murray County, Georgia.\n\nMilitary records indicate that Derrell O. Fuller was killed April 17, 1945, but give no details of his death. Those records also indicate that Private First Class Derrell O. Fuller, service number 38275424, was buried in Saint Avold Cemetery, Saint Avold, France (Grave number B-24-32).\n\nIn Chatsworth Heights Cemetery, a double grave-marker honors Derrell O. Fuller, Feb. 14, 1922 - April 17, 1945, and Lena E. Fuller, 1924 - 1983. An adjacent grave lists: Derrell Oran Fuller, US Navy, 1944-1995.\n\nThe brief article published in The Chatsworth Times, March 10, 1945, provides confirmation that the Caddo County, Oklahoma man and the Murray County, Georgia man were the same individual. \"The Rev. And Mrs. George Fuller, of Ramhurst, who had five sons in the armed service, have been notified that one of their sons, Pfc. Derrell O. Fuller, died of sounds received in Germany on April 17. Pvt. Fuller has been in the army since 1942, serving overseas with the 61st Armored Infantry Battalion for the past eight months. He was 23 years old, a member of the Hopewell Baptist Church at Doogan, and had been a war worker at Bainbridge, Conn., before enlisting.\n\nBesides his parents, the soldier is survived by one sister, Mrs. Earl Baker, of California, and seven brothers, Pfc. Hoyt L. Fuller, of California; Staff Sgt. Dale D. Fuller, stationed in England; Nathan Fuller, S 2-3, on duty in the Pacific, Weylon Fuller, S 2-c, in training in Illinois; Otis O. Fuller, of Hugo, Okla., Almel N. Fuller, of California; Naaman W. Fuller, of California, and Glen Fuller, of Ramhurst.\" The names of survivors in this article match the names of the parents and children of the family found in 1930 Census in Caddo, Oklahoma.\n\nPaul Ross provided these pictures: first is of Derrell alone, second with his wife, Lena, and their son, Derrell Oran Fuller.\n\nJames Adrian Hammontree was the son of Chester and Katherine Hammontree. He was born in 1923, their fifth child. The Census of 1930 listed the family as: H. Chester, age 38; Katherine M., age 41; Edith E., age 15; Ralph W., age 11; Frances M., age 10, William A., age 8; J. Adrian, age 6; and H. Chester Hammontree, age 1.\n\nFamily records indicate that the father was Homer Chester Hammontree, 1891 - 1962. He was born and died in Murray County. Homer's parents reportedly were William Leach Hammontree, 1868 - 1939, and Elizabeth Vaughn Hammontree, 1874 - 1949.\n\nThese records list the mother as Katherine Miranda Youngblood Hammontree, 1895 - 1973. She was called \"Katie.\"\n\nJames enlisted as a Private in the Army Air Corps, at Camp Forrest, November 20, 1942. He indicated that he was married, had one year of high school, had worked as a sales clerk. His height was listed as 66 inches and his weight at 154 pounds. At the time of his death he held the rank of Sergeant. He was killed February 24, 1944, but no details of his death were found. A tombstone in Center Valley Cemetery lists: James A. Hammontree, Nov. 22, 1923 - Feb. 24, 1944. Sgt., 68th AAF Bomb Sq., WW II. His parents are adjacent: Chester 1891 - 1962 and Katie 1895-1973.\n\nThe Chatsworth Times ran two articles about this soldier. The first, in the issue of March 23, 1944, was \"Hammontree is Missing. Sgt. James Adrian Hammontree, 20, son of Mr. and Mrs. Chester Hammontree, of Fashion, has been reported missing in action over Germany, his parents have been notified. The soldier was a waist gunner with the Air Corps.\"\n\nIn their issue of May 4, 1944, The Times reported: \"Hammontree Killed in Action. Sergeant James A. Hammontree, previously reported missing, was killed in action in the European area on February 24, according to a telegram received Wednesday by the soldier's mother, Mrs. Chester Hammontree, of Fashion.\n\nIn addition to his parents, the soldier is survived by three brothers and two sisters. They are Sergeant William Hammontree, who is now overseas, Ralph and Chester Hammontree, Jr., Mrs. Earl Keith and Miss Edith Hammontree. Young Hammontree was 20 years old. He was inducted into the Army Air Corps on November 18, 1942. He was sent overseas in November, 1943, having only one furlough at home during his training period.\"\n\nIn March 2012 Robert G. Green sent the museum a package of documents from the National Archives relating to the downing of American Army Air Corps Bomber, model B24D, near Gotha, Germany, February 24, 1944. The materials included a Missing Air Crew Report that gave names, rank, crew position and service numbers for all ten aboard the bomber that day. Sgt. James A. Hammontree was Assistant Engineer, Gunner, Ball Turret.\n\nInformation that Green sent indicated that this particular mission of the 68th Squadron, 44th Bomb Group, 8th Air Force, was to bomb an aircraft manufacturing facility that made fighters for the Germans.\n\nThe bomber, with its crew of 10, after departing its base in England, had flown to Gotha and dropped its bombs at approximately 1320 hours. The pilot immediately began their return flight to England. An eye-witness reported: \"Just after the target this aircraft was hit by prop wash and fell out of formation. E/A (enemy aircraft) concentrated their attacks on this A/C and it began to struggle. Six (6) chutes were seen to come out of the A/C before it was seen to explode at approximately 1328 hours.\" Other witnesses reported that most of the damage inflicted on the bomber had been to its left side.\n\nDocuments detail the fate of several of the crew members who bailed out of the bomber. One man's chute either failed to open or he did not pull the cord. One was captured by Germans on the ground and taken to hospital. Others were captured and held prisoner until late September 1944, when they were repatriated to the American military.\n\nOne of the survivors reported that Sgt. Hammontree had been wounded and was still in the plane when the wreckage hit the ground. He was buried the following day in Pferndorf/Rhon Cemetery, grave 204. Fellow crewman, Sgt. W. W. Haynes suffered the same fate and was buried in grave 205.\n\nMuseum Note: A later report, The United States Strategic Bombing Survey, Vol. 9, Gothaer Waggonfabrik, A.G., Gotha, Germany, devoted many pages to two bombing missions sent to this facility. Brief extracts follow:\n\nThe Gothaer Waggonfabrik, A.G. was located in the northeast part of the City of Gotha. ... The plant was very compact, having over 70 buildings in an 80 acre plot.\n\n... The principal product of the aircraft division of this concern was the twin-engine fighter aircraft, ME-110. ... with a capacity of about 75 to 90 airplanes per month.\n\n... Two attacks, both by the Eighth AF, took place.\n\nA table in the report indicates that during the February 24, 1944, attack, 170 tons of HE bombs were dropped; 74 tons of IB bombs, and 180 tons of fragmentation also were used.\n\n...The February raid generally destroyed the easterly half of the plant, where aircraft manufacture was centered.\n\n... The loss of output from the February raid, due to destruction of finished aircraft, damage to production facilities, and disruption of the processes, equaled about six to seven weeks of production, or a loss to the German Air Forces of about 140 planes. Full recuperation took place in a little over two months due to energetic and prompt measures taken with regard to rerouting of work and construction and/or equipping of dispersed factories in the near vicinity.\n\nThanks to Paul Ross for finding and submitting these photos to the museum. The first one is of Sergeant Hammontree, followed by one of him with an unidentified buddy. The last one (taken at his funeral) is of his parents, Chester and Katherine Hammontree, of the Fashion Community.\n\nWilliam G. Hargis William G. Hargis This man's enlistment record indicates that he was born in 1919, in Florida, and entered the service while a resident of Murray County, Georgia. He enlisted with the rank of Aviation Cadet, Army Air Corps, at Fort Oglethorpe, Georgia, January 7, 1942. He had two years of college and had worked in the accounting field before enlisting. He was single. Height was 67 inches and weight was 160 pounds. He was assigned service number 14077947. Two Notes: Museum later discovered that his middle name was Granville, and that he was assigned a different service number, 0-792022, when he became an officer.\n\nBoth the 1920 and 1930 Census listed this family living in Lake County, Florida. 1930 recorded them as Benjamin F. Hargis, age 40, born in Tenn.; Beulah Hargis, age 42, born in Tenn.; Charles Hargis, age 15, born in Tenn.; Virginia Hargis, age 13, born in Tenn.; Will G. Hargis, age 10, born in Florida; June Hargis, age 4, born in Florida; and David Hargis, age 1, born in Florida.\n\nThe newspaper article reporting his death indicated that William G. Hargis held the rank of Captain. He was killed in action February 23, 1945, when his plane was shot down over Germany. He was buried in grave number A-35-21 at Ardennes American Cemetery & Memorial, Neuville-en-Condroz, Liege, Belgium.\n\nThe Chatsworth Times reported in their issue dated April 5, 1945, the following: \"Capt. W. D. Hargis is Missing. Capt. William D. Hargis, of the Air Force, son of Mr. and Mrs. Ben F. Hargis, of Deland, Florida, formerly of Murray County, and the brother of Charles Hargis, of Crandall, has been reported missing over Germany since February 23, it has been learned here.\n\nCapt. Hargis is a member of the famed \"Pioneer Fighters\" Bomber group of the Ninth Air Force which has the record of destroying 680 enemy aircraft in one year.\"\n\nThanks to Robert Green's tenacity, the museum now has a photo of Captain Bill Hargis. Robert contacted Charlotte Hansird Pritchett, a long-time resident of Crandall; she contacted Margaret Edmonston, a niece of Captain Hargis. Margaret's dad, Charles Hargis, had been a brother to Bill. Thanks to all.\n\nMajor new material added May 2012\n\nA German man recently sent the Murray County Museum an eye-witness account of the downing of an American fighter plane piloted by Captain Bill Hargis who entered the service from Murray County, Georgia.\n\nAlfred Buchholz, at that time 12 years old, knew that Allied planes came to this area daily in the final year of the war and that the German Army was constantly watching for them.\n\nThe Germans had positioned three flak guns near the small village of Weilmunster, near Koblenz, northwest of Wiesbaden. One of flak guns was concealed in a wooded area, the other was in a hole in an open field. The third gun was mounted on one of the train cars. German soldiers Alfred thought to have been 18-20 years old were positioned beside all three gun positions.\n\nWhen, on the late afternoon of February 23, 1945, they heard the engines of two planes approaching, they made certain that the train's locomotive was spewing a very visible cloud of steam into the air to attract the pilot's attention. Alfred distinctly remembers that one of the young soldiers that he was talking with, pulled him into the hole where the gun was located. Alfred said that the American plane flew lower in order to get a closer look at the train. Before the pilot realized that he had flown into a trap, two of the flak guns fired. He said that the shots that doomed the airplane were fired from the flak mounted on the train.\n\nAlfred Buchholz said that the plane was on fire, and when it crashed into the woods near Audenschmiede, some 4 kilometers away, he could clearly see the fireball created by the exploding fighter plane.\n\nNaturally this young boy was eager to see the crashed plane, so he quickly rode his bicycle to the scene. He said that the plane had been completely destroyed and the pilot's badly damaged body was hanging in the trees.\n\nAlfred remembers that when he reached the crash site, several civilians had arrived before him. The crash had torn apart the airplane so debris was scattered over a wide area. He said that they were busily trying to remove from the scene anything they thought they might be able to use. Alfred's father was already retrieving aluminum sheet metal from the plane debris. He used that sheet metal to make cooking pots and utensils; all metal was very scarce in Germany by that time so everyone was taking whatever they could remove quicklybefore the Army came.\n\nAlfred reported that civilians took the pilot's remains from the trees and buried him in the cemetery, at Rohnstadt, very close to the crash site.\n\nGerman officials quickly removed the remaining larger debris, such as the motor, which had been too heavy and bulky for any of the civilians to haul away. Tiny pieces of metal remained strewn across a wide area of the woods and nearby fields.\n\nYears Later\n\nAlfred's nephew, Jurgen Radu, was born long after the war and grew up in the town of Weilmunster where he continues to live today. Over the years he heard stories of at least 7 planes that had crashed in the surrounding area.\n\nIn 2006 Jurgen bought a metal detector and began to search for these crash sites. He said that he remembered in 2011 that his mother had told him there was an American fighter plane that had crashed near Audenschmiede. So he drove there and asked people he saw on the street about the crash. They told him the general area where they had heard the plane had crashed.\n\nThe following weekend Jurgen took his metal detector and began his search. Since nobody could tell him the exact crash site, he found no metal fragments from the plane until late the second day. He kept finding pieces of the wrecked plane and eventually some of those even had part numbers on them. Jurgen said that there was still a depression in the ground that had been made by the crashed plane's impact.\n\nHe returned several times and continued to find pieces of the plane in the woods and out in the field. He made his most important find in the summer of 2011. Alerted by the sound of his metal detector, he began to dig in the open field where he had earlier found fragments from the plane. His heart must have rushed a bit when he saw that he had found a man's ring! Not just any man's ring, he realized with excitement. It had to be a ring that had belonged to the pilot. Inscribed inside the ring: W. G. Hargis.\n\nHe had discovered the identity of the pilot that his uncle had watched shot from the sky in 1945.\n\nJurgen used Google searches to learn much about the American pilot. He found once-classified U.S. Army documents bearing the name, William Granville Hargis. These included the Missing Air Crew Report, a map used for the mission in which Capt. Hargis died, and an eye-witness account of the shoot-down filed by the pilot of the second plane seen by the Germans that dayit flew away and returned to base.\n\nThe Missing Air Crew Report, dated February 26, 1945, states that Capt. William Granville, Hargis, service number 0-792022, was missing in action. He had been on an armed reconnaissance flight from his base at Rosieres, France to Wurnsburg, Germany, between Koblenz and Frankfurt. The report states that enemy anti-aircraft fire hit the plane and that it crashed at 1615 hours (4:15 p.m.), February 23, 1945. No parachute was seen and no one was seen walking away from the doomed plane.\n\n\"Statement by 2nd Lieutenant Clarence G. Koerber,\n\nattached to the Missing Air Crew Report:\n\nOn the 23rd of February 1945 the squadron was on armed recon. mission. I was flying Capt. Hargis wing until the time he crashed.\n\nWe were straffing in the vicinity north of Frankfurt. Capt. Hargis called in a train which was located off our left wing. The engine had steam up. Capt. Hargis and myself turned and started down on the train. We were on the deck, just as we pulled over the train we encountered intense 20 mm flak from the nearby woods and I saw a fire flash on Capt. Hargis's plane. The plane went directly into the woods which were approximately 150 feet from the train. There was a terrific explosion as the plane hit the trees.\n\nI pulled up and tried to get a fix, but Rip. #5 was unable to give our definite position. The approximate location of the crash is coordinate M-3588.\"\n\n(Signed) Clarence G. Koerber.\n\nThis is an eye-witness account of what another American pilot saw from the air. It seems extremely unusual to have eye-witness accounts from opposing sides in the war: in this case a German civilian on the ground and an American soldier from the air.\n\nJurgen did another Google search using William Hargis and World War II and Germany, that resulted in only 3 hits. The first one was to http://www.murraycountymuseum.com. When Jurgen read the information posted about the dead airman, he contacted the museum to say he had substantial new information about Capt. Hargis.\n\nSeveral e-mail exchanges followed. Jurgen and his daughter, Janina, provided numerous photographs of his piles of airplane pieces, then his organized display cases highlighting those fragments of Capt. Hargis's doomed fighter plane. They also provided photos of the ring that had belonged to Capt. Hargis.\n\nThanks to Jurgen Radu's finds, friends and relatives of Capt. Bill Hargis now know far more about his death than any ever expected to learn. The museum only had the photo of Capt. Bill Hargis, so we are profoundly grateful for the new information and photographs.\n\nCaption: Ring found some distance from plane's impact site\n\nCaption: Ring clearly belonged to an American pilot.\n\nCaption: Inscription is W.

Higdon The 1930 Census listed him in the household of John B. and Naomi Higdon, in Alaculsa, Murray County, Georgia. The household included John B. Higdon, age 56; Naomi Higdon, age 52; Ollie M. Higdon, age 25; William E. Higdon, age 20; John M. Higdon, age 17; and Charles C. Higdon, age 6. The Census indicated that Charles was a grandson who had been born in Oregon. It also indicated that the boy's father had been born in Georgia.\n\nRather than calling him Conway, folks opted to call him Connie.\n\nNo enlistment form for this man was found. He was listed in the U. S. Rosters of World War II Dead, 1939-1945, as Conway C. Higdon, white, male, Protestant. He was an Army, 2nd Lieutenant, Service number 715539, buried in Chattanooga National Cemetery. He died August 21, 1944.\n\nOn September 7, 1944, The Chatsworth Times reported his death. \"Conway Higdon Killed in Italy. Second Lieutenant Conway C. Higdon, grandson of Mrs. Naomi Higdon, of Cisco, was killed in a plane accident in Italy on August 21, according to a telegram to Mrs. Higdon from the War Department received September 4. Lieutenant Higdon was the son of the late Mr. and Mrs. Charles Higdon. Besides Mrs. Higdon, he is survived by one sister, Miss Star Higdon, of Aspen, Colo., and his maternal grandmother, Mrs. Lillian Conway, of Aspen, Colo.\n\nThe officer, who was 21 years old, was born in Mill City, Oregon, but lived in Cisco from the age of two until a few years ago. He attended Murray County High School, Ensley High School in Birmingham, Ala., and Howard University at Birmingham. Before entering the service he was employed at Timkin Detroit Axle Company. He was graduated and received his commission in the Air Corps at Foster Field, Victoria, Texas, on March 12, 1944. Shortly after that he visited his grandmother at Cisco.\"\n\nIn that same newspaper, a regular column titled Cisco News, Bernita Harris wrote: \"Another gold star goes into a window this week and with it goes a small village into mourningmourning for one of our fine sons lost in the cause.\n\nLast Monday, Mrs. Naomi Higdon received word from the War Department that her grandson, 2nd Lieutenant Conway C. Higdon had been killed in Italy in an airplane accident.\n\nFriends went to the Higdon home to offer condolences to the bereavedonly to find no words to express what was in their hearts. They came away to go about their daily chores in stricken silence.\n\nSomehow we tried to comprehend this awful thing, we kept thinking of Connienot as a pilot of a fighter plane but as a little white-haired boy who had a liking for saltines and pecan pies. As his second-grade teacher, we remembered how he most always left his coat at school, his advanced ideas for a 7-year-old, the intensity with which he discussed a subject he loved, and how he always had his nose in a book oblivious to everything around him.\n\nDuring those times when a boy must find an outlet for his artistic talents, Connie invariably came out with a new and improved airplane. (In a two-room school, art as a separate subject can hardly find a practical place in the curriculum.)\n\nYears later came college days. There was a time during the Christmas holidays when we all went caroling. The youngsters away at school always looked forward to this season as a sort of reunion.\n\nFinally the war came and Connie knew right away what he wanted. He applied for a place as cadet in the Army Air Corps. He was accepted and there followed months of hard work which finally bore fruit. He was commissioned a 2nd Lieutenant in the Army Air Corps in the spring.\n\nIt was hard to believe this distinguished purposeful young lieutenant wearing his wings could be our own Connie.\n\nYes, I think if Lt. Higdon could come back, his choice would remain unchanged. He loved his work dearly and we feel that he knew from the beginning that some must die that others might live.\n\nI think that all of use will carry this mental epitaph for Connie as long as we live: Christ's own words, John 15:13 Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.'\" Thanks to Paul Ross for this photo of Connie Higdon, doing his job.\n\nThe boy on right end is Connie Higdon at Cisco School in 1932. Extracted from a group photo.\n\nMUSEUM FINDS NEW DETAILS ABOUT\n\nWORLD WAR II DEATH OF CONNIE HIGDON\n\nBy Herman McDaniel\n\nWhen the Army Air Corps notified the family of Conway C. Higdon that the aviator had died in World War II, the cause of death was simply given as \"a plane accident.\"\n\nRecently discovered documents in National Archives provide details of the death of this Murray County manConnie Higdon actually died while piloting a fighter plane in aerial combat.\n\nThe official Missing Air Crew Report, dated July 16, 1944, was signed by 1st Lt. Harold R. Thysell, Assistant Operations Officer at Triolo, Italy. It indicates that members of the 48th Fighter Squadron were flying at high altitude, well above bombers they were escorting from Italy to targets in Budapest, Hungary. Weather was described as having a slight haze, with scattered clouds.\n\nThe heavily armed fighter planes each carried only the pilot.\n\nAt approximately 10:15, July 14, 1944, two of the fighter planes were last seen by fellow pilots. No radio calls were received and none of the pilots saw any damage to either of the planes that went down. None of the Americans reported seeing either parachutes or plane crashes. The military situation was so extremely dangerous that no search was possible. The remaining American planes returned to their base in Italy.\n\nLt. Connie Higdon, from Murray County, was the pilot of one of the missing fighter planes, Lt. Gustaf Kenneth Strom, from McKeesport, Pennsylvania, piloted the second one.\n\nAttached to the recently discovered Missing Air Crew Report was a statement made by 2nd Lt. Henry Van Horn, a pilot who flew in a position very near that of the two missing planes.\n\nVan Horn reported as follows: \"The 48th Fighter Squadron was flying an altitude escort mission to Budapest, Hungary, on July 14, 1944. Lieut. Strom and Lieut. Higdon were flying no. 2 and no. 3 positions, respectively in Red flight. I was flying no. 4 position in the same flight. Before reaching the target our squadron sighted about 25 E/A (enemy aircraft) about to attack the bombers. In an effort to break up this attack we dove down upon the formation of E/A. Because of the difficulty encountered in recovering from this highspeed dive, our flight became separated. This occurred at approximately 10:15 and was the last time that Lieut. Higdon and Lieut. Strom were seen by any member of our squadron. When I recovered from the dive I was unable to locate Red flight so I filled in a vacancy in another flight and returned to base with them.\"\n\nAddition information about Connie Higdon, including remembrances from one of his Murray County teachers, is available in the World War II section of http://www.murraycountymuseum.com.\n\nGeorge H. Hill The 1930 Census listed George H. Hill, then age 8, living in Militia District 870, Chattooga County, Georgia. The family consisted of: Milligan, age 46, born in Alabama; Savannah, age 46, born in Georgia; James M., age 19, born in Georgia; Robert Henry, age 15, born in Georgia; Mary Lou, age 10, born in Georgia, George H., age 8, born in Alabama; and Luke C. Hill, age 5, born in Alabama.\n\nCarolyn Luffman spoke with Mary Dill in the Sumach community to see if she knew anything about George Hill. What a pleasant surprise\"Miss Mary\" apparently knew George and his family fairly well.\n\n\"Miss Mary\" Dill remembers George as \"a very nice young man.\" They attended Sumach school together. She said that the family lived south of Sumach Church on the Rickett place, then later they moved north of the church and lived on the Oma Jean Dunn place.\n\n\"Miss Mary\" also remembered various members of the family, saying that the father was Milligan and the mother was called Sarah. She remembers a sister she thinks was called Mary Louise, a brother named Luke, and another brother she thinks was Malcolm.\n\nThe details in the preceding paragraph confirms that the family living in Chattooga County in 1930 was the same family that later lived in Murray.\n\nTwo Hill family members, Lake Isaac Hill and his mother, Evelyn Helton Hill, provided extensive additional information. The father, Isaac Milligan Hill, was born August 28, 1889 and died March 1, 1959. The mother, Sarah Savannah (Brown) Hill, was born September 11, 1884 and died November 9, 1961.\n\nThe dead soldiers paternal grandparents were Robert L. and Amanda J. Hill, listed in the 1900 Census living in Ball Ground District of Murray County. Both had been born in Georgia.\n\nGeorge H. Hill's siblings were: James Monroe Hill (Feb. 5, 1910 - May 14, 1968); Robert Henry Hill (Oct. 12, 1912 - May 4, 1992); Mary Lou Hill Snow (June 24, 1919 - Dec. 9, 1981); and Luke Christopher Hill (June 21, 1924 - March 24, 2008).\n\nHis enlistment form indicates that George H. Hill enlisted from Fayette County, Georgia on July 11, 1942. He had completed grammar school and worked as a general farm hand. He had been born in 1921 and was single with no dependents. He enlisted as a Private at Fort McPherson, Georgia. U.S. Rosters of World War II Dead, 1939-1945 simply detail that George H. Hill, white, male, was from Georgia. He was an Army Private, with service number 34353173. This service number is same as on his enlistment form. No details of how, where, and when George died were found. \"Miss Mary\" remembered no specifics but she said he lost his life soon after he entered the fighting phase of his service. She thinks is was \"something tragic, perhaps having to do with a ship.\" His family said they were told that he drowned.\n\nThe following article is from the Dalton Citizen, October 23, 1947: \"Body of Pvt. Hill Returned Here for Reburial by Barbara Sikes. While the train was in the station, for about four minutes, Wednesday, another Dalton soldier returned homereturned home in a flag-draped casketreturned home to stay.\n\nPvt. George H. Hill was met at the station by his father, a brother, an eight-man honor guard of the V.F.W., and friends who had missed him since he left Dalton a little over five years ago, just 14 months before he was drowned in New Caledonia on October 9, 1943.\n\nThe body of Pvt. Hill was the first of a Dalton veteran to be returned home for reburial. It arrived in San Francisco on October 10 on the motor-ship Honda Knot. A special train brought home the remains of Pvt. Hill and his fellow countrymen who were killed on foreign soils and foreign waters.\n\nIsaac M. Hill, the father, and Luke, the brother, stood with tear-filled eyes as the casket was being removed from the train by J. A. Smith, V.F.W. Commander, Charles Bevil, Gordon Dantzler, Cecil Wilkins, W. O. Cagle, A. G. Rann, Walter Kirk, and Dorsey Morgan of the local V.F.W. post.\n\nCpl. Thelene Cadwell was the Army honor guard who accompanied the body from Atlanta.\n\nFuneral services will be held Thursday at 3 p.m. at the First Baptist Church with the Revs. G. D. Legg, Charlie Plemons, and Edgar Hawkins officiating. Burial with full military honors will be held at West Hill Cemetery with Kenemer Brothers in charge of the funeral arrangements.\n\nPvt. Hill is survived by his parents, Mr. and Mrs. Isaac M. Hill, sister, Mrs. Marshall Snow, and brothers Monroe, Robert, and Luke Hill, all of Dalton.\"\n\nA tombstone in West Hill Cemetery, Section V, Dalton, Georgia, is inscribed: George H. Hill, July 1, 1921, October 9, 1943, Ga. Pvt. 82nd Cml. Bn. WW II. That unit was the 82nd Chemical Mortar Battalion, called \"The Jungle-Fighting CMB.\"\n\nThe family pictures were also provided by Lake Isaac Hill and his mother, Evelyn Helton Hill. The first two pictures are of George Hill, the third shows his parents, Isaac Milligan and Sarah Savannah (Brown) Hill; the fourth is of his siblings: Robert H. (Bob); (Mary) Lou Hill Snow; James (Monroe) Hill; and (Luke) Christopher Hill.\n\nThe last picture of a black granite memorial to members of the 82nd Chemical Mortar Battalion who died in the war was discovered by Herman McDaniel. This is one of several such monuments in a Memorial Grove near The Chemical Corps Museum at Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri.\n\nWilliam C. Holman was born August 25, 1916. The 1930 Census listed the family name as \"Holeman\" and showed them living in White County, Cullman, Alabama. The family was listed as William B. Holeman, age 45; Josie T. Holeman, age 52; A. D. Holeman, age 16; and William C. Holeman, age 14.\n\nWilliam C. Holman was inducted into the Army as a Private on May 21, 1942, at Fort McPherson, Georgia. On July 1, 1942, while home on leave, he was fatally wounded in an automobile accident in Chatsworth, Georgia, and died in the ambulance enroute to the hospital in Dalton. He was in Company C, 3rd Armored Replacement Battalion at Fort Knox, Kentucky. His wife was listed as Mary Kelly Holman of Chatsworth. Both William and Mary were buried in Harrison's Chapel Cemetery, Murray County.\n\nAn article in the July 2, 1942 issue of The Chatsworth Times reported his death: \"William C. Holman, Fort Knox Soldier, Killed in Accident. Funeral service for Pvt. William C. Holman, who lost his life in an automobile accident Wednesday afternoon, will be held at 4 o'clock Friday afternoon at the Chatsworth Methodist Church. Private Holman was inducted in the army on May 10 of this year and had been stationed at Fort Knox, Ky. He was at home on furlough when the automobile he was driving skidded on the wet pavement and struck a tree on Third Avenue about one block from the heart of town. He died while being carried to a Dalton hospital.\n\nSurviving Private Holman are his wife, Mrs. Mary Kelly Holman, his parents, Mr. and Mrs. W. B. Holman of Cullman, Ala.; two brothers, Robert and D. D. Holman, of Cullman, and two sisters, Mrs. Ike McBurnett and Mrs. Felton Lanier, both of Atlanta.\n\nThe Rev. W. M. Kelly, pastor of the Chatsworth Baptist Church, and the Rev. J. B. Godfrey, of Dalton, former pastor of the Chatsworth Methodist Church, will be in charge of the funeral service, with Fred Brown and Sons, funeral directors, in charge of arrangement for the burial which is to be at Harrison Chapel cemetery. Pallbearers will be Luke Cox, Vernon Bearden, Garman Elrod, Woody Glenn, Mr. Carter and Mr. Cole, both of Atlanta.\"\n\nRalph C. Jones A monument once stood in the old Spring Place Cemetery with this inscription: \"PFC Ralph C. Jones, 1915 1945, France. Ralph was the son of Carl Franklin Jones and his second wife, Bertha Williams Jones. This is just a memorial to him. During WW II he was stationed first in Italy and was wounded May 23, 1944. Then he was stationed in France and again was wounded on Sept. 10, 1944. He died in 1945 and is buried in a U.S. Military Cemetery at Epinal France. He never married.\" Nearby is the grave of his father, with the dates 1881 1936. Ralph's mother was buried in West Hill Cemetery, Dalton, Ga.\n\nThe above marker has been replaced with a traditional headstone. (See picture below)\n\nRalph's mother, Bertha Williams, was daughter of Charles Jenkins Williams and A. Patricia Baynes. In 1910 that family consisted of Charlie, age 57; no wife/mother; George, age 28; Mary S. Age 17; Cleveland, age 16; Bertha, age 15; Charlie, age 14; Billie, age 12; and Oscar A., age 10. They lived in the McDonald District of Murray County when that Census was taken.\n\nIn 1940, Bertha was listed, age 43, as head of her family's household. Ralph C. Age 23; Jack J., age 18; Gordon, age 16; Frank, age 13; and Hill Jones, age 11. That Census had a notation that Ralph had completed 6th grade and was working in textile industry full time.\n\nHis military enlistment record was not found-there were several hundred men named Ralph Jones in World War II. Family information is that Ralph was single, never married. He was single and had no dependents. His Service number was 34578980. He served in the 15th Infantry Regiment, 3rd Infantry Division. He held rank of PFC (Private First Class) and was awarded a purple heart with 2 oak leaf clusters. He died January 26, 1945, in France. He was buried in grave B 33 10 at Epinal American Cemetery, France.\n\nNote: Museum is still seeking pictures of this soldier, at any stage of his life, alone or with others.\n\nThe museum thanks Alan Jones, who lives in Locust Grove, GA, for providing the long sought picture of his nephew, PFC Ralph Jones. Alan wrote that he was going through old papers and photos that had belonged to his deceased father and came across this picture with the soldier's name on the back. He contacted the museum and provided a copy of the photo plus information about several other Jone family members' military service.\n\nThe first photo below is of Ralph at his home place, date unknown.\n\nThe second was created by enlarging a cropped area of the first photo to more clearly show Ralph's face.\n\nThree pictures from top to bottom:\n\nBertha Williams Jones (1894-1962)\n\nMonument in Old Spring Place cemetery for Pfc Jones\n\nGrave Marker in Epinal France American Cemetery for Pfc Jones\n\nBud S.

Summary of accident report for B-17G #44-83320, which crashed at Hunter Field, Georgia, February 12, 1945.\n\nBy: Craig Sheumaker\n\nApril, 2, 2017\n\nThe plane took off at 7:13am, in the dark, with the destination of Dow Field in Maine on the way to Europe. However, it failed to gain enough altitude to clear the trees at the end of the runway. It struck the trees, crashed and burned immediately. The plane was new, with about 25 hours flying time. The pilot had 281 hours as \"first pilot\" and 699 hours flying time. Pilot error was deemed the primary cause of the accident, but poorly designed (though properly operating) instruments were also given part of blame. A virtually identical accident happened on January 16, 1945 at the same airfield.\n\nPages 63 - 65 of the report have the most comprehensive description of the accident and the recommendations that were made to prevent similar accidents in the future.\n\nOf the ten men pictured in the crew photo (below) taken at Drew Field, FL, six died in the accident on February 12, 1945 at Hunter Field, GA. They are:\n\n2nd Lt. John Francis Bradley, Pilot\n\n2nd Lt. Morgan Robert Crowe, Co-Pilot\n\n2nd Lt. Leslie Marvin Becker, Navigator\n\nCpl. Ralph Hoddy Leverette, Radio Operator\n\nCpl. Donald Green, Engineer\n\nCpl. Donald Wallace Van Atta, Tail Gunner,\n\n2nd Lt. John J. Greggo, Radar Observer/Passenger, died in the crash, but is not in the photo.\n\nSgt. William D. Knight, Top Turret, survived the crash with major injuries, but subsequent history is yet to be discovered.\n\nCpl. Raymond Thurston Waddell, Ball Turret Gunner, died Feb. 25, 1945 as a result of his injuries and burns.\n\nCpl. Milan Vukelich, Armorer, was injured in the crash and required nearly a year of hospitalization to recover. After discharge he returned home, raised a family and with his wife and two brothers-in-law, co-owned a Croatian bakery called Pepelnjak's (later Pep's) in Virginia, MN near his home town of Gilbert, MN. He sold the business in 1986 and died in 2006.\n\n=======================================\n\n2nd Lt. Edgar Guest, Bombardier (in photo but not on the plane), returned from the war, married and worked as a postal clerk, but he committed suicide in 1953. There was much tragedy in his family. His brother, the first born, died at age 9 months. His older sister died at age 16 of rheumatic fever. His younger sister lived to age 67.\n\nThe museum is very grateful that Craig Sheumaker who hails from Raymond, Missouri, contact us and shared this photo and the information about the crew to be posted here. Craig is proud to be the son of Clinton S. Sheumaker, Ssgt. 320 BG, 443rd BS, USAAF.\n\nMr. Sheumaker provided interesting information about several of the crew members in this photo, even though his father was not part of this crew. He said that John Bradley died on his first mission as a pilot in Italy. He learned from the museum website that Ralph Leverette died in a plane crash in Georgia in 1944 so never went overseas. Raymond Waddell died from burns and injuries suffered in a Georgia plane crash in 1945. Milan Vukelich owned an Italian-Slovenian Bakery in St. Paul, Minnesota for many years. Robert Crow reportedly now lives in Chicago.\n\nFranklin Alexander McGinty, known as Frank, was born in 1912, the son of John Roy and Emma (Thomas) McGinty. His parents founded The Chatsworth Times, in 1913.\n\nFranklin, according to a Times article published shortly after his death, \"spent most of his youth in Chatsworth. He was a graduate of Chatsworth High School. Later he was graduated from the University of Georgia...He had studied music most of his life and was an accomplished pianist and organist.\"\n\nFrank was living in Atlanta, teaching at Lavonia High School, just prior to joining the Navy.\n\nHis brother, Roy McGinty, Jr., followed in their father's footsteps, became publisher of The Chatsworth Times.\n\nFranklin's parents received a letter from the Secretary of the Navy, dated September 23, 1943 that read as follows: \"You were recently informed by telegram from the Bureau of Naval Personnel that your son, Franklin Alexander McGinty, Soundman third class, USNR, had been report \"missing.\" He was a member of the crew, attached to the USS Plymouth, when that ship was sunk on 5 August 1943 as a result of an underwater explosion of unknown origin off the coast of North Carolina. The ship was set afire by the explosion and sank in approximately three and a half minutes.\n\nPlanes dropped rubber boats and life jackets, which assisted the survivors to remain afloat until rescued. The survivors were taken to Norfolk, Virginia, where many were treated for injuries sustained in the sinking. Although the body of your son was not recovered, upon reviewing the circumstances surround the loss of the vessel as reported by a formal Board of Investigation, I am reluctantly forced to the conclusion that your son lost his life in the disaster.\"\n\nA subsequent article in the January 20, 1944, issue of The Chatsworth Times, reported President Cites Frank McGinty for Heroism. Franklin A. McGinty, soundman, third class, USNR, son of Mr. and Mrs. J. Roy McGinty, of Calhoun, has been presented posthumously, the Navy Cross for extreme heroism while serving on the USS Plymouth when it was sunk on August 5, according to a dispatch from Secretary of the Navy Frank Knox.\n\nThe citation of the President awarding the Navy Cross reads: For extraordinary heroism while serving aboard the USS Plymouth during and after the sinking of that vessel on August 5, 1943. When there was an underwater explosion amidships, causing devastating fires and extensive damage, McGinty unhesitatingly risked his life in behalf of his endangered shipmates. In a courageous attempt to rescue a man known to be trapped in the ship's flaming armory, McGinty entered the compartment and himself trapped. He gallantly gave his life in the service of his country.'\"\n\nAlthough most people don't seem to remember it, the Navy launched on August 5, 1944, a destroyer escort vessel that was christened the USS McGinty (DE-365). This vessel was 306 feet long and 36' 8\" wide, and had a speed of 24 knots. It carried a complement of 14 officers and 201 enlisted men. It was built by the Consolidated Steel Corporation in just over 3 months, in Orange, Texas.\n\nAfter a shakedown cruise near Bermuda, followed by training along the east coast of the United States, the McGinty departed Norfolk, Virginia, December 4, 1944, for escort duty in the western Pacific. Astonishingly a vessel named for a sailor who died August 5, 1943, was built and launched August 5, 1944! It was actively engaged in the war in which the ship's namesake had died less than 18 months after the sailor's death!\n\nFrank's father, J. Roy McGinty, Sr., and stepmother traveled to Orange, Texas, for the August 5, 1944, launch of the USS McGinty. Frank's older brother, J. Roy McGinty, Jr., and sister-in-law also attended the launch. Upon their return to Georgia, Frank's brother (then Editor) published the following article in the Chatsworth Times:\n\n\"U.S.S. McGinty Is Launched Orange, Texas, August 5  The United States Navy paid tribute today to a Georgian who lost his life in a heroic effort to save a shipmate. A ship was launched for him.\n\nThe Georgian was the late Franklin Alexander McGinty, Son of Mr. And Mrs. J. Roy McGinty, of Calhoun, Ga., and the ship is a new destroyer escort.\n\nMcGinty, who was rated a sound-man by the Navy, was aboard the U.S.S. Plymouth when she was torpedoed and sunk by enemy fire in the Atlantic on August 5, 1943. He died in an effort to rescue a shipmate from the craft.\n\nHis father is editor of the Calhoun Times, and a past president of the Georgia Press Association.\n\nThe new destroyer escort McGinty was launched today from the ways of the shipbuilding division of the Consolidated Steel Corporation, Ltd.\n\nThe slim warship slid gracefully into the waters of the Sabine river after being christened by Mrs. Henry T. Malone, of Gadsden, Ala., stepsister of the Navy hero, and was towed to the outfitting docks to be prepared for early convoy duty for the Navy.\n\nMrs. Malone broke the traditional bottle of champagne on the bow of the McGinty, a ceremony attended by several thousand workers, with Harvey C. Cranfill, Consolidated vice-president, as master of ceremonies. On the launching platform with Mrs. Malone were Mr. and Mrs. J. Roy McGinty, Sr., parents of the hero, of Calhoun; Mrs. and Mrs. J. Roy McGinty, Jr., his brother and sister-in-law, of Chatsworth; Navy Lt and Mrs. Charles Cline, representing Navy Secretary Forrestal; and Mrs. and Mrs. Carl Engstrom, representing the production staff of the shipyard.\n\nThe McGinty joins the great flotilla of more than 200 fighting ships launched at the Consolidated yard since Pearl Harbor. She will go into action bearing the name of a Dixie son who enlisted at Macon on August 17, 1942, and who, after training at Norfolk and Key West, was assigned to duty aboard the ill-fated Plymouth. For the heroic act in which he lost his life, he was posthumously awarded the Navy Cross.\n\nFollowing the launching ceremony, members of the official party were guests at a luncheon by the shipbuilding company.\"\n\nPhotos are of the USS Plymouth (ship that was sunk by German Uboat); Franklin Alexander McGinty; and the USS McGinty (ship named in dead sailor's honor).\n\nBen Moore, Jr. The museum's efforts to positively identify this man almost failed, simply because none of Murray's senior citizens, white and black, remembered that one of Murray's war dead in that conflict had been black. Thanks are due Paul Ross and Mrs. Shirley Willis for providing both background and detailed family information, enabling the museum to include this man's story.\n\nBen's father and mother were Ben and Ethel Moore. The Census of 1920 listed the family as: Ben Moore, age 39; Ethel Moore, age 35; Roy Moore, age 10; Loney Moore, age 7; Annie M. Moore; age 4, and Cora Moore, age 2, living in the Ball Ground District of Murray County. The family of farmers worked on the Carter Plantation.\n\nBen's grandparents were listed in the 1870 Census as Edenborough Moore, age 24; Irene Moore, age 22; Emily Moore, age 4, Revener Moore, age 2, and Logan Moore, 3 months. This was the first census to list names of free, black citizens.\n\nThe 1880 Census added 5 children to the household: Ida, age 8, Lila, age 4, John N., age 3, and twins, age 1 month.\n\nRecords from the 1890 Census were destroyed in a fire.\n\nThe 1900 Census listed Arritta Moore, then age 50, as head of the household. Two sons were also listed: Elbert Moore, age 18, and Benjamin L. Moore, age 15.\n\nThis appears to mean that Sergeant Ben Moore, Jr.'s grandfather had been a slave on the Carter Plantation.\n\nA Negro soldier named Ben Moore, Jr., born 1921, enlisted in the Army from Whitfield County on November 22, 1942. He enlisted at Fort Benning as a Private. The enlistment form indicates that he had completed grammar school, then worked as a farm hand prior to entering the service. He stood 70 inches tall and weighed 162 pounds upon enlistment. He was assigned service number 34557110. At that time the U.S. military was still segregated.\n\nAfter completing his training, Ben was assigned to the 370th Infantry Regiment, 92nd Infantry Division, one of only two all-black infantry divisions sent to Europe in World War II. Ben's outfit arrived in Italy in the summer of 1944 and was first in combat August 23. They were engaged in combat near Massa Italy, starting October 5th. Sergeant Ben Moore, Jr., was killed in action on October 7, 1944. The unit was credited with eliminating numerous machine-gun nests.\n\nSergeant Ben Moore, Jr., was buried in Florence American Cemetery, Italy, Plot G, Row 1, Grave 2.\n\nAlthough Sergeant Moore probably is not in the photo below, this picture of his unit was taken the week that he was killed. Mrs. Shirley Willis provided the picture of Sergeant Moore in uniform.\n\nThe following photograph of the grave marker for Ben Moore, Jr., was obtained through teamwork involving Robert Green, Joy Riggers, Tina Young, and John Iuncheon. Thanks to All.\n\nWilburn L. Page was born in Tennessee in 1924. His parents were Zenith and Hattie Page. The 1930 Census listed the family living in McDonald District of Murray County.

He was single and had no dependents. He enlisted as a Private, April 20, 1943, at Fort McPherson, Atlanta. His service number was 34768412 At the time of his death he had earned a Bronze Star with Oak Leaf Cluster and held the rank of Sergeant in the Army. His service number was 34768412. He was serving with the 9th Infantry Regiment, 2nd Infantry Division in France where he was killed August 31, 1944. He was buried in Grave L-13-6 at Brittany American Cemetery, which is also called Saint James.\n\nOn September 28, 1944, The Chatsworth Times ran the following article: \"Wilburn L. Page Killed in France. Wilburn L. Page, son of Mrs. and Mrs. Zenith Page, who lives near Cisco, was killed in France on August 31, according to a telegram from the War Department received by his parents this week. Besides his parents, the soldier is survived by one sister, Marie Page, and four brothers, Leroy, Leonard, Hugh, and Bill Page.\"\n\nThanks to Paul Ross for locating two of Wilburn's relatives, Isaac Walker, Jr. And Linda Page Phillips, who provided these two pictures.\n\nThe following photograph of Wilburn Page's grave marker was obtained through teamwork involving Robert Green, Joy Riggers, and Walter Benjamin. Thanks to all!\n\nJess Willard Patterson was born in 1916 in Georgia. The Census for 1920 listed the family living in the Eighth District of Gordon County, Georgia. Family consisted of John Patterson, age 32; Lizzie Patterson, age 22; Jesse Patterson, age 4; Etta Jane Patterson, age 1. Everyone in the family had been born in Georgia. The 1930 Census listed Jesse, age 13, living with his maternal grandparents, David T. and Aveline Millsap in Fannin County, Georgia.\n\nHis enlistment form shows that he had completed grammar school and worked in the lumber industry. He was single with no dependents. He was 75 inches tall and weighed 175 pounds. He enlisted as a Private on July 17, 1942 at Fort Jackson, South Carolina. His service number was 34129809.

Ponders was the son of Lawrence A., and Roxie Ponders. The family was enumerated in the 1930 Census living in Talking Rock, Pickens County, Georgia. Lawrence A., age 33; Roxie, age 25; Garland, age 11; Ruby, age 8; Wilborn, age 6; Willard, age 4;and Willie Ponders, age 2.\n\nWilborn's enlistment form shows that he was born in 1923, in Georgia. It indicates that he was residing in Murray County, Georgia, just prior to enlisting. His home immediately prior to enlisting was stated as Murray County, Georgia. Wilborn had completed grammar school, then worked at a sawmill. The enlistment form indicated that he was single. He was 68 inches tall and weighed 145 pounds. He enlisted as a Private on January 23, 1943, at Fort McPherson, Atlanta. His service number was 34685928. He was serving as a Private First Class with the 38th Infantry Regiment, 2nd Infantry Division, in Belgium when he was killed, January 31, 1945. He was buried in grave E-1-50 at Henri-Chapelle American Cemetery in Belgium. Smyrna Baptist Church Cemetery in Murray County has a marker over an empty grave that reads as follows: \"Wilburn M. \"Jay\" Ponders, June 17, 1923 - January 31, 1945. He gave his life for his country in Belgium during WW II. Buried Henri Chapelle Cemetery in Belgium.\"\n\nIn an extremely brief article The Chatsworth Times published in the issue of February 22, 1945, the following: \" Jay\" Ponders Killed in Action. Pfc. Wilbur J. (better known as \"Jay\") Ponders has been reported killed in action in Belgium. The soldier was the son of Mr. and Mrs. Lawrence Ponders of Ramhurst.\"\n\nIn January 2012 Paul Ross learned that Willie Ponders, Jr., was a nephew to Jay and put him in touch with the museum. Willie provided names of all Jay's siblings: Garland, Ruby, Mutt, Clifford, Clem, Tony, Neal, Ruth, Mary Jewel, Annie Mae, Gerlein, and, of course Willie Ponders. The last named was Willie Jr.'s father.\n\nSmyrna Church Cemetery also has markers for Jay's parents, Lawrence and Roxie, as well as five of his brothers.\n\nWillie Ponders provided this photo of his Uncle Jay.\n\nWilliam B. Rucker was born February 18, 1924, in Knox County, Tennessee. The 1930 Census lists his family as W. B. Rucker, age 50, a school teacher; Roberta Rucker, age 35; James M. Rucker, age 13; and W. B. Rucker, age 6. The younger son listed was Ben.\n\nSometime in the 1930s the Ruckers moved to Murray County, into a large house just above present-day Fairy Valley Church on Highway 411. Ben attended Murray County High School, graduating with honors in the spring of 1940.\n\nW. B. Rucker gave land upon which to build that church in 1938. Mr. Rucker died around 1940, his wife remarried a few years later and left Murray County.\n\nRoberta Rucker's parents were Frank W. and Susan C. McCamy. Frank reportedly was born in Spring Place but the family in 1900 lived in Blairsville, Union County, Georgia. The 1910 Census listed them in Polk County, Tennessee.\n\nThis man's enlistment record lists him as William B. Rucker, Army serial number 14119034. It indicates that he enlisted at Knoxville Tennessee, June 10, 1942 as a Private in the Infantry. That record listed his residence at Georgia, specifically Murray County. He had two years of college. Although he enlisted as a Private, he was commissioned a Second Lieutenant and assigned a new Army serial number, 548867, denoting that he had become an officer.\n\nA roster of war dead indicates that William B. Rucker, an Army Second Lieutenant, service number 548867, was killed in action in Germany. It contained no specifics.\n\nThe Chatsworth Times revealed a few personal details of this man's life in their article published January 4, 1945: \"Lt. Ben Rucker Killed in Action. Lt. William Ben Rucker, 20, was killed in action on December 15 in the European area, according to a telegram from the War Department received by his mother, Mrs. W. B. Rucker, formerly of Fairy, who is now teaching in the public schools of Knoxville, Tenn.\n\nLieutenant Rucker, an honor graduate of the 1940 class at Murray County High School, was a talented musician and an outstanding student throughout his high school career here. He won second place in piano in the Seventh District school meet in his senior year, the student activities medal that year, and first place in Murray High awards for music students for two consecutive years.\n\nThe young officer was a senior at the University of Tennessee, studying agriculture when he volunteered for the Army Reserve in June 1942. He went on active duty in April 1943, receiving his commission as second lieutenant at Fort Benning in May, 1944, and was overseas in October. Lieutenant was a member of the \"Lightning\" Infantry Division. In addition to his mother, he is survived by a foster brother, Lt. (j.g.) James M. Rucker, now stationed in San Diego, Calif.\"\n\nIn February 2012, the museum learned some background of Ben Rucker's familyfrom two men that he served with in the Army! His mother was Roberta McCamy, born April 19, 1894, the daughter of Franklin Wellington and Claudia Susan Griffin. His father was William Benjamin, born in 1880. They named their son William Benjamin Rucker.\n\nBen Rucker was assigned to Company E, 309th Infantry, stationed at Camp Pickett, Virginia, prior to the unit being deployed to Europe. His unit engaged German soldiers inside Germany but very close to the Belgian border. The fighting there is referred to now as the first battle of Kesternich, Germany. Keith Mygrants, a member of the same company, said that Lt.
