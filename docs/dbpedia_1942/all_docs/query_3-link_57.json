        "text": "Hugh Turner was born on 16 February 1915, the son of Mr. Ernest Hammond Turner, J.P., and Mrs. Violet Inez Turner. He joined the Royal Navy as a Cadet on 1 May 1932 and served in the Battleship HMS MALAYA. He was promoted to Midshipman on 1 January 1933 and appointed to HMS DORSETSHIRE (Sixth Cruiser Squadron, Africa Station) on 1 July 1933.\n\nHe was promoted Sub Lieutenant on 1 January 1936 and appointed to HMS DOLPHIN for the Submarine Course on 31 August 1936. On 23 December 1936 he was appointed to HMS FAREHAM, Mediterranean Station. This was followed by an appointment to HMS PROTEUS, at Hong Kong, as Third Hand on 15 April 1937. On 19 May 1939 he was appointed to HMS DOLPHIN, for HMS TRIAD as Navigating Officer. On 15 February 1940, he was appointed to HMS L27 as the First Lieutenant, then HMS TAKU as First Lieutenant from 15 May 1940 until 12 October 1941.\n\nHugh Turner undertook his Commanding Officer Qualifying Course from 17 November 1941 to 1 January 1942 and he was appointed to HMS H50 in command. This was followed by an appointment to HMS UNRIVALLED in command on 22 March 1942. On 1 April 1943 HMS UNRIVALLED joined the Tenth Submarine Flotilla based in Malta. Hugh Turner was awarded the DSC – see London Gazette dated 2 July 1943.\n\nHe was appointed to HMS PORPOISE, at Trincomalee, Ceylon in Command, with the rank of Acting Lieutenant Commander on 21 November 1944. On 3 January 1945 HMS PORPOISE left Trincomalee for her twenty third war patrol with orders to lay a minefield off Penang. A report was received on 9 January 1945 that the minefield had been laid but no further signals were received from PORPOISE. It is understood that a Japanese aircraft reported making an attack on a submarine on 11 January. More attacks were made during the day and on the following day and it is believed that HMS PORPOISE was lost with all hands because of these attacks.\n\nHugh Turner is Commemorated on the Portsmouth Naval War Memorial on Panel No. 88 Column no 3\n\nFrom the Chelmsford Chronicle Friday 22nd January 1943\n\nLieut. John B. Turner, son of Mr. E. H. Turner, J.P, has been awarded the Military Cross. He led an attack on an enemy column in the Middle East, which resulted the capture of 120 Germans and 15 lorries. His brother, Lieut. Cecil Turner, who was killed in the Middle East in 1941, also gained the M.C. A third brother, Lieut. Hugh Bentley Turner, has distinguished himself in the submarine service, and the submarine under his command has sunk a small ship bound for Tripoli with supplies for the enemy, and another small ship thought to be carrying ammunition."
