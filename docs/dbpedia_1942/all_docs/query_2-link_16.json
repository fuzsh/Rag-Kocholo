In January 1911 he went to work for National Provincial Bank of England as an apprentice at Kirkley, a sub-branch to Lowestoft. In January 1914 he was promoted to a clerkship there, and in May he transferred to the bank's London South Kensington branch. He moved to Wareham branch in July 1915.\n\nDuring the First World War Turner left the bank to go on military service, becoming a Private in the London Regiment.
