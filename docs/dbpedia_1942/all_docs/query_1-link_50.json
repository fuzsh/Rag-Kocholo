        "text": "It is with heavy hearts that we announce the passing of Wanda R. Turner, a beloved soul who left a profound impact on all who were fortunate enough to know her.\n\nWanda was born on November 1st, 1934, in Bowling Green, Kentucky to the late Lydia York Pedigo and Elmore Preston Pedigo. Wanda's creative talents led her to pursue a career as a seamstress at Brunts Menswear, where her meticulous skills and attention to detail shone through in every garment she touched.\n\nOne of Wanda's joys in life was providing a nurturing home daycare for many years, touching the lives of countless children and their families with her kindness and care. Her compassion knew no bounds, and her home was always filled with laughter and love.\n\nOutside of work, Wanda found solace and joy in her hobbies and interests. She always had a green thumb, tending to her garden with great dedication year after year. Wanda's passion for preserving and canning food not only filled her pantry but also brought people together over delicious homemade meals.\n\nIn 1949, Wanda married the love of her life, Cecil H. Turner, with whom she shared 55 years of unwavering companionship and devotion until his passing in 2005.\n\nAlong with her parents and husband, she is preceded in death by her grandson, Gregory Gadd.\n\nWanda leaves behind a legacy of love and kindness that will forever be cherished by her surviving family and friends. She is survived by her 2 daughters, Wanda L. (Dennis) Gadd and Patricia F. (Andrew) Bryson; 6 grandchildren Jennifer L. (J.J.) Hogg, Amy M. (Joseph) Elverson, Neal (Kristin) Fredrickson, Justin (Fernie) B., Hiliary (Kevin) B.;17 great-grandchildren Noah H., Emma H., Lily H., Joshua Gadd, Gregory Gadd, Jacob Gadd, Katherine Gadd, Jerimah Gadd, Olivia Elverson, Logan Elverson; Owen F., Reagan F.; Allison B., Jack B., Luke B., Sutton B., and Sydney B.; along with 2 great-great-grandchildren Raelynn and Emerie.\n\nWanda's memory will live on in the hearts of those who knew and loved her."
