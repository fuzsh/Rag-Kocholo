        "text": "Glad to get off the Sea Pike, the 511th PIR boarded DUKWs and headed inland to Dobodura airstrips for six months of intense jungle training. They erected pyramidal tents by companies, built \"kitchens\" and relaxation areas and headed into the hills and mountains of the Owen Stanley Range to learn bushcraft and how to hunt the Japanese. The Angels stole food, weapons and equipment, including vehicles, from nearby units and consistently snuck into the nearby WAAC compound, bypassing the MPs on the way. The paratroopers enjoyed USO shows, gambled late into the night, and continued to hone their already deadly skills with countless practice jumps, field problems, firing drills and more. They then boarded ships for a 2,100 mile journey to Leyte.\n\nThe Angels quickly unloaded their AKAs and APAs on Bito Beach, forty miles south of Tacloban. Moving inland, the division relieved the 7th Infantry Division before heading up into Leyte's mountains to destroy the island's main Japanese supply line. Carrying their ammunition and 3 days rations, the Angels headed into \"The Green Hell\" and over the next thirty days they endured hunger, monsoon rains, mud, steep terrain, volcanic rock and banzai attacks out of the night's darkness. Countless paratroopers became deathly sick with malaria and/or dysentery while they fought the Japanese further into the mountains, carrying their wounded with them. Coming down from the mountains on Christmas Day, the Angels marched into Ormoc after destroying 5,760 of the enemy and earning 96 Silver Stars, 6 Soldier’s Medals, 90 Air Medals and 423 Bronze Stars.\n\nThe majority of the 11th Airborne landed amphibiously at Nagsubu on Luzon and pushed inland through fierce enemy resistance outside Aga. On February 3 the 511th PIR jumped on Tagaytay Ridge and once the rest of the division arrived, the Angels pushed up towards southern Manila where they encountered and destroyed the intimidating Genko Line, the enemy's defensive line that utilized concrete pillbox, machine gun nests, naval and anti-aircraft guns, mines, and other deadly obstacles. With minimum artillery support, the Angels fought into the city and liberated Cavite, Fort McKinley, Nichols Field, and more. The division then turned east and then south to eliminate heavy areas of enemy resistance around Los Banos, Mt. Malepunyo and ultimately the Angels participated in Task Force Aparri, the last combat airborne operation of the war. In the fighting, the 11th Airborne earned 2 Medals of Honor, 9 Distinguished Service Crosses, 1 Distinguished Service Medal, 10 Legion of Merit medals, 326 Silver Stars, 1,126 Bronze Stars, 27 Air Medals and 884 Purple Hearts.\n\nThe decimated 511th PIR received an influx of reinforcements on Luzon before being given FOUR hours to pack and head to the airstrips for flights to Okinawa. There the Angels waited for Japan and Allied Leadership to finalize the empire's surrender so the paratroopers visited friends in other units (and their kitchens), stole Jeeps to ride around the island and otherwise enjoyed the overly-crowded island (it was a main staging area for the invasion of Japan). Then orders came down for the 11th Airborne to get ready for another move; they were to be the first full Allied unit to land on mainland Japan.\n\n\"This operation will remain in military history as a classic example of the use of airborne troops to achieve tactical surprise.\" -Lieutenant-General William P. Yarborough, 1989.\n\nNote: This timeline is an attempt to cover the major aspects of this historic operation by date/time. It will not cover every facet or key player of the raid in detail for to do so would require (and has) an entire book. If you would like to read the full story of this mission, you may do so in my book, “When Angels Fall: From Toccoa to Tokyo, the 511th Parachute Infantry Regiment in World War II”\n\nI would like to give a special thank-you to Col. Edward H. Lahti who was CO of the 511th Parachute Infantry Regiment at the time of the raid and whose papers I am in possession of.\n\nAn equally large thank-you is due to retired Brigadier-General Henry “Hank” Muller who was so integral to the raid’s success and in helping compile this timeline of the operation. He truly is “an officer and a gentleman”.\n\nFinally, I must thank my friend Robert Wheeler who was a young child when the Angels rescued his family from Los Baños. His insights into the raid have proven invaluable.\n\nTo any outlets, historians, re-enactors, etc. who use the information in this timeline, please list myself as author and credit www.511pir.com – Jeremy C. Holm​\n\nTo learn more about The Los Baños raid and this historic regiment and the intrepid men who fought in it, you can order Jeremy C. Holm's new book, WHEN ANGELS FALL: From Toccoa to Tokyo, The 511th Parachute Infantry Regiment in World War II by visiting our online store or purchasing a copy wherever books are sold."
