Turner began his career as Reservist and naval aviator during World War II and distinguished himself during Battles of Iwo Jima and Okinawa in early 1945. Following the War, Turner remained in the Navy and commanded aircraft carrier USS America during Vietnam War.[1]\n\nHe later rose to the Flag rank and commanded Carrier Division 2 and United States Sixth Fleet in the Mediterranean Sea during the period of unrests in Lebanon. Turner completed his career as Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for Air Warfare in July 1979.[2][3]\n\nEarly career and World War II\n\n[edit]\n\nFrederick C. Turner was born on June 13, 1923, in Boston, Massachusetts, the son of Charles J. and Margaret Turner. He graduated from the high school in summer 1941 and following the Japanese Attack on Pearl Harbor, he tried to enlist the United States Navy, but was rejected due to young age. His parents refused to sign enlistment papers for him and young Frederick had to wait for next six months. Finally in summer of the following year, his father approved it and Turner enlisted the United States Navy on July 28, 1942.[1][4][5][3]\n\nHe was assigned to the Naval Aviation Cadet Training Program and ordered to Naval Air Station Pensacola, Florida, for flight training.

He was decorated with second Legion of Merit for that service.[1][4][5]\n\nTurner was subsequently ordered to Washington, D.C., and appointed assistant chief of naval personnel for personnel control under Vice Admiral Dick H.
