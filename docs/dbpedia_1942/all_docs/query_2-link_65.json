        "text": "WHY SOME PEOPLE JUST DON'T REPLY ON LINKEDIN ?? Ever wondered what it is about a certain tribe of people on #linkedin who you will try and send messages to, perhaps once, twice, thrice, or even the fourth time and they will not respond to you. Given #technology advancement you will get notified soon as they have read your inbox message but remain silent. For one, we can give the benefit that people are busy, they may not immediately reply to you, but one can at least expect a reply say on the 3 message and even say after 3 weeks, Basic etiquette of #email that one should reply and it applies here too if you chosen to be on this #socialmedia platform that's meant for connecting, reaching out, learning, sharing, doing business and more. This tribe is called the \"Egotisticals\". They take pride in their positions even if they are just 29 year olds, and of course it's not about age, but purely personality. There are CEO'S of companies who despite being super busy will make the time, and then there are those who take sadistic pleasure but not replying. All of us face these specimens : My suggestion is ignore those people. It's sad that sometimes when these same people will want to connect back with you, it'll be too hard. RESPECT PEOPLE WHO REACH OUT TO YOU, LIFE COMES A CIRCLE!"
