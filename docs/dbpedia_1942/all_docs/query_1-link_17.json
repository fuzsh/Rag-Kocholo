Born in Cartersville on November 1, 1948 he was the son of the late J.D. Turner and the late Ruby Lee Butler Turner. He was also preceded in death by his sister, Patricia Ann Roland; and his brother, Thomas Randall Turner.\n\nCecil was of the Baptist faith. He served his country in the US Army 101st Airborne Division in Vietnam. Upon returning home he was known by most as having a �tough guy� reputation. While those close to him enjoyed his unique and hilarious sense of humor his family will remember him as a loyal son, brother and friend. In his latter years Cecil placed great value and pride in his work ethic and skill as an employee of various factories and carpet mills. He was known by the companies which employed him to be a dependable, hard worker who was an asset to their organizations.\n\nSurvivors include his son, Robert David Turner; his daughter and son-in-law, Michelle and Shane Daniel; his grandson, Nathan Cook, his granddaughter, Ariana Pritchard; his brothers, James Turner and Brady Turner; and several nieces, nephews, great nieces, and great nephews.\n\nGraveside services will be conducted at 11:00 a.m. on Thursday, July 5, 2012 at Sunset Memory Gardens with Greg Patterson officiating.\n\nPlease join in celebrating Cecil�s life by visiting www.jenningsfuneralhome.com to share memories and to post tributes."
