        "text": "Cecil I. Scholl, 103, of Iowa City, Iowa, and formerly of Anita, Iowa, died Wednesday, October 11, 2006, at Lantern Park Nursing and Rehab in Coralville, Iowa.\n\nCecil Irvin Scholl, the eighth child, was born on February 5, 1903, on the family farm near Anita, Iowa, the son of William and Rosa (Brockmann) Scholl.\n\nHe was married to Nancy June Robinson on April 2, 1923, and farmed three miles southeast of Anita until 1947, when they moved to Anita. They were the third generation to farm the land. The farm later became a Century Farm.\n\nIn 1975, a tragic accident happened to Cecil. He was helping his son, Marvin, pick corn, when Cecil somehow became entangled in the auger wagon, losing both of his legs to just below the knee. After the accident, he worked for several years at Long's Furniture and later for Clifford Fries. He was often seen walking up town, and managed to get around quite well.\n\nCecil enjoyed playing board games, pitch and euchre. His son Harvey said he is hard to beat! He also enjoyed his time farming, but did like his time living in town.\n\nCecil is survived by one son, Harvey Scholl of Iowa City, Iowa; three grandsons, Geoff Scholl and his wife, Denise of Iowa City, Iowa, Greg Scholl and his wife, Jeanne of Tampa Bay, Florida, and Robert Scholl and his wife, Becky of Elkhart, Iowa; 9 great-grandchildren; several great-great-grandchildren; a daughter-in-law, Norma Scholl Turner and her husband, Neil Turner of Atlantic, Iowa; and numerous nieces and nephews.\n\nHe is preceded in death by his wife, Nancy, in 1982; son, Marvin in 1985; his parents, William and Rosa Scholl; 5 brothers; 4 sisters; and a granddaughter, Nancy Hansen in 1986.\n\nFuneral services will be 10:30 a.m., Tuesday, October 17, 2006, at the United Methodist Church in Anita, Iowa with The Reverend Annette Kuhs-Kruse officiating. Masonic services will take place during the funeral service by the Anita Masonic Lodge, Obedience Lodge #380, A.F. & A.M.\n\nBurial will be in the Evergreen Cemetery in Anita, Iowa.\n\nVisitation will be from 12 to 7 p.m., Monday, October 16, 2006, with the family present from 5 to 7 p.m., at the Hockenberry Family Care Funeral Home in Anita.\n\nHockenberry Family Care Funeral Home in Anita, Iowa, is in charge of the arrangements."
