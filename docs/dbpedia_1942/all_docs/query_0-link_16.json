His mother died in 1925 during childbirth leaving his father to raise Floyd and his two brothers, Gene and Kimmins. Floyd accompanied his father to work when he was young. It was there he acquired the nickname of Sparkie because he enjoyed playing with old spark plugs.\n\nFloyd Turner joined the Army Air Corps on August 20, 1941 at Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio, TX. Over the next couple of years he was stationed in St. Louis, MO, San Angelo, TX, Harlingen, Tx, Boise, ID, Scottsbluff, NE, and Topeka, KS for training. He left Topeka on December 11, 1943 with his training finally completed to go overseas. He arrived in England on January 5, 1944 after traveling through Florida, Puerto Rico, Trinidad, Brazil, and Africa. Floyd had been trained as an aircraft mechanic and became a gunner in the Army Air Corps. He was a member of Crew #7 of the 93rd Bombardment Group, 328th Squadron, while in England. He completed 32 bombing missions and was awarded the Army Good Conduct Medal, two Distinguished Flying Cross medals, and the Army Air Corps Air Medal.\n\nFloyd Turner met Loeine Adelia Scott while he was stationed in Scottsbluff, Nebraska at the local Busy Bee cafe where she worked. Loeine was the girl he dreamed of and wrote to while he was stationed overseas. They married after his tour of duty in England on September 25, 1944. They lived in Biloxi, MS where he was stationed as a Technical (Flight Engineer) Instructor at Keesler Field. He was discharged from the Army Air Corps as a Staff Sergeant at Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio, TX on September 2, 1945, the day that World War II officially ended with the signing of the surrender documents aboard the USS Missouri by Japan.\n\nLoeine and Floyd Turner had one daughter and five sons. Floyd Turner died on November 15, 1999 in Garland, TX. Loeine Turner died on February 23, 2013.\n\nReturn to the Table of Contents\n\nBibliography\n\nSmith, Cynthia Sue Turner.
