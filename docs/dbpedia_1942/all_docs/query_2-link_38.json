        "text": "Albert Cecil Turner was born in Payneham, South Australia, in May 1892. He worked as a motor mechanic before the war. He had a sister named Alice Daisy Baker, who was his next of kin and a brother named Frederick Joseph Turner who became his next of kin as of March 1917.\n\nOn the 14th of January 1916 at age 23 Albert enlisted in Adelaide with no prior military service in his record. Frederick had enlisted the previous year and they both embarked on the 27th of June 1916 aboard the HMAT A57 Malakuta.\n\nAlbert was placed in the 2nd depot battalion as a private before being moved on the 21st of November 1916 to the 32nd Battalion, 7th reinforcement a few months after his brother.\n\nAlbert came out of the line to the right of Trones wood facing Bapaume on the 25th of November 1916 with dysentery and slight trench foot. He was only in the line for five days. He spent three in the support trench called Needle trench and two days in the front line. Albert was admitted to hospital on the 3rd of December 1916 before being transferred to England on 7th of January 1917 and admitted to hospital there on the 12th of January 1917. His condition did not significantly improve and Albert was returned to Australia via hospital transport or 'Miltiades' and reached Melbourne on 2nd of July 1917, he was discharged on the 19th of September 1917.\n\nAlbert and Frederick both returned home prior to the war's end due to being medically unfit. Frederick died at age 26 forty-two days after Albert's return to Australia and only months after his own. Albert lived until August 16th, 1982 at which time he would have been 90 years of age."
