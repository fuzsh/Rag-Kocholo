Sydney Pollack was an Academy Award-winning director, producer, actor, writer and public figure, who directed and produced over 40 films.

Sydney Irwin Pollack was born July 1, 1934 in Lafayette, Indiana, USA, to Rebecca (Miller), a homemaker, and David Pollack, a professional boxer turned pharmacist. All of his grandparents were Russian Jewish immigrants. His parents divorced when he was young. His mother, an alcoholic, died at age 37, when Sydney was 16. He spent his formative years in Indiana, graduating from his HS in 1952, then moved to New York City.

From 1952-1954 young Pollack studied acting with Sanford Meisner at The Neighborhood Playhouse School of the Theatre in New York. He served two years in the army, and then returned to the Neighborhood Playhouse and taught acting. In 1958, Pollack married his former student Claire Griswold. They had three children. Their son, Steven Pollack, died in a plane crash on November 26, 1993, in Santa Monica, California. Their daughter, Rebecca Pollack, served as vice president of film production at United Artists during the 1990s. Their youngest daughter, Rachel Pollack, was born in 1969.

Pollack began his acting career on stage, then made his name as television director in the early 1960s. He made his big screen acting debut in Hinter feindlichen Linien (1962), where he met fellow actor Robert Redford, and the two co-stars established a life-long friendship. Pollack called on his good friend Redford to play opposite Natalie Wood in Dieses Mädchen ist für alle (1966). Pollack and Redford worked together on six more films over the years. His biggest success came with Jenseits von Afrika (1985), starring Robert Redford and Meryl Streep. The movie earned eleven Academy Award nominations in all and seven wins, including Pollack's two Oscars: one for Best Direction and one for Best Picture.

Pollack showed his best as a comedy director and actor in Tootsie (1982), where he brought feminist issues to public awareness using his remarkable wit and wisdom, and created a highly entertaining film, which was nominated for ten Academy Awards. Pollack's directing revealed Dustin Hoffman's range and nuanced acting in gender switching from a dominant boyfriend to a nurse in drag, a brilliant collaboration of director and actor that broadened public perception about sex roles. Pollack also made success in producing such films as Der talentierte Mr. Ripley (1999), Der stille Amerikaner (2002) and Unterwegs nach Cold Mountain (2003). Pollack returned to the director's chair in 2004, when he directed Die Dolmetscherin (2005), the first film ever shot on location at the United Nations Headquarters and within the General Assembly in New York City.

In 2000, Sydney Pollack was honored with the John Huston Award from the Directors Guild of America as a "defender of artists' rights." He died from cancer on May 26, 2008, at his home in the Los Angeles suburb of Pacific Palisades, California.

Jessica Lange was born in 1949, in Cloquet, Minnesota, USA, where her father worked as a traveling salesman. She obtained a scholarship to study art at the University of Minnesota, but instead went to Paris to study drama. She moved to New York, working as a model, until producer Dino De Laurentiis cast her as the female lead in King Kong (1976). The film attracted much unfavorable comment and, as a result, Lange was off the screen for three years. She was given a small but showy part in Bob Fosse's Hinter dem Rampenlicht - All that jazz (1979), before giving a memorable performance in Bob Rafelson's Wenn der Postmann zweimal klingelt (1981), as an adulterous waitress. The following year, she won rave reviews for her exceptional portrayal of actress Frances Farmer in Frances (1982) and a Best Supporting Actress Academy Award for her work in Sydney Pollack's Tootsie (1982) (as a beautiful soap-opera actress). She was also outstanding as country singer Patsy Cline in Karel Reisz's Sweet Dreams (1985) and as a lawyer who defends her father and discovers his past in Music Box - Die ganze Wahrheit (1989). Other important films include Martin Scorsese's Kap der Angst (1991) (as a frightened housewife) and Tony Richardson's Operation Blue Sky (1994), for which she won a Best Actress Academy Award as the mentally unbalanced wife of a military officer. She made her Broadway debut in 1992, playing "Blanche" in Tennessee Williams "A Streetcar Named Desire".

Teri Garr can claim a career in show business by birthright. She was the daughter of Eddie Garr, a Broadway stage and film actor, and Phyllis Garr, a dancer. While she was still an infant, her family moved from Hollywood to New Jersey but, after the death of her father when she was 11, the family returned to Hollywood, where her mother became a wardrobe mistress for movies and television. While Garr's dancing can be seen in five Elvis Presley movies, her first speaking role in motion pictures was in the 1968 feature Head (1968), starring The Monkees. In the 1970s she became well established in television with appearances on shows such as Raumschiff Enterprise (1966), Ihr Auftritt, Al Mundy (1968) and Ein Sheriff in New York (1970), and became a semi-regular on The Sonny and Cher Show (1976) as Cher's friend, Olivia. Garr has since risen to become one of Hollywood's most versatile, energetic and well-recognized actresses. She has starred in many memorable films, including Frankenstein Junior (1974), Oh, Gott (1977), Die unheimliche Begegnung der 3. Art (1977), Mr. Mom (1983), Die Zeit nach Mitternacht (1985) and her Academy Award-nominated performance for Best Supporting Actress in Tootsie (1982). Other film roles include Der schwarze Hengst (1979), Einer mit Herz (1981), Der große Zauber (1982), Moving in - Eine fast intakte Familie (1984), Alles auf Sieg (1989), Die Trottel vom Texas-Grill (1988), Tau' mich auf, Liebling! (1989), Short Time - Nichts als Ärger mit dem Kamikaze-Cop! (1990), Zeichen und Wunder (1990), Mom und Dad retten die Welt (1992), Das perfekte Alibi (1995), Prêt-à-Porter (1994) and Der Zauberwunsch (1997).

Bill Murray is an American actor, comedian, and writer. The fifth of nine children, he was born William James Murray in Wilmette, Illinois, to Lucille (Collins), a mailroom clerk, and Edward Joseph Murray II, who sold lumber. He is of Irish descent. Among his siblings are actors Brian Doyle-Murray, Joel Murray, and John Murray. He and most of his siblings worked as caddies, which paid his tuition to Loyola Academy, a Jesuit school. He played sports and did some acting while in that school, but in his words, mostly "screwed off." He enrolled at Regis College in Denver to study pre-med but dropped out after being arrested for marijuana possession. He then joined the National Lampoon Radio Hour with fellow members Dan Aykroyd, Gilda Radner, and John Belushi. However, while those three became the original members of Saturday Night Live (1975), he joined Saturday Night Live with Howard Cosell (1975), which premiered that same year. After that show failed, he later got the opportunity to join Saturday Night Live (1975), for which he earned his first Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing in a Comedy-Variety or Music Series. He later went on to star in comedy films, including Babyspeck und Fleischklösschen (1979), Caddyshack - Wahnsinn ohne Handicap (1980), Ich glaub' mich knutscht ein Elch! (1981), Tootsie (1982), Ghostbusters - Die Geisterjäger (1984), Ghostbusters 2 (1989), Die Geister die ich rief... (1988), Was ist mit Bob? (1991), and Und täglich grüßt das Murmeltier (1993). He also co-directed Ein verrückt genialer Coup (1990). Murray garnered additional critical acclaim later in his career, starring in Lost in Translation: Zwischen den Welten (2003), which earned him a Golden Globe and a BAFTA Award for Best Actor, as well as an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor. He also received Golden Globe nominations for his roles in Ghostbusters, Rushmore (1998), Hyde Park am Hudson (2012), St. Vincent - Mein himmlischer Nachbar (2014), and the HBO miniseries Olive Kitteridge - Mit Blick aufs Meer (2014), for which he later won his second Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Limited Series or a Movie.

Robin McLaurin Williams was born on Saturday, July 21st, 1951, in Chicago, Illinois, a great-great-grandson of Mississippi Governor and Senator, Anselm J. McLaurin. His mother, Laurie McLaurin (née Janin), was a former model from Mississippi, and his father, Robert Fitzgerald Williams, was a Ford Motor Company executive from Indiana. Williams had English, German, French, Welsh, Irish, and Scottish ancestry.

Robin briefly studied political science at Claremont Men's College and theater at College of Marin before enrolling at The Juilliard School to focus on theater. After leaving Juilliard, he performed in nightclubs where he was discovered for the role of "Mork, from Ork", in an episode of Happy Days (1974). The episode, My Favorite Orkan (1978), led to his famous spin-off weekly TV series, Mork vom Ork (1978). He made his feature starring debut playing the title role in Popeye - Der Seemann mit dem harten Schlag (1980), directed by Robert Altman.

Williams' continuous comedies and wild comic talents involved a great deal of improvisation, following in the footsteps of his idol Jonathan Winters. Williams also proved to be an effective dramatic actor, receiving Academy Award nominations for Best Actor in a Leading Role in Good Morning, Vietnam (1987), Der Club der toten Dichter (1989), and König der Fischer (1991), before winning the Academy Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role in Good Will Hunting: Der gute Will Hunting (1997).

During the 1990s, Williams became a beloved hero to children the world over for his roles in a string of hit family-oriented films, including Hook (1991), FernGully - Christa und Zaks Abenteuer im Regenwald (1992), Aladdin (1992), Mrs. Doubtfire: Das stachelige Kindermädchen (1993), Jumanji (1995), Flubber (1997), and Der 200 Jahre Mann (1999). He continued entertaining children and families into the 21st century with his work in Robots (2005), Happy Feet (2006), Nachts im Museum (2006), Nachts im Museum 2 (2009), Happy Feet 2 (2011), and Nachts im Museum - Das geheimnisvolle Grabmal (2014). Other more adult-oriented films for which Williams received acclaim include Garp und wie er die Welt sah (1982), Moskau in New York (1984), Zeit des Erwachens (1990), The Birdcage - Ein Paradies für schrille Vögel (1996), Insomnia - Schlaflos (2002), One Hour Photo (2002), World's Greatest Dad (2009), and Boulevard: Ein neuer Weg (2014).

On Monday, August 11th, 2014, Robin Williams was found dead at his home in Tiburon, California USA, the victim of an apparent suicide, according to the Marin County Sheriff's Office. A 911 call was received at 11:55 a.m. PDT, firefighters and paramedics arrived at his home at 12:00 p.m. PDT, and he was pronounced dead at 12:02 p.m. PDT.

Born in 1938 in New York City and raised in New York City, Alabama and Islip, Long Island, Peter Beard began keeping diaries at an early age. He took his first pictures at the age of twelve and photography quickly evolved into an extension of his diaries, as a way to preserve and remember favorite things. In 1957 he entered Yale University as a pre-med undergraduate, but soon switched his major to art history, studying under Vincent Scully, Joseph Albers and Richard Linder.

Trips to Africa in 1955 and 1960 piqued his interests and, after graduating from Yale, he returned to Africa. In the early '60s he worked at Kenya's Tsavo National Park where he photographed and documented the demise of over 35,000 elephants, which later became the subject of his first book "The End of the Game" (1965). During the same period he acquired Hog Ranch, the property adjacent to Karen Blixen's (Isak Dinesen), whom he had met through his cousin Jerome Hill. Hog Ranch, located near the Ngong Hills, became his home base in East Africa. Beard has written further books on his African experience: "Eyelids of Morning" (1973), "Longing for Darkness" (1975) and "Zara's Tales: Perilous Escapades in Equatorial Africa" (2004), written for his daughter.

Beard's first exhibit was at the Blum Helman Gallery in New York in 1975. This was quickly followed by his landmark installation at the International Center of Photography in New York City in 1977. This show exhibited his photographs, elephant carcasses, burned diaries, taxidermy, African artifacts, books and personal memorabilia.

In addition to creating original artwork, Beard has befriended and collaborated on projects with many legendary artists including Andy Warhol, Andrew Wyeth, Richard Linder, Terry Southern, Truman Capote and Francis Bacon.

In 1996, shortly after he was trampled by an elephant, his first major retrospective opened at the Centre National de la Photographie in Paris, followed by other exhibits in Berlin, London, Toronoto, Madrid, Milan, Tokyo and Vienna.

Beard currently splits his time between New York City, Montauk Point and Kenya, living with his wife and agent Nejma and their daughter Zara.

For many decades, Coleman played sleazy or thuggish or twisted baddies, sometimes comedic, sometimes not. There were exceptions where he played good guys (That Girl, On Golden Pond, The Guardian) but something about the combination of his imposing height, heartless demeanor, beady eyes, permanently mustachioed (practically being twirled) but otherwise average looks, and fast-talking Texan shyster physiognomy copper-fastened the bad guy stereotype. In between the two extremes, good and bad, was the flawed but very human Slap Maxwell. (The Slap Maxwell Story had a briefer run than it deserved perhaps because for its time it hit too close to home, although tame by later standards.)

Dabney Wharton Coleman was born in Austin, Texas, to Mary Wharton (Johns) and Melvin Randolph Coleman. He attended the Virginia Military Institute, and studied law in Texas. Coleman had a well deserved reputation as a fine character actor, and a reliable presence for almost any role in TV and movies.

Coleman's early appearances in the cinema were in Stimme am Telefon (1965) and Schussfahrt (1969). On TV he starred in Süß, aber ein bißchen verrückt (1966). As the 1970s approached he became a well-known character actor in television and movies, appearing in Flammendes Inferno (1974), Schlacht um Midway (1976), and Zapfenstreich (1973). Television seemed Coleman's forum in the 1970s as he played the role of Merle Jeeter in Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman (1976) and Fernwood 2 Night (1977). Coleman made appearances in the popular Die Bullen von Dallas (1979) and the Oscar-winning Melvin und Howard (1980).

He first garnered a measure of fame for some satirical movies, starring in the comedy Zahltag im Supermarkt (1980) and snatched a lead role for the TV movie Pray TV (1980). Coleman's reputation for playing world-class jerks became cemented in 1980 as the boss to Dolly Parton , Jane Fonda and Lily Tomlin in Warum eigentlich... bringen wir den Chef nicht um? (1980). The next year, he was in very good company working with legends Henry Fonda and Katharine Hepburn in Am goldenen See (1981). His hit streak would not end there.

In 1982, Coleman landed a key role in the classic Tootsie (1982), further cementing his role as a very dislikable wealthy boss in some capacity. In 1983, he starred in the Cold War classic WarGames: Kriegsspiele (1983). During this period he also found many parts in lesser known movies like Küss mich, Doc (1982) and Das Schicksal kennt kein Erbarmen (1981). In 1984 he starred in Die Muppets erobern Manhattan (1984) and in 1985 he starred with Tom Hanks in Der Verrückte mit dem Geigenkasten (1985). In 1987, he won an Emmy for Cold Silence (1987). In 1990, he took two lead roles, one in the disastrous Die Zeit der bunten Vögel (1990), and the other in the quirky comedy Short Time - Nichts als Ärger mit dem Kamikaze-Cop! (1990).

In 1993, Coleman starred in the slapstick comedy Amos & Andrew - Zwei fast perfekte Chaoten (1993) and the big screen version of Die Beverly Hillbillies sind los (1993) as Milburn Drysdale. He appeared in an extensive line of TV movies. He took part in Disneys Große Pause (1997), and then starred in a couple of big money grossers, the Tom Hanks comedy, e-m@il für Dich (1998), as Chief Quimby in Inspektor Gadget (1999), and in Stuart Little (1999) (both in 1999).

Coleman died in 2024, aged 92, in Santa Monica, California.

WWII veteran, dance instructor and diversely talented stage & screen actor were all inclusions on the resume of this perpetually busy US actor who didn't get in front of the cameras until around the time of his fortieth birthday. The stockily built Charles Durning was one of Hollywood's most dependable and sought after supporting actors.

Durning was born in Highland Falls, New York, to Louise Marie (Leonard), a laundress, and James Gerald Durning. His father was an Irish immigrant and his mother was of Irish descent. Durning first got his start in guest appearances in early 1960's TV shows. He scored minor roles over the next decade until he really got noticed by film fans as the sneering, corrupt cop "Lt. Snyder" hassling street grifter 'Robert Redford' in the multi award winning mega-hit Der Clou (1973). Durning was equally entertaining in the Billy Wilder production of Extrablatt (1974), he supported screen tough guy Charles Bronson in the suspenseful western Nevada Pass (1975) and featured as "Spermwhale Whalen" in the story of unorthodox police behavior in Die Chorknaben (1977).

The versatile Durning is equally adept at comedic roles and demonstrated his skills as "Doc Hopper" in Muppet Movie (1979), a feisty football coach in Die Bullen von Dallas (1979), a highly strung police officer berating maverick cop Burt Reynolds in Sharky und seine Profis (1981), and a light footed, dancing Governor (alongside Burt Reynolds once more) in Das schönste Freudenhaus in Texas (1982). Durning continued a regular on screen association with Burt Reynolds appearing in several more feature films together and as "Dr. Harlan Elldridge" in the highly popular TV series Daddy schafft uns alle (1990). On par with his multitude of feature film roles, Durning has always been in high demand on television and has guest starred in Alle lieben Raymond (1996), Monk (2002) and Rescue Me (2004). Plus, he has appeared in the role of "Santa Claus" in five different television movies.

George Gaynes was born in Helsinki in May, 1917, which was then the capital of the Grand Duchy of Finland. The Grand Duchy was part of the Russian Empire, which was in a state of collapse at the time of Gaynes' birth. The Emperor Nicholas II of Russia had abdicated the throne on March 15, two months prior to Gaynes' birth, and the Empire was in the process of splintering.

His family left the country, and George was primarily raised in France, England, and Switzerland. Neither of his parents was Finnish. His father Gerrit Jongejans was a Dutch businessman, and his mother Iya Grigorievna de Gay was a Russian artist. George attended college in the vicinity of Lausanne, Switzerland and graduated in 1937. He then attended a music school in Milan, Italy for about a year.

In 1940, George Gaynes was living in France, during the time of the Battle of France in World War II. The Battle ended in defeat for the French Third Republic and the country was occupied by Nazi Germany. George attempted to flee the occupation authorities, by crossing the Pyrenees mountains into neutral Spain. He was arrested by the Spanish authorities for illegally crossing the border, but was soon released.

In 1943, George joined the Royal Netherlands Navy. With the Netherlands under German occupation, the headquarters of the Navy had moved to London, in the United Kingdom. George had no previous military experience, but he was noticed for multilingual skills. He fluently spoke Dutch, English, French, Italian and Russian. He was soon detached to the (British) Royal Navy to serve as a translator.

During his naval service in World War II, George took part in the Allied invasion of Sicily, the Battle of Anzio in the Italian Campaign, and the Adriatic Campaign. The War ended in 1945 and George was honorably discharged in July, 1946. His highest military rank was that of a sergeant.

In 1946, George briefly returned to living in France. He was approached by an American theater director with the offer to play a part in a musical. He took the offer and moved to New York City, where he started appearing in Broadway musicals. He applied for American citizenship and officially became a citizen in 1948.

From the late 1940s to the early 1960s, George Gaynes was primarily a theatrical actor. His roles included various musicals, dramas, and comedies. One of his better-known roles was that of Henry Higgins in the theatrical version of ''My Fair Lady'', which went on a successful tour in 1964.

In the early 1960s, George started appearing as a character actor in various television series. He was also offered a number of film roles. His career unexpectedly took off in the 1980s, with a major part in the television series Punky Brewster (1985) and another one in the then-popular film series "Police Academy" from 1984 to 1994. In Police Academy - Dümmer als die Polizei erlaubt (1984), his role was that of Commandant Eric Lassard, the titular leader of the Academy. He played the role in all 7 films of the series, though he only had a featured part in the fifth film. This was probably his most memorable role and gained him celebrity recognition for the first time.

In the 1990s, his career slowed down again, with only a few film appearances. He only played in a single film through the 2000s, Voll verheiratet (2003), and then retired. He was 86-years-old and could no longer play physically demanding roles. He spend 13 years in retirement before he died of natural causes in 2016.

As a child, Geena dreamed of being an actress. While in high school, she felt left out and had low self-esteem because, at 6 feet, she was the tallest girl in school. After high school graduation, Geena entered New England College in New Hampshire and then transferred the next year to Boston University, where she majored in drama. In 1977, she left BU and moved to New York to start her career. Her career consisted of sales clerk and waitress. She worked at Ann Taylor, where she eventually rose to Saturday window mannequin while trying to get a job with a modeling agency. Eventually signed by the Zoli Agency, she wound up as a model in the Victoria Secret's Catalogue. Ever vigilant, Sydney Pollack was looking for new talent in the catalog when he spotted Geena and cast her in Tootsie (1982). With good reviews, Geena moved to Los Angeles where she was cast as Wendy in the short-lived but critically acclaimed television series Buffalo Bill (1983) with Dabney Coleman. A starter marriage to restaurant manager Richard Emmolo dissolved around this time. Her next appearance on television was in her own series Sara (1985), which was also good, but soon canceled. Geena then returned to the big screen in the below-average Transylvania 6-5000 (1985) followed by the successful Chevy Chase movie Fletch - Der Troublemaker (1985). From there on, she was on a roll with second husband Jeff Goldblum in the horror remake Die Fliege (1986). More successful were Tim Burton's dark comedy Beetlejuice (1988) and Die Reisen des Mr. Leary (1988). For the last film, she was the surprise winner of the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress. More fun movies followed with the flying-saucer-in-the-pool Mein Liebhaber vom andern Stern (1988) and everyone-loves-a-clown Ein verrückt genialer Coup (1990) with Bill Murray. The very successful Thelma & Louise (1991), directed by Ridley Scott, again garnered nominations for the Academy Award and Golden Globe. Eine Klasse für sich (1992), with Tom Hanks and directed by Penny Marshall, was the turning point as her next film, Ein ganz normaler Held (1992), was only average. Then she married director Renny Harlin and they set up a production and development company called "The Forge". Their first film was Sprachlos (1994), which flopped at the box office. Undeterred, Renny decided to film the big-budget Die Piratenbraut (1995), starring Geena as pirate leader Morgan, which also flopped. Geena has since starred in the thriller Tödliche Weihnachten (1996) and played Eleanor Little in Stuart Little (1999) and Stuart Little 2 (2002). She's also returned to TV, headlining Geena Davis (2000) and Welcome Mrs. President (2005). Both shows were canceled after one season, but she won a Golden Globe for the latter. In 2008, after being missed from the big screen for some years, Geena ventured to Sydney, Australia, playing the foul-mouthed mother of Harry Cook and Harrison Gilbertson to shoot the dark comedy Accidents Happen (2009).
