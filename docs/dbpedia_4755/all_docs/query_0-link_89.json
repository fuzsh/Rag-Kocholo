        "text": "pollack\n\nPollack, also known as Pollock, is a type of marine fish in the cod family. It is commonly found in the northern parts of the North Atlantic Ocean and is a popular choice for commercial fishing due to its size and taste. Pollack is also used as a cheaper substitute for cod and haddock in some recipes and food products. It is known for its white, firm flesh and mild flavor.\n\nPollack\n\nPollachius pollachius is a species of marine fish in the Pollachius genus. FAO uses English name pollack for this species. Together with Pollachius virens, it may also be referred to as pollock. Other names include European pollock, lieu jaune, and lythe. It is common in the north-eastern parts of the Northern Atlantic, including the Bay of Biscay and North Sea. Adults can grow up to 130 centimetres and weigh up to 18.1 kilograms, although more commonly their maximum length is 75 centimetres.\n\nPOLLACK\n\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, Pollack is ranked #3959 in terms of the most common surnames in America.\n\nThe Pollack surname appeared 8,977 times in the 2010 census and if you were to sample 100,000 people in the United States, approximately 3 would have the surname Pollack.\n\n93% or 8,350 total occurrences were White.\n\n3.1% or 285 total occurrences were of Hispanic origin.\n\n1.8% or 166 total occurrences were Black.\n\n1% or 92 total occurrences were of two or more races.\n\n0.8% or 72 total occurrences were Asian.\n\n0.1% or 12 total occurrences were American Indian or Alaskan Native.\n\nCardale Jones:\n\nThis is for the love of football, enjoy. Jones D.C. Defenders beat the Seattle Dragons 31-19 Saturday afternoon in the opener of the new XFL that provided plenty of entertainment in person and on TV. Its far too early to tell if the XFL can take a foothold where its previous incarnation and the recently unsuccessful Alliance of American Football failed, but executives are willing to wait and see. XFL COMMISH SAYS LEAGUE NEVER REALLY CONSIDERED COLIN KAEPERNICK, MORE EXCITED TO SEE CARDALE JONES For us, if the fans who attend and watch at home feel as though it was a good football game and they had a fun time either watching or being in this awesome venue with us, thats success, XFL chief operating officer Jeffrey Pollack said. Were taking a long term view in this. Success ultimately will not be measured in the first game or the first weekend or the first season."
