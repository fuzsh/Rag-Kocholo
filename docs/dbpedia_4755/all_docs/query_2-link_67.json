        "text": "There is nothing special about Roger Vadim's film Circle of Love (1964), based on Arthur Schnitzler's La Ronde (\"The Circle\"). It is \"an issue of La Vie Parisienne reviewed and corrected by a Playboy model,\" critic Jean de Baroncelli wrote in Le Monde. Jane Fonda appears naked in it, a first for an American actress in a foreign film. It was a scandal in the land of puritanism, especially when the image of her lying on a sheet was displayed in New York City's Times Square. Vadim pretended to be dismayed and Fonda filed a complaint. Her behind was covered with a white square in perfect bad taste.\n\nJane Fonda was in love. She married Roger Vadim Plemiannikov on August 14, 1965, at The Dunes casino in Las Vegas. The decision was made in just 24 hours: Fonda, for the sake of her father, preferred to formalize their relationship. The couple got remarried for French civil status on May 18, 1967, at the town hall of Saint-Ouen-Marchefroy (northern France), 50 kilometers from Paris. In 1964, the actress bought an old farm in the village. To the amazement of the hamlet, she had mature trees planted there: to get them there, the telephone pylons had to be taken down. \"They cost less than evening gowns. And they last a lifetime,\" she told Time magazine. Fonda repopulated the farm with eight dogs, 10 cats, chickens and a pony. She invited Americans visiting France for dinner. She renovated, made lists and organized the kitchen and staff. \"She does everything very seriously,\" Vadim said. \"To the letter.\"\n\nThe ex-husband of Brigitte Bardot and the father of Catherine Deneuve's son convinced Fonda that the salvation of marriage was in ecumenism. \"Vadim is not a man who has to prove himself with women, she told Time in 1966 in an interview at the Tahiti hotel, in Saint-Tropez (Var). He's known beautiful women; he was married to beautiful women. I would feel insecure with a man who had to prove himself, who was restless, who had things he hadn't done. If I hadn't met Vadim, I can't imagine that I would have married. It's so difficult for two human beings to share a life. Vadim puts it very well. He says you have a mistress, and maybe twice a year you'll bring her flowers and she'll be ravished with joy. You forget your wife's birthday and it's a drama. People change after marriage. They become very bourgeois. They're dead.\"\n\nVadim liked threesomes, sometimes with even more people. Fonda consented to the romps, convinced that she was not enough for her husband, this master of transgression. \"I never dared to tell him that I wanted him to be monogamous because I was afraid of being thought bourgeois. I thought that maybe if I were a participant, it wouldn't go on behind my back\" she wrote in her autobiography My Life So Far (2005). Sometimes, she even played the facilitator for the evening. In the morning, she chatted with the girls, who came from high-end houses like Madame Claude. \"It's not like he forced me to do it. Had I refused, he would have accepted that,\" she wrote. \"It was one symptom of my disembodiment, my loss of voice.\" Vadim understood the predicament of women who hated their bodies. He knew the ocean of insecurity in which Fonda had drowned."
