        "text": "Dario Argento was born on September 7, 1940, in Rome, Italy, the first-born son of famed Italian producer Salvatore Argento and Brazilian fashion model Elda Luxardo. Argento recalls getting his ideas for filmmaking from his close-knit family from Italian folk tales told by his parents and other family members, including an aunt who told him frighting bedtime stories. Argento based most of his thriller movies on childhood trauma, yet his own--according to him--was a normal one. Along with tales spun by his aunt, Argento was impressed by stories from The Grimm Brothers, Hans Christian Andersen and Edgar Allan Poe. Argento started his career writing for various film journal magazines while still in his teens attending a Catholic high school. After graduation, instead of going to college, Argento took a job as a columnist for the Rome daily newspaper \"Paese Sera\". Inspired by the movies, he later found work as a screenwriter and wrote several screenplays for a number of films, but the most important were his western collaborations, which included Friedhof ohne Kreuze (1969) and the Sergio Leone masterpiece Spiel mir das Lied vom Tod (1968). After its release Argento wrote and directed his first movie, Das Geheimnis der schwarzen Handschuhe (1970), which starred Tony Musante and and British actress Suzy Kendall. It's a loose adoption on Fredric Brown's novel \"The Screaming Mimi\", which was made for his father's film company. Argento wanted to direct the movie himself because he did not want any other director messing up the production and his screenplay.\n\nAfter \"The Bird With the Crystal Plumage\" became an international hit, Argento followed up with two more thrillers, Die neunschwänzige Katze (1971), starring 'Karl Madlen' (qv\" and 'James Fransiscus', and Vier Fliegen auf grauem Samt (1971) (\"Four Flies On Black Velvet\"), both backed by his father Salvatore. Argento then directed the TV drama Testimone oculare (1973) and the historical TV drama Die Halunken (1973). He then went back to directing so-called \"giallo\" thrillers, starting with Rosso - Die Farbe des Todes (1975), a violent mystery-thriller starring David Hemmings that inspired a number of international directors in the thriller-horror genre. His next work was Suspiria: In den Krallen des Bösen (1977), a surreal horror film about a witch's coven that was inspired by the Gothic fairy tales of the Grimm Brothers and Hans Christian Anderson, which he also wrote in collaboration with his girlfriend, screenwriter/actress Daria Nicolodi, who acted in \"Profondo Rosso\" (\"Deep Red\") and most of Argento's films from then to the late 1980s. Argento advanced the unfinished trilogy with Feuertanz - Horror Infernal (1980), before returning to the \"giallo\" genre with the gory Tenebrae (1982), and then with the haunting Phenomena (1985).\n\nThe lukewarm reviews for his films, however, caused Argento to slip away from directing to producing and co-writing two Lamberto Bava horror flicks, Dämonen 2 (1985) and Dämonen (1986). Argento returned to directing with the \"giallo\" thriller Terror in der Oper (1987), which according to him was \"a very unpleasant experience\", and no wonder: a rash of technical problems delayed production, the lead actress Vanessa Redgrave dropped out before filming was to begin, Argento's father Salvatore died during filming and his long-term girlfriend Daria broke off their relationship. After the commercial box-office failure of \"Opera\", Argento temporarily settled in the US, where he collaborated with director George A. Romero on the two-part horror-thriller Two Evil Eyes (1990) (he had previously collaborated with Romero on the horror action thriller Zombie (1978)). While still living in America, Argento appeared in small roles in several films and directed another violent mystery thriller, Aura (1993), which starred his youngest daughter Asia Argento from his long-term relationship with Nicolodi.\n\nArgento returned to Italy in 1995, where he made a comeback in the horror genre with Das Stendhal Syndrom (1996) and then with another version of \"The Phantom of the Opera\", Das Phantom der Oper (1998), both of which starred Asia. Most recently, Argento directed a number of \"giallo\" mystery thrillers such as Sleepless (2001), Il cartaio (2003) and Ti piace Hitchcock? (2005), as well as two gory, supernatural-themed episodes of the USA TV cable anthology series Masters of Horror (2005).\n\nHaving always wanted to make a third chapter to his \"Three Mothers\" horror films, Argento finally completed the trilogy in 2007 with the release of La terza madre (2007), which starred Asia Argento as a young woman trying to identify and stop the last surviving evil witch from taking over the world. In addition to his Gothic and violent style of storytelling, \"La terza madre\" has many references to two of his previous films, \"Suspiria\" (1997) and \"Inferno\" (1980), which is a must for fans of the trilogy.\n\nHis movies may be regarded by some critics and opponents as cheap and overly violent, but second or third viewings show him to be a talented writer/director with a penchant for original ideas and creative directing.\n\nElaine May (born under the name Elaine Iva Berlin) is an American actress, comedian, film director, playwright, and screenwriter from Philadelphia. Her professional career started in the 1950s and is still ongoing. She has twice been nominated for the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay. She is best remembered for directing the Cold War-themed action comedy \"Ishtar\" (1987). She won the Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Director, but the film has had a vocal minority of critics who defend its quality.\n\nIn 1932, May was born to a Jewish-American family. Both her parents were theatrical actors. Her father Jack Berlin was also a theater director and led his own traveling Yiddish theater company. Her mother was actress Ida Aaron. May made her stage debut c. 1935, at the age of 3. Her father had decided to include her in his performances. As a a child actress, she was reportedly cast in the roles of boys.\n\nThe theater company toured extensively, and May was part of their tours. She kept changing schools, enrolling for a few weeks and then moving to another city. May reputedly hated school, but loved reading books on her own. Her favorite topics were fairy tales and mythology.\n\nJack Berlin died c. 1942, and May's career as a child actress consequently ended. She was left in the custody of her mother. The duo settled in Los Angeles, and May eventually enrolled in Hollywood High School. In 1946, May dropped out of school. In 1948, she married her her first husband, the toy inventor Marvin May. She was only 16-years-old at the time of her marriage. She would later keep her husband's surname as her professional name.\n\nIn 1949, May had her only child, Jeannie Brette May. Jeannie would later become a professional actress in her own right, under the name Jeannie Berlin. May and her husband separated c. 1950, and she received a divorce in 1960. She started supporting herself through a series of odd jobs.\n\nIn 1950, May was interested in attending college, but most colleges in California required applicants to have high school diplomas. As a high school dropout, she did not have the necessary diploma. Learning that the University of Chicago did not use this requirement, she hitch-hiked her way to Chicago, At the time her personal fortune consisted of 7 dollars.\n\nOnce she arrived in Chicago, May started informally taking classes at the university by auditing, sitting in without enrolling. She habitually engaged in discussions with her instructors. She once had a fight with a philosophy instructor because of their different interpretations of the motives behind Socrates' apology. May was introduced to aspiring actor Mike Nichols (1931-2014),who was also attending the University. They bonded over their shared passion for the theater.\n\nIn 1955, May became one of the charter members of the Compass Players, a Chicago-based improvisational theater group. Nichols joined the group shortly after. The two of them formed a working partnership, jointly developing improvised comedy sketches. May helped the Compass Players to become a highly popular comedy troupe, due to her talent for satire. She helped in the training of novice members of the group.\n\nIn 1957, Nichols was asked to leave the Compass Players. His popularity had outshone most members of the group, and had caused internal conflicts. May left the group with him. They then decided to form their own stand-up comedy team, \"Nichols and May\". Their improvisational skills, and ability to come up with fresh material allowed them to impress their audience.\n\nIn 1960, the comedy duo made their Broadway debut, with the show \"An Evening with Mike Nichols and Elaine May\". A recording of the show won the 1962 \"Grammy Award for Best Comedy Album\". \"Nichols and May\" became very popular in New York City, performing in sold-out shows. They also started making appearances in radio and television, and even recorded commercials.\n\nMay was reportedly surprised with her own success. She had spend much of her adult life in near-poverty, but she was now earning a regular income from show business. She joked in an interview that she was practically barefoot when she arrived in New York, and now had to get used to wearing high heels.\n\nIn 1961, the duo was at the height of their fame. But they decided to dissolve their partnership in order to pursue solo careers. Nichols started working as a Broadway stage director, while May started her new career as a playwright. Her most successful play was \"Adaptation\" (1969), which she also directed. For her work as a theatrical director, she won the 1969 \"Outer Critics Circle Award, Best Director\".\n\nMay made her debut as a film director with the black comedy \"A New Leaf\" (1971). It was an adaptation of a short story by Jack Ritchie (1922-1983), depicting the story of an impoverished patrician who marries a wealthy heiress for her money. The main character initially considers murdering his wife to inherit her wealth, but first he has to protect her from other predators who were after her money.\n\nHer first film found little success at the box office, but was praised by critics and was nominated for the \"Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy\". It later earned a reputation as a cult classic, and in 2019 it was selected for preservation by the National Film Registry.\n\nHer second film was the romantic comedy \"The Heartbreak Kid\" (1972). It concerns a newlywed man who falls madly in love with a younger woman while on his honeymoon. He pursues his romantic interest obsessively despite all signs that his love is unrequited, and despite the disapproval of the woman's protective father. The film was critically acclaimed, and has at times been listed in retrospectives concerning the funniest American films.\n\nIn an unusual career move, her third film was not a comedy. It was the rather bleak gangster film \"Mikey and Nicky\" (1976). It depicts a small-time mobster whose life is in danger, resorting to asking for help from his childhood friend. While creating this film, May got involved in a legal dispute with the film studio Paramount Pictures. The studio eventually decided to only allow a limited release for the film. The film found a niche audience in the home video market, but May's career as a director suffered from this dispute. She was effectively blacklisted.\n\nMay decided to focus on her screenwriting career. She found success with the script to the fantasy-comedy \"Heaven Can Wait\" (1978), about the afterlife of a man who died prematurely. The film was based on a 1938 play by Harry Segall (1892-1975), and also served as a remake to the classic film \"Here Comes Mr. Jordan\" (1941) which was based on the same play. The film earned about 99 million dollars at the worldwide box office, and was a critical hit. May was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay, but the award was instead won by rival screenwriter Oliver Stone (1946-).\n\nDuring the early 1980s, May mainly worked as an uncredited script doctor. She \"polished\" scripts by other screenwriters. Her greatest success in this role was the romantic comedy \"Tootsie\" (1982), for which she wrote several additional scenes. She attempted her comeback as a director with the action comedy \"Ishtar\" (1987), which became a box office flop for the film studio Columbia Pictures. The film's failure reportedly convinced Columbia's parent company Coca-Cola to sell the under-performing studio to Sony.\n\n\"Ishtar\" was derided at the time as the worst film of its era by many critics, but was also defended by a vocal minority of critics. It has since attracted a cult audience, who consider this to be a great film. However the film's failure ended May's career as a film director and damaged her reputation. She also ceased working as a screenwriter for several years, reduced to working as an actress again.\n\nMay made her comeback as a screenwriter with the comedy film \"The Birdcage\" (1996), a remake of the European comedy \"La Cage aux Folles\" (The Cage of Madwomen, 1978). In the film, the openly gay parents to a young man have to pretend to be straight in an attempt to impress their son's prospective in-laws. The film earned about 185 million dollars at the worldwide box office, the greatest hit in May's career up to that point. She was nominated for the \"Writers Guild of America Award for Best Adapted Screenplay\", but the award was instead won by rival screenwriter Billy Bob Thornton (1955-).\n\nMay found more critical success with her next screenplay, for the political film \"Primary Colors\" (1998). It was an adaptation of the roman à clef novel \"Primary Colors: A Novel of Politics\" (1996) by Joe Klein (1946-). The novel itself was a fictionalized version of Bill Clinton's 1992 presidential campaign, and depicts an idealistic campaign worker's disillusionment with the politician. The film's cast were nominated for several awards. May herself received her second nomination for the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay, but the award was instead won by rival screenwriter Bill Condon (1955-).\n\nMay largely retired from screenwriting since the end of the 1990s. As an actress, she had a supporting role in the crime-comedy \"Small Time Crooks\" (2000). The film concerned nouveau riche criminals, who attempt to socialize with the American upper class. For this role, she won the \"Best Supporting Actress Award\" at the National Society of Film Critics Awards.\n\nMay lived in retirement until joining the cast of the television mini-series \"Crisis in Six Scenes\" (2016), her first television role in several decades. The series was created by Woody Allen (1935-), who happened to be an old friend of May.\n\nIn 2018, May made a theatrical comeback in Broadway. She played the elderly gallery owner Gladys Green in a revival of the play \"The Waverly Gallery\" (2000) by Kenneth Lonergan (1962-). In the play, Gladys shows early signs of Alzheimer's disease, and her family has to deal with her mental decline. May received critical acclaim for this role. For this role, she won the 2019 Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play. At age 87, she was the second-oldest winner of a Tony Award for acting.\n\nAs of 2021, May is 89-years-old. She is no longer very active, but she reportedly has plans to direct another film. She remains a popular actress.\n\nThe master filmmaker Roberto Rossellini, as one of the creators of neo-realism, is one of the most influential directors of all time. His neo-realist films influenced France's nouvelle vague movement in the 1950s and '60s that changed the face of international cinema. He also influenced American directors, including Martin Scorsese.\n\nHe was born into the world of film, making his debut in Rome on May 8, 1906, the son of Elettra (Bellan), a housewife, and Angiolo Giuseppe \"Beppino\" Rossellini, the man who opened Italy's first cinema. He was immersed in cinema from the beginning, growing up watching movies in his father's movie-house from the time that film was first quickening as an art form. Italy was one of the places were movie-making matured, and Italian film had a huge influence on D.W. Griffith and other international directors. Between the two world wars, Hollywood would soon dictate what constituted a \"well-made\" film, but Rossellini would be one of the Italian directors who once again put Italy at the forefront of international cinema after the Second World War.\n\nHis training in cinema was thorough and extensive and he became expert in many facets of film-making. (His brother Renzo Rossellini, also was involved in the industry, scoring films.) He did his apprenticeship as an assistant to Italian filmmakers, then got the chance to make his first film, a documentary, \"Prélude à l'après-midi d'un faune\", in 1937. Due to his close ties to Benito Mussolini's second son, the critic and film producer Vittorio Mussolini, he flourished in fascist Italy's cinema. Once Il Duce was deposed, Rossellini produced his first classic film, the anti-fascist Rom, offene Stadt (1945) (\"Rome, Open City\") in 1945, which won the Grand Prize at Cannes. Two other neo-realist classics soon followed, Paisà (1946) (\"Paisan\") and Deutschland im Jahre Null (1948) (\"Germany in the Year Zero\"). \"Rome, Open City\" screenwriters Sergio Amidei and Federico Fellini were nominated for a Best Writing, Screenplay Oscar in 1947, while Rossellini himself, along with Amidei, Fellini and two others were nominated for a screen-writing Oscar in 1950 for \"Paisan\".\n\n\"I do not want to make beautiful films, I want to make useful films,\" he said. Rossellini claimed, \"I try to capture reality, nothing else.\" This led him to often cast non-professional actors, then tailor his scripts to their idiosyncrasies and life-stories to heighten the sense of realism.\n\nWith other practitioners of neo-realism, Vittorio De Sica and Luchino Visconti, film was changed forever. American director Elia Kazan credits neo-realism with his own evolution as a filmmaker, away from Hollywood's idea of the well-made film to the gritty realism of Die Faust im Nacken (1954).\n\nRossellini had a celebrated, adulterous affair with Ingrid Bergman that was an international scandal. They became lovers on the set of Stromboli (1950) while both were married to other people and Bergman became pregnant. After they shed their spouses and married, producing three children, history repeated itself when Rossellini cheated on her with the Indian screenwriter Sonali Senroy DasGupta while he was in India at the request of Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru to help revitalize that country's film industry. It touched off another international scandal, and Nehru ousted him from the country. Rossellini later divorced Bergman to marry Das Gupta, legitimizing their child that had been born out-of-wedlock.\n\nRossellini continued to make films until nearly his death. His last film Der Messias (1975) (\"The Messiah\"), a story of The Passion of Christ, was released in 1975.\n\nRoberto Rossellini died of a heart attack in Rome on June 3, 1977. He was 71 years old.\n\nA true master of his craft, Michael Haneke is one of the greatest film artists working today and one who challenges his viewers each year and work goes by, with films that reflect real portions of life in realistic, disturbing and unforgettable ways. One of the most genuine filmmakers of the world cinema, Haneke wrote and directed films in several languages: French, German and English, working with a great variety of actors, such as Juliette Binoche, Isabelle Huppert, Jean-Louis Trintignant, Toby Jones, Ülrich Muhe, Arno Frisch and the list goes on.\n\nThis grand figure from Austrian cinema was born in Germany on 23 March 1942, from a German father and an Austrian mother, with both parents being from the artistic world working as actors, a career that Michael also tried but without much success. At the University of Vienna he studied drama, philosophy and psychology, and after graduation he went on to become a film critic and TV editor. His career behind camera started with ...und was kommt danach? (1974), which he wrote and directed. He went on to direct five more TV films and two episodes from the miniseries \"Lemminge\" (1979)_.\n\nThe years spent on television works prompted him to finally direct his first cinema feature, during his early 40's, which is somewhat unusual for film directors. But it was worth waiting. In Der siebente Kontinent (1989), Haneke establishes the foundation of what his future cinema would be about: a cinema that doesn't provides answers but one that dares to throw more and more questions, a cinema that reflects and analyses the human condition in its darkest and unexpected ways outside of any Hollywood formula. Films that exist to confront audiences and not comfort them. In it, Haneke deals with the duality of social values vs. internal values while exposing an apparent perfect family that runs into physical and material disintegration for reasons unknown. It was the first time a film of his was sent to the Cannes Film Festival (out of competition lineup) but he managed to cause some commotion in the audience with polemic scenes that were meant to extract all possible reactions from the crowd.\n\nHis next ventures at the decade's turn was in dealing with disturbed youth and the alienation they have in separating reality from fiction, trying to intersect both to drastic results. In Benny's Video (1992), it's the disturbing story of a teen boy who experiences killing for the first time capturing the murder on tape, impressed by the power of detachment that films and videos can cause to people; and later on the highly controversial Funny Games (1997), where two teens hold a family hostage to play sadistic games just for their own sick amusement. The film cemented Haneke's name as one of the greatest authors of his generation but sparkled a great debate with its themes of violence, sadism and the influence those things have in audiences. At the 1997's Cannes Film Festival, it was the film that had the most walk-out's by the audience. In between both films, he released 71 Fragmente einer Chronologie des Zufalls (1994) and Kafka's Das Schloß (1997), the latter being one of the rare times when Haneke developed an adapted work.\n\nIn the 2000's, he strongly continued in producing more outstanding works prone to debate and reflection in what would become his most prolific decade with the following films: Code - Unbekannt (2000), Die Klavierspielerin (2001), Wolfzeit (2003), Caché (2005), an American remake shot-by shot of Funny Games U.S. (2007) and Das weiße Band - Eine deutsche Kindergeschichte (2009). His study about romance versus masochism in Die Klavierspielerin (2001) was an intense work, with powerful performances by Isabelle Huppert and Benoit Magimel, that the Cannes jury in the year were so impressed that Haneke managed to actually reverse their award rules where it was decided that film entries at the festival couldn't win more than one main award (the two lead actors won awards and Haneke got the Grand Prize of the Jury, just lost the Palme d'Or). With Das weiße Band - Eine deutsche Kindergeschichte (2009), an enigmatic black-and-white masterpiece following the inception of Nazism in this pre WWI and WWII story focusing on repressed children living in this small village where strange events happen all the time and without any possible reasoning, Haneke conquered the world and audiences with an artistic and daring work that won his first Palme d'Or a Golden Globe as Best Foreign Language Film and received an Oscar nomination for the same category plus the cinematography work of Christian Berger.\n\n2012 was the year that marked his supremacy in the film world with the release of the bold and beautiful Liebe (2012), a love story with powerful real drama and one where Haneke removed most of his usual dark characteristics to present more quiet and calm elements without losing input in creating controversy. The touching story of George and Anne provided one the greatest moments of that year and earned Haneke his second and consecutive Palme d'Or at Cannes and his first Oscar nominations for Best Direction and Best Original Screenplay - and it was one of the several nominees for Best Picture Oscar, winning as Best Foreign Language Film.\n\nAfter abandoning a flash-mob film project, he returned to the screen with Happy End (2017), a film dealing with the refugee crisis in Europe and again he debuted his film at Cannes, receiving mildly positive reviews.\n\nBesides his film work, Haneke also directs theatre productions, from drama to opera, from Così fan tutte to Don Giovanni."
