        "text": "To the Anglo-Saxon ear, Schneider and Portnoy sound like typical Jewish names, while Taylor is the quintessence of Englishness. In fact, all three simply mean tailor, in German, Russian and English respectively. So what makes a family name Jewish?\n\nUntil the 19th Century most Ashkenazi Jews had no family names. Instead, they were named after their parents; Ya’akov ben Yitzhak, Jacob son of Isaac, or Sarah bat Rachel, Sarah daughter of Rachel.\n\nSpanish Jews, in contrast, have used family names since medieval times. Many derive from the names of flowers. In the Islamic world, Jewish names often denote places of origin, like Al-Fassi (from Fez in Morocco), Isfahani (from Isfahan in Persia), and Yerushalmi (from Jerusalem).\n\nSephardi and Ashkenazi names may sound different, but often mean the same thing. Montefiore, for instance, is identical in meaning to Bloomberg, ‘Mountain of Flowers’ in Italian and German respectively. Certain surnames can be both Ashkenazic and Sephardic. Often these denote membership of a religious group, Cohen, Levi or Israel. Family names based on Biblical names (Moses, David, Jacob etc) are shared by all communities.\n\nSome family names are actually acronyms; for example, Katz is a contraction of Kohen Tzadik,’ righteous priest’. Most Ashkenazi family names are German or Yiddish in origin; but a few are based on Hebrew: Schochet denotes a butcher; or Joffe, from Yafe, means beautiful.\n\nFamily names can reveal interesting ethnic origins. An Ashkenazi called Franks probably has a Sephardi ancestor (Frank was a nickname for Sephardim). Likewise, a Sephardi called Tedesco most likely has Ashkenazi forebears (Tedesco means German). By that logic, a Jew called Ashkenazi or Eskenazi is more likely to be Sephardi.\n\nIn 1787 Austria compelled Jews to adopt German-sounding family names. Some Jews apparently paid for attractive examples derived from flowers and gems (like Edelstein, ‘precious stone’; Bernstein, ‘amber’; and Rosenthal, ‘valley of roses’). Less fortunate people received more ordinary names (Klein, small; Schwartz, black); or even undesirable names like Taschengregger (pickpocket) or Ochsenschwantz (ox tail).\n\nIn 20th century Britain, and to a lesser extent in South Africa, USA, Canada and Australia, Jewish-sounding names were often anglicised. However, this was not only because Jews wanted to assimilate. Sometimes this was part of a wider trend towards anglicising names, for example, duirng World War I in 1917, popular dislike for Germany even transformed the name of the Royal Family of Great Britain from Saxe-Coburg-Gotha to Windsor and royal cousins residing in Great Britain were ordered by the King to also anglicise their names (hence, for example, Prince Louis of Battenberg adopted the family name Mountbatten which is an anglicised version of Battenberg). During World War II, Jewish servicemen adopted English-sounding names to avoid certain death if captured by German Nazis e.g. Cohen might be changed to Cahill.\n\nFeeling that German, Arabic and Spanish family names smelt of the ghetto, many Israelis chose authentic Hebrew ones instead. Eliezer Ben-Yehuda himself was born Perelman. New names often sounded like the old ones. David Ben-Gurion was formerly Gruen, Levi Eshkol was Shkolnik and Shimon Peres was Perski. Others chose names that meant the same: for example, Novik (‘new’) became Hadash.\n\nA combination of Jewish law, inheritance of one’s father’s family name and intermarriage means that today having a Jewish family name is no guarantee of being Jewish. Thus, for example, William Cohen, Barry Goldwater and Caspar Weinberger have ‘Jewish sounding’ surnames, but this only denotes a Jewish ancestor on their paternal side and not that they themselves are Jewish.\n\nHow many American Jews got their names\n\nOther than aristocrats and wealthy people, Jews did not get surnames in Eastern Europe until the Napoleon years of the early 19th century. Most of the Jews from countries captured by Napoleon, Russia, Poland, and Germany were ordered to get surnames for tax purposes.\n\nAfter Napoleon’s defeat, many Jews dropped these names and returned to “son of” names such as: MENDELSOHN, JACOBSON, LEVINSON, etc.\n\nDuring the so called Emancipation, Jews were once more ordered to take surnames. In Austria Emperor Joseph made Jews take last names in the late 1700s, Poland did so in 1821 and Russia in 1844. It’s probable that some of our families have had last names for 175 years or less.\n\nIn France and the Anglo-Saxon countries surnames went back to the 16th century. Also Sephardic Jews had surnames stretching back centuries.\n\nSpain prior to Ferdinand and Isabella was a golden spot for Jews. They were expelled by Isabella in the same year (1492) that Columbus left for America. Accordingly, the earliest American Jews were Sephardic.\n\nIn general, Jewish surnames fell into one of five categories:\n\nIn general there were five types of names (people had to pay for their choice of names; those too poor to pay had names assigned):\n\nNames which described the head of the household:\n\nHOCH (tall)\n\nKLEIN (small)\n\nCOHEN (priest)\n\nBURGER (city or village dweller, as opposed to a farmer or rural resident)\n\nSHEIN (good looking)\n\nLEVI (temple singer)\n\nGROSS (large or tall)\n\nSCHWARTZ (dark or black)\n\nWEISS (white)\n\nKURTZ (short)\n\nNames describing occupations:\n\nHOLTZ (wood) (used for someone whose occupation involved wood)\n\nHOLTZHACKER (wood chopper)\n\nGOLDSCHMIDT (goldsmith)\n\nSCHNEIDER (tailor)\n\nMETZGER (butcher)\n\nKRIEGSMAN (warrior)\n\nMALAMED (teacher)\n\nFINKELSTEIN (diamond)(used for a diamond merchant)\n\nEISEN (iron)(used for someone who was an ironworker)\n\nWEIN (wine)(used for someone who made or sold wine) (variant – WEINER, a person who works with wine)\n\nFISCHER (fisherman)\n\nNames based on place of residence:\n\nBERLINER – from Berlin\n\nFRANKFURTER – from Frankfurt\n\nDANZIGER – from Danzig (now Gdansk in Poland)\n\nOPPENHEIMER – from Oppenheim\n\nWIENER – from Vienna (Wien in German) – not to be confused with the name Weiner (see above for its meaning)\n\nDEUTSCH (German)\n\nPOLLACK (Polish)\n\nBRESLAU\n\nMANNHEIM\n\nCRACOW\n\nWARSHAW (Warsaw)\n\nOther Bought Names:\n\nGLUCK (good luck)\n\nROSEN (roses)\n\nROSENBLATT (rose paper or leaf)\n\nROSENBERG (rose mountain)\n\nROSENTHAL (valley of roses)\n\nROTHMAN (red man)\n\nKOENIG (king)\n\nKOENIGSBERG (king’s mountain)\n\nSPIELMAN (a person who is at leisure)\n\nLIEBER (lover)\n\nBERG (mountain)\n\nWASSERMAN (water dealer)\n\nSTEIN (glass or stone)\n\nAssigned Names (these were generally undesirable):\n\nPLOTZ (to die,explode)\n\nKLUTZ (clumsy)\n\nBILLIG (cheap)\n\nDREK (filth)\n\nKOTZE (vomit)\n\nOCHSENSCHWANTZ (ox tail)\n\nLinks\n\nAvotaynu: Consolidated Jewish Surname Index\n\nJewishGen: The JewishGen Family Finder (database of towns and surnames currently being researched by Jewish genealigists)\n\nSephardicGen Resources\n\nBooks\n\nA Dictionary of Jewish Names and Their History\n\nby Benzion C. Kaganoff. This is the single best book on the topic of Jewish family names for the general reader (some highly specialised academic tomes have been produced but tend to deal with a restricted geographical area and be very expensive). It delves into the history and development of Jewish family names, how and why names changed over time, gives numerous examples and provides a wealth of very readable information. A thoroughly entertaining and informative book. 268 pages.\n\nJewish Family Names and Their Origins: An Etymological Dictionary\n\nby Heinrich Guggenheimer and Eva Guggenheimer. Examines more names than the previous book. The current edition of this book appears to be a cheap reprint of an earlier edition.\n\nFinding Our Fathers. a Guidebook to Jewish Genealogy\n\nby Malcom H. Stern and Dan Rottenberg. Includes a section which examines some 8,000 Jewish family names and provides information about them.\n\nThe Original Birth Names of Selected Jewish Performers"
