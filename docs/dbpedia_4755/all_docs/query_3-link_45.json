        "text": "Not so long ago, Sydney Pollack went back to the town where he went to high school - South Bend, Indiana - to receive an honorary degree from the local college. While he was there, dozens of old friends, most of whom he hadn't seen in over 40 years, came up to congratulate him and to reminisce. It was then that the 67-year-old producer-director began to get confused. According to these acquaintances, he had been a happy and popular kid - but that wasn't how he remembered it at all.\n\n\"You can't trust your memory. You change it to suit yourself. They had a completely different recollection of me than I had... I remembered myself as an unpopular and rather sad kid.\"\n\nA genial, bear-faced man, Pollack still sounds mildly perplexed as he describes the series of accidents and lucky breaks that led him from small-town Indiana to Hollywood and to the kind of critical acclaim that earned him a lifetime achievement award at the Locarno film festival earlier this month. \"It seems to me a miracle... I wouldn't have the faintest idea how to do it now,\" he reflects.\n\nPollack's family were Russian-Jewish immigrants. His father, a pharmacist, paid his own way through college by boxing. \"He was a semi-professional. He fought for a company called Hoosier Beer in small bouts. He started out to be a doctor but he didn't have the money to get through it all, so he took the pharmacy degree instead.\"\n\nThe original plan was that Sydney, too, would go to medical school and maybe become a doctor or a dentist, but his father couldn't afford to send him. The youngster clearly wasn't going to earn his tuition fees in the ring. (\"I used to go and work out in the gym but I wore glasses, even as a kid,\" he remembers. \"I didn't see well enough to box. I didn't see the punches until they were too close.\")\n\nSydney couldn't quite put his finger on it, but there was something about small-town life that irked him. \"South Bend is a nice town, but you know that phrase - 'I was homesick even when I was home.'\" It didn't help that his mother - who died aged 37 - was sick for much of his childhood. Aged 17 and fresh out of high school, he approached his father with a proposal. \"I said, 'Give me a couple of years. I've saved a little bit of money, and I would like to go to New York.' I'd only seen the city in movies. I got on the train and went there... as soon as I got off the train, I knew I had made the right choice. As soon as I walked down the street, I felt that I was at least at the centre of something.\"\n\nPollack stumbled across an ad for an acting school run by Sanford Meisner. He applied and was accepted. \"It turned out to be the best acting school in the world.\" He started appearing in plays at the school, studied dance under Martha Graham - and paid for his studies by working on a lumber truck. Meisner then hired him as an assistant. \"He changed my life,\" Pollack recalls. \"He opened my eyes to everything. I was 19 years old and I was teaching acting. And I was learning from the best guy in the world. I sat in on all of Meisner's classes. What I was really doing, without knowing it, was learning a kind of basis for directing.\"\n\nPollack claims he arrived in Hollywood \"in an equally random way\". He was lured out there by his friend John Frankenheimer to work as a coach for the child actors on Frankenheimer's first big picture, The Young Savages. Then Pollack was noticed by Burt Lancaster. \"I tried to hide and stay out of the way, but Lancaster was always curious about me... at first, he would kid me and try to embarrass me in front of people. He was a big star, a very intimidating man. But I began to talk to him. He took an interest in me and when the picture was over, he called me into his office and said, 'Why are you horsing around trying to be an actor? You should be a director.'\"\n\nLancaster sent him off to Lew Wasserman - an agent and studio boss, and \"probably the most powerful man in Hollywood\" - who set him to work directing episodes of TV dramas. In those early years, Pollack and Lancaster grew very close. Neither man had been to college. \"Lancaster was a Harlem street kid who ran away to join the circus. He never lost his roots as a street kid, but he had enormous respect for any kind of art - for painting, sculpting, literature.\" Whenever the star had a problem on a movie, he would send for his young protege. Pollack thus ended up directing (uncredited) several of the key sequences in one of Lancaster's most unusual vehicles, the John Cheever adaptation The Swimmer. \"Burt said, 'Dear boy, I need you to do some work on the picture.' He didn't ask me - he told me.\"\n\nDeterminedly self-deprecating, Pollack refuses to acknowledge the part his own abilities played in his rapid rise up the Hollywood ladder. What is remarkable is the way he has juggled careers. On the morning I spoke to him, he had just flown into Switzerland from Bucharest, where he had been overseeing production of Anthony Minghella's new film, Cold Mountain. (He and Minghella are business partners in a company called Mirage, which has backed everything from small British pictures such as Iris and Sliding Doors to big studio projects such as Presumed Innocent and The Talented Mr Ripley.)\n\nHe is now much sought-after as a character actor. He took roles in films like Husbands and Wives and Eyes Wide Shut, he says, simply because he was curious to see up close how Woody Allen and Stanley Kubrick worked. He will soon be seen in Roger Michell's Changing Lanes as a sleek, avuncular but sinister lawyer - the kind of part he excels in, but has grown tired of playing. (\"Right after that, I got offered a part as a lawyer in The Sopranos, but I said, 'No, that's enough of lawyers.'\")\n\nCombining acting, producing and directing induces a certain restlessness. \"It doesn't matter what I'm doing - I wish it was something else. If I'm producing, I wish I was directing. If I'm directing, I wish I was doing almost anything else!\"\n\nOf all his key creative collaborations, he believes the one with Robert Redford to be the most important. They first acted together in War Hunt in 1962 (\"on that movie, Francis Coppola was the production assistant, bringing water to everyone,\" he chuckles) and have worked at regular intervals ever since on such pictures as Jeremiah Johnson, The Way We Were, Out of Africa and Havana. \"We did films in our 30s, in our 40s and our 50s. I've grown old with him.\"\n\nIn all these films, Pollack believes, Redford has played variations on the same character: the all-American hero with the hidden flaw. \"He has been particularly interesting to me because of his complexity. He has this golden boy exterior but there's something very dark inside which comes out in his performances. And he's a minimalist, which I like.\"\n\nThey plan to make at least one more movie together. \"I think we owe it to each other. It's a rich time in both of our lives. I'd love to try to reflect what we've learned and where we are now. That would be exciting, but people aren't writing those kind of stories.\"\n\nIn recent years, Pollack has produced many more movies than he has directed. \"The business has changed and the kind of stories I like telling aren't so much of a staple,\" he says ruefully. \"It's much more special-effects oriented. Plus there's the fact that I don't want to repeat myself. I've done 18 films and I'm looking for something that I haven't done. There are a lot of scripts I read that I'd love to go and see. That's two hours of my life. But directing is two years of my life - so I produce them instead.\""
