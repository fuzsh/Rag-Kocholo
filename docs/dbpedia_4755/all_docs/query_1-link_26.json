        "text": "PROLOGUE: AUTHOR'S NOTES\n\nEyes Wide Shut, more than any other movie, gave rise to my interest in cinema as a compelling storytelling medium. I've been haunted by the film since I first saw it upon its 1999 release, and have studied it in an attempt to understand it. So, this article is my contribution to the ongoing Stanley Kubrick film analyses swirling around out there.\n\nTo avoid rehashing what's already been extensively discussed by others, I've focused primarily on my own observations and interpretations—although much research was required to understand the film's many facets. Written purely for my own interest and not for profit, I've excluded some ideas with the intention of maybe expanding it all into a book one day. But I wanted to put out what I have so far—which is still quite thorough—in time for Eyes Wide Shut's 20-year anniversary.\n\nThis analysis is for people who like to think deeply about works of art—movies, music, literature—and draw comparisons to our own real world so that we may evolve to navigate through it with greater wisdom and understanding. It's been an education working on this essay, because as you'll see, the movie's reach goes far and wide. Watching Eyes Wide Shut has opened my mind and eyes, but writing about it has opened them even more.\n\nNik Dobrinsky / Boy Drinks Ink\n\n— July 16th, 2019\n\nAUTHOR'S NOTES ON 2024 REVISIONS\n\nIt's been five years since I first published this article in 2019, when I had rushed to get it finished for the 20th anniversary of Eyes Wide Shut's release date. While I was largely satisfied with it at the time, there were still some things bothering me. So I've taken this opportunity of the film's 25th anniversary to add a few last thoughts.\n\nSubstantial new segments include a look at the film's links to visual art and artists (in the section CARLOTTA & GISELLE), a discussion about antisemitism and conspiracy theories (in STANLEY KUBRICK IS IN THE MOVIE), and more description of connections between objects, characters, and dialogue (in PERIPHERALITY & PARALLELISM). I also added a few citations, corrected some minor technical errors, and incorporated additional references to cinema, music, and literature, wherever relevant.\n\nSome of my observations will no doubt go too far for some readers, and not far enough for others. But here they are. Now twenty-five years after it debuted, I can finally lay my obsession with Eyes Wide Shut to rest.\n\nNik Dobrinsky / Boy Drinks Ink\n\n— July 16th, 2024\n\nINTRODUCTION: A MISUNDERSTOOD MASTERPIECE\n\nEyes Wide Shut is the last work of legendary movie director Stanley Kubrick, and like many of his films it contains layers of meaning not easily deciphered or understood on first viewing. Released in 1999 to mixed responses, Eyes Wide Shut has since garnered considerable interest and has come to be regarded as one of Kubrick's finest works. Just a few days after completing the final cut, Kubrick died of a heart attack at age seventy at his home near London, England.\n\nEarly reviews described Eyes Wide Shut as an \"erotic thriller\" and \"sexual odyssey\", using words like \"Freudian\", \"dreams\", \"fantasy\", and \"guilt\". Sex is indeed a major subject in the film, but just as significant are references to class, capitalism, the world's ruling elite, and powerful secret societies. And not always as immediately apparent are seemingly endless allusions that extend across the fields of literature, music, opera, ballet, theatre, mythology, religion, politics, history, etymology, cinema, visual art, and even Kubrick's own personal life. There's a very odd quality of transtextuality to this film wherein close examination of virtually any aspect is like entering a rabbit hole into a maze of cryptic symbolism, bizarre linkages, and cross-references to other elements within the film, other works of art, and real life. Countless details initially pass unnoticed, only for deeper contemplation to unveil profoundly resonant interconnectedness.\n\nMany regard Kubrick as the greatest filmmaker of all time. Reputably obsessive and meticulous, he oversaw—with painstaking attention to detail—every aspect of his films. A perfectionist and workaholic, he commanded total control of his movies down to the selection of books on shelves appearing onscreen in the background. We're looking at the foreground, but there's lots on the outskirts that we don't know we're seeing because we don't understand it, unless we have tangential knowledge. Things in our peripheral vision are in fact—as I'll show in this essay—incredibly relevant to the themes presented in the forefront, functioning as meta-commentary on the film itself. Numerous details in Eyes Wide Shut connect to the real world in strange and surprising ways, as curious examples of how far Kubrick's vision reached, whether conscious or subconscious on his part.\n\nKubrick was often accused of favouring technical precision and lofty intellectualism to the detriment of emotional impact. Indeed, his films generally aren't for those who seek light entertainment or lack a cerebral temperament. Many of his movies have a cold, clinical quality and seem, at least on the surface, to espouse a thoroughly pessimistic view of humanity. His technical innovation in the world of cinema is unparalleled, as each of his works has an aural and visual sharpness, an exacting use of camerawork, framing, lighting, positioning, special effects, music, and so on. One thing is certain: Kubrick films always look and sound amazing. The stories, however, are often controversial, causing polarized reactions. The ways his narratives unfold subvert cinematic storytelling conventions, with bold, grandiose strokes that are sometimes so extreme as to leave audiences perplexed or infuriated. Kubrick films are challenging because he tells stories in ways we're unaccustomed to receiving them, to peculiar and often unsettling effect.\n\nAlthough his movies sometimes have a brash and brassy quality, Kubrick was actually a master of narrative subtlety—methodically calculating the most minute detail. He was a creative genius when it came to carefully constructed ambiguity, which is why his films are so often subject to controversy; different viewers see different things in them. As a result, Kubrick films were often misunderstood, receiving mixed or outright negative critical reviews upon release. Over time, however—sometimes decades—many of his movies that initially received less than favourable reviews eventually end up on Best Films of All Time lists.\n\nStanley Kubrick was, among other things, a satirist. A harsh, unapologetic one. This is profoundly clear with his movies Lolita (1962), Dr. Strangelove (1964), and A Clockwork Orange (1971)—three of his most celebrated works, and all three black comedies (about pedophilia, nuclear war, and violent crime, respectively). It's generally agreed upon that 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) is his number one—is it satire too, of science fiction? It definitely reinvented the genre in ambitious fashion. Paths of Glory (1957) and Full Metal Jacket (1987) are less obviously satire than they are antiwar films. But Paths of Glory is an ironic title given that the film condemns war's gross irrationality, courageously deglamorizing depictions of glorified war victory so common in American cinema. And a case could be made for The Shining (1980) as a sendup of slasher-horror films, a commentary on violence against women and the murderous madness of colonial patriarchy. Kubrick liked pushing the boundaries, and overamplification and exaggeration are elements of satire.\n\nSo, is Eyes Wide Shut satire? Of pornographic film, of sex and power in Hollywood? An ironic take on the Erotic Thriller genre, Murder Mystery, or Film Noir? It stars Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman as a married couple, who were a married couple in real life, both major Hollywood celebrities, and sex symbols—a case of brilliant metacinematic casting. And they were well-known Scientologists, which enhances the film's commentary on wealthy power organizations. In an interview at the time, Cruise said he didn't think he and Kidman would've been able to handle being in the movie if they were in the early part of their marriage because of the intense issues around sex and monogamy that the film addresses. But they broke up a year after Eyes Wide Shut debuted, and divorced shortly thereafter. So maybe they couldn't handle it anyway, and perhaps their time spent working on the film, and the marital issues it examines, was a factor in their separation. Kidman reportedly left Scientology after leaving Cruise, but he remains a loyal advocate. Looking through the lens of satire, some Kubrick films register more overtly so, some more subtly. And when more subtly, as in Eyes Wide Shut, viewers are perhaps less clear on the message or intent.\n\nI myself have often finished watching a Kubrick film for the first time and felt confused or exploited as an audience member, an unknowing participant in an inside joke between Kubrick and himself. A few Kubrick films I liked immediately, but others confounded me. My knee-jerk response would be to want to write him off as heavy handed, pretentious, and self-important. But something about each movie was incredibly compelling. I've been increasingly baffled since I first saw Eyes Wide Shut in the theatre in 1999, initially liking it but also kind of bothered by it. Something about it rubbed me the wrong way, but I couldn't identify exactly what it was—and that was compelling in and of itself. So, over the last twenty years I've been drawn back to watch Eyes Wide Shut again and again, studying it in an attempt to figure it out. And each new trajectory of exploration reveals increasingly captivating details and unexpected layers of meaning…to mind-blowing degrees.\n\nStanley Kubrick was a lifelong chess player, reportedly playing the game virtually daily since childhood. Watching Eyes Wide Shut indeed feels like witnessing a series of strategic orchestrations within an Escheresque chessboard dream labyrinth. The film is extraordinary in the almost inconceivable interconnectivity within its broad scope of themes, subjects, symbols, and allusions. One thing I've concluded about Eyes Wide Shut is that I'm not sure we're supposed to fully understand it. The impossibility of the title says it. The overwhelming contradictions inherent in humankind. Among other things, it's a Dream Story. And how well do we really understand our dreams?\n\nThe phrase \"hidden in plain sight\" applies to Kubrick's filmmaking methodology in which everything onscreen is purposefully chosen, even if the audience doesn't notice or understand the relevance. The saying is almost a synonym for \"eyes wide shut\"—a contradiction in terms suggesting something about perception filters of the mind, denial vs. awareness, conscious vs. subconscious vs. unconscious processes. Kubrick doesn't tell you where to look or what to think, which makes you look and think. It's this unique quality of objectivity that makes for a wide range of interpretations. Is Eyes Wide Shut an indictment of capitalism? It certainly doesn't seem to be endorsing it. Is it misogynistic, chauvinistic, bourgeois, and pretentious? Or is it condemning misogyny, chauvinism, materialism, and pretentiousness?\n\nPerhaps Eyes Wide Shut is many things at once; a disturbing satire, scathing indictment of the grotesquely wealthy and those with sleazy bourgeois values who seek to be like them, a fantasy story, and a sincere, thoughtful study of marriage, sex, and class, how these subjects relate to human perception and emotion, and the often unseen or imagined forces that drive us all. Eyes Wide Shut is not just a stylized marital drama, but also an alternative Love Story, as much as an alternative Christmas Movie, as much as a Dream Movie. And Stanley Kubrick was perhaps the world's most successful maker of mainstream art films. He found a way—like few before him or since—to make interpretive movies that are commercially successful in popular culture while simultaneously appealing to cult film audiences, intellectuals and academics, cinephiles, critics, artists, and fellow filmmakers.\n\nAmidst an onslaught of negative early reviews, essayist Tim Kreider gave a favourable, detailed critique of Eyes Wide Shut with his article Introducing Sociology. Kreider wrote that the film's initially poor reception was \"generally blamed on a miscalculated ad campaign\". It was promoted as a movie about sex, featuring two of the era's biggest sex symbols and movie stars in the world—Tom Cruise as Bill Harford and Nicole Kidman as Alice Harford, a real-life married couple playing an onscreen married couple—and therefore people expected the movie to be sexy. But Kubrick mocks this preconception from the very first shot, showing Alice as she \"shrugs off her dress and kicks it aside\". Kubrick gives the audience a few seconds of what many came to see the film for, \"a big-time movie star naked\", as if to get it out of the way in order to move on to the serious stuff. Then the screen cuts to black and the paradoxical main title appears, \"telling us that we're not really seeing what we're staring at. In other words, Eyes Wide Shut is not going to be about sex\" (Kreider, Introducing).\n\nBut Eyes Wide Shut is very much about sex. So, what I take from Kreider's point is that it's just not only about sex—it's also about capitalism, psychology, communication, and so much more. Kubrick, and co-screenwriter Frederic Raphael, adapted Eyes Wide Shut from a 1926 novella by Austrian writer Arthur Schnitzler; the original German title of this source material is Traumnovelle, which translates as Dream Story. So, maybe Eyes Wide Shut is more about dreams.\n\nThe movie in fact touches on many works of art, genres, and subjects that span thousands of years, including: the ancient myths Helen of Troy and The Tale of Cupid and Psyche, Beethoven's opera Fidelio, the 19th-century ballet Giselle, John Milton's 17th-century masque Comus, and classic children's fantasy stories such as L. Frank Baum's The Wizard of Oz, Dr. Seuss's How the Grinch Stole Christmas, and Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking-Glass. There are also unexpected connections to Kubrick's own films, and to a diverse range of other movies, such as Roman Polanski's Rosemary's Baby (1968), Woody Allen's Manhattan (1979), Paul Mazursky's Blume in Love (1973), and Hans Richter's Dreams That Money Can Buy (1947).\n\nAnd there are stunning metacinematic elements wherein real-life details surrounding Stanley Kubrick, his family, and others associated with Eyes Wide Shut are riddled throughout the movie and interconnected in often uncanny ways. Which connections were consciously orchestrated by Kubrick versus which are coincidental is the subject of ongoing debate, but ultimately inconsequential. We see what we see. Some linkages are more obviously meaningful, and others more nuanced and supplemental. But because of Kubrick's well-documented obsessiveness about every aspect of his movies, it can be assumed that little to nothing that appears in Eyes Wide Shut is happenstance.\n\nMISE-EN-SCÈNE / MISE-EN-ABYME\n\nMise-en-scène is a French cinematic term, meaning \"placing on stage\", and refers in film production to everything that appears before the camera; the selection and arrangement of every visible object within the frame, the placement and movement of the objects and actors, the set design, costumes, etc. Kubrick was an unparalleled master of mise-en-scène, with an acute sense of framing and positioning.\n\nWhile some footage was shot in real locations in New York and England, much of what is supposed to be 1999 New York City was constructed on soundstages in London, UK. Examining the mise-en-scène in Eyes Wide Shut reaffirms Kubrick's understanding of the art of cinema as a visual storytelling form, not only with the placement of objects but the selection of them; books titles on shelves, signs on buildings, pictures on walls, and movies that play, within the movie, on television screens in the background—all prove to be profoundly relevant.\n\nConversely to mise-en-scène is the art term mise-en-abyme, meaning \"placing into abyss\". It refers to a technique of placing a copy of an image within itself and/or of inserting a story within a story­. An abyss is a deep or bottomless chasm that in mythology leads to an underworld—and the phrase mise-en-abyme is described as capturing the visual experience of standing between two mirrors, suggesting an infinitely recurring image or sequence. The term derived from heraldry and is also called the Droste Effect, in which a picture appears within itself. Mise-en-abyme can likewise occur in film, literature, and other media, resulting in a recursive, reflexive, and/or metafictional effect, involving details within the work mirroring each other and sometimes referring to the medium itself.\n\nThis mise-en-scène/mise-en-abyme, house-of-mirrors scheme reverberates throughout Eyes Wide Shut with its time structure in relation to story events, duality and mirroring themes, the contradiction in the title, metacinematic elements, and real-life Kubrick associations. The story involves the main character's descent into an \"abyss\" of sorts, with seemingly endlessly meaningful symbols, images, objects in every frame.\n\nWhat results is a kind of artistic Rubik's Cube—a Kubrick's Cube—or more accurately, Kubrick's Parallelepiped or something. A many-sided, prismatic tesseract of multidimensional meaning; a phosphenic crossword puzzle, strange loop of interconnectivity that transcends across numerous frequencies in a complex narrative web. A work of art.\n\nMETA-DIALOGUE: COMMUNICATION & UNDERSTANDING\n\nThe story starts in earnest with the first line of dialogue, spoken by protagonist Bill Harford: \"Honey, have you seen my wallet?\" This establishes what will become a recurring theme; Bill as the consumer. A comfortably wealthy medical doctor though not a member of the elite ultrawealthy class, Bill fancies himself capable of buying his way into anything. But as we discover throughout the film, he is a mere midlevel servant to this powerful upper class, who has himself already been bought. One of Eyes Wide Shut's primary themes is that the ultrarich treat everything, even people, as commodities. And those who aren't members of the wealthiest elite often strive, in whatever unconscious ways, to join this same ruling class that exerts power over them. So Bill speaking this line to Alice, who from the next room tells him exactly where his wallet is, also sets up her role in the film as \"the wife as prostitute\" (Kreider, Introducing). Alice uses her appearance and sexuality to buy in, and Bill uses his money—but neither one of them can ever really join the club.\n\nEyes Wide Shut (hereafter, EWS) utilizes dialogue in unusual ways. Bill frequently parrots lines spoken by other characters; sometimes as a question, as if unsure of what he's hearing. Domino says, \"Would you like to come inside with me?\" and Bill repeats, \"Come inside with you\", as if reviewing what she's just said. At the end of their encounter Domino asks, \"Do you have to go?\" Bill replies, \"Do I have to go?\" Victor says, \"It's heroin and coke\", and Bill responds, \"Heroin and coke\". And Sally says, \"She may not even be coming back\", which Bill echoes word for word. This dialogue device continually reiterates Bill's uncertainty about what he's experiencing, and reinforces the film's mirroring qualities.\n\nThe dialogue also includes unexpected links to other creative works. Sandor Szavost (Sky du Mont) says to Alice: \"Don't you think one of the charms of marriage is that it makes deception a necessity for both parties?\" Both parties applies not only to two spouses, but to the two parties in the film; Ziegler's and the masked ball. This line is taken from Oscar Wilde's 1890 novel The Picture of Dorian Gray: \"The one charm of marriage is that it makes a life of deception absolutely necessary for both parties.\" EWS also features dialogue lifted from James Cameron's True Lies (1994), starring Arnold Schwarzenegger as a spy who conceals his true identity from his wife. At the film's outset he dances with a woman—like Szavost and Alice dance—at a party not dissimilar to Ziegler's. Discussing 6th-century-B.C. sculptures, the woman asks, \"You like the period?\" to which Schwarzenegger replies, \"Oh, I adore it.\" In EWS, Szavost asks Alice \"Do you like the period?\" referring to Ziegler's collection of Renaissance bronzes, and then says, \"I adore it\". The paradoxically titled True Lies and Eyes Wide Shut both involve marital dishonesty, but otherwise have little in common, so it's peculiar that Kubrick makes this connection.\n\nSome have criticized EWS's dialogue as flat and unrealistic, but this is no doubt intentional on Kubrick's part. The slow, measured manner in which the characters often speak—especially Bill and Alice—contributes to the dream atmosphere, giving us the time to observe the surroundings wherein symbolic meaning abounds, and the space to contemplate how virtually every line resonates on multiple levels. A lot of the dialogue functions as not only character communication within the story but also as commentary on the film itself. Kubrick's characters themselves are very much a part of his mise-en-scène—mechanisms of his \"visual experience\"—in the deliberate way they move and talk; they're not just speaking to each other but to the audience directly, about the movie.\n\nFor example, one of the first lines spoken by Alice, as she and Bill are in their apartment getting ready to go to their \"friend\" Victor Ziegler's party, is \"You’re not even looking at it.\" In one respect this is simply her reaction to her husband's lack of attention when she asks him how her hair looks (he's looking at himself in a mirror in that moment), but it also speaks to the characters' blindness to capitalist influence in their lives, and some critical naysayers' blindness to the deeper meanings of the film itself; as Eyes Wide Shut—arguably the greatest title in the history of cinema—also suggests.\n\nZiegler, in his final confrontation with Bill, says, \"Suppose I said that all of that was staged.\" Within the film, the line refers to events at the mansion's masquerade party. But it also applies to the film's multilayered fabric; how the very surface appearance is indeed meticulously staged to be the center of attention, as a sort of misdirection from the film's deeper issues and thus mirroring the real-life misdirection orchestrated over people by the ruling class, corporate superpowers, and governing agencies—and by Kubrick over his audience.\n\nAnother example of how dialogue is used in this way is when Bill says to the prostitute Domino (Vinessa Shaw), \"So, do you, do you suppose we should talk about...money?\" Again, on the surface this line is about their impending sexual transaction, but it's also a prompt for what we, the audience, should be talking about as one of the film's main topics: money. Throughout Bill's misadventures he spends large amounts of cash without scarcely batting an eye, offering up hundreds of dollars to a prostitute, a cab driver, and a costume store owner. His name, after all, is \"Doctor Bill\"—a pun, like \"dollar bill\" as a form of currency, or a \"bill\" as a receipt of a financial transaction—as if he himself is just another instrument of the wealthy elite.\n\nThen Bill asks Domino—again ostensibly about their sexual transaction—\"What do you have in mind?\" She answers, \"I'd rather not put it into words.\" These lines function as further commentary on the film itself, and how Kubrick thought movie-watching should be foremost a visual experience \"that bypasses verbalized pigeonholing and directly penetrates the subconscious\". Kubrick is again telling us to think differently, to open ourselves to receiving this film (and all his films) in ways we are unaccustomed to. In this way the movie might be regarded as being all about communication, between Bill and Alice, between Bill and himself, and between Kubrick and the audience. On the phone to Alice, Bill says, \"It's a little difficult to talk right now.\" Then near the end of the story, when Bill sees the mask on the pillow and Alice wakes up, he says, \"I'll tell you everything.\" But it cuts to the next morning and we don't actually hear what he tells her.\n\nThere is in fact considerable attention given to different communication forms in EWS; how the mediums by which we broadcast our messages function in relation to understanding. When we understand something we say, \"Oh, I see.\" There's seeing with the eyes, and seeing with the mind. A movie is a medium of communication, and the title Eyes Wide Shut applies as much to the protagonist Bill Harford as it does to us, the viewers, and our limited ability to comprehend the world's vast, often contradictory complexities as reflected in this film. So, in addition to dialogue, there are many other means of communication in EWS; written notes on paper, paintings and signs on walls, movies playing on television screens, and telephone calls.\n\nOn Bill's nighttime streetwalk, he passes a man on a payphone who says, \"Oh, I see, I'm taking care of it baby.\" Alice calls Bill on his cellphone when he's at Domino's. Bill calls Marion from his office only to hang up when Carl answers. Nick Nightingale receives a call from the mansion folk while he sits with Bill at the Sonata Café. Bill receives a call from Ziegler's people when he's at the hospital. And immediately after Alice's revelation about her sexual fantasy with another man, Bill gets a phone call at home, ostensibly to inform him that a patient has just died. He hangs up and says, \"I think I have to go over there and show my face.\" He's staring off into space as he utters the line, as if saying it to himself more than Alice. This begins Bill's odyssey, and later that night he ends up at the masquerade party where he's exposed as an impostor, told to remove his mask, and show his face. So, when he speaks the line to Alice, Bill has already entered his own internal dream reality, and is not just talking about paying a professional visit to his client, but rather about going to the dark side to show who he really is.\n\nThere are also numerous instances of written messages on paper being passed around: Nick writes the mansion password \"Fidelio\" on a paper napkin at the Sonata. Bill flashes around his medical license card every chance he gets. Bill buys a newspaper and sits in a coffee shop to read it, and later shows a torn-out article from it to Ziegler. And when Bill revisits the mansion, the gateman hands him a threatening letter which in part reads, \"Give up your inquiries, which are entirely useless.\" This plays as another metacinematic comment about EWS itself—as if Kubrick knew the film would result in countless obsessive analyses, and is telling the viewer to \"give up trying to figure out or solve this movie\" and just enjoy the ride.\n\nMultifunctional dialogue, phone calls, notes…it all feels like a series of muffled, muted attempts at communication. But it's hazy and isn't quite connecting, because it's all about Bill, and he's not being honest. Communication is, experts say, the number one requirement for a healthy relationship.\n\nSKULL & BONES, FREEMASONRY, & SCIENTOLOGY\n\nAmong Eyes Wide Shut's many themes is an examination of ruling-class decadence; capitalism's designation of all things, even people, as objects to be bought, used, and discarded by the world's wealthiest crooks. This includes alternately conspicuous and obscure allusions to the Freemasons, Skull and Bones, Scientology, the CIA, and other related agencies and secret projects, as connected to history, literature, occultism, and mythology. Kubrick isn't just exploring the sexual psychology between a husband and wife, but also the powerful role that socioeconomic class and the culture of the ultrawealthy elite play in shaping aspects of society—including the sexual psychology of everyday people—in often unseen ways. But the people can still overcome the powers, if they open their eyes.\n\nIn this regard, critic Adrian Mack offered insightful analysis of EWS upon its 2007 DVD rerelease (The Nerve magazine). Mack observes that the opening shot shows Alice framed between Masonic pillars and in front of a window with the blinds drawn in the shape of a triangle—the pyramidal crest of the Freemasons. In this first few seconds, much is implied about the weighty concepts the movie explores; a naked woman's body (with her back to us, so we can't see her face) immediately objectified between visual symbols of one of the world's oldest and most powerful secret societies of men. At one point Bill is accosted on the street by a group of young men—some wearing \"Yale\" varsity jackets—who hurl homophobic slurs at him. Mack notes that Yale University is \"the home of Skull and Bones, which is apparently bound by a circle of mutual, sexual blackmail. Those future Presidents like to nail each other in coffins, I hear\" (The Nerve, 20)—referring to the hazing and initiation rites of secret societies and fraternities.\n\nIn Fleshing Out Skull & Bones, Kris Millegan outlines the historic role of this organization. He describes the roots of Skull and Bones as beginning with Yale graduate Nathan Hale, a member of the Culper Ring, \"one of America’s first intelligence operations\" which was established by George Washington during the British occupation of New York City in the American Revolutionary War. The membership of The Order of Skull and Bones has included numerous powerbrokers and US Presidents since its official birth in 1832 (Millegan, 1-12). Three generations of Bush males were members of S&B: George W. Bush (former US president), George H.W. Bush (former US president, vice president, and CIA director), and Prescott Bush (a banker and later US Senator who helped fund Hitler's regime) (7-15, 676). Some allege S&B was connected with a secret program called Project Monarch, a \"mind-control project…which started in Nazi Germany\" (Millegan, 15). Given the history of Skull and Bones—born out of Yale, a school of the elite, and parent organization to the CIA—and its membership of men in positions of extreme power, Kubrick's reference to Yale is surely no accident.\n\nNor are visual references to the Freemasons, a secret society dating back centuries, with symbols and traditions that have infiltrated modern culture through art, architecture, and politics. The Masonic pillars and pyramidal crest shape of the opening shot appear repeatedly in EWS; the pillars are seen framing either side of the entranceway to the Somerton mansion, and the triangular or diamond-shaped crest is visible on buildings when Bill walks the streets. In Freemasons: Inside the World’s Oldest Secret Society, H. Paul Jeffers writes that detractors of Freemasonry have \"denounced it as a seed of paganism and/or being anti-Christian, explorers of dark mysteries of the Occult, a web of Satanism\" (158). Jeffers lists powerful historical figures who were Masons: Winston Churchill, John Diefenbaker, Benjamin Franklin, J. Edgar Hoover, Ronald Reagan, and Henry Ford, among others (213-219).\n\nIn the source novella Dream Story, the protagonist is elbowed on the street by one of several \"fraternity\" youths who walk by—the equivalent of the Yale students in EWS. The one who bumps into him has a \"bandage over his left eye\" (Schnitzler, 22). Kubrick, however, left this out of his adaptation of a story about eyes and seeing. In the late 1950s, Kubrick had signed on to direct One-Eyed Jacks (1961)—only to abandon the project due mainly to disputes with its star Marlon Brando, who ended up directing it himself (Vincent LoBrutto, Stanley Kubrick: A Biography, 164). Leaving Dream Story's one-eyed, eyepatch-wearing guy out of Eyes Wide Shut parallels Kubrick leaving One-Eyed Jacks out of his film repertoire.\n\nAt Ziegler's party, a woman Bill flirts with says she remembers him from when they previously met, when she had something caught in her eye at Rockefeller Plaza and he assisted her. Site of the iconic giant Christmas tree—another of EWS's recurring symbols—New York City's Rockefeller Plaza was built by the Rockefellers, one the wealthiest families in history. The Somerton mansion in EWS is Mentmore Towers, a 19th-century English country house built for the Rothschild family, another of the world's biggest banking empires.\n\nConsidering Kubrick started out as a still photographer for Look magazine, it's fitting he ended his career with Eyes Wide Shut, which contains so many references to eyes, looking, and seeing. And The Shining is set in the Overlook Hotel, another Kubrick movie that has been analyzed to death and, like EWS, has had many details overlooked. When describing the naval officer, Alice says to Bill, \"He glanced at me as he walked past. Just a glance.\" In Bill's medical examination room, he says \"Looking forward to Christmas?\" to his boy patient. And in Ziegler's bathroom, Bill attends to Mandy following her overdose. \"Can you open your eyes for me?\" he says, \"Let me see you open your eyes.\" And then, \"Look at me. Look at me. Look at me. Look at me.\"\n\nThe Spanish film Open Your Eyes (Abre los Ojos, 1997), by writer-director Alejandro Amenábar, was remade as Vanilla Sky starring Tom Cruise, which registers as kind of a cinematic footnote to Eyes Wide Shut with themes also involving sex, dreams, duality, and masks. The first and last words spoken in both versions are \"open your eyes\", which is also a better title than Vanilla Sky—but perhaps Cruise (who also co-produced the film) didn't want to star in another movie with \"eyes\" in the title so soon after EWS. It was released in 2001, as was Amenábar's follow-up The Others, a ghost story starring Nicole Kidman. Todd Field (EWS's Nick Nightingale) wrote and directed In the Bedroom, also 2001—about affairs of the heart gone terribly wrong—and had reportedly consulted Kubrick about it while shooting EWS. The film stars William Mapother, the first cousin of Tom Cruise (born Thomas Cruise Mapother). 2001 was also the year Steven Spielberg's A.I. came out, which Kubrick spent years developing. And 2001 is, of course, the title of Kubrick's most celebrated work.\n\nMirrors are all over the place in EWS. The very first shot shows Alice undressing, with her back to us, in the Harfords' apartment dressing room. The light is on and a full-size mirror is visible beside her, but Alice's reflection in the mirror is not visible. The second shot is of Bill in the same room, fully clothed, with his back to us—seemingly peeking out the window through Venetian blinds. The light is off so Bill is in the dark, but his reflection is visible in the mirror beside him. The third shot shows Bill moving from the bedroom to the bathroom, where he looks at himself in the mirror.\n\nMirrors appear at Ziegler's, Domino's, and the Harfords', with characters peering into them at reflections of themselves—especially Alice. Frequently told how \"beautiful\", \"stunning\", and \"amazing\" she looks, Alice's identity is validated by others according to her physical appearance. In the scene where Alice and Bill start to make love, his attention is focused solely on her, but she is looking at herself in the mirror, a moment \"of clearest self-recognition, an uncomfortable glimpse of what she really is\" (Kreider, Introducing). The mirrors also invoke Lewis Carroll's Through the Looking-Glass, about a girl named Alice who climbs through a mirror into a fantasy world of inverted logic. Like the masks that also appear throughout EWS, the mirror symbolizes the characters' exploration of self, their image, and their secret identities in contrast to how they appear to the outside world.\n\nFascinatingly, the film itself is also a kind of mirror, structurally. The climactic mansion scene falls in the exact middle; it commences at 70 minutes in, lasts for 20 minutes, and ends with 70 minutes remaining in the 160-minute-long movie. When Bill's cab pulls up to the mansion, the SOMERTON sign is to right of the driveway, but a few seconds later the sign is on the left. When he returns the next day, he drives up to the gate from the opposite direction than the cab had approached from. Leading up to the mansion scene, Bill engages in a number of scenarios—at Ziegler's, his office, his patient's house, Domino's apartment, the jazz club, the costume store. And following the mansion scene he revisits each location. This near-perfect mirror structure of the Eyes Wide Shut narrative arc reinforces the mirror as a symbol of duality and alternate dimensions, as reflected through the shape and time of the film itself; mise-en-abyme. It also shows Kubrick's tendency for unorthodox story structure, as conventional films follow a narrative trajectory in which the climax occurs in the last third before a brief conclusion. Yet he was always one to reinvent, transcending the usual storytelling constraints of traditional cinema to create something thoroughly unique.\n\nThere are a whole lot of lights in the darkness in Eyes Wide Shut. Our protagonist, insecure about his sexuality, travels through a realm bursting with symbols of fertility worship; Christmas trees, decorations, lights. Near the end of the movie, Bill returns home and switches off the Christmas tree lights. What does this mean? That Bill is impotent, can't climax? Psychologically, at least. Or perhaps he's finally come to terms with his feelings of sexual inadequacy. Manhattan's Rockefeller Center is the site of a massive Christmas tree that is erected and lit in public ceremony annually. So if it's a phallic symbol, when that woman at Ziegler's mentions the location to Bill, it's sexual innuendo—as if they're talking about a giant phallus.\n\nIn Traumnovelle, the time setting is \"just before the close of the Carnival season\" (4). Kubrick transplants the source novella's time and place—1920s Vienna—to 1999 New York City during the Christmas season; the high point of consumerist indulgence in North American society. The Carnival developed as an end-of-winter celebration before the Christian season of Lent—a time of fasting and abstaining from various luxuries. In contrast, the Carnival typically involves celebratory practices that include alcohol consumption (and other substances), feasting, parades, and wearing of masks and costumes. Other Carnival features include theatrical displays of social satire, mockery of authorities, grotesquely exaggerated sexual behaviours, and generally debaucherous and degrading acts.\n\nIn the novella it's implied the couple are Jewish, as author Schnitzler was. Kubrick was also of Jewish descent, but said he wanted the couple to be \"vanilla\" and that Bill should be a \"Harrison Ford-ish goy\", although Ford's mother was Jewish (The Wolf at the Door, 29). The surname Harford is a portmanteau of HARrison FORD, an allusion to the actor. Kubrick's transposition of the novella's European-Jewish protagonist to an all-American, upper-middle class WASP fits with the parallel substitution of Carnival with Christmas, magnifying the commentary on American capitalism. But many aspects of the Carnival are still present, particularly at the masked orgy.\n\nThe masks Kubrick uses are Venetian, which broadens the themes of commerce and consumption, as Venice was long a center of mercantilism and eroticism. Masks hang on the walls of Domino's apartment, and \"domino\" is indeed a style of Venetian Carnival mask. In the film's opening seconds, Bill peers out his apartment window through Venetian blinds, which also appear in his doctor's office and Domino's bedroom. It's like Bill looking out through the eyeholes of his Venetian mask, as if he's inside his own psyche, and recalls the saying \"the eyes are the windows to the soul\". Masks serve throughout the film as a prime symbol of identity; our own self-perception versus the perception of others. Disguises we wear in different scenarios. The roles we play. The secrets we keep.\n\nFor many, Christmas represents indulgence, temptation, desire—for parties, food, liquor, chocolate, or bigger and better material possessions that often don't satisfy. Just as Bill Harford is continually sexually tempted throughout the film, without ever actually engaging or achieving satisfaction. The consumption aspect of Christmas has, for many, supplanted religious practices associated with it, so it's an appropriate season in which to set this story that includes many ancient symbols and practices that have been co-opted and deformed by power structures throughout history. Christmas itself is a multifaceted holiday encompassing elements of cultural anthropology, mythology, capitalism, religion, nature worship, and paganism. The \"Christmas Movie\" mixes in with other aspects of Americana, contributing to the holiday atmosphere for many who seek not only celebration of materialism and sensual decadence, but also comfort and a sense of wonder.\n\nChristmas has been marketed to children as a fairy story full of magic. But Kubrick projects it through a dark, twisted lens, invoking a sense of satire and qualifying EWS as an unconventional Christmas Movie in its own right. In the holiday favourite It's a Wonderful Life (1946), an angel descends from heaven at Christmastime to help a depressed man appreciate his life by showing him a terrifying alternate reality in which he had never existed. As an alternative Christmas Movie, EWS parallels It's a Wonderful Life in that both stories depict a man who undergoes a frightening journey through a dystopian nightmare world during the Christmas season. EWS draws parallels as well to Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol (1843) in that both protagonists are also shaken to the core when they're exposed to disturbing alternate plains of existence. The Ghosts of Christmas Past, Present, and Future. Kubrick described The Shining as \"a ghost story\", and while EWS is not clearly in the same category, there are plenty of clues indicating that many of the events and characters we witness are not real, leaving a haunting effect of its own.\n\nAnother popular Christmas story is the classic children's book How the Grinch Stole Christmas! (1957) by Dr. Seuss, seen in EWS on the kitchen table when Alice and Helena (Madison Eginton) are having breakfast. Later at the mansion orgy, a naked party guest wearing a very Grinch-like mask is seen having sex with a masked woman. It's another example of parallels between different aspects of Bill's life; his home life and his fantasy life, his external and internal worlds—and further implies that much of what we see is in fact in Bill's mind. But where fantasy and reality start and end isn't concrete, it's all swirling together concurrently, enigmatically, paradoxically. On a side note, in real life Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman were married on Christmas Eve; December 24th, 1990.\n\nThe Christmastime setting also provides Kubrick with an opportunity to create a sumptuous visual feast for the viewer. The movie is saturated with a dreamlike array of colours and lights; sometimes to an almost obnoxious degree, in echoing the theme of Christmas season excess. Kubrick almost exclusively used \"practical\" lighting in EWS (as he also did in Barry Lyndon)—lights that appear in the diegetic world of the film (lamps, streetlights, Christmas lights). But since these light levels are normally considered too low for a movie shoot, Kubrick \"push-developed\" the entire film, instructing the lab to leave the film stock in the developing bath longer than is usual—essentially overprocessing\" it in order to enhance the images and achieve a unique, slightly surreal look (The Stanley Kubrick Archives, 771). This lush multicoloring embellishes Eyes Wide Shut's multilayered narrative fabric, and connects it with another recurring symbol in the film: rainbows. The movie itself, both literally and figuratively, contains layers of different colours forming one greater whole, a thing of wonder.\n\nRainbows are first referenced at Ziegler's party when Bill flirts with the two women who seem to be leading him away. When he stops to inquire where they are going, the women reply, \"Where the rainbow ends.\" At this point Bill hesitates, unsure if he wants to go where the rainbow ends. In popular mythology, what's at the end of the rainbow? A pot of gold. This once again symbolizes money, wealth, desire, and the illusion of an unattainable goal. Bill's reluctance to pursue the \"pot of gold\" in this instance, even though he's obviously flirting with the women, exemplifies his pursuit yet hesitancy at other times in the story, as he seeks out sexual opportunities without ever actually having sex—hence the character's confusion over his self-identity, and the paradox the title suggests.\n\nThe rainbow reference returns with the store Rainbow Costume Rental, which also happens to be situated over another store named Under the Rainbow. According to Adrian Mack, \"The rainbow references are rooted in The Wizard of Oz, which is important to the mythology of Project Monarch...In the '70s, the codename for L. Ron Hubbard's top secret base…was 'Over the Rainbow'\" (The Nerve, 20). One of the women is named Gayle, which connects to Bill's friend Nick Nightingale and to Dorothy Gale, the protagonist of The Wizard of Oz. And The Wizard of Oz's theme song \"Over the Rainbow\" includes such lyrics as \"the dreams that you dare to dream really do come true.\"\n\nDREAMS & ALTERNATE REALITIES\n\nDreams, as discussed by Martin Scorsese in his introduction to Michel Ciment's book Kubrick, are another of Eyes Wide Shut's main topics. Scorsese emphasizes that the English translation of Schnitzler's German-titled Traumnovelle is Dream Story. He attributes the film's initial widespread negative reaction to the fact that \"audiences really had no preparation for a dream movie that didn't announce itself as such, without the usual signals—hovering mists, people appearing and disappearing at will or floating off the ground\" (vii).\n\nWith a subtly antithetical design, EWS is a story conveyed in an unusual manner, leaving many viewers scratching their heads. But, Scorsese says, Kubrick was a visionary: \"like all visionaries, he spoke the truth. And no matter how comfortable we think we are with the truth, it always comes as a profound shock when we're forced to meet it face-to-face\" (vii). One of the supreme truths in this film being that not only is extreme wealth not sexy, but in fact nightmarish and grotesque.\n\nScorsese's note about EWS being a dream movie that isn't presented with the usual markings of such is an important point in understanding how to regard it, and perhaps why many find it so confusing or an outright failure. But when approaching the movie with this in mind, a lot makes sense from the perspective that what we see is not actually happening, except in Bill Harford's imagination. The illogical seems more logical then. Although it might not be readily apparent, much of what we're witnessing may in fact be a dream.\n\nWhen Bill offers to show his ID (to Mr. Milich, to Sally, to the diner waitress), he's in effect saying—from a Freudian standpoint—\"Let me show you my id\". Freud says that in the id: \"contrary impulses exist side by side, without cancelling each other out.…There is nothing in the id which corresponds to the idea of time\" (New Introductory Lectures, 106).\n\nTime is a prominent thread throughout the story, which unfolds, preposterously, over the course of about two-and-a-half days. Bill's second spoken line is, \"Listen, you know we're running a little late.\" He continually looks at his wristwatch; before entering the Nathanson residence, in front of the Sonata Café the day after the Somerton affair, and at Milich's where he says, \"I've obviously left things a bit late tonight.\" Bill is like the White Rabbit from Alice in Wonderland who laments his lateness while looking at his pocket watch. Outside Somerton the cab driver asks Bill, \"How long you gonna be?\" Bill replies, \"I don't know, maybe an hour or more, but maybe only ten minutes.\" When Domino asks Bill for the time, he checks his watch and says \"Ten past twelve.\" A moment later in her apartment, Domino says, \"Don't worry, I don't keep track of the time.\" Then Alice calls Bill asking how much longer he will be. Bill: \"It could be awhile.\" Alice: \"Any idea how long?\" Bill: \"No, I don't really know.\" It's dreamtime.\n\nLabelling EWS an erotic thriller isn't really an accurate description except as the most basic, superficial categorization of such a complex film. Yes, sex is a subject in the movie, and yes it's suspenseful at times, but the only sex we're shown is in a situationally gratuitous context at the mansion scene, and it's less erotic than it is cold and voyeuristic since we're seeing through the eyes of the protagonist who doesn't actually sexually engage himself. It might more fittingly be described as a slipstream fantasy; a subgenre of speculative fiction in which characters inexplicably \"slip\" in and out of alternate timelines, parallel dimensions, and/or streams of consciousness in which some similar qualities persist while others are skewed or inverted. Loops in time. Characters' traits transposed. Illogical scenarios.\n\nOn one hand the genre prescribed to a story doesn't matter much, and is merely a label to advertise the work. But on the other hand this label can be important, to frame the work in a certain context and prepare the audience for a particular mindset through which to receive it. But whatever the genre, EWS is certainly a visually and aurally dazzling, thought-provoking work with seemingly infinite, intertwining layers, symbols, and allusions—worthy of considerable debate.\n\nKubrick was always very involved in his films' promotional campaigns. But since he died four months before EWS was released, who knows how much say he had in it in this case. Although it's now largely agreed upon that EWS marketing was flawed in mislabelling it an erotic thriller, in retrospect it's actually fitting to have been billed as such; it strengthens its standing as satire in that it's more cold and creepy than hot and steamy, and so perhaps appropriately misunderstood. A sex movie where the protagonist never has sex. A dream movie that isn't obviously one. Kubrick even kind of parodies the \"it was all a dream\" cliché B-movie ending with the last bit of dialogue between Bill and Alice; she says they should be grateful that they've survived all of their adventures, \"Whether they were real or only a dream,\" to which Bill replies, \"And no dream is ever just a dream.\"\n\nDUALITY & DOPPELGÄNGERS\n\nEyes Wide Shut is filled with doppelgängers, duality, doubling, repetition; multiple characters and symbols alluding to aspects of each other in a story that plays as a series of illusions.\n\nFollowing his wife's revelation of her sexual fantasy about another man, Dr. Bill Harford begins his odyssey by going to his patient Lou Nathanson's residence. In this scene there are visual cues that he has passed into a fantasy of his own, starting with the arrangement of set pieces in the lobby. Bill enters a room full of paired objects; there are two elevator doors, two glass doors, and two windows. Positioned on opposite ends of the screen are two potted plants, two stools, two lamps, two side tables, and two framed pictures, each item apparently identical to its duplicate. Bill proceeds into the interior of the house through this picture of duality as if entering into a mirror. He walks down a hallway into a room where his recently deceased patient lies, whose daughter Marion (Marie Richardson) sits by the side of the bed. Bill sits next to her in a chair identical to the one she sits in, with a pair of identical windows behind them.\n\nMarion suddenly kisses Bill and tells him she's in love with him. She's engaged to be married, she says, but would gladly leave her fiancé for the chance to be with Bill, or at the very least to live near him. Harford declines her offer, and soon after the fiancé, Carl, arrives. Marion offering herself to Bill mirrors his own wife's fantasy, who described herself as having been willing to give up their life together for a chance to have sex with a man she didn't know.\n\nAnd here's where another fascinating metacinematic element is presented. Carl is played by another actor named Tom: Thomas Gibson, who was born on the exact same day, month, and year, as Thomas Cruise—July 3rd, 1962. The two actors bear a moderate resemblance, with similar physiques, hair colour, and hairstyle—and in the film Carl's hair is parted on the opposite side of his head than Bill's hair is parted. When the Nathansons' housekeeper Rosa opens the door for Carl, the camera's point of view is from the opposite angle than when she opened the door for Bill minutes before. Carl is a \"math professor\", meaning he has a PhD and is therefore a \"doctor\", and Bill is a doctor of medicine. In real life, they have the same birthday, the same first name, and a similar boyish all-American look. Gibson's character's name is Carl Thomas; initials C.T., the reverse of Tom Cruise's initials T.C.\n\nAnd it gets even more interesting when looking at the name etymology. Thomas is the Anglicized form of the Italian Tomasso, from the Aramaic toma (t'om'a), which means \"twin\" (Dictionary of First Names, 260). The first name of the actors Thomas Cruise and Thomas Gibson, who in real life have the exact same birthdate, and play alternate reality versions of each other in EWS—their name means \"twin\". And the name Thomas is also etymologically linked to the word mason—as in the Freemasons—meaning \"one who works with stone\"; mason is from maso, which is also shortened from Tomasso. The name Carl is the shortened form of Charles, meaning \"free man\" (Dictionary of First Names, 52). So the character's full name then essentially translates as \"Free Mason\". And Saint Thomas, one of the Twelve Apostles, was known as \"Doubting Thomas\", which fits Bill's character. Rosa refers to Carl as \"Mr. Thomas\"—that is, \"Mr. Twin\".\n\nI'd always wondered how Thomas Gibson, known primarily as a television actor, got this bit part in a Kubrick film. In addition to playing a doppelgänger (German for \"double-goer\") of sorts to EWS's Bill, Gibson previously starred in another movie with Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman; Far and Away (1992), in which he played the rival of Cruise's character vying for the affections of Kidman's character. Far and Away was the second film Cruise and Kidman starred in together, the third and last was Eyes Wide Shut. The sitcom Gibson starred in at the time was set in kind of a parallel universe to EWS; Dharma & Greg, in which he played a lawyer (rather than a doctor) who is also in a yuppie marriage with a thin blonde woman.\n\nBill has slipped into a slanted version of his wife's fantasy, reflected through his own mind, wherein he has taken the role of the stranger his wife desired, Carl is him, and Marion is his wife Alice. It's fitting then that Kidman's character is named Alice, calling to mind Lewis Carroll's heroine in Through the Looking-Glass. But here it's Bill who goes through the mirror—in another slipstream, dreamlike quality of gender reversal. Alice in Wonderland (1865) and Through the Looking-Glass, and What Alice Found There (1871) are considered among the best examples of \"literary nonsense\". As defined in An Anatomy of Literary Nonsense (1988), it's a fiction subgenre that combines the logical with the illogical, balancing \"a multiplicity of meaning with a simultaneous absence of meaning\". Elements of literary nonsense \"are primarily those of negativity or mirroring, imprecision or mixture, infinite repetition, simultaneity, and arbitrariness\" (47). These descriptions apply incredibly well to EWS. In this segment, Bill steps through the looking-glass, and from then on much if not all of the story takes place in a nonsensical dreamworld. Inside the mirror of his wife's disclosed fantasy, Bill's internal landscape, his emotional state of jealousy and sexual guilt, are reflected externally.\n\nThe tilted way this scene mirrors Alice's fantasy serves the film's enigmatic quality, giving us something to decipher and contemplate. The clues are there, but Kubrick skews elements just enough so that it isn't all obvious at first glance. Only close inspection reveals that Nathanson's bedroom wallpaper and the Harfords' bedroom curtains have the same fleur-de-lis pattern. Richardson is eight years older than Kidman, has a Swedish accent, and other than both having blonde hair they share only a mild resemblance. Likewise Gibson resembles Cruise somewhat but not enormously. Near-exact parallels abound throughout the film, but exact parallels aren't immediately apparent. After Bill returns home from the mansion, Alice describes herself as having a dream in which many men are \"fucking\" her. At the mansion, many men are fucking many women, though Bill himself doesn't engage sexually—so here, in a way, Alice has become a character in Bill's fantasy, filtered through her own dream, just as he becomes a character in her fantasy, filtered through his dream.\n\nAnother noteworthy element of the Nathanson scene is the presence of the recently deceased old man lying on the bed throughout. The character's last name is a possible allusion to the aforementioned Nathan Hale, a Yale graduate and spy recruited by George Washington during the American Revolution for independence from the British. Hale was hanged after being caught undercover across enemy lines in New York City; the same city where EWS's Bill likewise becomes kind of a spy who goes undercover into hostile territory when he sneaks into the mansion in disguise. Naming Bill's wealthy patient Nathanson is another connection to power hierarchies—in this case to historical colonial conflicts, and Yale, the birthplace of Skull and Bones and an institution of the wealthy.\n\nThe name Nathan also links to the Rothschild family; there were several Nathan Rothschilds over several generations, including Louis Nathaniel de Rothschild, Lionel Nathan de Rothschild, and Nathan Mayer Rothschild—who was once the wealthiest man on earth. It was this latter Nathan's son, Mayer Amschel de Rothschild, who commissioned the building of Mentmore Towers, which serves as the exterior of the Somerton mansion in EWS. Bill's patient Lou Nathanson has just died, and later that night he goes to a mansion built by Nathan's son—the son of the wealthiest man on earth.\n\nAt the mansion Bill is confronted by a masked master of ceremonies credited as \"Red Cloak\", who sits on a throne ornamented with what appears to be a two-headed eagle, or possibly a two-headed snake—it's not entirely clear, but both have relevance. The double-headed eagle is an ancient iconographic symbol dating back some 5,000 years, spanning a variety of cultures throughout the world; from Mesopotamia to the Byzantine Empire, and beyond. It has also been used as an emblem by the Scottish Rite of Freemasonry, a system of degrees employed by Freemasons, signifying the title \"Grand Inspector\".\n\nIn Egyptian mythology, the double-headed serpent is a creature named Neheb Ka who binds parts of the soul—the ka and ba—together after death. Ancient Egyptians believed the ka—meaning \"double\"—and ba—\"personality\"—exist alongside the physical human body. Neheb Ka guards the entrance to the underworld Duat, depicted in ancient Egyptian artworks as a \"doubleworld\" represented by the hieroglyph of a five-pointed star inside a circle—like the decorative stars in EWS. The glyphs in the name Neheb Ka resemble a double-headed snake, so it was portrayed as such, referring to the spiritual double of a person that leaves their body upon death—the vital essence which distinguishes a living body from a dead one (The Ancient Gods Speak, 181). The surname of the actor who plays Red Cloak, Leon Vitali, means \"life\" in Latin (Latin and English Dictionary, 452). Vitali played a role in Kubrick's Barry Lyndon before becoming his personal assistant and/or casting director on all his following films. In another case of meta-duality, Leon Vitali has the same birthday as Stanley Kubrick: July 26th—1948 and 1928, respectively.\n\nStanley Kubrick had a kind of real-life doppelgänger of his own. Alan Conway was a British conman who impersonated Kubrick for years throughout the 1990s, claiming to be the famous director in London's wealthy socialite circles in order to gain favours, free hotel rooms, dinners, drinks, etc. By this time the real Kubrick had long withdrawn from media attention, so Conway succeeded in fooling many—including some film critics who contacted Warner Brothers to set up an interview with this \"Kubrick\". Warner Bros already knew of the scam but had been unable to identify the impostor, and Stanley Kubrick himself was then apprised of the situation by his lawyer. Kubrick was said to have been fascinated by the idea. His wife Christiane was less impressed, as she reflected in a 2005 interview with The Guardian: \"It was an absolute nightmare. This strange doppelgänger who was pretending to be Stanley. Can you imagine the horror?\"\n\nConway was tracked down by an assistant to Kubrick, Anthony Frewin, who then detailed the whole affair in a screenplay for what became the movie Color Me Kubrick (2005), wherein John Malkovich plays Conway posing as Kubrick. The movie was directed by Brian W. Cook, who had worked as assistant director on Barry Lyndon and The Shining, and as a producer and assistant director on Eyes Wide Shut—and appears in it as Somerton's \"Tall Butler\". Alan Conway died of a heart attack three months before Stanley Kubrick died, also of a heart attack.\n\nTWINSHIP & NAMES\n\nKubrick's interest in twinship has been evident since his directorial debut, the documentary short Day of the Fight (1951). The 12-minute film follows a middleweight boxer on the day of a match, accompanied by his identical twin brother. Kubrick's Lolita features Peter Sellers playing two different characters in \"twin\" roles of a sort—and the film's protagonist has a twinned name, Humbert Humbert. The Shining also famously features the ghosts of twin girls. And Eyes Wide Shut has countless instances of duality and twinning.\n\nAt Ziegler's party, Bill flirts with two women, one of whom is introduced as Nuala Windsor. The name Nuala means \"beautiful\", a fairy queen in Irish mythology (Celtic Names, 117). And Windsor identifies with the Royal Family of the United Kingdom, the House of Windsor, where bloodlines of the elite still hold power to this day. The other woman says her name is Gayle. But Nuala sounds American while Gayle has a British accent, in another example of slipstream characteristic-swapping and US/New York–UK/London couplings. Gayle is a variant of Gail, shortened from the English Abigail, with Hebrew origins; an Old Testament character whose wealthy husband dies, and she remarries a king (Dictionary of First Names, 1)—so, a woman of high status. The actress who plays \"Mysterious Woman\" (voiced by an uncredited Cate Blanchett) at the mansion/Mandy's double is named Abigail Good. Kubrick's daughter Vivian, a filmmaker and composer, has been credited under the pseudonym Abigail Mead. Gayle/Gail etymology also attributes the meaning as \"jovial\" or \"merry\", the same origin as the word \"gay\" which meant just that, before meaning homosexual. Kubrick chose to spell the character's name as Gayle and not Gail.\n\nGayle refers to previously meeting Bill \"on a very windy day\". A gale is a \"very strong wind\", in connection with Windsor. It is a very strong wind—a tornado—that whisks Dorothy Gale away to the fantasyland Oz. Gayle and Nuala attempt to lead Bill away from the party to \"where the rainbow ends\", and Dorothy Gale sings \"Over the Rainbow\" in the 1939 movie, where \"dreams that you dare to dream really do come true.\" Bill doesn't go with Gayle and Nuala, but he does go upstairs a moment later when summoned by Ziegler to tend to his dirty work. And he later goes to Rainbow Costume Rental, which is situated over a store called Under the Rainbow. Remember that Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard reportedly had a secret base in California codenamed Over the Rainbow? And Tom Cruise is a Scientologist. The connections continue.\n\nFurther intriguing examples of twinning, duality—and plurality—revolve around the character Marion. She only appears in that one scene; when Bill tries to reach her later, she's disappeared. This is a pattern, of people vanishing when Bill looks for them again on his second day out; Marion, Domino, Nick. Bill rebuffs Marion's advances just before her fiancé Carl arrives, and when Bill calls Marion's the next day, Carl answers the phone. And Bill hangs up. Carl is an alternate Bill and Marion an alternate Alice, so it's like Bill tries to call an alternate version of his wife, but she doesn't answer, and he hears himself pick up on the other side, but he doesn't want to talk to himself. Then maybe after Bill hangs up the phone, offscreen in the looking-glass world Carl says to Marion, \"I think I have to go over there and show my face,\" after she just finished confessing her fantasy to Carl, of running away with Doctor Bill. As if it's a dreamtime loop, and it was Carl who called Bill at home that night just as Bill now calls Carl. And it carries on, mise-en-abyme, into the abyss…\n\nThe character's name is Marion Nathanson, the actress's name is Marie Richardson; Marion is in fact a portmanteau of MARIe richardsON, as Harford is of HARrison FORD. The character's name in Traumnovelle is \"Marianne\". Tom Cruise's sister is also named Marian (with the variant spelling), and his mother is Mary. Nicole Kidman's middle name is Mary. Stanley Kubrick's sister was named Barbara Mary Kubrick. Marie Richardson acted in several Ingmar Bergman films—who Kubrick greatly admired—including her credit immediately prior to EWS, In the Presence of a Clown (1997), opposite a character also named Carl. And—curiously, in relation to female character names in EWS—among Marie Richardson's pre-EWS roles she played characters named Marianne (Marion), Elise (Alice), and Helena Hansson (Helena Harford).\n\nOne of the Yale punks slams into Bill as he walks by, and says, \"Merry Christmas, Mary!\"—mary being a homophobic slur, and sharing common etymology with merry. This of course connects to Christmas, Christianity, the biblical characters of the Virgin Mary mother of Jesus, and Mary Magdalene, and also evokes the Catholic Church's longstanding antigay stance. Amanda (Mandy) means \"lovable\" from the Latin amāre, \"to love\"—linking to the English merry and mary which some derivations also define as \"beloved, delightful\", from Hebrew, Syro-Aramaic, and Egyptian (Miriam, Miryam, Maryam), with variations in Celtic, French, Greek, Slavic (Meara, Marie, Maria). Other diminutive forms are: Mira, Miri, Mariah, Molly, and Polly (Dictionary of First Names, 13, and Celtic Names, 84). The name of the cat painting at the Harfords' is Polly (by Kubrick's daughter Katharina), which calls to mind a tiger stuffie on Domino's bed, the Pink Pussycat Boutique Bill passes on his walk, and the term \"sex kitten\". Polly becomes a nickname of Mary from Molly, and is also considered a nickname of Dorothy from Dolly. As in Dorothy Gale from Oz, which connects to Nick Nightingale, Gayle the model, Gay meaning \"merry\", Gayle rhymes with Yale, and the Yale punks accuse Bill of being gay.\n\nAlice became a popular girls' name due to Alice in Wonderland, from Old French and Germanic for \"noble\" (Dictionary of First Names, 3, 9). And Bill is shortened from William, with etymology rooted in the German Wilhelm; from wil meaning \"will, desire\" and helm meaning \"conceal, protect\", as in helmet (Dictionary, 276). So, Bill's full name William translates as \"conceal desire\". The name Victor Ziegler also has revelatory etymology. Victor is from the Latin for \"winner\" (Dictionary, 271). As a super-rich guy who has his way with everything, he's clearly a victor in this society. And Ziegler is from the German ziegelbrenner which means \"brick maker\" (German-English Dictionary, 291), connecting to freemasons and to \"Kubrick\". A mason is a builder or layer of stone, and Freemasonry as a secret society evolved out of organized bodies of stonemasons thousands of years ago. And the \"free\" part indicates that the mason is not enslaved. So, Victor Ziegler's name and character reflect a person at the top of the pyramid, a member of an ancient secret society of wealth and power-seekers. And Stanley itself also means \"stone\" (\"stan\"), plus \"wood\" (\"leigh\"; woods or a meadow) from Old English (Dictionary of First Names, 252).\n\nThe etymology of mason—\"one who works with stone\"—shares the same origins as the name Tom: from the Italian maso, shortened from Tomasso, which itself is from the Aramaic toma, which means \"twin\". The Anglicized form of Tomasso is Thomas; Tom Cruise, Tom Gibson, who have the exact same birthday, and play alternate reality versions of each other—their name means \"twin\", which shares the same root as the word \"mason\", which refers to freemasons, and means \"brick maker\", which translates from Ziegler. There is also a line of highly-sought-after Japanese-made collectible toy figurines called \"Kubrick Toys\", named after the director and launched in 2000, shortly after his death. Ku translates from Japanese as \"nine\", and each Kubrick figure (which resemble Lego figures), is made up of nine body parts that toy collectors call \"bricks\".\n\nZiegler was also the surname of the Nazi official in charge of confiscating anti-Nazi, Jewish, and/or protest art. Adolf Ziegler, said to be Hitler's favourite painter, was tasked by the Nazi Party to oversee the purging of what they termed \"degenerate art\"—and artists or museum/gallery owners who created or promoted it. Another Nazi official, Hans Severus Ziegler, was in charge of purging \"degenerate music\" and musicians. In EWS, Szavost mentions Victor Ziegler's wonderful art collection. Ziegler is played by Sydney Pollack, who was Jewish. And Ziegler is also the surname of EWS's Steadicam operator—Elizabeth Ziegler—who worked with Cruise again on his next film Magnolia (1999) in which he portrays a misogynistic motivational speaker instructing men on how to pick up women. Elizabeth Ziegler's camera \"eye\" following Bill around is like Victor Ziegler's henchmen following Bill around, watching him.\n\nPERIPHERALITY & PARALLELISM\n\nA multitude of details in the background, and foreground, continually reinforce the film's intersecting thematic elements. When Gayle reminds Bill they'd met before, he recalls, \"You had something in your eye\". She responds jokingly, \"about half of 5th Avenue\". The next night, Bill traverses what looks like an imagined rendering of New York City's Greenwich Village. Some establishing shots are of real locations in New York and England, but most of the street sets were constructed on Pinewood Studio soundstages in London, designed to resemble an alternate universe version of 1999 NYC. Various buildings and storefronts appear to change location throughout the movie, as do other objects. Outside the costume store the Gillespie's diner neon sign is visible behind Bill, which in the previous scene neighboured the Sonata Café. But Bill arrives at the costume store in a cab. It's like he's going in circles, wandering the same four- or five-block radius over and over, with elements repositioned upon each pass-through of Dreamcity. Maybe Bill's travelling across \"half of 5th Avenue\" over and over, because he now has \"half of 5th Avenue\" in his \"eye\"—that is, in his mind's eye.\n\nThe redressing of facades and reuse of set decoration in EWS was at least in part the result of an error in booking a lot that was smaller than Kubrick wanted at Pinewood Studios. How much Kubrick made conscious use of this due to budget and space economy, to enhance Bill's dreamlike, circular odyssey—as a creative improvisation—or how much was preplanned, or accidental, is up for debate. But the effect is nonetheless enchanting and fits with the film's mirroring and dream themes.\n\nLinkages between objects, characters, and dialogue occur throughout EWS from start to end. The very first shot shows Alice undressing in her apartment, and in the corner are two tennis rackets. A couple screentime minutes later, Bill and Alice are greeted by Victor Ziegler and his wife Illona at their house party, and Victor thanks Bill for recommending a medical specialist who fixed his tennis injury: \"That osteopath you sent me to, the guy that worked on my arm? You ought to see my serve now.\" On Ziegler's bathroom wall, above a naked Mandy lying down, is a painting of a naked woman lying down in a similar position, almost like a mirror. The woman in the painting appears to be pregnant, evoking the sex and fertility themes and pagan associations with Christmas. When Domino shows up selling sex, an XXX video store selling sex movies is visible behind her. And the Sonata Café's interior sphere lamps appear again in Sharkey's Café, but in reverse; Bill goes downstairs to enter the Sonata where the lamps are down low on the tables and facing upwards, and Bill goes upstairs to enter Sharkey's where the lamps are up high on the ceiling and facing downwards.\n\nCall-outs to Kubrick's life and work often come in the form of signs on buildings. The word BOWMAN is visible on one sign, as in Dave Bowman, the protagonist of 2001: A Space Odyssey. Another reads VITALI, as in Leon Vitali, Kubrick's longtime assistant and Red Cloak actor. And yet another sign reads Caffe da Emilio, as in Emilio D'Alessandro, Kubrick's chauffeur. And when Bill enters the hospital through glass doors, behind him the building address across the street is 238—one digit away from The Shining's famous hotel room 237.\n\nAt Milich's costume store, his teenaged daughter (Leelee Sobieski) whispers into Bill's ear: \"You should have a cloak lined with ermine\". Ermine fur was traditionally used for lining cloaks and crowns in coronation ceremonies, so is associated with high-ranking officials and royalty. If the Milich girl is Bill's fantasy character, then her whispers show his desire to be seen as a man of high status. In other words, Bill wants women to regard him as a king. In heraldry, a \"fur\" is an official pattern and colour palette used in the design of crests. An ermine's fur changes colour seasonally, turning all white with black tail tips during winter, so the ermine heraldic fur has a white background with various black shapes, to represent the animal's winter coat. Domino wears a fake fur coat of white with black stripes, and \"domino\" game tiles are black and white. Ironically, for such a colourful film Eyes Wide Shut has many references to \"black and white\".\n\nBlack-and-white title sequences begin and end the film; EYES WIDE SHUT appears in white text on black background at the start, and THE END in white text on black background at the end, bookending the lushly coloured story within. In their bedroom, Bill says to Alice, \"I don't think it's quite that black and white\"—while he's wearing only black underwear and she's wearing only white underwear. On his night walk, Bill passes the lingerie store Pink Pussycat Boutique which has two headless mannequin torsos—a male in black underwear and a female in white underwear— in the display window. Bill's imaginings of Alice having sex with the naval officer are in black and white. Nick Nightingale plays a piano with black-and-white keys. Nick wears a white suit jacket and Bill wears a black one. Two mannequins in the Rainbow Costumes display window wear the same suits that Bill and Nick do. The Nathansons' housekeeper Rosa wears a black dress with a white collar, and Bill wears a black suit with a white collar—both servants to the rich. For most of the movie Bill is dressed in black; on his late night outings he wears a black suit and tie and white shirt, a black overcoat, black boots, and black gloves. A skewed film noir antihero (film noir meaning \"black film\"), the man in black, descending into the shadow realm.\n\nScenes of Bill in taxicabs at night have cut-out, rear-projected backgrounds whizzing by outside, like in old movies—as if he's driving through his own imagined dreamworld. There's the shot of Bill walking down the street facing the camera, when he smacks his hands together, in which he appears to be superimposed in front of the nighttime cityscape background—which is indeed the case, as behind-the-scenes photos show Cruise walking on a treadmill in front of a screen. He looks like a cutout, and he is, his surroundings visibly manufactured, as if he's not really even there. Shots like this remind us we're watching a movie, as if announcing that it's the Hollywood celebrity Tom Cruise playing a role. So again, is this film about the sexualization of movie stars, about using sex to sell movies?\n\nIn addition to Yale's relevance to Skull and Bones and the CIA, the Yale students who accost Bill are reminiscent of the Clockwork Orange hoodlums. They also represent a younger Bill and Nick when they attended medical school together. Remember how thrilled they are to run into each other at Ziegler's party after ten years? They enthusiastically hand-shake and back-slap and man-hug with an immediate college frat bro-like camaraderie and good ol' boy intimacy, as if recalling those debaucherous days back in college. Bill running into the Yale students is like running into a younger version of himself, the memory of he and Nick as college students projected onto his environment.\n\nWhat we hear the Yale guys say before they direct their attention to Bill: \"…my face! She had a red rose in her mouth. She was doing a Mexican lap dance right in my face. I'm serious. I've got scars on the back of my neck!\" This reflects things that appear onscreen moments before as Bill walks the streets: he passes a Mexican Restaurant \"Conchita's\", which links as well to the cartoon playing on TV at Bill and Alice's; The Fright Before Christmas featuring the Mexican mouse Speedy Gonzalez. The college kid sees Bill and says, \"Hey, hey, hey, what team's this switch hitter playing for? Looks like the pink team. Faggot!\" Bill had just walked past the \"Pink Pussycat Boutique\"—and also past a flower shop named \"Nipped in the Bud\" with a rose logo on its door sign, and twin red rose neon lights, one in each window on either side of the door.\n\nThere are several instances of flower-related imagery in EWS. Szavost wears a five-petaled dark blue flower pin on his lapel, and Sally's skirt has a five-petaled flower pattern. Nathanson's bedroom wallpaper and the Harfords' bedroom curtains have the same fleur-de-lis pattern (\"flower of the lily\"). There are potted plants with red flowers in Nathanson's lobby, and red flowers in the bedroom. Red flowers in vases are visible in the Harfords' apartment, as is a painting of red flowers, and roses are painted on their bed's headboard. The rose is a yonic symbol, and Bill's sexual attempts are repeatedly \"nipped in the bud\". The Latin version of the name Marion means \"rose petal\". Actress Mariana Hewitt plays the Nathansons' housekeeper Rosa (from Spanish, Italian), who links to the Harfords' babysitter Roz (from Polish). Both Rosa and Roz are in servant roles with names derived from the same meaning: rose.\n\nInside the flower shop are bouquets of red flowers, Christmas lights, and a Santa Claus statuette looking out at Bill. Outside, a man and woman are leaning against the store kissing; the man is all in black, like Bill, and the woman wears a plush white coat and red pants—Santa Claus/Christmas colours. The Saint Nick statuette overlooking the scene connects with Nick Nightingale, and also with Nicole Kidman, who Cruise would often refer to as \"Nic\" in interviews at the time.\n\nAfter taunting Bill with a few more demeaning remarks and mocking his sexuality, the punks' last discernible line is \"Go back to San Francisco where you belong, man!\" Besides the obvious connection of San Fran's reputation as an epicenter of gay rights, it also evokes Saint Francis, after whom the city is named. Francis was, among other things, associated with birds, and Bill speaks with at least one \"bird\", Mr. Nightingale, who whispers a secret in his ear… The homophobic slurs reflect Bill's insecurity about his manhood and sexuality, and also refer to Tom Cruise himself and the real-life rumours popular at the time that he was secretly gay. Alan Cumming's scene as the hotel clerk, with his overt homosexual flirtations with Bill, further invoke the \"Tom Cruise is gay\" gossip. Kubrick riddles EWS with in-jokes, blurring boundaries between reality and fiction.\n\nThere's lots of interesting stuff about that newspaper Bill reads. The article about Amanda Curran states she had modelled for, and was rumoured to have had an affair with, \"London fashion designer Leon Vitali\". The real name of the actor who plays Red Cloak is in the fake prop newspaper in the movie. The diner's name Gillespie's means \"bishop's servant\" (Celtic Names, 231). Is Red Cloak the bishop and Mandy the servant? Or is Bill the servant? The newspaper article linking Mandy to Vitali implies she had a relationship with Red Cloak—and we know she had one with Ziegler—hinting that Red Cloak and Ziegler are conjoined psychological archetypes. The two men are also linked by Red Cloak's red carpet and Ziegler's red pool table. And the masked Mysterious Woman is played by a different actress than Mandy, even though it's said to be her. Doubling everywhere.\n\nFidelio is Beethoven's only opera, and the masquerade ball's password in EWS. It's an Italian male name meaning \"fidelity, faithfulness\"—especially sexual faithfulness to a spouse. The opera's original title was The Triumph of Married Love, featuring the female protagonist Leonore (in connection with Leon Vitali, Lisa Leone) who disguises herself as a man named Fidelio in order to rescue her husband from a political prison. The name Leonore is French for \"shining light\", appropriate to EWS's lights motif. The mansion's Mysterious Woman who sacrifices herself to save Bill—supposedly Mandy in a mask—is like Leonore risking her life to save her husband by masquerading as Fidelio. Mysterious Woman and Leonore also identify with Alice who, in her own dream as she recounts it to Bill, is in an orgy scenario \"fucking all these men\". But Alice laughs at Bill in her dream, while in his—if the mansion scene is indeed Bill's dream—she sacrifices herself to save him.\n\nROSEMARY & ROMAN\n\nThere is so much in Eyes Wide Shut that I didn't initially notice, whether in the etymology of character names and the actors playing them, the mise-en-scène, colour correspondence, or other visual and aural cues. But deeper examination opens up a world of parallels that now seem too obvious too ignore, to the point I wonder how I ever could've missed them in the first place. One such example is what may be a Kubrickian reference to the film Rosemary's Baby, with the conspicuous appearance of a baby buggy in EWS's toy store scene. The antique-looking stroller indeed closely resembles the iconic Rosemary's Baby carriage from the 1968 movie and its posters.\n\nRosemary's Baby is a psychological horror film written and directed by Roman Polanski, starring Mia Farrow. It was adapted from a novel by Ira Levin, who also wrote The Stepford Wives (1972), about brainwashed housewives, which was likewise adapted into a movie (1975) and later remade (2004) starring none other than Nicole Kidman. Rosemary's Baby features a bourgeois American couple living on Central Park West in Manhattan's Upper West Side—like Bill and Alice—who literally conceive the devil's offspring for a satanic cult in order to secure higher social status. On a cinematic side note to EWS, the 1993 thriller The Firm—directed by Sydney Pollack—also stars a paranoid Tom Cruise character who is in over his head with a seemingly all-powerful cult of sorts.\n\nLike EWS, Rosemary's Baby involves perception and paranoia and there are times in both films when it feels as if much of what we're seeing is allegorical, projections from the minds of each protagonist, Bill and Rosemary. And both movies explore themes of misogyny, sexual abuse, and the sexual autonomy of women. Given the similarities—including with the names Rose and Mary as described earlier—it’s quite possible that EWS's baby carriage is Kubrick's intentional nod to Rosemary's Baby. In the 1980 Michel Ciment interview about The Shining, he asked Kubrick, \"What kind of horror films do you like? Did you see Rosemary's Baby?\" To which Kubrick replied, \"It was one of the best of the genre.\"\n\nA year after Rosemary's Baby debuted, Polanski's actress wife Sharon Tate was murdered by a group of mostly female Charles Manson cult followers who reportedly practised satanic worship. In 1977, Polanski was scandalized and fled the US to Europe (where he remains in exile to this day) following his arrest at age 43 for the rape of a 13-year-old model at Jack Nicholson's house, though Nicholson wasn't there at the time. Polanski's first film following the incident was Tess (1979), adapted from Thomas Hardy's novel Tess of the d'Urbervilles (1891), about a young peasant girl raped by a wealthy nobleman. Soon after, Jack Nicholson starred in Kubrick's The Shining, and was previously in Polanski's Chinatown (1974), which is also about, among other things, a rich old man raping his daughter.\n\nThemes common in Roman Polanski's life and works parallel those in EWS. Rape. Murder. Cults. Rich old men preying on very young women. Polanski's later wife, actress Emmanuelle Seigner, was 22 when she married the 55-year-old Polanski. Mia Farrow was married to Frank Sinatra at the time she was in Rosemary's Baby; she was 21 and he was 50 when they wed, and divorced within two years. Farrow later married filmmaker Woody Allen, only to also divorce him and accuse him of molesting her adopted daughter Soon-Yi Previn, who Allen later married—when she was 26 and he was 61. Another adopted daughter of both Farrow and Allen, Dylan Farrow, accused him of molesting her when she was 7. Allen was never convicted or sentenced, but was legally denied custody rights. Then in 2013, another of their adopted children, Moses Farrow, announced that he'd been physically assaulted by Mia, and defended Allen. Soon-Yi Previn also publicly defended Allen in 2018. One of Farrow and Allen's biological children, investigative journalist Ronan Farrow, published articles in The New Yorker in 2017-2018 that exposed sexual assault allegations against movie mogul Harvey Weinstein, CBS executive Les Moonves, and the United States president Donald Trump.\n\nKubrick was a big fan of Allen's work, particularly Husbands and Wives (costarring Sydney Pollack, 1992), Annie Hall (1977), and Manhattan (1979)—a black-and-white comedy about a 42-year-old man dating a 17-year-old girl. On a strange side note in connection to EWS, Allen's best friend in the movie is the character \"Yale Pollack\". At one point Kubrick considered casting Allen in the lead role of EWS, which is also set in Manhattan and features young women with older men. According to Stanley's brother-in-law Jan Harlan (who executive-produced Kubrick's last four films, as well as A.I., and directed the 2001 documentary Stanley Kubrick: A Life in Pictures) in a 2014 Sight & Sound interview:\n\nThere are numerous instances in EWS of old men with young women/girls: Sandor Szavost and Alice—he's some 25 years older than her. Ziegler and Mandy—he's almost 40 years older than her. Milich's associates with his daughter—she's 15 and they're in their fifties. And Kubrick directed Lolita, about a man in his fifties who is obsessed with a 14-year-old girl. A lot surrounding Rosemary's Baby very readily relates to common Kubrick themes of power and misogyny.\n\nThis all gets into EWS's darkest aspects; sexual abuse of women. Remember how the shirtless Ziegler is still zipping up his pants in front of a passed-out Mandy when Bill enters the room? And how inconvenienced and irritated he is when Bill says she should stay there for another hour to recover from her overdose when Ziegler wants to shuffle her out the backdoor right away? And darker still; pedophilia and the sexualization of children. The costume store owner Mr. Milich prostituting his daughter is the most blatant example. With the Lewis Carroll linkages, it's also mentionable there have been allegations he was a pedophile, having painted nude portraits of female children. And with the Catholic Church's systemic child sexual abuse, religious allusions in EWS are also disturbingly relevant. It all invokes conspiracy theories about child trafficking and prostitution rings run by powerful elites, the world's wealthiest criminals. Accounts of the CIA's MKUltra mind control program describe experiments that involved psychological, physical, and sexual abuse—but whether children were used is disputed and controversial.\n\nEyes Wide Shut is now twenty-years-old, but the serious themes it explores remain relevant to our time, with the MeToo and Time'sUp movements exposing sexual assault and predation by men in high positions of authority. The newspaper article about Mandy states \"her agent\" notified hotel security when she didn't answer the phone; is Ziegler her agent, à la Harvey Weinstein? Bill refers to the two women at the party as \"models\"… This all brings me to another key female character in EWS who I haven't discussed yet: Bill and Alice's daughter Helena Harford.\n\nHELENA, MARIE, & MARIE-HÉLÈNE\n\nHelena is a form of Helen, of Greek origin, meaning \"light\" or \"shining bright\" in fitting with the lights motif in EWS—and like Fidelio's protagonist Leonore, from French meaning \"shining light\". The name Helena is most famously from the character Helen of Troy in Greek mythology. Considered the most beautiful woman in the world, Helen of Troy is said to have \"launched a thousand ships\", as men started wars for her affections. As the story goes, Helen was a queen who left her monarch husband for a Trojan man named Paris. Some accounts describe it as an elopement, as Helen being equally in love with Paris as he was with her, while other versions describe it as an abduction wherein Paris took Helen against her will (Dictionary of Classical Mythology, 119, 193).\n\nSome etymologists link Helen of Troy to \"sun goddess\" legends, and the story of her elopement or abduction by Paris as relating to \"marriage drama\" myths of ancient Indo-European cultures. The Old Greek spelling of her name has a \"v\" to possibly represent Venus—the goddess of love, beauty, desire, sex, seduction, fertility—suggesting Helen and Venus share common mythological origins and they both represent aspects of femininity. This connects again to the eight-pointed Star of Venus that appears as Christmas decoration in EWS, and the painting of goddess Astarte, the Semitic equivalent to Venus.\n\nVenus is very much involved in Helen of Troy's story; she granted Paris the love of the most beautiful woman on Earth, Helen, if he would proclaim that she, Venus, was the most beautiful goddess in all the universe. Paris did so and then ran off with Helen, which started the Trojan War. Duality is displayed again in this story of Helen and Venus—a human woman and a goddess, one the most beautiful on Earth, the other the most beautiful in the Heavens. Themes of twinning and pairing prominent in EWS are reflected throughout many tales of twinship in Greek mythology. Helen had a twin sister Clytemnestra, and they had another pair of half-brother twins named Gemini. So, Helen of Troy is a pair of pairs, linking to the duality embodied through the character Helena Harford; she has double-H initials, her father is played by an actor whose name means \"twin\", and there's another character named Illona—the Hungarian version of Helena—the same name.\n\nHelen of Troy relates to another Greek myth, The Tale of Cupid and Psyche, which many modern fairy tales are rooted in. It's been portrayed in various media, from poetry to paintings to popular culture, with Cupid imagery on everything from wallpaper to greeting cards. Cupid is commonly depicted today as a winged cherub equipped with a bow and arrows—anyone struck by his arrow will fall in love. In EWS, a statue of Cupid and Psyche can be seen at the bottom of the staircase in Ziegler's house, a Cupid card hangs in Domino's apartment, another Cupid card is visible in Bill's office, and Helena Harford wears a winged fairy costume at the film's opening.\n\nCupid, meaning \"desire\", was the Roman god of love, desire, and eroticism. His Greek counterpart is Eros, which is also a word on a sign behind Bill outside the costume store, and the origin of \"erotic\". Cupid was the son of Venus (Aphrodite, in Greek)—goddess of love, passion, sex—and Mars (Ares), god of war; an analogy, perhaps, for the extremes of human behaviour; love and war, creation and destruction. Psyche is from the Greek for \"life\" or \"breath\", with derivative meanings \"soul\", \"spirit\", and \"self\". In psychology the psyche is the totality of the human mind, conscious and unconscious. Psyche was a princess of stunning beauty, herself said to be the second coming of Venus. She became Cupid's wife, and mother of their daughter Hedone (meaning \"pleasure\", in Greek), also known as Voluptas (\"pleasure\", in Latin) who was herself the goddess of sensual pleasure. The English word \"hedonism\" is derived from Hedone, and \"voluptuous\" from Voluptas. The themes of The Tale of Cupid and Psyche center on love, lust, sex, and death.\n\nWritten in the 2nd century (circa 158-170 A.D.) by Platonist philosopher Lucius Apuleius, The Tale of Cupid and Psyche is an episode in his most famous work Metamorphoses. The protagonist and narrator is named Lucius, establishing the story's framework through the eyes of a fictional version of the writer Lucius Apuleius himself, which is a little like Bill/Cruise—an actor playing a character that mocks his real-life image. Most remarkably, just as the mansion scene occurs in the exact middle of EWS, The Tale of Cupid and Psyche occurs in the midpoint of the novel Metamorphoses. As a structural mirror of the overarching plot, it's an example of mise-en-abyme, a complex narrative frame of a story within a story, like EWS and its mirror structure endlessly reflecting aspects of itself.\n\nThe Cupid and Psyche story alludes to \"mystery religions\" which were a kind of early cult involving \"initiates\" called mystai (mystics). At the end of Metamorphoses, the character Lucius finds salvation by joining the mystery cult of Isis. Lucius Apuleius was himself an initiate of several cults and mystery religions, and was once accused of using magic to seduce a wealthy widow. Mystery has origins in the French mistere (\"secret, hidden meaning\"—and in a theological sense, \"hidden spiritual significance, religious truth\"), Latin mysterium (\"secret rite, secret worship\"), and Greek mystērion (\"secret doctrine, secret ceremony\"). In etymological relation, mystic comes from the Greek \"to shut the eyes and mouth, in secrecy\", to be initiated into the \"mystery revelation\" (Oxford Dictionary of English Etymology, 307). It all sounds similar to what Bill experiences at the secret mansion party; before going there he asks Nick, \"What's the big mystery?\" In this context of the ancient initiatory rites of the pagan mysteries, EWS is about mysteries. And the movie itself might qualify as an anti-mystery, because nothing is answered with certainty.\n\nDated about 150 years before Apuleius' Metamorphoses is another classic Latin literary work also entitled Metamorphoses (8 A.D.) by Roman poet Ovid. Considered his masterwork, it's an epic narrative poem of 250 myths. At Ziegler's party, Sandor Szavost attempts to seduce Alice by citing Ovid's The Art of Love. When she tells him she's married, he replies that in ancient times women got married because it was the only way to be free to sleep with other men. Really? I thought legal marriage evolved as a property contract for men to secure their wealth succession and lineage by having women bear them offspring. The word \"woman\" in fact comes from the Old English wifman, from wife of man (Oxford Dictionary of English Etymology, 544). Two ancient books connected to EWS—a movie with mirroring and duality themes—have identical titles: Metamorphoses and Metamorphoses. Coincidentally, the famous story The Metamorphosis was written by Franz Kafka, whose work Kubrick adored. A contemporary of Arthur Schnitzler, Sigmund Freud, and Carl Jung, Kafka (born 1883) shares a birthday with Tom Cruise—July 3rd. Bill undergoes a metamorphosis of sorts, doesn't he?\n\nHelena plays with the baby buggy in the toyshop, and a baby stroller is visible on the landing of Domino's building, seemingly abandoned in the corner outside of her apartment—which links Helena and Domino. Also in the toy store, tiger stuffies fill a shelf behind Alice—of the same sort as one seen on Domino's bed, linking the two of them. This all invokes the possibility that not only is Domino some kind of alternate version of Bill's wife Alice, but also of his daughter Helena; the same characters transposed in alternate, imagined timelines. And Domino's roommate Sally resembles what Helena might look like in twenty years or so, with their freckles and red hair. Is this perhaps part of Bill's sexual hesitancy with Domino, and Sally? Maybe they represent a future Helena, a possible fate that Bill has been complicit in by his unconscious contribution to capitalism and misogyny. Milich prostituting his young daughter is another version. And Ziegler's wife is named Illona, an alternate Helena. Domino is a prostitute, and Illona is the wife of a super-rich guy who routinely has sex with prostitutes. And Helena is the daughter of Bill, a somewhat rich guy who thinks he wants to have sex with prostitutes, but doesn't.\n\nIn further connection to Helen/Helena, and to Marie/Marion: Marie-Hélène de Rothschild was a wealthy socialite and member of the Rothschild family, who died in 1996 around the time EWS was in early stages of production. Her paternal grandmother was Baroness Hélène de Rothschild. The most notable Rothschild reference in EWS is that the UK's Mentmore Towers, which serves as the Somerton mansion, was built in the 1850s by the son of Nathan Rothschild. Bill's patient is Nathanson. The Rothschilds' extravagant parties have been documented, including a masquerade ball that Marie-Hélène held at another Rothschild mansion called Château de Ferrières, in France. It was built just after Mentmore for another family member—Baron James de Rothschild—who, upon seeing his cousin's impressive mansion told the architect, \"Build me a Mentmore, but twice the size\" (The Rothschilds: A Family of Fortune). Marie-Hélène took over the mansion in 1959, refurbished it, and it soon became the epicenter for European high society, with visitors including everyone from royalty to Hollywood celebrities.\n\nMarie-Hélène's party was called the \"Surrealist Ball\", and while it wasn't a massive sex orgy (at least not as popularly reported), it does have numerous eerie parallels to EWS too similar to be ignored. It was held on December 12th, 1972—the Christmas season. The invitations were printed backwards, only legible if held up to a mirror; backwards text and inversion of traditional symbols are common occult practises. When Bill enters the mansion, the music composition heard is \"Backwards Priests\", a Romanian Orthodox liturgy played in reverse. Marie-Hélène's party guests were required to attend in costume"
