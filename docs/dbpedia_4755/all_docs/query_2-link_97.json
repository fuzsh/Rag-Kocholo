        "text": "This is one of those episodes that makes me wonder how much TV from 50 years ago reflected reality and how much was a whitewashing — literally and figuratively — of the world.\n\nIt is 5 days until Camp Lakeside opens and the owner Mr. Stern is working his staff like a slavedriver except they are white, getting paid, not being beaten, and allowed to read and marry. When ceramics teacher Bernie Samuelson shows up, it is clear they are old friends.\n\nStern points out Lefty James down by the lake painting the diving platform. In a bizarre scene, Stern loudly yells to Lefty, “SAY HELLO TO TO BERNIE SAMUELSON . . . SAM–UEL–SON . . . CER–AM–ICS!” The freakishly buff Lefty is holding a can of paint in one hand and waves with the other still holding a paintbrush. Stern admiringly says Lefty was once in a Tarzan movie and they watch as he does a swan dive into the lake. Why the long-distance introduction? Why the over-enunciated yelling? Why the, frankly, homo-erotic shot of Lefty? Why the sudden dive when he was painting one second before? Did he seal the can? Did he wash the brushes? Did he eat in the last 30 minutes?\n\nStern says he knows Bernie’s background as a sculptor and “I think you will agree that ceramics have taken a large step forward here at Camp Lakeside.” Stern’s goal is for the kids to produce something to show the parents.\n\nOn Bernie’s first day with the kids — and WTF was he doing for the interim 5 days? — his bunch of young boys are not paying attention as he demonstrates a pottery wheel. In another sign of how times have changed, it seems a little creepy that 1) he is 10 years older than you expect in a camp counselor, 2) he puts hands on their shoulders as he steers each to his chair, and 3) he explains that camp policy is for the boys to call him Uncle Bernie. There is no hint of anything amiss. As I said, just a sad sign of our cynical times.\n\nOn the boys’ first day, they mold clay into such challenging shapes as a snake, a pancake, an ashtray, and a fabulous sculpture of a man, made by the titular Aaron Gold. Over the next few days, Aaron skips some of the other camp activities to seriously work on his sculpture. Bernie is impressed with Aaron’s attitude and skill, although the figure is still deficient in arms to the tune of one.\n\nStern is not seeing the value in Aaron’s sculpture. He says by Parent’s Day, Bernie and Aaron better have something to show and it better have an even number of arms. Aaron says his father will not care if he only has one sculpture as long as it is beautiful. And it will take as long as it takes.\n\nThat night, Stern comes by to inspect the ceramics projects. Half of them seem to be ashtrays. What did campers make when people stopped smoking? Maybe that’s why there aren’t many camps any more. Then maybe that lack of socialization, outdoor activities and discipline led to the disgraceful millennial generation. I might pick up a carton of Luckys tonight just to get the US back on track.\n\nStern is critical of Aaron. He has only an unfinished sculpture to show for Parent’s Day. He did not earn the Intermediate Dolphin Swimming Badge, the Woodcraft Badge or a Softball Stripe. Since Aaron’s father owns a chain of grocery stores, Stern wants to keep him happy. He orders Bernie to put an arm on Aaron’s sculpture.\n\nThe next morning, Aaron is crushed to see that Bernie has added an arm holding a sword to the figure. It is obvious why when his father shows up and HE IS AN MONSTER!!! At least, that’s how it feels. Mr. Gold arrives at the Ceramics Tent and the camera zooms in on the right sleeve of his jacket which is neatly folded, pinned to his shoulder and empty as a Bill & Hillary 2020 Speaking Tour. Not only does the camera zoom in, but the shot freezes, and the orchestra swells. Buster Bluth was treated with more respect.\n\nBarry Gordon, who was so good in The Day of the Bullet, turns in another fantastic performance as Aaron. He carved out a too-brief, two-episode AHP niche as the bestest, most loving son a father could ever have. In his previous appearance, his father let him down and he was crushed. Even though this episode ended abruptly, it was clear that their beautiful father-son bond would survive this awkwardness. I could imagine his old man graciously accepting Bernie’s apology, loving the sculpture, grabbing a burger at the cookout, tossing some horseshoes, and rowing round and round in circles on the lake.\n\nOther Stuff:"
