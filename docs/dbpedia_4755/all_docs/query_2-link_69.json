        "text": "award presented annually by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, located in Beverly Hills, California. It honours outstanding achievement by a director in a movie from a given year, as determined by the academy’s voting members. At the first Academy Awards ceremony in 1929, the award recognized the work in films from 1927–28, and it was offered in two categories: drama and comedy. However, the two Oscars were subsequently combined into one award that covered all genres. In addition, beginning with the seventh ceremony (1935), only work in movies released the previous year was eligible for consideration. The winning directors are given a gold-plated statuette known as an Oscar.\n\nJohn Ford has won the most Academy Awards for best director (four), and Frank Capra and William Wyler each have received three. Other notable recipients include Kathryn Bigelow, who is the first woman to earn the award (2010), and Chloé Zhao, the first director of color to win (2021). Below is a list of the winning directors and the films for which they won. The year is when the award was presented."
