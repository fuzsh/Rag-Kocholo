        "text": "Would you like to read with me?\n\nOne of my earliest, happiest memories is when I discovered that I could read and write. I was five years old, kneeling in a patch of sunlight on the floor of our playroom, and I spelled out r-o-c-k on the chalkboard. I felt a whole world open to me in that moment. I wanted to know things, and books could help me. They could teach me information, such as about animals and illnesses (I wanted to be a veterinarian or doctor). But they could also teach me wisdom, because through books I could both live and observe other lives. Feeling the feelings of the characters and making meaning with them expanded me. Having a bird’s eye view of the story helped me to understand life in general and my life in particular.\n\nThis search for wisdom, meaning, and growth is the through line that connects my love of literature with my work as a coach. So, I thought, why not invite clients and friends to do a book club?\n\nWe’ll read books that hold a mirror up to life, where everything is believable, the observations are true, and the writing is artful. That means literary fiction, old and new, featuring terrific heroines, and extraordinary nonfiction, that helps you to be a heroine.\n\nWe’ll treat this book club as an ongoing series of reads – we won’t necessarily meet every month, and you don’t have to read every book in the series. Join according to your interest and your schedule. Once you register, you can download my reader’s guide to the book.\n\nInterested?

In desperate need of a home but without the means to buy one, she did something incredible.\n\nEquipped only with YouTube instructional videos, a small bank loan and a mile-wide stubborn streak, Cara built her own house from the foundation up with a work crew made up of her four children.\n\nIt would be the hardest thing she had ever done. With no experience nailing together anything bigger than a bookshelf, she and her kids poured concrete, framed the walls and laid bricks for their two story, five-bedroom house. She had convinced herself that if they could build a house, they could rebuild their broken family.\n\nThis must-read memoir traces one family’s rise from battered victims to stronger, better versions of themselves, all through one extraordinary do-it-yourself project.\n\nSunday, September 8, 2024\n\n2-3:30pm CT\n\nOut of Africa\n\nby Isek Dinesen\n\n“I had a farm in Africa, but I did not own it – the land owned me.”\n\n– Isak Dinesen (Karen Blixen), Out of Africa\n\nI watched the film adaptation of this story when it was released in theaters in 1985, and that line completely hooked me. I was immediately swept up in Sydney Pollack’s lush film of Karen Blixen’s romantic story of tragic love with a dashing pilot and a beloved adopted country. Blixen struck me as a heroine: strong, determined, and sensitive, too. I thought her story would fit our criteria for the Heroines Book Club – and prompt me\n\nfinally to read it!\n\nBy the way, my favorite way to enjoy a book that has been adapted for film is to watch the film first and then read the book. When I read the book first, the film always disappoints. But if I watch the film first, I can enjoy it on its own terms and then enjoy the book even more, because it’s like an enhanced version of the film. Win/win!\n\nExpecting Adam\n\nby Martha Beck\n\nExpecting Adam is a memoir that chronicles the heroine’s journey Martha Beck never intended to make.\n\nShe was an ambitious young scholar at Harvard, aligned with its values of intellectualism and academic achievement, and believed that would be her life. But then she found herself pregnant with a child with Down’s syndrome. Such a child did not have value in that system, and she was encouraged to abort. What she ended up aborting was the Harvard value system and embracing Adam, the child who ushered magic and healing and wild love into her life.\n\nMartha (I love her too much to call her by her surname) says it this way: This is the story of two driven Harvard academics who found out in mid- pregnancy that their unborn son would be retarded. To their own surprise and the horrified dismay of the university community, the couple ignored the abundant means, motive, and opportunity to obtain a therapeutic abortion. They decided to allow their baby to be born. What they did not realize is that they themselves were the ones who would be ‘born,’ infants in a new world where magic is commonplace, Harvard professors are the slow learners, and retarded babies are the master teachers.\n\nRead this astonishing, heartfelt, and hilarious memoir with me, won’t you?\n\nJane Eyre\n\nby Charlotte Brontë\n\nWhen I was in the Navy in my 20s, I was sad. I was a terrible fit for the work and the culture, so I took refuge in books in my time off.\n\nNoticing my reading habit, my friend Elizabeth asked me what I thought of her favorite novel, Jane Eyre.\n\n“I’ve never read it,” I confessed.\n\nShe was aghast. “A reader like you – an English major – who hasn’t read Jane Eyre?”\n\nReader, she gave me her copy.\n\nI quickly understood why she was so passionate! Jane Eyre, the eponymous heroine of this 19th C British novel by Charlotte Brontë, is passionate and inspires passion. First, she tells her own story. The first-person narration invites the reader directly into Jane’s experience and feels intimate and immediate. And it is a doozy of a story, with Jane being orphaned, cruelly mistreated, traumatized, haunted, wandering the moors of Yorkshire and nearly dying from exposure…and everyone tries to tame her, but she will not be tamed! She is wild and fierce.\n\nBut is she a heroine?\n\nThe Women’s Room\n\nby Marilyn French\n\nThis is what Barbara Kingsolver, 2023 winner of the Pulitzer Prize in Fiction, has to say about our January 2024 read:\n\nThe Women’s Room, by Marilyn French, might be the first book that made me feel powerfully seen. I’d grown up with a claustrophobic despair over being female that I couldn’t really name. That book gave me the words and turned my despair into an engine that’s been running ever since.\n\nJoin us on Sunday, January 28, to discuss The Women’s Room. From Amazon’s description: “[French] tells the story of a suburban 1950s housewife named Mira who divorces her loathsome husband and returns to graduate school at Harvard. Loosely based on Marilyn French’s own life, the story of Mira and her friends offers wry, piercing insight into the inner lives of a generation of American women. A powerful indictment of the patriarchal social norms of the time, it caused an uproar when it was first published in 1977, changing the course of the feminist movement forever. Today, it remains timely and eerily relevant—a courageous novel infused with revolutionary fervor that examines the world of hopeful believers looking for new truths.”\n\nWild: From Lost to Found on the Pacific Crest Trail\n\nby Cheryl Strayed\n\nWhat is a heroine, after all?\n\nAt the beginning of her memoir, Wild: From Lost to Found of the Pacific Crest Trail, Cheryl Strayed definitely doesn’t seem like one.\n\nUndone by grief at her mother’s death from cancer, we meet 22-year-old Strayed as she is taking a wrecking ball to her life. She cheats compulsively on the husband she loves and breaks both their hearts. She leaves college one class shy of her degree, breaking a deathbed promise to her mom. She shoots up heroine with a lost, blue-haired punk and blows out all the veins in her arms.\n\nShe doesn’t really know why she does these things, and she doesn’t really know why she is drawn to hike the Pacific Crest Trail 500 miles, alone, from the Mojave Desert to Washington. Nonetheless, one day she finds herself beginning that hike, staggering under the weight of an overstuffed backpack and mentally and physically wholly unprepared for the journey.\n\nAnd she carries on.\n\nThat’s it for me – the essential heroine spirit: she carries on. Whether by choice or compulsion, in spite of profound challenges, she keeps going.\n\nWild fell into my hands at a used bookstore in Seattle, where I was dropping off my baby at college, and feeling raw with emotion. I knew it was the next Heroines Book Club read when I came across this line: What felt profound, she says, “was how few choices I had and how often I had to do the thing I least wanted to do. How there was no escape or denial. No numbing it down with a martini or covering it up with a roll in the hay.”\n\nRead this poignant, fierce, and transcendent memoir of healing and discovery with me, won’t you?\n\nCirce, by Madeline Miller\n\nThis Heroines Book Club read features an actual heroine – as in, from a Greek myth. The novel is Circe, by Madeline Miller. The eponymous heroine, a sorceress who turns men into pigs, is a minor character in Homer’s Odyssey.\n\nBut who doesn’t want to know more about a sorceress who turns men into pigs? Miller, a classicist at the University of Pennsylvania, finally made Circe the protagonist of her own story.\n\nHow cool is that? When I was in college, these were called “stories from the margins,” and I loved them. Yeah, I thought. What about all those minor characters, whose only job is to support the arc of the hero? I want to know their stories, too! Miller fulfills my wish in Circe.\n\nAnd she’s a great writer, too! This book is a triple treat: compelling premise, gripping plot, excellent prose style.\n\nLearn all about it – praise for the novel, interviews with Miller, plans to turn this into a film, and a reader’s guide – at Miller’s website.\n\nPersuasion, by Jane Austen\n\nOur next read will be our lightest, easiest read so far, with the most uncomplicatedly endearing heroine: Anne Elliot, of Persuasion, by Jane Austen.\n\nAt 19, Anne fell in love with Frederick Wentworth, a young naval officer. “He was, at that time, a remarkably fine young man, with a great deal of intelligence, spirit, and brilliancy; and Anne an extremely pretty girl, with gentleness, modesty, taste, and feeling. . . It would be difficult to say which had seen highest perfection in the other, or which had been the happiest.”\n\nBut it wasn’t to be. Anne allowed herself to be persuaded by her snobbish relations to give up their engagement because Wentworth had not yet made his fortune. Wentworth leaves hurt and angry, and Anne comes to regret her decision. She never stops loving him. When he returns unexpectedly to the neighborhood eight years later, successful, wealthy, and looking for a wife, she wonders, can he forgive her? Can they try again?\n\nThis novel is characteristically Austen in its breadth of wonderfully drawn, interesting characters, witty dialogue, and tight plot. What sets it apart is the maturity of her lovers: they are adults who have lived, loved, and lost. The story proceeds, accordingly, with greater caution, over more time, from autumn to autumn, which makes the Austenian happy ending even more satisfying!\n\nBut I love it best of all her novels because of Anne. “There is no one so good, so capable, as Anne,” Wentworth says of her in a moment of crisis. Good, capable, and also loyal, generous, and funny Anne.\n\nI was first introduced to this story through a perfect film adaptation by the BBC starring Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds. It’s available to stream on Amazon Prime Video for $3.99. I highly recommend it.\n\nAs for the book, I am reading the Annotated Persuasion by Anchor Books.\n\nHowards End, by E. M. Forster\n\n“Only connect.”\n\nThose words are the epigraph of the novel Howards End, our next pick for the Heroines Book Club. I’ll never forget the moment I encountered them for the first time – it was summer, in my parent’s back yard, and I was settling into a lounge chair for an afternoon of reading. I was captivated: what did they mean? Connect what? Who?\n\nThe search for connections guided my reading of this novel. Set in early 20th Century Britain, the novel explores the relationships (connections) between people and between people and things – social class, money, real estate, business, art, aspirations. I admire the novel’s thoughtfulness, but it is in my top three favorite novels because of its heroine, Margaret Schlegel. I love her. Intelligent, curious, compassionate, practical, vulnerable, and principled, she is always trying to do the right thing – for me, this is the essence of a heroine. I love being with her as she tries to “only connect.”\n\nMiddlemarch: A Study of Provincial Life\n\nOur first read will be my favorite novel, Middlemarch, by George Eliot. The storytelling is wise, witty, and humane, and the prose is sublime. The more I read it, the more I love it. In fact, I was re-reading it last year and talking about it with some friends, when one of them said, “I want to read it, but I want to read it with you.” Then there was a vigorous nodding of the other heads present and a heart-warming chorus of “Me, too!” and the Heroines Book Club was born.\n\nThe novel is set in the 1830’s in the fictional town of Middlemarch, in England, and centers on two inhabitants who yearn for epic lives, Miss Dorothea Brooke and Mr. Tertius Lydgate. It examines the ways people try to do good and achieve their ambitions; the temptations, mistakes, and discouragements that undermine their efforts; and how the courageous recover. George Eliot creates a world that pulses with life and characters so real you can almost touch them. She offers penetrating insights into human behavior with deep compassion, philosophical humor, and artistry that will take your breath away.\n\nBecause of its length and richness, we’ll take our time and read Middlemarch over three months."
