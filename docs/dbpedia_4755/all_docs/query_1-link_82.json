For September, the Channel will feature films from Ang Lee, Carlos Saura, Sofia Bohdanowicz, and more!\n\nBelow you’ll find the programming schedule for the month, along with a complete list of titles that Criterion has in store for us. Don’t forget to check the Criterion Channel’s main page regularly though, as they occasionally will drop surprises that aren’t included in the official press release.\n\nDon’t subscribe yet?

A brilliant innovator whose career spanned from the silent era to the 1970s, the Chinese American trailblazer became one of golden-age Hollywood’s preeminent cameramen, renowned for his mastery of light and shadow and pioneering use of deep-focus cinematography, low-key lighting (earning him the nickname Low-Key Howe), wide-angle lenses, and dolly shots, always in service of enhancing a film’s dramatic and psychological impact. Witness the Weegee-like tabloid punch he gives to the sleazy New York cityscapes of the noir classic Sweet Smell of Success; the fantastical, phosphorescent colors of the witchy romantic romp Bell, Book and Candle; and the distorted expressionist flourishes he brings to John Frankenheimer’s paranoiac nightmare Seconds for a taste of Howe’s inimitable artistry.\n\nManhattan Melodrama, W. S. Van Dyke, 1934\n\nWhipsaw, Sam Wood, 1935\n\nThe Prisoner of Zenda, John Cromwell, 1937\n\nFire over England, William K. Howard, 1937\n\nShining Victory, Irving Rapper, 1941\n\nThe Strawberry Blonde, Raoul Walsh, 1941\n\nOut of the Fog, Anatole Litvak, 1941\n\nKings Row, Sam Wood, 1942\n\nYankee Doodle Dandy, Michael Curtiz, 1942\n\nAir Force, Howard Hawks, 1943\n\nThe Hard Way, Vincent Sherman, 1943\n\nMr. Blandings Builds His Dream House, H.

The radiantly beautiful daughter of German acting royalty, Schneider was propelled to stardom while still a teenager with her performance as the young Empress Elisabeth of Austria in the much beloved Sissi. Not content to play the ingenue for long, however, Schneider soon relocated to France, where she sought out more complex, challenging, and provocative roles in films like the languidly sexy thriller La piscine, which capitalized on her smoldering chemistry with her onetime lover Alain Delon, and Andrzej Żuławski’s intense psychodrama That Most Important Thing: Love, in which she delivered a fearlessly raw turn that earned her the inaugural César Award for Best Actress. Though her career was cut tragically short by her death at age forty-three, Schneider’s mystique has only grown over time thanks to the alluring combination of passion and intelligence she brought to every performance.\n\nSissi, Ernst Marischka, 1955\n\nBocaccio ’70, Mario Monicelli, Vittorio De Sica, Luchino Visconti, and Federico Fellini, 1962\n\nGood Neighbor Sam, David Swift, 1964\n\nLa piscine, Jacques Deray, 1969\n\nLes choses de la vie, Claude Sautet, 1970\n\nMax and the Junkmen, Claude Sautet, 1971\n\nCésar and Rosalie, Claude Sautet, 1972\n\nLudwig, Luchino Visconti, 1973\n\nThat Most Important Thing: Love, Andrzej Żuławski, 1975\n\nHenri-Georges Clouzot’s “Inferno,” Serge Bromberg and Ruxandra Medrea, 2009\n\nBritish New Wave\n\nFeaturing an introduction by critic Alicia Malone\n\nOf the myriad cinematic revolutions that swept the globe in the 1950s and ’60s, the British New Wave stood out for the raw immediacy and intense realism with which it rendered working-class lives and experiences. Emerging alongside the “angry young men” of England’s literary scene, filmmakers like Tony Richardson, Karel Reisz, and Lindsay Anderson broke new ground by giving voice to the frustrations and disillusionment felt by average Britons in tough, hard-hitting touchstones of what came to be known as “kitchen-sink realism,” including Look Back in Anger, Saturday Night and Sunday Morning, and This Sporting Life. Throughout the 1960s, directors such as John Schlesinger (Billy Liar, Darling) and Richard Lester (The Knack … and How to Get It) would continue to push the boundaries of the movement, taking it into increasingly expressionistic, fanciful, and experimental territory that reflected the liberated spirit of swinging-sixties London.\n\nRoom at the Top, Jack Clayton, 1959\n\nLook Back in Anger, Tony Richardson, 1959\n\nSaturday Night and Sunday Morning, Karel Reisz, 1960\n\nThe Entertainer, Tony Richardson, 1960\n\nA Taste of Honey, Tony Richardson, 1961\n\nThe L-Shaped Room, Bryan Forbes, 1962\n\nA Kind of Loving, John Schlesinger, 1962\n\nThis Sporting Life, Lindsay Anderson, 1963\n\nTom Jones, Tony Richardson, 1963\n\nBilly Liar, John Schlesinger, 1963\n\nThe Servant, Joseph Losey, 1963\n\nSéance on a Wet Afternoon, Bryan Forbes, 1964\n\n​​Girl with Green Eyes, Desmond Davis, 1964\n\nDarling, John Schlesinger, 1965\n\nThe Knack … and How to Get It, Richard Lester 1965\n\nIf…., Lindsay Anderson, 1969\n\nKes, Ken Loach, 1970\n\nDirected by Carlos Saura\n\nReality and fantasy, dreams and memories flow freely into one another in the haunting, layered works of iconoclastic auteur Carlos Saura, arguably the most important Spanish filmmaker to emerge between Luis Buñuel and Pedro Almodóvar. Achieving international renown during the repressive years of Francisco Franco’s rule, Saura became a model for how to make dissident political cinema under an authoritarian regime, using potent metaphors and symbolism to dodge censors and examine his nation’s troubled twentieth-century history. In complex and often controversial works like Peppermint Frappé, Cousin Angelica, and Cría cuervos … —frequently starring his longtime partner Geraldine Chaplin—Saura explored the legacy of fascism and its devastating effects on a generation of Spanish citizens, while in often-overlooked post-Franco films such as Deprisa, deprisa he captured the turbulence of a society experiencing the first shockwaves of liberalization.\n\nThe Hunt, 1966\n\nPeppermint Frappé, 1967\n\nStress Is Three, 1968\n\nHoneycomb, 1969\n\nThe Garden of Delights, 1970\n\nAna and the Wolves, 1973\n\nCousin Angelica, 1974\n\nCría cuervos … , 1976\n\nElisa, vida mía, 1977\n\nBlindfolded Eyes, 1978\n\nDeprisa, deprisa, 1981\n\nSweet Hours, 1982\n\nMarathon, 1993\n\nPremiering September 12\n\nThe Cinema 5 Story\n\nFeaturing the exclusive streaming premiere of the documentary Searching for Mr. Rugoff\n\nHow did era-defining art films like Z, Gimme Shelter, and Scenes from a Marriage find an audience in the U.S.? It was thanks in large part to a groundbreaking movie-theater chain and distribution company called Cinema 5, the brainchild of an inspired, often difficult impresario named Donald Rugoff. Selected to accompany the exclusive streaming premiere of Ira Deutchman’s documentary Searching for Mr. Rugoff, this survey of some of the films that Cinema 5 helped make classics includes underground landmarks (Putney Swope), international provocations (WR: Mysteries of the Organism), documentary triumphs (Harlan County USA), cult favorites (The Man Who Fell to Earth), and even the movie that made Arnold Schwarzenegger a household name (Pumping Iron).\n\nThe Soft Skin, François Truffaut, 1964\n\nElvira Madigan, Bo Widerberg, 1967\n\nThe Firemen’s Ball, Miloš Forman, 1967\n\nPutney Swope, Robert Downey Sr., 1969\n\nZ, Costa-Gavras, 1969\n\nGimme Shelter, Albert Maysles, David Maysles, and Charlotte Zwerin, 1970\n\nWR: Mysteries of the Organism, Dušan Makavejev, 1971\n\nGreaser’s Palace, Robert Downey Sr., 1972\n\nState of Siege, Costa-Gavras, 1972\n\nScenes from a Marriage, Ingmar Bergman, 1973\n\nVisions of Eight, Miloš Forman, Claude Lelouch, Yuri Ozerov, Mai Zetterling, Kon Ichikawa, John Schlesinger, Arthur Penn, and Michael Pfleghar, 1973\n\nSwept Away, Lina Wertmüller, 1974\n\nSeven Beauties, Lina Wertmüller, 1975\n\nCoup de grâce, Volker Schlöndorff, 1976\n\nHarlan County USA, Barbara Kopple, 1976\n\nThe Man Who Fell to Earth, Nicolas Roeg, 1976\n\nA Special Day, Ettore Scola, 1977\n\nJabberwocky, Terry Gilliam, 1977\n\nOne Sings, The Other Doesn’t, Agnès Varda, 1977\n\nPumping Iron, George Butler and Robert Fiore, 1977\n\nSearching for Mr. Rugoff, Ira Deutchman, 2019\n\nCriterion Editions\n\nPremiering September 1\n\nKes: Criterion Collection Edition #561\n\nKen Loach’s poignant tale of a young boy’s bond with a wild kestrel remains cinema’s quintessential portrait of working-class Northern England.\n\nSUPPLEMENTAL FEATURES: A television profile of Loach; a documentary on the making of the film; and more.\n\nDeath in Venice: Criterion Collection Edition #962\n\nBased on Thomas Mann’s classic novella, this late-career masterpiece from Luchino Visconti is one of cinema’s most exalted literary adaptations, as sensually rich as it is allegorically resonant.\n\nSUPPLEMENTAL FEATURES: A documentary about Visconti featuring interviews with his peers and collaborators; a short film by Visconti on his efforts to cast the character of Tadzio; interviews with Visconti, costume designer Piero Tosi, and scholar Stefano Albertini; and more.\n\nExclusive Streaming Premieres\n\nThursday, September 1\n\nBronco Bullfrog\n\nSeventeen-year-old Del (Del Walker), with no money and nowhere to go, breaks into train cars with his pal Bronco Bullfrog (Sam Shepherd). But one day he meets the lovely Irene (Anne Gooding), and despite an earful from his dad (and her mum), the two young lovers run away together—but to where? Shot in London’s East End in 1969, cast with Doc Marten–wearing “suedehead” locals, and set to a dynamic soundtrack by the art-rock band Audience, Barney Platts-Mills’s Bronco Bullfrog blends the intimate-character based sensitivity of Mike Leigh and Ken Loach with early hints of the hard, wild edges that would come to define the punk movement in the following decade. After a minuscule American release following its Edinburgh and Cannes premieres, this unsung counterculture anthem returns over fifty years later as a cult landmark.\n\nThursday, September 1\n\nPushing Hands\n\nNewly arrived from Beijing, elderly tai chi master Mr. Chu (Sihung Lung) struggles to adjust to life in New York, living with his Americanized son Alex (Ye-tong Wang). Chu immediately butts heads with his white daughter-in-law, Martha (Deb Snyder), a put-upon writer who seems to blame him for her own paralyzing inability to focus. But when Chu begins teaching tai chi at a local school, his desire to make a meaningful connection comes to fruition in the most unexpected of ways. Pushing Hands is the warm, irresistible debut film from Oscar-winning director Ang Lee, forming the first chapter in his Father Knows Best trilogy, which depicts the tensions between the traditional Confucian values of the older generation and the realities of modern life.\n\nMonday, September 12\n\nSearching for Mr. Rugoff\n\nThis illuminating, unexpected slice of forgotten film history tells the story of Donald Rugoff, who was the crazy genius behind Cinema 5, the groundbreaking midcentury theater chain and film-distribution company. Rugoff was a difficult (some would say impossible) person but was also the man who brought international art films to mainstream attention with outrageous marketing schemes and pure bluster. Rugoff’s impact on cinema culture in the United States is inestimable, and his influence on the art-film business is undeniable. Yet, mysteriously, Rugoff is now virtually forgotten. Searching for Mr. Rugoff tells the story of this fascinating, elusive personality through the eyes of his former employee Ira Deutchman, who sets out to find the truth about the man who had such a major impact on his life, and to understand how such an important figure could have disappeared so completely.\n\nSearching for Mr. Rugoff is accompanied by The Cinema 5 Story, a series of films distributed by the legendary Cinema 5.\n\nThursday, September 15\n\nNeptune Frost\n\nCodirected by Saul Williams and Anisia Uzeyman, this visually wondrous sci-fi punk musical takes place in the hilltops of Burundi, where a group of escaped coltan miners form an anticolonialist hacker collective. From their camp in an otherworldly e-waste dump, they attempt a takeover of the authoritarian regime exploiting the region’s natural resources—and its people. Set between states of being—past and present, dream and waking life, colonized and free, male and female, memory and prescience—Neptune Frost is an invigorating and empowering direct download to the cerebral cortex and a call to reclaim technology for progressive political ends.\n\nMonday, September 19\n\nThe Most Beautiful Boy in the World\n\nAccompanied by Luchino Visconti’s Death in Venice\n\nThe Most Beautiful Boy in the World follows Björn Andrésen, who was propelled to international stardom at the age of fifteen based on his looks. In 1969, filmmaker Luchino Visconti scoured Europe looking for the perfect boy to personify absolute beauty in his adaptation of Thomas Mann’s Death in Venice. One year later, he discovered Björn, a shy Swedish teenager whose performance as Tadzio brought him overnight fame and led to a brief, intense, and turbulent odyssey that took him from the Lido in Venice to London, the Cannes Film Festival, and faraway Japan. At the London premiere of Death in Venice, Visconti proclaimed his Tadzio “the world’s most beautiful boy.” Fifty years later, Björn takes us on a remarkable journey made of personal memories, cinema history, stardust, and tragedy in what could be his last attempt to finally get his life back on track.\n\nWomen Filmmakers\n\nWednesday, September 7\n\nDirected by Sofia Bohdanowicz\n\nMany of the rigorously intelligent and slyly playful films of singular Canadian auteur Sofia Bohdanowicz play out like offbeat detective stories, with her own family history as the mystery to be solved. The inspector, as it were, is Bohdanowicz’s frequent collaborator and on-screen alter ego Deragh Campbell, who has played the character of Audrey Benac—a persistent, ever-curious young woman digging through the fragments of her family’s past—in two acclaimed features (Never Eat Alone, MS Slavic 7) and two more shorts (Veslemøy’s Song, Point and Line to Plane) to date. With each tantalizing new entry, Bohdanowicz and Campbell reveal new dimensions of a fascinating lineage and of Audrey herself. Their collaborations are accompanied by several of Bohdanowicz’s solo efforts, including the captivating documentary Maison du bonheur.\n\nFeatures\n\nNever Eat Alone, Sofia Bohdanowicz, 2016\n\nMaison du bonheur, Sofia Bohdanowicz, 2017\n\nMS Slavic 7, Sofia Bohdanowicz and Deragh Campbell, 2019\n\nShorts\n\nAn Evening, Sofia Bohdanowicz, 2013\n\nA Prayer, Sofia Bohdanowicz, 2014\n\nAnother Prayer, Sofia Bohdanowicz, 2014\n\nA Drownful Brilliance of Wings, Sofia Bohdanowicz, 2016\n\nThe Soft Space, Sofia Bohdanowicz and Melanie J.

In this edition of Observations on Film Art, Professor Jeff Smith explores the bold decisions that Egoyan made in bringing Banks’s novel to the screen—particularly his complex use of nonlinear, associative editing that moves the story back and forth in time to reveal unexpected resonances between the film’s characters and themes. In forgoing traditional narrative structure, Egoyan arrives at something altogether deeper, more mysterious, and uniquely cinematic.\n\nThursday, September 15\n\nMeet the Filmmakers: Terence Davies\n\nIn the latest installment of our Meet the Filmmakers interview series, Terence Davies—subject of a recent Channel retrospective—revisits his early cinema experiences and the beginning of his career, and explores the inspiration behind his lush, memory-saturated films.\n\nSaturday Matinees\n\nSaturday, September 3\n\nPatang\n\nIn Patang (“The Kite”), a complicated family reunion unfolds amid the spectacular sights of India’s largest and most magnificent kite festival.\n\nSaturday, September 10\n\nMonkey Business: The Adventures of Curious George’s Creators\n\nDiscover the larger-than-life true story of the daring couple behind one of the most treasured children’s-book series of all time.\n\nSaturday, September 17\n\nThe Wonderland\n\nThis dazzling animated adventure from Japan brings a spectacular fantasy world to life with exuberant charm and imagination.\n\nSaturday, September 24\n\nThe Secret of Roan Inish\n\nThe great John Sayles gently evokes a world brimming with fairy-tale wonder and mystery in this lovely magical-realist fable steeped in Irish folklore.\n\nTrue Stories\n\nMonday, September 5\n\nThe September Issue\n\nCapitalism and creativity collide in this behind-the-seams look at legendary Vogue editor Anna Wintour’s fashion-industry empire as it prepares for the release of the magazine’s flagship issue.\n\nMonday, September 26\n\nThis Is Not a Movie\n\nTravel alongside the late, intrepid journalist Robert Fisk as he journeys into some of the world’s most dangerous conflicts in relentless pursuit of the truth.\n\nMore documentaries featured in this month’s programming:\n\nGimme Shelter, Albert Maysles, David Maysles, and Charlotte Zwerin, 1970\n\nVisions of Eight, Miloš Forman, Claude Lelouch, Yuri Ozerov, Mai Zetterling, Kon Ichikawa, John Schlesinger, Arthur Penn, and Michael Pfleghar, 1973\n\nHarlan County USA, Barbara Kopple, 1976\n\nPumping Iron, George Butler and Robert Fiore, 1977\n\nSurname Viet Given Name Nam, Trinh T.

While at the Slamdance Film Festival for the premiere of Discontinuity, Felker experienced a miscarriage, an incident that inspired Spontaneous, a fearlessly honest, vividly observed essay film that viscerally conveys the confusion, trauma, and surreality of an experience common to so many women.\n\nDiscontinuity, 2015\n\nSpontaneous, 2020\n\nTuesday, September 20\n\nShorts for Days: Dance on Film\n\nOne of the world’s oldest art forms meets one of the youngest in this suite of shorts that showcase the beauty, grace, grit, and endless innovation of dance in its myriad forms.
