        "text": "Pollock History, Family Crest & Coats of Arms\n\nOrigins Available:\n\nIsrael\n\nScotland\n\nIreland\n\nEngland\n\nAmong the all the peoples of ancient Scotland, the first to use the name Pollock were the Strathclyde-Britons. It was a name for someone who lived at Pollok (Gaelic: Pollag), a large district on the south-western side of the city of Glasgow, home to Crookston Castle, where Mary, Queen of Scots, was once held. The name of the town has Gaelic origins, from the word 'poll', meaning \"pool\" or \"pit\".\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly Origins of the Pollock family\n\nThe surname Pollock was first found in Renfrewshire (Gaelic: Siorrachd Rinn Friù), a historic county of Scotland, today encompassing the Council Areas of Renfrew, East Renfrewshire, and Iverclyde, in the Strathclyde region of southwestern Scotland, where the first occurrence of the name is Peter, son of Fulbert or Fulburt who was granted the lands of Upper Pollock by the High Steward, and who took the surname from the lands, making him the first Pollock. Peter gave the church of Pulloc and its pertinents to the monastery of Paisley, sometime between 1177 and 1199. Within that same period of time, he also confirmed the charter of his brother Helias of Perthic to the same house. Peter also possessed lands in Moray and circa 1175, he witnessed the charter by William the Lion granting Burgin to the Abbey of Kinlos. 1\n\nCirca 1230, Murial de Polloc, a daughter of Peter, gifted her land of Inuerorkel and all its pertinents for the benefit of the hospital erected beside the bridge of Spey for the reception of travelers. Continuing this pattern of generosity, Robert de Pollok granted to the monastery of Paisley, during the reign of Alexander II, alms of twelve pennies a year from the rents he earned from his lands. Other important Pollocks include John Pollok who was both steward of the Abbey of Arbroath and sheriff of Forfar. 1\n\nIn England, Pook was a popular variant and in this case, the family was probably from Puckney Gill in the parish of Charlwood, County Surrey, so called from the Old English word \"puca\" (goblin) and \"eg\" (island). 2 The surname is first found in Sussex in 1332 as atte Pukenegh, and occurs also in County Surrey at about the same date. From the fourteenth to the seventeenth century the name was largely confined to a small central area of central Sussex, around West Grinstead. The name was also occasionally used as a nickname 'the puk' from the complexion of hair or dress, a colour between russet and black. 3\n\nWilliam Puch was documented in the year 1166, and appears to be the first of the name on record. William le Puk of County Somerset, was documented during the reign of Edward III (1327-1377) and John Pouk was recorded in County Somerset at the same time. 4\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly History of the Pollock family\n\nThis web page shows only a small excerpt of our Pollock research. Another 220 words (16 lines of text) covering the years 1234, 1272, 1590, 1603, 1660, 1827 and 1890 are included under the topic Early Pollock History in all our PDF Extended History products and printed products wherever possible.\n\nLoading...\n\nPollock Spelling Variations\n\nThe variation in the spelling of Medieval names is a result of the lack of spelling rules in the English language prior to the last few hundred years. Before that time, scribes spelled according to sound, often varying the spelling of name within a single document. Pollock has appeared as Pollock, Pollocke, Polk, Polke, Pollok, Pollick, Polloch, Pook, Pooke, Poock, Pogue, Poag, Poage, Poague, Poak and many more.\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly Notables of the Pollock family\n\nNotable amongst the family at this time was\n\nPeter Pollock of Renfrew\n\nPollock World Ranking\n\nIn the United States, the name Pollock is the 1,440th most popular surname with an estimated 22,383 people with that name. 5 However, in Canada, the name Pollock is ranked the 936th most popular surname with an estimated 5,810 people with that name. 6 And in Australia, the name Pollock is the 747th popular surname with an estimated 5,215 people with that name. 7 New Zealand ranks Pollock as 655th with 1,088 people. 8 The United Kingdom ranks Pollock as 923rd with 7,495 people. 9\n\nMigration of the Pollock family to Ireland\n\nSome of the Pollock family moved to Ireland, but this topic is not covered in this excerpt.\n\nAnother 96 words (7 lines of text) about their life in Ireland is included in all our PDF Extended History products and printed products wherever possible.\n\nLoading...\n\nPollock migration to the United States +\n\nAs the persecution of Clan families continued, they sailed for North America in increasing numbers.

Mottoes first began to be shown with arms in the 14th and 15th centuries, but were not in general use until the 17th century. Thus the oldest coats of arms generally do not include a motto. Mottoes seldom form part of the grant of arms: Under most heraldic authorities, a motto is an optional component of the coat of arms, and can be added to or changed at will; many families have chosen not to display a motto.\n\nMotto: Audacter et strenue\n\nMotto Translation: Boldly and earnestly.\n\nCitations +\n\nBlack, George F., The Surnames of Scotland Their Origin, Meaning and History.
