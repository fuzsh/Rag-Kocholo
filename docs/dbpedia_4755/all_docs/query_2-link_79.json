        "text": "By Scott Ross\n\nThis dark, visceral adaptation by the screenwriter William Goldman and the director John Schlesinger of Goldman’s “What-If?” novel about a Mengele-like Nazi in South American unavoidably drawn to New York City was one of the first “R”-rated movies I ever saw, and as Laurence Olivier’s Szell does to Dustin Hoffman’s Thomas “Babe” Levy with his dental equipment, it took the top of my young head off. I’d never seen anything like it before, and although I’d read Goldman’s book the year previously, the movie of Marathon Man shook me to the core. I’m not sure if it was the violence, always sudden and genuinely shocking, or the blood (which I gather was toned down for the Ratings Board) or perhaps the total, lacerating effect, that did such a number on me but I well remember having to pull myself out of my seat when the lights came up and maneuver outside the theater on legs that suddenly didn’t seem entirely solid any longer. It was perhaps the most visceral movie experience I, at the age of 15, had ever had.\n\nSitting down recently with the new Kino 4K UHD disc of Marathon Man — a superbly engineered scan of the original negative that surpasses every previous digital release and makes the movie look better than at any time since its original run in 1976 — I felt something strongly akin to the same feverish response I’d experienced then. Pauline Kael was put off by the movie’s classical realism, believing the book’s potboiler-thriller status called for a slicker, whorier approach, but I disagree; Schlesinger’s elegant verisimilitude, captured in Conrad Hall’s extraordinary, deep-saturated imagery, gives the pulp plotting both a stylish patina and a prevailing sense of dread that drenches the narrative like a fever-dream from beginning to end. As the scenarist, Goldman cleverly re-imagined his exciting novel for the screen, and his increasingly frightening use of the question “Is it safe?” briefly became a part of the American cultural language… and inspired a new fear of your friendly neighborhood dentist only slightly less pronounced than the sheepish terror with which swimmers regarded the sea a year earlier, during the theatrical run of Jaws.\n\nI have been musing lately that, surprisingly to me, Dustin Hoffman is either the star or one of the stars of five movies dear to me (The Graduate, Midnight Cowboy, All the President’s Men, Marathon Man and Tootsie), several others (Papillion, Agatha, Straight Time, Ishtar, the television Death of a Salesman, Wag the Dog) I’ve admired to greater or lesser degrees depending on their qualities, and a few about which I have ambivalent feelings (Little Big Man, Lenny, Kramer vs. Kramer, Rain Man) not because of his performances but for other reasons. Yet, strangely, I never considered him a favorite actor. Perhaps he’s too easily ridiculed for his narcissistic perfectionism, the same traits for which his character Michael Dorsey is sent up in Tootsie, to be taken as seriously as I now realize I should have. I still recall with pleasure the Hoffman puppet on the British “Spitting Image” who, conspiring with a similarly caricatured Walter Matthau in a plot to dominate the world kept whining nasally, “I don’t think my character would do that.” I am also, I suspect, influenced by Hoffman’s unfortunate appearances on Blu-ray and DVD documentaries in which he makes such ludicrous statements as, “Screenplays are just blueprints”, and my increasing awareness that no single anecdote he’s related about the making of the pictures he’s been in has borne more than a passing resemblance to the truth.*\n\nThe repellent aspects of Hoffman’s personality have nothing to do with his looks, about which he whinges continually and self-pityingly. (Indeed, there are numerous shots of him in Marathon Man where, with his fashionably long shaggy haircut — worn in part to disguise the fact that he’s a bit too … is “mature” the polite word?… for Babe Levy, Goldman’s angry, bewildered graduate student drawn into an escalating, increasingly violent maelstrom — he looks shockingly like the young Tom Cruise. At these moments, and against the odds for an actor with a nose as prominent as his and with a mouthful of such badly-spaced teeth, Hoffman seems, as long as he keeps his mouth closed, almost pretty.) What causes my reservations are the accounts by writers — Goldman in Adventures in the Screen Trade, Larry Gelbart in Laughing Matters — of his on-set or rehearsal behavior, such as the gut-churning afternoon Goldman describes in which Hoffman goaded the very frail Laurence Olivier into long (and, for Olivier at that stage of his life, agonizing) bouts of physical activity, presumably out of his own terror of acting with a genuine theatrical legend. This is the picture, after all, in which Hoffman’s determination to create the proper haggard look during Babe’s torture at the hands of Szell to him meant staying awake for days and to be out of a breath for a scene required running around the block, which occasioned Olivier’s famous rejoinder, “Why not try acting, dear boy?” Despite Olivier’s equanimous demeanor toward his co-star, and his generosity as a fellow actor, there’s a barb hidden in that gentle bon mot, and not one I think we need begrudge the old Knight.\n\nHowever masochistic his “process” (to use the actor’s word for preparation) and however difficult he has been to work with, however, with Hoffman the proof is in the pudding, and he seldom disappoints. From the ostensible beginning of his movie career (he had a small role in the screen adaptation of Murray Schisgal’s play The Tiger before being cast in The Graduate) he has consistently given performances that are, perhaps uniquely for an actor with his stage experience, scaled entirely to the movie camera. Not even Olivier, widely and reflexively regarded in the 1960s and ’70s as the Greatest Actor in the World, had such admirable consistency when it came to acting on film. Before Marathon Man, he had a tendency to ham it up, or at least to be notably bigger than life, which while it could yield delightful results in the right vehicle, such as the movie of Anthony Shaffer’s Sleuth, was disastrous in things like his own 1965 film production of Othello, in which he gives the single worst performance by a major star in a Shakespearean role I’ve ever seen. Hoffman, whatever his faults as a collaborator, is only ever big when the role, or the moment, requires it. It’s hard to imagine any actor at the time, of his age and limited film experience, giving the beautifully detailed rendering of comedic panic Hoffman gives in The Graduate, for example, even granted Mike Nichols’ guidance. And while he is perhaps a little too imitable in Midnight Cowboy (“G’head, g’head”) and Rain Man (“One minute to Wapner”) there is nothing artificial in those performances either; although they just miss the heartbreak we expect of them, they’re technically perfect. Even in the somewhat outrageous drag role of Tootsie’s Dorothy Michaels, the sweetness and decency of the comic contrivance gets filtered through the essential loneliness of her creator, culminating in one of the great comic characterizations in American movies, a performance to put on the shelf alongside Jack Lemmon’s in Some Like it Hot and Gene Wilder’s in The Producers. Although, at close to 40, Hoffman exceeded Babe Levy’s age by 15 years, and while he was certainly not the tall, gangly youth Goldman describes, he gives a performance of edgy intelligence, haunted by his father’s McCarthy era suicide and by his own anxieties, pushed nearly beyond endurance by the Kafkaesque circumstances of the novelist’s plot and emerging from it with his spine stiffened and his soul intact. It was Hoffman who objected to this Jewish boy becoming a kind of vigilante, and you can see his point; Goldman disagreed, and preferred the ending of his book, and that’s understandable too.\n\nAs Szell, Olivier is the smoothest, most reasonable — thus, most terrifying — Nazi imaginable. Unless you are aware of how physically depleted he was in 1976, you’d never guess it from his performance. Goldman’s Szell, famously sporting a head of white hair during his concentration camp period (Der Weisse Engel, as his victims knew him), shaves it for his trip to New York, and Schlesinger further wanted Olivier to grow a mustache. His Lordship demurred, suggesting his director instead “use my mean little mouth.” Schlesinger did. (He also scarred up that mouth.) Olivier, as with so many of his contemporaries, like Gielgud, worked from the outside in rather than, as is usually the case with American actors, the reverse, and the details that brought his characters alive often came from elsewhere. Observing the way a gardener tended his roses, for example, gave him one of the insights that make his performance as Szell so fascinating: He approaches his dentistry with the gentleness of a lover, which makes his sudden imposition of torture on Babe so shocking. As usual with Olivier, there are little moments that excite, and that delight you by their perfect instinctual quality. Here it’s the exclamation of uncontrolled glee, self-consciously choked off for the benefit of the bank guard on the other side of the door, with which he responds when Szell sees just how many diamonds are waiting in the safe-deposit box.\n\n(Parenthetically, Szell’s field of medical expertise is one of two aspects of Goldman’s book about which I am skeptical. One understands the rise of Mengele, on whom Szell was clearly based, and whose horrific experiments on camp inmates were anatomically based. But while there were certainly dentists in the camps, skilled at removing the gold from the teeth of exterminated Jews, would a DDS obtain the kind of reputation equaling that of a Mengele? It seems unlikely. Similarly, why does Szell need to visit the Jewish diamond district in Manhattan to determine current rates of exchange on gems? Couldn’t he get that information from his American handlers, or if he didn’t trust those men, send his own aides to the library? Although Szell’s walk through the diamond exchange is one of the book’s, and the movie’s, highlights, you have to wonder if it was really necessary.)\n\nEmploying a sly literary device, really little other than the code-name “Scylla,” Goldman kept from both Babe Levy and the reader the knowledge that the PhD candidate’s beloved older brother “Doc” is actually the deadly shadow-government courier whose chapters alternate with those concerning Babe; only at the moment of Scylla’s horrendous death did the reader become aware, with a shock, that he and Doc were the same character. Similarly, Scylla’s deep-state compatriot and lover Janeways is introduced in the novel, sans any reference to sex, as “Janey,” leaving the reader to assume the character is a woman. So there was a nice shock there as well when Janeways showed up in Babe’s apartment and he and Scylla were suddenly revealed, to the reader, as having been male/male, not male-and-female, lovers. Obviously, these devices cannot translate to the more surface-oriented world of film. Similarly, the homosexual relationship between Scylla and Janey, more or less explicit in the novel by the way they speak to each other, is hinted at more obliquely here, notably by the way William Devane cradles Roy Scheider’s injured hand with his own; Schlesinger, one of the few great “out” filmmakers of his time, was notoriously shy of including overt homoerotic references in his movies. (Aside, obviously, from Sunday, Bloody Sunday, which he commissioned from the screenwriter Penelope Gilliatt and silently co-authored.)†\n\nThe Scylla/Janeways relationship, like Doc’s profession (and the fact that both are assisting the old Nazi Szell) was more than a literary trick: These ruses went with the espionage the story revolves around — Goldman wanted to keep his readers off-balance, confused and upset and disoriented by things so dark they seemed to defy sane, rational belief. This is what I mean by my headline, above. If more of my fellow Americans really knew, and understood, what their government has been up to for decades… if they realized that the same banks and families, here and in Britain, that bankrolled Marx and Engels and Lenin (and Mao) also backed Herr Hitler (and inspired his mad embrace of eugenics) even as they supported those allied against them… if they comprehended that the complicity of such people went hand-in-hand with the profiteering and pro-Nazi activities of the Dulles brothers and the Rockefellers and the progenitors of CIA (then the OSS) and the bringing to the United States of unrepentant Nazi scientists to work in our government organizations… and that these same attitudes and insane predilections are at play in our government’s current lethal support for Ukrainian Nazi battalions in a collective deranged rush to nuclear confrontation… it would be pretty to think those Americans might demand a change. But then, the last man in a position to make that change, and who intended to effect it, had his head blown off at high noon on a Dallas street.\n\nRoy Scheider, who lent so much substance to the movies of my adolescence and whom I miss more than I can say, gives one of his standard superb performances as Babe’s laconic, dangerous brother. Scylla is, as Goldman describes him in the novel, in exceptional shape physically (his hands are his weapons of choice) and Scheider is so trim and well-muscled he does push-ups at a right angle to the floor, his toes pressing into his Parisian hotel room bed. He also clearly performs his own stunt-work in the fight with the milky-eyed Chinese assassin played by James Wing Woo, a sequence whose brutality is as notable as the elegance of its appointments. (I’m thinking especially of the blood-stained diaphanous curtains on Scylla’s terrace seen by the confused elderly man in the wheelchair across the boulevard, a touch which feels directorial, especially since, as in the book, Goldman’s published screenplay places the fight in a London park.) I suppose that, even in the more ethnically diverse, antiheroic 1970s Scheider’s tough, broken-nosed prizefighter look made him a harder sell as a leading man even than Hoffman, despite his having starred in Jaws. Whatever the case, he had fewer great roles in great movies than he deserved and it’s impossible, at least for me, to imagine Marathon Man without him. William Devane provides a nice mix of charm and menace as Janeways, flashing that Kennedy-like, toothy grin of his seductively and speaking in a comforting, reasonable voice Babe rightly finds suspicious. (In the novel, Babe equates him to Jay Gatsby.)\n\nWhile as these things go the loss of Goldman’s clever literary conceits is a relatively small one, it’s still a loss… although less of one than our not understanding why Doc made the trek to Babe after being disemboweled, explained in a sequence early in the novel and in the screenplay, which Schlesinger shot but subsequently cut from the picture, in which Scylla goes somewhat mad at the killing of an old adversary by callous agents in an airport men’s room: In the book, Scylla explains his reaction to himself by admitting that he feels his own violent death is imminent and he wants to die with someone who loves him. Conversely, the Olivier character’s ironic demise — well and truly hoist on his own petard — is more satisfying in the picture than in Goldman’s book. The confrontation between Babe and Szell in the movie was written by Robert Towne (and I presume, his weirdly silent partner Edward Taylor) and Goldman hated it. I concede he had a point in considering Babe making the villain eat diamonds “Hollywood bullshit,” and I sympathize as well with those who roll their eyes at Szell accidentally impaling himself on the knife he’s trying to kill Babe with. Let’s just say that when I saw Marathon Man as a teenager I had not yet experienced the old Production Code-era cliché of the villain falling on his knife, and the thing still works for me. It’s certainly more interesting and exciting than Goldman’s climax, in which Babe simply shoots Szell down. (Re-reading the book again, I was struck by how many scenes of violence Goldman set in public greenery: Scylla’s encounter with the Chinese assassin; the fatal meeting between him and Szell; and his finale. That’s not to mention Babe and Elsa being assaulted in Central Park. Was there something about urban parks Goldman found oddly suggestive of violence?)\n\nThis brings us rather nicely to the subject that most talked about in 1976 when Marathon Man was new. The violence in the movie is sudden and bloody, but as with the later The Silence of the Lambs, it’s the threat hanging over the action that makes the picture feel like a bloodbath. It’s violence meant to disturb, and unsettle and not, as is and was the case with so many contemporaneous action movies, to titillate. One of the conventions of the James Bond movies of the period that used to bug the hell out of me was the way dozens, sometimes seemingly hundreds, of the villain’s minions are killed, usually by gunshot or explosion, and all without a droplet of blood being spilled. That sort of mayhem, done painlessly to armies of anonymous extras, is the essence of un-felt violence, the kind which causes us to shrug and which after enough exposure can inure us to the suffering of others. Schlesinger felt that Marathon Man was about enduring pain, psychic and emotional as well as physical, and I think he was correct. He and Goldman not only put their characters through the ordeal; they put the audience through it as well.\n\nFor a movie which so keenly depicts a major city during its time of decline (two cities, really, since the early Scylla sequences in Paris are so creepily memorable, and Schlesinger was able to capture the grungy effects of a garbage strike on the streets) four of Marathon Man’s most striking settings — two exterior, two interior — are either created, disguised or wholly out of place: The scenes of Szell’s exile in and covert escape from Uruguay were shot at the Los Angeles Arboretum; the interior of the supposed Columbia University library was shot at USC; the Central Park Zoo Waterworks used in the finale was the creation of the Production Designer Richard MacDonald; and the brightly-lit orange fountain structure behind Scylla and Szell at their fatal confrontation was Herbert Bayer’s Escheresque “Double Ascension” sculpture at the ARCO Plaza, also in L.A. The first three are well integrated into the movie, but that last is so striking, particularly as the location for one of the picture’s most shocking sequences, that its inclusion is as puzzling in its way as the soccer ball that comes sailing out of the darkness of the Paris Opera façade after Scylla has discovered the body of his Parisian contact, a deliberately surreal effect designed to keep the audience as off-balance as Scylla feels at that moment. There are a couple of notable continuity errors in the picture as well, at the beginning, just before Szell’s brother (his father in the novel) and the irritable old driver Rosenbaum ram into the oil truck at full speed. In the first instance, the alter kaka’s distinctive green boat of a car is seen pulling around the corner into traffic behind the German but the next cut shows the old crank (Lou Gilbert) arguing with his mechanic. The second, also minor, involves the man guiding the oil truck as it backs up, whose breath is visible on the street… on a day when Rosenbaum’s radio tells us it is unseasonably warm for September in Manhattan. I’m sure you can, if you are so inclined, find dozens more mistakes cited by the obsessives who habitually post to the Internet Movie Database. I mention these because I’ve seen the picture so many times that noticing the (to me, anyway) rare anomalies of a remarkably professional endeavor has become almost a secondary pleasure in watching it.\n\nOther, more traditional pleasures include the extensive use of the then-revolutionary Steadicam system, introduced in the Woody Guthrie biopic Bound for Glory earlier in 1976 and which was so necessary for capturing Babe in motion; the occasional, effective flashbacks to Babe’s childhood; the late Michael Small’s eerie, disturbing electronics-heavy score with its addition of an effect by the keyboardist Ian Underwood which Small accurately described as “a kind of scream”; and the splendid supporting cast whose members include the great Fritz Weaver as Babe’s crisp doctoral advisor, Richard Bright and Marc Lawrence as Szell’s German henchmen, Tito Goya as the leader of the Puerto Rican street-gang that harasses Babe, Jacques Marin as Scylla’s highly suspect Parisian contact, Michael Vale and Harry Goz as jewelry salesmen, the magnificent Lotte Palfi Andor as the old woman on 47th Street who spots Szell, and the impossibly (self-)named Ben Dova as Szell’s brother. Even Marthe Keller, as Babe’s meet-cute girlfriend, the enigmatic Elsa Opel, manages to give an effective performance, aided I suspect by Schlesinger’s use of her; there is a shot of her at the Reservoir where Babe does his practice runs in which, after he has passed she looks into the middle distance with a troubled, slightly wistful glance, that conveys something unreadable about her character which, in retrospect, feels like a clue. Schlesinger and his editor, Jim Clark, weave in footage of the Ethiopian runner Abebe Bikila from the 1964 Olympics during Babe’s runs which, while compelling, would be even more useful if we could see his feet: Bikilia won his Gold Medal running barefoot, and the parallel with Babe Levy becomes explicit, and vital, when, after he makes his escape, he, also barefoot, is chased through the early morning streets of New York by his captors.\n\nAlthough Goldman never directly identifies Scylla and Janeways’ agency (“The Division”) as CIA, and in fact deflects the notion, the implication is obvious.‡ I don’t know whether the author of Marathon Man knew about Operation Paperclip, although I assume he did. But as the devolution, at least since the killing of Jack Kennedy (and, I would argue, long before that officially sanctioned murder) of the American Experiment and the growing strength of its permanent unelected government make clear, Hitler was the American ruling class’s ideal model from the beginning. His portrait should hang in the vestibule at Langley, in a hallowed spot just to one side of that hilarious carving from the Book of John: “And ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free.”\n\nPull the other leg, boys.\n\n*Just try changing a blueprint on a whim while you’re constructing the building, and see what you end up with.\n\n†Oddly, in Brothers, his novelistic sequel to Marathon Man, Goldman seems to have had second thoughts about Scylla, who, rescued from death, given plastic surgery and put on ice for years by The Division until it requires his services, is now entirely heterosexual, complete with an ex-wife and one-night stands with women. Talk about disorientation!\n\n‡Janeways, to Babe: “Now, when the gap gets too large between what the FBI can handle effectively and what the CIA doesn’t want to deal with, that’s where we come in.”\n\nRevised text copyright 2023 by Scott Ross\n\nBy Scott Ross\n\nI’m not sure I can express my admiration for Warren Beatty as a creative force in American movies briefly and succinctly so I hope you will permit me a personal privilege, because that veneration is nearly without bounds and has bearing on my attitudes toward Shampoo which he originated, co-wrote, produced and starred in. And if what follows seems wholly personal, that’s because it is. There is no such thing as objective criticism; all passion is personal, and what we love, like what we loathe, in art as in anything else, inevitably reveals a great deal about ourselves.\n\nAlthough I remember watching and enjoying $ on television in my early adolescence my first exposure to Beatty as a creative artist (that is, as opposed to “merely” as an actor) and in a movie theater, came when I was 17… a not so very good year, in fact a largely terrible one, with compensations, most of them at the movies. And the romantic comedy/fantasy Heaven Can Wait (1978), in which Beatty starred, and which he wrote (with Elaine May) and co-directed (with Buck Henry) was a movie almost calculated to get under the skin of a film-besotted teenager.\n\nFirst, the picture had a lightness of touch bracingly at odds with the slobby, crass comedy we generally got at the movies then. Great movie comedy has often thrived in uncertain times, so you might have thought the ‘70s would have produced some. But aside from one-offs such as Harold and Maude (1971), some of the Woody Allen and Mel Brooks pictures, or rare gems like The Hot Rock (1972), What’s Up, Doc? (also 1972) Peter Bogdanovich’s variation on Bringing Up Baby, the still hilarious 1975 and ‘76 Blake Edwards Pink Panther entries, the beautiful James Goldman-scripted They Might Be Giants (1971), the Larry Gelbart/Carl Reiner collaboration Oh, God! (1977) or oddball items, often tampered with and ruined during production, like the almost-wonderful Harry and Walter Go to New York (1976) and The Adventure of Sherlock Holmes’ Smarter Brother (1975) or the surprisingly charming Frank Gilroy romance From Noon to Three (1976), and even if we stretch the meaning of the word to include character studies like the Robert Altman California Split (1974), not so much comic as just a terrific picture with some deft touches and funny lines, it was dismal period for movie comedy, and had been for years. Despite the manifold miracles being wrought in American pictures during that period, if there are seminars or, worse, doctoral theses, devoted to that evergreen “The Classic 1970s Movie Comedy,” I don’t know of them, and don’t want to. It’s no wonder that college students in the late ‘60s were turning on to the Marx Brothers and W.C. Fields: Not only were they anarchic and anti-establishment before The Establishment had been named, they were, even better, funny. What did the kids in 1970 have to laugh at, aside from the Robert Altman MASH, which was anyway under its comic veneer (and if this isn’t an oxymoron) a sardonic cri de couer against the war in Vietnam? And the ‘70s proper were even worse: Nixon, Kissinger, Chile, Cambodia, Watergate, Ford, the Church Committee hearings and — as if we hadn’t been punished enough — streaking, disco, disaster movies and Jimmy Carter.\n\nSecond, Heaven Can Wait was also deeply, if on the surface almost casually, romantic. Other than Annie Hall — which I adored at 16 and which doesn’t seem so terrific today… although that may be less a reflection on the movie itself than of how repulsive I now find Woody Allen’s screen persona — there hadn’t been a great romantic comedy in so long that if you were searching for a representative title you almost had to go back to The Apartment in 1960, Irma La Douce in 1963, The Americanization of Emily in 1964, or Avanti! in 1972. (Can you name another?)* Its screenplay, beautifully poised between reality and the purely fantastic, and stuffed with characters whose assorted idiosyncrasies almost define the word “quirky,” had a point of view, something that smelled suspiciously like a genuinely leftist critique of rapacious capitalism, or at least of its excesses, and which also spoke to the frustrated alienation I felt from traditional liberal politics, then as now more enamored with the status quo than with effecting actual change, and all too smugly satisfied with itself. And it looked wonderful; William A. Fraker’s diffused images had a soft-focus patina, perfectly augmented by the imaginative staging and editing. It sounded good too; Dave Grusin, although seldom capable of delivering a great full score except in some of his comedies like Divorce American Style, is nonetheless a master at themes. For Heaven Can Wait, he came up with a charming little recurrent march scored with soprano sax, an apt choice since Beatty’s character fancies he can play that instrument (he can’t) and which gracefully segues into a gentle, rhapsodic love theme. The music was of a piece with the movie’s essential sweetness, a sunniness of disposition that, in those sour times, was invigorating — a tonic.\n\nThird, the picture was wonderfully cast: Julie Christie, James Mason — a particular favorite of my youth, and even more so now he’s gone — Dyan Cannon, Charles Grodin, Jack Warden, Vincent Gardenia, Dolph Sweet and Buck Henry, with Joseph Maher, Hamilton Camp and Arthur Malet as a trio of delightfully unflappable servants. But as much as I loved them all, Beatty in the lead was the revelation. Aside from his personal charm, or even his breathtaking physical beauty (and he was among the most beautiful and desirable men I’d ever seen on a big movie screen) his understatement as an actor, which could pull you forward in your seat, alternated with a rapid-fire rhetorical style, ideas seeming to pour out of him in every direction, some eminently clearheaded and others just this side of Bellevue; it all somehow coalesced not merely into coherent thought but some rough form of utter sanity that almost felt like genius. I was absolutely dazzled.\n\nThat verbal and intellectual integrity is a Beatty hallmark, as I came to understand when Reds was released in 1981. It seems an outward expression of his restless, questing brain; when you see him in one of his rare interviews, the concepts pile up behind his words and tumble out in a stream-of-consciousness that can be, at times, a bit exhausting but is never, as it might be with almost anyone else, boring or self-aggrandizing. Nor is it in any manner inarticulate, or pretentious; as with Marlon Brando (another exceptionally thoughtful man whom the surface-oriented regarded as a kook) what Beatty says has clearly been considered, and over a long period — years, and probably decades. The sort of intelligence he evinces is rare, and it goes with his commitment to leftist politics (he was in the McGovern “inner circle” in 1972, and a key fundraiser, although more radical than his candidate) but it’s more than the sort of hip Hollywood window-dressing so easily dismissed as trendy “Look at me!” dilettantism. It’s genuinely subversive, and in the healthiest way. Probably only Warren Beatty could have gotten Gulf & Western to pony up an eventual $40 million for a kaleidoscopic paean to American Communists, and God alone knows how he managed to convince 20th Century-Fox to commit to Bulworth (1998), very likely the sharpest and most brazenly honest political satire ever produced in this country. Some even claim the picture was never officially “green-lit,” with Beatty hustling the various studio departments so effectively no one knew what was going on until it was too late and the picture was halfway completed. Surely that is apocrypha but it speaks so well to both Warren Beatty’s reputation, and to his sly wit I hope it’s true.\n\nReds meant more to me than almost any movie of my young manhood aside from Norma Rae and All That Jazz; I couldn’t quite believe what I was seeing on that screen — the Russian Revolution, presented not as the usual disaster of conservative and liberal American fantasy, but as an arguably necessary corrective even if it quickly went sour† — and I went to the picture over and over while it was playing, and on its reissue after the 1982 Oscars, at which Beatty won as Best Director. (I would have used the modifier “improbably” for Beatty’s win, given the subject matter of his movie, but one must remember that actors make up the largest voting bloc of the Academy, and they always respond favorably when one of their own proves he can do something other than act.) Unlike with Annie Hall, I am entirely unembarrassed by my youthful ardor for Reds; even if the all-heterosexual romanticism of it is belied by the facts of both John Reed’s life and Louise Bryant’s, its exuberance as a movie, its intelligent spirit, its exhilarating editorial dash, its epic sweep and the crucial intimacy of the interviews with its “Witnesses,” its heady embrace of radical politics — its sheer effrontery — do not dissipate with time. If anything, Reds looks better with the passing of the years, especially given the artistic timidity, overwhelming neoliberalism and nearly complete corporatism of American movies (and life) in the 21st century.\n\nIdeas, of course, are never enough; only an academic or a pretentious ass goes to a movie because of how it expresses its ideas. Everything Beatty produces — with the exception, I suppose, of Dick Tracy, which in any case was more pure, trivial fun than any other comic book or comic strip movie — is about people. As Faulkner famously noted, “the problems of the human heart in conflict with itself” are the only things that make good writing “because only that is worth writing about.” Even good, silly comedy (like great, witty comedy) originates, not just in conflict, the basic building block of drama, but in the essential clash between desire and consideration. Warren Beatty’s movies as a producer, a writer, a writer/director, or a director of other people’s scripts are, without exception, concerned with both ideas and with human beings. I wouldn’t be such a fool as to idolize Beatty as a man. I don’t know him, and in any case, reactive hero-worship lies, I believe, at the root of most of our collective woes; when you imbue a candidate for office with the kind of unthinking passion that fuels sports or matinee idol fandom (those provenances of adolescence which, alas, carry over into far too many adults’ physical maturity) you shut off your ability to think. It’s all mindless cheering. As a creative man, however, Beatty has few peers, and along with his radical political viewpoint and his well-documented penchant for dithering, his interest in what is of vital concern to people has probably limited his options just as similar concerns limited those of Orson Welles. In the current creative sphere (I won’t say “artistic,” because to have that you must also actually have art) the problems of human beings are at best a tertiary concern after ever-more-elaborate special effects and turning on with mindless drivel the vast subliterate Asian population that constitutes the true audience for American movies.\n\nHaving heroes, at least still clinging to them when one is past the early age of accountability, is a dangerous delusion. I’ve long since ceased hero-worshiping Warren Beatty as my 20-year-old self once did, but I don’t mind in the least citing him as a creative touchstone. The passion he brings to his obsessions is as remarkable, and as important, as his rigorous intelligence, especially at a time when artistic obsession is equated with the adapting of hit movies of the past into Broadway musicals or animated cartoons into live action, and political passion consists mostly of holding supportive marches for whichever elderly psychopath has most recently contradicted Donald Trump.\n\nIn the 1980s it was said, often, that the former hairdresser, later movie producer and (with Peter Guber) eventual studio head Jon Peters was the inspiration for George Roundy, Beatty’s character in Shampoo, and it’s vaguely possible Beatty may have been aware of or even met him; Jay Sebring, horrifically murdered with Sharon Tate, Wojciech Frykowski and Abigail Folger, was surely a more likely model for George, as was Jack Sahakian. But that Beatty had been thinking about the movie for years is evidenced by his original title for it — Hair — which places its origins, at the very least in 1967, if not earlier, probably around the time he was putting Bonnie and Clyde together and before “The American Tribal Love-Rock Musical” opened Off-Broadway. Beatty appears to have resurrected the idea after Robert Towne (and, one presumes, his weirdly silent writing partner Edward Taylor)‡ contributed revisions to the 1973 The Parallax View. The delay between mid-‘60s conceptualization and mid-1970s realization worked in Beatty’s favor; setting Shampoo on the eve of the 1968 Presidential election gives the picture a melancholic undertone and makes its social critique all the more potent: As Jack Kennedy’s murder was the moment the unseen powers took over, Nixon’s election signified the death of hope.\n\nThat the political implications are nearly all beneath the surface is one of the hallmarks of Shampoo’s subtlety as a movie, and its faith in its audience. That’s another difference between 1975 and now, and between Beatty and almost everyone else working in mainstream American movies. There’s a moment near the end of the first half of Reds in which Beatty as Jack Reed makes an impassioned, impromptu speech before a hall of working-class Bolsheviks and is greeted with cheers. Beatty the director repeatedly cuts from Beatty the actor, reveling in the sudden acclimation (and his own passion) to Diane Keaton as Reed’s wife Louise: At first she seems intently interested, then pleased; finally, as the crowd’s enthusiasm peaks and she is unable physically to reach her husband, concerned. It’s the moment Louise realizes that Jack’s journalistic advocacy might be tipping over into obsessive political activism. The way her face clouds is a signal, and Beatty (along with Trevor Griffiths, his co-author) is too bright and too accomplished to come out and tell you in words exactly what it means. Beatty trusts us to get it, just as in Shampoo he doesn’t find it necessary for George to protest at the suspicions of some of the other characters about his sexuality. George knows who he is, sexually, and so do the various women he’s involved with; he doesn’t need to strut and proclaim. And Beatty — as with Towne (and Edwards) and Hal Ashby, the movie’s director — assumes we understand that.§\n\nNone of the characters in Shampoo is remotely interested in politics. The only one who gives the pretense that he is, the wonderfully named Lester Karpf (Jack Warden), reveals himself to George late in the picture as being for his own reasons as disgusted with Nixon as with Johnson, but hosts an election-returns party in an upstairs room at The Bistro to woo dedicated Republican money-men who do care who wins. As much as George, if in a different way, Lester is an old hand at the game of seduction, and the filmmakers (again, without comment) contrast this with George’s abortive attempt to apply for a bank loan to set up his own hairdressing shop: George has so little understanding of business that, when asked by George Furth’s loan manager for references, all he can offer is, “I do Barbara Rush,” and when Furth proves resistant, to insult him, storm out of the bank and kick a trash receptacle in impotent rage. It isn’t that Furth’s character isn’t asking for it. He’s quietly smug and dismissive and George is probably saying aloud what countless loan applicants would like to. But Lester, even a penniless Lester, would have schmoozed the man, stroked his ego — charmed him. George has ambitions, but few means of achieving them, and absolutely no idea how. He’s curiously passive, seldom acting, nearly always reacting. And, interestingly, it’s only when George is in despair that he is fully articulate, as when he explains his seeming priapism to Lester, or admits to Goldie Hawn’s Jill that he can’t seem to “get out of [his] own way.” He isn’t stupid, but he’s more apt to speak in meaningless generalizations than with conviction, as when he tells Jill she’s “great.” This gets a subtle echo a few scenes later when George’s ex Jackie (Julie Christie) says he’s “great” and Jill responds, “Yeah… George is great.” This sounds like dumb, empty late-‘60s platitudinizing, but the way Hawn says the line, and the look on her face, suggests Jill is trying to convince herself.\n\nGeorge and Lester are almost ironic mirror images in the picture, and although they are strangers to each other until well into the movie’s running time, their lives are intimately intertwined: George is the occasional lover of Lester’s bored, angry hausfrau Felicia (Lee Grant) while Lester is keeping Jackie as an expensive mistress. (Indeed, it’s Felicia who suggests to Lester that he ought to finance George’s dream of having his own salon.) It’s a classic farce set-up — there’s even a lover-hiding-in-the-closet sequence when George and Jackie begin making love in her bathroom after he’s cut her hair for the Bistro party and Lester arrives ahead of schedule, forcing them to improvise — but Beatty and his collaborators are too bright to let their sex-farce exist at a superficial level.\n\nLester may be a liar, but he isn’t a villain. If there’s a true hypocrite in the mix, it’s Felicia (note the ironic name). She’s so brazen about her infidelity that when she greets George at the Bistro she kisses him in such a showy, blatantly sexual manner they both might as well be naked. Yet when it becomes obvious to her that Lester is involved with Jackie — she seems to know but won’t admit it until she has no choice, until Jackie attempts to fellate George under the table, and Lester intervenes — she’s livid. She isn’t just angry at Lester; she’s incensed at anyone else being intimate with George. By contrast, when Lester later comes upon George and Jackie fucking in an empty pool-house, his ultimate decision is not to divest himself of his mistress but to marry her. Further, while he’s far from happy with George over what he’s seen, he forgives him. Even his (for him, natural) aversion to George, whom he believes for most of the movie is “a fairy” merely because he cuts women’s hair, is expressed with a shrug. He’s still willing to consider backing George in setting up shop for himself, and remains so even after he stumbles upon George in flagrante delicto with Jackie. There is a funny moment when Lester grips George’s arm affectionately, as he might with any other man, and immediately backs off; accepting George is a “fairy” and actually touching the fairy are obviously, for him, two entirely different things. This has a rhyme later in the picture, when George touches Lester’s hair in a professional way and Lester looks panicked, as if George is coming on to him. On the other hand, while he and Jackie are trying to keep Lester out of the bathroom after he’s nearly caught them, George isn’t above playing to Lester’s sexual phobias by suddenly shouting at him in a slightly queeny way.\n\nFor all his financial hustling, his cheating on his wife, and even the empty consumerist acquisition he represents, Lester is, with Goldie Hawn’s Jill, one of the two most likable characters in the picture. When, at a much funkier party than the one at the Bistro a naked boy calls to him to join the skinny-dipping and Lester seems about to, we’re pleasantly surprised by an adventurousness we didn’t think he was capable of. (Of course, that a naked girl is encouraging him as well is the deciding factor.) Later, when Lester indicates George to his bodyguards and tells them not to be too rough, there’s a stomach-tightening moment when we, like George, don’t know he’s joking. The cinephile’s brain automatically reaches back to the horrible end of Sweet Smell of Success when we know Tony Curtis is going to be “chastised” by the crooked cops, possibly to death, and for a moment we’re too stunned to laugh. Yet Lester, however bluff or assured he seems to be, is as riddled with insecurity as anyone else. “I just wish I knew what the hell I was living for,” he says to George the morning after the election. “You can lose it all, you know? I mean, you can lose it no matter who you are. What’s the sense of having it all?” That may be an easier question to ask when you do have it all, but the utterance is still a lot more than we normally expect from the cuckold, or the other man, in a sex-farce. Additionally, although it’s Lester who’s worried, his words (“You can lose it all”) are more prophetic for George than he he has any way of knowing.\n\nShampoo is one of those odd comedies that don’t necessarily make you laugh while you’re watching it but which may cause you to chuckle when you remember lines and scenes from it later. That doesn’t mean it isn’t funny; Shaw is among the wittiest of all playwrights but when I see Pygmalion I don’t laugh all that often at it either. Zuleika Dobson is comic, too, but it’s not especially funny. (Osbert Lancaster’s watercolor illustrations for it are funnier than the book.) Laughter by itself is not necessarily the final arbiter of whether a verbal or situational comedy is successful as it is, say, of physical humor — of a Keaton picture, or one by Chaplin or Blake Edwards. There’s so much going on in the movie, so many shrewd, understated observations being made, that in a way they militate against easy laughter, at least until you know it better. (After four viewings in two years Shampoo seems much funnier to me now. The fact that I’ve watched any movie that often in so brief a period certainly says something for it.) While its bleak ending is fully prepared for, it can still catch you off-guard. Your response to that may depend on how you look at movies: If you need your main characters heroic, and triumphant, and your comedy buoyant, Shampoo will certainly disappoint you. Because of his over-commented upon love life, all too many people conflated Beatty with the role he performs in the picture, but he considered George, as Jill calls him, a loser. “I thought of my character as someone who couldn’t perform,” he said. Beatty didn’t mean sexually: “He was exhausted, out of gas.” George is juggling too many lovers — in addition to seeing Jackie and Felicia and Jackie’s best friend Jill, he’s stringing Jill along when, as he tells Jackie, he can’t imagine being with her at 50. (He also has it off with Felicia’s teenage daughter Lorna, played by Carrie Fisher, at her instigation, but that’s as much a function of Lorna’s hatred for her mother as it is of George’s priapism.) Still, as George tells Lester near the end of the picture, “As long as I can remember, when I see a pretty girl and I go after her and I make her, it’s like I’m gonna live forever.” But what happens when you’re 50, or 60, and the women aren’t responding any longer as they once did? Forever seems less and less attainable.\n\nIt’s a function of George’s fecklessness that he cannot see either Jill’s emotional attachment to him or her real qualities. On the Criterion Blu-ray of Shampoo, Mark Harris, in conversation with Frank Rich, asserts that Jill floats in and out of the action, as if she’s incidental and Rich says, “She often turns up just when you want the movie to move forward.”¶ I disagree entirely. Even more than Jackie, Jill is the living embodiment of George’s inability to commit to anything, or anyone. It’s what lost him Jackie to begin with, and what will lose her a second time; before George can make up his mind he needs her Lester has already proposed, and she’s accepted. (Ironically, it’s George who tamps down Lester’s anger at Jackie for “cheating” with him, dissuading Lester from thinking of her as a whore over a single act of infidelity to her married lover.) Jill continually shows that she relies on George, but he doesn’t want her to; he tells Jackie that Jill “needs to be with someone who can take care of her.” Unable to decide whether to take the modeling job abroad offered to her by the commercial director played by Tony Bill, Jill asks George whether she should. It isn’t that she needs his advice; she wants to know whether he can bear for her to be away so long. Tellingly, George’s mind is so peripatetic, so unable to concentrate thought, that when Jill comes to him to ask his advice on the job he doesn’t hear a word she’s said. “Where you goin’?” he asks, genuinely puzzled. “Egypt!” she snaps incredulously. But Jill isn’t entirely passive, and she’s a lot more perceptive than George realizes. When, after his disastrous encounter with the bank loan manager he tells her he’s “trying to get things moving” she snaps, “Oh, grow up! You never stop moving! You never go anywhere!” (Hilariously, Hawn follows this up by screaming, as a child might, “Grow up, grow up!”) By the end of the movie, George might still have a shot at Lester’s financial backing, but he will have lost both Jackie and Jill.\n\nShampoo is full of such beautiful contradictions, as well as of irony. Just as the Richard Sylbert-designed home sets in the movie feature huge picture windows to let in the sunlight while none of the characters (other than George, whose mode of transportation is a motorcycle) spends any time outside, the war in Vietnam, which was rending the social fabric of the rest of the nation in 1968 and which to a large degree helped propel Richard Nixon into the White House, causes no ripples in the lives of these self-absorbed figures. The only times it does are when the salon worker Mary (Ann Weldon) talks to George about her son’s recent promotion (we see his photo on the wall) and, later, when the soldier son of George’s employer Norman (Jay Robinson) is killed, ironically not in battle but in a highway accident. Here too sexuality becomes an interesting, understated (indeed, un-commented upon) aspect of the picture. As played by Robinson, Norman is rather obviously gay but whether or not he is, or was, married to the boy’s mother is left to speculation. The revelation of Norman’s even having a son (earlier we’ve seen the soldier’s photo displayed on Norman’s desk and may have assumed he was a younger lover) would probably cause Lester Karpf some sleepless nights, but it’s of a piece with the filmmakers’ relaxed attitudes on the subject. Even when Lorna suggests to George that his appreciation of older women is “faggoty,” she doesn’t say the word with any hostility. She’s curious about the man, for her own reasons; like her father, she can’t conceive of a heterosexual man being a hairdresser. Unlike Lester, however, Lorna is attracted to George, so her interest in the question of his sexuality isn’t academic. And with Lorna too comes another fascinating contradiction: She tells George she hates Felicia, and we sense she does (don’t all teenagers hate their mothers at some point?) and that her loathing extends to having it off with her mother’s lover. She fucks George — at least, that’s the implication when Felicia comes home and George is using Lorna’s bathroom — and holds up her head defiantly, directly challenging her mother with her transgression. She doesn’t seem pleased by her dalliance with George, or relaxed, or flushed by recent sexual activity. Sex with her mother’s lover is just one more little act of petulant adolescent insubordination. On the other hand, when George exits the bath, Lorna instantly lowers her eyes. Perhaps there is, for her, a thin line between loathing and embarrassment.\n\nShampoo is one of those movies that is so perfectly cast you can’t imagine the roles with anyone other than the actors playing the characters. (Anyway you’re so engaged by them, and what they’re saying and doing, the thought likely never occurs even to you.) Lee Grant was, in the mid-1960s, still working through the marginalization that resulted from her blacklisting in 1952 and until Shampoo was never as prominent as she should have been all along. She’d gotten a well-deserved Academy Award nomination as Joyce, Beau Bridges’ obnoxious rich-bitch mother in The Landlord (1970), Hal Ashby’s debut as a director, and her performance as Felicia, which won the Supporting Actress Oscar, is the flip side of that character, bitter where Joyce was anxious and needy where she was serenely oblivious. Her hypocrisy — probably a good part of the reason her daughter despises her — is breathtaking: She shares George’s bed whenever she can, but her anger is made incandescent by Lester’s involvement with Jackie, and Grant never makes a play for our sympathies, or even our fondness. Warden got a nomination too (and would also be nominated for his marvelous comic performance as Beatty’s coach in Heaven Can Wait) and he never sets a foot wrong or telegraphs his intentions.\n\nGoldie Hawn was such a sunny, likable presence in movies of the period that I think (like the character she plays in Shampoo) her abilities weren’t appreciated, and it took a long time for her to shed her image as the giggly girl from “Laugh-In” who couldn’t get through a bit without breaking up. It was as endearing as Lily Tomlin playing Edith Ann or Ruth Buzzi’s Gladys Ormphby but, because it was natural and not character-driven, didn’t really hint at what she was capable of. The Oscar she got for the 1969 Cactus Flower must have surprised a lot of people but Hawn is such an adorable bundle of sexy innocence she’s the best thing in the picture; she makes the cliché of the kooky mistress something altogether fresh. If her role as Jill is smaller than we might like — and although the actress found it thin it’s difficult to see where it could have been expanded without overburdening the narrative, and the running-time — her impact is no less potent. Hawn makes it clear that, whatever her silly neuroses, Jill is sexy and fun, and that if George had less of a roving eye he might be able to see what he has in Jill instead of viewing her as a pleasurable impediment to some sort of future he can’t even see clearly, much less attain.\n\nIf Julie Christie’s performance is a bit harder to come to grips with, that’s because Jackie is almost unfathomable as a character, and as a woman. That’s not to say the characterization is false, merely that it’s difficult to define: Highly physically desirable, Jackie has no discernable interest in anything. She seems to exist to be objectified, either by George, her ex-boyfriend, or Lester, her wealthy lover. At least George has ambitions, even if he’s ill-equipped to realize them; Jackie doesn’t really know what, if anything, she actually wants, other than creature comforts, like the house Lester has given her or her horrible, yapping little dogs. To surrender yourself as Christie does so completely to such an essentially vapid character is deeply impressive. It could be argued that Jackie is Diana Scott in Darling (for which Christie was given the 1965 Best Actress Oscar) updated, but without even the modeling career — in Shampoo, it’s Jill who is the professional model — just the men. We don’t know what Jackie does with her time, to keep boredom (or madness?) at bay. No wonder she starts pursuing George again, even when she knows he’s no good for her. There’s something dead at her center, and Christie has a chillingly blank look except when she’s being touched — when George is making love to her, or even just paying attention to her hair. Christie is funny as well, in a riotously bitchy way, when she gets roaring drunk at the election night Bistro party, especially when she tells the old letch beside her (played by the shlock movie producer William Castle) what she really wants to do, to Beatty, and slides under the table to do it. Shampoo may not have been the first American movie comedy to acknowledge that there was such a thing as oral sex, but it was probably the first to call it by its name. (It’s also the first picture I know of since Harold Lloyd gave his fun-house mirror reflection the finger in the 1928 Speedy to have a major character use the gesture.) Although there is very little nudity in the movie its language about sex, and its frankness generally, were shocking to many in the mid-1970s, refreshing to others and immediately influential, the way John Schuck’s ad-lib during the football game in MASH (“All right, Bub, your fuckin’ head’s comin’ right off”) was to movies after 1970.#\n\nShampoo begins with a pitch-black screen, unidentifiable sounds gradually resolving themselves as human beings engaged in the sexual act. I imagine, in our auteurist age, that this has been ascribed to Hal Ashby, the movie’s director, but it’s in the Towne/(Taylor)/Beatty screenplay, one of the sharpest and canniest of its era. (Naturally, Leonard Maltin’s movie guide describes Shampoo as “dreary.” If it had a French name and subtitles he’d have pissed all over himself about it.) While much of the on-screen dialogue appears to have been improvised around what was written, it was written; the contours of the lines are largely the same, but the verbal shapes are slightly different — just as wonky but more spontaneous. There are lines in the picture that don’t show up in the screenplay, however, and they’re often illuminating, as when Jackie tells Jill how nice it is to wake up in the morning and know the rent is paid, or when George tells her that the telephone company has cut off his service so he can’t make outgoing calls. This may or may not be true (he lies constantly, to all of the women in his life) but if it is, nods toward his fecklessness and irresponsibility. Beatty also gets off a pair of barbs, not in the script, at Jackie’s expense that cut to how he feels about her being Lester’s mistress. The first is peripheral, when he comments that her hair style makes her “look like a hooker.” It does. (Those lousy up-teased 1960s bouffant hairdos always made women look like simpering fools or worse.) The wounding line is when in response to her criticisms of him he snaps, “I don’t fuck anybody for money. I do it for fun.” Probably the best line in the movie is also not in the script, but is overheard in the salon George works in and perfectly, hilariously, codifies a certain type of Los Angeles pretension: An unidentified female voice exclaiming, “Roscoe, I do not believe what you are saying to me. That was the purest comment that I have ever made!”\n\nIf what one reads about this movie as well as Bonnie & Clyde is true (and Lee Grant seconds some of it in her memoirs) Beatty the producer was often hell on his directors, and even his co-stars. On Shampoo he tended to emasculate the gentle Hal Ashby, who seems to me the perfect filmmaker for a picture like this one. Ashby observed the people in his best movies with amusement as well as pity but never maliciously or with condescension. He frames the empty, self-absorbed characters in Shampoo with a certain wry detachment, the way he did the people in The Landlord, The Last Detail and Harold and Maude, yet there is nothing dry or academic about the look of the movie, which is burnished by László Kovács’ superb, richly colored cinematography. It would have been so easy to have cynically depicted these selfish people running around screwing up each other’s lives with a flashiness equal to their essential emptiness and lack of self-fulfillment. Beatty and Towne (and Taylor) didn’t, and neither did Ashby. When, at the end, George is left with little but the taste of the ashes in his mouth, Ashby and Beatty do not stoop to making sport of him. Lesser talents would have made their sense of superiority to the character as obvious as the L.A. smog hanging over the scene as George watches Lester and Jackie drive away. Hacks would likewise have invited the audience to feel superior toward him as well. Artists on the other hand understand instinctively when enough is already too much, and don’t feel they have to put a solid leaden period on everything. They don’t mind being elliptical — yet another aspect that separates the American filmmaking of Shampoo‘s era from that of our own.\n\n“Dreary,” my ass.\n\n*The 1970 The Owl and the Pussycat was a comedy, and ultimately romantic, but while frequently hilarious it’s so dark and abrasive it often feels as decayed as the New York City in which it takes place. The enormously popular The Goodbye Girl (1977) despite Marsha Mason’s wonderful performance wasn’t great, just Neil Simon-wisecrack-happy.\n\n†The Revolution’s origins are also murky, as are the rise of National Socialism in Germany 20 years later, since it seems the same banks and families that bankrolled Marx (and Lenin and Trotsky) also backed Herr Hitler.\n\n‡See Sam Wasson’s Chinatown book The Big Goodbye. Beatty, like Towne, Jack Nicholson and Roman Polanski, was a friend of the Paramount production chief Robert Evans, and indeed Shampoo was originally slated as a Paramount release, to be produced by Evans. It feels like an Evans picture: Smart, funny, sharp, satirical, and a little sad.\n\n§This admirable restraint contrasts sharply with Beatty’s earlier refusal to make Clyde Barrow either homosexual, as Clyde likely was, or, as the screenwriters Robert Benton and David Newman intended, have him engage in a ménage with Faye Dunaway’s Bonnie and Michael J. Pollard’s C.W. Moss; it was Beatty who insisted on the insertion of Clyde’s line to Bonnie about his seeming asexuality, “Ain’t nothin’ wrong with me — I don’t like boys,” and he was obviously just as reticent to depict John Reed as bisexual. In the case of Bonnie and Clyde, Beatty told Benton and Newman it was needlessly complicated, and that they couldn’t risk alienating the audience’s affection for these two bank robbing killers by suggesting they were also deviants. With Reds, he likely reminded Griffiths they were already making a movie about a pair of Communists; they couldn’t show them as sexually fluid as well. There’s always an excuse to placate an actor’s fears, or indulge his vanity.\n\n¶Rich also claims, on no evidence, that George has “stuck” Jill in “a terrible little efficiency,” with which Harris agrees. First, who says George is paying for it? Second, while the place admittedly has a small kitchenette it also sports a vestibule, a sizable living room, bedroom and bath and a glassed-off deck with a spectacular hillside view of L.A. Have Rich and Harris been well-paid for so long they’ve forgotten what an efficiency is? Did they ever know? I lived in one, for a bad year, at 20. It would have fit in Jill’s place at least twice with room left over for Rich and Harris to hold a colloquy on its merits.\n\n#Shuck later said he never imagined Robert Altman would actually use the line. George Axelrod had filmed Roddy McDowall screaming, “Fuck you!” to his pursuers at the climax of Lord Love a Duck five years earlier, but coming as it did before the restructuring of the MPAA with its new letter-ratings, he was unable to get away with it then.\n\nText copyright 2022 by Scott Ross\n\nAddendum: November 2022\n\nAnent my citing of Lee Grant giving the finger to Jack Warden as possibly the first such American film occurrence since Speedy: I’ve just seen the movie of Catch-22, from 1970.\n\nBy Scott Ross\n\nBrother Bear (2003) was my punishment for believing there could be no modern hand-drawn animated Disney feature worse than Hunchback! The Musical. Somewhere in this movie lies a nice fable for children utterly destroyed by the latter-day Disney penchant for smothering everything in smart-ass anachronism: In the dialogue, relentlessly “street” circa 2003 even though the people who made it are at pains, through depicting things like woolly mammoths, to tell us this is an ancient story; in the characters, such as the obnoxious moose voiced by Dave Thomas and Rick Moranis and clearly intended to evoke the equally annoying McKenzie Brothers, the least funny recurring sketch on the old “SC-TV” program; and, relentlessly, via Phil Collins’ staggeringly inept, utterly banal and aggressively persistent songs, in the music. (Because nothing says “Authentic Ancient Eskimo Story” quite like Tina Turner screeching at you and the Blind Boys of Alabama twanging away.) Brother Bear marks the first time since my parents took us to Mary Poppins when I was four that I have ever turned the volume off, or otherwise sought to escape, songs in a Disney movie. This, from the studio that was once capable of giving us “When You Wish Upon a Star,” “Baby Mine,” “Pink Elephants on Parade,” “A Dream is a Wish Your Heart Makes,” “Feed the Birds” and “Under the Sea”!\n\nThe picture itself is often breathtakingly beautiful. But God, do you owe me, Collins.\n\nThe Court Jester (1955) It was with blessed relief, then, that I turned to Danny Kaye’s best and funniest comedy, one with actual songs instead of ear-splitting percussion and created by people who knew how to write them. In this case, that was Kaye’s wife — and best special material provider — Sylvia Fine, with words for most of the numbers by Sammy Cahn. (The exception is “The Maladjusted Jester,” which Kaye performs for the tyrannical king and for which Fine provided both the music and the lyrics.) A great deal of care was taken with The Court Jester, including with the songs, the witty screenplay (Melvin Frank and Norman Panama, who also jointly directed), the Korngold-evoking musical score (Vic Schoen), the rich VistaVision cinematography (Ray June), fulsome art direction (Hal Pereira), perfectly appointed costumes (Edith Head) and charming choreography (by the wonderfully-named James Starbuck). Perhaps too much care was lavished on it: The movie, budgeted for an over-lush $4 million — actual money in 1955 — returned a little over half that amount in revenues. It was television that, over time, turned it into a classic.\n\nI’ve always found it interesting that while Kaye was under contract to Sam Goldwyn for five years, the two never made a single good picture; he had to go first to Warners (for The Inspector General) and then Paramount to do his best work. He’s a bit more restrained than usual under Frank and Panama, and all the funnier, although surely the clever script helped a great deal, requiring as it does that his persona change constantly, literally at the snap of someone’s fingers. Kaye is surrounded by better actors here than usual as well: Basil Rathbone, whose face Mrs. Patrick Campbell once perfectly described as “two profiles pasted together,” essentially spoofing his own Sir Guy of Gisbourne in the 1938 Adventures of Robin Hood; Angela Lansbury, both amorous and cold-blooded as the usurper king’s marriageable daughter; the deliciously honey-voiced Glynis Johns as Kaye’s feminine counterpart; and the great Mildred Natwick as the sorceress who memorably advises him not to drink from the vessel with the pestle. Frank and Panama wrote two of Bob Hope’s better pictures (My Favorite Blonde and Monsieur Beaucaire, the latter also a comic swashbuckler) and there are times when Kaye almost seems to be imitating Hope… which in turn makes him also sound a little like Woody Allen. I wouldn’t dwell on that for too long.\n\nWhichever idiot or idiots wrote the Wikipedia entry on the picture deemed The Court Jester part of a genre blessedly undiscovered heretofore, namely a “musical-comedy, medieval romance, costume drama film.” Get it? Got it. Good.\n\nRagtime / Ragtime Director’s Workprint (1981) Miloš Forman and Michael Weller’s disastrous adaptation of Doctorow’s literary masterpiece.\n\nThe Man Who Knew Too Much (1934) Alfred Hitchcock’s first picture for Gaumont-British, and his first big talkie success both expresses his admiration of German Expressionism and lays out his thriller template, aspects of which will recur throughout the remainder of his filmography. It isn’t as sharp or as accomplished as his pictures would become, quite soon, and he foils his hero (Leslie Banks) by making him a prisoner of the international spies and killers who have kidnapped his daughter (Nova Pilbeam) to keep him and his sharp-shooter wife (Edna Best) quiet. But it’s an entertaining thriller, droll and occasionally witty, and the young Peter Lorre makes an engaging villain. This is the earliest depiction of which I am aware in movies of the widespread public fear of dentistry, as a vaguely sinister “painless” dentist (Henry Oscar) menaces Banks with ether. The big, noisy shootout during the last third was based by Hitchcock and his scenarists (Charles Bennett , D.B. Wyndham-Lewis, Edwin Greenwood and A.R. Rawlinson) on the Sidney Street Siege of 1911. Emlyn Williams is credited with additional dialogue and Arthur Benjamin composed the crucially-situated Albert Hall cantata. Hitchcock remade this one, in a bland 1956 color VisatVision release under the same title but which lumbers on for 120 minutes, 45 longer than the brisk original.\n\nCinderella Liberty (1973) One of a pair of movies made from Darryl Ponicsan novels in 1973, and the lesser of the two. Ponicsan’s engaging narrative depends too much on whimsy to survive a literalist interpretation, which is what he (as scenarist), Mark Rydell (direction) and Vilmos Zsigmond (photography) imposed on it. Rydell, an excellent actor — he’s coolly terrifying as a gangster in the botched Altman version of The Long Goodbye — was also a good director of other actors but a plodder behind the camera who, unless he was manipulating an audience, was entirely lost. The shocker here is how poor the great Zsigmond’s cinematography is; the night sequences (and there are many) are so dark, and so indistinct, it’s difficult to see the actors at all, let alone what they’re doing at a given moment. That isn’t a style, it’s a technical error somehow carried through an entire movie.\n\nThe best thing about the picture is its people, even if you can’t really believe in any of them; the movie is wonderfully cast, with James Caan giving a relaxed, amused performance as a sailor caught in limbo when the Navy loses his paperwork and who becomes involved with a slatternly B-girl and her mixed-race teenage son. As the boy, Kirk Calloway is astonishing, even when the script meanders into the cliché of uplift, and Eli Wallach counters the stickiness with vinegar as, essentially, the story’s deus ex machina. In smaller roles, Burt Young, Dabney Coleman and Allyn Ann McLerie give rich support and the young Bruno Kirby is wildly funny as the bizarre, officious little chatterbox who gets temporarily yoked to Caan on Shore Patrol duty.\n\nThe role of the B-girl Maggie is crucial to giving the picture a semblance of reality, and Marsha Mason really delivers. At the time, and thanks largely to a brief but impressive performance in Blume in Love, Mason was emerging as one of our more interesting actresses, and there’s no artifice to her Maggie. It’s a performance that goes with her appealing but somehow lumpy facial features. Like Ellen Barkin later, Mason’s face skirted conventional prettiness, which made it easier to concentrate on what she did as an actress; we weren’t distracted as is commonly the case with those, to use Anthony Burgess’s phrase about the young Jeremy Brett, “adventitiously endowed with irrelevant photogeneity.” She has an exceptional moment when, screaming at the departing Caan, she yells, “I hate you!” and then weeps, “I hate sailors…” You can tell from her devastated face that, dependent on them for her meagre livelihood, she really does despise these men and may not have realized the depth of her loathing until that moment.\n\nAlthough Rydell, Zsigmond and Ponicsan muck things up generally, the picture goes down fairly easily and you may not hate it even when it’s trying your patience with its contempt for verisimilitude. What is unforgiveable are Paul Williams’ simulated orgasms to a funky John Williams melody on the soundtrack. But then, the only way to make a Paul Williams lyric listenable is to have someone other than Paul Williams sing it.\n\nCandleshoe (1977) A “cute” Disney comedy-cum-thriller-without-thrills from the late ’70s all too freely adapted by David Swift and Rosemary Anne Sisson from a charming mystery novel by Michael Innes that increases the nastiness quotient (embodied by the seriocomic Leo McKern) and all but eliminates the charm. It’s up to David Niven and Helen Hayes to compensate, and they do their damnedest against overwhelming odds, which include a basic lack of believability in nearly every element aside from Jodie Foster’s solid performance as a tough orphaned street kid forced by circumstance to pretend she might be the heir to Hayes’ stately home, in which is hidden a cache of fabled doubloons. Thus is Anastasia grafted onto Innes, right down to a steal of Hayes’ own revelation scene from the movie version. There’s a typical would-be amusing Disney battle between the thieves and the children and old folks of the manor near the end, but the cast is pleasant and Foster, who the year before had astonished the viewers of Taxi Driver with her astounding performance as the child prostitute Iris, manages to inject a measure of reality to counter the preciousness.\n\nThe Last Detail (1973) The other, better Darryl Ponicsan adaptation of its year is not (pace Alexander Payne on the Indicator Blu-ray extras) quite a classic but has much to admire, not the least of which are the three central performances. Since his star-making turn in Easy Rider in 1969 — and he was not only the best thing about that masturbatory, self-indulgent mess of a movie but the sole reason to sit through it — Jack Nicholson had been on the verge but the movies in which he’d starred (Five Easy Pieces, Carnal Knowledge, The King of Marvin Gardens) had either under-performed at the box office or otherwise hadn’t been sufficient to make the difference. And while The Last Detail, owing in part to an indifferent release by Columbia, also didn’t make the money it ought to have, its Oscar nomination for Nicholson seemed to certify him as a bona fide movie star. (His next picture, which was likewise only a moderate hit, also resulted in an Academy Award nomination for its star, and has long been recognized as a genuine classic, both of its era and its genre: Chinatown.)\n\nNicholson plays Billy “Badass” Buddusky, a career sailor tasked with escorting the young kleptomaniac Meadows (Randy Quaid) to the naval prison at Portsmith for an unconscionable eight-year sentence. The novel, and the picture, concern how Buddusky and his coeval, Mulhall (the splendid Otis Young) react to this unwanted Shore Patrol duty, and what it takes out of them. Billy is determined to show their prisoner a last good time (which, because the virginal boy has so little in the way of good memories, becomes his only good time) with the more serious, circumspect Mulhall a somewhat reluctant participant. It’s the basic road-movie updated with sex and profanity; the screenwriters, Robert Towne and the (as usual) un-credited Edward Taylor, laced Billy’s speech with so many variations on the word “fuck” that Columbia got nervous about it and someone at TV Guide opined that when it aired on television it might be the first silent talkie.* The use of obscenities was entirely correct; they brought a necessary level of reality to the dialogue. The characters’ behavior benefits from the screenwriting and the acting too, as when a drunken Billy tries to goad the sweet-natured Meadows into hitting him and, rebuffed, punches out a hotel lamp. Nicholson’s Buddusky seems easygoing but underneath he’s tense and coiled and as the picture goes on the detail he’s been assigned eats away at his sense of composure so that when Meadows makes a futile attempt at escape Billy’s rage at the situation explodes and he beats him savagely with his fists.\n\nAshby’s cool, cinéma vérité style perfectly suits the material, as does Michael Chapman’s splendid lighting and Robert C. Jones’ intelligent editing. Although I find the series of dissolves during Young’s dressing-down of Nicholson, of which Jones is so proud, obvious and obtrusive, it may have been the only solution to a problem Ashby left him with. I also, in common with Payne, believe Johnny Mandel’s martial score intrusive, except for the placement of the old English hymn near the end, which is exactly right. The wonderful supporting cast includes Clifton James, Michael Moriarty, Nancy Allen, Carol Kane as the whore with whom Meadows couples, Luana Anders as a cult aficionado and, in a brief turn, Gilda Radner. (The picture was largely shot in Toronto, doubling for the U.S.)\n\nOne of Towne’s/Taylor’s most inspired alterations from the novel was to have Meadows’ mother, when the three sailors pay an impromptu visit, be away from home. The quick glance we get of the alcoholic mess inside Mrs. Meadows’ living room renders her banal, cliché-spouting appearance in the book entirely moot: We know everything we need to from that look inside, including why Meadows is so quietly broken. It was also a smart move on everyone’s part to end the picture before Ponicsan’s denouement. Although the final portion of the novel, in which Buddusky and Mulhall go AWOL out of self-disgust at the completion of their detail, is perfectly legitimate and, from a literary point of view, entirely explicable, it’s not exactly a satisfying finish: Billy is killed resisting arrest, and I can’t imagine anyone who loves or admires the movie of The Last Detail wanting to see that.\n\n*Robert C. Jones, The Last Detail‘s editor, was asked to handle the television and commercial airline edit, and he refused to have the actors overdub the usual idiotic “acceptable” substitutions for the movie’s blue language. Somehow, by cutting the picture’s running time and trimming the then-record number of “fucks” in the script (65) Jones was able to please the ABC censors.\n\nText copyright 2022 by Scott Ross\n\nBy Scott Ross\n\nIf you care about literacy, reading almost anything these days is taking your sanity in your hands on a regular basis. And it isn’t just the utter codswallop that passes for political “thought.” If you’re a regular reader of books, you can’t believe the idiot errors even good, established writers commit. First you re-read the line, or the claim, or the comment, thinking, “I can’t have read that right.” Then you realize: “My God! I did read that right!” One is sometimes left dazed, wondering how the hell people can get basic, well-known facts so horribly wrong… and when the voice of the editor will once more be heard upon the land.\n\nBooks about the movies have always been problematic in this area. I started reading them when I was 12 or so and becoming a seriously movie-mad adolescent, and even at that age I was occasionally nonplussed by the poor scholarship (and the equally atrocious writing) in much of what I read. And what is worse, those errors quickly get replicated by know-nothings, and repeated in their own books, which then influence equally lazy minds in the laity. Some time ago Leonard Maltin discovered to his horror that Hollywood studios were depending on his annual TV Movies reference guides for the running-times of their own films, making him feel that if he didn’t get it absolutely right, he’d somehow be responsible for the consequences of the suits’ laziness.\n\nAs so many of us have had occasion to note in reference to appalling and easily-corrected misstatements in print, in the age of the Internet it takes, quite literally, 30 seconds to perform a search, and usually less than two minutes to get an answer to matters of trivia you are unsure of. (Always assuming you are not so sunk in reactive, neo-Luddite conservatism as to actually pull down a physical book from the shelf to find the information. But then, on the evidence of You-Tube videos, I assume bookcases are now for displaying knickknacks, awards, small plants and, if the host is especially pretentious, a tiny stack of paperbacks lying on their fronts.) Of course, in a by-gone era, one depended not only upon good and diligent writers to ferret out these facts but on equally good editors to catch the mistakes and correct them. Magazines like The New Yorker used to have fact-checking departments (o, that phrase!) renowned for being impossible to fool. Now you routinely read statements in the pages of that once-venerable publication that make you scream in plaintive despair.\n\nMy own favorite example of the past decade, in a profile of Billy Joel, was the claim by the writer that one of Joel’s Long Island neighbors was John Barry, “the man who wrote the James Bond theme” when Monty Norman’s authorship of the Bond theme precipitated two of the most famously litigated cases of press libel in movie history. Barry once asked the professional ignoramus Terry Gross, in answer to her question concerning Norman — years after those lawsuits, both of which Norman won and about which Gross, all too typically, had her usual half-assed knowledge — why, if he didn’t write it, the producers hired him to score all those other Bond movies? Uhhh… because on Dr. No Barry saved Norman’s good-but-not-great theme with his terrific arrangement of it? To throw that spurious argument back at Barry, if Norman didn’t compose it (which he demonstrably did)* why is he listed as the composer on soundtrack record labels and liner notes, and in Bond movie credits? Why has he won two libel actions against publications in Britain which he claimed defamed him by suggesting he was not the theme’s composer? Far be it, however, for a New Yorker features writer to spend ten minutes doing research before making an ignorant claim. One which, mark me, children, will be repeated.\n\nWhich brings me, finally, to the point. The Big Goodbye: Chinatown and the Last Years of Hollywood (Flatiron Books, 2020), Sam Wasson’s latest flawed foray into movie history, shares with its immediate predecessor, Fosse (Eamon Dolan/Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2014) editorial propensities by its author to elide, omit and, occasionally, obfuscate that are discomfiting. I’ve had my problems with Wasson in the past over issues that, while minor, nevertheless concern the conscientious reader. I’m not referring to questions of style, or even approach, both of which are matters of personal taste and neither of which affect the essential truth of what is written. What does matter are being honest, and not making the sorts of errors that cause your better-informed readers to blanch. In Fosse, for example, Wasson asserted, without attribution (and in a book whose source-notes were voluminous) that Ann Reinking and the dancer Charles Ward were having an affair during the Broadway run of the 1978 Fosse revue Dancin’, in which she starred and he was featured. It is, and was, well known that Ward was gay; indeed, he was one of the early theatre figures to contract AIDS. It is true that Reinking was sharing an apartment with Ward at the time, but it’s quite a leap to assume they were romantically involved, even if Fosse, in his paranoia, believed they were… or Reinking, to spark his jealousy, told him they were. In any case this is, as far as I am aware, a baseless claim, one I hope was not replicated in the recent (and, to me, pointless)† miniseries Fosse and Verdon. Alas, it probably was.\n\nSimilarly, there are things in The Big Goodbye which, even when staring its author in the face, are missed. After describing the corrupt origins of Los Angeles in some detail, the author compliments the screenwriter Robert Towne on the authentic “noir” sound of the character he named “Hollis Mulwray” and seems not to know that it was simply a variation on that of William Mulholland, on whom the slightly more benign Mulwray was based. (There is also, Mr. Wasson, a rather well-known Drive in Los Angeles which still bears Mulholland’s name. Or don’t you know that either?) I am also a little dismayed by the book’s very title. Wasson may have thought he was getting at the sound or the style of Raymond Chandler and Howard Hawks, but is he unaware that “The Big Goodbye” is the name of a Peabody Award-winning, 1940s film noir time-travel episode by Tracy Tormé of Star Trek: The Next Generation, similarly titled to evoke The Big Sleep? Apparently not. I have almost no interest in Star Trek in any of its iterations, but even I knew about this.\n\nAdditionally, while briefly describing Barrie Chase, Towne’s first great love, Wasson refers to her as being in the chorus of some movie musicals. He seems to have no idea how famous Chase later became, or why. Wasson is too young, of course, to have seen Chase with Fred Astaire in his three NBC television specials (1959, 1960 and 1968) but so, except for the last one, am I. My relative youth, however, does not preclude my being aware that Chase was Astaire’s last great dancing partner, or from having seen extended clips from those shows, in which Barrie Chase proved that she was every bit as good partnering Fred as Ginger Rogers, Rita Hayworth or Cyd Charisse, and in some ways (her sly wit, her superb technique and her striking elegance) even better.‡\n\nWhat, moreover, are we to make of that subtitle? That “Hollywood” ended in the 1980s? What Wasson means (and readers of this blog will know we entirely agree) is that the personal filmmaking that marked the 1970s as the last great era in American movie history ended after the success of Jaws made projects like Chinatown nearly impossible. But the industry hardly shuttered in 1975. (And no, I don’t think I’m being pedantic; Hollywood has never been healthier, financially, than it is today. It has also never been less healthy, artistically and creatively.) Further, Wasson sniffs at Jaws as if it is ordure only slightly redeemed by being entertaining ordure, when he should instead reserve his opprobrium for the way the picture’s over-saturation marketing replaced the traditional ability of movies to build their audiences over time. While my love for Jaws is not definitive — de gustibus, baby — I hardly think the picture is in the same category as Top Gun. Wasson scorns that one too, and rightfully, but doesn’t seem to comprehend why it got made: It was the ’80s, and Reagan was president. It was perfect, anodyne, America-made-great-again (and that was his slogan long before it was Trump’s) pabulum for people who can’t handle, and don’t want, anything stronger at the movies than a two-hour commercial advertisement for United States military hegemony.\n\nOne of the most demoralizing movie books of the last quarter century is also one Wasson’s publisher is eager to compare his to and to which, alas, bears it. (So did Fosse.) Peter Biskind’s sordid Easy Riders, Raging Bulls: How the Sex-Drugs-and-Rock ‘N Roll Generation Saved Hollywood (Simon & Schuster, 1998) pretended to being a paean to the innovators of the 1970s but was far more interested in tearing them down and trashing their reputations. The book was little more than a collection of ground axes and (alleged) bad behavior, a new edition of Hollywood Babylon, updated. There is nothing (I repeat: Nothing) in the book of wisdom, of delight at quality achieved, of love for the medium or appreciation of the movies Altman, Ashby, Polanski, Pakula, DePalma, Spielberg, Bogdanovich, Coppola, Scorsese, Penn and Fosse and their collaborators carved out of a dying studio structure; of how extraordinary actors like Fonda, Brando, Burstyn, Streisand, Beatty, Pacino, Hackman, Dunaway, Scheider, Bridges, Duvall (Robert and Shelley) and — supremely — Nicholson were in them; or about how beautifully the William Goldmans, Alan Sharpes, Alvin Sargents, Joan Tewkesburys, Willard Huycks, Gloria Katzes, Buck Henrys, Paddy Chayefskys, Robert Townes and Edward Taylors crafted the screenplays for the movies we now acknowledge (and which were, indeed, acknowledged then) as the reasons the decade constituted a classic period for American movies, one it seems increasingly obvious we will never see the like of again.\n\n(I see the wheels turning in your head. Edward Who? Read on.)\n\nAfter slamming Peter Biskind for manufacturing an entire book out of gossip and bad press I am loath to put it this way; however, what is most memorable about The Big Goodbye is what’s most shocking about it. I refer not to the description of Roman Polanki’s indefensible statutory rape of a 13-year-old girl but to the revelation that no script the vaunted Robert Towne ever worked on, from his earliest days as a screenwriter to the death of his alleged best friend, was written without the direct, and daily, input of that friend, the heretofore unknown Edward Taylor… and that includes the screenplays he famously doctored. Wasson himself, in an interview about the book, says he’s still stunned by what he discovered about Towne and Taylor’s decades-long collaboration, for which Taylor was mildly compensated fiscally and seemed not to care that another man took credit for every script he ever co-wrote, or conferred on.\n\nThis revelation is only slightly less astounding than the details of Towne’s deliberate cocaine addiction, the wreckage it made of his life, his marriage, his friendships and his ability to function creatively — among other things, it destroyed the first attempt at filming The Two Jakes, costing Paramount millions and alienating both Robert Evans and Towne’s close friend Nicholson — and his staggeringly hypocritical behavior toward Julie Payne, his ex-wife and the mother of his child, whom he with the aid of a family retainer tarred in court with his own sins, and successfully. One almost feels the urge to tip one’s hat to Towne for, if nothing else, sheer physical endurance. To build one’s entire career on a lie is nothing new. To maintain that lie for decades requires stamina at the very least. The late Harlan Ellison once wrote a variation on the old “Cobbler and the Elves” story (“Working with the Little People,” collected in Strange Wine) about a played-out writer who maintains a career that should have ended long before (o irony!) due solely to the beneficent assistance of leprechauns. I wonder if even they could have kept their mouths shut as long as Edward Taylor did.\n\nAlthough I could have done without Wasson’s all too frequent forays into prose poetry (they’re either portentous, pretentious or both) one area in which he does excel is in conjuring the aura of the late ’60s, and especially in illuminating just how horrid Hollywood, and the American press, were toward Polanski after his wife and unborn son were sadistically slaughtered by members of the Manson Family. In the eyes of many, it seemed as if, merely having made Repulsion, Knife in the Water and Rosemary’s Baby, Polanski somehow willed what happened to Sharon Tate — as if he brought it on himself. Of his childhood in Poland, reputed to have been a model for Jerzy Kosinski’s novel The Painted Bird (another item Wasson never mentions) and the loss of his mother and sister to the Nazi demon the jackals of 1969 neither knew, nor cared. At a moment of numbing, horrendous grief over an insupportable act of violence that nearly leeched his sanity, Polanski became an outcast, the stench of his wife’s murder somehow clinging to him. By such logic one supposes there are those who think Stephen King asked to be plowed into by a minivan.§\n\nAlthough The Big Goodbye contains some practical information on how Chinatown was filmed, there isn’t enough; it isn’t a “making of” book (more’s the pity) and is often skimpy on details. Worse, it trots out the reliable, yawn-inducing old tropes (“Faye Dunaway was a bitch” is the most obvious) without anything approaching even-handedness. If Wasson had reached out to Dunaway and been rebuffed, that would be worth knowing. Alas, we don’t know, and her own book (Waiting for Gatsby) doesn’t seem to have been consulted by the author. Wasson also dismisses Nicholson’s post-Chinatown work out of hand, as if, amidst the tripe and the big payday items such as Batman, he never after 1974 made anything else of value, or gave another great performance. And even after limning the Nicholson/John Huston relationship, reporting on Jack’s admiration for the old director and his troubled romance with Huston’s daughter Anjelica, Wasson never even mentions Prizzi’s Honor, lamenting instead that after the ’70s Nicholson no longer played roles that challenged him. A dim-brained, thickly-accented New York mob assassin wasn’t a stretch? (Cut it out, Ross! You’re hashing my narrative buzz!) Well, poor Warren Beatty barely merits a mention here, not even an expression of admiration for his getting a studio run by Gulf & Western to finance and distribute Reds (in which Nicholson co-starred) his $30 million paean to a pair of American Communists.\n\nAnd now, at last, we come to the reason for this review, to the gravamen of my argument against shoddy writing and to the grounds for my despairing of Wasson specifically, and the decline of American authorship generally.\n\nTucked into The Big Goodbye‘s account of Oscar Night 1975, and Wasson’s digression about Francis Coppola’s Best Director award for The Godfather, Part II is this, which comes at the informed reader with the force of a body-blow:\n\n“But [Robert] Evans knew that the Academy, having previously awarded Cabaret Best Picture over The Godfather, would give Coppola his due this year.”\n\nCabaret did not win Best Picture. The Godfather did. How the former did upset the seeming surety of Coppola’s triumph was in the Academy voters giving the Best Director statuette in 1972 not to him, but to Fosse.¶\n\nWhat removes the error cited above from the realm of the trivial — and there are few things in the world more trivial than the Academy Awards — is that the writer who made that howler… wrote a 600-page book on Bob Fosse.\n\nWasson didn’t even need the Internet. All he had to do was open his own goddamned book.\n\nThe only thing more distressing to me than Sam Wasson’s lazy work habits is the plethora of articles and reviews about his book which, in an increasingly clumsy fashion, are represented by headlines evoking the movie’s famous closing line. (“It’s Chinatown, Jake” and “Forget L.A., Jake” are two of the more brilliant examples.) Well, what can be expected when Wasson himself ignores perhaps the most relevant line of dialogue in Chinatown, one to which my headline alludes. It is here, in Gittes’ first confrontation with the genial monster played by Huston. (As you read this, remember that Noah Cross consistently mangles Jake’s surname as “Gits.”)\n\nJake Gittes: How much are you worth?\n\nNoah Cross: I have no idea. How much do you want?\n\nJake: I just wanna know what you’re worth. More than 10 million?\n\nCross: Oh my, yes!\n\nJake: Why are you doing it? How much better can you eat? What could you buy that you can’t already afford?\n\nCross: The future, Mr. Gits! The future.\n\nIt is that very future for which, when I encounter such migraine-inducing imponderables as how a man can so little know his own previous subject, I tremble most.\n\n*”The James Bond Theme” was Norman’s adaptation of a song (“Good Sign, Bad Sign”) he’d written the year before Dr No, for a planned stage musical, with Julian Moore, of A House for Mister Biswas.\n\n†I don’t want to see any actors portraying other performers, particularly ones as well-known, and as reproduced, in performance and interview — or as unique and idiosyncratic — as Bob Fosse or Gwen Verdon. At best one gets a pale imitation of the genuine article, at worst a caterwauling travesty which, other than serving as Oscar-bait, has no value whatsoever. (Note, too, that the producers of Fosse and Verdon felt compelled, in this age of #MeToo, to insert Verdon’s name into the title of a series based on a book called Fosse.)\n\n‡Chase was famous enough to be cast (as Dick Shawn’s mod dancing partner) among those dozens of other guest-stars in It’s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World. She was also, memorably, the young woman brutalized by Robert Mitchum’s Max Cady in the 1962 Cape Fear, in some way too horrific to be mentioned, which made contemplating it even more horrendous.\n\n§Tom O’Neill alleges, in his book Chaos: Charles Manson, the CIA and the Secret History of the Sixties, that Polanski kept a cache of video tapes at the house which, among other things, depicted him raping his wife, and which the corrupt Los Angeles legal authorities knew of. I’m not disputing that in the slightest, nor that Polanski is in many ways a reprehensible human being. But, again, how is any of that an indication that Sharon Tate deserved, because she was married to him, to be stabbed repeatedly in her pregnant belly?\n\n¶While Godfather purists, many of whom weren’t even born in 1973, still scream at this, Fosse’s direction of Cabaret deserved all the recognition it received. Acknowledging that in no way diminishes Coppola’s own splendid achievement. It was one of those years when you wish there had been a tie. But excessive bitching 50 years later merely points up how ludicrous award shows are.\n\nText copyright 2020 by Scott Ross\n\nBy Scott Ross\n\nHome-viewing from The Armchair Theatre over the last three months; because there isn’t a single bloody thing in the cinemas worth the time, petrol, cash or personal energy it would take to go out. Although I will admit I was convinced by a friend to attend a special screening of Daughters of the Dust… thereby proving the point.\n\nTootsie (1982) Take one vanity project for a notoriously self-involved actor (Murray Schisgal writing a screenplay about acting for Dustin Hoffman); mix with a separate script by Don McGuire concerning an out-of-work performer donning drag for a soap-opera role that borrows a bit too liberally from Some Like it Hot, even unto its blond object of affection and unwanted middle-aged suitors; add in re-writes by a small army of scenarists headed by the great Larry Gelbart and including, un-credited, Barry Levinson, Robert Garland and Elaine May; bake by a director widely known as one of Hollywood’s most notorious writer fuckers (Gelbart claimed the movie was stitched together from any number of scenarists’ drafts), and the result should have been a disaster. Instead, through some weird alchemy it not only wasn’t but somehow those ingredients contrived to blend so well the picture became a small classic of its kind. Revisiting Tootsie from a 35-year remove, it seems almost miraculous: A popular comedy that tickles the mind as often as it does the ribs. And the direction, by Sydney Pollack, never a favorite filmmaker of this writer, looks as good now as it did in 1982; whatever its internal flaws (including a series of consecutive events supposedly encompassing a single evening that Gelbart later wrote was “a night that would have to last a hundred hours”) the picture is strikingly lovely, with Owen Roizman’s sumptuous lighting and the crisp, witty editing by Fredric Steinkamp and William Steinkamp giving it a patina of warmth and sophistication, a rare combination for any movie comedy.\n\nHoffman’s “Dorothy Michaels” ranks as one of the great comic creations in American movies, yet the actor also locates the loneliness of the character — or, rather characters, since everything Dorothy says and does is filtered through Michael Dorsey’s brain and emotions — and an essential sweetness and decency Michael himself lacks when he’s wearing pants.* As the unwitting object of Michael’s interests, Jessica Lange was a revelation in 1982, lightness and gravity in balance, and what she does is still astonishing in the sheer rightness of her every glance, inflection and wistful hesitation. Terri Garr is no less entrancing, in what is surely her best screen performance, and Bill Murray gets the picture’s best lines as Michael’s playwright roommate. (May created the character, and wrote his speeches.) Against his own wishes, Pollack took on the role of Hoffman’s agent, and their scenes together, reflecting some of the very real anger and frustration each felt toward the other, are among the movie’s comic highlights. The wonderful supporting cast includes Dabney Coleman as the sexist television director, Charles Durning and George Gaynes in the Joe E. Brown role(s), Doris Belack as the savvy “daytime drama” producer, Geena Davis as a nurse in the soap-within-a-film’s fictional hospital, and the late Lynne Thigpen as the show’s floor manager. Dave Grusin, who often floundered when composing for dramatic pictures, wrote for Tootsie one of his most felicitous comedy scores. "
