        "text": "The new issue of online movie smasheroo Senses of Cinema is up, and for the first time in ages I’ve contributed to it. The piece is about Carl Dreyer’s MASTER OF THE HOUSE, a film I hadn’t actually watched before but somehow got the job of reviewing, which was great because I then had to watch it and it was, like, really good. Also at the site is regular Shadowplayer David Wingrove’s piece (writing as David Melville) on Seijun Suzuki’s mind-puncturing PISTOL OPERA. His piece is way better than mine.\n\nOne of the lovely things we find about Senses is that you volunteer to write about one of the films on their list because you know it really well and think you might be the very best person to write about it, and then you think that’s maybe a little egotistical to just stake a claim on one film, so you volunteer for one or two others. And the one you through in as an afterthought because you happen to have an old tape of it somewhere so you could watch it and review it if required, well, that’s the one they ask you to do. Always!\n\nBut as I say, this keeps things lively, and it resulted in me seeing a great thing that had been unwatched on a shelf since I pirated it from the Lindsay Anderson Archive ten years ago."
