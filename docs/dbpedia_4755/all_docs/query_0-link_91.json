Venezuela, Spanish, 101 min., Colour. * The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus (2009)\n\nThis film will provide further opportunity for the conspiracy-minded to claim a Hollywood based agenda presenting perceived illuminati/masonic/luciferian symbols [00:13:13] harbinging the coming endtimes. Oddly enough there actually is a masonic square and compasses emblem, briefly seen on a painted stage backdrop. Also noteworthy is the number of all-seeing eyes in triangles or glories [00:22:46] that on two occasions are erroneously described as being satanic symbols. And what can only be described as a masonic obscurity is Terry Gilliam's self-described homage to Roberto Calvi (found hanged under Blackfriars Bridge on 18 June 1982), when Heath Ledger's character Tony is found hanging under the same bridge.

Almost masonic is the stage backdrop which includes a number of symbols one of which is a compasses over a laurel. Of no masonic significance, it is a curious piece of forshadowing when a stagehand briefly flashes a cue card with \"Exodus 8:12\" written on it. The movie ends with a rain of frogs.

The positioning is too blatant to be unintentional but whether the intent was anti-masonic or marketing is impossible to determine.
