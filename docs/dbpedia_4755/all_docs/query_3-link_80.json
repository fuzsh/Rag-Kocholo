        "text": "In the nineties, I worked for Sydney Pollack as a story editor. When Sydney, who died on Monday at the age of seventy-three, read a film script, he’d look for one word that would become what he called “the spine” of the story. The word that made up the spine of “Out of Africa,” he told me, was “home.” “Home” was the secret meaning of “Out of Africa”—its magnetic north, the direction towards which all compass points could, and would, slide when the film’s writers, actors, or director lost their creative way.\n\nFinding the spine of a story like “Out of Africa” was important to Sydney for many reasons, the most important of which was that it led to what he called “the ache.” The ache is self-explanatory if you’ve seen Sydney’s films. It is the ache of having one chance at deep love in a lifetime of shallow loves, and losing it too early. It is the ache of perfect, private union destroyed by terrible, worldly circumstance. For Sydney, the ache was about the way that the things we hold most dear always elude us.\n\nOne day, Sydney asked me to read Norman Mailer’s gigantic C.I.A. novel, “Harlot’s Ghost,” to see if it contained the ache. I put the huge manuscript on my desk and read all day long, taking occasional breaks for tea and white rice, which were always on offer in the kitchen. (Sydney said you shouldn’t eat rice with a fork, because something about the metal ruined the taste.) Every hour or so, Sydney would come into my office and sit down on my couch, or stand in the doorway, his fingers curled around the molding above the door, and say, smiling, “Well?” And every hour, I told him what was happening in the book. Sydney went out and came back with some tea, which he liked to drink in a glass. He wanted to spend some time talking about what made Mailer great. Then he’d slap my door, give a little wave and head down the hall, promising to be back in time for the next plot twist.\n\nIn a tree-shaded little bungalow on the Universal lot, my colleagues and I searched high and low for screenplays and novels with the ache, and rarely found them. And yet Sydney persevered, and while he persevered, we had the opportunity to persevere alongside him. Though Sydney named his production company Mirage Enterprises after an airplane he admired (he was a pilot, and loved to fly), the meaning comes through: You see it there, it’s what you want more than anything, and yet when you go to finally put your hand on it, it’s gone.\n\n—Trish Deitch"
