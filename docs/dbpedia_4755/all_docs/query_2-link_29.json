        "text": "“DAVE GRUSIN: NOT ENOUGH TIME” - FILM SYNOPSIS\n\nDAVE GRUSIN: NOT ENOUGH TIME is an elegant and uplifting Feature Length Documentary about one of the 20th Century's most important music composers. Over 5 MILLION PEOPLE all over the world have viewed Dave Grusin’s Film Score Themes, Live Concerts, and Recorded Album Music on YouTube, but even his most ardent fans don't completely realize what a phenomenal career he has had.\n\n\"Dave and I would be sitting at the bar and someone would come up and say, 'That's Dave Grusin!' and it was as if they were talking about some kind of 'God-like figure' in the world of music!\" - Tom Brokaw\n\nGrusin has been described as \"flawless\" by his peers - amazing when you consider that he had five simultaneous careers; Composer, Pianist, Arranger, Performer and Record Company Executive. He led a completely bi-coastal life for decades flying weekly between LA and NY to work with an astounding list of music and film artists. Industry icons called on Dave when they needed something extraordinary; Barbra Streisand, Steven Spielberg, Quincy Jones, Norman Lear, Sydney Pollack, Warren Beatty, James Taylor, Paul Simon, Renée Fleming, Andy Williams, Sarah Vaughn, Al Jarreau, Carmen McRae, Phil Ramone, Marilyn & Alan Bergman, Sergio Mendes, Billy Joel, Judy Collins, Peggy Lee, Chaka Khan, and Nancy Wilson to name only a few! No one else has such a long and diverse résumé.\n\n\"He was the complete 'Golden Boy' in Hollywood…the hottest film composer, the hottest TV composer and everybody just loved Dave and respected him so much.\" - Lee Ritenour\n\nStriking a marvelous contrast to the hectic worlds of LA and NYC, Director Barbara Bentree also takes the audience on an indelible journey through the panoramas of Montana, Colorado, and New Mexico using the music of Dave Grusin as the perfect underscore. Bentree assembled an Oscar winning production team to properly represent the exquisite nature of Grusin's music. With never-before-seen photos and concert footage, the film traces Dave's meteoric rise from Colorado cowboy to global music star. Frequently honored by his peers, Dave has had 8 Academy Award® Nominations, 80 Grammy Award® Nominations (GRP Records), 38 Personal Grammy Award® Nominations, 4 Golden Globe® Nominations, 3 Honorary Doctorate Degrees and 1 Emmy Award® Nomination.\n\n\"He can do anything…and he's done everything.\" - Sydney Pollack\n\nDAVE GRUSIN: NOT ENOUGH TIME also documents a \"Golden Age\" of music production in the music industry. Taking a huge leap of faith by co-founding GRP Records with his partner Larry Rosen, Dave created the first record label to go \"all digital\" at a time when the other labels were afraid to change. Beating all the odds, GRP became the highest selling Jazz label for 5 consecutive years and the music industry has never been the same.\n\nGrusin's most enduring legacy may live on in his beloved melodies and arrangements for film. The themes for films like \"On Golden Pond,\" \"The Firm,\" \"The Fabulous Baker Boys,\" \"Havana,\" \"Tootsie,\" \"Heaven Can Wait,\" and \"3 Days of the Condor\" are written about in textbooks and revered by young and veteran composers around the world.\n\nQuincy Jones may have said it the very best, \"God left his hands on Dave's shoulders a little longer than other people. He's got that God given gift.\"\n\nAmen.\n\nGRP Records was founded in 1978 and began as the natural outgrowth of Grusin-Rosen Productions. Dave Grusin and Larry Rosen produced jazz records together and were driven by a mission to make extraordinary jazz musicians more accessible for the mainstream music audience. They also focused their attention on the recording fidelity of each project, an entirely new concept for jazz records. Their relentless commitment to sound inspired them to create the first all-digital Jazz Record Label. This singular vision and dedication helped to transform the entire music industry and ushered in the new music format of Compact Discs (CD's)\n\nSome of the artists that built their music careers through their relationship with GRP were Tom Browne, Angela Bofil, Noel Pointer, David Benoit, Eddie Daniels, Kevin Eubanks, Arturo Sandoval, Diane Schuur, Earl Klugh, Chick Corea, Dave Valentin, Gerry Mulligan, Don Grusin, Special EFX, The Yellowjackets, and NY Voices, to name but a few. GRP also amplified the careers of many studio musicians such as Lee Ritenour, Harvey Mason, John Patitucci, Gary Burton, Tom Scott, Marcus Miller, Michael Brecker, Dave Weckl and many others who have gone on to become legends in the music industry.\n\nGRP was distributed by Arista until 1982 when Grusin and Rosen boldly decided to go wholly independent. The superior sound quality combined with the exceptional caliber of artists signed to the label, led to becoming the top-selling Jazz Label for five consecutive years. In 1990, GRP was bought by MCA, although Grusin and Rosen stayed on board for another five years. During that time, they had access to the catalogues of Impulse! and Decca records which GRP began to re-master and re-issue in the new CD format.\n\nGRP Records was nominated for eighty Grammy Awards, winning thirty-three."
