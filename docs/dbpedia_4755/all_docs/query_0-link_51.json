        "text": "Ang Lee (born October 23, 1954, P’ing-tung county, Taiwan) is a Taiwan-born film director who transitioned from directing Chinese films to major English-language productions.\n\nAfter high school Lee enrolled in the Taiwan Academy of Art, where he became interested in acting. In 1978 he moved to the United States to study theatre at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and cinema at New York University, where his master’s project, Fine Line, received best film and best director awards. After graduating in 1984, Lee spent the next six years unsuccessfully pitching ideas to Hollywood studio executives. Frustrated and depressed by the stagnancy of his film career in the United States, he entered two scripts in a screenplay contest in Taiwan and placed first and second. This honour inspired two independent film production companies to fund and produce his movies.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nOscar-Worthy Movie Trivia\n\nLee’s first three features, which he cowrote and directed, were comedies that poignantly examined intergenerational conflicts in Chinese families: Tui Shou (1992; Pushing Hands), Hsi Yen (1993; The Wedding Banquet), and Yinshi nan nu (1994; Eat Drink Man Woman). After earning international acclaim for the latter two movies, Lee was chosen to direct a screen adaptation of the Jane Austen novel Sense and Sensibility (1995). The film—which starred Emma Thompson, Kate Winslet, and Hugh Grant—marked a turning point in his career, with Lee proving that he could handle a British period piece. Despite his admittedly clumsy English, Lee worked with the actors—sometimes even employing tai chi chuan exercises—to evoke poignant performances, a hallmark of his directorial style. The movie was a success, garnering seven Oscar nominations.\n\nLee returned to Hollywood to make his next film, The Ice Storm (1997), a tragic drama set in the 1970s about two spiritually empty upper-middle-class American families. In 2000 Lee directed Wo hu cang long (Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon), for which he received his first Academy Award nomination. The lavish film, which featured spectacular scenes of martial arts, and launched Michelle Yeoh into global stardom, became the highest-grossing foreign-language film released in the United States. Expanding his repertoire, Lee made the live-action thriller The Hulk (2003), transforming the comic-book story into an intelligent investigation of character and identity. In 2005 he directed Brokeback Mountain, a Western that centred on two cowboys (played by Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal) who fall in love. The film was critically acclaimed, and Lee’s direction won him an Oscar."
