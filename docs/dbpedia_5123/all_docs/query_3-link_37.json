I don't know of any solution, though I guess you could always try messing with the emulated CPU clock and seeing if it helps.\n\nThanks Jos. Maybe I'll have to play this one on real hardware then.. atleast it's a lot more forgiving than the previous Splinter Cells in terms of difficulty.\n\nFun fact is that in the \"Games which hang/freeze/crash/don't boot at all\" thread, it's mentioned that Splinter Cell's Pandora Tomorrow also needs a few modifications to run.. but I did not experience any issues running it through my regular settings about a month ago. So maybe that game got fixed by accident (although it runs horribly slow). Here's me hoping the same will happen to Chaos Theory\n\nI just tested this game on 15753 and it works without Dual Core enabled! It's possible to TAS this game now. Not sure if this fix was intentional or by accident, but much thanks either way. I'll do a full recording of this in a week or so, will post back if I encounter any other issues."
