        "text": "The Quiet One\n\nJoin Date: Oct 2006\n\nLocation: Staffordshire, UK\n\nPosts: 1,986\n\nTom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Double Agent\n\nPositives:\n\n+ Very good graphics\n\n+ Voice acting is well done\n\n+ Great and fun stealth gameplay - it's fun playing a secret/double agent who's working undercover to infiltrate a terrorist organization. And since the first Splinter Cell, it never gets tiring to sneak up on unsuspecting enemies and taking them out. I love getting their attention with a whistle and grabbing them from within the shadows. Adding to this...\n\n+ There are a few more gadgets to use to get target's personal information/DNA or to hack into safes/computers etc. Some mini-games have even been added.\n\n+ Very good music - it seems to play subtly in some parts of the game. I like this from the intro and especially this from the credits.\n\n+ The 'Trust Gauge' is a nice feature. Depending on the choices you make, it could affect your employers' trust. Certain situations, later in the game, may change. As well as obtaining...\n\n+ Different endings\n\n+ Accomplishing all your required tasks, especially the ones with stars next to them, unlocks bonus/extra equipment.\n\nNegatives:\n\n- Sluggish frame-rates and screen tearing seem to be quite persistent throughout.\n\n- Unless you have a super High Definition TV, it's quite difficult to make anything out on the mini map that you can enable in the bottom left hand corner.\n\n- The plot is average. Nothing award winning here.\n\n- A number of the mini games don't have any tutorials or explanations. One in particular confused the hell out of me, even with a guide.\n\n- The game feels a bit on the short side\n\n- Multiplayer isn't particularly engaging or interesting imo.\n\n- A few minor bugs which involved enemies getting stuck\n\n- A few times when i've tried to load a saved game, from within the game, it's taken me straight back to the main menu instead.\n\nOverall: 4/5\n\n__________________\n\nNow Playing: Broken Sword: Shadow of the Templars - The Director's Cut (DS and iPhone), DOOM 3: Resurrection of Evil, Hotel Dusk: Room 215, Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney Justice for All, Silent Hill - HD Collection\n\nRecently Completed: Max Payne, Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne\n\nNext: Bayonetta, Devil May Cry - HD Collection, Max Payne 3, Metal Gear Solid - HD Collection, Silent Hill: Downpour"
