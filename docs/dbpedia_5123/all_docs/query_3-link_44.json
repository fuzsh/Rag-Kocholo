        "text": "High-tech super spy Sam Fisher returns cooler and tougher than ever, for the third in the acclaimed Splinter Cell series. Chaos Theory introduces fresh elements like a cooperative multiplayer mode, new weapons and gadgets, new stealth moves, a gripping techno-terrorism storyline, missions with multiple paths and a firm emphasis on replayability. Visually, the series has come on in leaps and bounds, with incredibly realistic graphics, effects and animation. Itâ€™s sonically sweet too, with Hollywood tough guy Michael Ironside reprising his voiceover role as Fisher, and electronica impresario Amon Tobin on soundtrack duty. Plus, you get to play the first cooperative stealth game on Gamecube. Join forces with a friend in split-screen and take on the terrorists with teamwork and special strategies unique to the multiplayer mode.\n\nWhat you need to know\n\nThis content is sold by Nintendo of Europe SE.
