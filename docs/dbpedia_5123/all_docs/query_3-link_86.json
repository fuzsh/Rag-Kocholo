After a debut trailer depicting an old, downtrodden Sam Fisher - long hair and beard in tow – involved in hand-to-hand combat in broad daylight, the team at Ubisoft Montreal took early criticism on board and carried Conviction back to the drawing board for some much needed redesigning.

His return is a triumphant, bloody, well-paced gaming experience that once again twists and turns around the activities of Sam’s parent agency Third Echelon. In this ‘conclusion’ to the Sam Fisher story, we rejoin our hero on an adventure of discovery through his past missions. It relates not only to the death of his daughter, but also recalls events as far back as the very first game.

It is meant to point out the difference between this game and its predecessors. I felt this necessary as it is the only aspect of the GiantBomb review that remained unclear.Truth be told, 5 stars was well in reach for Ubisoft Montreal.Though the gameplay takes a decidedly different approach from its predecessors, it is still a satisfying experience for both newcomers and fans of the series.

And this time, he is after his daughter that he believed had been dead all of these years. Fisher has left Third Echelon and wishes to be left alone...but, as seems to be the case with highly trained killing machines, reality keeps dragging him back into the fray. It turns out that the same thugs who killed his daughter are now planning a major attack on the nation's capitol, and Sam is called back into action to head them off at the pass.Now, suff...\n\n9 out of 9 found this review helpful.\n\nSplinter Cell meets the Bourne Trilogy\n\nComing into this game I knew what to expect, I've been following the game since E3 2009 when the first gameplay of it was shown since its mysterious disappearance. It was obvious that it wasn't going to be the same type of story, same type of character, same type of gameplay that Splinter Cell fans have come to expect. The question is were the changes for better or for worse? Well, if you're a hardcore Splinter Cell fan who won't accept any change at all, you will be disappointed.

The day or two before Splinter Cell: Conviction was released I had told myself that i would definitely not buy this game.

Well, the Friday after release i ended up finding it for $42.99. Decided what the heck, it looks like a lot of fun and is getting solid reviews and everything. Thankfully, i made a great decision.

If I described a game in which you, the bad ass hero search for your lost family member, all while ripping apart everything in your path with your bare hands, you'd be oddly (and eerily) on the mark if you spit out playing a P2 on ...\n\n10 out of 11 found this review helpful.\n\nWavering Conviction\n\nSam Fisher is back in Splinter Cell: Conviction and not only have the rules of the espionage game changed, but so has the game that players have come to know and love. SPOILER ALERT: If you have not played the previous Splinter Cell games, be warned that there may be references to previous events of the Splinter Cell series.

It's finally here and I believe it is the best game in the franchise as it keeps a great balance between the stealth and action and includes some great co-op features that will keep you busy for quite some time.

Sam Fisher is an angry man. Some would think his rage is justified, but is it really? Ubisoft thinks so, with their long awaited next installment of the Splinter Cell franchise. Their newest romp, Splinter Cell: Conviction, abandons, for the most part, the old silent-as-the-grave gameplay of it’s predecessors, instead playing more like a third person shooter with some basic stealth elements.

This represents a dramatic diversion for the series that could represent a groundswell of gamers finally able to fully enjoy and live the life of the trained killer known as Sam Fischer. Splinter Cell: Conviction, for the first time in the series, lets you play stealth or action and not one in spite of the other.

Even when double agent came out, i played both the original xbox version and the PC/360. I appreciated more the original xbox version as it felt closer to Chaos Theory which was then and now is still my favorite splinter cell game. This one plays much more like a shooter. It's about as deep into stealth in batman arkham asylum, which is to say it's present but not the entire focus of the game.

It's a more personal story that takes Sam on a journey to find his daughter's killer as well as high-stakes mission to protect our great country from the very company he helped create, Third Echelon. Pros: - Mark and Execute works fantastically and is feels pretty rewarding when you pull off a four-man kill. - Gameplay flows at a breakneck pace yet never feels overbearing. - Projective sc...\n\n3 out of 5 found this review helpful.\n\nA great game, A sub-par stealth game-\n\nSplinter Cell and Metal Gear Solid have always been the two stealth game franchises that went head to head in each console generation. In MGS4 Kojima, went for a more action focused game rather than stealth, Ubisoft has followed suit with Splinter Cell Conviction.

It feels like a game lacking identity which is upsetting as it delivers an interesting story albeit through the guise of a twitchy cover-based shooter.If there is one thing the games industry lacks is contemporary stealth games that don't feel too far from home. Something that feels like it almost certainly could happen a day or a month down the line.

In the latest installment of the Splinter Cell series, we find Mr. Fisher quietly going bananas in Malta, only to quickly find even madness won’t save him from his past. After the death of Sarah, Sam retires from his long and devout career. This, however, changes as he reunites with Anna Grimsdóttir (a.k.a. Grim), who has some news regarding his daughter. While the story is compelling, nothing is too shocking ...\n\n1 out of 1 found this review helpful.\n\nMUST BUY!!\n\nSam Fisher is back and better than EVER! Execution shots and weapon upgrades really make this game worth buying. The story is awesome and there are more ways to sneak around from place to place. The \"last known position\" feature in this game is very cool and your enemies continue to shoot where you were even though you may have moved. This leaves time for you to flank them and shoot them in the back.

The series prior to Conviction was strictly a stealth game, based on mostly \"trial and error\". Missions were somewhat linear and they all have their limitations. The story itself is nothing too glamorous and hardly fascinating at all, filling with a bunch of what the writers consider \"plot twists\" when most of us saw the events coming. But still, it had its own group of dedicated fans. However...\n\n1 out of 2 found this review helpful.\n\nIs conviction another great Clancy game?\n\nThe Splinter Cell series has been going on for some time now. It's been rather awkward. There were hits like Chaos Theory and dips like Double Agent. Is the next long-awaited splinter cell good enough to top the list? Is this game worth it since I have been waiting for it for so long? We hear you ask, (god damn delays). The answer is yes. Splinter Cell Conviction lives up to it's expectations. Sam Fisher is back and is working with Victor Coste and get back at Third Echelon. You will start...\n\n1 out of 2 found this review helpful.\n\nGrowing pains\n\nI'll be honest- I've never cared for the Splinter Cell series before. In fact, I've never cared for any game that you could, with any amount of credibility, call a \"stealth\" game. It's just not my style of game, but when I heard that Splinter Cell: Conviction was taking the series in a more action oriented direction I thought would give it a shot. The result is a mixed one that manages to combine some brilliant ideas with some pretty dumb design choices, all of which ultimately left me feeling p...\n\n1 out of 2 found this review helpful.\n\nShort but Sweet\n\nIt was about the time that I felt the pistol at the back of my head, a classic FN Five-seveN judging by the the barrel. How was I able to discover the gun just by feeling the barrel at the back of my head? Look, there are only about three different pistols in this game that have silencers, two are useful later in the game, and one of them was made for the Russian army. \"You think you can just get away with judging this game less than perfect?\" The man flicked the safety on and off for emphasis....\n\n1 out of 2 found this review helpful.\n\nAn excellent reimagining of a beloved franchise\n\nAs a long time SC veteran, it was with a mix of excitement and trepidation that I approached Splinter Cell: Conviction. The changes to the formula were significant and I wasnt sure how I would feel about them until I actually got my hands on the game. Having completed the single player campaign, here are my impressions of Splinter Cell Conviction for the 360. Hopefully these points will be useful to those folks out there who are long time SC fans but aren't sure about the new game: · ...\n\n1 out of 4 found this review helpful.\n\nA Splinter Cell not for fans\n\nComing into this series with a bad taste of steath in my mouth I was skepical. I was not a big fan of the older Splinter Cells, and when tasked to play Co-Op with my friends I was the reason we failed. Reading the previews sold me on the game and I can say that It was money well spent (for the most part). Not having played the other games I was thrown into the world of Sam Fisher with little investment.

Too much whiskey.\n\nWithin moments of booting up Splinter Cell: Conviction, you will be murdering a dude by smashing his head off of a bathroom sink. Sam Fisher has traded in his his anti-hero Third Echelon badassitude, for a new flavor of insanity. In the interest of full disclosure, I should say that much like the rest of the games in this series - the story is dumb. I know there are those of you out there who may love the Tom Clancy inspired globe trotting espionage murder-fest.

Many games I find myself bored before I even finish them and I feel like I need to force myself to complete them. Splinter Cell: Conviction was far from a forced finish. I thoroughly enjoyed playing every mission in this game. It seemed to have a beautiful balance of stealth and action while leaning towards more action, which I prefer. The variety of the levels kept everything fresh and the fantastic graphics made it even better....\n\n0 out of 0 found this review helpful.\n\nSplinter Cell Finally Made a Game.\n\nSo I haven't been a big fan of the Splinter Cell games since they came out. I thought they were too hard and the controls were too clumsy. When I saw screenshots of Conviction in development and read up on it I started to get more excited. Unfortunatly some of the stuff I read about when it was first announced didn't make it into the game but what did come out was still really great.

Then the game's camera sort of wobbles right behind Sam's right shoulder.

The team at Ubisoft Montreal have made significant changes to the game’s trial and error formula, opting for a much faster paced action/stealth hybrid.

And that is why I feel that this iconic videogame character deserved better.
