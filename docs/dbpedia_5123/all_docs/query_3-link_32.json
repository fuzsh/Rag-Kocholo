        "text": "ShareCompleted\n\nbish0p34\n\n50%PC\n\n25h Progress\n\nIt's sadly another Ubisoft game that only manages to be a 5 out of 10. I don't need to go over the positives, they're well stated in the 10/10 reviews. The game has many great things. I'm going to show some strong problems I wish people had mentioned as well.\n\nIt has the premise to be great, and was a lot of fun...but after 10 hours or so the faults shine through. Stealth is great, tight, and unforgiving. Too unforgiving. On the walls you will see alarm panels. If you stab someone right as they see you...that sets off the alarm. This is the same thing that AC2 and Brotherhood have.\n\nThe pistol is can't make a headshot unless you're close enough to make a melee takedown, but can hit a light across the room. The rifle doesn't have much range either. very poor design.\n\nThe game crashes often. It also resets graphics options more frequently. Sometime when loading a save after dying. Fisher gets stuck in crouch a lot. Reloading the game doesn't help. It stops when it wants to. Sometimes the game won't let you select a number in the code mini game. There were times I had to reload a few times to get the game to let me through a passage. The AI can be very inconsistent in it's behavior. It's a Ubisoft game, and bugs are their specialty (I currently own 29 games by them, so...)\n\nCameras are all bulletproof. Why?\n\nThe map has no use. It doesn't even show you where you are, or give NSEW directions.\n\nThe game needs better instruction. They don't give you a manual anymore (which probably told you how to play the game,) but videos. It's a great idea that's Ubi's specialty of poor design. The videos can't be paused, and don't have chapters...good luck if you need to go back a second. They don't wholly explain things, just show button presses. The Assassin's Creed tutorials of the same era were far better at making you do something to explain it. Some things still aren't explained in videos. Just poor quality work here.\n\nThe game can be a lot of fun, but it takes dealing with equally frustrating negatives.\n\nShareCompleted\n\nJredor13\n\n90%PC\n\n10h 48m Played\n\nHot damn what a fantastic stealth game this was, and perhaps the best in the series so far. Where do I even start with this?\n\nLevel design is easily the best thing here. Gives you more paths for stealth play such as airspace, pipes to crawl on, trap doors to walk underneath, and tarps you can cut through and pass by for a shortcut. There are also plenty of dark spots to lure an enemy in, giving you an opportunity to sneak past, split jumps between tight walls, or just knock them out. It's amazing that there are times I never notice those spots, which makes me feel stupid and could've saved me some time, buts that's on me, so always carefully look around your surroundings before you move. You may never notice a hidden shortcut before you take a long way, find one, and enter one only to realize it sends you back because it was meant for a shortcut.\n\nYou’re also given a sound meter which definitely helps, and what makes this mechanic so good is that depending on the setting you can use loud noises to help suppress your own for an efficient takedown.\n\nAI is heavily improved here. They’re given new dialogue when they go to investigate and will even ask another search together which are nice little details that add the charm to them. If the AI cannot seem to find you, they’ll end their search and go back to what they’re doing like it was nothing, unlike the previous games where they continue to walk in an unpredictable path. Also, when you trigger 3 alarms, the AI will become much more difficult like barricading doors and setting up ambush spots making it difficult to sneak by. For 2005, this AI is HELLA impressive!\n\nWhen it comes to gadgets, the new built-in EMP system in your pistol is a VERY useful tool that helps save a lot of ammo and avoids making noise when has to. It's great for taking out lights for a few seconds and also makes for a great distraction tool. There's also a new attachment for your rifle such as the shotgun, sniper, and foregrip. They all seem like neat additions but honestly, I never used any of their attachments as I always prefer to play stealthfully and non-lethally to avoid confrontation unless necessary. There are even new additions to taking down enemies like grabbing them from thin walls, grabbing them up from a pipe, and bashing through doors.\n\nInterrogation is heavily used here and can be useful to know door codes, rooms with ammunition & med-kits, secret pathways, and important information regarding your mission. Not only that, but they offer so much hilarious dialogue, that it adds much more personality to Sam Fisher.\n\nCharacter interactions here are great in this one. Sam, Lambert, and Grimsdotr have a lot of banter in their dialogue compared to the last two games and have plenty of memorable moments, in which I start to appreciate them more and grow on me. Again, the story here is nothing special, but to me, the characters here are where it shines the most out of all the games so far.\n\nNo forced action sections! YES! Not only that, but I feel like hit detection is improved here. I noticed I've hit so many lights many times from fair distances, so I wonder if that's a thing or if I just got better.\n\nOnto some problems, it mostly stems from technical issues here. There are moments when I completely get stuck by a door or at a desk, which leaves me unable to move and frustrates me plenty of times that I have to load back to previous saves. Another thing is that heads tend to spin a lot in conversation animations that it makes me laugh and disturbs me at the same time.\n\nSeoul mission, oh man did I hate this level a lot. It's really difficult to not get caught in this one because the AI is programmed for combat against another AI, so any visibility for a second, and they stop focusing on the enemy and gun you down completely. And man F those tanks. When I was trying to carry the pilots the safety, apparently the tanks could see me in the dark and just obliterate me right away.\n\nSwat turns & jumping on a ledge from split jumps, are gone which is a shame because I thought it would've benefitted well with Chaos Theory's level design in some aspects, but its nothing too game-breaking for me to get worked up upon.\n\nLastly, the 3 alarm system is gone which was basically a form of punishment if you killed or KO'd too many enemies. I understand why people would hate it as it’s really BS that enemies offscreen can just find the body outta nowhere, but it was a neat mechanic that encourages you to not kill/KO anyone in your way. In Chaos Theory, sometimes I can just easily knockout everyone and pass by without any consequences.\n\nOverall, really damn good stealth game. Im thinking of putting this in my top favorites. Really enjoyed a lot of its stealth play here, and I'm curious to see what Double Agent does next.\n\nShareCompleted\n\nCivilwarfare101\n\n90%PlayStation 3\n\n13h 30m Played\n\nIt's still great but most people have said that already. It easily has the best level design in the series, and a reason for this is because while the game is still ultimately linear, the individual \"stealth rooms\" gives you way more options to tackle your objectives. For example, a stealth challenge can present different ways to deal with guards, you could whistle a guard over to you and try to bypass them, use the OCP and temporaily disrupt a light source, shoot out a light and risk a guard being much more aware of your prescence, knock out or kill enemies with an instant tap of the bumper, grab them and then human shield and shoot them in the head with the pistol, use the 40K and the gadgets, or find an alternate stealth path with Sam's climbing and there are much more of them compared to the first 2 Splinter Cells. Another aspect this game does well is the AI, this might be the closest thing to a stealth game having \"unscripted\" patrols while giving you leeway of predictablity to make the game playable. The game makes you feel like an actual ghost more than anyother stealth game ever made. Guards are scared out of their mind to even want to search for you and when you are alerted, they just fire like crazy and hope you die fast, it's a nice change of pace compared to the trigger happy bloodthirsty guards of the first 2 games. The mechanics are as great as they have ever been and the addition of a noise meter plus the way Sam animates is unrivaled in 3rd person stealth games. Sam has a variety of movements in his crouching animations and Sam will move even slower when close to guards.\n\nThe story is the best in the SC series up until that point mainly in that it's an interesting enough conspiracy that makes you interested how it will unfold when you get through level after level. The banter between Sam and his team are great and it does have a weird subtext of Sam getting too old in the age digital warfare. The music is also really good and fits the game as well as being one of my favorite OSTs in gaming.\n\nNow, on to the bad, the map is horrible, really bad, it's laid out in a way that is too confusing to be of any geniune help, maybe that is the point but it makes me wonder why does it have a map. I tend to use it whenever I get close to an objective. Another strange thing about the game is that the game gives ledge, pipe, and from water kills but barely gives you any opportunities to use them, it feels weird that they are in the game when they barely even pop up. And while the story is the best SC was up until that point, the villains like Shetland and Otomo basically just monologue their whole character before something dramatic happens which I find to be rather irrating in games like this because it just feels like they are revealing their characters last minute. There isn't a really surefire way to fix this outside of long cutscenes and we got another series to play if you want that, but at the same time, it isn't super compelling. Some of the level bottlenecks can be annoying but overall, great game, it's a must play.\n\nShareCompleted\n\nPrivate\n\n80%PC\n\nThe pinnacle of the series in my opinion. Chaos Theory made a number of changes that finally allowed me to thoroughly enjoy the type of stealth gameplay the previous games were going for. For me It's the emphasize on player choice in the levels, there are multiple ways to progress through them. The story is better presented than the previous games, and it's the only story in a Splinter Cell game I got marginally invested in. The game is just so polished, it's pretty much the peak of it's kind.\n\nThe first change I noticed was the pistol—it's accuracy is finally balanced. It's not too accurate to snipe unsuspecting guards from across the maps, but it's spread isn't random enough to miss lights and slow moving enemies. You still have to use it carefully, but you don't have to mash the quick save button before taking out a light at 3 feet away incase it misses. The addition of the jammer to disable electronics without destroying them is fantastic, adding another layer of decision making.\n\nWhile I did run into some issues, the AI when it works feels massively improved. They notice open doors and broken lights in natural ways, and only become very suspicious if it keeps escalating. I remember feeling impressed when I once whistled from the shadows to try to lure a guard, but because he was already suspicious he refused to approach saying something like \"no way I'm falling for that, probably a trap, this guy's good\". I can't recall another game whose AI feels so dynamic. It doesn't always work, sometime I would get spotted while in complete darkness for no discernable reason, but those times are *clearly* glitches. Wherein it's more unclear in the other games what are glitches and what are systems being iffy to begin with.\n\nI can't overstate how much of an improvement the levels are. My favorite is probably the bank heist, which is a great example of all the best parts of Chaos Theory. Witty banter between Sam and co, intricately designed levels with multiple ways to approach, and a fun escalation of objectives that feel grounded and never had me scratching my head as to what I needed to do next. There were so many times I thought \"what if I tried doing X?\" and the game accounted for it. The optional objectives carry over into other missions if you fail to do them before and the game sort of keeps track of how your going through each level.\n\nAlmost all the changes Chaos Theory made improved it I think. There are still some issues, some of the levels have some trail and error parts. A few others feel a little uninspired. And the ending is a little anti-climatic. But it's small potatoes compared to how many times the game impressed me. The optional interrogations were well written and often funny. And the game's whole approach to stealth gameplay finally clicked with me. I would love another game in this series with this design philosophy."
