The film will be written by Eric Warren Singer, who also penned The International. Splinter Cell is not currently set up at any studio, but Ubisoft is in talking with Warner Bros and Paramount.\n\n\"Tom Hardy is currently one of the biggest talents in the film industry, and he has a phenomenal ability to take on complex and varied roles with his broad range of acting skills,\" said Jean-Julien Baronnet, CEO of Ubisoft Motion Pictures. \"His involvement in the 'Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell' movie is exciting news for movie and video game fans alike. Meanwhile, Eric Singer is one of the most talented writers of the moment, and ... we're confident he'll bring a fresh approach and create a thrilling story ... while still respecting all the codes and traditions of the franchise that are so important to fans.\""
