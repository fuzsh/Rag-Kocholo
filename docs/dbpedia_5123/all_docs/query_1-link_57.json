        "text": "Tom Hardy will star in Tom Clancys Splinter Cell, the Ubisoft film adaptation of the game franchise.\n\nHardy, who of course co-starred as Bane in this summers The Dark Knight Rises, will play Sam Fisher, a special ops agent for the organization known as Echelon.\n\nWho Is Sam Fisher?\n\nCollider reported earlier today, and Variety now confirms along with this casting news, that Eric Warren Singer (The International) will write the script.\n\nHardy brings a certain prestige to the game-to-film genre that has often been missing in the past. This tracks with Ubisofts other big property currently in development, Assassins Creed, which Michael Fassbender will co-produce and star in for New Regency and Fox. Splinter Cell doesnt have a studio yet, though Ubisoft has already begun talks with Warner Bros. and Paramount.\n\n\"Tom Hardy is currently one of the biggest talents in the film industry, and he has a phenomenal ability to take on complex and varied roles with his broad range of acting skills,\" said Jean-Julien Baronnet, CEO of Ubisoft Motion Pictures. \"His involvement in the Tom Clancys Splinter Cell movie is exciting news for movie and video game fans alike. Meanwhile, Eric Singer is one of the most talented writers of the moment, and ... were confident hell bring a fresh approach and create a thrilling story ... while still respecting all the codes and traditions of the franchise that are so important to fans.\"\n\nSource: www.ign.com"
