        "text": "ShareCompleted\n\nCivilwarfare101\n\n60%PC\n\n7h Played\n\nSplinter Cell Conviction, this was a game I hadn't played in so long and when I played it all those years ago, I remember not being a big fan of it. After playing the game all these years later, I still don't think the game is that great, at best I consider it to be mediocre with some good moment here and there when I mean good moments, I mainly just mean one level which is 3rd Echelion HQ. I'll get more into that later.\n\nI'll start with what I dislike, the game simpily can't decide whether it wants to be a cover based shooter or a stealth game. What really hold the game back for me is the level design, and it's not even because it's linear, after all pasts SCs were linear, but what makes Conviction's levels so sub par is the fact that they feel like cover based shooter arenas where the game makes deceptively makes you feel like you could sneak your way through and it is possible to, but only after getting spotted and the enemies paying so much attention to your last known position to the point where you can slip away from them, at that point, I am not sure if I was supposed to engage in a cover based shootout or that in fact had an option to sneak past them. It's hard to tell since the level design bottlenecks you so hard that it feels like you are going to get spotted no matter what. I dislike the lack of any gadgets or anything non lethal since all the gadgets you do get are offensive items which makes me even more confused about the level design. So many of the levels consist of linear straight line hallways covered with guards, and there is so many of them to the point where it feels like you are eventually going to get caught and then play the game as a cover based shooter with inaccurate weapons. The infamous level in Iraq I found to be the most honest level in the game since by that point it isn't even hiding the fact that the game is a cover based shooter and it's fully embracing that side of the gameplay. The mark and execute another infamous aspect about the game, I find to be more of a novelty if anything, I am guessing Ubisoft wanted to make you feel like a badass action movie hero where they instantly kill an enemy super fast with quick reflexing but it feels novel considering it only works if you are in stealth and you need to quickly kill enemies since the weapons in this game are super inaccurate, and that what makes the cover based shootouts so frustrating since your weapons lack any kind of accuracy, it makes the human shield mechanic worthless a lot of the time since getting headshots is unreliable so you better hope body shots kills them fast enough. There is also an over reliance on setpieces more so than other SCs and it leads to a rather uneven campaign.\n\nBefore I talk about that, I want to say that the 3rd Echelion HQ mission is one of the better missions in the game, the level design actually encourages you to play steath, and it feels possible to sneak past them with much more open areas and less guards around every corner, the level starts with no alerts and it works well since you are given multiple ways to approach the area. There is still some scripted moments here and there, but evading guards eventually getting Sonar goggles and avoiding laser grids feels so awesome and good since evasion feels possible and it adds some situational depth. The unlimited mark and execute feels somewhat earned after all the sneaking you did, so it feels cathartic to let loose.\n\nThis leads to both the game's greatest strength and weakness: the length. Many deride Conviction for it's short length but I argue it's a strength since the game ends before the frustration truly starts sets in and the game never truly overstays it's welcome to the point where the aforementioned issues would make really dislike the game, but at the same time, it's a weakness since the level design is mostly just setpieces and confused cover based stealth rooms. Since the game has many scripted sequences, how is the story?\n\nIt's okay but it feels very derivative of action movies and it feels like Ubisoft was trying hard to make their own action movie in game form. My big issue is that Ubisoft had to play along with the events of Double Agent even though it seems like deep down they seem to regret killing off Lambert and they didn't have much of a plan. Like how Tom Reed and the 3rd Echelion mole comes out of nowhere and never gets mentioned in Double Agent from what I remember. That they \"retconned\" Sarah's death so they can give Sam a reason to fight again and it all feels forced or the addition of Victor Coaste. It's not a terrible story since Micheal Ironside carries much of the material to make it bearable, the story in general is like, \"well let's try our best to continue off what little Double Agent gave us\".\n\nOverall while I don't outright dislike it, I can see why many would, it's easy to say it's a downgrade from Chaos Theory, but as a game itself it's not that great because of it's confused design.\n\nShareCompleted\n\nPrivate\n\n50%PC\n\nReplay\n\nConviction marks a major turning point for Splinter Cell as a series. It's all about action now, stealth is no where to be seen. The tone and storytelling are also going for something entirely different. I'm okay with these changes, stagnation leads to less interesting art, change is good. But this game fails at being a good action game, it's just an okay one.\n\nThe big thing with this game is it's mark and execute system. Get a melee takedown and you can mark and instantly kill two to four enemies. it's flashy and looks great. I can see what they were going for, but many levels fail to differentiate themselves as there isn't a lot of enemy variety and the AI isn't very smart. Gone are the days of sneaking around the levels, thinking long and hard about how you approach each situation. Now you run in, get some kills, and find a shadow to hide in to not get overwhelmed. The last-seen silhouette effect is a nice touch, makes it very clear where the AI thinks you are. And subsequently easy to get caught and flank around enemies for an easy surprise attack.\n\nThe core movement and shooting feels great to me. The guns are a little too inaccurate and moving between cover is simple but a little too dangerous at times but everything works. Splinter Cell never felt like a visceral action game and now it does. The big issue is there's just not much depth, the game's mechanics only have enough millage for a few levels, but there's like 10, even if they're all short. Because there's not much to the gameplay, there's a stronger focus on set pieces and story beats, neither of which are a standout for the action genre.\n\nAs for the story, I'll start with what I liked. I think it's a interesting direction to take Sam Fisher, a traditionally calm and collected character, and make him *unhinged*. But the rage doesn't feel justified here. We didn't know his daughter, and his reasons for suspecting foul play at her death are never even explained. He got close to the truth and now people are after him to shut him up. The reveal about why his daughter was killed is almost non-sensical, it's just not something that makes sense if you think about it for 5 seconds. I think this whole story would work much better if Sarah was murdered haphazardly for unimportant reasons. Make her death a tragedy, and Sam's action filled revenge a direct \"you hurt me now I hurt you\". The Jason Bourne-esque conspiracy angle is at odds with the direction of the some of the cutscenes—how angry and unhinged Sam is. Ironside really brings the character to life and it's a shame the writing can't match him. The Aesthetics are great, the huge text overlaid in the environment as part of Sam's Psyche could have been used to great effect if the story was a little better. Missed potential in my opinion.\n\nI don't mind this game, even some of the thing others hate like the black and white effect when you're supposedly unseen, I think the visual tone as a whole is pretty good. I'm not sure how I would rank my experience in comparison to the other Splinter Cell games. Chaos Theory is by far my favorite but I'm not all that taken by the others, especially Double Agent. Conviction ends up somewhere around \"fine\" with it's decent gunplay but underwhelming depth and narrative."
