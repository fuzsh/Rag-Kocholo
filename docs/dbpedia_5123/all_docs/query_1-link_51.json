        "text": "The movie adaptation of ‘Splinter Cell’, the Ubisoft developed video game, is moving ahead with reports that Doug Liman is in final negotiations to direct. ‘Splinter Cell’ is a stealth video game where players control agent Sam Fisher, a highly trained special operative in a fictional black-ops division known as Fourth Echelon. Together he and his team subvert international threats from terrorists.\n\nUbisoft created its screen division, Ubisoft Motion Pictures, in 2011 in order to bring its video games to the big screen. It is also currently developing feature films based on ‘Assassin’s Creed‘, ‘Far Cry’ and ‘Watch Dogs’ with New Regency.\n\n‘Splinter Cell’ first debuted in 2002. Five other installments have appeared since with a sixth one, ‘Tom Clancy’s Splinter Cell Blacklist’, released in spring 2013. According to Ubisoft more than 23 million units of the game have sold to date. A seventh ‘Splinter Cell’ title, ‘The Division’ is due for release later this year.\n\nTom Hardy has been attached to star in the feature which is due to begin production in August and is scheduled for a 2015 release.\n\nBasil Iwanyk of Thunder Road Pictures and Jean-Julien Baronnet of Ubisoft Motion Picture Group are set to produce. Liman will also be producing along with his partner, David Bartis.\n\nLiman’s attachment now brings the project one step closer to reality. ‘Splinter Cell’ was previously in development at DreamWorks and Paramount and at one point Peter Berg was attached to direct.\n\nDoug Liman, is best known for directing the action movies ‘Mr. and Mrs. Smith’, ‘Jumper’ and ‘The Bourne Identity’."
