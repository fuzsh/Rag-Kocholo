This is a file name for a compressed version of the game Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell and its expansion pack Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Mission-Pack, which were released for PC in 2002 and 2003 respectively. The game was developed by Ubisoft Montreal and published by Ubisoft, and it is based on the novel series by Tom Clancy. The game follows the adventures of Sam Fisher, a covert operative working for a secret branch of the NSA called Third Echelon.

This is usually done to make the game easier to download and install, but it may also affect the quality and performance of the game. The file name also includes the word dopeman, which is the alias of a well-known uploader of ripped games on various torrent sites. Dopeman has uploaded many popular games such as Hitman 2: Silent Assassin, Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne, and Mass Effect 1 and 2. However, downloading ripped games from torrent sites may expose you to legal risks, malware, and viruses, so you should be careful and use a reliable antivirus software.\n\n[PC] Splinter Cell [Mission Pack] [RIP] [dopeman]"
