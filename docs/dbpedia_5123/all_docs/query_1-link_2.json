        "text": "Splinter Cell is an upcoming action/suspense film currently in development by Ubisoft Motion Pictures and published by New Regency Productions. The film will star Tom Hardy as Sam Fisher.\n\nPlot[]\n\nThe storyline was revealed to follow a younger Sam Fisher, but no other details have been released so far.[1]\n\nDevelopment[]\n\nThe first existence of a movie in pre-production had been confirmed by both news sources and the inclusion of a teaser trailer in the Platinum Hits Edition, Collectors Edition, and the European Edition of Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory. Originally, Peter Berg, director of the 2004 film Friday Night Lights, was slated to direct/produce while Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell video game scriptwriter J.T. Petty was slated to write, along with John J. McLaughlin.\n\nJ.T. Petty and Peter Berg left the project in summer 2005 and the project shifted from Paramount Pictures to DreamWorks. Not long after, however, Viacom, the parent of Paramount Pictures, purchased DreamWorks. Since then, there has been no updated information on the film, and production is considered to be in development hell. Along with Splinter Cell, a Rainbow Six film was supposed to be in development alongside Splinter Cell but was also halted.\n\nIt was announced in 2012 that Tom Hardy, known from his role as Bane in The Dark Knight Rises, will be playing Sam Fisher in the adaptation.[2] On November 14, 2012, Eric Singer will be writing the film.[3] On June 10, 2013, Ubisoft announced that they'll be working with New Regency to make the film. Basil Iwanyk will be producing the film through his production company Thunder Road.[4] On March 19, 2014, The Hollywood Reporter has reported that Doug Liman is in final negotiations to direct and also Jean-Julien Baronnet and Liman's producing partner David Bartis are producing the film.[5] On March 31, 2014 Sheldon Turner was set to write a new draft for the film.[6] According to the director Doug Liman, it will star a younger Sam Fisher.[1] In April 2015 Liman withdrew from the project.[7] In October 2015, Tom Hardy stated on Twitter that Splinter Cell will begin filming early 2016 and be relased sometime in 2017. However, as of now, the film has still not been released."
