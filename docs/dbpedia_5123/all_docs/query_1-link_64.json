        "text": "Today, Ubisoft and New Regency announced that they are partnering on the forthcoming Tom Clancy?s Splinter Cell film.\n\nUbisoft Motion Pictures, the film and television division of Ubisoft, will develop the Splinter Cell movie in close collaboration with New Regency. Ubisoft also recently announced it attached award-winning actor Tom Hardy and up-and-coming screenwriter Eric Warren Singer (?The International?) to the film.\n\n?With actor Tom Hardy attached and screenwriter Eric Warren Singer to write the script, Ubisoft Motion Pictures will lead the development with the support of New Regency to bring the franchise to the big screen in a dynamic way,? said Jean-Julien Baronnet, chief executive officer, Ubisoft Motion Pictures. ?For Ubisoft Motion Pictures, creative control is key and New Regency shares our commitment to respecting the creative freedom of our team. Their ability to produce both blockbusters and intriguing indie hits is an ideal fit for the Splinter Cell franchise.?\n\n?We could not be happier to be teaming up with our friends at Ubisoft Motion Pictures on yet another truly iconic title. With a movie star like Tom Hardy in place and a gifted writer such as Eric Warren Singer penning the screenplay, we know the fans will not be let down,? said New Regency CEO and President, Brad Weston.\n\nThis deal is separate from but builds upon the recent partnership between Ubisoft and New Regency to develop the Assassin?s Creed film.\n\nTom Clancy?s Splinter Cell is an award-winning stealth action video game series that has sold more than 23 million copies since its debut in 2002. Splinter Cell follows protagonist Sam Fisher, a highly-trained special operative in a fictional black-ops sub-division, ?Echelon?. Sam Fisher and the agents of Echelon utilize combat skills, weapons and cutting-edge gadgets to neutralize international terrorist threats and rogue forces in modern, realistic stories ripped from the headlines. Development for the next installment, Tom Clancy?s Splinter Cell Blacklist, is being led by the Ubisoft Toronto studio, and the game is set for release in Spring 2013.\n\nUbisoft Motion Pictures was created in January 2011 to expand the audience of Ubisoft?s successful video game brands by bringing them to film, television and Web series. In addition to the Tom Clancy?s Splinter Cell film, the studio is also partnering with New Regency on the upcoming film based on the Assassin?s Creed franchise, and is in production on the Rabbids TV series, a collection of 78 seven-minute CGI episodes based on the insane stars of the video game franchise of the same name, in partnership with France Televisions and Nickelodeon."
