        "text": "Within 24 hours (until 14:00 UTC on 9th August), everyone can get the isometric tactical shooter Intravenous for free on GOG.\n\nThe promotion coincides with the upcoming release of the second part of Intravenous, which studio Explosive Squat Games will release on 16 August on GOG and Steam. There is also a 10% discount on pre-orders of the new game.\n\nIntravenous is built around the concept of things going wrong. It’s a top-down stealth game where every movement can lead to disaster, with light, sound, and other factors being your constant enemies. The tension is palpable, and unlike most stealth games where getting caught might result in a game over, in Intravenous, discovery ramps up the action, turning it into a grittier, more intense experience akin to Hotline Miami.\n\nDeveloper Explosive Squat Games emphasizes that stealth is just one aspect of Intravenous—there are plenty of action-packed shootouts to dive into if you choose. Much like in the rebooted Wolfenstein series, stealth is merely one tool in your arsenal, and when you step out of the shadows, the intense blasting begins.\n\nSo, what we have here is a blend of Splinter Cell’s approach to stealth, Hotline Miami-like combat, interactive options reminiscent of an immersive sim like Dishonored, and a story that harks back to games like Max Payne. All of this makes Intravenous a hefty experience that should keep you engaged for a long time."
