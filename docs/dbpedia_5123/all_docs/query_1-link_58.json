        "text": "Bidding on the rights to turn the hit Ubisoft video game series, Tom Clancy’s Splinter Cell, into a movie has heated up.\n\nIt’s being reported that Paramount Pictures is having chats with Ubisoft about the property, and they are the current frontrunner to score the rights. Warner Brothers also appears to be interested if things don’t work out with Paramount.\n\nAnd speaking of Paramount, they would make the most sense as they already have other Tom Clancy projects in the works. Kenneth Branagh is directing a reboot of the popular Jack Ryan series, and an adaptation of Clancy spin-off Without Remorse is also being developed.\n\nThe Splinter Cell series follows Sam Fisher, a man who knows how to get things done, and the special NSA division he works for, known as Third Echelon. The games rely heavily on stealth and skill, as you maneuver through high security and put down swarms of guards…usually well before anyone knows what hit them. An exciting gameplay demo for the latest chapter in the game series, titled Blacklist, was just shown off at E3.\n\nI don’t know about you fine folks, but Sam Fisher is a special agent I can get behind. Keep your Jason Bourne."
