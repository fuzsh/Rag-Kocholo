        "text": "Aka unfinished business. I got Splinter Cell on release in 2002 and made it as far as the CIA level before getting frustrated and giving up. But with a decade of stealth action experience under my belt, I figured I now finally had the skills to finally finish it.\n\nIt’s an interesting game, both obviously inspired by the Metal Gear franchise while doing its best to carve its own sneaky path. Caution and patience are the keys to success, with the game requiring players to move as slowly and silently as possible through the dark and avoid directly confronting the enemy whenever they can.\n\nLike most stealth games, the gameplay only really clicks when you puzzle out the AI mechanics: what the enemies can hear, what they can see and how they will react in certain situations. Once you know this you can flit between the shadows and gradually dispatch or avoid them. Even so, their behaviour is pleasingly analogue and though the odd slip-up can have you gnashing your teeth at the game’s strict checkpoint system they react in believably human ways.\n\nBut I still definitely prefer my tactical espionage action to be more in the ‘ nuclear equipped walking death mobile’, ‘man covered in bees’ and ‘possessed arm’ variety. Splinter Cell‘s story is barely there, with your typically Clancyish bunkum about evil Georgians (why is it always Georgians in these games?) and Chinese army conspiracies.\n\nIt’s a bad story told badly, with hero Sam Fisher unaffected by the villain’s actions and for the most part only peripherally involved in a jingoistic plot mainly told via news bulletins. By the finale the bad guys don’t even know who the hell he is, and while Michael Ironside’s voice-acting does some real heavy-lifting when it comes to characterisation, neither do we. He’s gruff and professional and that’s about it.\n\nIn most games such simplified characterisation and crappy plotting doesn’t really matter, but the nature of stealth games means you spend a lot of time waiting around for the guards to be in just the right place. In a Metal Gear game you can spend that downtime thinking through the Byzantine plot. In Splinter Cell you’re just kinda sat there.\n\nBut I did enjoy myself. This was a playthrough of the original Xbox Splinter Cell, but on the strength of this I picked up the PS3 HD editions of Pandora Tomorrow and Chaos Theory, and I got Double Agent and Conviction for a quid each for Xbox 360. Here’s hoping we learn more about Fisher as the series develops."
