        "text": "It's generally well-known that when making a video game that stands the test of time graphically, a stylized look will almost always look better. Okami, and Wind Waker are possibly the two most well-known examples of this. Most older games going for a realistic style will inevitably age, and I think that's still gonna hold true for this generation to at least some degree.\n\nSome games are exceptions, though, as the title suggests.\n\nI think some of the best examples are the Resident Evil Remake from 2001...\n\nAs well as Ninja Gaiden from 2004.\n\nWhile neither of these games could pass off as current-gen, and have plenty of dated aspects in terms graphically, they still look pretty decent, even today.\n\nAre there any other examples?\n\nAs you said, REmake still looks great, but so does RE0 for the same reason, even if the game itself isn't nearly as good. That's kind of cheating though since they were using incredible looking prerendered backgrounds that were not possible to create in real-time, so of course they would age better.\n\nWracking my brain trying to think of anything that was going for the dull \"green, gray and brown\" of last gen that has aged well, and drawing a blank. The last game that mostly holds up I think might be Half-Life 2. By default it's not exactly \"ugly\", but I normally play it with the modded assets and it looks way better.\n\nNinja Gaiden wasn't even really about screen-shots to me the most impressive thing is that it looked that good and performed basically flawlessly, fluid as anything I've ever played, a screen full of demons to chop up and it never skips a beat\n\nNinja Gaiden wasn't even really about screen-shots to me the most impressive thing is that it looked that good and performed basically flawlessly, fluid as anything I've ever played, a screen full of demons to chop up and it never skips a beat\n\nThe human characters were all on the more realistic side for a video game at the time, and seemed like they were from an incredibly good looking Virtua Fighter or Tekken.\n\nThe human characters were all on the more realistic side for a video game at the time, and seemed like they were from an incredibly good looking Virtua Fighter or Tekken.\n\nI'm sure you meant to quote that guy right before me, i agree with you certainly\n\nI'm sure you meant to quote that guy right before me, i agree with you certainly\n\nSort of, but it was more of a general reply about realism, and your own comment on the main reason you thought the game was great wasn't focused on how it looked. At the same time, the overall look of the game wasn't going for realism at all. Mainly just the human character models. I don't recall every location either, but the village area looked real enough to me back then, especially for a video game during that period.\n\nSort of, but it was more of a general reply about realism, and your own comment on the main reason you thought the game was great wasn't focused on how it looked.

And the enemies, but the Ryu character model for example would fit in fine in a typical 'realistic' setting\n\nThe Metroid Prime games (especially Prime 3) are the ones that first came to mind for me. There are some aspects of their visuals that are dated, sure, but they still hold up pretty well overall. There were some pretty neat things they did that still impress me to this day (all of the visor effects, like rain, reflections, and fog, are good examples)."
