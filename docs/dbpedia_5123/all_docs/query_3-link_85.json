        "text": "Released: November 17, 2002\n\nRe-released: September 16, 2011 (This is what I review)\n\nOverview:\n\nA dying breed, Splinter Cell has changed over the years. The first games were focused on pure stealth and this is the game that started the saga. It’s up to Sam Fisher to take on the secret operations of a government branch. Stealth is definitely the focus here so it isn’t for everyone. While revolutionary for its time, does is still hold up today?\n\nGameplay:\n\nPure stealth is the name of the game here. The original title for this game Splinter Cell: Stealth Action Redefined. Since it was originally released in 2002, it was pretty revolutionary for its time. The only major stealth games of that time were Thief and Metal Gear. Moving the genre forward into the next generation, Splinter Cell emerged from the crowd.\n\nWhen you think of stealth, you think of shadows; Splinter Cell is full of them. Use the shadows to avoid or incapacitate guards as you make your way through the levels. One thing that this game brought to the table was the use of dynamic lighting. A new feature to the gaming industry at the time, it is possible to shoot lights to create pockets in the light to slip through and places to hide bodies.\n\nOn the note of shooting, you are given a pistol in most missions; this pistol is later upgraded for a better weapon. This better weapon has the ability to incapacitate guards non-lethally using various attachments. Bullets should only be used on cameras or lights, rarely should it be used for people. This is not because they are useless, but because they are inefficient. It takes around 6 bullets to take out a guard unless you shoot them in the head, plus it leaves a body trail which just makes the game harder in general. It’s best to slip through with the least amount of mayhem possible.\n\nThe game is broken down into 10 different missions, each with their own objectives. There may be certain stipulations to these missions such as don’t sound any alarms (don’t get seen) or don’t kill anyone (obvious). The game gets more difficult as it goes, but there are some weird difficulty spikes in certain missions. These come in the form of a few forced combat areas. The controls are clunky when it comes to quickly getting into combat, as you have to hit the R2 button to draw your gun or put it away. The aiming reticle is a joke, shooting anything with the pistol is a chore and Sam won’t hit anything that isn’t point blank range unless you’re lucky. The other weapon has a sniper mode which fairs better, but it isn’t made for rapid fire.\n\nThere are also bugs that tend to plague this game. There are many moments of frame rate drops and outright freezes, though left alone the freezes aren’t permanent. The trophies are also bugged. Running through this game as a completionist is a real chore, having to replay the game multiple times if a trophy doesn’t want to unlock. There was also a weird glitch I had some people die when I was trying not to kill anyone simply by moving their bodies too far from where I knocked them out. Not ok.\n\nThe graphics for this game have been redone in the HD version to smooth out some of the blocky textures and make everything appear well… smoother. It pays off and helps the game look like a newer release, but you can definitely tell its an older game. The game feels like it tries to be a little vibrant and colorful, but you really don’t get to see any of that. Since the point of the game is to stay in shadow as often as you can, you’ll be spending most of the game looking through your night vision. It’s a necessary to make it through most of the game as it is highly dark to make stealthing easier.\n\nStory:\n\nTypical story when talking about saving the world from some type of terrorist action. The one thing I enjoy about this take on it, however, is the fact that you aren’t on the front lines. It is Sam’s job to gather intelligence to help our armies, instead of the player being the army. Spying is always a good time.\n\nSpoiler time: Highlight the white space for the story.\n\nSam is taken from retirement to star as lead spy for a new branch of the NSA known as Third Echelon. After passing the stealth tests you are sent to Georgia (the country, not the state) to hunt down two missing FBI agents. One agent was in the new president of Georgia (Kombayn Nikoladze)’s cabinet. The agents are tracked down in morgue. It is found that they were killed and had their tracking chips removed by a man named Vyacheslav Grinko, who works for Nikoladze.\n\nThe next stop for Sam is the Georgian defense ministry to try and find out why this FBI agent was killed. After sifting through Nikoladze’s computer all hell breaks loose. Nikoladze has been using his new found power to invade Azerbaijan for oil. Off to an oil rig. Data is obtained from a programmer stationed at the oil rig that shows there is a leak in the CIA and helps stop a cyber attack from happening on the US. Sam infiltrates the CIA and finds the mole, taking him in for interrogation.\n\nWhile tracking down the mole you learn of a programmer that has an encryption key that can help decode an email that would help find the location of Nikoladze, who has declared war on the united states. During the extraction from the mission, one of Sam’s team members is killed. The encryption key shows that Nikoladze is in Myanmar at the Chinese embassy.\n\nWhile invading the embassy, Sam discovers that a group of american soldiers is set to be executed at a local abattoir with the help of a Chinese general. Sam is tasked with saving them and does so brilliantly, killing Grinko in the process. He learns that the general, general Hong Ferong, is acting outside the will of China.He then returns to the Chinese embassy to recover data to back this up and subdue Ferong. He is successful. Nikoladze escapes and a new president takes reign in Georgia, one who is more friendly to the US.\n\nRumors of Nikoladze appearing at the presidential palace in Georgia crop up and Sam is tasked with infiltration. Rumors have also been floating around about something called the Ark. While in the palace, it is learned that the Ark is a bomb and it’s in the palace, in a safe in the basement that can only be opened with Nikoladze’s retina. Sam intercepts Nikoladze and uses him to access the presidential safe when all hell breaks loose (again). The new Georgian president betrays the US and Nikoladze and demands the Ark. Turns out the Ark is in the US and Nikoladze will lead the bad guys to it if they let him walk away. Same escapes the basement and snipes Nikoladze. He escapes the palace and the US tracks down and disarms the Ark. End of game. Hooray!\n\nEnd Spoilers\n\nFinal thoughts/My Experience:\n\nThe overall experience with this was decent. I loved this game as a kid, but it hasn’t aged as gracefully as some game. Framerate dips and freezes are annoyances and the trophy glitches are unacceptable. It’s also worth noting that this is just a remake of the xbox version of the game. There was a level released for the PS2 version that would have been nice to have included here. It was laziness on Ubisoft’s part for not including a complete game here.\n\nThe story to this game is fairly good and engaging. Being a spy is always great fun, but the abundance of glitches stop this from being an amazing game. Still worth a look though.\n\nScore:\n\n5.5/10"
