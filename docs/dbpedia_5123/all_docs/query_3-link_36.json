        "text": "Splinter Cell fans, here is something special for you today. YouTube’s ‘skurtyyskirts’ has shared a video, showcasing the classic Splinter Cell game with a WIP RTX Remix Path Tracing Mod.\n\nThe modder has used PBRify_Upscaler to add normal and roughness maps. As such, this WIP Mod looks better than most of the previous RTX Remix Mods we’ve shared.\n\nNow what’s really cool here is that the video has some Before/After shots. These shots showcase perfectly the benefits of Path Tracing. And, as you will see, the lighting can completely change when using PT.\n\nSince this is a WIP project, it does not really showcase the full benefits of RTX Remix. Not only that but there are some missing light sources. Take a look at 2:05. In that area, the devs added a fake light source (mainly for gameplay purposes). With the RTX Remix Mod, we get a more realistic lighting but this fake light source is nowhere to be found to highlight the path area.\n\nIn short, for a “first step”, this RTX Remix Mod looks really cool. However, it still needs a lot of work. So, let’s hope that the modder will put more work into it.\n\nFor those wondering, this mod is not yet available for download. So no, you can’t – yet – play Splinter Cell with this kind of graphics.\n\nThese past few months we’ve shared a lot of RTX Remix Mods for various games. In January 2023, we shared several RTX Remix Mods that are in the works. As such, you can take a look at screenshots and videos for Tomb Raider 2, Grand Theft Auto: Vice City, Manhunt, and Garfield Kart RTX Remix. Then, in February 2024, we shared videos for Need for Speed: Most Wanted, Unreal, Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 4 and Midnight Club 2. And then, in March 2024, shared the first screenshots from the RTX Remix Mod for Vampire The Masquerade: Bloodlines, as well as videos for Fallout: New Vegas RTX and Half-Life RTX.\n\nSpeaking of Path Tracing Mods for older titles, you might also want to check out the following ones. Modders released demos for their Path Tracing Mods for Deus Ex, Tomb Raider, Max Payne and Call of Duty 4. Do note that the COD4 Mod is a “proof of concept” demo, and it does not look that great. On the other hand, the RTX Remix Mod for Max Payne looks amazing (at least in my opinion). Let’s also not forget the RTX Remix for COD: WoW. And then we have the RTX Remix Mods for the first and the second NFS: Underground games. Oh, and don’t forget to give a go at this RTX Remix for Unreal Tournament 2004. Finally, you can download Path Tracing Mods for Doom 2, Quake, and Serious Sam.\n\nFinally, I’ve added below two additional videos. The first one shows off Sonic Adventure with RTX Remix Path Tracing. And on the other hand, the second video gives us another look at Tomb Raider 2 with RTX Remix.\n\nEnjoy and stay tuned for more!"
