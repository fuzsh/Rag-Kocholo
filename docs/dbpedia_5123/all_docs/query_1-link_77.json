        "text": "This past summer, studios were said to be battling over the rights to Ubisoft's popular video game franchise Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell. However, the property still hasn't found a studio home despite ongoing talks with Warner Bros. and Paramount Pictures. But the project just gained a huge amount of steam today as Variety report Tom Hardy has signed on to star in the adaptation with The International writer Eric Warren Singer scripting. The film will have Hardy playing Sam Fisher highly-trained special operative in a fictional black-ops operation called Echelon. It definitely sounds better than his action in This Means War.\n\nIn the video game, Fisher is aided by trifocal goggles which use both night vision and thermal readings, allowing him to see in the dark. It's just one of the many tools and skills Fisher has at his disposal to bring down the bad guys. Ubisoft is quickly getting their video games to the big screen after establishing their own film branch in 2011. Assassin's Creed is already moving forward with Michael Fassbender both starring and producing. Of course, getting big names talents is hardly a guarantee for a worthy video game adaptation. Let's not forget that Tomb Raider had Angelina Jolie, and it still wasn't all that great. But Hardy is one of the biggest actors in Hollywood right now, and this will get a lot of fans interested."
