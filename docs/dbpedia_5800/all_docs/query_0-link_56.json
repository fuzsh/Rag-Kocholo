        "text": "November’s YOA review is here! Devilman Crybaby made waves when it aired in 2018, and after watching it I can definitely say that it was impactful in both good and bad ways. Let’s take a look at what this anime has to offer and what on earth to make of it!\n\nDevilman Crybaby follows the story of childhood friends Akira and Ryo brought together after years apart through Ryo’s research into demons that are starting to creep up in Japan. After attending a rave party, Ryo incites the demon Amon to inhabit Akira’s body, creating a ‘Devilman’, a demon with a human heart. Struggling to control his heightened abilities and his agency alongside Ryo, Akira defends and endangers those around him as a demon apocalypse swallows everything he knows. Devilman, started in 1972, is an ongoing and popular franchise that has several manga and TV series under its belt already, however this mini series stands out in its exclusive availability on Netflix. Devilman Crybaby reimagines the story of Devilman outside of its many adaptations into something more or less self-contained.\n\nOuter Skins, Inner Demons\n\nDevilman Crybaby features characters that are not explored for their personalities or their circumstances per se. Instead, the role of its characters is always to push them to the extreme and bring out human behaviour, good and bad. The characters all deal with issues of self worth, desire for truth, repression of sexuality, and an overall moral dilemma that lurks in every facet of the show. Characters in Devilman Crybaby understand that something is wrong in the world and growing worse, but it’s unclear to them exactly how and why that is until it’s too late.\n\nDemons taking over human bodies serves as a handy visual for the identity and morality crisis at work in the characters of Devilman Crybaby. Letting go and giving into desires is the crux of many of the characters’ transformations that make way for their demon forms (Miko is one of the best examples here). By the end of the series, people are no longer sure who’s human and who’s demon. Shedding skin to reveal such visceral realities is key to understanding the impact of the series, which is both genius and a bit baited, since the revealing of horrors seen through Akira’s idealistic eyes gives the show a sense of hope at extreme cost to everything else.\n\nMusic and Style\n\nDevilman Crybaby features some interesting style and sound choices, the first being rap and hip hop mixed into the score. Many of the raps happen within the world of the series (diegetic sound), and gives the series a rebellious, youthful tone. The raps included in Devilman Crybaby help the show feel its consequences and help characters reason out the world they live in. It also did a great job of masking much darker truths with catchy tunes.\n\nOther artistic choices such as the heavy ink blot imagery in the OP added to the attention to different outlooks on the world that the anime so heavily wrestles with. The flat and slightly abstract art style helped make Devilman Crybaby feel more like its own thing, not just a retelling of the original. In fact, it might be the new animation style the project took on that made it feel more and more like a psychedelic drug trip as demons continued to infest Akira’s social circles. That’s not to say that the art was always an artistic treat –at some points it could be quite derpy. However it does fit the story of a tragic fall and redemption in humanity that Devilman Crybaby aims to tell.\n\nContent Warning: The Whole Show\n\nDevilman Crybaby is NOT pleasant to watch. It’s graphic, disgusting (if I’m being completely honest), and very troubling. I wouldn’t even know who to recommend this anime to since it’s so far out of what I’m comfortable watching. Its treatment of sexually explicit content and gore were used to tell the reader “deep” truths about the universe and human nature – however Devilman Crybaby is almost entirely graphic content with little comment on these truths for the most part. For the first 3/4 of the show, sexual content and nudity run rampant and are mostly unnecessary, but this is suddenly replaced by despairing, tragic, and gory scenes for the last 1/4. Needless to say, this anime constantly put me in places I didn’t wish to be.\n\nDespite all of these warnings, Devilman Crybaby does hit on some interesting points thanks to its graphic content. It focuses, much like Paranoia Agent, on the underlying anxieties of humanity played off as bravado, only to have it all crumble away. However, Devilman Crybaby, like Evangelion, included a whole alternate origins story for the universe, pushing it beyond simple social pressure and identity and widening the impact so much it made my head hurt from the implications. The final episode makes the whole show worth it, but this is a tall order to give someone who isn’t comfortable with watching this sort of thing, myself included.\n\n“Please Be Somewhere”\n\nOverall, Devilman Crybaby offered some intense moments of reflection and reasoning for me as I watched. While I was strongly put off by the amount of excess in each episode, the overall story was thrilling and asked some very cutting questions of its audience. Acting as a sort of alternate history with a ton of inspiration from Paradise Lost, Devilman Crybaby places morality in the greyest of zones I have ever seen. The Devil cries, and the world is judged and made new. I feel odd spoiling the last episode of the series, so I won’t do that too much here –however, it is easily the most hard-hitting and thought-provoking episode by a long shot. Faith, the universe, violence, love, etc are all called upon and wrap up the story in a neat yet chaotic bow that makes the series feel like its events could repeat indefinitely if you choose to take that on and watch it all over again.\n\nIn the final episode, Ryo (revealed in his true form) begs Akira to “please be somewhere”, and that line really stuck with me as I wrote this review. Devilman Crybaby offers this alternate interpretation of the world as we know it from the dinosaurs to the present day. Unlike any other anime I’ve seen (at least up until now, it had always been Evangelion for me) Devilman Crybaby asked me where I stood in this new story. What type of world did I see and what were its nuances? Where exactly was I in this alternate timeline? To what extent was everything in this anime justified? Devilman Crybaby was really convicting in that way, and it was my main takeaway after finishing the show, even after all of the sex, gore, and style."
