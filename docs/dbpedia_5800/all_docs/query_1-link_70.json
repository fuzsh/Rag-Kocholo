        "text": "Every once in a while, I come across an anime title that starts off normal, and then completely subverts expectations.\n\nAnd Devilman Crybaby does that in a good way. No Trigger twist at the last minute. This one knows what the audience expects, says “Nah, we’re not doing that,” and gradually dials it up to 11 over the course of the anime.\n\nAnd it all begins with Fudo Akira, a regular high schooler, who one day gets possessed by a demon. Yet, due to his unusual willpower, Akira manages to subdue the demon within him and wield its abilities, becoming a Devilman: the form of a demon, with the heart of a human.\n\nBecause a core theme is a human’s base desires, expect a lot of violence, drug, and sexual depictions, and I do mean a LOT.\n\nDevilman Crybaby is a series based on the original Devilman manga series. Even the original Devilman themes are prominently featured in the anime.\n\nFrom the costumes,\n\nto even a remix of the original Devilman theme.\n\nIts soundtrack list has some other choice themes as well, such as the “D.V.M.N”.\n\nOh yeah, a few characters really like spitting verses, full-on rap verses for multiple minutes.\n\nThe art style switches from minimalistic to detailed when needed, which is rather interesting. Even with minimalistic animation, the combat still seems vivid, almost as if it paints the picture and the viewer fills in the gaps with their wild imagination, which is neat. Other times, it portrays just what it needs to, e.g using black-and-white silhouettes.\n\nThe gore is less pronounced because of said minimalistic animation. Akira’s strength is displayed by how easily he can rip demons apart, as if they were paper.\n\nYet, when the shots get detailed, they get vivid.\n\nDespite only having 10 episodes, I’d say the pacing of the anime is pretty good. It starts out with Akira’s childhood friend, Asuka Ryo, randomly shows up out of nowhere and tells him about a discovery he made,one that would lead to him proving that demons area real. Ryo then drives down this dark highway in his sleek car narrating his discovery. The aspect of mystery is a good segue into the plot.\n\nFrom the get-go, Ryo’s motives seem rather off, when he asks a demon to possess Akira.\n\nThis also alludes to the potential rivalry hinted at in the opening theme.\n\nAs Akira, Ryo, and the others uncover more about this mystery, characters straight-up get wiped out, with no mercy. Plot armour is minimal. Every choice has its consequences, which is one thing I like about this anime. Picking a bold option isn’t always the smartest or safest. It’s not the fault of the characters. They did what they felt was right at the time.\n\nAnd, as per the titles, there’s a lot of crying, and boy does it hit right in the feels every time someone cries.\n\nThe final stretch pulled no stops and no awkward pauses. Just a straight sprint to the finish line, with balls-to-the-wall action all the way through.\n\nIf you want something that doesn’t miss a beat, Devilman Crybaby may up your alley. 10 episodes laced with mystery, violence, sex, tragedy, and inner conflict. It was quite the trip."
