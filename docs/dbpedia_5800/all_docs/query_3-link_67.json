        "text": "Devilman Crybaby is an animated series created specifically to celebrate the fifty years of career of one of the personalities who has contributed most to the development of anime and manga culture, both within national borders and in its export all over the world: Go Nagai.\n\nProduced by the collaboration between Aniplex Inc., Dynamic Planning Inc. (a company owned by Nagai himself) and Netflix Inc., the latter also has a license for distribution. The selected staff is top notch. The direction was entrusted to Masaaki Yuasa (The Tatami Galaxy, Ping Pong the Animation), flanked as usual by Choi Eunyoung in the role of executive producer, while the script was written by Ichiro Okouchi (Code Geass: Hangyaku no Lelouch), and music by Kensuke Ushio (Koe no Katachi, Ping Pong the Animation).\n\nSynopsis\n\nDevils cannot take form without a living host. However, if the will of an individual is strong enough, they can overcome the demon and make its power their own, becoming a Devilman.\n\nWeak and unassuming, Akira Fudou has always had a bleeding heart. So when his childhood friend Ryou Asuka asks for his help in uncovering devils, Akira accepts without hesitation. However, to Akira’s surprise, the place they go to is Sabbath: an immoral party of debauchery and degeneracy. Amidst bloodshed and death, demons possess the partiers, turning their bodies into grotesque monsters, and begin wreaking havoc. In a reckless attempt to save his best friend, Akira unwittingly merges with the devil Amon and becomes a Devilman, gaining the power to defeat the remaining demons.\n\nThough it grants him great power, this new partnership awakens an insatiable and primeval part of Akira. Having the body of a devil but the same crybaby heart, Akira works alongside Ryou, destroying those that harm humanity and his loved ones.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n\nCritical review\n\nDevilman Crybaby is strongly inspired by the original Nagai manga written back in 1972. Even better, it is so close to it that it can easily be considered a modern reinterpretation of Nagai‘s work. In fact, the intent of the Yuasa and Okouchi is to “rejuvenate” a work that bears almost fifty years on its shoulders, trying to respect the original version without, however, quelling their creativity. The result is excellent, probably also due to the supervision throughout the creation process of the original author, Go Nagai.\n\nA faithful transposition\n\nIt is renowned as the original animated series of Devilman, broadcast simultaneously with the publication of the manga, was not exactly faithful to Nagai‘s original work. The world of animation was still in its “dawn”, and above all it was aimed exclusively at a very young audience. For this reason, the writing of the anime was entrusted to Masaki Tsuji (Astro Boy, Tiger Man, Doraemon), who, keeping in mind the aforementioned target audience, he decided to completely overturn the work of Nagai, to the point of be eventually considered a completely separate work. In this animated series, not only were excluded many scenes from the original manga, for example those depicting nudity, sex or bloody; but even the appearance of the protagonist Devilman was changed, he was redesigned with more human and less demonic traits. A pity, considering how Nagai was inspired by Gustave Doré‘s illustrations of Dante’s Hell for the creation of Devilman. However, being in the 70s, the choice of Tsuji sensei turns out to be more than understandable.\n\nFor the artistic direction of Devilman Crybaby, Yuasa decides to alter the outdated character design of humans, replacing it with one very similar to that used a short time before for his film Yoake tsugeru Lu no uta. He also decided to merge his characteristic surreal style with the original trait of Nagai for the realization of demons and Devilman himself. The effect is remarkable, especially in rendering the sabbath “ceremony”. In addition, Yuasa leaves intact the bloody aspect of the original work, so much so that the anime is full of violent and bloody scenes. It should also be noted how the director has kept the number of nude scenes within his anime. However, the use that Yuasa makes of them diverges conceptually from the one in Nagai‘s manga. In the latter, sex scenes were mainly used to shape the depraved and immoral nature of demons, while in Devilman Crybaby they are used by Yuasa to clearly mark the lust and sexual desire that leads the human being to become immoral, like the aforementioned demons. This choice by Yuasa is not purely artistic, but it is a tribute to the author Nagai. But I will discuss this matter later in the article.\n\nOkouchi‘s script differs in many places from Nagai‘s original plot. First of all the setting. Devilman Crybaby is set in the present day and not in the 70s, therefore all technology, such as smartphones, are clearly visible and integrated into the plot. In addition to this, Okouchi changes the sequence of events, while keeping intact the highlights of the original plot, such as the Sabbath, the fight with Siren, the witch hunt, and of course also the ending. However Okouchi was not limited to this alone, he introduces totally new elements, such as the athletics team and the characters related to it (Miko and Koda), or the part with Akira Fudo’s parents. Do not forget also the total reinterpretation of Asuka Ryo, a character a little too tied to the 70s, with his ghostly home on top of a cliff and a mad scientist as father.\n\nHowever, what Yuasa and Okouchi strongly wanted was to keep the message and spirit of the original work intact.\n\nAn occidental mask\n\nAs I already mentioned in the end of the previous paragraph, Devilman Crybaby conceptually follows the work from which it is taken. To understand the anime directed by Yuasa, one must therefore understand the motivations that led Go Nagai to create one of the most emblematic works of an entire generation.\n\nIt all started with the manga Harenchi Gakuen (eng: Shameless School). One of the first works written by Nagai, considered the first “ecchi” manga ever written. This manga raised a fuss of controversy so large, in its four years of serialization (from ’68 to ’72), that Shueisha was forced to stop publishing it. The Japanese Parents and Teachers Association (PTA) condemned Harenchi Gakuen as an immoral manga for the numerous scenes of violence and nudity. This, combined with a strong social satire, represented a danger to the minds of Japanese youth. Nagai did not welcome the interruption of his work, in fact he channeled all his contempt towards his detractors into a single feeling of revenge, which took shape in the creation of Devilman.\n\nIn order not to be censored again, Nagai used a very simple device, he “disguised” his revenge behind a veil of westernity, in a deliberately coarse way among other things. In fact, it makes you smile to think of how evident the author’s provocation is. He set the whole story in Japan, featuring a Christian family (religious minority), full of cliches such as the house with western architecture, or the picture of the Last Supper in the dining room. Thanks to the use of the culture and religion of the Old Continent, Nagai has succeeded in his aim of satirizing Japanese society, and at the same time filling his manga with thrilling and naked scenes veiled behind the excuse of demons inspired by Dante’s Divine Comedy.\n\nObviously Yuasa did nothing but emphasize this in Devilman Crybaby. The sex and nude scenes portray almost only humans as protagonists instead of demons. With this Yuasa did what Nagai could not do in his time. Undoubtedly a nice tribute.\n\nFear of the unknown.\n\nIn Devilman the usual cliché of the eternal struggle between the forces of good and those of evil is represented, in this case between humans and demons. However, to affect this stereotype is the addition of a third faction: the devilmen. But what do these factions represent? What is the meaning of their struggle within this work?\n\nAs I already mentioned in the previous paragraphs, Yuasa and Okouchi have tried to keep unchanged the message that Nagai wanted to convey to his readers. In fact, all the changes that have been made, and also all the original elements introduced specifically in the anime, were designed with the sole purpose of enhancing and at the same time making the original message of Nagai clearer.\n\nBut let’s go in order. Let’s first discuss the basic concepts of Devilman:\n\nHumanity – Faction that represents everything that has led human beings to differentiate themselves from other animal species. We therefore speak mainly of rationality, and how this has led our species to group in countless different societies and civilizations over time, in which ethics and morals were established, more or less different from each other, for its survival.\n\nDemons – They are perfectly described by Nagai with a single sentence: “… weakness means death. Only the strongest survive. ” This can be translated with one word: instinct. So what are demons? They are beings who act impulsively, without inhibitions imposed by morality, they’re guided exclusively by their sensations and their feelings.\n\nDevilmen – They are those who derive from the fusion between elements of the two previous factions. In them rationality and instinct are perfectly balanced, thus leading them to have and act following their own ethics, and not that of human society or anything else.\n\nFusion – Demons have the ability to merge with other living beings, with the sole purpose of becoming stronger. Merging with other animal species occurs without problems, since animals do not possess rationality. Fusion with humans occurs differently. Demons need them to completely lose their rationality before they can merge with them. Furthermore, according to the mood of the chosen human being, fusion can have two different outcomes. If the chosen human being has a weak soul, the fusion leads to a result identical to that which occurs with other animal species; if instead the human being has a stronger fortitude than that of the demon, the result will be a devilman.\n\nSabbath – A ceremony, mass, ritual, party organized by humans in which they try to lose rationality through the use of alcohol, drugs, lights and music so that they can get closer to the demonic world and therefore facilitate the fusion with the demons.\n\nHumanity has shown its weak side more than once because of societies that based their ethics on wrong values, and that this often led entire communities to behave in an “inhuman” way to say the least. The historical event chosen by Nagai, which then went to revisit in his work, is that of the Witch Hunt, which ironically began to develop during Humanism, until it reached the mid-eighteenth century. In this long period countless women were killed for no rational reason, it was enough that they had red hair, or that they were prostitutes or that they had a black cat to be sentenced to the stake; this is what Western society of the time believed was right to safeguard its survival.\n\nBut how can you describe all this with a single sentence? Simple, fear of the different. Society sets values, behavioral patterns, how to dress, etc. Thinking or acting differently from this inevitably leads people to panic and terror. This is because people no longer think for themselves, but they think and do everything that is socially right.\n\nIn Devilman, it is precisely on this that Satan’s plan is based, namely to exploit the weakness of human society to bring it to self-destruction. If humanity during the Witch Hunt managed to eliminate thousands of people driven by superstition/religion alone, imagine what it would be capable of if any person, at any time, and without a precise cause could turn into a monster. The absolute chaos. Extinction.\n\nSatan’s plan would have been perfect if he hadn’t made such a “human” mistake. I am referring to the feelings he has towards his only friend Akira Fudo. The Prince of Darkness who falls because of a human being, the one who rebelled against God because of men. In the finale of the work, Satan understands the paradox of his existence, and how insane his battle has been so far. For this reason, he does not even try to flee to another planet as he did in the past, but inert, he lets himself be annihilated by the wrath of God.\n\nNagai‘s message is obvious at this point. Values like freedom, love, friendship are inherent in the human soul, and are personified in Devilman by characters such as Miki and his family. Despite this, humanity often gets tangled up on its own, setting itself moral stakes that have no rational sense. This is a paradox because, as I wrote earlier, the human being differs from other animal species precisely because of his rationality, but often he reduces himself to doing completely irrational things. The man who returns to the primordial animal stage. Furthermore, this demonstrates the ease with which demons manage to merge with humans in the second part of the work.\n\nThe meaning of Devilman is therefore to not suppress our instincts as human beings, of not imprisoning the voice of our heart among the bars of social ethics, but to reason with our own minds, and to do not blindly follow everything that is imposed on us by society.\n\nObviously Nagai‘s original intent was to criticize the bigotry of Japanese society, which stopped the serialization of its aforementioned Harenchi Gakuen manga. In essence, the author wanted to urge his people to open their minds, to think outside the box, and finally to consider manga and anime as works of art, therefore to leave freedom of expression to the authors (it was still the 70s).\n\nHowever, the ending of Devilman is negative to say the least. The manga ends with the Apocalypse. Both Devilman and Satan are doomed to death. This ending can easily be interpreted as Nagai‘s resignation to his revolutionary cry. Or rather, surely in the world there will be more and more open minds (devilmen), but they will never be enough to defeat all the (human) bigotry and the irrational (demonic) instincts that afflict our society.\n\nYou’re a Crybaby!\n\nUp to this paragraph I have almost exclusively examined Nagai‘s manga, however the analysis I am writing is for the animated series directed by Yuasa and written by Okouchi. I followed this process because, in my opinion, since the anime is a modern reinterpretation of the original, I thought it appropriate to first describe its origins, and then go to highlight the work of the anime authors.\n\nYuasa is quite used to unconventional themes in his works, just think of his masterpiece Kaiba. In fact, the main purpose of his reinterpretation of Nagai‘s work is simply to enhance its messages. Emblem of this is the choice of title. Adding the term “crybaby” to the original title of the manga is at least brilliant. The crybaby is obviously a reference to the protagonist of the work, Akira. His strong sensitivity towards others remains unchanged even after becoming a devilman. In the beginning Akira unconditionally loves all humanity, this is because his vision was filtered during his childhood by the purity of his parents’ values, and during his adolescence by those of Miki and her family. In fact, his love for human beings ends after Miki’s death, personification and the last bulwark of those values. With her, the crybaby persona in Akira also dies, and the revenge-seeking Akira is born. A personality which is doomed to certain death. Revenge, anger only lead to one’s annihilation. This is a precise metaphor for the Nagai‘s resignation described in the previous paragraph.\n\nObviously Yuasa didn’t just rename Nagai‘s work.\n\nTo amplify the strong friendship between Ryo Asuka (Satan) and the protagonist Akira Fudo, Yuasa completely rewrites the origin of their first meeting. In the manga their meeting in Iceland is never narrated (it is never specified, but since there are scenes with puffins, I assume it is correct to say so), consequently not even the part in which they discuss whether or not to kill the sick kitten, so as to end his suffering given his desperate conditions. Another scene aimed at reinforcing the meaning of the term “crybaby” in the anime title.\n\nAnother element introduced by Yuasa is that of the athletics team. The reason for which this element has been included, is to allow the author to add two important new characters, and the themes that they represent in the work. Not only with the aim of reinforcing Nagai‘s original message, but above all to bring issues of our contemporary society to the fore.\n\nThe first of them is Miki Kuroda, or rather Miko. This character simply represents the pressure that modern society places on each of us. It drives us to the endless search for success and approval of others, continually puts us in competition with our classmates, work colleagues, etc. In Kuroda’s case, the situation is so suffocating (being called Miko and not Miki, just to remind her daily that there is a girl who is called like her, who is better than her in the athletics team) to take her to a sabbath and binding to a demon (a metaphor for suicide). However Kuroda is a girl with a strong and kind soul, so she becomes a devilwoman. With the body of the demon she regains self-esteem, and thanks to this she begins to “attack” the senselessness of society. However, the meeting with Akira and Koda, her fellow men, calms her soul. She then manages to deal with what she thought was the source of her malaise, Miki. Speaking with the latter, she realizes how she generated it, misled by the expectations of others who forced her to a senseless competition with Miki. Including this, Kuroda returns to being herself, a person who believes in friendship enough to sacrifice her life.\n\nKoda Moyuru’s character raises the issue of sexual discrimination to the viewer. Homosexuality (as in the case of Koda), lesbianism, transgender, etc. are not yet socially accepted. Although we are now in 2020, there are still groups of hatred such as the Baptist Church of Westboro, just to name an extreme case. Koda feels increasingly marginalized by society, precisely because he is forced to hide his sexual identity, for fear of being laughed at, if not worse. The fact that he later became a famous person only amplifies his malaise. All this only leads him to harbor a profound hatred towards society. So much so that when Ryo forces him to show his true form of demon (wonderful metaphor), Koda unloads all his hatred on the people present at the stadium, and then, with a clear mind, immediately regret what he did. It is thanks to Akira that he finds a community of mentally open people, the devilman, where he can finally be himself, a person with a generous soul.\n\nAnother event added by Yuasa is the one where Miki goes to the fashion agent’s house for a photo shoot. Obvious reference to our society based on appearances, the glorification of external beauty, and obviously the search for success and the good life through it. It is fair to specify how Miki’s purity leads her to always reject the advances of the fashion agent, she goes to his house only when she is controlled by a demon.\n\nNOTE = The final scene, the one in which Devilman and Satan are lying on a strip of land, surrounded by a red-tinted sea and an electric blue starry sky (image below), seems to be a clear tribute to another series animation that has made the history of Japanese animation. I am referring to Neon Genesis Evangelion, more precisely to the finale of the feature film The End of Evangelion. Probably, the conceptual similarities between the two scenes, such as the fact that in both protagonists are the last survivors in the world, or as the ending of both works is the apocalypse, therefore a not exactly positive ending, led Yuasa to artistically represent the conceptual closeness between these two pillars of Japanese culture.\n\nAfterword\n\nAfter excellent animated transpositions such as The Tatami Galaxy and Ping Pong the Animation, Yuasa goes to add another to his filmography. Devilman Crybaby is a modern reinterpretation of the original manga written by Nagai, where the director, in addition to taking care to keep the spirit of the original work intact, tries to give his personal touch by adding elements that blend perfectly with it.\n\nA criticism that can be made about Yuasa‘s work, in reality it is more of a consideration, is that of his choice to remain all too faithful to the original work. Being a reinterpretation, the director could have dared something more, he could have dealt in more depth with some characters, especially those created for the anime transposition, he could therefore have focused on them a few more episodes.\n\nDevilman Crybaby is an anime who wants to stir the conscience of its audience. Yuasa tries in every way to stimulate the viewer: through a captivating artistic aspect, the many scenes of nudity, or the extreme violence. All this elements have the sole purpose of “arousing” the audience, and consequently forcing the viewers to ask themselves questions about what is actually immoral for them, and what instead is only immoral because imposed by society’s bigotry."
