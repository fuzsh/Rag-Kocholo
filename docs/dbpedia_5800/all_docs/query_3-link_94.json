        "text": "Items in light blue are spoilers. Read at your own risk!\n\nOverview\n\nA young Professor named Ryo Asuka returns from studying abroad to inform his childhood companion, Akira Fudo, of an upcoming demonic threat on the world. After informing Akira of his theory that the demons are arriving via an event called the Sabbath, the two head to a nightclub to solidify his hypothesis. On this sinful night, Akira transforms into a creature of legend. Possessing the body of a demon but still retaining his heart, Akira has become Devilman.\n\nCharacters\n\nDEVILMAN crybaby had a ton of character development, however, the main character Akira had next to none. The physical changes that he experienced after fusing with the demon, Amon, were apparent but Akira retained his heartfelt ways throughout the rest of the show. A main character that doesn’t have personal growth is normally an instant kill switch in a Shōnen but Ichirō Ōkouchi’s skillful writing showed that developing the supporting cast can be just as important. Although Akira’s friends Mika and Miko played vastly different roles in the beginning of the show, they were effectively fleshed out and their symbolic end was a tear-jerker and my favorite part of the climax. Throughout the rising action, Akira’s childhood friend later revealed as the true antagonist, always felt a tad off. The confusion raised by his obscurity was rewarded by the reveal of his true identity as the fallen angel, Satan. Ten episodes isn’t enough time to properly develop characters but somehow DEVILMAN crybaby made it work.\n\n719/1000\n\nVisuals\n\nAnime is looking better than ever now that studios are finally getting the hang of 3-D animation. In a scene where the juggernauts of late are riding the CGI wave, DEVILMAN crybaby tries to get by using a simple version of the traditional 2-D style. While a few years ago this style would be run of the mill, today it seems lazy and behind the times. Issa no from me dawg.\n\n438/1000\n\nOverall Score\n\nThe Netflix Original, DEVILMAN crybaby is not for the faint of heart. Most of the rising action is filled with Drugs, Sex, and Brutal Murders that seem unnecessary. But when the writer is the same man responsible for writing the All-time great, Code Geass, things obviously come together the end. There were cyphers throughout the episodes that were used to fill in the breaks in the story and the rappers actually, had some fire BARS! Devilman started off right, trailed off in the middle and then brought it home with a strong ending. The show is not something I’d recommend if you are new to anime but experienced viewers should put it on your list if you feel like getting weird.\n\n701/1000 random freestyles"
