        "text": "Akira & Ryo\n\nThe name Fudo Akira (不動明) closely resembles Fudo Myo-o (不動明王), the Japanese name of the Buddhist deity Acala, who was one of the Five Wisdom Kings (wrathful manifestations of the Five Wisdom Buddhas). Fudo Myo-o was venerated as a destroyer of evil and one who removes obstacles on the path to enlightenment. This closely aligns with the two defining character traits of Devilman: a pure and virtuous heart, along with the willingness and ability to fight.\n\nThe etymology of Asuka Ryo (飛鳥了) is not as straightforward. Asuka (飛鳥) means flying bird, but the name seems to be derived from Akshobhya, one of the Five Wisdom Buddhas or Five Great Buddhas (one of five aspects of enlightenment). In Sanskrit, Acala is अचल, “The Immovable”, while Akshobhya is अक्षोभ्य, “Immovable One”. In Japanese however, Akshobhya is 阿閦如来, Ashukunyorai, which is not a common surname, unlike Fudo. Ryo (了) means “end” or “completion” which gives his full name multiple meanings that are valid in the context of the story: 1. Ryo brings about the end of wisdom/enlightenment, 2. given the similarity between Acala and Akshobhya, Ryo brings about the end of Akira, and 3. Ryo completes Akira. Indeed, Ryo completes Akira’s pure and virtuous heart by granting him the body of Amon. By contrast, those without the power to fight are fated to be helplessly and mercilessly torn apart, whether by demons or humans, as it was with Miki. They can also be said to complete each other in the sense that while Akira possesses the body of a demon and a pure heart, Ryo possesses the body of an angel but a heart of evil.\n\nAkira is empathetic to the point of being easily brought to tears by the suffering of others, while Ryo, who is not human to begin with, is altogether inert to others’ suffering. While Akira is rather dull and clueless about the world, Ryo possesses a genius intellect and vast worldly knowledge. Akira, with his exaggerated sense of empathy, his increased sensitivity to his natural desires, heightened instincts, idealized human appearance, and hellish demonic form, represents the earthly yin principle, the unconscious, and the body. Ryo, with his lack of empathy, inhuman inertness to earthly desires, extraordinary intelligence, meek human appearance, and radiant angelic form represents the heavenly yang principle, the conscious, and the mind. Both personify extremes of human characteristics, but in Devilman, they are separated, embodied, and set against each other.\n\nConscious desires and desires which stem from the unconscious often conflict in their aims; pleasure for one is often pain for the other. Conflict as they might, emotions and desires which stem from the unconscious give meaning to life yet constantly threaten and tempt to overwhelm the ego. Like Akira and Ryo, these fundamental forces of human experience are often opposed to one another and yet one completes the other. But just as how Buddha achieved enlightenment through the Middle Way between unrestrained indulgence and complete abstinence of worldly pleasures, so too must each individual find such a middle path between mind and body. In trying to excessively repress or extinguish one or the other, the entirety of the self may be brought to ruin.\n\nThe ascetic whose ego consciousness has triumphantly repulsed the instinctual components that threatened to master him experiences pleasure with his ego, but he “suffers” because the instinct he has denied is also a part of his total structure.\n\nNeumann, The Origins and History of Consciousness (trans. R.F.C. Hull)\n\nThe relationship between Akira and Ryo and the story that plays out in the world of Devilman is a window into the soul of modern man but also into the destiny of the society in which he inhabits and co-creates. Since the beginning of the “death of God” from the 19th century, man has implied in his behavior the belief of the greater “validity” of logic and science over other “primitive” modes of thought. Whereas man unconsciously projected the archetypes of his inner mind outward onto the external world, now that he denies and represses these inner forces, he is no longer aware of their existence. Without some idol or god around which intangible transpersonal forces can coagulate and materialize, he is unable to interact with them, to fear them, to bargain with them, and to assimilate their positive aspects.\n\nUngrounded by transpersonal forces, the ego loses touch with reality and tends towards megalomania. Ryo, (that is to say, Satan) the distilled embodiment of the ideals of rational thought (extraordinarily intelligent and unfeeling), in his belief in his own superiority, fails to notice the terrible suffering of his other half even though he values Akira so much he sacrifices one of his greatest warriors to him. Ryo drowns the world in death and destruction before he realizes that that which is dearest to his heart and the light which gives meaning to his existence has been extinguished by his own hand. And so it is that man with firm belief in his superiority and righteousness has engulfed his world in rivers of blood to realize his Babelesque designs of utopia, and only in the aftermath of the flames of war or atop a lonely mound of corpses and gold does he see that happiness lay not atop the heavens but with those closest to him and within his own heart.\n\nThough man possesses neither biological organs nor synthetic instruments by which he can observe and empirically corroborate the contents of his inner world, its contents- emotions, desires, pain and pleasure are as much real as the fixed contents of the external world, if not more “real” insofar as the reality which he alone experiences.\n\nHumans & Demons\n\nThe relationship between Akira and Ryo, the similarity between humans and demons and the fate of the world in Devilman lends itself to multiple levels of analysis. The preceding section briefly discussed the effects of the modern “hypertrophy” of consciousness on individuals, and this section discusses its effects on a social level.\n\nFollowing the collapse of the archetypal canon, single archetypes then take possession of men and consume them like malevolent demons.\n\nNeumann, The Origins and History of Consciousness (trans. R.F.C. Hull)\n\nThe modern man experiences a sense of isolation from his community, a shrinking of world horizons, and a sense of a lack of certainty and meaning in life. He is easily “possessed” by the archetypes of his unconscious.\n\nIn possession by the Great Mother, the ego is enfeebled and readily herds in masses so as to find comfort in the group. As it can no longer call upon the strength of the Great Father to confront the dragon, man finds himself without the image of the triumphant hero or the legendary arms of the ancients to equip himself in this encounter. He finds himself emasculated and without the means to embark on the hero’s journey. Like a lost child, he longs for comfort in his uncertainty which manifests as a desire for social validation of his present condition from which he lacks the means to overcome, giving rise to the increase in popularity of effeminate men, masochism, and the meek protagonist.\n\nAs social prey animals, individuals desire to move as close as possible to the centre of the group. From an evolutionary standpoint, this trait reduces risk to the individual and provides access to the benefits of the group. While this characteristic can be observed in terms of spatial orientation in animals, it also manifests in humans in their outward appearances, thoughts, and behaviors. But all that is needed to steer such a herd is a figure of authority whose confidence promises certainty and safety to direct the masses toward a common enemy which is precisely what characterizes possession by the Great Father. The emptiness of his existence and the uncertainty of his fate drives man into the arms of any ordering structure which serves to alleviate his dis-ease. It is all too easy for self-interested individuals to take advantage of these lost sheep and so it is that man readily submits himself to cults (e.g. scientology, televangelism, religious extremist groups), utopic ideologies (e.g. Nazism, communism), and large organizations known to abuse its members (e.g. governments, institutions, corporations).\n\nIn the form of a dream made told as a story, Devilman heralds the fate of man when he surrenders his mind to the herd: the thermopylaic defeat of those that would stand against the crowd and the pyrrhic victory of the masses. Since the dawn of man, he has been ever ready to sacrifice freedom for security, possibility for certainty, free thought for reassuring dogma and catchy slogans. And there will always be those disposed to seize that readiness for their own devices. But Devilman also warns that at the end of their journey, those who set out to mold the world to their designs may very well find that they have by their own hands destroyed it.\n\nOther thoughts:\n\n“Siren” is a better translation over “Silene”, which is a flower named after the satyr companion and tutor of Dionysus, Silenus. In Greek mythology, sirens are depicted as females with (or without) wings and the feet of birds, (they only later began to be depicted as mermaids) which is precisely the appearance of the demonic form of the character. Caim would be a better translation over Kaim as Caim is the name of a noble demon listed in the Ars Goetia alongside Amon.\n\nThroughout the story there is little to no character development. The original story of Devilman is quite dream-like in that, characters are anthropomorphized representations of aspects of personality and are not written to behave like real people. Miki in the manga for example is quite one-dimensional: she teases Akira when he is weak and fawns over him when he is strong. Even after the existence of demons is made public, she is still naive and bubbly until her death, showing the fate of pure souls that do not dirty their hands and minds to fight back. Akira and Ryo are set in their defining characteristics of feeling without understanding and understanding without feeling- they are after all both named after “immovable” deities.\n\nPost-script\n\nThank you for reading and I hope this improves your experience of the story of Devilman. If you enjoyed the ONA and this analysis and have not read the manga, I would recommend it if you have time to kill, if only for the interesting differences you will notice. The following section outlines some differences between the manga and the ONA which I thought were worth pointing out but did not contribute to the analysis above. As always, I’m happy to hear any feedback, especially any opposing viewpoints while the ideas are still fresh in my mind.\n\n2022-04-08: I just finished a massive revision of this piece just over a year after I first published the original version. It’s incredible how far my repertoire for psychoanalysis has come along when I compare the quality of the work I’ve done just one year ago. Unfortunately, while the depth and “accuracy” of analysis is much improved, it is now probably all but incoherent gibberish with a vague feeling that it sounds about “right” to anyone that is not somewhat familiar with depth psychology (guess that’s why people have stopped commenting even though I’m getting more views). Alas, this blog is more of a journal for myself and a means to apply what I read (but I will do my best to answer any questions).\n\nImportant differences between Devilman (Manga, 1972) and Devilman Crybaby (ONA, 2018)\n\nI really enjoyed the Netflix anime, but many of the changes they made from the original manga clearly stood out to me even before I read it. That is not to say I didn’t like them or that they were not a good addition for the intended audience, but the original Devilman is a very dream-like work, i.e. characters are more symbolic than written to behave like real people, which is why e.g. Kuroda Miki clearly sticks out as an addition by the Netflix team.\n\nIn the manga, Ryo reveals that demons are creatures of pure instinct, but he is an unreliable source of information seeing as his memories and the vision shown by the mask are all fabricated. In Volume 3, two demons that have possessed humans have a conversation about suppressing their urge to kill and keeping up appearances. In Episode 6, we see a hideout full of demons quite upset about the public appearance of what they believe to be one of their own. Finally, demons have infiltrated the upper echelons of the military and presumably other parts of society required to execute their plan of instigating nuclear war. Demons then demonstrate in numerous aspects that they are not simply beasts driven solely by instinct, though they can be, but also possess the capacity to follow an organizational hierarchy to advance the interests of the collective at the expense of the individual, much like humans. While the manga establishes that demons “evolved” from humans, the veracity of the possibility of humans becoming demons is left more open to interpretation in the anime. That said, in both manga and ONA, the behavior of demons and humans is likened to an extent that one wonders if it even matters whether or not the transformation process is as straightforward as it is claimed to be when announced to the public.\n\nThere are two scenes which were left out of the anime that serve to contrast Akira’s meekness before Akira’s transformation with his strength after. In the first, Miki teases Akira about his nickname of “the fire alarm of Higashi Elementary” before they are harassed by a group of bullies as they walk home from school. Akira says to ignore them and walk away, but as the situation escalates, Miki starts talking back to them and slaps one of them. One of the bullies grabs her and she cries out for Akira to help her, but he does not budge. The scene ends when Ryo shows up and scares them off with his gun. In the second, the two are being chased by demons driving on a mountain road away from his mansion. Ryo crashes the car into his house and as they are fleeing from the vehicle, Akira asks if it is ok to leave his shoes on. In the anime however, his crybaby trait persists even after his transformation and serves as a reminder of his pure heart.\n\nRyo’s father was the professor in the manga instead of Ryo himself. After committing suicide by self-immolation, his father leaves him a detailed diary and a demonic mask which when worn, shows the history of the demons (later revealed to be an ordinary mask and the visions were caused by Psychogenie- his assistant which in the anime is aptly named Psycho Jenny). Ryo explains that demons have the ability to merge and acquire the characteristics of living and non-living things, while the anime chooses to leave this explanation to the very end. Importantly, however a full-page image is shown of demons before they merged with anything. This page (page 86, Volume 1) shows that the original form of demons is identical to the appearance of humans. Later in the story, humanity forms an anti-demon corps who successfully capture dozens of demons and experiment on them. Clutching a handful of pages from his desk covered with research data, Professor Rainuma, a winner of the Nobel Prize for Biology, comes to the conclusion that the desires and passions, delusions, frustrations and stress of humans cause them to mutate at a cellular level into demons which he announces to the world. In the anime, it is left ambiguous whether humans dissatisfied with society and/or under great psychological stress may truly transform into demons like Ryo professes on television or whether it is simply a lie for the purpose of advancing his grand scheme which adds another layer of depth to the scene where Akira runs home to find Miki’s severed head on a stake where the comparison is drawn between actual demons and humans that have surrendered their higher consciousness to a mob mentality.\n\nRyo explains that humans have something that demons hate- the “spirit to live”, which he calls “the most human of characteristics”. In the version I read, Ryo also calls it “reason”. A demon has trouble merging with a human with this spirit to live, but only a “youth with a virtuous heart” can become a devilman. Conversely, “when a human abandons reason and acts on instinct alone, a demon and human are able to merge”. This is another reason why Akira and Ryo go to a club- one which the manga reveals that Ryo actually established, whereas in Crybaby, the club is only used as a place where Ryo can draw blood from drugged out attendees. The “spirit to live” and “reason” do not seem that closely related (at least in English), but I believe the author means to refer to the many varied aspects of higher consciousness in contrast to the base instincts of man which is the domain of demons.\n\nIn the manga, there is no mention of a previous romantic relationship between Amon and Siren and the motivation behind Siren’s attack seems to be only that she cannot stand the thought that a great demon warrior was taken over by a mere human, which she considers no better than a bug. In Crybaby, Siren turns to stone whereas in the manga she simply dies from earlier injuries sustained from fighting with Devilman. This seems to imply that accepting Caim’s feelings for her caused their fused form to turn into stone, perhaps because love is the antithesis of demons and is fatally toxic to them?\n\nThe face monster, Kujira, kills Sachiko, a little girl who lived next to Akira and takes the train alone to visit him. In the anime, Akira’s parents are his victims, while they are not shown in the manga. Given that Akira’s parents were given a little backstory instead of being introduced just to die, there is a greater emotional response produced by their death.\n\nIn volume 3, a spider demon takes control of Akira’s classmates via hat-sized spiders that latch on to their heads. Akira is able to destroy the spiders without hurting his classmates and they go on to help Akira fight off more mind-controlled students using a baseball bat, chains, and other items around the school as weapons. Though seemingly inconsequential to the story, it serves as an important contrast and as a reminder that humans are fully able to defeat the more powerful demons by working together.\n\nIn the manga, before Rainuma publicly reveals that anyone under stress or feeling oppressed by society may become a demon, there is a period where the demons begin to come out of hiding and start indiscriminately trying to merge with humans. Some are unsuccessful due to the fact that many humans possess the “spirit to live”, resulting in the gruesome death of the hybrid mid-transformation, while others become devilmen. This is a part of the devils’ plan to incite mass fear and panic in order to turn humans against each other. In doing so, people revert to creatures of instinct, making it easier for other devils to possess more people, inciting more fear and so on.\n\nIt is revealed that Satan took the body of Ryo Asuka to discover the weaknesses of the human mind, and in the manga, Demon Commander Xenon says that Satan ends up falling in love with Akira during this time. In Crybaby, we are only shown a flashback of various moments spent together in childhood, and the love that Satan feels is never explicitly stated. Instead, as Akira and Ryo lay side by side in the aftermath of the final battle, Satan says love does not exist and therefore sorrow does not exist. Despite this, he finds himself weeping over Akira’s dead body, thereby proving the existence of sorrow and implying his love for Akira, though he does not recognize or understand the emotions he feels at that time.\n\nIn Crybaby, Satan explains that he opposed God but does not explain why and that he merely happened to find himself on Earth by chance after his defeat. God and His angels pursue him to Earth, and it is shown that following their first encounter on Earth, the Earth’s surface is reduced to little more than molten rock, though Satan later recalls that demons lived on as beings of “pure will”. In the manga, Satan explains to Akira in the aftermath of the final battle that God left for some time after creating the Earth and when he returned to see how it was doing, found creatures that he had not created ravaging it- demons. He wanted to destroy them, but Satan sought to protect them and allied with them to oppose God and His angels. Having been defeated, Satan deliberately puts himself and the other demons into hibernation for millions of years in the polar ice caps to prepare to battle against God once more, but upon waking finds that humans had ruined the Earth and wanted to exterminate them. It is only after Akira lays dead by his side that Satan realizes he had become no different than what he sought to oppose."
