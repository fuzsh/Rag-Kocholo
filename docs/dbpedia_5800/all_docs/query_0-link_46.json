        "text": "I haven’t had a chance to watch a lot of “Netflix Original” anime. Which I find is a weird title to put on an anime that has other studios working on it, but I’m not sure how that works… I did see in the credits that MADHOUSE was involved so I was pretty interested to see what this was about. I’m going to try and not be too spoiler-y since the twists are what makes the ending so good.\n\nFirst things first the title isn’t great. When I read it I thought that this would be more of a gag anime than the darker journey that this anime took me on. So be prepared for a very graphic anime with both sex and violence. I wish they would have named it “Devilman Cries” or something else… It just seems cheesy.\n\nSo in this world humans can get taken over by demons. Then they start eating humans. However, the main character Akira dubs himself as a “devilman” since he still has his human heart and I think he can sense the human inside the demons crying so that makes him cry thus the name “Crybaby”. His friend Ryo helps him fight demons not really telling Akira what the end goal is for his plans.\n\nFrom the first episode I was on board. It had a nice set up an the OP theme is still stuck in my head (man man man man human it gets ya). Like I said earlier this anime is very graphic and in episode one you start out with a huge sex/death orgy so yeah…\n\nI think in this anime only having 10 episode hurt the flow of the beginning set up. There is a loss of the grove in episodes 2-4 I think they could have used another episode before the one with Akira’s mom to have more of a set up with what their relationship was or wasn’t.\n\nThe plot feels rushed and scattered and I was tempted to call it quits. I didn’t feel like watching a bunch of people die that I didn’t care about (I already watched King’s Game for that). Then this anime really hits its grove in the last episodes and things start to make sense and the relationships and the tragedy is real and heartbreaking.\n\nThe message that humans are the real monsters hit home. I’ve been watching a lot of “Black Mirror” as well and to see the mob mentality is something that is real. People killing people. This anime takes you to the darkest depths that humans can reach when we lose our humanity.\n\nThe fact of this anime is you don’t know who to trust. You see people make choices and those choices are “right” to them. Friends are divided without warning and do things in the end that make your stomach turn. A sweet moment can be wrecked in flash. We have the power of choice and that is what this anime shows.\n\nThis anime won’t give you a lot of faith in humans but there are always a few bright moments. (Spoiler) I really enjoyed the scene where Akira is protecting the humans. Then the children put down their rocks and hug him. Children leading the adults and who aren’t born to hate. That was nice message that sometimes a child can see more truth and wisdom than adults can when we are riled.\n\nThe final turning point was tragic the last two episode are the best in the whole series in my opinion. It shows the good and the bad and the full impact of the relationships between Akira and those who he loves and what keeps him human.\n\nMy favorite moment is after the credits start rolling. I think it is episode 9 there is a scene between Akira and Miki that is beautiful.\n\nThe music and the peace of her riding behind him on his motorcycle is a nice moment after all the tragedy that happens. It is a dream and a hope another world that they can live in together without the death that surrounds them. This is the only time, I believe, that there is something after the credits so make sure you watch them and don’t skip ahead.\n\nThe art in this anime is unique and the music is perfect. I really enjoyed the rapping also. It was more “Old School” when rap tells a story and doesn’t just repeat the same sexual innuendo over and over. It really gave an interesting break and vibe to the story telling. I honestly didn’t like it at first but then it grew on me after a sweet moment between two side characters.\n\nThe way he couldn’t speak to her but then he could express himself through rap was very cute.\n\nIn the end this isn’t an easy anime to watch. The first episodes are weaker than the final, but once it gets in the grove it really takes off. The battle scene at the end is probably one of the best that I have seen in a long time.\n\nHope you give this anime a chance it was a good watch. Happy watching!\n\n“I am a Devilman!”"
