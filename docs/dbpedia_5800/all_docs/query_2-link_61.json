        "text": "Disclaimer: This is an old ass post. I probably do not agree with the ideas it presents, and I in all likelihood denounce whatever is written herein. It has been preserved entirely for the purpose of keeping the history and progression of the blog visible.\n\nAfter Devilman Crybaby came out I decided to consume ALL of the other Devilman content I could get my hands on. As such, I busted out my old copy of Devilman Vol. 1 (the only one I ever owned), and I have to say, I really enjoyed it.\n\nOf course, the art in some (most) places is pretty bad. Not the backgrounds mind you, at this point in his career Go Nagai knew how to make an interesting background, the character design is where this volume really falls flat in the art department. Of course, bad art can’t ruin a manga, as long as it’snot incomprehensible (ala the earliest Lupin III chapters). The characters always have incredibly stiff poses, and there’s never a panel where the proportion is done well. The art is only really ever enjoyable to look at in panels such as the above image, where it has a sketchier style, with different line lengths, and you can really feel the utter chaos that the imagery is trying to invoke.\n\nThis first volume is most certainly my favorite of the five, other than the fifth. Sure, the art isn’t as good as it gets in later volumes, but the midsection seems mostly unwarranted, devolving into a “villain of the volume” sort of thing. The story is fantastic, it shows us the origin of Devilman (and is the basis for the fantastic ’87 OVA), fleshes out its characters and provides us with some intriguing questions that will be answered in future volumes. Of course, there are a few absolutely stupid plot contrivances here and there but I can look over them seeing as how the experience of the whole is so fantastic.\n\nBut this is Devilman. We’re not here for the art or story. We’re here for the insane, gory, downright fucked up situations that Devilman is so known (and popular) for, and don’t you fear, it’s most certainly present. Although, this is the most shall we say, “civil” of the five volumes, most of the manga consists of world-building, and us learning about the characters, leading up the reveal of Devilman. Although that’s not to say there aren’t epic moments throughout the rest of the volume, there most certainly are, but most of it is saved for the amazing finale. Within the last handful of pages, we get to see Akira merge with Amon and become Devilman. What follows is one of the most insanely brutal, gory fight scenes in all of manga. Where scores of not so innocent people are possessed by demons and are brutally killed by the newly formed Devilman.\n\nI recommend this manga wholeheartedly. If you’re not comfortable with a lot of nudity and gore, this one isn’t for you. But if you’re up for anything, this manga is one hell of a ride."
