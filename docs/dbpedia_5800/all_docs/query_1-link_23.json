        "text": "Characters & Voice Actors\n\nStaff\n\nKimura, Eriko\n\nSound Director\n\nOshiyama, Kiyotaka\n\nEpisode Director, Storyboard, Animation Director, Character Design, Key Animation\n\nEdit\n\nOpening Theme\n\n\"MAN HUMAN (DEVILMAN crybaby Ver.)\" by Denki Groove\n\nEdit\n\nEnding Theme\n\n\"Konya dake (今夜だけ)\" by Takkyuu to Tabibito (卓球と旅人) (eps 9)\n\nReviews\n\nStory: The Story in Crybaby was very good, the pacing was solid throughout the entire story, it never felt like there was unnecessary dips, and it managed to push through to the end and conclude in a satisfying way, which many shows nowadays fail to do.\n\nAs someone who had never previously read Devilman or watched any adaptation, all of the twists that were present in the classic series were new to me, and most were well done, they are hard to predict until the show wants you to know or gives large hints, it does well at subverting your expectations.\n\n9/10\n\nArt: Art is something that ... I felt was not a high point in the series, it had solid animation and went for a very deliberate style, and did well in capturing the feel of the classic art style of Go Nagai, however doing something for the sake of homage is not necessarily always the best possible choice, I'm sure many will disagree with me here, but again I have no ties to original series.\n\n7/10\n\nSound: I loved the music in this show, especially the Opening which is one of my favourites that I've heard in general, but beyond the music the sound effects and such were consistently good, but nothing really beyond just good.\n\n7/10\n\nCharacter: Easily the best part of Devilman Crybaby is the characters, every single character is so well done, everything is deliberate, everything is consistent, and interesting Akira is one of the best characters I've seen in a long time, he doesn't fall into any overarching category, he as a character is incredibly unique and his relationships with the other characters especially Miki and Ryo are just incredible.\n\n10/10\n\nEnjoyment: This series was really damn enjoyable the action was solid if a bit sparse but when it did happen, it was incredible, with the soundtrack and voice acting backing it up, the switch flipping at the end of episode one is when I knew I was going to love this series\n\n9/10\n\nOverall Rating: While I'd love to give this a 10, I didn't think everything was executed as well as it could have been, it's extremely close to a 10 but it's not quite there, some things did feel like they were passed over fairly quickly, and some aspects of the show did feel more standard than outstanding.\n\n9/10\n\nReviewer’s Rating: 9\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\nNice 0\n\nLove it 0\n\nFunny 0\n\nConfusing 0\n\nInformative 0\n\nWell-written 0\n\nCreative 0\n\nShow all\n\nGoing into this series, I had zero background information on any of its details. Didn't know that it was a manga adaptation, that it contained adult content (so. much. boobs.), or that it was directed by THE Maasaki Yuusa (Tatami Galaxy, that one episode in Adventure Time) until I decided to do a little research halfway through the series. So there was little to no expectations in my part, other than my friend suggesting I watch it. And I have to say... I was kinda disappointed by the end. Started promisingly but faltered way down as it rushed to its finish line. Let's break it ... down, shall we?\n\nStory: 5\n\n- First episode was definitely intriguing, establishing the world and its themes, but felt a bit rushed and jumbled at times\n\n- Pacing was odd, to say the least\n\n- Themes of humanity and the good/evil that comes with it, not the most original idea (granted, the manga was written way back in the 70's)\n\n- The second half is where it reaaaaally dovetails\n\n- Plot development feels unnatural\n\nArt: 8\n\n- Greatest asset, even with the occasional flaws\n\n- Eclectic and unique camerawork\n\n- Character design is lush and defined\n\n- An ecstatic and colorful palette that transitions late in the series to darker and muted tones\n\n- Animation in the mid-episodes sometimes felt stilted, and just plain bad in a few scenes\n\nSound: 6\n\n- Nothing really noteworthy, music and sound design is solid, even inventive on occasion\n\n- Plenty of electro beats, and wood percussions\n\n- OP song is quite good (not really a factor for critiquing)\n\nCharacter: 5\n\n- No character is downright hateable, so that's good\n\n- Most likable is definitely Miki, the bright and hopeful girl next door\n\n- Contrasting of Ryo and Akira is obvious, but not memorable\n\n- Supporting characters have confusing arcs and inconsistent internal logic\n\nEnjoyment: 4\n\n- Admittedly enjoyable at first, with its melange of colors and overzealousness in presentation, but becomes downright depressing by the end, minus any form of catharsis or larger talking point\n\n- Can't imagine anyone willing to re-watch all of this for the sake of entertainment\n\nOverall: NO THANKS, I'LL PASS (or watch once and regret losing 5 hours of bountiful sleeping time and writing a review after, 6am in the morning...)\n\n#Thanks2018\n\nReviewer’s Rating: 5\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\nNice 0\n\nLove it 0\n\nFunny 0\n\nConfusing 0\n\nInformative 0\n\nWell-written 0\n\nCreative 0\n\nShow all\n\n[Spoiler Warning]\n\nI don't understand the hype...What a complete waste of time. They rely so heavily on sex and gore but the story was just absolutely awful. If I could give this series a 0 out of 10 I would.\n\nFirst of all, let's address the English dialogue. Can we stop it? If you can't speak English, just stick with Japanese and subtitle it. The English dialogue was so cringy and unnecessary. Just stop it. They also used Arabic letters to showcase that people from an Arabic origin were discussing the news but the letters meant nothing. It wasn't even a sentence, just letters. Did the creators ... not have a single Arabic friend to write them one sentence? Maybe even use Google translate?\n\nOk, on with the review.\n\nStory: Extremely weak, rushed, and nonsensical. The questioning of humanity's ability to descend into chaos and violence and whether or not human beings are worth saving at all is not new. It's been done over and over again, which is fine, but at least develop the story. Every decent anime would at least have a decent backstory, some sort of plot to follow, build up, and hopefully reach a climax at some point. This story is ridiculously bad that I found myself yawning throughout the entire thing.\n\nThere is absolutely no consistency, depth, or any cohesiveness to this story. When I finally reached the end of the story, the simplicity in its conclusion was...extremely disappointing. \"God did it\" is not an ending. It's just an excuse to wrap up a story that was haphazardly put together in the first place.\n\nAlso, what's with the constant rapping in the first few episodes? We get it, some kid likes to rap. Congratulations! Can we develop a story now?\n\n0/10\n\nCharacters: Couldn't care less for any of them. No character development whatsoever and every one of them felt rushed. You know what I learned about the main character? Devilman? He cries. That's his character arc. He cries in the beginning of the series, and then he cries near the end trying to save humanity. Where else could you possibly have known that the main character cries I wonder? It's in the title. They spent more time drawing Miki's crotch and passing the baton back and forth (mostly to herself) than developing any of the main characters.\n\n0/10\n\nAnimation style: What was the budget for animating this series? Was there even a budget? The fights looked terrible and it looked like all they cared about is how to draw boobs semi-correctly. Speaking of boobs, why did Ryou, a supposedly male protagonist, grow boobs in the end of the series? Is that supposed to mean something? Are we just gonna gloss over the fact that a man grew boobs without explaining anything? I researched this question by the way, and apparently Satan has boobs in the manga. So, logically, when Ryou transforms into Satan, he grew boobs. This is what some people refer to as a masterpiece by the way.\n\n0/10\n\nWhat an abomination...I'm speechless at how bad it is...and I don't understand how or why anyone would call this a good anime.\n\nReviewer’s Rating: 1\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\nNice 0\n\nLove it 0\n\nFunny 0\n\nConfusing 0\n\nInformative 0\n\nWell-written 0\n\nCreative 0\n\nShow all\n\nInterest Stacks\n\nRecommendations\n\nRecent News\n\nQ3 2024 Anime & Manga Licenses [Update 8/9]\n\nIn this thread, you'll find a comprehensive list of anime and manga licensed in the third quarter (Jul-Sep) of 2024.
