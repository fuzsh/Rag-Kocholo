        "text": "Akira Fudo (不動明, Fudō Akira?) was the human who becomes the eponymous Devilman. Originally passive and cowardly, but very good natured, thanks to the efforts of Ryo Asuka he is possessed by the demon hero Amon. But due to Akira's pure heart he gains the demon's powers, memories, bravery, strength, and willingness to fight while maintaining his human consciousness. Now a creature with the body of a demon but the mind of a human, Akira swears to protect his former people against the hordes of demons that seek to destroy humanity.\n\nEarly Background\n\nAkira was born as the only son to his parents. Due to his sensitive nature, as a child, he was nicknamed the \"Fire Alarm of Higashi Elementary\" for how much he cried. When his parents leave Japan to work abroad, Akira had to transfer to a new school and is sent to live with his father's friend Kozo Makimura. Akira quickly becomes friends with Kozo's daughter Miki and develops a sibling like relationship with her. At some point previously, Akira had met Ryo Asuka and became best friends with him before Ryo moved away. But this was later revealed to be a fake memory implanted by Psycho Jenny.\n\nAppearance\n\nAkira is a teenager of average height and weight (approx. 5'8\" & 140 lbs.) with short black hair that is combed forward and has black eyes. Like many male Go Nagai characters, he has prominent sideburns. After his first transformation into Devilman, standing about 6'1\" and weighing 190 lbs, his build changes from average to more athletic, and black markings form under his eyes as a result of Amon's influence. He is often seen dressed in his school uniform but also wears a black long sleeve shirt, pants, and shoes in other situations.\n\nAs Devilman, his hair changes into small black bat wings on each side of his head. His forehead extending to his crown turns red and grows a pair of antennae. His lower body grows dark hair from the pelvic region down to his feet, and his hands and feet grow sharp claws on their digits. He also has a tail with an arrow-headed spade at the tip. Depending on the artwork, Akira's skin color remains the same as his human, gains a blue-green color hue, or most rarely is red. The sclera of Devilman's eyes is either empty white or yellow, which are said to be full of grief. When Devilman demands it, he can spot a pair of large bat-like wings from his back.\n\nIn special Devilman Lady chapters, Akira's spirit sports a costume to interact with the real world, dubbed Devilman Ghost. Initially consisting of a skeletal Devilman mask, it is later given a black body suit with bone-like decorations including bone armored gloves and boots. It is also decorated with a cape.\n\nAbilities\n\nPrior to turning into Devilman, Akira had some of the best grades in his classes and had impressive intellect, partly due to the fact that he spent most time reading. In terms of physical skills, Akira never thought of joining after school activities for his dislike of sports; as such he wasn't very physically fit. After his first transformation into his Devilman, he became much more physically powerful; having greater strength, speed, reflexes, and combat skills, being able to take on Zann's demon spiders without worry. Devilman is able to continue fighting even after he lost an arm and had his stomach slashed open by Sirene. His ferocious strength allows him to lift heavy objects, tear demons apart with his bare hands, break through barriers, and leap over buildings effortlessly. When Devilman grows his wings, he is able to fly. For various distances he can shoot beams from the antenna on his forehead. Some demons stated that he could even be a major threat to Zennon, although the two never managed to fight each other.\n\nIn a few short instances, Devilman shows different powers that fit certain situations. One was shown when he was battling Ghelmer, shooting two beams of rays of intense heat from his palm of his hands. He can also release energy from his antenna but in a less focused way than his normal Devil Beam. These same antennae can create signals similar to those used by Sirene to control her fileable arms and used this technique to direct the arm into Sirene's stomach. He has the ability to teleport as shown when he rescued Miko. When Miki's parents are killed, Devilman breathed flames from his mouth on the killers with enough heat and force to burn them to ash in seconds. Another less seen ability is his power to phase through solid objects even through inches of hard steel. He is able to grow to great size which gives him an advantage when fighting smaller demons.\n\nAs shown with other Devilman, Akira is able to communicate with other Devilman through telepathy but his is limited compared other Devilman. Like all Devilmen he is able to combine with living tissue. While this is never used in the manga, it was used at the end of the novel version to combine with the other Devilman Corps to assume a larger version of himself. Devilman vs Getter Robo took this a step further by combining with the Getter Robo itself.\n\nIn the Devilman Lady manga, after spending a long time in Hell, Akira's powers have heightened to extremes that rival even Satan's. He is able to release electric charges on enemies once he comes into contact with him or her. Devilman can also release energy at an opponent through heightened psychic abilities. For a limited amount of time, Devilman can leave Hell and interact with the physical world, but his actions are very limited without a physical body. He is able to look into a person's memories and for a short while appear visible to a person. He is also able to possess objects, most notably the Devilman Ghost costume made by Jun and fight through said objects with impressive strength and psychic power that can effortlessly tear through enemies.\n\nPersonality\n\nBefore his initial transformation, Akira was kind and sweet, but cowardly and highly emotional at the same time. Much of the time, he used to cry in most of these situations. Shying out of any conflict or problems had caused those around him to think him as weak.\n\nAfter becoming Devilman, Akira became much braver and more headstrong, as well as perverse. Because of his originally weak will, his fusion with Amon however caused him to become far more brooding and violent.\n\nHe was best friends with Ryo Asuka and had been since childhood (although this is later shown only to be implanted memories), he was deeply protective of Ryo. Unknown to him for a long while, Ryo was in love with Akira. However, Akira didn't return the feelings of love and instead cared for Miki Makimura who both shared romantic feelings for one another, much to Ryo's frustration.\n\nHe cared deeply for his adoptive family who took him in after his parents were too busy to care for him. Before his transformation, Miki was often the only friend Akira ever had and despite being talked down by her for not standing up for himself, Akira genuinely cared about Miki enough for romantic love. Miki was also the biggest hope Akira had for humanity and it was her death that made Akira lose faith in it altogether. This made Akira put all his faith into Devilman because of their pure hearts, but some outer media brought out different paths including his memories of Miki keeping Akira from losing his own humanity to Amon.\n\nHe later made friends with the gang that originally attacked him after he saved their life from an attacking demon, primarily Masa and Dosu-Roku. He was highly respected and looked up to by the other Devilmen, primarily Massami Izumi and even more so Mico, especially after he saved her life.\n\nLater on, in Devilman Lady, he befriends Jun Fudo as the two walks through the depths of Hell, during which Akira admits to Jun that he did in fact love Ryo, but whether this was platonic or romantic is unknown. Later on, during their time in Hell, Jun and Akira begin to fall in love and they have sex in mid-flight. Akira was upset when they could not be together, especially when he saw images of Jun suffering. But his will managed to manifest through a suit Jun made for him that allowed him to protect Jun from some threats she couldn't fight against. He was surprised upon coming back into the world through Satan and finding out Jun was half of Satan. Yet for some reason, he chose not to decline Satan's offer to join the battle against God. He is also shown to express sympathy for certain demons that he had killed when he was alive such as Sirene and Kaim, as well as pure hatred for others especially the sadist Jinmen.\n\nHistory\n\nDevilman\n\nTransformation\n\nAkira is first seen walking home from his first day at his new school with Miki Makimura whose family he had recently moved in with. One the way however they are stopped by Ken, Go and Dosu-Roku three gang member, all of whom were all attracted to Miki and start teasing the two, Miki gets angered by them whilst Akira tries to keep everything cool, Miki slaps Ken and Meriken-Jo but is grabbed by a furious Dosu-Roku starts to try and undress her, whilst Akira is held back by the other two, luckily they are saved by the sudden and mysterious intervention of Ryo Asuka who threatens the gang with a highly illegal sawed-off shotgun. Ryo says that he needs to speak to Akira privately and Miki is forced to walk back by herself.\n\nOn the way to Ryo's home, he reveals that his father committed suicide after killing his dog John and then attempted to kill Ryo, as they arrive at his home, he tells Akira that his father had been possessed by a Demon. At first Akira didn't believe his friends story but Ryo takes him to an empty room containing only a strange demonic mask. Ryo tells him to put the mask on, he does so, and his mind is suddenly barraged with visions of Demons explaining their origins and powers and how they were escaping from their icy tomb. These images were projected by the demon known as Psycho Jenny but this was unknown to both Akira and Ryo at the time.\n\nAfter removing the mask Ryo says why he brought Akira here, he says that he wants Akira to become a warrior against the Demons to protect the human race. Akira at first thinks Ryo was insane for thinking of such an idea. Ryo tells him to think about it and drives him home. However, on the way they are attacked by the hordes of demons. They are forced to go back to Ryo's house; however, Ryo takes Akira into a hidden basement in his home, and Akira decides that he will become a demon warrior. Ryo then moves through the basement to reveal another hidden room and much to Akira's surprise is holding a massive party. Ryo says that he is planning to perform a Black Sabbath, meaning he would have to cause much carnage within the room to summon the demons. Akira was hesitant to let people die and be overcome by such fearsome creatures in spite of their sinful nature. As Ryo starts stabbing people with a broken wine bottle, the partiers angrily start to beat them both up but unknown to them they were being possessed by demon starting with the she demon Welvath.\n\nThey continue to transform and kill those who failed to do so, before surrounding Akira. But suddenly Akira blacks out and starts to become overtaken by the demon Amon. Akira's pure heart and soul dominates Amon and gains control of his body, turning into Devilman for the first time. He proceeds to kill every demon in the area. Suddenly remembering Ryo, he tries to find his friend only to see that Ryo had been crushed by a dead demon, and screams in pain over his friend's supposed death.\n\nSirene Attacks\n\nA little while later Akira is seen mocking Tare and Miki Makimura commenting on Miki's breasts swelling after having to many baths. She angrily retorts only to then go to pour another bath, Akira then suddenly leaves having sensed some trouble about to start. At the same time the she demon Sirene arrives and lands on top of the Makimura residence and summons her two demon subordinates Ghelmer and Agwel as they attack the Makimura family.\n\nRealizing that the battle had begun Akira runs to find the Makimura's but is greeted by Tare who was running in panic after finding his parents embedded in the wall and ceiling. Akira tells Tare to hide and runs to rescue Miki from Ghelmer and Agwel who use all of their abilities to fight and trick Akira, with Ghelmer even using Miki as a puppet. Fortunately, Devilman manages to turn the tables on both demons, killing them. He sets Miki down on bed but still senses another demon. He is then attacked by Sirene who grabs Akira by her talons and flies into the sky.\n\nAkira struggles to get himself free as Sirene proceeds to crush him. Akira is saved by a recently awakened Ryo using a sniper rifle with Sirene losing her grip and Akira transforming into his Devilman form. Sirene knocks out Ryo with one of her claws as she grapples with Devilman. The two battles in mid-air before landing on the ground, Sirene's telekinesis proved to be a problem as she uses it attack Akira with trees and her detached arm that she uses it to cut through Akira's right arm and then impales it into his chest. Akira figures out that it was her antenna that were controlling the arm and uses his own antenna to fry the receptors in hers causing the arm to go out of control and impale her in her stomach, Akira then rips off her right wing grounding the demon. Sirene however is helped by other demons including her companion Kaim. Akira takes out the other demons but now has to deal with Sirene's gestalt with Kaim. Badly wounded, Akira finally admits defeat and falls unconscious. Waking up in the morning however, he finds out that Sirene didn't take the final strike as she died from her wounds. Ryo had patched up Akira's wounds and reattached his arm. Akira then sees Sirene's frozen body in the sunlight, noticing that she died with a smile of victory upon her face, something which Akira remarks as being beautiful.\n\nRasber's Invasion\n\nAfter the battle with Sirene, Akira overhears his classmates talk about disappearances around Japan, Akira knowing that demons were the cause of it. At the top of the school's roof, Dosu-Roku's gang challenge him to a fight however in a matter of minutes they are all defeated by Akira and sprawled out across the roof. Later at the end of school Miki comes to find Akira only for the two to be cornered by Masa and his gang. However, Akira realizes that they had been possessed and hadn't merged with them, so he took care not to kill them. He crushes the spiders on the groups head freeing them from their possession. They thank him and agree to join him in his battle against the Demon race.\n\nHowever as soon as they get outside, they are surrounded by many of the school's more physical and strong students had also been possessed by the Spider Demons and start to attack them. Akira tells the gang to protect Miki while he goes to find the spider's control. The demon Rasber however used a perfect copy of himself, he mocks Akira as he forms an image in the sky as Zann the demon general of the Army of 100 Demons issues his commands and taunts everyone. Rasber laughs at Akira and the others and retracts the Demon Spiders. He then attacks and wraps up Miki and the gang in his webbing, Akira battles Rasber and kills him quickly allowing the others to escape.\n\nJinmen's Torture Display\n\nAfter departing from the gang, Miki and Akira go back to the Makimura Residence where they encounter a small girl trying to reach for the doorbell. The girl's name was Sachiko and she was a friend of Akira's before he moved away to live with the Makimura's, Akira invites her inside although Miki and Sachiko immediately start to agitate each other.\n\nAkira later takes Sachiko to the train station and put her on the 16:10 Shinkansen and tells her not to make such long journeys on her own anymore, she agrees and the two depart. However later that night, news of the 16:10 Shinkansen's disappearance is announced and almost as soon as Akira learns about this, he gets a mysterious phone call telling him to meet him at a local park and then tells him that his little friend was delicious and reveals himself as Jinmen of Zann's troops.\n\nAkira barely retaining his anger flees the Makimura home and goes to a park that Jinmen told him to meet. After waiting around the park's playground a while, he sees the face of Sachiko. He calls out to her, she replies by saying \"I didn't want to die, I'm so young\" afterwards more screaming faces appear around her before a laugh is heard and the demon Jinmen reveals himself to Akira. After some brief dialogue the two battle one another but it is not long before that he damages one of the faces on Jinmen's back, shocked by its screams Akira freezes in his tracks. Jinmen then tells him that the faces upon his back are still alive as when he ate a living creature it would become one with his shell never dying.\n\nThey continue to battle, but Jinmen gets the upper hand as Akira constantly misses trying not to hit the faces. However, Sachiko screams out to Akira and tells him to smash through her and destroy Jinmen. Begrudgingly he does so and smashes through Sachiko's eye and through Jinmen's chest. Jinmen starts to stumble around before Akira grabs him and rips off his shell, killing Jinmen, the faces on his back, and what was left of Sachiko.\n\nZennon's Declaration\n\nThe next time Akira is seen, he breaks the fourth wall and addresses the reader. He tells them that this would no longer be his own drama but the whole world's, including the reader. He then fades away, and not much later the demon's start to go a suicide march merging into people's bodies at random causing many people to die or turn into demons.\n\nDuring the panic Ryo finds Akira, Ryo explains to him what the more intelligent demons were doing by sending the lesser demons to merge with perfectly lucid or normal people meaning they would die in the process. However, he also says that a few of the mergings would work but not many. Ryo panics at several thoughts including how humanity will wreak havoc about this. Akira doubts this saying humanity would not be so weak as they had courage that would conquer fear. However, he is sadly proved wrong when a news report showed the destruction of the city of Tsuringrad which had just been obliterated with a hydrogen bomb, having been fired by the Soviet Union. The report goes on to say that it was necessary to stop the demons.\n\nA few days later Akira reads in a paper about a girl who accidentally killed her two friends with acids ejected from her body, the girls name was Mikiko Kawamoto. He starts to realize that there would be others like him and that he should form together an army of Devilmen to defeat the demons. Immediately after, he gets a phone call from Ryo telling him to look outside. He rushes out to see a gigantic four headed demon, the Demon King Zennon. Zennon announces himself across the world telling humanity that the demons were coming to retake the Earth and eradicate humanity just like they did the dinosaurs. He then announces that the attack will take place in five minutes before teleporting away.\n\nAkira realizes Zennon was the demon Amon had nightmares about previously. When he tells the Makimura's to go hold up in their home, he notices a collection of military vehicles go past. He runs inside the house to find Ryo. Ryo tells him that he shouldn't go out to right now, telling Akira to wait for a later fight. To demonstrate, Ryo opens the window to see a massive armada of flying demons across the Tokyo sky. Akira watches the carnage of the demons and decides to leave, Ryo tries to stop him, but Akira slaps him and leaves.\n\nAkira goes on a rampage and kills many demons; however, he eventually comes face to face with a demoness named Psycho Jenny who uses her powers and knocks Akira unconscious. Suddenly a swarms of demons surround him, Jenny disappears, and the demons move in for the kill. But Akira is saved when the demon General Zann comes flying down and forbids them from killing him after receiving orders from his master, which to everyone's surprise was someone higher than even Zennon.\n\nLater Akira later awakes to find himself in a bed bandaged with Ryo looking over him, Ryo turns on the TV and shows Kyoto burning in flames. Ryo berates him about having gone outside and tells him that humanity had no chance to destroy the Demons. Akira reveals to Ryo about the other Devilmen and about Satan being the true leader of the demons. The TV then suddenly switches showing the entirety of Russia absorbed in a blinding white light, as soon as Ryo sees this, as he screams in terror with Akira stunned by what just happened.\n\nLater that night Akira returns to the Makimura home and is glad to see it mostly undamaged. However, when inside, he sees several dead snakes around the home. Miki tells him they were attacked by a demon named Rosushido, however they were saved by the sudden arrival of Meriken-Jo and Dosu-Roku who kill the demon. Akiko comes through and tells them to watch the television saying that the government had discovered a way to defeat the demons, and the newly designed Demon Busters are shown off to the world.\n\nThe Devilman Corps\n\nLater after Akira had managed to gather together a small group of Devilman, Dosu-Roku comes running to him telling him about a young kid who they suspected to be a Devilman. After Dosu-Roku leaves Akira and the other Devilman join hands and attempt to psychically contact other Devilmen. Unfortunately, they are unsuccessful. They are suddenly mocked by a loud laughter who reveal themselves as the Bonds of Hinduism, they tell them that they would help them and use their psychic abilities to contact the Devilman across the entire world.\n\nAkira is later seen lurking around the anti-demon labs where he grabs Dr. Rainuma the man behind the Anti-Demon Special Corps, he demands to know where his fellow Devilman were. He takes him to Mikiko the girl Akira had earlier read about in the newspaper; he breaks her containment tube and tells her what she was before picking her up and flying her away to safety.\n\nRyo's Betrayal\n\nA little while later Akira arrives at the Makimura home, where the family was waiting along with Dosu-Roku and Masa. Akira, who had had been searching for Ryo, arrives home after having searched for him for a long time. Miki tries to cheer him up and turns on the TV. It goes to the news, and it says that they were holding an interview with Ryo, who had something to share with the world. initially Akira thought that Ryo was going to prove Dr. Rainuma's theories false and explain the Devilman, however instead Ryo shows a videotape. The tape showed Akira's first transformation into Devilman, and at that the others run in fear, Kozo pulls a gun on him, and Miki runs in fear. He grabs ahold of Miki but is warded off by Kozo who tells him to get out, Akira tries to explain but starts to doubt even himself and begins to panic. However, he regains his senses and explains that he was Devilman and he retained his human heart and soul. After that, Kozo advises that he still leave as the Demon Busters would arrive soon, he thanks them before saying he would see Miki again soon before leaving. Unbeknownst to him, Kozo and Akiko are taken in his place by the Demon Busters for having harbored a demon.\n\nAkira later finds Ryo waiting for him as the sun was rising in some rubble. Ryo tells Akira that he should let him do what he wants. Akira, angry at Ryo's betrayal shouts at Ryo, but Ryo remains calm and tells him that a new age was coming soon. Akira calmly asks what he meant by this and decided whether or not he should kill him. Ryo tells him that the demons were no longer attacking and were taking a backseat as they watched humanity slowly crumble, continuing his new age. Akira then starts to realize something, not only was Ryo in league with the demons, but he was also the one masterminding things from the shadows, revealing that Ryo's deep and almost intimate knowledge about the demon race was because he had already witnessed firsthand what demon-kind was capable of before their hibernation. Ryo then tells him that he had Akira merge with Amon not to save the human race, but simply because he didn't want to see Akira disappear alongside the rest of humanity. He finishes by saying that he didn't want to fight the Devilman army and starts to walk away. Ryo says that he wants the Devilman to come with him into the new era, and with that, he turns and walks off into the sunrise. Akira now realizing who Ryo really was, calls out his true name. He turns and briefly looks over before continuing on.\n\nSoon Afterwards, he is joined by Massami Izumi better known as the Devilman Puffurle, He asks her about Satan being as beautiful as an Angel. She tells him about how Satan was an angel who had dared to defy God and was banished from Heaven to earth. She jokes saying that maybe he has seen Satan, he flatly replies saying he had. She turns to ask what he meant but decides against it. Akira had fully realized that his longtime friend and companion was in fact Satan, the fallen angel and \"God of Demon kind\".\n\nThe End of the Makimuras\n\nLater Akira runs into Dosu-Roku who tells him the Miki's parents had both been arrested and were now being tortured. Akira tells him to go and gather all the Devilman he knew. And with that, the entire Devilman army is gathered together as it flies over to destroy the Anti-Demon Corps HQ. The building is slowly brought down, costing the lives of several Devilman in the process. However, after the building finally collapses, Akira begins to explore the basements. He comes across the torture rooms, after looking through for a while he comes across Akiko's body scarred and bloodied hanging down from some meat hooks. He continues to look on through, and he hears someone faintly call his name he turns to see Kozo in a large torture machine. Akira goes over to him, and he has enough strength to call out Kensaku and Miki's name before coughing up his blood and passing. Akira finds the three men responsible, they beg for their lives, but he ignores the pleas and engulfs them in flames.\n\nAfterward, Akira sits and thinks about what had happened. Masami comes and finds him in the basement, she asks what he was thinking, and he replies saying that he was still thinking about Satan and humans. He says that he has realized that the humans are no longer worth fighting for as they became even worse than the Demons. But he then realizes that he still had someone to fight for, Miki.\n\nAs he rushes back to the Makimura residence only see that it had been burnt to the ground and dancing around the flames were Miki's neighbors. They had the body parts of Kenskau, Masa and Miki on pikes being marched around proudly. Akira runs at them and ignites himself on fire wiping out the entire surrounding area. He picks up Miki's head and clutches it in his arms, now knowing he had nothing left to protect and starts to cry.\n\nEndgame\n\nAs Akira gathers the entirety of the Devilman from across the world and prepares for battle. Despite Satan trying to put it off, they are forced into a war by Akira and their two generals Zennon and Psycho Jenny. However, they initially refuse to do so as they had fallen in love with Akira. The two gigantic forces gather and face each other. The war begins and goes on for over twenty years. Unfortunately, Akira loses the fight and is torn in two in the end.\n\nAs Satan sits with him while sitting on a large, isolated rock in the ocean, as Akira stares at the moon. as Satan told him about their father God and how he created the Earth. Satan tells him how they wanted to save the demons and destroy humanity as they were destroying the world they loved. But they realized too late that this made them no better than their father and begs for Akira to forgive them. Akira however had already died with Satan crying, as the Angels descended down around them.\n\nDevilman One Summers Day\n\nSet not so long after his fight with Sirene, Akira is seen on the beach with Miki and Ryo. When Akira plays in the ocean with Miki, Akira starts to swim out far from the shore with Miki only to notice the sky starting to darken. When suddenly a gigantic Sea Serpent Demon named Doelamale bursts out of the water and grabs Miki. The demon starts to mock Akira as it slowly removes her swimming suit and starts to lick her body. Akira transforms into Devilman and the two battle until he finally succeeds in removing its head.\n\nShin Devilman\n\nThe story begins with Akira walking up to his friend Ryo's house, he notices that the plants had all died and realizes that something was in the ground. He hears a noise inside and crashes through a window to find Ryo being attacked by a Caterpillar demon named Oysnas. Akira transforms and quickly kills the demon setting it on fire and throwing it through the ceiling. He notices Ryo screaming in agony he runs over only to see his surroundings change around him.\n\nRyo regains his senses and realizes they were in a kind of timeslip and find out they were in pre-World War I Vienna. There they encounter a man who welcomes them in he introduces himself as Harnisch and a young man named Adolf. While nothing seemed to be wrong, the leave but follow the two men to the home of Schultz the head of the local Jewish Bank. While losing sight of Harnisch and Adolf, they find Schultz revealing himself to Adolf after killing the girl he loved. This allows for Akira to find Schultz and quickly kill him. After doing so the Timeskip starts up again and they are placed inside the Timeskip itself where they discover the Court of Hell.\n\nAt the court, Akira overhears the court's judge Magistrum planning to distort human history by murdering famous human peacekeepers. Among them was Jeanne d'Arc, however Akira arrives just as they attempt to strip her of her armor and begins to taunt the demons before they attack him. However, he quickly transforms and proceeds to slaughter them with ease. He walks up to Magistrum and beheads him. Akira goes to comfort Joanne as she is sent back to her proper time.\n\nThe two then find themselves on an ancient Greek warship going to attack the island of Samothrace. There, in spite of their small numbers, the Samothrace soldiers pull out their rocket launchers and machine guns and wipe out the Greek ship. as Akira and Ryo were taken prisoner where they witness the female demon Nike (who looked like Miki) posing as a God coming down from the heavens and giving advanced weaponry to the people. Akira breaks his chain and sprouts wings from his back and flies to confront her. However, Nike tells the people that he was a demon, and the people open fire. Akira merely blows them away from gusts of wind from beats of his wings and chases after the fleeing Nike. He quickly catches up and fully transforms in Devilman, Nike turns to see him and utters Amon's name before having her arm torn from her body and crashing into the rocks below. Akira follows and finds her, where she tells him that she was a past lover of Amon and is nearly successful in reawakening Amon. But Ryo who had been watching comes up from behind and decapitates Nike with a sword.\n\nNext, they would arrive in France shortly before the French Revolution erupts. Ryo senses a demon and the two of them follow the scent only to find the source coming from Marie Antoinette. They realize that the demon was harboring itself in her body and the two of them confront her before they are teleported into her body. Inside they find the demon Poirsenus infecting her personality, Akira transforms and attacks headfirst at the demon. Ryo tries to warn him against it saying it would affect Marie also, but Akira ignores this and proceeds to violently kill the demon.\n\nThe final jump takes them into America during the eighteenth century where they encounter the Cheyenne Tribe. While they stay there, they make friends with both the chief of the Tribe Crazy Horse and a young girl named Tiana. One day when the two are away from the camp, Tiana and the other villagers are attacked by the 7th Calvary led by General Custer. When the two return they find the camp in tatters and bodies sprawled amongst the wreckage. Motivated purely by anger Akira goes off and confronts the 7th Calvary before slaughtering each and every man.\n\nDevilman Lady\n\nA Match made in Hell\n\nFollowing his death at the hands of Satan, Akira’s spirit is cast down to hell due to being a Devilman and has spent most of his time exploring Hell and the new world that replaced his own. He is first seen by the protagonist, Jun Fudo in the Grumech Embassy but nobody else could see him. It was only after Jun had fallen into the pit of hell that she saw images of the past including Akira as Devilman. Once on solid ground, she encounters Akira (but not recognizing him from earlier). While there, Akira protects Jun from demons while explaining to her what she saw and how Hell works. He explains certain events that happened in the past, including his war with Satan. After being cast down into Hell, Akira found a way out of Hell and discovers that history was rewritten so that he and people in his world never actually existed and has been adapted into a graphic novel.\n\nWith Jun wanting to escape Hell and get back to the living world, Akira decided to act as her guide. On the way, they encounter the Vlava Army where Jun as Devilman Lady is subdued and Akira has to fight the still fused Sirene. During the fight, Devilman berates Sirene for throwing Kaim away for vengeance, not once but twice when she threw his body into a volcano. Sirene stops and is overcome with grief while Akira gives pointers to Jun on how to fight back against Vlava's army. After a quick run-in with Vlava who explains the cycles of demon evolution, Akira manages to pick up Jun and break through defenses to the next quadrant of Hell. Jun is still going through some issues where she was reminded of how she was violated by Vlava's cult and asks for Akira's help in getting past this trauma. Akira does so by making love to Jun in mid-flight.\n\nAs they continue to travel downwards, Akira begins to show Jun more elaborate methods of using Hell's environment to her advantage while explaining to her about Satan. With demons and hell's guardians at every turn, things look bleak but as Jun gets better and the couple grow closer nothing seems to be able to stop them. Akira would comment about how some religions and myths had turned out to be real including the appearance of the Titans. Once at the lowest level of Hell and its cold prison, they find a large demon where Satan was supposed to be but he is not present. Akira leads Jun to the way out and as Jun's psychic presence starts to fade, Akira lacking a physical body cannot take the journey with her. They say their goodbyes, fully aware of each other's feelings.\n\nDevilman Ghost\n\nWith Jun gone, Akira decides to interact with the living world as a ghost to gather information. Going through the timeslip, he confronts Lan Asuka on being Satan but even when he pries into her mind, he can only get images of time going on. Not getting what he wanted Akira travels the timeslip stopping at certain points to help Jun when she is going through personal crises including on how to control her impulses by possessing a man and even appearing at the Grumech Embassy just to be able to see her. Akira laments that he cannot help the woman he loves the way he wanted.\n\nAt certain points, Akira would project his powers into certain objects including a skull Devilman mask to scare off predators attacking Jun. In spite of not recalling Akira's name, she recognizes his abilities and as a way to communicate, creates a costume to go with the mask. Akira uses this costume to fight anyone who would directly harm Jun when she cannot defend herself including Devil Beasts that try to use her for their own pleasures as the Devilman Ghost.\n\nResurrection\n\nAs Akira was in his giant Devilman form would later be seen by Ryo Utsugi as he traveled through Hell but neither party bothered the other as Devilman was lost in thought. In a twist of fate, Akira is brought to the living world through the fetus of Jun after she is impregnated by a male Lan and Akira takes it over. Akira is glad to be able to protect Jun in the living world but is stunned when she is fused with Lan to become Satan. While looking disappointed about the development, Akira as Devilman agrees to work with Satan against the army of God lead by Archangel Michael, Satan's copy. Akira leads the good aligned Devilman but the battle only razes the Earth once again with Akira's fate left undetermined.\n\nTrivia\n\nIn Violence Jack, Jack is revealed to be Akira Fudo, having been revived, split into three different Jacks (Jack, Female Jack, and Child Jack) and dubbed the Human Avatar of Destruction. Each of the three Jacks merge together at the Manga's conclusion to become Devilman once more.\n\nAt the end of Shin Violence Jack, the Skull King is revealed to be Akira. Before this, it had been hinted at by references to the Skull King and Violence Jack's (who is actually Amon) shared past and him having Miki Makamura trapped in his castle.\n\nAkira's ghost form in Devilman Lady is seemingly based upon the Golden Bat, a Japanese superhero from the 1930's noted for its demonic appearance.\n\nAkira (or possibly Devilman from the TV series) cameos in the manga series Animal Kedaman, frozen in ice alongside several other demons from the TV series.\n\nDevilman makes a cameo in the first chapter of the manga My Hero Academia as one of the silhouetted superheroes in Izuku Midoriya's exposition on the origin of superheroes in his world's setting.\n\nAccording to the Go Nagai World Entertainment Bible, Devilman is approximately 2.9 meters tall and weighs 220 kilograms.\n\nName Etymology\n\nAkira's full name comes from the Japanese name of Acala, Fudō-Myōō (不動明王) one of the Five Wisdom Kings of the Womb Realm in Buddhism. Acala is known for being a powerful and intimidating figure who protects mortals from impediments to achieve enlightenment, this is similar to how Devilman protects humanity from the manipulations of the demons."
