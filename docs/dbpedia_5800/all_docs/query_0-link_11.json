        "text": "I first discovered Devilman through the two episode 1987 OVA series which adapts a portion of Go Nagai’s famous manga of the same name. The OVA was a visual feast, filled with gorgeous key animation and color design the likes of which are rarely seen in modern anime. Although I have not read the Devilman manga, every source I can find tells me that this OVA is a nearly perfect adaptation of said manga. Of course, we couldn’t have too much of a good thing because the OVA series only adapted a small portion of the manga, making it inadequate as an adaptation. Devilman was touched on and off throughout the ’90s and early 2000s with various OVAs, none of which tried again to properly adapt the whole series, instead focusing on self-contained or completely original side-stories related to Devilman, none of which are particularly notable. All of this changed with Masaaki Yuasa’s Netflix-supported adaptation of Devilman in early 2018. Devilman Crybaby was mostly great, but it has many things that hold it back from me being able to call it a masterpiece. Above all else, Devilman Crybaby is incredibly ambitious. Using all of the talent behind Masaaki Yuasa’s relatively young studio Science Saru, Crybaby is incredibly visually distinct, falling into a similar style as much of his other works. At its highest moments of animation, Devilman Crybaby is visually unbelievable. With character and monster designs that are almost tame when viewed as a still compared to previous incarnations of devilman, they are brought to life with gorgeously fluid and grotesque key animation that makes them feel as horrifying if not more so than their counterparts from the 1987 OVA. Many of Crybaby’s action scenes are so beautifully designed that they stick out in my mind individually after having seen them without consideration for their narrative tie-in. Making individual animation cuts feel so individually visually memorable is something that few anime achieve. I would loosely compare Devilman Crybaby’s consistency of animation quality to Sword of the Stranger, a film which is for the most part very visually uninteresting but is interspersed with some of the most memorable and well-choreographed action scenes in all of animation. Unfortunately for Devilman Crybaby, it falls into this same camp in both respects. In sharp contrast to its heights, some of Crybaby’s more toned-down moments are much less creative and memorable. Yuasa’s unique directing style does manage to make some of the more flaccid scenes more visually engaging, but in terms of raw creative potential I find myself picturing far too many scenes of characters shot from the side against a plain, uninteresting background. It is this lack of consistency that makes Crybaby hard for me to judge here, because at its heights it had me fired up and amazed at the incredible talent of the staff, while other times I felt numbed by the amount of plain, uninteresting scenes that seem to all be connected to each other when they do appear. I don’t know enough about anime production to know where exactly this could have been improved, but to give an example of a show I feel does this kind of fast-paced gorgeous animation interspersed with laid-back slice-of-life moments right I would point to Kill la Kill as an example. What makes Kill la Kill’s use of this so great is its masterful use of limited and simple animation techniques that manage to make every single scene visually engaging and interesting combined with impeccably animated fight scenes.\n\nDevilman Crybaby’s story draws a lot from the original, and from everything I’ve read it loosely follows the manga all the way through. From my experience with the 1987 OVA, which adapted the manga very closely this does appear to be the case. While Devilman Crybaby makes sure to present the story it is adapting very accurately, it takes a lot of creative liberties in adapting the source material, often outright changing characters, scene locations, and other story elements. For the most part, I feel this was used to great effect in Crybaby’s story. With a production being backed by Netflix, one of the world’s most widely used media streaming platforms, Devilman Crybaby was being marketed more directly than most anime towards the broad and diverse user-base of Netflix. Perhaps because of this, many of the side characters from the original Devilman manga are much more fleshed out as people such as Miki, who is little more than a symbol of someone who Akira cares about in the 1987 OVA. Other characters such as the traditionally generic thugs from the start of the OVA are completely changed into a bunch of rappers, who end up being far from the troublemakers that I went into the story expecting them to be mirroring to be more relevant and relatable to a modern audience. Unfortunately, despite the skill of their rapping, all 4 members of this group of characters feel very halfheartedly forced into the story. They are given a large amount of screen time for characters who end up being completely inconsequential to the majority of what actually happens in the show. This is strange, because one of them was even built up to be a devilman himself, and was possibly gay, or a love interest for Miko, or something? I just feel these characters were in a sort of strange middle-ground between being relevant and being background characters, which isn’t interesting enough for me to truly care about them, but isn’t out-of-the-way enough for me to pass over it easily. In contrast to this, other characters such as Miko are entirely original to Devilman Crybaby, and are characters who I feel were mostly used positively and who tied in well with the rest of the cast.\n\nAs for Ryo Asuka, he is portrayed as a much more Kira-esque mastermind in comparison to the crafty and intelligent Ryo from the original. This fits in well with the use of the media and technology in this story, as Ryo is able to manipulate public consciousness, but at the same time there is little logic explained for why and how Ryo was able to gather so much power and prestige at any point in the show. There was one scene in particular where Ryo was on TV with several world leaders which left me completely baffled as to how he managed to get there. This was not an exclusive moment though, throughout the series Ryo manages to gain control over various people and organizations without even a smattering of internal logic to explain how he is able to do this. Overall though, Ryo is still a decent character despite the lack of evidence for his power due to how compatible he is with Akira. Fudou Akira, the protagonist is very similar to his manga and OVA counterpart, with a couple of notable changes to his character. First, his change in appearance and manner of presentation from human to devilman is much more pronounced here than ever before. In the original OVA, Akira’s physical changes when in “human form” were barely noticeable other than the fact that he was much more muscular as well as the scar-like lines on his upper shoulders. In harsh contrast to this, the Akira from Crybaby starts out as a shrimpy short kid and as soon as he becomes devilman his entire stature, face, and physique change to make him appear much more muscular and matured. I believe this was an intentional exaggeration meant to represent how different Akira felt, as many characters point out just how much he has changed, some even not recognizing his appearance. Akira’s sentimentality and empathetic side have also become more pronounced in this incarnation of devilman, hence the name Devilman Crybaby. Akira’s whole character is now based around his empathy for others, and the extents that he will go to to save and protect others, but especially those who he cares about. Whether this is an improvement is up for debate, but I felt that it was a positive change that was spawned from an attempt to make the series more accessible and relatable for a Netflix-watching audience.\n\nAs for its story, Devilman Crybaby largely follows its source material closely, only changing aspects of its story that make it more accessible to a modern audience. The way the show was able to do this was to add many pop culture tidbits of the current era to its story, such as the inclusion of technology, social media, references to current social issues like police brutality, a soundtrack mostly comprised of hip-hop and dance music, etc. All of this works to tie this story in with the broad audience of Netflix, who are used to their stories being filled with these and aren’t crazy like me, being someone who spends hours searching through obscure ’80s OVAs trying to connect the dots of anime production history. Devilman Crybaby’s narrative stands as mostly positive in my eyes, as it adapts the source material accurately, with a generous but ultimately positive amount of creative liberties which make it more accessible. Unfortunately the story fits into the running theme of this post, this being that it is great, but has a few glaring issues that hold it back from being truly amazing. While the central conceit is as strong as it has ever been for the most part, certain character moments just feel totally unnecessary. With the rapper characters in particular, I felt very confused as to whether I was supposed to care about them or just ignore them as background characters due to their strange nebulous place in the cast. Another issue is that some characters such as Akira’s parents die almost as soon as they are introduced, and then as the episode stews on how upset Akira is about it I was left confused as to why I should care about them in the first place. The only impact that Akira’s parents left on me as a viewer is that they were bad parents. They left their kid behind with another family without him fully understanding why, as they completely fail to raise their own child, only to return and die without any impact. Another issue is that characters such as Miki and Miko feel fleshed out not quite enough to make me care about them beyond Akira’s emotional attachment to them instead of their merit as indivudual characters. There are also certain moments that are outright baffling such as when in episode 9 Akira tries to explain to a crowd of onlookers that Devilmen are not a threat to humankind and are different than humans only for little kids to start hugging his legs. Then the entire crowd appears suddenly awash with a wave of empathy, and completely sympathize with Akira and the Devilmen. This completely broke my suspense of disbelief, and made sure that I couldn’t ever come close to calling this show a masterpiece no matter how much I might have wanted to in the first half. The ending of the story is also strangely paced, and not in a way that makes it interesting. The last episode spends a long time going over exposition from the beginning of the manga that isn’t relevant to the story at this point, only to truncate the ending to a point where it isn’t nearly as impactful as I have been lead to believe as it was in the manga.\n\nDespite all of these issues, I still overall very much enjoyed Devilman Crybaby, and would instantly recommend it to anyone curious about the franchise. As of now, it is the only “complete” adaptation of the story, and it did a pretty damn good job considering the relative lack of experience of some of its staff as well as how effectively (for the most part) it managed to tell the story of Devilman in only 10 24-minute episodes. My complaints were only made to point out what could have made this show the true 10/10 I wanted to give it at its heights of creativity and overall quality."
