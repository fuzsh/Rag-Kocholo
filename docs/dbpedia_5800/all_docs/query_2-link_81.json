        "text": "Disclaimer: This is an old ass post. I probably do not agree with the ideas it presents, and I in all likelihood denounce whatever is written herein. It has been preserved entirely for the purpose of keeping the history and progression of the blog visible.\n\nYesterday I talked about a Devilman entry that I can’t stand, so today, let’s talk about one I actually enjoyed. Shin Devilman is a weird little manga. It was released six years after the original Devilman manga ended and was the first Devilman manga since the first series. Unlike most anime that have “shin” (which means “new” in Japanese) in the title Shin Devilman is not a remake, reboot or sequel, instead it’s a side-story, set between volumes two and three of the original Devilman manga.\n\nThe series sees Akira and Ryou travelling back in time in order to hunt demons which are trying to change history. They travel to many different time periods and meet many historical figures, including Adolf Hitler, Jeanne D’Arc and Marie Antoinette. The series consists of only five chapters, each of which sees our protagonists travelling to a different time.\n\nThe art in this manga is, well, it’s Go Nagai art. It takes some getting used to, but once you do it has quite a bit of charm to it. I will say however, you can see that Nagai’s skills advanced greatly between Devilman and Shin Devilman. Even though the characters still have stiff posing, it’s much better than it was in the original. One of the things that Nagai is best at when it comes to his art, especially in this manga is background art. They have nearly a painterly quality to them, which contrasts with the bold character designs, making them almost pop off the page. He’s also an expert at page layouts and was one of the first mangaka to actually play around with panels, something taken up to eleven in this manga.\n\nThe story in this manga is as said before, weird. It was quite a risky decision for Nagai to make the second manga an unsubstantial spin-off. Of course, that doesn’t stop it from being extremely interesting. Nagai knows how to craft interesting characters and his use of real-life figures in this manga makes seeing what he does with them even more interesting. Probably the best example of this comes from my favourite chapter, in which they meet Marie Antoinette. Instead of painting her simply as a villian, they paint her as a lonely girl, taken from her country of Austria into the enemy cam (that of France) who is being manipulated by a demon pretending to be her friend. It was a really interesting character study on this historical figure\n\nShin Devilman is a weird one. unless you’re already familiar with the source material and know how it ends, don’t read it, as it spoils a major plot twist. However, if you’re a fan of Devilman as I am, this is just another great entry in a fantastic series."
