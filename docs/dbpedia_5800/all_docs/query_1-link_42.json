        "text": "Hi everyone! For the next 5 weeks I will be reviewing Netflix’s Devilman Crybaby. It’s the first great anime of 2018 and I am happy to be reviewing and recapping it.\n\nFirst of all a little background: Devilman is based on the manga of Go Nagai, first published in 1972. It was a sort of re-tooling of a previous manga known as Mao Dante, or better known in the US as Demon Lord Dante. I’ve watched the 2000 Demon Lord Dante, and let’s just say the story was meh. Nagai’s Devilman told a much better and improved story, one that would be made into several TV series, OVAs and movies as well as spin-offs such as Devilman Lady and Violence Jack.\n\nHaving read the manga, I can give some insights into plot changes of this new series. So far they are minor, if a bit puzzling.\n\nOur story begins with the destruction of the Earth and angels. If you are unfamiliar with this story, you’ll likely be confused by this, but most of us know this classic story to see this as the “end” (or perhaps the scene of multiple “ends”, but that’s for another blog post).\n\nAngels descend in front of Ryo’s eyes and he speaks of his lack of belief in love. With love, there is no sorrow. But he would be wrong. We see the Earth and Moon again, and a scene of Ryo’s childhood with his best friend, the naive crybaby Akira Fudo.\n\nAt this point I just want to say that Devilman Crybaby is one of the best examples of what a good reboot can do. The essence of a story remains, but is updated, and the art and design are truly unique. The character designs for this new anime is modern, but the art work, especially in the demon scenes are reminiscent of the late 60s and early 70s psychedelic art. Think Yellow Submarine meets Kanashimi no Belladonna. This artful blend of avant-garde early 60s with modern design is one of the best examples of aesthetic homage, especially since the first anime did not have this wilder style of animation but was standard 60s-70s style Japanese animation. I love it. The only other contemporary anime this reminds me of is the shamefully little-known Kaiba.\n\nAnyways, back to the story.\n\nWe see Akira Fudo as a boy crying over a sick kitten while Ryo disdainfully tells him it will die. The kitten dies and Akira tells Ryo that he is crying as well. I point out this small vignette only to indicate that it will likely be important and also that this is one of our first glimpses that Ryo is kind of a sociopath or at least massively fatalistic for his age. This fatalism is important down the road.\n\nCut to today. We are introduced to Akira and his classmates at their high school track. Miki, his best female friend, is a runner as is Akira. Akira is a bit of a slowpoke, but apparently runs for the joy of it. Or maybe just because Miki does. We also meet Miko, a longer-haired classmate that will be important later, and we see one spaced-out coach that will later enjoy a tasty butterfly. The classmates in the bleachers talk over their cellphones (for this story has been deftly updated for the modern era) about some bizarre murders in the world of running–an athlete died and his running mate appears to not care. We will learn in this episode that bizarre murders and wild orgiastic parties with drugs called “Sabbaths” are a thing in this town.\n\nAkira the titular crybaby overhears this tragic story and cries. His peers make fun of him for crying over someone he does not know, but Miki comes to his defense.\n\nYou’ll notice that Akira is shorter than Miki and most other students. Later, they leave to go to Miki’s home. As in the manga, Akira lives with her family (who are apparently friends with his family) since his are in America–at least in the manga. Perhaps in this anime they are elsewhere. From the second episode, we will see the family is apparently Christian, well-to-do, and treat Akira like a son. Also, despite being well-off, there is only one large screen computer and the youngest boy uses Akira’s password because of his porn habit.\n\nAkira may be “pure of heart” but he’s still a healthy, boy ya know?\n\nAnyways, while heading home with Miko and Miki, Miki decides to run off early for some reason. Perhaps its to meet her creepy photographer friend who just “wants to make her famous”. I don’t know if she meets up with him, but she runs to a pier where she encounters some rapping youths. They are actually quite good at it, and for this series appear to act as a sort of Greek chorus, commenting on their society and their roles within it.\n\nAkira decides to leave Miko (who will run into that creepy photographer we find out in episode 2) to find Miki. He shows up in a boat and just tells the rappers to stop. Stop what exactly, I don’t know, I guess the rappers are inherently threatening? Or maybe he is just meekly jealous. Odd scene, I don’t know. Made more sense in the manga.\n\nHowever, this scene proceeds no further because Ryo rolls onto the scene to dramatically extend his hand and declare that he needs Akira. That’s actually the name of the episode by the way, “I need you”. Akira wastes no time in running to embrace and leave with his long lost friend Ryo. Miki asks who the hell this guy is, and Akira informs her that he is a professor –though a teenager!–and teaches in the United States.\n\nI really have no idea why his character is an academic Doogie Howser, but in the manga he was just a regular teenager with a father that researched demonology. This aspect of the original manga appears to have been scrapped to make Ryo the researcher following in the heels of another professor named Furika. It’s odd, but we’ll get Apocalypse Now-like flashbacks in the jungle.\n\nAkira also just abandons Miki to run off with Ryo, and Miki seems fine with it. Oh well, she’s a scrappy girl, I guess. Though I do wonder why Akira ran to help her in the first place if he was going to bail. I mean, did he feel she was safe now? Was she even in danger at all? It’s the only part of the plot that bothers me in an otherwise excellent anime.\n\nSo, in Ryo’s car we get some exposition about his journeys into the Heart of Darkness with is Professor Kurtz Furika. His professor learns about these savage demons that have been emerging. They live a social Darwinian life of hunger and lust and little heart or empathy. His professor starts to become a demon and immolates himself in front of Ryo to prevent it.\n\nRyo wants to show Akira this world of demons and get it on camera. He takes naive, guileless Akira to a nightclub and apologizes to the latter for “dragging him into it”. Akira happily goes along with it like the trusting sheep that he is. Inside the nightclub we get a very Mature-Rated LSD trip of an orgy complete with drugs and stripper poles. Akira is embarrased to be there, but Ryo wants to show Akira that this Sabbath will bring the demons. The sex and drugs are not enough, so Ryo decides to just break a bottle and start hurting people like the psycho that he is. Akira attempts to stop him, but we see briefly that he is starting to change.\n\nThe blood letting brings the demons and the real LSD violence trip begins. Demons possess the party-goers and they become demons themselves, ripping each other apart, becoming body-horror monsters with toothed ass-cracks and eyes in all the wrong places. Akira is swept up in this and becomes possessed by the demon Amon. As the titular Devil-man, he kills likely just about everyone in the room. Ryo somehow avoids becoming a demon (though there is a good reason for that) and being killed.\n\nWe end episode one with Akira being Devilman.\n\nFor the next episode, we find that Akira:\n\nRemembers little to nothing about the bloodbath the night before.\n\nIs really tall, really strong, and really hungry\n\nThe most amazing thing is how while everyone thinks Akira is just AWESOME now, no one is really that troubled by it.\n\nMiki is curious why Akira is so changed, but she seems unconcerned about his 180 change in personality. She asks if he is juicing, but he denies it, even though he is taller than everyone else now. Really? None of you think that is weird at all?\n\nAkira later finds out about Miki’s creepy photographer dude and tells her that he is trying to take advantage of her and tells her to stop being so earnest. She thinks its fine to be earnest.\n\nI found it to be a great scene in composition and posing.\n\nOther things we see in episode 02\n\nThe return of the rappers as Greek chorus–the best part of their rap is when they talk about how people aren’t “about fighting”.\n\nMiko — the long-haired classmate of Miki– visited that sleazy photographer. Predictably, he assaulted her. She is later seen stimulating herself to the memory of the encounter or perhaps something else.\n\nAkira visits Ryo in the hospital. We see Ryo’s assistant “Jenny” who I suspect is “Psychogenie/psychojenny” later on. She’s too sexy for Akira, who by the way, just openly watches porn on big screens in the school auditorium and has bizarre nightmares of hallucinogenic sex with demons from that Sabbath. Would he have noticed Jenny before the demon-change or is he too sensitive to everything? Difficult to say.\n\nAkira is also massively hungry while talking to Ryo and devours a whole chicken and ham. Ryo wants Akira to eat at his house from now on.\n\nMost importantly, Akira relates how he does not remember much beyond saving Ryo. Ryo tells him he saved all the party-goers attacked by demonds and took him to the hospital. This is clearly a lie, one Ryo indulges in right front of Akira. He watches the video he made of Akira killing everyone.\n\nAkira and Ryo agree to hunt down demons that are killing people by investigating the murders that are happening all over town. In this episode we see Akira kill some demons that attacked a watch-loving priest (and became one himself). I kind of thought it was funny the demons just sort of let “Amon” know that they ate everything already.\n\nWhile Akira does his demon slaying as Devilman, that sleazy photographer from earlier begins taping Devilman. This is bad for Ryo, who does not want Akira exposed (even though he is also doing some taping). He pursues the photographer who is thinking he’s gonna get rich and not dead at all, nope.\n\nFinally, we see Silene in human form with Kaim. For those of you familiar with the manga and older series, these are well-known demon characters. They will feature later, but I’ll leave this screencapture. I always liked her.\n\nAlso, this happens. Taro, Miki’s younger brother finds this on the internet. Make of it what you will."
