        "text": "SPOILERS BELOW!!!!!\n\nAs promised, this is to be the first part of an in depths analysis of Ryo’s character and role in Devilman Crybaby. This is not intended for anyone who has not already watched the show but hey, you do you boo.\n\nRyo/Satan Analysis\n\nSatan’s Plan: To end humanity on Earth to secure a place for demons once more.\n\nWhy: After warring with God and being cast from Heaven, Satan spent his time traveling through the universe until he came to, what we know as, prehistoric Earth. Earth, at that time, was inhabited by demons, whom Satan took a liking to for their ‘simple and straightforward hearts’ and decided to live amongst them.\n\nWhat happened after: God, presumably looking to finish what they started, or wanting to punish Satan further, cleansed Earth of all demon life. This included Satan themselves. But Satan and the demons continued to live on through their individual wills so that they might come back into the world one day. They do, eventually merging, or possessing, the humans that had taken their place.\n\nThe current situation in Crybaby: Satan is reborn as Ryo, though, with all memories of being Satan sealed away. Even still, through his subconscious mind, Ryo plots humanity’s demise.\n\n-History-\n\n-Satan is reborn into an Amazonian tribe of demons, memories sealed\n\n-Said tribe is attacked by a group of humans who’d been tracking the existence of demons through history\n\nSide note: It’s unclear if this attack was random and very well-timed or planned, as Satan’s new form is still extremely vulnerable at this stage and could have been taken out if the humans had planned it properly. The unpreparedness could answer that, actually. Or it could have been underestimation of the enemy. Who knows?\n\n-Satan instinctively flees to protect themselves and is next seen floating through the ocean\n\nSide note: Where exactly Ryo Asuka comes in is iffy. It could be that the expended power caused him to lose the remainder of his memories before then and, with that amnesia, Ryo was “born.” Or he was always Ryo. However, that seems less likely.\n\n-Ryo wakes up to Akira reaching out to him, telling him to not be afraid, and embracing him\n\n“I met Ryo at a pier. He was all wet and rolled up. He was there just like an abandoned kitten.” Akira- Episode 8\n\n-The two spend an undefined amount of their youth together\n\n-Ryo, even then, is callous and unapproachable at best, sociopathic murder child at worst\n\n-Nevertheless, Akira sticks by his side as his only friend\n\n-Upon locating Ryo/Satan, Psycho Jenny comes to retrieve him and, presumably, takes him to live as a “human” until such a time that he regains his memories\n\nSide note: These “humans” would likely be demons.\n\n-At some point during this time, Ryo had begun to develop feelings for Akira\n\n-10 Years Later-\n\n-Ryo unknowingly travels to his place of origin with Professor Fikira\n\nSide note: Professor Fikira is likely part of the group of humans that have been studying demons throughout history. This is very much a theory, as the details are hardly explained at all, but this group is probably responsible for the repairs of the first Sabbath scene, the planting of the humans that “lived” there, and the retrieval of Fikira’s body from the Amazon.\n\n-While there, the Professor becomes possessed by a demon and ends up committing suicide so that he might die as a human\n\nSide note: Fikira’s parting words at different points in the show vary. When shown in the first episode, he says, “A shame, since I came to know more about you.” But during the second showing in episode 8, the dialogue is changed to, “I thought I’d come check up on you.” It could be said that this is poor translating, but I’d like to give more credit to the CBB team than that. So, the theory I’ve come up with is Fikira himself says the first statement. He knows what Ryo is and laments that he wasn’t able to learn more. The second is said by the demon inhabiting Fikira to Satan lying dormant inside Ryo. Take this however you like. I think it’s pretty neat.\n\nSide note: The trip itself could have also been set up by the demons with the intention to help unlock Satan, which, of course, does not happen.\n\n-Ryo rushes back to Japan to meet with Akira\n\n-After the debacle at the docks and Akira’s retrieval, Ryo brings him to Sabbath, the party known for its wild and often deadly nature\n\n-Ryo’s original plan is to film evidence that demons exist in the world so that humans won’t be caught off guard and might be able to prepare themselves to defend against this new adversary\n\n-But, at the same times, he had already acknowledged that that very information could cause wide-spread panic across the globe\n\nSide note: If we’re being honest, Ryo has some of the most round-about, contradictory logic patterns because of Satan.\n\n-Within the club, all is well, until Ryo goes full horror-slasher film\n\nSide note: This is Satan poking their head out, and at the same time, trying to reassure Akira as they’re familiar with his crying habits. Which is… odd… but disturbingly thoughtful… It could be said that there is full Satan take over up until Ryo winds up buried under the feathers of a dead bird demon.\n\n-Ryo acknowledges that he’s responsible for the creation of a terrifyingly powerful being upon witnessing what Akira is capable of when wielding Amon’s power for the first time"
