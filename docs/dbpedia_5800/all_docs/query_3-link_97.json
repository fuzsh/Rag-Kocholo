        "text": "Devilman is a classic manga series by Go Nagai that has inspired many modern classics like Berserk and Neon Genesis Evangelion. That doesn’t give it a free pass though. Any series needs to be able to stand on its own merits. Thankfully, Devilman still holds up, though maybe not as well as it once did.\n\nThere are going to be light spoilers for the summary, but only because the premise takes a while to set itself up. The manga is about Akira Fudo and his friend Ryo Asuka as they deal with the incoming threat of demons, beings that can fuse with other forms of life to become stronger. Ryo manages to convince Akira that demons are real, and that in order to defeat them, they need to fuse with a demon, but still retain their humanity. That’s exactly what happens and Akira becomes Devilman, the demon with a human heart. From there, Ryo and Akira fight demons to save humanity.\n\nIt’s not the most complex of stories in the beginning. The series takes an episodic approach at first and the story mainly consists of stand alone monster of the week stories with a new demon as the bad guy. Luckily, this portion doesn’t last too long and the demons are surprisingly varied. The opening arc of the manga is also strong, so the first portion isn’t a slog to get through. It’s not necessarily great either, but it’s enjoyable enough to draw interest.\n\nThat all changes at the halfway point of the story. There’s not a whole lot that can be said about the change in story structure at the halfway point due to spoilers, but the change is welcomed. The plot becomes very unique and grabs the reader’s attention all the way through the phenomenal finale. The pacing is too fast for the beginning and end of this portion, but this is hardly enough to ruin what is an otherwise great story.\n\nThe characters on the other hand can’t have as much hand waving. The two main characters, Akira and Ryo are great in their own right. Akira starts out very timid and quiet, but becomes a lot more aggressive when he becomes Devilman. He still cares deeply for humans and questions the morality of the situation. Ryo is smart and scheming, but a lot of what makes him such a strong character is present in the second half. They aren’t the best around, but they are done well enough that the series carries a very emotional impact when it needs to. The rest of the characters have some problems. Miki, Akira’s love interest, is barely a character, and she’s the best of the good guys besides Akira and Ryo. Miki is somewhat tomboyish, but her most defining trait is her strong love for Akira. She is likable though, so while she is more of a middle of the road character, she doesn’t drag the series down.\n\nThere are quite a few demons that get characterization too, though most of them are underdeveloped. Sirene is the only one that stands out as having a real semblance of character, while most demons are one dimensional evil beings. A lot of demons have cool and interesting concepts related with them, but they don’t add to the actual character themselves. They do help to further the themes and plot of the story though. Overall, while it would have been nice to see more development for the demons, it is not necessary as most are just one off villains who aren’t around for very long.\n\nWhile the demons may not be deep characters, they have unforgettable designs. The designs of all the demons are unique and unsettling in a good way. The demons stand out among other generic looking demons. These demons have weirdly shaped bodies, unusual limbs and all kinds of dangerous looking natural weapons. They are more reminiscent of satanic demons. The humans are pretty well designed too, though their designs hardly stick out when compared with the demons.\n\nReally, there is almost nothing to complain when it comes to art for this manga. The characters and backgrounds alike come to life thanks to an good amount of detail. The amount of detail can vary though and the humans often come off as lacking. The stances characters make can look off sometimes, but this is more a product of the style. Since Devilman is an older series, it’s art reflects this and can be a turn off to some. The paneling is also very great, and has a lot of variety while never getting unintentionally confusing. There are a lot of creative page layouts that add to the insanity of the manga. The art uses everything that manga has to offer and creates a lot haunting scenes that stick with the reader. There are also plenty emotional moments that would not be nearly as powerful as they are without the masterfully presented art.\n\nThe only thing about the art that isn’t that great is the physical backdrops. The setting is the real world, so a lot of the locations look generic, and they aren’t put in too much detail either. This becomes less of a problem as the manga goes on however, since it adopts more creative backgrounds that don’t have as much to do with the setting.\n\nIt should be noted that Devilman is not a series for the faint of heart. Since this is a Go Nagai manga, there is a lot of nudity, but surprisingly none of it feels too gratuitous. Most nudity is shown in a matter of fact way or for the purposes of unnerving the reader. The main reason Devilman may not be for everyone is the extreme amount of violence in it. While the violence is mostly necessary to present the themes so well, it is very brutal, and can be a bit too much for some.\n\nSPOILERS!\n\nIt’s impossible to talk about Devilman without mentioning the ending. This is not a typical story where the good guys win. At the end of everything, humans and the devilmen lose. The demons win and Earth is lost. It’s a very harsh critique on the nature of man and a powerful antiwar story. The punch in the gut is that Ryo, who was Satan all along fell in love with Akira and ended up destroying what he cared about. The ending, humankind’s descent into madness, and the destruction of society are all rushed, but they still serve their purpose. The reveal that Ryo is Satan may have been a bit too obvious, but at least it didn’t come out of nowhere.\n\nIt’s also impossible to talk about this series without mentioning one of the most disturbing scenes ever put to paper: the death of Miki. This is really the turning point in the story where the reader finally figures out that all hope is lost. The horrific imagery makes this moment so impactful. While the ending does top this part, both are unforgettable.\n\nSPOILERS END\n\nThe truth is, Devilman has a lot of flaws. The characters are overall weak, the story isn’t that strong until the second half, and even then it suffers from pacing issues. There are also a lot of questionable moments. Still, what Devilman manages to accomplish is commendable. This manga does a few things very well, and these few things don’t erase the faults in the series, but they do make it worth checking out. It’s not for everyone, but it’s importance in the world of manga and anime can’t be denied."
