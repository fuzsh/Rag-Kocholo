        "text": "This post contains spoilers for Devilman and some other media that I discuss in relation to it, including Yu Yu Hakusho, Persona 3, Neon Genesis Evangelion, and The World Ends with You.\n\nDevilman is 46 years old – it’s been around for longer than I have existed, and yet I never so much as gave it a second glance until recently. The Go Nagai work which I was most familiar with was Cutey Honey, but the only things I knew about it were its impact on the magical girl genre and the opening animation. The only Devilman content I’d seen was a handful of clips from the badly dubbed ’87-’90 OVAs. With the release of Crybaby, that changed. Discussion and fanart of Devilman exploded overnight, and suddenly I was seeing it everywhere, so I thought, “well, it’s time for me to check it out.”\n\nI assume that most new fans of Devilman came into it through watching Crybaby. My experience was a little different. A guide to Devilman happened to cross my Twitter feed, and going by the OP’s recommendation to start with the original manga, I read all five volumes in about four hours. That was my first experience with Devilman; I finished the manga on January 9th as the clock was approaching 4 AM and I was blown away. Over the course of the past month, I watched the various OVAs and finally Crybaby a few days ago.\n\nWith all of the discussion surrounding it, I became aware that Devilman, like Nagai’s other works, had a huge impact on the anime and manga industries – but I didn’t fully understand the sheer scope until actually reading it. I saw Devilman‘s footprints in my gateway anime, Yu Yu Hakusho; I saw it in my favorite game of all time, Persona 3; I saw it in Evangelion, JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure, The World Ends with You, all of CLAMP’s manga – all works that had a deep personal impact on me. It was everywhere in the things I loved, and I had no idea. I realized I had been a fan of Devilman all along.\n\nIts impact on Yoshihiro Togashi’s works particularly struck me, because Yu Yu Hakusho was my formative media and gateway anime – at the tender age of 11, watching (censored for TV) demon battles on Toonami imbued in me a love for battle shonen that persists to this day. Reading Devilman made me feel like I was 11 again; it got my blood pumping just like those evenings watching Toonami after summer camp was over. Like YYH, it’s fun, it’s intense, its characters are likable, and it has something to say about humans and human nature.\n\nThe Chapter Black saga of YYH absolutely screams Devilman to me. “What if humans are the real demons?” was a theme present throughout all of YYH, particularly in the Rescue Yukina and Dark Tournament arcs, but it takes front and center during Chapter Black. The simplistic idea of “humans good, demons bad” is totally destroyed when we find out that Sensui turned against humanity after witnessing humans’ evil deeds against demons. The evil of humanity is the driving force of his motivation to wipe everyone out. He wants to unleash demons upon the human world so they kill everyone – wait, this sounds familiar, doesn’t it?\n\nBack when I watched JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure in 2014, I was filled with a feeling of wonder: “This is what laid the groundwork for so many of the shonen series I like! And this is where the premise of the Persona franchise comes from!” Discovering JoJo’s and reveling in its influence was magical, but reading Devilman took that feeling even further – it’s part of what laid the foundation FOR JoJo’s itself. There was a bit of dialogue in the beginning of Devilman about Akira giving up his humanity to fuse with a demon – just like how Dio gave up his humanity to become a vampire. Character motivations and alignments aside, the similarity struck me. The musclebound, dark-haired hero in a fated battle against a blonde man he was once close to, all building up to a tragic end – with an undercurrent of classic horror and punctuated by bloody battles with monsters – make Devilman‘s influence on JoJo’s, particularly Phantom Blood, clear. Reading JoJo’s and then Devilman three years later made me feel like I was dismantling the brickwork of not only the industry, but also my personal taste, and seeing what lies underneath.\n\nIt’s already painfully obvious that Evangelion is just Hideaki Anno’s Devilman fanfiction – Anno himself has cited Devilman among his inspirations for Evangelion. I first watched Evangelion in 2013 (late to the party, I know), and it instantly became one of my favorite series of all time. Not only was Evangelion incredibly influential on the industry as a whole, it is also a show of massive personal importance to me. Its exploration of the human condition really cut me deep. As someone who struggles with connecting with people as well as depression, anxiety, and self-esteem issues, seeing Shinji struggle with the same things was cathartic and validating. It’s obvious that pretty much all of Evangelion is a reflection of Devilman – from the abundance of religious motifs and apocalyptic imagery to Kaworu to the implied time looping in the Rebuild movies. The final scene in End of Evangelion also has a striking resemblance to the end of Devilman, which becomes even more obvious in Crybaby in some sort of delightful ouroboros of references. Kaworu, from being an angel and an antagonist to being in love with the main character, is clearly a Ryo expy. Considering how iconic Evangelion is and how much of an impact it had on me, I really enjoy being able to trace its influences like this.\n\nKaworu being the most obvious one, I see homages to Ryo Asuka everywhere. Ryoji from Persona 3 and Joshua from The World Ends with You are some of the first to come to mind, since those games are my favorite video games of all time. Both of them check all the boxes. Human-looking character that turns out to be a nonhuman, incomprehensible being, wings included? Check. Close to the main character? Check. Turns out to be an antagonist in the end? Check. Connection to bringing about the apocalypse? Check. Nonhuman being who learns human emotions of love and friendship and changes for the better? Check. The resemblance is uncanny on Ryoji’s part especially; he falls in love with the main character, just like how Ryo falls in love with Akira. (It’s explicitly stated in the female route of Persona 3 Portable that Ryoji would still like the protagonist even if they were a guy, so even in the male route, it applies.) (For the record, there’s also gay subtext in Joshua’s writing, although it is sadly not made explicit.)\n\nSpeaking of Persona 3, its connection to Devilman manifests in more than just Ryoji. (Well, obviously, since the Persona series is a spin-off of Shin Megami Tensei, which has major influences from Devilman, but I’ve never played those games.) Again, apocalyptic themes are explored, and as we see in Persona 3 FES, it is brought upon by humanity. Devilman‘s apocalypse was started by demons, yes, but ultimately fueled by humanity’s violence and mass fear. Similarly, in Persona 3, the only reason why the Fall is happening is because humanity wants it to happen. The collective death wish of humanity (Erebus) grew so powerful that it was able to call out to Nyx to cause the apocalypse. These are two different takes on human nature – Devilman‘s being “humans will willingly kill out of fear/mass hysteria” and Persona 3‘s being “humanity will passively wish for death without doing anything to improve the circumstances that made them think that way” – but both ultimately say that humans will cause their own demise.\n\nSo, Devilman influenced some of my favorite, most formative anime and video games to date… what else? Oh yeah, my favorite manga group. To put it elegantly, CLAMP owns my ass. Cardcaptor Sakura is among my favorite magical girl anime; I’m still waiting for them to finish X; one of the first manga series I ever read was Tsubasa – I still have every volume on my shelf and it remains one of my favorites to this day. They are truly masters of the craft and the stories they tell are beautiful and unlike anything else in the medium – well, almost anything. The influence Devilman had on manga mogul group CLAMP is undeniable, especially considering the group drew a doujinshi for it in 1991. The influence can be seen in all of their works. Just skimming through a summary of Devilman Lady (no, I haven’t fully read it) and seeing the convoluted time loop nonsense, I could see the resemblance to CLAMP’s Tsubasa, especially with the reveals at the end of both. An angel falling in love with a human is the premise of Wish. Human nature, religious motifs, and apocalyptic, dark themes are front and center in X. I don’t want to get into any more spoiler territory than I already have, but Kobato‘s plot also involves religious motifs and themes. The list goes on. I also have a feeling that CLAMP’s tendency to crossover so many of their works is inspired by Go Nagai’s tendency to do the same with his own series.\n\nThis barely scratched the surface of Devilman‘s reach – its footsteps are everywhere. Reading it and discovering that reach for myself – not only in the industry as a whole but in my favorite series, specifically – was an enlightening experience. It was nostalgic and new all at once. It allowed me to look back and see my favorites in a new light.\n\nThere’s a lot more that I can say about Devilman, but that’s all I have for this week. Let me also announce that next week’s post will be delayed. I want to write about the results of the Anime Awards, and since those are being announced on Saturday, my regular schedule of posting every Saturday at noon will have to be disrupted. I’ll try to write up a post ASAP after the results come out, so hopefully I’ll have it up by Sunday or Monday of next week!"
