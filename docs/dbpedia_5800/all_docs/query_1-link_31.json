        "text": "After over 40 years, the original Devilman manga finally got a full adaption in the form of Devilman Crybaby. The strengths of this series still hold up today, and it’s still just as shocking today as it was then. Devilman Crybaby is certainly an anime to remember.\n\nThe story begins with the main character Akira Fudo meeting up with his old friend Ryo Asuka. Ryo has something important to tell Akira: demons are trying to take over the world. In order to combat the demons, Akira must become Devilman. He gains the body of a demon, but retains the heart of a human and fights off the evil demons.\n\nThe story is very simple in the beginning, but it does gain more complexity near the finale. For the most part, Devilman Crybaby is an episodic series with each episode bringing up a question related to demons or one of the main characters. Not every episode is a monster of the week type of story (though many are), and some are more about how the characters deal with situations around them. This variance makes the anime interesting enough at the start to keep watching.\n\nThe story does end up feeling more connected in the second half, but each episode still has something distinct about it with a complete meaning. There are some odd pacing choices though. A lot of backstory is saved until the final episodes, and it feels rushed and tacked on at that point. Some conflicts are built up while others are introduced with very little warning.\n\nThe second half is of course, very intriguing, and the ending is the strongest part of the show despite the issues. There are so many powerful moments and the story is very unique, that the flaws do not ruin the experience.\n\nThere is also a fair amount of running in this anime. Many of the characters are part of the high school track team and a good amount of focus is put on the characters running. While it does add more to the characters, and it makes for some nice thematic elements, the running ultimately does not add much, and can feel aimless in regards to story and messages.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the story will sometimes shift focus to the character’s daily lives, and while this fleshes out the characters, the characters are sometimes not engaging enough to keep the viewer’s interest. Akira Fudo is (like the title implies) a crybaby, but he’s also good hearted and cares for others. He is often seen crying even as Devilman. Ryo Asuka in contrast is unfeeling and violent. The two make for a good dynamic, but it’s sometimes puzzling how they are friends since they are so different. There are plenty of moments that show their friendship, though, and these moments are rather strong.\n\nMiki Makimura and her family take care of Akira since his parents are away. Miki loves running and is a little too trusting in people. She’s not as fleshed out as Akira or Ryo, but she is likable. Miki Kuroda (Miko) is another runner on the track team. Miko may not be as good at running as Miki, but she is more ambitious and jealous of Miki. She too is not as explored as Ryo or Akira.\n\nThere are also plenty of other side characters in Devilman Crybaby, and none of them get a huge amount of focus. They are all likable if they are supposed to be, so it’s easy to get behind them when the anime focuses on them. They help bring the world to life and flesh it out, but can occasionally take away from the other characters. Some of the conflicts that revolve around just side characters also fall a little flat because of the lack of focus.\n\nOverall, the cast is above average. Akira and Miko go through some decent arcs, and Miki is likable enough. Ryo is a bit more troublesome, but a lot of his major moments contain spoilers, so it’s hard to go into detail. The demons are sub par, but most are just monsters that show up once, so they don’t bring the show down. On a final note, the relationship between Akira and Miki is only okay. The anime couldn’t seem to decide whether or not there was actual love between them.\n\nSadly, the world of Devilman Crybaby is not that fleshed out. The demons get the short end of the stick since they seem to come from nowhere, and they are not fleshed out as a race. There are also many demons who are introduced as important only to ultimately do nothing and feel like a pointless distraction.\n\nThe art direction for the series is unique to anime though not for the director. Masaaki Yuasa’s style is present here and it works fairly well for the most part. The humans all see an update to their designs and look pretty good. They are all well defined and able to change expressions and form when needed to for an emotional or comedic scenes. On a side note, the few comedic scenes are pretty good. They have a weird humor to them that a lot of characters don’t react to which makes them work better.\n\nBack to the designs, the demons do suffer a little from this art style. Since the art in general is less detailed, demons often come off as multi colored blobs with the occasional mouth and claw. The humans don’t need to be as detailed since the focus is on the emotions they make, but the demons don’t look threatening or that interesting.\n\nThe animation is very good though. The less detailed art allows for more focus to be placed on movement, which allows for a lot of breathtaking fight scenes. There is also the running animation, which has replaced the Naruto run as the default anime run (at least in the anime community). The backgrounds are also pretty interesting, even if they sometimes feel a bit too avant garde (the last supper painting). They usually don’t distract from the movements on screen though.\n\nAs for the sound, Devilman Crybaby succeeds marvelously. Every track is great and the music is almost always used well, though there some exceptions (the background to a government meeting should not be a dubstep song). The voice acting is also great across the board except for one minor hiccup with Ryo. In a few of the episodes, Ryo speaks in English not Japanese, and it sounds terrible. This is especially infuriating since the series released alongside an English dub, so there was an English voice actor that could have done these lines instead. There are also some moments of freestyle rap that actually turn out pretty good. Finally, the sound effects are effective at conveying the magnitude of the action present. None stand out as bad or overused.\n\nThe opening and endings on the other hand are just okay and nonexistent respectively. The opening has a cool song and unique visuals, but the colors are all gray and the song gets old pretty fast. There is no traditional ending, just ending credits, which an ending isn’t technically necessary, but it would’ve been nice to have one.\n\nA final warning: there are a lot of scenes depicting sex, nudity, and violence in this anime (it is adapted from a Go Nagai work after all). A lot of violence is demon blood (which is yellow), but there is also a lot of human violence. Most of it is required for the moments to be as powerful as they are. The sex and nudity feels less so. The themes related with these elements are very surface level and don’t add a whole lot, but it’s not done in an overly gratuitous way.\n\nSPOILERS!\n\nAgain, it’s impossible to talk about Devilman in general without mentioning the ending or Miki’s death. This time around Miki’s death is a lot more dramatic, but it’s also more drawn out, and the deaths of the rappers also take away from the moment somewhat. It’s still very powerful though. The actual ending is also still a highlight, though it too is drawn out. There are quite a few flashbacks that show the origin of demons and some past moments between Ryo and Akira. These ultimately end up cheapening the finale, but not to the point of ruining it.\n\nThere are a few moments like this throughout the series, moments that are powerful, but not the best they could be. When Akira is forced to fight Jinmen who has taken over his dad and absorbed his mother, Akira goes through a big character moment, but Akira’s relationship with his parents was mainly built up on with his mom and only in that episode. When Taro turns into a demon, and his father must kill him because Taro is eating his mother, it’s a very emotional scene, but the mechanics make little sense. No demons have taken as long as Taro have to transform, and none have shown as much past human traits as Taro did. He’s this nonsensical mix between devil and devilman.\n\nFinally, Zennon is the most unintentionally hilarious villain I have seen in a while. He was introduced so randomly, and showed up at the most convenient times only to do nothing. He’s only there to make callbacks to the manga.\n\nSPOILERS END\n\nOverall, Devilman Crybaby is exceptional. It accomplishes a lot, though no moment is perfect. There is a lot wrong with this series (just like the original manga), but the good particularly outweighs the bad. There is a lot to like here, and this is definitely an anime that will be remembered."
