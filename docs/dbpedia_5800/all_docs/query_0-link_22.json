Like how they could ruin the ending like that? The lesson in Devilman is that everyone contributed this to happen, Akira too. He spent decades slaughtering humanity or trampling on them because of his grudge and battle against Satan. That was the moral of the “horror” of war and that everyone was a demon. The baton-thing was a good idea for “symbolic” miscommunication but it fell short because it was impossible to communicate with Satan, unlike the manga, where you feel by the last scene that humanity and demons (which are revealed to be one and the same in Devilman Lady lol - demons are just a step up in natural evolution for men) could have been saved if the two of them stopped and talked things out. Because of this exchange which the anime skips since Satan apparently doesn’t give a damn about anything except Akira (who they fail to realize their feelings for until the end?):"
