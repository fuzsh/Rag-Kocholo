        "text": "<–Pre-order your copy of Go Nagai’s Devilman in hardcover here–>\n\nHi everyone! It’s my final recap and review for Devilman Crybaby, though I may return to this story later in the month to add my additional thoughts. For now, I’m going to give my recap (full of spoilers obviously) for the final two episodes of Devilman Crybaby.\n\nIn the ninth episode, we start where the last episode left off. Everyone left in the Makimura house (which is only Miki [having just lost her family],the rapper boys, Akira,and Miko) has just watched a special report on TV from Ryo. Ryo, who has risen in society to become a voice of authority I’m guessing from his natural charisma, has just told everyone that all demons originate from humans. In particular, those humans acting strangely or dissatisfied with society. He has told everyone around the world to kill anyone fitting that description, which is pretty much anyone viewed as “odd”, anyone who has ever protested, or anyone just having a bad day. Also bad: he showed the video of Akira fusing with Amon. And Miki and Co. just saw that video.\n\nThe rapper boys understandably freak out as Akira weakly tries to tell them that it was not him killing people on that video, and though a Devilman, he would not hurt them. Remember, too, that up until this point Akira had no idea that he had killed any humans–Ryo had carefully hidden this from him. Akira is just as shocked at himself. However, Miki walks in the room and assures everyone that Akira is still a crybaby and a caring person at heart. Wamu and the rappers understand. Well, except that short rapper. He’ll betray them later.\n\nAkira decides that he must leave and confront Ryo to see what the hell he is up to releasing this video and making everyone even more dangerously paranoid.\n\nAfter he leaves, Miki, Miko, Wamu and the rest of the rapper boys realize they are not safe at the Makamura house and must leave. Wamu, cool kid that he is, gives Miki his pearl earring as a safety charm. She happily accepts it, but states that she feels she will never see Akira again. Miki goes upstairs to pack some of her younger brother Taro’s things as a memento (his room was full of Devilman stuff, naturally). Miko goes up to talki with Miki and finally pours her heart out for her.\n\nShe tells Miko that she hates Miki. Miko had been the fastest girl until Miki beat her in running, and with that went her confidence and identity. She became Miko, her name gone, forced to live in Miki’s shadow. Yet, despite that, she still loves Miki. Mike tells her that she knew about Miko’s feelings all along–Miko’s hate and Miko’s love. They embrace, Miko having forgiven Miki and finding peace.\n\n<–Pre-order your copy of Go Nagai’s Devilman in hardcover here–>\n\nJust prior to this exchange, Miki writes on her “Nonstagram” social media thingy what will be her final post. She writes that Akira is not the evil demon that people saw on TV. She writes that anyone that can feel empathy and can care for others, who can cry for others like Akira, is a wonderful person to her, be they human or demon. If everyone loved like Akira, the world will be a better place. As she is typing this, we see people trolling her–some call her ugly, a “stupid Asian”, some insinuate that her parents had a vegetarian restaurant with human meat, that she is a demon-loving slut, and that Akira is playing her. We also see someone doxxing her (it is likely the short rapper boy that had seen Miko’s bag with Kukun’s sunglasses–he had put two and two together that Miko killed Kukun). Yup, it’s just another day for a popular girl on social media.\n\nBut we also see others come forward that they are Devilmen. One has told his wife. Miki is happy and reassured by this, that others are coming together to support Devilmen. People around the world are reading Miki’s posts and responding either in solidarity or in negativity (does everyone read Japanese, or are they all reading auto-translated Instagram posts?) This entire Instagramming scene plays over another scene that I will get to in a bit.\n\nAfter Miko and Miki make up, the demon-killing brigade has come. Wamu and the guys fend off the weaopon wielding humans and kill who they can. Tako the cat is killed and automatically becomes an awesome Devilcat (heh). Miko changes into a spider demon and takes Miki on her back to the roof where they make their escape.\n\nAs they flee, Miko and Miki talk about how much they enjoyed running together. Miko declares her love for Miki. Miki tells Miko she loves her too.\n\nThe demon-hunting brigrade catches up to Miko and shoots her. In a great scene, the dying Miko commands Miki to run and escape and then interrogates the hunters, demanding, “What does it mean to be human? What does it mean to be good?” They do not answer and cannot answer as they have lost their empathy and thus what it means to be human.\n\nMiki runs ahead, thinking about Akira and Miko as children, passing the baton to each other, their symbol of friendship, of living. Miki reflects that running is special to her, because it feels like change happens with every step forward, trivial change, but still change. As Miko has passed the baton to her [symbolizing her love], she passes it in her mind to the only one of the childhood trio left, Akira. Miki is stabbed in the back and killed by the hunters. They have been betrayed by that short rapper.\n\nNow, lets back it up a bit to before Miko, Miki, and the rappers (all of which are dead) were forced to leave. Akira had left to confront Ryo flying away in Devilman form. Before he can meet him,however, he sees below a stadium in which humans are being stoned to death (and likely about to be burned at stakes judging from the kindling stacked at their feet) by other humans.\n\nHe descends and tries to plead with the humans to stop. They are killing their fellow humans. He cries and lets himself be hurt by the rock throwing adults to show that he means no harm, that the Devilmen with human hearts and the falsely-accused humans have done no harm. Throughout this scene, we get an overlay of Miki’s Instagram post describing how Akira cries for everyone, but not himself. Eventually, a small child in the crowd realizes what he is doing is wrong, and puts down his rock. The boy goes up to Devilman and hugs him. Adults look on in shock, but the other children do the same. When the people realize that the Devilman is not evil, they come back to their senses, return to empathy. They untie the people they had prepared to kill and apologize.\n\n<–Pre-order your copy of Go Nagai’s Devilman in hardcover here–>\n\nSuddenly, however, Koda the devilman arrives and attacks Devilman, apparently catching the latter unawares. Other demons start to attack Akira, so he leads the fight away from the stadium to protect the other humans (many of which apparently got killed by Koda or other demons). They fight, and Akira kills Zennon who has never liked Akira. Akira realizes suddenly that he must run back to Miki to protect her.\n\nHowever, he has arrived too late. It is a scene of horrific carnage and human evil. Wamu, Miko, the other rapper boys, and Miki have been dismembered by the humans and their limbs and heads proudly displayed, impaled on poles.The people that have killed them are waving the grisly poles about with glee, no doubt feeling righteous at having killed “demons”.\n\nAkira wails in grief and shock and anger. All that he has lived for is gone, killed not by demons, but by humans who in their fear have become as malevolent as demons. He curses mortals and the episode ends. We get a coda at the credits with a rather nice ending song, and a long scene of Miki riding behind Akira on his motorcycle. It’s a lovely scene, remembering their love and friendship and certainly better than ending this episode on a completely downer note.\n\nOn a side note, I do want to point out something about Akira and Miki. While the manga and most anime adaptations portary as Akira and Miki as boyfriend/girlfriend, the dynamic seems a bit different here. Akira certainly is in love with Miki–I don’t think that is different. But I do feel that Miki felt more of a sisterly love for Akira. In the entire series, she has kept emphasizing that Akira is her family. She says this multiple times. This makes for an interesting dynamic between the three childhood friends. Miko is in love with Miki. Miki says she felt the same for Miko. Miki loves Akira–though likely only as a sister. Akira is in love with Miki.\n\n<–Pre-order your copy of Go Nagai’s Devilman in hardcover here–>\n\nNow for the next and final episode.\n\nWe open with a scene of a lovely seaside town with sheep. It is the old home of Akira and his family and is where he found Ryo as a child.\n\nRyo earlier had been looking fondly at old photos of him and Akira. Ryo and Akira making an igloo, Ryo on top of the igloo on the outside, digging in. Akira (but not Ryo) making snow angels. Why did Ryo show that horrendous video of Akira to the world? Because he wanted Akira to come find him, to meet him at the old seaside village where they had played and talked as children.\n\nAkira finds him. He is angry and full of grief and has Miki’s head in his arms. He interrogates Ryo, demanding why the latter has done such a destructive thing, encouraging humans to kill one another. He yells at Ryo, “You’re a human too!”\n\nRyo declares he’s not. He is Satan. And the wings unfurl.\n\nSatan, the beautiful blonde hermaphrodite being [who, throughout the rest of this review will now be referred as “they” reflecting their male+female nature], tells Akira their story. They had rebelled and fought against their father, God. God cast Satan out. The exiled angel then found the outpost planet that was Earth and became enamored of the demons with their “simple hearts”. When God decides to kill the demons he didn’t plan on, Satan decides to fight alongside the demons to protect both their own and the demons’ lovely planet and home. The demons and God’s remaining angels fought for a long time, resulting in the Earth suffering a massive extinction. However, the immediate battle against God’s angels was won. Sata, however, new their fight against God was not completely over. While the demons still existed as bodiless “sheer will” and some would later merge with other beings to become the vampires and sphinxes and werewolves of lore, most demons would remain dormant. Satan would also become dormant until the time that they would be needed to re-emerge and fight God.\n\nMillions of years passed, and life replenished the Earth and humans arrived. To the demons waking up, this was a usurpation of their own planet by new invaders. These humans needed to be dealt with before the upcoming return of God.\n\nInto this world of billions of humans, Satan re-emerged as a human boy somehow winding up in a South American village (was the boy left there by researchers, or born to a native woman?). Satan had no memories of themselves as an angel, these memories having been repressed by Psychojenny so that Satan would learn the secrets of humanity by firsthand experience. Satan and the demons were pretty pissed that humans had taken over the Earth and made it polluted and crappy. By having Satan grow up as a human boy, Satan could learn their weaknesses to destroy the humans. With the humans out of the way, they could focus their efforts on the final battle against God who would would surely come back after the sudden re-awakening of demons. One thing I did not understand with this scene, though. Why were those military people attacking the villagers? How would they have known about Satan being there? Nobody knew about demons yet! At any rate, in an effort to defend himself, Ryo destroyed everything in sight in his Peruvian village and flew to Akira’s seaside town, where Akira found Ryo and reached out to him to take care of him until Jenny took Ryo home a few years later.\n\nSatan’s plans to end humans and take back Earth have so far gone as planned. What Satan had not planned on was their friendship with Akira. Subconsciously, Satan had made Amon possess Akira to protect him in the upcoming war. Satan knew that unless Akira was a Devilman, the latter would perish. Satan tells Akira to join with them to live in the new demon-world together. Akira is angry and vows to kill Satan for what the angel has done to the world, to the people he loved.\n\nAkira leaves to bury Miki’s head. Devilmen arrive behind Akira to serve him and fight with him to protect what little is left of the humans that are quickly decimating each other with nuclear bombs. Tako the Devilcat is Akira’s second-in-command by the way. I just thought that was awesome.\n\nPsychojenny later asks Satan if everything is fine. Satan replies that everything is fine, though they clearly seem sad. It is clear that Satan does not want to fight Akira, but will do so regardless. They are at odds now.\n\nTime passes and we see that cities are leveled and much of the world is destroyed by the battles between the few humans (some of which are doing experiments on devilmen–still killing the very devilmen that could save them) and demons.\n\nEventually, Akira kills all of Satan’s demon legions including Koda. Psychojenny, my girl, is killed by humans who manage to repel her amazing rainbow telepathy with some kind of forcefield thing.\n\nAll the devilmen die, and all the humans. Satan and Akira finally fight. As they fight, we see a montage of the baton-passing relays of their childhood. Miko passes her baton to her beloved Miki, Miki passes the baton to her friend and brother-figure Akira, and Akira tries to pass the baton to his best friend Ryo. But Ryo never picks up the baton. The scene, replays over and over again, with Ryo never picking up the baton, even giving Akira a quizzical look like a dog. Akira through his fight with Satan simply wants Ryo to pick up the baton, to accept love from others and from him. It’s not that Ryo never felt love–Ryo/Satan clearly is in love with Akira–it’s just that Satan never acknowledges this, refuses to see it.\n\n<–Pre-order your copy of Go Nagai’s Devilman in hardcover here–>\n\nFinally we come to the ending scene. The battle is over. Satan looks up at the starry sky, clear now that the humans and their pollution is gone. Satan explains to Akira that they had never understood why Akira told them as a child that that they were crying as much as Akira was over the dying cat (the cat symbolizes humanity, in case you didn’t pick that up). Ryo/Satan never believed in sorrow, because they never believed in love. But in reality, they simply did not BELIEVE that they did not believe in love. Or had forgotten, consciously. Because now Satan feels sorrow, and thus love. Satan had been in love with Akira. As Satan turns to talk to the suspiciously silent Akira, we realize that Akira’s lower half of his body is gone. He is dead. Satan cries. They insist that Akira speak to them, but of course, he will not. Satan now remembers love, their own love, and thus their own sorrow but it is too late.\n\nWe see the host of angels descending to destroy Earth once again (easy, now that everybody’s dead, cool plan there God).\n\nEarth is destroyed, as it was at the opening of the series. And as the destruction of the Earth initially created a moon, this destruction creates another moon. Two moons circle together around a new Earth full of life.\n\nI will write another post later this month about my thoughts around the meaning of these series, one of the best reboots of anything I have ever seen.\n\nWhile this ending may seem glum, it is not as nihilistic as some may think it. The words of Miki about always running forward, seeing life change just for a bit I feel is a metaphor for human moral progression. I’ll expand upon it later, but this was largely a show about love, marginalized people, and humanity’s start and stop progression to social awareness and thus compassion. Remember when Akira the child said that Ryo was crying too? Ryo already felt love. And he already felt sorrow. His seeming apathy was a form of self-preservation against the rejection he felt from God. Satan might have learned to be aware of his ability to receive love too late, but I think he will learn that compassion again.\n\nFor those of us that have read some Go Nagai’s Devilman manga, you may already know that the world of Devilman exists in a sort of time loop. It’s not one in which everything resets the same as before. While before one moon circled the earth, outside looking in, now two moons circle the earth, able to keep each other company. I highly recommend all of you read this excellent post from Art-Eater about Yuasa’s use of symbolism, by the way.\n\n<–Pre-order your copy of Go Nagai’s Devilman in hardcover here–>"
