        "text": "[WARNING – MILD EPISODE 1 SPOILERS]\n\n[SECOND WARNING – THIS SERIES IS VERY R-RATED. NOT FOR THE FAINT OF HEART]\n\nRating: 7.2/10\n\nDevilman: Crybaby, based on the original Devilman manga from the ’70s by Go Nagai (the mangaka behind classics like Grendizer and Mazinger), is the latest anime to be produced by Netflix, following some of their other anime productions like Neo Yokio. The entire season was released on the 5th of January to some very rave reviews. Ultraviolent and ultrasexual, it gives an entire new meaning to the phrase over-the-top. But beneath all the blood and breasts, there’s a heart keeping this work human and empathetic, and this humanity stems from our main character Akira Fudo and his young peers.\n\nAkira Fudo is a shy naïve high school student with a heart of gold. He’s very reminiscent of classic shounen protagonists (make no mistake, this is NO shounen anime), in that he is unequivocally good. But his unflinching sympathy for others (symbolised by his constant crying for others, i.e. the Crybaby in the title) makes him very empathetic, and drives you to root for him. His character isn’t very well-developed, which is a weakness of the series, but his single-minded goodness works because it is the constant, the highest point on the spectrum of good that you will use to compare all the other heinous acts that take place in this VERY dark series.\n\nOne odd day, Akira is reunited with his childhood friend Ryo, who asks him for his help with his investigation into demonkind after having non-chalantly sprayed a pier with machine gun fire to scare off some rappers. Soon they attend a drug-fueled rave/orgy, waiting for demons to be drawn to the debauchery. When the demons don’t show, Ryo decides to kickstart the party by going on a rampage, slicing party-goers right and left with a broken beer bottle to Akira’s horror. As the blood flows, Ryo gets his wish. Demons begin possessing the party-goers, which leads to some of the most sickening human-monster transformations and human mutilation I’ve ever seen in a fictional medium this side of Elfen Lied. Heads, limbs, even genitals fall prey to this grotesque transformation-animation. In the end, and according to Ryo’s plan, Akira is possessed by the most powerful of demons, Amon, and goes on his own rampage massacring the other demons, and bringing the first episode to a close.\n\nPhew. And that was just the first episode! Over-the-top gets a whole new meaning with this series. Despite all this insanity, the anime finds time to slow down and enjoy smaller, quieter character moments that resonate powerfully. These are quite plentiful in fact, despite the rough bloody exterior of the overall anime. The supporting characters are the series’ strongest point. Miki, Akira’s childhood friend and love of his life, is a beacon of kindness in the story’s otherwise horrid world, and serves as Akira’s emotional centre. Miko, Miki’s timid and competitive track race partner, goes through a heartbreaking character arc as a result of her jealousy of her high school friend. Miki’s family also plays a big role, acting as Akira’s safety net and shelter from his demonic escapades. Finally, the rappers also serve as quite the sympathetic group, unlikely heroes in their own way.\n\nThe stories of all these side characters come together and enrich the main narrative and its themes, though this isn’t to say that some side characters aren’t mishandled, whether by rushing or plain bad writing. This is true of several elements in the narrative. Certain characters get killed off before their stories or foreshadowed interactions can take place. One character’s fate is dealt with off-screen, playing into a later supposed tragedy that doesn’t unfold in the impactful way it should have because the circumstances of their demise are left unexplained. This tragedy has a huge, heartbreaking impact on the series’ final act, yet with the unresolved plot point lingering in my mind, I could never come to terms with the way the events unfolded, and was left with a very bitter taste in my mouth (and excruciating pain in my heart). These moments of loss and tragedy are very powerful in Devilman, because the series succeeds in making you care for its characters, even when some things just don’t make sense.\n\nYet at other times, and to the anime’s great detriment, it throws in drama and tragedy that is unearned and exploitative, just for the sake of shock value. The story throws these moments in to layer anguish over more anguish, even when the progression of events up until that point doesn’t logically lead to what eventually transpires, and I found that to be a bit of a betrayal on the writer’s part. It never feels right when a story tries to coax certain emotions out of its audience that it has not earned, and Devilman makes this common misstep several times, which ultimately cheapens the experience. Another fault with the series is that it gives the antagonist’s motivations and backstory all in one big exposition dump – in the last episode. Therefore, the ending doesn’t hit as hard as it should, as the antagonist was barely explored throughout the series, and trying to make us empathise with them in the last episode after everything’s said and done just doesn’t work.\n\nThe tragedy that occurs in this series is very powerful when it works, and when it hits you, it hits you very, very hard, a testament to the character writing. The series never plays coy about its dark and mature themes, and as it progresses, it just gets darker and darker, to a point where you lose all faith in humanity, and feel a void gape inside you.\n\nA highlight of this production is its highly inventive soundtrack, composed by the very talented Kensuke Ushio. A weird mix of dark orchestral music, and the occasional electronic track with disco undertones (harkening back to the original anime adaptation from the ’70s), Devilman’s soundtrack is a beauty to behold, and perhaps its single most praiseworthy and irrefutable merit. It fits the weird, stylised surreal world of the anime very well, with Ushio tackling Devilman’s music with a very unorthodox approach. And it absolutely works. (Link to an electronic remix of the ’70s Devilman anime opening that I-just-can’t-stop-listening-to, here)\n\nA more questionable aspect of Devilman has to be its bizarre, fluid animation. A far cry from the clean, crisp visuals of modern anime, director Masaaki Yuasa renders Devilman’s animation in his own trademarked approach. Limbs extend to inhuman proportions; characters devolve into weird blobs mid-action; and the level of detail from scene to scene differs drastically. Whether by artistic choice or due to a lack of budget, I found the style appropriate for the subject material. Some people were put off by the supposedly “bad” and “cheap” animation, but as an artistic choice it fits with the story being told, while simultaneously paying homage to the less advanced animation technologies of the past, and particularly the ’70s Devilman anime. The animation can range from wild and demented, to downright beautiful, and it accurately captures the messiness of the story being told. While the visuals do dip into the trashy at times, its unique and often-times captivating artstyle works effectively overall.\n\nThe voice acting is quite competent, and the VAs handle the moments of heart (and heart-break) with sincerity and tenderness, lending weight to those moments when the series takes a breather from all the monster violence and sex. Miki’s voice actress, Megumi Han, renders one scene with bone-chilling emotion. The rappers mentioned earlier factor significantly into the story, and their songs are filled with multi-layered meaning, which were supposedly performed by professional Japanese rappers.\n\nDevilman: Crybaby is carried by its well-written, empathetic characters that keep it afloat despite its flawed narrative and often sadistic, overly indulgent tragedy and violence. Through all the muck and bodily fluids, the story drives its point home, even if it doesn’t get there in the most graceful of ways. The ludicrousness of the action and story gives way to an inspection of the darkest corners of the human heart. It is disgusting, beautiful, hopeful, and extremely nihilistic (which is a point of debate with some fans).\n\nNetflix’s gamble with the passion project that is Devilman is paying dividends, and it is safe to say that we can expect them to fund more anime projects by Japanese studios. Given the state of the anime industry in Japan, with the low studio budgets and terrible working conditions, this is definitely a positive push for the industry."
