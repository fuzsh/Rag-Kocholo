        "text": "Five days into 2018, Netflix released 10-part original series Devilman Crybaby, a modern update of Go Nagai’s 1972–73 manga and 1987 Japanese animation series Devilman, which explores themes of nihilism, the failings of a sociotechnical system and the fragility of social structures through the complex relationship of teenaged protagonists Akira Fudo and Ryo Asuka.\n\nNagai was born in Japan in 1945 to a world reeling from the horrific aftermath of the Second World War swiftly followed by the 19-year-long Vietnam War. His feelings and thoughts on the protests, media attention, incalculable loss of life and overseas dispatches were undoubtedly internalized and accessed through his work on Devilman. In a 2002 interview he revealed, “The theme of Devilman is antiwar. When humans transform into devils and demons, what they really are doing is taking up murder weapons and embarking on war. The ‘indiscriminate melding of demons with humans’ that we see in Devilman refers to the draft system, while the death of Akira Fudo’s beloved Miki symbolizes the death of peace. I am the author of Devilman yet throughout its creation, I felt as though I were being pushed by an invisible power. There is no justice in war, any war, nor is there any justification for human beings killing one another. Devilman carries a message of warning, as we step toward a bright future.” While the anti-war sentiment intended by Nagai in the manga isn’t as easily discernible to audiences watching in the 2010s as it may have been to readers of the manga in the 70s, his ideas on the weaponization of human beings and a sense of injustice permeating our current consciousness is still applicable. Netflix remained faithful to much of its source material in the fast-paced and splashy Devilman Crybaby directed by Masaaki Yuasa while providing a technological and cultural updates that become integral plot devices. What was accomplished in this retelling is best described by the following excerpt from Friedrich Nietzsche’s The Will to Power, “Let us imagine this thought in its worst form: existence, as it is, without either a purpose or a goal, but inevitably recurring, without an end in nonentity: ‘Eternal Recurrence.’ This is the extremest form of Nihilism: nothing (purposelessness) eternal!” Inescapable nihilism lies at the heart of this anime, illustrated with stunning, garish visuals and a grindhouse quality of gore and pornographic images viewers have come to expect from Masaaki Yuasa. Saturated colors and almost psychedelic visuals provide tonal breaks across the series, intercepted with brief moments of humane stillness, coloring the apocalypse with lurid aesthetic that serves to underscore the rapidly changing emotions in the digital age.\n\nIn both the original Devilman and adaptation Devilman Crybaby Akira is a timid high school student whose defining characteristic is his deeply empathetic nature that allows him to openly weep whenever he senses a person he cares for is in pain. Ryo is his childhood friend who returns to Japan after a trip to South America where he discovers his mentor has proved the existence of demons on Earth. Ryo is a professor at an American university, despite his age, and seems enjoy financial freedom and agency that allows him to travel. He arrives on the scene guns blazing and racing in on a fancy sports car where he spirits Akira away in a desire to arm him with the protection for a future battle that can only be accomplished by fusing him with a demon. Devilman Crybaby is an amalgamation of Akira and a demon named Amon who is born in at a secret underground rave called Sabbath in a nightmarish scene orchestrated by Ryo-who is later on revealed to be Satan- who holds a video camera in hand capturing every moment like a proud father in the delivery room. As the series progresses, the video takes on multiple meanings of blackmail, betrayal, motive for murder and eventually catharsis which I intend to unpack further over the course of this paper.\n\nWhile Akira/Amon takes on its new monstrous form as a reinforced being that wreaks havoc on partygoers and demons alike, Ryo wields actual power through his camera. Here we appreciate a recontextualization of Satan through the technologically savvy teenaged Ryo who is based on the history surrounding a Judeo-Christian Satan of theology and heavily influenced by iterations produced by John Milton in Paradise Lost and Dante in Inferno. Ryo admits that demons have hidden themselves on Earth, biding their time and growing their power before they strike out against God. “It should be noted that a part of Ryō’s statement above, “Satan, who was encased in the ice by God’s desire,” comes from the Divine Comedy by Dante Alighieri (1264–1321). In Divine Comedy, Satan is bound in the ice to his mid-point in the place just past the last circle of Cocytus, the ninth and final circle of Hell called Judecca. The Revelation of St. John the Divine simply states that Satan is chained and thrown into an abyss to be sealed for a thousand years. Nagai freely adapts famous descriptions from the work of Christian literature and mixes them to meet his needs, making the work more appealing to a wide audience.” (Reider 148). Just as Nagai made use of other works and fused them together in a way that would appeal to a wider audience, so has Ryo made use of the tools available to him within the 21st-centruy to aid his doomed plan to overthrow God. The power he has gained is technological and he cloaks himself throughout the series with cars, guns, cameras, and computers. The end of the world is ultimately caused by soaring conflagration of hysteria and distrust, stoked by Ryo on social and news media, where false narratives and fear mongering are promulgated in real-time helping to accelerate the ultimate destruction of civilization.\n\nThere are three significant instances within the anime where we can see how Ryo’s manipulation of humankind’s reliance on sociotechnical structures are weaponized to cause mass destruction and terror. The first is in the form of a camcorder that Ryo carries around from the first episode. He uses it to record a video of Akira’s transformation into a Devilman during the Sabbath party and the video depicting his transformation and subsequent carnage becomes a point of contention as the series progresses. At the time it was taken, Ryo is reminiscent of many modern day teenagers who make use of countless of video streaming and sharing applications. We live in a society that has unmitigated access to technology that records intimate, embarrassing or horrific moments that are then distributed among loved ones or even strangers. The commercialization of one’s privacy is highlighted in this moments, bringing to the forefront the dangers of cyber threats cut deeper than physical wounds. Koji Nagasak, the persistent and somewhat sleazy photographer who insisted on taking photos of Miki Makimura, stumbles upon Akira’s transformation into Devilman and manages to access this moment by hacking into a surveillance camera that captured the incident. This recording ultimately leads to his demise as Ryo relentlessly tracks him using the GPS signal off of his smartphone, destroying him and any remaining traces of the footage. Ryo provides Akira with a smartphone early on where he keeps track of his movements and even manages to use in order to eavesdrop on his conversation. Akira doesn’t express surprise in these instances but seems to passively accept his interference which seems to be the dynamic of their relationship. Finally he leverages his academic title to gain the trust of his viewership and secure access to the news media where he advocates for the decimation of human beings that appear “weak” or “susceptible” to possession by demons. In this broadcast he has gained access to a global platform that will disseminate his message worldwide. The video is endorsed by the Japanese government reminiscent of a Milgram experiment where citizens are given leave to commit atrocities they normally wouldn’t based on the insistence of authoritative figures. Through this edict he introduces a Nietzschean ressentiment as a driving factor for killing humans and demons. It’s a call to arms, a war cry that holds a reactionary sentiment to the deteriorating condition of society that Ryo advanced and relishes. The oppressed become oppressors; everyone has the power to pass judgement and execute punishment. “…the man of ressentiment is neither upright nor naive nor honest and straightforward with himself. His soul squints; his spirit loves hiding places, secret paths and back doors, everything covert entices him as his world, his security, his refreshment; he understands how to keep silent, how not to forget, how to wait, how to be provisionaly self-deprecating and humble, A race of such men of ressentiment is bound to become eventually cleverer than any noble race; it will also honor cleverness to a far greater degree: namely, as a condition of existence of the first importance; while with noble men cleverness can easily acquire a subtle flavor of luxury and subtlety — for here it is far less essential than the perfect functioning of the regulating unconscious instincts or even than a certain imprudence, perhaps a bold recklessness whether in the face of danger or of the enemy, or that enthusiastic impulsiveness in anger, love, reverence, gratitude, and revenge by which noble souls have at all times recognized one another. Ressentiment itself, if it should appear in the noble man, consummates and exhausts itself in an immediate reaction, and therefore does not poison: on the other hand, it fails to appear at all on countless occasions on which it inevitably appears in the weak and impotent.” (Nietzsche 38–39) Ressentiment spreads among humanity and breaks apart codes of decency and consideration towards life faster than a demon outbreak could. Ryo’s words bear fruit and he has infiltrated the masses in a way only a teenager of the digital age could. Over the course of his plan he’s utilized multiple different media platforms effectively tapping into the digital social consciousness where our inner and outer lives converge. Humanity’s fatal flaw is exacerbated by the relative ease in which people have been conditioned to passively accept information fed through media and social outlets while simultaneously giving up their privacy.\n\nThis exchange between millions has become the modern day zocalo that we can access anywhere. Miki utilizes her online presence in a way that works as the antithesis to Ryo, so much so that it has does not redirect the hate geared towards Akira and the revelation that he is a Devilman but creates a target on her back. She posts on online treatise in the format of a blog post appealing to the kindness and goodness in people. Her hopes for an end to violence and by pledging her allegiance to Akira by claiming she is a Devilman also backfire spectacular as disparaging and hateful comments pour in. She is powerless to persuade the fearful and fully mobilized mob mentality that now wants her dead along with her allies. Later on in the same episode, we see witness her demise while her good friend Miko asks the crowd intent on murdering them to define what it means to be human. Humanity is no longer conversant with spoken works or body language but instead online posts and alarmist news broadcasts have become the language du jour. Mankind appears to have been forsaken by God who does not interfere in the destruction of mankind and only makes His presence known after Earth is destroyed in the final episode. The stirrings of divine intervention begin around episode eight when Ryo, who somehow has access to a satellite dish he uses to monitor the Earth from space, recognizes angels have been sent to suppress the demon insurrection.\n\nAfter the credits of episode nine, there is a two minute piece where we see of Miki, improbable alive and safe, clinging to Akira as they ride his motorcycle along the river where she would train for the track team, the same river where we just watched her and Miko killed by a mindless mob. By throwing in this little piece of nostalgic fodder, almost as an afterthought to satiate the viewer’s desire for a happy ending that will never happen, this offers a brief self-aware moment acknowledging the overwhelming brutality the viewer was subjected that requires this simple moment — a visual reset before moving onto the final episode.\n\nOnce Ryo comes to terms with his identity he transforms into an androgynous winged being that retains pleasant physical features. His return to the form of Satan does not mar is beauty in the same way the other human-demon amalgamations are represented throughout the anime. Ryo reveals himself in all his splendor to Akira in a way that suggests exiting the metaphorical closet. Ryo “comes out” and expresses a desire to remake the world with Akira by his side. By assuming this form Ryo has shed his human life and all the technological enhancements that he utilized to his advantage from the first episode until now. In forgoing technology in the form of flashy guns, cars and his video camera he has finally freed himself of a word where he would not be accepted, a world where his true being was mitigated by the use of the same technology that he ultimately used and discarded. Ryo reveals the first wave of demons were present during the Earth’s Mesozoic Era and shares that demons were able to weaponized their bodies by merging with various dinosaurs whereas human beings require technological crutches to do the same. The final fight sequence is a raw demonstration of the violence wielded by Ryo and Akira’s bodies as they become embroiled in primal hand-to-hand combat in a climactic demonstration of carnal fulfilment. “Fighting a lonely fight, Devilman is a marginalized being. He is of a different species. He is the “other.” I should note that the protagonist’s name, Fudō Akira, is written in kanji characters 不動明. If one adds the character 王 (ō, king), it becomes Fudō myōō 不動明王 (Ācala Vidyārāja, Immovable Protector of Dharma),8 the most venerable and best known of the Five Wisdom Kings (godai myōō), who represent the luminescent wisdom of the Buddha. Fudō myōō 不動明王 is a manifestation of Mahavairocana — the fundamental, universal Buddha of esoteric Buddhism, and has a fearsome countenance as he destroys the delusions and material desires of humans in exchange for the salvation of mankind.” (Reider 149)\n\nUltimately Satan is successful in beating down mankind. The final scene depicts a contemplative Ryo who is left to reminisce on memories from their childhood over the bisected corpse that was once Akira before coming to the realization that he has killed the only person that loved him on Earth. Ryo is forced to shed his own tears now that Akira can no longer do that for him and the Earth is destroyed and remade again. There is no human left to witness the sacrifices of Akira or Ryo’s emotional display except the viewer who can perhaps revel in the modicum of hope offered by a new world willed into existence with the same thoughtfulness as resetting a videogame. What is achieved is ta successful elucidation on frailty of human society when faced with a threat of an apocalyptic magnitude, not far off from the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020, and the characters that try to cling to morals and societal structures that have swiftly crumbled-who value love, fairness and friendship- are the first to be killed. Devilman Crybaby has found a way to further the conversations begun by Milton, Nietzsche and Dante on human nature with an added relevancy through its sociotechnical update. There is an immediacy conveyed in this form of Japanese anime that compounds the destructive emotions of pain, fear and anger throughout the series and its technological spread that is devastatingly potent. Just as the premise of Devilman Crybaby was earlier summed up nicely by Nietzsche the same holds true for its ending, “Let us conclude. The two opposing values “good and bad,” “good and evil” have been engaged in a fearful struggle on earth for thousands of years; and though the latter value has certainly been on top for a long time, there are still places where the struggle is as yet undecided.” (Nietzsche 52).\n\nWorks Cited\n\nDelacroix, Eugène. “Faust.” Johann Wolfgang von Goethe’s Faust translated by Philipp Albert Stapfer and illustrated with the designs of Eugène Delacroix (France: Charles Motte, 1828) https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/336614\n\nIsenberg, Chris, and Go Nagai. “Devilman Revelations by Go Nagai.” Devilworld, The Online Source for Devilman Since 1999, 2002. web.archive.org/web/20060620081843/devilworld.org/revelations.html.\n\nNietzsche, Friedrich, and Walter Arnold Kaufmann.
