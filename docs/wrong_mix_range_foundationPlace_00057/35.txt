On January 25, Spiceworks competed in the 3rd annual Austin Startup Games. We came prepared; we planned, trained and strategized vigilantly. It was like the Rocky training montage with more beer, and our eyes were on the prize. Unfortunately, that prize went home with another team-- but we had a lot of fun, and isn’t that what really matters?

More than 1,000 people attended, and 16 teams from Austin startups competed in 11 events including pong (ping and beer), darts, shuffleboard and trivia. The final 5 teams competed in a “mystery” event, a giant maze, before the games closed. Spiceworks sent 23 athletes and 16 alternates, cheered on by a crowd of orange.

We looked good.

In total, the games donated more than $56,000 to charity and more than 850 pounds of canned goods to Capital Area Food Bank . Back-to-back champions Sparefoot donated to Kure It , UShip, the second place winners, donated to Community in Schools of Central Texas , and bronze medalists Capital Factory donated to Breakthrough Austin .

Spiceworks is proud to be able to donate $1,000 to Championship Heart Foundation , a charity that provides free heart screenings to Texas teens and researches Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy.

Just like Sochi, but way more intense.

Thank you to all of the Spiceworks participants and cheerleaders, and congratulations to every team in attendance! We may not have taken home the gold, but we still kept it spicy.
