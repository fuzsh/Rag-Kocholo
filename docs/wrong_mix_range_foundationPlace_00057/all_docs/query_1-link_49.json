I know I personally always feel like giving as much as I feel like receiving when it gets to this time of year but I also know I can get too busy to think about others much as I scurry around to get things in order, buy gifts for family, make lists and whatnot before the holidays come.\n\nMaybe it’s the same for you, and to that end, we’d like to do something special this holiday season. We’re going to give back as SpiceHeads! And you can earn a special BADGE for your profile by doing so!\n\nI’m going to start a list of IT and Tech-related charities that are cool to donate to. You all can help me by adding to the list. We can also all help by making donations to the charities. We can help each other by talking about good things during this holiday time and cheering each other up!\n\nHow to earn the badge:\n\nA. Make a donation of any amount to the charity of your choice and post a screenshot of your donation (make sure you cover up any identifiable info) and post it to this thread\n\nor\n\nB. Recommend an IT or tech-related charity that I don’t have here. I’m starting with a couple but I know there are more. I’ll add it to this OP and we’ll get a nice list going!\n\nor\n\nC. If 2020 has been hard and you’d like to donate but you can’t, just tell us about your favorite charity, tech-related or otherwise, and what it means to you.\n\nIt’s been a challenging year for just about everybody, but there are always bright spots. Maybe we can make one right here! We’ll keep the thread open through December 31st and award badges after the New Year.\n\nIT and Tech Related Charity List:\n\nOne Laptop Per Child - One Laptop Per Child is a non-profit organization created to give every child in the world a quality, innovative education. The OLPC program provides each child with a rugged, connected, low-cost computer and a comprehensive ecosystem of educational support.\n\nBlack Girls Code - Our Vision: To increase the number of women of color in the digital space by empowering girls of color ages 7 to 17 to become innovators in STEM fields, leaders in their communities, and builders of their own futures through exposure to computer science and technology.\n\nGirls Who Code - Girls Who Code is on a mission to close the gender gap in technology and to change the image of what a programmer looks like and does.\n\nNational Cristina Foundation - In 1984, National Cristina Foundation pioneered the concept of technology reuse. We identified that there were wide swaths of underserved individuals that could benefit from the use of technology. Veterans, people with disabilities, economically disadvantaged individuals, students, and many other people hungry for opportunity could reach their full potential if given the tools and skills to do so. Since then, hundreds of thousands of computers have been donated and placed through the Foundation’s work as we help to close the digital divide.\n\nFree Geek - Free Geek is a 501(c)(3) organization with a mission to sustainably reuse technology, enable digital access, and provide education to create a community that empowers people to realize their potential. Free Geek’s goal is to divert technology that would otherwise be recycled or thrown away, refurbish it, and give it back to our community at no or low cost.\n\nTechGirlz - TechGirlz’ mission is to inspire middle school girls to explore the possibilities of technology to empower their future careers. Our vision is to create a world where girls have a lifelong passion and confidence in their use of technology throughout their careers.\n\nExtra Life - Extra Life unites thousands of gamers around the world to play games in support of their local Children’s Miracle Network Hospital. Since its inception in 2008, Extra Life has raised over $70 million USD for sick and injured kids.\n\nAnnieCannons - Transforming survivors of human trafficking and gender-based violence into software engineers and entrepreneurs, we envision a world where AnnieCannons’ network of individuals and technologies ensures that no innovation is denied on the basis of gender, race, or previous condition of servitude.\n\nElectronic Frontier Foundation - EFF uses the unique expertise of leading technologists, activists, and attorneys in our efforts to defend free speech online, fight illegal surveillance, advocate for users and innovators, and support freedom-enhancing technologies.\n\nTechSoup - TechSoup’s mission is to build a dynamic bridge that enables design and implementation of technology solutions for a more equitable planet.\n\nInformation Technology Disaster Resource Center - founded in 2008 to provide communities with the technical resources necessary to continue operations and begin recovery after a disaster. We harness the collective resources of the technology community to provide no cost Information, Communications, and Technology (ICT) solutions that connect survivors and responders in crisis.\n\n…"
