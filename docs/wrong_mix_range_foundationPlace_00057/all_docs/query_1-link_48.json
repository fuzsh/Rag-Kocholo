        "text": "If you create a site for each of them and give them full, top level permissions to their own site, they will be able to create subsites. My question would be, do you need a full subsite for each project? I don’t know the answer, but you’ll create a lot of unnecessary work and data if they could make do with different document libraries within their specific site.\n\nHow many sales people, and what’s their technical level? How much training (read: hand-holding) will you have to provide? What kind of projects, is there some common functionality they will all need? If so then maybe a top level site geared to that function with sub-sites or libraries for each.\n\nEchoing Sosipater, you could be setting yourself up for a ton of “maintenance” by setting up too many sites that won’t be managed well.\n\nBTW, we were using WSS3 and have moved to the current platform. On WSS3, we weren’t doing what we want to do now.\n\nThere are 40-50 salespeople. The ones that will use it regularly are fairly technical and will pick up on this quickly. We are commercial real estate, so the projects tend to be around three things- a property, a client or a proposal where we are trying to win the right to represent a client or a property. They need to keep each project separate. They utilize the calendar and document libraries extensively.\n\nI’m working with one of the most technical salespeople to get this up and running now. We created a new Team Site and I made him owner. He cannot create a sub site. He gets an access denied message. Maybe I need to be doing this creation through IIS manager?\n\nAs for creating sites that aren’t managed, I created many a site for salespeople, who then never used them. Probably 50% of the sites I created never were utilized. I figure if they have to create the sites, they will only do it when absolutely necessary…\n\nSo it was working, just that sub sites could not create additional sites.\n\nOh…think I may have misunderstood the scenario. Never tried to create a sub-site of a sub-site. My main site has only a single sub-site but it looks like the Owner should be able to create another one underneath if required…Has to be a permissions issue.\n\nIf you can find more detail on the “access denied” errors it may give you a clue.\n\nYou’re thinking you want multiple “top-level” sites? That’s beyond my experience I’m afraid.\n\nI want the salespeople to be able to create their own sub-sites. Right now they are using Onehub, Dropbox, Box, etc. for document sharing and we need to create a formal policy to control that. Too much content is now out in locations that we have no control over and, honestly, they probably don’t have much control over either. I’ve already had one salesperson accidentally wipe their content on one device which wiped it from the internal location they were syncing with.\n\nYou can definitely create multiple levels of team sites. (I just verified it.) And remember, permissions are one of the biggest PITA for Sharepoint.\n\nYou said you made him owner of his site. Try adding him to the Owner group on the top-level site and see if he can create sub-sites.\n\nAnd yes, creating a full team site for each salesperson may be overkill, but it’s not that big a deal. But I would certainly advise them to create libraries or lists beneath their team site, not continue creating team sites, that would definitely become onerous for them to use.\n\nYou bring up Dropbox and document sharing but your earlier description said the salespeople were basically working on individual projects for their own sales cycle. What documents are being shared? That’s a different animal than a team site for each user.\n\nThey put documents pertinent to the sales cycle in commercial real estate- contracts, marketing proposals, correspondence, maps, architectural drawings (CAD files), tax documents, etc. If they are dealing with a retail client, they could have document folders for each site they are working on. For instance, WAWA, a fast food store here in the Delaware Valley was divesting itself of some old locations. The broker had a folder for each site and correspondence and many other docs were stored in each folder. This is the feature they use most frequently but they do use the calendar extensively too. I’ll give the new site at the IIS level a try."
