        "text": "Bob Johnson turned 87 in January. He lives in Hyannis with his wife, Brenda, and retired from active portfolio research in a small cap mutual fund five years ago (finally). He retired from being the chairman of the HOA three years ago. Now he cuts grass and shovels snow. He is healthy, but his knees talk back to him; sometimes they yell. BC has made incredible progress over the years and is a crown jewel; hats off to everyone involved. • Jean Crowley is enjoying her family and afternoon naps in her retirement. She became a great-grandmother in August 2022, when her oldest grandchild had a baby girl, Odette. She splits her time between her daughter's home in Arlington, Virginia, and the Outer Banks, North Carolina. Jean is grateful she has stayed in touch with her classmate, Joan Keenan Barry, who remains her forever friend. • Larry Ruttman, JD’58, recently celebrated his 92nd birthday. He lives in Brookline with his wife of 59 years, Lois. He still practices some law but works full time at his second calling of writing. He has published two books and a short memoir entitled My Eighty-Two Year Love Affair with Fenway Park and has two more on the way out, one on classical music, Intimate Conversations: Face to Face with Matchless Musicians, and his memoir, Larry Ruttman, A Life Lived Backwards. His 2013 book, American Jews and America’s Game, was named the best baseball book in America for that year by Sports Collectors Digest. The book is also a cultural history of American Jews going back to the Depression. Larry was elected a fellow of the Massachusetts Historical Society. His papers have been collected by the New England Genealogical and Historical Society and the Jewish Heritage Center and then were collated, indexed, detailed in proper order, and then published online. Larry’s podcast, Larry Ruttman, A Life Lived Backwards, One Man’s Life, is now in its third year. He will teach a course this summer at the Truro Center for the Arts entitled “Writing Your Own Memoir, A Path to a Brighter Future.” He intends to stay active indefinitely.\n\nSheila Hurley Canty keeps busy with needlepoint, canasta, line dancing, book club, and once a month “sip and sew” with her sisters. She and John plan to go to Florida this year. • Jo Kirk Cleary is sorry not to be able to attend the Reunion. A grandson is graduating from college and the occasion is a family reunion.

In January, they traveled to Disney World to see their daughter Kerry sing in the Disney Broadway series at Epcot. She did three shows a night for a week. This was her third time performing at Epcot. They returned to Disney World in February to the Wide World of Sports, where their granddaughter, Emily Smith, was a cheerleader for Scarsdale High School in a competition. For the first time, the school won in their division. In April, James was lucky to celebrate his 91st birthday. Yikes! Before COVID, their daughter Kerry was performing in the Broadway musical Beetlejuice, which had to close but reopened in 2022, and she rejoined the cast in her role as Barbara. They are currently in Venice, Florida, living the American dream, enjoying life, and playing tennis three days a week. Stay healthy everyone, keep punchin’. • Bob Paquette retired from dental practice in 2007. He lives in Florida between November and May and on Prince Edward Island, Canada, May to November. He is awaiting his seventh great-grandchild. • Jane Steinthal is sending love to all ’59ers! A year and a half ago, Jack experienced a stroke! Physically he is good, but their lives have changed. Grandchild #10, Hannah, graduated with honors from NYU in 2022 and is applying to med school. Daisy will graduate from Georgetown SFS and Henry from Lafayette. Only four more to go! All 30 Steinthals were in Texas for Courtney Kent’s wedding to Brian Stephenson; only 14 more to go! She feels very blessed to have a large, ever-growing family that is healthy as they carve their careers and future. Friends are dear to her heart.\n\nThe A&S Class of 1962 included the first Geology majors. They numbered less than a dozen. Joe McKniffe is wondering if anyone is still out there? • Stephen McKenna has finally \"thrown in the towel\" after more than 45 years of practicing law in New York and the Washington, D.C. area, so he can spend more time at his beachfront home on the Outer Banks of North Carolina in a little town named Duck. That's right, Duck. Most fortunately, his son, Matthew ’92, a surgeon, and his beautiful bride, Patty ’92, live right nearby so they get to spend some precious family time with them and their three children. • Life continues onward for Kathleen Beaton. • Ronald Dyer, the founder of the Falmouth Veterans Collaborative, spoke recently about the volunteer work he continues to do as commander of the DAV and quartermaster of the VFW. • Bill Novelline is survived by his wife Eileen and sons Tom, Brian, and Andrew. He died soon after his daughter Tricia died. Bill graduated with a degree in economics and was the manager of the BC baseball team, traveling two years with the team for the College World Series. He founded Abbot Financial Management, which he managed with his son Andrew. Bill’s friends loved to spend time with him. He was loyal, generous, kind, always with a story to tell. He loved his BC. Condolences to Eileen and family. • John \"Jack\" MacKinnon called to chat. When asked if he had any grandchildren at BC, he responded, one senior, two sophomores, and one graduate student.

She is a happy baby, which helps parents Lauren and Steve manage their work schedules. • Ronald Campanelli, known to his friends as Ron, has passed away.

His successful career was spent working in the family business, Campanelli Companies. Ron leaves his wife, Mary Margaret, and family of four daughters, their husbands, and grandchildren. His classmates offer their condolences.\n\nLike many of her classmates, Katherine Byron Kahr, NC’66, MSW’68, has seen many changes in the last three years as she survived the pandemic. She and her husband retired, sold the family house in Providence, and landed at their little cottage in South Chatham on Cape Cod. Last winter, they bought a condo in Bend, Oregon. Bend has mountain magic and beauty and cold. However, the big draw is their son, Tony ’04 and his wife, Annie ’05, and their wonderful children, Madlyn (nine) and Max (seven). From Bend, they can catch a two-hour flight to Los Angeles where their son, Byron, lives with wife, Molly, and Oona (eight) and Otis (six). It is wonderful to have everyone in the same time zone. In May, they headed back to Chatham, where the BC Club is thriving. Any BC Benders here? • Judy McCluskey Flood has passed away. She received a master's in psychology from Cambridge College and worked as a guidance counselor in the Lowell Public Schools.

The first book is available in three languages.\n\nKathy Ohm finally \"retired\" from years of organizational effectiveness consulting and coaching work, primarily with school systems and entrepreneurs (now there's a mix). Now she’s looking forward to finding volunteer work to love closer to home. Ideas welcome! Though they are slowing down, Kathy and her husband headed for Ireland in March. Otherwise, it is their grands who are on the go: Their oldest granddaughter is teaching in Asia on a Fulbright. She came home for Christmas, got stuck in the airline slowdown, and was two days late! Their grandson, described by his proud grandmother as “brilliant, fun, and kind,” leads the university mock trial team, and his sister will attend the same university next fall. The older she gets, the more deeply she appreciates the years she shared with her peers at Newton—enrichment of self and family and the grounding it provided to serve others well, both professionally and in volunteer work. • After renting a home in the Berkshires last June for four days, Christina Crowley, Kathleen Hegenbart, Maureen Dailey Young, and Paula Lyons decided that mini-reunions were a terrific way to stay connected. In early May this year, Christina and Paula traveled to Pittsburgh for another get-together. Maureen promised to introduce them to all the best museums, gardens, and restaurants in her city while they catch up on their lives. • Christina Crowley has been going on her own travels. Late 2022 she was in Morocco and Andalusia delving into Islamic history in North Africa and Spain.

This is a memoir of his four years serving as U.S. Ambassador to the Holy See during the exciting early years of the Francis papacy. Previously, Ken served as CEO and president of Catholic Relief Services. Last year, BC asked Ken to speak at the Church in the 21st Century Center. After forty years working within some of the world's worst tragedies, Ken and Joan are enjoying serene retirement on Amelia Island, Florida. • Bill Fitzgerald, Steve McCarthy, John Manganelli, Greg Sullivan, and their wives gathered for their traditional annual reunion in Nashville over St Patrick's Day weekend.

Although Bill continues much of his spiritual direction work remotely, he now spends more time \"on the Rivah\" both figuratively and literally—no boats, just kayaks. • Valerie Sowinski Wood went to London and Paris last September. Both were wonderful, but Paris is très magnifique! After 16 years, she retired from MGH in December. She is bored staying home, so she’s looking for a part-time job. She had back surgery in March and is hoping to be more mobile. She is also planning a family vacation this summer, possibly a cruise.\n\nShane Murphy and his wife recently celebrated their 50th wedding anniversary. They retired seven years ago and are living in the Ft. Mill, South Carolina, area.

Both are doing well and are very grateful. • Chuck Klemballa is retired and loving life—living in NYC and traveling with his wife JoAnn.

Last year, Lisa Heimann, daughter of Steven’s roommate of Fred Heimann, for two years at BC, retired after many years on the board of directors. • Ed Murray and wife Mary finally downsized from their house in Everett.

He is a re-educated architect and still working though fighting off the yokes of aging. Work is mostly pharmaceutical labs these days. He went to the 50th Reunion this past summer.

It was worth the 49-year wait to enjoy such an excellent and special moment in time together. They have all retired except for Robbie and Deirdre, who work part time.
