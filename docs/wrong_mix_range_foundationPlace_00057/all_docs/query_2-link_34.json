        "text": "It used to be up to IT leaders to set the technology agenda. CIOs had to make a compelling case for moving data from on-premises systems to the cloud, for example, or help senior leaders understand the value of 5G internet services. The latest artificial intelligence (AI) wave has changed that process entirely.\n\nIn many large enterprises, everyone from frontline employees to the CEO is asking for generative AI to be deployed as quickly and widely as possible. They want to take advantage of use cases that could give them an edge over competitors, meet customer expectations and accelerate everyday tasks.\n\nThere’s just one problem: CIOs need to balance the enterprise demand for AI with an approach that can keep critical data protected and align with long-established governance standards. Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold6 and Galaxy Z Flip6, which combine Galaxy AI1 with its enterprise-grade Samsung Knox security technology, give them that balance, and much more.\n\nThe AI security questions that IT needs to answer\n\nIt’s never been easy to keep up with the security risks of an ever-evolving area like AI.\n\nFor instance, IT leaders may be worried about what AI adoption means for the way enterprise data is collected, managed and shared. Connecting business systems to public large language models (LLMs) may not be appropriate. Some generative AI tools produce “hallucinations” that lead to costly mistakes.\n\nWhile many of those issues can be addressed as the technology matures and proper policies are established, the bigger worry might be how AI is exploited by rogue actors.\n\nCybercriminals, for instance, have been quick to experiment with machine learning, deep learning and now, generative AI. They could use these technologies to create even more sophisticated malware, ransomware and social engineering attacks.\n\nThe potential for data leakage, access control challenges, and privacy concerns further complicate AI adoption in the enterprise.\n\nAI should not create more work for already-overstretched enterprise IT departments and security teams. And it shouldn’t always require integrating AI platforms with legacy systems.\n\nHow Samsung Knox paves the way for AI enterprises can trust\n\nSamsung recognized the challenge of adopting new innovations years ago and responded with Samsung Knox, a security platform based on hardware-level protections. This includes a security co-processor protecting employee credentials, biometric data, digital certificates and even blockchain private keys.\n\nWhen Samsung devices with built-in Galaxy AI boot up, Knox checks the operating system’s integrity, monitoring for potential threats. IT departments can build upon this layer of protection via Knox Platform for Enterprise (KPE). By integrating with enterprise mobility management (EMM) solutions, for example, KPE allows IT to set granular controls that go beyond core Android enterprise capabilities.\n\nThis means that as AI-based devices become more widely provisioned, IT can run remote device health checks to determine whether they were ever compromised, set advanced enterprise network options, or even remap device keys to launch specific tasks.\n\nWith Knox as a foundation, enterprise IT teams can approach AI with greater peace of mind — especially because Samsung’s latest devices already include Galaxy AI.\n\nWhat a security-first approach to AI looks like across the Galaxy ecosystem\n\nEven with strong security in place, large organizations can struggle to assess all the myriad AI platforms available and how best to integrate them into their business. Galaxy Z Fold6 and Galaxy Z Flip6 ease that process with Galaxy AI-driven features that support:\n\n1. Improved cross-functional collaboration\n\nEnterprises are often filled with departments that don’t work together as well as they should. When sales and marketing teams don’t communicate effectively, for example, it can lead to duplication of effort, wasted leads and missed targets.\n\nGalaxy Z Fold6 fosters greater alignment using features like Chat Assist with Galaxy AI. When it’s time to send or respond to chat messages, for instance, Chat Assist can tailor what team members say to each other based on the context. They could adopt a more casual tone to show empathy, for instance, or a professional tone to address a more serious issue.\n\nCross-functional teams can also better track what’s discussed during messages using Note Assist with Galaxy AI. It can quickly summarize, organize, and highlight all the key takeaways and action items to keep everyone on the same page.\n\n2. Greater customer-centricity\n\nA consumer-oriented enterprise might be focused on boosting customer satisfaction (CSAT) scores. For a business-to-business (B2B) enterprise, net promoter score (NPS) might be more important.\n\nRegardless of the metric you use, the only way to improve is by enhancing experiences on a customer-by-customer basis. When an enterprise account manager needs to engage with a client who speaks another language, for instance, combining Galaxy Z Flip6’s Live Translate with Galaxy Buds3 Pro and FlexWindow allows for seamless communication.\n\nIn a financial services firm, a wealth manager can unfold Galaxy Z Fold6’s screen to show all the details about the latest investment opportunities thanks to its multi-window view. When questions come up, they can just use their finger to draw around words or objects on the screen, and Circle to Search with Google can do the rest.\n\nOf course, sometimes it’s necessary to connect with clients or coworkers remotely, which Galaxy Z Flip6 makes possible using Google Meet Live Sharing.\n\n3. Greater productivity on higher-value tasks\n\nEnterprise employees have sometimes been called knowledge workers, but too often, they’re forced to pore over granular details. Those working in functions like HR, finance, and legal need to ensure they capture every nuance of conversations about employee policies, audits, and regulatory filings.\n\nThanks to Transcript Assist with Galaxy AI, Galaxy Z Fold6 greatly reduces this kind of administrative overhead. It instantly produces precise and succinct recaps of a meeting without employees having to write a single thing.\n\nWhen those in marketing or HR are focused on creating imagery to promote products or corporate culture, they can lean on Galaxy Z Flip6’s FlexCam with Galaxy AI and Photo Assist with Galaxy AI. These tools make sure every person or object is arranged perfectly in the shot and streamline the process of editing and enhancing pictures.\n\nBeyond AI features, Galaxy Z Fold6 and Z Flip6 build upon the employee experience most enterprises try to provide by offering Microsoft integrations with popular software tools like Office 365.\n\nOn a more personal level, employees can benefit from using these devices with Samsung Wallet, which allows the team to store payment cards, IDs and more.\n\nBest of all, Galaxy Z Fold6 and Z Flip6 offer a connected experience with other Samsung Galaxy devices, whether employees need to take calls on their Galaxy Book4 Series or want to keep listening on their Galaxy Buds while switching back to their phone.\n\nAI and mobile devices that deliver what the business wants and what IT needs\n\nAI is only valuable as long as the devices running it keep working. IT departments shouldn’t constantly deal with troubleshooting and repairs.\n\nGalaxy Z Assurance and Samsung Care+ for Business offer all the coverage an enterprise needs to manage accidental damage with speed and convenience.\n\nThe tech industry may have more work to do before IT leaders can easily adopt AI across the enterprise. If you want to get started today, though, Galaxy Z Fold6 and Galaxy Z Flip6 represent secure, business-friendly solutions.\n\nUnleash new ways to stay productive, collaborate and more with Samsung for business.
