You can add additional queries like this\n\n\"exact phrase\" keyword -negativeword\n\nThis will look for that the exact phrase that also contains keyword, but does not contain the negativeword\n\nYou can also search for multiple exact matches. For example if you were looking for security deposit language in commercial leases you could search for:\n\n\"security deposit\" \"commercial lease\"\n\nUse the Advanced Search Box to drill down to specific documents based on agreement type, governing law, law firms, parties, SIC code and date."
