        "text": "Today at SpiceWorld 2023 we announced an exciting new era for the Spiceworks Community with the launch of the Playground. For 15 years, Spiceworks Community has been the go-to platform for IT professionals to connect, collaborate, and find solutions to the complex challenges they face daily. It was founded with a mission to bridge the gaps between IT pros, recognizing that the expertise of one could be the lifeline for another. Today, as we step into a new era, we are excited to share the Playground which will pave the way to enhancing your experience and foster even stronger connections within our community.\n\nYour Voice Matters\n\nSpiceworks Community has always been for and by you. Your voices have been heard through feature requests, topic posts, messages, and surveys. What we learned was invaluable. You want a modern and responsive community that works seamlessly across all devices, an improved search experience, streamlined ways to showcase your expertise, and efficient problem-solving. These insights and our goal to return to a more user-centered approach to our community is behind our launch of the Playground\n\nTo address these vital requirements, we realized that we needed to rebuild the foundation of Spiceworks Community. The existing architecture, while robust, was no longer aligned with our vision for the future. The result? A Playground to explore that we can’t wait to share with you!\n\nWelcome to the Playground\n\nThe Playground is where the future begins. It’s a glimpse into the new Spiceworks Community, offering a selection of core features we look forward to your feedback on.
