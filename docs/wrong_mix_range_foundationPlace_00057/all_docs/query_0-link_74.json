Having secured them, he pushed on up the river, where he suddenly came upon the perfect figure of a man, the whole of it being solid gold. At first he was awe-struck, and did not venture near it, but in the end he was overcome by a desire to possess the treasure, and walked up to it, exercising the greatest caution. As nothing unusual occurred, he plucked up courage and put out his hand to touch the figure. Then there was a blinding flash of lightning, followed by a fearful clap of thunder, which almost prostrated him. The thunder drove him down to the settlement, following him nearly all the way.\n\nHe never again had the courage to go up the river, but he thought some of his friends might try to obtain the treasure.\n\nSome of the younger natives have, it appears, ventured up the river since then, but not finding the golden figure, they have crossed a saddle into another river, where, it is said, they are now busily engaged washing out iron pyrites in considerable quantities, being under the impression that it is gold.\n\nAt the Resident Magistrates Court yesterday-before Mr G A PREECE R.M.\n\nJohn JOHNSTONE\n\nPatrick WHYTE\n\nThomas JONES\n\nThomas FLAHERTY were each fined 5s and costs for drunkenness.

Mrs McKENZIE was at church on Sunday accompanied by two gentlemen friends. About 9 oclock a womans screams apparently proceeding from the direction of the river, were heard, but no one was seen. The case has created considerable excitement, as the circumstances point to murder or suicide. The deceased on returning from Church one Sunday in March last, found some men in her house, and she has since been in great fear.

In digging out the foundation for one of them he came across a Maori relic of very ancient make, judging by its appearance and the depth at which it was found, and possibly centuries have passed since it was deposited there. It lay buried fully 12 feet down in a compact mass of clay and boulders over an overhanging rock. Mr DIXON, who is an efficient Maori scholar, and well versed in Maori lore, pronounced it to be manufactured of a human thighbone. It is about eight inches long, and has three well-defined barbs filed out along its inner side. These barbs make the relic either a weapon of the war or the hunt or were intended as a record of time. In the latter case it was in Mr DIXONs opinion, before the arrival of the Maoris. The curio may be seen at the officer of the Advocate.\n\nAus News 2\n\n***-Copy of this full transcription is available from Elaine.\n\nThree of the crew of the barque THUNDERBOLT, which arrived at Port Jackson last week, have been arrested on the charge of wilful disobedience on the high seas more .then The Captain stated in his evidence that MAXWELL one of the ringleaders ..more and TAYLOR, another ringleader .more.

On the flames being extinguished it was found that the poor woman was quite dead.\n\nFurther particulars of the frightful outrage and murder of a little girl, reported last week, has been received. The outrage took place about noon on Saturday the 12th inst., in the scrub at the Bunya reserve, about 14 miles from Brisbane, in the Samford district. The little girl named Bright BAKER and was aged 9 years. She was the same child who over a year ago was assaulted by a blackfellow in the same district. On the present occasion, accompanied by her brother, aged 4 years, she was carrying her fathers dinner to him, and when halfway through the scrub an aboriginal jumped across the path and seized the girl. The boy being terrified fled home and told his mother. A search was quickly organised, and traces of blood were found ion the ground and on the bushes near the spot where the child had been seized, leading to the supposition that she had been killed and carried on the shoulder of the murderer. Eventually the dead body of the girl was found horribly mutilated.
