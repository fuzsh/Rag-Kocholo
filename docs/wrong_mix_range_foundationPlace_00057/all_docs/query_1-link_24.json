Feedback like, “You should have the meetings in the suburbs”, “The meeting is too far from me, I work in the suburbs” and so on.\n\nThe thing is, the group literally has the word “Downtown” in it…so, I’m not sure what’s confusing about that as far as what we’re about and where the meetings are. That being said, in case you didn’t know, there is an awesome group that meets in Mt. Prospect.\n\nI’m curious to know if anyone in the group is interested in starting up a South Side Spicecorps? I recently moved to Evergreen Park so, it might actually work better for myself to be involved with that one as well if anyone wanted a co-leader.\n\nAnyway, let me know because I don’t want people to be excluded because of their location and if creating another Spicecorps could help with that, I wouldn’t mind putting in some leg work and talking with SW Headquarters to maybe get some balls rolling. lol, balls.\n\nPM me or respond here!\n\nEDIT: At this point, nothing is set in stone. I got the attention of the Spicecorps admins and they’re inquiring as to how many folks would be interested in attending, at this point I told them about a dozen, based on this thread.\n\nIf we have success with starting a new group down south, I don’t see why it couldn’t lead to a west burbs one too. The main focus of Spicecorps is attendance. They don’t want to put money/time/effort into a group that only has a handful of people. Chicago is unique in that the city itself is a entity of it’s own, but also acts like a main hub for the surrounding areas. The reason we started the Downtown group was to accommodate those of us that work downtown and couldn’t make it out to the burbs, however, now that we’ve gotten some traction, we’re kind of reverse engineering that to accommodate those people that can’t make it into the city.\n\nAnyway, as it’s been mentioned previously, our group started out super tiny and over the past few years has steadily grown. To get another group going at this point, has to have a strong foundation to start with, it’s not like “the old days”, where anyone could start a group all willy nilly. They’ve really fine tuned the process to get the most of out the experience for vendors, Spiceworks and Spiceheads.\n\nThanks for chiming in on this, I’m really hoping to get another group off the ground!\n\nYou mentioned you’re moving to Pingree Grove in October, based on that location I would think that the Mt. Prospect one would be easier to get to?\n\nAt this point, nothing is set in stone.
