Hello

In our company we use TFS to manage our Helpdesk tickets, but we need to copy past from email to the new task and keep this process everytime that we receive a new answer to keep everything in the same place.

In other company i use Spiceworks and like you design and your workflow.

But here they have statistics in TFS that need to keep.

My question is: There is some way to use Spiceworks and have a easy way to send this data to TFS?

Thanks for your Help
