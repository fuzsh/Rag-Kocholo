Zak Pennâ€™s poker comedy mockumentary now has a domestic distributor as Anchor Bay Entertainment has acquired all the North American rights to his film The Grand which he both wrote and directed.

The film takes you inside the world of professional poker that has swept the nation in recent years spawning tournaments year round. The game has actually circled the globe bringing competitors of all ages and from all walks of life to play for big prize money in the tournaments. The Grand culminates in an international poker tournament that Penn filmed live at the Golden Nugget in Las Vegas, not knowing would come out on top.
