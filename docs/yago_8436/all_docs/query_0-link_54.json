        "text": "Following the reveal that Warner Bros. is working on a Booster Gold/Blue Beetle film with Greg Bertlanti, A new report is claiming that screenwriter Zak Penn may be penning the project.\n\nBy Gutspinner -\n\nFiled Under: Booster Gold\n\nSource: Heroic Hollywood\n\nFollowing the reveal that Warner Bros. is working on a Booster Gold/Blue Beetle film, everyone's \"favourite\" reporter El Mayimbe (if you're a frequent user here at Comicbookmovie.com, you may know him better as Eh Maybe) has taken to Heroic Hollywood and claimed to know just who will be writing the upcoming \"Buddy Cop\"-esque Superhero Duo movie. Take this with a grain of salt, as El Mayimbe doesn't exactly have the best track record.\n\nAccording to \"Mayimbe's sources\", Warner Bros. is eyeing screenwriter Zak Penn to write the Greg Berlanti directed film. If true, the film wouldn't mark the first time Penn had written a comic book movie project, but his previous work in the genre may worry some fans - Penn worked on X-Men 3: The Last Stand, The Incredible Hulk, Elektra and was responsible for writing the initial story for The Avengers, which director Joss Whedon told Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige that he needed to \"pretend it never happened\" (and that he would only come onto the project if he could re-write the film from the ground up).\n\nMayimbe says the story is still developing, so definitely don't take this for certain as of yet. Whether or not there is any credibility to this scoop remains to be seen.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Do you hope Mayimbe is dead wrong, or would you like to see Penn get a crack at the film? Are you excited for a film centered on Blue Beetle and Booster Gold? Sound off in the comments below, and be sure to hit that thumbs up and share!\n\nDISCLAIMER: ComicBookMovie.com is protected under the DMCA (Digital Millenium Copyright Act) and...
