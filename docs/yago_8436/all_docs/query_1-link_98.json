Allspark Pictures develops and produces live-action entertainment around Hasbro brands and related projects.\n\nReady Player One premieres tonight in Hollywood before Warner Bros releases the film Wednesday for the Easter holiday weekend.\n\nShort for Read-only memory, ROM originated as a toy and then the comic ROM: Spaceknight. Hailing from a utopian society on the planet Galador, ROM is a cyborg who, after defeating the invading Dire Wraith on its planet, continues the battle on Earth and other planets.\n\nPenn, who is known for adapting comic book and sci-fi stories for the big screen, is a true fan of Hasbro’s brands and has always loved the property. It long has been considered a potential tentpole for Hasbro.\n\nPenn started his career selling his first script The Last Action Hero at 23. He has worked on numerous Marvel Comics movie transfers including X-Men 2 and X-Men: The Last Stand, Elektra, The Incredible Hulk and The Avengers, to go along with pics like PCU, Behind Enemy Lines and Suspect Zero.\n\nPenn currently is working on a script for Warner Bros that is set in The Matrix universe hatched by the Wachowskis. Penn also has moved into TV, starting with the Syfy original series Alphas that starred David Strathairn.\n\nPenn is repped by UTA and attorney Jeff Frankel.\n\nRelated stories\n\nSteven Spielberg Says Netflix Movies Shouldn't Win Oscars, Warns TV \"Poses Clear And Present Danger To Filmgoers\"\n\n'Ready Player One' Cast Celebrates Spielberg; Talk Surprise Set Visits From George Lucas & Tom Cruise - Wondercon\n\nNatasha Rothwell To Write Feature 'Bridal Recall' For Paramount Pictures"
