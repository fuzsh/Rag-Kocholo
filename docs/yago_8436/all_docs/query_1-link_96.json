        "text": "Screenwriter Zak Penn has been involved in his fair share of comic book movies, from X2 and X3 to Elektra to next year's The Incredible Hulk. But the project he's most excited about is the planned Avengers film, which Penn is slated to write.\n\n\"To me, the thing I loved as a kid was the way [of] the Marvel universe,\" says Penn. \"The thing that was inspiring to me, and I do think there's a correlative with Greek Mythology, was the way it was not just a comic book or a story, but it was a whole universe that existed. And as a kid you could imagine, 'Oh, all these superheroes are out there and they all live in this same world and when one of them needs help the other one goes to do it.' It was a whole universe that existed. And now that Marvel actually owns all these properties, one of the things that convinced me to come and be a part of The Hulk, and I'm supposed to write an Avengers movie actually, is the idea of helping them create a cinematic universe not unlike what they've done with Star Trek or the Star Wars movies to a lesser extent, where this is the universe that exists and you can tell stories in any part of that universe. Captain Picard can show up in a movie with Captain Kirk. Wouldn't it be great if you could get into that [with Marvel]?\"\n\nPenn, a comics fan himself of course, was particularly impressed by writer Mark Millar's The Ultimates, a sort of reboot of the classic Avengers team book that took place in the Ultimate Marvel universe and featured a more realistic and \"cinematic\" take on the team that traditionally features characters like Iron Man, Captain America, the Hulk, Thor, and others.\n\n\"When I picked up The Ultimates again, I was blown away,\" says Penn. \"That was as sophisticated a comic book as I had ever read, and I found it incredibly inspiring and I would love to bring [to the film] some of the way that Millar made you believe, 'What would the world be like if these superheroes existed and could you tell real adult stories with them?' My goal is I hope Marvel gets to the point where you guys could see a movie where all these characters existed and there was a continuity.\"\n\nAnd yet, don't quite hold your breath. Penn says that while he was assigned the task of writing the film version of The Avengers, he still has another project on his plate that he must tend to first. And besides, some have questioned the feasibility of a superhero team-up movie featuring mostly A-list characters -- though Penn is not one such person.\n\n\"I'm going to get to it,\" he says of the script. \"If Iron Man and Hulk work, then why not? Why couldn't we do something where we combine all those people into one movie? â€¦ Expense, that never stopped anyone in Hollywood. Theoretically, I think that can work, but I think it's years down the line. These [other] movies have to come out first and then it will happen.\"\n\nAs for his preferred roster for an Avengers movie? Penn's not talking.\n\n\"Not sure yet,\" he says. \"Can I get back to you on that one? Call me in a year and a half.\""
