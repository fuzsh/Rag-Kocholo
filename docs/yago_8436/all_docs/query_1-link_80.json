        "text": "Director Len Wiseman and screenwriter Zak Penn have teamed up for Black Chapter, a sci-fi thriller that will be produced and co-financed by Skydance Productions.\n\nBlack Chapter centers on an FBI agent who is drawn into a classified military program that trains its operatives to use paranormal abilities.\n\nPenn, who wrote many Marvel-based superhero movies in the 2000s, wrote the script after concocting the story with Wiseman, who had an interest in secret government programs such as CIA’s astral projection plans.\n\nSTORY: ‘Sleepy Hollow’ Stars and EPs Talk Season 2 Plans, Fan Passion for Ichabod/Abbie\n\n“Len and Zak have created a truly original piece of science fiction that reimagines the spy genre set in the world of the supernatural,” said Skydance’s David Ellison in a statement. “This is exactly the type of original storytelling that we want to produce.”\n\nEllison and Dana Goldberg will produce for Skydance Productions. Wiseman will produce through his Sketch Films production shingle.\n\nPaul Schwake will executive produce for Skydance Productions and David Bernardi will executive produce for Sketch Films.\n\nWiseman is the director behind many of the Underworld movies and he also directed the Total Recall remake and Live Free or Die Hard. He co-created Fox’s Sleepy Hollow.\n\nPenn’s credits include The Avengers, X-Men 2, X-Men: The Last Stand and The Incredible Hulk. He also co-created the Syfy series Alphas.\n\nWiseman is repped by CAA and Behr & Abramson. Penn is repped by CAA and McKuin Frankel."
