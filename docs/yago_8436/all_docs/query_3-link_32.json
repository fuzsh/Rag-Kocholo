        "text": "After Avengers 4 is released the Marvel Cinematic Universe will continue to thrive. There are already seven total release dates set up for seven untitled films. One of those films will be developed by screenwriter Zak Penn. Penn is behind films such as X-Men 2, The Incredible Hulk, Elektra, The Avengers, and most recently Ready Player One.\n\nDuring a recent interview with ScreenRant, Penn said that he's going to work on one final Marvel Studios project before he's done with the superhero genre. He says:\n\n\"I think I’m probably gonna come back. I think I’m gonna do one more Marvel, one more project in the Marvel Universe. I’m about to start doing, but…I have to check and see if I’m allowed to say what it is. For the most part I had a long run on comic book movies and I was kind of eager to, you know, just cause it can be really crushing, you know, at times…\"\n\nPenn went on to talk about working with Marvel and how superhero fatigue hit him pretty hard until this past year gave him a second wind.\n\n\"Here’s the thing. Give them credit; I remember Kevin Feige saying like 13 years ago that he wanted to do Guardians of the Galaxy so he could do something with a totally different tone and he hopefully would get there. When I was at Marvel, we were just trying to get... I mean they asked, 'What movie do you want to write?' and I said the Avengers and it was always just about getting to the Avengers, you know? So I agree that now… like I was getting sick of comic book movies, honestly, I was getting really sick of them, until this past year. I mean I thought Logan is the best X-Men movie that’s been made and I thought Deadpool was one of the better superhero adaptations ever and so I applaud them for spreading their wings.\"\n\nWith that being said, I'm sure he plans on continuing that aspect of these film of trying new and different things that will make the film unique in its own way. He doesn't sound like a person who will give us just more of the same.\n\nIt's really hard to guess what Penn might be working on at this point, but we'll eventually find out! We can scratch the Spider-Man 2, Black Panther 2, and Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 off the list because they already have filmmakers attached to them.\n\nMinus Elektra, Penn has done some solid work in his career, so I can't wait to see what he's going to be working on!"
