Deadline reports that Penn (Ready Player One, The Avengers) will adapt the property into a feature film for Paramount and Hasbroâ€™s Allspark Pictures.\n\nROM is a character who began as a toy before Marvel was licensed to produce an ongoing comic book for the line. ROM comes from a utopian society on the planet Galador and is a cyborg who, after defeating the invading Dire Wraith on its planet, continues the battle on Earth and other planets. The Dire Wraiths became a threat in various Marvel comic arcs, often involving ROM, such as X-Men and The Avengers."
