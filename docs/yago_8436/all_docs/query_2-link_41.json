        "text": "30 Minutes or Less (2011)\n\nCast: Jesse Eisenberg, Danny McBride, Aziz Ansari, Nick Swardson, Dilshad Vadsaria\n\nDirector: Ruben Fleischer\n\n30 Minutes or Less is the story of a pizza delivery driver named Nick (Jesse Eisenberg) who is kidnapped by two thugs (Danny McBride and Nick Swardson) in need of some fast cash, and a lot of it. Strapping Nick in a vest with a timer and a bomb, he has 10 hours to rob $100,000 from a bank or the bomb goes up in flames. As the countdown continues, Nick is forced to deal with his kidnappers, the police, and a host of other problems.\n\nIn 2010, the film set up shop in Grand Rapids for four months of production, and the city is referenced multiple times throughout the movie.\n\nAfter the bank robbery takes place, a big car chase scene rolls down South Division Avenue between Fulton Street and Wealthy Street. In a separate scene, Eisenberg's character can be seen driving down familiar red brick roads in the historic Heritage Hill neighborhood while delivering pizzas.\n\nTwo Grand Rapids eateries enjoyed their moments in the spotlight during 30 Minutes or Less. Vito’s Pizza on West Fulton Street is the restaurant where Eisenberg’s character works in the film. And, McBride and Swardson are seen eating “victory tacos” in a restaurant in the movie that many locals will recognize as Taco Boy, “home of the super burrito,” located on Plainfield Avenue.\n\nAziz Ansari’s character, Chet, recommends that he and Eisenberg grab some food at another local eatery, Mr. Burger, at one point in the movie. Ansari’s character is even a teacher at local Brookside Elementary School and scenes were filmed in the hallways of the school.\n\nThe historic Sixth Street Bridge also makes an appearance when Eisenberg runs across the bridge to visit his love interest in the Brass Works Building on the other side of the Grand River.\n\nBlock Party (2022)\n\nCast: Antoinette Robinson, Golden Brooks, Birgundi Baker, Margaret Avery, Charlyne Yi, Luenell, Bill Cobbs, John Amos\n\nDirector: Dawn Wilkinson\n\nBilled as the “first Juneteenth family holiday comedy,” Block Party tells the tale of recent Harvard grad Keke McQueen (Antoinette Robinson), who is eager to ditch her hometown of Grand Rapids for her dream job in Atlanta. But when Keke discovers that her Grandma Janice (Margaret Avery) is showing early signs of dementia, she puts her career at stake in order to save her Grandma's Juneteenth block party, and in the process, falls back in love with her hometown and its people.\n\nCreated and produced by Grand Rapids native Lisa Mathis for her Michigan-based, African American female-owned Branch Out Productions, Block Party is a love letter to the city. Cast and crew filmed in GR during the fall of 2021, with scenes set in and around the neighborhood of Martin Luther King Jr. Park, where the movie’s block party takes place.\n\nMathis told the WGVU Morning Show that, while growing up in Grand Rapids, “I used to always go to Martin Luther King Park, because I had cousins who lived around here. It's just such a wonderful neighborhood when I was growing up, and I really wanted to highlight it because it's something you don't always see.”\n\nIn addition to the park and surrounding streets and houses showcased in the film, the House of Style – a beauty salon and barber serving the local community for more than 50 years – was the backdrop for several scenes. The bulk of the production was based here, employing more than 200 local people, with some additional scenes shot on location in Detroit.\n\nWhy Him? (2016)\n\nCast: Bryan Cranston, James Franco, Megan Mullally, Zoey Deutch, Cedric the Entertainer\n\nDirector: John Hamburg\n\nDuring the holiday season, Ned (Bryan Cranston), a loving, yet overprotective father, travels to California to visit his daughter Stephanie (Zoey Deutch) at Stanford University. While there, he is surprised by his biggest nightmare: her well-meaning, but socially awkward new boyfriend, Laird (James Franco). Even though Franco is a Silicon Valley multimillionaire, Cranston disapproves of his happy-go-lucky outlook on life and unfiltered persona. His panic levels escalate even further when he learns that Franco plans to ask Deutch to marry him.\n\nIn Why Him?, Cranston’s family lives in Grand Rapids. Film crews were spotted in the city filming footage for the movie in March 2016.\n\nWhile watching the film’s establishing helicopter shot, the skyline may look familiar because it’s Grand Rapids’ beautiful skyline! The film also shows the US-131 S-curve (between Pearl Street and Wealthy Street exits) in an aerial shot, as well as a shot of Flanagan’s Irish Pub, located near Rosa Parks Circle.\n\nAnd there are plenty of Grand Rapids-specific references throughout the rest of the movie, including a West Michigan Whitecaps pennant hanging on the wall of Cranston’s office. Also, the logo for Uptown hot dog eatery, Yesterdog, gets some considerable screen time on a hoodie worn by actor and Michigan native Zack Pearlman.\n\nCarrie and Jess Save the Universe! (2022)\n\nCast: Richard Karn, Samantha Berends, Lydia Keen, Kristin Mellian, Robert William Ford, David Brown\n\nDirector: Joshua Courtade\n\nCarrie and Jess Save the Universe! is a family-friendly sci-fi adventure written and directed by Joshua Courtade as an homage to comedy-adventure movies of the 1980s. In the film, best friends Carrie and Jess plan a rad vacation to the Beach Planet, but their plans are interrupted when they encounter the heinous Space Queen, who’s using a portable black hole to usurp power from the President of Earth. (Did we mention it’s also a musical?)\n\nThe movie was filmed entirely in Grand Rapids in 2021, though the majority of the scenes were shot on the soundstage at Compass College of Film and Media due to the special effects required. Courtade is a Compass faculty member and he employed fellow faculty as well as school alumni and current students as crew. The movie premiered at Celebration Cinema! North and also played GR Comic-Con before being shopped to distributors and film festivals.\n\nAnother Compass College production gives viewers more glimpses of the local landscape: The Watchers is an eight-episode spiritual thriller produced for TV, telling the tale of an earthly battle between the archangel Michael and his brother, the devil. It was shot entirely in Grand Rapids, with locations including the parking garage and alleyways of Celebration Cinema! Studio Park, Heritage Park and Staybridge Suites in Grandville, several office buildings, a church and a brewery. It is streaming on Roku.\n\nThe End of the Tour (2015)\n\nCast: Jesse Eisenberg, Jason Segel, Joan Cusack, Anna Chlumsky, Ron Livingston\n\nDirector: James Ponsoldt\n\nBased on true events, The End of the Tour is the story of the five-day interview between Rolling Stones reporter David Lipsky (Jesse Eisenberg) and acclaimed novelist David Foster Wallace (Jason Segel) in 1996 as Segel traveled the country promoting his groundbreaking novel, Infinite Jest.\n\nTara Hernandez at the time of filming was the Marketing and Communications Director for the Gerald R. Ford International Airport Authority. She recalled a crew of more than 100 people spending more than 14-hours filming scenes in various locations throughout the Gerald R. Ford International Airport. Grand Rapids stood in as both the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport and Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport with two different scenes created among the location.\n\nHernandez remembers the crew being very engaged and friendly with the airport staff. She added that due to limited space in the airport, Eisenberg and Segel used administrative offices as green rooms, with Eisenberg occupying her office.\n\n“At one point Jesse [Eisenberg] came down and said, ‘Tara, who’s the girl in the photo with you?’ He was speaking about a picture of my sister and I, and then he said, ‘Is your husband in the military?’ because he saw a photo of my husband and I at the Marine Corps Ball,” says Hernandez. “We were sharing family stories and talking about where each of us grew up. They were both very nice guys and easy to work with, along with the crew being fantastic.”\n\nTwo Grand Rapids bookshops are also featured in the film. Redux Books was used in one of the first scenes of the movie during which Eisenberg’s character gives a presentation about his 2010 New York Times bestselling book, Although Of Course You End Up Becoming Yourself: A Road Trip with David Foster Wallace.\n\nSchuler's Books & Cafe on 28th Street Southeast was used in one of the last scenes of the movie, standing in for a Barnes & Noble bookstore. The scene features Eisenberg’s character reflecting on his conversations with Segel’s character while conducting his own book signing.\n\nAnd if you’re visiting the Allendale Campus of Grand Valley State University, be sure to stop in Mackinac Hall where the cast and crew filmed a scene.\n\nMiss Rainbow Magic: The Beginning (2022)\n\nCast: Aghniettia Devlin, Jimmy Flair, Adrienne Mosley, Shyanne Queen, John White\n\nDirector: Nuri Bauswell\n\nMiss Rainbow Magic tells the tale of a young Black woman coming to terms with her supernatural abilities and her struggle to break free from the criminal enterprise that has exploited her – and will now go to any lengths necessary to discover the secret of her magic powers.\n\nGrand Rapids-based writer-director-cinematographer-editor Nuri Bauswell filmed the move entirely in Grand Rapids in late 2021 and early 2022, and attentive viewers will spot a number of recognizable locations, including the panoramic skyline of the city.\n\nMiss Rainbow Magic: The Beginning premiered at Celebration Cinema! North."
