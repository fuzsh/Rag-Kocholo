People who know Animatrix and the comics understand,” he wrote.\n\n“Can’t comment yet except to say that the words ‘reboot’ and ‘remake’ were from an article. Let’s stop responding to inaccurate news.”\n\n“If I were going to recast Keanu Reeves, I would cast Keanu Reeves,” he referred to the main star of the original film.\n\n“How about just re-release the matrix? Don’t reboot it, you can’t do better.\n\n“…Do I want to see more stories set in the universe of the matrix? Yes. Because it’s a brilliant idea that generates great stories.” (PTI)"
