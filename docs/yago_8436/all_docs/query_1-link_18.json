        "text": "(dramatic music)\n\n[Man] When this project was first pitched to me\n\nI said yes quicker than anything\n\nI've ever been presented before.\n\nThat's just because I have this intense nostalgia.\n\nI grew up on Atari.\n\nThe moment that the first cartridge\n\nappeared in the bucket, the first time\n\nthat I saw a mound of dirt that had just been pulled out,\n\nand there was an ET game sitting at the top of it,\n\nit was kinda surreal.\n\nWe found an intact ET, the video game.\n\n(cheering)\n\nET is definitely here.\n\nHere we are, I'm actually holding\n\none of the ET cartridges that was\n\npulled out of the landfill.\n\nIt was a legend in the video game industry\n\nfor three decades, and now, finally,\n\nwe can say with absolute certainty,\n\nthat it is true.\n\nAtari was really buried out here\n\nin the New Mexico dessert.\n\n(video game sound effect)\n\n[Player] The worst video game ever.\n\nET for Atari.\n\nIt was bad, brutal, unfair, didn't make a lot of sense.\n\n[Narrator] How did a company that was so innovative\n\nfail so miserably.\n\nThe zenith of Atari, the point in\n\nthe late 70s and early 80s\n\nwhen this kind of group\n\nof some creative genius engineers\n\ncame together to create this amazing company.\n\nAnd I think it was a kind of\n\ncompletely unique company at the time.\n\nIt was doing something that no one else did.\n\nOver there's where the hot tub was,\n\ninside on the first floor\n\nthere's some great stuff that went on in that room.\n\nOver here, here's the hill that, ya know\n\none day I was wearing a dashiki shirt\n\nwhich I was very into back then\n\nand I would do somersaults down the hill.\n\nI might have had some cocktails\n\nthat afternoon at that point.\n\nDid you know that you were entering\n\nthis crazy party atmosphere that you'd be\n\nNo, even though I was told I was,\n\nI had no expectation that it could really exist.\n\n[Nolan] The best recruiting tool we could have\n\nfor an engineer was to bring him over\n\nto one of our parties.\n\nHey, what's happening people?\n\nHey, how's it goin'?\n\n[Nolan] They thought, Hey, I'm a nerd\n\nthere are girls here, they're talking to me.\n\nIt's good.\n\nThat was the culture.\n\nThese guys are the lifeblood of the biz\n\nand they do what they wanna do.\n\nAnd that's fine.\n\nThat's what made them the fastest\n\nrising company in American business history\n\nand also made them the fastest\n\nfalling company in American business history.\n\n[Jonathan] And the mystery itself was really\n\nthe thing that drew me to it.\n\nIs that, why, after 30 years, do so many people,\n\ncare so much about a bunch of garbage.\n\nWe needed to find a director who\n\nfirst and foremost,\n\nwas a part of the gaming community,\n\nunderstood the gaming community,\n\nand there weren't a lot of people\n\nwho fit that description\n\nand it sort of was a little bit of a no-brainer.\n\nHe's got a kind of enduring fascination with\n\nthe evolution of myths and legends.\n\nHe made a film called Incident at Loch Ness,\n\nwhich dealt with mythology\n\nand the mythology of Loch Ness.\n\n[Zac] I think the reasons why Atari\n\nburied these games in the desert,\n\nthey're actually a little bit more complicated\n\nand mundane than people would like them to be.\n\nWhat we found out was that they used to crush the games.\n\nAnd crushing the games is more expensive than burying them.\n\nSo, Joe Lewandowski is the guy\n\nwho actually figured out where the games were.\n\nHe's the historian, if you will.\n\nAbout four years ago, all of a sudden\n\na bunch of people started calling\n\nand it was like what's next, what's the interest?\n\nSo, it's kinda entertaining to read all that\n\nwhen you actually were there\n\nand knowing what had happened.\n\nAnd then we went through the process\n\nof locating and doing all this stuff\n\nand gathering information and witnesses\n\nand it's like, eh, maybe there is a story.\n\nThere was also this guy, Jim Heller,\n\nwho appeared really just weeks before\n\nthe movie went into production\n\nand Jim was actually the guy who buried the games.\n\nHe was the individual at Atari\n\nwho was responsible for getting those games\n\nand putting them in this landfill.\n\nI worked in Atari from 1976 to 1983.\n\nI do not know exactly what was sent up here.\n\nI just know it was by the truckload.\n\nOnce Jim materialized, it really,\n\nI think it helped narrow down the search\n\nto the point where we were able to be successful.\n\nWe took up about 1500, I would say,\n\nthat they thought were representative of the whole.\n\nThey estimated 750,000 cartridges had been buried.\n\nBut it wasn't just bad games.\n\nThere were lots of really good games there.\n\nThe question of what happens to the cartridges,\n\nis a little bit unanswered,\n\nat least from my point-of-view.\n\nI think they're gonna put some on display.\n\nI don't know if they're gonna sell some of them.\n\nI've heard rumors that they will.\n\nThere was this funny moment at the end of shooting\n\nwhere I thought, oh good, our cartridges.\n\nAnd they were like, no, not your cartridges.\n\nYou're just making a documentary.\n\nI was like, oh yeah, you're right.\n\nYeah, I'm gonna give you one of the games\n\nthat we pulled from the ground.\n\nAre you serious?\n\nI am, and I should tell you,\n\nthis is illegal because, technically,\n\nthe city owns it, so you could go to jail.\n\nPut it in your pants before you walk out.\n\n(heavy pulsing music)\n\nHello there.\n\nI'm Howard Scott Warshaw,\n\ndesigner of Yars' Revenge,\n\nRaiders of the Lost Ark and ET.\n\nSubscribe to the Wired Channel\n\nfor more action like this."
