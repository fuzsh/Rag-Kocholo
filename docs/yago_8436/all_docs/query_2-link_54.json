        "text": "The Grand Hotel Plaza was selected in countless occasions as a filming location. Out of our many illustrious guests, we can boast Luchino Visconti, who discovered here that nineteenth century ambience that was so dear to him that the film “L’innocente” (The Innocent) was shot in our very interiors. More recently, the interiors of “Ocean’s 12”, with Brad Pitt and George Clooney, “Gangs of New York” by Martin Scorsese and \"Along Came Polly\" with Jennifer Aniston and Ben Stiller were set at the Grand Hotel Plaza.\n\nLastly, mention must also be made of the unforgettable director Federico Fellini, who loved to frequent the Grand Hotel Plaza, a place which he believed to be ideal both for meetings with directors and to find his inspiration for the characters of his films."
