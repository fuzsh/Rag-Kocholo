        "text": "Interesting comments from Penn.\n\nUpon joining the MCU, Whedon quickly decided to write the movie's screenplay and has never been overly complimentary about Penn's work, saying: \"There was a script. There just wasn't a script I was going to film a word of.\"\n\nPenn admittedly has a hit-and-miss track record after working on movies like Elektra and X-Men: The Last Stand, but we'd be remiss not to point out that he's also contributed to hits like X2: X-Men United and Free Guy.\n\n\"All the other directors we had been talking about, Joss wasn't on the list,\" he recalls. \"I heard he was going to rewrite the script himself. He didn't even want to meet with me - which, by the way, I always call the writer I'm replacing. I feel like that's courtesy.\"\n\nAssuming Whedon might be uncomfortable about the situation, Penn chose to reach out to him (they'd known each other for a long time and had both graduated from Wesleyan). \"He said to me, 'No, it's not awkward for me. I'm rewriting you.' It became pretty apparent that he had less than zero interest in, in any way, having me involved with the movie.\"\n\nPenn had spent years of his life working on the movie and said to Whedon, \"My kids have grown up while I've been working on it. They've all told their friends about it. What's going to happen when their friends are like, 'Your dad didn't work on Avengers?'\" To that, Whedon responded, \"What's going to happen when my kids think that you wrote half the story?\"\n\nAs for how he feels about the director now, Penn adds, \"I think he's a dick. I think he's a bad person, and it was really surprising. Remember, my bonus is based on my credit. So literally millions and millions of dollars, which is not the issue here, but that just came out of my pocket and went into Joss's pocket.\"\n\nTHE AVENGERS: Original Writer Zak Penn Reflects On Joss Whedon Ousting Him From Movie: \"He's A D*ck\"\n\nZak Penn wrote a screenplay for The Avengers which Joss Whedon later decided to throw out. Now, he's reflected on the arrogance he encountered while communicating with the filmmaker in the early 2010s.\n\nLooks like more juicy bits from the new MCU book. Makes Joss come across as his usual self.\n\nI'm not sure I like Age of Ultron much more than X-Men 3. And I'm not sure I like the Avengers much more than X2. I'd more readily watch X3 than the version of Justice League with Whedon's writing in it.\n\nOr let's look at it another way. X2 is way better than X-Men. And yes, I know Whedon claims that everything bad about the script as filmed wasn't his fault, but I don't care. If he had a writing credit (even if not sole writing credit) very few people would have concluded he only wrote half the movie.\n\nI mean, I can absolutely believe Penn's script was inferior. But none of that hand waves Whedon being a complete prick about it.\n\nIIRC Penn's version of the movie was much more tied to what was set up at the end of Incredible Hulk: with the Avengers being brought together to bring down the Hulk.\n\nYeah, that's what makes his complaint even weirder. He's basically complaining that although Joss rewrote the entire script, and he acknowledges that, he should have still given him story credit so he could have gotten those millions of dollars in bonuses when the movie made 1.5 billion. Basically, please let me have free money and credit for something that I had nothing to do with.\n\nthat's the thing though, he still did get story credit! He just didn't get screenplay credit. Which seems fair since...he didn't write the screenplay!\n\nWow, not news to anybody but Whedon is an unmitigated asshole.\n\nReading through the thread some of you sound just as brutal tbh. Whedon didn't have to use the script and certainly didn't have to ensure the guy got credited just to get paid, but there is a way of handling it without being a complete fucking prick about it. Whedon was nasty just for the sake of it when it probably took less effort to not be.\n\nIt's not just Whedon, though. Pretty much all of the \"name\" screenwriters that came onto a Marvel project did something similar. Nicole Perlman literally had a \"Fuck James Gunn\" party over the way she got treated on screenwriting credit for Guardians. On Iron Man 3, Marvel hired Drew Pearce to write the screenplay. Then they brought Shane Black onboard and Black's response when meeting Pearce was \"'Excuse Me, there's a British guy with a beard in this room, what's he doing here? ' And they said, 'Well, he'll be writing the draft with you,' and I said, 'Well, that's good, but no he won't.\" In the latter case, Pearce and Black ultimately ended up getting along well and they did collaborate on the movie in the end but that certainly wasn't always the case.\n\nWow, not news to anybody but Whedon is an unmitigated asshole.\n\nReading through the thread some of you sound just as brutal tbh. Whedon didn't have to use the script and certainly didn't have to ensure the guy got credited just to get paid, but there is a way of handling it without being a complete fucking prick about it. Whedon was nasty just for the sake of it when it probably took less effort to not be.\n\nPenn is being weird by contacting him at all. A tiny fraction of writers will reach out to the previous person on complicated projects to suss out what's going wrong (this has happened to me once in six years), but no one contacts the next writer unless it's to warn them about predatory behaviour. Why would you? It's their job to change your work."
