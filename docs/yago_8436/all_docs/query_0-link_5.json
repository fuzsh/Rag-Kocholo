        "text": "Not brilliant but there's enough funny bits to make it worthwhile.\n\nA mockumentary that satirizes the poker fad of the second half of the 2000s, it manages to look the part pretty well. I kept getting flashbacks of getting home from the bar and catching an episode of Poker After Dark because there was nothing else on. I think I could only handle watching the real professional poker players on TV if I were hammered. Their schticks were too much, I think. But that's where this movie thrives, the personalities.\n\nThis pretty much just lets a bunch of comedians be weirdos and go hog wild. That technique doesn't always deliver gold and a lot of coal does fall out of…\n\nI may have still liked The Grand but on the whole it's a pretty flawed movie. It lacks bite in the satire of its subculture that something like Best in Show didn't have a problem with, and its clear that The Grand is trying to be like a Christopher Guest mockumentary. The Grand does a good job setting up its characters but nothing ever feels like it gets taken far enough from its concept into something completely satisfying.\n\nThe Grand starts off strongly with its setup and is sporadically funny throughout thanks to a bizarrely strong cast, but the movie slowly declines as it goes on until it totally dies at the final table which should be the peak of…\n\nWhy I watched this one? That is easy to answer...the cast. Woody Harrelson is the headliner....but the movie also gives you David Cross, Cheryl Hines, Dennis Farina, Ray Romano, Jason Alexander, Chris Parnell and Richard Kind.\n\nWhat is this one about? A 10 million dollar winner take all poker game.\n\nMy thoughts on this one? At times this is a pretty funny movie. But at other times this is a painful movie to watch. So do the highs outweigh the lows enough to recommend watching it. Harrelson is funny....Parnell is the highlight of the movie...Cross has some nice moments too. I like Romano....but I groaned everytime he appeared in the movie.....Gabe Kaplan (where has he been) brings the movie to…"
