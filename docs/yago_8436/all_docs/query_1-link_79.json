        "text": "“Total Recall” and “Underworld” director Len Wiseman has come on board to helm the supernatural thriller “Black Chapter,” which will be produced and co-financed by Skydance Productions.\n\nZak Penn (“The Avengers,” “The Incredible Hulk”) wrote the script based on a story by Wiseman and Penn. David Ellison and Dana Goldberg will produce for Skydance Productions, and Wiseman will produce through his Sketch Films production. Paul Schwake will exec produce for Skydance Productions, and David Bernardi will exec produce for Sketch Films.\n\nStory follows a FBI agent who is drawn into a classified military program that trains its operatives to use paranormal abilities.\n\n“Len and Zak have created a truly original piece of science fiction that reimagines the spy genre set in the world of the supernatural,” said Ellison. “This is exactly the type of original storytelling that we want to produce, and I am thrilled to be in business with both of them.”\n\nWiseman is repped by CAA and Howard Abramson of Behr & Abramson. Penn is represented by CAA and Jeff Frankel of McKuin Frankel Whitehead."
