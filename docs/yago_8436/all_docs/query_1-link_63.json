        "text": "Is Duke Nukem not exciting enough for you? Are you over videogame movies? How do you feel about movies based on toys? Like, let’s say… ROM: Spaceknight?\n\nZak Penn, hot off writing Ready Player One, has been hired to pen the script for ROM for Hasbro’s Allspark Pictures and Paramount Pictures, per Deadline.\n\nROM is short for Read-only Memory, originating as a toy and later becoming the comic ROM: Spaceknight. From the Utopian society on planet Galador, ROM is a cyborg who, after defeating invaders on his own planet, continues the battle on Earth and other planets.\n\nRELATED: Avengers & Incredible Hulk Screenwriter Zak Penn Working On Unknown MCU Film\n\nAnd Zak Penn is so hot right now! Not only did he adapt Ernest Cline’s novel Ready Player One for Steven Spielberg to direct, but his name is on films like X-2: X-Men United, X-Men: The Last Stand, Elektra, The Incredible Hulk, and The Avengers (so… a lot of misses, but some hits…). Penn sold his first script, The Last Action Hero, at age 23. He also wrote Behind Enemy Lines and Suspect Zero.\n\nPenn is currently writing the script for the new Matrix movie for Warner Bros. He has even worked in TV, starting with the Syfy original series Alphas.\n\nIs ROM something you might be interested in? Does Penn’s resume reassure you, or worry you?
