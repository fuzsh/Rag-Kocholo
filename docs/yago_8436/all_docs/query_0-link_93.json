        "text": "Fans of Christopher Guest’s improvised comedies like “Best in Show” will appreciate “The Grand,” Zak Penn’s loony look at a high-stakes poker tournament.\n\nWith a $10 million winner-take-all prize, the televised tournament highlights six players who reach the finals – and what an odd bunch they are.\n\nLeading the pack: Woody Harrelson’s One-Eyed Jack, a much-married – 75 times – drug addict whose grizzled, godawful grandfather (Barry Corbin, who appears in a men’s room as a ghost) has left him his two-bit, deep-in-debt Vegas casino.\n\nCheryl Hines (“The Larry David Show”) and David Cross (“Arrested Development”) are identical twins with serious daddy issues. She’s the breadwinner while her husband (Ray Romano) plays Fantasy Football and takes care of their five kids. Her brother, always overlooked by dad (Gabe Kaplan), compensates by being obnoxious and aggressive to psych out opponents.\n\nTwo of the players might be mentally impaired. Richard Kind is the nerdy newcomer without a strategy, while Chris Parnell (“30 Rock”) could be related to Dustin Hoffman’s “Rainman.”\n\nThere is obnoxious Deuce (Dennis Farina), the simply named German (Germany’s renowned filmmaker Werner Herzog) and cameos by real-life poker players.\n\nWhile Penn can’t yet boast of a stable of regulars that make Guest’s satires seem like family visits, “The Grand” never stalls.\n\nThe humor ranges from droll, insane throwaways to inside jokes, like having Herzog, often seen cuddling a plump white bunny, parody his image as the madman of the movies, saying, “I have to kill something every day, even if it is a little bug.” Among Harrelson’s bright ideas for his casino is anuclear reactor – a vision the planning commission rejected.\n\nStandouts in support include Shannon Elizabeth as Harrelson’s potential wife No. 76, Jason Alexander’s ethnically uncertain player and Michael Karnow as the dumbest commentator poker has ever seen.\n\n(“The Grand” contains raunchy language.)\n\nRated R. At Kendall Square Cinema"
