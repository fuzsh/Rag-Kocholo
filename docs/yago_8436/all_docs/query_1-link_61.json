        "text": "'Ready Player One' screenwriter helps open Ringling College's post-production facility\n\nSARASOTA — Ringling College of Art and Design officially unveiled its post-production facility that it hopes will draw more film and series productions to Sarasota, with one of Hollywood’s biggest screenwriters on hand to help.\n\n“Ready Player One” and “The Avengers” screenwriter Zak Penn was among the guests Tuesday for a ribbon-cutting at the Ringling College Studio Labs complex. Penn also participated in a Q&A on one of two previously opened soundstages.\n\nThe post-production facility includes three smaller soundstages, various editing rooms and a screening theater, and completes Ringling College Studio Labs, part of an ongoing collaboration between Ringling College and Semkhor Productions. It will be used for both academic and commercial purposes, with Kevin Smith’s horror film “Killroy was Here” among the projects that have already visited Sarasota using Ringling College students on the crew.\n\nRingling College Studio Labs combines soundstages and post-production space like Hollywood studios, but accessible to smaller-scale productions. This could be very appealing to filmmakers.\n\n“I spent twice as long editing that as we did on some of the Marvel movies that I’ve worked on,” said Penn, who also directed the 2004 indie movie “Incident at Loch Ness.” “That’s just because how extensive your post process is often has a direct relationship to how good the movie is. The trickier the movie is, and often independent movies are very tricky, that post period is crucial.\"\n\nThe 36,000-square-foot, more than $20 million complex, primarily funded by Ringling College and Semkhor as well as a $1.75 million Sarasota County grant, was nearly a decade in the making.\n\n“When we first started this, no one dreamed it’d be like this,” said Ringling College president Larry Thompson. “We were thinking it’d be in a much, much smaller building and about 1/50 probably the size of this building, almost. But here we are.”\n\nBack in 2010, Ringling College considered converting Sarasota Municipal Auditorium into a soundstage and building a post-production facility inside the university’s Goldstein Center. An early supporter was German filmmaker Werner Herzog, who had Ringling Students work on his acclaimed documentary “Into the Abyss.\"\n\nPenn has a lengthy relationship with the director as well, starting from watching Herzog’s “Aguirre, the Wrath of God” in his own college film class. Herzog would later act in Penn’s directorial features “Incident at Loch Ness” and “The Grand,” and Penn worked on Herzog’s war drama “Rescue Dawn.”\n\n“Someone called me up and said, ‘There’s this director Werner Herzog …,’ and I said, ‘I’m in,’” Penn said. “And they said, ‘Well, he needs someone to …,’ and I said, ‘I’ll do it.’ They said, ‘There’s no money,’ and I was like, ‘I don’t care, I’ll do it.’”\n\n“Ready Player One” is Penn’s latest film and offered him the chance to work with Steven Spielberg. Penn said working with Spielberg was a dream of his, particularly on “Ready Player One,” which had a pop culture reference-laden personality similar to Penn’s own first script “Last Action Hero.”\n\n“When I went to Hollywood, I hoped that I would get to work with Steven Spielberg,” Penn said. “Then to get the opportunity to work with him every day for years so closely, and to be sitting behind him as he did everything masterfully, it’s an incredible experience.”\n\nPenn’s career has also included two eras of Marvel superhero movies, starting with 2003’s “X-Men 2.\" Then he would help write “The Incredible Hulk” and “The Avengers,” two of the earliest films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, which have superheroes interact in a shared universe and which have become some of the world’s biggest movies.\n\n“We were making movies for people who didn’t love those comic books, quite honestly,” Penn said. “And we would sit there saying, 'God, wouldn’t it be great if Marvel had its own studio and we could make a movie that felt like the comic books, where all the characters lived in the same universe?'”\n\nPenn is currently writing a script in the world of another famous franchise: The Matrix series. And he wasn’t the only out-of-town visitor working on big-budget productions that attended Tuesday's event.\n\nJessica Pinns graduated from Ringling College with a film major in 2016. She’s since worked in the camera department on the Netflix series “House of Cards” as well as the upcoming “Wonder Woman” sequel.\n\nShe left Florida after graduating and currently lives in Baltimore before she moves to Los Angeles. But she hopes Ringling College Studio Labs can help bring more productions to the state, and keep Ringling College students there.\n\n“I know so many talented filmmakers in this area, but there’s just not enough work,” Pinns said. “But there will be; I have full faith there will be stuff back here.”"
