        "text": "\"He (Whedon) is entitled to his opinion but he is wrong. Obviously, I don't agree with him. I found his statement a little bit inappropriate. I don't want to comment on it too much.\n\n\"I worked on a draft for 'Avengers' for four years and he came in and rewrote it. It's not like I wrote a story and handed it to him and he threw it out. That's not how things work. He should not be talking about it in public, if you ask me,\" Penn told PTI in a telephonic interview from Los Angeles.\n\n\"I started at square one on the script. I mean, straight up. I don't wanna rag on it, but I fought (for) that credit. I was very upset about it. I know how the Guild works, the first guy on a movie and all that, but I've never had good luck with arbitrations... I read (Penn's script) one time, and I've never seen it since. I was like, 'Nope. There's nothing here,\" Whedon had said in a recent interview to Thrillist.\n\nPenn, who once worked on many Marvel films, has fond memories of working on the initial draft of \"Hulk\" and finally writing 2008's \"The Incredible Hulk\", which is set to air in India on June 8 on Sony PIX.\n\n\"I think it is great. I have always loved the character. I worked on it. I started working on the first movie when I was in my 20s, but that script got thrown away... I have always loved the character and it is great to see how he has been embraced by the audiences. I am happy for the big guy,\" he says.\n\nHe just had a huge success with \"Ready Player One\" and Penn credits the director for making it one of his most memorable collaborations in Hollywood as he believes one is as good as the person they work with.\n\n\"There is no comparison to working with Steven Spielberg. It is a greater experience than working on other ones combined together. What makes scriptwriting either really fun or terrible is the people you work with.\n\n\"There are times when you get lucky and get to work with a master like Spielberg... Then, there are people who make it not fun, no matter how fun the end product is.\"\n\n\"It is a tough job. There is a lot of fighting to keep yourself employed. People get fired a lot, particularly the writers, but I cannot complain. The last experience (Ready Player One) was the most fun I ever had. It can be really fun.\"\n\nAsked if he was looking to direct again, the scribe says, \"Sure, I will do it again. I have mostly done smaller films because I like to have control over what I am directing. But I will do it again soon.\""
