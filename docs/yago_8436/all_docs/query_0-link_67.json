        "text": "Review\n\nThe Christopher Guest improvisational mockumentary form is precarious: In a heartbeat the actors can go from too realistic (not funny) to too broad (bye-bye illusion). Zak Penn’s The Grand is a seesaw, but the settingthe high-stakes poker subcultureis remarkably fertile and the actors are a treat. Cheryl Hines has mastered the technique of remaining unaffectedly chirpy in moments of extreme farce, and Ray Romano is a groggy wonder as her husband, who was once struck by lightning and is now a beat behind. Best of all is Chris Parnell, who meets no one’s eyes and holds forth in a singsong monotonean Asperger’s poster boy even those with the syndrome will find gut-busting.\n\nRelated Stories\n\nNew York Magazine Reviews\n\nDavid Edelstein's Full Review\n\nFeatured In"
