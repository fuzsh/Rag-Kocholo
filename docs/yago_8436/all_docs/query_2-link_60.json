        "text": "The spirit of “Sans Soleil” casts a long shadow over Miguel Gomes’ beguiling “Grand Tour,” a less essayistic but similarly atemporal travelogue that sometimes feels almost as indebted to Chris Marker as Gomes’ “Tabu” was to F.W. Murnau. Much like Marker’s 1983 masterpiece, Gomes’ film is propelled by the mysterious frisson that it creates between “exotic” documentary footage and disembodied narration. And much like “Sans Soleil,” “Grand Tour” uses that non-stop voiceover to shape its accompanying images into an abstract story about the elusive relationship between time and memory.\n\nIn this case, that story is a love story (of sorts), one that again finds Gomes harkening back to the kind of blinkered colonial romances that were so prevalent in the…\n\nMiguel Gomes’s GRAND TOUR is a demanding cinematic experience that rewards those willing to embrace its creativity. Part love story, part space-time travelogue, but always dreamy with its evocative black-and-white imagery, often feeling like it was plucked from a different era. The unconventional structure & innovative use of the form can be captivating, even if I didn’t find myself fully invested in the characters. This is a pure art house film where mileage will vary. Curious to catch it again later this year.\n\nNext Best Picture’s review here\n\ntruly nothing will have me barking at the air like the sight of a tropical soundstage shot on monochrome film. orientalism and artifice is very much at the core of the movie, particularly in how it interweaves languages, fiction, documentary, and temporalities, but everything aside this is just a real pleasure to sink into. conversations with friends afterwards was very much me doing 'Local Woman Always Gets Little Rush Out Of Telling People About Sayombhu Mukdeeprom's Filmography'\n\nWesterners don’t understand Eastern culture, it transcends them.\n\nFavourite of MIFF to date. A travelogue through Asia. Bangkok, Saigon, Manila, Osaka, Shanghai, Chongqing, Chengdu and into the bamboo forests where 7-8 pipes of opium will give you clarity.\n\nWhat a blast, going to have spectacular dreams tonight.\n\nPlayed in Official Competition at Cannes in 2024 with Miguel Gomes winning the Best Director Award (on what I’ve seen to date a deserved winner).\n\nPeople so unaware of the specificities of their environments they start associating themselves with a time they won’t be alive to see conceived.\n\nRomance unfulfilled to channel the disconnection between the spectacle of the Hollywood trope and the dynamics of the European touristic gaze. It can’t always keep its own game (the deviation in the second half can’t compare to what Tabu did with its most devastating narrative transition), but its anachronistic language gives enough of a pretext for its final moments. We experience different settings, but all these voices tell the same story, the characters just happen to never deviate from their destiny, their culture wasn't built to make them understand how doomed they are as the spotlight makes sure that they are already coexisting with the world repairing itself from their imposed presence.\n\nLast day of SFF…Unfortunately had a woman blocking my view so struggled to read the subtitles, and I had to move into an extremely uncomfortable position making it so I couldn’t really engage or get into the film and didn’t really understand what was happening, but from what I gathered with other reviews it was confusing anyway. But now my back hurts. Kept waiting for it too end.\n\nMaybe I should’ve copied the person next to me and sit on the floor.\n\nOn a sad sidenote, my friend who I’ve been with SFF for the whole time couldn’t make it today as he had something come up.\n\nAlso I’d like to mention that I enjoyed yesterdays doctor who episode, but I might write more on that tomorrow or later tonight.\n\nLess coughing in the audience at state theatre than normal so that’s a plus!\n\nCannes 2024 Initial Impression\n\nThere’s an image where a smartphone is placed in the past and begins to ring, the present disrupting the past.\n\nThere’s a an image of a motorbike driving through city streets which dissolves to a dance upon a stage, except the dissolve stops, so the images float synchronously, and a further image is then added, a dissolve within a dissolve, the various presences alive and complicating one another.\n\nThere’s an image of a shadow puppet show, where first we see behind the screen, the illusion, and subsequently the actual shadow puppet show, as Gomes is comfortable with his own prowess as a director, with interrogating the artifice of the narratives he weaves.\n\nThere’s an image of…"
