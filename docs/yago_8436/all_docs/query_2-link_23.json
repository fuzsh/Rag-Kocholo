        "text": "After a nine-year absence from the director’s chair, Catherine Breillat returned with 36 FILLETTE, having lost none of her power to push both boundaries and buttons. Delphine Zentout plays Lili, a precocious fourteen-year-old girl on a seaside family vacation. Drawn to a bitter middle-aged man (Étienne Chicot), Lili longs to lose her virginity and initiates a contest of wills in which she discovers herself more mature than, but still rattled by the equivocations of, her chauvinistic counterpart. Fueled by an extraordinary performance by then-sixteen-year-old Zentout, and featuring a scene-stealing Jean-Pierre Léaud as Lili’s brief confidant, 36 FILLETTE showcases Breillat as an incisive chronicler of the subtle evolutions of teenage desire.\n\nPart of our series, Un Bouquet de Breillat.\n\nIn French with English subtitles.\n\n“36 Fillette rings so true that to watch it is like eavesdropping on life. French director Catherine Breillat’s film of her own novel is so fresh and incisive, so poignant yet funny, that its coming-of-age story unfolds as if it were the first of its kind.” Kevin Thomas, Los Angeles Times\n\n20th anniversary!\n\nWhen the hapless Sing (Stephen Chow) and his dim-witted pal, Bone, try to scam the residents of Pig Sty Alley into thinking they're members of the dreaded Axe Gang, the real gangsters descend on this Shanghai slum to restore their fearsome reputation. What gang leader Brother Sum doesn't know is that three legendary retired kung fu masters live anonymously in this decrepit neighborhood and don't take kindly to interlopers.\n\nPart of our 20th Anniversary Celebration Series!\n\nIn Cantonese with English subtitles.\n\n“Chow, perhaps the first action star and filmmaker to be as influenced by classic cartoons as by the karate-chop balletics of human movement, directs like a gonzo fusion of Tarantino and Tex Avery.” Owen Gleiberman, Entertainment Weekly\n\n“It’s a short, sharp shock to the cinematic system that’s virtually impossible to dislike, and if you don’t leave the theatre grinning your face off, then, buddy, movies just aren’t for you.” Marc Savlov, The Austin Chronicle\n\n45th anniversary! Come out to play-ay!\n\nA turf battle between New York City street gangs rages from Coney Island to the Bronx. The Warriors are mistakenly fingered for the killing of a gang leader. Soon they have every gang in the city out to get revenge and they must make their way across the city to their own turf.\n\nPart of our 20th Anniversary Celebration Series!\n\n“The movie is like visual rock, and it’s bursting with energy.” Pauline Kael, The New Yorker\n\n“If Bruce Springsteen were a filmmaker he might have directed The Warriors, for its rhythmic, vivid camerawork is a visual rock ‘n’ roll.” Michael Ventura, L.A. Weekly\n\nCatherine Breillat traces the shockingly violent disintegration of a May-December affair in PERFECT LOVE, arguably her most realistic and disturbing study of romance gone wrong. When twice-divorced optician Frédérique (Isabelle Renauld) falls for the much younger Christophe (Francis Renaud), whose insecurity is matched only by his unconscious need for manipulation and control, she eventually becomes addicted to their toxic relationship. Once more demonstrating a superlative ear for dialogue and a preternatural ability to elicit thunderous performances, Breillat delves into the psychological roots and consequences of codependency with the unflinching courage that has become her trademark.\n\nPart of our series, Un Bouquet de Breillat.\n\nIn French with English subtitles.\n\nNamed One of the Ten Great Neglected Feature Films of the Nineties by Manohla Dargis (Film Comment).\n\n“The performances are unsentimental, the tone uncompromising … There’s no denying its emotional punch or the intelligence of its dark insights.” Geoff Andrew, Time Out\n\nFAMILY PORTRAIT follows a sprawling family on a morning when they have planned a group picture. After the mother disappears and one of the daughters becomes increasingly anxious to find her and take the picture, the rest of the family appears to resist any attempt to gather. Initially presenting itself as a realistic portrayal of a family on an idle but hectic summer day, the film progressively descends into a realm where time and space lose their grip, transforming the family portrait into a solemn and enigmatic ritual of transition.\n\nWinner of the Locarno Boccalino d’Oro for Best Director at the 2023 Locarno Film Festival.\n\n“Begins as a slippery drama before gradually descending into something closer to surreal horror… If you’re willing to take the plunge, it’s a haunting experience.” Chase Hutchinson, Collider\n\n“Still waters run deep in this feature debut… the images that [director] Kerr finds along the way gradually reveal a bold new filmmaker whose vision penetrates well below the surface of American self-identity.” David Ehrlich, IndieWire\n\n“A low-key fever dream. Unnerving. Quietly haunting.” Neil Young, Screen Daily\n\nA bold new splatter-western shot entirely on 16mm film - utilizing equipment from the 1960s for an authentic retro aesthetic and filmmaking experience!\n\nOn the wild frontier of the American prairie, Molly Pray is on a bloody crusade against the criminal forces that have wronged her. She shows no mercy, leaving a trail of bodies in her wake on a mission that ultimately strikes at the heart of the American identity and the notion of manifest destiny. But for Molly Pray - who has the embodied specter of death on her side - this isn’t political. This is personal.\n\nWriter/director Austin Snell will be present in-person for a post-show Q&A!\n\nWHOOP WHOOP!\n\nTrey, an ex-con and Juggalo, embarks on a wild journey with his devoted best friend, Silas, to the Gathering of the Juggalos. Armed with drugs and dreams of horrorcore rap stardom, they are presented with a chance to perform at the event, and a shot at becoming Jugga-famous. Their plans take a dark turn when they clash with a corrupt sheriff and get caught in a dangerous scheme orchestrated by a fellow Juggalo turned sadistic criminal. As they fight for survival, Trey and Silas find unexpected allies and confront their own demons. With courage and sacrifice, they ultimately triumph over evil and find out who they truly are, setting out on a new path, bound by their unique culture and the knowledge that Juggalo Family can overcome all.\n\nWinner: Best Feature Film, Chattanooga Film Festival 2024.\n\n“Off Ramp is an equally odd and beautiful movie, and the Juggalos wouldn’t have it any other way.” Kyle Logan, ScreenAnarchy\n\n“Nathan Tape’s film will charm audiences whether or not they’re down with the clown, and have them joining an angelic chorus of ‘Whoop Whoop.’ We may not know how magnets work, but, like Off Ramp, they show us how to come together.” Meagan Navarro, Bloody Disgusting\n\n25th anniversary!\n\nCatherine Breillat’s landmark film ROMANCE placed her as an audacious boundary-pushing female auteur, establishing her as a provocateur who opened the doors to women directors taking charge of their own sexual ideals and imagery. This is the tale of a beautiful woman’s frustration with the lack of intimacy in her relationship, who seeks out sexual adventures in order to spark the interest of her lover, a self-absorbed male model. This new HD version of the critically acclaimed and commercial hit reminds viewers of Breillat’s fierce intensity in confronting sexuality with a raw honesty rarely seen.\n\nPart of our series, Un Bouquet de Breillat.\n\nIn French with English subtitles.\n\n“Romance can’t be easily shrugged off. Breillat and her brave actors take us places we haven’t been… For those who believe that movies are a proper place to explore the riddle of sex, no holds barred, this movie is de rigueur. For the rest, be warned.” David Ansen, Newsweek\n\nTwelve-year-old Anaïs is fat. Her sister, fifteen-year-old Elena, is a beauty. While the girls are on vacation with their parents, Anaïs tags along as Elena explores the dreary seaside town. Elena meets Fernando, an Italian law student; he seduces her with promises of love, and the ever watchful Anaïs bears witness to the corruption of her sister’s innocence. FAT GIRL is not only a portrayal of female adolescent sexuality and the complicated bond between siblings, but also a shocking assertion by the always controversial Catherine Breillat that violent oppression exists at the core of male-female relations.\n\nPart of our series, Un Bouquet de Breillat.\n\nIn French with English subtitles.\n\n“A strange, discomfiting and fascinating film about the horrors of adolescence.” Manohla Dargis, L.A. Weekly\n\n“This is not a film softened and made innocuous by timid studio executives after ‘test screenings.’ There is a jolting surprise in discovering that this film has free will, and can end as it wants, and that its director can make her point, however brutally.” Roger Ebert\n\nThe world's #1 cat video festival is back!\n\nOscilloscope Laboratories presents CatVideoFest 2024, a compilation of the latest and best cat videos culled from countless hours of unique submissions and sourced animations, music videos, and classic internet powerhouses.\n\nEach year, across the country, local theaters partner with nearby cat-focused charities, animal welfare associations and shelters alike — a portion of ticket proceeds from every show goes directly to local cats in need.\n\n“[It’s] refreshing to be surrounded by so many feline lovers having a good time at the movies.” Ethan Shanfeld, Variety\n\n“Watching silly cat videos is good for you.” The Wall Street Journal\n\nCatherine Breillat’s behind-the-scenes account of shooting FAT GIRL stars Anne Parillaud as Breillat surrogate Jeanne, a director intent on getting her film’s most intimate sequence just right—even if it means alternately coaxing and battling her fragile, needy young actors (Grégoire Colin and Roxane Mesquida, virtually recreating her role from FAT GIRL). Once again exploring her signature obsessions, Breillat uses this metafictional format to investigate the ethical responsibilities of the artist, the messy logistics of running a set, and the slippery nature of realism, as applied to one of filmmaking’s most challenging ordeals: the simulated sex scene. Culminating in one actor’s ribald high jinks with a body prosthetic and another’s breakthrough into shattering emotional territory, SEX IS COMEDY is Breillat’s heady, brilliant synthesis of the ridiculous and the sublime.\n\nPart of our series, Un Bouquet de Breillat.\n\nIn French with English subtitles.\n\n“Breillat’s first foray into comedy is playful, whip-smart and far breezier in both tone and look than the stylized gender polemics she’s known for.” Carina Chocano, Los Angeles Times\n\n“One of the greatest movies about moviemaking… For Breillat, sex reveals the soul along with the body, baring the actors’ very sense of identity; the drama, based on her own directorial experiences, is both self-revealing and self-accusing.” Richard Brody, The New Yorker\n\nWE'LL ALWAYS GNAW WHAT YOU'RE DOING THIS SUMMER - 5th encore screening added!\n\nIn this 19th century, supernatural winter epic, a drunken applejack salesman must go from zero to hero and become North America’s greatest fur trapper by defeating hundreds of beavers.\n\nCreated by Mike Cheslik and Ryland Brickson Cole Tews, the duo behind the modern cult hit LAKE MICHIGAN MONSTER (2018).\n\n“Starts strange, gets stranger, and yet remains resolutely adorable… embraces the defiant glee of art cinema and distills it into something so thoroughly pure and sincere that it is surely hard not to fall in love with it.” Alexandra Heller-Nicholas, Alliance of Women Film Journalists\n\n“It’s sure to develop a significant cult following with its unique mix of silent-era slapstick, animation elements, theme-park-style critter costumes, and general air of inspired absurdity.” Dennis Harvey, Variety\n\n“Steroidally swollen with gags and smarts.” Guy Maddin\n\nMore than 40 years after its release, INSATIABLE remains a classic of erotic cinema and a showcase for perhaps the biggest name in the 1970s adult movies. It marked Marilyn Chambers' (BEHIND THE GREEN DOOR) return to the XXX world after failing to find a career in mainstream Hollywood, and also helped kick off the home video revolution as one of the best-selling adult films released during the early years of VHS.\n\nSandra Chase (Marilyn Chambers) is a beautiful model at the height of her career when she loses both her parents in a tragic accident. She is left with an enormous fortune and the family mansion, but she is sexually unfulfilled and tormented. Sandra searches for ways to gratify her sexual appetite by indulging in her wildest sexual fantasies. John C. Holmes, the most popular adult actor of the era, is featured in the film’s climactic scene. INSATIABLE also includes a scene with Marilyn and actor David Morris on a pool table. It was Marilyn’s favorite scene she ever filmed and ranks as one of the most erotic ever committed to celluloid.\n\nThe film will be introduced by special guest Jared Stearns, author of the biography Pure: The Sexual Revolutions of Marilyn Chambers. A Q&A will follow the screening. Copies of Stearns’ book will also be available for purchase at the screening.\n\nFor an extra taste of historical context, INSATIABLE will be presented on glorious VHS, preceded by the original trailer on 35mm!\n\n*No one under 18 admitted*\n\nInspired by director Catherine Breillat’s true life experiences, ABUSE OF WEAKNESS is an exploration of power and sex. Isabelle Huppert stars as Maud, a strong-willed filmmaker who suffers a stroke. Bedridden, but determined to pursue her latest film project, she sees Vilko (Kool Shen), a con man who swindles celebrities, on a TV talk show. Interested in him for her new film, the two meet and Maud soon finds herself falling for Vilko’s manipulative charm as their parasitic relationship hurdles out of control.\n\nPart of our series, Un Bouquet de Breillat.\n\nIn French with English subtitles.\n\n“This is a work just as startling and potent as anything [Breillat] has done to date—a powerful example of art being used to exorcise personal demons that is anchored by two stunning performances and some of the most gripping moments to be seen in any film so far this year.” Peter Sobczynski, RogerEbert.com\n\nFANTASY A GETS A MATTRESS returns to help us close out the summer season once again, exactly one year after its very first showings at the Grand Illusion!\n\nFantasy A, real-life autistic Seattle rapper, suffers trials and tribulations from total creeps as he attempts to become a superstar. After being kicked out of his group home onto the grim summer streets, Fantasy A sets off on an odyssey to achieve fame and find a good mattress to sleep on in this ensemble comedy filmed entirely on location in Seattle.\n\nThe legend himself, Fantasy A, will be present to introduce the screenings, and he and the filmmakers will also take part in post-show Q&As!\n\nFANTASY A GETS A MATTRESS captures Seattle like no other movie before it. With its bright, vivid colors and glorious cinematography, you can practically feel the city’s summer sun simmering from the screen.\n\n“…a truly original Seattle story overflowing with homegrown creativity and humor… the history of Seattle film has a new chapter that, while still being written, begins and ends with Fantasy A.” Chase Hutchinson, The Seattle Times\n\n30th anniversary! New 35mm print with director Shu Lea Cheang in attendance!\n\nFRESH KILL is a highly stylized and satirical attack on neo-liberal reality. The child of a young lesbian couple living on Staten Island mysteriously vanishes after consuming radiated fish. The battle to find the missing child and the culprits responsible for the disappearance is joined by a group of cyber-warriors. Everyone finds themselves ensnared in a vast conspiracy involving a ghost ship of nuclear refuse, ominous media messages, and deadly cat food!\n\nThis presentation is part of a 20-city road trip across America in which Shu Lea Cheang is traveling with a new 35mm print of her film, accompanied by two young filmmakers, Los Angeles-based Jean-Paul Jones and New Orleans-based Jazz Franklin. Read more about this 30th anniversary tour, the movie, the print, and the filmmakers in the official press release here.\n\nNamed one of “The 100 Greatest New York City Artworks” – Alex Greenberger, ARTnews\n\n“Fresh Kill, a celebration of multicultural diversity with as much humor as seriousness, suggests that love may be the only defense in a world whose existence is endangered by conglomerates, ever expanding and polluting the mind as well as the planet.” Kevin Thomas, The Los Angeles Times"
