On the left is Zak Penn (writer of the adaptation), and on the right is Ernest Cline (writer of the novel). I’ve read the book, and watched the movie, and I love them both.\n\nThese are two very different experiences, and if you’ve been through the book and the movie you’ll understand just how vastly different they are. This brings me to my point, as long as the heart and soul of the story transferred from the book to the movie I believe it will be a successful adaptation. A lot can change in an adaptation, scenes can be moved around, characters can be taken out or changed, a story that can be told in years can be told in weeks, etc."
