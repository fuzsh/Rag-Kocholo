        "text": "Like him or not—and I do—Wes Anderson has created a style unmistakably his own. Yet even as his trademark mannerisms almost beg to be parodied (last fall’s SNL spoof was hilariously spot-on), he’s like one of those confidence artists who’s always two steps ahead of the sheriff. Just when you think you’ve got him pinned down, he turns up working brand-new territory.\n\nAnderson’s off to inter-war Mitteleuropa in The Grand Budapest Hotel, which is by miles the best American movie so far this year. Inspired by the writings of the Austrian novelist Stefan Zweig, this ornately miniaturized historical epic made me think of a Matryoshka doll, a Fabergé egg, a child-emperor’s birthday cake, and the world’s largest, loveliest dollhouse.\n\nThe movie unfolds as a series of stories within stories: A famous writer (Tom Wilkinson) recalls his younger self (Jude Law) who tells us about his encounter with the garrulous hotelier, Zero Moustafa (F. Murray Abraham), whose saga it actually is. The action takes place in the imaginary country of Zubrowka, a fantasyland of magic mountains, fairy-tale bakeries, looming monateries, dank prisons, and grandiose mansions, all living under the shadow of impending war. At its center is the elegant Grand Budapest Hotel, a hallucinatory explosion of pinks, reds, and magentas that clings to grand traditions in an increasingly vulgar world. Nobody clings more tenaciously than the hotel’s legendary concierge, Monsieur Gustave (Ralph Fiennes), at once a stickler and a bisexual gigolo, who takes the young lobby boy, Zero (newcomer Tony Revolori), under his wing.\n\nDreaming up this vanished (albeit fictional) world has clearly fired Anderson’s imagination. He’s never made a more sheerly beautiful film. Graced with a witty and gorgeous production design—it’s never too early to start touting candidates for the 2015 Oscars!—the whole movie is magnificently overstuffed, from its romping hijinks (stolen artworks, silly chases, goofy-sinister assassins) to its teeming cast, including Tilda Swinton beneath an impasto of old-age makeup, Saorise Ronin as Zero’s pastry-shop inamorata, Ed Norton as a military man, Adrien Brody as an evil aristo, and the de rigueur cameos by the Wes Anderson Players: Bill Murray, Jason Schwartzman, and Owen Wilson. Such a lineup makes one think of Woody Allen, and this is fitting. Rather like Midnight in Paris (albeit made with incomparably greater care), The Grand Budapest Hotel is a moonlight swim in an enchanted, irretrievable past that the filmmaker obviously wishes he could have lived in, if only for a short while.\n\nAnderson’s work has always been a tug-of-war between the pleasures of childlike whimsy and an adult ruefulness about the elusiveness of love and the ravages of passing time. He’s never captured this tension more completely than in The Grand Budapest Hotel, which offers the sugar-rush joys of a confection yet (despite losing a bit of steam in the last third) winds up filling you with a surprisingly potent sense of melancholy. Its many moods come together in one of Anderson’s greatest creations, M. Gustave, played with commanding flair by Fiennes who’s been so busy barking at 007 and terrorizing Harry Potter that I’d forgotten how gifted he is at comedy. Hopscotching between charm and terror, formality and obscenity, Fiennes’s performance as the last great concierge embodies a shimmering nostalgia for Old World ways even as it makes light of them."
