        "text": "Right now Guillermo del Toro is busy with his horror film Crimson Peak, slated for release in 2015, but that doesn't mean he's not also working on a sequel to the 2013 sci-fi action bonanza Pacific Rim. BuzzFeed recent had a chat with del Toro, and he gave a quick update on the progress of the sequel. Travis Beacham wrote the original script, but this time del Toro is working with a new writer. The filmmaker said, \"I’m working very, very hard with Zak Penn. We’ve been working for a few months now in secret. We found a way to twist it around.” Well, it's not a secret now, and this news has us a little leery about the sequel.\n\nBeacham seeemed to have found the perfect mix between some B-movie elements and some serious sci-fi to make for a fun, but quality summer blockbuster. The good news is that he's not entirely uninvolved in the development of Pacific Rim 2 as del Toro says, \"Travis Beacham was involved in the storyline and now I’m writing with Zak because Travis has become a TV mogul.” Yes, Beacham is working on the Fox series \"Hieroglyph\" for the new fall season, so he's got a good reason for not being available in a bigger capacity, but that's still a bit disappointing.\n\nBut is Zak Penn really the best man for the job? He hasn't delivered many impressive screenplays, however, when it comes to creating the story (not the script), Penn has delivered the likes of Last Action Hero, X2: X-Men United and The Avengers. And while the most former of that trio was a mess of a final film, the original idea and story was brilliant. Of course, Penn has also written Elektra, Fantastic Four and X-Men: The Last Stand, all duds in their own special way, so it's hard to get truly excited about him writing a film, even if it's with someone like del Toro.\n\nBut maybe with del Toro as a guide, this will be a good team to crack the sequel for Legendary Pictures. The director said, \"I’m going for very new, very crazy ideas on the second one, which are very different from the first one — but you will get really great spectacle.” Previously, del Toro hinted at some elements they would touch upon in the sequel, \"We will have Gipsy 2.0 for sure. Second thing is you’re gonna see a merging of Kaiju and Jaeger. And that is quite special. We’ve drifted with a Kaiju brain. Well, then start riffing on that and you’ll get to something.\" Stay tuned to see what happens."
