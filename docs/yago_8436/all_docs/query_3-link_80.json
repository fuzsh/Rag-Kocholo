        "text": "If the screenwriter is usually the unappreciated stepchild on any film production, then why are Ernest Cline and Zak Penn, who wrote the script based on Cline’s sci-fi novel “Ready Player One,” so cheerful?\n\nTwo words – Steven Spielberg – is all they need to explain, though being writers, they’ve got a lot more to say about their experience working with the legendary director on the pop culture- and virtual reality-infused tale.\n\n“I’ve been saying that everything you could ever want to happen when you write your first novel has happened to me, including this film adaptation,” Cline says of the journey he and his book have taken since its publication in 2011. “Every novelist who gets their book adapted should have this experience, where they get to work with a friend of theirs” – he and Penn were friends before the project started – “who shares so many of their interests.\n\n“Then we have the greatest filmmaker of all time come on board, who is a huge collaborator, too, and brings his own enthusiasm and energy and genius to it?” he says. “It was just incredible.”\n\nAnd genuine, too, Penn adds.\n\n“One of the things that made this process special, and probably only would have happened with Steven Spielberg, it was a true collaboration,” Penn says. “Not just a ‘We’re just saying it for publicity collaboration but we actually hate each other.’ ”\n\n“Ready Player One” was a hotly anticipated book even before its publication in August 2011. A month earlier I talked with Cline at Comic-Con in San Diego where Random House had launched a big promotional campaign to target the science fiction fans, videogamers, and pop culture nerds who flocked to it then and in the years that followed.\n\nIts story might best be described as a dystopian tale with a sense of humor. It’s the year 2045, and the world is a mess, with many people choosing to spend most of their waking hours inside the OASIS, a virtual-reality universe created by the eccentric genius James Halliday (played by Mark Rylance in the film), who at his death left word he had hidden three keys that would unlock an Easter egg within the game that would grant control of the OASIS and all of Halliday’s wealth to whomever found it.\n\nProtagonist Wade Watts (Tye Sheridan) – who is known by his avatar alter-ego Parzival within the OASIS – is one of many gamers who’ve been trying for years to find the first key, and once he conquers the first challenge and wins that key, he and his band of friends, including Samantha “Sam” Cook (Olivia Cooke), or Art3mis, as she’s known in the game, are off on a race to beat an evil corporation that is also seeking to win the OASIS.\n\nCline, who had started writing the screenplay a year before the book was published, was later joined by Penn, whose credits include “X-Men: The Last Stand” and “The Incredible Hulk,” though they already had met and become friends by then, which helped immensely as they went to work transforming the novel into a screenplay.\n\n“I trusted Steven and his cinematic storytelling ability, which dwarfs mine,” Cline says. “I wanted to learn from him.”\n\nAnd from Penn, he says, who brought to the collaboration a sense of what it’s like to be a writer and have someone else revise your work beyond recognition.\n\n“I have a long history of other people treating me like crap, and I wasn’t going to do that to Ernie,” Penn says. “There’s two things that bug me. One is when people are too precious about adaptations, like, ‘Oh my god, Wolverine’s hair is four inches long!’ But the other is when people arbitrarily change things even though what’s there already works.”\n\nSo if a speech was right in the book then it more or less got copied and pasted to the screenplay, he said, like Wade’s voice-over about how his father gave him a name that sounded like a superhero’s.\n\n“So many sequences,” Cline says, then offering up a line Halliday says in the book and film alike. “Like, ‘I never felt at home in the real world because I never knew how to connect with the people.'”\n\n“Steven sent me a video of Mark Rylance reading that, saying, ‘I’d really like to say this,'” Penn says.\n\n“Oh, I didn’t know that!” Cline replies.\n\n“The point is, those are instances where it’s like, ‘OK, this works, I’m not going to change it,'” Penn says.\n\nLater, after Spielberg signed on as director, even more of the book was restored to the screenplay, they say.\n\n“There were a couple of times where I was talking to you and said, ‘I don’t think we’re going to be able to afford to do it,'” Penn says. “And then Steven Spielberg came along and he was like, ‘Forget that thinking, I can do it. Whatever it is, I can do it.'”\n\nFor instance, the Distracted Globe, a zero-gravity dance club inside the OASIS was one such set piece that was restored from the trash folder on the screenwriters’ desktops, and that kind of freedom made the collaboration, with Spielberg’s Hollywood clout at their disposal, even more rewarding.\n\n“When Steven signed on it was like, ‘I don’t have to think about that anymore,'” Penn says. “Because this guy knows whatever he tells me can be done. It’s not like I’m sitting there thinking, ‘What a fool,’ right?”\n\nAll the way down to the production designers and costumers the virtual reality of the book became the physical reality of the film production, Cline says.\n\n“I remember when I saw the costume for Aech (Lena Waithe) for the first time, and she’s wearing exactly what I described in the book, a Rush “2112” T-shirt,” he says. “And I was like, ‘Wow, that was never in any version of the script, but the costume person clearly took that detail.\n\n“It was just the best experience that a novelist could ever have,” he says.\n\n“It’s a boring story because nothing bad happened,” Penn says.\n\nAnd then they both laugh, these rare birds, the happy screenwriters."
