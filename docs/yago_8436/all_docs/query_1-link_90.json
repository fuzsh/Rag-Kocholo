        "text": "Directed by Zak Penn PG-13, 94 minutes\n\nThe German filmmaker Werner Herzog is recruited to make fun of himself in \"Incident at Loch Ness,\" a comic pseudodocumentary written and directed by Zak Penn that opens today in New York, Los Angeles and Chicago. Playing \"Werner Herzog,\" a distinguished European director living in exile in Southern California, Mr. Herzog is recruited by \"Zak Penn,\" a hustling producer, to make a documentary on the eternally elusive Loch Ness monster.\n\nAs the relentlessly optimistic Mr. Penn and the grumbling, skeptical Mr. Herzog plan their movie, their progress is recorded by a film crew, led by the cinematographer John Bailey, making a documentary to be titled \"Herzog in Wonderland.\"\n\nAnd so down the rabbit hole goes \"Incident,\" shuffling fact and fiction in a manner meant to confound and provoke. Once in Scotland, Mr. Herzog hires a local captain to take the crew out on the lake, but Mr. Penn insists on replacing the boat's engine with a smaller one that won't interfere with the sound recording. It's the first of many manipulations imposed by the producer that drive the principled Mr. Herzog to fits of disgust. By the time Mr. Penn introduces the newest member of the crew -- a \"sonar operator\" (Kitana Baker) who knows nothing about the equipment but looks very fetching in a tiny red, white and blue bikini as she struggles to operate it -- Mr. Herzog has begun to realize that the expedition will not be a dispassionate pursuit of truth.\n\nOn cue Nessie shows up, bumping the boat from below and showing tantalizing glimpses of her scaly gray posterior as she dives for the deep. The film shifts its focus at this point, from the low-key, comic improvisation of a Christopher Guest false documentary (\"Best in Show,\" \"A Mighty Wind\") to a horror movie of the \"Blair Witch Project\" school, struggling to plant the possibility that the monster is real after all."
