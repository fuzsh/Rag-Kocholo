        "text": "Natalie Kalmus was a colour supervisor in Hollywood during the 1930’s and 1940’s. Her husband was an engineer playing a key role in the creation of colour motion picture film and Natalie Kalmus was well known for being adamant about the use and purpose of colour on film. The Grand Budapest Hotel (2014) was critically acclaimed at the time of its release and often spoken about for its abundance of colour and style produced by director Wes Anderson. Within this essay I will analyse the use of colour in The Grand Budapest Hotel (Anderson, 2014) and how it compares to the theories of Natalie Kalmus’ Color Consciousness (1935).\n\nBefore delving into how colour is used, it is important to know what colours in the film are themselves commonly used to elicit certain emotions from an audience and how that develops with hue and intensity. Firstly, red can be used as a signal for love but Anderson uses it through The Grand Budapest Hotel (2014) as a sign of danger or a warning. The carpets in the hotel are all red and the lift is a bright, shocking red which both precede a murder and other violent throughout the film. Purple is the most prominent and recognised colour in the film as the staff of the hotel are all seen for the majority of the film in their purple Grand Budapest uniforms. Kalmus describes it as such: “Purple denotes solemnity, royalty, also pomp and vanity.” (Kalmus, 1935) which fits the description of the hotel perfectly. The hotel is very busy in its glory days, as it was known for its high standards and rich customers. Pomp is defined in the dictionary as “ceremony and splendid display” which the concierge, M. Gustave, prided himself on.\n\nIn Color Consciousness (1935), Natalie Kalmus writes about various colour theories, one of them being colour juxtaposition. One of the first examples of this is when first meeting Mr. Moustafa. He wears a dark blue suit jacket and red shirt while sitting in a room of warm colours such as orange and yellow. These warm tones make the suit jacket completely stand out and even make the clothing itself look much darker in comparison following Kalmus’ theory: “When any two colors are placed together, the first emphasizes in the second the characteristics which are lacking in the first.” (Kalmus, 1935). Because orange and blue are opposites on the colour wheel, Mr Moustafa’s jacket is highlighted for the audience, showing him as a person of interest in the same way he has just become of interest to the Young Writer in the film.\n\nThis trend continues throughout the film as these two characters meet for dinner. The large, almost empty dining hall they are seated in has yellow, paling walls and bright orange carpet, once again opposing the outfit of the hotels owner. The lighting of the scenes as we learn more about Mr Moustafa is very warm, making him stand out in the room. Much later in the film, he begins to speak of his beloved Agatha. When he does, this same warm lighting becomes much harsher. It drowns out the surroundings and even the Young Writer as we see Mr Moustafa begin to cry at the memory of his love. It has the same effect as the complementary colours by directing the audience to the important aspects of the frame.\n\nFollowing on from juxtaposition, colour is largely used in the film to highlight importance and purpose. Kalmus defines this as the “law of emphasis”, explaining that colour should be used for purpose, not simply because it can be used: “In the early twocolor pictures, producers sometimes thought that because a process could reproduce color, they should flaunt vivid color continually before the eyes of the audience. This often led to unnatural and disastrous results” (Kalmus, 1935). Anderson does this very well throughout the film as it is quite subtle yet consistent and effective.\n\nWhile learning more about Mr Moustafa’s life, the Young Writer is not of interest to the audience, in fact he is more like a member of it. He is purely taking in the story and information in awe like those watching the film. The Young Writer is dressed in a tweed jacket and pale shirt and tie, very neutral colours, especially when sitting across from Mr Moustafa at dinner. In his close up, his outfit does not help him to stand out, it pushes him into the background.\n\n“The law of emphasis states in part that nothing of relative unimportance in a picture shall be emphasized . . . Errors of this nature must be carefully avoided.”(Kalmus, 1935).\n\nHis tie and jacket match the wall and he blends in, matching Kalmus’ theory of only emphasising the important, which in this instance is Mr Moustafa.\n\nMoving into the earliest time period of the film, we meet Monsieur Gustave, the concierge of the hotel who takes great pride in and has devoted his life to his work and customers. He is first seen in a pastel pink hotel room before being met at the door by various staff members. Everyone wears variations of the royal purple uniform which stand out from the pink walls but blending together with the dark furniture as they work as a unit to prepare the room. However, there is a fair amount of personal space left for M. Gustave in the centre of the room which helps establish the fact he is in charge as he gives orders to the staff. In the same scene he sits across from Madame D, an elderly woman who is dressed in yellow. This is a complementary colour to purple making the scene quite pleasing to the eye while not distracting from what we learn about the characters and how they complement each other.\n\nLater in the scene the characters move to the lift. The inside is bright red and simultaneously makes the audience unable to miss the bright purple uniforms of the hotel staff while swallowing up Madame D who now wears a red coat. This scene is the only time we see Madame D as after this she is killed and M. Gustave is framed for her murder. Her being lost in the background of the frame is a way of slowly making the character less important to the audience because she needs to die to progress the story. In contrast, a young Zero Moustafa (the new lobby boy at the time) and M. Gustave are fully emphasised here, establishing their importance throughout the rest of the film because they are the only prominent things in this frame.\n\nWhile analysing the use of colour, a lack of it can be used just as effectively. Kalmus theorised that a lack of colour is unnatural for the human eye when we see everything in life in colour: “The mind strives to supply the missing chromatic sensations, just as it seeks to add the missing inflections to the actor’s voice. The monotony of black, gray, and white in comparison with color is an acknowledged fact. It is almost a psychological axiom that monotony is the enemy of interest.” (Kalmus, 1935).\n\nWhen attending the reading of Madame D’s will, M. Gustave is threatened by her son Dmitri before being punched. The audience are introduced to Dmitri in this way and it casts him in a bad light which never changes as the film progresses. Dmitri and his sidekick/threatening muscle, Jopling, are dressed in all black when we meet them while others are wearing white shirts or accessories, a lack of which, singles them out from the monotone crowd. This trend continues throughout the film and while a film’s antagonist wearing all black is expected, Dmitri being absent of all pigment in a film full to the brim with it reminds the audience that he does not fit in within Mr Moustafa’s story or the hotel itself.\n\nThe Grand Budapest Hotel and Madame D are both legally represented by Deputy Kovacs who is murdered later in the film because he refuses to corruptly help Dmitri by not investigating the documents missing from Madame D’s records. Kovacs is murdered in a museum as he tries to escape being followed. Kovacs attempts to move through the shadows to avoid being caught and as the frame gets darker the audience is given the sense that the danger is closing in on the lawyer. The black closing in on the edge of the frame is reminiscent of the outfits of Dmitri and Jopling and this is most likely on purpose as it is revealed that Jopling kills Kovacs before he can escape.\n\nWhen trying to kill M. Gustave to take his late mother’s fortune later in the film, Dmitri makes his way through The grand Budapest Hotel. The light hues of pink on the wall and bright red of the lift makes his all black ensemble truly stand out. It is made obvious to the audience that he doesn’t belong there and his presence seems to disturb the colour palette we have grown accustomed to within the hotel. The police seen throughout the film all wear grey uniforms so even when Zero and M. Gustave are trapped in the midst of a shootout, Dmitri is still made obvious and out of place in the previously peaceful and sweet resort.\n\nDeath seems to be linked to Jopling and Dmitri wherever they go, which is emphasised by the colour black throughout the film. The solid black costumes oppose the colour of the hotel and its staff uniforms and in turn, shows how Dmitri and M. Gustave oppose each other through the film. The colour black is only consistently used for Dmitri and those working for him which makes it that much more powerful and aggressive, as Kalmus described in her writing: “On the other hand, the presence of color in our picture gives added force to the neutrals, emphasizing the severity of black, the gloominess of gray, the purity of white.” (Kalmus, 1935). The use of neutral colour in the film is minimal which is why it holds such purpose when it is used.\n\nThe prison is the main setting that uses a lack of colour to cause an effect on the audience. M. Gustave is arrested for the murder of Madame D that he did not commit and spends time behind bars which is significantly more dreary and dull than any time spent at the hotel. He goes from wearing his bright purple uniform to the black and white stripes typically associated with prisoners and it makes the audience feel like part of him is stripped away with it. While he acts the same in prison and doesn’t back down from anything, it makes the audience feels uncomfortable to see the concierge lacking what they have come to expect when he is onscreen. It is a clear imbalance and lack of power that communicates the terrible situation to the audience.\n\nWhen M. Gustave and his cellmates escape the prison, he is met by his loyal Lobby Boy Zero and they need to find a way of getting back to the hotel to retrieve the painting given to M. Gustave in Madame D’s will. At this point, M. Gustave solidifies a deeper friendship with Zero and they are seen by the audience as equals This is solidified in their clothing as both are dressed in neutral colours that are a giant leap from the royal purple the audience are accustomed to and is a clear display that they are far from their posts at the hotel. Both men are lacking in a way to get back to the hotel and have to run through fields of show to bide time. This emphasises the absence of colour in the scene and how far they are from reaching the comfort of the hotel.\n\nWhen reaching a phone booth, M. Gustave calls another hotel owner for the help of The Society of the Crossed Keys, an organisation made of the hotel owners from various European hotels. At this point colour starts to slowly drip back into the film. Each hotel has its own uniform colours and a well put together colour scheme reminiscent of The Grand Budapest Hotel that starts to make the audience feel hopeful because the different hotels are made to feel safe and familiar when they are each called upon.\n\nColour fully returns to the film when our protagonists make it back to the hotel. The return of the pastel pink walls and purple uniform is sudden but welcome until the hotel seems to be over run by soldiers all dressed in grey. They block the interior view of The Grand Budapest and make the audience feel uneasy by blocking out what we expect to see: the lobby in all of its colourful glory.\n\nMy analyzation of this film has opened my eyes to a new way of emotionally influencing an audience. By using certain colours you can make an audience feel happy, endangered or at peace which Wes Anderson does extremely well with this film. “The director strives to indicate a fuller significance than is specifically shown by the action and dialog. If he can direct the theatergoer’s imagination and interest, he has fulfilled his mission.” (1935). By being able to use colour in a way that has been theorised since the beginning of colour film, Anderson has created a world that keeps an audience invested and in love.\n\nOn reflection, it feels like the hotel is the source of colour in the film. The further Zero and M. Gustave get from The Grand Budapest Hotel the more neutral colours are on screen. Over the years, the colour of the hotel deteriorates and the shades of the various decorations get darker but looking back on when he began to work there, Zero Moustafa remembers the pink walls and purple uniforms as if seeing the place with rose-coloured glasses in his old age.\n\nNatalie Kalmus’ theory gives plenty of detail about the original use of colour in Hollywood and its intentions. The various techniques I have discussed all serve plenty of purpose within this film and seem to still be relevant to audiences today because of its emotional depth. I want to consider these when making films in the future because they fully immerse the audience in the film while also giving them information to process that does not need to be explained or shown to them in a separate action.\n\nBibliography\n\nBellantoni, P. 2005.
