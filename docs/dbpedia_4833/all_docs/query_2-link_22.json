        "text": "Amy FeiereiselChateaugay Lake joins other ADK lakes using herbicide to fight Eurasian milfoil\n\nRecent headlines in the Adirondacks about Eurasian milfoil and a chemical herbicide called ProcellaCOR have been centered around Lake George, where a state agency and local group have battled the use of the chemical herbicide for years.\n\nBut several other Adirondack lakes have already used that herbicide, and they've done so with public support.\n\nThe same day Lake George's permits to apply ProcellaCOR were approved, a permit for Chateaugay Lake, near Lyon Mountain, was also given the go-ahead. That community has been battling milfoil since 2007.\n\nMilfoil comes to Chateaugay Lake\n\nRight next to the hamlet of Lyon Mountain is Chateauguay Lake, which is fed from the Adirondack foothills.\n\nUpper Chateaugay Lake is connected to Lower Chateaugay Lake by a four-mile channel called 'The Narrows'. Altogether, the lake is about 3000 acres, and popular with locals and visitors for boating, canoeing, and kayaking.\n\nAnd like many popular Adirondack lakes, it has a Eurasian water milfoil problem.\n\n\"In many places of the lake, it's affected people's waterfront. So where they used to be able to swim in front of their camp, it's no longer pleasant to swim,\" said Mary Johnson, the President of the Chateaugay Lake Foundation, standing at the edge of the lake's boat launch area. \"You can get your prop entangled with milfoil so that you have to stop and clear your prop.\"\n\nJohnson started the Chateaugay Lake Foundation in 2007 to combat the spread of Eurasian milfoil, the invasive aquatic plant that grows in thick mats at the top of water bodies, crowding out native species and reducing fish habitat.\n\nJohnson grew up in this area, and her parents had a camp on Chateaugay Lake; Johnson does too.\n\nShe remembers the first time she heard about milfoil at a public meeting held by the Adirondack Park Agency in 2003.\n\n\"And I remember thinking well, I'm really glad we don't have that on Chateaugay Lake!\" said Johnson. \"And that summer, I noticed these strands washing up that looked an awful lot like milfoil, and sure enough, it was.\"\n\nJohnson says the location of the lake, between Lake Champlain and the St. Lawrence River, makes it particularly vulnerable to invasive species brought in on watercraft.\n\nJust a few years later, the lake’s boat launch was infested with milfoil. \"It was clogged out in front of this boat launch. It was clogged around the sandbar where people go from here to spend the day.\"\n\nThe boat launch and sandbar are both located in ‘The Narrows’, which connects the Upper and Lower parts of the lake.\n\nIn 2006, about 200 acres of the lake were infested with milfoil, up from 40 acres in 2002.\n\nWinning battles, losing the war\n\nIn 2007, Johnson and other volunteers launched a formal lake control program, with high hopes of eradicating milfoil from Chateaugay Lake.\n\nA study by the Adirondack Watershed Institute at Paul Smith's College estimated they’d need $1.5 million dollars to do the whole lake. Johnson says they couldn’t afford that, so they started with high-traffic areas.\n\n\"We began with hand harvesting by scuba divers and laying benthic mats at the boat launch where we're here today, which was the location where the milfoil was first positively identified,\" said Johnson. \"Over the subsequent years we had hoped to be able to expand the hand harvesting to encompass more of the shoreline. But we found that we have had to repeatedly hand harvest the same areas over and over.\"\n\nInstead of expanding the work, they had to keep returning to the same areas. And they could only afford to do so much.\n\n\"It's quite expensive. A three person team of divers costs 7500 a week,\" said Johnson. \"So it is just not economically feasible for us to expand our program to the extent that would be needed to really bring the milfoil under control.\"\n\nWith the money the Chateaugay Lake Foundation collects from local donors, in mostly small dollar donations, they’ve been able to pay for about six weeks of hand harvesting per year, which costs $42,000.\n\nAccess to state or federal grants has been limited, because most grant money for Eurasian milfoil is earmarked for prevention or eradication of small, new infestations. But that’s not an option for Chateaugay Lake, which has a longstanding infestation that Johnson says goes back to the 1970s.\n\nSeventeen field seasons in, despite a lot of work and money, the amount of milfoil in the lake has nearly tripled since 2007, to just under 700 infested acres.\n\nA new tactic in the form of ProcellaCOR\n\nJohnson says it’s disheartening to spend money and not see results.\n\n\"You know, people are very concerned about getting it under control,\" said Johnson, \"and frustrated with the progress of the hand harvesting, because it's not able to do enough, fast enough.\"\n\nThat’s why, on Friday, June 28th, Chateaugay Lake got its first dose ProcellaCOR, a chemical herbicide designed to kill Eurasian water milfoil. It joined about a half dozen other Adirondack Lakes, including Minerva Lake, Lake Luzerne, Brant Lake, and recently, Lake George.\n\nMinerva Lake, which used the herbicide in 2020, has seen significant success, with almost total dieback of milfoil, and very little regrowth over the last three years.\n\nChateauguay Lake is bigger and more infested, so this first treatment of 95 acres will be followed by more treatments in subsequent years. ProcellaCOR is recommended to be applied to milfoil early in the summer season, so this will be the only treatment in 2024, explained Johnson.\n\n\"It's not a permanent solution. Eventually you have to re-treat, and we would plan to extend the period of that by checking and reharvesting where we see regrowth so that we can extend the period between treatments,\" said Johnson. \"But we do think that it will help us and be more cost effective.\"\n\nJohnson says this treatment will cost about $80,000 and kill 95 acres of milfoil.\n\nHow the herbicide works\n\nProcellaCOR works by mimicking a plant hormone specific to milfoil. \"It causes the plant to grow so rapidly, the stems elongate, the stems collapse and the plant dies,\" said Johnson.\n\nShe watched a small boat out on the lake, driving back and forth, applying the ProcellaCOR through water hoses at the surface of the lake.\n\nGlenn Sullivan was driving the boat, he's a biologist and has worked in lake management for over 30 years, including applying herbicides and algacides. Sullivan treated Minerva Lake in 2020, and treated six lakes this year in the Adirondacks with ProcellaCOR.\n\nSullivan has a camp in North Creek and mostly works in upstate New York, but has gone as far afield as Western New York and Ontario, Canada. He explained how he applies the herbicide, using a big tank on the bottom of his boat.\n\n\"So I'll mix it [the herbicide] in the tank, and then when I'm ready, I'll draw out of the tank and out the side nozzles,\" said Sullivan. He draws water in from the lake, it mixes with the herbicide, and then it goes back out into the lake, onto the mats of milfoil he's targeting.\n\nHe has an iPad with a map of the milfoil sites, \"so I can follow that. An usually in big sites like this, I'll break it up into sections so that I know that 5 gallons goes in this section, 5 gallons goes in that section,\" said Sullivan.\n\nHe made a note of how watered down the ProcellaCOR is when it goes into the lake, at about six parts per billion. That's one of the reasons Sullivan likes this herbicide.\n\nHe says that compared to other herbicides, \"it's used at a much lower dose than most of the aquatic ones. A lot of people were using Renovate [another chemical herbicide] before this. In fact Loon Lake and Lake Luzerne in the Adirondacks used to use Renovate...and you use it at about 2000 parts per billion. And this we're using about six parts per billion. So it's dramatically different.\"\n\nWeighing unknown versus known risks\n\nProcellaCOR has been registered and deemed safe for plants, wildlife, and humans by the EPA, the European Union, and the Canadian Government, where it was actually the third herbicide ever approved there.\n\n\"As an aquatic herbicide it's researched far more than most common chemicals,\" said Sullivan. \"And researched with current technology, whereas a lot of the products that are on the market have been researched 20-30 years ago. So you have the ability to know a lot more about the product now than you certainly did before.\"\n\nThe argument made against the herbicide is that it’s relatively new, and you can’t predict what unforeseen consequences might arise from its use.\n\nIt’s important to note that locally, the public is in favor of use of the herbicide on Chateaugay Lake. As part of the permit application, the Adirondack Park Agency collected public comment from residents. 132 people wrote letters, and 120 of those letters were in favor of using the herbicide.\n\nJohnson says that’s because of a lot of public education and strategy meetings.\n\n\"We have good support from the local community. You know, we try to get out there to explain what we're doing, and why it's important,\" said Johnson. \"But you know, more and more people are recognizing the problem of invasive species and as they see it spread along the shoreline and in front of their camps, they get even more motivated.\"\n\nMary Johnson says she and other volunteer board members of the Chateaugay Lake Foundation know there is a certain risk of potential side effects with ProcellaCOR, but also says that they have to weigh the potential effects of ProcellaCOR against the certain impacts of Eurasian milfoil on the lake.\n\n\"I think that there's a lack of recognition of the negative effects of allowing invasive aquatic plants to take over your water body,\" said Johnson. \"Because it's bad for the health of the lake, it's bad for oxygen exchange. It's bad for the native plants, the native fish and the waterfowl.\"\n\nJohnson also said that while their hand harvesting efforts have certainly had an impact - who knows how much larger the problem might be if not for that work - the fact is, that method has failed in controlling the spread of milfoil, from 40 acres in 2002, to nearly 700 acres in the latest study.\n\nShe's hoping this summer, using ProcellaCOR will allow them to get ahead of milfoil for the first time in seventeen years."
