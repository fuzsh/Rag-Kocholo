        "text": "Biography\n\nThe son and grandson of Panamanian jockeys, Braulio Baeza began his career in his native land at age 15 and won 309 races there in 1959 at the age of 19. The following year, Baeza moved to the United States and quickly became recognized as an elite rider.\n\nBaeza went to Miami in March of 1960 and worked two horses for Fred Hooper, who offered to make Baeza a contract rider. Baeza won on his first mount at Keeneland that year and went on to be the top money-winning rider in North America from 1965 through 1969. He won the George Woolf Memorial Jockey Award in 1968 and the Eclipse Award for Outstanding Jockey in 1972 and 1975.\n\nBaeza rode a total of 24 champions during his career, including nine Hall of Famers: Buckpasser, Dr. Fager, Arts and Letters, Susan’s Girl, Ack Ack, Foolish Pleasure, Affectionately, Damascus, and Gallant Bloom.\n\nIn 1963, Baeza won the Kentucky Derby aboard Chateaugay, and he won the Belmont in 1961 (Sherluck), 1963 (Chateaugay), and 1969 (Arts and Letters). His 1969 Belmont win deniedwarted Majestic Prince’s bid for the Triple Crown.\n\nIn 1972, Baeza was aboard Roberto when he dealt Brigadier Gerard his only career defeat at York Racecourse in England. Other major wins for Baeza included five editions of the Hopeful Stakes and Champagne Stakes; four runnings of the Travers, Woodward, and Saratoga Special; and three renewals of the Blue Grass, Jockey Club Gold Cup, and Suburban.\n\nBaeza won 3,140 races in the United States and 873 in Panama for a lifetime total of 4,013. He retired during the Saratoga meet in 1976 because making weight became too difficult.\n\nBraulio Baeza was inducted into the National Museum of Racing’s Hall of Fame in 1976.\n\nAchievements\n\nEclipse Award for Outstanding Jockey — 1972, 1975\n\nNorth America's leading rider in earnings — 1965, 1966, 1967, 1968, 1975\n\nTriple Crown Highlights\n\nWon the 1963 Kentucky Derby — Chateaugay\n\nWon the 1961 Belmont Stakes — Sherluck\n\nWon the 1963 Belmont Stakes — Chateaugay\n\nWon the 1969 Belmont Stakes — Arts and Letters\n\nOther Highlights\n\nWon the Hopeful Stakes — 1964, 1965, 1967, 1969, 1974\n\nWon the Champagne Stakes — 1964, 1965, 1966, 1967, 1975\n\nWon the Saratoga Special Stakes — 1963, 1965, 1967, 1968\n\nWon the Woodward Stakes — 1965, 1966, 1969, 1972\n\nWon the Travers Stakes — 1966, 1969, 1972, 1975\n\nWon the Blue Grass Stakes — 1961, 1963, 1976\n\nWon the Jockey Club Gold Cup — 1965, 1966, 1969\n\nWon the Suburban Handicap — 1967, 1968, 1973"
