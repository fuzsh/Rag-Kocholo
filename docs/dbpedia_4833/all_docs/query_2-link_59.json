        "text": "The couple wanted to take photos on the dock, which is somewhat unstable, so the groom was helping the bride walk out to the end. I snapped this photo as a beautiful ray of sunlight illuminated them through storm clouds that were rolling in.\n\nMelissa and Bear live in Chicago and work in the film industry. They got engaged in the spring and decided to plan a small wedding over Labor Day weekend at the groom's family camp in the Adirondacks of Upstate New York. The original plan was to have a COVID-compliant wedding with 30 something people in attendance, but they had to downsize to just a handful of people and dogs due to travel restrictions.\n\nThe day started with the bride getting ready in one of the small cabins that are part of the camp on Lake Chateaugay. The guys were out boating and returned a bit soggy after a sudden downpour. The skies cleared just in time for the wedding ceremony. The couple got married on a boulder at the lake's edge in front of 7 close family members and their two dogs. It was a beautiful intimate ceremony where everyone had a role to play. The groom's father officiated, there were dog handlers and an adult flower girl. The bride's close family friend drove through the night from Illinois to surprise her and walk her down the aisle (or woodland pathway as it were).\n\nAfter the ceremony, they got to catch up with friends that had been watching via zoom and then we took photos all around the beautiful property. It was a wonderful intimate low-key wedding full of fresh air and beautiful views!"
