        "text": "POTSDAM, NY (05/27/2011)(readMedia)-- Three SUNY Potsdam students were recently honored with the prestigious Chancellor's Award for Student Excellence, one of the highest academic honors that a State University of New York student can receive.\n\nSUNY Chancellor Nancy L. Zimpher presented the awards in a ceremony at the Empire State Plaza Convention Center in Albany on April 5. The chancellor presented 249 students with the 2011 award.\n\nThe SUNY Potsdam students receiving the 2011 Chancellor's Award for Student Excellence included Joseph Bernier of Chateaugay, N.Y.\n\nJoseph Bernier is an anthropology major at SUNY Potsdam and actively involved on and off campus. While an undergraduate at the College, he was the leadership and events coordinator in the Office of Campus Life and a member of the Alumni Association Board of Trustees representing Emerging Leaders.\n\nBernier has also conducted, presented and published original research in anthropology and acted as student representative of the Northeastern Anthropological Association. While on campus, he was an active member of a number of clubs on campus, including LGBTA, SGA, Political Student Association, and the planning committee for Out at the Movies. Bernier was also a member of CariDanco, SUNY Potsdam's CaribFunk Dance Company where he was a dancer and research assistant.\n\nOver the course of his undergraduate career, Bernier was the recipient of the Pete Baker Award, I. Thomas Stone Award and the Student Affairs Award, and has participated in on and off campus internships, which include a marketing and outreach internship with the SUNY Potsdam Center for Undergraduate Research, video internship with SUNY Potsdam's Honors Program, events internship with the Human Rights Campaign in Washington, D.C., and development internship with Lambda Legal in New York City.\n\nThe other two SUNY Potsdam recipients were Travis Crickard of St. John's, New Labrador, Canada, and Justin Moniz of Lake Ronkonkoma, N.Y.\n\n\"The students we honor today have excelled academically and taken advantage of what SUNY has to offer in and outside the classroom,\" said Chancellor Zimpher. \"These students are proven leaders, athletes, artists, community servants, and much more. They represent the future of our state and are perfect examples of The Power of SUNY. I congratulate all of the students receiving recognition today and thank them for the positive impact each of them has had on SUNY and the communities we serve.\"\n\nThe Chancellor's Award for Student Excellence was created 14 years ago to recognize students who have best demonstrated, and have been recognized for, the integration of academic excellence with accomplishments in the areas of leadership, athletics, community service, creative and performing arts, or career achievement. The average grade point average (GPA) for all recipients this year was 3.8.\n\nEach year, campus presidents establish a selection committee, which reviews exemplary students. Nominees are then forwarded to the Chancellor's Office and are subject to a second round of review. Finalists are then recommended to the Chancellor to become recipients of the award. Each recipient receives a framed certificate and medallion, which is traditionally worn at Commencement.\n\nFor more information about the many achievements of SUNY Potsdam's students, visit www.potsdam.edu/newsandevents.\n\nFounded in 1816, and located on the outskirts of the beautiful Adirondack Park, The State University of New York at Potsdam is one of America's first 50 colleges. SUNY Potsdam currently enrolls approximately 4,350 undergraduate and graduate students. Home to the world-renowned Crane School of Music, SUNY Potsdam is known for its handcrafted education, challenging liberal arts and sciences core, excellence in teacher training and leadership in the performing and visual arts.\n\n-www.potsdam.edu-"
