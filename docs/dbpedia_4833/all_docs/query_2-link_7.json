        "text": "Assemblyman Jones Announces 2022 Women of Distinction Awards\n\nAssemblyman Billy Jones (D-Chateaugay Lake) announced that nominations for his 2022 Women of Distinction Awards are underway. The Women of Distinction Awards are held annually and honor local women who have had significant positive impacts on their community and those around them. Awards will be given for various categories, such as health care, business, volunteer work, education and military service. The deadline for nominations is March 31, and the awards ceremony will be held on Thursday, April 28 at 6 p.m. at Stafford Center Theatre.\n\n“March is Women’s History Month, and one of the best ways we can celebrate it is by honoring inspirational and influential women here in our own backyard,” Assemblyman Jones said. “The North Country is home to a great deal of brave, hardworking women who make their communities a better place for those who live there, and I’m happy to have this opportunity to show them the recognition they deserve.”\n\nResidents who wish to nominate a woman for the awards can fill out a nomination form online at https://nyassembly.gov/mem/Billy-Jones/story/100952. Nominees must live in the 115th Assembly District, which includes all of Clinton and Franklin counties and a portion of St. Lawrence County.\n\nLast year’s Women of Distinction awards winners were: Tammy Reynolds, in the Health Care category; Amy Kretser, for the Nonprofit Leadership category; Michele Friedman, for the Education category; Diana Wardell, for the Volunteerism category; Constance Willie, for the Trailblazer category; Mary Theresa Pearl, for the Military category; and Joelle Lamica, for the Community/Civic Affairs category."
