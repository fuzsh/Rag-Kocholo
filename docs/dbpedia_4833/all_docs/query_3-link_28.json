The rocks left behind (shale and sandstone) after the glaciers melted underlie the area and are defining characteristics of the Tug Hill Plateau region. According to the New York State Tug Hill Commission, Tug Hill's elevation and position in respect to Lake Ontario results in lake effect snowfall exceeding 200 inches annually, making the area well known for its winter activities.\n\nOriginally utilized by early settlers for timber and farm land, Chateaugay State Forest's many rock walls can still be easily seen throughout the woods. In fact, it is believed that many of the stone walls that remain in this forest were built by Vic and George Waggoner of Orwell, who were known for their walls and stone bridges in the surrounding area. Many of the older walls were built in the early-to-mid 1800s and are still in great condition today. As you walk or ski the trails of Chateaugay Forest, you may notice the incredible stonework scattered throughout the forest."
