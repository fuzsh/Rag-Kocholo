        "text": "After sitting vacant for four years, the former Chateaugay Correctional Facility, a state prison in northern Franklin County, sold at a public auction yesterday.\n\nA Canadian-owned company called Adar Investment Incorporated bought the property for $600,000. State officials say the company plans to convert the facility into a Jewish summer camp.\n\nThe state closed Chateaugay Correctional Facility back in 2014 because of declining inmate populations and budget constraints. About 100 jobs were relocated – away from an area that has struggled economically.\n\nLocal officials, residents and corrections officers fought that decision. They argued the medium-security prison was an important economic engine for the area.\n\nState officials have been hoping a new employer would buy the facility, with its 30 buildings at the center of the town.\n\n“141 is the high bid. Lot of real estate, a lot of buildings,” said auctioneer Tom Pohl at Chateaugay Town Hall. There were nine bidders and the minimum bid of $100,000 kept ticking up until representatives from Adar Investment were the last ones standing.\n\n“No other bids? 600,000 takes it. Thank you,” Pohl said.\n\nThe winners declined to speak with North Country Public Radio.\n\nOne of the people in the room was State Assemblyman Billy Jones. He’s from Chateaugay, he’s a former corrections officer, and he was one of the people fighting to keep the prison open. He said the sale is bittersweet.\n\n“We fought to keep that facility open because we thought it was useful for New York State Corrections. There were jobs there. It was a rehabilitative place for incarcerated and parolee individuals,” Jones said. “And now hopefully we can move on and make this property a success and part of the town and hopefully help the local economy here.”\n\nJones added that he was surprised the property sold for as much as it did.\n\nFranklin County legislator Paul Maroun said he was “excited” about the sale. Asked if a summer camp will have the kind of economic impact he was hoping for, he said, “it’s better than nothing.”\n\n“It may not be 100 jobs, and it may not be the salaries that the state of New York paid, but there will be jobs. I don’t know if they’ll bring all their own people in or they may hire some local, but it’s certainly going to put some additional money into the economy of Chateaugay and northern Franklin County,” Maroun said.\n\nThere has also been talk of starting a Jewish summer camp at another former state prison, Camp Gabriels near Saranac Lake. That plan has been in limbo for years. It’s unclear how the sale of Chateaugay Correctional might affect that project, if at all."
