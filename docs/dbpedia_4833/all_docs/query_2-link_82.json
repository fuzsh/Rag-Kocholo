In addition, they teach on a regular basis as well as develop programs and classroom materials.\n\nBecause of their love of teaching and in an effort to help individuals with a literacy issue, they have given more than 3,000 hours in office and tutoring time over the past 5 years.\n\nOUR BOARD\n\nCVLC has a board of five volunteers drawn from the community who serve a two-year term. It consists of the President, the Vice-President, the Treasurer, the Secretary and a General Officer. They oversee all activities and expenditures and plan for future projects. We have one member who is our \"historical memory\" having volunteered with CVLC in a variety of positions for the past 15 years.\n\nLITERACY IN CANADA, ​2003 -2006\n\nPROPORTION OF ADULT PROSE LITERACY AT LEVEL 2 AND BELOW - AGE 16 AND OLDER\n\nOUR HISTORY\n\nCVLC started in the early 1980's as a home-based activity helping adults in the Chateauguay area learn to read and write.\n\nThe majority of people involved as volunteers are women.\n\nOver the years it grew to involve many people in Chateauguay, Kahnawake, and the Valley.\n\nIn 1989 CVLC was awarded a grant from the Quebec Ministry of Education to sustain and increase its activities.\n\nAt its outset, CVLC adopted the Laubach Vision for one-on-one tutoring for literacy learners.\n\nIt now prides itself as the only community organization in Chateauguay that deals with English-speaking clients who need support in literacy and literacy-type activities.\n\nCVLC : CHATEAUGUAY VALLEY LITERACY COUNCIL\n\nAlphabétisation de Chateauguay Valley\n\n450-698-0342 / [email protected]\n\n​WEEKLY HAPPENINGS\n\nGrant from the Ministry of Education (PACTE) / Registered Canadian Charity: BN89060019RR0001 / NEQ: 1149638158"
