        "text": "Slew’s Tiz Whiz Earns Second\n\nHorse of the Year Title\n\nA complete list of winners and photos follow below\n\nSlew’s Crew Racing’s multiple stakes winner Slew’s Tiz Whiz was named Washington’s top racehorse for the second year in a row at the 2023 Washington Thoroughbred Annual Awards dinner, held Saturday, February 24 at Emerald Downs.\n\nA crowd of over 200 Thoroughbred horsemen and fans gathered for a festive and celebratory evening which also featured spirited live and dessert auctions, a silent auction and a raffle where the top prize was a big screen television.\n\nIn addition, Slew’s Tiz Whiz, a now six-year-old gelding by Slew’s Tiznow bred by the late Karl Krieg, earned titles of Champion Sprinter and Handicap Horse. He is trained by Tom Wenzel.\n\nEarning her third state title was Petra Lewin (Rainbow Meadows Farm) and trainer Charles Essex’s homebred star Blazingbellablu. Crowned Washington Horse of Year as a three-year-old in 2021, the now six-year-old daughter of Grazen has earned Champion Older Filly or Mare titles in 2022 and 2023.\n\nGold Coast Racing III’s Freightline was named Champion Two-year-old Colt or Gelding and overall champion juvenile runner. The son of Coast Guard out of 2009 Washington champion juvenile filly Knight Raider was bred by Nina Hagen and Holly Sturgeon and is trained by Steve Bullock.\n\nJeff Cissell’s Special Diva earned the juvenile filly title. The daughter of Misremembered was bred in partnership by Connie Belshay and Mel and Lori Mellick. She was one of two 2023 state champions trained by Vince Gibson.\n\nThree-year-old honors were divided between champion gelding Company’s Dream, a son of Jersey Town also trained by Gibson, owned by Gary and Deborah Lusk and bred by Joseph DiPietro; and 2022 Washington Two-year-old Filly Champion Miss Dynamic, a daughter of Dynamic Impact who races for her owner/breeder Antonio Mendoza and is trained by Rigoberto Velasquez.\n\n2020 Horse of the Year Bodenheimer earned his second Champion Turf Horse title for Kristin Boice and Marylou Holden. The now six-year-old Atta Boy Roy gelding was bred by Larry Romaine and is trained by Valorie Lund, who also conditioned his sire Atta Boy Roy to a trio of Washington champion titles.\n\nPlater of the Year honors went to California-based Angela M. Aquino’s Holyjazz with Gary Alsquith and America’s Pastime Stables’ My Harbors Dream being named Most Improved Plater after finishing his racing career in New York and now being turned out before starting his second career as an Off-The-Track Thoroughbred (OTTB).\n\nNowlookatme, who competes under the name of Skyloh, was named the top OTTB by points earned through The Jockey Club Thoroughbred Incentive Program (T.I.P.). Ridden and owned by 16-year-old Emily Bigham, the 15-year-old Delineator gelding was bred by Jerry and Peggy Woods. Bigham, who has owned Skyloh for just over a year, competes in the junior jumpers division.\n\nSpecial Racetrack Achievement Awards were given to rider Jose Zunino, trainer Justin Evans and Emerald Downs race starter Mark Gibson.\n\nAlso acknowledged with a Special Recognition Award were Wes Petree and Cy Labar, who have ably served in the Emerald Downs Television Department for over 20 years.\n\nThe Mark Kaufman Media Award went to retiring Daily Racing Form correspondent Randy Goulding.\n\nFor the third year in a row. Blue Ribbon Farm’s Conveyance was named Sire of the Year, while Ron and Nina Hagen’s Moscow Symphony, a first and second generation multiple stakes producer, was named Broodmare of the Year.\n\nThe Hagens (El Dorado Farms) were also named Breeders of the Year for the seventh time and John Parker, who was the state’s TOBA Award winner in 2022 and has led the Emerald Downs’ owner standings for six years (by wins), was honored as Owner of the Year.\n\nParker proved very competitive in all the evening auctions, including taking back the opportunity – in a heated battle with Debbie Pabst – to regain “ownership” of the Super Table for next year’s celebratory banquet.\n\nAlso on the evening’s agenda was the announcement of the 2024 Washington Racing Hall of Fame inductees. This year’s inductees are: Flag de Lune (Filly or Mare), Basil Frazier (Jockey), Jon White (Media) and Junior Coffey (Lifetime Achievement). The induction ceremonies will be held next August at Emerald Downs.\n\nThe 2023 Stallion Season Auction drawings for those seasons generously donated (and purchased) were won by Mo Forza (Rancho San Miguel, California) and Tapwrit (Gainesway Farm, Kentucky).\n\nMention must also be made of Zabracadabra’s accomplishments last year, The now seven-year-old Harbor the Gold gelding, who races on the East Coast for Frank Sample and was among the older horse finalists, was Washington-bred top earner with $160,150 of his $367,348 total earned in 2023. The WTBOA Sales graduate, who was bred in partnership by Ken Miles and Sheridan Jones, also earned the highest Beyer figure (100) of any Washington-bred runner in 2023.\n\nA huge thank you and kudos go to all the many category sponsors, those who donated and bid for items in the raffles and auctions, and all the many others who worked to make this celebration of Washington horse racing so successful.\n\nAnd again, congratulations to all the evening’s winners and nominees.\n\nRichard Wright Memorial\n\n2023 Horse of the Year\n\nSLEW’S TIZ WHIZ\n\nScatter Creek Training Center\n\n2023 Champion Older Horse or Gelding\n\nSLEW’S TIZ WHIZ\n\nDuane Weber Insurance 2023 Champion Sprinter\n\nSLEW’S TIZ WHIZ\n\n(5YO G., Slew’s Tiznow—Ros’s Girl, by Rosberg)\n\nOwner: Slew’s Crew Racing (Roy & Tammy Brewer,\n\nTerry & Mary Lou Griffin, Jodee Snyder\n\nand Tom & Melissa Wenzel)\n\nBreeder: Karl Krieg (K D Thoroughbreds)\n\nTrainer: Tom Wenzel\n\n2023 Race Record 4 2-1-1 $83,000\n\nStakes: Governor’s S.
