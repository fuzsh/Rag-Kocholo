        "text": "3.1 General Information\n\nFaculty scholarships and awards are made by the individual Faculty Scholarships Committees, and students should consult the appropriate section of this Calendar for regulations and information concerning these awards.\n\nMost undergraduate scholarships and awards are granted on the basis of the combined GPA for the Fall and Winter terms and applications are not required unless specifically indicated in the terms of an award.\n\nTo be considered for in-course awards and/or the renewal of entrance scholarships, students must complete at least 27 graded credits in the regular academic year exclusive of courses completed under the Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory option. Summer courses are not considered. Courses taken at other Quebec universities through the Inter-University Transfer Agreement may be counted towards the requirements for scholarship renewal or for consideration for other academic awards. Eligibility will be based on all courses taken during the regular academic year and on both the McGill GPA as well as the global GPA which will include the IUT credits.\n\nTo receive full payment of an award, students must be registered as full-time (i.e., at least 12 credits per term) in a McGill undergraduate degree program for the entire academic year; otherwise, the award, or part of it, may be cancelled. For instance, a student who is registered full-time for only one-half of the academic year will receive only one-half of the value of the award.\n\nA maximum of the top 10% of the students in each faculty based on the combined GPA for the Fall and Winter terms are named to the Dean's Honour List. This designation, while carrying no monetary reward, is an official University recognition of the student's achievements and is recorded on the transcript. Outstanding students, who rank in a maximum of the top 5% of their faculties, may also be considered for the J.W. McConnell and James McGill Awards which range in value from $500 to $5,000. These awards are made by the University Committee on Scholarships and Student Aid to top students as ranked and recommended by each faculty. In making such recommendations, faculties may consider program content, number of credits, etc. in addition to GPA.\n\nA maximum of the top 10% of the graduating students in each faculty are named to the Dean's Honour List. This honorary designation is based upon the cumulative academic record and the minimum required CGPA is determined annually by each individual faculty. Individual faculties should be consulted regarding any additional criteria which may be used. These designations may be withdrawn, in the case of transfer students, if their CGPA in another faculty or at another university is not comparable to the CGPA earned in the current faculty.\n\nAll awards, with the exception of prizes, are credited to the tuition fee accounts of students for the following academic year. Awards made to students who do not return to McGill the following year are considered relinquished. However, students who pursue studies at another university for credit towards a McGill degree may be granted permission to retain their scholarships and/or awards for a maximum of one academic year away from McGill. Students holding renewable scholarships granted by the University Committee on Scholarships and Student Aid will be eligible for renewal if they meet the McGill standards for renewal, i.e., the equivalent of a 3.50 on the combined GPA for the Fall and Winter terms and at least 27 graded credits. Students who have relinquished their awards may,\n\nupon their return to McGill, request reinstatement. Students making such request should be sure that the Scholarships Office receives a copy of the letter of readmission.\n\nInquiries concerning undergraduate scholarships should be referred to the Scholarships Office in the James Administration Building.\n\n3.2 Open to Students in Most Faculties\n\nTHERE ARE NO APPLICATIONS FOR THESE AWARDS EXCEPT FOR THE MCENTYRE RESEARCH AWARD.
