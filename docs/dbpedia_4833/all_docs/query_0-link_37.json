        "text": "May 11, 1918, was the 44th running of the Kentucky Derby. Without the benefit of a single prep race, he hadn’t raced in 9 ½ months, Exterminator shocked the world by winning the Derby over a muddy track. He beat seven others, including the favorite, War Cloud. The Kentucky bred paid $61.20 to win. It was to be the beginning of a long, illustrious career for the colt.\n\n“Who is it laughs at years that flow?\n\nWho is it always gets the dough?\n\nWhose only creed is go and go?\n\nExterminator.”\n\nThe above verse, part of a short poem titled “Old Bones,” was affectionately written by Guy McGee and published in the Daily Racing Form in 1922.\n\nApril 17, 1933, Keeneland Association filed for Articles of Incorporation. Hal Price Headley was elected President of the Keeneland Association, a position he would hold until 1951.\n\nIn November 1933, the Kentucky Association disbanded, sold the track’s grandstand, clubhouse, and demolished the stables. Due to financial difficulties, the 65 acre Lexington club disbanded 107 years after it began, to make way for the construction of a federal low-cost housing project. Keeneland’s front gatehouses with initials K.A. are among the few known markers leftover from the historic track.\n\nHorse Racing in Central Kentucky and Jefferson County; Marjorie Rieser University of Louisville\n\nFebruary 9, 1957, the colt Round Table was the focal point of one of the most memorable sales in thoroughbred history. Shortly before the 5th race at Hialeah, with a hand shake, A.B. “Bull” Hancock Jr., sold Round Table to Oklahoma Oilman Travis M. Kerr for $175,000 a bargain for Kerr but Bull kept 20% interest as a stallion.\n\nRacelens by Philip von Borries\n\nFebruary 28, 1957, Johnny Longden became the first jockey to win 5,000 races. In 1956 he had become thoroughbred racing’s winningest rider, breaking the record of 4,870 wins by British jockey Sir Gordon Richards (1904–1988). Longden, who was called “The Pumper” by his fellow jockeys because of his riding style, rode many of the day’s great thoroughbreds. In 1943, he captured the U.S. Triple Crown aboard Count Fleet. Longden’s sculptured bust, along with busts of fellow jockeys William Shoemaker and Laffit Pincay, has been placed in the paddock area at Santa Anita Racetrack. Video"
