        "text": "SARANAC LAKE – Steve Tyrell, president of North Country Community College, announced to the college community the names of the two students receiving the Chancellor’s Award for Student Excellence.\n\nThis award is the highest honor bestowed upon a student by the State University of New York.\n\nCourtney Boyea and Jedediah Brown are this year’s recipients of this distinction.\n\nBoyea is the daughter of Stephen and Anne Boyea of Chateaugay. In May, Courtney will earn her Associate of Science degree in math and science. She represents the college as a member of the soccer, basketball, and softball teams and is the captain of the soccer team. As an active resident hall advisor, Boyea has developed programs to engage and promote the wellness of students. She is the recipient of NCCC’s Outstanding Math award and the North Country Scholar of Promise award. In addition she has been honored by Rotarians for providing Service above Self. As a volunteer, she shares her energy and time with youth during NCCC’s Kids Night Out.\n\nBrown, of Saranac Lake, is the son of Geoff Brown and Janet Hulbert of Kearney, Missouri.\n\nHe is receiving his Associate of Science in wilderness recreation leadership as well as an Associate of Arts in liberal arts and science. He is a member of Phi Theta Kappa International Honor Society. At NCCC, he tutors students in psychology courses and is a member of the Environmental Club. He also serves on the Wilderness Recreation Leadership Advisory Board. In the community, Brown volunteers with the state Department of Environmental Conservation and the Dewey Mountain Recreation Center and is a certified wilderness first responder. An avid hiker and cyclist, he has hiked the eastern High Peaks of the Adirondacks and is a certified bicycle tour leader.\n\n“Both of these students understand the importance of community and civic responsibilities at the college and in the community,” Tyrell said. “The college community is very pleased to see them succeed.”\n\nThe recipients of this prestigious award were honored by Nancy Zimpher, chancellor of the State University of New York, in a formal ceremony held on April 2 in Albany."
