        "text": "The High Falls on the Chateaugay River impressed us with its three- or four-tiered 120ft drop as it progressively fanned out the further it dropped.\n\nSince we decided to drive from Ottawa, Ontario, Canada to Albany, New York as part of our Adirondacks leg of the trip, we thought this was a pretty convenient excursion.\n\nIt was the very first thing we did after re-entering the US through the Cornwall border station.\n\nWith this section of the Northern Adirondacks fairly developed with rural farmlands, the High Falls felt like it was in a pocket of nature amidst these agricultural developments.\n\nThat said, this waterfall was privately run so we had to pay a very modest $2 per person entrance fee (as of October 2013) before making our visit.\n\nExperiencing the High Falls on the Chateaugay River\n\nAfter paying our fee (and letting our daughter finish playing with the local dog Chelsea), we walked out the back of the welcome center and into what looked like a little putting course.\n\nThen, we proceeded onto the short trail to the base where we encountered a fork in the trail.\n\nGoing right at this fork led towards the top of the High Falls on the Chateaugay River.\n\nHowever, it didn’t look like this path was really meant for visitor traffic as there wasn’t much of a view of the waterfall from there.\n\nThe going got a little rougher and steeper the closer to the falls we got.\n\nBut by the time we made it to the end of this spur, we noticed from here that High Falls was actually regulated as there looked to be some dam infrastructure just upstream of the drop of the falls.\n\nBack at the trail junction, we then took the left fork, where the trail skirted part of what looked to be a fairly large RV park before the trail went downhill.\n\nTowards the end of the initial long-stepped descent, we were able to get a look at the impressive High Falls in full context (including hints of the dam infrastructure upstream of it).\n\nAfter getting our fill of this initial look at the falls, we then followed a narrower trail.\n\nIt initially skirted some cliffs before descending some narrow wooden steps headed right down to the plunge pool of the falls.\n\nGiven the steepness of the terrain and how high up the stairs were compared to some parts of the underlying cliff, we definitely felt that our $2 admission was a fair price.\n\nAfter all, we had to consider how much harder (and more dangerous) the trail would have been without these stairs.\n\nWe also had to be wary of some poison ivy overgrowth onto the narrow stairs.\n\nOnce we were at the base of the stairs, there was a bench that allowed us to take in the High Falls from across the plunge pool.\n\nThere was also additional remnants of hydro infrastructure on the far left side of the plunge pool, which further reinforced to us how this waterfall might have served a purpose before becoming a tourist attraction.\n\nIn addition, we noticed some side light from the early morning sun during our visit, which didn’t quite fully penetrate the shadowy falls.\n\nAs a result, I’d imagine that this might be more of an early afternoon waterfall if we were seeking the best possible natural light for photos.\n\nOverall, we spent a little over an hour doing both the hike and the photographing.\n\nOn the way back up, Julie and Tahia went straight to the playground at the entrance of the RV park, which was our daughter’s reward for being able to do this hike with us without a child carrier.\n\nAuthorities"
