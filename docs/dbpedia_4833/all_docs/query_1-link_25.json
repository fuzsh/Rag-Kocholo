        "text": "History:\n\n1997 Kentucky Derby and Preakness winner Silver Charm was bred in Florida by Mary Lou Wootton. Owned by Robert and Beverley Lewis and trained by Bob Baffert, he leaped to a juvenile stakes win in the 1996 Del Mar Futurity (G2) ridden by David Flores, then hit the 1997 Derby trail with his San Vicente (G3) win, Chris McCarron up. The Kentucky Derby began Silver Charm’s partnership with jockey Gary Stevens. In a thrilling finish they prevailed over Captain Bodgit and Free House. A repeat performance in the Preakness raised Triple Crown hopes and Silver Charm ran a heroic Belmont, but he was edged out by Touch Gold. Silver Charm was awarded the 1997 Three Year Old Male Championship. In 1998, teamed with Stevens, he won the San Fernando (G2), Strub (G2) and prestigious Dubai World Cup (G1), Kentucky Cup Classic (3) and Goodwood (G2). A close second in the 1998 Breeders’ Cup Classic and win in the Clark (G2) rounded out this superlative campaign. At five, Silver Charm won the San Pasqual (G2). In his 24 starts he achieved 12 wins, 7 seconds and 2 thirds for $6,944,369. He entered stud in 2000 at Three Chimneys in Kentucky, was relocated in 2005 to Japan and stood at JBBA’s Stallion Stations until 2014. Silver Charm was inducted into the Racing Hall of Fame in 2007. In December 2014 he retired to Old Friends thanks to the cooperative efforts of JBBA, the Lewis family and Three Chimneys. Statement from the Lewis Family: “The Robert and Beverly Lewis family are thrilled and proud to have Silver Charm returning to America and beginning his retirement at Old Friends Equine in Georgetown, Kentucky. The racing thrills and excitement that he brought to our lives will never be forgotten. Winner of the 1997 Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes, the 1998 Dubai World Cup and numerous other graded stakes, Silver Charm demonstrated amazing heart and competitiveness during his four-year racing career. His 2007 induction into the Thoroughbred Racing Hall of Fame was proper recognition of his great career on the track.\n\nWe extend our gratitude to J.B. and Kevin McKathen, who spotted him as a two-year old in Florida, Bob Baffert, who so capably trained him, Gary Stevens, who rode him to his greatest victories, Rudy, his groom, who cared for Silver Charm wherever he went, Three Chimney’s Robert Clay and Dan Rosenburg, who managed his U.S. stud career, the Japan Bloodhorse Breeders Association, who managed his Japanese stud career, Case Clay, who was instrumental in assuring his return home, and Michael Blowen, who was steadfast in his determination to see Silver Charm, one day, residing at Old Friends.\n\nWe hope that thoroughbred racing fans from around the world will enjoy visiting Old Friends and saying “Hello” one of America’s great race horses!” Share sheet info – click here.
