        "text": "The New York State Education Department awarded $34 million in Universal Prekindergarten (UPK) Expansion Grants to 64 school districts across the state, Commissioner Betty A. Rosa announced today. The grants will enable districts to establish new full-day prekindergarten placements or to convert existing placements from half- to full-day.\n\nRegents Chancellor Lester W. Young, Jr. said, \"When children enroll in high-quality and effective PreK programs, they gain a significant advantage in early skills that prepare them for success in elementary school. Expanding access to full-day PreK programs through these grants will help more of New York’s children succeed.\"\n\nCommissioner Rosa said, “When we provide equitable opportunities for children in their early years, they reap the benefits throughout their lives. The Department is deeply committed to providing a strong educational foundation to every single child in New York – because that is what each of them deserves.”\n\nAll public-school districts in New York State were eligible to apply for this competitive grant opportunity. Grants were awarded based upon a district’s plan to serve a community’s highest need schools and students; the level of existing prekindergarten services; the extent to which a district planned to maximize the total number of eligible four-year-old children served in its programs; and other factors. Awarded school districts will be able to operate a 180-day program during the 2024-2025 school year.\n\nThe following school districts were awarded funding under the grant program:\n\nUniversal Prekindergarten (UPK) Expansion Grant Awards School District Award Amount\n\nAlbany City School District\n\n$1,265,442\n\nBelfast Center School District\n\n$43,206\n\nBrewster Central School District\n\n$900,000\n\nBuffalo City School District\n\n$2,500,000\n\nCambridge Central School District\n\n$310,000\n\nChateaugay Central School District\n\n$161,930\n\nClifton-Fine Central School District\n\n$120,000\n\nCortland Enlarged City School District\n\n$67,322\n\nCuba-Rushford Central School District\n\n$162,719\n\nDeposit Central School District\n\n$264,000\n\nDryden Central School District\n\n$191,543\n\nEast Ramapo Central School District\n\n$2,498,848\n\nEast Syracuse Minoa School District\n\n$465,175\n\nElba Central School District\n\n$130,000\n\nEllicottville Central School District\n\n$311,400\n\nEvans-Brant (Lake Shore) Central School District\n\n$180,000\n\nFabius Pompey Central School District\n\n$180,000\n\nFarmingdale Union Free School District\n\n$919,800\n\nFlorida Union Free School District\n\n$210,000\n\nFrontier Central School District\n\n$519,551\n\nFulton City School District\n\n$917,065\n\nGananda Central School District\n\n$434,230\n\nGarden City Union Free School District\n\n$2,390,000\n\nGuilderland Central School District\n\n$800,000\n\nHamburg Central School District\n\n$180,000\n\nHaverstraw Stony Point Central School District\n\n$2,454,359\n\nHendrick Hudson Central School District\n\n$590,000\n\nHeuvelton Central School District\n\n$224,748\n\nHudson City School District\n\n$200,000\n\nIroquois Central School District\n\n$360,000\n\nLiberty Central School District\n\n$221,908\n\nLisbon Central School District\n\n$203,349\n\nLivonia Central School District\n\n$356,622\n\nMalverne Union Free School District\n\n$470,000\n\nMechanicville City School District\n\n$180,000\n\nMedina Central School District\n\n$494,269\n\nMerrick Union Free School District\n\n$360,000\n\nMilford Central School District\n\n$83,417\n\nOnondaga Central School District\n\n$180,000\n\nOnteora Central School District\n\n$167,900\n\nOyster Bay & East Norwich Central School District\n\n$660,000\n\nPlainview-Old Bethpage Central School District\n\n$360,000\n\nPoland Central School District\n\n$400,000\n\nQueensbury Union Free School District\n\n$194,000\n\nRiverhead Central School District\n\n$1,000,581\n\nRockville Centre Union Free School District\n\n$360,000\n\nRoxbury Central School District\n\n$100,000\n\nRoyalton-Hartland Central School District\n\n$436,404\n\nRush-Henrietta Central School District\n\n$544,756\n\nSaranac Lake Central School District\n\n$402,300\n\nSeaford Union Free School District\n\n$720,000\n\nSherrill City School District\n\n$839,076\n\nSouthwestern at Jamestown Central School District\n\n$114,173\n\nSpringville-Griffith Institute Central School District\n\n$330,000\n\nStarpoint Central School District\n\n$1,213,528\n\nSyosset Central School District\n\n$910,000\n\nTiconderoga Central School District\n\n$267,681\n\nTioga Central School District\n\n$130,000\n\nWashingtonville Central School District\n\n$82,909\n\nWebster Central School District\n\n$1,204,300\n\nWest Canada Valley Central School District\n\n$210,249\n\nWest Irondequoit Central School District\n\n$540,000\n\nWheatland-Chili Central School District\n\n$99,297\n\nYork Central School District\n\n$272,000"
