        "text": "Palm Beach, Fla.\n\nCody’s Wish, at once the feel-good story and heartbreaking saga of the past two seasons, was honored as the 2023 horse of the year Thursday night at the 53rd annual Eclipse Awards at The Breakers.\n\n“Can’t and quit was two words we never used,” said Kelly Dorman, the father of Cody Dorman, the late inspiration for the horse’s name. “We never will. You think that horse can’t talk, but he can. And he won’t use those two words either.”\n\nDorman was crying as he spoke about the now-retired horse.\n\n“You’ll never hear Tom Hanks say there’s no crying in horse racing,” he said.\n\nThe Cody’s Wish story reached a heartbreaking climax the weekend of the Breeders’ Cup when Cody Dorman died after a lifelong battle with a rare genetic disorder. Only 17, he passed away on the flight home from California to Kentucky the day after he watched his namesake win a second consecutive Dirt Mile.\n\nAlso named the top older dirt male, Cody’s Wish drew 134 first-place votes for horse of the year from the media and racing-industry representatives who decided the champions. White Abarrio got 37, Idiomatic 21, Up to the Mark 9, Arcangelo 6, Auguste Rodin 6, Elite Power 5 and Practical Move 1.\n\nSeventeen championships were announced Thursday night in a two-hour ceremony that was televised by FanDuel TV and hosted by Acacia Clément, Britney Eurton and Nick Luck.\n\nThese were the winners of the other 16 awards:\n\nOlder male: Cody’s Wish. Grade 1 scores in the Churchill Downs, the Met Mile and the Breeders’ Cup Dirt Mile were on this division champion’s résumé. This was the third different horse trained by Bill Mott who won an award Thursday.\n\nOlder female: Idiomatic. The winner of eight races in nine starts finished her durable year with three Grade 1 triumphs, including the Breeders’ Cup Distaff.\n\n3-year-old male: Arcangelo. The colt who propelled Jena Antonucci to become the first female trainer of a U.S. classic winner parlayed that Belmont Stakes triumph into a Travers (G1) win and, with all that, the division championship.\n\n3-year-old filly: Pretty Mischievous. A win in the Kentucky Oaks was the first of three Grade 1 triumphs last year for the newly crowned champion.\n\nOwner and breeder: Godolphin won its seventh owner Eclipse and its third consecutive award as the top breeder. The global operation is owned by its founder Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al Maktoum.\n\nJockey: Irad Ortiz Jr. Make it five Eclipse Awards in the last six years for Ortiz, whose 366 wins led all U.S. and Canada riders.\n\nTurf female: Inspiral. Despite having only one run in North America in 2023, that victory in the Breeders’ Cup Filly & Mare Turf was good enough to make the U.K.-based daughter of Frankel an Eclipse winner.\n\nTurf male: Up to the Mark. The three-time Grade 1 victor and Breeders’ Cup Turf runner-up gave Mike Repole his second win of the night and his partner Vinnie Viola his first.\n\nTrainer: Bill Mott. Having finalists in three Eclipse Award categories propelled Mott, 70, to his fourth victory in this category. He previously won in 1995, 1996 and 2011.\n\nFemale sprinter: Goodnight Olive. Thanks to her victory in the Breeders’ Cup Filly & Mare Sprint, she got the nod for the second year in a row despite a loss to Echo Zulu in the Ballerina Handicap (G1).\n\nMale sprinter: Elite Power. It was the second year consecutive Eclipse Award in this category for the two-time Breeders’ Cup Sprint winner.\n\n2-year-old male: Fierceness. The Breeders’ Cup Juvenile winner won the award, giving owner Repole his third victory in the category, following Uncle Mo in 2010 and Forte in 2022.\n\n2-year-old filly: Just F Y I, already a two-time Grade 1 winner, carried her 3-for-3 year to the Eclipse Award.\n\nApprentice jockey. Axel Concepcion of Puerto Rico won the award after winning 206 races and $5.5 million purse money in 2023.\n\nSteeplechase horse: Merry Maker, the upset victor in the Lonesome Glory at Aqueduct, was named the champion in this category.\n\nHorseplayer of the year.
