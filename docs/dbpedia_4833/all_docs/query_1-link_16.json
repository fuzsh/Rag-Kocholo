        "text": "With earnings close to $4 million, this Standardbred paced his way into the hearts of horse racing fans with his grit, good looks, longevity and wicked kick.\n\nWon the West, bred in New Jersey, was purchased for $35,000, a price that seems like a bargain in retrospect. The talented gelding began his career as a three-year-old in 2007.\n\nUnder the guidance of Hall of Fame trainer Ron Burke, he hit the track pacing, winning multiple stakes races that year, including the prestigious American-National Stakes, where he defeated older, more experienced horses. Won the West was known for his “wicked kick,” showing explosive speed to win very competitive races.\n\nRace after race and year after year, Won the West improved. In 2009 and 2010, his wins included the Dan Patch Invitational, Molson Pace, Quillen Memorial, and back to back victories in the Breeders’ Crown Open Pace, one of the most important races for Pacers in North America.\n\nIn his 2009 Breeders’ Crown win, he paced a stakes-record 1:47, one of the fastest miles ever recorded. He was named the U.S. Champion Older Pacer aged four and up for both 2009 and 2010. His 1:47 mile was the fastest Breeders’ Crown paced mile of all time. The record still stands today.\n\nAs a seven-year-old, Won The West paced Canada’s fastest mile ever, winning the Mohawk Gold Cup in 1:47.2. He retired at age eight, the third-richest pacer of all time, with $3.9 million in earnings.\n\nWon The West retired with 36 wins, 24 seconds, and 15 thirds from 109 lifetime starts."
