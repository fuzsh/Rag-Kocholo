        "text": "Alysheba\n\nAlysheba overcame a breathing problem early in his career, then brought his athleticism and dogged determination to 12 different race tracks, winning 2/3rds of the Triple Crown, the Breeders’ Cup Classic, three Eclipse Awards and a place in the Thoroughbred Racing Hall of Fame.\n\nWith over $6.6 million, Alysheba led the all-time earnings list until he was passed by Cigar (a future stablemate in the Hall of Champions) in 1996.\n\nInitially retired to stud at Lane’s End Farm in Kentucky, Alysheba was sold to interests in Saudi Arabia in 1999. He returned to the United States as a resident of the Hall of Champions in 2008."
