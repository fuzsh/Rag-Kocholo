        "text": "British Columbia’s racing and breeding community were out in force this week to celebrate the best of the 2023 Hastings’ racing season.\n\nThe event was again a near sell-out, with around 200 horsemen and women gathering at Vancouver’s popular Italian Cultural Centre.\n\nThere were no surprises in the Horse of the Year category, with the magnificent racemare INFINITE PATIENCE (Sungold – Montero, by Louis Quatorze) once again taking both BC-bred and Open Horse-of-the-Year crowns, as well as both BC-bred and Open divisions of the Older Filly/Mare category. It was the fourth time the now seven-year-old mare had been named Open Horse of the Year. The only time in her racing career she did not win the trophy was in 2020 when she only raced three times, all at Woodbine.\n\nBred by Bill DeCoursey who owns with NHL hockey star Ryan Nugent-Hopkins and trained by Barbara Anderson-Heads, Infinite Patience added to her impressive totals in 2023 with four wins in five races including the $100,000 Ballerina Stakes and $100,000 Northlands Distaff at Century Mile in Alberta. Infinite Patience is a finalist for Champion Older Mare/Main Track for the April 18 Sovereign Awards, honouring champions in Canada.\n\nIn her career, Infinite Patience has won 19 of 25 races, 17 stakes and over $595,974.\n\nFans of the remarkable mare may also be delighted to hear that, according to her breeder and part-owner Bill DeCoursey, she is back in training at Hastings ahead of a 2024 campaign.\n\nAnother double winner on the night was AT ATTENTION, the year’s Champion Older Horse and BC-bred Older Horse, for Bryan and Carol Anderson. The son of Shanghai Bobby won the BC Cup Classic and was second in three stakes including the Grade 3 Premier’s Handicap.\n\nAs well as the horses, there were awards for leading owners, breeders, trainers, riders, and backstretch staff, as well as the induction to the B.C. Thoroughbred Hall of Fame of Ron and Rae Fawcett of Tod Mountain Thoroughbreds, owner Terry Sangara and racing writer, Randy Goulding.\n\nThe evening was hosted in typically smooth style by Hastings’ track announcer Dan Juckic and paddock analyst Mike Heads, with the New Stride Thoroughbred Adoption Society once again on hand to raise money through the sale of 50-50 tickets, the auction of a limited-edition racing print of the legends John Henry and Bill Shoemaker, as well as a porcelain bowl depicting racing scenes.\n\nAppropriately, there were standing ovations for the recipients of two special awards on the night. Trainer Patricia Jarvis received the prestigious Richard Yates Backstretch Award, while the HBPA Diamond Award, which is reserved for particularly deserving candidates in recognition of their invaluable commitment to the sport of horse racing in British Columbia and beyond, was presented to Darlene Smith.\n\nThe New Stride 50-50 prize capped quite an evening for Eugene Chan, whose table of fellow owners was still busy celebrating after their filly LIZZIE’S RAYNE was crowned two-year-old filly of the year when he realized he had the winning ticket!\n\nChampion Older Male, Open Division: AT ATTENTION\n\nOwner: Dr. Bryan C. and Carol Anderson\n\nTrainer: Barbara Anderson-Heads\n\nBreeder: Bryan Anderson & Carol Anderson\n\nChampion Older Male, B.C.
