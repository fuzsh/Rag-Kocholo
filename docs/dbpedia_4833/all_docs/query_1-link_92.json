        "text": "The 1970s was a golden era for thoroughbred racing. There were three Triple Crown winners – immortals Secretariat, Seattle Slew, and Affirmed – as well as numerous other superstars such as Riva Ridge, Ruffian, and Spectacular Bid, among many others. No discussion of American racing from that distinguished decade, however, could be had without lavish praise for the exceptional Forego, who arrived on the scene in 1973 and was still winning races five years later.\n\nA three-time Horse of the Year and winner of eight Eclipse Awards, Forego was undeniably one of the most accomplished and popular horses of his era. The Grade 1 Forego Stakes will be run in his honor for the 41st time this Saturday at Saratoga Race Course.\n\nFoaled at Claiborne Farm near Paris, Ky., Forego was a bay gelding by Forli out of the Hasty Road mare Lady Golconda. He was bred and owned by Martha F. Gerry’s Lazy F Ranch.\n\nForego arrived at the races as a 3-year-old in 1973. He won the Roamer and Discovery handicaps that year, finished fourth in Secretariat’s Kentucky Derby, and posted an overall record of 9-3-3 from 18 starts with earnings of $188,909. Secretariat was off to the breeding shed the following year when Forego came into his own, winning Eclipse Awards for Horse of the Year, Champion Older Male, and Sprint Horse.\n\nForego’s wins in 1974 included the Woodward Stakes, Brooklyn Handicap, Widener Handicap, Don Handicap, Carter Handicap, Gulfstream Park Handicap, Vosburgh Handicap, and Jockey Club Gold Cup. He carried 131 pounds to victory in the Vosburgh that year, winning for the first of 13 races in which he carried 130 pounds or more.\n\nAs a 5-year-old in 1975, Forego was again named Horse of the Year. His victories included the Woodward, Brooklyn, Widener and Carter for the second consecutive year, as well as the Suburban and Seminole handicaps. In the Brooklyn, Forego set a track record of 1:59? for 11/4 miles under 132 pounds while giving the runner-up 23 pounds.\n\nIn 1976, Forego won five times under 130 pounds or more, including a 137-pound impost when he defeated Honest Pleasure by a head in the Marlboro Cup. His wins that year included his third score in both the Woodward and Brooklyn, as well as wins in the Metropolitan and Nassau County handicaps. With a record of 6-1-1 from eight starts and earnings of $491,701, Forego was named Horse of the Year for the third consecutive year.\n\nAs a 7-year-old in 1977, Forego won the Woodward for the fourth consecutive year and repeated in the Metropolitan and Nassau County handicaps. Forego’s fourth Woodward victory was his 14th and final Grade 1 win. He also won his fourth straight Eclipse Award for Champion Older Male.\n\nForego raced twice as an 8-year-old in 1978, winning once, before he was retired with a career record of 34-9-7 from 57 starts and earnings of $1,938,957. Twenty-four of his wins were in stakes races. Trained by Hall of Famers Sherrill Ward and then Frank Whiteley, Jr., Forego was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1979.\n\n“He did it all, under crushing weights, over different distances, against the best of various generations, and under the most adverse physical conditions,” said the Daily Racing Form. “He defined greatness.”\n\nFollowing his retirement, Forego spent time at John Ward’s farm near Keeneland Race Course in Lexington, Ky., before being moved to the Kentucky Horse Park in 1981. He lived there until he died in 1997 at the age of 27."
