I was awarded NYSPHSAA Section 10 East Co-MVP and I was a finalist for the Patti Baldwin award (a memorial award with finalists chosen by officials).\n\nI have two years of past club experience playing for Seaway Smash VBC, and I will be on the 17U team this season.\n\nI plan to major in Communication Sciences and Disorders to become a Speech- Language Pathologist. I have been on the Honor Roll every quarter since middle school, and I have been on National Junior Honor Society for 2 years, and National Honor Society for 3 years. I am the secretary of Chateaugay’s Athletic Association, as well as the secretary of National Honor Society. I am also a member of my school’s LEAD Team, Science Olympiad, and French Club."
