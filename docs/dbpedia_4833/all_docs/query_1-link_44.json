        "text": "Skip Away, one of Florida's most successful thoroughbreds, died Friday of an apparent heart attack at Hopewell Farm in Kentucky.\n\nThe three-time Eclipse Award winner and 1998 Horse of the Year was 17 years old.\n\nBred by Anna Marie Barnhart, the son of Skip Trail won nearly $10 million in purses and is third on the list of all-time money earners in North America.\n\nFor Carolyn Hine, who raced the colt along with her late husband Hubert \"Sonny\" Hine, the news was devastating.\n\n\"When my husband died, it cracked my heart, and now that Skippy died this morning, my heart is broken,\" Hine said from her South Florida home.\n\nHine was not involved with thoroughbreds until she married Sonny, who was a trainer.\n\nShe once told her husband she wanted a white horse.\n\nSonny Hine had to inform her that white thoroughbreds are extremely rare.\n\nBut he found the next best thing, a grey colt.\n\nThe horse was entered in the Ocala Breeders' Sales 2-year-old sale at Calder Race Course in 1995.\n\nThe young colt was calm despite the busy, unfamiliar surroundings of the sale grounds.\n\n\"I stood there petting his head and talking to him. He was very kind,\" Hine said. \"When we walked away, I said to Sonny, 'I want this horse.' \"\n\nThey bought him for $30,000, but X-rays later showed he had a chip in his ankle.\n\nThe sale was completed after $7,500, the cost of the surgery to remove the chip, was knocked off the final price.\n\nThe surgery was never done.\n\nAs a 3-year-old, Skip Away began to shine.\n\nHe won the Toyota Blue Grass Stakes (G2) at Keeneland, but did not run well in the 1996 Kentucky Derby, finishing 12th.\n\nHe came back to finish second in that year's Preakness and Belmont stakes. He also beat the mighty Cigar in the Jockey Club Gold Cup (G1) at Santa Anita Park.\n\nHe won the Woodbine Million (G1) and the Haskell Invitational Handicap (G1) that year on his way to his first Eclipse Award as champion 3-year-old male.\n\nSkip Away got better with age, and followed up his 3-year-old campaign with champion older horse honors at 4 and again at 5 years old in 1998.\n\nIn 1998, he also was named Horse of the Year after winning five grade 1 stakes races.\n\nHe retired with total earnings of $9,616,360 and was inducted into the U.S. National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame in 2004.\n\nHe stood for a $10,000 stud fee in Kentucky and had produced 20 stakes winners in his career as a sire.\n\nCarolyn Hine always felt a special connection to the horse.\n\n\"Sonny would tell me, 'You're not really supposed to love a horse like you do.' But it was a true love affair,\" she said. \"We never had children, we never had a honeymoon or a vacation. The horses were our entire life, and Skippy was like a child to me.\"\n\nShe last saw Skip Away two years ago, and had not been able to visit because of two knee reconstruction surgeries.\n\n\"I was in rehabilitation for three months and the hospital for a month,\" Hine said. \"I would look out the window and talk to Sonny and ask him to help me get better so I could go see Skippy again. I was going to go see him again this summer, but he couldn't wait for me.\"\n\nSonny Hine, who passed away in 2000, trained Skip Away to his 18 wins in 38 races.\n\nHe was inducted in the Hall of Fame in 2003. Carolyn Hine retreated from racing for several years after her husband's death, but eventually returned and still owns horses.\n\n\"I was blessed,\" Hine said. \"My husband and I loved the horses, loved the business and were deeply in love. Skip Away was the product of all that love.\""
