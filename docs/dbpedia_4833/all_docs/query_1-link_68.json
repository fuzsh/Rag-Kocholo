        "text": "The Breeders’ Cup is a unique event for horse racing that can see the world’s fastest horses compete year after year in a slew of events.\n\nThis means a horse can win the same event one year, and win it again the following year, and even win it again the next year.\n\nGoldikova, a champion Thoroughbred from France, actually won the same race three times at the Breeders’ Cup. In 2008, 2009 and 2010, Goldikova won the Breeders’ Cup Mile races and is the only horse to do so.\n\nIn fact, since 1984 when the Breeders’ Cup ran its first races, 20 horses have won more than one Breeders’ Cup race.\n\nThis includes National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame Thoroughbred, Tiznow, who raced and beat the best horses in the world in the Breeders’ Cup Classic – twice.\n\nAnd these weren’t easy wins to come by.\n\nThe field at the 2000 Breeders’ Cup, which was held at Churchill Downs, included several contenders including Kentucky Derby winner Fusaichi Pegasus, Belmont Stakes winner Lemon Drop Kid, Irish champion Giant’s Causeway, and Jockey Club Gold Cup winner Albert the Great.\n\nDespite the stiff competition and a surging Giant’s Causeway, Tiznow was able to hold off Giant’s Causeway in the homestretch to win by a neck.\n\nTiznow, recognized as the Eclipse Awards Horse of the Year and champion three-year-old in 2000, entered the 2001 Breeders’ Cup Classic against Jockey Club Gold Cup winner Aptitude, Prix de l’Arc de Triomphe winner Sakhee, and Epsom and Irish Derbies winner Galileo.\n\nDue to the competition, Tiznow was expected to take fourth in the race, but he made his move on the final turn to give fans another heart-pounding Classic at the Breeders’ Cup. In the final stretch, Tiznow outraced Albert the Great and lunged past Sakhee to capture victory by just a nose.\n\nBoth the 2000 and 2001 exciting races became major milestones for Tiznow and memorable finishes for the Breeders’ Cup Classic. Both races are also voted as the National Thoroughbred Racing Association Moment of the Year.\n\nThis year’s Breeders’ Cup will be held Nov. 6 and Nov. 7. The field is made up of strong contenders to win the Classic, but none who are able to match Tiznow’s accomplishment.\n\nThis year’s race includes the American Champion Three-Year-Old Male Horse of 2019 Maximum Security, Kentucky Derby winner and Preakness Stakes runner-up Authentic, Belmont Stakes and Travers Stakes winner Tiz the Law, and more."
