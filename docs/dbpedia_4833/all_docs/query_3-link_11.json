        "text": "Project updates\n\nUpdate regarding the repowering efforts at the Chateaugay wind project\n\nSince AES took over operations in 2021, we have been committed to ensuring the sustained operation of our North Country wind projects. We understand the importance of these projects to the local communities and AES is committed to maximizing the project’s benefits while respecting the region's character.\n\nThe Chateaugay wind project has been an economic driver in the North Country for the past 15 years, providing significant benefits such as job creation, municipal payments, and support for local property owners and businesses. As part of our commitment to the region, AES plans to extend the life of the project for up to an additional 30 years, ensuring continued local benefits for generations to come. As a trusted partner, AES has the expertise and experience to execute a thoughtful and responsible repowering process.\n\nAES’ environmental and engineering experts have determined that a full repowering is the best way to ensure the Chateaugay wind project’s continued operation. This process will require the removal of the existing turbines and the installation of new, state-of-the-art technology. Over the next year, AES will continue to finalize designs and conduct necessary field studies. At this time, we anticipate the repowered Chateaugay wind project will likely be comprised of 19 to 25 turbines.\n\nWith these updates, we want to assure you that AES remains committed to:\n\nContinued close collaboration with the Chateaugay community, County leadership and area stakeholders throughout the repowering process\n\nCritical revenue streams from agreements like taxes, new PILOTs, and HCA agreements, providing continued revenue to the community\n\nThoughtfully and responsibly designed repowered projects that fit into and complement the community landscape,\n\nContinued employment for on-site operations staff, as well as future employment opportunities during construction of the repower.\n\nWe believe that a full repower will have long term benefits for the town of Chateaugay. maximizing its potential to deliver clean energy and economic benefits to the North Country. Thank you for your continued support and partnership as we work towards a sustainable future together.\n\nAs important members of the community, we want to hear from you. All questions and comments can be directed to our team by phone or email:\n\n866-757-7697\n\nChateaugaywind@aes.com\n\nOctober 24, 2023\n\nThe New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) has awarded AES ten wind and solar projects across New York state totaling 1.2 GW of renewable energy generation under a large-scale renewables Request for Proposals (RFP). AES is thrilled to announce that Chateaugay Wind received an award.\n\nGovernor's Office Press Release\n\nAES Press Advisory\n\nThis webpage is being updated to reflect the current project status and timeline.\n\nSeptember 27, 2023\n\nThe Office of Renewable Energy Siting [ORES] issued the jurisdictional determination that all six Valcour projects, including Chateaugay Wind, must receive a siting permit pursuant to Executive Law 94-c. Click here for the full Declaratory Ruling.\n\nRepowering Update: AES purchased the Valcour Portfolio of wind projects, including Chateaugay Wind, intending to repower them. Originally, AES planned to replace essential components to extend the life of the existing towers - extending the benefits for landowners, the towns, and school districts for up to 30 years following the repower. However, comprehensive engineering and environmental assessments revealed that the wind parks and their beneficiaries will benefit from a more substantial repowering effort than initially anticipated. AES will continue to post information about the repower on this project webpage.\n\nIf you have any questions, please contact us by phone or email:"
