        "text": "In a year in which Triple Crown race winners took a backseat to older horses, Gun Runner was the expected, and worthy, recipient of the 2017 Eclipse Award for Horse of the Year. He ran in six races and won five of them, finishing second in the Dubai World Cup, earning nearly $7 million. His racing career will conclude this Saturday as the favorite in the $16 million Pegasus World Cup at Gulfstream Park, and he'll stand as a stallion at Three Chimneys Farm in Kentucky.\n\nNone of the winners of the three Triple Crown races--Always Dreaming, Cloud Computing, and Tapwrit--received an Eclipse Award, and only Always Dreaming was a finalist, for three-year-old male.\n\nAmong the most popular winners of the night was Lady Eli, the champion turf female. Undefeated in six races as a two- and three-year-old, she suffered a hoof injury in July of 2015, an injury that threatened not only her career, but her life. After more than a year away from the races, she returned to run in eight more races, winning four of them, finishing second in two others. She was recently retired to begin a career as a broodmare, and in accepting her Eclipse Award, co-owner Jay Hanley said that his champion mare can serve as a \"model of strength, a beacon of hope. She survived, she overcame all odds, and so can you.\"\n\nAlso recognized Thursday night were Kelley Stobie and Shelley Gagnon-Blodgett of Caribbean Thoroughbred Aftercare, who have worked tirelessly since September to aid horses affected by Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria, the latter of which devastated the racing population in Puerto Rico. In partnership with a variety of racing entities, Stobie and Gagnon-Blodgett spearheaded efforts to rescue horses in Puerto Rico and ship them to new homes in the United States.\n\nThe rest of the evening's winners:\n\nFemale sprinter: Unique Bella\n\nMale sprinter: Roy H\n\nBreeder: Clearsky\n\nSteeplechase horse: Scorpiancer\n\nOwner: Juddmonte\n\nFemale Turf Horse: Lady Eli\n\nMale Turf Horse: World Approval\n\nApprentice jockey: Evin Roman\n\nJockey: Jos√© Ortiz\n\nTrainer: Chad Brown\n\nHorseplayer of the Year: Ray Arsenault\n\nOlder Dirt Female: Forever Unbridled\n\nOlder Dirt Male: Gun Runner\n\nEclipse Award of Merit: Frank Stronach, founder of The Stronach Group, owner of Gulfstream Park, Laurel Park, Pimlico, and Santa Anita, among other racing entities\n\nThree-year-old filly: Abel Tasman\n\nThree-year-old male: West Coast\n\nTwo-year-old colt: Good Magic\n\nTwo-year-old filly: Caledonian Road"
