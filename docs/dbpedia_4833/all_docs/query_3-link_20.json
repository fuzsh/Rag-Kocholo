        "text": "Tucked away in the Adirondack Frontier, Chateaugay is a hidden gem of outdoor adventure and entertainment.\n\nHistory buffs will love learning about the rich historical significance of this community, settled in 1796 and having played a significant role in the War of 1812. Today, the Chateaugay Lakes, High Falls Campground and Recreation Park provide acres of lush green space for outdoor adventure. The Upper Lake is perfect for sailing, fishing, birding and capturing views of the Adirondack Mountains. The Lower Lake is an ideal spot for thrill-seekers, with opportunities for waterskiing, wake boarding, and tubing. When the weather gets cold, enjoy cross-country skiing, ice fishing and local snowmobile trails. Throughout the year, the bowling alley and Town Hall Theater offer affordable entertainment, and Talk of the Town Pizzeria is a must-visit for foodies."
