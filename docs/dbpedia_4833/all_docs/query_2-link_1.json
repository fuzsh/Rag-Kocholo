One of these armies moved northward from New York state into Lower Canada near the Châteauguay River. The British countered with a force of Canadian colonial militia and aboriginal warriors under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Charles-Michel d’Irumberry de Salaberry. When the Americans attacked on 26 October, de Salaberry’s defensive positions along the river held, and the Americans were forced to retreat and subsequently abandoned their plans to drive north towards Montréal.Footnote 2\n\nAwarded to:\n\nCurrently serving unitsFootnote 3\n\nThe Black Watch (Royal Highland Regiment) of Canada\n\nAward to the 5th Battalion, Select Embodied Militia\n\nThe Canadian Grenadier Guards\n\nAwards to the 1st Militia Light Infantry Battalion and the 2nd Battalion, Select Embodied Militia\n\nLes Fusiliers du St-Laurent\n\nAward to the 4th Battalion, Select Embodied Militia\n\nLe Régiment de la Chaudière\n\nAward to the 1st Battalion, Select Embodied Militia\n\nRoyal 22e Régiment\n\nDirect award to commemorate the Canadian Fencible Infantry and awards to the Beauharnois Division (1812-15), the Boucherville Division (1812-15), and Les Chasseurs\n\nLes Voltigeurs de Québec\n\nAward to the Provincial Corps of Light Infantry (Canadian Voltigeurs)\n\nDisbanded units"
