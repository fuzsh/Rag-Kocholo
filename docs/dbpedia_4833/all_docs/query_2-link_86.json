        "text": "Together with Anheuser-Busch\n\nAnheuser-Busch is proud to be a leading contributor to New York’s economy—and a committed community partner.\n\nThe solar installation provides an additional 3 million kilowatt-hours back to the distribution grid annually, providing enough solar electricity to brew more than 3 million cases of beverages a year.\n\nLandowners\n\nWe present landowners with new opportunities to capitalize on the value of their land while retaining ownership throughout the project life cycle. For many, this is a welcome complement to current land use and an opportunity to diversify their land investment while hedging against volatile commodity prices. For others, our projects offer an income stream and land-use option where none otherwise existed.\n\nOur teams and landowners work together, in partnership, from the beginning stages of site discussions, through permitting, construction, and operation. The landowner relationship with AES begins early, is built on trust and open communication, and ensures the partnership is beneficial for everyone."
