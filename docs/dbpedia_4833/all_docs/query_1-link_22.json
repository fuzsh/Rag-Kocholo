        "text": "Wise Dan was named North American Thoroughbred racing's 2012 Horse of the Year Saturday night at the Eclipse Awards Dinner at Gulfstream Park, the first gelding to be so feted since the great John Henry in 1984.\n\nThe now 6-year-old Wise Dan also became the first Horse of the Year to also win the older male and male turf divisional crowns since John Henry earned his first Horse of the Year in 1981. With 194 first-place votes out of 254, Wise Dan easily outdistanced the other finalists: Kentucky Derby and Preakness winner I'll Have Another (30 votes) and Breeders' Cup Classic winner Fort Larned (12) to earn the gold trophy of the great 18th-century racehorse and foundation sire Eclipse, signifying Horse of the Year.\n\n\"When you get to be my age, you need something to get up in the morning and look forward to,\" said Morton Fink, Wise Dan's elderly owner and breeder who produced the triple champ from his lone broodmare, a $29,000 purchase he named for his granddaughter. \"This horse has made me so happy that I can't even express it in words.\"\n\nWise Dan captured five of six races last year, going 4 for 4 on the turf, including the Grade I Woodbine Mile, Shadwell Turf Mile and the Breeders' Cup Mile (in course-record time). He also set Keeneland's track record in the 1 1/8-mile Ben Ali on Polytrack. His lone defeat was by a head in a troubled trip in Churchill Downs' Grade I Clark Handicap on dirt.\n\nThe gelding became only the fourth Horse of the Year to have raced primarily on turf since the Eclipse Awards were inaugurated in 1971 and the first since Kotashaan in 1993. Wise Dan also is the first grass mile specialist to win North American racing's top honor, with Kotashaan, the French mare All Along (1983) and John Henry ('84 and '81) racing at much longer distances.\n\nHorse of the Year traditionally has been the province of the top older dirt male, or in absence of such a standout, the top male 3-year-old on dirt. Wise Dan marks the fourth straight year that voters have gone for what historically is considered an unconventional choice, with fillies or mares prevailing the prior three years in Havre de Grace, Zenyatta and Rachel Alexandra.\n\nThe son of the low-profile stallion Wiseman's Ferry is out of Lisa Danielle, Fink's broodmare.\n\n\"I'd have never thought it in a million years,\" Keeneland-based trainer Lopresti said in a phone interview last week about the possibility of Wise Dan being Horse of the Year. \"Somebody asked me if five years ago I'd have thought I'd ever have these kinds of horses, this kind of success. It's like a dream come true. And to come away with a trophy like that, that's what every trainer works for, every trainer hopes for: to have a horse like that. It's hard to believe, that he's one of the favorites for Horse of the Year. To actually win it, I don't know how anything could get any better.\"\n\nLopresti said the likely target for Wise Dan's 6-year-old debut would be Keeneland's Grade I Maker's 46 Mile on turf. \"If he stubbed his toe, or if there was bad weather and he didn't make, he would go in the Ben Ali as his first race,\" he said. \"Keeneland is going to tell me a lot, once we run there.\"\n\nHe said it's possible Wise Dan, who captured Churchill's Grade I Clark Handicap to end his 2011 season, could try the Stephen Foster again. He also said he thinks Wise Dan can be effective at the Classic's distance of 1¼ miles.\n\n\"I'd like to try him on the dirt again,\" he said. \"If that's the only knock on him right now, maybe that's a goal you set for yourself. We know he can run on any surface. We've already seen that.\"\n\nOther Kentuckians were in the spotlight at the Eclipse Awards ceremony before a sell-out crowd at the South Florida track:\n\nDale Romans earned his first Eclipse as outstanding trainer for a season that included victories in the Breeders' Cup Turf, Arlington Million and Woodford Reserve Turf Classic (all with Little Mike), the Metropolitan Mile and Clark Handicap (Shackleford) and Pacific Classic and Blue Grass (Dullahan), along with two Grade I victories by long-time client Frank Jones' Tapitsfly.\n\nShanghai Bobby, the unbeaten winner of the Breeders' Cup Juvenile, proved the most dominant victor, garnering 253 of the 254 first-place votes. His Starlight Racing ownership includes managing partner Jack Wolf, as well as Ed and Clinton Glasscock, all of Louisville.\n\nGroupie Doll, winner of the Breeders' Cup Filly & Mare Sprint winner and two other Grade I races, also was a near unanimous winner (250 votes) as champion female sprinter. The now 5-year-old mare is the first champion for Louisville-based trainer Buff Bradley, who bred and owns Groupie Doll with his father, former Kentucky state senator Fred Bradley of Frankfort. The Bradleys last year sold minority interest to Carl Hurst of Madisonville, Ky., and Brent Jones of Gulfshores, Ala., both long-time clients.\n\nFort Larned, trained by Churchill Downs-based Ian Wilkes, finished a strong second (139-109) to Wise Dan as older male. Wise Dan enjoyed a bigger margin as male grass champ, 170-78 over Little Mike.\n\nI'll Have Another – whose Triple Crown bid ended when he was retired with a tendon injury the day before the Belmont Stakes – was the overwhelming choice as champion 3-year-old male. By contract, the closest vote was for 3-year-old filly, where Questing (winner of the prestigious Coaching Club American Oaks and Alabama) edged Ladies' Classic winner My Miss Aurelia 106-102.\n\nRamon Dominguez earned the Eclipse Award as outstanding jockey for the third straight year, even as he was in a New York hospital after sustaining a skull fracture in a spill Friday. His fellow finalists, Hall of Famer John Velazquez and Javier Castellano, accepted the award for Dominguez.\n\n2012 Eclipse Awards winners\n\nHorse of the Year: Wise Dan\n\nVoting: Wise Dan 194; I'll Have Another, 30; Fort Larned, 12; Royal Delta 8; Little Mike, 6; Frankel 1; Groupie Doll, 1; Shanghai Bobby 1; abstentions, 1.\n\nCategory Horse (Trainer) Starts-1-2-3 Earnings\n\nTwo-year-old male: Shanghai Bobby (Pletcher) 5-5-0-0 $1,687,000\n\nWon G1 Champagne in NY, BC Juvenile in Calif.\n\nVoting:Shanghai Bobby, 253; Uncaptured, 1.\n\nTwo-year-old filly: Beholder (Mandella) 5-3-1-0 $1,215,000\n\nWon BC Juv.
