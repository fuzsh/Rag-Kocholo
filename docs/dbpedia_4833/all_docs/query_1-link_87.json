        "text": "I try to focus on and write about the good stuff in horse racing. These beautiful and honest creatures and the great people that surround them provide an endless list of topics to write about. But the racetrack is also a place of broken dreams, broken hearts and broken bones that can't be ignored.\n\nThis story might very well be the saddest I've witnessed over the years, and it's about one of the greatest horses of all time, Ruffian. The mere mention of Ruffian often brings a tear to the eye of horseplayers. If this tragic story doesn't move you, it's quite possible you don't have a pulse. Although it's been many years since Ruffian set hoof on a racetrack, she continues to inspire, as well as haunt people of the racing world, always reminding us greatness can come with a hefty price.\n\nBrilliant from the beginning\n\nRuffian was born April 17, 1972, at Claiborne Farm, in Paris, Kentucky. She was a massive, dark bay filly — so dark, in fact, that she looked black. She was nicknamed \"Sophie the Sofa,\" because she was so easy and comfortable to sit on. Her brilliance became obvious to the world in her very first race in 1974. Ruffian assumed the lead and never looked back, winning her maiden race by 15 lengths and breaking the track record in the process.\n\nThis type of effort would become a habit with Ruffian. She wound up winning every race she ever ran (except the match race that would take her life) and broke or tied every track record no matter what track she set foot on. Ruffian was just plain fast. So fast, that trainer Frank Whitely gave instructions to jockey Jacinto Vazquez to slow the horse down whenever possible.\n\nAfter beating up on the girls race after race, fans were desperate to see Ruffian compete against the boys. Trainer Frank Whitely didn't take the bait and decided to wait another year before taking on the colts. But horse racing was hurting in that era, and the New York Racing Association had a great idea to add some spark to the sport. That year in 1975, three horses won all three legs of the Triple Crown and the NYRA's great idea was to pit the undefeated Ruffian against those three winners.\n\nMatch race: Foolish Pleasure vs. Ruffian\n\nFoolish Pleasure, winner of the Kentucky Derby; Master Derby, winner of the Preakness; and Avatar, winner of the Belmont Stakes, were slated to compete against Ruffian in a race for the ages. But the connections of Avatar backed out and the NYRA decided the race just didn't have the same thrill with the defection. The problem was solved, however, when the owners of Master Derby were given some money to disappear and the fans were left with a match race: Foolish Pleasure vs. Ruffian, the undefeated filly.\n\nAs the race approached, the match seemed to take on a life of its own. Instead of just deciding which horse was better, the question evolved into which sex was better, colts or fillies, and progressed to the men or women debate. But amid the women's liberation movement and the male population believing men rule, it was still just a horse race.\n\nOn July 6, 1975, 50,000 people came to Belmont Park to witness the 1¼ mile race of the century. As the gates opened, Ruffian assumed the early lead as usual, and the two battled throughout the first mile. But with about a half mile to go, something went terribly amiss with the filly. Ruffian dropped her head and swerved into Foolish Pleasure, and it was obvious the filly had injured herself.\n\nAs Foolish Pleasure galloped to the finish line, Vazquez tried to pull up Ruffian to limit the damage. But Ruffian was a warrior that had never even seen the back end of another horse and her instincts told her to keep running. When Vazquez was finally able to stop Ruffian, he leaped from her back and tried to support the champ until help arrived, but the panicked horse turned in circles around the jockey.\n\nGreatness is cut short\n\nWhen help arrived, the stricken horse was loaded into an equine ambulance and taken to the hospital. It was determined the filly had broken the sesamoid bones in her right foreleg, and she went into surgery to have them repaired. America waited through the hot July evening for any news on the champion filly.\n\nRuffian had made it through the surgery but when coming out of anesthesia, she took a turn for the worse. Being an extreme battler, Ruffian awoke thinking she might still be in the race and paddled around her legs. In her panic, she began thrashing about and wound up undoing any good the surgery had done, as well as breaking her other leg. Unable to withstand another round of anesthesia or surgery, the great and beautiful Ruffian was humanely euthanized.\n\nRuffian had been honored with the Eclipse Award for American Champion 2-year-old filly and won another Eclipse Award, posthumously, for American Champion 3-year-old the following year. Many people believe that had she lived, she could have gone on to become the greatest racehorse of all time, myself included. She may have been as good as or even better than Secretariat and Man of War.\n\nLucien Laurin, trainer of Secretariat, was quoted as saying, \"As God as my witness, she may be better than Secretariat.\"\n\nDeath yields some good\n\nAs sad as this story is, some good has come from Ruffian's death. The race that claimed her life was the last match race in the U.S. Her death also inspired countless advances in equine medicine, and the industry learned a bit from her demise. When Barbaro underwent surgery for a shattered leg in 2006, he was woken up in a pool of water so if he thrashed around he wouldn't injure himself. In 2009, an $18 million project called the Ruffian Equine Medical Center, now known as the Cornell Ruffian Equine Specialists, was opened just outside of Belmont Park. The champion filly would also be proud of the race run every year in her honor, the Ruffian Handicap.\n\nFollowing her death July 7, 1975, she was buried under the flagpole at Belmont and like the true champion she was, her nose was pointed toward the finish line. Ruffian didn't win or even finish her last race but went out a total winner in my book.\n\nREAD MORE EIGHTH POLE:\n\nAn afternoon with retired steeplechase jockey Jimmy Duggan\n\nNot even a toe tag could keep this jockey from a race"
