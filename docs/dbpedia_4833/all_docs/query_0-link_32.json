        "text": "Returned to France for stud duty after the war, Teddy quickly established himself a top stallion, the exploits of his classic-winning son Sir Gallahad III earning him leading sire status in France in 1923, while another son, Astérus, captured the classic Poule d' Essai des Poulains in the spring of 1926.\n\nLa Troienne on the Turf\n\nLeonidas possessed a some racing class, capturing the Prix de la Municipalite in France and the Lincolnshire Handicap in Britain. Boussac held high hopes for La Troienne, and from the beginning of her racing career, ran her in the best company.\n\nUnfortunately, La Troienne had none of the talent of her elder brother. Due to her small stature, she was also somewhat delicate, traits she would later pass onto some of her offspring. La Troienne made her debut in the Prix de Sablonville in September 1928. Her home gallops must have shown something, for she started at odds of 4-1. She was unplaced. Raced once more as a juvenile, La Troienne ran far down the course in the Prix d'Arenberg.\n\nLa Troienne was sent out the first time at three in the Prix Chloe, going off at odds of 38-1. She performed like the longshot she was, straggling home unplaced. Her dismal record did not seem to deter Boussac, who had no qualms at all about running her in the classic Poule d'Essai des Pouliches. At odds of 31-1, La Troienne made no headway and finished unplaced to the victress Poesie.\n\nStill, Boussac persevered with La Troienne. Despite four unplaced runs, Boussac shipped her to England. The change of climate or racing surface may have had some effect, for though she didn't win any of her British races, her form improved substantially. In Newmarket's five furlong Snailwell Stakes, she ran a decent third. In the Freckenham Stakes, run a month later over seven furlongs, she was beaten for the win by only a length and a half. Her improvement halted there, as in her next and last start, the Welter Handicap at six furlongs, she reverted to her old form and ran unplaced.\n\nAfter seven starts, with no wins, one second, one third, five unplaced finishes and only the equivalent of $146 in purse money won, La Troienne was retired. Boussac was a strict adherent to keeping only those mares which produced, either on the track or in the breeding shed. Those which failed to do so were culled without a second thought. At the same time La Troienne was toiling hopelessly on the tracks of France and England, Boussac sent the elderly foundation matron Frizette to a French slaughterhouse, despite the fact her daughters had helped make his stud. La Troienne fortunately escaped that fate. Instead, Boussac shipped her back to England in the spring of 1930 and had her covered by Gainsborough. She was a young mare, by a leading sire, from a classic-producing family. In foal to a stallion whose son Singapore was rated one of the best of his age that same year, Boussac hoped to reap some financial benefit from the filly who had singularly failed to redeem herself as a runner for the Boussac stable. Accordingly, La Troienne, and five other Boussac mares, were sent to the Newmarket December sale.\n\nLa Troienne was catalogued as hip number 640, one number before fellow Boussac cull Lespedeza, a daughter of Frizette. Both mares were purchased by Dick Thompson, acting on behalf of Edward Riley Bradley, master of Idle Hour Farn near Lexington, Kentucky. La Troienne was the most expensive of the six Boussac mares offered at the sale, going for 1250 guineas. In one of the ironies of genetics, Boussac later bred a three-quarter sister to La Troienne, a daughter of Astérus named Adargatis. A superior performer, she captured the classic Prix de Diane and was retained by Marcel Boussac for his broodmare band. While she foaled two exemplary racehorses in the full brothers Ardan and Pardal, her longterm influence proved to be negligible, with American performers Cornish Prince and Kentucky Derby winner Spend A Buck proving to be two of her most noteworthy descendants.\n\nLa Troienne in the Breeding Shed\n\nThe purchaser of La Troienne, Edward Riley Bradley, a man who went by the honorary title Colonel, was a gambler by profession and a horse breeder by vocation. Bradley began breeding horses in 1906, and his breeding fortunes took off with the acquisition of yearling colt Black Toney. Many pounds below his contemporaries Old Rosebud and Pennant on the racetrack, Black Toney quickly established himself a first rate stallion when he sired champion filly Miss Jemima in his very first crop of just four foals. Black Toney was a male line descendant of Domino, an intensely inbred (Domino carried three crosses of Lexington in the first four removes of his pedigree), and brilliantly fast champion of the early 1890s who became a hugely successful sire despite his tragic early death.\n\nWith his early success for Col. Bradley, Black Toney soon became the premier stud at Idle Hour. For many years, the Colonel followed a practice of mating his mares almost exclusively to Black Toney or his sons and grandsons.\n\nWhen La Troienne arrived at Idle Hour in early 1931, it was decided to send her to Black Toney. But first she had to drop the foal she was carrying by Gainsborough. In due course she did foal a Gainsborough filly. Tragically, the filly suffered from weakness in her back and hindquarters. This unnamed filly was put down, which at the time seemed no great loss. Years later, Bradley's longtime farm manager Olin Gentry, lamented the loss of that Gainsborough filly. With the benefit of hindsight, Gentry sadly recalled, \"The worst thing he ever did was have me destroy the first filly we bred from La Troienne.\" The sentiment rang all the more true as the years went by, as La Troienne proceeded to found a female family which to date has yielded over 800 stakes winners. She has been called the most important mare ever imported to the United States. Each of her daughters, as well as many granddaughters, great-granddaughters and beyond, founded branches of her family which combined, make the family of La Troienne an influential one in the history of Thoroughbred breeding and racing. Busher\n\nBusher was one of the last champions campaigned in Col. Bradley's green and white silks. She earned a championship as a two-year-old, when she won five of seven starts, including the Adirondack Stakes, Matron Stakes, and the rich Selima Stakes. World War II caused the temporary suspension of racing in the United States from January to May of 1945. Consequently, Col. Bradley sold a good number of his horses in training, Busher included. The champion filly was purchased by Hollywood mogul Louis B. Mayer and shipped cross country to her new quarters at Santa Anita Park. Her price tag was not cheap--$50,000. She swiftly recouped her purchase price, accumulating $273,735 during her second season at the track.\n\nAs a three-year-old, Busher swept nearly all before her enroute to being named champion three-year-old filly and Horse of the Year. Her victories included the Santa Susana Stakes, the Santa Margarita, the Cleopatra Handicap, a match race with champion Durazna, the Arlington Handicap, the Beverly Handicap, the Vanity Handicap, and, in perhaps her finest performance, an authoritative victory over Calumet Farm's tough gelding Armed in the Washington Park Handicap. Busher did not race at four, and at five was unplaced in an overnight race. Mayer retired her and later that year sold her to Elizabeth Arden Graham's Maine Chance Farm for $150,000. Busher's exemplary racing career earned her induction into the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame in 1964.\n\nBusher had only five foals before her premature death after foaling in 1955. But she produced the good stakes winning Jet Pilot colt Jet Action, her only foal to reach the races. American Grade I winners Beau's Eagle and Favorite Funtime trace to Busher through her daughter Miss Busher, by Alibhai.\n\nStriking\n\nWhile Busher's contribution to the Baby League branch of La Troienne's family was stunted by her early death, it flourished via the descendants of Striking, Busher's full sister and her junior by five years. Baby League was one of the Bradley horses which went to Ogden Phipps after the death of Col. Bradley, and she was carrying Striking at the time of her transfer to Claiborne Farm.\n\nStriking was a tall, handsome bay filly, quite unlike Busher, who was a small filly like her grandmother La Troienne. However, Striking had only a fraction of her sister's racing ability. During her career, she faced the starter fifteen times, for a record of three wins. She did win the Schuylerville Stakes at two, ran second in the Selima Stakes, Spinaway Stakes, and Marguerite Stakes, and third in the Matron and Pimlico Futurity.\n\nAt stud, Striking produced fifteen foals. Of these, there were five stakes winners, including Bases Full and her brother Hitting Away (by Ambiorix), Batter Up (by Tom Fool), Glamour (by Nasrullah), and My Boss Lady (by Bold Ruler). The careers of three of her stakes winners overlapped, and that accomplishment made Striking an easy choice for Broodmare of the Year honors in 1961.\n\nGlamour, foaled in 1954, won the Jasmine Stakes and the Test Stakes. Retired to the Phipps broodmare band, she produced St. Leger winner Boucher, by Ribot, and the Round Table colt Poker, known as the broodmare sire of Triple Crown champion Seattle Slew and dual-classic winner Silver Charm. Glamour's stakes-placed daughter Intriguing, by Swaps, produced the stakes-placed colts How Curious and Cunning Trick, champion filly Numbered Account, and the non-winning filly Playmate. Both Numbered Account and Playmate produced stakes winners; Numbered Account was dam of sire Private Account, and Playmate was the dam of Irish junvenile champion Woodman (1893), an influential sire or champions and sires.\n\nGlamour's sister, So Chic, earned two small victories from eleven starts, but like so many of the fillies in the family, her inadequacies on the track did not hinder her performance as a broodmare. Her offspring included stakes winner Beau Brummel, Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes runner-up Dapper Dan, and Adirondack Stakes heroine Fashion Verdict. Broodmare of the Year Prospector's Delite, 2003 American Horse of the Year Mineshaft, and other stakes winners descend from So Chic.\n\nStriking's daughter Bases Full was fourth dam of 2004 Kentucky Derby and Preakness winner Smarty Jones.\n\nThe accomplishments of the family of Baby League were still far in the future in the spring of 1935, for when that filly was suckling, her mother La Troienne was again sent to the court of Black Toney. In the spring of 1936 La Troienne foaled a full sister to her champion daughter Black Helen. This was BIG HURRY.\n\nBIG HURRY\n\nBig Hurry was a strongly-made brown filly who possessed none of the precociousness of Black Helen. Trained by William Hurley, who had schooled her elder sister, Big Hurry was first seen under colors in July, 1938. She made five starts that summer, at Empire City, Saratoga, and Belmont Park, before finally breaking her maiden at the latter track in late September. Shipped to Laurel Park in Maryland, she won one of two prep races for the rich Selima Stakes. In the big event itself, Big Hurry closed steadily to defeat Inscoelda by three quarters of a length. Sent against colts for the Pimlico Futurity, she ran well, but could not defeat the colts, coming in fourth. In all, Big Hurry faced the starter ten times at two, and won three, with one second, one third, and $28,810 in earnings. Unfortunately, Big Hurry did not train on at three. She made two starts, failed to win, and was retired.\n\nBridal Flower\n\nBridal Flower came about as a result of a rare occasion in which Col. Bradley mated one of his mares to an outside stallion, let alone one who stood as far away as Maryland. But then Challenger II was no ordinary mid-Atlantic based stallion, for he was at the time the sire of Challedon, an American classic winner and Horse of the Year. Later in the decade, his daughter Gallorette would emerge as a champion capable of beating the best horses in training regardless of gender. Bridal Flower was not as rugged physically as Gallorette, rather she took after her \"cousin\" Black Helen in terms of her small size, yet she had a heart and tenacity which carried her to a memorable career on the track.\n\nBridal Flower proved to be a decent two-year-old, though never quite up to the task of winning a stakes, but rather getting pieces of the purse. At three, Bridal Flower rounded into form and her campaign saw her named champion three-year-old filly at year's end. She notched stakes wins in the Gazelle Stakes, New Castle Handicap, and a division of the Beldame Handicap. None other than Challenger II's other highly-regarded daughter, Gallorette, captured the other division. Bridal Flower's finest hour at three, though, was a courageous victory over males in the Roamer Handicap. Among her opponents was that season's Triple Crown hero, King Ranch's Assault. The two hooked up with an eighth of a mile left to run, with the filly giving everything she had to defeat Assault by a mere half length.\n\nBy the end of the season, Col. Bradley was dead. In the subsequent dispersal, Bridal Flower went to the King Ranch portion of the syndicate handling the Idle Hour dispersal, thereby becoming a stablemate of Assault. At four, she won the Lady Baltimore Handicap and the Westchester Handicap and ran a gallant second to Armed in the Arlington Handicap. As a broodmare for King Ranch, Bridal Flower was a disappointment, foaling a single stakes winner. Her branch of the family has seen a smattering of stakes winners over the years, the most notable being Super Staff, a foal of 1988 and victress in the Grade I Yellow Ribbon Invitational Handicap.\n\nSearching\n\nAt the time Bridal Flower was racing, her dam Big Hurry had been sold to Ogden Phipps. For him, she produced three stakes winners--The Admiral, Great Captain, and Searching--all by War Admiral. She also produced a filly by King Cole named No Fiddling. The Admiral was a top notch juvenile, winning the Tremont Stakes and the United States Hotel Stakes before his sudden death at age two. Great Captain was less precocious, but matured into a fine stayer, capturing the prestigious Saratoga Cup.\n\nSearching, born in 1952, was one of the best female handicap runners of the 1950s and became perhaps the most important female descendant of La Troienne by virtue of the family she founded. Trained by \"Sunny\" Jim Fitzsimmons, Searching raced twenty times as two and three for Phipps without success. Finally, in the spring of 1955 at Belmont Park, Searching was sold. Her purchaser was trainer Hirsch Jacobs, the man who had claimed Stymie for only $1500 and transformed him into a one-time world's leading money earner. Jacobs recalled years later how he acquired Searching. Saddling a maiden in the paddock, he noticed Fitzsimmons and Phipps in the next stall saddling Searching. Intrigued, Jacobs remarked, \"Ogden, I see you have another daughter of Big Hurry in here.\" To which a disgusted Phipps replied, \"Yes, and you can have her after the race for $15,000.\"\n\nIt was a scenario oddly reminiscent of Seabiscuit, whom Fitzsimmons had trained for the Phipps family with very little success in the 1930s, only to have him sold and become a multiple champion and national idol for another stable. While Searching did not become either a champion or a national idol, she performed well enough to warrant induction into the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame in 1978 and recognition as one of the most important broodmares of her time.\n\nTrained by Jacobs and racing in the name of his wife Ethel, Searching raced through the age of six. In her first season in the Jacobs shedrow, Searching captured the Vagrancy Handicap and the Gallorette Handicap. At four, Searching took the Correction, Diana, Maskette, and Top Flight Handicaps, at five the Gallorette and Distaff Handicaps, and at six the Correction, Diana, Matriarch, and Molly Pitcher Handicaps. A fractured sesamoid ended her career. She earned a total of $327, 381 with a record of 25 victories in 89 lifetime starts. Upon her retirement, Searching was sent to Hagyard Farm north of Lexington.\n\nHer first foal was a handsome dark bay daughter of Swaps who was named Affectionately. During the racing career of her mother, Jacobs carried a picture of Searching in his wallet as a reminder of what a great racemare should look like. Once her daughter started racing, Searching's picture was replaced with one of Affectionately. At two, Affectionately captured the Astoria, Spinaway, Fashion, Polly Drummond, and National Stallion Stakes. At year's end, Affectionately was named co-champion two-year-old on some polls with Smart Deb, victress in the Matron and Frizette Stakes, both over Affectionately.\n\nFor the rest of her career, Affectionately was primarily kept to sprints. At three, Affectionately won only the Interborough Handicap, champion honors going to the Bold Ruler filly Lamb Chop. At four, Affectionately added the Correction, Interborough, Sport Page, and Vosburgh Handicaps. At five, Affectionately had her best season, winning the Correction Handicap, the Distaff Handicap under 128 pounds, the Toboggan Handicap over Chieftain and Pia Star, the nine furlong Top Flight Handicap over Steeple Jill and Old Hat, and the Vagrancy Handicap under a staggering impost of 137 pounds. Affectionately joined her dam Searching in the Hall of Fame when she was inducted in 1989. In the stud Affectionately produced the champion colt Personality, by Hail to Reason; sent to stud in Japan, he is seen as broodmare sire of 1990 Canadian Triple Crown champion Izvestia.\n\nIn 1962 Searching foaled the first of two fillies by Jacobs homebred champion Hail to Reason. This was Admiring. As a two-year-old, Admiring won the Arlington-Washington Lassie Stakes and placed three other stakes. She was stakes-placed at both three and four. As a broodmare, she produced ten winners, but not for Jacobs. Because of declining health, Jacobs sold many of his horses in a reduction sale in 1966. Admiring was sold for $310,000 to the partnership of Charles Engelhard and Paul Mellon, at the time a world record for a horse sold at public auction. Eventually, Paul Mellon acquired sole ownership of Admiring, and for him she foaled in 1973 a strongly-built, headstrong filly by Graustark named Glowing Tribute, a stakes winner on the grass. Glowing Tribute, Broodmare of the Year in 1993, became the dam of an incredible seven stakes winners, including Hero's Honor; Glowing Honor, like her mother, a winner of the Diana Handicap; Mackie; Coronation Cup; and Kentucky Derby winner Sea Hero, a colt sired by another La Troienne descendant named Polish Navy. The daughters of Glowing Tribute have become successful producers: stakes winners Eastern Echo, Roar, Yell, and European champion Mozart, descend from them. Sire Magesterial and Coaching Club American Oaks winner Lite Light descend from other Admiring daughters.\n\nThe second Searching daughter by Hail to Reason was Priceless Gem, born in 1963. Her two-year-old season was one of sheer brilliance, for she not only captured the rich Frizette Stakes but she became only the thirteenth filly to defeat colts in the historic Futurity Stakes, and she did so by defeating the acknowledged king of that season's two-year-old colts, Ogden Phipps's Buckpasser, like Priceless Gem a female line descendant of La Troienne.\n\nFor the Jacobs family, Priceless Gem produced as her first foal a filly by Sea-Bird. This filly was sold as a weanling in the autumn of 1971 for a reported $160,000 to French art dealer and horse owner Daniel Wildenstein. The filly was named Allez France, and during her career became the toast of France, winning thirteen races from eighteen starts in France, twelve Group races, eight of which were Group I, and five championships. Her wins included the classic Prix de Diane, Poule d' Essai des Pouliches, and the Prix Vermeille at three, and the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe at four. Sadly, Allez France had a difficult career in the broodmare paddocks, foaling a dead Secretariat colt in her first year. She eventually produced French Group winner Action Francaise before her death in a paddock accident at the age of nineteen in 1989.\n\nIn addition to Allez France, Priceless Gem produced New Zealand leading sire Noble Bijou to the cover of Vaguely Noble; Lady Wimbourne, destined to become the dam of major winners Al Mamoon and La Gueriere to the cover of Secretariat; and Priceless Countess, a full sister to Noble Bijou and dam of American Champagne Stakes winner Ordway.\n\nNo Fiddling\n\nSearching was not the first filly Jacobs obtained from Phipps who turned out to be a goldmine. The first was another daughter of Big Hurry, sired by King Cole, named No Fiddling, whom Jacobs claimed as a two-year-old in 1947 for $7500. This granddaughter of La Troienne retired with no success in eighteen lifetime starts. At age seventeen she foaled a sturdy, handsome bay filly by Hail to Reason in 1962, named Straight Deal. She raced through the age of seven, running 99 times. Of these races, she won 21 and placed in 30 others. Her wins included thirteen stakes races, among them the Spinster Stakes, Delaware Handicap, Ladies Handicap, Hollywood Oaks, and Top Flight Handicap. Six of her stakes wins came at the age of five when she was voted champion handicap mare. Despite the hard racing, as a broodmare, she produced ten foals, eight of which were winners, with three stakes winners. Her Grade l-winning daughter Desiree foaled a Grade I winner in the Seattle Slew filly Adored. Straight Deal was also second dam of stakes winners Commemorate, Premiership, and Belong to Me. Horses descending in tail-female from No Fiddling include Millionaire gelding Royal Glint, Irish St. Leger winner Turgeon (by Caro), Breeders' Cup Turf winner Tikkanen (by Cozzene), and co-champion junveile filly Regal Gleam and her Nijinsky II son Caerleon, the latter 1983 champion three-year-old in France and sire of numerous champions in Europe.\n\nDashing By\n\nBig Hurry's daughter Dashing By, by Menow, was a decent winner of eight races. After the death of Col. Bradley, his longtime farm manager Olin Gentry remained to keep managing the property after much of it was purchased by John W. Galbreath and renamed Darby Dan Farm. Gentry obtained a daughter of Dashing By, a filly named Stealaway, who was stakes-placed as a runner. Bred to Galbreath's Kentucky Derby and Belmont Stakes champion Chateaugay, she foaled a tough, high class campaigner named True Knight. During his career, True Knight captured nine stakes, including the Amory L. Haskell Handicap, and the Suburban Handicap, both Grade I events. A full sister to Stealaway, Chicken Little, became the second dam of Zoman, a rugged chestnut son of Affirmed who won Group races in France, Ireland, Scotland, England, and the United States. It was sad for breeders that Zoman proved sterile and True Knight, though a fertile stallion, failed to sire anything of consequence.\n\nAllemande\n\nAllemande was the last foal produced by Big Hurry, foaled when that mare was nineteen. Sired by classic winner Counterpoint and foaled in 1955, Allemande inherited some of the soundness problems of her sire and consequently never raced. She paid her way into the Phipps broodmare band as the dam of Marking Time, a To Market filly who captured the semi-classic Acorn Stakes for Phipps in 1966. Utilizing two different patterns in the same mating--crossing a Black Toney line mare from the family of La Troienne (Marking Time) with another female line descendant of La Troienne(Buckpasser), Ogden Phipps came up with another champion in a sugarcube-loving bay mare named Relaxing.\n\nRaced initially in Great Britain, Relaxing was returned to US soil as a four-year-old. After placing in some turf stakes, she found her best form on the dirt and rounded out the season with wins in the Firenze Handicap and the Gallant Fox Handicap, in the latter thrashing males over 1-5/8 miles in record time. At five, \"Sugar Mouth,\" the nickname she earned around the barn because of her propensity for sweet treats, blossomed, earning championship laurels as the nation's best older mare. Her victories included the Delaware Handicap and Ruffian Handicap, and the John B. Campbell and and Assault Handicaps over males. Relaxing also ran a huge third to champion gelding John Henry in the Jockey Club Gold Cup.\n\nLike so many La Troienne tribe members before her, when she went to stud, Relaxing founded a mini dynasty of her own. From twelve foals, she produced three stakes winners--Easy Goer (by Alydar), Cadillacing, and Easy Now--each of whom won at the Grade I level. For 1989, the year her son Easy Goer captured six Grade I stakes, Relaxing was named Broodmare of the Year. Stakes winners Cat Cay, Strolling Along (a shuttle sire to Australian, who died at age five), and 2001 CCA Oaks winner Tweedside (by Thunder Gulch) also descend from Allemande.\n\nBIMELECH\n\nFollowing the birth of Big Hurry, La Troienne was mated for the last time to aging Black Toney. The stallion was then twenty-five-years-old. Bradley wanted nothing more than a good colt out of La Troienne from his beloved Black Toney. In the spring of 1937 he got his wish, for La Troienne gave birth to a fine dark brown colt. In fact, this was the last colt ever sired by Black Toney, who died when his last-born son was only a yearling. The colt's name was BIMELECH, and during his racing career, Bradley proclaimed him at least the equal if not better than his personal favorite, champion Blue Larkspur."
