        "text": "Last Saturday's Coaching Club American Oaks (USA-G1) field may have been short on quality (as measured by pre-race records of the entrants) and quantity, but it was not short on excitement. Racing all the way outside stablemate Crystal Ball, Paris Lights withstood a stretch-long duel and thrust her head in front in the final strides to take the filly classic. It was the first stakes win for the daughter of Curlin, who also garnered enough points toward the Longines Kentucky Oaks (USA-G1) to guarantee herself a slot if her connections so desire.\n\nParis Lights also enhanced her value as a prospective broodmare, which was already quite high thanks to her family connections. She descends from the marvelous family of Best in Show, which captured its second Grade 1 win in less than two weeks after War of Will won the Maker's Mark Mile Stakes on July 10.\n\nParis Lights traces her descent from Best in Show through Blush With Pride, a Blushing Groom half sister to War of Will's ancestress Minnie Hauk. The best of Best in Show's daughters on the track, Blush With Pride won the 1982 Kentucky Oaks (USA-G1) and Santa Susana Stakes (USA-G1) before producing three graded/Group stakes winners of her own, including 2007 Kentucky Broodmare of the Year Better Than Honour (by Deputy Minister).\n\nToward the end of her producing career, Blush With Pride was mated four successive times to the great European stallion Sadler's Wells. Her first daughter from this cross was Group 1-placed Maryinsky, whose first two foals were 2007 European co-champion 3-year-old filly Peeping Fawn (by Danehill) and 2007 Criterium International (FR-G1) winner Thewayyouare (by Kingmambo). Peeping Fawn is the dam and granddam of listed stakes winners, and Maryinsky's most recent foals are the 2018 American Pharoah colt Narmer (who is still unraced) and a 2019 American Pharoah filly.\n\nMaryinsky's full sister Butterfly Blue was less distinguished on the race course, winning one of nine starts with no black type, and also failed to produce any stakes winners, though four of her foals were stakes-placed. Her record as a dam of broodmares is improving her overall profile, however. Sapphire Pendant (by Danehill Dancer), Group 3-placed on the turf, came up with a Group 3 winner last year in Ecrivain (by Lope de Vega), winner of the 2019 Prix de Chenes. Listed-placed Lacadena (by Fasliyev) has done still better, as she has multiple Grade 1-placed Grade 3 winner America (by A. P. Indy) to her credit as well as Paris Bikini (by Bernardini), dam of Paris Lights.\n\nLacadena's branch of the family is in a good position to continue adding honors, as America's first three foals are the 2018 Curlin colt First Captain (a $1.5 million sales yearling who is as yet unraced), the 2019 Curlin filly American Caviar, and a 2020 colt by Uncle Mo. As for Paris Bikini, she followed Paris Lights with the unraced 2018 Into Mischief colt Cousteau and has a 2019 Distorted Humor filly and a 2020 Always Dreaming colt. Thus, even if Paris Lights fails to follow up on her initial Grade 1 success, there are more prospects in the pipeline to keep this family proud for some time to come.\n\nUnbeaten so far in 2020, Bruce Lunsford's homebred Art Collector thrust himself into the conversation surrounding the Kentucky Derby Presented by Woodford Reserve (USA-G1) with an authoritative win over top filly Swiss Skydiver in the Toyota Blue Grass Stakes (USA-G1). As he is a son of 2006 Preakness Stakes (USA-G1) winner and American champion 3-year-old male Bernardini, there is reason to believe that he will have no problem with the 10-furlong Derby distance, and this is reinforced by a look at his female family.\n\nArt Collector is a fifth-generation descendant of Bebop II, a stakes-placed daughter of 1951 French champion sire Prince Bio who became part of Greentree Stud's broodmare band. Her immediate impact in the paddocks was not particularly impressive, as three stakes-placed runners were the best she could produce from 10 named foals. It was her broodmare daughters who proved Bebop II's worth. Four of them became stakes producers, and two did well indeed: stakes-placed Stepping High (by No Robbery), who produced the stakes winners and successful sires Buckaroo (by Buckpasser) and Parade Marshal (by Caro) as well as several broodmares of significance, and Bebopper, a daughter of Tom Fool.\n\nWhile Bebopper never won or placed in a stakes, she was a consistent sort whose talent easily placed her in the category of \"New York allowance winner\" and probably made her the equivalent or better of many a stakes winner on a lesser circuit. Her sons Stop the Music (by Hail to Reason) and Hatchet Man (by The Axe II) were both high-class racehorses and sires of some significance, and two of her non-stakes-winning daughters also made contributions to the family reputation, as Crazy Music (by Hail to Reason) produced 1985 Laurel Turf Cup Handicap (USA-G3) winner Crazy Moon (by Stage Door Johnny) and Boasting (by Bold Lad) became the second dam of 1996 American champion 3-year-old filly Yanks Music.\n\nBebopper's most important daughter is the Hoist the Flag mare Flag Waver, who was a listed stakes winner during her own racing days. The dam of stakes winner Abidjan (by Sir Ivor; dam of stakes winner Lady Tabitha, by Lyphard) and of Private Banking (by Private Account), second dam of 2008 Canadian champion 3-year-old filly Ginger Brew, Flag Waver also produced Grade 1-placed Bunting (by Private Account), who produced 1999 Illinois Derby (USA-G2) winner Vision and Verse (by Storm Cat) as her first foal. 10 foals later, Bunting came up with Grade 1-placed stakes winner Distorted Legacy (by Distorted Humor), who produced Art Collector as her second foal.\n\nDistorted Legacy's best racing performance was when runner-up in the 10-furlong Flower Bowl Invitational Stakes (USA-G1), and this family has produced plenty of horses that could handle two turns with aplomb, so stamina is not likely to be a problem for Art Collector. The question now---as it is for every one of his rivals---is whether he has the soundness and luck to make it to the Derby starting gate and the class and tactical speed to make his own luck in America's most contentious race. Nonetheless, he has earned his ticket to the \"Big Dance\" of the 3-year-old season and will get his chance to collect the country's most coveted piece of sporting art: the Derby trophy.\n\nWith only four entries, the Los Alamitos Derby (USA-G3) on July 4 left plenty of questions unanswered as to how any of its entrants might fare in the usually crowded, contentions conditions of the Kentucky Derby Presented by Woodford Reserve (USA-G1). Nonetheless, winner Uncle Chuck made his stakes debut look pretty good, easily downing multiple graded stakes winner Thousand Words to remain unbeaten and pick up 20 points toward a Kentucky Derby starting slot.\n\nSired by 2010 American champion 2-year-old male Uncle Mo, who has already sired 2016 Kentucky Derby winner Nyquist, Uncle Chuck descends from the family of Lady Be Good, a speedy daughter of Better Self who was a prolific producer for Wheatley Stable and Ogden Phipps after winning two stakes races as a juvenile but failing to train on. Given the status of a modern foundation mare by bloodstock expert John Sparkman, Lady Be Good produced four stakes winners and a slew of successful broodmares.\n\nImpish, Lady Be Good's 1972 daughter by Majestic Prince, won her only start and became the dam of multiple Grade 2 winner Lay Down (by Spectacular Bid) and listed stakes winner Karly's Harley (by Harlan).She also foaled four daughters who produced stakes winners. The most notable of the group is I Pass (by Buckpasser), who won two of her three starts and was second in the other in her brief racing career. Bred to Mr. Prospector, she produced the brilliant but unsound Mining, whose six wins from seven starts included the 1988 Vosburgh Stakes (USA-G1).\n\nMining's older half sister Defer (by Damascus) never made it to the track at all but produced three multiple stakes producers in Cabaret Queen (by Gone West), Millie's Delight (by El Gran Senor) and Defer West (by Gone West). The last-named mare became a minor stakes winner as a 4-year-old but has been a better broodmare than runner, producing 2005 Honorable Miss Handicap (USA-G2) winner Forest Music (by Unbridled's Song) and 2000 Sapling Stakes (USA-G3) winner Shooter (by Dehere).\n\nA very fast mare, Forest Music was also quite sound by the standards of her family, making 18 starts over three seasons of racing. As a broodmare, she has passed on a fair measure of her speed but not her soundness. Her first foal is Maclean's Music (by Distorted Humor), who won his only start and sired 2017 Preakness Stakes (USA-G1) winner Cloud Computing from his first crop. Her next foal to achieve some distinction is the Tiznow colt Kentuckian, whose three wins from 10 starts include the 2015 Lazaro Barrera Stakes (USA-G3). Electric Forest, Forest Music's 2015 filly by Curlin, won the 2019 Doubledogdare Stakes (USA-G3) but made only five starts over two seasons.\n\nIn Uncle Chuck, Forest Music has another runner who has shown brilliance, but the Los Alamitos Derby was only his second lifetime start, and Uncle Mo is better known for throwing speed than durability. Combined with a family that has had its share of soundness issues, the question of how long Uncle Chuck will last naturally arises. One hopes that it will be long enough to explore the full ability of a colt whose ancestress was good indeed.\n\nOnly five runners came out for Sunday's Grand Prix de Saint-Cloud (FR-G1), and the winner turned up in the 7-year-old Champs Elysees horse Way to Paris, who scored his first victory at the top level after becoming a multiple Group 2 winner last year. Perhaps appropriately for a horse who has scored his biggest victories in France, he belongs to the family of Glamour, who stands at the head of a thriving branch of the great La Troienne tribe.\n\nThe winner of the 1956 Test Stakes at Saratoga, Glamour would have logically been expected to throw speed. Instead, when mated to a series of staying sires, she threw four stakes winners that took after their sires' proclivities, headed by 1972 St. Leger Stakes (ENG-G1) winner Boucher (by Ribot). Her son Poker (by Princequillo) contributed to bloodstock breeding by siring the dam of the great racer and sire Seattle Slew, but Glamour made an equally important contribution to Thoroughbred breeding by producing stakes-placed Intriguing to the cover of Swaps.\n\nIntriguing's pedigree shows a 4x3 cross to 1937 American Triple Crown winner War Admiral, a champion sire and broodmare sire in the United States whose primary long-term influence on breeding has been through the daughters he sired on daughters of La Troienne. Intriguing's granddam Striking was one of those daughters, and when she was mated to Buckpasser, whose dam Busanda was also from the War Admiral/La Troienne cross, the resulting foals were inbred 3x5x4 to War Admiral and 4x5 to La Troienne, as well as 5x5 to the great English matriarch Selene.\n\nIntriguing was bred to Buckpasser seven times. Of the three stakes winners thus produced, the most important by far was 1971 American champion 3-year-old filly Numbered Account, dam of Grade 1 winners Private Account (by Damascus; an important sire) and Dance Number (by Northern Dancer) and ancestress of a galaxy of stars. Through Numbered Account's full sister Playmate, Intriguing is the granddam of 1985 Irish champion juvenile male and important sire Woodman (by Mr. Prospector), and two of Intriguing's other daughters by Buckpasser, Special Account and The Cuddler, also became stakes producers.\n\nFascinating Trick was Intriguing's only Buckpasser daughter not to produce a stakes winner, but her descendants have made up for this deficiency. Through her daughter Political Intrigue (by Deputy Minister), she is the second dam of Grade/Group 1 winner Redattore, a successful sire in Brazil, and the third dam of Brazilian Group 1 winner Joe Bravo.\n\nNorthern Naiad, Fascinating Trick's 1982 daughter by Nureyev, failed to win in ten tries, but she has made her own Group 1 contribution to the family via her daughter Grey Way. A 1993 filly by Cozzene, Grey Way won the 1996 Premio Lydia Tesio (ITY-G2) as a 3-year-old and was Grade 2-placed in the United States at 4. She is the dam of two-time Premio Presidente della Repubblica (ITY-G1) winner Distant Way (by Distant View) and of 2011 Premio Ambrosiano (ITY-G3) winner Cima de Pluie (by Singspiel), and produced Way to Paris as her last foal.\n\nNone of Grey Way's daughters have produced anything noteworthy thus far, but Glamour's family is in no danger of dying out. Through her descendants, she has continued to provide a touch of class around the world, and not just on the way to Paris."
