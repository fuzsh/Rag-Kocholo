        "text": "Whether the thoroughbred is a modern-day hero as American Pharoah or a classic stallion like Man o’ War, the most famous racehorses paint a picture of speed, power and an indomitable will in their accomplishments. The most famous horses in history also have a long line of their pedigree and stature.\n\nBest Online Racebooks\n\nHere are eight of the most famous racehorses in history based on key statistics including career winnings and outstanding achievements. Let’s start the list with the top thoroughbred of all time.\n\n#1 Secretariat\n\nNicknamed “Big Red” with auburn hair, Secretariat won the 1973 US Triple Crown. He crowned that achievement by finishing first in the Belmont Stakes with a 31-length lead. Secretariat was named Championed Juvenile Colt in 1972 and US Three-Year-Old Champion in 1973. He had a record of 16-3-1 in 21 races for earnings of $1,316,808 in the mid-1970’s.\n\n#2 Man o’ War\n\nBred in 1917, Man o’ War never got a chance to compete in the US Triple Crown. However, his record was 20-1-0 in 21 horse races. His earnings were $249,465, which is equivalent to $3.2 million in today’s money. Man o’ War sired War Admiral, who went on to win the Triple Crown in 1937.\n\nMost Popular US Horse Races\n\n#3 Seattle Slew\n\nSeattle Slew won all the Kentucky Derby Trail prep races before finishing first in the Triple Crown racing series of 1977. He also won 14 races in 17 competitive events overall. Seattle Slew was Championed Juvenile Colt, American Champion Three-Year-Old and American Champion Older Male Horse in 1976 to 1978. He won $1,208,726 at that time.\n\n#4 Citation\n\nKentucky bred, Citation was the first racehorse to break the $1 million mark in earnings. He raced competitively from 1947-51 and won 32 of his 45 events. Citation had a stellar record of 19-1 in three years of racing and he capped the feat off by winning the 1948 Triple Crown.\n\nMost Popular UK Races\n\n#5 Zenyatta\n\nZenyatta won 19 of 20 races during the 2008 and 2009 horse racing seasons, including back-to-back championships in the Breeders’ Cup. This horse was named the greatest filly of all-time by Sports Illustrated and she won $2,700,000 for first place in the 2009 Breeders’ Cup Classic. Zenyatta was awarded American Horse of the Year in 2010.\n\n#6 Affirmed\n\nDuring his horse racing career that went from 1977-79, Affirmed had won 22 of 29 starts. He won the Triple Crown in 1978 as one of his three-year-old achievements along with the Grade 1 Santa Anita Handicap and the Grade 1 Jockey Club Gold Cup the following year. Affirmed took home $2,383,818 in his career and won the American Horse of the Year in 1978 and 1979.\n\nMost Popular Horse Races in Australia\n\n#7 Kelso\n\nKelso’s long horse racing record includes a 39-12-2 showing in 63 events. He missed the Triple Crown in 1960. However, Kelso was American Champion Three-Year-Old that year. A five-time winner of the Jockey Club Gold Cup in his racing career, Kelso was the most successful thoroughbred of this Grade 1 event at Belmont Park.\n\n#8 Black Caviar\n\nBred in Australia, Black Caviar was 25-0-0 in 25 races in an undefeated career. As a sprinter, she raced from 2009-13. Black Caviar won $7,953,936 in her career. She placed first in the 2012 Diamond Jubilee Stakes at Royal Ascot as one of most amazing accomplishments in horse racing."
