        "text": "American jockey\n\nFor the Chilean footballer, see Braulio Baeza (footballer).\n\nBraulio Baeza (born March 26, 1940) is an American Thoroughbred horse racing Hall of Fame jockey and one of the master Thoroughbred jockeys of our time. In 1963, he was the first Latin American jockey to win the Kentucky Derby. Baeza began his racing career in 1955 in Panama at Hipodromo Juan Franco, and in March 1960, was invited to Miami, Florida to ride under contract for Owner/Trainer, Fred Hooper. He rode his first race in the US in the first race on Keeneland's opening day, 1960, and won it on Foolish Youth.[1]\n\nBraulio Baeza's success in America was instantaneous. He was the leading money winner in American racing from 1965 to 1969,[2] the 1968 winner of the George Woolf Memorial Jockey Award, and the 1972 and 1975 winner of the Eclipse Award for Outstanding Jockey. During his career, he rode a number of Thoroughbred greats, including Buckpasser, Graustark, Dr. Fager, and Ack Ack. In 1961, he won his first Belmont Stakes.[3] Two years later, he rode to his first Kentucky Derby victory on Chateaugay, as well as for his second Belmont Stakes win.[4] In 1969, he won the Belmont for the third time, denying Majestic Prince the Triple Crown, on board Paul Mellon's future Hall of Famer, Arts and Letters.\n\nIn 1972, Baeza travelled to York Racecourse in England, where he rode John Galbraith's Roberto to victory over the previously unbeaten Brigadier Gerard in the inaugural Benson & Hedges Gold Cup. That same year, he went to Woodbine Racetrack in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, where he won the prestigious Canadian International Stakes on Droll Role for Trainer T. J.Kelly. Baeza was the jockey aboard Foolish Pleasure in the tragic 1975 match race against the great 3-year-old filly Ruffian, who had to be euthanized after she pulled up during the race with a broken front ankle.\n\nBraulio Baeza retired in 1976 after having won 3140 races in the United States. He was inducted that same year into the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame.\n\nYear Kentucky Derby Finish Preakness Finish Belmont Finish 1961 Crozier 2nd Crozier 3rd Sherluck 1st 1962 Admiral's Voyage 9th - - Admiral's Voyage 2nd 1963 Chateaugay 1st Chateaugay 2nd Chateaugay 1st 1964 - - Quadrangle 4th - - 1964 - - - - Orientalist 6th 1965 - - - - Bold Bidder 8th 1966 Stupendous 4th Stupendous 2nd Stupendous 7th 1967 Successor 6th - - - - 1967 - - Great Power 10th - - 1967 - - - - Proud Clarion 4th 1968 Iron Ruler 11th - - - - 1968 - - - - Ardoise 5th 1969 Arts and Letters 2nd Arts and Letters 2nd Arts and Letters 1st 1970 Naskra 4th - - - - 1970 - - - - Aggressively 6th 1972 - - Key to the Mint 3rd Key to the Mint 4th 1973 My Gallant 9th - - - - 1973 - - - - Twice A Prince 2nd 1974 Triple Crown 17th - - - - 1974 - - Rube the Great 9th Rube the Great 4th 1975 Prince Thou Art 6th Prince Thou Art 4th Prince Thou Art 5th 1976 Honest Pleasure 2nd Honest Pleasure 5th - -\n\nKentucky Derby: 12-1-3-0\n\nPreakness Stakes: 10-0-3-2\n\nBelmont Stakes: 14-3-2-0"
