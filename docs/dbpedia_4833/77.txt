This horseshoe from the race horse Chateaugay, who won the Kentucky Derby in 1963 and the Belmont Stakes, was presented to Homer Bigart, who was a Pulitzer Prize-winning war correspondent from WWII, and primarily worked for the New York Herald Tribune. Horseshoe is made by the Thoroughbred Race Horse Shoe Company and is a size 5. Very nice presentation metal plaque. Condition is EX-MT.
