The NBA fined Los Angeles Lakers guard Steve Blake $25,000 Monday for what executive vice president of basketball operations Stu Jackson described as “directing inappropriate language toward a fan” in the waning seconds of the Lakers’ loss Friday to the Los Angeles Clippers at Staples Center.

Blake was seen on the team’s telecast sharing words with a courtside fan while Clippers guard Chris Paul shot free-throws with 40.3 seconds remaining. After fouling out of the game with 29.2 seconds left, Blake then appeared to utter obscenities to the fan. Blake continued as he walked toward the fan before play resumed.

The NBA indicated it fined Blake for the specific incident with 29.2 seconds remaining. It’s unclear what exactly led up to the incident.

Blake had eight points and two assists against the Clippers in his first start, but went only 2 of 6 from the field. Blake is starting for the Lakers, while Steve Nash remains sidelined with a mild fracture in his left leg.
