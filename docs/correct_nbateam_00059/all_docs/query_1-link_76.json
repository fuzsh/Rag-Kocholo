        "text": "LOS ANGELES — Blake Griffin performed like a man that desperately wanted this Saturday afternoon game.\n\nBut it was a rookie with the decisive play to deliver a needed victory for Griffin and the Detroit Pistons.\n\nGriffin scored 44 points to lead the Pistons to a 109-104 victory against the Los Angeles Clippers, his first game performing at Staples Center against the franchise that drafted him No. 1 overall in the 2009 NBA draft.\n\nGriffin was magnificent, shooting 13-for-23 from the field and adding eight rebounds and five assists in an emotional performance that snapped a four-game losing skid.\n\nBut with 21.2 seconds left and the Pistons clinging to a three-point lead, it was rookie Bruce Brown who came up with the key defensive stop.\n\nDefending Clippers go-to scorer Lou Williams, Brown came up with the steal.\n\nHe was fouled and made the free throws to account for the final score.\n\nAndre Drummond scored 20 points and grabbed 21 rebounds for the Pistons (18-23).\n\nThe three former Pistons players traded for Griffin — Tobias Harris, Avery Bradley and Boban Marjanovic — combined for 14 points. Marjanovic didn’t play for the Clippers (24-18).\n\nMore: Blake Griffin has no time for Clippers owner pregame\n\nAnalysis: Blake Griffin excelling with Pistons. But was trade worth it?\n\nIt was fitting that Griffin corralled the final rebound of the game.\n\nHe faked like he was going in for a final dunk, but dribbled out the final seconds.\n\nGriffin exchanged words with Clippers guard Patrick Beverly after the horn and both teams gathered near midcourt, but the two players were separated.\n\nGriffin's 44 points is the second-most points in NBA history in a player's first road game against his former team, and the most since 1977-78, according to Elias Sports.\n\nGriffin received a warm reception during pregame introductions and banter from the crowd was appreciative.\n\nNo. 1 fan Clipper Darrell summed up the afternoon with a few words when Griffin stepped to free-throw line in the first half.\n\n“Hey, Blake! You know I love you, right?” he yelled.\n\nThen he gave Griffin his customary razzing.\n\n“U-G-L-Y, you ain’t got no alibi, you ugly!”\n\nAt the game’s first stoppage, the Clippers organization played a montage of Griffin’s greatest moments in L.A.\n\n• Box score\n\nPistons start hot\n\nThe Pistons have been sluggish the first two outings of this four-game trip.\n\nBut galvanized by the emotion from Griffin, the team played with a sense of urgency not seen in weeks.\n\nGriffin scored 11 points in the first quarter, but it was a team effort.\n\nReggie Jackson started the game 3-for-4 from the field with two 3-pointers to score eight points.\n\nThe entire team was hot from 3-point range, shooting 5-for-8 to take a 37-24 lead after the first quarter.\n\nKhyri Thomas emerges\n\nWhen Brown picked up his third foul with 4:15 remaining in the first half, Pistons coach Dwane Casey turned to rookie Khyri Thomas.\n\nAnd he played well, nailing a corner 3-pointer to give the Pistons a 63-52 lead with 1:09 left in the second quarter. The Pistons led 65-54 at halftime.\n\nDownload our Pistons Xtra app on iTunes or Android!"
