        "text": "Naturally, Steve Blake would rather start than sit.\n\nCertainly, he would rather play major minutes than wait his turn.\n\nOf course, he would rather have the ball in his hands more often than not.\n\nBlake’s role with the Lakers remains to be determined, however. He could be a starter, supplanting Derek Fisher as their top point guard. Or he could serve as Fisher’s backup, giving them added experience and reliability.\n\nMore likely, he could be a reserve this coming season, learning the tricks of the trade in the Lakers’ triangle offense, and then swap roles with Fisher in the future.\n\nAbove all, the Lakers expect the battle-tested veterans to form a tag team for the next few seasons. Blake signed a four-season, $16 million contract last week, and Fisher re-signed earlier this week for $10.5 million over three seasons.\n\n“I look forward to coming in here and starting or coming off the bench and being productive,” Blake said during an introductory news conference Wednesday. “I know it’s about winning here, and whatever it takes for me to help the team win, I’ll do that.”\n\nNo question, Lakers general manager Mitch Kupchak is happy to have him. Blake’s willingness to take any role was a significant selling point, right along with a pass-first attitude, an accurate shot and a willingness to play hard-nosed defense.\n\n“We’ve followed his career for years,” Kupchak said. “We made attempts in the past to acquire his services. It’s not like he had one good game and all of a sudden we decided to go after him. He’s been a pretty consistent performer over the years.\n\n“We expect Derek would start. It’s the coach’s decision, but Derek will be 36 (next month), so we knew we needed a player in the backcourt to spell Derek and also going forward. … We need players who can play minutes.”\n\nFisher played 82 games last season, the fifth consecutive season he hasn’t missed a regular-season game. Blake played 80 games in 2009-10, including the final 29 with the Clippers after a February trade from Portland.\n\nFisher averaged 7.5 points, 2.1 rebounds and 2.5 assists. Blake averaged similarly modest totals of 7.3 points, 2.3 rebounds and 4.8 assists. He will replace Jordan Farmar, who signed a three-year, $12 million contract this week with the New Jersey Nets.\n\nBlake, 30, called Fisher a role model.\n\n“Absolutely, I’ve always looked up to him,” Blake said of his new teammate. “He’s a winner. I’ve always respected winning.”\n\nThe signing of Blake and the re-signing of Fisher leaves Kupchak with one guard spot to be filled. Kobe Bryant was scheduled to meet with free agent Raja Bell, a possible replacement for Shannon Brown, on Wednesday.\n\nBold prediction\n\nThe Lakers, rather than the Miami Heat, should be favored to win the NBA title.\n\nSays who? Miami’s Dwyane Wade, that’s who. Wade said the two-time defending champion Lakers should be favored to win a third consecutive title because he and his new teammates, LeBron James and Chris Bosh, haven’t proved anything.\n\n“The Lakers are the champions and we know the Lakers are very good,” Wade told reporters at a charity golf event in Miami. “That’s the team everyone’s shooting for, and they should be. Not the Miami Heat. The Los Angeles Lakers.”"
