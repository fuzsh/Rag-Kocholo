        "text": "When I watched the Los Angeles Clippers play this season, they reminded me a lot of my crew on USS Fort Worth (LCS 3); hard-working, happy and humble. Like my team, the Clippers were a joy to watch, they gave us maximum effort, minimum ego; and seemed to be having so much fun along the way. They challenged the defending Champions and earned our respect and admiration. In the end, the Clippers may have lost this series, but they won our hearts and perhaps more importantly, I believe Steve Ballmer, Jerry West, and Doc Rivers are laying the foundation to eventually replace the Warriors as the next NBA dynasty and win multiple championships in the 2020's.\n\nI see a lot of similarities to these Clippers and the team I built as captain of USS Forth Worth charged with operating one of the Navy's newest, fastest, and most advanced warships with a minimally manned crew. Last year, I shared our experiences in Build a Winning Team, an article highlighting our focus on Vision, Values, and Culture which ultimately lead to one of the best winning streaks in our new class of warship's young history.\n\nJust to be clear, I am not a sports analyst or journalist; I am a leader. But just as in sports, where game recognizes game, as a leader I recognize good leadership when I see it. The Clippers have the best leadership in the NBA. Simply put, the combination of Jerry West's Vision, Steve Ballmer's Values and Doc River's ability to develop a winning Cultureis unrivaled in the NBA.\n\nMy suspicion is that it is also clear to the rest of the league, and as a result, the Los Angeles Clippers will be a coveted landing spot for the likes of Kawhi Leonard, Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving and other outstanding free-agents. I believe with the addition of one, possibly two key free agents, the Clippers will win multiple championships in the 2020's.\n\nThe Clippers current success and future potential are not luck or accidental. They are by intelligent design. Let's take a moment to analyze and appreciate the Vision, Values and Culture of the LA Clippers.\n\nVISION\n\nWhere there is no vision, the people perish. – Proverbs\n\nAs captain of Fort Worth, I went to great lengths to paint a vivid and clear picture of our warship’s future. At every opportunity, I would describe in detail what victory looked like for us as we tackled inspections, training exercises and ultimately mission accomplishment.\n\nClearly Steve Ballmer is captain of the Clippers ship, that said, even Ballmer knows he is not a basketball expert, lucky for him he has the greatest NBA visionary of all time in his front office. Jerry West provides the Vision for the Clippers. He has proven himself with his impeccable record helping to build the “Showtime” Lakers and current edition of the Golden State Warriors into world champions. He is doing it again with the Clippers, he has charted the course for a Clippers championship.\n\nThink well to the end, consider the end first. - Leonardo Da Vinci\n\nThis is my favorite quote. It’s what separates visionary leaders from good leaders. Jerry West channels his inner Da Vinci better than any NBA executive in the League. I have the impression he is playing chess, thinking all the way through to checkmate, while the rest of the league is playing checkers. Case and point; compare the Lakers recent moves to the Clippers transition from the Lob City trio of Chris Paul, Blake Griffin and Deandre Jordan to the current playoff bound edition of the Clippers. West turned Blake’s massive contract from an anchor holding back the Clippers to a breath of fresh air filling Clippers sails. That single trade ultimately resulted in exciting young talent like Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Landry Shamet and Ivica Zubac, not to mention two additional first and second round draft picks in the next three years. The Chris Paul trade was equally impressive, netting the heart and soul of the new look Clippers, including Patrick Beverley, Lou Williams and Montrezl Harrell. Taken together with some other moves, and the Clippers have managed to do the unthinkable, compete while re-tooling and clearing enough cap space for two max contracts during the much-coveted Summer 2019 free agency. Checkmate!\n\nVALUES\n\nAs Captain of Fort Worth, I knew in order to achieve our mission we would need to be very strong and develop a deep level of trust unrivaled in the fleet. We invested a lot of time building Strength and Trust, our core values.\n\nSteve Ballmer has a slightly different set of core values. Like at Microsoft before and now as owner of the Clippers, Ballmer values Commitment and Ideas above all else.\n\nCommitment is what transforms a promise into a reality. - Abraham Lincoln\n\nAccording the Ballmer, “The team has got to know you’re committed”. This of course begs the question, “If you are committed, then how could you trade your self-proclaimed ‘Clipper for Life’ Blake Griffin less than a year after you went over the top selling him on the franchise and rewarding him with a massive contract?”. The answer is simple, Ballmer is committed to building a winning team, and the team rises above any single player. As the NBA’s richest owner, he has the resources and is committed to turning the Clippers into one of the NBA’s flagship franchises. Of course, that starts with the team on the court, continues to the new Clippers stadium in Inglewood (which he has plans to privately fund), and ultimately ends with his commitment to the fan. Many thought the Clippers would tank after the Tobias Harris trade to preserve their first-round draft pick, that’s not in Ballmer’s DNA. He is committed to winning.\n\nIdeas\n\nSteve Ballmer will be the first to tell you, commitment is great, but you must have the best ideas as well. It makes no sense to command your team to “take that hill” if it’s the wrong hill. Just has he did at Microsoft, Ballmer recognizes that he may not be the smartest person in the room and consistently makes an effort to ensure he is surrounded by the best talent. He also challenges Lawrence Frank and his Front Office’s assumptions by asking really difficult questions, before ultimately executing.\n\nOn Fort Worth I had a hyper-intelligent crew with big ideas. I leveraged their intelligence by challenging them to think well about the future, translate those ideas into purposeful action to shape the future, evaluate the value of those actions, and most importantly improve. My team surpassed even my wildest expectations. The Clippers are winning the battle of ideas, one of Steve Ballmer’s most important core Values.\n\nCULTURE\n\nCulture eats strategy for breakfast. – Peter Drucker\n\nAs legendary thought leader Peter Drucker suggests, Culture is the most critical element in building a winning team. The Clippers’ culture is what reminded me the most of my team and compelled me to write a sequel to my article Build a Winning Team. Doc Rivers is the best in the business at building a winning Culture. He has done it Orlando, again in Boston, and yet again with this young Clippers squad. I would argue the latter is his best coaching job ever and worthy of consideration for Coach of the Year.\n\nDoc is famous for saying I want R’s over S’s, Character over Characters. It is Doc’s inspirational leadership on the court that makes Steve and Jerry look brilliant right now. Doc does not have a single All-Star, and after the Tobias Harris trade, the Clippers got even younger. Three of their five starters are under 22. How has he done it? By instilling a Hardworking, Happy, Humble and Winning Culture.\n\nHard Working\n\nWhen faced with the overwhelming challenge of serving on a minimally manned ship, some crews make the fatal mistake of falling into the “whoa is me” mindset, which ultimately leads to a victim mentality, low morale and even lower performance. I never once apologized for the amount of work we had to do, and I always reminded my team we were lucky to wear U.S. on our chest and sail our badass warship.\n\nAfter the Tobias Harris trade, the Clippers could have easily felt sorry for themselves and mailed it in for the rest of the season. Yet, Doc refused to let that trade, youth, or anything else for that matter, serve as an excuse, he says mistakes happen, but no team will out work us. Since the trade, the Clippers actually won more games and secured the final Playoff spot in the Western Conference. The Game 2 victory over the Warriors was proof positive, these Clippers are possibly the hardest working team in the NBA. They refuse to quit after being down 31 points to the defending champions.\n\nHappy\n\nNever underestimate how important humor is in mission accomplishment. Even in the tensest of circumstances, my crew knew they had the freedom to have some fun. And once they started playing practical jokes on me, I knew we had achieved our objective of creating a happy culture.\n\nEver watch one of Doc Rivers press conferences? They are funny, light, and he doesn’t take himself too seriously. That translates directly to his team. They play loose, fun, exciting basketball.\n\nHumble\n\nI am truly convinced pride comes before the fall, and nothing can humble you like a warship. While winning was very important to us on Fort Worth, I was quick to always remind my team that our work speaks for itself, so it was pointless, in fact counter-productive, to be boastful.\n\nThe Western Conference can also be very humbling, just ask LeBron James. The Clippers often play in the shadow of the Lakers and they don't have any all-stars but yet they keep winning. They are more than happy to let their record speak for itself. And perhaps on occasion, Patrick Beverleymight remind some folks of that record. For me that is more about respect, and less about being boastful.\n\nFinal Thoughts - Winning\n\nLet's be clear, I wanted to win and I wanted a team of winners. Hardworking, happy, and humble meant nothing if we did not have the wins to match. So, on Fort Worth we had a simple rule, celebrate the victories and learn from the defeats. Moreover, we never shied away from losses, instead we used them to give life to our motto, \"Just as iron sharpens iron, so too does one warrior sharpen another\".\n\nThe Clippers extraordinary leadership is interesting, and there is certainly a lot to learn from Jerry West's Vision and Steve Ballmer's Values, but it means nothing if Doc and company don't build that winning Culture and ultimately win championships.\n\nThe LA Clippers earned our respect and won our hearts. I am not a NBA analyst, but I have built a winning team for one of the Navy's newest and most advanced warships; I see a very strong combination of exceptional Vision, Values and Culture in the leadership of the LA Clippers and believe they are building the next great NBA dynasty.\n\nAbout the Author….\n\nCaptain Michael D.
