        "text": "THE ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nLOS ANGELES — Guard Steve Blake has signed with the Los Angeles Lakers.\n\nThe Lakers announced the deal Thursday after agreeing to terms with the veteran guard last week. Blake got a four-year contract worth US$16 million from the two-time defending NBA champions.\n\nBlake finished last season with the Los Angeles Clippers after arriving in February in a trade with Portland. He averaged 8.6 points and 4.8 assists in his seventh NBA season.\n\nBlake could be an important part of the Lakers’ rotation next season, particularly if point guard Derek Fisher leaves Los Angeles as a free agent."
