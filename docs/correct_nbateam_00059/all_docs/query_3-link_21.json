        "text": "From Drew Garrison, Silver Screen & Roll: Pau Gasol will undergo a FAST Technique procedure on both of his knees Thursday to help with the tendinosis he suffers from, reports Dave McMenamin of ESPN. The procedure will eliminate scar tissue in his knees while also preserving healthy tissue and is considered “minimally” invasive. Tendinosis, also commonly referred to as chronic tendinitis, indicates that the damage to his tendons in his knees is at a cellular level. The Los Angeles Lakers will announce an official timetable on his return after the surgery, but there is no indication that this will have negative long-term implications.According to the official FAST (Fasciotomy and Surgical Tenotomy) Technique website, Gasol’s recovery will likely take six weeks:\n\nFrom Dave McMenamin, ESPN LA: For a franchise that has won 16 titles, any Los Angeles Lakers season that doesn’t end with a championship is considered a failure. But rather than just dole out a blanket “F” for the Lakers’ disappointing 2012-13 season, we’re going to break down each part of the team’s production in groups: Our series ends today with the coaching staff and front office. We have already covered the starters this week and the bench backcourt and bench frontcourt last week.\n\nFrom Eric Pincus, LA Times: Veteran guard Steve Blake had his best year with the Lakers, when he was healthy. After two difficult seasons with the team, Blake shot 42.2% from the field and 42.1% from three-point range — a big leap from last year’s 37.7% and 33.5%, respectively. Early in the season, an abdominal strain sidelined him for more than two months. A hamstring injury shut him down halfway through the Lakers’ first-round sweep by the San Antonio Spurs. Blake missed 37 regular-season games, averaging 7.3 points and 3.8 assists. When Steve Nash sat out in April, Blake stepped into the starting lineup to help the team finish the season with a 7-1 record. In that stretch, Blake averaged 12.6 points a game. With Kobe Bryant out with an Achilles’ tear, Blake helped carry the offense for the team’s two final, must-win games (scoring 23 points against the Spurs and 24 against the Houston Rockets).\n\nFrom Kurt Helin, Pro Basketball Talk: When you’re in court battling your mother, you know the relationship is strained. As we told you before, Kobe Bryant’s mother Pamela hooked up with an auction house to sell off some of Kobe’s memorabilia she had — a Lower Merion High School game worn jersey, replica Lakers championship rings and more stuff Kobe’s mother had at her house. Kobe then went to court to block the sale. The auction house is involved in the case as well, asserting its rights to sell.\n\nFrom Gabriel Lee, Lakers Nation: Professional sports is the most impactful when we, the fans, actually care about the player(s) in our favorite team’s jerseys. At some point over the past year, I began to shift my allegiance from the teams I supported throughout my childhood to the players whose values I share. That epiphany actually happened last summer when the Lakers decided Andrew Bynum wasn’t reliable enough to be their franchise player for the post Kobe-era, so they swapped him for Dwight Howard. Every Laker fan I interact with began to celebrate the trade. I had mixed reactions. On paper, the Lakers had just upgraded their injury-prone center for one that had a much more impressive resume (he led his team to the Finals in 2009, 3-time Defensive Player of the Year, etc.). The way Howard had forced his way out of Orlando made me sick to my stomach. He threw his head coach under the bus, got his general manager fired, opted back into his contract before the trade deadline before demanding a trade again in the summer, all the while blaming everyone but himself for the Magic’s shortcomings."
