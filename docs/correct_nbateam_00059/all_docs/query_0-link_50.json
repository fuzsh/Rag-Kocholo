        "text": "In 2014, Steve Ballmer purchased the LA Clippers for $2 billion, now he aims to make the franchise worth more than what he bought it for.\n\nFive years ago when Steve Ballmer purchased the LA Clippers, the entire basketball world was stunned. It was the first time in history of sports that a team sold for more than six times of its total revenue. At the time, the Clippers were previously valued at $575 million, and Ballmer's final bid was 12 times the expected 2014 revenue, which was $100 million. The move changed the valuations of NBA teams around the country. Two years after Ballmer's purchase, the average NBA franchise would be worth $1.25 billion, compared to being just $393 million in 2012.\n\nWhen asked about the wild purchase in 2014, Ballmer said: 'There’s real earnings in this business. There’s real upside opportunity.'\n\nNow, five years later, it seems like the upside opportunity is finally here.\n\nWithin the short time that Ballmer has owned the Clippers, he's given the organization the perfect opportunity to excel, providing: a championship contending team, a top-tier front office, and a brand new arena.\n\nSteve Ballmer has taken every step imaginable to make the LA Clippers a premier NBA team, with the latest being unveiled on July 25. In an effort to break out of the Lakers' shadow, the Clippers officially announced that they'll be moving to Inglewood in 2024. Playing in the same building as a team with 16 championships is tough, let alone playing in the same city. The best that Doc Rivers could do to make STAPLES Center feel more like home when he arrived in 2013 was cover up the Lakers' banners. Not only that, but the Clippers receive third priority in scheduling over the Lakers and LA Kings. Players and coaches won't say it publicly, but a majority of them don't like playing 12:30PM games, and the Clippers played eight of them. Seven of those games were at home, 17% of the entire regular home season schedule.\n\nThe biggest aim for the Clippers in this relocation is to have an actual home. A home that can be used to recruit free agents, keep current players happy, and make fans proud. For Steve Ballmer though, that's not enough, especially for a man paying $1 billion of his own money.\n\n'My goal is simple. I want the Clippers to have the best home in all of sports.' - Steve Ballmer\n\nhttps://www.nba.com/article/2019/07/25/la-clippers-unveil-plans-inglewood-arena-official-release\n\nBallmer has already started taking a tour of a number of venues around the country, taking features and pieces from each building. He wants the arena to be focused solely on the Clipper basketball, with no hockey teams playing inside of it. Ballmer wants his opposition to dread coming to the new Inglewood arena, in the same way that they dreaded coming to Oracle Arena. It's about having the Clippers be synonymous with the best arena in sports, for players, fans, and sponsors.\n\nMake no mistake, it's almost impossible to overtake LA from the Los Angeles Lakers. They're one of the greatest franchises in the history of sports, with a historical roster that consists of some of the greatest NBA players ever. As it stands, the greatest Clipper players ever are Chris Paul and Blake Griffin, whereas the Lakers have the likes of Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Kobe Bryant, and Magic Johnson. The Clippers hope they can someday have their own Hall of Fame championship players in Kawhi Leonard and Paul George.\n\nOvertaking the Lakers isn't the ultimate goal for Steve Ballmer, transforming the Clippers into a premier destination is. It doesn't matter what the cost of re-signing a player, coach, or creating a building is, he's willing to do it. He wants to take the organization to heights they've never been, and make the $2 billion valuation become something even greater.\n\nWhen the Warriors won the championship in 2015, everything changed for them - the valuation of the team went up, they became a top-tier franchise, and are getting a brand new arena in 2019. That's the same path Ballmer wants the Clippers to follow. When NBA fans think of the Clippers, Ballmer wants them to think of the best players, the best coaching staff, and the best arena - not just the other LA team.\n\nAll the pieces are set for the Clippers to ascend these new heights. They currently have one of the best front offices in the league that were able to lure the reigning Finals MVP, a championship favorite team, and a new arena on the horizon. All that's left for them to do from now until 2024, is to win some championships."
