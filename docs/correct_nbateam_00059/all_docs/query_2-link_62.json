        "text": "Although eating quinoa pasta with meat sauce might have something to do with Steve Blake’s recent uptick in assists, the reason is much simplier.\n\n“I love passing the basketball, but it’s all about my teammates finishing,” he said.\n\nNot only did his Lakers teammates did an effective job scoring off his passes Sunday, they finished off Detroit, 114-99, at Staples Center. Blake notched 14 assists in the victory, two shy of his career high.\n\n“It’s just the way we play,” Blake said of why the Lakers were able to dismantle the Pistons. “We play with a good pace and it kind of gets them out of their defensive rhythm.\n\n“It’s all about the chemistry of knowing how to set the screen and where to roll to and when your guards to back up out of the corner. They’re moving extremely well without the ball and that’s what it takes for a point guard to be able to get assists.”\n\nWith Kobe Bryant still out and Steve Nash sidelined for at least another week, Blake has had to step up as a leader. He is averaging 9.8 points and 7.3 assists through 12 games.\n\n“I’m going to play hard whether Kobe is out there or not,” Blake said. “It’s just the way myself, Jordan (Hill) and guys play; take pride in your performance every single night. You have to go out there and scrap.”\n\nIn his expanded role, Blake has done a good job in not only finding the open man, but getting the ball repeatedly into the player who is on a roll. He said that comes naturally.\n\n“If there’s someone is wide open, you get them the ball,” he said. “But of course, if someone is hot that’s your job to know that as a point guard, to make a play for them and get them into position to make a shot. I’m always key to that.”"
