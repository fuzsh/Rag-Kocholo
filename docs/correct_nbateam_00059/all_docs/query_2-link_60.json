        "text": "Something irked Kobe Bryant, and it went beyond the Lakers’ endless losing or his persistent injuries that kept him sidelined for all but six games this season.\n\nBryant also expressed outrage over the Lakers trading Steve Blake to Golden State, leaving him to voice his displeasure on Twitter. Bryant said he was “not cool” with the Lakers trading Blake “AT ALL,” before calling him a “psycho competitor.”\n\nTwo months later, and those 140 characters still struck a chord with Blake.\n\n“It meant a lot. I was appreciative of the support especially from a player like Kobe,” Blake said in a phone interview with this newspaper. “It was cool for him to stick up for me. For a player to be so vocal in support in one of his teammates, that doesn’t happen very often. It meant so much to me.”\n\nBlake loved playing with Bryant the past four seasons with the Lakers for reasons going beyond his support.\n\n“From the outside, you can never fully understand how great a player he is until you see him night in and night out,” Blake said of Bryant. “You get to see him every day and how he handles himself and takes everything so seriously. You gain a lot of respect for him in what he does to be successful. He helped me become a better player to push myself to another level.”\n\nThe Lakers traded Blake for Kent Bazemore and MarShon Brooks, a move that saved the Lakers about $4 million in luxury taxes and salary. But the Lakers mourned Blake’s absence, his 9.5 points and 7.6 assists per game with the Lakers just a fraction of what he provided.\n\n“When he’s on the team, he’s your grittiness,” Lakers coach Mike D’Antoni said. “He will play every possession. He will get upset with guys that don’t play hard. He’s sorely missed. He plays defense, will make big shots and you know he’s going to give everything.”\n\nBlake has averaged four points and 3.3 assists with Golden State, a product of playing a bench role behind All-Star point guard Stephen Curry. But Warriors coach Mark Jackson praised Blake for providing “a calming affect” with the reserves with his playmaking, and aggressiveness.\n\n“He’s been outstanding and has been everything we thought we would get from him,” Jackson said. “He’s a guy who’s no-nonsense, fits into our culture and is always ready.”\n\nBlake conceded finding a silver lining in the trade, mindful that Golden State will make the playoffs. But Blake still holds the Lakers in high regard, expressing sympathy for their injury ravaged season, gushing about D’Antoni’s free-flowing offense and praising Steve Nash for recently passing Jackson for third place on the NBA’s all-time assists level.\n\n“I absolutely loved my four years with the Lakers except not getting a championship,” Blake said. “That’s one of the main reasons why I came there. I got to meet a lot of great people, make great relationships and play for great coaches. I wouldn’t have traded it for anything in the world.”\n\nYet, Blake misses Los Angeles for a more important reason.\n\n“The tough part is leaving my wife and three kids,” Blake said. “I’m coming home to an empty and quiet house. I’m not quite used to that.”\n\nMutual interest?\n\nLakers forward Nick Young said he’s “very confident” he will re-sign with the Lakers even though he plans to opt out of his $1.22 million option.\n\n“I think we’ll come to some kind of agreement,” Young said. “Hopefully it happens.”\n\nYoung has posted career highs in points (17.8 per game) and minutes played (28.2) in his seventh year in the NBA. “I would be glad to finish off here as a Laker,” said Young, a former Cleveland High and USC product. “My kids go to school and can say my dad was a Laker. That’s big.”\n\nInjury updates\n\nD’Antoni reported Nash “feels a lot better” with the irritated nerves in his back and could play before the season ends. Lakers center Chris Kaman hopes to return from a strained right calf injury either in Utah (April 14) or San Antonio (April 16).\n\nHe said it\n\nKaman on recently shaving his beard: “It was a mistake is what it was. I’m going to grow it back. Next year you’ll see me as an old Grizzly Adams.”"
