It feels like the early 2000s all over again; Steve Blake and Juan Dixon lead off our Terps news for the day.

Portland Trail Blazers Trade Steve Blake to Los Angeles Clippers - ESPN

The Clippers traded Marcus Camby to the Blazers for Travis Outlaw and Steve Blake. Dagger for Blake. He goes from a contending Portland team where he was well-liked in the community to the Lakers' redheaded step brother, the Clippers. Blake is in a contract year, so hopefully he can continue to show his value as a pass-first PG in the league and sign with a team this off-season. This hasn't been a good week for the starting 5 from the Natty team. - Dave T.

Dixon's Suspension Might Not be as Bad as Originally thought - Sporting News

This article by Andy Hutchins talks about the type of steroid that Dixon tested positive for (Nandrolone) and said Dixon never had a problem with it before. So, it makes Dixon's positive test seem much less significant. But it does again raise a point that athletes should know what's in these supplements before they take them. Or pay someone to know for you. - Dave T.

My Take: I'm reserving judgement until we know all the facts. You really, really, really want to believe Dixon here.
