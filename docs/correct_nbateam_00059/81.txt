LOS ANGELES — Guard Steve Blake has signed with the Los Angeles Lakers.

The Lakers announced the deal Thursday after agreeing to terms with the veteran guard last week. Blake got a four-year contract worth US$16 million from the two-time defending NBA champions.

Blake finished last season with the Los Angeles Clippers after arriving in February in a trade with Portland. He averaged 8.6 points and 4.8 assists in his seventh NBA season.

Blake could be an important part of the Lakers’ rotation next season, particularly if point guard Derek Fisher leaves Los Angeles as a free agent.
