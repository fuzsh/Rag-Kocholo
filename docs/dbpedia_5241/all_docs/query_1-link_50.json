        "text": "July 26, 2024\n\n‚ù§Ô∏èüíôüçµüíô‚ù§Ô∏èüçµ‚ù§Ô∏èüíôüçµüíô‚ù§Ô∏èüçµ‚ù§Ô∏èüíôüçµüíô‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nSixty-year old, Vera Wong, is a widow, mother and owner of a small, rarely visited, tea shop in San Francisco.\n\nVera, adheres to a strict schedule, and can be opinionated when it comes to other's lives and scheduling, particularly her son, Tilly. For example, if you aren't up by 4-4:30 a.m., you're basically wasting the day away.\n\nAs our story begins, you get to meet Vera and learn all about her little peccadilloes from her perspective. I loved her from the very start. She's perfect.\n\nVera's ordered world is suddenly turned upside down when one morning she discovers the body of a deceased man inside her tea shop!\n\nSuspecting she will do a better job than the police, Vera decides to take the investigation into her own hands. The police don't seem to suspect foul play, but Vera knows, something funny is going on here.\n\nThrough a random series of events, Vera comes up with four likely suspects: Julia, the dead man's wife, Rikki, Sana and Oliver, the dead man's twin brother. She then inserts herself into the suspect's lives, because how else is she going to determine which one is guilty?!\n\nThus, her super-stealthy, and by that I mean over-the-top, often hilarious, slightly-meddling, yet well-intentioned, investigation begins.\n\nI really, really enjoyed this story. The cast of characters, led by Vera, was truly the highlight for me. They were all relatable people, who ended up bonding with Vera in their own ways and for their own distinct reasons.\n\nVera was definitely a force to be reckoned with. She has such a big heart, is quirky as heck, sweetly innocent in many ways, but also willing to bulldoze anyone in pursuit of her goals. When Vera tells you to jump, you ask how high.\n\nI loved learning about the characters and watching their relationships develop. It was like they all needed support and ended up, through these unfortunate circumstances, finding exactly what they needed.\n\nThe overall story was cute, cozy and heart-warming. At times, I did wish for a slightly more intriguing Mystery to help propel the plot, but the found family elements were so strong, it more than made up for that, in my opinion.\n\nI always feel like I connect well with Sutanto's humor and characters. I just really enjoy her writing style. It's become such a comfort for me and she is an auto-buy author because of that.\n\nThank you so much to the publisher, Berkley Books, for providing me with a copy to read and review. As expected, this was super fun and cute! I cannot wait to pick up more from this author in the future.\n\nNovember 11, 2023\n\n4.5 ‚≠êÔ∏è\n\nI am here to ‚Äúspill the tea‚Äù on the Audible version of this book-narrated by the wonderfully engaging Eunice Wong-this has been my FAVORITE audible listen so far this year!!\n\nVera Wong was born a rat, but she should have been a rooster-that is according to the characteristics of the signs in the Chinese horoscope!\n\nOwner of Vera Wang‚Äôs World Famous Tea Shop in San Francisco‚Äôs China Town, she wakes up promptly at 430 AM each morning, without an alarm, texts her Gen Z son, Tilly, with ‚Äúhelpful‚Äù advice, and makes her way downstairs to open the store.\n\nThe shop is struggling, and she only has one regular customer despite being an expert in the lost Art of preparing tea. Then one morning, Vera finds a dead man in the middle of her tea shop with a flash drive in his outstretched hand.\n\nVera doesn‚Äôt know what comes over her, but after calling the cops like any good citizen would, she sort of . . . swipes the flash drive from the body and tucks it into the pocket of her apron for safekeeping.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause Vera KNOWS she would do a better job at solving the crime than the police possibly could. All she has to do is wait for the murderer to return to the scene of the crime!\n\nAfter all, NOBODY sniffs out a wrongdoing quite like a suspicious Chinese mother with time on her hands.\n\nAnd, since she knows that one of the keys to staying young is to keep up with the times-she is quite proficient at using ‚Äúthe TikTok‚Äù and ‚Äúthe Google‚Äù too!!\n\nSoon she has befriended her ‚Äúsuspects‚Äù all NEW customers who have suddenly started frequenting her tea shop-\n\nOliver-the twin brother of the Victim\n\nJulia-his widow\n\nSana- alleged PodCast host and\n\nRiki, who claims to be a journalist\n\nBut as she gets to know them, she finds that she is hoping to be wrong this time-she doesn‚Äôt want any of them to turn out to be a murderer that she has to turn over to the inept Police.\n\nThis is a COZY mystery that actually did SURPRISE me! Plus it‚Äôs filled with LOTS of good humor that will make you smile and warm your heart! I highly recommend that you give it a listen!\n\nI am glad that I didn‚Äôt miss out on meeting the marvelous, meddlesome Vera Wong!\n\nThank You to the Chandler Public Library for the loan of this Audible!!\n\nAVAILABLE NOW!\n\nJune 3, 2023\n\nI was a little suspect to begin this novel as it featured yet another older woman as the main protagonist. There have been a plethora of books featuring older adults but this one was a winner!!\n\nVera Wong is not a complainer ‚Äì she has a routine that she follows religiously. Up at the crack of dawn, a long walk, a brisk shower and she‚Äôs down in her tea shop!! She may send a quick text to her son, Tilly, reminding him that he gets up too late and he needs to find a wife!!\n\nHer routine is interrupted one morning when she comes downstairs to find a dead man!! What does she do?? She calls the police of course but not before drawing an outline with permanent marker around the dead body ‚Äì she‚Äôs seen this on numerous crime shows. She also may have checked his pockets for clues!!\n\nVera immediately finds the police to be lackluster and useless as they don‚Äôt check for DNA, fingerprints or ANYTHING!! They aren‚Äôt even considering that this might be a murder. Vera knows that she has to get things done on her own.\n\nThe dead man is Marshall and there are a lot of people who aren‚Äôt sad that he is gone!\n\nThe novel then quickly ramps up with suspects including Marshall's wife Julia and several others who stop by the shop because Vera knows that ‚ÄúMURDERERS ALWAYS RETURN TO THE SCENE OF THE CRIME!!‚Äù\n\nThere is so much heart in this novel. This is more than a cozy murder mystery as Vera slowly wins over the hearts of the suspects and they become friends. Each of them is struggling in some way and Vera has a way of getting people to open up. She even wins the heart of Julia‚Äôs demanding 2 y/o daughter Emma, who has never warmed to anyone before! I loved watching Vera interact with all of the characters who were all very well described.\n\nThe mystery itself is quite good and I really didn‚Äôt know who killed Marshall!\n\nThe less said about the plot the better, go into it blind and enjoy ‚Äì I certainly did!!\n\nI received an ARC of this novel from the publisher through Edelweiss. It was my pleasure to read and review this title.\n\nMarch 22, 2023\n\nIt saddens me to give this two stars, but I was really let down by the writing. I loved Dial A for Aunties and Four Aunties and a Wedding was fun, but as much as I wanted to love Vera Wong's Unsolicited Advice for Murderers, it just felt like it needed more editing.\n\nAfter finishing the book, I read the acknowledgements section, and suddenly all my issues with the book made sense. Sutanto was rushed to write this, and it shows. I really like the premise, but the writing could have used more time in the oven to cook (so to speak).\n\nThis book has multiple POVs told from a third person omniscient narrator, which I did not like. Vera is supposed to be our main character, and I think we would have been better off sticking with Vera throughout the whole book and getting a first person account from her, as she is the one who is supposed to be investigating the murder. By the end, she felt like just another side character, as the author clearly related more to the younger characters who crowd Vera's spotlight.\n\nWhile I do like how all the characters came together, I also felt as if the five side characters' personalities were all interchangeable. Each character has their one or two \"things,\" like painting, and they all have somewhat of a backstory, but aside from that, they all act in exactly the same manner as one another. At the beginning, Julia and Sana are both passive pushovers who are victimized by everyone in their life. Tilly, Oliver, and Riki are just Gen Z/Millenial nice guys. The way they speak, the way they act, are pretty much all the same.\n\nWhich brings me to the \"bad\" characters in this book. The actions of the \"bad\" characters are just very evil. While I know that there are some extreme assholes out there and abusive relationships are unfortunately common, it seemed nuts to me that some of these characters would be so cruel and one-note, just exaggerated villains.\n\nAnd Emma. Emma is two years old, but she comes off like she is three to five years old. I know the author has children, so it's not like she's altogether unfamiliar with this age group, but Emma was very eloquent and aware, and did not ask nearly enough questions. Granted, I do not have children of my own, but I work with them and Emma would be the most mature two-year-old I'd ever encounter.\n\nThe mystery was fine, but the killer was glaringly obvious to me about halfway through. However, the reasoning was far more insidious than I would have expected. Like??? Sir??? You BLATANTLY abuse your one child in favor of another for their entire lifetime, and then as soon as you find out the golden child is very mean, your first instinct is to KILL HIM? MURDER is your FIRST THOUGHT? I figured it'd be an accident, like, \"Whoops! I accidentally killed my son without realizing it,\" but no-- he full on CHOSE that outcome. That's wild to me.\n\nGoing back to the editing thing... The writing really started to bug me after I noticed two consecutive chapters that began, \"__ can't remember the last time s/he __.\" (For example, \"Vera can't remember the last time she felt so alive.\") After I started noticing it, I found this phrase peppered throughout the whole second half of the book. None of these characters can remember anything about their own lives apparently!\n\nIt also bugged me how all their problems were blamed on one person, and then suddenly all their problems were solved with a different person.\n\nI know cozy mysteries are by nature formulaic, and I'm new to reading this genre as an adult, but as much as I was entertained by the first half, I couldn't help but notice its shortcomings as the book went on.\n\nBut, I won't give up on you, Jesse. I'm still going to read Dial A for Aunties 3.\n\nMay 23, 2024\n\nVera is a 60 year old woman who, despite owning a tea shop and being in great health, is incredibly lonely.\n\nAnd bored.\n\nShe misses her husband who died years ago, and she misses her son who doesn't call her back often enough. <--but that doesn't stop her from leaving unwanted messages telling him what time he should be getting up in the morning, going to bed at night, or that he needs to settle down with a nice girl.\n\nSo when she wakes up one morning to discover that a man crashed through the front door of her shop (with his body!) and then died on her floor?\n\nWell, she isn't one to let a good opportunity go to waste.\n\nShe's going to help the police investigate!\n\nAnd what does Vera Wong's idea of help look like?\n\nWell, it looks like she will go ahead and draw a chalk outline...in Sharpie. And it also looks like she might have to take a teeny bit of evidence out of his hand before the police get there.\n\nBECAUSE SHE'S HELPFUL.\n\nOk, this is less about a murder and more bout a quirky character introducing the reader to other quirky characters, and then all of those oddballs forming a quirky little family.\n\nIt was a sweet story about lies, healing, love, and (of course) murder.\n\nI will say Vera read like she was quite a bit older than 60 to me. BUT! That's just my opinion and maybe that has been the author's experience with women that age. Or maybe I'm freaking out because I'm edging closer to 60 myself and I still think I'm cool.\n\nThen again, I do have a visor...\n\nRecommended!\n\nApril 20, 2023\n\n3.75‚≠êÔ∏è rounded up!\n\n‚ÄúPeople always say that your wedding day is the happiest day of your life, but honestly, people should try solving murders more often.‚Äù\n\nSixty-year-old Vera Wong Zhuzhu owns and runs Vera Wang‚Äôs World- Famous Teahouse in San Francisco. Widowed, she lives alone on the floor above her tea shop and constantly keeps tabs on her adult son Tilly, checking in with him often through phone messages. Vera leads a disciplined life, wakes up early every morning and goes about her business. Unfortunately, her tea shop isn‚Äôt doing too well, but that does not deter her diligence or devotion to her business. One morning, she wakes up to discover a dead body in her shop. Vera does notify law enforcement but not before she, given the ‚Äúhelpful and resourceful‚Äù person that she is, prepares the crime scene which involves outlining the body just like she has seen on television, much to the annoyance of the police officers who are assigned to the case. The deceased is identified as Marshall Chen. Vera isn‚Äôt too happy with how Officer Gray and her team go about handling the crime scene and their somewhat indifferent attitude does not instill much confidence in Vera who considers herself a sleuth in addition to being a ‚Äútea doctor\".\n\nIn the days following Marshall‚Äôs death, Vera meets several people who visit her shop and try to extract information about the case - Riki who claims to be a journalist, Sana who introduces herself as a podcast host, Marshall‚Äôs twin brother Oliver and Julia, Marshall's wife. Vera decides that one of them must be the killer because, according to her, the murderer is bound to return to the scene of the crime. Vera is confident of her sleuthing skills primarily because ‚Äúnobody sniffs out wrongdoing quite like a suspicious Chinese mother with time on her hands‚Äù and she has honed her knowledge by closely following crime procedurals on television. As the narrative progresses, we follow Vera as she goes about unraveling the mystery behind Marshall Chen‚Äôs death.\n\nVera Wong's Unsolicited Advice for Murderers by Jesse Q. Sutanto is an entertaining, cozy mystery. I loved how the author depicts the friendship that develops between Vera and her ‚Äúsuspects‚Äù. Though the mystery angle isn‚Äôt quite as gripping as I had hoped and the pace does drag a bit in parts, I did enjoy following Vera as she unabashedly pokes her nose into everyone‚Äôs business in her attempts to identify the murderer, all the while cooking up a storm (the list of delicacies Vera prepares will have your mouth watering!), matchmaking , sharing her wisdom and offering advice to all her \"suspects\" on their personal problems. Vera Wong is a force to be reckoned with. Sharp and quirky with a heart of gold, Vera is an endearing character. Overall, I found this to be a heartwarming, feel-good read that I would not hesitate to recommend to those who enjoy cozy mysteries and/or are looking for something lighthearted in between heavier reads.\n\nI paired my reading with the wonderful audio narration by Eunice Wong that definitely enhanced my experience. I can‚Äôt remember when I last laughed so much while reading/listening to a book.\n\nConnect with me!\n\nInstagram\n\nMy Blog\n\nThe StoryGraph\n\nApril 26, 2023\n\nIn a Nutshell: Great as a dramedy; decent as a mystery. Straddles well the thin line between being comical and being stereotypical. Entertaining but predictable.\n\nStory Synopsis:\n\nVera Wong is a sixty-year-old teashop owner in San Francisco, and like every Asian mom, she is an expert not just in tea brewing. She loves her son Tilly though he doesn‚Äôt have time for her, and she stays updated about everything from ‚Äúthe Google.‚Äù\n\nWhen she wakes up one morning to find a dead man in the middle of her teashop, Vera knows that she can do a much better job than the police at catching the killer. Within a couple of days, Vera has her list of suspects ready. Now to nab the culprit!\n\nThe story comes to us in the third person perspective of Vera and her various ‚Äúsuspects‚Äù.\n\nHere‚Äôs what you need to know about the goods and the not-so-goods of this work:\n\nüëâ The title and blurb support the idea that the book will be a murder mystery. It is so, but not primarily. The main genre is more like contemporary drama or women‚Äôs fiction, with a strong found-family trope. Going into this expecting a mystery novel, even a cosy mystery, would be disappointing. (It doesn‚Äôt help that the ‚Äòmystery‚Äô is fairly guessable at the halfway mark.)\n\nüëâ Vera Wong is a force unto herself. Basically, she carries the whole story on her shoulders. She is opinionated and loving, funny and interfering. She considers herself perfect and knowledgeable; whether she is or not is another matter. As such, there are many times when she will get on your nerves. Your enjoyment of the book will depend on how you can accept this bulldozer of a woman who shoves away anything that stands in her path, either with fondness or with force, or sometimes, even with food. I am still trying to decide how I felt about her ‚Äì she was equal parts adorable and aggravating.\n\nüëâ As a Chinese immigrant to the US, Vera‚Äôs character includes quite a lot of ‚ÄôAsian Mom‚Äô tropes. These can be seen as either funny or clich√©d, depending on your approach to the representation. (I remember this same issue with Counterfeit by Kirsten Chen; what I took as satirical was taken by some other readers as insulting.) However, this book doesn‚Äôt laugh at Vera, but laughs with her. I think the rep was spot on. (I am an Asian mom, so I can say this with some authentic authority. üòâ)\n\nüëâ The rest of the characters are diverse as well. We have an Indian and an Indonesian too. The Indian rep was spot on. A welcome change. (I think the Indonesian one would also be authentic as the author is an Indonesian.)\n\nüëâ There are many humorous scenes in the book when Vera is around. I especially loved Vera‚Äôs comments about the Chinese-French patisserie. On entertainment value, the book rates quite high.\n\nüëâ All the ‚Äúsuspects‚Äù get enough shared space under the spotlight. At the same time, their arcs are mostly predictable, and their personalities are typical goody-goody pushover kinds. A layered portrayal would have added to the mystery factor. (Coming to think of it, there was just one negative character in the whole book, and even that portrayal was one-noted.)\n\nüëâ There is a child character who was quite sweet. I felt quite sorry for her as none of the adults in her life, except Vera, seemed to know how to handle her. That said, the child‚Äôs behaviour and her speech didn‚Äôt seem age-appropriate. I think she was written as a two-year-old just to avoid plot elements about school [thus making it easy to always have her around when needed], but she never sounded like children aged two usually do.\n\nThe audiobook experience:\n\nThe audiobook, clocking at 10 hrs 41 min, is narrated by Eunice Wong. She was outstanding! Right from the emotions to the character voices to the overall vibes, she narrated the audiobook to perfection. I‚Äôd definitely recommend the audio version as a great way of experiencing this book. Even with multiple characters, the writing doesn‚Äôt make the plot confusing, so it could be a great option for audio newbies too.\n\nBasically, this is a book you read for sheer, straightforward entertainment. The storyline is mostly guessable, so it is the characters, especially Vera, that will make or break your experience. I wish the book could have included some surprises as well, but that wasn‚Äôt to be. Still, it's a fun novel, not to be taken seriously.\n\n3.75 stars.\n\nMy thanks to HarperCollins UK Audio and NetGalley for the ALC of ‚ÄúVera Wong‚Äôs Unsolicited Advice for Murderers‚Äù. This review is voluntary and contains my honest opinion about the audiobook.\n\n‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî\n\nConnect with me through:\n\nMy Blog | The StoryGraph | Instagram | Facebook | Twitter\n\nJuly 30, 2023\n\nThis was everything I wanted the recent glut of books featuring elderly female sleuths to be, but wasn‚Äôt.\n\nBut THIS book? It was delightful!\n\n4.5 stars\n\nVera is the owner of a tea shop in San Francisco‚Äôs Chinatown, and lives a regimented life. Until the morning a dead body is found in her shop‚Ä¶.\n\nKnowing she‚Äôll do a better job than the police possibly could ‚Äì because nobody sniffs out a wrongdoing quite like a suspicious Chinese mother with time on her hands ‚Äì Vera decides it‚Äôs up to her to catch the killer.\n\nVera narrows the suspect list and inserts herself into their lives, changing them (and her) in ways that are unexpected. There are secrets of course, and Vera is determined to uncover them. But for me, the mystery and the secrets take a backseat to Vera herself. She is the star of this story and the one that kept my AirPods glued to my ears.\n\nVera is bold, straight forward, and pulls no punches when she voices her opinions and meddles in the younger generation‚Äôs lives, which provides much of the humor in this novel. I found myself laughing out loud more than once.\n\nI adored Vera and I want a Vera in my life. Plus, she cooks amazing dishes for her ‚Äúsuspects‚Äù and the descriptions made my mouth water.\n\nThis is not my usual genre and I found it to be utterly delightful, especially on audio. I‚Äôm not sure I would have enjoyed it as much in print because hearing her voice on audio with perfect comedic timing, was perfect.\n\nHeartwarming and charming this is one I highly recommend. I hope this isn‚Äôt the last we hear from Vera.\n\nMarch 13, 2023\n\nJesse Q. Sutanto‚Äôs fascinating new cozy mystery, Vera Wong‚Äôs Unsolicited Advice for Murderers , features Vera Wong as an amateur sleuth. She‚Äôs a widow with one son who she doesn‚Äôt get to see very often. Vera lives above her dilapidated teashop in San Francisco. One morning she goes downstairs and finds a dead man in the middle of her shop with a flash drive in his outstretched hand. After calling the police, she takes the flash drive and hides it in her apron pocket. Vera is positive she can do a better job than the police can in discovering who killed the man on the floor. She feels she only needs to investigate the people who come to her shop after the murder and she will discover the killer.\n\nVera is lonely, inquisitive, intelligent, fiery, bold, and funny. She has very set ideas on how an older generation should be treated and lets others know if they don‚Äôt meet her expectations. The main supporting characters are Riki Herwanto, Sana Singh, Oliver Chen, Julia Chen, and Emma Chen. Their character angles lent focus, originality, and depth. The characters‚Äô natures and backstories are shown using action, not just descriptive prose.\n\nTold from five points of view, the novel gives readers extra insights into Vera, Julia, Riki, Sana, and Oliver. Amazingly, this did not cause pacing issues. Vera remains the focal point; ordering her suspects around as she gets to know them and their secrets. This relieves her boredom and gets her to enjoy life again. However, will she find the killer?\n\nThe story brilliantly captured the characters and the cultural lifestyles and traditions of the group. The plot has some twists and turns, but this story is about more than solving a mystery. Threads include found family, family relationships, loneliness, boredom, jealousy, personal boundaries, and regret, as well as generational differences and expectations.\n\nDiverse characterization and great world-building details made this a fast and enjoyable read. I kept wondering what Vera would uncover next and how that would affect the story line. There are multiple believable suspects with motives to kill the man found in Vera‚Äôs shop. The joy of food, tea, and friendship are interwoven with the investigation into alibis and motives.\n\nIf you‚Äôre looking for an entertaining, heartwarming, lighthearted, and funny cozy mystery with a mature protagonist, I highly recommend this novel. I am looking forward to reading more books by this author. I would love to see a series featuring Vera.\n\nBerkley Publishing Group and Jesse Q. Sutanto provided a complimentary digital ARC of this novel via NetGalley. All thoughts and opinions expressed in this review are my own. Publication date is currently set for March 14, 2023. This review was originally posted at Mystery and Suspense Magazine.\n\n-----------------------------------------\n\nMy 4.05 rounded to 4 stars review is coming soon.\n\nApril 28, 2023\n\n4.5 stars, rounded up\n\nFor those in need of a murder mystery filled with more humor than angst, check out Vera Wong‚Äôs Unsolicited Advice for Murderers.\n\nVera runs Vera Wang‚Äôs World Famous Tea Shop and no, that‚Äôs not a misspelling. When she finds a dead body in the shop early one morning, she‚Äôs expecting the full police treatment, just like in one of the tv shows. But the police aren‚Äôt nearly as convinced it‚Äôs murder as she is. So, of course, Vera feels compelled to begin her own investigation.\n\nVera is a wonderful main character. Her son doesn‚Äôt pay her the attention she deserves, maybe because she still wants to run his life and find him a wife. She has a knack for brewing the perfect cup of tea for each specific person. And she is full of opinions and not afraid of butting her nose into others‚Äô lives. As someone who thinks of Chinese mothers as ‚ÄúTiger Moms‚Äù, Vera provided me with a more nuanced, well rounded version.\n\nThis is a surprisingly heartwarming story. Yes, it‚Äôs a murder mystery, but the murder isn‚Äôt really the main focus. The story switches between the POV of Vera and her four ‚Äúsuspects‚Äù. Sutanto has developed the perfect backstory for each suspect and I loved how they all came together.\n\nThe story isn‚Äôt fast paced, but I was engaged throughout. I figured out who the murderer was early on. But even then, there was a twist I didn‚Äôt see coming.\n\nI listened to this and Eunice Wong was the perfect narrator. She could differentiate the voices and has one of the few child‚Äôs voices that doesn‚Äôt grate on my nerves.\n\nMay 11, 2023\n\nVera Wong is a 60 year old busybody, tea shop owner/ tea pusher) and amateur sleuth.\n\nVera was such a great character. She was determined to solve the crime that took place in her tea shop and goes all out in her investigations. She gives herself pep talks and seems to seek out all the drama. She even keeps her own little murder notebook. She is a bit of a bother to Officer Gray who calls her CSI educated and wishes she would go away let her handle the case!\n\nVera was described as an elderly, frail \"old lady\" , but I thought she was energetic and lively!\n\nThis one is on the lighter/cozy side, but beware there is a bit of swearing if that bothers you (not squeaky clean).\n\nI was anxious to learn who the killer was and who would solve the case, but the journey and following Vera along the way is what kept me reading! The tea shop setting was also a plus.\n\nThanks Libby for the listen! Narrated by Eunice Wong/ 10 hours, 41 min\n\nJune 29, 2024\n\n5/5 ‚≠êÔ∏è Omg I had the BEST time reading this book! Vera had me cracking up every other page. I absolutely adored her! I loved how she was always cooking entire feasts for everyone! It reminded me a little bit of my own mom and grandmother ü•π. This was also really heartwarming and sweet. I liked how the unsolved murder brought all characters together in such a clever way. Now I can‚Äôt wait to read more books by this author! üíñ\n\nIf you‚Äôre looking for a feel good and funny story with some found family and a little bit of a mystery, then I highly recommend this one!\n\n‚ÄùOnly those who are so privileged can make right decision all the time. The rest of us, we have to struggle, keep afloat.‚Äù\n\nJune 3, 2023\n\nI heard this was a funny mystery full of complex, lovable characters with a heartwarming family.\n\nI heard I would salivate over the many descriptions of food.\n\nI heard that it would be light and fun and that I would laugh out loud.\n\nI heard I would cry and fall in love with the characters.\n\nI lasted a few pages. I think. I couldn't concentrate. I thought it was silly. It was a DNF for me. I am probably the only one who felt this way.\n\nApril 23, 2023\n\nOnly finished because I had to for book club. Somehow the 60 year old main character came off more like an 80 year old, and the 2 year old character was talking about inflation üòµ‚Äçüí´. No character depth or development. Cheesy and unrealistic storylines. Cringey, forced dialogue between characters. It was just all around bad. The whole book came off as super juvenile and cheesy, and I couldn‚Äôt stop rolling my eyes.\n\nApril 7, 2023\n\nGrab an egg roll and a cup of matcha tea and settle in for an adorable heart-warming cozy mystery!\n\nWelcome to Vera Wang‚Äôs World Famous Tea House. No, not that Vera Wang. This tea shop is owned by savvy business woman, VERA WONG. Her store used to be the talk of Chinatown. However, now she just has one regular customer. On her own since the death of her husband and without the support of her successful son, Vera must keep the shop running. When she awakes to find a dead man in her store, she is determined to catch his murderer. Befriending a group of suspects and wooing them with her delicious homemade Chinese food, Vera vows to uncover the truth behind the murder. Who killed Marshall?\n\nI listened to the audiobook, which is read by Eunice Wong. I highly recommend listening to this one, as Wong‚Äôs representation of Vera is terrific! Vera is hilarious and her chapters were my favorite.\n\nThis character driven cozy mystery is very predictable and over the top. However, I was still rooting for all of the suspects to be innocent. Vera‚Äôs mouthwatering food really made this book shine and had me craving a Chinese feast. Ayah! Don‚Äôt read this book on an empty stomach!\n\nI hope that this is a start to a new series, as I would gladly read more about Vera and her new friends!\n\n3.5/5 stars rounded up\n\nNovember 2, 2023\n\nUnfortunately, I can officially say that Jesse Q. Sutanto's books are not for me. I honestly don't know what I was thinking picking this up, I gave both Dial A for Aunties and Four Aunties and a Wedding 2 stars... but this cover was so cute, I had to give her one last chance.\n\nThis is a very character-driven story. Vera, the main character, who is a 60-year-old widow and tea shop owner, turned amateur detective, was very witty, however, her \"I'm just an old lady I can do whatever I want\" pushiness got old fast. The supporting characters were interesting enough, however, the plot was so weak that the characters didn't make up for it. I was waiting the entire time to figure out who had murdered Marshall in Vera's tea shop and it was underwhelming to say the least. It was \"solved\" in the last 2 chapters, and they briefly mentioned a trial but gave no real closure. There was way too many pop culture references, especially TikTok, which really wrecks the longevity of the book in my opinion.\n\nI think one of the fundamental problems with Sutanto's books is that they are marketed wrong. For example, the blurb about Jesse at the back of this book described Dial a for Aunties as \"women's fiction\" and that is (in my opinion) entirely wrong. all 3 of her books have also been described as thrillers which couldn't be further from the truth. I really think they should all be labeled as young adult/humour. It is safe to say I will not be picking up her next book, however, I do think there is an audience out there for Sutanto's books, it is just not me.\n\nRead my reviews for Jesse Q. Sutanto's books here:\n\nDial A For Aunties - 2 stars\n\nFour Aunties and a Wedding - 2 stars\n\nThe Good, the Bad, and the Aunties - 2 stars (Release date: March 26th, 2024)\n\nVera Wong's Unsolicited Advice for Murderers - 2 stars\n\nMarch 27, 2023\n\nVera Wong is a quirky, humorous lady who is comfortable in her own skin and isn‚Äôt afraid to speak her mind. She enjoys micromanaging her son‚Äôs life and sticking her nose where some say it shouldn‚Äôt belong, but I for one am glad that she does, as it brought us this delightful book! To be honest, I think the mystery took a bit of a backseat to the other aspects of this novel, especially since I had a hard time buying that the murderer would do what they did and why, but what a delight watching Vera bring together this list of suspects and somehow connect them all in a way that they never would have imagined. If you‚Äôre looking for a cozy mystery full of heart and chuckles, this one is it!\n\n*Many thanks to the publisher for providing my review copy.\n\nDecember 20, 2022\n\n‚ú® \"Because nobody sniffs out wrongdoing quite like a Chinese mother with time on her hands.\"\n\nSaying that I'm obsessed with this book might be an understatement. I simply loved everything about it! Just a couple of pages in and I was howling with laughter and less than 24 hours later, I was sad to reach the last page. It was such an enjoyable and flawless read that I never wanted it to end.\n\nI adored all the characters, especially Vera! She reminds me so much of my mother, who is similarly very diligent in trying to keep up with the latest lingo and can whip up a mean lion's head üòÇ I'm Chinese and nothing thrills me more in novels than accurate cultural representation + characters that I see myself in. As always, the author has nailed all of these perfectly.\n\nTruly, there is nothing I didn't love about this heartwarming, captivating and highly bingeable book even though I guessed whodunit quite early on (but not the why).\n\nI've said this before and I'll say this again: Jesse Q Sutanto never misses, regardless of what genre or age group she writes for. She has completely stolen my heart with Vera Wong's Unsolicited Advice for Murderers, now one of my favorite cozy mysteries and found family stories ever! ‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nThank you Berkley Publishing for the Netgalley ARC.\n\nMarch 22, 2023\n\n\"What the----?\" the first officer mutters. \"Hey, ma'am, who drew the outline around the deceased?\"\n\n\"Ah.\" Vera swells with pride. They have noticed just how helpful and resourceful Vera is. \"I do it. I save you some work.\"\n\nAnd, that's when I fell in love with Vera Wong, the ever-helpful, ever-meddling, matchmaking, comfort-food baking, tea brewing dynamo. I loved this story of Vera's wacky and ingenious attempts to figure out who murdered the man she found lying on the floor of her tea room. She's a hoot, and this novel was pure fun from beginning to end.\n\n\"This is the correct reaction to this tea,\" Vera says, taking a sip. \"It is very rare, all my teas are rare, you know, and when it is picked, the farmers sob because the fragrance is so beautiful it reminds them of the celestial gardens in heaven.\"\n\n\"Really?\" Oliver sniffles, fighting to get his emotions under control.\n\nVera shrugs. \"I don't know, I made it up. Americans like it when I tell them stories about each type of tea.\" Her accent becomes stronger, more exaggerated. \"Oh, this tea, from Fujian Province in China, is guarded by a golden dragon that fly above the fields.\" She cocks an eyebrow at him. \"See? Convincing, eh?\"\n\nJune 9, 2024\n\nI spotted this one on the New Books shelf at my library and just had to read it. Who could resist that title!\n\nVera Wong is an older Chinese woman who lives over her Tea Shop in an Asian district of San Francisco. She is a widow, her adult son hardly ever answers her calls, she has only one regular customer in the shop each day and she is lonely. Then one morning she gets up and discovers a dead body on the shop floor.\n\nVera decides to investigate the murder herself and so the fun begins. As the story progresses, we meet all the suspects and Vera gets to know them all really well, at the same time finding herself a whole new 'family' and a real purpose in life. Vera is a huge character who you have to love despite her constant interference in everyone's lives.\n\nThe story is told from five points of view and is very funny indeed. The mystery takes second place to the development of relationships between the five main characters, but it is still an intriguing one and I was totally unable to guess 'who dunnit'. The answer when it came was a complete surprise to me.\n\nAltogether a very entertaining way to spend a few hours on a Sunday afternoon thanks to my excellent local library.\n\nRead\n\nMarch 20, 2023\n\nA very enjoyable cosy mystery, in which an elderly Chinese widow living a rather lonely (but doggedly determined) life in the US finds a dead body in her teahouse and decides to solve the mystery, mostly for something to do. In the process, she turns most of the suspects into a found family.\n\nVery amusing caper, with some horrible and many difficult people, and sharp edges but a kind, open heart. I do like a murder where we don't have to regret the murderee's passing in the slightest.\n\nJune 12, 2023\n\nVera Wong‚Äôs Unsolicited Advice for Murderers was hilarious! A fun story and even more entertaining as an audiobook!\n\nVera Wong is a 60 year old Chinese tea shop owner in San Francisco. She is well-versed in internet research and slang, frequently working it in when the opportunity presents itself, like referencing ‚Äúslipping and sliding into DMs.‚Äù\n\nVera is also a busybody and when she finds a dead body in her tea shop, she first outlines the area around it with a Sharpie and expresses disappointment when the (regular) police arrive on the scene, unaccompanied by CSI. Vera knows she‚Äôll do a better job investigating the murder than the police will, so she makes it her business to get involved, befriending the various suspects in order to help solve the mystery. But Vera gets to know each of the suspects, she grows to like them and hopes she is wrong about their involvement in the murder.\n\nThough I‚Äôd more than likely find Vera at least somewhat annoying in real life if I was one of the other characters in this book, I found the story very entertaining and know she was well-intentioned. Eunice Wong did a wonderful job narrating the audiobook. This is a comedic mystery with themes of friendship and found family.\n\nNovember 25, 2023\n\nThis book is definitely one of my favorites that I have read this year! I loved everything about it! I love Vera Wong and her love of CSI and Law and Order and tea which I happen to share with her. I love all of the wonderful teas that she created. I love the found family that Vera had in the book. There‚Äôs so many funny and sad and sweet moments in the book. I also love the amazing food that Vera cooks for everyone. I love the mystery and how Vera was able to solve the crime. Also, I had something that I thought would trigger me and while I can‚Äôt go into it because it is a bit of a spoiler I wound up not being bothered by it.\n\nMay 15, 2023\n\nAn example of a book I would never revisit.\n\nI didn‚Äôt hate it, but I didn‚Äôt love it either. This is the problem! This book didn‚Äôt inspire any strong feelings in me.\n\nVera Wong is cute in places. It‚Äôs wholesome, but it also feels strangely out of place. Is this novel trying to be a cozy mystery, or is it trying to be a found family story? Is this a dramedy or is it a tragedy?\n\nLet‚Äôs start from the beginning:\n\nVera Wong is the proprietor of a down and out tea shop in China town. She has a son that doesn‚Äôt respond to her texts or take much interest in his Chinese heritage. She‚Äôs lonely, and has one customer per day.\n\nUntil she finds a dead body in her shop!\n\nOverbearing Vera decides to get to the bottom of this, even if the police don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs suspicious.\n\nVera finds four suspects: Julia, Olivia, Riki, and Sana.\n\nNow, this is where things get a little bit off the rails for me.\n\nDo these people find Vera‚Äôs accusations accusatory? Nope! They all become fast friends, almost like a found family. Sure, because I‚Äôd love to hang out with potential Murderers and the strange woman accusing me of murder.\n\n*I think this concept could have worked if it was over a longer period of time, but as it stands the plot occurs only over the span of a week or two. It‚Äôs all very fast (and yet the book is sooo long!)\n\nIt was like one of my least favorite tropes: insta love, but instead insta family.\n\nNow the good: the beginning is the strongest part of the story, it sucks you in and makes you want to keep reading. The ending twist I also was surprised by, and was glad it wasn‚Äôt completely predictable.\n\nSutanto writes SCRUMPTIOUS SUMPTUOUS! scenes around food. She should really play to her strengths and include more of this comfort food based writing to more stories. (I‚Äôd love to read about Vera cooking and bringing food to loved ones, a lot more than I loved reading about her murder investigation. Something along the lines of a Becky chambers-esque series involving cooking would be so cozy.)\n\nAnd drum roll‚Ä¶ the bad\n\nUnfortunately I thought the book was all over the place and largely unbelievable. Disbelief I can handle‚Ä¶ but it was also so long that it constantly reminded me that the characters and the plot were behaving in ways I didn‚Äôt find realistic.\n\nI don‚Äôt think the writing is bad. I don‚Äôt think the initial plot is bad. But I do think the author got lost in it. The story meanders, it stumbles.\n\nAnd don‚Äôt get me started on a two year old character speaking on a level more on par with a five year old.\n\nAlso don‚Äôt get me started on the contrived good twin versus evil twin fall in love with the same girl trope. Maybe this just makes me roll my eyes because my husband is a twin and my sister in law is also a twin, but I just think it‚Äôs so cheap. There are better tropes.\n\nInitial review: 2.5 stars. I‚Äôve decided to round down. I objectively don‚Äôt think this is a bad book, and I do think it will work for others, but for me this story didn‚Äôt work. I have too many issues with the construction.\n\nSeptember 5, 2023\n\n4.5 stars!\n\nThis is the kind of cozy mystery book I absolutely adore.\n\nVera Wong runs a tea shop in Chinatown, San Francisco. Her son has grown up and rarely calls or visits and her husband passed away. With a dwindling customer base, Vera doesn't have much to occupy her time. Until one morning she walks into her tea shop and discovers a dead body. Vera doesn't like the way the police are investigating, she begins her own investigation and integrates herself into the daily life of her suspects.\n\nI adored this book so much, there's just something really cute about a pushy older woman getting her way to the surprise of everyone around them. The side characters were all interesting in their own ways and well developed, I never got bored of any one of their personal stories or perspectives. One of the best parts were all the descriptions of the food Vera made, everything sounded delicious and I was beyond hungry listening to the audiobook. I was riveted until the end, with a slightly rough beginning to the story. But overall I can see myself recommending this to many people, it's a comfort read.\n\nMarch 16, 2023\n\n3.5 stars rounded up. What worked for me - the quirky characters with heart & the charming San Fran Chinatown tea shop setting. And what didn‚Äôt - the ‚Äúmurder mystery‚Äù itself - the perpetrator was very obvious & just too simple & too long in explanation. Still, loved the MC & secondary characters, and the off-beat fun of this one."
