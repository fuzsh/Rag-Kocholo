        "text": "By Ruth Rendell\n\nFirst published: UK: Hutchinson, 1983; US: Pantheon, 1983\n\nOver the last four decades, between Chief Inspector Wexford’s visit in China and mine own in December, China has transformed radically.\n\nThe country that Ruth Rendell describes in The Speaker of Mandarin, set in 1980, is pre-industrialised and undeveloped (as, say, Vietnam was a decade ago). Peasants work in fields with water-buffalo; men carry live pigs on motorbikes, or pull carts laden with concrete blocks; breakfasts are unpalatable and rancid; and those few Westerners who go there are led by relentless guides to see Maoist sites, porcelain factories and teacher training colleges, and dubbed Charlie Chaplin films.\n\nForty-three years later, the China that I saw was confident and modern. Robots clean hotels; cities are full of malls and Michelin-starred cafés; high-speed rail whisks travellers two thousand km in a day; science museums boast of Chinese investment in clean technology and its space program. (And, what’s more, Shanghai theatre companies stage Agatha Christie’s plays, and Hong Kong holds lectures on the music of Berlioz.) China believes this will be the Chinese century.\n\nOf course, it is also a surveillance state, and much of that amazing technology is used to monitor citizens and suppress the ‘seven unmentionables’, including civil liberties and freedom of the press. Nor do many locals speak English, even in hotels, unlike in other Asian countries; phone translation is vital. (I did, however, hold a two-hour conversation with a Beijing taxi driver that way.) But it is a fascinating country.\n\nWexford and I visited different parts of China, so unfortunately, I could not compare travel notes. I visited Shanghai, Xitang, Xi’an, the Great Wall (covered in snow, in winter – we had it to ourselves!), Beijing, and Hong Kong. Wexford went to Changsha, where Mao converted to Communism, and up the Li River to Guilin (Kweilin), with its magnificent limestone mountains.\n\nIt is, as often with detectives, a busman’s holiday. Wexford, drinking endless cups of tea, enduring humidity and sleeplessness, is pursued across China by the spectre of a woman with bound feet. Aboard a boat, a man is drowned – but, as one tourist remarks with indifference: “Not one of us. A Chinese.” (There is an undercurrent of racism to Rendell’s depiction of China: the ‘aflaid you be solly’ pidgin English of Wexford’s ‘slant-eyed’ guide is awfully dated for 1983.)\n\nSome months after Wexford’s return to Kingsmarkham, a member of the tour party is killed: Adela Knighton is shot through the back of the head on the one night of the year her husband, Adam, was away.\n\nBy the 1980s, bizarre murders and brilliant deductions had largely disappeared; Rendell’s murders tend to be rather nondescript, and her detection unassuming police procedurals. Her psychological thrillers excelled at slow-burn tension, a concatenation of small events building up to catastrophe; the Wexfords, on the other hand, often are merely slow and plodding.\n\nIndeed, this does not seem to be much of a mystery: it is apparent early on that Knighton is the likeliest culprit, indeed the only viable suspect. The Knightons’ was an unhappy marriage, and his behaviour, Wexford recognises, is that of a guilty man.\n\nSPOILER WARNING\n\nIt is, though, a notable example of misdirection, of forcing the reader to stare where the writer wants him to look: at the unhappy marriage of the Knightons, at his encounter decades after their parting with the woman he loved and lost. Knighton, we learn, is one of Rendell’s fantasists, enmeshed “in fantasy, in dreams” [Ch. 19] to his own destruction. “Men like Knighton had better not commit crimes even vicariously, they had better not be involved in crimes they imagine they have committed vicariously.”\n\nAnother twist reveals an unsuspected murderer. From a technical perspective, it is adroit. But it is by no means as effective an instance of misdirection as, say, Wolf to the Slaughter (1967), the best of her early books. I find that solutions where a minor character is identified as the killer to be unsatisfactory: the criminal is not sufficiently in the foreground; we do not know them well, so the revelation feels arbitrary. (See, for instance, Christie’s Appointment with Death.) It’s easy to see why Rendell tired of puzzle plots; this sort of solution is not based in character.\n\nWorse, most of the book becomes a red herring – including the trip to China itself. As Wexford remarks: “It’s all as clear as glass. I should have seen it from the start; only China intruded, China and what went on there confused me…”\n\nTellingly, for the past quarter of a century, I remembered the false, ‘obvious’ solution (ROT13 gung Xavtugba nfxrq n tengrshy pebbx gb ohzc bss uvf jvsr), not the twist. (Fbzrubj, gur vzntr bs Xavtugba evatvat hc gb fcrnx gur jbeq ‘Znaqneva’ fghpx va zl zrzbel.)\n\nNotes\n\n1984 Arrow\n\n46 and 54: F. Marion Crawford’s “The Upper Berth” (in which a traveller at sea finds a drowned corpse, or the ghost of a drowned corpse, in the upper berth of his cabin)\n\n70: Edgar Allan Poe’s “Tell-Tale Heart”\n\n73: W. Somerset Maugham’s “The End of the Flight”\n\n75: M. R. James’s “Count Magnus”\n\n165–66: Sheridan Le Fanu’s “Green Tea”\n\nReviews\n\nThe Observer (Christopher Wordsworth, 6th February 1983): Chief Inspector Wexford finds himself beyond his wildest dreams in China, on official liaison to the government but free for a guided tour of the flowery kingdom with a group of English tourists. Sweaty nights, pitfalls of language and cuisine, deep potations of green tea induce hallucinations – or are they? The same recurring crone with bound feet wherever he goes, a weird sense of déjà vu. Miss Rendell, who includes in her nonpareil repertoire the ability to reduce the exotic and outré to common clay, and to touch the most ordinary human situation with strange bale-fires, turns the whole China episode into a brilliant piece of exhumation as Wexford assembles out of his contused and swirling memories the clues to a crime of Chinese-box complexity.\n\nThe Daily Mirror (George Thaw, 17th February 1983): Double ‘tec – Or how to make crime pay twice\n\nCrime fiction fans have a double cause for celebration.\n\nTop crime writer Ruth Rendell has published a hardback AND a paperback in the same week. The hardback The Speaker of Mandarin features her old hero, Chief Inspector Wexford. Crime and death dog him all the way from China to quiet Kingsmarkham, his home patch.\n\nIt is a meticulous and clever story. You remember the places and feel for the characters. Crime writing at its best.\n\nThe paperback, Master of the Moor is a brilliant psychological thriller about a killer who stalks the Yorkshire moors. Twists and turns keep the reader guessing.\n\nThe Guardian (Matthew Coady, 10th March 1983): An official visit to China for Ruth Rendell’s exurban Chief Inspector Wexford and its murderous Home Counties sequel are as warp and weft in The Speaker of Mandarin.\n\nThe foreign trip, the miscellaneous tourists, the artfully described, apparently pivotal, incident which misdirects attention, irresistibly echo Dame Agatha. True, coincidence works overtime but it is handled with insouciance by a writer who takes the business of fooling the customer with the seriousness it merits. If the solution doesn’t wholly satisfy it is not because the reader is likely to anticipate it, but because Ms Rendell has been almost too cunning. For all that, here’s richness. It would be churlish to complain.\n\nTimes Literary Supplement (T. J. Binyon, 13th May 1983): Chief Inspector Wexford, a member of a team invited by the Chinese government to China to advise on crime prevention and detention, takes a couple of weeks of his annual holiday and stays on to see the sights. He joins up with an odd group of English tourists, is slightly troubled by hallucinations (readers of Le Fanu will guess why) and comes back to England to find the corpse of one of his fellow tourists in his own bailiwick. An elegant book, beautifully put together, full of real people, living in real surroundings, and with, as a bonus, a handsomely dovetailed plot. But there seems a distinct difference – not so much in quality as in texture – between the novel of the first half, with Wexford staggering round China in the intense heat, drinking gallons of tea, and troubled by the constant intrusion into his vision of little old ladies with bound feet, and the detective story of the second half.\n\nKirkus (1st September 1983): Like the last Inspector Wexford mystery, Death Notes, this new Rendell novel is less an earnest mystery-story (like early Wexford) than a sly, teasing entertainment – with twists galore, subtly winking salutes to A. Christie, and an improvisatory feel that never slips over into archness or parody. The first section here takes Wexford to China for a pseudo-business-trip vacation; and Rendell (no doubt just back from a tour herself) concentrates on a funny, warts-and-all travelogue as Wexford hooks up with a disgruntled tour-group on his way to Hong Kong via Canton. But odd things do occur, with hints of Orient Express, The Mirror Crack’d, Death on the Nile: a Chinese student drowns; an ancient Chinese woman seems to be following Wexford; there’s tension among the English travellers. Then, suddenly, we’re back in England – and who should turn up murdered in her posh home but one of Wexford’s China-tour acquaintances, Mrs. Adela Knighton, wife of a retired lawyer! And Wexford starts looking up all his fellow-travellers – quizzing them about the Knightons, unearthing an array of secrets, solving those tour-mysteries as well as the murder. Less tight and polished than Death Notes, with a ho-hum fadeout – but a disarming, fairly irresistible blend of mini-puzzles, solid detection, splendid travel writing, and Wexford charm.\n\nOther reviews:"
