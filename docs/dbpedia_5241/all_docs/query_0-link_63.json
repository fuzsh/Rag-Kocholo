The Green Mandarin plans to take over the world and breed a more perfect human race. \"Unlike the hackneyed space operas which comprised most of Hughes's work in 1950-1951, THE GREEN MANDARIN MYSTERY is a scientific detective story . A somewhat clich√©d but fast-moving story, superior to anything else that Hughes wrote during this period.\" - Harbottle and Holland. Reginald 09585. Harbottle and Holland A266. Title leaf stuck to cover near gutter margin by a dribble of errant binder's glue, else a fine copy. Scarce. (#151328) - RAY ELLIS IN THE GREEN MANDARIN MYSTERY by Grant Malcom [pseudonym]",
