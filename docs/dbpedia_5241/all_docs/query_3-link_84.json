        "text": "There's no need to rehash the Mandarin twist story from Iron Man 3 because you should know it by now. What you may not know is Marvel Studios took the Mandarin for another twist in the One-Shot All Hail The King. Starring Sir Ben Kingsley as Trevor Slattery the short film, which was included with the Thor: The Dark World Blu Ray, revealed the real Mandarin is still out there... and he's pissed off at Trevor for posing as the Mandarin.\n\nOr is he?\n\nKingsley has throw his own twist into the theories surrounding the Mandarin. The actor spoke with IGN and discussed the Marvel villain, who is becoming an intriguing, unknown variable in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU).\n\n\"Has the Mandarin invented Trevor, or has Trevor invented the Mandarin? Which is which?\" Kingsley asks. \"The Mandarin could be so supremely intelligent that he could have said, 'You know what? I'll invent this actor, and he will be my mask.' You know, which is which? Who's pulling the strings. Now, this is me just free-thinking here, but I would love to revisit that world. But Trev, bless him, may have made an indelible mark on that world. So everyone might say, 'Is it Trev under there?' So they'd have to approach it quite carefully, and so would I, but I would love to go back to that world, yeah.\"\n\nEither Kingsley knows EXACTLY what is happening with the Mandarin and Trevor in the MCU or he is really is free-thinking. But if it's the latter, he seems to have thought about the role a lot. He also told IGN that he would love to return to the MCU. Kingsley says, \"it's up to the powers that be to decide whether or not they'd want to introduce Trevor, whether or not they'd want to reintroduce the Mandarin.\"\n\nThe mystery of the Mandarin continues..."
