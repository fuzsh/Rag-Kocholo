        "text": "Reading Chinese poetry and immersing yourself in the culture is a great way to learn the language. Read on as we share our pick of famous Chinese poems, ranging from Chinese farewell poems to Chinese poems about love.\n\nSince ancient times, humans the world over have memorized and recited poetry. Amongst other benefits, it’s a popular method for learning a new language, and one we wholeheartedly stand behind! By reading out loud or listening to poems being recited, you can quickly master the rhythms and pronunciations of words and phrases, gain confidence in your speaking, and connect with the cultural heritage of the poet.\n\nLuckily for us, Chinese poetry is – more often than not – concise, which means it’s far more digestible than some of its Western counterparts (we’re looking at you, Tennyson!). It also means that you can set manageable goals such as a poem a day! We’ve shared below three of our team’s favourite childhood poems, as well as Chinese poems about love and Chinese farewell poems. We hope you enjoy this list of famous Chinese poems.\n\n3 Chinese Poems All Children Know\n\nIn China, there are a handful of famous Chinese poems that children are taught in the classroom and expected to memorize.

Written by Tang Dynasty poet Li Shen, the poem emphasises how hard each farmers work for every grain of rice, and serves as a gentle reminder for children not to waste their food.\n\n咏鹅 (“An Ode to the Goose”, by Luo Binwang)\n\n鹅、鹅、鹅，\n\n曲项向天歌。\n\n白毛浮绿水，\n\n红掌拨清波\n\nTRANSLATION\n\nGoose, goose, goose,\n\nYou bend your neck towards the sky and sing.\n\nYour white feathers float on the emerald water,\n\nYour red feet push the clear waves.\n\nAbout: Written by Tang Dynasty poet Luo Binwang when he was only seven years old, “An Ode to the Goose” is a particularly simple and easy to memorize poem, resulting in it often being one of the very first famous Chinese poems to be learned by Chinese children.\n\nChinese Farewell Poems\n\nSaying goodbye is never easy. Scroll on to discover our team’s pick of Chinese farewell poems.\n\n送杜少府之任蜀州, 王勃 (“Farewell To Vice-Prefect Du Setting Out For His Official Post In Shu”, by Wang Bo)\n\n城阙辅三秦，\n\n风烟望五津。\n\n与君离别意，\n\n同是宦游人。\n\n海内存知己，\n\n天涯若比邻。\n\n无为在岐路，\n\n儿女共沾巾。\n\nTRANSLATION\n\nBy this wall that surrounds the three Qin districts,\n\nThrough a mist that makes five rivers one,\n\nWe bid each other a sad farewell,\n\nWe two officials going opposite ways….\n\nAnd yet, while China holds our friendship,\n\nAnd heaven remains our neighbourhood,\n\nWhy should you linger at the fork of the road,\n\nWiping your eyes like a heart-broken child?\n\nAbout: Written by Wang Bo when his friend Du was set to leave and take the position of country official in Si Chuan. Wang Bo saw off Du and presented him with this farewell poem that represents the sincerity and profoundness of their friendship.\n\n送友人, 李白 (“Farewell to A Friend”, by Li Bai)\n\n青山橫北郭 , 白水遶東城\n\n此地一為別, 孤蓬萬里征\n\n浮雲遊子意, 落日故人情\n\n揮手自茲去, 蕭簫斑馬鳴\n\nTRANSLATION\n\nGreen hills skirt the northern border,\n\nWhite waters gird the eastern town;\n\nHere we part with each other,\n\nAnd you set out like a lonesome wisp of grass,\n\nFloating across the miles, farther and farther away.\n\nYou’ve longed to travel like roaming clouds,\n\nBut our friendship, unwilling to wane as the sun is to set,\n\nLet it be here to stay.\n\nAs we wave each other good-bye,\n\nOur horses neigh, as if for us they sigh.\n\nAbout: Li Bai’s friend longs to travel like ‘roaming clouds’. This Chinese farewell poem uses beautiful metaphors to express the deep connection Li Bai and his friend share through their friendship.\n\n送别, 王维 (“Farewell”, by Wang Wei)\n\n下马饮君酒\n\n问君何所之\n\n君言不得意\n\n归卧南山垂\n\n但去莫复问\n\n白云无尽时\n\nTRANSLATION\n\nDismounted, we drank to bid you farewell.\n\nI asked, “My friend, where are you heading?”\n\nYou said, “Oh, nothing is working my way,\n\nSo be back to the crags of Nanshan, retiring.”\n\n“Go then! You’ll ask of the world no more!\n\nAh, days of endless white clouds, unending!”\n\nAbout:Wang Wei’s friend is feeling dejected and rather than keeping him from leaving he is encouraging him to leave and get some rest, they have drinks to solidify him leaving.\n\n无言独上西楼, 李煜 (“I Climb the Western Tower in Silence”, by Li Yu)\n\n无言独上西楼\n\n月如钩\n\n寂寞梧桐深院\n\n锁清秋\n\n剪不断\n\n理还乱\n\n是离愁\n\n别是一般滋味\n\n在心头\n\nTRANSLATION\n\nWordless, alone, to the West Tower I climb the stair;\n\nThe Moon, like a curved sword, hangs there.\n\nHeld captive in the deep courtyard and its lonesome phoenix tree,\n\nIs the cool, pure Autumn breeze.\n\nCut it, it doesn’t sever;\n\nSort it, as entangled as ever —\n\nIt is a great sorrow to part,\n\nCreating an entirely different feeling in my heart\n\nNotes: Although the first stanza doesn’t openly talk about farewells, the description of the view from the West Tower provides imagery for us to believe so. The desolate courtyard and the lonesome phoenix tree could possibly symbolize Li Yu’s feelings about parting. Describing that although they are parting they are still as connected as ever.\n\n赠别, 杜牧 (“On Parting”, by Du Mu)\n\n多情却似总无情\n\n维觉罇前笑不成\n\n蜡烛有心还惜别\n\n替人垂泪到天明\n\nTRANSLATION\n\nFond are my feelings, yet unfeeling I feign,\n\nBefore our wine-cups, we merry-make in vain.\n\nSo heartful, the candle, our parting it grieves,\n\nAnd in tears it melts, till the sky lights again.\n\nAbout: Although it can’t be confirmed, instead of parting with a friend, Du Mu is parting with a now ex-lover. Saying that even though their love was deep it diminished into nothing, they can’t even fake a friendly smile so the candle weeps for them. This powerful poem expresses the pain in ending a special connection with someone you loved.\n\nChinese Poems About Love\n\nMany of us often struggling to find the words to express how we feel.

Though only fragments of her works survived, she wrote prolifically during her lifetime, usually depicting the lives of girls and women in their boudoirs.\n\n卜算子, 李之儀 (“Song of Divination”, by Li Zhi Yi)\n\n我住长江头，\n\n君住长江尾。\n\n日日思君不见君，\n\n共饮长江水。\n\n此水几时休，\n\n此恨何时已。\n\n只愿君心似我心，\n\n定不负相思意。\n\nTRANSLATION\n\nI live upstream and you downstream,\n\nFrom night to night of you I dream.\n\nUnlike the stream you are not in view,\n\nThough both we drink from River Blue.\n\nWhen will the river no more flow？\n\nWhen will my grief no more grow？\n\nI wish your heart will be like mine，\n\nThen not in vain for you I pine.\n\nAbout: “Song of Divination” talks about separation between lovers and lovesickness, expressed by using the Yangtze river to show the distance between them.\n\nBy listening to and memorizing famous Chinese poems, you can fast-track all four language skills – listening, reading, writing, and speaking.
