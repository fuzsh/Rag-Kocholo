        "text": "Much has been written about the cover Hergé drew in 1936 for The Blue Lotus... On the occasion of International Chinese Language Day on 20th April 2023, we take a closer look at it.\n\nHergé imagined it would be the cover of the fifth story of The Adventures of Tintin: The Blue Lotus, where the reporter with a quiff breaks up an international opium gang trading in China.\n\nHis drawing, 35cm square, in Indian ink, watercolour and gouache, entirely in colour, is stunningly beautiful. It shows Tintin and Snowy hiding in a Ming vase, while a dragon, hunter of evil spirits, protects them. Their looks are intense and the colours stop the time.\n\nThe cartoonist was very proud of the result, especially as The Blue Lotus is a special adventure. Between great adventure, exoticism, echoes of international politics and homage to the Chinese graphic tradition, The Blue Lotus is an essential milestone in Hergé's work and in Tintin's career. After this adventure, both of them never looked at the world as they did before... It is also a true ode to friendship because it features Chang, the only real character to be integrated into the adventures of his young hero - his friend, an encounter that marked him for life.\n\nBut Casterman (the historical publisher of The Adventures of Tintin) rejected the drawing because of the cost of production. Hergé then redid the work, simplified, in line, with Indian ink, before marking his colour indications on tracing paper, which finally gave the version we know so well. The cover originally planned was lost…\n\nBut it is now being brought to light again through the NFT Tintin Collection project.\n\nWhat is behind the cover of The Blue Lotus?\n\nLooking at it more closely, we wondered what the five calligraphic images, (three in Indian ink and two in pencil), on the cover meant?\n\nWe set out on a quest to find their meaning and for this there is nobody better to ask than TCHANG YIFEI Fifi, daughter of Hergé's great friend, Chang Chong-chen.\n\nFirst of all, TCHANG YIFEI Fifi reminds us that this is a cover project. This clarification gives meaning to her second remark: these pictograms probably have no meaning as a title. For that matter, they don't make sense as a sentence, and some of them aren't even Chinese words. Let's explain…\n\nThe daughter of the famous sculptor, thinks that Hergé's aim was probably to give an exotic dimension to the drawing and show that the story takes place in China. Literally, this means nothing because among the five drawings only three exist and yet they don't even go together...\n\nthe first one in Indian ink: fish. Let us note a lack of line since \"fish\" in Chinese is written \"魚\". Indeed, on this drawing a line is missing on the lower part. We will therefore say that the fish has an incomplete tail;\n\nthe second in Indian ink does not exist in Chinese;\n\nthe third in Indian ink: pointed;\n\nthe first in pencil does not exist in Chinese;\n\nthe second in pencil: soldier.\n\nTCHANG YIFEI Fifi admits that her father had told her about this Hergé cover \"Oh he's a great draughtsman, he draws but he doesn't write in a calligraphic manner\".\n\nShe also notes that it is a language of pictograms. Pictograms are drawn signs. They are special in that they are closely related to the reality they represent, unlike ideograms, which also refer to an idea, but without their drawing trying to represent the extralinguistic reality. Therefore, TCHANG YIFEI Fifi, in relation to the cover, points out that the first word in Indian ink, \"fish\", is a strong pictogram, with the shape of a head, a tail, and even scales.\n\nIn Chinese, there are also ideophonograms, where the choice of composition is determined by phonetics.\n\n...Phonetics? Here's a good lead!\n\nIf we go back to the cover, when reading the ideograms from top to bottom in Mandarin, the sound of this reading could be \"Blue Lotus\" (Long -tiew). This opens up the debate: perhaps Hergé used the sound of the words rather than their calligraphy. But it remains forever a mystery..."
