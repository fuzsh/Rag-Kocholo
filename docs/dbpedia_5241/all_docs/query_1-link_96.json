        "text": "Books can transport you anywhere at any given time — they offer us a perspective and experience that we may otherwise never know. Reading books about another person’s culture provides us with a glimpse into someone else’s story. This is integral in encouraging open and accepting minds and hearts in adults and children alike.\n\nMay is Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander Heritage Month. It’s a time to recognize how Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Pacific Islander Americans have contributed to and influenced the history, culture, and achievements of the United States. The month of May was chosen to commemorate the arrival of the first known Japanese immigrant to the United States on May 7, 1843, and to mark the anniversary of the completion of the transcontinental railroad on May 10, 1869. Up to 20,000 of the workers who laid the tracks were Chinese immigrants.\n\nTeaching kids about different cultures helps them appreciate the differences in people and their traditions. It also helps them respect similarities, which will, in turn, help them understand who they are in the context of their own race, ethnic group, culture, religion, language, and familial history.\n\nBelow are a few books written by Asian authors to read this month with children of all ages.
