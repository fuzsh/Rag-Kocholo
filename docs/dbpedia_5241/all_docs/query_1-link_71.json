        "text": "LADY TAN’S CIRCLE OF WOMEN, by Lisa See\n\n“Whether animal or woman, we are a man’s possessions. We women exist to give him heirs and feed, clothe and amuse him. Never forget that,” Respectful Lady instructs our narrator at the beginning of Lisa See’s latest novel, “Lady Tan’s Circle of Women.” This scene, which takes place as mother and daughter endure the anguish of foot binding, sets the tone for the book.\n\nThe subject of See’s novel is Tan Yunxian, a real-life woman who lived in China during the Ming dynasty. She went on to become a “ming yi” — famous doctor — and published a compendium of 31 cases in the work “Miscellaneous Records of a Female Doctor.”\n\nAfter her mother dies from a foot infection, Yunxian finds a new home with her grandparents, who are doctors. Grandmother Ru takes her young ward under her wing, and Yunxian embarks on a medical apprenticeship that will last for years. This is how she meets her first friend, Meiling, who is the daughter of Midwife Shi. From the beginning, the friendship strikes a competitive note; their first game involves racing leaves. Yunxian’s family is privileged and widely respected, while Meiling is destined to follow in her mother’s footsteps. (Midwives are generally looked down upon since they come into contact with “corrupting” blood.)\n\nBecause of their immense class divide, Yunxian and Meiling face formidable challenges. However, the dynamic isn’t given sufficient space to flourish on the page before coming to an abrupt standstill when Yunxian marries into the prosperous Yang family. Even after Yunxian and Meiling reunite, we are meant to take their mutual affection for granted — a leap that becomes increasingly difficult thanks to Meiling’s own ambition and keen awareness of her less privileged background.\n\nGiven the book’s title, it’s no surprise that Yunxian is surrounded by women who are available to help her. On different occasions, her father’s concubine Miss Zhao, her personal maid Poppy, Grandmother Ru, Meiling, Midwife Shi and others appear at her side to offer assistance. Yunxian’s access to this network is fundamentally connected to her family’s status and the protections that come with it.\n\nWhen Midwife Shi loses her reputation, she doesn’t have the same support, and the burden falls mostly on Meiling to come to the aid of her discredited mother. This isn’t to say that Yunxian is immune from danger; her first childbirth nearly proves fatal. But because of Yunxian’s position, the availability of a “circle of women” seems predictable, even obligatory. If anything, much of Yunxian’s journey involves grappling with whether she herself is willing to help other women, especially ones from different backgrounds. When Meiling tells her about a brickyard laborer who needs medical attention, Yunxian replies, “A working woman?”\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
