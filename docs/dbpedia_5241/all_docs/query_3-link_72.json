        "text": "Guests and staffers at the swanky Mandarin Oriental Hotel in Manhattan are baffled by the identity of the mystery jumper who caused a grisly scene by leaping to death from the roof in his pajamas, sources said Friday.\n\n“I am still shocked,” said Louisa Gassab, of Paris, France, who is staying at the five-star hotel in Columbus Circle.\n\n“He was on the ground covered up in a sheet. I saw a part of him on the ground, I don’t know what. When I woke up this morning, I asked the hotel staff what happened but they wouldn’t give me any information,” she said.\n\nThe unidentified man — who does not appear to have been staying in the building or living in its residences — entered the building through a freight elevator and plunged roughly 750 feet at around 9 p.m. Thursday, sources said.\n\nHe hit the hotel entrance’s glass awning on his way down — splitting his body in half from the impact, sources said.\n\nAn arm was found across the street near blood-splattered scaffolding Thursday night, sources added.\n\nBy Friday afternoon, rain had washed the blood away but shattered glass from the awing lay strewn across the sidewalk near 80 Columbus Circle.\n\nThe area was cordoned off with a velvet rope from the hotel, where rooms with Central Park views cost more than $1,195 per night.\n\nPolice had still not identified the 5’10, 200-pound mystery jumper Friday. Staffers told cops they didn’t know who he was, sources said.\n\nThe ritzy hotel is located on the top 19 floors of the 55-story Deutsche Bank Center tower, where celebrities — including Jay-Z and Tom Brady — and other wealthy A-listers own residences."
