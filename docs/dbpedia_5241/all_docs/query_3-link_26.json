        "text": "February 18, 2024\n\nAnother great Quiller book, this one kicking off just two months after The Tango Briefing, (the first Quiller I read a few years ago; I'm obviously reading these way out of sequence).\n\nThe story is set in 1974-75 Hong Kong, towards the very end of the Mao Tse-tung era, and as such presents a nice time-capsule look at the waning days of \"bad China,\" just before Deng Xiao-ping introduced \"good China,\" (which today is sadly veering back towards the \"bad\" side again); back when the only way to physically see China was to take a local bus from Kowloon up through the New Territories to Man Kam Po, then hike through some scrub fields up to a barbed wire \"no man's land\" where you could stare across at some other scrub fields and say to yourself, \"yup - that's China!\" And so this book was particularly fun for me, as not only did I arrive in Taiwan in 1978 (and take my first trip to Hong Kong and the \"yup - there it is\" border in early 1979); but I had also just gotten my dive certification in '75 or '76 - and so I was able to appreciate (and critique) Hall's descriptions of both HK and Quiller's underwater scenes.\n\nAnd in general, I gotta say Hall got most of it right. As with his other Asia-set stories, here again he could have added a lot more local color; but as I've noted before, he probably had neither the time not travel budget to do a lot of on-the-ground research for his more far-flung stories. Overall, he does a good job establishing both the flavor and geography of Hong Kong, even if his surveillance scenes start to sound like those \"The Californians\" sketches on SNL, (\"I took Manzanita down to Olympic, made a right over by the Vons Pavilion, then took that all the way down to Robertson…\"). He did, however, miss a golden opportunity to cover Quiller's arrival at the old Kai Tak airport, which offered one of the most hair-raising landings in the world as it brought you down parallel and so close to the high-rise apartments in Kwun Tong that you could literally look in people's windows and see what they were watching on TV, before landing on a runway so short that if you overshot it (as planes frequently did), you ended up in Kowloon Harbor. And speaking of, said harbor was so famous for its pollution and overall noxiousness that even Bob Hope famously joked about it during a stopover on one of his Vietnam War USO tours.*\n\nAs to the SCUBA scenes - again generally good, although he has Quiller at one point put on his fins before walking down a hall, (something that would NEVER really happen, as the only way to walk in fins is to shuffle backwards); and it was interesting to see Quiller still using a double-hose regulator à la Sean Connery in \"Thunderball\" a full decade earlier, as I thought most divers had switched to the newer single-hose setups by then.\n\nTo the story itself…most Quiller plots involve some sort of MacGuffin that's mainly there to justify the almost non-stop action, (largely fight scenes and car chases). And true to form, it took me until page 230 (out of just 300) here to learn just what the hell the plot of this book was, (which to be fair, was pretty much the same amount of time it took Quiller to figure it too). But from there on, it all DID make some kind of sense…and so overall, another nice read.\n\nHave to comment on Hall's unique writing style. Aside from his famous run-on sentences, he tends to end most of his chapters with a cliffhanger, and then begin the next one well after that particular situation had been resolved, eventually catching readers up as Quiller moves forward. This seems like a tough trick - and probably is - but more often than not Hall pulls it off nicely. He also tends to wrap up his stories quite abruptly, with Quiller still well up shit creek just two pages or so before the end…and then it's bing-bang-boom!, \"mission accomplished\" with absolutely no denouement - which again, sounds odd but usually does work well for both the author and his creation.\n\nOne negative note: Hall's fictional \"Bureau\" is kinda cool, in a goofy, unbelievable Tom Cruise \"Impossible Missions Force\" way. But calling their agents or operatives or whatever \"shadow executives\" is just clunky…\"Shadow Executive\" might in fact work as the title for a single \"Mission: Impossible\" movie, but otherwise it's just downright awkward.\n\nBut still, one of the better Quiller's I've read - and that's saying a lot, because Hall has written himself some damn fine spy stories!\n\n* So…Bob Hope arrives at Kai Tak, and a bunch of reporters are waiting for him as soon as the plane doors open. Hope takes a deep breath, makes a face and says \"Good Lord, what's that smell?\" Embarrassed, a reporter explains, \"well, that's shit, Mr. Hope\" - to which ol' Bob says \"I know it's shit - but what did they DO to it??\"\n\nJuly 11, 2021\n\nA more succinct Quiller adventure than what I am used to; a briefer Quiller read than I desired; a more compact packaging of Quiller thrills than I expected. The writing--as usual--as consistently taut and frantic as ever; but as Quiller journeys to Hong Kong this time (only two books ago he was in Bangkok) the locale doesn't demand that Hall go to great feats of description. Only one book ago Quiller was in the deserts of Tunisia and Hall was hugely evocative. Here, just a few lines of attention is paid to setting in each chapter. This makes the lean read.\n\nNevertheless there is a heaping handful of psychological insights, cunning strategies, flairful touches of action and pacing. Still; left me wanting a bit more. Each of the two previous Quillers I enjoyed kept me on a knife-edge for almost two weeks each. I finished this romp in little more than two days.\n\nThere's a total of three very fine scenes of hand-to-hand combat. One of them, in SCUBA gear. That was indeed nifty. Freaky underwater fighting.\n\nThe usually strong sense of 'satisfaction' and 'fulfillment' at the end of any Quiller yarn: definitely present in this one. Ingenious and audacious.\n\nStill, Quiller didn't have to go through quite so much of an ordeal in this tale as he usually does. It was not balls-to-the-wall. An 'easy' Quiller read, if one can say that.\n\nHis superiors --his controllers --are relatively benign this time around, instead of 'tossing him to the wolves' as they usually do (something wholly lacking in Fleming's Bond series). But there's only one mystery to solve: an English scientist has been killed and his widow is behaving suspiciously.\n\nAnyway I sure hope Adam Hall (aka Elleston Trevor, the author of this series and many other greats like 'Flight of the Phoenix' ended his days a wealthy man. These books of his are stupendous.\n\nI continue to maintain my opinion that he is the best modern-day writer of action thrillers; carrying on in the tradition of Hammett. There are very few other writers who can make this claim."
