        "text": "What does it take to write a compelling thriller, and then multiple compelling thriller series? Michael Wiley, a local author and professor, certainly knows! Join us to find out his writing secrets at our next Lit Chat Interview.\n\nJOIN\n\nLit Chat Interview with Michael Wiley, Monday, January 30 at 6:30 p.m. This event will take place live at the Mandarin Library and will be livestreamed online via Zoom.

Michael is also the author of three mystery and detective series, including the Shamus Award-winning Joe Kozmarski books, the Daniel Turner thrillers, and, most recently, the Sam Kelson PI novels, which are currently in development for television. His short stories appear often in magazines and anthologies, including Best Mystery Stories of the Year 2022.\n\nMichael grew up in Chicago and lived and worked in the neighborhoods and on the streets where he sets his Kelson and Kozmarski mysteries. He teaches literature at the University of North Florida in Jacksonville—the setting of The Long Way Out, an earlier Franky Dast novel (Monument Road), and the Daniel Turner novels.\n\nInterviewer Mark Ari authored the novel, The Shoemaker’s Tale (Zephyr Press) and publishes fiction, nonfiction and poetry. His paintings have been exhibited in group and solo shows in Spain, France, and the United States, especially New York City. Most recently, “Not in My Country,” an installation (text, film, sculpture, and scent) created with Ginger Andro and Chuck Glicksman was selected for Walls and Borders, an exhibition at Westbeth Gallery (NYC, 2021) sponsored by the Sculptors Guild (NYC). Recent writings appear in Adroit Journal, Heavy Feather Review, the International Journal of Professional Holistic Aromatherapy, and the anthology, Music Gigs Gone Wrong (Paycock Press). Ari is a three-time MacDowell fellow. Other awarded fellowships include the Ragdale Foundation (twice), Ucross Foundation, and Spain’s Fundacion Valparaiso. He is a multi-award-winning educator at the University of North Florida, where he directs the creative writing program.\n\nREAD\n\nCheck out all of Michael's books from the library, as well as Ari’s The Shoemaker’s Tale!\n\nMichael Wiley recommends three “first books” by other mystery and thriller writers:"
