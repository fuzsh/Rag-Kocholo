        "text": "\"BEAUTY TO A WOMAN IS POWER.\"SALLY HANSEN, LOS ANGELES TIMES, 1934\n\nSally's fearless, independent spirit soon led her to leave her job working for the family business and pursue her dreams of becoming a dancer.\n\nSally left for Hollywood, California, where she would become a successful dancer and choreographer, landing roles in productions like \"Beverly Smiles\", \"Peggy Ann\", and \"Spring is Upon Us\".\n\nIn the midst of the roaring 1920's, she and her dashing, bon vivant husband, Adolf Hansen, would become fixtures on the Hollywood social scene, hosting a stream of star-studded parties at their glamorous Spanish-inspired villa. A villa which Sally, herself designed.\n\n\"SOME THINGS THAT YOU IMAGINE TO BE DEFECTS, REALLY AREN'T DEFECTS AT ALL. THEY CAN BE FEATURES THAT GIVE YOU DISTINCTION.\"SALLY HANSEN, LOS ANGELES TIMES, 1934\n\nBlonde, petite and fashionable, Sally was famous for her avant-garde style, and her progressive views.\n\nHer sassy and frank voice found a powerful outlet with her column in LA Times, 'Your Candid Mirror', for which she wrote over 91 articles.\n\nSo much more than beauty advice or gossip column, \"Your Candid Mirror' was a loudhailer for the voice of a strong, independent, self-made woman. A woman with opinions far ahead of her time, who believed in empowering women in beauty, in business and in life.\n\n\"I WAS ALWAYS BREAKING NAILS. THAT'S WHY I HAD SUCH AN INTEREST IN PRODUCTS THAT REALLY STOPPED NAILS FROM CHIPPING AND CRACKING.\"SALLY HANSEN, BOSTON GLOBE, 1961\n\nAfter her early dance career, Sally took over her parents' cosmetics business, with the help of her husband and brother, reinventing it as House of Hollywood and transforming it into a successful business. This marks the beginning of Sally Hansen, the self-made woman and entrepreneur. Sally wanted to build a line of affordable, innovative beauty products for real women. Beauty that really worked.\n\n\"BEAUTY IS MORE THAN NAIL POLISH. BEAUTY IS KINDNESS, TOLERANCE, CHARACTER, AND MENTAL ATTITUDE.\"\n\nSally's first marriage was to Eugene Gunther, a man who would turned out to be a violent drunk, and in 1929, Sally filed for divorce on grounds of 'excessive intoxication'.\n\nSally's second marriage to Adolf Hansen was far happier. But behind the scenes Sally craved for the chance to set out on her own, and on October 1st, 1946, Sally again filed for divorce. They parted amicably.\n\nSally bravely chose to leave her husband, her friends, and her glamorous Hollywood life, to pursue her dreams of creating her own beauty empire in New York City.\n\nSALLY HANSEN. THE ORIGINAL SELF-MADE WOMAN.\n\nSally Hansen Inc. was born. Finally, Sally had the freedom to create the company she had always dreamed of. A company in her own name, with a logo modeled on Sally's own signature.\n\nAmong its first two trademarks would be the now iconic Hard as Nails, and Sally Hansen would go on to become the number one nail brand in the U.S.A.\n\nAlong with peers such as Helena Rubenstein, and Estee Lauder, Sally Hansen challenged the male-dominated world around her and sought to redefine the beauty industry in her own way. But Sally did not come from wealth or privilege. Sally created herself, and her company, all by herself.\n\nHERE IS A BEAUTY TREATMENT FOR YOUR MIND, LOOK OUT THE WINDOW AND ENJOY THE SUN SETTING. THESE LITTLE THINGS BRING TRUE HAPPINESS.\n\nSally Hansen died at age 56, on December 16, 1963, after a 6-month fight with lung cancer.\n\nHer grave is small and simple. A flat plaque in the Hollywood Hills that, until recently, was buried in mud and barely visible.\n\nA humble resting place for a self-made beauty giant.\n\nToday, Sally Hansen Inc. is one of the largest beauty brands in the world. But Sally's legacy is so much more than that. A self-made woman who defied her era, her story is as inspiring today as it was then."
