        "text": "A few weeks ago, when I began walking through Mandarin, I started seeing the frogs.\n\nTwo sat underneath a spigot, as if waiting for someone to come by and turn on the water. Another sat on a guardrail on Scott Mill Road, as if watching to make sure drivers obeyed the 30 mph speed limit.\n\nThey were all over the place, as if one of the storms that passed through recently caused big, concrete frogs to rain from the skies.\n\nWhile they all clearly had started out the same - emerging from a mold about the size of a football - each was painted differently. There were green frogs and blue frogs, striped frogs and polka dot frogs, yellow-eyed frogs and red-lipped frogs.\n\nWhen I posted a photo of one of the frogs on social media, several people asked: What's the story?\n\nI learned more about it during this week's leg of a walk across Jacksonville, when I veered off San Jose Boulevard and headed south on Mandarin Road, taking a detour into the Walter Jones Historical Park.\n\nThe 11-acre park is one of Jacksonville's gems, partly because it's a beautiful piece of public land on the St. Johns River, partly because of all the history contained there.\n\nSandy Arpen and Karen Droege agreed to play tour guides when I made it to the park, showing me some of what the Mandarin Museum and Historical Society has preserved on the grounds, including the latest addition: the St. Joseph's Mission Schoolhouse for African-American Children, built in 1898, now the last one-room schoolhouse in Duval County.\n\nMark Walks Jax: Follow Mark on his walk across Jacksonville\n\nThey had just finished telling me some of the stories contained in the museum - most notably the sinking of the Maple Leaf during the Civil War, and the recovery of artifacts led by Keith Holland more than 100 years later - when Arpen just happened to mention what was over in one corner, along with books and paintings and other gifts.\n\n\"And, of course, we have the frogs,\" she said with a laugh.\n\nI looked over and saw about two dozen of the brightly colored frogs, with price tags between $18 and $25.\n\nThis is where the frogs come from. Not from the sky. From the Mandarin Museum and a mystery resident.\n\nThe person responsible for the frog phenomenon - hundreds of frogs now dot Mandarin yards, roadsides and parks - prefers to remain anonymous. But his story, or at least the story of his frogs, is worth telling.\n\nArpen explained that last year the frogs starting showing up in the area. The first place she saw one in the park was on a big stump near the path leading to the river.\n\nThey became a conversation starter, partly because of their mystery. One day she was talking to a retiree with deep roots in Mandarin - his family has been here since 1785 - when he brought up the frogs and asked her what she thought of them.\n\nShe told him she thought they were cute. She described how her grandson, on the way to preschool, always was looking for the frogs.\n\n\"I said, 'Do you have any idea who is making them?\" she said. \"He got kind of a sheepish look and said, 'Well, I am.'\"\n\nHe had bought an aluminum mold in the 1980s after seeing an ad in a magazine that said, \"Turn concrete into gold!\"\n\nFor years, he just made frogs for his yard and for family and friends. When he retired, he decided to start making them for fun.\n\nHe told Arpen that there's so much negative stuff going on in the world, he just wanted to put a smile on people's faces.\n\n\"He met his goal for sure,\" she said.\n\nAnd although it never was the plan, he also started turning concrete and smiles into gold for the museum.\n\nWhen the museum was having a fundraiser to preserve the old schoolhouse, he offered to bring about 10 of the frogs to the event. He said if they sold any of them, they could put the money toward the cause. All of them sold. And that was just the start.\n\nOn some Saturday mornings, before the museum opens, people already are standing outside, waiting to pick out a frog. In one day alone, the museum sold $1,000 in frogs. The Frog Man's cut of that: $0.\n\nStanding near his latest creations the other morning, Arpen and Droege talked about how they've offered to pay him for materials (he has declined) and how he sometimes spends 40 hours a week making his concrete creatures.\n\n\"He's wonderful,\" Droege said. \"And he's getting more elaborate, too.\"\n\n\"It's an amazing gift,\" Arpen said.\n\nThe Frog Man's identity isn't exactly a secret anymore. Quite a few people do know who he is. He's at the park many Saturdays, helping sell the frogs, working with kids at frog-painting events this summer. But he'd still rather not have his name in the paper. When Times-Union reporter Tiffanie Reynolds interviewed him for a story earlier this year, he asked that she use only his first name, Donald. And she noted that he now marks the bottom of each frog with \"FM\" - for Frog Man.\n\nSince January, he has made hundreds more frogs, helping the Mandarin Museum and Historical Society continue its preservation and programs.\n\nThis Saturday, for instance, the park will be part of Smithsonian Museum Day Live, an event designed to encourage people to discover museums in their own community.\n\nAdmission to the museum always is free. But this Saturday all of the historic buildings - the schoolhouse, winery, farmhouse and 1876 Barn - will be open. Keith Holland and some of his dive crew will be there. And while people undoubtedly will come for the nature and history, some will leave with a concrete frog.\n\nNext week: the walk continues south on Mandarin Road, where the sidewalk ends (and some controversies begin), through what some residents call the \"most beautiful mile in Jacksonville.\"\n\nmark.woods@jacksonville.com,\n\n(904) 359-4212"
