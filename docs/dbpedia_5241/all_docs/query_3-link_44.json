        "text": "For this year I settled on some lesser known pieces – three ‘shorts’. Jean Renoir’s A Day in the Country (39 minutes), James Cagney in The Great Guy (1 hour 6 minutes), and Eddie Quillan in The Mandarin Mystery (53 minutes).\n\nThere are several feature-length movies which almost certainly outstrip these as ‘The Best Movie of …’, but they’ll have to wait until my random number generator lands on this year again. They include Humphrey Bogart in his first major role in The Petrified Forest, Leslie Howard and Norma Shearer in Romeo & Juliet (considered the best movie version of the play), Paul Muni in the triple-Oscar winning The Story of Louis Pasteur, Charles Laughton in the British-made biopic Rembrandt, and Chaplin’s last (almost) silent feature Modern Times.\n\nA DAY IN THE COUNTRY (PARTIE DE CAMPAGNE) (shot in 1936, released in 1946) France\n\nDirector: Jean Renoir.\n\nCast: Sylvia Bataille, Georges D’Arnoux, Jacques B. Brunius.\n\nPlot: On a day out in the country, a city girl is pursued by two young men.\n\nReview: This was a pleasant, short piece, with little moments that almost anyone can relate to. The general setting is a city family’s outing to a countryside inn. The father tries to make out he’s an expert on everything they see, the mother is more concerned about ants climbing into her underwear, the grandmother falls asleep with a kitten on her lap, and the daughter plays on a swing. Two local lads immediately engage in their favourite sport – girl watching, and the girl (Sylvia Bataille) quickly attracts their interest. After vying with each other for her attention, they quieter of the two boys finds himself alone with her and they share a passionate moment.\n\nAs the movie rolled by, it did not make an immediate impression as anything very special, but an unexpected bitter-sweet twist at the end helped explain why this short is held in high regard, in spite of being unfinished. Renoir had to abandon the movie because of bad weather and a commitment to another piece of work, but the pieces he’d shot were later put together to make a complete and coherent tale. It may be all the better for it, as I wouldn’t have been so interested in sitting through a longer version, as good and more polished as it might have been. Very ‘French’ in tone, worth a look at if you get the chance.\n\nScore: 5/10.\n\nTHE MANDARIN MYSTERY (23 December 1936) USA\n\nDirector: Ralph Staub.\n\nCast: Eddie Quillan, Charlotte Henry.\n\nPlot: Inspector Queen, helped by his quick-witted son, Ellery, find themselves investigating the murder of an unknown man amidst the world of stamp collecting.\n\nReview: This is a light and humorous affair, with a good set of character actors. It looked interesting from IMDb reviews and I was keen to find out what ‘Ellery Queen’ was all about.\n\nThe Ellery Queen novels were originally written for magazine publication in the 1920s, with the idea of giving the reader all the necessary clues to solve the mystery for themselves, if they had the patience, or just enjoy them as cleverly put-together detective mysteries.\n\nThe movie doesn’t quite live up to that ideal, but the character acting more than makes up for this. Charlotte Henry and Eddie Quillan play the leads and give enjoyable, easy-going performances. Charlotte Henry disappeared from the screen after the early 1940s, moving to stage work. Eddie Quillan has a certain quality about him, and it wasn’t a surprise to discover he was in The Grapes of Wrath playing the moody husband who abandons his pregnant wife when times get hard. Acting from the age of seven, he continued into his early 70s, his last appearance being in 1987 in the TV series Matlock.\n\nThe Mandarin Mystery doesn’t really merit in depth analysis, other than to say it passes an hour easily. Simply a good fun one-off, with neither the director or stars making any movie shorts in a similar vein.\n\nScore: 3/10.\n\nTHE GREAT GUY (December 1936) USA\n\nDirector: John G Blystone.\n\nCast: James Cagney, Mae Clark, James Burke.\n\nPlot: James Cagney, as a trading standards officer, finds himself treading on just about everybody’s toes in his efforts to beat corruption.\n\nReview: Not a particularly polished production, but James Cagney is entertainingly watchable as a ‘weights and measures’ officer with a penchant for annoying the wrong people and making use of his fists when he can’t think of anything better to do.\n\nThere are other entertaining characters as well as the generic bad guys. James Burke stands out as a new recruit with the gift of the blarney, managing to effortlessly chat up Cagney’s secretary and every other girl he meets. Joe Swayer as an old sparring partner of Cagney’s also makes a good impression (and is yet another actor who turns up in The Grapes of Wrath). As with The Mandarin Mystery, there’s not really a lot else to say, as this is ultimately a bit of a throw away movie, but there’s a lot worse out there.\n\nScore: 2/10.\n\nSo, the Best Movie of 1936 is …\n\nA DAY IN THE COUNTRY (5/10)\n\n… because of it’s discreet charm and pathos, achieving more in thirty minutes than many other movies do in two or three hours."
