        "text": "I think I still have enough space here to do another Silver Age annotation. Let's pick TALES OF SUSPENSE# 50, from February 1964. The first appearance of the Mandarin. To be honest, I think it's rather a weak story but they can't all be gems. There's going to be some ragging on Don Heck's art and storytelling, but I have to call 'em like I see 'em and I just never liked Heck's art. As a kid, I quickly got the feeling that Marvel stories not drawn by Jack Kirby or Steve Ditko were not as authentic, that in some way they didn't \"really\" happen to the same extent.\n\nPage 1. Okay, we are not supposed to say \"the Orient\" or \"Oriental\" anymore and I think everyone has got the memo. But in 1964, no one saw anything wrong with it and well into the 1980s I was reading magazines like ORIENTAL CINEMA. Things change. Stand by to see the next phrase to be stricken from your vocabulary. This page and the following one just really hammers it home how terrifying the Mandarin is.\n\nBUT why does the Mandarin wear a mask? Beats me. He sure doesn't have a civilian identity he wants to keep secret, he's the Mandarin eight days a week. Why does he have the English letter \"M\" on his tunic?! Why not a dragon or a Chinese character for \"strength\" or \"leader\" that could be looked up in the public library? Because no one put that much thought into it back then as these comics were rushed out every month. If, as was usually the case, the cover of this issue was done first, then Jack Kirby designed the visuals of the character. The earrings and the droopy mustache and goatee would be immediate shorthand to readers that this guy is creepy and evil and (yes) foreign. The array of ten rings, each with a different power, is a great gimmick, though. I doubt if anyone kept track of them or made a list or anything like that. They did whatever was needed at the moment.\n\nPage 3. This is swiped right out of the first Yellow Claw story, although that 1950s villain had more class and hypnotized one of the soldiers into aiming a pistol at his officer. In general, I like the Yellow Claw much better, anyway. More sinister and imaginative than the Mandarin. Besides, he had art by Joe Maneely and Jack Kirby, and the stories were perceptive enough to give him a modern Chinese-American FBI agent as an adversary.\n\nTony obligingly agrees to illegally enter the People's Republic of China as a spy to get some information. Well, I can see that. Aside from being as patriotic as the next guy, Tony has always been on good terms with the military, what with his $$$$$ contracts to develop new weapons of mass destruction. Growing up in a wealthy industrialist family and taking over the business himself, Tony Stark WOULD be conservative and probably Republican. It fits his character.\n\nPage 4. How about some sub-plot with the supporting cast? Sounds good. Bill sure takes it hard that Tony can't attend the employee's dinner. Are the men that fond of Tony Stark? Either way, Bill's reacting strongly with that speech. Even so, Happy Hogan (a former boxer, by the way) has no reason to punch him in the face. Tony gives an angry reprisal speech, but it shows a little about 1964 that men were more likely to get slugged in bars or at parties and just take it without calling lawyers (or in this case, bringing in the union to get Happy fired and fined immediately).\n\nI'm sorry to see Pepper get all glamored up and become just another gorgeous comic book babe. With her hair up in a bun and too many freckles and slightly prim librarian outfits, Pepper was much more likeable in her early appearances. And her hopeless crush on Tony Stark had a wistful quality. But then, Happy becomes progressively better-looking too, as time goes on. Bland the characters down, I guess.\n\nPage 5. And here we are, sneaking into Red China. That's a neat gambit, tricking the soldiers into thinking the Yankee spy fell to his death. I like the one soldier (is that Jack Soo? Can't be) commenting on how the \"bumbling democracies cannot even makes chutes that work correctly,\" a twist on the usual jokes about products made in China. (I would LOVE lead paint on my child's toy, why would you even ask?)\n\nPage 6. I suspect the Mandarin's private guards here were supposed to be just more of the Chinese soldiers from the previous page. They're wearing the same uniforms and I would think the Mandarin would give his guards something distinctive. Ever notice Iron Man at this time has the equivalent of brass knuckles on his mitts? As if getting punched by a steel glove wouldn't be rough enough in the first place. And despite Stan's caption about \"one of the mightiest human fighting machines of all time,\" Iron Man is already starting to lose power. \"Must be a short circuit somewhere..\" Come on, Tony, get with it. You didn't check every inch of that armor before illegally invading the People's Republic of China to tackle a mysterious super-villain? I'm more careful with my car before going on a trip."
