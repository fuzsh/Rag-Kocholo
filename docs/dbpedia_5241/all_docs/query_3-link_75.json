        "text": "If you're Malaysian, you've probably seen Netflix's The Ghost Bride appearing numerous times on your social media feed.\n\nThe murder mystery cum romance six-episode series is based off an actual Chinese tradition that is still being practiced till today.\n\nAdapted from Malaysian author Yangsze Choo's novel of the same name, the series is made almost entirely by Malaysians. With it being released internationally on Netflix, while being the platform's first Mandarin original series, it's a pretty big achievement.\n\nNetflix's The Ghost Bride is about Li Lan, a woman living in the colonial-era Melaka during the 1890s. Li Lan receives a proposal to become the ghost bride of a wealthy family's recently-deceased son. Failure to do so would see her family destroyed.\n\nMashable Southeast Asia recently sat down with Netflix's The Ghost Bride's showrunner, Zainir Aminullah, directors of the series, Ho Yuhang and Quek Shio Chuan to find out just why Malaysians should be proud of this series.\n\nThis interview has been condensed and edited for clarity.\n\nNetflix's The Ghost Bride is set in Melaka in 1890. How much of research was put in place to stay true to this era?\n\nHo: Quite a bit of research went into the series. Obviously this was the first thing we had to do. We tend to do our research so that we’re over prepared. However, we’re also aware that we’re not making a historically accurate story. We’re making a supernatural romance that also has an element of fun.\n\nOnce we had done the research, we knew we were confident to take some creative liberties by knowing the do’s and don’ts. So with this we communicated with Netflix on the direction we were going to pursue. So it was confirmed, we were not going to make a historical film. It should be youthful, fun and entertaining.\n\nQuek, it must have been quite an experience for you from directing a relatively smaller budget film such as Guang to The Ghost Bride. How has the experience been for you?\n\nQuek: It’s been really exciting. I came in with a learning mentality since Guang was my first film and it was a realistic piece. When the opportunity came, I was -- wow, The Ghost Bride -- it has fantasy, murder, mystery, something I’ve never done before. It’s a new format, a new genre, and I was definitely excited to take it on. It has been an exciting journey and I’ve learned so much from the two of them and the rest of the crew.\n\nWhat’s something new did you learn from the crew?\n\nQuek: Well, for starters I had to accustom myself to shoot for three months. I do commercials so my shoots are around four-minutes. (laughs) Under this project, I had to do three episodes so it did take some getting accustomed to. But it’s okay, it was a learning process. Every day you wake up and go for the shoot, then you go back home and think about the next day. You sleep and the next day you get going again.\n\nBut with Netflix it’s a really healthy system I would say. We have a really good time limit and we try to aim to shoot for 12 hours a day. Even if we do overrun it’s usually an additional 2 hours. So it’s 14 hours max. This allows us to have good mental health and for the actors it’s important. Especially for someone like Peijia Huang who plays Li Lan, to always come on set fresh and well prepared. This goes out to other departments as well. They’re well prepared, their rehearsals are done. Due to this, there's a really good shooting environment and I think everyone gave their best.\n\nIt must have been quite an amazing experience for all three of you. Zainir, The Ghost Bride is Netflix’s first Mandarin original series. Why wasn’t the series done in English since Yangsze Choo’s book was in this language?\n\nZainir: That’s a very good question because there was a long and deep debate between our team as well as Netflix as to what the language would be. But it was decided to be Mandarin because we wanted to reach as wide and as diverse an audience as possible. Although the original material was in English, we thought that with the visual medium the authenticity of the actors delivering their lines in the Peranakan culture instead of English would be a lot more authentic than delivering it in English. So the decision was taken to shoot the series in Mandarin which we thought would cast a much wider net globally in terms of acceptance.\n\nInteresting. How close is the Netflix adaptation of The Ghost Bride compared to the book, Ho?\n\nHo: I read the book and both book and series feel very different. But it’s not a bad thing and it’s not like it has to be exactly like the book. I don’t think the author wanted it to be that way. So we did take some very interesting creative liberties. The book is rather melancholic, which was fine with me. But from earlier on we identified that we don’t want this series to be too sad. Imagine if there’s this pervasive sadness throughout all six episodes, which is quite long. So we decided on the tonality in terms of lighting. Because when you read the book you get the feeling that the light is a lot dimmer, the atmosphere is denser. When you do something like that it'll be a bit more sombre. So we decided it was going to be youthful and more entertaining. Otherwise it’ll be hard for a wider audience.\n\nQuek, you've also done some research on the ancient Chinese tradition of ghost marriage. What's fascinating about it?\n\nQuek: I think Ho did most of the research (laughs). That said, marriage as time passes, is getting more and more lenient I would say. Especially on how it was arranged and to a point it was arranged between the living and the deceased. For Li Lan who comes a bygone era, she can be considered a character that is very forward thinking. She resembles a woman of today’s thinking and mentality. Which is a good thing because to us The Ghost Bride has an accurate take on feminism. So she’s always thinking about not wanting to be restricted by social rules. She doesn’t want to marry unless she feels the partner is right for her. Li Lan always has this sense of adventure and wants to explore the world. She doesn’t want to be restricted by social rules. So this is the sentiment that is injected into the film that you’ll find is very apparent.\n\nNice. Zainir, how many percent of Malaysians roughly were involved in the making of this series? And how important was it to you to ensure that Malaysians were involved?\n\nZainir: This is a big headline for us and Malaysians within the industry. It’s a Malaysian intellectual property in terms of the book, the author, a Malaysian cast, and crew. I would say close to 99 percent of everybody involved were Malaysians. We also have an international cast from Canada, U.S., and Taiwan. But in terms of the production crew, it’s entirely Malaysian except for one or two supervisors. We’re proud because we were able to demonstrate at the global scale for a global audience that this series was entirely developed, packaged, and delivered by Malaysians.\n\nIt must have been a proud moment for everyone.\n\nZainir: Absolutely.\n\nHo, you’ve mentioned that the series is a modern take on a period film. What was the reason behind this creative decision?\n\nHo: There are a couple of aspects. For example, the wardrobe. If you were to look at the rich people back then they had a rather cumbersome wardrobe. Not exactly exciting looking. So then we thought, “Can we make this more interesting?” The question then was, “Do we give it a postmodern twist? Would that work?” We thought why not. It was a lightbulb moment. We realized we could do that and that was exciting. This also was something the costume designer had in mind to liberate the feeling and not to make it feel so old fashioned. Everytime you see a period piece you seem to have a distance.\n\nLike a disconnect?\n\nHo: Yeah, a bit disconnected. We don’t want that. So in terms of costume design we made this decision. Even generally with the art direction, it’s still the past but not-so-distant past. So we don’t want to make it, as you’ve said, too detached from us.\n\nZainir: The beauty about this series is it's got the netherworld. Which then gave us the liberty to go crazy with the design.\n\nHo: Yeah, it’s like, have you been there? No, right? Okay, so let’s have some fun! (laughs).\n\nI saw the trailer and a couple of episodes. It was pretty interesting to see how the set design for the series is. Quek, what was one thing that stood out for you from the book which you tried bringing into this series?\n\nQuek: I would think it’s the core idea that I mentioned earlier. You have a really forward thinking character since the very beginning. So the whole backbone of the entire book is centered around Li Lan and you tell the story through this character. We can package a lot of things around this character like a murder mystery, a fantasy romance, but, in the end it all depends on this one main character which I really, really liked. And that is what connected to me the most.\n\nHo: Yeah, even when we were shooting, we explained to Peijia, who is acting as Li Lan, that her character is not passive. She makes choices. Despite being set 100 years ago, she doesn’t let things impose upon her and she struggles. So that comes across and in every scene she has that in mind.\n\nZainir: She still has a very strong sense of loyalty and obedience toward her family.\n\nHo: Yes, so there’s this whole act of balance between duty, moral, social pressure, and all that.\n\nOne final question and it's a fun one. You’re walking down a street and all of a sudden a genie, or in a more Malaysian sense, a djin pops up and says, \"I'll make you the richest man in the world but in return you have to marry a ghost\". What would you do?\n\nQuek: I’ll take the money! Maybe marrying a person is worse than marrying a ghost. Human beings can be scarier than a ghost sometimes. (laughs)\n\nZainir: I would say show me the picture of the ghost.\n\nHo: I’ll say, “You do first lah!” (laughs)\n\nNetflix’s The Ghost Bride premieres on the platform on January 23, 2020.
