Twelve series were broadcast on ITV between 2 August 1987 and 11 October 2000. Created by renowned author Ruth Rendell, the first six series focused entirely on her main literary character, Chief Inspector Reg Wexford, played by George Baker. Repeat airings of these series changed the programme's title to The Inspector Wexford Mysteries. However, later series shifted focus to other short stories previously written by Rendell, with Wexford featuring in only three further stories, in 1996, 1998 and 2000. When broadcast, these three stories were broadcast under the title Inspector Wexford.\n\nIn some cases stories were expanded from Rendell's original material or elements from a number of stories were woven together into one episode. A smaller number of episodes were based on Rendell's full-length novels, such as The Strawberry Tree starring Simon Ward, Going Wrong starring James Callis, A Case of Coincidence starring Keith Barron and Ronald Pickup, Front Seat starring Janet Suzman, and The Lake of Darkness starring Jerome Flynn. A total of fifty-five episodes featured Inspector Wexford, alongside his wife Dora (Louie Ramsay) and his assistant DI Mike Burden (Christopher Ravenscroft). A total of twenty-nine episodes focused on other characters.\n\nThe first six series were released on VHS, but have never been released on DVD due to licensing rights issues with The Walt Disney Company, who owns Television South's back catalogue of programming. Series seven to twelve have since been released on DVD as a Best Of box set, omitting four episodes.\n\nEach episode follows the investigations of Chief Inspector Reg Wexford and his team of detectives in the fictional town of Kingsmarkham. The cases they investigate are often complex and involve a range of characters with hidden motives and dark secrets.\n\nThe series delves into the psychology of crime, exploring the motives and behaviors of both the perpetrators and the victims. The stories are often dark and gritty, with themes of murder, revenge, jealousy, and betrayal.\n\nThroughout the series, Wexford faces personal challenges and struggles with his own demons, including his complicated relationship with his wife, Dora. Despite his personal troubles, Wexford remains a dedicated and determined detective, committed to solving each case and bringing justice to the victims.\n\nGeorge Baker as DCI Reg Wexford (Series 1—6, 9, 11—12)\n\nChristopher Ravenscroft as DI Mike Burden (Series 1—6, 9, 11—12)\n\nLouie Ramsay as Dora Wexford (Series 1—6, 9, 11—12)\n\nDeborah Poplett as Sheila Wexford (Series 1—6, 9, 11)\n\nCharon Bourke as Sylvia Wexford (Series 2—6, 9, 11—12)\n\nEmma Smith as Pat Burden (Series 1—6)\n\nDiane Keen as Jenny Burden (Series 4—6, 9, 11—12)\n\nAnn Penfold as Jean Burden (Series 1—4)\n\nNoah Huntley as John Burden (Series 1—4)\n\nKen Kitson as DS Caleb Martin (Series 1—6)\n\nIsobel Middleton as DS Karen Malahyde (Series 2—6, 9, 11—12)\n\nColin Campbell as Sgt Willoughby (Series 2—6)\n\nDave Hill as DCC Freeborn (Series 3—6)\n\nJohn Burgess as Dr. Len Croker (Series 2—6)\n\nGary Mavers as Colin Budd (Series 1—6, 9, 11—12)\n\nGwen Nelson\n\nEpisode Title Written by Directed by Original airdate 1–4\"Wolf to the Slaughter\"Clive ExtonJohn Davies2 August 1987 ( ) — 23 August 1987 ( )\n\nPart 1: One evening someone messes up a love-nest on a side street in a small country town.

Again, the remaining six series were released on DVD in the United States on 24 June 2008.
