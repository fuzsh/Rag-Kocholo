I wasn't the biggest Thornfan in the comics but I did appreciate the operatic air and mythic flair to the series. They kind of captured that in the first Tjor somewhat at the beginning so i was willing to waitnandnsee. But when he showed up in Avengersn I finally accepted that everyone would just be wise cracking all the time.\n\nIt's such a huge miss.

While not disagreeing with you on your core point, maybe the better option is just don't show it at all? And be faithful to the material that made him \"mystical\" in the first place?\n\nYou want to add to the mystery and the legend, maybe write some cool shit to have him talk about vaguely sometimes. Why do you think the Joker in TDK is still so beloved? None of use needed to know why he got his eyepatch in the MCU. They used a prominent part of his character as some cheap-ass way to \"connect\" these movies and in the process get a quirky giggle, and we all know it. It just demeans him in the process.\n\nThis has been the underlying issue with the MCU for quite some time now, simply taking characters for granted.\n\nChumunga64\n\nJun 22, 2018\n\n15,111\n\nFriday at 1:15 AM\n\n#29\n\nI don't read the comics but I liked Taskmaster from MvC3, the Insomniac Spider-Man game, and stuff I read on the wiki.

The only Thor comic I read was the one with Gor, meanwhile in pretty much every MCU movie he's just a himbo\n\nMy coworker once called MCU Thor a 90's Surfer dude and Its the best description of Thor I've ever heard\n\naesth3ric\n\nMay 19, 2022\n\n76\n\nFriday at 1:53 AM\n\n#35\n\nOut of the big heroes. It would be Thor.\n\nChrno\n\nOct 25, 2017\n\n3,662\n\nFriday at 2:30 AM\n\n#36\n\nThor and Hulk for sure.\n\nHulk needs his own movie to flesh out his character, and then he needs to get angry.\n\nKorigama\n\nOct 25, 2017\n\n21,329\n\nFriday at 4:58 AM\n\n#43\n\nKang. No, you don't get to be treated as the next Thanos-level threat if your big screen debut has you jobbing to Ant-Man, the Wasp, and an army of giant ants.\n\nHim too. Would've still been getting his ass whooped by Thor and Loki's mom if he didn't have his magic roid goon bail him out.\n\nNever cared for the origin story of hard boiled Avengers leader Nick Fury's injured eye to actually end up being some silly alien cat scratch that he seemed to be quite okay with when it happened.\n\nI rather liked the truth of how it happened vs. whatever gritty explanation seemed more likely to be the reason why.\n\nBasilZero\n\nOct 25, 2017\n\n37,252\n\nOmni\n\nFriday at 5:03 AM\n\n#44\n\nKang got the worst but all of them.\n\nBack to Kang, you are not a Thanos level threat if you job to Ant-Man of all people.\n\nSheev\n\nOct 25, 2017\n\n2,278\n\nUK\n\nFriday at 5:04 AM\n\n#45\n\nI always hated MCU's Ultron. I can only hope that one day they might be able to salvage him and make some Guardians/other cosmic movie adapting Annihilation Conquest and have Ultron actually be a terrifying, calculating threat.\n\nTheEchosOfTheCyborg\n\nFeb 24, 2018\n\n5,814\n\nFriday at 5:45 AM\n\n#46\n\nA personal one for me is the treatment of Erik Selvig in Thor The Dark World which honestly just felt like mocking mental health issues for cheap ableist jokes. While they course corrected with that in Age of Ultron, the bit in Dark World about Stone Henge just makes me cringe and a sad reminder of how most people think of mental health.\n\nJ_ToSaveTheDay\n\n\"This guy are sick\" and Corrupted by Vengeance\n\nOct 25, 2017\n\n19,681\n\nUSA\n\nFriday at 5:48 AM\n\n#47\n\nAdam Warlock, but I admit that it and Gunn's entire tone really works for me anyway. I still stand by the reaction that the full reveal of Rocket's arc in Guardians 3 with all of the comedy still felt like a huge and earned emotional journey of grief and anger that had way more depth than most of MCU despite the antics.\n\nLast edited: Friday at 10:36 AM\n\nSoap\n\nOct 27, 2017\n\n16,468\n\nFriday at 6:09 AM\n\n#48\n\nThor, for better and worse. he was goofy in the original Thor but it was far too much in the last film.\n\nGlio\n\nOct 27, 2017\n\n25,281\n\nSpain\n\nFriday at 6:24 AM\n\n#49\n\nNah, Wanda doing fucked up stuff because of a very sexist plot is just as she is in the comics.\n\nOther examples in this thread like Malekith are bad because Malekith is much more fun in comics."
