        "text": "Second Sister (Original title: 網內人)\n\nAuthor: Chan Ho-Kei\n\nTranslator: Jeremy Tiang\n\nPublisher: Head of Zeus\n\nReleased: February 18th, 2020\n\nGenre: Fiction, Mystery\n\nPages: 495\n\nFormat: Paperback\n\nCharacters: N, Nga Yee, Siu Man, Sze Chung Nam, Violet To, …\n\nNga-Yee, a librarian, lives a quiet life with her fifteen-year-old sister Siu-Man. After a difficult, impoverished upbringing and the deaths of their parents, they are finally finding a bit of stability. Then one day, Nga-Yee comes home to find her teenage sister has jumped to her death.\n\nWas it suicide, or was she pushed? And does it have anything to do with a recent trip on the Hong Kong subway which left Siu-Man silent and withdrawn? Nga-Yee cannot rest until she knows the truth about her sister – even if that means tracking down her sister’s friends one by one and making them confess.\n\nPart detective novel, part revenge thriller, Second Sister explores themes of sexual harassment, internet bullying and teenage suicide – and vividly captures the zeitgeist of Hong Kong today.\n\nSource: Goodreads\n\nWhere do I even begin with this book? It’s huge and it was intimidating at first. Second Sister also consists of frigging long chapters that basically double up my fear towards this book. But when I requested this book, it was the synopsis that caught my interest and it definitely delivered the expectation, it even exceeded my expectation. This book is really good, and “really good” is not even enough to describe it.\n\nI’m not fan of detective novels but the way our main character, N, built his case and revealed the truths layer by layer was something you never wanna miss. It was full of anticipation. Chan Ho-Kei makes the readers want to know more and it was excruciatingly painful to wait for the end result. All of the details in every single page is important and never boring, yet it made me go: “When can I have my ending, SIR?!” The author knows precisely how to capture readers’ attention, because he surely got mine.\n\nThe plot was a hella ride. You think you figured things out but then there IS MORE! You can never be too sure with this book. It’s like the author is letting you feel like you have figured everything out, then he be like, “Ah, you think you got it all is it?” I was played big time.\n\nThe fact that this book focuses on Hong Kongers’ daily life routine makes me love it even more. I think the author did a great job at depicting the scenery and situations in Hong Kong, with the MTR stations, the lifestyle, the school, the food up till the housing situation in Hong Kong. Cyber bullying was another important theme or issue addressed in this book. It tells how ugly the society could be behind their smartphones and keyboards. How hurtful and harmful could the typed out words be to someone. So, be mindful of your words before you type out something on social media, be responsible of what you put out there. Family relationship is also highlighted in Second Sister. As the only caretaker of her younger sister, Nga Yee missed out a lot of things and in the end, this book taught me communication is the roots of everything when it comes to understanding your family members’ feelings and thoughts.\n\nThere is also a bit of playful romance and chemistry between Nga Yee and N. And I think that the ending is kinda perfect as it leaves us wondering what kind of path these two will take, friends or maybe life partners?\n\nThe explanations at the last chapter was very crucial as well. Sometimes, when you finished a mystery book and the author starts to explain everything at the end, you kinda know what is what and it didn’t provide any fun element or excitement anymore. But that’s not the case with this book. The explanation might surprise you even more. You will want to read Second Sister, this I promise you."
