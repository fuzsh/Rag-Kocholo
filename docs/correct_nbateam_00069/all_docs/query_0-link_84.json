        "text": "The Orlando Magic traded J.J. Redick at the NBA trade deadline in a three-way deal that ultimately landed them Tobias Harris, Doron Lamb, Beno Udrih and Hakim Warrick.\n\nAfter a week of speculation and reports of Redick being dealt to a handful of teams, Magic general manager Rob Hennigan says the deal with the Milwaukee Bucks came together in the final minutes leading up to the deadline, via Evan Dunlap of the Orlando Pinstriped Post.\n\n\"We made the decision at about 2:56 Eastern time, and that's not hyperbolic,\" Hennigan said. \"That's the truth. It came right down to the wire.\" The trade deadline was set for 3 PM.\n\nHennigan spoke to media Thursday evening and discussed the team's activity and thought process at the deadline. A driving factor was to trade Redick before he becomes an unrestricted free agent in the summer. After landing Arron Afflalo in the Dwight Howard three-way trade, the Magic already have money tied to the shooting guard position, creating a \"challenge\" for Orlando, via Evan Dunlap:\n\n\"That was part of the puzzle,\" Hennigan said. \"There are some inherent challenges when you look at the money that you have to spend on a team and at certain positions.\" When pressed, however, Hennigan said that trading Redick \"was not inevitable.\"\n\nMore in the NBA:\n\n• Metta World Peace greets cops wearing Cookie Monster pajamas\n\n• Magic trade J.J. Redick, 3 others at deadline\n\n• Josh Smith staying in Atlanta after all\n\n• Celtics make trade for backcourt help"
