        "text": "At last, the Los Angeles Lakers have seemingly found their new head coach after news broke on Thursday that the Western Conference franchise and former NBA player JJ Redick has agreed to a four-year deal.\n\nRedick has no coaching experience but the Lakers now entrust him with guiding the team from the sidelines. There are countless opinions about this bold move by the Lakers, who were originally targeting UConn Huskies head coach Dan Hurley before Hurley rejected an offer from LA. Among those who have voiced a take about the Redick hiring is no other than Basketball Hall of Famer and forever Lakers legend Magic Johnson.\n\nHere‚Äôs what Johnson posted on X on Thursday:\n\nI‚Äôm cautiously optimistic that this new hire is a success for both the Lakers and JJ Reddick. I enjoyed watching him as a player ‚Äì great 3-point shooting, high basketball IQ, passion for the game, and mental and physical toughness. If he can bring how he played professionally to the Lakers ‚Äì this could work out! But will his transition from star basketball player to head coach end up like Steve Kerr, Jason Kidd, Ty Lue, or Doc Rivers or the former NBA players turned coaches who weren‚Äôt successful?\n\nFans react to Los Angeles Lakers legend Magic Johnson‚Äôs reaction to JJ Redick news\n\nHere are some of the reactions fans have online to Johnson‚Äôs take:\n\n‚ÄúI bet Magic never watched Reddick and he says high IQ bc dude is white & shooting 3s ü§£‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúThanks Magic ‚Äì I remember you coached the Lakers at one time, it didn‚Äôt go too well. But I hope it‚Äôs more like Ty Lue where a first time head coach wins a ring with Bron in their first season!‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúThis is the epitome of damning with faint praise.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúSounds like @MagicJohnson is doubting this new hire. Words like cautiously optimistic is whole new ballgame, Magic‚Ä¶Further delight us more..‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm trusting u Magic!! if u optimistic bout the JJ hire, than we should really give him a chance (even tho I never wanted him) we gotta trust in @JeanieBuss & Rob Pelinka!! #TakesEverybody üíúüíõüî•‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúBut those names you mentioned had been assistant coach at same point in their careers. JJ has not done any coaching except kids league.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a risky move with a high reward, but I‚Äôm personally on the see it to believe it side. I‚Äôm always open to success, but being optimistic, that would be lying. I‚Äôm concerned that if it does not, this franchise will be set back even further.‚Äù\n\nFor More NBA, WNBA, and College Basketball Content:"
