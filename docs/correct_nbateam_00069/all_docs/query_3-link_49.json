        "text": "It's official: JJ Redick is an NBA head coach.\n\nLess than three years after the former guard elected to retire from playing, he is returning to the court, this time on the bench as the head coach of the Lakers. Redick was tied to the job for weeks, but Los Angeles made the deal official on Thursday, handing him a lucrative four-year deal.\n\nIt felt like a matter of when, not if, the former 3-point weapon got into coaching. He talked extensively about his desire to do so, and given his documented expertise on the sport, it felt like he was destined to be a head coach in the NBA.\n\nNow, Redick gets a shot at coaching one of the most storied franchises in the league as his first task. It's no easy one, but it's a job that most certainly could be the beginning of a long reign for the former player.\n\nAs Redick gets set to begin his next chapter as a coach, let's revisit his playing days and dissect his career a bit further.\n\nLAKERS HIRE JJ REDICK\n\nContract details\n\nIs Redick the right person for LA?\n\nInside Redick's 'Pat Riley-like' potential\n\nHow Redick will change Lakers\n\nRedick joins Coach K's growing coaching tree\n\nJJ Redick stats\n\nRedick was known for his ability to do damage offensively from beyond the arc. He led the NBA in 3-point percentage in 2015-16 with the Clippers, averaging 16.3 points and 2.7 3-pointers per game while converting at a 47.5 percent clip. His highest point-per-game average was 18.1 with the 76ers in 2018-19.\n\nHis 41.5 career 3-point percentage places him 18th in NBA history. That mark is better than known 3-point assassins such as Klay Thompson (41.3 percent) and Ray Allen (40.0 percent).\n\nFor his career, Redick averaged 12.8 points, 2.0 rebounds and 2.0 assists per game. His best seasons came from 2013-20, where he had a seven-year stretch of averaging at least 15.0 points per game.\n\nWhere did JJ Redick go to college?\n\nRedick played NCAA hoops at Duke University. He spent four seasons with the Blue Devils, playing for the team from the 2002-03 season to the 2005-06 campaign.\n\nUnder legendary head coach Mike Krzyzewski, Redick enjoyed an incredibly successful collegiate career. He earned one National Player of the Year award (2006), two ACC Player of the Year awards (2005, 2006), two ACC Tournament MVPs (2005, 2006) and two All-American honors.\n\nThe Blue Devils won three ACC championships with the sharpshooter on the squad, but the team was unable to earn an NCAA title with Redick.\n\nMORE: A complete timeline of LeBron James' head coaches\n\nWhat teams did JJ Redick play for?\n\nRedick played for six different teams throughout his 15-year NBA career. The guard began his career in Orlando after he was taken by the Magic with the No. 11 overall pick in the 2006 NBA Draft. He spent the first six-and-a-half seasons with the Magic before being traded to the Bucks.\n\nAfter finishing the 2012-13 season in Milwaukee, Redick was moved to the Clippers, where he spent the next four years of his career. Redick bounced around at the end of his playing days, spending two seasons for the 76ers, one-and-a-half seasons with the Pelicans and a half-season with the Mavericks.\n\nIn his lengthy career in the NBA, Redick never won an NBA championship.\n\nMagic: 2006-2013\n\nBucks: 2013\n\nClippers: 2013-17\n\n76ers: 2017-19\n\nPelicans: 2019-2021\n\nMavericks: 2021\n\nWhen did JJ Redick retire?\n\nRedick elected to retire on September 21, 2021, after 15 seasons in the league.\n\nThe former NBA guard already had dipped his toes into the media world before officially putting his playing days behind him. He started his own podcast in 2016, becoming the first active NBA player to do so.\n\nAfter retirement, Redick joined ESPN as an on-air analyst before also taking on color commentary duties as a part of ESPN's NBA broadcast team."
