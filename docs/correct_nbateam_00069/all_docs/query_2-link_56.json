        "text": "JJ Redick is being hired as the head coach of the Los Angeles Lakers. It will be the first coaching job for the former guard.\n\nThe 39-year-old Redick replaces Darvin Ham, who was fired May 3 despite leading the Lakers to two playoff berths and a Western Conference finals appearance in 2023.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRedick was a proficient outside shooter for six teams before his retirement in September 2021, when he moved into broadcasting and podcasting. He joined ESPNâ€™s lead commentary team earlier this year."
