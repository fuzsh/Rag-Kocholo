        "text": "Scroll down to the bottom of the NBA standings, start with the team with the worst record and work your way up. The dregs of the league have mostly had a valid excuse for being really bad this season.\n\nMinnesota is flush with youth but has also missed three starters for most of the season, including star point guard Ricky Rubio. Phil Jackson hired a rookie coach for New York, forced a difficult system on resistant players and finally hit the reset button. Philadelphia is losing by design. And the Los Angeles Lakers failed miserably in free agency and then had four players experience season-ending injuries, including the NBA’s third all-time leading scorer, Kobe Bryant.\n\nThe next team on the list is Orlando, which certainly wasn’t expected to be much of a factor in an Eastern Conference so weak that Indiana has lost 32 of its first 50 games and is still in contention for the eighth spot. But the Magic also wasn’t supposed to be confused with a tanking operation — and it shouldn’t be so bad that it loses 10 in a row and 16 of 18 overall without losing any significant players to injury during the slide.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis collapse actually coincides with Orlando finally getting healthy after starting the season with several key contributors missing time. So, the lack of cohesion coupled with lethargic performances have been confounding, especially when the Magic’s two wins since Dec. 30 came against playoff contenders Chicago and Houston. It also has victories this season over Atlanta and Phoenix.\n\nAfter weeks of speculation and several uninspired efforts, the Magic finally fired Jacque Vaughn on Thursday, ending his 2½-year stint with the organization. Vaughn went 58-158 in Orlando and leaves with the second-worst winning percentage (.269) among coaches with at least 200 games. Only Sidney Lowe had a worse percentage in stints with Minnesota and Vancouver/Memphis.\n\nVaughn is the second coach to lose his job this season but his firing makes as much sense Thursday as his hiring did in July 2012. When tapped by General Manager Rob Hennigan for his first head coaching gig, Vaughn had just spent the previous two years learning under the master, Gregg Popovich, in San Antonio and stretched out a 12-year playing career with his smarts and savvy. He had been considered a future coach from the time he was blazing through defenses and dropping dimes alongside future NBA players Paul Pierce and Raef LaFrentz at Kansas.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNot all Popovich protégés land in ideal situations. Mike Budenholzer and Steve Kerr will be the all-star game coaches for the Eastern Conference and Western Conference, respectively, on Feb. 15. But Brett Brown is in the second-year of an extended and gruesome rebuilding effort with the Philadelphia 76ers and Quin Snyder has just started to implement his system with the Utah Jazz.\n\nLike Utah and Philadelphia, the Magic was in no rush to win immediately with Vaughn since the franchise was still cleaning up after the Dwight Howard trade left them in shambles. But after winning 20 games in his first season and 23 in his second, Hennigan expected to see some progress from a roster that was limited in experience but not talent.\n\nNikola Vucevic, the lone prize in the ill-fated Howard trade that has set back every franchise involved, is playing at a borderline all-star level and ranks second in the NBA with 30 double-doubles. Tobias Harris, a serviceable power forward stolen from Milwaukee in a trade that sent out J.J. Redick, has hit his share of game-winners and is poised to become a restricted free agent this summer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVictor Oladipo, the former No. 2 overall pick and DeMatha standout, had several promising performances and highlight dunks since returning from a facial fracture injury. Rookie point guard Elfrid Payton is proving to be a feisty competitor with unrefined skills. And Evan Fournier and Kyle O’Quinn have had their moments as role players.\n\nRookie forward Aaron Gordon has been limited to 19 games and the team hasn’t won since he returned from a broken foot last month. Most of the veterans Vaughn inherited were shipped out and replaced with journeymen free agent pickups Channing Frye, Ben Gordon, Luke Ridnour and Willie Green who have offered little to help expedite the development. But Orlando (15-37) shouldn’t have the same record after 52 games as it did last season. Five losing streaks of at least four games before the all-star break implied that the situation had somehow regressed.\n\nLosing is still the ideal since the Magic’s rebuild is far from complete and the team could use another talented young piece through the draft to be taken seriously as a playoff contender. But Orlando has been a dreadful defensive team, ranking 25th in defensive efficiency and 24th in points allowed. The Magic has surrendered at least 100 points in 14 consecutive games. A lackluster defense might have been offset by an efficient offense, but it ranked 28th in offensive efficiency.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJames Borrego will take over as interim coach but Scott Skiles, a former NBA coach and Magic point guard, has been mentioned as a possible long-term replacement. George Karl is also itching for a return to the bench. Despite the slow recovery from the Howard era, Orlando remains an attractive job, with potential ready to be untapped. But Hennigan will have to find the right coach to bring it all together so that next season, the Magic is no longer the odd-ball member of the lousy, lottery bunch."
