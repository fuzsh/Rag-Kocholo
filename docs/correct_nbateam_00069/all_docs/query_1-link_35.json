        "text": "The Mavericks made their last-minute, four-player trade at Thursday’s deadline official on Friday morning. JJ Redick and Nicolo Melli will soon join the team as Dallas aims to climb the Western Conference standings in the coming weeks.\n\nSo, what can Mavericks fans learn about Redick, the marquee name in the deal?\n\nHere are 10 things to know about the sharp-shooting 36-year-old who’s made waves in the media and college rivalry realms, too.\n\nThe basics\n\nBirthday: June 24, 1984\n\nPosition: Shooting/point guard\n\nHeight: 6-3\n\nWeight: 200 pounds\n\nDraft: No. 11 overall in 2006 by the Orlando Magic\n\nBasketball family\n\nRedick, who was born in Tennessee, has four siblings who were also college athletes.\n\nHis sisters played basketball: two at Campbell and one at Virginia Tech and Drexel. His younger brother was a tight end at Marshall.\n\nRedick’s dad also played basketball at Ohio Wesleyan, but none of his family members’ sports careers can compare to Redick’s national success and attention.\n\nCoach Mike Krzyzewski has called Redick the best pure shooter in Duke history. With Duke’s love-to-hate-it reputation, Redick in four college seasons — while shooting 40.6% from three and 91% from the foul line — became one of the sport’s all-time villains for opposing fanbases.\n\nMore on that later.\n\nHis Mavs role\n\nShortly after news broke of the trade, Mavericks owner Mark Cuban gave SportsDay’s Brad Townsend a glimpse at how the team expects Redick to fit in.\n\n“We wanted shooting,” Cuban said, “and think JJ will not only help spread the court, but be an amazing teacher for our young guards.”\n\nIn almost 15 NBA seasons, Redick has a 41.47% career three-point shooting percentage (19th best in NBA history) with 1,935 made threes (15th all-time). The latter ranks just behind the Trail Blazers’ Damian Lillard (1957) and the Lakers’ LeBron James (1973).\n\nWith 30 games — and perhaps at least one playoff series — remaining in Dallas season, Redick, who is 47 made threes behind Dirk Nowitzki’s career 1982, has a chance to pass the Mavericks’ legend while in the same uniform.\n\nHis off-court role\n\nThe Mavericks didn’t just trade for a strong shooter in Redick.\n\nThey also received a rising media personality who co-hosts a popular podcast, The Old Man and the Three, and has founded a production company. On his show, Redick discusses current events and interviews athletes and figures from throughout the NBA, sports, entertainment and political realms.\n\nRedick’s recent guests include former Pelicans teammate Zion Williamson, New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell, and comedian and actor Kenan Thompson.\n\nKeep an eye out for appearances from his new Mavericks teammates.\n\nHe’s well traveled\n\nThe Mavericks will be Redick’s sixth NBA team since he entered the league in 2006.\n\nHe’s played for the Magic (2006-13), had a brief post-trade stint with the Bucks (2013), signed with the Clippers for four years (2013-17) and did two years apiece with the 76ers (2017-2019) and Pelicans (2019-21).\n\nHis arrival in Dallas will also mark a reunion with a former teammate: Redick and Boban Marjanovic overlapped for a few months in Philadelphia during the 2018-19 season.\n\nLast offseason, Marjanovic joined Redick’s Buckets on Buckets video venture for KFC, and, as in most situations involving Marjanovic, hilarity ensued.\n\nA seventh team on the way?\n\nThe Mavericks still have almost seven weeks of the regular season remaining — and likely a playoff run to follow — before the season ends, but Redick’s contract status will be a storyline to watch for this offseason.\n\nHe’s in the final season of the two-year, $26.5 million deal he signed with New Orleans in 2019 and will be an unrestricted free agent this offseason.\n\nWith the NBA’s salary cap in limbo due to pandemic-induced financial fluctuations, Redick could be on the move again in a few months. Or the Mavericks could use some of their pending cap space to retain the veteran for scoring and leadership off the bench.\n\nNot always fun and games\n\nOne situation Redick faced while at Duke likely wasn’t as enjoyable for him as some of the media and entertainment opportunities he’s pursued as a pro.\n\nIn 2004, fans of Maryland’s basketball team — one of Duke’s biggest rivals — discovered Redick’s cell phone number, according to a Grantland article, and spread it widely at bars. Redick at the time estimated then he received more than 50 calls a night before changing his number.\n\nA year later, he had to do so again when North Carolina fans discovered his new number.\n\nHis parents, he’s told reporters, faced the same situation on their home phone.\n\nRedick’s history in Frisco\n\nHis forays into the Texas basketball landscape are brief, but Redick has played in North Texas for reasons other than to face the Mavericks.\n\nIn July 2005, Redick led the USA Basketball U21 world championship team to the gold medal in the Global Games, held at what was then the Dr. Pepper Star Center in Frisco. Redick scored 15 points in the final win over Team Texas.\n\nA few weeks later, Redick and the team won gold at the FIBA U21 World Championships in Argentina, the highlight of his national team tenure..\n\nPlayoff power\n\nRedick’s teams made the playoffs in his first 13 seasons in the NBA before the Pelicans finished as a lottery team last season.\n\nRedick has played in 110 career playoff games, including 70 starts. The Mavericks’ 14 other players have combined to play in 104 postseason contests.\n\nRedick has participated in two conference finals and saw time in all four NBA Finals games in the Magic’s 2009 series loss to the Lakers.\n\nThe Mavs’ JJ history\n\nLikely in a coincidence — but maybe a new secret to building a playoff roster — Redick is the fourth player with a “JJ” nickname or initials the Mavericks have signed or traded in the past four months.\n\nThe trend started Nov. 21, when the Mavericks included Justin Jackson in a three-team trade to acquire veteran forward James Johnson, whose Twitter handle references his JJ nickname.\n\nA few days later, the team announced it had re-signed longtime fan favorite guard J.J. Barea, for a final training camp.\n\nThe Mavericks then traded Johnson to the Pelicans to acquire Redick, completing their four-month, four-JJ cycle.\n\n==="
