        "text": "Former Philadelphia 76ers guard JJ Redick is one of the better TV personalities in basketball media right now as he uses his knowledge of the game to help educate fans and better their understanding of the game.\n\nRedick had a very successful NBA career as he played 15 seasons averaging 12.8 points and shooting 41.5% from deep. He played two seasons for the Sixers and had a lot of success playing next to Joel Embiid. He shot 40.7% from deep across two seasons in Philadelphia.\n\nWhen asked to put together a starting lineup of his former teammates, Redick included Embiid alongside Blake Griffin, Jimmy Butler, Chris Paul, and Luka Doncic. It was originally Vince Carter instead of Doncic, but Redick was then reminded that he played with Doncic for two months in Dallas.\n\nEmbiid had a terrific on-court synergy with Redick. Due to Redick’s elite shooting ability and his basketball IQ combined with Embiid’s dominance, the two-man game in which the two of them played was almost unstoppable on a nightly basis."
