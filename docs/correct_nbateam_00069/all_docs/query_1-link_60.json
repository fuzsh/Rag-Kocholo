        "text": "The Orlando Magic's new identity should be apparent from the beginning of tonight's preseason opener at Amway Arena. New coach Stan Van Gundy is building his team around Dwight Howard, Rashard Lewis and a bunch of interchangeable parts.\n\n\"I'm nowhere near deciding a lineup, nowhere near,'' Van Gundy said. \"Other than Dwight and Rashard, everything's up for grabs.''\n\nThe Magic will play the Atlanta Hawks tonight in the first of eight games in an exhibition season that includes a 10-day trip to China.\n\nThe rest of the lineup will include some combination of Hedo Turkoglu, Trevor Ariza, Jameer Nelson, J.J. Redick and Keith Bogans, with Keyon Dooling sidelined tonight by an abdominal strain. Tony Battie, who stared 66 games last season, is expected to miss the entire season after getting shoulder surgery.\n\nVan Gundy's master plan is built around Howard, the 21-year-old All-Star center, and the 6-foot-10 Lewis, who signed a $118 million contract after playing nine seasons in Seattle. The playing time of the other players will be determined by their ability to fit in around Howard and Lewis.\n\n\"I would eventually like to settle on a starting lineup,'' Van Gundy said. \"It would be the one that when you look at other teams' lineups, you think it matches up best at the start of most games, not necessarily what you think your best five are.\n\n\"It's who you want Dwight to match up with, who you want Rashard to have to match up with early in the game. It's more than just a direct competition that this guy is better than that guy; it's really a lot more than that.''\n\nRedick, coming off a disappointing and injury-riddled rookie season, is competing with Ariza and Bogans at the shooting-guard spot vacated by Grant Hill. Van Gundy says the minutes there will be determined by defense.\n\n\"Starting or coming off the bench, I know my role is going to be defend first,'' Bogans said.\n\nThe presence of Lewis, who averaged more than 20 points per game in each of his last three years with the Sonics, will change the nature of Orlando's offense.\n\nAfter playing small forward in Seattle, he will play mostly power forward with the Magic.\n\n\"It is a little bit of a transition, but I was a post-up player in Seattle,'' Lewis said.\n\n\"It's more different defensively than offensively because you have to rebound more, you have to help down low, and you have to be able to help on the pick-and-roll.''\n\nLewis made 151 3-pointers last season, and Van Gundy intends to take advantage of that threat.\n\n\"The two position now is a 3-point shooting position; it wasn't last year. And with Rashard on the floor, the four is a 3-point shooting position now. So we're spreading things out a lot on the floor,'' he said.\n\nHoward, who led the NBA in dunks last season, will also be encouraged to take a jump shot when the opportunity arises.\n\n\"They have confidence in my shooting,'' Howard said. \"I've been working on my shot all summer. It'll be good to have a chance to use it.''\n\n[ Dick Scanlon can be reached at 863-802-7554 or at dick.scanlon@theledger.com ]"
