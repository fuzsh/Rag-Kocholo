        "text": "The Orlando Magic has surprised a lot of people this season with its play, and the team has gained a lot of new believers as a result.\n\nOn a recent episode of First Take, the cast discussed who could pose a threat to the Boston Celtics in the Eastern Conference. When Stephen A. Smith mentioned the New York Knicks, former Magic player JJ Redick said that Orlando could pose a threat to them and the Celtics.\n\n\"They are currently slated to play the Orlando Magic, who are no slouch,\" Redick said. \"Jamahl Mosley should be in the running for coach of the year, they've got two of the best young wings in the NBA, and Jalen Suggs has figured his three-ball out and has a chance to make an All-Defensive team. Don't sleep on the Orlando Magic to be a very tough playoff matchup for anyone in the East.\"\n\nIf the season ended right now, then the fifth-seeded Magic would be up against the fourth-seeded Knicks in the first round. And with how banged up the roster of New York is right now, anything could happen.\n\nThe Magic has won four games in a row, and if its winning streak continues, then it could end the season as a higher seed than the Knicks, as only half a game separates the two teams right now."
