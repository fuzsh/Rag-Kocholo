        "text": "The Orlando Magic are an American professional basketball team based in Orlando, Florida. They are part of the Southeast Division of the Eastern Conference in the National Basketball Association (NBA). The franchise was established in 1989 as an expansion franchise, and has had such notable NBA stars such as Shaquille O'Neal, Penny Hardaway, Grant Hill, Tracy McGrady, Steve Francis, Dwight Howard, and Rashard Lewis throughout its young history. The franchise has also been in the playoffs for more than half of their existence (14 playoff appearances in 24 years). Orlando has been the most successful of the four expansion teams brought into the league in 1988 and 1989 in terms of winning percentage. As of 2012, they are the only team in the \"big four\" sports leagues to play in the city of Orlando.\n\n2012-present: Rebuilding\n\nFollowing the trade of Dwight Howard, the Magic entered into a state of rebuilding with Maurice Harkless and Nikola Vucevic. On August 29, the Magic signed free agent guard E'Twaun Moore. On December 2, 2012, Howard's first game against his former team, the Magic defeated the Lakers 113-103.\n\nOn February 21, 2013, the Magic traded J.J. Redick, Ish Smith & Gustavo Ay√≥n to the Milwaukee Bucks. In return, the Magic received Beno Udrih, Tobias Harris and rookie Doron Lamb. The Magic also traded Josh McRoberts to the Charlotte Bobcats for Hakim Warrick who was waived 2 days later. The Magic finish the 2012-2013 season 20-62 as the worst record in the NBA, missing the playoffs for the first time since 2006.\n\nOrlando Magic Roster"
