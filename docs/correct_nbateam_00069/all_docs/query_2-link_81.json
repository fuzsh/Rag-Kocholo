        "text": "Former NBA player JJ Redick, known for his shooting prowess, has agreed to become the next head coach of the Los Angeles Lakers in a four-year deal, ESPN reported on Thursday.\n\nThe Duke University product and 15-year NBA veteran has no coaching experience and replaces Darvin Ham, who was fired after two seasons. Most recently, Redick served as an NBA analyst on ESPN, appearing on SportsCenter, Get Up, First Take and as a member of ESPN’s NBA broadcast crew.\n\nRedick already has established chemistry with Lakers star LeBron James, as the two co-host the Mind the Game podcast that premiered in March. Across the eight episodes released, they discuss the state of the NBA and pick each other’s basketball minds. The analysis they have given while breaking down plays may serve as a preview of the dynamic the two will have with Redick on the sidelines next season.\n\nBefore deciding to hire Redick, the Lakers reportedly pursued UConn coach Dan Hurley, but Hurley turned down a reported six-year, $70 million offer from LA to chase a third straight national championship with the Huskies.\n\nRedick’s reputation as a sharpshooter is based on his offensive prowess. He is a career 41.5% shooter from 3-point range. One of his best seasons was 2015-16 with the Clippers when he shot a career-best 47.5% from deep. The Clippers lost in the first round to Portland.\n\nRedick made a total of $116.4 million in his career, according to Spotrac.\n\nOver the last decade, former NBA players with little to no coaching experience have assumed head coaching roles with varying results.\n\nFormer Suns star Steve Nash had no prior NBA coaching experience before Brooklyn hired him in 2020. He was subsequently fired seven games into the 2022-23 campaign and went 94-67 during his three seasons. Brooklyn made the playoffs in his first two seasons under Nash and advanced as far as the Eastern Conference semifinals.\n\nFormer Lakers guard Derek Fisher took over as head coach of the New York Knicks also without any NBA coaching experience. His teams went 40-96 during his two seasons, missing the playoffs in both.\n\nJason Kidd has been one of the most successful NBA players without prior experience to transition to coaching. His lone season as Brooklyn’s head coach ended with a 44-38 record and a loss in the Eastern Conference semifinals in 2013-14. He then spent four years in Milwaukee and mentored a young Giannis Antetokounmpo. Under Kidd, the Bucks never advanced beyond the first round. After two seasons as a Lakers assistant, things clicked for Kidd in Dallas as the Mavericks made it to the NBA Finals, where they lost to the Boston Celtics."
