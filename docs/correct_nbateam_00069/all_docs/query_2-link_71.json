        "text": "After spending his last four seasons with the Los Angeles Clippers, J.J. Redick agreed to a one-year, $23 million deal this summer with the Sixers to join the process in Philadelphia. Aside from being one of the best three-point shooters in the league, Redick is also one of the most engaging personalities off the court, as he’s shown with his critically acclaimed podcast that is currently on hiatus.\n\nRedick has been outspoken about Donald Trump and the current administration. At media day in Philadelphia last month, Redick was asked whether he feels more responsibility as a white player to step up. He responded: “I don’t think it has anything to do with being white. I’ve certainly never been oppressed because of the color of my skin. I’m a human and can certainly relate to any emotion that humans have felt. I think being anti-Trump at this point is sort of like eating breakfast in the morning.”\n\nWe caught up with the 33-year-old shooting guard to talk about all of that, Christopher Nolan movies, meeting Harry Styles, checking the news in the Trump era, dream podcast guests, and, of course, his watch collection.\n\nGQ: So, any updates on your watch collection? Has it grown over the last few years?\n\nJ.J. Redick: To be honest with you, it shrunk. I’m in a place right now where I’m trying to define my own essentialism and my value system, not just with things, but with people and time. It all really started when I had my first son, and when I had my second son, it quickened the pace of me figuring things out. It feels like a mid-life crisis prior to my mid-life crisis. I’m down to my bare essentials right now. I have a vintage Rolex Daytona, a Zenith Daytona and a dress watch, and that’s it.\n\nAbout the mid-life crisis before the mid-life crisis, did you just start re-evaluating material things differently?\n\nI’ve never valued material things. I’ve always been more attached to people. The pursuit of material things takes time, and I realized my time is very valuable especially during the season. My time with my kids, what I do to take care of my body, and of course any intellectual pursuits I may have on the side. Those are all things that I value.\n\nThe watch collection, and I’m not afraid to admit this, was an obsession. It is an obsession. It’s an addiction. I’m an addict. Like many watch collectors, I had to admit that to myself. It was something I had to go through the last few years in order to figure it out.\n\nAnother interest you have is movies, especially Christopher Nolan films, but I saw on Twitter you didn’t really enjoy Dunkirk.\n\nI’m a Christopher Nolan fiend. I love Inception, Interstellar, The Prestige, Memento and of course the Batman trilogy. I love all his movies. I don’t think the meta [story] of Dunkirk was like over my head. I get what he was trying to get across. I just didn’t enjoy it. It wasn’t an enjoyable movie. It was boring. I don’t know how anyone can sit through that and be like, ‘Oh my god, what an awesome film.’ There was no emotional attachment to anything. The story of World War II, it touches people, but as a movie, it was missing something.\n\nWe should clarify for the One Direction fans that you did say Harry Styles was the best part of the movie.\n\nHarry Styles was amazing, So, Ben Winston [executive producer of The Late, Late Show with James Corden] is one of my best friends. He’s a great mate of mine and I’ve had many Shabbat dinners with him. I actually had a Shabbat dinner with Ben and Harry last season. Harry had just finished filming part of Dunkirk and was getting ready to go back to finish filming. I was just shocked at how down to earth he was. He’s a hell of a human being. He really is just a kind, good hearted person.\n\nDid you have a chance to check out his album?\n\nYeah. His album’s good. I liked it.\n\nYou got a dap from Drake at the game in Toronto, who initiated that exchange?\n\nI’ve never said hi to Drake. I don’t know him. I came to the scorer’s table, he gave me the nod, so I went over to say hello. He knows Chris Paul, so I feel like we run in the same circles a little bit.\n\nDid you get a chance to check out Eminem’s freestyle about Donald Trump?\n\nI missed it. But I did see him getting hyped at the Detroit Pistons game the other night though.\n\n\"There’s really no excuse for some of the behavior from the current administration, like there’s no slant that is twisting some of the despicable things that are happening right now.\"\n\nYou’ve said you’re as anti-Trump as it gets. I know you keep up with the news regularly. With so much happening on a day-to-day basis, are you still keeping up?\n\nThat’s what I use Twitter for. I’m mostly there for the news. I hit the refresh button on Business Insider a lot. I follow along very closely, like the issue with John Kelly and the Gold Star family right now. I try to do as much of my own research as possible. I’m also aware that certain outlets and certain writers have a slant that they’re trying to get across, but there’s really no excuse for some of the behavior from the current administration, like there’s no slant that is twisting some of the despicable things that are happening right now.\n\nYou released a documentary about your free agency process this summer. In it, you mentioned your son Knox’s favorite NBA player is Chris Paul. Now that you’re a Sixer, is there any chance you’ll finally be his favorite NBA player?\n\nI hope so. So I have this routine during the offseason for eight years now, where I go to the gym and make 342 shots every Sunday. I know, it’s a weird routine. I started taking him to the gym on Sundays, and other than going to a few Clippers games, he’s never been around basketball. I took him to five straight Sundays this summer, and a few days later, I’m in this play gym with a bunch of kids and I lost him for a second. Then I look over, and there was a basket in the corner, and he’s got a ball, and in perfect form, he crouched down and shot a jumper, with the follow through and everything. It was just a very proud moment as a father for me. Hopefully someday I can be his favorite player. I’m sure he’ll look up to me. But he likes Joel Embiid. He loved DeAndre Jordan and Chris [Paul] in Los Angeles. Joel is his guy right now.\n\nYou’ve done free agency a few times. I always read about players getting cool personalized gifts as free agents. Do you have a cool gift that you’ve kept from one of these free agency meetings?\n\nBryan Colangelo gave me an iPad, but that wasn’t really the coolest part of the meeting. So we went to his office, and this was like at 1:30 in the morning, we had finished meeting Brett Brown on the court, and there was like eight of us in Colangelo’s office, and he hands me a Sixers jersey with the number 17. He was like, “Sorry, we couldn’t get it made with the number four in time, so we just put the year on it.” I took it home with me, and a few days after signing with them, they asked me what number I wanted to wear, and the number four was retired [for Dolph Schayes], so I was like, it’s fate, I’m picking 17. So that’s why I picked 17. I still have the jersey Colangelo handed me that night.\n\nHe was a guest on your podcast this summer. Are you going to be bringing back the podcast regularly this season.\n\nI’m in a little bit of a transition right now. I switched agencies, so I’m trying to figure out what I can do with the podcast. Again, it goes back to essentialism and time. It’s something that I really enjoy doing and I want to do, but I’m just trying to figure it out.\n\nIf and when the podcast comes back, who are your dream guests?\n\nBill Murray. Barack Obama. And I’m going to throw a curveball with my third pick: David Solomon, the president of Goldman Sachs. I know him a little, and he did a podcast the other day that was so enlightening. It was amazing. Some of the stuff he says is just next level.\n\nWatch Now:\n\nThe Future Athletic Greats"
