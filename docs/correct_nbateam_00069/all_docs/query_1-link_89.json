        "text": "No sooner had the Lakers reached the off-season than the team management parted ways with Darvin Ham. Now, after more than a month of an extensive search process, the top job has been granted to former Orlando Magic player JJ Redick. Being a renowned analyst with an extensive basketball IQ, along with sharing a close professional friendship with LeBron James, Redick was speculated to be the top choice by several NBA enthusiasts from the very start. While reports have confirmed the news, the team management is officially set to lock in JJ’s name soon.\n\nJJ Redick is set to be announced as the next head coach of the Los Angeles Lakers on the 24 of June, at 1:30 PM PT (Pacific Time). The announcement, scheduled to be made at the franchise’s practice facility located in El Segundo, California, will coincide with the future HC’s 40 birthday. According to The Athletic journalist Jovan Buha, the live event can be witnessed by viewers from around the world on the official YouTube channel of the Lakers. Taking to his official X account, he spread the word. JJ Redick being confirmed as Lakers HC was first reported by ESPN less than a week ago. Within the next few hours, Jovan Buha, Shams Charania, and others reported that he had agreed to sign on to a 4-year, $32 million contract with the franchise.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nThis deal will offer a much lower annual amount than what Redick had secured during his final year as a player with the Mavs. Furthermore, it is also drastically less than the 6-year, $70 million contract that the Lakers were initially prepared to offer UConn head coach Dan Hurley for the same posting. Other than YouTube, NBA viewers can also avail the benefits of Spectrum’s subscription services. However, being free and available from any corner of the world, YouTube would ideally be the way to go.\n\nWhat strategic plans does JJ Redick have for the Los Angeles Lakers?\n\nThe 2023-24 season for the Lakers saw an overall poor performance from the roster, despite possessing stars like LeBron James, Anthony Davis, D’Angelo Russell, etc. The franchise barely managed to make it to the playoffs and ended up losing in the first round to the defending champions Denver Nuggets. With Bron approaching 40 by the end of the year, and with a need to improve the offensive prowess dominating the conversation, JJ Redick may already have some plans in place on how to proceed.\n\nAccording to a recent The Athletic article by Jovan Buha and Shams Charania, the future head coach is set to bring a key change to the overall offense play by modernizing it. “He (Redick) explained his decision-making process when it comes to strategy, how the analysis and empirical evidence would always guide his choices rather than preconceived notions or outdated beliefs,” they wrote.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\n“Redick described a system moulded around this roster, focusing on elevating Anthony Davis’ involvement, particularly late in games, and alleviating the constant ballhandling duties on James by utilizing him more off the ball.” While seldom getting the opportunity to apply the same in reality, Redick has reportedly studied the modern techniques of coaching thanks to his previous role as an analyst and podcaster. By bringing in a new system, he can change how LeBron and Davis have been handling the ball till now, allowing Austin Reaves to be a part of more three-man attacks, and develop players like Rui Hachimura, Max Christie and whoever they pick in the upcoming draft.\n\nMaybe even Bronny James, who knows.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nBefore leaving, be sure to check out some insights that Shaquille O’Neal’s ex-agent, Leonard Armato, shared about the Lakers legend’s infamous feud with the late Kobe Bryant."
