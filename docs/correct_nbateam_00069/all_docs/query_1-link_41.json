        "text": "LOS ANGELES -- The Los Angeles Lakers' coaching search has been very public, seemingly chaotic and dominated by famous names.\n\nTotally Hollywood, in other words.\n\nThe Lakers' reported plan to offer a massive contract to UConn Coach Dan Hurley is the latest twist in the monthlong race to replace Darvin Ham, who was fired May 3 after two seasons.\n\nThe Lakers were knocked out of the first round of the current playoffs, but the 17-time NBA champion franchise has nicely filled the void of hoops drama during the week before the NBA Finals with steady leaks about the progress of their quest for a coach who can win a title -- and almost as vitally, a coach who can entice LeBron James to finish his career in purple and gold.\n\nAccording to a person with knowledge of the lengthy search, the Lakers have strongly considered J.J. Redick, the former player and current ESPN analyst who does a podcast with James; Hurley, the back-to-back national championship-winning coach of the Huskies; and James Borrego, the respected former Charlotte Hornets coach and ex-Gregg Popovich assistant who spent last season on New Orleans' staff.\n\nThe person spoke on condition of anonymity because the Lakers aren't commenting publicly on the search to replace Ham.\n\nBut they sure are commenting privately.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Athletic reported that Redick shockingly was the frontrunner despite his total lack of coaching experience. On Thursday, the search took another wild turn when ESPN reported the Lakers were instead targeting Hurley, whose candidacy hadn't even been mentioned in many discussions of the job.\n\nThe crazy twists are representative of the various factions within the Lakers' brain trust of owner Jeanie Buss and General Manager Rob Pelinka dispensing narratives to their favored media outlets. The Lakers previously seemed unlikely to make an official hire before the end of the NBA Finals, but the person who spoke to the AP said even that could change, depending on their progress.\n\nWhile the Dallas Mavericks and the Boston Celtics waited a week to begin the NBA Finals, the Lakers have dominated talk radio, television and message boards with speculation on the best choice to lead James and the Lakers back to contention for a second title together.\n\nThe Lakers are making their coaching change at a critical juncture for the franchise's partnership with the NBA's career scoring leader.\n\nThe 39-year-old James just completed his 21st season while playing at a higher level than anyone with that much experience in basketball history, but he has until June 29 to decide whether to exercise his $51.4 million player option for the 2024-25 season.\n\nJames could take the deal, or he could sign an even bigger new contract for more years -- or he could become a free agent for the first time in six years.\n\nWhile 31-year-old Anthony Davis is the Lakers' foundation with a long-term contract in Los Angeles, Buss and Pelinka are clearly determined to keep James alongside him for as long as possible -- even publicly floating their willingness to draft his son, Bronny, who just completed one brief collegiate season at USC.\n\nWhile agent Rich Paul has said James is not involved in the coaching search as he prepares to play for the U.S. at the Paris Olympics, the Lakers' candidates seem designed to appeal to him.\n\nJames' connection with Redick is well-known. James also recently praised Hurley on social media following a podcast interview between Redick and Hurley.\n\nHurley has won 141 games in six seasons at UConn, rolling to the past two national titles in impressive fashion. The addition of the nation's top collegiate coach to the Lakers could be enticing to James and his son, who likely still needs extensive development to be a serviceable NBA player.\n\nThe Lakers' relative underachievement this season despite a healthy James and Davis was primarily blamed on Ham, the first-time head coach who dismayed many fans and observers with his rotations, preparation and strategic acumen. The Lakers have chased savvy basketball minds in their latest search, no matter their pedigree: Redick's encyclopedic understanding of the game has been on display in his podcast with James, while Hurley favors an NBA-friendly style of play that should translate well to the biggest basketball stage."
