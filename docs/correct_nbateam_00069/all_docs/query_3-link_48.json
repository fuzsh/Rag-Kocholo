        "text": "The Lakers introduced JJ Redick as their new pick for head coach this afternoon at the organization's El Segundo headquarters.\n\nWhile a novice to coaching professionally, Redick has a 15-year NBA playing career under his belt, as well as success in media roles as an ESPN broadcaster and podcast host.\n\nAt the Monday afternoon news conference, Redick said the process has been surreal and that he is grateful and thankful for being entrusted to the position as head coach. He immediately addressed his lack of professional coaching experience.\n\n\"I have never coached in the NBA before, I don't know if you guys have heard that,\" Redick said. \"My motivations for doing this starts with the very simple foundation of service ... it starts with the desire to serve players to serve the Lakers organization, to serve our fans, its also about competition and performance, collaboration, leadership â€“ these are the things that drive me.\"\n\nThe 39-year-old played with the Orlando Magic, Milwaukee Bucks, Los Angeles Clippers, Philadelphia 76ers, New Orleans Pelicans and the Dallas Mavericks. He played college basketball at Duke University.\n\nRedick had been among those on a short-list for the Lakers head coaching role to successor Darvin Ham, who was fired May 3 four days after the Lakers lost in the first round of the playoffs.\n\nAfter UConn men's basketball coach Dan Hurley rejected the Lakers' offer, the organization circled back and picked Redick. As he addressed questions from media Monday he said after the Hurley news broke, he was quick to get a phone call.\n\n\"During that whole four-day period, like at no point was my ego, or feelings hurt or bruised in any way. Dan Hurley is a two-time national champion at UConn. I am a two-time 55 Swish League champion in the third and fourth-grade division, like I understood, you know, I understood,\" Redick said.\n\nLakers general manager Rob Pelinka said naming the new head coach was based on concepts of innovation, forward thinking and breaking free from \"a sea of sameness.\"\n\n\"It was really important to us to see if we could do something different. And quickly with our conversations with JJ, it was very evident that he had a unique perspective and philosophy on basketball and how it's to be taught,\" Pelinka said.\n\nIn a recent social media post on X, Lakers legend Magic Johnson wrote, \"I'm cautiously optimistic that this new hire is a success for both the Lakers and JJ Redick.\"\n\nJohnson went on to compliment Redick's playing abilities and his high basketball IQ. \"If he can bring how he played professionally to the Lakers -- this could work out! But will his transition from star basketball player to head coach end up like Steve Kerr, Jason Kidd, Ty Lue, or Doc Rivers or the former NBA players turned coaches who weren't successful?,\" Johnson wrote.\n\nRedick has a connection to the Lakers already, as he and LeBron James host \"Mind the Game\" podcast together. The ninth episode went up two weeks ago, where the two delivered an hour-long NBA finals preview.\n\nA pioneer of podcasting, Redick became the second active player with a podcast in 2016, following NFL linebacker A.J. Hawk.\n\nRedick will serve as the organization's seventh head coach since the legendary Phil Jackson retired in 2011."
