        "text": "Kevin C. Cox/Getty Images\n\nESPN Radio just reported that the Orlando Magic have matched a contract offer by the Chicago Bulls to retain JJ Redick for $19 Million over 3 years.\n\n\"J.J. is a valuable part of our organization, both on the court and in our community,\" said Magic GM Otis Smith through a statement released on the team website.\n\nThe upcoming 2010-2011 season will be Redick's fifth year in the league. Last season the former Duke standout played all 82 games and averaged 9.6 points and 1.9 assists per game.\n\nThis certainly didn't seem foreseeable for Redick early in his career, even after he was the 11th overall pick in the 2006 NBA Draft.\n\nIn his sophomore season of 2007-2008, he averaged just four points in eight minutes of play per game, and he wasn't much of a factor during Orlando's Finals run against the Lakers last season either.\n\nHowever, this year we saw glimpses of that old J.J. in the dark blue Duke jersey when he used to rain threes on the likes of Maryland and UNC.\n\nJ.J. is a smart ball player and he showed much improvement in that Eastern Conference Finals against the Celtics. Even though the Magic lost, No. 7 was a significant factor off the bench and this is a great move by the Magic."
