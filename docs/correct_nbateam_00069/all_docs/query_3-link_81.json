        "text": "In 2016, I started collecting material for what I envisioned would be a book on — for lack of a better term — journeymen and glue guys in the NBA. That is, players who weren’t superstars or All-Stars but who nonetheless managed to make a career of it, sticking in the league for 10+ years and being contributors wherever they went. I’ve always been fascinated by this type of player: athletes who were often the best player on any team they were on right up until they reached the highest echelon of the sport and then had to learn how to adapt to that.\n\nWith the future of said project very much up in the air due to some life and career changes, I thought I would post some of the interviews I did as Q+As. J.J. Redick was the third of three Duke players I spoke with. Redick has so far played for the Orlando Magic, Milwaukee Bucks, L.A. Clippers and is currently playing for the Philadelphia 76ers. I spoke with him by phone just before the start of the 2016–17 season.\n\nIf you could go back and tell your rookie self anything, what would it be?\n\n“It’s gonna be OK, don’t drive your car into the lake.”\n\nBut seriously, I was just reading something just now while I was eating my lunch about Sarah Paulson, who won an Emmy last night, and she had this poignant statement about success coming too soon. She said, “If I had had success early on in my career when I was in my 20s and I thought that you didn’t have to fully commit and fully prepare things, it would have ruined me.” And that’s sort of been the trajectory of my career. I’ve had to learn and it didn’t take seven years, it took two years, but I had to learn the value of fully committing yourself and fully preparing for your job. And I’m really glad that it wasn’t easy early on. I think the advice to my rookie self would just be to be patient and to just put your head down and work. There’s really no substitute for that.\n\nDid you feel like you were unprepared for the level of work it took at the NBA level?\n\nWell, no: I think I’m grateful that nothing was given to me. I think there’s a distinction to be made because I do think that I understood how difficult it was going to be and I also didn’t necessarily have sort of these grandiose plans to play in the NBA. So for me, I’ve far exceeded any career goals that I could have imagined in terms of longevity, role, salary, these are all things that I’ve sort of exceeded my own expectations. I always tell this story but I took Italian my junior year at Duke for three semesters because I thought that if I had to go play overseas I’d want to go play in Italy. So there was no sort of expectation for me that I’m gonna come in the NBA and immediately make a name for myself.\n\nIf anything, to be honest with you, I probably wish that I had maybe had higher expectations for myself. I think when you’re younger and you’re a rookie, you sort of read things or you hear things. I’ll give you an example: coming out before the draft, you read things about your weaknesses and everybody talks about your weaknesses and they’re sort of self-perpetuating if you believe them. At some point, you have to be mature enough to block out the noise and just work. And whether that’s working on your weaknesses — for me, that was working on my body. The summer after my second year that was really big for me and then if you look at my second year on, every year — especially in Orlando — I had to adjust how I played a little bit just to fit in and help the team win.\n\nAnd the other thing I would say, just from my first two years, I had a back injury, a herniated disc, that was diagnosed two weeks before the draft at the combine so I didn’t play Summer League and I missed all of preseason and the second day of training camp I had a foot injury and was in a boot for all of preseason. And so there was no time for me to gain trust my rookie year, so I wasn’t really even in uniform until the end of January. And then my second year we had a new coach and Stan [Van Gundy] likes to use September to sort of teach his principles.\n\nWell, I broke my hand in August after a great Summer League and missed all of September. And I really was behind the eight-ball because his defensive principles were so different than anything I’d been taught. So I didn’t have a great October and preseason with him, so I felt like my first two years — and I’m not making excuses — it’s just the reality was: I wasn’t prepared and I wasn’t physically at my top form to compete for minutes.\n\nLet me just say one other thing about the early part of my career. The other aspect of that which you see a lot is, a guy will get drafted essentially to a bad team or a team that’s young and he’s given minutes. I don’t want to knock certain guys, but guys are sort of given minutes and you get to sort of figure out what you can and cannot do and there’s no substitute for game experience and that’s how you build confidence. You can’t build confidence by doing an individual workout with a skill development coach. You build confidence by playing against NBA players. It seems like every bucket that goes through gives you more and more confidence. I didn’t have that opportunity. I sometimes wonder what would have happened if I had been given that opportunity. But with the exception of my seventh year in Orlando — the first year of their rebuild — I’ve been on “win now” teams my whole career. I’ve been in the playoffs ten years of ten years. I’ve always been in the playoffs. I’ve never really been on a team where they’re like, “Hey, go try shit.” It’s always been, “How can I figure out a way to get what I do well to complement my teammates so that we can win?” That’s always been my protocol for every year. I want to play well, but how does that fit within the realm of helping everyone else play well and our team to win.\n\nWas playing for Duke good preparation for finding your particular role on a winning team, though?\n\nNot necessarily. The thing about my experience — and everybody has a different experience at Duke and Coach coaches every team differently, I think that’s one of his greatest strengths, his adaptability year to year and era to era — and I was in sort of a weird era where he didn’t want to recruit one-and-done guys and then ’05 was the first year that guys had to come to college. So if you look at my first two years we were really young, my last two years we barely had any good players. My junior year, I think we had eight scholarship players. My senior year I think three guys ended up playing in the league, I think two of us are still in the league. So it wasn’t like I was on these dominant teams. So I think what my experience at Duke was, especially my junior and senior year, you go play, we’re going to cater to your skillset and you just go play and everyone else will adjust to you. That is COMPLETELY different than my experience in the NBA.\n\nThat just doesn’t happen for a lot of rookies — or even players period — in the NBA.\n\nIt’s crazy to say that, but listen, I always break it down this way. There’s five percent of the NBA, maybe ten percent, where if you put them on any team they’d probably pretty much be the same player and have similar stats. These are the LeBrons, the Chris Pauls, the Dirks in his prime. These are those types of players. It’s really just a small percentage of the NBA. And then there’s the next ten to twenty percent of the guys that are All-Stars or fringe All-Stars where in most situations, given the right timing, the right coach, the right system, they’re going to really shine. And then it’s the rest of the NBA. And so you’re beholden to what’s going on around you. There’s so much that is out of your control.\n\nI’ll give you an example from this past year: Devin Booker. He’s gonna be a great player, but what happens if Brandon Knight and [Eric] Bledsoe don’t get hurt? What happens if there’s not that sort of complete disaster? They were in win-now mode. They were not trying to rebuild or give minutes to a 19-year-old guy, but he fell into that and he obviously took advantage of that. And now his career trajectory is very different, at least how people perceive it, than if Brandon Knight and Bledsoe had been healthy all year and Phoenix maybe was battling for the eighth seed.\n\nWhen you first got into the league, did you have mentors on those early Orlando Magic teams?\n\nYou know, I don’t think I necessarily had mentors. My experience in the NBA may have been similar to Shane [Battier]’s in that you are kind of you’re own entity. You’re kind of on your own a little bit and you’ve sort of got to look out for yourself. I did have some guys who occasionally would give me pep talks or pick me up a little bit. Guys like Keyon Dooling, who’s one of the all-time great teammates, Pat Garrity, Rashard Lewis, Jameer Nelson. These guys were all really, really good teammates, but I don’t know that I had a mentor, necessarily.\n\nI’m interested in Rashard because he came out of high school instead of college and early on it seemed like his career was on a star-type trajectory but he really turned into a glue guy.\n\nHe’s one of the most selfless guys that I’ve been around. I really mean that. For what his salary was and what his role could have been, I mean he initially signed with us to be our small forward and we were going to start Tony Battie that first year in Orlando and he didn’t necessarily want to play power forward and all of a sudden, we along with the Suns sort of revolutionized the way teams play in the NBA by playing Rashard at the four and opening things up and playing four out, one in around Dwight [Howard], which a lot of teams emulate now. Of course, the Suns get all the credit and rightfully so, but we didn’t intentionally want to play that way and Rashard, he never said a word. He’s a veteran, he’s on a max contract, he’s supposed to say: “No, I’m the three.” But no. He didn’t say a word about it. This is gonna help the team, let’s do it.\n\nSo that kind of adaptability on his part was essential for the team’s success, you’d say?\n\nI think adaptable would be a good way to describe it. I think there are some other words, like I would say “not being entitled.” I think that’s something that a lot of guys struggle with. And maybe at times I’ve struggled with that a little bit for a day or two. I think that’s the evil that we all must avoid. Because I think that to me has taken away years off of guys’ careers. Because they feel like, because I did this, I’m now entitled to this. But we all as humans have to live in the present and just because you did something three or four years ago, you have to get over that sort of entitlement. And maybe take a lesser role or whatever. Or come off the bench the last four years of your career.\n\nI think being adaptable is great, but it’s sort of that lack of entitlement. I think Pop talks about that a bunch and that’s something he looks for in players is a lack of entitlement.\n\nHow have you seen the league change in the ten years since you first came in?\n\nCertainly the emphasis on 3-point shooting is huge and shooting in general: the ability to space the floor. I think everybody plays smaller now and teams are realizing now the value of spacing and having versatile players. Especially at the three and four position that can guard and switch. And the importance of rim protection, I think, the value of a good big guy who’s very durable — that’s never gonna change. It’s almost like the league now is four perimeter guys and a center. That’s kinda what teams want and teams look for.\n\nI talk about this all the time: the league has gotten younger and younger. It’s crazy to me how young the league is. You play against certain teams and you’re like, “Man, I been in this league ten years. I don’t even know one player on this team we’re playing. I literally don’t know a player.” That’s how young they are. It is weird, because I think when I first got in the league, there were guys who could get jobs that couldn’t necessarily play anymore. They just would kinda hang out and be a mentor. You see that a little bit, I can think of a couple guys off the top of my head that don’t really contribute much on the court, but that was much more prevalent when I first came in the league. I mean much more prevalent.\n\nWhat’s the reason for that change?\n\nWell, the reason it’s happened is because of the lockout. That’s really the main reason, where every dollar sorta counts. And maybe we’ll get back to that now, now that the salary cap has gone up. But I don’t know. The way the current CBA is structured with the way the luxury tax works and the punitive repeater tax, I think teams would much rather spend less on a project or a younger player than kind of have a veteran guy’s dead weight on their books. That’s really to me the biggest shift, you know, post-2011, teams have just intentionally tried to get younger.\n\nThe other thing with that is, of course, I think there’s been a greater emphasis … when I first came in the league, I don’t remember — maybe I just didn’t pay attention — but I don’t remember when I first came in the league so many teams intentionally tanking. Of course, they sell it a different way. So many teams intentionally tanking. So what they’ve done is: let’s get younger. Let’s just take chances on second round picks. Let’s bring in 19 guys to camp, four guys of which are 20 or 21 years old. The older guys are absolutely getting squeezed out.\n\nSo are teams thinking in a more asset-based way?\n\nWell, I think we’re all essentially assets when it comes down to it. Just in different ways and we’re all defined a little bit differently. We’re all assets. The way teams look at guys and look at their books. Listen, I’m not knocking the numbers guys or the analytics because I think there’s tremendous value in that, but the shift over the last ten years is that front offices are, across the league, it’s more common that they’re being run by analytics guys and not basketball guys. And so it’s less about the people and it’s more about what your number is on the balance sheet or the salary cap.\n\nI don’t necessarily think it’s a good thing for the league the way that is viewed. I do think the analytics and the emphasis on that and the trends that has established, I think that’s fantastic for the play and the actual game, it’s been great.\n\nIs there a risk in going too far toward analytics, in your view?\n\nI think we probably hit peak with the Sixers. We hit peak analytics with the Sixers. I think it’s starting to go back and teams are starting to realize there’s value in — and I hate using the word “eye test” because it’s so stupid — but there’s value in the basketball side of things, the older generation of thinking and then the new side of things. If you can combine the two and the front offices and the teams that are really doing both are doing it the best. I think the tanking thing, the emphasis on that over the last five years, I think that hurt a lot of fanbases and it hurt a lot of organizations and it set a lot of teams back. It really did.\n\nWhat still gets you excited about the game?\n\nI think when you first start playing, you get excited — my fourth year was the first year where I played in every game and I just remember I knew exactly when I was going to go in the game, I knew how many minutes I was going to play, I kinda knew where my shots were. It was a whole new experience for me and that was really exciting and then each year after that, I gotta prove this, I gotta get better. I’ll just be realistic: I’m 32 now and I’m not the most athletic guy in the world, so for me it’s really just squeezing out as much of my peak as I can. I think that’s exciting to me.\n\nThe other thing, too, is I’ve learned really to just enjoy the process. My season starts in mid-July so I’m sort of completing one cycle of my season, which is my offseason and my training and preseason starts and there’s different ways to break down the schedule. I enjoy the process so much and to me that’s really rewarding is knowing how much I put into it on a daily basis and then seeing the result of that. I think that’s exciting to me.\n\nYou know, Steve Nash and I talked a couple years ago about this for a while and he said something really interesting to me. He was going into the last year of his Lakers contract and Steve obviously didn’t need the money. I always kind of assumed that he was kind of hanging on to the Lakers to get that last 9.3 [million] or whatever. But when I saw and realized how hard he was working, I realized it was about something else. I asked him about that and he said, “I’m 39, I’ve got another 40 years or so on Earth: I’ll never be able to play NBA basketball again. Why would I not just try and play as long as I could?” And I’d never really thought about it like that before. So for me that’s exciting, too, because I’ve got kids now and I’d love to still be playing when my youngest Ty is old enough to remember and have memories of that. So there’s certainly motivating factors with that as well."
