        "text": "Matt Slocum/Associated Press\n\nThe list of players available to Team USA for the 2019 FIBA World Championships this summer continues to dwindle, with JJ Redick opting not to participate.\n\nPer Shams Charania of The Athletic and Stadium, Redick declined an invitation because his family is transitioning to New Orleans following his signing with the Pelicans earlier this month.\n\nRedick told ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski he received an invite from USA Basketball to take part in the FIBA World Cup, but didn't want to rush into making a commitment.\n\n\"I'm thrilled beyond belief to be considered but also trying to work through our family's transition to New Orleans,\" Redick said.\n\nCharania noted Redick had a \"tremendous desire\" to play for Team USA before ultimately deciding it wouldn't work out.\n\nPer CBS Sports' Michael Kaskey-Blomain and Jack Maloney, 10 players have withdrawn from consideration for the FIBA World Cup, including James Harden, Anthony Davis, Bradley Beal, Tobias Harris, CJ McCollum, Kevin Love and Damian Lillard.\n\nIn a press release issued Thursday (via the Associated Press), USA Basketball added Jaylen Brown, Marcus Smart, Montrezl Harrell, Mason Plumlee, Julius Randle and Thaddeus Young to supplement the roster in the wake of so many withdrawals.\n\nThe 2019 FIBA World Cup will be held from Aug. 31-Sep. 15 in China. The United States has won each of the last two tournaments in 2010 and 2014."
