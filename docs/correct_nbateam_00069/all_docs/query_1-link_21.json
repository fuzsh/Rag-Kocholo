I just wanted to come in and make a name for myself.”\n\nAfter 4 seasons with the Magic, Shaq decided to up and leave for bigger and brighter lights in Los Angeles.\n\nSince his departure, Orlando has developed some highly talented players.\n\nHere are 3 of the greatest Orlando Magic players since Shaq:\n\nHonorable Mentions\n\nPenny Hardaway\n\nPenny Hardaway is definitely one of the greatest Magic players.\n\nBut I’m putting him in the honourable mentions because he played multiple seasons with Shaq before taking over the team.\n\nSo, because of that, he’s disqualified from my list."
