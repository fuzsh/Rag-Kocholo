        "text": "ORLANDO - General manager Otis Smith insists the Orlando Magic have done their homework on the international players in today's NBA draft.\n\nSo if, for example, Italy's Andrea Bargnani happens to slip from his consensus projection in the top 6 to Orlando's No. 11 pick, they'd take him - even though the same circumstance last year turned embarrassing after Spaniard Fran Vazquez declined to join the team.\n\n\"I will tell you this, if Bargnani slides down to 11, we will come in here and we will say 'The Orlando Magic select Andrea Bargnani,' and we will say it with confidence because he's a player that could help us right away,\" Smith said.\n\nTruth is, Bargnani almost certainly won't be there, but Smith thinks a small handful of players that could also help right away will.\n\nThe Magic, who saved a dismal finish last season with a late 16-6 run that nearly landed them in the playoffs, are looking to pick up another post player and shooting guard - though not necessarily in that order. Besides the first-round pick, Orlando also gets to choose in the second round at No. 41 and No. 44.\n\nThe club is building around a young nucleus that includes forward Dwight Howard and point guard Jameer Nelson, and expects to re-sign DeShawn Stevenson even though the guard this month opted out of the final year of his contract and became an unrestricted free agent. Smith said All-Star forward Grant Hill would also be back, and offseason rehabilitation from a sports hernia has made him \"the strongest I've seen him since I've been here.\"\n\nAs usual, mock drafts have lottery picks sprinkled differently across the board, but Orlando figures in several to select Duke's J.J. Redick, The Associated Press Player of the Year and all-time leading ACC scorer. Redick's stock could be hurt by an arrest earlier this month on drunk driving charges in North Carolina, but Smith spoke highly of him.\n\n\"We talked about a little bit of everything with J.J.,\" Smith said. \"He's a pleasant kid to be around and we had a very good conversation with him. I think he'll be an asset to any team that he goes to.\"\n\nOther top shooting guards include Randy Foye, who averaged 20 points and five rebounds a game for Villanova but might not last until the 11th pick. Ditto for 6-foot-6 Washington guard Brandon Roy and Connecticut's early entrant Marcus Williams. But also in the mix are players like Rodney Carney, a 6-foot-7 guard-forward who averaged 17 points at Memphis and can hit long-range, and Ronnie Brewer, an early entrant from Arkansas who also stands 6-foot-7 - guys who certainly could be around for late lottery teams.\n\nThe draft is also abundant with front-line talent, and the Magic could end up with a first-round pick like Sheldon Williams, a rebounding and shot-blocking machine who also put up 19 points a game at Duke last year. Also potentially available are Patrick O'Bryant, a 7-footer from Bradley, and Cedric Simmons, a 6-foot-9 power forward who left North Carolina State early.\n\nSmith has his eye on two or three players the Magic expect to be available at 11, and said Orlando is happy without moving up or down.\n\n\"There's a couple of players I like there, and if that player is not there, that player happened to be a 'big,' then we'll take that one,\" Smith said."
