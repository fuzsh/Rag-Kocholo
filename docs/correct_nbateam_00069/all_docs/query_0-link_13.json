        "text": "PHILADELPHIA — J.J. Redick never wanted the Orlando Magic to trade him. Redick preferred to finish the 2012-13 season with the Magic, become an unrestricted free agent that July and then weigh his options. He would have considered signing a long-term deal to remain in Orlando.\n\nAll of that is well-known.\n\nOn Saturday night, however, Redick revealed something else.\n\nHe thinks the Magic made a smart move when they traded him and two other players on Feb. 21, 2013, to the Milwaukee Bucks for 20-year-old forward Tobias Harris and two other players.\n\n“The trade for Tobias was definitely in Orlando’s favor,” Redick said in a quiet corner of the Philadelphia 76ers’ locker room. “You get a guy who’s going to get you 18 (points) and 8 (rebounds) at 22, or whatever age Tobias was at the time. It was absolutely a great trade. Things obviously didn’t turn out great for them subsequently, but I think they made the right call.”\n\nForgive Magic fans if they disagree.\n\nRedick was beloved in Orlando, and although many fans at first grudgingly agreed with the wisdom of trading for Harris, those same fans still wished it didn’t come at the expense of losing Redick. The anger over losing Redick has only increased in recent years because the team traded Harris in 2016 for no one of consequence. Meanwhile, Redick has blossomed in recent years with the Los Angeles Clippers and 76ers.\n\nWhat occurred Saturday night inside Wells Fargo Center must also have infuriated Magic diehards. Redick torched his former team by scoring 31 points, most of them on long-range heaves, and led the Sixers to a 116-115 pulse-pounding victory that demoralized Orlando’s players. The night before, the Magic were crushed at home by the Charlotte Hornets; a victory on Saturday in Philadelphia, on the second night of a back-to-back, would have felt redemptive to Orlando players.\n\nRedick delivered a decisive blow with 17.0 seconds remaining in the fourth quarter. Running along the 3-point arc toward the Magic’s bench, Redick received a handoff from Joel Embiid and drained another trey. His basket — a pure swish — put Philly ahead 116-114 and prompted Redick to walk toward Philly’s bench, his arms raised high above his head, as Sixers fans serenaded him with wild cheers.\n\n“He’s a hell of a player,” Magic center Nikola Vucevic said after the game. “I have a lot of respect for him.”\n\nVucevic is the only player remaining on Orlando’s roster who played with Redick. All of their teammates during the 2012-13 season — including Arron Afflalo, Jameer Nelson and Hedo Turkoglu — are playing somewhere else or are out of the NBA.\n\nThe 2012-13 season was a transition year for the Magic, the team’s first full season after it traded Dwight Howard in a massive four-team blockbuster that brought Vucevic, Afflalo and others to Orlando. The Magic were starting a rebuilding effort, but no one knew exactly how complete the rebuild would become.\n\nAt the time, it seemed plausible that the Magic could retain Redick, sign him to a long-term contract in 2013 and keep him around to mentor the lottery picks who were certain to follow. Redick often discussed that possibility with people who were close to him, including his wife, Chelsea, and one of the Magic’s assistant coaches, Brett Gunning.\n\n“We envisioned a longer rebuild,” Redick said. “It wasn’t like we expected it to turn over overnight. It was like be there, see it through, get back to the playoffs in Year 9 (of my career or) Year 10. And Chelsea and I talked about playing my whole career there. It wasn’t out of the realm of possibility.”\n\nRedick would have been a perfect role model for eventual draft picks such as Victor Oladipo, Aaron Gordon, Elfrid Payton and Mario Hezonja.\n\nAlthough Redick was selected 11th overall by the Magic out of Duke in 2006, he played sparingly during his first two NBA seasons. But he outworked almost everyone else on the Magic roster, built his body and developed into a valuable pro through sheer will.\n\nDuring the 2012-13 season, Redick was having his best overall year in the NBA, but his individual success also made him attractive to buyers at the trade deadline. The Bucks brought him aboard because the team’s owner, Sen. Herb Kohl, wanted his small-market team to make a playoff push.\n\nAt the time, John Hammond was Milwaukee’s general manager and Jeff Weltman was Milwaukee’s assistant general manager.\n\nThese days, Weltman is the Magic’s president of basketball operations, while Hammond is the Magic’s GM.\n\nRedick said he thinks about the trade from Orlando to Milwaukee whenever he sees Weltman and Hammond. During the preseason, Redick, Weltman and Hammond spoke for about five to 10 minutes before a Magic-Sixers exhibition game in Philadelphia. And on Saturday night, Redick spotted Weltman in the stands.\n\nThe trade from Orlando to Milwaukee inspired Redick again on Saturday.\n\nWhen Sixers coach Brett Brown subbed him in off the bench with 5:13 remaining in the first quarter, Philly was trailing Orlando, 25-10. But Redick propelled the Sixers back into the game; he drained three of the first four 3-pointers he attempted.\n\nAll of the areas Redick improved during his Magic tenure and fine-tuned during a four-year stint with the Clippers — his endurance, his court savvy, his speed — were on display Saturday.\n\n“He was a big factor, for sure,” Magic swingman Evan Fournier said. “His shooting gave them confidence. It gets the crowd going.”\n\nRedick is 34 years old now, and he is closer to the end of his career than to its beginning.\n\nYet he continues to thrive, and his first NBA team is still struggling. The Magic still haven’t emerged from the rebuilding project that started when the team traded Howard six years ago. But the faces have changed. General manager Rob Hennigan and assistant GM Scott Perry were fired after the 2016-17 season and were replaced by Weltman and Hammond.\n\nJust the other day, Redick was reminiscing with former Magic video analyst and current San Antonio Spurs director of basketball intelligence Adam Glessner. Among the topics discussed were the early years of Hennigan’s tenure in Orlando. The first three major trades by Hennigan — the deal involving Howard, the deal that sent Redick to Milwaukee and the deal that brought Fournier from Denver to Orlando for Afflalo — all seemed sound. In fact, on Saturday, Redick labeled them “home runs” in the Magic’s favor.\n\n“Those were all great trades,” Redick added.\n\nYet the rebuild went astray. One of the reasons for its failure: Hennigan lost faith in Harris and in Oladipo and traded each of them for flawed players.\n\nIn hindsight, those moves now make Hennigan’s decision to trade Redick in 2013 even more painful for Magic fans to accept.\n\nAsked if he felt any extra joy to play so well against the Magic, he responded, “Oh, yeah, always. Always. You know that.”\n\nRedick let out a chuckle because, to him, the answer to the question seemed obvious. It is human nature to want to prove yourself to a former employer that cut you loose.\n\nForgive Magic fans, though, if they didn’t share Redick’s joy.\n\nTo them, his absence in Orlando still feels like a kick in the stomach."
