        "text": "The Lakers hiring JJ Redick as coach could show that the team is hoping to “build off the last two seasons when they made the playoffs” in “what’s expected to be the final couple of seasons of the LeBron James-Anthony Davis era; and have a coach in place who can have a development-focused approach, especially in the post-James era,” according to Khobi Price of the L.A. DAILY NEWS. The Lakers’ hiring of Redick came after the organization’s “failed pursuit” of UConn's Dan Hurley, who “turned down” the Lakers’ six-year, $70M offer and returned to the Huskies. Redick was “considered the frontrunner” for the Lakers’ job before their pursuit of Hurley became public. Price noted Redick met with Lakers VP & GM Rob Pelinka last month at the draft combine in Chicago “before the more formal and thorough interview” with Pelinka and Lakers owner Jeanie Buss last weekend, with Pelinka “officially offering Redick the job” Thursday morning. The “hope” is that Redick’s “ability to connect with players, forward-thinking mindset, high basketball IQ, passion and work ethic will help make up for his lack of experience as a first-time coach” (L.A. DAILY NEWS, 6/20). THE ATHLETIC’s Charania, Amick, & Buha reported the Lakers had been “zeroing in” Redick for weeks, \"infatuated with his potential to be a coach for the present and future, beyond just the next couple seasons of LeBron James’ legendary career.” The Lakers feel Redick will be the “long-term coaching solution that has eluded the franchise for over a decade” (THE ATHLETIC, 6/20).\n\nREADY FOR THE SPOTLIGHT? In L.A., Bill Plaschke wrote the Lakers, who are “in most need of strong leadership,” just hired a coach who has “never been a head coach, assistant coach, or any kind of coach” at the NBA level. A team “desperate for a culture creator just hired a head coach who has never led a group of athletes at any level above youth basketball.” The Lakers are a team that “needs a powerful voice to drown out the overwhelming and often misguided influence of LeBron James” and “just hired LeBron James’ podcast partner.” Plaschke: “Redick’s incoming claim to credibility is, well, he’s LeBron’s buddy. Anything else? Anybody?” (L.A. TIMES, 6/20). ESPN’s David Dennis Jr. said, “This has been a circus of an offseason for this Lakers team. Hiring somebody that is your franchise player’s podcast buddy essentially without doing the due diligence … seems like this could be a recipe for another coaching disaster” (“Around the Horn,” ESPN, 6/20).\n\nTOO CLOSE FOR COMFORT? USA TODAY’s Jeff Zillgitt noted the relationship between Redick and James “will be watched closely.” Based on their podcast, it is “clear they get along, share many of the same basketball philosophies and see the game in similar ways.” Zillgitt: “But what happens when they disagree and one is upset with the other?” Their relationship will be “scrutinized” (USA TODAY, 6/20). ESPN’s Tony Kornheiser called Redick a “very good hire” and said, “He knows LeBron well, he works with LeBron, he’s pals with LeBron.” Kornheiser: “Here’s the key sentence: He’s not a threat to LeBron” (“PTI,” ESPN, 6/20). NBA Radio’s Frank Isola said, “Just hire whoever LeBron wants at this point. He’s probably only going to play for two more years. If you hire who he wants, this way there’s no cryptic tweets, no passive aggressive comments after games. This is the guy that he wants.” He added, “I’m not saying just turn your organization over to your star player. But I do on some level trust LeBron.” Isola: “There’s no more mixed messages. There’s no gray area. This is LeBron’s guy coaching the team. Let’s go play basketball” (“The Starting Lineup,” NBA Radio, 6/21). But in California, Jim Alexander asked, “When Redick addresses his new team, do you think some players might find themselves wondering if LeBron’s lips were moving while Redick was talking? In other words, whose message is really being delivered? That’s a delicate issue to straddle, especially for a first-time coach” (Riverside PRESS-ENTERPRISE, 6/20).\n\nSTARTING BEHIND THE EIGHT BALL: In Phoenix, Duane Rankin wrote Redick “landed one of the highest-profile jobs in all of sports without any professional head coaching experience.” Having a podcast with James “makes this hire look even more orchestrated.” Redick has been “critical of NBA coaches, starting with Doc Rivers, who never coached in the league.” There is a coaching fraternity, but Redick “may not be as welcomed by some because of the path he’s taken.” He has a “vast knowledge” of the game, but Redick “expresses it in a way that rubs some people the wrong way.” Some media members will “feast on him if he fails.” Rankin: “Redick can’t control all the narratives, but winning will sure answer whatever criticisms come his way” (ARIZONA REPUBLIC, 6/20). Meanwhile, ESPN’s Michael Wilbon said Redick is walking into the “most unreal expectations in the NBA.” Wilbon: “There are more unrealistic expectations surrounding the Lakers than any team, I think, in North America. … I can’t think of another franchise where they think they’re going to win every year no matter how their team is.” He added, “They’re the most arrogant fan base, the most unrealistic fan base” (“PTI,” ESPN, 6/20)."
