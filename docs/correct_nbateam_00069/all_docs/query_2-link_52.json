        "text": "For the fifth time in his career, Los Angeles Lakers superstar Anthony Davis was named as part of the NBA’s 2023-24 All-Defensive team. This honor was a nod to Davis’ elite contributions on the defensive end, and it firmly establishes his status as one of the top defenders in the NBA today.\n\nNew Lakers head coach JJ Redick agrees with this notion. The 40-year-old, however, did not believe that this was enough for Davis to get his vote on the All-NBA team.\n\nLos Angeles Lakers News: JJ Redick on Leaving Anthony Davis Off All-Defensive Team\n\nAs a renowned broadcaster, Redick was asked to take part in the vote for the individual and team awards this past season. Interestingly enough, the former podcast host decided not to vote for Davis as part of his All-Defense squad — an anomaly that the Lakers shot-caller addressed in a recent interview:\n\n“There’s a big difference in being a top ten defender and making an all-defense team,” Redick explained (h/t Legion Hoops on X, formerly Twitter). “Anthony Davis is one of the two or three best defensive players in the NBA… You certainly have to factor in the stats and of course the team performance on defense.”\n\nRedick clearly believes that Davis is one of the best defenders in the NBA today. However, in his mind, this doesn’t mean that he should be part of the All-Defense squad.\n\nRedick seems to have implied that the Lakers’ poor record last season was a factor in his decision to snub Davis for the All-Defense team. Now that he’s the one sitting at the helm, it will be Redick’s responsibility to make sure that the Lakers — and Davis, of course — do much better this term.\n\nFor More NBA Content:"
