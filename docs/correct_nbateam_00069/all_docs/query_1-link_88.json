A MRI on Wednesday showed floating particles in the knee and it was determined that surgery was the best option for Williams.\n\nThe hope is that Williams can have the surgery now and return by the regular-season opener against the Washington Wizards on Oct. 28.\n\n``It‚Äôs unfortunate, but the timing is such that he can be back for the first game,‚Äô‚Äô Magic coach Stan Van Gundy said. ``In a training camp setting you‚Äôd like to have three point guards. But it‚Äôs nothing major. He‚Äôs got stuff floating around (in the knee). He didn‚Äôt want to get (the surgery) done, but this gives him the best chance to get back by the start of the regular season.‚Äô‚Äô\n\nVan Gundy said the Magic briefly discussed adding a third point guard for training camp, but nixed the idea. Jameer Nelson is the entrenched starter, while Chris Duhon was signed in free agency over the summer to serve as the primary reserve.\n\nShooting guards Vince Carter and J.J. Redick served as the backup third point guards in Wednesday‚Äôs night practice. Van Gundy said the injury underscores how important Orlando‚Äôs acquisition of Duhon was in the offseason.\n\nWilliams, who is entering his 12th NBA season, returned to the Magic this summer as the team‚Äôs third point guard. He appeared in all 82 games last season and started 18 when Nelson was out following knee surgery. He averaged 6.0 points and 3.6 assists a game and registered career highs in shooting percentage (44.4 percent) and 3-point shooting (38 percent).\n\nVaBeachNiner\n\nVeteran\n\nPosts: 56,683\n\nLewis at the SF position? About freaking time.\n\njrg\n\nVeteran\n\nPosts: 166,549\n\nMagic are not playing nice anymore with Vince\n\nThe Magic, from management to coaches to players, have in no uncertain terms told Vince Carter they need him to produce this season.\n\nLast season, in Vince‚Äôs first year with the team, it seemed like everybody walked on eggshells around the eight-time all-star, paying him respect and treating him with reverance. Which they should have, to a point.\n\nThe tenor has changed after a disappointing season for VC.\n\nMagic GM Otis Smith says that Carter ‚Äúalways says the right things‚Äù but he wants to see Vince walk the walk.\n\n‚ÄúHe wasn‚Äôt Vintage Vince,‚Äù Smith said, and he was spot on.\n\nStan Van Gundy publicly let it be known how much the team needs him.\n\nAnd in a team meeting Monday, Vince‚Äôs teammates pointedly told him to pick it up and play like an all-star.\n\nSmith went out and signed Quentin Richardson and let go of Matt Barnes I think because Q-Rich can give the Magic more scoring if Carter, nearing 34, is on fumes.\n\nThe team won‚Äôt hesitate to play J.J. Redick as they did during the Boston series when Carter struggled.\n\n_______________________________\n\nIt's go time VC\n\njrg\n\nVeteran\n\nPosts: 166,549\n\njrg\n\nVeteran\n\nPosts: 166,549\n\nMagic Exercise Fourth-Year Option On Anderson\n\nThe Orlando Magic have exercised their fourth-year team option on forward Ryan Anderson, President of Basketball Operations/General Manager Otis Smith announced today. Per team policy, terms of the deal are not disclosed. Anderson is now under contract through the 2011-12 season.\n\nAnderson played in 63 games last season for the Magic, averaging 7.7 ppg. and 3.2 rpg. in 14.5 minpg., while shooting .370 (78-211) from three-point range.\n\nRead more: http://basketball.realgm.com/src_wiretap_archives/69382/20101001/magic_exercise_fourth_year_option_on_anderson/#ixzz11AXnlpNp\n\njrg\n\nVeteran\n\nPosts: 166,549\n\nMagic experimenting with lineup changes in camp\n\nORLANDO, Fla. (AP)‚ÄîThe typical makeup of a power forward for most NBA teams is a big and bulky body, a player with the frame to bang around the basket and perhaps toss in a mid-range jumper.\n\nThen there‚Äôs Rashard Lewis(notes) and the Orlando Magic.\n\nA natural small forward, Lewis has spent the past three seasons in Orlando mostly starting at power forward. The switch allowed him to stretch the floor as one of the league‚Äôs best 3-point shooters and, at a lanky 6-foot-10, offer enough size to guard opponents in the post‚Äîan ability that made the Magic a tough matchup.\n\nNow all that might soon change.\n\nFor a team with an almost identical roster as a year ago, Orlando is working hard on some different looks. The biggest being with Lewis, who Magic coach Stan Van Gundy plans to experiment with at small forward.\n\n‚ÄúI think it gives us more size on the floor if we do that,‚Äù Van Gundy said after the Magic‚Äôs first training camp practice Tuesday. ‚ÄúHe can get into his post-up game more. We don‚Äôt lose any shooting on the floor. The concern with him playing the three is never at the offensive end.‚Äù\n\nIt‚Äôs defense that would be tricky.\n\nIn a matter of months, Lewis would go from bumping with big men such as Boston‚Äôs Kevin Garnett(notes) or Los Angeles Lakers star Pau Gasol(notes) to chasing Miami‚Äôs LeBron James(notes) or Mike Miller(notes) around the perimeter.\n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs most definitely a big change,‚Äù Lewis said.\n\nBut he‚Äôs perfectly fine with the swap‚Äîin fact, he would rather play small forward.\n\nLewis always has felt more comfortable at small forward, a position he played nine seasons in Seattle. Van Gundy even told him during their exit meeting last season, Lewis said, that the coach planned to take a shot at the switch.\n\nLewis has trimmed some weight‚Äîabout 10 pounds, although he wouldn‚Äôt divulge the exact figures‚Äîthis offseason and worked on his quickness, agility and footwork preparing for the transition.\n\n‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to say I can do it. It‚Äôs going to be a work in progress. It‚Äôs going to take some time. Nothing happens overnight. And that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs good to be in camp, good to be in drills and try this stuff now,‚Äù he said.\n\nAny shift with Lewis would essentially remold Orlando‚Äôs offensive philosophy.\n\nLewis at power forward is what made the Magic such a defensive nightmare, surrounding All-Star center Dwight Howard(notes) with four potent 3-point shooters. But even with such success, it also was a reason they fell short.\n\nThe Lakers bullied and bruised the Magic‚Äôs front line in the NBA finals in 2009, and Boston did the same in the Eastern Conference finals last season. The Celtics went as far as face-guarding Lewis with Garnett and forcing Orlando to play without him.\n\n‚ÄúIt was frustrating more than anything. He pretty much shadowed me everywhere I went on the court,‚Äù Lewis said. ‚ÄúThey did a great job. They‚Äôre a great defensive team, and they took me out of that series.‚Äù\n\nSo for now, the Magic are mixing it up.\n\nWith Lewis at his natural position, Orlando would likely put Brandon Bass(notes) at power forward‚Äîas it did during the portion of Tuesday‚Äôs scrimmage open to reporters‚Äîto give Howard another big body inside. Van Gundy also is exploring other lineups he has only used on occasion, such as playing backup center Marcin Gortat(notes) alongside Howard or Vince Carter(notes) with fellow shooting guard J.J. Redick(notes).\n\n‚ÄúWhy not?‚Äù Carter said. ‚ÄúThis is the time to really figure it out. Once it gets to the real deal, you kind of have an idea of the direction you want to go against particular teams. So we mine as well be prepared for it and be ready when it gets here.‚Äù\n\nAt the very least, the idea is to add another element besides Orlando‚Äôs shoot-every-outside-shot strategy.\n\nThe Magic believe Lewis gives them an advantage posting up, a move that works even better against undersized small forwards. The biggest factor in whether they make the move permanent for the regular season, Van Gundy said, will be if Lewis can be effective defensively against quicker players.\n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a different set of expectations,‚Äù Van Gundy said. ‚ÄúBut we‚Äôre going to give him a lot of time there.‚Äù\n\nhttp://sports.yahoo.com/nba/news;_ylt=AlyhQQDcYHxGGZU8GfOt97C8vLYF?slug=ap-magic-mixingitup\n\njrg\n\nVeteran\n\nPosts: 166,549\n\njrg\n\nVeteran\n\nPosts: 166,549\n\nOrlando Magic 2010 40 min PER\n\nESPN.com has published John Hollinger's player projections for the 2010-2011 season.
