        "text": "J.J. Redick, the former Duke star who made a living as a capable NBA shooting guard over 15 seasons, has agreed to a deal to become the new head coach for the Los Angeles Lakers, a person with knowledge of the hire told USA TODAY Sports on Thursday.\n\nThe person requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly until the Lakers made an official announcement.\n\nRedick, 39, has no coaching experience, joining a short list of former players who have moved into the coaching ranks without any prior experience. Jason Kidd moved from player to coach quickly, retiring as a player in June 2013 and taking the Nets job less than two weeks later. Steve Nash retired in 2014 and became the Nets' head coach in 2020, lasting just two-plus seasons.\n\nRedick’s basketball acumen is well known, from his days as a player and then as an analyst for ESPN/ABC and on the Xs and Os-centric \"Mind the Game\" podcast with LeBron James.\n\nBut his absence of coaching experience – for the Lakers’ franchise in particular – is a major part of the story.\n\nHe takes over a team that finished 47-35 this season and lost to the Denver Nuggets in the first round of the Western Conference playoffs. With James and Anthony Davis, the Lakers maintain championship aspirations.\n\nHow he fares will be watched with scrutiny. He brings knowledge and understanding of the modern game and player, and he has played for strong minds: Stan Van Gundy with Orlando, where he was drafted 11th in 2006; Doc Rivers with the Los Angeles Clippers; Brett Brown with Philadelphia.\n\nOpinion: J.J. Redick equipped for Lakers job, high shine of L.A. But that doesn't guarantee success\n\nRedick replaces Darvin Ham, who the Lakers fired May 3 after two seasons, and becomes the 29th coach in franchise history.\n\nRedick averaged 12.8 points and shot 41.5% on 3-pointers in 15 seasons and averaged a career-high 18.1 points for Philadelphia in 2018-19. In 2015-16, he led the league in 3-point shooting percentage (47.5%)."
