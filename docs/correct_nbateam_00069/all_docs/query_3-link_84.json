        "text": "Lakers F LeBron James and ESPN's JJ Redick have teamed up for a podcast \"planned to be a pure conversation about basketball,\" according to Andrew Marchand of THE ATHLETIC. The show, “Mind the Game,” begins with \"no corporate partners\" as James and Redick \"want it to be as organic as possible.\" It has \"no set advertising sponsor yet.\" The duo is producing the new venture with their two companies, James’ Uninterrupted and Redick’s ThreeFourTwo Productions. The podcast, which debuted its first show yesterday, is \"expected to be weekly, running 45 minutes to an hour per episode\" and will be \"available on YouTube and all podcast platforms.\" Redick said that there will \"be other guests on some of the shows.\" Marchand noted the concept of the program is \"meant to be a departure from talk shows like ESPN’s 'First Take.'\" Those shows \"regularly debate subjective opinions about sports,\" while James and Redick plan to \"delve deeper into the actual game of basketball.\" The duo teaming together is \"another example of athletes and ex-athletes having a forum to talk about what they want, when and where they want it.\" James' business partner Maverick Carter said, “We don’t have to wait or partner with anybody if we have an amazing idea. Those guys were just ready to go. They were ready to get in the room, and we didn’t want to overthink it, over-produce it\" (THE ATHLETIC, 3/18). The HOLLYWOOD REPORTER's Alex Weprin cited a source as saying that James and Redick initially hit it off during the NBA in-season tournament, and \"shared a wish that there be a podcast for fans focused on what was happening on the court, without third-parties shaping the editorial direction in any way\" (HOLLYWOOD REPORTER, 3/18)."
