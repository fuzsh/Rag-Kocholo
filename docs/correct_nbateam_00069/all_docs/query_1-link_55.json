        "text": "Paris 2024 Olympics: Let the war begin | Paris 2024 Olympic Games Let’s play a game of lies. Ten thousand athletes will swear this Friday to participate in the Olympic Games for the honour of their teams and to make the world a better place. That’s what they will say. A century ago they swore for the honour of their country and for the glory of sport. Country and glory: dangerous words that should be watered down. Verdun, Stalingrad, Pearl Harbor, Saigon. Let’s continue with the lies. This Friday, someone will remember the origin of ancient Olympism: that truce of peace that the Hellenic peoples gave each other every four years to lay down their arms, stop killing each other for a while and send their best athletes from distant lands to the city of Olympia. There, next to the sanctuary dedicated to Zeus, the enemies on the battlefield would then face each other in races, chariot races, the pentathlon, jumping, and discus and javelin throwing. There was love of country, of course: everyone was amazed to see how the Calabrian polis of Crotona was able to export so many champions of the main event, the stadion, a straight 192 metres long, equivalent to 600 Hercules’ feet. From Crotona came the runners Glaukias, Lykinos, Hippostratos, Diognetos, Ischomachos, Tisikrates and Astylos, who won the event twelve times in just one century. There was a fascination with glory, of course: everyone admired Milo of Croton, a super athlete married to the daughter of Pythagoras who managed to win five consecutive Olympic titles in freestyle wrestling. Milo won from the age of 25 until he was 41. At 45 he tried again. He wanted one more victory. Who can refuse another dose when the drug is laurel, veneration? The chances of winning were slim. But sport is not mathematics; it is much better: it allows contradiction, the most logical rule in the realm of dreams, freedom and escape. That is how Pythagoras’s son-in-law, the great Milo of Croton, was defeated by a countryman and never won again in Olympia. So much the better. A great ending. Borges wrote: Defeat has a dignity that noisy victory does not deserve. Let’s play truth games now. Ten thousand athletes will fight in Paris. Even if they don’t say it, the homeland and the glory will be there: atavistic impulses sucked out and channeled by sport. There was a time – it was another world – when something different was attempted. Something less capitalist and bourgeois. Something red and revolutionary. The workers’ Olympiad in Frankfurt in 1925. The international Spartakiads of 1928 and 1931 in Moscow and Berlin. The People’s Olympiad that Barcelona was to experience in the fateful July of 1936. That world didn’t work out. Another one won: Long live evil, long live capital. And the Olympic Games grew fat on the basis of homeland, glory and that sweet amniotic fluid that protects them so well from reason and that, at the same time, sustains their unreason. It’s the epic. The epic as ideology. This is th...\n\n‘The red and white sky’: Memory of Gijón’s ‘Eurosporting’ | Football | Sports The Asturian language has a specific word for the boredom that abundance can cause: refalfie (from the verb to refalfiar). This is the best way to describe what happened on 17 September 1987, when what was probably the best Milan in history – with Gullit, Van Basten, Maldini and Baresi in the squad and Sacchi as coach – travelled to Gijón to face Sporting in the first round of the UEFA Cup. 18,000 people attended. At that time, El Molinón could hold just over 40,000 spectators. It was the fifth time in nine years that the Asturian team had taken part in the European competition. And the Sporting fans arrived at the event with a certain amount of excitement about success. refalfie —Asturian, it is understood—by the book. Although the Eurosporting would achieve a new qualification to play in Europe in 1991, the team that captivated thousands of red-and-white fans was beginning to show slight signs of the end of a glorious era in which it managed to play in two Copa del Rey finals, was runner-up in the League and had in its ranks a top scorer – Quini, on three occasions – and the goalkeeper who had conceded the fewest goals – Ablanedo, on another three. The red and white sky (Hoja de lata), is an elegant, complete, measured chronicle, peppered with humor, irony and pertinent cultural references and very well written by the Asturian journalist Rafa Quirós. A sky that began to be stormed the day it was decided to invest the money from Churruca’s transfer to Athletic in building the Mareo Football School – there, in the 76-77 season, Quirós begins a story that covers up to 1992 – and that was consolidated on board a bus driven by José Antonio Vázquez Quintana, who was as much a part of the team as Joaquín – 644 official matches with the same shirt -, Ferrero, Maceda or Jiménez. With a saint’s calendar that was renewed with Luis Enrique, Eloy, Abelardo, Manjarín or Juanele. With a president – Vega-Arango – who seemed to come out of a movie. The story of an era so brilliant and so unique that to refalfiar It was, in addition to an Asturian concept, a mere question of time.

In Europe, this exclusive distinction is enjoyed by everything from the Mediterranean diet, the falconryhe blown glass wave Shrimp fishing on horseback in Oostduinkerke (Belgium) until the Cypriot poetic improvisation or the mystery of Elche (Alicante). The latest manifestation to join this list is Berlin techno. The announcement makes dance music an official cultural phenomenon. The torrent of headlines and reactions has not been long in coming, but in Berlin it seems to be experienced in a different way. “Here everything remains the same,” says Carolina Velasco, a Spanish cultural journalist who lives in the German capital. Velasco, who is very in touch with the daily life of the capital in terms of art, explains how the designation has coincided with other milestones: the legalisation of marijuana, a movement to prevent the eviction of Tuntenhaus, a squatted house on Kastanienallee (the coolest and most gentrified avenue in the city) considered one of the last bastions of alternative queer culture in the city, the raves that spring up every weekend or the demonstrations in support of Palestine. “Within all this,” says the journalist, “techno is a little thing that is not going to change our lives either.” Carolina Velasco also provides several keys: this candidacy for intangible cultural heritage of humanity was promoted by a local association called Rave The Planetwhich organised the massive Berlin Love Parade between 1989 and 2003 and which, since 2022, has been responsible for the Rave The Planet Parade, an electronic music parade-party that crosses the city and attracts 300,000 people. “Last year they almost cancelled it because it didn’t have enough medical points. Now it’s easier for them to get help, for example.” All this, he recalls, in a city where there have been no restrictive changes to nightlife: there are clubs that open 48 hours a day, and you can drink in the street. The Club Commission, which looks after the interests of Berlin’s electronic clubs and receives public funding, was also quick to consider the UNESCO award as “an important recognition”, says the Spaniard. The Club Commission was also the first to mention Detroit (USA), the birthplace of techno. “The general criticism is that recognition has been given to Berlin when nothing has been invented here; it was the DJs from Detroit who brought the sound to a city with facilities for organising parties.” Unlike other UNESCO-recognised locations, life in Berlin does not seem to be changing much because of this award: “I think it is impossible for the B...\n\nThe criticism that Oriana Sabatini received for her wedding dress Oriana Sabatini hasn’t even been married for a week and the criticism has already started to rain down on her. This time, she was attacked for the dress she wore at her wedding. The person in charge of telling this was Fabiana Araujowho spoke with some Argentine designers. First of all, the El Nueve communicator stressed that she would not give any names: “I have some opinions from Argentine designers, who we are not going to name obviously, and they told me that the dress was very well made, that it had a very clean line…”. Apparently, the anger of the Argentine designers is that Dolce and Gabbana did not do anything different from what they would have done: “But they said that to make a Dolce and Gabbana, there was a lot of expectation and that this dress could have been made by any of the Argentine designers.”. In addition, she was questioned for looking for a designer outside of Argentina: “They told me it was a shame that someone who is Argentine married an Argentine and that she got married in Argentina, it was a shame that she didn’t choose an Argentine designer. Of course, everyone is free to choose.”. CRITICISM OF THE DRESS THAT ORIANA SABATINI WORN AT HER WEDDING Moving on to the dress design, there was a lot of questioning about the bouquet of flowers that she was supposed to carry during the photos with her husband. However, at no time did Oriana wear it. On the other hand, there was also questioning about the gloves in the look. “Another thing they told me was that if the outfit has a bouquet so she can pose for photos, she has to pose with the bouquet. Otherwise, she wouldn’t even have to wear it for the photo. They also said that she was uncomfortable with the gloves, that she couldn’t take them off and all that.”held Fabiana Araujo.

Not a single mention of racism, sexism, the drama of Palestine, the civil war in Yemen, evictions, the housing crisis, nothing at all; just music of questionable taste, Spanish Gibraltar, testosterone and alcohol. So for some, the team has gone in just a few days from defeating racism – although this does not appear in the referee’s reports of the matches – to lacking any civic or moral value. But of course, neither did the national team defeat racism (as if that were even possible), nor did Lamine Yamal and Nico Williams dress up as Martin Luther King for three weeks, nor have they suddenly entered into unknown amoral territory. The national team won a European Championship and made a lot of people happy for a few days. Those who hated football before will continue to hate it with joy and renewed motives. And those who enjoyed it before will continue to be there, we will continue to be there Sunday after Sunday, consuming its virtues and defects. But let’s see, what exactly do we expect from a football player? Do we expect him to change the world like a Gucci-clad superhero? What Marvel personalities do we expect him to embody? And what do we expect from a national team? Do we expect it to make society’s ills disappear? I suppose that the extensive exchange of time and money that we maintain with football gives us fans the right to feel that we can demand, expect and demand everything from it. Football, we think (or at least I think so) owes us. Footballers owe us, obviously. And of course (almost) all of us would like our players to take advantage of their enormous loudspeaker to speak about social causes or mobilize consciences. Some do, some even mobilize votes, most don’t. Most just play. That’s how it has always been and that’s how it will continue to be unless the operating system of football is reconfigured from scratch. For football to have that beatific quality of changing the world, we would first need football to change. And if the first is impossible, imagine the second. Football is still a space where players have been exposed to sanctions for certain actions, where federations have more power than the UN, where Count Dracula could set up a league and it would look good if players joined it for millionaire sums, where supposed neutrality in political and religious matters has become neutrality in matters relating to human rights – Oh, the World Cup in Qatar! – Although inaction is in itself a deeply political option, but that is another matter. And footballers continue to live in bubbles with certainties that normally do not correspond to ours. I think that is why so many ex-footballers and footballers fall for financial scams and conspiracy theories (that the moon did not la...\n\nWhat is the meme that all the guests at Oriana Sabatini and Dybala’s wedding got tattooed? Last Saturday, April 20, Oriana Sabatini and Paulo Dybala celebrated their wedding. The event was attended by more than 300 people, including family, friends and coworkers, who surprised the couple by getting a tattoo in their honor. The celebration had everything, at least according to those who attended. It is worth remembering that the footballer and the singer forced the guests not to bring their phones with them. The idea of this was to prevent any kind of information from being leaked to the media. For this reason, days after the big wedding, people who were at Exaltación de la Cruz began to upload the first photos of what the party was like. Some shared the outfit they had on the night, while others showed themselves enjoying themselves. However, what caught everyone’s attention the most was the temporary tattoo they got. There were several options to leave a small mark on the skin, obviously always with the theme of the wedding. But there was one that made everyone laugh. THE TEMPORARY TATTOO THAT THE GUESTS AT ORIANA SABATINI AND PAULO DYBALA’S WEDDING GOT On July 11, Oriana asked her Twitter followers a question. “Very important question, does anyone have my meme of ‘you’re sensitive’ crying? It’s for a TP thanks”wrote at that time the protagonist Allies and Because I love you like this. It was precisely that meme that the guests at their wedding could get tattooed. A fan account of the couple uploaded the photos that some guests shared, where you can see the meme of Sabatini crying tattooed on his skin.

The guests who were in the “Mesaza” were the journalists Paulo Kablan who specializes in police, the sports journalist Gaston Edulthe actress Daniela Cardone and the actor Diego Perez. On Mirtha’s show, Daniela recalled a difficult time in her life. It all began when the host asked the actress about her private life and it was there that she recalled the moment that involved her daughter. Years ago, Cardone spoke about the relationship with the father of Brenda Gandini that “He was depressed. And his depressions were fatal. He was very medicated, very. And I never knew! Never. I remember that my mother got angry with me ‘Didn’t you realize? How was it that no one in his family was able to tell you?’, she reproached me. So I began to solve life as I could.“. Now at Mirtha Legrand’s table, the host, faithful to her style, asked her directly about the situation that had happened and there Daniela Cardone did not avoid anything and told everything about the complicated and difficult moment when her daughter’s father took away her custody. THE COMPLICATED MOMENT THAT DANIELA CARDONE REMEMBERED AT MIRTHA LEGRAND’S TABLE On the July 20 program, Mirtha Legrand, true to her style, asked the actress: “You had a complicated life… Right, Daniela? Because of your daughter. Your husband had taken your daughter away from you.” the host asked him and it was there that Cardone responded directly: “Yes, difficult… But always there warrior“, held. She then gave details of what happened to her daughter’s father: “I had lost custody, which does not happen to any mother.“, she said after Mirtha’s question on the “Mesaza”. He also added that “Mom told me ‘enough with lawyers, because nobody understands. ANDWhen she grows up she will decide and she will come alone‘. ANDOr I always traveled, do you remember, in the summers in Punta del Este?“. For her part, Mirtha took her off topic a bit and recalled her time on a reality show: “In Spain you had huge success, you were in a reality show“. The truth is that over the years, the problem between Brenda Gandini and Daniela Cardone was fixed and they finally managed to smooth things over. Today, that complex moment is behind them and they both enjoy life. Daniela is also the mother of Juniorwho decided to dedicate himself to the world of acting.

The member of Morfi’s Rock She quickly denied it, assuring that she moved with her daughter to Puerto Madero for “safety”, given that Burlando is coming and going to Corrientes for the case. Loanthe one who now broke the silence was the lawyer. In the midst of tireless work, they finally decided to appear together again. The question of how their relationship is was not long in coming and Fernando, half joking and half serious, gave his answer. “I don’t know… she got into it. She jumped into the pool. Who did she talk to? You? I don’t know… I wasn’t here. But we’re fine, enjoying Sara a lot. I can’t do anything but wait for the moment when she comes back so I can hug her.“the”, began Burlando saying in Partners of the show.
