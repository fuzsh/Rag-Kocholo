        "text": "He has become one of the faces of the NBA in his post-playing career. JJ Redick had a long and successful run as a player, but now he is everywhere you look as a pundit, podcaster and broadcaster for a variety of basketball related shows. Now it seems that he could be taking on his next challenge as a head coach of one of the most demanding franchises in the league.\n\nRedick busy with NBA Finals\n\nRedick has never been a coach outside of his time as coach of various youth teams, but has jumped to the top of the Lakers short list. It’s the most illustrious job in the game, and those in the front offices of Crypto.com Arena seem keen on the would be rookie head coach.\n\nWhile there is plenty of discussion and speculation surrounding Redick and the Lakers, the former Dukie is still on the clock at ESPN. He is going to be calling the NBA Finals between the Dallas Mavericks and Boston Celtics, so it appears that if a deal is struck, it won’t be until after the series.\n\nRedick retired in 2021 after a 15 year career in the league. Out of the University of Duke, he was known as a sharp shooter with an exceptional knowledge of the game. He has put that knowledge to use in the years following his retirement, quickly rising to the top of ESPN while running his own podcast “The Old Man and Three.”\n\nJJ-LeBron connection\n\nThat knowledge, swagger and personality has attracted not just the Lakers, but other teams in years previous. He interviewed for the head coaching job in Toronto and Charlotte before each team eventually went in different directions. Boston Celtics head coach Joe Mazzulla has even said he tried to sign him as an assistant coach last year.\n\nWhile Redick played for the other team in LA, he does have a tie to the Lakers. He had LeBron James on for a special “Mind the Game” podcast were the two discussed the game at depth in a few episode one on one conversation."
