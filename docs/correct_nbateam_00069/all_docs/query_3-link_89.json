        "text": "JJ Reddick leading The Pack In Lakers Head Coaching Search\n\nGiven their closeness, many have speculated that the Lakers may hire Redick to placate James. Rich Paul, the CEO of Klutch Sports, who represents James, stated on Monday that this is untrue. “LeBron James and JJ Redick, they do a podcast together,” Paul told The Athletic. “That does not mean that (James) wants Redick as his head coach.” JJ Redick is certainly an interesting and inspired coach. He clearly knows basketball, and the Lakers may opt to bet on his potential and his current rapport with LeBron as the best choice for the job. Overall, JJ to the Lakers is now in the realm of possibility."
