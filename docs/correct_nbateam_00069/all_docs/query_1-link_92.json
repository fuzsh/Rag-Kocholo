        "text": "Two years ago, Celtics coach Joe Mazzulla attempted to hire JJ Redick as an assistant coach in Boston. Next season, Mazzulla will be going toe-to-toe with the former NBA sharpshooter after the Lakers agreed to a four-year deal with Redick according to Adrian Wojnarowski of ESPN.com.\n\nThe hire endless a lengthy search process for the Lakers since firing Darvin Ham after two seasons at the helm. The Lakers offered UConn head coach Dan Hurley a six-year contract last weekend but Hurley opted to stay put at the collegiate level. Celtics assistant Sam Cassell was among numerous candidates to be interviewed for the Lakers position but Redick ends up with the gig in his first coaching position after a 15 year career.\n\nRedick started a podcast with Lakers star LeBron James this past season and his relationship with the All-Star was likely a big factor in the decision. James has a player option with the Lakers this offseason and is widely expected to stay in LA, especially after this hire.\n\nRedick has a tall task to return the Lakers to prominence in the Western Conference after an underwhelming first round exit to the Nuggets this year. The team lacks cap room and has limited means to upgrade its supporting cast around an aging James and Anthony Davis after finishing as the No. 6 seed in the Western Conference last year. The team is expected to be active on the trade market entering the start of free agency.\n\nRedick will need to assemble a coaching staff so it will be worth watching whether any Celtics assistants will end up in Los Angeles. Cassell, per multiple league sources, will be a potential target for Redick as an assistant. Boston has already lost assistant Charles Lee this offseason to a head coaching job with the Hornets."
