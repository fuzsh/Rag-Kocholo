        "text": "LeBron James and JJ Redick might be moving their partnership from the mics to an NBA court pretty soon.\n\nThe Los Angeles Lakers are focusing in on the former guard as the frontrunner to be the franchise’s next head coach, according to Shams Charania of The Athletic.\n\nRedick, 39, is one of two candidates the Lakers have shown the most interest in according to Charania. New Orleans Pelicans assistant coach James Borrego is the other.\n\nLA’s search began in the off-season after the team fired Darvin Ham. During Ham’s two-year tenure, the Lakers failed to win 50 games in either season and were eliminated by the Denver Nuggets in back-to-back playoffs.\n\nCharania reports that no official decision has been made, but his sources indicate that Redick is the franchise’s leading choice at this stage.\n\nRedick, a former Duke Blue Devil, has never coached above the youth level and is currently pursuing a media career as a colour commentator and analyst for ESPN.\n\nThe former 11th overall pick in the 2006 draft played for six teams in his 15-year career, averaging 12.8 points on a 41.5 per cent three-point shooting rate.\n\nOther candidates the Lakers have reportedly considered include the Miami Heat’s Chris Quinn, the Celtics’ Sam Cassell, the Timberwolves’ Micah Nori and the Nuggets’ David Adelman.\n\nAccording to Charania, the Lakers are looking for a coach with long-term staying power who can command a locker room, hold players accountable and bring tactical structure to the organization. And there appears to be a belief that Redick may check all those boxes."
