        "text": "I’m starting a new job today. After 18 years of working at a newspaper, I have joined The Athletic. I believe in this place with my entire heart. Well-reported, well-written stories matter more than anything else here.\n\nAll of that is true, but it does not completely explain who I am or why I made this move.\n\nFew people inspire me more than my late older brother, Jeff Robbins. In my eyes, he was perfect. He lived like a force of nature. Supremely confident and naturally outgoing, he possessed many of the qualities I lack. He was short and squat, standing just 5-foot-5 under a mop of curly black hair, but he excelled in every sport he played.\n\nJeff did things I never had the guts to do, and that may be what I appreciate most about him. When he was a teenager, he joined an amateur boxing club and trained for the Golden Gloves. Maybe he wanted to be like one of his heroes, Sugar Ray Leonard, who grew up not too far from us in suburban Washington, D.C. Jeff won his first fight but lost his second bout by decision; he swore he lost only because mononucleosis sapped his energy.\n\nIn 1997, years after becoming a successful lawyer, Jeff took his motorcycle out on a sunny Saturday afternoon in Maryland and crashed. Alcohol wasn’t involved. He just lost control of his Harley. He died that night. He was 33 years old.\n\nI’m ashamed to admit it, but I try not to think about him much. Please don’t misunderstand me; I love him and would do anything to bring him back. But I still feel angry about his death, about how he should have lived another 50 years, about the hell he put our parents, our older brother, Jon, and me through. What a senseless loss.\n\nTruth is, I blame myself more than I blame Jeff. I should’ve done whatever necessary to stop him from riding that damn motorcycle, even if it meant going to his parking lot — wrench and hammer in hand — and disassembling his bike piece by piece. It just never occurred to me that he could be imperfect enough to have a serious accident. I have many regrets in life, but nothing else comes close.\n\nI was 23 when he died. At the time, I was working at a think tank in D.C. and studying to take the LSAT. Going to law school was the safe thing to do. But Jeff’s death made me reevaluate everything, including my career choice. Becoming an attorney didn’t excite me. Becoming a journalist did.\n\nIf life can be so short, as Jeff’s was, I figured I should spend it doing something I regarded as special.\n\nSo I tried. I scrapped my law school plans and instead went to journalism school. I eventually landed at a great outlet, the Orlando Sentinel, surrounded by reporters and editors who mentored me.\n\nI grew up at the Sentinel. I started out covering rec leagues and youth sports in Lake County, a place dotted by orange groves. As sportswriters know, you learn more about reporting by covering high schools than the pros. At high school football or basketball games, you compile your own stats. You learn never to trust the spellings listed on team rosters; you ask the kids themselves.\n\nYou’ll never hear me complain about the Sentinel. Its newsroom still teems with passion. It still produces great journalism. The choice to leave kept me awake nights and churned my stomach, but as I pored over my decision, I thought a lot about Jeff. Leaving my comfort zone felt like a risk, but sometimes smart risks make sense. Being here just feels right.\n\nThe 2018-19 season is my 10th year covering the Orlando Magic, but it already feels like a rebirth.\n\nThe goal is to portray people in three vivid dimensions. I will write more pieces like the one I wrote about the Gibbs Gladiators, a high school basketball team that shattered a racial barrier during segregation. I will explore the events that shape people’s lives, like how Frank Vogel escaped a house fire during his senior year of high school. I will explain what motivates people off the court, as caring for six younger brothers and sisters motivates Bismack Biyombo.\n\nThis explains why I’ve told you about Jeff. If I ask people to open up and share parts of their lives with me, then I should be candid about my life, too. Openness flows in two directions.\n\nFrom Dwight Howard to Nikola Vucevic, I’ve covered the Magic at their best and their worst, from their 59-win team in 2009-10 to their miserable last six years.\n\nThere’s a lot to chronicle these days. Guard play and 3-point shooting reign in the NBA, but the Magic have pinned their long-term hopes around a young frontcourt of Aaron Gordon, second-year player Jonathan Isaac and rookie Mohamed Bamba. Orlando’s longest-tenured player, Vucevic, is entering the final season of his contract and may not stick around beyond the February trade deadline. A new coach, Steve Clifford, faces a herculean task: trying to give a nondescript mishmash of players an identity.\n\nI sometimes wonder what Jeff would have thought about my career choice. It seems like we talked about everything — everything, that is, except his reading habits. He loved sports, but I don’t remember if he ever picked up a newspaper sports section.\n\nBut I suspect he would’ve been proud that I found a career that makes me happy. In that sense, I honor Jeff every day I work here. I owe him that. I live my dream because he did not.\n\n(Top photo of — left to right — Jeff Robbins, the author, Joan Robbins and Jon Robbins courtesy of the Robbins family)"
