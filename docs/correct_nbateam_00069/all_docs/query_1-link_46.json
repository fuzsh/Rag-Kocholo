        "text": "Orlando Magic 2021: News, Schedule, Roster, Score, Injury Report\n\nThe Orlando Magic compete in the NBA as a part of the Southeast Division in the Eastern Conference. The franchise has made it to the NBA finals twice, but is yet to win a championship.?\n\nJust like their name, the Orlando Magic try to keep their logo as an attractive element. The design contains a magical basketball with trails, on top of which the team?s name is arched in black and blue.?\n\nFurthermore, the Orlando Magic play their home games at the Amway Center, a major sports and entertainment arena located in the city. The Magic moved to the Amway Center in 2010, and the league hosted the 2012 All-Star weekend in this arena.\n\nWho owns the Orlando Magic??\n\nAmerican businessman Richard DeVos founded RDV Sports Inc to acquire the Orlando Magic in 1991. The franchise was under his control, and DeVos also owned the WNBA?s Orlando Miracle for a few years.?\n\nAfter DeVos? death, the ownership passed on to the RDV corporation, but Chief Executive Officer Alex Martins takes care of the day-to-day activities at the franchise. Moreover, Richard DeVos? son Dan took over his father?s role as Chairman/Governor of the franchise after his passing.?\n\nHead Coach and Top Executives\n\nThe Magic hired Steve Clifford to take over head coaching duties in 2018. Clifford?s coaching stints in the NBA have come through the Charlotte Hornets and now, the Magic. He has plenty of experience in his field and has served as an assistant on numerous teams.?\n\nClifford spent five seasons in Charlotte, where he registered a 196-214 record before joining the Orlando Magic. The 59-year-old posted a winning record in his very first season as Magic?s coach and took them to the playoffs.?\n\nFurthermore, Alex Martin has been the long-serving CEO of the franchise. He took over the duties in 2006 and has been holding office ever since. Former Bucks? General Manager John Hammond currently serves the same role with the Orlando Magic.?\n\nThe Magic made major changes back in 2017 when they hired Jeff Weltman as the President of Basketball Operations. He signed with the team on a five-year deal and left his role as the Raptors? GM and moved to Orlando.?\n\nHistory\n\nThe Orlando Magic came into the NBA as an expansion team in 1989, along with the Minnesota Timberwolves. Although the first few years were a struggle, the franchise blossomed when they made the most out of their back-to-back #1 draft picks in 1992 and 1993.\n\nMuch to the city?s delight, the Orlando Magic emerged as one of the bright contenders in the 90s. The team was powered by the dynamic pairing of Shaquille O?Neal and Penny Hardaway, who dazzled with their on-court chemistry.?\n\nThey enjoyed rapid success by making it to the 1995 NBA Finals, but Hakeem Olajuwon and the Houston Rockets swept them to end the Magic?s campaign on a disappointment.?\n\nO?Neal left the team in 1996 and joined the Los Angeles Lakers, causing a major rift in the franchise. With O?Neal gone and Hardaway down with injury woes, the Orlando Magic lost their spark and found it tough during their postseason runs.\n\nAlso Read: HILARIOUS: When Shaquille O?Neal Challenged Michael Phelps To A Swimming Contest\n\nHowever, the Magic once again struck gold in the NBA draft when they selected Dwight Howard with the #1 pick in 2004. Howard evolved as a defensive rock in the league and guided the team to the finals in 2009. During his Magic stint, Howard became the first player to win Defensive Player of the Year for three consecutive seasons.?\n\nAlso Read: Former Teammate Shuts Down Dwight Howard Critics Over His Controversial Exit From Orlando Magic\n\nThe 2010s decade began on a dull note and hasn?t picked up well in terms of playoff success. The team only has four postseason appearances since 2011, a record that they would be willing to shatter in the coming years.?\n\nOrlando Magic: Mascot and Uniforms\n\nThe Magic has an official mascot who goes by the name ?Stuff the Magic Dragon.? His name is a play on an old folk song called ?Puff the Magic Dragon.? They replaced Puff with Stuff to denote his dunking skills.?\n\nStuff is a well-loved mascot by everyone in the NBA, who has even made famous TV appearances. Rival mascots join him during Magic?s home games and put on quite a show for the fans. Stuff was named Mascot of the Year in 2016 and has been with the franchise since its inception.?\n\nOwing to their name and heritage, the Magic?s primary colors are blue, black, and silver. But since the Nike deal happened, the team has also been wearing white ?Association? uniforms besides sporting jerseys in the team?s primary colors.?\n\nTeam?s Sponsors\n\nThe magic has an attractive sponsor in Walt Disney World. Everything goes with the name, as Disney is perfect as the team?s sponsor, due to the franchise?s magical beliefs. Disney struck a three-year deal with the team to become their jersey sponsors, and their patches are quite attractive!\n\nBesides Disney, the Magic has tie-ups with Uber, Nike, Olive Garden, ReplyBuy, and several other companies as well.?\n\nHistory and Achievements?\n\nFounded?1989ConferenceEasternDivision?SoutheastPresident?Jeff WeltmanGeneral ManagerJohn HammondHead Coach?Steve CliffordArena?Amway CenterChampionships (0)?Conference Titles (2)(1995, 2009)Division Titles (6)(1995, 1996, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2019)Websitewww.nba.com/magic\n\nOrlando Magic 2021 roster"
