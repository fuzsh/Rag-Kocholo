        "text": "Wells Fargo ROA % Calculation\n\nWells Fargo's annualized ROA % for the fiscal year that ended in Dec. 2023 is calculated as:\n\nROA %=Net Income (A: Dec. 2023 )/( (Total Assets (A: Dec. 2022 )+Total Assets (A: Dec. 2023 ))/ count ) =19142/( (1881020+1932468)/ 2 ) =19142/1906744 =1.00 %\n\nWells Fargo's annualized ROA % for the quarter that ended in Jun. 2024 is calculated as:\n\nROA %=Net Income (Q: Jun. 2024 )/( (Total Assets (Q: Mar. 2024 )+Total Assets (Q: Jun. 2024 ))/ count ) =19640/( (1959153+1940073)/ 2 ) =19640/1949613 =1.01 %\n\n* For Operating Data section: All numbers are indicated by the unit behind each term and all currency related amount are in USD.\n\n* For other sections: All numbers are in millions except for per share data, ratio, and percentage. All currency related amount are indicated in the company's associated stock exchange currency.\n\nIn the calculation of annual ROA %, the net income of the last fiscal year and the average total assets over the fiscal year are used. In calculating the quarterly data, the Net Income data used here is four times the quarterly (Jun. 2024) net income data. ROA % is displayed in the 30-year financial page.\n\nWells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) ROA % Explanation\n\nROA % measures the rate of return on the total assets (shareholder equity plus liabilities). It measures a firm's efficiency at generating profits from shareholders' equity plus its liabilities. ROA % shows how well a company uses what it has to generate earnings. ROA %s can vary drastically across industries. Therefore, ROA % should not be used to compare companies in different industries. For retailers, a ROA % of higher than 5% is expected. For example, Wal-Mart (WMT) has a ROA % of about 8% as of 2012. For banks, ROA % is close to their interest spread. A bankÂ’s ROA % is typically well under 2%.\n\nSimilar to ROE, ROA % is affected by profit margins and asset turnover. This can be seen from the Du Pont Formula:\n\nROA %(Q: Jun. 2024 ) =Net Income/Total Assets =19640/1949613 =(Net Income / Revenue)*(Revenue / Total Assets) =(19640 / 82756)*(82756 / 1949613) =Net Margin %*Asset Turnover =23.73 %*0.0424 =1.01 %\n\nNote: The Net Income data used here is four times the quarterly (Jun. 2024) net income data. The Revenue data used here is four times the quarterly (Jun. 2024) revenue data.\n\n* For Operating Data section: All numbers are indicated by the unit behind each term and all currency related amount are in USD.\n\n* For other sections: All numbers are in millions except for per share data, ratio, and percentage. All currency related amount are indicated in the company's associated stock exchange currency.\n\nBe Aware\n\nLike ROE, ROA % is calculated with only 12 months data. Fluctuations in the company's earnings or business cycles can affect the ratio drastically. It is important to look at the ratio from a long term perspective. ROA % can be affected by events such as stock buyback or issuance, and by goodwill, a company's tax rate and its interest payment. ROA % may not reflect the true earning power of the assets. A more accurate measurement is ROC % (ROC).\n\nMany analysts argue the higher return the better. Buffett states that really high ROA % may indicate vulnerability in the durability of the competitive advantage.\n\nE.g. Raising $43b to take on KO is impossible, but $1.7b to take on Moody's is. Although Moody's ROA % and underlying economics is far superior to Coca Cola, the durability is far weaker because of lower entry cost.\n\nWells Fargo ROA % Related Terms\n\nThank you for viewing the detailed overview of Wells Fargo's ROA % provided by GuruFocus.com.
