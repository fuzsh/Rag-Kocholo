        "text": "Wells Fargo has offered a number of different checking accounts over the years, and when they stop offering one they generally grandfather anybody who currently has it. Apparently that has changed.\n\nThe account that used to be offered to senior citizens was done away with a while back, and now they're apparently force converting those folks to their 'Everyday Checking' account.\n\nInfo on the change here: https://sites.wf.com/essentialtoeveryday/\n\nI am a secondary account holder on an account of this type. At-a-glance, what I notice that has been lost of most value is the discount on check orders, which many people in the age bracket for this account type will likely still be using. The account monthly fee has increased from $7 to $10, but the activities for waiving the fee have been (slightly) expanded and the minimum direct deposit is still the same ($500) so this isn't likely to trip-up many people.\n\nThe other account I have with WF is a Preferred Checking account; this is also being force-converted to an Everyday Checking account. This account type has been discontinued for new customers for several years. It's an in-between account... it has more perks than the standard accounts, but not as many as the 'fancy' accounts (and easier requirements for waving the fee than the fancy accounts as well). More information on the account type here: https://www08.wellsfargomedia.com/assets/pdf/personal/deposits/preferred-checking.pdf\n\nInfo on the change here: https://sites.wf.com/preferredtoeveryday/\n\nA bit more is being lost with this one. While the DD and minimum balance requirements for waiving the monthly fee are easier with the Everyday account, going away are no-fee cashier's checks, no-fee money orders, check discounts, and limited ATM fee waivers. Also, I didn't see anything about interest mentioned (the Preferred offers a pitiful interest rate on the daily collected balance over $500) but the Everyday account doesn't pay interest, so this has been lost as well (as minimal as it may have been). Finally, one of the fee waiver options for the Preferred account was linking a WF Home Mortgage, which isn't an option on the new Everyday Checking account.\n\nOddly, in both cases they point out the added benefits that can be gained by linking a WF Campus ATM card or Campus Debit card, yet neither of these account types were likely widely utilized by college students. ðŸ¤”\n\nOff and On subject.\n\nUsBank eliminated their old checking and savings programs/structures/products back a couple of years when they moved to \"Smartly Banking\". Their program (from where I sit) is aimed at the new or those with needs of checking benefits that are more focused on no fees for over drafts and the like. The actual earnings for the Tiers of Interest are low (no shock as it seems most everyone does not pay much on checking). Read years back that banks spent $175 per year for one customer checking account (believe what you will).\n\nIn the past US Bank ran the Silver, Gold, Platinum, College Students, Seniors and Military (which were all Grandfathered in) checking accounts. On the Gold Checking account all you had to do to waive the monthly fee was have a US Bank Credit Card (easy fee waive). Platinum required $24.95 per month fee or $25,000 in various type of bank accounts (heavy cost) checking.\n\nNoticed today they are adding features of the Smartly Banking products on to my existing bank accounts. They also have a note that signing up for Smartly Banking products may increase or decrease your benefits. In my case as an old banking customer, Smartly Banking has no benefit for me. If I were seeking a bank today, I would be passing on the US Bank's Smartly Banking products. It will be a major step back if they force conversions. Since Smartly Banking seems to be creeping into my US Bank products I wonder how long I can remain Grandfathered in?\n\nCertainly food for thought?\n\nI'm old and I have the wells everyday. I don't care about checks, didn't even get the debit card. I opened the account for relatioship, I wanted a credit card, and for a $325 bribe. I keep $500 there to avoid the fee. I know I could Smurf a $500 ach push every month instead. I'll probably just close it, don't use it. Then, in 12 months, I can open and collect sub again!\n\nI also have the usb smarty. No fee because I'm old, also because I have credit card. Opened for the $500 sub. Id like to try their same day ach, but I don't have another bank that participates. Takes two to tango.\n\n@FicoMike0 wrote:\n\nI'm old and I have the wells everyday. I don't care about checks, didn't even get the debit card.

In the morning I set up the funds I want to move around and by 1 pm to 2 pm they are where I sent them. It is great. However, if you do not have two to tango, it does not work (which you already stated) as I did try and failed.\n\n@FicoMike0 wrote:\n\nI'm old and I have the wells everyday.

Takes two to tango.\n\nYeah, the changes aren't showstoppers for me, but I have been using the free cashier's check perk a couple of times a year so I'll miss that (although for my purposes, a free teller check from NFCU is a workable solution). I just ordered paper checks last year so I will be fine for a while there.\n\nThis is a relatively minor nerf in the grand scheme of things, but still annoying nonetheless. I did get a good laugh at how they tried to put the corporate spin on the announcement(s) to make this seem like a positive for customers when it's anything but. \"Weâ€™ve updated our checking accounts to better meet the needs of our customers,\" uh, no... adding charges for stuff I actually use doesn't better meet my needs!\n\nI don't understand why anyone would want to deal with these monolithic banks which clearly don't care about your business. And then they say things like (and I quote from the Wells Fargo link above):\n\n\"Weâ€™ve updated our checking accounts to better meet the needs of our customers.\"\n\nThe last time a banker told me something like that my reply was, \"Don't p!ss on my leg and tell me it's raining! Close my account.\"\n\nIt's the 21st century. There are a ton of options out there. There are small local banks which have no fee checking without having to jump thru 80 hoops to get free checking. There are credit unions which do the same. There are fintech banks/neo banks which pay a lot more than the 0.01% Wells Fargo and BoA are paying in interest. And there are brokerages like Fidelity or Schwab which offer everything a bank offers (with the exception of local cash deposits and other local services). Sometimes you just have to get creative to maximize the amount of value you get. It's fair for banks and other financial institutions to make money off your money. It's not fair for them to charge you for the \"priviledge\" of using your money to help them make money."
