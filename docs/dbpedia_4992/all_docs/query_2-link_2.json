Here are some recent trends covered in EMARKETER reports.\n\nA big year for brand safety: Banks cannot meaningfully engage consumers without using social media, but it’s exposing them to more potential brand damage than ever. Bank marketers must understand emerging brand safety risks, especially in a US election year.\n\nPreparing for Gen Alpha: This young demographic is on track to become the largest generation. Banks must start building relationships with children today to convert them into customers later.\n\nGen Z is in denial about finances: Gen Z’s financial aspirations and spending habits aren’t in line with their economic reality. Banks can help them manage their expectations and plan for the future with engaging financial education—boosting Gen Z customer lifetime value in the process.\n\nBanking chatbots are getting an AI boost: Chatbots are critical to customer relationships in banking, but customers still don’t like chatbots as much as banks do. Consumers’ adoption of AI banking chatbots also varies by country."
