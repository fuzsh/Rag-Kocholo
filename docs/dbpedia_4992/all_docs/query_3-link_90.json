        "text": "This report presents the current financial performance and health analysis of Wells Fargo with an emphasis on the company’s profitability, liquidity, solvency and managerial efficiency for the period 2015 – 2017. The report also includes analysis of business opportunities, success factors, risks, and financial statement projections for 2018 – 2020 along with sensitivity analysis of 2018 financial performance. Methods of analysis include common-size and trend analyses, as ratios such as ROA, ROE, turnover, and net margin among many others. Other calculations for gauging the company’s financial health include WACC, EV and market capitalization. All the calculations and financial projections can be found in the appendices. The data analyzed was collected from the company’s actual financial statements for the past several years, and the results indicate that the company is in a strong position compared to its closest competitors. Its performance in terms of profitability, liquidity, solvency and efficiency is above the industry average. The report finds that Wells Fargo’s future prospects are excellent and it can comfortably undertake emerging investment opportunities as the company has the resources to fuel future growth. It is recommended that the company invests $5.2 billion to acquire the MSRs of Navy Federal Credit Union to expand its assets base and consolidate its market leadership when it comes to mortgage servicing. Key limitations of the report include incorporation of assumptions in projecting future financial performance, inability to accurately forecast future economic conditions and use of past performance to create pro forma statements."
