        "text": "CHICAGO and NEW YORK, July 26, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- GTCR LLC and Reverence Capital Partners, L.P. today announced that upon closing of their acquisition of Wells Fargo Asset Management (WFAM), the newly independent company will be rebranded as Allspring Global Investments. The new name Allspring Global Investments reflects the newly independent firm's rich history in investment leadership and its commitment to renewal, growth, and meaningful client outcomes.\n\nAs part of the transition, veteran industry executive Joseph A. Sullivan will become Chief Executive Officer, in addition to his previously announced role as Executive Chairman. Mr. Sullivan will succeed Nico Marais, WFAM's current CEO, who will retire upon closing of the transaction and continue to serve Allspring as a senior advisor.\n\nMr. Sullivan comes to Allspring with more than 40 years of industry experience, previously serving as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Legg Mason, Inc. from 2012 until its acquisition by Franklin Templeton in 2020. He joined Legg Mason in September 2008 and, after serving as Head of Global Distribution and Chief Administrative Officer, was appointed interim Chief Executive Officer as of October 2012. Before joining Legg Mason, he served on the Board of Directors of Stifel Financial and as Executive Vice President and Head of Fixed Income Capital Markets for Stifel Nicolaus from December 2005. Previously in his career, Mr. Sullivan held executive roles at prominent financial firms including Legg Mason Wood Walker, Dain Bosworth, and Piper Jaffray.\n\n\"I am honored and energized to have the opportunity to lead Allspring, as we enter a new era for the firm,\" said Mr. Sullivan. \"In spending time with Nico and the organization over the past few months, I have been incredibly impressed by the depth of investment expertise and quality of our people and leadership. Our new name truly embodies a renewed corporate culture and commitment to continue to invest thoughtfully and partner with our clients to navigate the future.\"\n\nCollin Roche, Managing Director of GTCR, said, \"Today's announcements mark key milestones in the transformation of WFAM into a focused, independent, global asset management firm serving private wealth and institutional clients around the world. We are excited about the possibilities of our new name, Allspring Global Investments, and that Joe Sullivan will become Allspring's CEO. Joe is recognized as one of the asset management industry's most respected leaders, and he will be exceptionally valuable as we execute on our growth strategy. We would like to thank Nico Marais for his strong leadership of WFAM, and we are pleased that he will continue to serve as a senior advisor.\"\n\nMr. Marais shared, \"This is a tremendously exciting time for the company, and as we make this transition, it is the right time for me personally and professionally to step down from active leadership and assume a new advisory role. I have cherished my time as CEO of WFAM and am very appreciative of the passion and professionalism of our people. We have accomplished a great deal, including the transition to independent ownership. I look forward to working with Joe and the team, and I am confident about what the future holds for the organization.\"\n\nMilton Berlinski, Co-Founder and Managing Partner of Reverence Capital, noted \"Today's leadership and name announcements give us even stronger conviction that the partnership between WFAM, GTCR and Reverence puts us in a powerful position to execute on our strategic vision for Allspring. We are pleased to have a leader of Joe's stature to take us forward as a newly independent company, and we are very grateful to Nico for his strong continued partnership during this time.\"\n\nOn February 23, 2021, GTCR LLC and Reverence Capital Partners, L.P. announced that they had agreed to acquire WFAM from Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE: WFC).
