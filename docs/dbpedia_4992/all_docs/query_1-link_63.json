        "text": "Shares of three of the largest U.S. lenders fell on Friday as first-quarter earnings season kicked off, giving investors a look at how the highest interest rates in two decades are affecting the banks.\n\nWells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase, and Citi all reported their results.\n\nJPMorgan Chase shares fell the most of the group, declining by more than 5% in response to what analysts viewed as disappointing news about net interest income.\n\nThe stock was on pace for its largest percentage decline since January 2022, when it fell by 6.2%. The S&P 500 fell 1% in early trading.\n\nJPMorgan, the largest U.S. bank by assets, reported $23.1 billion of net interest income, or NII. That was roughly in line with what Wall Street was expecting.\n\nBut the bank raised its guidance for NII excluding its markets business—a closely watched metric—by $1 billion to $89 billion, which was less than investors expected, Citi analyst Keith Horowitz said in a research note on Friday morning.\n\nWells Fargo shares were slightly lower after the bank reported NII of $12.23 billion. Analysts had expected $12.37 billion.\n\nAnalysts had also been watching for news on when regulators would remove a cap on the bank's assets--effectively a limit on its growth--that has been in place for six years in response to its sales-practices scandal.\n\nManagement said on a call with reporters on Friday that it couldn't provide an update. That timing is ultimately \"up to the regulators,\" Wells Fargo finance chief Michael Santomassimo said.\n\nMeanwhile, Citi shares slipped by just under 1%.\n\nThe bank, which Chief Executive Jane Fraser is in the process of overhauling in a bid to strengthen it, reported first-quarter earnings that topped Wall Street estimates. Citi said first-quarter revenue decreased 2% from the prior-year period.\n\nRevenue for Citigroup’s wealth management unit fell in the first quarter but the bank still sees an opportunity to grow the business over time by winning more wallet share with existing customers, said Chief Financial Officer Mark Mason.\n\nRevenue for wealth management fell 4% year over year to $1.7 billion due to lower net interest income, according to the company’s earnings report. The unit’s operating expenses rose 3% to $1.7 billion.\n\nGrowing the wealth unit is an important part of CEO Jane Fraser’s turnaround strategy. Last year, she reorganized the company around five key business lines, one of which was wealth management.\n\nLast year, Citi hired former Merrill Lynch executive Andy Sieg to oversee wealth management. Mason said Monday the bank has made progress putting the right team in place and it sees an opportunity to expand wallet share with existing wealth management customers by connecting them with more products and services.\n\n“We can do more with the clients we already have,” he said.\n\nMason added that the company has an opportunity to grow fee-based investments. (Citi reported that client investment assets, which includes trust and custody assets, rose 12% year over year to $515 billion). “Historically, parts of our business had a lean toward deposits and lending,” Mason said. “So we know there is an opportunity to do more with those clients.”"
