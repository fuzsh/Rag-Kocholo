In addition, to ensure that depositors receive prompt access to their insured deposits in the event of an insured depository institution&rsquo;s (each, an &ldquo;IDI&rdquo;) failure and to enable the FDIC to perform its resolution functions most efficiently, the FDIC has adopted a separate rule (the &ldquo;IDI Rule&rdquo;, and together with the Title I Rule, the &ldquo;Rules&rdquo;) requiring each IDI with $50 billion or more in total assets to periodically submit a resolution plan to the FDIC. Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (&ldquo;WFBNA&rdquo;), an IDI with more than $50 billion in total assets, is required to submit a resolution plan under the IDI Rule. 2 In light of WFBNA&rsquo;s importance to the Parent, and to ensure a coordinated approach to resolution planning for the Parent and its consolidated subsidiaries (collectively, the &ldquo;Company&rdquo;), the Parent and WFBNA are submitting a joint resolution plan (the &ldquo;Resolution Plan&rdquo;) to satisfy the Rules. The Resolution Plan is the Company&rsquo;s third annual submission under the Rules. The Resolution Plan provides for the resolution of the Company and its material entities (defined below), in the unlikely event of material financial distress or failure, in a rapid and orderly way, without posing systemic risk to the larger financial system and without the need for any government or taxpayer support. The Resolution Plan is a roadmap to facilitate the orderly resolution of the Company upon the failure of its material entities under applicable insolvency regimes. These insolvency regimes include receivership under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (the &ldquo;FDIA&rdquo;), reorganization or liquidation under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code (the &ldquo;Bankruptcy Code&rdquo;), and liquidation under the Securities Investor Protection Act of 1970 (&ldquo;SIPA&rdquo;) under the authority of a trustee appointed by the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (&ldquo;SIPC&rdquo;). The Resolution Plan assumes that a series of unrelated material financial events occur that affect the Company under economic conditions consistent with the baseline, adverse and severely adverse scenarios published by the FRB on October 23, 2014. The Resolution Plan also makes assumptions with respect to the condition of the Company and the state of the markets at the time of the assumed failure based, in part, on communications received from and ongoing dialogue with the Agencies. Unless otherwise indicated, information in this Public Summary is provided as of December 31, 2014. Under the Title I Rule, each &ldquo;covered company,&rdquo; including non-bank financial companies supervised by the FRB, U.S. bank holding companies and certain foreign banks and bank holding companies, with assets exceeding the $50 billion threshold is required to submit a resolution plan. 1 2 WFBNA is a covered insured depository institution (a &ldquo;CIDI&rdquo;) under the IDI Rule. A CIDI is an IDI with $50 billion or more in total assets. Wells Fargo 1\n\n4) Introduction The Company The Company is a nationwide, diversified, community-based financial services company with $1.7 trillion in assets. Founded in 1852 and headquartered in San Francisco, the Company provides banking, insurance, investments, mortgage, and consumer and commercial finance through more than 8,700 locations, 12,500 ATMs, the internet (wellsfargo.com) and mobile banking. The Company has offices in 36 countries to support its customers that conduct business in the global economy. With approximately 266,000 active, full-time equivalent team members, the Company serves one in three households in the United States. The Company&rsquo;s vision is to satisfy all its customers&rsquo; financial needs and help them succeed financially. Resolution Planning and Resolvability The Company has a risk management framework and culture characterized by a significant bias for conservatism and a long-term focus on the customer. This risk management framework and culture has resulted in an operating model and organization structure that the Company believes is straight-forward, especially for a large bank holding company (&ldquo;BHC&rdquo;). This operating model and organization structure has the following characteristics that the Company believes are supportive of resolvability: ï‚· The vast majority of the Company&rsquo;s revenues and profits are generated by, and nearly all of the Company&rsquo;s assets and liabilities are held by, WFBNA. ï‚· Key support functions and technology largely reside within WFBNA. This has the benefit of limiting interconnectivity between WFBNA and its non-bank affiliates and protecting WFBNA from the activities of its non-bank affiliates. ï‚· The Company&rsquo;s operations and employees are primarily located in the United States and the vast majority of revenues, profits, assets and liabilities are related to the Company&rsquo;s domestic operations. ï‚· The Company has a manageable number of operating companies, the majority of which engage in traditional banking activities. ï‚· The Company&rsquo;s derivatives activities are predominantly customer-driven and consist of wellaccepted and understood financial instruments (primarily, interest rate, commodity, equity, and foreign exchange (FX)). While the Company believes that its operating model and legal entity organization structure are supportive of resolvability and that its Resolution Plan provides strategies for its rapid and orderly resolution, the Company continues to improve its resolvability by integrating &ldquo;lessons learned&rdquo; through resolution planning into its corporate governance structure and business-as-usual processes and by identifying new issues and impediments to resolution that arise over time. When these new issues and impediments are identified, they typically are directed to relevant business lines and support groups to be addressed, remediated or otherwise mitigated. The Company believes line of business / support group accountability for addressing new issues and impediments appropriately aligns responsibility with subject matter expertise and those lines of business or support groups that will need to operate within the resulting environment following remediation or mitigation. Wells Fargo 2\n\n5) Introduction The Company continues to take steps to improve its ability to be resolved under the Bankruptcy Code, the FDIA and other applicable resolution regimes. The following steps, among others, are illustrative of the actions the Company has taken: ï‚· Governance Processes and Policies. The Company has adopted governance processes and policies that have the effect of making the Company more resolvable. For example, the Company has established a set of criteria for the ongoing rationalization of its legal entity structure (the &ldquo;Legal Entity Rationalization Criteria&rdquo;) and has adopted a Legal Entity Lifecycle Policy (the &ldquo;Lifecycle Policy&rdquo;) to provide for the monitoring, oversight and governance of the Company&rsquo;s subsidiaries. It also has implemented an enterprise-wide policy to manage guaranties executed by or on behalf of its material entities, has established a resolution planning policy to provide a governance framework for the Company&rsquo;s resolution planning responsibilities, and has formed a steering committee consisting of senior executives representing key business lines and risk disciplines to provide oversight with respect to resolution and recovery planning at the Company. As expected, these governance processes and policies have the added effect of integrating resolution planning throughout the Company. ï‚· Eliminating Redundant, Dormant or Inactive Subsidiaries. The Company continues to work to eliminate redundant, dormant or inactive subsidiaries within a reasonable period of time following their becoming redundant, dormant or inactive. The Company has eliminated over 1,000 legal entities since the Company acquired Wachovia Corporation on December 31, 2008. While maintaining its focus on serving customers, the Company will continue to look to simplify its legal entity structure as appropriate based on the Lifecycle Policy and the Legal Entity Rationalization Criteria. Eliminating redundant, dormant or inactive subsidiaries helps reduce complexity and thereby improves both the ongoing operation and the resolvability of the Company. ï‚· Remediating Impediments. The Company continues to identify and address potential impediments to the execution of the Resolution Plan, including taking actions designed to help ensure continued access to financial market utilities (FMUs) and the ongoing provision of critical support services following a resolution event. The Company does not believe that any of these identified impediments individually or in the aggregate pose material risk to the effective and timely execution of the Resolution Plan.3 ï‚· Resolution Preparedness. The Company has completed a self-assessment with respect to recovery and resolution capabilities identified by the FRB in SR14-1. As a result of this selfassessment, the Company is taking steps to enhance its existing capabilities relating to collateral management, payment, settlement and clearing activities, management and information systems, and shared and outsourced services. The Company does not believe that its existing capabilities in any of these areas individually or in the aggregate pose material risk to the effective and timely execution of the Resolution Plan. The Company&rsquo;s identification of additional impediments in the current iteration of the Resolution Plan was informed, in part, by a selfassessment undertaken with respect to the Principles and Practices for Recovery and Resolution Preparedness attachment to Supervisory Letter 14-1 (Heightened Supervisory Expectations for Recovery and Resolution Preparedness for Certain Large Bank Holding Companies &ndash; Supplemental Guidance on Consolidated Supervision Framework for Large Financial Institutions (SR Letter 12-17/CA letter 12-14)) (&ldquo;SR141&rdquo;) issued by the FRB on January 24, 2014. 3 Wells Fargo 3\n\n6) Introduction ï‚· Actions to Address Agency-Identified Obstacles. The Company has specifically considered the significant obstacles identified by the Agencies to rapid and orderly resolution in the &ldquo;Guidance for 2013 &sect; 165(d) Annual Resolution Plan Submissions by Domestic Covered Companies that Submitted Initial Resolutions Plans in 2012&rdquo; published by the Agencies in April 2013 and in the &ldquo;Guidance for Covered Insured Depository Institution Resolution Plan Submissions&rdquo; published by the FDIC in December 2014 (the &ldquo;Obstacles&rdquo;). The Obstacles are multiple competing insolvencies, global cooperation, operations and interconnectedness, counterparty actions, and funding and liquidity. The Company has taken or is taking action to address those Obstacles that are applicable to its operations. The Company believes that, through resolution planning efforts (and the development of the Resolution Plan) and risk management and governance initiatives that the Company has undertaken since 2008, it is increasingly resolvable and prepared for resolution in the unlikely event the Resolution Plan needs to be implemented. The Company is committed to continuing to improve its resolvability and resolution preparedness. This is consistent with the expectations of the Boards of Directors of the Parent and WFBNA and the Company&rsquo;s own risk management framework and culture. The Company will continue to take appropriate steps to improve resolvability, including by working with regulators to better understand key drivers and concerns, integrating resolution planning into its corporate governance and business-asusual processes, and raising resolution planning awareness throughout the Company. The Company also will continue to participate in industry-wide initiatives to address resolution issues. In addition, the Company will continue to identify new issues or impediments that may arise and have relevant lines of business and support groups take accountability for addressing, remediating or otherwise mitigating such new issues and impediments. Forward-Looking Statements This document contains forward-looking statements about the Company&rsquo;s future plans, objectives and resolution strategies, including the Company&rsquo;s expectations, assumptions and projections regarding the implementation of those strategies and the effectiveness of the Company&rsquo;s resolution planning efforts. Because forward-looking statements are based on the Company&rsquo;s current expectations and assumptions regarding the future, they are subject to inherent risks and uncertainties. In addition, the Company&rsquo;s expectations and projections regarding the implementation and effectiveness of the Company&rsquo;s resolution strategies are based on scenarios and assumptions that are hypothetical and may not reflect events to which the Company is or may become subject. Accordingly, you should not unduly rely on forwardlooking statements as actual results could differ materially from expectations.

Wells Fargo 4\n\n7) Summary of Resolution Plan A. Material Entities For purposes of resolution planning, the Company has identified five &ldquo;material entities&rdquo; under the Title I Rule. A material entity under the Title I Rule is any subsidiary that is significant to the activities of a critical operation4 or core business line (as defined below) of a covered company. The Company has also identified four material entities under the IDI Rule. A material entity under the IDI Rule is a company that is significant to the activities of a critical service 5 or core business line (as defined below) of a CIDI.6 The Resolution Plan addresses strategies that could be useful in ensuring the orderly resolution of each material entity in the event of material financial distress or failure. Each of the Company&rsquo;s material entities under the Rules are described below. Wells Fargo &amp; Company The Parent is the ultimate parent in the Company&rsquo;s organizational structure. It is a Delaware corporation and a publicly traded company listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the ticker symbol &ldquo;WFC&rdquo;. The Parent is a financial holding company and a bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act (the &ldquo;BHCA&rdquo;). It is the &ldquo;covered company&rdquo; under the Title I Rule and a material entity under the IDI Rule. The Parent&rsquo;s subsidiaries, which include five IDIs, provide banking, insurance, investments, mortgage banking, investment banking, retail banking, brokerage and consumer finance services through banking stores, the internet and other distribution channels to consumers and businesses in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and jurisdictions outside of the United States, including through branches and representative offices of WFBNA. The Parent itself does not directly engage in activities designated as critical operations under the Title I Rule or core business lines under the Rules. Rather, the Parent provides its direct and indirect subsidiaries with capital and funding, which in turn, enables those subsidiaries to engage in the Company&rsquo;s critical operations and core business lines. The Company&rsquo;s consolidated net income was $23.1 billion in 2014, with diluted earnings per common share of $4.10. Consolidated revenue in 2014 was $84.3 billion. As of December 31, 2014, the Company&rsquo;s consolidated assets were approximately $1.7 trillion. The Company&rsquo;s total liabilities as of December 31, 2014, were approximately $1.5 trillion. As of December 31, 2014, the Parent&rsquo;s assets on a stand-alone basis were approximately $312.1 billion and its total liabilities on a stand-alone basis were approximately $184.4 billion. Loans to and investments in its subsidiaries and cash represent a substantial portion of the Parent&rsquo;s total assets. The Parent&rsquo;s primary funding sources are the receipt of dividends from its subsidiaries, including WFBNA, the issuance of long-term debt and the repayment of loans previously extended to its subsidiaries. The Parent&rsquo;s primary uses of funds are to provide capital and funding to its direct and indirect subsidiaries, to repay long-term debt, and for Under the Title I Rule, &ldquo;critical operations&rdquo; are those operations, including associated services, functions and support, the failure or discontinuance of which, in the view of the covered company or as jointly directed by the FRB and the FDIC, would pose a threat to the financial stability of the United States. 4 Under the IDI Rule, &ldquo;critical services&rdquo; means services and operations of the CIDI, such as servicing, information technology support and operations, human resources and personnel, that are necessary to continue the day-to-day operations of the CIDI. 5 The definition of &ldquo;core business line&rdquo; under the Title I Rule is slightly different than the definition of &ldquo;core business line&rdquo; under the IDI Rule. For this reason, a separate analysis has been conducted for each. 6 Wells Fargo 5\n\n8) Summary of Resolution Plan discretionary capital actions. Short-term debt is not significant, with the majority of the Parent&rsquo;s shortterm debt representing borrowings from wholly-owned non-bank subsidiaries.

The Company&rsquo;s objective is to maintain capital at an amount commensurate with the Company&rsquo;s risk profile and risk tolerance objectives, and to meet both regulatory and market expectations. The Company&rsquo;s potential sources of capital primarily include retention of earnings net of dividends, as well as issuances of common and preferred stock. Regulatory Capital The Company and each of its IDIs are subject to various regulatory capital adequacy requirements administered by the FRB and the OCC. Risk-based capital (&ldquo;RBC&rdquo;) guidelines establish risk-adjusted capital ratios relating capital to different categories of assets and off-balance sheet exposures. At December 31, 2014, the Company and each of its IDIs were &ldquo;well-capitalized&rdquo; under applicable regulatory capital adequacy guidelines. The Company&rsquo;s capital adequacy assessment process contemplates a wide range of risks that the Company is exposed to and takes into consideration potential performance under a variety of stressed economic conditions, as well as regulatory expectations and guidance, rating agency viewpoints and the view of capital markets participants. The following table presents regulatory capital information for the Company and WFBNA. Information for December 31, 2014, reflects the transition to Basel III capital requirements from previous regulatory capital adequacy guidelines under Basel I effective in 2013. Among other matters, Basel III revises the definition of capital, and changes are being phased in effective January 1, 2014, through the end of 2021, with regulatory capital ratios determined using Basel III (General Approach) risk-weighted assets during 2014. Under Basel III (General Approach), at December 31, 2014, the Company&rsquo;s Common Equity Tier 1 capital was $137.1 billion, or 11.04% of risk-weighted assets, and WFBNA&rsquo;s Common Equity Tier 1 capital was $119.9 billion, or 10.49% of risk-weighted assets.

These changes are being fully phased in effective January 1, 2014, through the end of 2021 and the capital ratios will be determined using Basel III (General Approach) RWAs during 2014. (2) Under transition provisions to Basel III, cumulative other comprehensive income (previously deducted under Basel I) is included in CET1 over a specified phase-in period. In addition, certain intangible assets includable in CET1 are phased out over a specified period. (3) Goodwill and other intangible assets are net of any associated deferred tax liabilities. (4) CET1 (formerly Tier 1 common equity under Basel I) is a non-GAAP financial measure that is used by investors, analysts, and bank regulatory agencies to access the capital position of financial services companies. Management reviews CET1 along with other measures of capital as part of its financial analyses and has included this non-GAAP financial information, and the corresponding reconciliation to total equity, because of current interest in such information on the part of market participants. (5) Under the regulatory guidelines for risk based capital, on-balance sheet assets and credit equivalent amounts of derivatives and off-balance sheet items are assigned to one of several broad risk categories according to the obligor, or, if relevant, the guarantor or the nature of any collateral. The aggregate dollar amount in each risk category is then multiplied by the risk weight associated with that category. The resulting weighted values from each of the risk categories are aggregated for determining total RWAs. Wells Fargo 17\n\n20) Summary of Resolution Plan Capital Planning and Stress Testing Under the FRB&rsquo;s capital plan rule, large BHCs are required to submit capital plans annually for review to determine if the FRB has any objections before making any capital distributions. The capital plan rule requires updates to capital plans in the event of material changes in a BHC&rsquo;s risk profile, including as a result of any significant acquisitions. The FRB assesses the overall financial condition, risk profile, and capital adequacy of BHCs while considering both quantitative and qualitative factors when evaluating capital plans. On March 11, 2015, the FRB notified the Company that it did not object to the Company&rsquo;s capital plan included in the Company&rsquo;s 2015 Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (&ldquo;CCAR&rdquo;) submission. Major Funding Sources and Liquidity Management The objective of effective funding and liquidity management is to ensure that the Company can meet customer loan requests, customer deposit maturities / withdrawals, and other cash commitments efficiently under both normal operating conditions and under periods of Company-specific and / or market stress. To achieve this objective, the Parent&rsquo;s Board of Directors has established liquidity guidelines that require sufficient asset-based liquidity to cover potential funding requirements and to avoid over-dependence on volatile, less reliable funding markets. These guidelines are monitored on a monthly basis by the Company&rsquo;s Corporate Asset Liability Management Committee and on a quarterly basis by the Parent&rsquo;s Board of Directors. These guidelines are established and monitored for both the consolidated Company and for the Parent on a stand-alone basis to ensure that the Parent is a source of strength for its regulated, deposit-taking banking subsidiaries. The Company maintains liquidity in the form of cash, cash equivalents and unencumbered high-quality, liquid securities. These assets make up the Company&rsquo;s primary sources of liquidity. The Company&rsquo;s cash is primarily on deposit with the FRB. Securities available-for-sale included as part of the Company&rsquo;s primary sources of liquidity are comprised of U.S. Treasury and federal agency debt, and mortgagebacked securities issued by federal agencies within the Company&rsquo;s investment portfolio. The Company believes that securities provide an important source of liquidity through sales or by pledging to obtain financing, regardless of market conditions. A portion of these securities are included within the held-tomaturity portion of the Company&rsquo;s investment securities portfolio and as such are not intended for sale but may be pledged to obtain financing. Liquidity is also available through the sale or financing of other securities, including trading and / or available-for-sale securities, as well as through the sale, securitization or financing of loans, to the extent such securities and loans are not encumbered. Core customer deposits have historically provided a sizeable source of relatively stable and low-cost funds. At December 31, 2014, core deposits were approximately 122% of total loans. Additional funding is provided by long-term debt, other foreign deposits, and short-term borrowings. The Company accesses domestic and international capital markets for long-term funding through issuances of registered debt securities and private placements.

Description of Derivative and Hedging Activities The Company primarily uses derivatives to manage exposure to market risk, including interest rate risk, credit risk and foreign currency risk, and to assist customers with their risk management objectives. The Company designates certain derivatives as hedging instruments in a qualifying hedge accounting relationship (fair value or cash flow hedge). The Company&rsquo;s remaining derivatives consist of economic hedges that do not qualify for hedge accounting and derivatives held for customer accommodation, trading or other purposes. The use of derivatives helps minimize unplanned fluctuations in earnings, fair values of assets and liabilities, and cash flows caused by interest rate, foreign currency and other market risk volatility. As a result of fluctuations in these exposures, hedged assets and liabilities will gain or lose fair value. In a fair value or economic hedge, the effect of this unrealized gain or loss will generally be offset by the gain or loss on the derivatives linked to the hedged assets and liabilities. In a cash flow hedge, where the Company manages the variability of cash payments due to interest rate fluctuations by the use of derivatives linked to hedged assets and liabilities, the hedged asset or liability is not adjusted and the unrealized gain or loss on the derivative is generally reflected in other comprehensive income and not in earnings. The Company also offers various derivatives, including interest rate, commodity, equity, credit and foreign exchange contracts, to customers as part of the Company&rsquo;s trading businesses. These derivative transactions, which involve the Company engaging in market-making activities or acting as an intermediary, are conducted in an effort to help customers manage risk. The Company usually offsets its exposure from such derivatives by entering into other financial contracts, such as separate derivative or security transactions. The customer accommodations and any offsetting derivatives are treated as customer accommodation, trading and other derivatives in the Company&rsquo;s financial disclosures. The following table presents the total notional or contractual amounts and fair values for the Company&rsquo;s derivatives. Derivative transactions can be measured in terms of the notional amount, but this amount is not recorded on the Company&rsquo;s balance sheet and is not, when viewed in isolation, a meaningful measure of the risk profile of the instruments. The notional amount is generally not exchanged, but is used only as the basis on which interest and other payments are determined. Derivatives designated as qualifying hedge contracts and economic hedges are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value in other assets or other liabilities. Customer accommodation, trading and other derivatives are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value in trading assets, other assets or other liabilities.

Description of Foreign Operations While the Company does maintain foreign operations to support the financial needs of its customers, the Company&rsquo;s operations and employees primarily are located in the United States. As a result, the vast majority of revenues, profits, assets, and liabilities are related to the Company&rsquo;s domestic operations. The Company&rsquo;s foreign operations are conducted through WFBNA&rsquo;s overseas branches16 and the Company&rsquo;s foreign subsidiaries, the largest of which is WFBI, a Dublin-based bank supervised by the Central Bank of Ireland. At December 31, 2014, the Company&rsquo;s foreign loans totaled approximately $50.6 billion, representing approximately 6% of the Company&rsquo;s total consolidated loans outstanding and approximately 3% of the Company&rsquo;s total consolidated assets. The Company classifies loans for financial statement and certain regulatory purposes as foreign primarily based on whether the borrower&rsquo;s primary address is outside the United States. In addition to foreign lending, the Company&rsquo;s international business line, Wells Fargo International Group, focuses on facilitating U.S. customers&rsquo; needs internationally by providing certain financial services globally, including foreign exchange, global payment services, global trade services, and international treasury management.

Resolution Planning Corporate Governance Structure and Processes The Company has developed a strong governance framework with respect to its resolution planning obligations under the Rules. This framework has been informed by its resolution planning experience since the adoption of the Dodd-Frank Act. A resolution planning policy, adopted by the Board of Directors of each of the Parent and WFBNA, sets forth this governance framework. Key participants in the resolution governance structure and processes include the Board of Directors of each of the Parent and WFBNA, committees of the Board of Directors of the Parent, the Company&rsquo;s senior leadership, and all relevant support groups, risk groups and lines of business. Each of these groups has been appropriately engaged in the preparation of the Company&rsquo;s Resolution Plan. The Company has dedicated significant resources and effort to its resolution planning responsibilities. Shortly after the adoption of the Dodd-Frank Act, the Company formed a resolution and recovery executive steering committee (the &ldquo;Steering Committee&rdquo;). The Steering Committee has served as the executive oversight committee with regard to resolution planning initiatives at the Company. The Steering Committee initially consisted of the Company&rsquo;s Chief Risk Officer, Chief Administrative Officer, General Counsel and Treasurer. As part of the Company&rsquo;s ongoing efforts to improve its governance processes for resolution planning, the Company expanded the membership of the Steering Committee in 2014 to include other senior leaders. The Steering Committee currently consists of the following individuals: ï‚¡ Chief Risk Officer ï‚¡ Corporate Treasurer ï‚¡ Head of Wholesale Services ï‚¡ Chief Administrative Officer ï‚¡ Head of Operations ï‚¡ General Counsel ï‚¡ Regional Banking Head of Operations ï‚¡ Head of Enterprise Technology Services ï‚¡ Head of Financial Planning and Analysis ï‚¡ Chief Operational Risk Officer ï‚¡ Head of Wells Fargo Advisors ï‚¡ Head of Mortgage Production ï‚¡ Head of Financial Institutions Investment Banking ï‚¡ Head of Wells Fargo Securities Technology &amp; Operations The Company also has formed a dedicated resolution planning group, the Recovery and Resolution Planning Office (the &ldquo;RRP Office&rdquo;). The RRP Office manages the Company&rsquo;s resolution planning efforts and is the central point of control with respect to the resolution planning governance structure. In addition to coordinating resolution planning efforts throughout the Company, the RRP Office takes strategic direction from the Steering Committee, and ultimately the Boards of Directors of the Parent and WFBNA. The RRP Office reports into the Company&rsquo;s Treasurer. The Company&rsquo;s joint Resolution Plan has been approved by the Boards of Directors of the Parent and WFBNA. Wells Fargo 29\n\n32) Summary of Resolution Plan J. Description of Material Management Information Systems Management Information Systems (&ldquo;MIS&rdquo;) are used throughout the Company to capture and aggregate relevant information and to generate standard and ad hoc reports that are used by the Company to inform decisions regarding day-to-day operations and the overall management of the Company&rsquo;s business. The Company&rsquo;s MIS applications generally take the form of platform and user interfaces with capabilities enabled through data repositories that aggregate and catalogue pertinent data. The Company fully recognizes the importance of MIS to its financial success and stability and the need for robust planning, monitoring, reporting and analytical capabilities. The Company has dedicated significant resources to the development of the necessary MIS infrastructure to operate its business, manage risks and provide necessary financial information to satisfy its internal and external reporting obligations. The Company has established and implemented policies and procedures that govern the information technology control environment. These policies and procedures provide the framework to manage information and cyber security, data integrity, technology implementation and change management, and business continuity of systems and applications. Risk Management All financial institutions must manage a variety of business risks that can significantly affect their financial performance. The Company has an enterprise-wide risk management framework, including strategies, policies, processes and systems used to identify, assess, measure and manage these risks. Among the key risks managed by the Company are operational risks, credit risks, and asset / liability management risks, which include interest rate, market and liquidity and funding risks. MIS applications are critical to providing the necessary data, reports and oversight mechanisms for the prudent management and control of these risks by the Company. Key MIS applications in place for these purposes include systems that provide aggregate counterparty exposures, information regarding credit concentrations and performance, value at risk (VaR) calculations for market risk, simulations to examine interest rate risk, and other analytics. Accounting and Financial and Regulatory Reporting MIS applications are used by accounting teams across the Company and centrally within the Corporate Controller&rsquo;s Division to record transactions, reconcile general ledger balances, ensure the adequacy of financial controls, and to generate information necessary for the preparation of financial statements and SEC and regulatory reports.

Wells Fargo 31\n\n34) Summary of Resolution Plan K. High-level Description of Resolution Strategies The Company has developed resolution strategies under the assumption that a series of events has caused the failure of WFBNA and the Parent. The Resolution Plan is based on the Company&rsquo;s balance sheet as of December 31, 2014 and assumes that the Company is operating under business-as-usual conditions as of that date. The Company then experiences hypothetical idiosyncratic loss events under economic conditions consistent with the severely adverse, adverse and baseline scenarios developed by the FRB for the Company&rsquo;s 2015 CCAR submission. Given that the vast majority of the Company&rsquo;s revenues and profits are generated by, and nearly all of the Company&rsquo;s assets and liabilities are held by, WFBNA, the Resolution Plan focuses on the resolution of WFBNA in an FDIC receivership. None of the resolution strategies described below or in the Resolution Plan itself is binding on a bankruptcy court, the FDIC or any other resolution authority, and in the event of the resolution of the Company, the strategies implemented by the Company, the FDIC or any other resolution authority could differ, possibly materially, from the strategies the Company has described. The proposed failure scenarios and assumptions described in this Public Summary and in the Resolution Plan are hypothetical and do not necessarily reflect an event or events to which the Company is or may become subject . WFBNA The Company&rsquo;s resolution strategy for WFBNA is based on an FDIC receivership process under the FDIA. The FDIC would consider a number of options for resolving WFBNA with the goal of achieving maximum value for the receivership, incurring the least cost to the FDIC&rsquo;s deposit insurance fund, ensuring access to WFBNA&rsquo;s insured deposits within one business day, and limiting contagion and loss of franchise value that might be caused by a lengthy resolution process. In addition, the options considered would be intended to ensure that the Company&rsquo;s critical operations, all of which primarily reside in or are conducted by WFBNA, continue to operate through resolution. None of the Company&rsquo;s critical operations are conducted in a significant way by any of the Company&rsquo;s entities other than WFBNA. The Company has selected a single resolution strategy that the Company believes is the most effective method of resolving WFBNA following its failure (the &ldquo;Preferred Strategy&rdquo;). The Resolution Plan focuses on the Preferred Strategy and provides detail on the specific actions that the Company and the FDIC would take beginning with the occurrence of a series of unrelated material financial events that cause WFBNA to fail through the time when the banking franchise is returned to private ownership at the end of WFBNA&rsquo;s receivership. Under the FDIA, the FDIC can form a bridge bank in connection with the failure of a bank to provide, maintain and operate some or all of the business of the bank during the time between its failure and the time when the FDIC can implement a resolution strategy and return the bank to private ownership. The establishment of a bridge bank can stabilize a bank and continue a bank&rsquo;s day-to-day operations, while the FDIC determines an appropriate resolution strategy. The Preferred Strategy contemplates the establishment of a bridge bank for WFBNA and the movement to the bridge bank of the vast majority of WFBNA&rsquo;s assets and liabilities, consistent with the rights accorded to the FDIC as receiver under the FDIA, and is designed to avoid the need for any extraordinary support Wells Fargo 32\n\n35) Summary of Resolution Plan or systemic-risk determination by the FDIC. The Preferred Strategy further contemplates that the use of a bridge bank for WFBNA would allow all the Company&rsquo;s critical operations, and those core business lines that are conducted at WFBNA, to continue during the resolution period. The establishment by the FDIC of a bridge bank for WFBNA is followed by the divestiture of certain loan portfolios, business lines, and other assets that the Company believes would be desirable to purchasers on a stand-alone basis. These divestitures would be consummated to liquefy and reduce the size of WFBNA&rsquo;s balance sheet to facilitate its resolution. Following and during the consummation of these divestitures, the FDIC would divide the WFBNA franchise into regional segments, all but one of which would be sold to individual purchasers. Each regional segment to be sold would be integrated into its purchaser&rsquo;s platform in a manner to be determined by such purchaser, and customers associated with such regional segment would become customers of its purchaser. The remaining regional segment and the business lines of WFBNA that would not be sold to purchasers on a stand-alone basis would together constitute the &ldquo;Surviving Bank.&rdquo; The Resolution Plan contemplates that the capital position of WFBNA prior to failure, the earnings of the bridge bank during the resolution process, and the proceeds from the regional segment divestitures would leave the bridge bank with sufficient capital to continue operations. To return the Surviving Bank to private ownership, the Resolution Plan contemplates the Surviving Bank commencing a modest initial public offering of common stock, which will help establish a valuation. Once valued, interests in the Surviving Bank could be distributed to creditors and / or additional securities offerings could be executed to complete the return to private ownership. These distributions to creditors or follow-on securities offerings may not be limited to common stock and could include other security types as the FDIC deems appropriate, including debt securities, warrants and / or preferred stock. The bridge bank would continue all core business lines and critical operations of WFBNA until the transition of each of the regional segments to new purchasers and the transition of the Surviving Bank to private ownership are complete. After resolution is completed, the Preferred Strategy contemplates that critical operations and core business lines would be continued in the Surviving Bank and by the purchasers of regional segments, business lines and / or assets. The Surviving Bank would emerge from the receivership as a large regional bank that the Resolution Plan contemplates would be approximately 30% of the size of WFBNA prior to resolution. The Surviving Bank would offer many of the same products and services as WFBNA prior to resolution. Among the products and services offered by the Surviving Bank would be retail checking and savings accounts, payment services, credit cards, residential mortgage lending and servicing, and commercial lending and real estate products. The Surviving Bank would not offer retail brokerage products and services, as WFA LLC and FC LLC are expected to be sold by the Parent in a sale under section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code (a &ldquo;363 Sale&rdquo;), as discussed below. The Company believes that the Preferred Strategy could be completed, under the circumstances assumed in the Resolution Plan, within approximately two years. The Preferred Strategy contemplates that neither capital nor liquidity support from the FDIC would be needed for WFBNA&rsquo;s resolution under the circumstances assumed in the Resolution Plan. Wells Fargo 33\n\n36) Summary of Resolution Plan The Parent Upon a failure, the Parent would be resolved under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code (&ldquo;Chapter 11&rdquo;). The Parent would exit from bankruptcy by means of a plan of reorganization under Chapter 11. Once a Chapter 11 proceeding is commenced, the Parent would sell certain businesses, including WFA LLC and FC LLC, in 363 Sales and seek to reorganize around any remaining businesses. Any residual value or assets remaining with respect to the resolution of WFBNA and the Company&rsquo;s other material entities after the payment of resolution expenses, creditors and other senior claims would become part of the Parent&rsquo;s bankruptcy estate. If there is no set of businesses around which to reorganize as a long-term going concern, the Parent would liquidate by selling (or otherwise disposing of) any remaining assets and arranging for the payment of creditors pursuant to the priorities set forth in the Bankruptcy Code. Once the liquidation was complete, the Parent&rsquo;s existence would be terminated. The Resolution Plan does not contemplate that the Parent would elect to immediately commence a liquidation under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code (rather than a Chapter 11 proceeding) even though such an approach would be possible. A Chapter 11 proceeding is preferred because it would provide the Parent greater flexibility to evaluate strategic alternatives and typically more time to execute a plan than would a liquidation under Chapter 7. Reorganization under Chapter 11 also likely would provide a better opportunity for the Parent to take full advantage of any net operating losses that may be available, even if the Parent subsequently liquidates. The Resolution Plan contemplates that the potential Chapter 11 proceeding would be completed before or at approximately the same time as the completion of WFBNA&rsquo;s receivership. WFS LLC In a resolution scenario, it is most likely that WFS LLC would be liquidated under SIPA. Under SIPA, the Bankruptcy Court would appoint a trustee, requested by the SIPC, to marshal WFS LLC&rsquo;s assets and make distributions to customers and general creditors. If there were no shortfalls in WFC LLC&rsquo;s customer assets, the SIPA trustee would seek to transfer all of WFS LLC&rsquo;s customer accounts as quickly as possible to one or more healthy broker-dealers. If there was a shortfall in the securities held by WFS LLC for any customer, SIPA requires that all customers share proportionally in any shortfalls. Accordingly, to the extent there were shortfalls, the SIPA trustee would liquidate customer assets and distribute the proceeds of liquidation to the customers. Certain sales and trading operations within the Company&rsquo;s Wholesale Banking core business line would also be wound down in WFS LLC&rsquo;s SIPA proceeding. Once the liquidation of WFS LLC under SIPA was complete, WFS LLC would no longer exist. Substantive and procedural protections contained in SIPA would help ensure that customers have access to their accounts or otherwise would receive the value of their accounts as quickly as possible after the commencement of the proceeding. The Resolution Plan contemplates that the distribution of customer funds would occur within three months of the SIPA trustee selecting the appropriate course of action and that the liquidation of all trading assets would occur within six months of WFS LLC&rsquo;s failure. Wells Fargo 34\n\n37) Summary of Resolution Plan WFA LLC and FC LLC The preferred resolution strategy for WFA LLC and FC LLC assumes that no insolvency proceeding is commenced for WFA LLC or FC LLC given the nature of the retail brokerage and securities clearing businesses conducted by the firms. Instead, it is expected that WFA LLC and FC LLC would be sold during the Parent&rsquo;s Chapter 11 proceeding to a single purchaser in a 363 Sale for the benefit of the Parent&rsquo;s bankruptcy estate.17 The operations of WFA LLC and FC LLC would be integrated into the operations of the purchaser, and their customers would become customers of the purchaser. It is likely that the purchaser would cause deposits that currently are swept to WFBNA from WFA LLC client accounts through FC LLC to be swept to customer bank accounts maintained by the purchaser for its own deposit sweep products as promptly as practical after (or at the same time as) the consummation of the 363 Sale. The 363 Sale would be expected to generate significant value for the Parent&rsquo;s bankruptcy estate and substantially preserve the Wealth, Brokerage and Retirement core business line conducted within WFA LLC and FC LLC. The Resolution Plan contemplates that the 363 Sale would be executed within one to four months after the commencement of the Parent&rsquo;s Chapter 11 proceeding. The Resolution Plan also addresses the possibility that WFA LLC and FC LLC could be liquidated under SIPA. That liquidation may take the form of a simple transfer or liquidation of customer accounts or a sale of assets on a piecemeal basis by the SIPA trustee. 17 Wells Fargo 35\n\n38) Conclusion The Resolution Plan provides for the resolution of the Company, in a rapid and orderly way, without posing systemic risk to the larger financial system and without the need for any government or taxpayer support. The resolution options proposed are designed to ensure that key components of the Company&rsquo;s business, including critical operations, would be able to continue during the period immediately following failure, and that customers would have prompt access to their deposits, minimizing customer impact. The Company believes that it has developed an effective and feasible plan for resolution. Wells Fargo 36"
