It enables access to online and mobile banking with mobile deposits including the ability to make online and mobile IRA contributions, access to Zelle℠, Bill Pay, online wires, transfers and direct deposit (i.e., annuity and Social Security payments and payroll deposits).\n\nWith Brokerage Cash Services, deposits to investment accounts can also be made with tellers at Wells Fargo branches. Deposits are processed through an associated limited-purpose Wells Fargo Bank account in your name.\n\nBrokerage Cash Services creates an integrated relationship. It combines investing and financial management resources into an easy-to-manage account. It’s a comprehensive asset management feature that gives you the “big picture” of your finances by connecting your financial world:\n\nYour investment accounts (brokerage, IRAs, trust accounts, etc.)\n\nFinancial management services\n\nIt’s simple. It’s flexible. It’s designed for maximum convenience.\n\nHelping ensure your money is accessible\n\nOur Cash Sweep Program automatically “sweeps” uninvested cash balances into a Cash Sweep Option until such balances are invested or otherwise used to satisfy obligations arising in the account. The available Cash Sweep Options currently offered are:\n\nWells Fargo Advisors Standard Bank Deposit Sweep\n\nWells Fargo Advisors Expanded Bank Deposit Sweep\n\nMoney Market Fund Sweep\n\nEligibility is based on the type of investment account and nature of account ownership. Wells Fargo Advisors reserves the right to change the eligibility criteria for the Cash Sweep Program and Cash Sweep Options.\n\nWith both the Expanded and Standard Bank Deposit Sweep, the more assets you hold with us, the higher your interest rate will typically be for your cash deposited into the Sweep Program. Other benefits include the ability to receive up to $250,000 in Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) insurance per depositor, per insured bank, for each ownership category (single, joint, trust, etc). In the Expanded Bank Deposit Sweep Program, depending on market conditions and/or the size of your account, cash may be swept to only affiliated Banks, to only unaffiliated Banks, or to a mix of both.\n\nAdditional information is contained in the Wells Fargo Advisors Sweep Features Eligibility (PDF) and the Cash Sweep Program Disclosure Statement (PDF).\n\nAll deposits, including certificates of deposit, you maintain at a Program Bank, whether placed directly with the Program Bank or through an intermediary (such as Wells Fargo Advisors or another broker), will be aggregated for purposes of determining your FDIC insurance coverage. Your deposits (including principal and interest) at each Program Bank are eligible for FDIC insurance up to $250,000 per depositor for each ownership category. If your total deposits at a Program Bank exceed the applicable FDIC insurance limit, the amount over the limit will not be insured by the FDIC and you should carefully consider whether to arrange for the direct investment of those amounts. Please note that you, and not Wells Fargo Advisors, are responsible for monitoring the total amount of your deposits at the Program Banks in order to determine the extent of FDIC insurance coverage available.\n\nList of Participating Program Banks in the Bank Deposit Sweep Programs.\n\nPlease see the Cash Sweep Program Disclosure Statement (PDF) for more information on FDIC insurance coverage.\n\nBrokered Liquid Deposit is a cash alternative that is available through your Financial Advisor. Brokered Liquid Deposit can help manage your non-transactional cash needs and provide a competitive yield for eligible Wells Fargo Advisors brokerage accounts. Brokered Liquid Deposit is not an automated “sweep” program. You must instruct your Financial Advisor prior to each deposit or withdrawal.
