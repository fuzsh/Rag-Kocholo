        "text": "Know if your deposits are 100% FDIC-insured.\n\nYou may have questions about your money and how it is insured by the FDIC (Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation). We at Wells Fargo want to make sure that you have access to the tools and resources you need to understand how FDIC insurance works.\n\nWells Fargo Bank, N.A. is a member of the FDIC.\n\nThe FDIC was created in 1933 to provide insurance protection for depositors of failed banks and to help maintain sound conditions in the nation's banking system.\n\nThe FDIC is an independent agency of the U.S. Government. Since its inception, the FDIC has responded to thousands of bank failures. All insured deposits of failed banks and thrifts have been protected by the FDIC.\n\nThe FDIC has launched a tool at http://edie.fdic.gov that is designed to help consumers calculate their insurance coverage and learn about what the rules and limitations of deposit insurance mean for you.\n\nWhat is insured by the FDIC?\n\nWhat amount of insurance coverage do I have for my accounts?\n\nThe FDIC Standard Maximum Deposit Insurance Amount for deposits is $250,000 per depositor, per insured financial institution, for each account ownership category.\n\nCoverage Over Basic Insurance\n\nThe FDIC provides separate insurance coverage for deposit accounts held in different categories of ownership. It is possible to qualify for more than the current $250,000 in coverage at one insured bank if you own deposit accounts in different ownership categories. Examples of different ownership categories include: (1) single, (2) joint, (3) revocable trust (informal revocable trusts such as Payable-on-death accounts and formal revocable trusts such as living/family trusts created for estate planning purposes), (4) irrevocable trusts, (5) certain retirement plans, (6) employee benefit plans, (7) business (corporation, partnership, unincorporated associations), and (8) government.\n\nWhat is not insured by the FDIC?\n\nWhere can I go if I still have questions?"
