        "text": "Big banks are often well-known brands with physical branch locations that provide access to in-person assistance if and when you need it. Some -- such as Chase, Bank of America and Citibank -- even have locations outside the US, which can make banking while traveling internationally a breeze.\n\nThe downside of big banks is that they often charge account fees to maintain your account or if you overdraft. They’re also known to offer paltry savings rates. But big banks have some major advantages, too. In addition to branch access, they often offer a full suite of products from credit cards to mortgages, which can make banking giants worth considering.\n\nThe 15 biggest banks in the US\n\nThere are currently more than 4,500 banks in the country. Here are the 15 biggest ones to choose from, according to the most recent data available from the Federal Reserve.\n\n1. JPMorgan Chase Bank\n\nNew York-based JPMorgan Chase Bank tops the Federal Reserve’s list of largest banks by consolidated assets owned at $3.50 trillion, of which $2.68 trillion represents assets owned domestically.\n\nChase Bank, the consumer banking arm of JPMorgan Chase, has more than 4,700 US branches, over 15,000 domestic ATMs and a slew of international banking branches. Chase Bank serves customers in more than 60 countries, with offices in the Americas, Europe, North Africa and Asia.\n\n2. Bank of America\n\nBank of America, based in Charlotte, North Carolina, serves 69 million retail customers and small-business clients. The company has nearly 3,800 branches -- which it refers to as “retail financial centers” -- and 15,000 ATMs, according to its website. Its digital banking app serves 57 million verified users.\n\n3. Wells Fargo\n\nWells Fargo returned to the third spot on the Fed’s list as of December 2023. It’s had a few rocky years dealing with criminal and civil lawsuits involving fraudulent sales practices, recent investigations into fake hiring practices and consumer backlash about announcements to close lines of credit.\n\nHowever, Wells Fargo remains a banking giant in the US. Headquartered in San Francisco, it has more than 4,400 retail banking locations and more than 12,000 ATMs. The bank says it serves 1 in 3 US households and more than 10% of small businesses in the country.\n\n4. Citibank\n\nCitibank is the retail banking arm of global financial services giant Citigroup. New York-based Citibank serves some 200 million customer accounts in 160 countries. Citibank customers have access to more than 600 branch locations and more than 60,000 additional surcharge-free ATMs. Plus, the bank has ATMs in more than 20 countries.\n\n5. U.S. Bank\n\nComing in fifth with $699.4 billion in consolidated assets, Minneapolis-based U.S. Bank has more than 2,000 bank branches across 26 states. Its banking app allows you to share your location while traveling to avoid banking service interruptions while away from home.\n\n6. PNC Bank\n\nThe result of the largest bank merger of its time, the Pittsburgh National and Provident National banks took their shared initials and formed PNC Bank in 1983. Since then, this Pittsburgh-based bank has focused its operation in the Midwest, Northeast and South.\n\nIn November 2020, PNC agreed to pay $11.6 billion to acquire BBVA USA, a regional bank operating mainly in Southern and Western states. PNC Bank has more than 2,300 branches across the US.\n\n7. Goldman Sachs Bank\n\nSince the 2008 financial crisis, this venerable New York-based multinational investment bank and financial services firm has been rebuilding its brand and has a reported $549.2 billion in consolidated assets.\n\nMarcus by Goldman Sachs, its consumer banking arm that launched in 2016, offers competitive rates on savings and certificate of deposit accounts but doesn’t offer checking or money market accounts. Additionally, Marcus by Goldman Sachs is an online-only operation, so you won’t find an extensive branch or ATM network.\n\n8. Truist Bank\n\nTruist Bank, formed by a merger between BB&T and SunTrust Bank in 2019, operates in 17 states across the southeastern US and the District of Columbia. Charlotte, North Carolina-based Truist has more than 1,900 bank branches and offers customers access to more than 2,900 ATMs.\n\n9. Capital One Bank\n\nCapital One Bank is headquartered in McClean, Virginia, and has 273 branches across six states and the District of Columbia. The majority are located in Louisiana, Maryland, Texas, New York and Virginia.\n\nCapital One Bank may have fewer traditional branches than most other members of this list, but it has a massive network of 70,000 ATMs, a mobile banking app, Capital One Cafes in select cities and competitive rates on savings and CD accounts. Notably, it doesn’t have monthly fees or minimum balance requirements -- a rarity for big banks. The first of the Capital One Lounges opened at the Dallas-Fort Worth airport in 2023.\n\n10. TD Bank\n\nCasting itself as “America’s Most Convenient Bank,” TD Bank, the US-based arm of the Canadian bank TD Bank Group, lands firmly on the list of the largest US banks at No. 10. TD Bank has more than 1,100 branches located along the East Coast from Maine to Florida -- and most of them are open seven days a week (plus some holidays). You can also access nearly 2,600 ATMs through the TD Bank network.\n\n11. Bank of New York Mellon\n\nCommonly referred to as BNY Mellon, this New York-based investment banking services firm was formed when Mellon Financial Corporation merged with the Bank of New York in 2007.\n\nAs a global institution, BNY Mellon operates in 35 countries around the world and primarily focuses on investment services for institutions and high-net-worth clients. It’s the oldest bank in the country and the longest continually running company in New York City. It also has a famous founder: Alexander Hamilton started the bank in 1784.\n\n12. State Street Bank and Trust Company\n\nState Street Bank and Trust Company is a Massachusetts-based investment firm that operates in more than 100 markets globally. With a primary focus on investment management, investment research and trading, this bank hasn’t offered retail banking services or commercial lending since 1999. However, in 2023, the bank opened a new 500,000-square-foot headquarters in Boston to mark its 230-year history of operations there.\n\n13. BMO\n\nFormerly known as BMO Harris, the US subsidiary of the multinational Bank of Montreal shortened its name to BMO in the fall of 2022. After completing the acquisition of Bank of the West in 2023, BMO expanded its US presence and operates 1,000 branches across eight states, along with a network of more than 40,000 BMO and Allpoint ATMs.\n\nIt also launched BMO Alto -- an online-only banking service offering high-yield savings and certificate of deposit accounts -- in April 2023, although customers at BMO Alto cannot use any of BMO’s branch or ATM locations.\n\n14. Citizens Bank\n\nCitizens Bank is a full-service bank that primarily provides retail banking and commercial products for consumers and small businesses in the New England, Mid-Atlantic and Midwest regions of the US.\n\nIn addition to operating 1,030 branches in 14 states, Citizens Bank has an online-only division, Citizens Access, which has offered services since 2018 and appears on our list of the best high-yield savings accounts available. To expand its geographic footprint, Citizens Bank acquired Investors Bancorp and HSBC’s East Coast branches and national online deposit business in 2022.\n\n15. First Citizens Bank\n\nRaleigh, North Carolina-based First Citizens Bank is a growing player in the banking industry with a 125-year history that offers personal, business and commercial banking and wealth management services. Its merger with CIT Bank in 2022 provided a foothold in the online banking arena. Customers can visit more than 500 branches across 23 states, although the vast majority of retail locations are in North Carolina and South Carolina."
