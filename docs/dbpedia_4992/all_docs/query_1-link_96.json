        "text": "WyomingLLCAttorney.com Blog\n\nIn terms of finance, assets are anything that a bank owns and can include cash in checking or savings accounts, securities, and loans that generate interest like mortgages and personal loans. The largest and best banks in America have trillions of dollars in assets. While some of the biggest banks in the world are located in China, the United States is home to many large banks.\n\nThe team at Wyoming LLC Attorney looked at data from the Federal Reserve to visualize the 30 largest banks in the United States based on the value to total assets at the end of 2022 – including major banks that have since failed according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). See what banks are on the list.\n\nClick the image to expand\n\nFailed Bank Update: On May 1, 2023, First Republic Bank permanently closed and all of its assets were seized and auctioned off by the FDIC. JPMorgan Chase won the auction and purchased the majority of First Republic Bank’s assets for $10.6 billion.\n\nWhat Are the Largest Banks in the U.S.?\n\nAccording to the Federal Reserve, Chase Bank is the biggest bank in the United States in terms of assets. As of December 31, 2022, the financial institution has $3,201,942,000,000 in assets. The bank has nearly 5,000 branches around the world in more 100 countries. Chase’s holding company is JPMorgan Chase & Co., which is a multinational financial services company headquartered in New York City. One of its predecessors is the Bank of the Manhattan Company, which was founded in 1799.\n\nThe second bank on the list is Bank of America, with $2,418,508,000,000 in assets. Bank of America, which has its headquarters in Charlotte, NC, it was founded in 1998 with the merger of BankAmerica and NationsBank. Bank of America has nearly 4,000 locations in more than 40 countries. In addition to being the second-largest bank in the United States, it is also the second-largest bank in the world by market capitalization.\n\nCitibank is the third-largest bank in America, with $1,766,752,000,000 in assets. It was originally founded in 1812 as the City Bank of New York. Their headquarters is located in New York City. Citibank offers a number of financial services including standard banking services, mortgages, personal loans, commercial banking, and more.\n\nComing in fourth is Wells Fargo Bank. This institution has $1,717,531,000,000 in assets as of December 2022. Headquartered in San Francisco, Well Fargo was originally founded in Minneapolis in 1929 as Northwest Bancorporation. There are more than 4,000 Wells Fargo bank locations around the world\n\nTogether, Chase, Bank of America, Citibank, and Wells Fargo make up the “Big Four” banking institutions of the United States and are some of the largest banks in the world.\n\nWhich of America’s Largest Banks of 2022 Have Already Failed?\n\nThe Federal Reserve released their latest report on large commercial banks in December 2022, but some of the top banks on the list have already failed.\n\nSilicon Valley Bank was the 16th largest bank in the United States at the end of 2022, with more than $200 billion in assets. It was founded in 1983 with headquarters in Santa Clara, CA. In March 2023, amid high inflation around the world, there was a run on the bank, and the excessive withdrawals with insufficient liquidity led to the bank’s collapse. It is the second-largest bank failure in U.S. history.\n\nSignature Bank, which is at the 29th spot on the list of largest banks in America, had $110 billion in assets as of December 2022. The company was founded in 2001 and had its headquarters in New York City. For most of its existence, it was focused on wealthy clients in the New York City area. Signature Bank got into the cryptocurrency industry in 2018, which made up a good percentage of its deposits. In March 2023, federal regulators expressed concern about depositors withdrawing significant amounts of money from the bank and feared a similar outcome as Silicon Valley Bank. The New York State Department of Financial Services took over the bank on March 12 and named the FDIC as the receiver.\n\nThe collapse of Signature Bank is the third-largest bank failure in U.S. history. “Too big to fail” is a theory that certain financial institutions are so large and critical that their collapse would be detrimental to the economy. When facing failure, they must be supported or bailed out by the government in order to avoid danger to the economy.\n\nFor individuals, an asset protection trust can help to protect your assets without losing control of them. Assets that can be protected include bank accounts, real estate, intellectual property, and more.\n\nThe Largest Banks in the United States Ranked by Assets\n\nRankBank NameHolding CompanyTotal Assets in Millions USDTotal Branches (Domestic and Foreign)1Chase BankJPMorgan Chase & Co.$3,201,9424,8242Bank of AmericaBank of America Corporation$2,418,5083,8433CitibankCitigroup$1,766,7528054Wells Fargo BankWells Fargo & Company$1,717,5314,6805U.S. BankU.S. Bancorp$585,1362,2376PNC BankThe PNC Financial Services Group$552,3072,6187Truist BankTruist Financial Corporation$546,2282,1238Goldman Sachs Bank USAThe Goldman Sachs Group$486,96769Capital OneCapital One Financial Corporation$453,31329310TD BankTD Group US Holdings$386,7991,16311BNY MellonThe Bank of New York Mellon Corporation$324,6461712State Street Bank and Trust CompanyState Street Corporation$298,0201213Citizens BankCitizens Financial Group$226,4021,14614First Republic Bank (failed May 1, 2023)$212,6397215Morgan Stanley Private BankMorgan Stanley$209,664416Silicon Valley Bank (failed March 10, 2023)SVB Financial Group$209,0261717Fifth Third BankFifth Third Bancorp$206,2891,10518Morgan Stanley BankMorgan Stanley$201,363119M&T BankM&T Bank Corporation$200,2631,04420KeyBankKeyCorp$187,59099121Huntington National BankHuntington Bancshares$182,3261,10522Ally BankAlly Financial$181,890023BMO Harris BankBMO Financial Corporation$176,98050324HSBC Bank USAHSBC North America Holdings$162,4372425American Express National BankAmerican Express Company$155,378026Northern TrustNorthern Trust Corporation$154,5236027Regions BankRegions Financial Corporation$154,2031,28628Discover BankDiscover Financial Services$129,386029Signature Bank (failed March 12, 2023)$110,364730First Citizens BankFirst Citizens BancShares$109,180548"
