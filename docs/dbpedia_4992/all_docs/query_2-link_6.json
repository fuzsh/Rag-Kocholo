        "text": "Invest in mutual funds the easy way\n\nWhether you prefer managing your own investment portfolio online or receiving the helpful support of an investment professional, Wells Fargo can help make it easier to invest in mutual funds.\n\nIf you prefer to work independently, open a WellsTrade® online and mobile brokerage account to invest in mutual funds, as well as stocks, ETFs, and options.\n\nTake advantage of these helpful tools and resources from Wells Fargo Advisors.\n\nMutual Fund Screener\n\nUse the Mutual Fund Screener to narrow down the thousands of available mutual funds to a manageable list that meets your criteria. Screening criteria include returns, Morningstar ratings, expenses, asset class/category, and more.\n\nMutual Fund Screener\n\nWellsTrade Mutual Fund Screened List\n\nView a list of mutual funds, pre-screened based on objective criteria to help make selecting easier. The list is updated quarterly, and the funds are available for purchase with a WellsTrade brokerage account. Funds available through WellsTrade may not be available through Wells Fargo Advisors.\n\nWork with a Financial Advisor\n\nOur full-service brokerage, Wells Fargo Advisors, offers you the helpful support of an investment professional in person or by phone. Funds available through Wells Fargo Advisors may not be available through WellsTrade.\n\nRequest a Consultation\n\nWhat is a mutual fund?\n\nA mutual fund is an investment company that pools money from many investors and invests the combined holdings in a single portfolio of securities including stocks, bonds, other securities or assets or some combination of these investments. It is professionally managed according to stated investment objectives found in the fund’s prospectus.\n\nMost mutual funds are managed by investment advisers who are registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission. It is the fund's manager who is responsible for selecting the fund's investments in an effort to meet the fund's objectives and implement its strategies.\n\nToday, a wide variety of mutual funds are available and many funds are increasingly complex or specialized or employ complicated investment strategies, including hedging and leveraging through short selling and derivatives and might invest in assets such as global real estate, commodities, leveraged loans, start-up companies and unlisted securities.\n\nIt is important to have a complete understanding of the investment strategies and underlying products to understand the mutual fund’s value to associated risks. For example, the level and type of risk associated with mutual funds may vary significantly from one fund to another. Complex funds in particular are subject to a number of risks, including increased volatility and greater potential for loss, and are not appropriate for all investors. Before investing in any mutual fund, you should read about these risks, which are explained in detail in each mutual fund’s prospectus, and discuss your investment goals and objectives with your Financial Advisor.\n\nBecause each fund pursues its own unique investment objectives, each fund has its own set of specific risks. There is no assurance any Fund will achieve its investment objective. All investing involves risk including the possible loss of principal. Investments fluctuate with changes in market conditions due to numerous factors some of which may be unpredictable.\n\nOptions involve risk and are not appropriate for all investors. Before opening an option position, a person must receive a copy of “Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options.” This is available from the Options Clearing Corporation or any listed options exchange. You should read it carefully before investing.\n\nInvestment and Insurance Products are:\n\nNot Insured by the FDIC or Any Federal Government Agency\n\nNot a Deposit or Other Obligation of, or Guaranteed by, the Bank or Any Bank Affiliate\n\nSubject to Investment Risks, Including Possible Loss of the Principal Amount Invested\n\nInvestment products and services are offered through Wells Fargo Advisors. Wells Fargo Advisors is a trade name used by Wells Fargo Clearing Services, LLC (WFCS) and Wells Fargo Advisors Financial Network, LLC, Members SIPC, separate registered broker-dealers and non-bank affiliates of Wells Fargo & Company.\n\nWellsTrade® and Intuitive Investor® accounts are offered through WFCS.\n\nPM-04022025-5990428.1.1\n\nLRC-1023"
