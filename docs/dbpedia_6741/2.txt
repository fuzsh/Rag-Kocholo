History[]

The 254th Combat Communications Group was originally organized as a Group Headquarters in June 1971 under the name 254th Mobile Communications Group. The unit was co-located with the 221st Mobile Communications Squadron and consisted of assigned units in Texas, Arkansas, Louisiana, and Mississippi. The unit was later re-designated the 254th Combat Information Systems Group in July 1985. A year later in October 1986 it was re-designated the 254th Combat Communications Group. The Group has deployed its personnel and equipment to all corners of the United States and around the world. It has provided direct support to federal operations by deploying personnel to Iraq, Afghanistan, and Kuwait. The 254th has also supported recovery operations for Hurricane Katrina, Hurricane Rita, Hurricane Ike, and Hurricane Gustov, among others. The Group was also instrumental in supporting space shuttle launches in conjunction with Operation Noble Eagle and moving the 624th Operations Center from Barksdale Air Force Base to Lackland Air Force Base.
