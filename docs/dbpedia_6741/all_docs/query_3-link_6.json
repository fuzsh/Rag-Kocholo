If activated to federal service, the group is gained by Air Combat Command.\n\nMission\n\n[edit]\n\nFederal mission\n\n[edit]\n\nThe 254th Combat Communications Group provides a full spectrum of communications capabilities to include planning, engineering, command level coordination, and a wide array of tactical communications solutions to the combatant command or joint task force. The 254th also provides functional advocacy and leadership to eight aligned units spanning seven states. Upon mobilization, Air Force Space Command will assume operational command of the 254 CCG and direct deployment of the Group.[1]\n\nState mission\n\n[edit]\n\nThe 254th Combat Communications Group's state mission is to provide ready forces to the state of Texas during local or statewide emergencies to protect life and property, and to preserve peace, order, and public safety. The 254 CCG also provides the Adjutant General with voice and data capabilities in austere environments.[1]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nThe 254th Combat Communications Group was originally organized as a Group Headquarters in June 1971 under the name 254th Mobile Communications Group. The unit was co-located with the 221st Mobile Communications Squadron and consisted of assigned units in Texas, Arkansas, Louisiana, and Mississippi.\n\nThe unit was later re-designated the 254th Combat Information Systems Group in July 1985. A year later in October 1986 it was re-designated the 254th Combat Communications Group. The Group has deployed its personnel and equipment to all corners of the United States and around the world. It has provided direct support to federal operations by deploying personnel to Iraq, Afghanistan, and Kuwait. The 254th has also supported recovery operations for Hurricane Katrina, Hurricane Rita, Hurricane Gustav, Hurricane Ike, and Hurricane Harvey, among others. The Group was instrumental in supporting Space Shuttle launches in conjunction with Operation Noble Eagle and moving the 624th Operations Center from Barksdale Air Force Base to Joint Base San Antonio. More recently, the group and its aligned squadrons supported United States Air Forces in Europe in multiple exercises as part of the European Reassurance Initiative.\n\nAssignments\n\n[edit]\n\nMajor Command/Gaining Command\n\n[edit]\n\nAir National Guard/Air Combat Command (2018 – present)\n\nAir National Guard/Air Force Space Command (2008 – 2018)\n\nAir National Guard/Air Combat Command (1992 – 2008)\n\nAir National Guard/Tactical Air Command (1971 – 1992)\n\nPrevious designations\n\n[edit]\n\n254th Combat Communications Group (Oct 1986 – present)\n\n254th Combat Information Systems Group (Jul 1985 – Oct 1986)\n\n254th Mobile Communications Group (Jun 1971 – Jul 1985)\n\nSquadrons assigned\n\n[edit]\n\n147th Combat Communications Squadron – San Diego, California\n\n221st Combat Communications Squadron – Dallas, Texas\n\n236th Combat Communications Squadron – Hammond, Louisiana\n\n239th Combat Communications Squadron – St. Louis, Missouri\n\n242d Combat Communications Squadron – Spokane, Washington\n\n264th Combat Communications Squadron – Peoria, Illinois\n\n291st Combat Communications Squadron – Hilo, Hawaii\n\n292d Combat Communications Squadron – Kahului, Hawaii\n\nSquadrons previously assigned\n\n[edit]\n\n205th Engineering Installation Squadron – Oklahoma City, Oklahoma\n\n214th Engineering Installation Squadron New Orleans, Louisiana\n\n219th Engineering Installation Squadron – Tulsa, Oklahoma\n\n223rd Combat Communications Squadron – Hot Springs, Arkansas\n\n232d Combat Communications Squadron – Montgomery, Alabama\n\n248th Air Traffic Control Squadron – Meridian, Mississippi\n\n259th Air Traffic Control Squadron – Alexandria, Louisiana\n\n285th Combat Communications Squadron – Saint Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands\n\n293rd Combat Communications Squadron – Hickam AFB, Hawaii\n\nBases stationed\n\n[edit]\n\nHensley Field, Texas (2010–present)\n\nGarland, Texas (1971–2010)\n\nCommander\n\n[edit]\n\nColonel Eric G.
