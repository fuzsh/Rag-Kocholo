        "text": "Since World War II, reservists have been involuntarily ordered to active duty for military operations nine times: during the Korean War (1950-1953), the Berlin Crisis (1961-62), the Cuban Missile Crisis (1962), the Vietnam War (1968-1969), the Persian Gulf War (1990-91), the intervention in Haiti (1994-1996), the Bosnian peacekeeping mission (1995-present), the Iraqi conflict (1998- present), and the Kosovo conflict and peacekeeping mission (1999-present). This report provides a summary of the circumstances surrounding the activation, the statutory authority used to activate the reservists, the dates of activation, the number of reservists activated, and the number and types of units activated. Reservists have also volunteered to serve on active duty during the above mentioned operations, and many other operations. Additionally, reservists -- especially those in the National Guard -- have often been involuntarily activated to respond to domestic disturbances (i.e., riots and natural disasters) and to execute the laws of the land (notably with respect to desegregation). Furthermore, many reservists have participated in training exercises or operational missions as part of their two- week long annual training requirement. However, this report does not include any data on these activities; its focus is exclusively on involuntary activations of reservists for military operations."
