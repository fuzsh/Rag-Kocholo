On 1 October 1948 active AACS Squadrons were renumbered starting at 1900 when USAF required Major Command controlled units to have four digits contained within blocks of numbers allotted to the commands. AACS Squadrons active on 1 June 1961 were redesignated as communications squadrons. Those squadrons numbered in the 1200s were renumbered in the 2100s retaining the last two digits of their AACS number.\n\nSquadron Emblem Location Note 101st AACS Squadron March AFB, CA Jun-Oct 1948.
