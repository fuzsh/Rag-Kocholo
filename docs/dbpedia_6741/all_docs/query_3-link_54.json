This report provides a summary of the\n\ncircumstances surrounding the activation, the statutory authority used to activate the\n\nreservists, the dates of activation, the number of reservists activated, and the number and\n\ntypes of units activated.\n\nReservists have also volunteered to serve on active duty during the above mentioned\n\noperations, and many other operations. Additionally, reservists â especially those in the\n\nNational Guard â have often been involuntarily activated to respond to domestic\n\ndisturbances (i.e., riots and natural disasters) and to execute the laws of the land (notably\n\nwith respect to desegregation). Furthermore, many reservists have participated in training\n\nexercises or operational missions as part of their two-week long annual training\n\nrequirement.

During that time, reservists\n\nhave been involuntarily ordered to active duty for military operations nine times: during the\n\nKorean War (1950-1953), the Berlin Crisis (1961-62), the Cuban Missile Crisis (1962),\n\nthe Vietnam War (1968-1969), the Persian Gulf War (1990-91), the intervention in Haiti\n\n(1994-1996), the Bosnian peacekeeping mission (1995-present), the conflict with Iraq\n\n(1998-present), and the Kosovo conflict and peacekeeping mission (1999-present). This\n\nreport provides a summary of the circumstances surrounding the activation, the statutory\n\nauthority used to activate the reservists, the dates of activation, the number of reservists\n\nactivated, and the number and types of units activated.\n\nReservists have also volunteered to serve on active duty during the above mentioned\n\noperations, and many other operations. Additionally, reservists â especially those in the\n\nNational Guard â have often been involuntarily activated to respond to domestic\n\ndisturbances (i.e., riots and natural disasters) and to execute the laws of the land (notably\n\nwith respect to desegregation of schools in the South). Furthermore, many reservists have\n\nparticipated in training exercises or operational missions as a part of their two-week long\n\nannual training requirement. However, this report does not include any data on these\n\nactivities; its focus is exclusively on involuntary activations of reservists for military\n\noperations.\n\nFormat\n\nThere is a separate section for each of the nine involuntary activations. Within each\n\nsection, there is a brief description of the circumstances surrounding the activation, the\n\nstatutory authority used to activate the reservists, the date on which involuntarily activated\n\nreservists began to enter active duty, and the date when the last involuntarily activated\n\nreservists were released from active duty. This is followed by a table which lists the\n\nnumber of reservists who were involuntarily activated, along with the number and types of\n\nreserve units activated. The data are broken down by the seven individual reserve\n\ncomponents â Army Reserve, Army National Guard, Naval Reserve, Air Force Reserve,\n\nAir National Guard, Marine Corps Reserve, and Coast Guard Reserve. A figure for the\n\ncombined number of involuntarily activated reservists is also provided.\n\nCRS-2\n\nData Sources\n\nA wide variety of sources were used to compile the tables in this report. Open\n\nsources were the principal sources used to construct the commentary and tables for the\n\nKorean War, the Berlin Crisis, and the Cuban Missile Crisis activations. For subsequent\n\nactivations, open source data were combined with official data provided by the\n\nDepartment of Defense and the various military services to construct the commentary and\n\ntables.\n\nCaveats\n\nThe statistics in this report are subject to revision based on additional research in\n\nprimary sources or the availability of more comprehensive data. It should also be noted\n\nthat the data in this report may not precisely match that found in earlier press and\n\njournalistic accounts, which may have been based on expectations or less complete\n\ninformation. Additionally, the data presented on units activated must be interpreted very\n\ncautiously.\n\nProviding data on units activated was exceptionally problematic for two reasons.\n\nFirst, when activating a unit, the services often did not activate the entire unit. For\n\nexample, the historical record may have shown that the Air Force activated a reserve\n\nfighter wing, yet it was rarely clear which (if any) of that wingâs subordinate elements were\n\nactivated with it. Thus, the indication in this report that a given unit was activated should\n\nnot be taken to mean that the unit was activated in its entirety. The unit may have been\n\nactivated in its entirety, or it may have been activated with only some of its subordinate\n\nunits, or it may have had only its headquarters section activated.\n\nThe difficulty of determining the precise composition of activated units leads to the\n\nsecond problem with the unit data: the double counting of units. For example, the historical\n\nrecord may have shown that during a given activation, the Army activated a reserve\n\ninfantry battalion and four reserve infantry companies. As an infantry battalion normally\n\nhas four to five infantry companies assigned underneath it, one might suspect that those\n\ninfantry companies were really subordinate units of the infantry battalion. However, absent\n\nclear evidence that those infantry companies were indeed subordinate units of the infantry\n\nbattalion, this report lists the activation of both the battalion and the companies. This\n\nmethodology creates a high probability that units are âcountedâ twice; however, it also\n\nminimizes the likelihood that units are not counted.\n\nTwo final caveats are in order with respect to the data contained in the tables. First,\n\nin addition to activating units, the various military services often activated individual\n\nreservists who were not part of a unit or selectively activated individual reservists within\n\na unit. Thus, there is not necessarily a correlation between the units activated and the\n\nnumber of reservists activated. Second, for three of the activations mentioned here (the\n\nBosnian peacekeeping mission, the Iraqi Crisis, and the Kosovo conflict and peacekeeping\n\nmission), reservists are still being ordered to active duty. The personnel and unit data\n\npresented for these three operations is current as of February 3, 2000, but will change\n\nover time. This report will be updated periodically to reflect those and other changes.\n\nCRS-3\n\nThe Korean War: Background\n\nOn June 25, 1950, the North Korean Army launched a massive invasion of South\n\nKorea. Shortly thereafter, President Truman authorized General Douglas MacArthur,\n\nCommander-in-Chief of the U.S. Far East Command, to commit U.S. forces to the\n\ndefense of South Korea. Under Public Law 81-599, Truman had the authority to order\n\nunits and individual members of the Organized Reserve Corps and units of the National\n\nGuard of the United States into active federal service for up to 21 months (later extended\n\nto 24 months). On July 19, Truman notified Congress that he had exercised this authority.1\n\nReservists began to enter active duty on July 31, 1950.2 An armistice agreement was\n\nsigned on July 27, 1953, and a cease fire went into effect on that day. With the exception\n\nof those reservists who voluntarily chose to stay on active duty, all involuntarily activated\n\nreservists had been released from active duty by December 1, 1953.3\n\n1 Harry S.

Since the end of World War II,\n\nBerlin had remained under control of the four Allied powers (Britain, France, the Soviet\n\nUnion, and the United States). Berlin, however, was located entirely within East Germany,\n\nwhich was controlled by the Soviets. In 1958, Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev called\n\nfor the termination of British, French, and U.S. occupation rights in Berlin, although none\n\nof these nations complied. On June 3, 1961, Khrushchev met with President Kennedy\n\nand declared that the status of Berlin would be resolved during 1961 with or without the\n\ncooperation of the United States. Tensions mounted in the following weeks. On July 26,\n\nKennedy asked Congress for authority to order up to 250,000 reservists to active duty.\n\nCongress responded with the passage of Public Law 87-117, which was enacted on\n\nAugust 1. The law gave the president authority to call up to 250,000 reservists to active\n\nduty for a period not to exceed twelve months. On August 13, communist forces began\n\nconstruction of the Berlin Wall in order to seal off West Berlin. On August 25, Kennedy\n\nauthorized the activation of certain reserve units, which began entering active duty on\n\nSeptember 25. Individual reservists were also activated as âfillersâ for undermanned units.\n\nA stalemate of sorts was reached: the autonomy of West Berlin was preserved, but the city\n\nwas sealed off from East Berlin and East Germany by the Berlin Wall. With the exception\n\nof those reservists who voluntarily chose to stay on active duty, all involuntarily activated\n\nreservists were released from active duty by August 31, 1962.\n\nCRS-7\n\nThe Berlin Crisis: Personnel and Units Activated\n\nComponent\n\nPersonnel\n\nUnits\n\n1 Training Division, 10 Engineer Battalions, 4\n\nArtillery Battalions, 2 Logistics Commands, 2\n\nArmy Reserve\n\n69,263a\n\nSecurity Battalions, 1 Military Police Battalion and\n\n273 company sized or smaller units.b\n\n1 Armored Division, 1 Infantry Division, 1 Armored\n\nCavalry Regiment, 8 Artillery Battalions, 7 Signal\n\nArmy National\n\n44,091c\n\nBattalions, 5 Engineer Battalions, 4 Armor Battalions,\n\nGuard\n\n3 Military Police Battalions and 114 company sized\n\nor smaller units.d\n\nCrew for 40 Naval Reserve Destroyers and\n\nNaval Reserve\n\n8,000e\n\nDestroyer Escorts; 18 Anti-Submarine Warfare\n\nNaval Air Squadrons. f\n\nAir Force\n\n5,613g\n\n2 Troop Carrier Wings.h\n\nReserve\n\n5 Tactical Fighter Wings, 2 Air Transport Wings, 1\n\nAir National\n\n21,067i\n\nTactical Reconnaissance Wing, 1 Air Base Group, 6\n\nGuard\n\nAircraft Control and Warning Squadrons.j\n\nMarine Corps\n\n0\n\nNone.\n\nReserve\n\nCoast Guard\n\n0\n\nNone.\n\nReserve\n\nTotal Personnel\n\n148,034\n\na Compiled from unpublished data provided to CRS in 1973 by the various services and reserve\n\ncomponents to respond to a congressional inquiry; material in CRS analystâs files.\n\nb Compiled from unpublished data provided to CRS in 1973 by the various services and reserve\n\ncomponents to respond to a congressional inquiry; material in CRS analystâs files.\n\nc Compiled from unpublished data provid ed to CRS in 1973 by the various services and reserve\n\ncomponents to respond to a congressional inquiry; material in CRS analystâs files.\n\nd Compiled from unpublished data provided to CRS in 1973 by the various services and reserve\n\ncomponents to respond to a congressional inquiry; material in CRS analystâs files.\n\ne William R.

Public Law 87-736 was\n\nenacted on October 3, authorizing the President to mobilize any unit or member of the\n\nReady Reserve for up to twelve consecutive months, provided that no more than 150,000\n\nreservists were involuntarily serving under this authority at any given time. On October 16,\n\nPresident Kennedy reviewed photographs which indicated that offensive missiles were\n\nbeing installed in Cuba. At the direction of the President, a naval quarantine of Cuba\n\nbegan on October 24. On the evening of October 27, President Kennedy ordered the\n\nmobilization of certain Air Force Reserve units to support possible ground, air, or naval\n\naction against Cuba. These units and their personnel entered active duty on the morning\n\nof October 28.4 Later that day Soviet Premier Khrushchev told President Kennedy that\n\nhe would remove the missiles and accept U.N. verification of the removal. With the\n\nexception of those reservists who voluntarily chose to stay on active duty, all involuntarily\n\nactivated reservists were released from active duty by November 28, 1962.5\n\nThe Cuban Missile Crisis: Personnel and Units Activated\n\nComponent\n\nPersonnel\n\nUnits\n\nArmy Reserve\n\n0\n\nNone.\n\nArmy National\n\n0\n\nNone.\n\nGuard\n\nNaval Reserve\n\n0\n\nNone.\n\nAir Force\n\n8 Troop Carrier Wings and 6 Aerial Port\n\n14,200a\n\nReserve\n\nSquadrons.b\n\nAir National\n\n0\n\nNone.\n\nGuard\n\nMarine Corps\n\n0\n\nNone.\n\nReserve\n\nCoast Guard\n\n0\n\nNone.\n\nReserve\n\nTotal Personnel\n\n14,200\n\na Cantwell, 191.\n\nb Cantwell, 189.\n\n4 Cantwell, 189.\n\n5 Cantwell, 191.\n\nCRS-9\n\nThe Vietnam War: Background\n\nFrom 1961 to 1973, U.S. forces were directly involved in military operations to\n\nsuppress the Viet Cong communist insurgency in South Vietnam and to repel the infiltration\n\nof soldiers from communist North Vietnam. The principal purpose of this involvement was\n\nto prevent the spread of communism to South Vietnam and neighboring states such as\n\nCambodia and Laos. Between 1964 and 1973 â the peak years of U.S. military\n\ninvolvement â about 3.4 million members of the U.S. armed forces served in the Southeast\n\nAsia Theater.6 Despite this substantial military involvement in Vietnam, only two minor\n\nreserve activations occurred, both in 1968.7 These activations were carried out by\n\nPresident Lyndon B. Johnson under the authority granted to him by a provision in PL 89-\n\n687, the FY 1967 defense appropriations bill. The provision allowed the president to call\n\nto active duty, without declaring a state of emergency, any organized unit of the Ready\n\nReserve and certain individual members of the Ready Reserve.8 The first reserve\n\nactivation, announced on January 25, 1968, was not directly related to the war in Vietnam.\n\nRather, it was a response to the capture of the U.S. Navy intelligence ship Pueblo by\n\nNorth Korea and the subsequent reinforcement of U.S. forces in South Korea. Most of\n\nthe units activated remained in the United States or were deployed to Korea, but some\n\nwere stationed in Vietnam.9 These units entered active duty on January 26, 1968, and the\n\nlast units were released from active duty on June 18, 1969. The second reserve activation\n\nwas announced on April 11, 1968 â just two months after the Tet Offensive in South\n\nVietnam â and was intended âto meet the needs of the Vietnam war and strengthen the\n\ndepleted Active Strategic Reserve.â10 These reservists began to enter active duty on May\n\n13, 1968. With the exception of those who voluntarily chose to stay on active duty, all of\n\nthem were released by December of 1969.\n\n6 Harry G. Summers. Vietnam War Almanac. Facts On File, New York, 1985, 351. The\n\nSoutheast Asia Theater is defined as Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia, as well asa flight crews\n\nbased in Thailand and sailors in the South China Sea.\n\n7 Although the reason for this is not entirely clear, one study suggested that Johnson resisted\n\nactivating the reserves because it would have undermined his attempts to portray Vietnam\n\nas âa limited war of short duration which could be fought with little domestic dislocation....â\n\nLawrence M.

In response, the United States led a multi-national coalition to protect\n\nthe neighboring nation of Saudi Arabia (Operation Desert Shield) and, subsequently, to\n\nexpel Iraq from Kuwait (Operation Desert Storm). The buildup of U.S. forces in the\n\nregion necessitated the largest call-up of reservists since the Korean War. On August 22,\n\ninvoking the authority granted to him by Title 10, Section 673(b) of the United States\n\nCode, President George Bush authorized the Secretary of Defense âto order to active duty\n\nunits, and individuals not assigned to units, of the Selected Reserve.â11 This activation\n\nauthority allowed the president to order members of the Selected Reserve12 to active duty,\n\nbut with certain restrictions: Each reservist could only be activated for up to 90 days, with\n\na possible 90 day extension, and the total number of reservists on active duty at any given\n\ntime could not exceed 200,000. The first calls to active duty were announced two days\n\nlater, on August 24, and the affected reservists began to enter active duty on August 27,\n\n1990.13 On November 13, 1990, Bush authorized the Department of Defense to\n\nimplement the tour extension provision, thereby allowing activated reservists to serve on\n\nactive duty for up to 180 days.14 Finally, on January 18, 1991, the day after the air war\n\nagainst Iraq began, Bush invoked his authority under Title 10, Section 673 of the United\n\nStates Code, âto order any unit, and any member not assigned to a unit organized to serve\n\nas a unit, in the Ready Reserve to active duty...for not more than 24 consecutive\n\nmonths....â15 Section 673 differed from Section 673(b) in three important ways: it\n\npermitted the activation of members of the Ready Reserve,16 not just members of the\n\nSelected Reserve; it allowed up to 1,000,000 reservists to serve on active duty at any one\n\n11 President George Bush, Executive Order 12727, August 22, 1990.

The Selected Reserve contains those units and individuals\n\nmost essential to wartime missions. Selected Reservists are generally required to perform\n\none weekend of training each month and two weeks of training every year. The Individual\n\nReady Reserve is a manpower pool of trained individuals who generally have served\n\npreviously on active duty or in the Selected Reserve. They are not required to participate\n\nin training as reservists in the Selected Reserve are, although they may voluntarily choose\n\nto do so. The Inactive National Guard is made up of members of the National Guard in an\n\ninactive status. They are not required to participate in training as National Guardsmen in the\n\nSelected Reserve are; however, they are assigned to a National Guard unit and are required\n\nto muster with the unit once a year.\n\nCRS-12\n\ntime, as opposed to 200,000; and it allowed the federal government to keep the reservists\n\non active duty for up to 24 consecutive months, rather than just 180 days.

Eight months after\n\nbeing sworn in, he was overthrown in a military coup led by Lieutenant General Raoul\n\nCedras, who then assumed control of the Haitian government. In July, 1994, the United\n\nNations approved a resolution authorizing the use of all necessary means, including force,\n\nto restore Aristide to power. On September 15, 1994, President Clinton announced that\n\nthe United States would lead a multi-national military coalition to depose Cedras, restore\n\nAristide, and supervise new elections in 1995.18\n\nEarlier that same day, invoking the authority granted to him by Title 10, Section\n\n673(b), Clinton authorized the Secretary of Defense âto order to active duty units, and\n\nindividuals not assigned to units, of the Selected Reserve.â19 This authority allowed the\n\npresident to order members of the Selected Reserve to active duty, but with certain\n\nrestrictions: Each reservist could only be activated for up to 90 days, with a possible 90\n\nday extension, and the total number of reservists on active duty at any given time could not\n\nexceed 200,000. Under this call-up, reservists began to enter active duty on September\n\n20, 1994.\n\nIn the face of an imminent U.S. invasion, Cedras agreed to cede power. On\n\nSeptember 19, 1994, U.S. military personnel began to occupy Haiti to assist with the\n\nrestoration of the Aristide government and to help prepare the nation for new elections.\n\nOn October 5, 1994, Congress extended the duration of involuntary active duty under 10\n\nU.S.C. 673(b) to a single period of 270 days. This extension applied to all reservists\n\ncalled up under this authority, even those who had been activated before the law was\n\nenacted. With the exception of those who chose to stay on active duty voluntarily, all\n\ninvoluntarily activated reservists were released from active duty by May 1, 1996.\n\n18 Congressional Quarterly, âClinton Offers Justification for Invasion of Haiti,â September\n\n17, 1995, 2605.\n\n19 President William Jefferson Clinton, Executive Order 12927, September 15, 1994.

The United States has used this military force to compel Iraqi compliance\n\nwith the terms of the cease fire agreements on a number of occasions from 1991 to the\n\npresent.21 One of the most significant U.S. confrontations with Iraq began in late 1997,\n\nin response to Iraqi interference in the conduct of U.N. weapons inspections. As tensions\n\nwith Iraq mounted, the United States began to build up its forces in the Gulf region. Since\n\nthen, a nearly constant low-intensity air war has been taking place in and over Iraq: Iraqi\n\nanti-aircraft weapons fire on U.S. and allied aircraft; the allies respond by bombarding\n\nthese and other military targets.\n\nIn February of 1998, Secretary of Defense William Cohen asked President Bill\n\nClinton for the authority to call-up members of the Selected Reserve to support the\n\noperations in the Gulf region. Secretary Cohen announced that he needed the reservists\n\nto fill gaps in combat support and logistics operations.22 Clinton granted this request on\n\nFebruary 24, 1998, invoking the authority granted by Title 10, section 12304 of the United\n\nStates Code.23 This authority allowed the president to order members of the Selected\n\nReserve to active duty, but with certain restrictions: Each reservist could only be activated\n\nfor up to 270 days and the total number of reservists on active duty at any given time could\n\nnot exceed 200,000.

On April 13, General Wesley Clark, then the top U.S. and\n\nNATO commander in Europe, asked the United States for 300 more aircraft to support\n\nthis air campaign.24 Shortly thereafter, Pentagon officials sent President Clinton a request\n\nto call-up reserve forces to support the Kosovo mission.\n\nOn April 27, 1999, President Bill Clinton authorized the activation of members of the\n\nSelected Reserve, invoking the authority granted by Title 10, section 12304 of the United\n\nStates Code.25 This authority allowed the president to order members of the Selected\n\nReserve to active duty, but with certain restrictions: Each reservist could only be activated\n\nfor up to 270 days and the total number of reservists on active duty at any given time could\n\nnot exceed 200,000.
