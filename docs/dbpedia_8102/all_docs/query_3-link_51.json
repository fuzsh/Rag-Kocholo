        "text": "Fern Sebastian, 93, of Park Hills, passed away May 30, 2024, at Country Meadows in Park Hills. She was born December 28, 1930, in Desloge, to the late Steve Allen and Hazel Belle (Weiler) Rosener. Fern was a proud 1948 graduate of Elvins High School and dedicated member of the Immaculate Conception Catholic Church in Park Hills. Fern's love for reading, dancing, and maintaining a warm and welcoming home for her family was unparalleled. Her passion for cooking brought joy to those around her, and her talent in customer service, notably at Sears, left lasting impressions on all she encountered. Fern enjoyed many things, but most of all, she preferred spending time with her family and grandkids.\n\nShe was preceded in death by her husband of 72 years, George Thomas Sebastian, Sr.; daughter, Judy Lynn Mills; three sisters, Dorothy Daugherty, Anna Edgar and Lois Martin.\n\nFern is survived by three children, Linda Hites and husband Gene, George Thomas Sebastian, Jr. and wife Denise, Ben Sebastian and wife Sherri; grandchildren, Gene (Heather) Hites, Michelle (Joe) Whitener, Kristen (Aaron) Spahl, Keli (Travis) Rudge, J.T. (Karen) Black, Jordan (Jaimie) Black, Aimee (James Scott) Sebastian, Sarah (Landon) Bax, Brady (Mady) Sebastian, Kylee and Tyler Wolff; great-grandchildren, Eugene III and Jaysa Hites, Emmett and Blane Black, Joseph and Madeliene Whitener, Abigail and Emma Spahl, Ashlyn Rudge, Hadley and Harper Bax and Sterling Sebastian; two sisters, Charlotte Edgar and Jane Vogel; many nieces, nephews, other family members and friends also survive.\n\nFern's legacy of love, laughter, and devotion to family will live on in the hearts of all who had the privilege of knowing her. She will be deeply missed and fondly remembered. May her soul rest in peace.\n\nThe family will have an inurnment with memorial service, at Doe Run Memorial Cemetery, Saturday, June 8, 2024, at 11:00 AM. Pastor Duane Hampton will be officiating. Arrangements are under the direction of C.Z. Boyer and Son Funeral Home in Desloge. Memorials may be directed to Gentiva Hospice in honor of her loving memory."
