        "text": "Created in 2011, Albertine Books Foundation is an American nonprofit organization dedicated to supporting French literature in the United States. In partnership with the Cultural Services of the French Embassy in the United States and under Villa Albertine, Albertine Books Foundation promotes collaborative work and exchanges between France in the United States in the fields of literary creation and translation. The Albertine Books Foundation has encouraged English translations of French books in all categories (fiction, nonfiction, children’s books, comics, and poetry) through the Albertine Translation Fund since 2022, a new and enhanced version of the French Voices program that was originally created in 2006. In addition, the Albertine Translation committee chooses from among recipients two Albertine Translation prize winners each year – one in fiction and one in non-fiction. The Albertine Books Foundation is grateful for the generous support of Van Cleef & Arpels and individual donors.\n\nFern Books is a small press unhurriedly dedicated to forms of writing, and ideas about publishing, that are thoughtful and generous and expansive. They are interested in literary risk-taking, adventures in form and content and authorship, and the connections and relationships fostered between books and their readers. They aim to think out loud, as it were, about whose imaginations literary text can stir, what makes text literary in the first place, and what shapes besides bound printed matter it might take. As they work on answering these questions, they plan to publish books—among other things—that they believe make the world a more enchanting, welcoming, and sane place.\n\nRead more.\n\nFounded in 1905, The Juilliard School is a world leader in performing arts education. The school’s mission is to provide the highest caliber of artistic education for gifted musicians, dancers, and actors, composers, choreographers, and playwrights from around the world so that they may achieve their fullest potential as artists, leaders, and global citizens. Juilliard is led by Damian Woetzel, seventh president of the school, who has prioritized affordability and access to the highest level of artistic education while championing Juilliard’s tradition of excellence.\n\nLocated at Lincoln Center in New York City, Juilliard offers undergraduate and graduate degrees in dance, drama (acting and playwriting), and music (classical, jazz, historical performance, and vocal arts). More than 800 artists from 42 states and 50 countries and regions are enrolled in Juilliard’s College Division, where they appear in more than 700 annual performances in the school’s five theaters; at Lincoln Center’s Alice Tully and David Geffen halls and at Carnegie Hall; as well as at other venues around New York City, the U.S., and the world. The continuum of learning at Juilliard also includes nearly 400 students from elementary through high school enrolled in the Preparatory Division—Pre-College and Music Advancement Program (MAP); MAP serves students from diverse backgrounds often underrepresented in the classical music field. More than 1,200 students are enrolled in Juilliard Extension, the flagship continuing education program taught both in person and remotely by a dedicated faculty of performers, creators, and scholars. Beyond its New York campus, Juilliard is defining new directions in performing arts education for a range of learners and enthusiasts through a global K-12 educational curricula and preparatory and graduate studies at The Tianjin Juilliard School in China.\n\nLearn more\n\nThe Théâtre des Champs-Élysées is one of the most elegant performance venues in Paris. Designed in 1913 by a group of artists (Henry Van de Velde, the Perret brothers, Antoine Bourdelle, Maurice Denis), it was the first Parisian theatre to be entirely built of reinforced concrete, and has perpetuated for the past century a tradition of eclectic programmes of a high standard (opera, recitals, orchestral concerts, dance). Its opening is still vividly remembered for the ‘scandal’ of the premiere of Le Sacre du Printemps, whose impact on the public derived as much from Stravinsky’s music as from Nijinsky’s choreography. The artistic adventure of the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées has been distinguished by the presence, for over one hundred years now, of the most prestigious creative figures in the history of music, opera and dance.\n\nThe Association for the International Diffusion of French Art brings together 300 collectors of modern art who are fully committed to the creativity quest. It was created in 1994 with the ambition to highlight the flourishing creativity of the French artistic scene and to promote the French art scene throughout the world. ADIAF has created in 2000 the Prix Marcel Duchamp which is awarded annually to one among four shortlisted artists either born or residing in France and working in the field of visual arts.
