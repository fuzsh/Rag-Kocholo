        "text": "Fern Wood Bennett died at the age of 81 on April 30, 2015 at home in Fort Collins, CO. She is survived by her husband Alan Bennett of Fort Collins; son Michael & Nina Wommack of Langhorne, PA; son Mark & Kendra Wommack of Granite Bay, CA; daughter Janel & John Thomas of Circleville, OH; and son Adam & Judy Bennett of Fort Collins, CO; and 9 grandchildren.\n\nFern was born in 1933 to Eva and Emmett W Wood in Waynesville, MO. She was the third of four children in the family. Fern is predeceased by her parents and siblings.\n\nFern grew up in Missouri. She married R. Michael Wommack in 1953 and had 3 children. She later married Alan Bennett in 1967 and had another child.\n\nShe was a Corporate Travel Director for two insurance companies in Pennsylvania, arranging incentive trips for leading sales representatives. These trips were in North America and overseas, leading to extensive travel.\n\nFern moved to Colorado in 2005, becoming active in many community organizations - Questers Garden Club, bridge groups, and the Friends of the Symphony. As a result of her participation in all these organizations, she developed a very large number of friends and left a resounding mark on Fort Collins.\n\nShe enjoyed poetry, tennis, antiques, and singing. She had a remarkable ability to remember song lyrics and poetry verses. She is greatly missed."
