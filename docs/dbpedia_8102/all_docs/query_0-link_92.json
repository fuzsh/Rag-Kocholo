He then made his name as a contractor of bridges and roads. (Many bridges and roadways still bear plaques acknowledging the structure having been built by GILLIOZ CONSTRUCTION.) Gillioz became diverse in his business interests - and though today some of his structures are memories, his name is attached to two of the most beautiful buildings in Southwest Missouri. The 'GILLIOZ THEATER' in Springfield, Mo. opened Oct 11, 1926. It was both a theater as well as a movie house. Several films held their premiers there. Today, it is on the NAT. HISTORIC REG. and was restored to its grand glory. M.E. Gillioz also built the 'FOX THEATER' in Joplin, Mo. It was designed in the then-popular 'Spanish Revival' style. It opened in 1932. Today, it has been converted into a family center for the CENTRAL ASSEMBLY CHURCH. Gillioz also built the huge drive-in located in Monett, Mo. and several other structures in the community. Gillioz also owned and operated the GILLIOZ BANK and TRUST on Main St. in Monett.

R. C. Akin's notes: Leonard and Wilma owned and operated a Tourist Court, just outside Springfield, MO on Route 66 called Lone Star Tourist Court. In my early years, we visited and stayed at the Tourist Court many times. They were quite old at the time but were very wonderful people. Aunt Wilma used to always make me a loaf of fresh bread, hot from the oven and I would sit and enjoy it in the tiny restaurant they had at the court where Wilma would also cook up hamburgers and make sandwiches for guests and passerby's, as they also sold gas outside the court. One of my memories was watching her washing the linens for the rooms in the back room of the office in an old open tub, top wringer, washing machine. She would hang the linens in the open air behind the court. It was always wonderful crawling under those fresh sheets at night. After Wilma died, the Tourist Court was sold, Leonard went to live with his son James Leon in Contra Costa County, CA where Leonard later died in the hospital in Martinez, CA.
