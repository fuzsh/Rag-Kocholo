Burt M. Ragan, a resident of eastern Colorado for 69 years, walked into eastern Colorado from western Kansas, not too long after the Battle of Beecher Island. Magdalena Dobler, a resident of the community for 64 years, came here when she was only eight years of age. There are very few of these old pioneers left. Their ranks are numbered...they were the true pioneers, for there were very few white people here ahead of them.\n\nBURT M. RAGAN\n\nBurt Ragan, 86, a resident of the Burlington community for 69 years, passed away at the Memorial hospital Friday, Nov. 19, about 8:10 p.m. Mr. Ragan, who had been in failing health for several months, had been admitted to the hospital Friday afternoon. At one time, Mr. Ragan was one of the community's outstanding businessmen, stockmen, political leaders, having a wide acquaintance throughout the state. Mr. Ragan's public service dates back to the year 1899, when he was elected to a county office. His residence here antedates the construction of the Rock Island railroad in this region. At 17 years of age, he walked into Colorado to the Bar T Ranch from Oberlin, Kan. He was one of the few true pioneers of eastern Colorado remaining. Burt was the son of Collin and Kathrine Ragan, who resided in Lancaster, Ia. He was born March 31, 1868. Because of the death of his mother when he was four years old, he made his home with his grandparents, W.A.H. and Catherine Ragan. When 16 years of age, he came by horseback to Oberlin, Kan. The next year he walked to Colorado. Soon he progressed to leadership positions of responsibility, and continued advancement for more than 60 years.\n\nHe was confined to his home for the past seven years. Mr. Ragan became the foreman of what was at that time the largest ranch in eastern Colorado. His ambition prompted him to attend the Franklin academy, Franklin, Neb., for two winter terms of four months each. There were no fences across eastern Colorado prairies at that time, and very few settlers between the range and ranch of the Republican Cattle company. There were only trails for travel across the prairies. Mr. Ragan did freighting from Haigler, Neb., to the river the first winter that he was in Colorado, hauling food-stuffs and building materials. Mr. Ragan was married to Adella Austin, March 18, 1892, in Friend, Colo. Of the nine children born to this union, three sons died in infancy. Two daughters, Mrs. Cora Abbott and Mrs. Ethel Stokes, also preceded him, as did a brother, Laurie. Mrs. Ragan died in 1920. On March 17, 1926, Mr. Ragan was united in marriage to Mary L. Nees, in Cheyenne Wells. They came to Burlington in 1931. In the fall of 1899, Mr. Ragan was elected to the office of county clerk and recorder of Kit Carson county, and resigned his position with the Republican Cattle company to take over this new work. He served one term in this office. In 1903 he was selected as assistant postmaster of Burlington. He served in this capacity for one year, then returned to his ranch home on the Republican river and again took up the life of a cattleman for about eight years. He then became identified with the Stock Growers State Bank, where he worked for 16 1/2 years.\n\nHe sold his interests in the bank in the spring of 1929, and became interested in writing insurance and land brokerage. The many friends that were associated with Mr. Ragan because of business transactions and knowing of his unusual ability in the understanding of the many needs of this section of the state, decided he was needed in the state senate. He was elected to that office in 1934 and re-elected in 1938, serving two four year terms. Because of age and other interests, he refused to run for a third term.\n\nMr. Ragan was initiated into the Masonic Lodge No. 77, A.F. and A.M., of Burlington in 1904. He had advanced to the 32nd degree. He was presented a 50 year pin a few weeks ago. When health permitted, he was a worshipper in the Christian church. His church faith was the Reorganized Church of Latter Day Saints. Those who morn his passing are his beloved wife; two sons and two daughters, Burt M. Ragan, of Portland, Ore., Mrs. Lila D. Rule, Norton, Kan., Homer Ragan and Mrs. Vivian Kiefer, Burlington. Twelve grandchildren also survive, including Mrs. Helen Stokes Nelson, who made her home with her grandparents until she attained young womanhood; nine great grandchildren, one half brother, Samuel C. Ragan, Grinnell, Ia., a half sister, of Newton, Ia., six step children, and many other relatives. Funeral services were held Tuesday afternoon, Nov. 23, at the Hendricks mortuary in Burlington, Rev.
