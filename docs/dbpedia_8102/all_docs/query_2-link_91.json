Yarbrough Motor Company\n\nFO R EWO R D\n\nA.TI.ANTA is 100 years old.\n\nThe birth of the city and its extraordinary rise to ilic position of commercial, financial and industrial center of the southeast arc both due to the fact that ii sits high above the land be tween the Atlantic and the Gulf of Mexico and is at the place intended by nature as the gateway to miles of surrounding territory.\n\nNot by accident, but rather because of the scientific knowledge of railroad engineers, docs At lanta command the respect of businessmen in cities on near-by mountains and plains.\n\nIt was in the spring of 1836 that Hardy Ivy built a log luu on land which now is within the limits of Atlanta. And in December of that same year--so in haste was fate to aid the citv even at its birth--Governor Schlcy signed an act calling upon the state to build the connecting rail road between the Tennessee and the Chattahoochce rivers.\n\nXone reali/ed the importance of the statement in the act. which directed engineers to find the suitable terminus. Stephen Long, chief engineer, surveyed the territory in and around what is now Atlanta. Finally, he selectee! a spot, and a short while thereafter--in the year 1837--Long stood among the trees then growing at Five Points and drove a stake marking the terminal. He believed he had selected the natural junction of railways which some day would run between towns and cities throughout this section.\n\nHistory proves the debt Terminus, the first community on this site, then Manhasville. and finally Atlanta, owe to Stephen Long.\n\nHistory also shows how indebted Atlanta is ti> railroads, and. above all. how time and again her citizens have matched the bold strides of fate.\n\nA corner near the spot where the engineer drove the stake is now one of the five most valu able in the world. Nearly 300.000 people live within several miles of the place where Hardy Ivy built his home.\n\n\\Vhcn one remembers the city lay in ashes only 71 years ago, it appears as if the courage, energy and the imagination of all had been combined into one great effort since that time.\n\nBy vision, hope, enterprise and an unfailing ambition, Atlanta has risen above days of dis appointment and years of war and economic depression. Yesterday even, when Atlanta and all American cities suffered, her leaders saw and planned for continued progress.\n\nYet however startling may be the achievement, growth and the power found at the end of her chapters, no period in Atlanta's history is more colorful or strange than her birth and early days.\n\nThe Publisher is indebted to the Atlanta Constitution and the Atlanta Historical Variety for much of the early history of Atlanta and many of the old photografts.\n\nATLANTA'S EARLY YEARS\n\n(1837-1860.)\n\nE VER since the first \"iron horse,\" which was to be used on the Western & Atlantic railroad, was brought here by a mule-drawn wagon from Madison in 1842. citizens as well as their leaders predicted Atlanta would have a great commercial future and would become the \"Gate City of the South.\" . Speaking in Memphis. John C. Calhoun said railroads must necessarily unite \"at a point in DcKalb county, in the state of Georgia, called Atlanta--\" This had been the vision of Stephen Long as far back as 1837, when he marked the terminus here. And hence, for the next few years the place was called Terminus.\n\nJfLIA (CARLISLE) WITHERS First Girl Born in Atlnnui\n\nMarthasville became the name in 1843, in honor of Martha Lumpkin and her father. Gov ernor Wilson Lumpkin, who several years before had aided officials when little progress was be ing made in the construction of the Western and Atlantic railroad.\n\nNAMED ATLANTA IX 1845 The year 1845 brought the name Atlanta. Somehow Marthasville did not seem the proper name for such a rapidly growing community to Richard Peters, resident engineer of the finished portion of the railroad, who had to notify the public the route was being opened from Covington to Marthasville. He wrote J. Edgar Thompson, chief engineer of the Georgia railroad, asking him to suggest a name. Thompson replied in part: \"Eureka--Atlanta, the terminus of the Western & Atlantic railroad. Atlantiac. masculine: At lanta, feminine--a coined word--and if you think it will suit, adopt it.\"\n\n10\n\n1837 --ATLANTA C E x TE x x i AL-- 1937\n\nFIRST NAMED WHITEHALL\n\nThough Terminus is usually thought to be Atlanta's first name, actually the first name of this community was Whitehall. In giving an account of the earliest settlers in this section, Walter G. Cooper, author of the \"Official History of Fulton County,\" says that the community was given the name Whitehall by Charner Humphries, who moved here from South Carolina in 1825.\n\nHumphries, the great-great uncle of Judge John D. Humphries, built the Whitehall Inn on a plot now bounded by Whitehall, Lee, Oak and Zachry streets. He named the inn and the community Whitehall for the famous part of London which bears that name. Charner also has the distinction of being the first citizen with civic pride, for he ran the inn only a short while before giving it a coat of white paint.\n\nNot long after Charner's arrival, and about four years before Long drove the stake at Five Points, Hardy Ivy came here, later buying a plot of land between the present Edgewood avenue and Peachtree street. Hardy is named in a history published by the Atlanta Pioneer Society as being the first white settler within the limits of what is now Atlanta.\n\nIn addition, Hardy is the father of the first boy born in Atlanta, and is the main competitor for parental honors with Mr. and Mrs. WilJis Carlisle, who moved here as a bride and groom in 1841 ..ancLbframf thp parent, uf Julia. Hu. fesHticL_______^\n\nHardy's son, Socrates Ivy, became superintendent of theWSsHjrn and Atlantic railroad shops. Julia Carlisle married W. S. Withers and for many years was a well-known citizen of Atlanta.\n\nThe fact that we now have a record of the first births, and the many other \"firsts,\" such as the arrive! of a doctor, seems to show how greatly the earliest settlers, living almost in a wilder ness, appreciated events bringing comfort and joy, and relief from monotony.\n\nFIRST NEWSPAPER APPEARS\n\nIn the year the community became Atlanta, citizens saw the Luminary, their first newspaper; their first church, and probably their first school. The church, situated at Peachtree and Houston streets, was used for a school house during the week and for union services on Sunday.\n\nDR. B. F. BOMAR Atlanta's Second Mayor\n\nIt is related that Dr. Josh Gilbert, one of the earliest doc tors, used to walk along the streets and blow a whistle when ever he came to a corner, so citizens would know he was preparing to visit some country patient, and would be out side the city for several hours.\n\nSo rapid was the growth that in 1847 \"the town of At lanta\" was changed to \"the city of Atlanta,\" by a legislative act. Limits of the city were extended a mile in every direc tion from the state depot. The commission type of govern ment was soon succeeded by a mayor, Moses Formwalt, and six councilmen.\n\nCITY GROWS RAPIDLY\n\nIn 1847, the first bank was begun by John F. Mims, whose principal business was selling ex change to Augusta, then Atlanta's chief market. A volunteer fire department was organized in 1851 and an ordinance was passed requiring all houses to be provided with a ladder and two buckets. Before long three policemen patroled the streets at night.\n\nA daily newspaper, the Atlanta Intelligencer, was established in 1851 by Jared I. Whitaker as owner and John H. Steele as editor.\n\nWhen the city was only six years old, the city fathers sent a committee to Milledgeville to seek the state capitol. They bought the present capitol square, built a city hall, took $100,000 worth of railroad stock and established a board of health.\n\n1837-A k x T A CENTENNIAL-- 1937\n\n11\n\nPOPULATION LEAPS UPWARD\n\nIn 1852, 1,000 persons came to Atlanta. Two years later the population was 6.025 and by 1859 it was 11.500. There were about 57 stores, not counting saloons; 4 hotels. 13 churches, two planing mills, a sash and blind factory, four tanneries, several shoe factories and a rolling mill which turned out iron for railroads. On Christmas Day. 1855. the city was lighted by gas for the first time.\n\nATLANTA IN 1860 Sketch furnished by -Mrs. James R. Gray\n\nATLANTA DURING THE WAR BETWEEN THE STATES\n\n(1860-1865.)\n\nf Although many other Georgia cities were older, Atlanta figured prominently in prewar cam paigns and conferences. Citizens felt keenly the strained relations which were rapidly arousing the north and south in 1860. In October of that year, they organized a corps of minute men. Several months later, when South Carolina seceded from the union, the city shook with the thunder of guns-and turned into an excited audience applauding the independence of the neighboring state.\n\nSECESSION FAVORED A salufe of 15 guns was fired at sunrise, followed by a torchlight procession and a. mightier salute of 100 guns. A mass meeting was held at II o'clock. Atlantans strongly favored secession, and in January, just before the convention at Milledgeville, they elected candidates who would vote for secession. Public opinion on war crystallized with visits and addresses by Jefferson Davis and Alexander Stephens, and with a meeting held in Atlanta by bankers to discuss the financial burdens of war. On August 11, 1862, about eight months after Georgia's secession, martial law was established in Atlanta by an order of General Braxton Bragg. Atlanta, already recognized as the main pivoi for trains in the southeast, was to become a great war center. The city immediately became a Confederate manufacturing hub. where arms and equipment were made, and a military depot where food, clothing and ammunition temporarily were stored before being shipped to the battle lines. General Bragg soon made Atlanta the base of his army. A hospital was established at Alabama and Pryor streets, where hundreds of wounded soldiers were treated and given medical care when the federal army gradually forced the Confederates south.\n\n12\n\n1 837 -- A T L A N T A C E N T E N XI A L -- 1 937\n\nDAYS OF SORROW\n\nSeldom have a series of battles been discussed with so many \"ifs\" by southern military scientists as the Atlanta campaign, when the city spent many days and nights listening to gun shot before the gradual onslaught of the federals. Few acts in military history have surpassed the cruelty of General Shcrman's burning of a city already severely stricken and shell-shocked.\n\nGENERAL SHERMA\\ WITH TH E Cl'N'S THAT TOOK ATLANTA General William Tccumsch Shcrtnan and his battery, a unit of the Federal forces that was prominent in the siCRC and capture of Atlanta in IHG-t. This pholo was la ken at the time of the formal occupancy of the captured cit\\. General Sherman is standing in the right foreground with his arm resting upon the cannon.\n\nThe horrible campaign which resulted in Atlanta being reduced to ashes began near Dalton. Southerners, under the command of General Joseph E. Johnston, were gradually being forced to retreat toward Atlanta. Several battles were hard-fought along the Western & Atlantic railroad before the campaign reached a climax at Kennesaw mountain, where thousands of federals were killed as they tried to take the Confederate position.\n\nAt this time Sherman had 112.819 men. while General Johnston had only 59.2^. With al most twice as many men. the northern general forced the southerners across the Chattahoochee river by Hank movements.\n\nConfederates had been driven from Marietta to the west side of the Chattahoochee river when another Hank movement threatened to cu t off any communication with Smyrna. Sherman threw his famous \"gveat wheel\" around the city, forcing fohnston's troops to retreat to the east side.\n\n1837 - A T L A N T A C E X T E X X I A L -- 1937\n\nCOMMAND ORDERED CHANGED Just at this time occurred one incident which has caused so much theorizing among histo rians and military men. As the southern general prepared to fight the northern unit under Thomas, he received a telegram from President Davis. telling him to turn over the command 10 General John B. Hood. About this time--July 17--federal forces crossed the Chattahoochee in three places and soon crossed Peachtree creek and formed a wheel about the city. At 3 o'clock in the afternoon of July 20. Hood attacked several units on the outskirts of the city. A fierce battle, where hundreds of soldiers fought hand to hand, resulted in a northern unit reporting -100 dead and the south losing -JOO with about -1.000 wounded.\n\nFIRST SHELL STRIKES CITY A shell from this battle, the first to strike the city, hit at East Ellis and Ivy streets, killing a child with its parents.\n\nThe next day was quiet and then on July 22 came the Battle of Atlanta.\n\nHOWELL'S BATTERY \\V.\\S MAIN CONFEDERATE DEFENSE Shown here is Howell's battery, the strongest emplacement of the right of the Confederate Hne. which extended a mile beyond Howcll Mill road, in the daxs whet) Sherman grcchiallv moved on Atlanta. The batten1 was commanded by Captain E\\an P. Howcll and was situated on Deerland where Jack J. Spalding's home is today. '\n\nThis battle, one of the most important and most tragic in the Civil \\Var. followed a sudden and desperate attack by Hood on the grand division of General McPherson. Gaining an advan tage by surprising the federals. Hood's troops glimpsed a victory and then were forced to retreat by the strength of numbers.\n\n14\n\n1837-ATLANTA C E x T E x N I A L - 1937\n\n1837 -- ATLANTA C E x T E s x i A L -- 1937\n\n15\n\nHood nevertheless turned on Sherman's right, broke through his main lines, captured many valuable guns and killed all the federal horses. The northern general then began warring from the highlands in northeast Atlanta, which he had taken with his first attack. As soon as Confed erate forces weakened before his long-range fire. Sherman's units attacked on the opposite side and won the territory they had lost just a short while before.\n\nConfederate soldiers soon began to burn their supplies and ic> make other preparations for leaving Atlanta.\n\nSUFFERING RAMPANT\n\nNever has the city known such suffering as during this 40-day siege. A hospital was set up in a city park, where doctors worked among exploding bombs, smoke and blistering sun. Prices were exorbitant all during the campaign. Flour sold for S300 a barrel.\n\nATLANTA. GEORGIA As il appeared on the entrance of the Union Army under General Sherman. September 2.\n\nView of Dccnuir and Pcachlrcc Streets from Marietta Street.\n\nOn August 31, Sherropn prevented communication with the outside world, and the next dayHood's forces left the city: Citizens waited breathlessly for a word from Sherman. \\Vhen the federal general finally spoke, he announced that Atlanta must be evacuated.\n\nAppeals of Atlantans, officially made by Mayor James M. Calhoun and several councilmen, went unheeded. Sherman announced that Atlantans would have 10 days in which to leave the city.\n\nIt is estimated that 4-16 families, many poverty-stricken, left Atlanta. Sherman's army de stroyed 4,500 buildings- Four hundred were left standing.\n\nCRUCIAL CAMPAIGN1\n\nThe Atlanta campaign was of paramount importance to the Confederacy. Since the city was a military center, a defeat of southern troops here meant that the xi'ar would be short-lived.\n\nMany believe if the command had not been taken from General Johnston, the Confederate army would have won, while many others believe there would have been no Atlanta campaign had Johnston carried out the wishes of the President and leading southern generals by attacking\n\n16\n\n1837-ATLANTA CENTENNIAL- 1937\n\nfederal forces in Tennessee, instead of beating retreat. During the retreat Johnston is reported to have killed many more men than he lost and his soldiers were said to have been in good con dition when they reached Atlanta.\n\nWhen Atlantans began coming back in November, they found the city had been mercilessly destroyed. By December 15, 1864, however, a reporter wrote for the Augusta Chronicle:\n\n\".Many of the old citi/cns are returning, and the general watch-word is repair and rebuild.\"\n\nATLANTA RECOVERS TO BECOME INDUSTRIAL CENTER\n\n(1865-1900.)\n\nCritically wounded by the war and facing a long period of political indignities as well as the sleeve-jerking annoyances of carpet-baggers, Atlantans nevertheless turned to rebuilding the city with the remarkable enterprise which since has become known far and wide as the \"Atlanta spirit.\"\n\nI'RYOR AM) ALABAMA STREETS IN THE EARLY IK70s The cupola to the left is oil the Georgia Railroad building, still standing. The smaller one to the right of it adorned the home of Atlanta's first fire engine company. The one to the extreme right is on the old conrt house. The American Hotel is in the foreground.\n\nThe streets heard a constant creaking of carts, wagons and hand-barrows, and the noises of the saw and hammer. Citi/ens had not forgotten that the topography of Atlanta made it the natural gate city of the southeast. In one year after reconstruction was begun, there were 11 large business houses, two hotels, and express building and a printing shop, in addition to the resi dences.\n\nThough Atlanta quickly regained the business air of pre-war days, the political situation in the state was deplorable and* it became necessary for the city fathers to make some decisions re garding future government.\n\n1837 - A T i.

At a second meeting in September, they elected delegates to the state convention at Milledgeville, where representatives drafted a letter 10 the President asking amnesty for the disfranchised citizens of Georgia.\n\nFor several years Georgia suffered under military law, enduring plunder by carpetbaggers, radicals and negroes. Finally, when called upon to fight for freedom by several of the great statesmen of Georgia. 20,000 persons flocked here on July 23, 1868, to attend the \"Bush-Arbor meeting.\" For Georgians, famous addresses made that day by General Robert Toombs, Benja min Hill and Howell Cobb seemed to dispel most fears for the future.\n\nGROWTH RESUMED\n\nDespite political troubles. Atlanta was growing and increasing in power even faster than it did in years just before the war. In 1869, the population was 21,789, though it was only about 10,000 in 1860. Just one year after the conflict, Atlanta businessmen organized a board of trade, which was succeeded in 1871 by the Atlanta Chamber of Commerce.\n\nThe year 1872 marks one of the most important events in the city's history, for in this year the public school system was inaugurated. Probably no step in the city's progress was so freely discussed or so widely approved as the system of public education.\n\nThis city-wide enthusiasm over what probably is its greatest institution, seemed to hail the glorious period just ahead for a section destined to develop under the imagination and elo-\n\n1837 -- ATLANTA C E x T E x x i A L -- 1937\n\n19\n\n(juence of ihe great prophets. Benjamin Hill and Henry \\V. Grady. For a long time Atlanta had energy and ambition; now it had vision.\n\nAt this time not only Atlanta, but the entire south, saw its fortune in industrialism. \"Imlustry--educated industry--\" declared Benjamin Hill, \"has taken possession of its exhaustless stores of nature, and of nature's forces; is daily lifting up her hands, full of all new inven tions: is filling the earth with her instruments of elevation and improvements; is grasping conti nents and binding the nations in a bundle, and with right royal confidence, is bidding kings and rulers, empires and republics, obey.\"\n\nCRISIS WEATHERED But as Atlanta and other cities reached for the new fields pointed out by Hill, there came the crisis of 1873. Even then, however, Atlanta did not suffer by comparison with most cities. Not a bank failed and though business was sluggish, Atlantans managed to hold tighi-fistedly to whai they had.\n\nI'ppcr left: Equitable Building. l'r\\or Slrccl.

Lower right: Picking Cotton.\n\nIn fact, the years from 1870 to 1880 saw the greatest progress, probably, of any period in the\n\ncity's history. Many improvements which were started before the crisis were completed. Most\n\nimportant of these was a system supplying the ci:y with water, installed at a cost of approxi\n\nmately S500.000.\n\nMore women and children came to town--and came more often--after a street railway had -\n\nbeen installed by George \\V. Adair and Richard Peters. Many buildings were built on Fryer/\n\nstreet, and Atlantans, walking on Sunday afternoon, saw new homes and several church buikt -\n\nings going up on the fringe of the city. H. I. Kimball built the new Kimball house.\n\n.\n\nAt night Atlantans attended DeGive's opera house, where such great artists as Forrest and\n\nBooth, Sarah Bernhardt, Fannie Davenport, Scojt Thomton and Richard Mansfield performed.\n\nThere was marked progress in religious, educational, social and commercial fields. The popu\n\nlation had grown to 30,869-\n\n20\n\n1 837 - A T L A X T A C E N T E X N 1 A L - 1937\n\nMADE CAPITAL IN 1877\n\nDoubtless the most important event during the period came in 1877, when Atlanta was made the capital city of Georgia.\n\nAtlanta took one of her first concrete steps toward industrialism with the cotton exposition of 1881. After several meetings of prominent Atlantans, including Henry Grady, it was decided that the city should raise one-third of the capital stock and other cities should raise the balance.\n\nCitizens here contributed their quota in one day and made preparations to open the expo sition on October 5 with a brilliant military and civic parade.\n\nThere were more than 1,000 exhibits, mostly from the south, and the main exhibition build ing represented a cotton factory. Thousands attended the fair. When Grady and his colleagues checked the expenditures at its close they found the gross receipts amounted to S262.513, while the cost was S258,475.\n\nCOTTON STATES AND INTERNATIONAL EXPOSITION\n\nAtlantans gained experience here which enabled them in 1895 to stage the Cotton States and International Exposition, probably the city's greatest public enterprise.\n\n\"The 'sky-scraper' era of the last decade has wrought wondrous changes in Atlanta's sky line,\" wrote one historian in 1901.\n\nWith 700 manufacturing industries in the city, Atlanta was established as the leading indus trial and manufacturing city of the south. During this period the \"hustle-bustle\" spirit best showed itself. From 1896 to 1900 alone 52,367,303 was spent for dwellings. At the same time, several hotels and public buildings gave height to Atlanta's skyline. Grady hospital had been completed in 1892 at a cost of S100.000, raised chiefly by private subscription.\n\n1837-A\n\n, N T A C E N T E N XI A L -- 1937\n\n21\n\nATLANTA RISES TO ITS PRESENT GREATNESS\n\n(1900-1937.)\n\n\\Vith the turn of the century Atlanta entered a period of such rapid development that a re view at the end of each year since leaves some sections of the city dotted with new parks, schools, viaducts, highways, public buildings and other imposing structures.\n\nBy this time practically all of her railroads were completed and she began to be nationally recognized as the headquarters of southern commerce and industry. Already the day when she would be famed for homes, office buildings, churches, educational institutions and recreational centers was in sight.\n\nI'pper left: Fort Walker ami General McPhcrson monument, t'ppcr right: Stale Capitol. Lrmcr Icfi: First Methodist Church ami Grand Opera House. Lower right: Kimtxtlt House.\n\nThree times since then--in 1910, 1921 and 1925--citizens have voted bond issues, totaling more than 520,000,000, used for an extension of the waterworks and to build schools, sewage disposal plants, sewers, three viaducts and the city hall.\n\nTo see with what force the city moved--in 1907 Atlanta spent approximately 5250.000 to pave streets and to build sewers and sidewalks. The following year the city auditorium-armory was completed.\n\nOPERA COMES TO CITY\n\n\\Viih an auditorium, Atlanta, as far back as 1910, saw an opportunity to do something which was done by no other municipality other than \\ew York city. Inspired rather than intimidated by the boldness of the venture, she immediately made plans and in 1910 the Metropolitan Opera Company came here for its first season.\n\nIn this same year, under the administration of Mayor Robert F. Maddox, citizens voted the first bond issue of 53,000,000 and took a vital interest in the new Fulton county courthouse. This building cost 51.500,000, and was handled without a bond issue.\n\n22\n\n1 837 -- A T L A \\ T A C E X T E N X I A L -- I 937\n\nATLANTA TN HER CENTENNIAL YEAR\n\n1, Modc-rn Atlanta homes in North Penchtrcc section; 3, Atlanta today (Five Points in circle): 4, Puxlmom Park: 5, Grant Park: 6.

Several million dollars were .pent there by the\n\ngovernment for construction of buildings.\n\nGREAT FORWARD MOVEMENT\n\nOne of the greatest strides taken by Atlanta came in 1925 with \"The Forward Atlanta Move ment,\" which was organized-by the Atlanta Chamber of Commerce. Nearly SI.000.000 was spent between 1925 and 1930 to advertise Atlanta. It is estimated that 762 concerns, with pay rolls aggregating S34.500.000, came here as a result of the movement.\n\nIn 1929 the city purchased Candler field and Atlanta became a great hub of aviation, with lines operating to metropolitan cities of the east, south and midwest.\n\nAtlanta's increasing fame and the fact that its annual growth is measured by hundreds and thousands prove that the selection of this spot as the site of the city was a wise and far-sighted move. She continues to maintain a business supremacy over all cities of the south.\n\nThe United States Department of Commerce, in one of its commercial surveys of the south east, says:\n\n\"Atlanta is generally recognized as the principal headquarters city of this region, being the seat of a large part of the regional administrative machinery of concerns marketing their services and commodities in the territory.\"\n\nNATIONAL CONCERNS HERE\n\nMore than 1,700 nationally known concerns have branches here for manufacturing or for warehousing and distributing purposes.\n\nAtlanta has 3.796 retail and 642 wholesale stores. Her immediate trade area extends 100 miles in every direction, while her wholesalers, jobbers and salesmen cover the entire southeast.\n\nShe is the base of federal activities in the southeast. There are more than 37 permanent gov ernmental divisions which employ nearly 5.000 persons. Among the larger federal organizations here are the Federal Reserve Bank, fourth corps area headquarters, federal penitentiary and Fort McPherson.\n\nThe railroad center of the south, 102 passenger trains arrive each day. while more than 500 merchandise and package cars leave here over 15 lines. The two railway express companies handle about 4,850 cars a month.\n\nThere are 142 buses coming in and going out of the city each day. In addition to hundreds of unscheduled trucks, 75 regulated truck lines serve the city daily.\n\nAtlanta is the largest telephone center in the south and the third largest telegraph center in the world. Last year the postal receipts amounted to S4.321.691. making Atlanta the leading parcel post distributing point in this region.\n\nSituated near the foothills of the Blue Ridge mountains, on a ridge which divides the water shed of the Atlantic from that of the Gulf of Mexico, Atlanta has the greatest altitude of any city of its size, or larger, in the country, except Denver.\n\nHEART OF COTTON BELT\n\nShe is in the heart of the great cotton belt of the south and has been the dominating agri cultural power of the state for generations. Here is one of the largest cotton markets in the L'nited States.\n\nMore than 1.400 commodities are manufactured by her 762 factories.\n\nThe value of her products is said to be 564,822,748 annually.\n\nAtlanta is the third largest insurance center in the world. It has scores of large drygoods and furnishings houses.\n\nIt is the largest millinery center in the southeast. It has one morning and two afternoon newspapers and many other publications. It is the home of the Coca-Cola Company, the largest soft drink concern in the country.\n\nAtlanta is the photo-engraving center of the south.\n\nLIBRARY\n\n6. no.\n\nUniversity Extension Center - Atlanta\n\n24\n\n-- ATLANTA CENTE NNIAL--I (.)fS7\n\nATLANTA TODAY Top: G>clor:nn:i building in Gram Park.

It has more than 350 churches, with more than 100,000 members representing 20 denomina tions. It has IS registered hospitals, sanatoriums. sanitariums and clinics. It has 10 banks and trust companies, three of which are national banks. It has approximately 70,000 homes and more than 20 hotels. For recreation--it has 71 parks, 14 golf courses and 32 theaters, with a toial sealing capacity of 35,358. Atlanta has 54 elementary, nine junior high and five senior high schools. Streei cars here are said to be the finest in the country. Atlanta is served with natural gas and the city owns its huge waterworks.\n\n1,500 PRODUCTS ARE MANUFACTURED BY FACTORIES LOCATED IN ATLANTA\n\nAtlanta's manufacturing plants produce more than 1,500 commodities, ranging from baby chairs to caskets, from potato chips to massive farm implements and the heaviest pieces of ma chinery, and the city is recognized by merchants in every pan of the world as one of the highest ranking manufacturing centers in the south.\n\nWith her reputation as distribution center of the southeast, Atlanta's preeminent manufac turing position has sometimes been overlooked. Facts and figures, however, attest her greatness as a manufacturing hub and in recent years the reports of trained investigators have led more and more concerns to establish plants here.\n\nAt present there are 758 factories in Atlanta, the value of their products amounted in 1929 to SI36.947.488, and in 1933. a depression year, to nearly S65.000.000. The value of product* man ufactured by plants in Fulton county totaled 108.260,523 in 1933. The wages paid annually by these factories exceed 513,500,000.\n\nA comparison of the values of commodities produced by concerns here and those turned out by plants in other southern cities shows how Atlanta's position as a manufacturing hub some times is buried. In 1933 when the value of Atlanta products exceeded 564,000,000, that of prod ucts in Birmingham, Ala., was below 541,000,000 and that of those in Houston. Texas, was below S58.000.000.\n\nThe city's manufacturing assets for the most part are based on hard. logical facts, though its rapid rise to the position of industrial center of the southeast has its foundation in the roman tic beginning of the city. Stephen Long's selection of this territory as the place where he would drive the slake marking the terminal of railroads proved to be a wise and far-sighted move not only from a commercial and industrial, but from a manufacturing point of view. The railroads and other transportation facilities which terminate here because Atlanta is the natural topo graphical meeting place, afford manufacturers a smooth and steady means of distributing prod ucts as xvell as of gathering raxv material.\n\nSTRATEGIC POSITION' DESCRIBED\n\nAtlanta's strategic position has been thus picturesquely described by a bulletin of the Cham ber of Commerce:\n\n\"For if the two great traffic lanes of America--from Chicago, south and east; from New York, south and west--are*<6nsidered as arms, and are crossed at the wrists--Atlanta controls the hands and fingers of the south. All traffic going to the 15 encircling southeastern and gulf ports must go by way of the railroad lines that pass through and radiate from Atlanta, the wrists, down along the 10 fingers to the sea.\"\n\nOne of the most striking characteristics of Atlanta industries is diversification of commodi ties. The city is dominated by no one industrial group.\n\nCommodities manufactured here include automobiles, steel implements, textiles, chemicals, fertilizers, furniture, paper and paper products, candy and confectionery, priming and publish-\n\n26\n\n1837-AT LA XTA CENT E x M A L - 1937\n\ning. lumber, jewelry, mattresses, signs, bread, cakes, flooring, clocks, auto glass, soft drinks, syrups, medicines, dental instruments, stoves, plating, canvas goods, polishes and cleaners, toilet articles, clothes, hats and hundreds of other items.\n\nHEAVY MANUFACTURING\n\nMassive implements and wire are turned out by steel plants here. Two internationally known automobile companies have manufacturing plants in Atlanta. Here are made the things needed by other manufacturers, contractors, doctors, druggists, fanners, business supply houses as well as the countless items needed to run the home and the community. And these commodities are shipped to most every part of the world.\n\nDiversification of products as well as labor, industrial sites, warehousing facilities, power and natural resources offered by Atlanta is taken into consideration by manufacturers who establish plants here. Much may be written on each of these assets, natural or acquired, which belong to Atlanta, the city which is just now 100 years old.\n\nThe temperament of the Anglo-Saxon labor found in Atlanta is without the unreasonableattitude found among workmen in many parts of the country, which has led to numerous strikes and increased cost of production. By tradition, laborers here give a \"fair day's labor for a failday's pay.\" There is little strife between employes and employers. Both are aided by living con ditions in Atlanta, where the normal living expenses are 7.5 per cent below the national average.\n\nSITES ARE NUMEROUS\n\nAs for sites on which to establish manufacturing plants, the city, long known as a railway center, offers many locations alongside of railroad tracks and near small streams which provide water for steam power. In addition, hundreds of nationally known industries are established here for warehousing or distributing purposes and thus increase Atlanta's facilities for shipping finished products or gathering raw materials.\n\nFrom the standpoint of power, the Atlanta area offers a steady, adequate flow of power at a price said to be cheaper, with one exception, than in any industrial district in the country.\" A merger of large companies recently increased the potential output of plants serving the city. New power projects are being developed to keep in step with the industrial growth of the section.\n\nOne of the most important industrial assets of Atlanta is natural resources.\n\nGEORGIA LEADERSHIP\n\nGeorgia, of which Atlanta is the capital, leads all states in the Union in producing peaches, watermelons, peanuts, sweet potatoes, pecans, barytcs and fullers earth. The state produces, or is capable of doing so, 44 of the 52 commercial minerals, most every type of fruit and vegetable, lumber, livestock and poultry.\n\nThe city's potential watcrpower is a result of the topography of Georgia, and its many dif ferent minerals are accounted for by the diversity of the geological formations.\n\nThe state produces more than 25 different kinds of minerals in commercial quantities. In 1933 the value of Georgia's mineral products was 518,740,930. Among the minerals offered by the soil of the state are asbestos, barytes, bauxite,chlorite, chromite, clays, coal, feldspar, fluor spar, fullers earth, granite, graphite, limonite, hematite, limestone, manganese ores, marbles, marls, mica, ocher. pyrite, setricite, serpentine, slate, soapstone, talc and tripoli.\n\nTo have an accurate picture of the potentialities Atlanta and Georgia offer manufacturers one also must take into consideration that the city is the financial and commercial heart of the south. Although Atlanta ranks thirty-third in population, it stands fifteenth in bank clearings. More than 1.700 of the country's foremost business organizations have branches here, and sev eral great concerns recently built factories here at a cost of millions of dollars.\n\nMany manufacturers who established plants here have pointed out that the city is at a place from which the southern market may best be covered, and from which goods may be rapidlytransported to the coast.\n\nSeaports near Atlanta, include Charleston, Miami. Tampa, Key West, New Orleans, Savan nah. Gulfport, Mobile, Jacksonville. Pcnsacola and Brunswick. Express trains generally cover the distance between Atlanta and these cities in from JO to 15 hours.\n\n1837 -- A T L A x T A CENTENNIAL-- 1937\n\nAs to inland markets and sources of supply, Atlanta holds a strategic position, with 15 lines of eight railway systems radiating to all cities in this section.\n\nAtlanta's growth and present importance as an industrial center is shown by the following figures on the value of the products manufactured here, even during economic depression: 1890, SI6.707.000; 1904, 525,746,000; 1909, 533,038,000; 1914. S41.279.000: 1919. S113.992.000: 1921. 579,815,237: 1923.5122.284,262: 1925. S13I.236.952: 1927. SI 15.830.250; 1929. S136.497.488: 1931. 56-1,822,748.\n\nThe value of products manufactured by Fulton county factories for the years 1927, 1929. 1931 and 1933 totaled S597.559,026.\n\n\"\\o longer can industry hope to serve the country from any one point, however centrally lo cated,\" declares the chairman of the industrial bureau of the Chamber of Commerce. \"Out of the changing methods of marketing has arisen a demand for quicker and better service--possible only through the establishment of branch plants and sales organi/ations.\n\n\"Startling as the growth of the south must seem to ether sections, it is but the logical outcome of a growing realization of the overwhelming natural advantages that arc here. All the world is awakening to the vast resources of the south and today her great industrial development is out stripping all attempts to record it. Atlanta is the logical place from which to serve this rich area.\"\n\nIt is the automobile center of the south and is the hub for large motor buses and motor irucks.\n\nAtlanta is the second largest mule market in the country.\n\nIt abounds in points of interest, including the home of Uncle Remus, the cyclnrama paint ing of the Battle of Atlanta and many relics of the \\Var Between the States.\n\nIt has the reputation of being an ideal convention city.\n\nIt is recognized as the \"office building\" center of the country, being outranked only by San Francisco, based on proportions of population.\n\nYet all these facts merely touch the edges of Atlanta's story and point out how Atlanta of today will take progressive strides in business, education, art, religion, transportation, communi cation, government, civic--and all the countless other things which will make Atlanta's future even greater than her past.--Courtesy Atlanta Constitution.\n\nATLANTA IS FAVORED BY EQUABLE WEATHER\n\nAlthough Atlanta is in the deep south and her winter temperatures average as much as 10 or more degrees above those of cities in a slate as far north as Ohio, in the summer her days are only about 1 or 2 degrees warmer.\n\nIn climate Atlanta has one of her greatest assets. Even though the weather is an old story, everyone is interested in a climate which even professional weathermen say is \"most delightful.\" Because of her pleasant weather, the mildness of her winters, the coolness of her summer nights and the fact that she is out of the southern stonn area, northern tourists arc each year coming to Atlanta in increasing numbers.\n\nThose who think of the severe ice and snowstorm winter before last and the number of ex cessively hot days this summer are reminded by George \\\\-. Mindling, Atlanta's official weather forecaster, that weather must be judged over a period of many years. \\Vhen one considers the \"average,\" Atlanta ranks high among cities enjoying pleasant, healthful weather.\n\nWINTERS ARE MILD\n\n\"The most important factor is the mildness of her winters,\" says Mr. Mindling. \"Believe it or not, but the average here during the three coldest months, December, January and February, is only about 44 degrees. The weather is not freezing on half the nights during December and January.\n\n\"As for summer weather, we don't suffer extreme heat any oftener than they do. let's say. in Ohio. I believe also you'll find drouth is less frequent here than it is there.\"\n\n28\n\n1837-ATLANTA C E x TE x x i A L- 1937\n\nAtlanta's topography is responsible for her favorable climate. She is situated at the foothills of the Blue Ridge mountains at an altitude of 1,050 feet above sea level, and thus is relieved of the humidity which makes southern summers oppressive. At the same time, her low latitudes assure her against the extremes of cold in winter.\n\nWATER SUPPLY PURE\n\nA pure water supply, evenly distributed rainfall and a high altitude make Atlanta one of the healthiest of American cities.\n\nThe operation of transportation and communication systems, and other utilities, arc seldom delayed by cold and snow. The costs of fuel, clothing and other necessities are reduced by At lanta's good weather.\n\nThe mean temperatures of a few months, based on a 45-year period, are given here in de grees Farcnheit:\n\nJanuary ._...._............................ 43.2 April ............._..._........................60.8 June _.......................................76.1\n\nJuly ............................_....._._.....78.1 August ......................._....__....77.1 November ._............__........_.....52.1\n\nThe normal annual precipitation at Atlanta, also based on a 45-year period, is 49.30 inches.\n\nCITY'S POPULATION GROWING RAPIDLY\n\nThe population of Atlanta was first recorded in 1854 when there were 6,025 persons in the city. It is a remarkable fact that even though all civilians were ordered to leave the city following the Battle of Atlanta by 1866 the population was nearly 20,000. Since then the city has grown by thousands during every ten-year period.\n\nAtlanta's census growth may be seen by the following figures:\n\n1870 ...................................... 21,879 1880 ..................................... 37,409 1890 ...................................... 65,533\n\n1900 ...................................... 89,872\n\n1910 ._._._............................. 154,839 1920 ............._....................... 200,616 1930 ...._............................... 270,366\n\nATLANTA RECOGNIZED AS MEDICAL CENTER\n\nAtlanta is recognized as the leading medical center of the southeast. There are 18 registered hospitals, sanitariums, sanatoriums and clinics in the city, which have a total bed capacity of more than 2.000. There are 10 clinics for the diagnosis and the treatment of general medical and surgical diseases and those requiring the services of specialists.\n\nThe city has 685 physicians, white and colored, with 425 white members of the Fulton Coun ty Medical Association. There are also 100 graduate registered nurses in the city.\n\n______18S7 - A T L A x T A CENTENNIAL- 1937\n\n29\n\nTHE STORY OF \"THE STANDING PEACHTREE\"\n\nB> EfGEXE M- M1TCHELL OF ATLANTA. C.A.. JAXl'ARY. 1928\n\nAXGING on the wall in the Georgia State Library at the Capitol is Early's Map of Georgia made in 1818. On Peachtree Creek near the Chattahoochce River the town of Standing Peach Tree is shown on this map. At that time the lands southeast of the Chattahoochee were occupied by the Creek Nation of Indians and those north west of that river by the Cherokee Nation. Where Atlanta now stands was a densely wooded wilderness. It is a fact not generally known that this pan of Georgia was still Indian country for many years after states farther west were thickly settled by the white people.\n\nAtlanta is situated in a strip of territory that was long a debatable land between the Creeks and Cherokees and in which occurred many conflicts between their war bands. Toward the end of the eighteenth cemury the boundary between these tribes became fixed, largely as the result of several treaties with the United States government. The Cherokees occupied the country north and west of the Blue Ridge, the Chestaice River and the Chattahoochee River down to a place called Buzzard's Roost not far from Austell. By the treaty of Fort Jackson in 1814 the Creek Jndians ceded all their lands northeast of the Hightower Trail, and out of these lands were cre ated Rabun, Habersham. Hall. \\Valton and Gwinnett Countics-\n\nThe Hightower Trail is a path or pony road extending from the Etowah (or \"Hightowcr\") River in northwestern Georgia southeastwardly to High Shoals on the Appalachce River. This trail may still be described, and parts of it are still used as a road. It is the boundary between DeKalb and Gwinnctt Counties. It crosses the Chattahoochee River at the shallow ford near Roswell and runs through the northern part of Fulton County and along or quite near the southwestern edge of Grogan's District. It passes a little to the cast of Stone Mountain and down into Newton County whence it bends northeastwardly until it reaches High Shoals. Dur ing the Indian times it was one of the principal highways for travel and traffic in this part ol Georgia. Connecting with it was the Stone Mountain Trail which ran through what is now Decatur and Atlanta to the Standing Peachtree on the Chattahoochee River and thence across into the Cherokee Country.\n\nOn January 8, 1821, by the treaty at Indian Spring the Creek Indians ceded all their lands between the Chattahoochee and Ocmulgee Rivers up to the Hightowcr Trail, and out of part of this territory was created the county of Henry, xvhich has been carved up into several coun ties. In 1822 a part was taken to create DeKalb County. On December 20, 1853. Fulton County was created out of part of DeKalb County and now consists of the fourteenth and seventeenth districts of Henry County and parts of the fourteenth district of Faycttc and the sixth district of Gwinnetl County.\n\nIn 1821 the Creek Indians moved from what is now Fulton and DeKalb Counties, but the Cherokees still inhabited the country on the northwest side of the Chattahoochcc River until about 1835 when they were removed to Oklahoma by the United States Government.\n\nIn 1836 a law was passed by the General Assembly of Georgia for the building of the West ern and Atlantic Railroad from the Tennessee line near Rossville to the soulhcastem bank ol the Chattahoochee River, and if it had not been amended its terminus would have been near Standing Peachtree: but. by an act passed December 23. IS37, its terminus was fixed at a point in DeKalb County not more than eight miles southeast of the Chaitahoochce River, \"as shall be most eligible for the running of branch roads thence to Athens, Madison. Milledgevillc. Forsyth and Columbus.\" It is stated in the \"History of Atlanta and Its Pioneers\" by the Pioneer Society that Colonel Stephen H. Long, the chief engineer of the railroad, drove a stake in mark the terminus in the year 1837. This was the beginning of what is now Atlanta. This spot is nowmarked by a stone post in the northeast part of the Union Depot near the corner of Central Avenue and Wall Street.\n\nUntil this time the country now surrounding Atlanta was very sparsely inhabited. Chamer Humphries built the \"Whitehall Tavern\" at the corner of Park Street and Whitehall Street (now Peters Street) in the early eighteen-thirties. A few families such as the Colliers, Jetts, Poolcs, Thurmonds. Littles. Connallys. Montgomery's and others occupied lands in the surround ing country. Hardv Ivy built the first house in what is now Atlanta on land lot 51 in the vear 1835.\n\n30\n\n1837 --ATLANTA C E x T E N x i A L--1937\n\nThe land whereon is now situated Atlanta and its environs was recogni/ed by the railroads as a strategic point. Jt was already the place where the wagon roads from Stone Mountain, Decatur and Hog Mountain crossed and debouched for Newnan, Sandtown and Marietta. But the vicinity of Atlanta had also been recognized by our Indian predecessors as the proper place for their principal town in the northern part of their domain. Suwannee Old Town was a village near the present town of Suwannee in Gwinnett County. Sandtown and Buzzard's Roost were lower down the Chattahoochee. There were other important places farther south. But the town of Standing Peachtree was the most noted Indian settlement in this part of Georgia. It was a strategic point for travel and for trading with the Indians. Only licensed traders were permit ted to enter the Indian country or traffic with them. This business assumed large proportions. As early as 1741 there were 46 licensed traders at Augusta trading with the Creeks and 49 others from South Carolina trading through Augusta with the Creeks and Chickasaws. (See White's His\n\ntorical Collections, page 600.)\n\nThere were others trading with the Cherokees. This traffic continued until the Indians were removed from Georgia. Standing Peachtree was favorably located for trade not only with the Creeks but with the Cherokees across the river. Canoes and boats plied up and down the river to the other villages and there were trails or paths along the river.\n\nThe village or \"town\" ot Standing Peachtree was situated at or quite near the location of the present \"River Pumping Station\" of Atlanta Waterworks, on lands now belonging to the City of Atlanta and the heirs of Mrs. Martha Howell Lyon and the estate of Thomas Moore, on land lots 242, 231, 232, 219, 220 of the seventeenth district of originally Henry now Fulton Coun ty. It very likely extended along the southeast bank of the Chattahoochee River for some dis tance north and south of Peachtree Creek and back castwardly along Peachtree and Nance's Creeks. Nance's Creek empties into Peachtree Creek about a half mile above the mouth ol Peachtree Creek. The old Peachtree Road (now called the \"Moore's Mill Road\") crosses Peachtree Creek on land lot 220 about a mile from Bolton near Moore's Mill, which is situated on Peachtree Creek a short distance above the junction of the two creeks. There was a large Indian mound where the pumping station is now situated.\n\nThe old ferry landing of the \"Montgomery Ferry\" is on the bank of the Chattahoochee River in land lot 242, about a half mile north of the mouth of Peachtree Creek. It is now filled up by a large sand bank. On the river bank on the south side of the landing is an immense syc amore tree and on the north side a small branch runs into the river. At this landing the Indians\n\nand traders crossed the Chattahoochee before the settlement of the country by the white men.\n\nOn December 25, 1837, an act was passed by the General Assembly to authorize James M. C. Montgomery to establish a public ferry \"across the Chattahoochec River, upon his own land, in the counties of DeKalb and Cobb, at a place known by the name of the Standing Peachtree.\" The act of the General Assembly is on pages 112 and 113 of the published laws of 1837.\n\nThe land records of DeKalb County were nearly all destroyed by the fire which burned the court house in Decatur in 1842 and the deeds to James M. C. Montgomery can not be found, but it is a notorious fact that he owned the land on both sides of the river and operated this ferry until his death. His will was probated at the November term 1842 of DeKalb County Inferior Court and is of record in Book A, page 14. He willed to his son H. B. T. Montgom ery and his daughter Rhoda \\arcissa Brown \"all my land on both sides of the Chattahoochee River and Peachtree Creek adjacent to and joining the river\" (with the exception of certain lands named in Item 5), including \"saw mill, grist mill and ferry.\"\n\nTo the Standing Peachtree led a network of Indian trails before the white man came. It was the terminus of the Peachtree Trail and the Stone Mountain Trail and one of the objectives of the Sandtown Trail. The Peachtree Trail ran along the top of the Chaltahoochee ridge from near Toccoa to Buckhead, where it divided: one branch continuing by way of what are nowcalled the Pace's Ferry and Moore's Mill Roads to Standing Peachtree; but the other branch led southward from Buckhead across Peachtree Creek and struck the Sandtown trail at Five Points in what is now Atlanta. And when the Cherokee country was opened to settlement by the white men the principal crossing place in this part of Georgia was at Standing Peachtree. The canvas-covered wagons swarmed along the Old Peachtree and Stone Mountain trails to occupy the new lands in northwest Georgia.\n\nIn the State surveys of 1821 the Indian trails are delineated in the seventeenth district (that is north of Eighth Street) but not in the fourteenth district south thereof. The trail along the North Decatur and Marietta Roads (afterwards called the Montgomery Ferry Road) is shown\n\n1837-- ATLANTA C E x TE xx A L-- 1937\n\n31\n\nand also the Peachiree trail (which divided at Buckhcad), but the Sandtown trail through Five Points in Atlanta and out Whitehall and Peters Streets and Cascade Avenue is not indicated.\n\nThis old Sandtown trail was one of the historic roads of this part of Georgia. It is unfor tunate that its name southwest of Atlanta has been changed to Cascade Avenue. That part in Dccatur is now called Atlanta Avenue. It runs, generally, along the Georgia Railroad and en ters Atlanta under the name of DeKalb Avenue and runs along Decatur Street to Peachtree Street: thence it follows Peachtree and Whitehall Streets to Mitchell Street; thence diagonally to the corner of Forsyth and Peters Streets and thence out Peters Street to Gordon Street, out Gor don Street to Cascade and follows the latter road through Fulton and into Campbell County.\n\nOn July 9, 1832, the Inferior Court of DeKalb County ordered that a road be opened up from Hardy Pace's settlement on Nance's Creek to J. A. D. ChildresY (Place) on the Sandtown Road.\n\nOn September 3, 1838, the Inferior Court ordered that \"a route for a road as lately marked out by Hardy Ivy, Benjamin Little, Benjamin Thurman and Hosea Maner be opened out and kept up as one of the public roads of said county, said road commencing at the Sandtown Road near the southern terminus of the Western & Atlantic Railroad and intersecting the Nelson's Ferry Road near Reid's Shantee.\" The writer has never been able to trace this road satisfactor ily. The terminus of the railroad was then as now at the present Union Depot at Wall Street and Central Avenue. But the writer has found no one who knows where Reid's shanty was. He has always understood that the Nelson's Ferry Road was coincident with the present Nelson Street and thence extended out Greensferry Avenue and the West Hunter Street Road to the Adamsville Road formerly known as the \"Lickskillet\" Road and thence to Nelson's Fern-, afterwards Green and Howell's Ferry on the Chattahoochee River. He hazards the guess that the new road laid out in 1838 began at Five Points and ran along Marietta Street to Magnolia Street and thence out Magnolia Street and West Hunter Street Road to the Adamsville Road. This may be a mistake. It is a fact attested by the Pioneer's History that Terminus had six roads: the Decatur. Marietta. Peachtree, Whitehall and McDonough Roads and a road from the Marietta Road along Magnolia and \\Vesi Hunter Streets to the Green and Howell's Ferry Road.\n\nBut let us leave the realm of speculation and return to that of proven facts.\n\nDuring the War of 1812 between the United States and Great Britain the Creek Indians were in alliance with the British. To hold them in check and prevent their depredations upon the white settlements a line of forts was built by the authorities of the State of Georgia. One of these was \"Fort Peachtree,\" situated on a high hill or promonotory just north of the mouth o( Peachtree Creek in the angle between the creek and Chattahoochee River. The top of the hill was leveled off and it is said that a fort or stockade was erected of logs. At the present time there is no vestige of the stockade, and the top of the hill has grown up in large trees. But the large level spot on the top of the hill is a sufficient indication that it was once occupied. At the for ward end nearest the river is an old breastwork or rifle pit. No one seems to know whether it is a relic of old Fort Peachtree or of the War between the States. When General Sherman sought to break into Atlanta in 1864 the hills on the southeast side of the Chattahoochee River were fortified. The prow of this hill overhangs the river and gives the impression of a small Gibral tar. Up this steep side steps have been dug and rude pieces of flat stone placed on them. These steps have the appearance of great age. The top of the hill is thus easily accessible.\n\nIn the War of 1812 George R. Gilmer, afterwards Governor of Georgia, was placed, as a young lieutenant, in charge of a detachment of soldiers, who occupied Fort Peachtree. In his book \"Georgians\" he stales: \"My appointed station was on the banks of the Chattahoochee about thirty or forty miles beyond the frontier, near an Indian town, not far from where the Georgia (meaning the Western ic Atlantic) Railroad now crosses the Chattahoochee River . . . A few days after my arrival at the standing peachtree a ruffian Indian fellow came into the camp with some fine catfish for sale.\" He also speaks of \"a meeting of the chiefs of the Standing Peachtree, and two or three chiefs of the neighboring villages.\" See pages 253, 25-1, 235, and 257.\n\nSherwood's Gazetteer, published 1829, states on page 103 that the town of Decatur was \"95 miles northwest of Milledgeville, 25 miles southwest of Lawrenceville, 9 miles southwest of Rock Mountain and 12 miles east of Standing Peachtree on the Chattahoochee.\"\n\nIn a signed newspaper article dated October 11, 1910, Mr. Robert C. Alston, of Atlanta, quotes these passages from Gilmer and Sherwood as evidence that the name borne by Peachtree Road is historic and not merely fanciful or traditional.\n\n32 _______1837-ATLANTA C EXTE N x i A L-1937__________\n\nDr. Lucian L. Knight quotes these passages from Gilmer's \"Georgians\" and \"Sherwood's Ga zetteer\" in his \"Georgia's Landmarks, Memorials and Legends.\"\n\nIt will be noted that the name is spelled \"peachtree\" in both of these citations.\n\nThe Peachtree Road and Peachtree Creek took their names from \"The Standing Peachtree\"; either from the village or from the tree for which the village was named.\n\nHow did the place, the creek and the road acquire this peculiar name?\n\nThere is a j>ersistent tradition that the name was derived from a tall pine tree near the mouth of the creek, the sides of which had been blazed by the Indians to obtain rosin or pitch; hence the name \"pitch tree\" which became corrupted into \"peachtree.\" The writer has heard it said that this \"pitch tree\" was on the top of the high hill where the fort was located and was such a prominent landmark that it could be seen for a great distance.\n\nMiss Virginia Hardin, whose grandfather was the first clerk of the Superior Court at McDonough in Henry County and served as a soldier at Fort Peachtree, says that he stated that it was his understanding that the name was derived from a pitch tree. Hon. Thomas H. Jcffries, now Ordinary of Fulton County, who was reared in that neighborhood, says that Hiram Casey, one of the earliest settlers and for many years justice of the peace and for whom the district was long called Casey's District, told him that the name was derived from a pitch tree. And ihat such was the derivation has been occasionally stated in newspaper articles.\n\nThe State surveys made in 1821 and now in the office of the Secretary of State call the creek \"Peachtree\" Creek.\n\nThe oldest reference to \"Peachtree\" on any of the County records is on page I of the min utes of the Inferior Court of DeKalb County of May 20, 1823: \"That a road leading from the standing peachtree to Gwinnett County (known by the Hog Mountain Road) be a public road and that the same be put and kept in repair.\" As DeKalb County was organized in 1822, this is proof that this road (which can be none other than the old Peachtree Trail or Road) existed before the white people acquired the lands from the Indians.\n\nOn the same page is an order, \"Ordered that there be a new road cut out from the Peachtree the nearest and convenicntesi route to intersect the boundary line at or near Sandtown.\"\n\nOn March 26, 1828, the Inferior Court ordered \"That the road be opened and cleared out from the three mile post leading from Decatur towards the peachtree to the Peachtree Road at or near James Hooper's on said Peachtree Road.\"\n\nOn November 25, 1829. it was \"Ordered that a road be opened and cleared out from the standing Peachtree to Leonard Hornsby's and kept up as a public road as has been marked out by Hiram Buckley, Wesley Martin and Llndsey Elsbcrry.\"\n\nThe minutes of November 1, 1841, show that the Peachtree Road was open at \"Williams' Gin\" at that time.\n\nIt will be noted that the name is spelled \"peachtree\" in all these records.\n\nAtlanta's earliest lawyer was Leonard C. Simpson, a gentleman of high character and ability. He xvas the father of Mr. F. M. Simpson who was for many years \"City Investigator\" in the office\n\nof the City Attorney. Mr. Simpson told the writer that his father had been a member of the Georgia Guard xvho removed the Indians from Georgia, and that his father told him that the Peachtree Creek and Road took their names from a large seedling peach tree of the red Indian variety which stood near the bank of the creek and whose immense size made it an object of mark. Mr. Simpson said that his father took cuttings from the tree and planted them in his garden, and that he (F. M. Simpson) still had some of the descendants of that tree in his garden in At lanta. This was about thirty years ago. The writer has always regretted that he did not get some cuttings from Mr. Simpson.\n\nHon. Franklin P. Rice was one of Atlanta's most distinguished citi/ens. He was a boy of seven years when his parents settled in Atlanta in 1849. He had a very versatile and retentive mind, stored with all sorts of information. He told the writer that Burch Jett. who was a hunter and trapper in this county before the Indians left, told him that Peachtree Creek was named for a \"clump of peach trees\" near the place where the creek was crossed by the Peachtree Road.\n\nBut there is the evidence of an eye-witness which cannot be criticised as hearsay or tradition. On April 25. 1897, Mr. Robert Adamson, who was then on the staff of the Atlanta Constitution, published an interview with Mr. George Washington Collier, called \"Wash\" Collier, who was then Atlanta's \"oldest inhabitant.\" Mr. Collier was born in 1813 and in 1823 moved with his father Meredith Collier to lands which his father bought on Peachtree Road between Atlanta\n\n_________________1837 - A T L A X T A C E X T E X X 1 A L - 1937\n\n33\n\nand Pcachtree Creek. At the time of his death in 1903 Mr. Collier was one of the largest land owners in Fulton County. He owned the Aragon Hotel, the building at Five Points on Peachtree Street between Edgewood Avenue and Decatur Streets, the lands where Anslcy Park is now situated and numerous other lands. From Mr. Adamson's interview I take the following cxccrpt:\n\nAfter they began to build a town at Decatur a new era began in \\Vash Collier's life. He got the contract for cam-ing the mails between Decatur and Altoona, Georgia. He made the trip iwice a week back and forth, carrying the heavy mail bags on his shoulder and nearly all the lime covering the entire distance on foot. Nothing better illustrates the hardy and determined character of the man than the fact that through rain and wind and snow and sleet he never missed a trip, never lost a letter, never had a complaint made against him.\n\nThose trips between Altoona and Decatur!\n\nRough pilgrimages they were, calling forth all the bravery and fortitude of the pioneer's nature.\n\n\"The nearest post office to this place then,\" said Mr. Collier, \"was Standing Peachtree.\"\n\n\"Standing Peachtree?\" I asked. The old fellow laughed merrily.\n\n\"Yes; Standing Peachtree,\" he said. \"I thought you'd ask that. There's nobody around here could tell you about that. Jonathan Xorcross couldn't, and yet ihey call Jonathan the oldest citi/en.\"\n\n\"Maybe you never heard of Standing Peachtrec? You don't know where Peachtree Street got its name do you?\"\n\n\"Peachtree Creek, I should say.\"\n\nHe laughed again. \"But where did Peachtree Creek get its name? Maybe \\oifd like to know that. Jonathan Xorcross couldn't tell you that.\n\n\"This is the way it was: Standing Peachtree post-office was right where Peachtree Creek runs into the Chattahoochee--right where the pumping station is now. It was noi Peachtree Creek then--they called it some Indian name. There was a great huge mound of earth heaped up there --big as this house, maybe bigger--and right on top of it grew a big peach tree. It bore fruit and was a useful and beautiful tree. But it was strange that it should grow up there on top of that big mound, wasn't it? And so they called the post-office out there Standing Peachtree. and the creek they begun to call Peachtree Creek. I've passed it many and many a time going on u'ith my mails. There's nothing remaining of it now.\"\n\nIt would seem that this ought to settle the question. It does settle the fact that the creek and the road and the post-office took their names immediately from the peach tree. From the pecu liarity of its location on top of the mound one might infer that it was planted there. And it may have been planted there because the place was already known as \"Peachtree.\" And that name may have been a corruption of the words \"pitch tree.\" And there may have been at an earlier period a great pine tree on the top of the hill beyond the creek, bla/ccl by the hatchets of the Indians and visible for miles around, and after its decay and death it may have been super seded by the peach tree on top of the Indian Mound. There is the tradition in favor of it. But for lack of any further definite information, the writer adopts the view that the peach tree de scribed by Mr. Collier was the origin of the name. Peach trees have been known to reach sev enty years of age in the United States and there is an instance in France of a peach tree 95 years old.\n\nWhat was the original Indian name no one appears to know. Perhaps some future anti quarian may discover it.\n\nIt was \"Peachtree\" in 1812 and in 1818 and 1823 and 1830 and 1837. The name is more than 115 years old. How much older we do not know. Evidently it was given after the traders began to filter through the Indian country from Augusta and Charleston. And it was probably a place of importance long before the traders named it.\n\nThe same geographical reasons that made \"Standing Peachtree,\" within three miles of the present limits of Atlanta, the principal Creek town in this neighborhood and the chief trading post for the early traders have made Atlanta the great metropolis of the Southeast.\n\nThe Indian mound at Standing Peachtree has long ago vanished. If there were any remnants they were destroyed in constructing the pumping station and the Seaboard Air Line Railway. There are no descendants of the peach tree in the vicinity.\n\n34______________1837 - A T L A X T A C E X T E X X I A L - 1937________________\n\nPerhaps the writer attaches too much importance to the origin of a mere name. But it has become a matter of interest to him because this old Indian peach tree (or pitch tree) gave its name to the Indian town near the site of Atlanta which was the metropolis of the Creeks long before Atlanta was ever thought of and which preceded \"Whitehall,\" \"Terminus,\" \"Marthasvills\" and \"Atlanta\"; which gave name to the creek on whose banks was fought one of the noted battles in the War Between the Slates; and for which was named the most famous business and residential highway of Atlanta.\n\nATLANTA'S FIRST PHYSICIAN\n\nBy FRANK K. BOLAXD, M. D.. JUXE, 1933-\n\n; OR the past three years a committee appointed by the Medical Association of Geor gia has been compiling a History of Medicine in Georgia, and is still engaged in the arduous task. Among the facts which the committee is endeavoring to ascertain is the name of the first physician to settle in each community or town in the state. This information is taken to mark the beginning of medicine as a profession in each\n\nlocality, although it is understood that some form of amateur medicine and midwifery had to be practiced before the arrival of one calling himself a regular physician. The general assembly passed an act in 1825 appointing a board of medical examiners to examine applicants for li cense to practice, but it is recognized that for many years there were doctors, and sometimes good doctors, who practiced medicine without a license. Some of these men, and some of those who held a license, had graduated from a medical college, while many others had only \"read\" medi cine under some older practitioner.\n\nIn a series of articles entitled \"Makers of Atlanta Medicine,\" by Dr. J. L. Campbell, pub lished in the Bulletin of the Fulton County Medical Society in 1929, it is stated that in 1842, in order for a resident of Terminus to secure the services of a physician, it was necessary to travel to Marietta or Decatur. As is well known by students of Atlanta history, Marietta and Decatur were joined in those days by a stage-coach route. Dr. T. J. Collier, who lives today at 1781 Peachtree Road, near Peachtree Station, says that the old roadway of this stage-coach line can still be discerned in his back yard. How this route missed our present Five Points!\n\nIn the opening chapter of the papers written by Dr. Campbell, he tells us that Dr. Joshua Gilbert was the first physician to practice medicine in Atlanta. The descendants of Dr. Gilbert, and many other Atlanta citizens, have always known this to be true, but certainly the fact has not been given publicity in recent years. It was natural for Dr. Campbell to be interested in the matter, since he always has evinced a lively interest in medical history, and originally hailed from Hapeville, near the home of some of the Gilbert family.\n\nThe first doctor to locate in the territory now known as Fulton County was Dr. William Gil bert, grandfather of Dr. W. L. Gilbert, at present practicing in Atlanta, and a member of the Board of County Commissioners. This pioneer moved to this section about 1830, and settled on the Campbellton Road, to serve the thinly populated sections around old Utoy, Mount Gilead and Mount Zion churches. He rode for many miles on horseback to reach these scattered neighborhoods. Carrying his equipment in his saddlebags, he dispensed medicine to the sick and comfort to the dying. Just before the civil war Dr. Gilbert moved to Atlanta and formed a partnership with his brother, Dr. Joshua Gilbert.\n\nIt is interesting that Dr. Joshua Gilbert and Dr. Crawford W. Long, the discoverer of anes thesia, were born the same year, and Dr. Long also practiced in Atlanta, but only for one year, 1850. Long did not think Atlanta offered much promise as a place to raise and educate his grow ing family, so he moved to Athens.\n\nJoshua Gilbert was born in Clcmson County, South Carolina, September 17, 1815. He \"read\" medicine for a short time with his brother, then attended the Augusta Medical College, now the Medical Department of the University of Georgia, where he graduated in 1845. He\n\n1837 --ATLANTA C E x TE x x i A L -- 1937\n\n35\n\nsettled in Atlanta to practice medicine the same year. Judge John D. Humphries is authority [or the statement that our present Atlanta was called Marthasville in 1843, and became the town of Atlanta in 1845, and was chartered as the City o Atlanta in 1847.\n\nOur boasted \"Atlanta spirit\" seems to have had a natural, spontaneous origin. At a time \\vhen railroads were new, and aroused great enthusiasm and hope for the future, three different\n\nroutes for the \"iron horse\" consummated their entrance into the little village within a period of four years. The Western and Atlantic Railroad from Chattanooga was finished in 1842, the Georgia Railroad from Augusta arrived in 1845. and the Central of Georgia from Macon and Savannah came in 1846. Such epochal events, so closely timed, engendered civic pride and spirit which have endured to the present day. Widespread attention was attracted, and the town\n\ngrew and developed rapidly, so that Joshua Gilbert was the sole physician for only six months. The next to arrive was Dr. Stephen T. Biggers, and soon many others followed, to help start\n\nAtlanta toward becoming a medical center.\n\nFor many years the name of Josh Gilbert was a by-word in this part of Georgia. He was a typical example of the doctor of the old school, well versed in the medical lore of the day, not\n\nlearned in the science of medicine, but. knowing a great deal about the an of medicine, with out which knowledge no modern doctor of today can achieve the greatest success in practice. A newspaper account of his death in 1889 (the same year that Henry Grady died) says that Dr. Gilbert built a home on the ground where the old state capitol stood, the present site of. the\n\nWestern Union building, Marietta and Forsyth streets. He put up an office on Marietta street, between Broad and Forsyth streets. He practiced his profession until a few years before his death, but, after the civil war, left Atlanta and moved eight miles into the country near the\n\nCampbellton road.\n\nDuring the early part of his professional career Dr. Gilbert was the leading physician of\n\nAtlanta, certainly the most popular, so described by Dr. G. G. Smith in Martin's \"Atlanta and Its Builders.\" He rode either horseback or in his little sulky, carrying his saddlebags and com\n\npounding his own medicine. Dr. W. L. Gilbert recalls his finelooking uncle, and asserts that he could roll the biggest bluemass pills he ever saw. He carried a whistle with him on his rounds, and would stand on the corner and blow to let people know that the doctor was about and would not be that way again that day. He kept no books, and never presented a bill, al though he appeared to prosper in worldly goods. Joshua Gilbert fulfilled the idea in those days of a \"natural born doctor,\" and was loved and esteemed by all who knew him.\n\nIn 1854 Atlanta began to be a medical center, when three medical institutions were estab\n\nlished, the Atlanta Medical College, the Atlanta Medical and Surgical Journal, and the first medical society, known as the Brotherhood of Physicians. The college and the society were formed by Dr. J. G. \\Vcstmoreland, and the journal was started by J. G. Wesimoreland and his brother, for. W. F. Westmoreland, Sr. Also the first fee bill and Code of Ethics was published the same year. This document was signed by fourteen physicians, who might be called the Apostles\n\nof Atlanta Medicine.\n\nThey were:\n\nX. D'Alvigny, M. D.\n\nJas. F. Alexander, M. D.\n\nJosiah A. Floumoy, M. D. H. A. Ramsay, M. D. Joshua Gilbert, M. D.\n\nHayden Coe. M. D. T. C. H. Wilson, M. D.\n\nX. L. Angier, M. D. J. G. Westmoreland. M. D.\n\nW. T. Grant. M. D.\n\nB. M. Smith, M. D.\n\nThos. Denny, M. D. H. Westmoreland, M. D. J. M. Damall. M. D.\n\nDr. Gilbert was not connected with the medical college, but he was a member of Atlanta's\n\nper mile.\n\nAtlanta's first physician practiced medicine in 1845 almost as it had been done for manyhundreds of years before. It had been shown that quinine would cure malaria, but nothing was known about the mosquito conveying the disease, a fact which was not discovered until 1S97. About the only equipment possessed by Dr. Gilbert which was not in the armamentarium of the Father of Medicine, Hippocrates, who lived 400 B. C., was the stethoscope, and it is doubtful if Joshua Gilbert used it regularly. He did know that vaccination would prevent smallpox, but there xvas no law requiring vaccination, and the disease killed many people in Atlanta even in\n\nthe eighties and nineties.\n\n36_________\n\nI 837 - A T L A X T A C E X T E X X I A L - 1937________\n\nAnd what could the Father of Atlanta Medicine know about prophylaxis in the scourge of child-bed fever? Antisepsis was not announced by Lord Lister until 1867, so there could be no safe surgery in 1845. Appendicitis was not described by Fitz until 1886, but it must have existed in Atlanta in Gilbert's early practice. Of course it was not diagnosed as appendicitis, and if it had been, nobody would have been able to treat it successfully. Altogether, medical science has added thirty-five years to the span of human life since the war between the states, due to the discoveries of the past ninety years, and to the brilliant progress in the treatment of the diseases of children, which saves so many babies in the first years of life.\n\nSo, all the more honor to Joshua Gilbert and the magnetic type of old-time practitioner he represented, for laboring so courageously under such handicaps! If he was not acquainted with science, he had an almost equally valuable asset in his knowledge of human nature. If he could not bring healing into the sickroom, he could bring comfort and cheer, which too often is all we can today. He held the confidence of his patients as much as the medical pro fession does in the present generation, and sometimes perhaps to a greater degree.\n\nDr. Gilbert's distinction as being the first physician to practice medicine in Atlanta was commemorated by the Fulton County Medical Society, September 17. 1932, the 117th anniver sary of his birth, by placing a wreath on his grave in Utoy Church cemetery. At the same lime a wreaih was placed on his wife's grave by the Woman's Auxiliary of the Society.\n\nA SHORT HISTORY OF THE PARISH OF THE IMMACULATE CONCEPTION IN ATLANTA, GEORGIA\n\nTO WHICH IS ATTACHED THE PARISH REGISTER OF BAPTISMS.

Kirby appear on the records. During this period the names of Haverty, Stephens, Gatins. Lagomarsino. appear. One of the found ers of the \"Atlanta Herald,\" St. Clair Abrams. is noted as a sponsor during this era.\n\nOn November 7lh. 1871, ihe name of Reverend J. B. Duggan appears as pastor, he having on that date baptised Edward, son of John and Mary Lagomarsino.\n\nThe first record of a marriage in the city of Atlanta is that of Michael Bloomfield and Eli/abeth Malonc, performed January 20th, 1851, by Rev. J. F. O'Xeill, although it was pre ceded by several marriages performed in other counties which were parts of the parish such as that of Owen Lynch in Cass County, and Bartholomy O'Bricn and Adeline Kirkpatrick at the same place on August IIth, 18-16. that of Oliver Wrighi and Ellen Riordan in Murray County in 1848. Patrick Mansfield and Xancy Watson in Allatoona on June 1st. 1848. Bernard McGiriley and Susannah Fitzgibbons in Cass County in December. 1847. Michael McCord and Miranda Turner and Pat Sullivan and Miss Turner in Fayette County in 1848. Robert Holliday and Man- Ann Fil/gerald in Fayette County on June Ifith, 1848.\n\nThe first official record of the parish of the Immaculate Conception is found on the Deed Records of DeKalb County (Atlanta was formerly in DeKalb County). On June 23rd. 1847. Terence Doonan conveyed by Warranty Deed to Ignatius A. Reynolds, Bishop of Charleston, Lot 4 in Block 17 in the City of Atlanta containing 1 acre for the purpose of erecting thereon a Catholic Church. On February 23rd, 1848. Daniel McShafFery deeded Lot 4 in BlocV 12 of Land Lot 77 of the 14th District containing one acre on the southeast comer of Loyd Street (now Central Avenue) and East Hunter Streets to I. A. Reynolds, as Bishop of Charleston, and his successors in office, for the purpose of erecting and maintaining a Catholic Church on it.\n\nIn 1848, Georgia was still a part of the bishopric of Charleston and ihe spiritual needs ol the widely scattered Catholic population were attended to by its Bishop. But in Atlanta Catholics were beginning to be found in sufficient numbers to warrant the establishment of a church.\n\nThe first parish record is dated 1846 as was noted above.\n\nThe original Catholic population of Atlanta was largely Irish with an admixture of Ger mans and some French. The names that are most often found on the early parish registers are those of the hardy pioneers who built and operated our first railroads.\n\nThe first mission priest was the Reverend John Barry, who offered up ihe first mass in the city in the home of either Patrick Lynch or * * McCullouch about 1845. He was succeeded by the Reverend Thos. F. Shanahan in 1849. The first resident priest came in 1850. He was\n\n38\n\n1837 - A T L A x T A CENTENNIAL- 1937\n\nFather J. F. O'Neill, Jr., and was pastor until April, 1859, succeeded by Father James Hasson who served from 1859 to May, 1861. White's Historical Collections (1854) gives the Catholic population of the town as being 250.\n\nDuring the late Civil War the priest was the Reverend Thomas O'Rcilly who is known most favorably as the person who persuaded General Sherman to spare the churches of the town when he burned the rest of the buildings in 1864. (See Pioneer History of Atlanta, pages 155-6). Father O'Reilly built the Church of the Immaculate Conception as it now stands and built the Convent of the Sisters of Mercy on Central Avenue. He established the first Cath olic school in the town.\n\nIn 1850, Georgia became a Bishopric, with its head at Savannah, and the allegiance of the ntw parish was transferred to that city. The progress of the parish until the Civil War was apparently satisfactory, though its growth was slow. At that time American Catholicism re lied almost entirely for its growth on foreign immigration, and except for Irish and German immigrants there were few in the South. During the Civil War there was a great growth of population in the city of Atlanta, and though almost all of the male members were enrolled in some branch of the service the parish continued to exist and hold its own under the charge of\n\nFathers Hasson and O'Rcilly.\n\nAfter the Civil War was over there was a long period during which the church did well to hold its own. No new people came South. The native population furnished no field for con versions. The people were poor and unable to give very great assistance to the church au\n\nthorities.\n\nDuring this period, stretching from 1865 to 1900, the parish consolidated its population. It was no longer an experiment, but a fixture. It had found who were the true and loyal Catholics in its midst. It had added some names to its roster, chief of which was that of the Spaldings, probably the oldest and most distinguished English Catholic family in the South. It had drawn to itself many of the Catholics scattered through the surrounding territory and who had been in danger of losing the faith through lack of attention.\n\nAround 1880 the new parish of the St. Peter and Paul, now Sacred Heart Parish, was de tached from the parish of the Immaculate Conception.\n\nDespite the loss of so much of its territory and population the parish has held its own. It now (1927) supports three priests and maintains its own school. Its pastor, the Reverend Emmett Walsh, has recently been raised to the Bishopric of Charleston, an honor which is most unusual for a priest of his age. Under Father Walsh the church's charitable and intellectual sides were stressed and in addition to this there was a great increase of devotion.\n\nThe following are the names of early Catholics in order of their appearance on the baptis\n\nmal register:\n\n1846: G.
