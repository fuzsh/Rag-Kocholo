        "text": "Source: History Morris County New Jersey, Volume II, Lewis Publishing Co., 1914\n\nWhile it adds nothing to the personal value of a man to be able to look back upon a long and honorable line of ancestors, it is most certainly a gratifying thing to be in a position to do so. In the case of Charles Fern HOPKINS, of Boonton, Morris county, New Jersey, this honorable line of ancestry lead up to an equally honorable record for himself, in which he ahs added a most decided manner to the prestige of the family.\n\nHis ancestors were of Mayflower stock in this country, and go back to 1554, in Coventry, England. They were famed for their military and naval service, the first admiral of the American navy was of the Hopkins line, as was the English admiral who had command of the British squadron at the Columbian naval parade in New York harbor in 1892. In intellect they were no less distinguished, and were fearless in the defense of rights and principles. Stephen HOPKINS, the fourteenth signer of the Mayflower compact in 1620, was the direct ancestor of three brothers who lived on one hundred and fifty years later. These were: Stephen HOPKINS, a lawyer who settled in Rhode Island and was one of the signers of the Declaration of Independence; Francis, an Episcopalian clergyman who settled in Hunterdon county, near what is now High Bridge, New Jersey; and Jonathan HOPKINS, a farmer who located in northern New Jersey, in what was then a part of Hunterdon county, was later Sussex, and is now the township of Parhaquarry, Warren county.\n\nNathan HOPKINS, son of Jonathan HOPKINS, married Esther DRYAL or DRIEL, and of their children - Esther married a Mr. SCHOOLEY. There were large estates left to them upon the early death of their parents, including fine farming lands between Hope and Belvidere, New Jersey. Their only son was Driel HOPKINS, who was an iron dealer and contractor in Warren county, New Jersey, where he owned and managed a large tract of land and was esteemed as a progressive and energetic business man. During the War of 1812, he supplied the government with large quantities of cattle, dealt extensively in iron and had large business interests in Philadelphia. Having been obliged to sell a considerable number of cattle at a loss upon the sudden termination of the war, he went to New York, where he was successful in importing goods and in the conduct of a hotel. He married (first) November 10, 1800, Sarah, born near Vienna, Warren county, New Jersey, December 10, 1785, daughter of James DANLEY. Her mother was at one time baking pies in an old Dutch oven which stood out of doors, when General Washington and his staff rode by. All pies that required filling, such as pumpkin, custard, etc., were filled by using a ling-handled wooden ladle, made of one piece of wood, from the bowl of which the filling was poured into the crust, which was previously placed in the oven. Washington requested the privilege of filling some of the pies, and when they were baked he and his staff feasted thereon. The old wooden ladle which he used is now in the possession of the subject of this sketch. Driel and Sarah (DANLEY) HOPKINS had children: Juliet L., a child which died unnamed, Jonathan, James, Caroline, Anderson, Amanda, Nathan, and Harrison. Driel HOPKINS married (second) 1824, Mary STRALEY, and had children: Esther, Huldah, Elizabeth, Mary Jane and Sorama.\n\nNathan (2) HOPKINS, son of Driel and Sarah (DANLEY) HOPKINS, was born in Succasunna, February 22, 1811, died November 13, 1889. He was apprenticed to learn the trade of harness making, and followed it for a period of sixty-four years, including his five years of apprenticeship, and during this time worked on the same bench at which his employer had learned his trade, and which had been used by him for fifty-nine years. In addition to this he was a hotel keeper for eight years, and the proprietor of a store for seven years. After many years of residence in Hope, New Jersey, he removed to Drakesville, now Ledgewood, in 1848. Eight years later he removed to Powerville, and in 1861 to Succasunna. He was first a Whig then a Republican, a strong anti-slavery man, whose home was a station on the famous \"underground railroad,\" by which many slave found their way to freedom. He acquired considerable wealth by his strict attendance to his business affairs. He married (first) June 1, 1834, Ann WILSON, daughter of John and Mary (BLAIR) WILSON, granddaughter of Robert and Betsy (GLASSINER) BLAIR, and great-granddaughter of Robert and Betsy BLAIR. (Second), 1856, Mrs. Ellen, widow of James KING. (Third), 1876 or 1877, Mrs. Mary HULL, a widow. Children: William Emmett, Sarah Rebecca, Abigail Gertrude, Caleb Swayze, Charles Fern, John Robertson, Elvie, Ella, Elmer Ellsworth, Winfield Scott.\n\nCharles Fern HOPKINS, son of Nathan (2) and Ann (WILSON) HOPKINS, was born in Hope, Warren county, New Jersey, May 16, 1842. His early life was the usual one of a boy in a country town and he attended the district schools for four months a year for a period of seven years. At the age of twelve years he commenced to learn the trade of harness making under the supervision of his father, completing his education in this line in a large harness manufacturing establishment in the city of Newark, New Jersey. In 1860 he established himself independently in business in Boonton, and has carried on this business uninterruptedly with the exception he spent in the service of his country during the Civil War. The excellent quality of his work as well as his efficient management of his business affairs have secured him a liberal patronage, and he has been in the harness business longer than any other man in the county. May 3, 1861, Mr. HOPKINS donned the blue as a defender of the Union, being the first man in Morris county to enlist for a period of three years. He was mustered in at Trenton, New Jersey, June 4, 1861, as a member of Company I, First New Jersey Volunteers, this being assigned to the famous Kearny's New Jersey brigade. He was in the first Bull Run campaign, the peninsular campaign, and the battle of Gaines' Mill, Virginia, June 27, 1862, carried Sergeant Richard A. Donnelly, late quartermaster-general of New Jersey, from the field under a terrible cross fire. Mr. HOPKINS had already been twice wounded, and was again badly wounded in the head after leaving Donnelly in a supposedly safe place. Later, however, both he and the sergeant were taken prisoners, and Mr. HOPKINS was reported among the dead. For his act of bravery in caring for his companion he was awarded the congressional medal of honor. He was not held a captive by the Confederates, and on account of his wound was sent to a Union hospital. As soon as possible he rejoined he regiment and at the battle of the Wilderness was again badly wounded and taken prisoner, only three days before the expiration of his term of enlistment. For more than ten months he was incarcerated, part of the time in Andersonville, Georgia, and the remainder of the time in Florence, South Carolina, and while a captive endured the hardships common to all whose misfortunes confined them in these prisons. He was honorably discharged at Trenton, NJ, April 21, 1865, and with a military record of which he may well feel proud, returned to his home and the pursuits of a peaceful life. In 1898 he was commissioned by acting Governor Voorhees, of New Jersey, to erect a monument at Andersonville, Georgia, in commemoration of the New Jersey soldiers who had died there.\n\nMr. HOPKINS married in Boonton, Morris county, NJ, January 8, 1867, Hetty Ann, daughter of Abraham B. and Caroline (MOWERSON) VAN DUYNE, who had other children: Elizabeth, John, Sophia, Harriet, Jacob, Peter and Mary, the last two being twins.

He served a four years' term in this office, was again appointed in 1892, serving until 1895, when he was removed as a partisan. He was however, reappointed in 1900-04-08-12. He was elected to the assembly of New Jersey in 1896, and served until 1898.
