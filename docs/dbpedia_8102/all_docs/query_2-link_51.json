        "text": "Did you know today is National Human Trafficking Awareness Day? There are so many organizations committed to change and advocacy and today, I get to highlight my favorite. If you know me, you've heard me talk about New Hope Girls and the incredible work they are doing. In their own words, New Hope Girls, is \"creating a refuge of light and life for girls and women from dark, difficult places and restoring identify and purpose for the future.\" Check out their website to learn more about their story. Ready to help push back darkness? Here are some ways you can help that cost you nothing but your time: ü¶ã Like, share or comment on this post. ü¶ã Go follow them on their social media channels. ü¶ã Read their story -- I posted it below for you! Ready to help in a financial way? Here are some great options: üõç Shop their beautiful, handmade bags. Did you know that purchasing one of these bags helps provide safe, honorable work for a woman in the Dominican Republic? üíµ Donate! You can set up one one-time or recurring donations. Right now, one of their greatest financial needs is the funding for an additional 11 caregivers. Each annual salary is $10,000. I invite you to take one step (big or small) today the fight against human trafficking. #createdformore #Wearblueday #humantraffickingawarenessday #endit‚ùå #enditmovement‚ùå https://lnkd.in/gCCxVaVe\n\nWe all need an elevator talk particularly so if we work in Philanthropy for Ultra-High-Net-Worth Clients. Here is mine. ‚ÄúI am a teacher, not a consultant. I offer questions, not answers. For example, do you have a soul? Can it be saved? I cannot tell you. I cannot save you. No one may have a soul. Perhaps none can be saved. Perhaps we and the world are doomed. Perhaps even colonizing Mars will come up empty. Let‚Äôs start with you and go from there.‚Äù Needless to say, I have no clients. I don‚Äôt have to take a vow of poverty, my process insures it. Would you save billionaires from themselves pro bono publico, if you could? Or would they have to pay you handsomely? If so, I would suggest you get paid a time based fee, independent of results. If your fee is a percentage of assets under management, saving the world will cost you big. #uhnwi #philanthropy\n\nWhat would you do to achieve your goals? How vulnerable are you willing to be when it comes to asking for help? And how open are you to being supported by others? This weekend, I spent some time filming with one of the ladies who has agreed to take part in my latest anthology: Owning Our Ovaries: Unleashing The Power From Within Her story is one of how she is taking on the system here in Canada in regard to regaining her life after her narcissistic abusive husband destroyed her, her reputation, her business and prevented her from being there for her kids. She knows that by taking part in this anthology that she is going to do a lot of deep healing with me, and with the other ladies taking part holding space for her. She knows that she is not the only woman going through what she has gone through, especially when it comes to racist laws that protect her white husband and prevent her, a black woman, from being heard - and protected from him. She also knows that due to his position of power, she has a long fight ahead of her, but she is rising, and she is fighting back; not just for herself and her sons, but because she is laying the foundation for other women - and men - to stand up and fight against injustice, corruption, abuse and racial inequality. So what were we filming? We were filming a short intro for her GoFund me page, so she can receive the coaching and narrative therapy healing from me as she writes her chapter. This is a woman who is doing whatever it takes to turn the negatives into positives, to be a beacon of hope for other women, and rebuild her life - which if you knew her starting point of recovery, you would know just how far she has already come. If you are a woman with a powerful story, and you would like to take part in the #OwningOurOvaries anthology, please send me a DM and tell me why you and your story should be considered, and to learn more about the project as a whole. And as always with my anthologies, all royalties will be going to relevant charities, so consider yourself investing in a #philanthropicproject with real women who have nothing to hide, and everything to give to others. P.S. To all those debating whether selfies should be 'allowed' on #LinkedIn, just know that some of us like to keep it real, without filters, without pretence and without hiding behind a mask or make up when doing business with people. With me, what you see is what you get, and if you don't like my selfies, just unfollow or disconnect from me. Simples! (as the meerkat from Compare the Market would say!) #shareyourstory #authoractivist #inspiringwomen #owningourovaries #authorcoaching #narrativetherapy #time2callDawn\n\nüåü In part 2 of this SheCentre: The Female Podcast series, we continue our enlightening conversation with Pumla Nabachwa as she answers the poignant question, \"What happened to you?\" üå∏ This episode delves deeper into Pumla's courageous journey with egg donation and the profound impact it had on her life. Pumla shares the emotional and physical challenges she faced, from her initial fear of needles to the pain and discomfort of the injections. She reflects on the social and academic disruptions she experienced and the profound realization that her donated eggs could lead to children with her DNA. Writing a heartfelt letter to potential future children, she describes the surreal and emotional process that made her commitment to helping other women even stronger. üí™‚ù§Ô∏è Despite the overwhelming process, Pumla donated eggs a second time, driven by her empathy for women struggling with fertility and the meaningful connections she had made. She discusses the emotional complexity of potentially meeting children born from her donations and the lasting impact on her family, especially her son. üë∂üíï In addition to her journey, Pumla shares her professional experiences as an economist with the Bank of Uganda. She discusses the challenges of working in a male-dominated field, facing imposter syndrome, and the importance of self-worth and confidence. Pumla emphasizes the power of mindset and the significance of choices in shaping one's destiny. üìäüåç Join us to hear Pumla's inspiring story and gain valuable insights into motherhood, empowerment, and overcoming societal and personal obstacles. Tune in to this powerful episode and be inspired by Pumla's resilience and wisdom. üéôÔ∏è‚ú® Listen here üëâüèæ https://lnkd.in/etEqVdtA #SheCentrePodcast #FemaleEmpowerment #EggDonation #IVFJourney #WomenInEconomics #Empowerment #Resilience #Motherhood #SelfWorth #MindsetMatters #Inspiration #ListenNow\n\nRefugees, stranger danger, climate change, who are our ancestors, what am I doing here, what does it mean to be human‚Äî what do these things have in common? Exile. A Nation In Exile is founded on the observation that we live in exile. Literally, relationally, from the land, our culture and ourselves. We believe there is a home after exile. We believe there are those who are doing the work of returning us home. We believe that we are the ones we have been waiting for. We just need opportunities to connect, witness, share space, share vision, and do the work. That‚Äôs why A Nation in Exile was born. That‚Äôs why so many people believe in it‚Äî because they can feel it. And that‚Äôs why we crowdfund, because we know everyone has a stake in this journey home. So consider donating today so we can continue our programming. Share the link to your networks. And let‚Äôs all walk each other home. bit.ly/ANIEFUND\n\nI came across this beautiful quote while reading the book ‚ÄòProvocateurs not Philanthropists: Turning Good Intentions into Global Impact‚Äô: ‚ÄúBeing in a community is a position of strength, trust, and mutual care.‚Äù It struck a chord and I wanted to share some thoughts on what it means to me. In a world where individualism is emphasized, we often forget the powerful and incredible force that comes from being a part of a community. Community isn‚Äôt limited to where we live and work - it‚Äôs about the connections we build, the bonds we share and the support we offer. STRENGTH: draws on the collective knowledge, skills and resources of a community. We are so much more powerful together than alone. TRUST: it takes some time to build trust in a community. Once established, trust fosters cooperation and collaboration, making incredible things possible. MUTAL CARE: communities at their core is about looking out for their members. It‚Äôs about celebrating victories and supporting one another through tough times. What makes a community truly special is kindness, empathy and compassion. My hope is that this week you take the time to appreciate the communities you‚Äôre a part of. Nurture your connections and build on the strength, trust and mutal care that makes your community thrive. I‚Äôd love to know how being part of a community has made a difference in your life. Share your stories in the comments. #communitymatters #strengthinunity #togetherwecan\n\nIn a world that often focuses on achievement and achievement, it is important to pause and extend our hearts to those who face daily challenges beyond their control. Mr. I Wayan Teken and his son bravely faced epilepsy, a condition that demands unwavering resilience and courage. Today, as we expand our Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) efforts, let's not forget the faces and stories behind the statistics. Let us remember Mr. I Wayan Teken and his son who are the embodiment of strength in adversity. Our support is more than just donations; it symbolizes a community standing together, offering hope and comfort in times of uncertainty. To Mr. I Wayan Teken and his son: may the universe bestow blessings of health and peace. Hopefully we can make visits every three months to make sure your condition is okay. Your perseverance inspires us all to embrace empathy and kindness, to create a world where every individual feels valued and supported. Together, let's continue to make a difference, not only in the lives of Mr. I Wayan Teken and his son, but also in the hearts of everyone who needs our compassion. Let's build a future where empathy is paramount, and no one walks the journey alone.
