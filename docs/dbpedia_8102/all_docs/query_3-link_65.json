        "text": "Lala Kent rose to fame as a reality star on the hit Bravo series Vanderpump Rules. She has published a memoir, started a podcast and launched a makeup line, but Lala's biggest job to date is being a mom to her daughter, Ocean Kent Emmett.\n\nLala shares Ocean with her ex-fiancé, film producer Randall Emmett, whom she met while working at SUR, the West Hollywood restaurant and lounge that serves as the backdrop and inspiration for Vanderpump Rules.\n\nThe Bravo star first announced her pregnancy in September 2020 on her podcast, Give Them Lala.\n\n\"For my 30th birthday I have the best gift given to me, my body also helped out too, I am pregnant,\" she revealed, adding, \"I'm, like, shaking right now because I can't believe that it's a real-life thing. I cry about everything but today it's very much happy tears.\"\n\nOcean was born on March 15, 2021, and Randall and Lala split shortly after her birth. Lala has been outspoken about raising Ocean as a single mom after the breakup, whether in interviews or on Instagram.\n\nIn 2022, the reality star talked about one day explaining \"negative stories\" about Randall to her daughter. \"No matter what, I am her mama — which means I will teach her the importance of being a good person,” Lala said on her Instagram Story. \"The world isn't ready for the force my daughter will become,\" she added.\n\nLala is currently expecting her second child — Ocean's third sibling alongside Randall's eldest daughters, London and Rylee.\n\nHere’s everything to know about Lala Kent’s daughter, Ocean Kent Emmett.\n\nShe was born in March 2021\n\nLala welcomed her daughter, Ocean, on March 15, 2021.\n\n\"It's the most beautiful time in my life,\" Lala told PEOPLE during a Bridgerton-inspired maternity photo shoot ahead of the birth. \"The entire experience, from my body changing and creating a miracle, to the way I have changed as a person. ... I have never been this excited for anything in my entire life.\"\n\nAfter Ocean’s birth, Lala posted on Instagram about how the little girl reminded her of her late father. “Ocean is beautiful. She looks like you through the eyes,\" Lala wrote, addressing her late dad Kent, who died in April 2018. \"I think I'm doing a pretty good job so far. I wish you could be here to see it.”\n\nLala picked her name before she was born\n\nBefore Lala and Randall even knew they were having a baby, they had decided on the name Ocean.\n\n\"It's different, but we think it's perfect for baby girl,” Lala told PEOPLE in 2021 before the baby's name was revealed. After Ocean was born, Lala said she’d had the name in mind for a while.\n\n“We knew that we were going to name our first baby — whether it was a boy or a girl — Ocean,” Lala told Entertainment Tonight in May 2021.\n\n\"I don't even know why this name didn't come up sooner but we were in the Bahamas three years ago, I walked past this yacht and it was called the Ocean Alexander, and I was like, 'Oh my God, the name Ocean, it has to be my baby's name,' \" she continued.\n\n\"Randall loved it and it made total sense for the name to be Ocean,” she added, noting that Ocean’s dad was “obsessed with the water,” and so was she.\n\nShe inspired a clothing line\n\nShortly after welcoming Ocean, Lala was inspired to start a clothing line for kids and babies.\n\nThe brand, called Give Them Lala Baby, follows the naming trend of Lala's business ventures: a beauty brand, podcast and memoir, all including the phrase \"Give Them Lala.\"\n\n“This is my passion project because it was inspired by my boo boo; creating gender-neutral, cozy basics for our little ones,” Lala wrote in a December 2022 Instagram post, showing appreciation for those who had supported her brand.\n\n“Looks, that when I started shopping for Ocean when I was pregnant, were very hard to find. So thank you for showing @givethemlalababy so much love. Ocean and I are so grateful,” she continued.\n\nShe motivates Lala to stay sober\n\nLala celebrated five years of sobriety in October 2023, and she credits her daughter as one of the reasons she stays sober.\n\n\"Sobriety's the best gift I've ever given to myself, and I can't allow my daughter to ever see that version of me,\" Lala told PEOPLE in September 2023.\n\n\"I'm approaching five years of sobriety and my daughter's 2½, so I stay sober obviously for me, because if you stay sober for someone else, that's just a recipe for relapse,\" she added.\n\nStill, Lala made it clear that she was motivated to stay sober so that Ocean would only know this version of her.\n\n\"To think about the fact that my child is always going to see me in this form and never under the influence, you can't put a price on that. I am very grateful I found sobriety when I did,\" Lala told PEOPLE.\n\nShe has two older sisters\n\nOcean is Lala’s first child, but she has two older sisters through her father: London and Rylee Emmett.\n\nLondon was born in February 2010 to Randall and his ex-wife, actress Ambyr Childers. They welcomed their second daughter, Rylee, in November 2013.\n\nRandall and Childers split in 2017, and Randall proposed to Lala a year later. Lala and Childers have had public disagreements over Lala sharing photos of London and Rylee on Instagram, but Lala has also talked about her respect for the girls' mother.\n\nSpeaking about Childers on the January 2022 episode of Watch What Happens Live, Lala said, “I feel like our road was very bumpy, as you know, and I can understand why. I have a lot of compassion for her.”\n\n\"I think she is a great woman and a great mom. I will be honest — I think she is the best thing that ever happened to that guy,” she added, referencing their shared ex, Randall.\n\nShe is going to be a big sister\n\nIn March 2024, Lala announced her second pregnancy after telling Cosmopolitan that she'd begun the process of conceiving a child via intrauterine insemination (IUI).\n\n\"I'm expanding my pod,\" the reality star wrote on Instagram alongside a photo of Ocean gazing at her baby bump.\n\nA month later, Lala revealed that she's expecting another baby girl.\n\n\"[Ocean] is so excited. My biggest thing is making sure that she knows she's not ever going to be replaced and that this is our baby,\" the soon-to-be mom of two told PEOPLE.\n\nShe’s best friends with Scheana Shay’s daughter, Summer Moon\n\nLala’s costar Scheana Shay had her daughter, Summer Moon, just a month after Ocean was born.\n\nThe best friends have gone on buddy trips with their daughters, including family outings to Disney and vacations in Las Vegas.\n\n“Girls trips to Vegas look a little different these days,” Shay captioned an October 2023 post on Instagram, picturing her, Lala and their daughters in a pool.\n\nSpeaking to PEOPLE about Summer in 2022, Shay's husband Brock Davies said their daughter was “like a mini-Scheana.” \"She is the absolute cutest,\" Shay added.\n\nLala has also spoken about how much she appreciates Davies’ relationship with Ocean.\n\n“The way that he is with Ocean is just like, ‘Oh my gosh,' ” Lala said in a February 2023 episode of Vanderpump Rules. “I’m so grateful because my kid is not gonna have that. At this point in time, I can not provide that for her. The fact that I have Brock for my child is just like the biggest blessing.”\n\nLala and Randall split in October 2021, and Lala alluded to raising Ocean as a single mom in an Instagram post the same month, writing, “It's you and me, baby.” They had initially planned to marry in April 2020 but postponed their wedding due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nShe’s obsessed with Monsters, Inc.\n\nFor Ocean’s 2nd birthday in 2023, Lala threw a Monsters, Inc.-themed party.\n\n“I wouldn’t have nothin’ if I didn’t have youuu! Ocean’s Monsters Inc. birthday party was everything and more,” Lala captioned an Instagram post showing off photos from the birthday bash. Lala had previously dressed Ocean up as Monsters, Inc. character Sully for a Halloween event in 2022.\n\nLala’s best friends and VPR costars Shay and Davies showed off their love for Ocean by both dressing up as Sully at the party. They dressed their daughter, Summer, as Boo.\n\n\"Ocean's 2nd bday party was BOOtiful! 💜\" Shay captioned her set of photos from the event.\n\nShay and Davies were also present for Ocean’s first birthday party a year earlier, alongside other Vanderpump Rules cast members."
