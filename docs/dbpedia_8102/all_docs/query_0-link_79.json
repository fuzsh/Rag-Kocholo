Mr. Bandy was about 76 years old at the time of his death, and having been a citizen of this county since he was 4 years old, was well known almost over the entire county. He was prominent in politics for a number of years, and was one of our most successful farmers. He lived to see Williamson County rise from a veritable wilderness to take her place among the foremost counties of the state. One by one our old pioneers are dropping off, but such men as Wilshire Bandy will long be remembered for their good traits of character and the part they have played in developing the best interests of the county–morally, religiously and financially. His family have requested that their heartfelt thanks be returned to the friends who were untiring in bestowing so many acts of kindness during the late illness of the lamented husband and father.\n\nPeggy Shock – Tuesday, January 04, 2000 at 12:44:24 (PST)\n\nCaroline Bell\n\nCaroline Bell was born in Sangamon County, Illinois April 13, 1830 and departed this earthly life August 31, 1930 at the age of 100 years, 4 months, and 18 days.

She was a devoted child of the Lord, always seeking to know and do his will. She was loved and esteemed by her people, her neighbors and her friends. Truly another mother in [Isreal?] has fallen and we submissively bow to the will of our gracious Lord. Of a life so long spent on earth volumes might be written and we who are left behind being two sons, two daughters, 27 grandchildren, 50 great grand and 15 great great grandchildren, many neighbors and friends who will truly miss her.\n\nWell have we loved thee, But God loved thee more, He has called thee away to That bright happy shore. Oh, call it not death, It is life begun, For the waters are passed, The Home is won. The ransomed spirit hath Reached the shore, Where they weep and sin no more, And safe in our Father’s home above, In the place prepared by the Savior’s love, To depart from a world of sin and strife, And to be with Jesus.

He was a farmer during his life, and after retiring came to live in Creal Springs 20 years ago. He became a child of God by that wonderful born again experience 60 years ago. All thru this three score years of Christian service he has lived a very consecrated Saint of Christ, always standing solid as a rock for what was Holy and right. He would not waver in the faith of God, and talking about the Lord was not only to his rejoicing but it added happiness to those he came in contact. He set examples and layed the pattern for sinners to turn from sin and go rejoicing to Heaven. After moving to Creal Springs, he attended the church of God where he was not only attentive, but loyal and a great blessing. These closing word in verse are exemplary of how this precious father and Child of the King lived. A loving father has gone to rest, Our loss is Heaven’s welcome guest. This precious saint from earth is gone, But his useful deeds will live on and on. He joined God’s army many years ago, With christ he marched thru the valley low. This soldier of christ leaves service well done, And his great reward is a crown well won. Dear firends and loved one, do now prepare, To meet this dear one in peace over there. If he was here that would be his plea– “Be Ready To Die, And Live Eternally”\n\nLinda Holmes White – Thursday, August 19, 1999 at 16:09:58 (PDT)\n\nBack to the top\n\nI\n\nLeon Issler\n\nBorn February 18, 1929 Marion, Illinois Passed Away At E.
