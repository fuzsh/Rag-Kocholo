        "text": "August 8, 2024\n\nNTT DATA Group Corporation\n\nTOKYO – August 8, 2024 - NTT DATA, a global digital business, and IT services leader, has launched a new white paper on the insurance industry, \"Embracing Insurance Core Modernization for Future-Readiness.\" This comprehensive analysis explores the significance of core modernization within the insurance sector and highlights ongoing initiatives driving operational efficiency and innovation. The publication also presents the company's recommendations based on its global approach. Below is a summary of NTT DATA's research and findings.\n\nIndustry Momentum\n\nThe insurance industry is at a pivotal moment, facing the dual challenges of outdated legacy systems and the need for rapid digital transformation. The economic fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic and the accelerating impacts of climate change have further intensified the need for modernization. Insurers are now more than ever under pressure to upgrade their core systems to enhance efficiency, reduce costs, and improve customer experiences.\n\nCore modernization involves updating and integrating legacy systems, outdated codes, and old technologies that hinder efficiency and innovation. By innovating products, implementing holistic strategies, and conducting educational campaigns, insurers are actively combating these challenges. Modernized core systems enable insurers to offer flexible, digitized products that boost system performance, reduce time to market, and improve productivity.\n\nNTT DATA Insights\n\nThe landscape for core modernization in the insurance sector experienced rapid development last year, and the trajectory for 2024 suggests a continuation of this trend. Insurers are delving into foundation models, intelligent applications, and cloud technologies to provide customers with new ways of value through contextualized experiences, personalized services, and integrated insurance solutions.\n\nKey technologies such as adaptive AI, industry cloud, and sustainable activities are being harnessed to revolutionize the financial model. These technologies can generate new forms of revenue outside traditional core businesses or directly monetize data within regulatory frameworks. Generative AI, composite AI, and hyper-automation are creating the underlying capabilities that insurers need to augment human decision-making and improve operational efficiencies.\n\n\"Nowadays, insurance companies face the critical challenge of modernizing their legacy systems to meet contemporary demands for enhanced functionality and faster service delivery. While traditional systems effectively handle their initial workloads, they fall short in incorporating advanced technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) for real-time decision-making and efficient data processing. Insurance Cloud Migration is key to addressing these shortcomings by leveraging cloud capabilities to transform and scale core systems effectively.\" said Bruno Abril, Head of Insurance in Europe and Latam at NTT DATA.\n\nConclusions\n\nThe shift towards modernized core systems represents a significant paradigm change within the industry, aligning operational practices with broader digital transformation goals. In a world grappling with the profound impacts of climate change and other systemic challenges, the insurance sector's dedication to upgrading its core infrastructure is becoming increasingly critical. Core modernization transcends mere technological upgrades; it signifies insurers' proactive efforts to embed innovation, agility, and resilience into their fundamental operations.\n\n\"Through our Insurance Cloud Migration strategy, NTT DATA is committed to empowering insurance companies to not only adapt to the current technological landscape but also to thrive in it, delivering superior customer experiences and maintaining a competitive edge in the market. This initiative highlights the critical importance of aligning cloud migration efforts with business goals to achieve sustainable growth and innovation.\" affirms Sai Sekar, Head of Global Industries of NTT DATA.\n\nMore details, Download the white paper here.\n\nAbout NTT DATA\n\nNTT DATA is a $30+ billion trusted global innovator of business and technology services.
