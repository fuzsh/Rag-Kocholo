It covers displaced populations such as refugees, asylum-seekers and internally displaced people, including their demographics. Stateless people are also included, most of who have never been displaced. The database also reflects the different types of solutions for ett displaced populations such as repatriation or resettlement.\n\nThis website is based on three data sources:\n\nUNHCR data collected through its annual statistical activities with some data going back as far as 1951, the year UNHCR was created.\n\nData provided by the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA). Information is limited to registered Palestine refugees under UNRWA’s mandate.\n\nData provided by the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC). Information is limited to people displaced within their country due to conflict or violence."
