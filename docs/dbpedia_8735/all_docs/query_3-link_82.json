        "meta_description": "Departing from the widespread importance in the Portuguese and Castilian territories, from the 14th to the 19th centuries, of the morgado (entail), a specific Iberian form to frame institutionally the organization of the corporate family, this article puts forward a specific understanding of the phenomenon – one that considers the figure of authority supporting it, and which, in turn, came to be supported by it: the founder. The idea and the act of founding, the figure of the founder, the founder’s authority and credited capacity to rule the future, in premodern European culture, will be at the core of the questioning on the entail system’s logic. The perspective will be one of anthropological history, seeking to describe and understand the set of background conditions and elements of various nature, which at a certain point combined to allow an important change in social behavior towards heritage and family organization. The article begins with a characterization of the figure of the founder in its main aspects, and then proceeds to a brief discussion of the ways through which the model was transmitted and incorporated by the agents involved, but also of the limits which it produced. The second part of this article offers a preliminary analysis of the origins and functions of these reference elements, their contextual usage by engaged agents in late medieval Portugal, and the social-cultural responses thus constructed.",

        "text": "The Morgadio System: an Anthropological History Perspective\n\n9In the following pages, I will begin by characterizing the figure of the founder in its main aspects. Afterwards I will briefly discuss the ways through which the model was transmitted and incorporated by the agents involved, but also its limits. In the second part of this article, I shall offer a preliminary approach to the origins and the functions of these reference elements, their contextual usage by engaged agents in late medieval Portugal, and the social-cultural responses thus constructed.\n\nThe Founder – the Morgadio’s Figure of Authority\n\n12These complex documents reveal two distinct, crucial moments in the foundation procedure –the organizing of the memories of one’s ancestors and the confirmation of the author’s role as founder. The following sections will outline the main features of each moment.\n\nOrganizing the Past\n\n13The relationship with the ancestral past was one of the main concerns of the morgado’s founder. It might actually be seen as essential to the founding act. The basic feature of this relationship with one’s ancestors lay in the belief that the current family members needed to prove worthy of their legacy, either symbolic (honor and reputation) or material. However, unlike the transmission of assets to the founder, the instant when he identified himself as such involved the need to adopt a specific form of succession. Though generating rupture, the institution a morgado was performed with the goal of ensuring continuity. One of the first institutions, established by Bishop João Afonso de Brito for his servant (? –“criado”, probably his illegitimate son) in 1336 clearly justified the institution act with the confirmation of a robust family pivot, richer than all others –a solution for the material difficulties plaguing Portugal’s nobility, which prevented them from living in conditions that matched their ancestors’:\n\n29 Copy of the institution document preserved in the royal chancery register – ANTT, Leitura Nova, Gua (...)\n\nSeeing and considering how the houses and farms of most noblemen of Portugal are scarce and diminished due to the partition of goods and inheritances, which are divided by many heirs, causing them to have fallen, and to fall, into poverty, and lose the status and the honor in which they were put by those from whom they descend [...]; and considering that when there is a man who is capable of maintaining honorable wealth, with whom the rest of the lineage can be accommodated […]\n\n14A few years later, in 1357, powerful layman and landowner Fernão Gonçalves Cogominho instituted a morgado in which a connection was highlighted between the existence of lineages of “defenders”, which was made possible by the concentration of property on the eldest child, and the providing of services to the king and the kingdom:\n\n30 Copy of the institution document preserved in the royal chancery register – Chancelaria de D. Pedro (...)\n\nConsidering that the division of inheritances among the heirs, it is a reason why the children cannot maintain the honor of their fathers and grandparents; and that the lineages were in great poverty and descended from the status and honors that formerly had; and seeing that morgados in Portugal were much needed for the service of God and kings, and for the good and defense of the kingdom, and that through them the lineages were kept in the states and honors of their predecessors; and namely that noblemen, who are called defenders of the kingdom, are the main responsibles, among those who live in the kingdom, to do much for the common good and for the defense of the land, and to maintain the honor of their lineages and to add in all that they can, in a right way and always doing good deeds […]\n\n35 Copy of the institution document preserved in the royal chancery register – ANTT, Chancelaria de D. (...)\n\n[…] because among all things that are good and honorable to great and noble men, and profitable to their souls and bodies, stands out to leave good memory after their death; and this is done for the perpetuation of their wealth in their children and grandchildren and in the lineage that descends from them.\n\nImmortalizing the Founding Moment and Constructing the Heir’s Image\n\n37 Copy of the institution document preserved in the royal chancery register – ANTT, Leitura Nova, Gua (...)\n\n[…] there have been many quarrels, fights, discussions, hatreds and ill-wills, what would not happen if the said estate was not divided, and was always owned by a single person, as in a morgado. Wishing them to avoid these things, and feeling it as God’s service, he and his wife together ordered and decided to do, as they in fact did, a morgado.\n\n52 Copy of the institution document preserved in the monastery in charge of the suffrages – ANTT, Conv (...)\n\n[…] all shall be called Castelo Branco, and never refer themselves to another land or lineage; and bring their proper coat of arms, without any other mixture or difference; and not bringing them thus, bringing them in another way or mixture, and using another surname and lineage, they shall have not, and will not be able to have, the said morgado.\n\n60 Copy of the institution document registered in the “Registo Vincular” – ANTT, Registos Vinculares, (...)\n\nAnd for that marriage, I will have it done on her and mine relatives’ counsel, preferably those closest to us. She shall wed a decent man, this I insist upon. Should she have married previously, lacking her relatives’ will and counsel, or have spoiled her person (God forbid it), as women sometimes do, and bring dishonor on her relatives, I will have her inherit nothing from my estate, if I can rightfully demand it, and so my conscience appease.\n\n66 Copy of the institution document registered in a book of chapels from the “Juízo de Capelas” – ANTT (...)\n\nFor on that day King John of Portugal defeated and disbanded the king of Castile, in the field of the battle that was fought in Aljubarrota, where I was, at the age of seventeen or eighteen, when God and the Blessed Saint Mary delivered us from the power and subjection to the Castilians.\n\n27Aside from extolling loyalty to the king, documents also covered the need to prevent any breaches of such loyalty, since this was a crime with severe consequences to the estate. One of the first references to this topic appears in Dom Pedro de Meneses’s institution (1431):\n\n68 A. D’Ornellas, “Documentos antigos. Instituição do vínculo de morgadio dos condes de Villa Real, fe (...)\n\nWhoever does such a thing against his Lord –what God does not allow!–, for which he must lose the morgado, or incur in such a case that he cannot hold it, may it then go to the next in age.\n\n70 Maria de Vilhena (1483) – copy of the institution document preserved in the royal chancery register (...)\n\nIf he who has this morgado and in a rightfully way should own it, does something for which he and his descendants have to lose the estates or part of them, according to the law and custom of the Kingdom and of the land, or otherwise, in this case I want and I order that the said morgado passes to the person who legitimately and by right would receive it if the said person had died.\n\n31To finish the portrayal on the founder’s authority figure, two sets of clauses from institution documents should be analyzed. Aside from construing that figure, these clauses sit at the very heart of the entail system: they deal with the relationship with property and almsgiving for the honor of ancestors and future relatives.\n\n87 Copy of the institution document conserved in a family cartulary – ANTT, Arquivo da Casa de Abrante (...)\n\n[…] A large house with its land, all together in the city of Lisbon, in the parish of Santa Justa, where the administrators of the said chapels live, because these houses are the head of the morgado.\n\n89 Copy of the institution document preserved in the monastery in charge of the suffrages – ANTT, Most (...)\n\nAnd I order this so that these houses, which were my father’s and my mother’s and my grandparents’, who have made them, never became abandoned, because until now they have always been inhabited and maintained, with men and women who fear God and who avoid mischievous deeds. And because no one of my lineage ever received shame or dishonor, and we received [instead] much honor, from the good fame they had, I believe it would be a great loss and shame for me and for them [the heirs] to go away from their grandparents’ place, forsaking it and going to live somewhere else, among strangers, where they would never remember my soul or those to whom these estates belonged […]\n\n97 João do Rego (1504) – copy of the institution document registered in a book of Chapels from the “Ju (...)\n\nWe order this foundation] so that the estates cannot be divided, alienated or sold, but always remain intact and united, with all wealth that can be added later, in order to fulfill our will, and to be in service and praise of God, and salvation and good of their souls; and so that with these undivided estates it becomes possible to maintain properly our son and his successors, so that they can fulfill our wills, in the service of God and the king and kingdom.\n\nModes of Transmission and the Assimilation of Models\n\n119 Pedro de Meneses (1431) – institution document edited in A. D’Ornellas, “Documentos antigos. Instit (...)\n\nAnd whomever these goods inherits, he shall give to the person which afterwards shall inherit them, rightfully, in each year, by Christmas day, a hundred dobras cruzadas, in gold or silver, and twenty new golden marcos de bastiães, placed in thirteen cups. And this shall be done in recognition that the inheritance belongs to that person, and cannot be denied thereafter.\n\n123 Luís de Lancastre e Távora, Um fidalgo português do Renascimento, D. Luís da Silveira, 1º conde de (...)\n\nI command my youngest sons, under penalty of my blessing, that when I die, they reunite around their elder brother who inherits my house, and make him Family Head, for he is such of his lineage, and God wanted him to be the oldest among all, to which more honor and respect are due. I command [my youngest sons] to have much obedience to him; and to him, I order to treat his brothers with much love and honor, and to help them, and always cherish them, helping them in their needs, as very friendly brothers, giving them from his own wealth, because he shall not have other such good friends.\n\nNegotiating the Roles of Founder and Heir: Extension and Limits\n\nFunctions and Origins of the Morgadio’s Figure of Authority\n\n44Aiming now at a global interpretation of the panorama described, it is fundamental to state that in the vast majority of entails the figure of the founder was in fact composed of two central reference elements: the founder himself and the “heiress soul”. When together, these complex and multimodal figures were a powerful form of protection of the family as a corporate body, reducing the possibilities of interference by civil powers; and, in what regards ecclesiastical authorities, allowing the laity to claim back a certain control over marriage alliances and, up to a point, to “care for their own dead”. In having a fundamental legal nature –that needs to be understood historically regarding law in premodern Europe–, they were also strongly grounded on specific cultural perceptions of the world and were used by the agents in different forms. In fact, in a social order where the figure of the founder had not enjoyed vast authority, and souls could not have been constituted as heirs, morgados and chapels could never have existed.\n\n47A set of questions can and should be raised against this backdrop: on one hand, concerning the entail globally –where did the parameters for construing the founder’s figure originate from?; why did they start being used when they did?; how were different origins reconciled? Regarding the pious charges and the chantry itself more specifically –how was the commemoration of the “family’s deceased” incorporated in the legal institution of morgadio? Was control over the intercession for the souls of the ancestors also a claim from lay founders to the Church? How did this reinforce and/or weaken the commemoration of the “family’s deceased”? How did the very material forms of framing the soul’s heirship, practiced by the founders and administrators (places, signs, protagonism in funeral ceremonies, selection of the deceased prayed for, specific and specialized liturgical prescriptions, imposition of norms and conditions on clerics) coexist with Church doctrine and discipline or with the idea of the deceased faithful community being universal?\n\n48Answering all these questions is impossible in a single paper, not even in single-handed research. In what follows, I shall list some of the referentials where components of the founder’s figure may have come from, as well as some historical contexts that seem to have been influential on their mise-en-oeuvre in this precise historical period and particular place.\n\n50The transcription in João do Rego’s document is very poor. Its author was clearly unfamiliar with the Latin language. Anyhow, both the institutor’s identification of the text and the fragments available make it recognizable as the “dictum beati” of sixteenth-century Castilian jurists. It is most commonly known in the following version:"
