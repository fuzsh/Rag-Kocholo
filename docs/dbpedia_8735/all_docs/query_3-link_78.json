        "text": "The region between the Douro River and the Spanish border is the North of Portugal.\n\nPorto is the largest city in this region, but there are other places you must definitely visit. In the North of Portugal, you’ll find the UNESCO World Heritage sites of Guimarães (considered Portugal's cradle city), Braga, and the Douro Valley.\n\nIf you’re a wine lover, I’m sure exploring Douro Valley will be on your bucket list. However, there’s another lesser-known area you must definitely visit. The Vinho Verde region, in northwest of North of Portugal, produces unique wines you won’t find anywhere else in the world.\n\nThe Vinho Verde (literally translated to green wine) has nothing to do with its color. In fact, the name derives from the young and fresh wines produced by native grape varieties.\n\nThe North is also known for its rainy days, almost all year round, and freezing temperatures during the winter. Yet, the mountainous landscape at Gerês National Park and Montesinho Natural Park are definitely worth visiting.\n\nYou’ll find stunning beaches in Viana do Castelo and Vila Nova de Gaia. The most well-known is Praia de Miramar, the home of Senhor da Pedra Chapel. This small chapel is a photographer’s paradise since it’s the only building on the sand bank, often facing overwhelming waves during winter storms.\n\nIn my opinion, Northerners are the most friendly and nicest people you’ll find in Portugal. I guess it’s because they aren’t exhausted by the tourist hordes visiting Lisbon or the Algarve. They also have a profound respect for old religious traditions, which they proudly celebrate when the time comes.\n\nLook for the Nossa Senhora da Agonia Pilgrimage in August, where you’ll find women wearing intricate Portuguese filigree golden earrings and dressed in stunning traditional red gowns.\n\nFor more info, check out this one week North Portugal itinerary.\n\nWhere to visit in Northern Portugal\n\nGuimarães\n\nAfter Portugal’s foundation in 1143, Guimarães was the kingdom’s first capital. Since this was where it all began, the Portuguese referred to Guimarães as the cradle city. To learn more about this astounding city, visit the 10th-century Guimarães Castle, the Paços dos Duques, and the historical old town, declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\nMake a quick stop at Supremo Gosto pastry shop and ask for the Tortas de Guimarães. The original recipe is the city’s best-kept secret, and you won’t find these pastries anywhere else. To enjoy a bird’s view of the city, hop on a cable car to Penha Sanctuary. The view from the stand-alone chapel on the hilltop is exceptional.\n\nBraga\n\nFounded by the Romans in 16th B.C. as Bracara Augusta, Braga is one of the oldest European cities converted to Christianity. That’s why this is where you’ll find the oldest and most spectacular churches in Portugal. Visit Braga Cathedral and São Paulo Church in the city center. A few kilometers away, on top of a hill, you’ll find the majestic Bom Jesus do Monte and the Sameiro Sanctuary.\n\nToday, Braga is a historical city with the youngest population in the country. As a result, you’ll find a vibrant city life beside ancient traditions and historical locations.\n\nPorto\n\nPorto is the largest city in the North of Portugal, famous worldwide for its sweet and fortified Port Wine, buildings’ façades filled with azulejos tiles, the Francesinha, the Portuguese version of Croque Monsieur.\n\nWhere should you go? Walk up the Clérigos Tower and admire the city view, tour the Porto Cathedral, admire the stunning azulejo tiles at São Bento Train Station, and visit the beautiful Palácio da Bolsa. To capture Porto’s most authentic experiences, visit the Mercado do Bolhão, try the Francesinha at Santiago’s, and enjoy a glass of Port Wine at the Port Wine Cellars across the Douro River, in Gaia.\n\nPeneda Gerês National Park\n\nThis is the only national park in Portugal and one of my favorite locations in the country.\n\nWhy? The landscape is astonishing! The high mountains, dense green forests, deep blue lakes, and magnificent waterfalls are some of the reasons why I travel to Gerês any chance I get. To understand what I mean, visit the Cascata do Arado Waterfall, the Blue Lagoon, or the Miradouro da Pedra Bela.\n\nIf you’re lucky, you’ll find wild horses and deer roaming Gerês hills.\n\nDouro Valley\n\nBesides being a UNESCO World Heritage Site, the Douro Valley is also the oldest demarcated wine region in the world. Since 1756, the terraces filled with vineyards extend as far as the eyes can see along the Douro Riverbanks, resulting in a breathtaking man-made landscape.\n\nAt Quinta da Pacheca, you can join a wine harvest, have a wine tasting, and sleep inside a barrel (yes, you read it correctly!). Take the time to explore the enchanting Peso da Régua and Lamego, two stunning cities near the Douro River that are deeply connected to the wine-making industry.\n\nMontesinho Natural Park\n\nIn northeast Portugal, close to the Spanish border, lies a wildlife sanctuary that most people (even Portuguese) know nothing about and may have never even heard of. That’s the Montesinho Natural Park, home to the Iberian wolf and the majestic red deer.\n\nWithin a short distance, you can also explore the ancient city of Bragança and its medieval castle, the picturesque Gimonde village and its Roman bridge, and the authentic Guadramil village, where you’ll find traditional schist houses. Enjoy the best local cuisine with Posta Mirandesa, Alheira, or the local Butelo.\n\nViana do Castelo\n\nViana do Castelo is a coastal city located at a 30-minute drive from the Spanish border. Here, you’ll find a rich and diverse culture and gastronomy beside stunning monuments that’ll leave you stunned.\n\nCheck the São Domingos Church, the Nossa Senhora da Agonia Chapel, and the city’s cathedral. At Museu do Traje, you can learn more about the history behind the traditional red gowns and the gold filigree jewelry.\n\nAt Viana do Castelo, the ocean water is the coldest in Portugal. Nevertheless, its golden sand beaches are a sight to behold and the perfect place for surfing, windsurfing, and kitesurfing.\n\nPonte de Lima\n\nFounded in 1125, Ponte de Lima is one of the oldest villages in Portugal, where archeologists retrieved several 3000-year-old artifacts. So, if you’re a history lover, you’re in the right place.\n\nIn Ponte de Lima, roam the streets and alleys in the historic village center and tour the beautiful religious monuments you’ll find along the way. Start with the main church and head towards Igreja da Misericórdia and Nossa Senhora da Misericórdia das Pereiras Chapel. You’ll also find the Pelourinho and the medieval city wall remaining towers.\n\nCross the old Roman bridge over the Lima River and find a beautiful fluvial beach, the Parque do Arnado gardens, and the 18th-century São João Chapel.\n\nWhere to visit in Central Portugal\n\nSerra da Estrela\n\nSerra da Estrela is the largest and highest mountain range in mainland Portugal, with Torre reaching 1993 meters of altitude. During winter, you’ll find the only ski resort in the country, snowy slopes, and the lowest temperatures recorded in Portugal.\n\nBesides skiing and exploring Torre, the highest point in the mountain, you can also visit the Covão dos Conchos, an intriguing hole built at Lagoa Comprida Lake in the 1950s to transport water. Hiking in Serra da Estrela Natural Park will allow you to explore stunning views.\n\nFor a glimpse of the historic and most authentic mountainous villages, wander the streets of Piódão, Folgosinho, and Linhares da Beira. For a full experience, you must try the traditional sheep’s cheese with wheat bread.\n\nAveiro\n\nAveiro is a beautiful city in the Center of Portugal, famous for the Moliceiros (traditional colorful boats), canals, salt production, and the Ovos Moles sweets. In the city center, you’ll find the city’s religious legacy in stunning medieval churches beside Art Noveau buildings.\n\nA few kilometers away, the Costa Nova fishing village holds colorful beach cottages, golden sand beaches, and some of the best fish and seafood restaurants.\n\nBuçaco\n\nThe breathtaking Buçaco National Forest is an idyllic location you must visit while in Portugal. In the 17th century, the Order of the Discalced Carmelites planted this luxurious forest surrounding the Santa Cruz do Buçaco Convent, which was partially demolished and converted into what is now the Palace Hotel do Buçaco.\n\nBesides visiting this magnificent royal palace and the surrounding gardens, you can also venture through the forest and use the hiking trails to admire some of the oldest trees in Portugal, the Via Sacra buildings, and breathtaking views from the highest point in Buçaco, the Cruz Alta viewpoint at 547 meters of altitude.\n\nCoimbra\n\nCoimbra is a charming old city famous for its university, the oldest in Portugal. However, it’s also home to the tragic love story of Pedro and Inês, Fado music, and rich history.\n\nWhile visiting Coimbra, tour the university buildings Alta and Sofia, the Joanine Library, the university’s botanical gardens, and São Miguel Chapel. Throughout the city, you’ll find the São Sebastião Aqueduct, the Sé Velha, the Moorish city gate Porta de Almedina, the Santa Cruz Church and Monastery, and the Santa Clara a Nova Monastery.\n\nDuring your stay in Coimbra, listen to the serenade Fado music at Faro Hilário or Café Santa Cruz.\n\nNazaré\n\nNazaré is a beautiful fishing village famous among surfers worldwide for its big waves at Praia do Norte. However, there’s much more to see and do at Nazaré!\n\nDuring the summer, the Portuguese flock to Praia da Nazaré to enjoy the pristine and calm waters. As a result, you’ll find a few modern beach concessions alongside older women selling traditional dried fish.\n\nWalk on the beach promenade and roam Nazaré's downtown streets to unravel the Santo António and Nossa Senhora dos Aflitos Chapels. Next, hop on the Nazaré lift to find the Nossa Senhora da Nazaré Sanctuary on the hilltop. From the Suberco viewpoint, you’ll enjoy the superb scenery of Nazaré.\n\nBatalha\n\nThe small village of Batalha is home to a majestic masterpiece of Portuguese Gothic architecture. Mosteiro da Batalha is often the only reason why people come to Batalha. Yet, there are other monuments and stunning locations to visit.\n\nTour the Batalha Main Church, Largo Infante D. Henrique, or the Santa Maria da Misericórdia Chapel. In Batalha’s vicinity, you can admire the 18th-century Neo-Gothic Boutaca bridge or the incredible altarpiece at Santo Antão Hermitage.\n\nA few kilometers away, explore the Pia do Urso, an authentic and charming village recently rebuilt to its former glory, or the stunning Alcobaça Monastery.\n\nFátima\n\nOn the 13th of May 1917, at Cova da Iria plateau in Fátima, Our Lady of Fátima appeared to reveal her visions to three child shepherds. As the word spread, more people gathered at the location on the 13th of every month to witness Our Lady’s predictions.\n\nToday, Cova da Iria is home to the Fátima Sanctuary, one of the most important pilgrimage locations in the world. Every year, thousands of pilgrims and tourists gather here to celebrate the apparitions of Our Lady of Fátima.\n\nLisbon Metropolitan Area is the most densely populated region in Portugal. In the area around the river mouth of the Tagus River, you’ll find Lisbon, the country’s capital, and other cities such as Sintra, Estoril, Cascais, Setúbal, and Sesimbra. This area is fabulous for day trips as there are so many interesting cities, parks, and sites all in close proximity to one another.\n\nLisbon needs no introduction. Nevertheless, I feel obliged to suggest a few places you can’t miss. In Belém, explore the Torre de Belém, Mosteiro dos Jerónimos, and the Padrão dos Descobrimentos. While visiting these monuments, you’ll learn more about the incredible history behind the Portuguese Discoveries.\n\nLisbon’s Cathedral, Castelo de S. Jorge, and the Águas Livres Aqueduct are other locations you must visit. To complete your Lisbon experience, wander the streets of Lisbon’s downtown and tour Chiado, Praça do Comércio, and Restauradores. Here, you’ll find the incredible craft of the Portuguese Cobblestone, the best Pastel de Nata at Fábrica da Nata, and the oldest local shops in town.\n\nSintra is known for its romantic atmosphere, stunning old palaces and mansions, and an incredibly dense forest around the village. Roam Sintra’s streets, explore historical sites, and try the local pastries Travesseiro and Queijada.\n\nOutside the village, you must tour the Pena Park. Besides having the chance to hike beside century-old trees, you’ll find the most romantic palace in Europe: Pena Palace. At a short distance, you can also visit the Castelo dos Mouros, one of the oldest castles in Portugal, dating back to the Moorish occupation.\n\nIf you have the chance, try to also check out Quinta da Regaleira, Palácio Nacional de Sintra, and Palácio de Montserrat.\n\nEstoril and Cascais are often associated with the wealthiest classes. Some even call it the “Portuguese Riviera”. From its humble beginnings as a small fishing community, these two villages became known during the Second World War, due to the exiled royalty and spies who enjoyed Portugal’s neutrality. Today, you can admire the incredible century-old mansions and the golden sand beaches.\n\nSetúbal and Sesimbra are located south of Lisbon, across the Tagus River.\n\nIn Setúbal, you’ll find the third largest port in Portugal, which transformed the city into an industrial hub. Nevertheless, you can explore Setúbal’s past by visiting the São Filipe Fortress and the Igreja de Santa Maria da Graça.\n\nOutside Setúbal city center, I suggest you visit the Portinho da Arrábida, at Arrábida Natural Park. Besides crystal-clear waters and pristine beaches, you’ll find luxurious forests stretching to the ocean.\n\nSesimbra is a fishing town with incredible food, stunning beaches, and one of the best birdwatching spots in Portugal. It’s also home to Cabo Espichel, the westernmost point in Europe. Besides admiring the breathtaking landscape, you can also visit the Santuário do Cabo Espichel, a stunning sanctuary built in the 18th century.\n\nWhere to visit in the Lisbon Region\n\nLisbon\n\nPortugal’s capital offers such a variety of experiences and sightseeing opportunities that it's challenging to tell you where to go and what to do in just a few sentences. Besides having a Pastel de Nata and visiting the Mosteiro dos Jerónimos, the Torre de Belém, or exploring the cobbled streets at Chiado, look for a more authentic experience.\n\nHead towards Lisboa’s oldest neighborhoods of Alfama, Bairro Alto, or Mouraria and try the grilled sardines, the Pataniscas de Bacalhau, Bacalhau à Brás ou Peixinhos da Horta. These simple but delicious recipes will surprise you!\n\nSintra\n\nPortugal’s most romantic city! The sumptuous mansions and palaces in and around Sintra are perfect examples of Neo-Gothic and Romantic architecture styles in Portugal. To witness the beauty of such buildings firsthand, visit the Pena Palace, Palácio Nacional de Sintra, Palácio de Montserrat, and Quinta da Regaleira.\n\nCascais and Estoril\n\nCoastal Cascais became the summer residence for Portuguese royalty and other nobles in the 1870’s, and it continues to be a summer playground, but now both for Portugal’s well-to-do and holidayers of all stripes.\n\nSituated on the edge of the the Portuguese riviera, Cascais has lovely beaches with calm waters to its south, and wild, raw beaches to its north along the Serra de Sintra Coastline. Cascais is filled with shops, restaurants, museums, and a quaint historic center waiting to be explored. For architecture lovers, there are a number of grand old mansions.\n\nThe nearby town of Estoril is similar, but it adds in a casino and a number of renowned golf courses.\n\nTroia Peninsula\n\nLocated quite close to the city of Sétubal, and just about an hour south of Lisbon, the Troia Peninsula is undoubtedly the most popular beach destination in the area.\n\nIt has long been a playground for Europe’s rich and famous, and that’s for good reason: it has some of the loveliest, calmest, and most incredible beaches that you’ll find in Portugal.\n\nWhen the Portuguese think of the Alentejo, the first thing that comes to our minds are the slow-paced way of living, the gentle hills covered in wheat, and the warm summer temperatures. Here, visitors are invited to slow down and enjoy the quietness of the landscape.\n\nAll things considered, this is all true, but it’s also just a fragment of all that the Alentejo is.\n\nLocated between the Tagus Valley to the North (starting a bit below Lisbon) and the Algarve to the South, the Alentejo enjoys a stunning coastline overlooking the Atlantic, endless plains of smooth hills, and a beautiful countryside.\n\nAlentejo’s cork tree forests, known as the Montado Alentejano, are responsible for almost half of all cork produced worldwide. This region also makes Portugal one of the top olive oil producers, alongside Spain, Italy, and Morocco. And, it’s also one of the oldest wine regions in the country, producing and exporting world-class wines.\n\nAlentejo is home to several historical sites, including my beloved Évora (where I lived for 5 years), and the fortified village of Elvas, near the Spanish border, both classified as UNESCO World Heritage sites.\n\nTo explore other historical locations and enjoy the essence of Alentejo, head to Marvão, Castelo de Vide, Evoramonte, Monsaraz, Borba, or Vila Viçosa. In these small villages, you’ll find well-preserved medieval castles, ancient cobbled streets, and white-washed houses. The landscape around them is absolutely stunning! From the highest points, you’ll see an endless plain stretching as far as the eyes can see.\n\nAlong the coastline, Zambujeira do Mar, Vila Nova de Milfontes, and Porto Covo are some of our (the Portuguese) favorite locations to enjoy the beach. Moving north towards Lisbon, you’ll find the luxurious Comporta. In recent years, this small coastal village became the summer home to many A-listers, including Christian Louboutin, Sharon Stone, and Richard Branson.\n\nWhere to visit in the Alentejo\n\nMarvão\n\nMarvão is a stunning medieval village in the northern Alentejo region, deep in the heart of Serra de São Mamede Natural Park. From Marvão Castle, you’ll enjoy the most stunning views of the mountains. On a clear day, you can even see the snowy peaks of Serra da Estrela.\n\nAt Marvão, you can explore the ancient Roman ruins of the Ammaia citadel, observe the medieval city gates, and admire the traditional Alentejo white-washed houses beside the Gothic arches, filled with Manueline details.\n\nElvas\n\nThe fortified city of Elvas played an important role in securing Portugal’s independence in the 16th century. The impenetrable start-shaped Graça fortress declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is the perfect example of such times. In the city center, you’ll find the remains of the original Moorish walls, Gothic monuments, and a medieval castle.\n\nDiscover the local cuisine at the Casa das Barcas Municipal Market, you can find fresh baked bread, traditional goat and sheep cheeses, and the local Enchidos (traditional pork sausages). If you’re looking to enjoy the local desserts, try the Sericaia com Ameixa de Elvas. It’s delicious!\n\nÉvora\n\nMy beloved Évora! I was lucky to live in Évora for five years and explore this beautiful UNESCO World Heritage site back-to-back.\n\nInside Évora’s medieval walls, you’ll find narrow cobbled streets, unique monuments, and fully refurbished traditional houses. From Praça do Giraldo, the town’s center, you can get to any point in the city. I recommend you walk up the 5th of October Street to admire Évora’s cathedral and the Roman Diana’s temple.\n\nHere’s an insider’s tip: climb the narrow staircase inside the Cathedral’s towers and be astonished by the staggering city view from the Cathedral’s rooftop.\n\nIn Évora, you’ll also find some of the best Alentejo wines and a unique gastronomy. Pair the traditional Migas de Espargos com Porco Preto with a bottle of Cartuxa red wine. You can thank me later!\n\nMonsaraz\n\nWhile traveling through Alentejo, you’ll notice the endless plain fields and a hill emerging in the distance, covered in white-washed houses surrounded by ancient city walls.\n\nMonsaraz is a beautiful medieval village overlooking the Alqueva, Europe’s largest artificial lake. Roam the cobbled streets, admire the traditional houses, visit the 13th-century Nossa Senhora da Lagoa church, and tour Monsaraz’s Castle. Exit the city walls and explore the São Bento Hermitage. You’ll be surprised by the breathtaking scenery."
