        "text": "Temporary admission procedure\n\nPortugal has a temporary admission procedure which allows vehicles registered in another Member State to remain in the country and be used without paying tax for a maximum of 6 months, whether consecutive or not, in each 12 months.\n\nThe vehicles concerned must have a permanent registration number in another Member State and must be registered in the name of a citizen who is not resident in Portugal. They must also be brought into Portugal by their owners or lawful keepers for their private use.\n\nThe vehicles may be driven in Portugal by their owners, spouses or common law spouses, parents or lawful keepers, provided that they are not normally resident in Portugal.\n\nThis procedure is permitted for persons who are in Portugal for a fixed term, for education or for training, and who retain their residence and personal links in another Member State. The procedure is fixed for the time required to fulfil the respective purpose.\n\nIt also applies to cross-border workers who live in Spain and travel regularly between their residence and their place of work in Portugal.\n\nApplications for the temporary admission procedure in these circumstances must be submitted to the Direcção-Geral das Alfândegas e dos Impostos Especiais sobre o Consumo [General Directorate for Customs and Excise] within no more than 30 days of arriving in Portugal, with the documentation requested.\n\nExemptions from the obligation to register a vehicle and the respective taxes\n\nStudents\n\nIf you are a national of another European Union country who is studying in Portugal:\n\nyou do not have to register your vehicle with the Portuguese authorities during the period of your studies (this exemption also applies if the owner of the vehicle is one of the student’s parents who does not live in Portugal);\n\nthe exemption is only valid for temporary importation;\n\nthe vehicle is also exempt from payment of motor vehicle tax in Portugal.\n\nTo benefit from this exemption you must provide proof of enrolment with your university or educational establishment, which will be valid for 12 months or for the period of your studies in Portugal, and proof of residence in another Member State.\n\nTo apply for an exemption you must complete the Declaração Aduaneira de Veículo (DAV) [Vehicle Customs Declaration] on the Portal das Finanças [Tax and Customs Authority website], within 30 days of the date the vehicle enters Portugal.\n\nIf you also work in Portugal while you are a student, you must register your vehicle and pay the applicable taxes.\n\nPensioners and owners of second homes in Portugal\n\nIf you are a national of another EU country and have a second home in Portugal, you must only register your vehicle in Portugal if it is imported under the temporary importation procedure for over 6 months, whether consecutive or not, during any period of 12 months.\n\nCross-border workers\n\nIf you are a cross-border worker, i.e. you work in Portugal but live in Spain and go home on a regular basis in your own vehicle, you may apply to the customs service for an exemption from vehicle tax (temporary importation).\n\nTo apply for this exemption as a cross-border worker, you must present the Vehicle Customs Declaration (DAV) via the Tax and Customs Authority website.\n\nCross-Border workers must present evidence that:\n\ntheir habitual residence is in Spain;\n\nthey work in Portugal (e.g. a copy of their employment contract).\n\nExemption from Vehicle Tax (ISV)\n\nIf you come to Portugal to live, you can apply for exemption from payment of Vehicle Tax (ISV). You have 12 months from the date of your change of residence to Portugal to do this.\n\nThe following may also benefit from exemption from ISV:\n\npersons over 18 years of age who change their residence to Portugal and who had previously lived in another Member State or another country for at least 6 months;\n\nPortuguese nationals or nationals of another Member State who earn income which is taxed in Portugal for 24 months (members of co-operatives, teachers, officials contracted abroad to provide services in Portuguese diplomatic and consular posts or to represent Portuguese public services, and officials of international organisations).\n\nApplications for exemption must be made online via the Tax and Customs Authority website.\n\nThe Portuguese Highway Code allows applications for the seizure of vehicles, with a view to scrapping vehicles whose record of ownership has not been regularised.\n\nIn the event of the sale of the vehicle, the new owner must regularise the registration within 60 days of the date of sale. If after those 60 days the vehicle remains in the name of the former owner and is driven on the road with an out-of-date ownership record, an application may be made to seize it.\n\nThe former owner may apply to have the vehicle seized for failure to regularise its ownership via the Vehicle Licensing Authority or the IMT help desk in their area of residence by presenting their identification card and the necessary form.\n\nThe IMT will forward this application to the traffic control authorities (PSP – Polícia de Segurança Pública, and GNR – Guarda Nacional Republicana), responsible for seizing the vehicle.\n\nIf the vehicle is not located by the authorities within 6 months it is deemed to be missing and the IMT may remove it from the record."
