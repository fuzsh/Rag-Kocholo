Relying on overland trade was too slow and you couldn‚Äôt bring all that many goods with you on a camel‚Äôs back. Maritime trade would prove to be far more economically efficient.\n\nBut as of yet, the fastest way to Asia was through the Mediterranean, which was monopolized by the Byzantines followed by the Ottomans. Was there a faster route going west? Maybe. ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è\n\nSTUDY TIP: You will never be asked specifically to identify a date.

The population was increasing and this led to more demand for resources. However, there was a business opportunity in the search for resources. The state with the most access to trade could be the most powerful.\n\nBy 1450, more people were migrating in search of religious tolerance and economic opportunities. Growing dissent among oppressed and poor populations pushed European states to invest in exploration and trade.\n\nNew Technologies\n\n| Tech Innovations in Science | Tech Innovations in Navigation |\n\n| --- | --- | | Newton‚Äôs Laws of Gravitation, Astronomical Charts, Better mapmaking | Astrolabe, Lateen sail, Compass, New ships (caravel, carrack, fluyt) | | |\n\n### Effects of Innovation\n\nThese new scientific discoveries and navigation undoubtedly opened up new trade networks across the Atlantic and Pacific, which also led to mass migrations of people (forced and voluntary).\n\nThe movement of goods and people had regional consequences. For example, gunpowder developed by the Chinese changed the method of conquest and made its way through South Asia, the Middle East, and Europe. Gunpowder would have violent consequences in the decades to come.\n\nMuslim merchants continued to travel on trade routes, as they had done in the past centuries. During this time, Muslim merchants established themselves further in North Africa and the Indian Ocean, which is why Islam is a dominant religion in those regions.\n\nFinally, Europeans built massive military strength because of trade profits and access to new weapons. Before 1450, Europeans did not play a prominent role on the global stage, but after 1450, Europeans were the main puppeteers of the global economy.\n\n4.2 Exploration: Causes and Events\n\n‚ö° Watch: AP World History - üé• Transoceanic Connections\n\nTrade between Europe and Asia had to go through the Mediterranean, which was controlled by Italian city-states. The Spanish, Portuguese, French, English, and Dutch had to find another route in order to remain competitive, so they invested in exploration. #traderace\n\nMotives for Exploration\n\nEuropeans were primarily motivated by money, religion, rivalry, and conquest. If they could fast a quicker route to Asia, profits would balloon and religious ideologies would spread.\n\nAt this time, wealth was measured by how much gold or silver a country had on hand. So states began to practice mercantilist policies, which limited imports and maximized exports. This kept more money in the bank at any given time.\n\nAchievements in Exploration\n\nThe Portuguese led the way to Sub-Saharan Africa and present-day China, India, Indonesia, but their first to market advantage didn‚Äôt last long.\n\nOnce contact with the Americas was open, the Spanish, French, English, and Dutch increasingly invested in the explorations.\n\nComparing Explorers\n\n| | Explorer || Origin || Trips || Goal || Impact | |\n\n| | Zheng He || China || - India\n\nMiddle East\n\nAfrica || Open trade networks and spread culture || China stopped exploring | | | | John Cabot || England || - North America || Get to Asia || Established English land in Canada | |\n\n| | Vasco de Gama || Portugal || - West coast of Africa\n\nIndia || Get to India & China || Established power in Indian Ocean | | | | Christopher Columbus || Spain || - Caribbean islands\n\nCentral America || Get to India & China || European colonization of the Americas | | | | Ferdinand Magellan || Spain || - South America\n\nPhilippines || Get to Asia || Established Spanish links to Americas and Asia | | -----\n\n4.3 Columbian Exchange\n\nBefore 1492, the Americas were isolated from Africa, Europe, and Asia. This is why the ancient civilizations are so fascinating because they all developed similar structures without knowing about each other.\n\nColumbus was an all around terrible human being that committed mass genocide, but he gets the namesake of this era because his voyage kicked off a new global trading system.\n\nFlow of Trade\n\nThe connection of the Old World (Afro-Eurasia) and the New World (the Americas) unlocked a massive flow of goods, people, ideas, and disease. New crops and livestock changed eating habits and largely increased the global population. However, the Americas suffered massive depopulation because of the spread of disease.\n\nAfroEurasia to Americas ‚Üí üêé üêñ üçö üåæ üçá\n\nAmericas to AfroEurasia ‚Üí üåΩ ü•î üç´ üçÖ ü•ë üç†\n\nAtlantic Slave Trade\n\nThe Atlantic Slave Trade began immediately after the Portuguese arrived in Africa, but seriously expanded after Native American populations were decimated. Cash crops were profitable, but required a lot of labor.\n\nIndigenous communities were originally enslaved, but they were not a viable long term plan for free/cheap labor. Disease wiped out most of the population and many that were left were able to escape because of superior knowledge of the land.\n\nThe Atlantic Slave Trade was expanded to supply labor throughout the colonies. Africans were kidnapped, often with the help of local rulers, and brought to the New World.\n\nThe most common destination for slaves was Brazil because sugar was so harsh to cultivate that the lifespan of slaves was extremely short (5-10% of slaves died every year). On the backs of millions of slaves, sugar eventually outpaced silver as the most profitable good at the time.\n\nüëâ üé• Watch former AP World student Charly Castillo discuss what to know about the Columbian Exchange\n\nWhere Slaves Went\n\n| | Colonies || Percentage | |\n\n| | Portuguese (mostly Brazil) || 39% | |\n\n| | British West Indies (Caribbean) || 18% | |\n\n| | Spanish (Latin America) || 18% | |\n\n| | French (North America) || 14% | |\n\n| | British Mainland (US) || 6% | |\n\n| | Dutch West Indies (Caribbean) || 2% | |\n\n| | Other || 3% | |\n\n### African Diaspora\n\nThe African diaspora changed the culture of the Americas as slaves brought new ideas, foods, and languages.\n\nWith over 1500 different dialects, most slaves did not share a common language, which meant that native tongues were lost over time. New languages developed as a blend of different dialects, such as Creole.\n\nMusic was a key factor for survival in many slave communities. This music would later influence many genres including gospel, blues, jazz, rock n‚Äô roll, hip hop, reggae, and samba.\n\nThe Columbian Exchange also had an enormous effect on the environment. As colonists expanded plantations, many regions suffered from deforestation, soil depletion, and a strain on water sources.\n\n4.4 Maritime Empires Link Regions\n\nüëâ Watch former AP World student Varoon Kodithala review the key facts about the Maritime Empires\n\nEuropeans in the World\n\nAs Europeans explored and colonized Africa and Asia, they set up trading post cities to establish a base. These cities became centers of imperial administrations later on.\n\nIn West Africa, European merchants and missionaries reached inland to the Kongo and Benin. The Asante Empire and Kingdom of the Kongo participated in slave trade, which increased their wealth and power.\n\nJapan initially welcomed Portuguese and Dutch traders and missionaries, then pulled back by banning Christianity and contact with the outside. They remained isolated for most of the 17th and 18th centuries in an effort to protect traditional culture.\n\nChina was also set on isolating itself from foreign affairs. After Zheng He‚Äôs explorations, the Ming dynasty retreated into isolationist policies. Europeans would have to wait a few centuries for access to China.\n\nThe Mughals in India were open to trade with Europeans and the British East India Company (EIC) was established. The EIC took advantage of tensions between Muslims and Hindus in order to expand influence. The British moved inland and by the 19th century, had direct colonial control over all of India.\n\nThe Americas\n\nThe Spanish and Portuguese divided up the lands of the Americas before they even explored or conquered any of it. In 1494, they signed the Treaty of Tordesillas, which gave Brazil to the Portuguese and everywhere else to the Spanish. Languages are still divided on these lines.\n\nThe Spanish conquistadors brought down the thriving Aztec and Inca empires within a few decades. The Aztecs fell first when Hernan Cortes and his troops brought disease to the region. Cortes also combined the forces of Aztec rivals to topple them faster. He then established the Spanish capital of Mexico City.\n\nThe Incas fell quickly because of disease and betrayal. Francisco Pizarro and his troops captured the Inca leader Atahualpa and convinced the Inca to trade gold for his return. They complied, but Pizarro still had Atahualpa killed, effectively toppling the empire.\n\nThe Spanish also established a fort at St. Augustine in present-day Florida. In North America, the Spanish had control of the southwest regions, central America, and Florida.\n\nNorth of the Spanish territory, the French and British were fueling their rivalry as they competed for land and control of resources. The French aligned with the Iroquois for protection and trading rights. The rivalry eventually popped off as the Seven Years‚Äô War exploded tensions around the world. The British drove the French out of Canada and India after that.\n\nChanges in Labor Systems\n\nEconomic systems were disrupted as trade intensified. The Portuguese controlled some areas on the Indian Ocean network as they strong armed locals, but merchants continued to trade and migrate.\n\nIn the Americas, the Spanish established the encomienda system to force Natives to harvest cash crops in exchange for food and shelter, similar to the feudal system. In this labor system, the Natives were tied to the land and were not free to leave. This same system was used on smaller farms, which was called the hacienda system.\n\nMeanwhile, the silver trade was insanely profitable for the Spanish and the mines at Potosi and Zacatecas needed as much labor as possible. Indigenous peoples were forced to work in the harsh mines using a modified Mit‚Äôa system to nearly enslave the Natives.\n\nComparing Labor Systems\n\n| | Type || Place || Work || Characteristics | |\n\n| | Slave || Americas & Africa || Harvested cash crops, worked plantations, maintained homes || - Treated as property\n\nFew or no rights | | | | Serf || Europe & Asia || Worked the farms of Lords || - Tied to land\n\nNo legal protections | | | | Indentured Servant || Global || Field work, maintained homes || - Transport paid in exchange for 7 years of unpaid labor | |\n\n| | Free Peasant || Europe & Asia || Blacksmith, weaving, farming || - Worked own land\n\nPaid taxes to Lord\n\nPaid tithes to Church | | | | Nomad || Europe, Asia, & Africa || Herding, pastoralism, breeding || - Moved often\n\nUsed land temporarily | | | | Guild Member || Europe || Skilled crafts || - Apprentice\n\nEventually independent | |\n\nAtlantic Slave Trade\n\nThe work of harvesting cash crops and mining silver was labor intensive. These new markets were profitable, but could only be sustained with a lot of cheap or free labor.\n\nAfrica was targeted for labor in the Americas because Indigenous populations were decimated by disease and were able to escape with knowledge of the land and the ability to blend in with other Natives.\n\nIndentured servants provided cheap labor for a while, but plantation owners couldn‚Äôt scale their businesses when laborers would leave after seven years.\n\nAs the slave trade expanded, some African Kings participated and shared profits. Slaves were captured, transported to holding pens (‚ÄúPoints of No Return‚Äù), and then crammed on ships for the Middle Passage journey across the Atlantic.\n\nThe demographic effects of the slave trade in Africa were unprecedented. Although the population of Africa ultimately increased because of increased food resources, in some regions the population declined as slaves were kidnapped. Families were separated and there was a gender imbalance because more men were taken than women.\n\n4.5 Maritime Empires Develop\n\nMercantilist policies of the time maximized exports and minimized imports so a state could have more silver and gold on hand. These policies forced colonies to only import goods from their colonizer\n\nThe changes in economic policy and increased trade led to innovations in finances, business, and banking.\n\nCommercial Revolution\n\nThe worldwide transformation into a trade-based economy using gold and silver is known as the Commercial Revolution, which had four main causes:\n\nDevelopment of European colonies overseas\n\nOpening of new trade routes over the Atlantic and Pacific\n\nPopulation growth, which increased demand for goods\n\nInflation caused by increased mining\n\n-As a result of increased trade and mining, prices also increased across the board. This is also known as the Price Revolution. As prices increased, more people went into debt, which was a recipe for revolution in the upcoming century.\n\nInnovations in Finance\n\nTo keep up with the new global demand, joint-stock companies were formed. These minimized personal risk as investors pooled money into ventures. It was kind of like an early form of crowdfunding. Rather than one investor risking everything if a ship was destroyed, many investors could split the risk thereby increasing the number of new businesses.\n\nThere were two main joint-stock companies. The British East India Company and the Dutch East India Company (VOC). Spain and Portugal had more government than private investing, which is why they didn‚Äôt rely on joint-stock companies.\n\nThe Dutch were high rollers in this time and played a main role in finance. They established a stock exchange and developed an international currency to facilitate trade. These financial innovations created enormous wealth for the Dutch.\n\nFrance and England were not as financially stable. Investors were rapidly buying shares based on speculated costs that increased as demand increased. When a large number of these investments failed to return profits, many investors went bankrupt which had rippling effects on the economy.\n\nTriangular Trade\n\nIn the Atlantic, the consistent trade from Europe to Africa to the Americas and back to Europe was known as Triangular Trade. Europeans brought manufactured goods like guns to Africa, picked up slaves to bring to the Americas, then filled up on cash crops to head back to Europe.\n\nEffects of the Atlantic Slave Trade\n\nThe explosion of the slave trade seriously weakened African kingdoms that had been on the rise before this time. For example, the Kongo was in decline. Slowed population growth also weakened economic production.\n\nBecause of this, economic development in Africa was stalled for centuries and these regions were left vulnerable to the imperial conquest of Europeans. Without the slave trade, African kingdoms would have continued to strengthen and could have prevented centuries of turmoil in the region.\n\nSome African rulers were complicit in the slave trade. They would kidnap slaves and trade them to Europeans in exchange for wealth and guns, which made local rivalries far more violent.\n\nMost kidnapped slaves were men, which left a gender imbalance in favor of women, especially in Ghana and Benin. As a result, practices of polygamy were more common.\n\nUltimately, the exchange of new food staples increased the population of Africa, but in parts of West Africa, the population suffered as people were taken.\n\nEffects on Native Americans\n\nThe most immediate effect on indigenous communities was the massive depopulation caused by disease. Native Americans did not have biological immunity to the common diseases brought by Europeans like smallpox and typhoid. These diseases killed up to 90% of the population.\n\nSpanish and Portuguese influence spread across politics, economics, and society in the Americas. Spanish viceroys were appointed to rule each region in conjunction with audiencias (royal courts).\n\nMost of the native literature, art, and languages were completely destroyed, which left very few primary sources from before 1450. The decimation of lands and peoples made it difficult to preserve this history. The languages of Spanish and Portuguese became the dominant languages of the region.\n\nFinally, a new elite class emerged called the creoles. These were people of Spanish or Portuguese descent that were born in the Americas. They were not quite as powerful as Peninsulares, people born on the Iberian peninsula, but had far more powers than any mixed person, Native American, or African slave.\n\nChanges in Belief Systems\n\nNew syncretic religions emerged that blended native and colonial traditions. Syncretisms happen everywhere, but in the Americas there are quite a few examples.\n\nSanteria - West African faith + Roman Catholicism- Vodun - West African spiritualism brought to caribbean- Candomble - ‚Äúdance to honor the gods‚Äù, Bantu + Brazil- Virgin of Guadalupe - Indigenous + Catholic\n\n4.6 Internal and External Challenges to State Power\n\nAs states expanded power, they were consistently met with resistance and rebellion. This is a constant in world history.\n\nPeople will always find a way to challenge state power, especially when survival is at stake. An internal challenge to power comes from people within the state such as citizens, enslaved people, or colonies. An external challenge to the state usually comes from neighboring states or other colonizing forces in the region.\n\nHere‚Äôs a few examples of how states were challenged between 1450-1750:\n\n### Queen Nzinga vs. Portuguese colonizers\n\nAfter the British and Dutch pushed the Portuguese out of India, they turned their attention to expanding their role in the African slave trade. In order to resist the Portuguese, Queen Nzinga of Ndongo (present-day Angola) initially made an alliance with them in order to protect the imports of guns for her people.\n\nOver time, the Portuguese became more exploitative to expand their powers. Queen Nzinga turned to the Dutch to help fend off the Portuguese. Together, they defeated the Portuguese in 1647, but the Dutch retreat from central Africa a year leaving the region vulnerable.\n\nEven into her 60s, Queen Nzinga personally led her troops into battle to protect their land. After her death, the Portuguese gained control of the region until well 1975.\n\nSerfs vs. Russian Central Government\n\nWhile the West African people were defending themselves from foreign attacks (external challenges), the Russians were dealing with internal challenges. Russian serfs had suffered oppression from the time of the Mongols and by the 15th century, the hardship and population of serfs had increased.\n\nFree peasants affected by heavy debts often lost their land and were forced into serfdom. Even as serfdom was abolished across Europe, Russian serfs were tied to the land through strict laws that had no opportunity for freedom. Escaped serfs began to organize as free peasants, especially in the steppes. They were called Cossacks.\n\nThe Cossacks under Yemelyan Pugachev rebelled against Catherine the Great. Although they experienced early success in their revolt, the Russian government eventually suppressed the rebellion. After that, oppression of peasants and serfs increased in an effort to avoid future conflict.\n\nMaratha (Hindu warriors) vs. Mughal Empire (Muslim)\n\nSouth Asia, which includes modern-day India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh, has a majority population of Hindus and a strong minority of Muslims. However, in the 17th century, the Mughals were a Muslim group that ruled the region.\n\nIn fear of minority rule, Hindu warriors called the Marathas rebelled. Between 1680-1707, the Maratha rebellion continued until they killed the Mughal leader Aurangzeb. His death effectively ended the Mughal Empire and the Maratha Empire ruled until 1818.\n\nPueblos vs. Spanish\n\nIn the Americas, Indigenous groups rebelled against European conquest. In present-day New Mexico, the entire Pueblo community rebelled against the Spanish for 10 days in 1680.\n\nThe Pueblo Revolt was successful and the Spanish retreated from the region. However, they returned in 1692 to recapture the lands. Some Pueblos again resisted, but the Spanish quickly massacred the small group of warriors. After that, many Pueblos migrated away in search of freedom.\n\nSlaves vs. Slave Owners\n\nJamaica had a growing slave population throughout this time period. In 1655, the British took control of the land forcing the Spanish out. As Spanish slave owners fled, many slaves escaped and formed settlements called Maroons. Revolts led by maroon communities had some success, but were ultimately squashed. There were groups of Maroons in Jamaica that were coerced into collaborating with Spanish militias in opposition to British incursions to Jamaica that eventually switched sides when Spain was failing there and signed a treaty with Britain.\n\nThe Gloucester County Rebellion in 1663 was the first slave revolt in the British American colonies. African slaves forged an alliance with white indentured servants in a rebellion to demand freedoms.\n\nThe revolt in Virginia failed and had serious consequences. In order to prevent white and black oppressed groups from conspiring, the Virginia government wielded racist policies to drive a wedge. They gave lower class white workers some rights to appease them and prevent further chaos. Black slaves remained enslaved for 200 more years.\n\nIndigenous Tribes vs. British Colonists (Metacom‚Äôs War)\n\nNative American tribes in New England were some of the first indigenous communities to be displaced by British colonists. The last stand against colonization was led by Metacom, also known as his colonial name King Phillip.\n\nBy the 1670s, the colonists and Natives had largely co-existed. However in 1675, Metacom mounted one last effort to drive the British off the Native land. Many tribes participated, although some sided with the English.\n\nThe colonists defeated the Natives after 14 months of bloody rebellion. Relative to the total population, Metacom‚Äôs War is the deadliest in US history.\n\nGlorious Revolution: English Protestants vs. English Catholics\n\nBack in England, things were getting complicated. England was a majority Protestant country, but had a Catholic minority. In 1685, the Catholic King James II ascended to the throne and began enacting anti-Protestant policies.\n\nWilliam of Orange was backed by Protestants to overthrow him. Without any bloodshed, William and Mary II pressured James II into exile and took the throne. William and Mary accepted joint powers with parliament and signed the English Bill of Rights. This is what‚Äôs known as the Glorious Revolution.\n\nüëâ Watch AP World teacher Evan Liddle breakdown what to know about resistance in the empires\n\n-----\n\n4.7 Changing Social Hierarchies\n\nThe expansion of trade on a global scale expanded both the upper elite class and the lower labor class. Global trade was insanely profitable and new elite classes enjoyed this wealth. Meanwhile, the population of forced laborers increased, further expanding the wealth gap.\n\nGunpowder Empires\n\nQuick reminder! The gunpowder empires included the Ottoman, Mughal, and Safavid.\n\nOttoman society was complex. The Sultans ruled the top of the pyramid and had powers to grant rewards to favored groups, such as soldiers. The middle class included the military, scholars, and other bureaucratic groups. Within the military, the Janissaries gained power and tried to overthrow the Sultan.\n\nFor its time, the Ottoman Empire practiced a surprising amount of religious tolerance for Jews and Christians. Although non-Muslims were forced to pay the jizya tax, many Jews that had been expelled from Spain and Portugal migrated to the Ottoman Empire, which expanded its power.\n\nMeanwhile, the Mughal Empire under Akbar the Great was even more tolerant as they abolished the jizya tax and supported the expansion of Sikhism (blend of Hinduism and Islam).\n\nWomen in the Ottoman Empire also experienced some expanded freedoms. Some women, such as Roxelana, climbed the social ladder from slave to wife of the Ottoman ruler Suleiman the Great. This was an extreme case of class mobility, but is an example of what was possible.\n\nChina\n\nThe Qing dynasty that overthrew the Yuan Mongols was ruled by the Manchus, a minority group. This was yet another historical example of a minority group ruling a majority group (see: Mughals, colonialism).\n\nAlthough the adopted political traditions in China, the Qing were committed to making the Manchu culture dominant. For example, they forced all men to wear their hair in queues (braided pigtail style), which was a power move to test loyalty to the throne.\n\nEthnic divisions: The majority Han ethnicity faced the most intolerance from the Qing. Often times, Han men would side with the Qing and carry out mass murders of Han men refusing to wear the Manchu hairstyle.\n\nEurope\n\nEuropean society was ruled by a royal family that gained enormous wealth from trade and corruption. Below the royals was a second class of the nobility, a small wealthy group that owned most of the land.\n\nNobles had influence in Parliament, but no power over the royals. The commoners were the lowest class and often challenged the nobility. After a failed revolt from commoners, Louis XIV committed to keeping power from the common people or the nobles, ‚ÄúI am the state.‚Äù\n\nJewish Diaspora\n\nIn the 15th and 16th centuries, Jewish communities faced increased anti-semitism in Western Europe. In Spain, Ferdinand and Isabella expelled the entire Jewish population, which sent them migrating all over the world.\n\nJews of Spanish descent that migrated to North Africa and the Middle East are referred to as Sephardic. Jewish populations descended from eastern and central Europe are called Ashkenazi. Both groups would experience a diaspora by the 20th century.\n\nThe Enlightenment and Scientific Revolution led to more tolerance for Jews as people contemplated natural rights. The Netherlands was particularly tolerant for Europe at the time, so many Jews migrated there and worked in the booming financial industry. This connection would later be used to scapegoat Jews for economic downturns.\n\nRussia\n\nIn Russia, the social classes were similar to the rest of Europe, except that they continued to practice serfdom. The Russian nobility, known as Boyars, were wealthy landowners. Below them were the merchants.\n\nAt the bottom was the largest class of peasants, many of whom sank into debt and were forced into serfdom. As serfs, they were completely tied to the land and sold when the land sold.\n\nThe Americas\n\nThe Americas are mostly defined by ethnic division during the period of 1450-1750. The most dramatic social changes happened in the Americas because of the influx of Europeans, decimation of Indigenous, and explosion of the African slave trade. Social classes in the Americas were based on race, which is a pivotal difference from the rest of the world. Slavery was a major driver of maritime trade relations.\n\nIn the British North American colonies, Europeans, Natives, and African slaves remained separate classes that rarely mixed. Although mixed children existed, primarily because of forced assaults, the societal norm was segregation and policies supported this tradition.\n\nIn the Spanish and Portuguese colonies, things were different. In an effort to genocide Indigenous culture, Europeans were encouraged to procreate with the Indigenous and African communities.\n\nAll of the ethnic combinations created new social classes organized by race with Europeans the top. The Peninsulares, or Europeans born in Spain or Portugal, were at the top and served as representatives of the royal crown. The Creole class was born in the Americas, but had the next highest privileges with their pure European descent.\n\nThe mixed classes, or the castas, had its own pyramid within a pyramid.\n\nMestizos = European + Indigenous\n\nMulattoes = European + African\n\nZambos = Indigenous + African (free)\n\nAll other Indigenous communities\n\nAfrican slaves üëâ Watch AP World teacher Donald D'Orto explain the changing social hierarchies\n\nList of Concepts & Vocabulary from Unit 4\n\n‚ö° Watch: AP World History - üé• Q&A Study Session\n\nSTUDY TIP: These are the concepts and vocabulary from period 4 that most commonly appear on the exam.
