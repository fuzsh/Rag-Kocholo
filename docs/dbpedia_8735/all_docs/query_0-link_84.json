        "text": "If you are a U.S. citizen traveling internationally, you will need a passport valid for six months beyond the completion of your Tauck journey for entry into the Czech Republic, Germany, Austria, Slovakia and Hungary. You are not required to obtain a visa to enter any of these countries for the short duration of this tour.\n\nThe U.S. State Department advises that: \"All foreigners seeking entry into the Czech Republic must also carry proof of a medical insurance policy contracted for payment of all costs for hospitalization and medical treatment while in the Czech Republic. According to the Czech Government, if you have a health insurance card or an internationally recognized credit card with health insurance included, it will generally be accepted as proof of insurance to enter the country.\"\n\nTauck offers insurance that is considered sufficient for this purpose. Please refer to the Tauck Travel Protection Product section above on this webpage for further details.\n\nIf you are a citizen of another country traveling internationally, you should contact an embassy or consulate of the Czech Republic, Germany, Austria, Slovakia and Hungary to determine what travel documentation is required.\n\nInternational maritime security guidelines require that your passport information be provided to us prior to your embarkation. You need to provide this information to us as soon as you book your cruise or boarding may be denied. Once you board the riverboat, your passport will be held by the purser temporarily to make copies.\n\nPlease Note: Longer stays abroad for any purpose may require additional travel documentation.\n\nWe recommend that you make at least two photocopies of all the travel documents that you bring with you. Include copies of the photo page of your passport that contains the date of issuance, the date of expiration and your citizenship. Secure one set of copies in the safe in your room while traveling and leave one set behind with someone at home who will assist you in the event your documents are misplaced, lost or stolen.\n\nTo facilitate Travel Requirements, destinations are increasingly utilizing online forms that require digital proof that you've successfully completed your submission (via an email, QR code, etc.) To ensure smooth travels and peace of mind, we strongly recommend all guests carry a personal smart phone and sign up for international data plans before traveling overseas.\n\nTRAVELING WITH CHILDREN AS A GUARDIAN: If you are traveling as the guardian of a child/children, we strongly suggest that you carry a letter from both parents of the child authorizing emergency treatment in the event of illness or accident. For travel abroad, many foreign countries have specific entry requirements for children under 21 who are traveling internationally without BOTH parents. (These requirements are in response to the increased incidence of children being abducted and taken abroad.) PLEASE NOTE THAT TAUCK IS NOT RESPONSIBLE for the disruption of travel caused by improper documentation for children traveling without both parents.\n\nAIRFARE: Airfare to and from this destination is not included in the journey cost. If purchasing your air elsewhere, it is very important to provide us with your confirmed arriving and departing flight information no later than 3 weeks before your arrival date. Flight information can be submitted to Tauck (or verified, if you've already provided it) in the My Account section of Tauck.com.\n\nTAUCK AIRPORT TRANSFERS: are included at the start and end of the journey between the airport and the Tauck hotel. Airport transfers are available for any pre tour or post tour hotel stays immediately consecutive to the tour, providing flight information is received in the Tauck office no later than three weeks in advance. Details on locating your transfer upon arrival to the tour start city will be included in your final documents.\n\nAIRLINES and CHECKED LUGGAGE: Due to space limitations during your Tauck journey, we ask that you please limit your checked luggage to one average-size suitcase per person. Besides complying with the Tauck restriction noted above, you should also be sure to research and comply with all airline baggage restrictions relating to your flights to and from your Tauck journey. Airlines have become much more strict in enforcing size and weight limits in recent years, and are free to revise luggage policies without notice. Researching and complying with airline luggage restrictions is the responsibility of the guest, and Tauck cannot be held responsible for any costs or disruptions to travel caused by the failure to research and comply with airline policies. PLEASE NOTE that if you are booked on a tour that includes on-tour flights, the checked luggage weight restrictions for these flights may be lower than the weight restrictions for your international flights.\n\nChecked Luggage – General\n\nDue to space restrictions, we ask that you please limit your checked luggage to one suitcase per person weighing no more than 50 pounds (23 kg) and with overall dimensions (length + width + height) not exceeding 62 inches (158 cm).\n\nBesides complying with the Tauck restriction noted above, you should also be sure to research and comply with all airline baggage restrictions relating to your flights to and from your Tauck journey. Airlines have become much stricter in enforcing size and weight limits in recent years, and luggage exceeding airline standards for size or weight may result in expensive overage fees or other consequences.\n\nAirlines are free to revise luggage policies without notice, and certain airlines have different baggage allowances for different classes of service. Researching and complying with airline luggage restrictions is the responsibility of the guest, and Tauck cannot be held responsible for any costs or disruptions to travel caused by the failure to research and comply with airline policies.\n\nTauck luggage tags will be provided by your Tauck Director on Day 1 of your itinerary. Please do not attach a Tauck luggage tag to any carry-on items, as the Tauck tags designate luggage that is to be handled and transferred by ground operators and hotel staff during your journey.\n\nCarry-on Luggage - General\n\nAlthough oversize bags and wheeled, carry-on luggage are popular for airline travel, they are often not convenient or appropriate for motor coach travel or for many on-tour flights. Most modern sightseeing motor coaches offer limited space for numerous or larger items. Space under seats or in the overhead rack is typically small, and designed to accommodate items like coats, hats, purses, and small camera bags, etc.\n\nFor your day-to-day travel while on tour, we recommend that you limit your hand luggage to a small, soft-sided carry-on piece, and that you bring only those items you need handy during the day such as make-up, medications, cameras, film, etc. Items too large to fit under the motor coach seat or on the overhead rack must be stored in the luggage bays beneath the motor coach, and may be inaccessible during daytime travel.\n\nHEALTH CONSIDERATIONS:\n\nBecause you will be cruising on a river and not on the open sea, you are never far from land and, therefore, there is no doctor on board. In case of emergency we can easily dock the boat and call for an ambulance or medical assistance.\n\nYour riverboat is registered in Basel, Switzerland. Please check with your health insurance provider to determine whether you are covered while traveling. If you will not be covered under your current policy, we strongly suggest that you arrange for adequate coverage while on tour.\n\nIf you have a medical condition that might limit your participation in activities, please consult your physician for pre-departure health advice and notify us as soon as possible, if you have not already done so. We will advise your Tauck Director accordingly.\n\nVACCINATIONS:\n\nIf you are a resident of the U.S., no other vaccinations are currently required for travel to the Czech Republic, Germany, Austria, Slovakia or Hungary. For complete vaccination and inoculation information, contact your physician, the public health service in your area, or the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) in Atlanta, Georgia by clicking here.\n\nIf you are a resident of another country, please contact an embassy or consulate of each of the Czech Republic, Germany, Austria, Slovakia or Hungary to determine whether additional vaccinations are required for your travel.\n\nMOBILITY:\n\nWhile a cruise from Munich to Budapest (or Budapest to Munich) is very relaxing and the pace leisurely, to enjoy all the tour has to offer, you should be in good health and able to walk reasonable distances, often over unpaved and uneven surfaces. Some of the most memorable sightseeing can only be accomplished on foot. There is a moderate to significant amount of walking during our excursions, often along cobblestone streets, and at many sites there are multiple stairs or steps; for the most part, however, the amount of walking you do is at your discretion.\n\nYour riverboat has four decks: Diamond, Ruby, Emerald, and Sun. An elevator runs between the Diamond Deck and Emerald Deck; there is no elevator access to the Sun Deck. There is no chair lift between any of the decks.\n\nBecause you will be cruising on a river and not on the open sea, you are never far from land and, therefore, there is no doctor on board. In case of emergency we can easily dock the boat and call for an ambulance or medical assistance.\n\nWe regret that this Tauck itinerary cannot accommodate wheelchairs or motorized scooters. Likewise, we regret that we're unable to provide individual assistance to guests with walking difficulties or other personal needs. The responsibility of the Tauck Director who accompanies your trip is to ensure that the larger group enjoys a relaxing and informative journey, and he or she cannot be relied upon to provide ongoing individual assistance to any one guest. Guests requiring such individualized assistance must be accompanied by an able-bodied companion who can provide it.\n\nUnfortunately, we cannot accommodate service animals on any river cruise for medical and legal reasons.\n\nSPECIAL DIETARY REQUESTS:\n\nThe restaurants, hotels, caterers and numerous other partners we work with all do their best to accommodate special dietary requests from Tauck guests. However, given the diverse nature of those food providers (from small wineries to grand hotels to world-famous restaurants in more than 70 countries worldwide), some of our partners are better able than others to accommodate such requests. We therefore cannot guarantee that all dietary requests can be accommodated at every meal. Also, please note that where dietary requests can be accommodated, choices will frequently be limited.\n\nSMOKING:\n\nOn board the riverboat, smoking is permitted in a limited area of the Sun deck. Smoking (including e-Cigarettes) is not permitted in any cabin, the restaurant, the lounge or any other interior space.\n\nBringing the right clothing for your trip is important – we've partnered with Necessary Gear who provide an \"easy-to-use, one-stop shop\" for your Tauck travel needs, specifically selected for this trip. Click here to visit their site.\n\nYour journey is designed with leisure in mind. Dress for comfort and convenience with a wardrobe that is flexible and allows for layering. Casual, cotton clothing is always advisable. A light jacket or sweater for the sun deck is also recommended. Pack comfortable yet sturdy walking shoes that have already been broken-in, as many of the sites visited were built centuries ago and have uneven surfaces, some steep inclines and many steps.\n\nDuring evenings aboard the riverboat, dress is resort casual. Items such as slacks and collared shirts are appropriate for men. For women, slacks, a dress or a skirt and blouse are suitable. For dinner and throughout the evening, guests should refrain from wearing shorts, t-shirts, flip-flops or sneakers. Your journey also includes one or two special occasion dinners, where a sport coat and tie for gentlemen and a dress/pantsuit for ladies are suggested. (Your Tauck Director will advise you prior to those evenings.)\n\nBathrobes, slippers and hairdryers are provided in each guest room at the hotel(s) and in each cabin on board the riverboat.\n\nValet laundry service is available at the hotel(s) and on the riverboat for a fee. There is no valet dry cleaning available on the riverboat. Ironing facilities on the riverboat are available by request to the front desk. Category 7 cabins feature their own irons and ironing boards.\n\nWe recommend that you pack an adequate supply of your prescription medication in its original container to last through your entire journey, together with a copy of your doctor's prescription or a letter from your health-care provider on office stationery explaining that the medication has been prescribed for you, a list of the generic names of your medication, your travel documents and a change of clothing in your carry-on bag to avoid any inconvenience in the event that your flight or luggage is delayed. No medications are sold on board the riverboat.\n\nWe recommend you pack the following items for your cruise on the Danube:\n\nFlat, rubber-soled walking shoes for onboard\n\nSturdy but comfortable walking shoes that have already been broken-in for onshore\n\nCasual daytime wear – shorts, slacks, long and short-sleeved shirts\n\nSport jacket and optional tie for men\n\nCasually elegant evening wear for ladies\n\nSunglasses, sunscreen, hat\n\nSwimwear\n\nGym wear\n\nA light sweater or jacket for higher elevations or a breezy night\n\nCamera, lenses, batteries, memory cards and chargers\n\nTravel alarm clock/ cell phone with alarm functions\n\nRain poncho and collapsible umbrella\n\nReusable zipper-lock bags or other waterproof bags\n\nDaypack for camera equipment\n\nSundries and toiletries that may be difficult to find en route\n\nCopies of your travel documents that should be secured in the safe in your ship cabin while traveling"
