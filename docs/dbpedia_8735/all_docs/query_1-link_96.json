Currently, in the EEA there are more than 170 different models of driving licences in use.\n\nDriving licences issued in other European Union (EU) countries: documents and deadlines to be complied with\n\nDriving licences issued by countries belonging to the European Union and the European Economic Area (EEA – Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway) are valid in Portugal until the expiry date indicated on the driving licence.\n\nHowever, drivers who establish residence in Portugal have a duty to inform the IMT Regional or District Office of their area of residence within 60 days, failing which, you will be subject to penalty.\n\nDrivers should therefore contact IMT and provide the following documents:\n\nForm 13 IMT\n\nA photocopy of your driving licence but also take your licence with you for comparison purposes\n\nAn identification document and proof of residence in national territory.\n\nIn the case of lifetime driving licences, once a driver has notified IMT of residence, a two-year administrative time limit is entered into the document issued (National residence record of drivers with a Community licence).

Driving without a valid licence is punishable with a fine. Should you let more than two years elapse after the deadline, without revalidating your licence, you will be required to take a driving test to obtain a new licence.\n\nTime limits for renewing an expired driving licence\n\nIf you do not observe the revalidation deadline you are committing a road offence should you drive with an expired driving licence. After two years and up to a limit of five years, without having revalidated a licence, you will have to sit a practical test.\n\nIf a driving licence is not revalidated within five years, it will be cancelled. For all legal purposes, holders of cancelled driving licences are considered as unqualified to drive.\n\nCompulsory medical examinations to prove fitness to drive\n\nIf you wish to revalidate your driving licence for group 1 (car), categories AM, A1, A2, A, B1, B and BE, mopeds and agricultural tractors, you must provide a medical certificate after you reach 60 years of age. Moreover, if your licence has a 137 restriction (i.e. requirement for an early medical assessment), you must always provide a medical certificate. A Certificate of Psychological Competence (CPC) is only required if your licence has a 138 restriction.\n\nIf your licence is in group 2 (heavy vehicles) you must always provide a medical certificate and CPC when revalidating.\n\nIf you require a CPC, you should scan and send when submitting the online request. If you need a medical certificate, the doctor issuing the certificate sends it by email to IMT.\n\nDocuments to be submitted by an EU citizen when exchanging a licence\n\nWhen exchanging a driving licence the following documents must be submitted:\n\noriginal valid full driving licence\n\nidentification document and proof of residence in national territory\n\nTax Identification Number\n\nan electronic medical certificate issued by a doctor for drivers of all categories\n\nfavourable psychological assessment certificate issued by a psychologist for Group 2 drivers: vehicles of categories C1, C1E, C, CE, D1, D1E and DE and drivers of categories B and BE driving ambulances, fire department vehicles, patient transport, school transport and passenger car rental vehicles.\n\nExchanging a driving licence issued by a foreign country for an EU licence\n\nAny person holding a driving licence issued by a foreign country can exchange such a licence for a Portuguese driving licence.\n\nYou will need to submit:\n\na full driving licence\n\nan identification document proving residence in Portugal (any identification document issued by the Portuguese State, except a passport)\n\nan electronic medical certificate, issued and sent by the doctor to IMT via the Internet, required for all licence categories\n\na declaration, issued by the counterpart entity (foreign entity issuing the licence) or consular body, certifying that the licence is authentic and indicating:\n\nthe date of issue and expiry of the licence\n\nthe categories of vehicles which the driver may drive, with the dates of validity and the restrictions on each category\n\nif your licence is not written in Portuguese, Spanish, French or English, you also need to have your licence translated into Portuguese, certified by the Portuguese embassy or consulate (or by another Member State of the European Union) in the country where the licence was issued\n\nif your licence includes group 2 categories, you also need a Certificate of Psychological Competence (CPC).\n\nDocuments and requirements for non-EU citizens when exchanging a licence\n\nWhen exchanging driving licences issued by foreign countries which are not signatories to International Road Traffic Conventions holders shall also be required to pass the driving test for each category held.
