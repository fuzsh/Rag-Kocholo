'38, Feb. 22 Peterson, Harold L. Jr. '42, Feb. 24 Gliddon, Gordon H. '26 Ph.D., Mar. 14\n\n1900\n\nThe Class of 1900 has suffered an irreparable loss in the death of WALTER POLAND RANKIN, our President and Trustee of the Class Fund. Words are entirely inadequate to express the debt the Class and Dartmouth owe to this stalwart, loyal, and devoted classmate.\n\n\" While looking at television one evening Walter had a shock, and without fully gaining consciousness, he passed away the next afternoon, January 29. He lived at 20 Chapel Street in Brookline, Mass. Funeral services were held February 1 in the Forsyth Chapel, Forest Hills Cemetery, Forest Hills, Mass. This service was largely attended by Dartmouth friends. The music consisted of Dartmouth songs played as hymns, and the well-loved gospel hymn, \"God be with you, till we meet again,\" which was written by Walter's uncle. The Class was represented by Cap Jenkins and his daughter, Ruth Bean, our class baby. Interment was in the family lot at the Forest Hills Cemetery.\n\nWalter Poland Rankin was born in St. Johnsbury, Vt., on March 26, 1878, the son of Andrew Everts and Isabell Emma Rankin, and stepson of H.C. Cushman '87. The family moved to Boston where Walter prepared for college at the Boston Latin School. Although he was accepted for admission to Harvard College he chose instead to come to Dartmouth, the college of his grandfather and stepfather.\n\nIn college Walter was an outstanding man and an active participant in Class and College affairs. He was a member of DKE, Palaeopitus, Casque and Gauntlet, the freshman football team, the varsity football squad for two years, the dramatic club, chairman of the junior prom committee, and at. Commencement as class president he delivered the introductory address.\n\nOn graduation Walter became associated with the Cushman-Rankin Co., manufacturers of leatherboard with a mill in Bath, N.H., and offices in Boston. For more than 50 years, until his retirement in 1952, he was treasurer of the Cushman-Rankin Co. and its counterpart, the International Leather Co. Through this long period he proved himself an alert and able businessman. He suffered the ups and downs of a productive enterprise with equanimity. On May 8, 1901 he married Alice Louise Meserve, a Smith graduate. On the same date in 1961, at the home of their daughter in Springfield, Mass., these two fine people celebrated their 60th wedding anniversary surrounded by children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren.\n\nSince graduation Walter Rankin along with Nat Emerson and Clarence McDavitt has labored to cement the feeling of unity, loyalty, and interest in the class, and has elaborated the idea of a 1900 family. Through the years since graduation Walter has been regularly and unanimously elected president of the Class. He served in this capacity for 63 years, and this honor shall be his forever. As president he has been the mainspring and the moving spirit in getting a large number of the Class to attend reunions and round-ups. His enthusiasm, devotion, active interest, and effective appeal is attested by the fact that, beginning with our 10th reunion and with almost monotonous regularity at five-year intervals thereafter the Class of 1900 has been awarded, at Commencement time, the cup for having the highest percentage of living graduates present in Hanover. All honor is due to Walter for this achievement. He was a very modest man and shunned publicity. His kindly interest, his affection, and his almost emotional attachment for every member of our fellowship will be long remembered by those who survive. Added to all else he was a home-loving man, a devoted husband, father, grandfather, and great-grandfather.\n\nHe was survived by his wife, Alice Rankin, a daughter, Marjory, three sons, Andrew '27, Walter Jr. '26, and Kenneth, six grandchildren, and five great-grandchildren.\n\nAs this notice is being prepared for publication, we learn of the second tragic blow to the Rankin family - the death of son Andrew on March 8.\n\n1903\n\nFRED W. BAKER died suddenly in his law office at Lancaster, N.H., February 4, 1963 of natural causes. Fred was born in Lancaster, July 24, 1881. His mother died while he was about a year old and his father later married Miss Cummings who was the only mother he ever knew. Fred never married.\n\nGraduated with highest honors at Lancaster Academy, he received his A.B. from Dartmouth in 1903 and later his LL.B. from Harvard Law School. For a short period between Dartmouth and Harvard he taught at Lancaster Academy. Fred practiced law in Boston for some three years, then returned to Lancaster in 1911 where he practiced until his death. In the earlier years he did considerable work in connection with timberlands and farms but in his later practice confined his activities largely to abstracting and probate law. Fred had a fine collection of Lancaster historical memorabilia and editorials and other data covering a period of 50 years or more. He had many friends, among them many of the younger generations with whom he liked to visit. He had grown to be a part of Lancaster life and history and his passing will be greatly regretted. In College he was a member of Alpha Alpha Omega fraternity.\n\nFred was a member of the North Star Lodge, F & AM, North Star Chapter R.A.M., Lancaster, the Coos County Fire Association, and the New Hampshire Bar Association.\n\nMembers of the family include a sister, Mrs. Z.

Dr. Wallace Grant Fiske officiating. Burial was in Fairview Cemetery. Memorial contributions may be made in his memory to Oak Hill School for the Blind or the Memorial Fund of the Church of the Redeemer, Universalist.\n\nQuite a few Dartmouth men attended the funeral and Dr. Thacher W. Worthen represented the Class of 1907.\n\nWe all salute the memory of a loyal Dartmouth man.\n\n1908\n\nARTHUR THEODORE ANDERSON passed away in the Concord, N.H., Hospital on the morning of February 10 after a short illness with pneumonia.\n\nArt was born May 9, 1883, in East Boston, and prepared for Dartmouth at East Boston High School.

Brown Manufacturing Co. of Tilton, N.H., manufacturers of the Tilton Endless Transmission Belt, remaining there until his retirement four years ago.\n\nOn June 15, 1928 he married Margaret Clough of Loudon, N.H. On coming to Tilton they moved to Margaret's former home, a small farm in Loudon Center, where for about 20 years they raised turkeys for a hobby, but last fall they sold the farm and moved to 95 School Street in Concord, where Margaret plans to continue residence.\n\nArt served the town of Loudon at times as auditor and trustee of trust funds, headed various fund drives, and served as director of the Merrimack Valley Regional Association. He was a member of Mt. Tabor Masonic Lodge of Boston.\n\nHe leaves his wife, Margaret; a sister, Eve Anderson of Roslindale, Mass.; and a niece, Mrs. Horace S. Nichols of Weston, Mass.

Having been interested in flying and holding a pilot's license, he planned to return to South America as a manufacturer's representative but overshot a runway in Pennsylvania and cracked up. He then took courses in radio, TV, and electronics and at the time of his death was working on a computer.\n\nMilt was a Scottish Rite Mason and a Shriner. He is survived by a son, Sterling Blanchard Hager of Holliston, Mass., to whom the Class extends its sympathy.\n\nDartmouth meant much to Milton and 1909 has lost another of its loyal members.\n\nALONZO GRAHAM HEARNE passed away at his home, 68 Rogers Road, Kittery, Me., on March I, 1963.\n\nKit was born in Amesbury, Mass., on March 15, 1886.

By November he had recovered to some extent but late in December it was quite apparent that his recovery was not progressing as anticipated. Nevertheless, with unflinching courage he arose each day, went through the usual routine, even including short rides, insisting that he not \"rust unburnished but shine in use.\" Warnings of his failing heart only seemed to drive him harder.\n\nHe is survived by his wife Susan, and a sister Margaret, both of Plymouth, Mass.
