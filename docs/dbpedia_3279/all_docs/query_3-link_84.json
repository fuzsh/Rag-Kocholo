        "text": "Reluctantly, 17-year-old Gretchen leaves her American home to live with her father, who has just moved into a resort in the German Alps with his new family. Arriving at their future residence, they are greeted by Mr. König, her father's boss, who takes an inexplicable interest in Gretchen's mute half-sister Alma. Something doesn't seem right in this tranquil vacation paradise. Gretchen is plagued by strange noises and bloody visions until she discovers a shocking secret that also concerns her own family.\n\nMac Brewster (Benny) is head of an advertising firm that is in debt. The million-dollar Townsend Silver contract could save the firm, but the wealthy playboy Alan Townsend (Arlen) wants an amateur from high society rather than a professional model to become \"the Townsend Girl.\" Upset that she was passed over sight-unseen as a professional, Brewster's top model (Lupino) goes to Miami with plans to bump into Townsend and pass as a society debutante.\n\nThree California beach buddies begin to realise there is more to life than waxing down their surfboards as they ditch their alcoholic and unruly ways to go fight in the Vietnam War.\n\nAfter Jonathan Harker attacks Dracula at his castle (apparently somewhere in Germany), the vampire travels to a nearby city, where he preys on the family of Harker's fiancée. The only one who may be able to protect them is Dr. van Helsing, Harker's friend and fellow-student of vampires, who is determined to destroy Dracula, whatever the cost."
