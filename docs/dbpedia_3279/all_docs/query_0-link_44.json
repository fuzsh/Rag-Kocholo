The Hause family attended the First Baptist Church of Christ in Royalton, organized in 1822 \"at the schoolhouse that stood near the graveyard in the neighborhood that is now called Locust Tree.\" The first church was built in 1823, then moved a half-mile east to a new building in 1869, and the name was changed to the Royalton Community Church. (Locust Tree is now known as Dysinger's Corners, as that family opened a hotel and post office there.) A cemetery stood next to the original church/schoolhouse. Jane Hause died on September 8, 1850. Like everything else concerning Jane, there were few details handed down about the death. She was buried down the road from the farm at the church cemetery.

The couple were married in 1951. Settling first in Paramus, they welcomed five children to their family before moving to Upper Saddle River, where they lived for more than 43 years. Once her children were all in school, Katie started her career as a nurse, working in nursing homes before becoming a school nurse, employed first at the Bogart Elementary School in Upper Saddle River, and later at Pascack Valley and Emerson High Schools.

Katie was an artist on many levels, and loved to write poetry, especially to celebrate special occasions, and also enjoyed drawing and painting. She was a gifted gardener, and loved to beautify their yard in Upper Saddle River with flowers, especially daisies. Katie and Ray moved to Cedar Crest Village in Pompton Plains about 15 years ago, and greatly enjoyed being active with the Protestant Community there.

Joe was born and raised in Niagara Falls where he attended LaSalle High School and captained its football team. After marrying his wife Patty (the former Patricia Jane Parsons of Royal Oak, Michigan) and graduating from Antioch College, Joe served as a naval officer in Washington D.C.

She died on 8 Sep 1984 in Getzville, Erie, New York.\n\nLaban Augustus Hause (1831-1906)\n\nLaban Augustus Hause was born on 10 March 1831. He moved to St. Clair Co., Michigan in the mid-1850's after marrying Sarah Deissinger on 20 Sep 1854. and his brother John J. Hause (b. 18 Oct 1829), their wives (the Dysinger sisters) had each been willed about a hundred acres of prime farmland in Lockport by their late fatherenough for a small private farm.\n\nBut Laban and John had the bright idea of selling that expensive New York land, and using the money to buy more property in an area where the land was cheaper. The plan was to move west and carve out their own place from the wilderness... and the new frontier of Michigan was beckoning.\n\nSo in the mid-1850s, John, Laban, and Basheba Hause, along with cousins-in-law Daniel and Nicholas Dysinger, headed to the new state with their familieseither taking a steamship up the Erie Canal, or by land using teams of oxen or mules, towards the untamed wilderness (read: cheap land).\n\nThe group moved to Riley Center, St. Clair County, Michigan, and started over. Laban and Sarah settled a large section of wilderness on the border of St. Clair and Macomb counties, and local \"Otchipwes\" (Ojibwe Indians) helped them survive until Spring, when Laban could clear the trees and brush to build a farm, on what is now 13185 Belle River Road in Memphis, Michigan.\n\nHe and Sarah then sold the 100 acres of property that she had inherited from her late father in Lockport, for $500. The document was signed by Sarah's mother, Catharine, and accepted by Laban \"House\" and Sarah in St. Clair county, Michigan. (On the next page in the book of deeds, Catherine sold more of the Lockport land willed to her other children, including Eve Dysinger-Hause.)\n\nThe various Hause and Dysinger families then settled in, and even began to expand: County records show that on the 13th of May, 1857, 21 year-old Basheba married Charles H. Oaks, 23, of Riley. The witnesses were \"Loban\" Hause & John J. Hause, also of Riley; the wedding was performed by Minister William P. Russell.\n\nLiving on the edge of the Michigan wilderness left the Hause family far away from doctors, hospitals, and the superior medical attention available back in New York (which in truth wasn't all that great, anyway). There were only ten licensed physicians in all of St. Clair County. They charged from five dollars for minor surgeries, up to a hundred dollars for major ones. There was also a fee of five to twenty-five dollars for midwifery, which Sarah needed in 1857 for the birth of a child:\n\nElma Hause Jackson (1857-1942)\n\na. Elma Jane Hause was born on 16 Mar 1857. After the death of her mother, Sarah was raised by Laban and his second wife, Melissa Sanderson-Hause. Elma married William Jackson (b. 8 Feb 1852 in England), a Freight Agent for the Owensboro and Nashville Railroad, on 14 Nov 1874 (wedding announcement). Elma died on 3 Mar 1942 in Montclair, Essex County, New Jersey (Elma in her old age). They're buried together at Rosehill Elmwood Cemetery, Owensboro, Daviess County, Kentucky. Their children:\n\ni. Charles Hause Jackson was born on 25 Sep 1875. Charles lived in Upper Mountclair, New Jersey, and worked for an engineering firm in Manhattan.

Many of the photographs, obituaries and ceremonial announcements on the following pages are from those scrapbooks. Charles died in Aug 1962.\n\nii. William Carlisle Jackson was born on 7 May 1884. He died on 16 Oct 1888 in Owensboro, Daviess County, Kentucky and is buried beside his mother.\n\nSarah died on 16 Mar 1859 after complications from giving birth to their daughter, Elma. Laban then remarried, to a woman named Melissa Sanderson (1839-1921). Laban died on 14 Mar 1906 in Memphis, MI (see his Death Certificate here).

Carleton Marchant Hause, Jr., was born November 25, 1939 in Detroit, Michigan to Carleton Sr. and Jeanne Brunner Hause. Having grown up on the shore of Lake Erie with his parents and sister, Marjorie, Carl had an adventurous spirit and enjoyed boating and fishing. He graduated from Eastern Michigan University with a degree in Education. While attending college, Carl met his future bride, Martha Ellen Wenk, and after five brief months of dating, they were married on June 13, 1959. In July of 1961, along with their newborn son Jeffrey, they followed his parents and sister out to San Diego, California where Carl began his teaching career. He continued in the line of educators that started with his great- great- grandmother when he began teaching math at Washington Junior High School in Vista, California.

Parker novels. He was also an avid game player, loved to research genealogy, and enjoyed morning walks on the beach. Carl's retirement also afforded him time to more deeply pursue his faith journey and love for the Lord. The primary way he lived out his faith was through his membership at King of King's Lutheran Church. There he served as a church council member, financial secretary, Sunday School teacher, Men's Prayer Breakfast leader, and Intern Committee Chairman. During his teaching career, Carl was involved with Sunrise Kiwanis, and in retirement was heavily involved with the Vista Golden K Kiwanis, and their scholarship foundation, where he continued to show his care and concern for students. He also volunteered at Meals with Love.\n\nCarl was very proud of his grandchildren and loved to visit them in New York, Stockton, Napa, Denver and enjoyed being involved in all their activities. Carl loved teaching and coaching as it gave him the opportunity to impact the lives of students and athletes. He was known for his great sense of humor and it gave him a unique ability to break down walls and bring people together in classroom and life situations. Carl was a great man loved by so many.\n\nHe is survived by his wife Marti, his sister Margy, son Jeff and his wife Lori Ann, daughter Kathy and her husband Hal Larsen, son Eric and his wife Mary, daughter Michele and her husband John Houston, and eight grandchildren: Sasha Larsen, Dylan Larsen, Camille Larsen, Madeline Hause, Atticus Hause, Phin Lee Hause, and Sara and Avery Houston.
