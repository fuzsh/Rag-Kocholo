        "text": "My grandfather Reginald Tucci owned Club Utica in west side of buffalo for almost 40 yrs and just found out they tore the building down,it was a great family oriented bar and great food, I was young at the time so I don't remember too much I have lots of pictures from there so it brings back some great memories for me If anyone can lef me know some more info about the club let me be know please. I just recently lost my grandfather a few months ago and I like to hear more thanks and God Bless...Need help in learning the full name of a man. His first name is Mark. He appeared in a club act at the Royal Arms in Buffalo prior to 1963, possibly in 1962., possibly earlier.\n\nHis engagement at the Royal Arms was in the weeks or months ahead of September of the year in question, which is known, because I have evidence that there was a cancellation by Mel Torme at the Royal Arms in September of that year.\n\nMark had a friend or booking agent named Al, and a relative named Sharon Malamud, which may indicate that Mark's last name was Malamud. But I'm not sure. Any information will be joyously received. Thanks.\n\nLeo Vanderpot (email: leov10571@yahoo.comI was in the Army back in 1965, 66, worked at the Federal Building next door to the the Anchor Bar, I was a medic and we gave the physicals for the Military there during the Vietnam war, After work I hung out at the Anchor Bar and the Blackstone Bar, Allen St. weekends I hung out on Chippewa St. Ciros, Fisherman’s Wharf, Green Door, also up on Elmwood Ave. Dugans Bar, V.I.P. Lounge. Had some great times up there, until I got busted in a fight in the Fisherman’s Wharf, spent a night in jail, also got lost a stripe in the Army for that fight. I came from South Jersey area, next to Philly and close to Atlantic City, n.j. I’m 73 now but remember Buffalo well.An old bartender from the original Casey's at 740 Hertel checking in; I also worked at Stuart Little's in N Tonawanda, the Showboat [foot of Hertel], helped open the old Bidwell Parkway into Casey's II [across from the No-Name Bar], the Packet Inn in N Tonawanda, and I believe a few others where bartenders of that era would 'guest-bar-tend' at different places. Hung out at the Masthead, No-Name, and Locker Room a lot and a small old-timey smokey bar on Grant St where the windows were so dingy and smoke-stained they looked like they were the first tinted windows in Buffalo. I remember the shooting at Aliottas, the mob hit outside of Roselands, YOW! And oh yeah, the dance and crazy bar on Grand Island that was a pretty good place to meet.across from wivb on elmwood was the buffalo sports garden. it had a large oval bar with half court basketball, a pitching speed and accuracy baseball game,a boxing ring for the dance floor. here I believe moshing got its start.just kidding. Their were a few other video game machines with a few TVs and super large projection unit.the perfect place to sweat out those beers.the last time I was there was in 1993 when they had arm wrestling competion for men and women. it was a sparse crowd and I don't think it lasted much longer ibeleive the owners had some connection with the buffalo athletic club next door.Oh man, seeing these posts is really bringing back a flood of great memories! Being from Fort Erie (Canada drinking age 21), we would side step that little hurdle by mearly drivin over a bridge. We already were quite familiar with Buffalo,(spending childhood goin back and forth across river all the time with our folks) so it was no big deal. If ya sorta looked 18 and had the price of a beer, and you didn't clown like a goofball, you were cool...ya had a Rolling Rock in your hand no problem. That is how we cut our teeth and learned to hang. Plus, there were never any hassles because you knew so many people. In summer, they were up in your hood (Crystal Beach), in winter, you were in theirs...Allentown! There were always Buffalo friends to hang out with. People who you knew since childhood. Birdies 19th Hole. I was DJ there for a few years back in 70's. Bobby Hens was my mentor in weirdness.\n\nLater, I worked for Bobby as DJ/bartender at The Outside Inn in Angola. Seems the underlying thread in all these postings is the huge amount of great LIVE music in and around Buffalo. The club scene was superb. From The Bona Vista to The Belle Starr. The Inferno, to the venerable McVans. Always somthin happnin. Miss those days. If you were there, you were there...and you can think back, and smile.(but don't try to hip anybody born after the mid 50's to it, because it's just too far beyond the realm of possabilty for them...bless their well trained consumerist souls) Smile at the times you and your buddies used to laugh your ass off gettn BUFFALOED IN BUFFALO! Here's to the loving memory of several million missing brain cells...you did not die in vain.\n\nLurchRegarding the intersection of Main and Transit, at that point Main St ran east and west. Transit Rd runs north and south. North was toward Lockport, south was toward Depew, west was towards Buffalo, and east was toward Batavia.\n\nOn the NW corner of Main and Transit was a strip plaza, which originally contained the Mona Kai restaurant. The Mona Kai eventually closed, in the late sixties-early seventies. In it’s place, a rock bar opened, the Yellow Monkey. It too eventually closed and reopened as something else, whose name I don’t recall. Possibly the Yankee Whaler.\n\nAs indicated, Melanie’s was on Main, but on the south side of Main, a few hundred feet west of Transit.\n\nIn response to Greg, the bar that was on the north side of Main, east of Transit, maybe a quarter or half mile out, was the Poor House. The Poor House’s time was from the late 60’s to at least sometime in the 70’s, maybe longer. I don’t recall what it became after the Poor House. Buffalo really had some great bars, and this site has truly been a trip down memory lane, especially the bars of the past mentioned in the comments. How I remember Rude Boys in the early-1980s. Yeah, it played Reggae, but I also remember everyone dancing to Men at Work's Down Under one night. It appeared small by bar standards, but it was popular! Uncle Sam's was cool, too, but the pre-mixed drinks were a drag. Anyone remember them? I must have downed 10-12 rum and cokes one night and did not have even a tinge of a buzz. So, I started ordering drinks that I knew they didn't have pre-mixed. Remember the Barber's Chair there? For $2, you sat in the Barber's Chair, they tipped you back, and poured three shots, one after the other, into your mouth. I saw some guys and gals go to the Barber's Chair an amazing number of times in one evening!Wow! Great memories! I practically lived at McVan's, had my first drink there in 1977 when I was 16!! Bambi didn't give damn, I think she knew most of us were under 18. Loved the bands I saw there - The Factor, Nosferatu, Cock Robin, Secret Savior, The Toys,...the list goes on. Shadracks was a blast, along with The After Dark, The Point After, The Woodshed (in NT), Hollywood Hugh's, Easy Street Pub (NT), Cassidy's, Casey's, Mr. Goodbar, River Rock Cafe (across from where McVan's was), Rockwell's in NF, saw Joan Jett at Uncle Sams, The Imperial Garage in NF, The Clover Club in NT. My sister took me to the Wa-Ha-Ki on River Rd. when I was about 14 (it burned down not too long after). The Webster Hotel in NT was a fun dive, so was Pringle's in Tonawanda. Well, now I'll have to make the grand tour and visit these places (or at least where they used to be)next time I'm back in Buffalo.Wow! Talk about a blast from the past!..I was from the Falls, so yeah, we had some cheap classics like DADDY's, JP Morgans, The Library, The Tree House, Club Miami, UNC's, BRAGGS, Rockwell's...but..I went to college @ Medaille..There the fun really began with Park Meadow, Gabels, Hotel California, Rude Boys and of course the immortal Cassidy's on Main.. My fondest memory was the 2001 Club near UB, as 97-Rock announced a surprise lunch-time concert featuring the Joe Perry Project, for FREE!..Imagine standng a few feet away from one of the greatest guitarist (Aerosmith) of all time!..Amazing!..\n\nI'd be remiss if i didn't recognize McVans, Shutter's & Boards, The Stardust, The Ailibi Lounge, The Sand Bar, Kelly's Korner, Nightmoves, hanging with the young Goo Goo Dolls at the Continental, bouncing in & out of No-Names, Caseys, Cole's & Mr GoodBar (free drinks 8-9 on Friday's), September's, Stage 1, Uncle Sams & the classic After Dark in Lockport.\n\nWow-- the good ole days - Cheap booze & EASY Women! -- BUFFALO/Niagara #1!!! Mark JYep. I remember \"Shadracks\" on Broadway near Bailey. You can still drive by the old building today and see the roof with SHADRACK'S spelled with different color shingles. The place has been closed and boarded up for years. The neighborhood has turned ghetto and not the best area to be around. We are lucky to have partied there back in the old days!\n\nBeen to \"Unger's\" but forgot where it was. I moved to Southern California back in the early 80's and returned back to Buffalo for vacations for many years afterwards. It was funny being from Buffalo and living in So Cal. I was always led to believe that So Cal had the best party bars in the world, well, compared to Buffalo, they come in 2nd because they (LA) are not even in the same league! I am PROUD to be from BUFFALO back in those days! Now I live the slow life in Central Tennessee! There was a bar \"Danny Sansone's\" on Abbott Road in South Buffalo back in the 1970's were I went a few times. I remember when the Miller Brewing Company was on strike (back around 1976-77) and no deliveries of Miller High Life were going on. Me and some chick drank up the entire stock of it at this bar. We had purchased about 12+ bottles of it EACH and had them lined up on the bar. When the other patrons tried to order Miller, the bartender pointed at us and said that we \"bought up the entire stock\". We had offers to buy our extras but declined. As you can imagine there were many upset people! Shane's Log Cabin- classic - people waited outside in the winter to get in- the funny thing was it was a dive- you had to pay to get in- the entertainment was great bartenders and great juickbox - no live bands- the place was so dirty that people were afraid to use our john's. I use to bring mixed drinks in the back parking lot to the Buffalo, P.D.- I remember once when we were closing up a guy was shot outfront- he was crawling towards our front door so we locked it- we were afraid if he died in our bar we would lose our liquor license. We had students- cops- bikers- seniors- homosexuals- pimps- prostitutes- and thieve's as our clientel. The Pink was not around then but Shane's would have made the Pink look subdued an the least. My name is Danny and i was a bartender there in the late 60's and early 70's. Erick who had a previous message on this board worked with me- someone should have written a book on this beloved hole in the wall.Does anyone remember the \"BUFFALO BAR BOOK\" that was sold at most of the bars from Niagara Falls to Ellicottville? I remember purchasing one for $10 and it had a few hundred bars listed in it. Bought it around 1978 and it was the best deal ever. If you presented the coupon for a specific bar, it entitled you to 1 FREE DRINK of ANYTHING! I remember each weekend was a free drunk. One weekend I'd hit all the bars on Seneca Street, the next weekend I'd get every joint in Ellicottville. There were 100's of bars to choose from and for $10/book, it was a good deal! I still have the book in storage and should post it! The only bar I remember on Union Road that had a volleyball setup out back was \"Holliday's\" but that was at the corner of Clinton Street if memory serves me right. Up near George Urban Blvd. was the old meat market \"T-Birds\" on the east side of Union in the old Ames Plaza. There is/was another bar (next to the Denny's) called \"Rhino's\" that was closed the last time I visited Buffalo about a year ago. I just found this site about a month ago and think it is GREAT to remember the past! This site is WNY memory lane at it's best. I played in bands named the Sterlings (the Mug on Hertel), Bridge, Penny Farthing, the Fourum, Rumble & The Sidepipes, the Colleagues, Rare Blend in the mid to late 60's and 70's and played in so many of the bars listed on this site and around WNY. Some popular bands at the time were Barbara Sinclair and the Pincushions, The Road, Stan & The Ravens, The Rising Sons, Raven, Chenango, The Rubber Band, Parkside Revival, Chick & The Diplomats, Donna Rose, The Venturas, Wilmer & The Dukes, Penny Farthing, Cock Robin, Weekend, The Vibratos, Talas, Kathy L. & The Playboys, Ceasar & The Romans, Big Wheelie & The Hubcaps...just to name a few. There was music 7 nights a week...all styles...everywhere in WNY. Thanks to all who posted pix . Those who leave WNY always carry it in their hearts.Thanks to KGS for remembering my dear father, jack Heisler, who owned Michey's Grill on Allen Street and the Beef and Ale on Main and Winspear Sts. Both of these places had their unique following but for anyone who ever frequented them -- they knew my Dad as he was memorable, For many, he poured drinks but probably also helped you out, gave you an empathetic ear or watched over you if you were lonely or strung out, He may have even invited you to our home for a meal or to not be alone at the holiday, He was a very dear man and I was so happy to see someone remember him in these comments. - Ali Baba's was located downstairs in the Roycroft Inn. They had a firepit with pillows, and plants growing underneath a glass floor.\n\n- I believe the Lucifer's Den became Rogues II, a top 40 type of bar.\n\n- Bailey ave had a lot of great bars - Ray's Antique lounge, McGillicutys? etc...Mighty Taco afterwards when they were just getting started and served the meat out of giant vats\n\n- I remember partying in Dubels after they closed for good. The guys from the King Edward hotel had bought it and tried to turn it into a similar type of club. There were about 10 of us just sitting around the bar with them reminiscing. It was a big place, in a not so good neighborhood, which led to its demise. What a historical place - many top politicians in Buffalo used to frequent it for years.For the people looking for Bailo's info and pics. The place burned in '78. A friend of mine was working there as a waitress and she used to bring beef of wecks to me (after her shift) while I was spinning records at Brandy's (disco) on Losson Rd. A friend loaded a pic of the Bailo's fire on my Facebook page and I can share it if you'd like to see it. That restaurant was my favorite place as a kid and I was sad when it burned. Corner of Bailey & E. Lovejoy -- hence the name -- and the lot still is vacant...My older brother and I worked at Mulligan's Brick Bar from when they opened in the late 60's till 1979. My brother Tom was the doorman who was shot twice by the guy who also killed his partner in crime. The night he was shot was also the first date I had with my first wife, we spent the night in the hospital emergency room while Tom was in Surgury. At the time of the shooting my brother and I lived in the apartment upstairs of the Locker Room on At Delaware and Delevan. Ialso went to a bar across from Kissing Bridge called \"the Wedelyn\" which, in the late 60's,was the first bar that had cages with GOGo dancers in them!Hey Gab,\n\nThe place you are looking for was Benny Dubels. I cant remember the exact location but it was in south Buffalo. It was the place where the younger crowd went and was a step or two above most of the hangouts. My favorites were Mischlers and the Cafe Carlyle on Abbott Road. In the summer, for two years, I used to tend bar part time at a joint called Lerczaks at Angola. This was one wild assed place. I think that it had an insurance fire sometime during the seventies. Now living in Denver but loved Buffalo while I lived there. Still go to see a Bills game once and a while. I realize this is a longshot but I am wondering if anyone remembers a place (Maybe even a short lived establishment) from the 50's or 60's that was owned or maybe partially owned by my dad John \"Jack\" Higgins.\n\nNot sure if it was restaurant/bar or just a restaurant. Think it served TexMex or hotdogs maybe. May have been called Jack's or something with Jack in it maybe.\n\nI don't know how long it was open but it eventually folded due to cashflow issues.\n\nI realize this is not much information to go on but it is important to me as it was a story my dad used to tell about and he recently passed away.\n\nAny photos, the location, any memories or anything regarding this place or him at all would be helpful. Or even if anyone knew him. He was born in Buffalo,NY but moved to Wisconsin with his father when he was between 10-13yo. He returned to Buffalo after exiting the military around 1949. He then moved back to Wisconsin again in the 60's, where he lived out the rest of his life.\n\n(Place could have been established anywhere btwn 1949-1963.)\n\nWhen he passed away, I lost alot of history/stories that I never thought to write down because I guess I just thought my dad was invincible.This page should have a search box so we'd know if the places we remember have already been mentioned. Wasn't there an Act II or Act III? Didn't one of those have something like a fire pit inside? Laurel & Hardy's, both Poorhouses, the Barn, He & She, reaching to Batavia, there was a bar that had something to do with cavemen and gangsters or prison? Loved Barrelhead and all the bands there; can't remember the name of a couple --- one had a singer who wore knickers and another had a guy named Bruce, both were good bands, but don't remember the names. Anybody remember a band from Canada (I think) called Dennison Stars? Their music was \"90% British\" (spoken with a British accent.) My bar crush was in the Warlocks, but I got so incredibly nervous around him that I usually blubbered out the most ridiculous things when talking to him. I was a total idiot! Oh, to be young, in love and incredibly stupid!! Those indeed were the days.....Hello. I am wondering if someone can assist me. I'm trying to find the location of a bar that was once in the Kensington-Bailey area. It was owned by woman named Peg (whom my family called Aunt Peg though we were not related). My uncle, Tony Linderman, was a bartender and bouncer in the joint after he retired. The name of the bar might have been Harkey's or something similar. I remember it being a small place with bar on the right and a few tables on the left. I think the building was a \"V\" shape. Even in the 1960's my aunt would not allow women to sit at the bar \"unattended.\" Does this bar sound familiar to anyone? If so, what would the address be? Any information would be helpful.Just found this because I am looking for a pic of Regan's bar just off the Grant by Buff State. Went to Buff State '83-'87 and I lived in that place the most! Went back to Buffalo a few weeks ago for the first time since graduating with my college suitemates. Roamed around. Really upsetting to see how Regan's (State Side must've been the new name), was closed and the area really run down. Silly but I can't get it out of my head. Or how Masthead was demolished and how the Inn Between was closed too. Reading through this, I remember Cassidy's, and turtle races (am I right?). Very cool pics. Cool to see that this site is still up but I'm sad that no one has any pictures of the old Turgeon Restaurants. I used to work for them from '79 - '87 overseeing all their music and disc jockeys. I DJ'd at the Stacks/BBC, Boardwalk Cafe, The Sign of the Steer, the Library in Niagara Falls, and Ali Baba's. Then I moved onto the Stuffed Mushroom when the drinking age changed and everyone skidaddled to Canada. If anyone has pictures of the inside or outside of any of these locations (even the restaurants like the Crouching Lion, Riverside Inn, etc) please feel free to share. I'd love to see them. Here's to the good old days in Buffalo - I'll always remember heading down to Eduardo's after the BBC closed for some after hours fun and stopping at the Mighty Taco along the way. Happy, drunken, irresponsible times...! I'm still happy and occasionally drunk but there's no time for irresponsibility...! Later, gang...!To Paul D. @ Pastime..I left Buffalo in 69 and used to fo to the Pastime a bit...grat bar and Buff State Crowd. I went back to visit before the army in 73 and it was still there but started to have that 70s dico look with a DJ, t shirts etc. Nothing remanins the same but still it was good to see it one last time with my new wife of a year or so who had to take the \"Buffalo Bar Tour\" with me to understand my college roots and why I love bars. 40 years later still with her and we still do bars all the time..she remebers when I introduced her back in the day to Bailos and the wick with roast beef. Some of the best days of my life...I have a picture in black and white of the outside of Caseys in 1969. I lived on North Patk Avenue at the time in a rented flat with 3 other roomates. and went to U.B. I would stop by on Friday after school and get a burger on his old fashioned grill. I would also get a beer or two on Sunday nights. I remember when Casey's son..forgot his name (want to say Chip?) afterall these years..came back from the service..like so many Buffalo Bars back then, had a great jukebox as well.@Laura\n\nI was at Brinks on Elmwood (later Merlin's) and also at the Inner Circle. Remember the Parkway, which became J.P. Bullfeathers?! And (I think!) at Anderson and Elmwood, in what later was enlarged to become Jimmy Mac's, was a little piano bar. Remember the name? How about Sunday's at Elmwood and Breckenridge? Or was it closer to Auburn? I forget; I was usually tripping when I wandered into that place...it was in an old house.\n\nThanks for the reminder of \"The Inner Circle\"...that was a very hip place where all the old coffee house/beat crowd hung out after Laughlins was no longer the hip place to be, as it had been back in the days of the coffee house craze, when the Grosvenor library was on Franklin and Edward.I used to go to McVan's when I was in college at UB. That was in the mid to late 1970's. Anyone remember the name of the band at McVan's that had the violin player? They used to play a mean version of Vulcan Worlds and Song of the Pharaoh King by Return to Forever. They also covered Genesis stuff. I've been trying to recall that band name for years. They were great, especially the drummer who reminded me of Ginger Baker in his style. Is McVan's still around?I remember all the Bars. I played guitar in a band called The XL's. Played Ciro's lounge on Chipewa, and dozens of spots all over Western New York. Often wonder where Donna Potter is and how she made out...Anyway The Mug, McVans, Dirty Dicks Bathhouse, The Great Gatsby, Pierce Arrow was on Evans, and The Pierce Arrow was on Center across from The Barrlehead. The Poor House East and West, Schonies, Garcias, I was doorman for the place late 80's, Ciprianis owned it. Two great brothers, Masthead, Binky Browns, No Names, I won a Halloween Contest at Mr. Goodbar late 70's, have pictures, I was out and about 6 nights a week for 15 years and worked two jobs and went to school nights. I can tell you things about the Buffalo Night life that staggers the imagination..Now just where are all those ladies and thanks for the memories.....Does anyone remember an R&B Band in buffalo in the 60's that featured a black fella with no arms or legs that sang lead. I heard about this about 40 years ago and just heard the same story again last year. Can anyone tell me if this is fact or fiction. I didn't hang in Buffalo in the 60's but we were sure having a good time in eastern N.Y. at the time. Any info on the band would be much appreciated. Thanks and great site.sitting in Kauai these days, I am ecstatic to bump into your web after looking up one of the greatest of reggae bars \"Rude Boys Roots Rock Cafe\"-which I still dream of finding again. I was at Mr. Goodbar the week it opened, though the home base would have to be Casey's, across the street from the Mug. Anyone remember Michael the dj, and endless repeatitions of the Stones \"Midnight Rambler?\" Wed. 3 OVs (Old Vienna) for $1 at the CPG, and certainly the Seinfeld's Soup Man has nothing on the server at the Rendezvous. How many people did the man nearly frighten to death?-a couple of years later, while working for Harvey Weinstein (remember the Century Theatre?), I had the ultimate rock n roll experiance: taking The Clash (opening for The Who, Rich Stadium, 1982) to the Anchor Bar for wings, where Joe Strummer made the whole restaurant shut up and listen with respect to those wonderful older gents playing jazz there since forever...missing those 4 am greek diner breakfasts...you made my day! aloha from another world-Robin Shisler (then) P.S. what was the name of the barn (literally) 35 mi. S of Bflo that used to get all the greats of the blues-Muddy Waters, John Lee, Jr. M?...another unique gem.I was a member of a R&R band named FREEZE. We relocated from Syracuse in 1975 to Buffalo and lived and played there until 1978. A great time and memorable experience. Every Monday we played Patrick Henrys (Poor House later Stage One). We were also regulars on the stages of Mickey Rats, The Barrelhead, He and She's, McVanns, Bullwinkles, The Fat Cat, Mulligans on Hertel, BelleStarr, After Dark (Keystone 90's, Lockport), Uncle Sams, Century Theater and many more that I have forgotten. Those days meant a lot to my bandmates and myself. Every few years I go back. I drive the streets as if I never left feeling a little melancholy for days and nights gone by. To paraphrase a line from a classic film...we'll always have Buffalo.Maxl's was on the corner of Main and East Ferry; diagonally across the street from Sid's Pharmacy. There was a bar room in the front as you entered, and in the back a larger area with tables and a stage. This back area (and perhaps the front also) was decorated with wood carvings in the style of an old German village. I imagine that in the early days they had German music back there. I had never ventured into the place before about 1970 when I was playing bass with Spoon (Elmo Witherspoon Blues Band). I never wondered about the history of this place at the time, and one day it was gone.\n\nSomeone mentioned a place at Main and E. Utica, that was the Club Utica I think.\n\nA little north of Ferry there was a place near Freddies Donuts and I think it was called the Mansion House. Wilmer and the Dukes probably played there.Great site, memories galore. I was watching DDD and Fieri was at the Pizza Junction in Tonawanda. The menu also listed Beef on Weck, I thought of Bailo's, googled it and found this site. Must be lucky. Used to go to Bailo's in the early 70's, already married and my wife had family living there. I used to go 'over the ditch' from St.Catharines back in the sixties, cause you only had to be 18, and 15 seemed to be okay too. Surprised I'm still alive. Anyway, can't find the post now but someone mentioned WKBW and Dan Neaverth. Early on,they had a DJ named Dick Biondi, who left for Chicago and I understand now he's actually in the R&R hall of fame. Tom Shannon also co-wrote his show theme which was recorded as Wild Weekend and became a reasonable hit record. As a naive young teen, my buddy and I went to a place called the Billboard, mid to late sixties,a bar but more like an old converted theater. Outside advertised some of the best looking women I had ever seen. Took a stroll inside, watched a singer and found out the gorgeous woman sitting next to me was a female impersonator. They all were, had NOOOOOO idea. We left in a large hurry. Looking back, a lot of fun.Are you referring to the disco called Club 747. It was actually in the Executive Inn directly accross the street from the airport. On one side was the Playboy Club and the Disco was on the other side. The interior looked like you were in an airplane, seats... windows and all. I worked as a bartender when the Playboy Club opened and then went over as Asst Mgr of the Disco - Club 747. We were packed at both bars everynight. If I wasn't working, the gang from both clubs were bar hopping. From Sunset Beach to Hertel Ave, and Up and Down Delaware Ave we were there. I also worked at Stage One after Harvey and Corkey sold it-TALAS was the rage then, and Festival used to steer their acts to us after the concert. I could write a book at what I've seen at these and other places, but the bartender code of silence still reigns. Not really...it's just that no one would believe the stories even though they are all true!Early to mid 70's was a crazy time. Spent enough time & $$ in The Locker Room I could have owned the place... My niece said some of the same people were in the same bar stools 20 some years later. Met Moses in the Anchor Bar. Tripped thru Dirty Dick's a few times. Tuesday nights at the CPG on Main - $0.25 Rolling Rock splits and $0.25 shots of peppermint schnapps. I think there was also a place called The Park Meadow right across from the zoo. Best tequila sunrise in Bflo. Used to cut thru the zoo on the way home at night (before the kid had his arm ripped off by the bear).I turned 18 in 1974, raised in Williamsville, lived in Amherst, Cheektowaga, Buffalo and Tonawanda.Some of the bars are still here, many are a distant memory. This was an era before the strict DWI laws, drinking age of 21 and those chains(Applebee's) that ruin a city's identity. I use to go out having two sets of clothes, going to a club like 747 and then changing into jeans and flannel shirt in my car end up at the Pine Lodge. I went to all the places all of you have mentioned including After Dark in Lockport, Bogarts on Bailey,Peter K's, Ottos, and Caputis. The bars that have been mentioned were a great place to party or simply hang out, but as many of you have mentioned you no longer live in the area, and we do miss all of you. The loss of population and the graying of us that have remained have put many of those places out of business, but we all still have a great deal of memories of those great times of our youth.Buffalo's bar scene is still pretty wild. There are still a few legacy bar families truckin' along. The Shatzels, Brinkworths, and Alfieris, all still have multiple places. The ladies nights are a thing of the past, as laws have gotten a lil stiffer. The days of hotspots for every night of the week...The Mushroom on Monday, Coles and Goodbar on Tuesday, Locker Room on Thursday, No Names on Sunday, etc. etc. are also a thing of the past. Chippewa is dead! Allen is poppin! Amherst St. and Elmwood are making comebacks! 2nd generation legacies are spreading their wings. Kevin Brinkworth Jr. and Mike Shatzel are opening Blue Monk @ the old Merlins, and Gabby Alfieri & husband Pat Duquin just opened Duke's Bohemian (DBGB) on Allen Street steps away from the Old Pink and Mulligans Brick Bar. The Goldmans are opening BRKB on Amherst in Black Rock, which has the makings of a cool little strip. Buffalo's bar scene is evolving into something very cool once again. Everything is cyclicle. The trendy clubs are untrendy now and the goodtimes of great little neighborhood joints that showcased great nightlife and entertainment is on the way back! The early to late 60s...and 70s... was such a fun time. I was 16 when I saw Stan & the Ravens in the front window at The Hideaway on Delevan. I was young and under the influence but I believe Johnny Weitz was too young to play at Aliotas on Hertel so he played outside with a cord sneaking to his amp inside next to Tony, Gary, Jimmy & Tommy of The Rising Suns. Remember when ...damn, who was it who played in a circle in the middle of the room at Aliotas...not the stage on the north Hertel corner. I want to say it was Stan because I know there was a piano but no, it was Jimmy Calire at the piano. I remember they were saying goodbye him because he was going off to play with America. So many great nights of music at Aliotas.\n\nI poured drinks at The Inferno from the beginning almost to end. Where is Stevie Goldstein? The small room with Raven (see The Rising Suns above)... Thursdays, then Sundays with Wilmer and the Dukes, Fridays, Saturdays with all those bands. Thank you Kevin Elliot for all those bands...so many good bands.so many bars ....so many drinks ....so little time\n\nto me the mom and pop bars were the best..a long gone era\n\nmany of those mentioned on here i frequented ...used their men's room ....marked my territory...and moved on....most of them all gone ...vacant lots...i can't remember half of them\n\ni started drinking in the 50's..dubel's...chez ami ..sportsman ...most of our time in the midway..showing off my date of the evening..drinking 5 and 10 cent beers..herlan's ....benny's ....fordham..letterbox..mann's ...300 club..st.john kanties on saturday night...polka time with the best polish bands....after a football game there ...me being hit in the nose during the game ..broken ...2 black eyes ..the girls loved it...on and on ...thanks for the memories Brain cramp! As a teen, I often drove my '51 Ford coupe across the border to Buffalo to frequent a Niagara Street bar, where I fell in love with a neon beer display behind the bar, often staring at it for hours as those lovely iridescent colors circled around and bore into my brain. I see it still, a half-century later. But I digress. . . . what was the name of that freakin' bar not far from City Hall, but still very much in the working-class district. [I also occasionally (with guy and girl friends) would head to the Shalimar (spg??) on Genessee, and still have a photo taken by a bar photog hanging on my wall from about 1964. Niagara Street bar name, please. It's no longer there.Wow! So many bars that I had forgotten about because of all those hazey years! I lived in Buffalo until 1986 then I moved to Manhattan...love NYC,but nothing like growing up in Buffalo and getting served at 16 like many of you have! Did anyone mention Mean Guys on here? Or how about the \"Trivet House\" that dumpy place on the corner of Genesee & Transit which now houses some strip joint. Then further down Transit past Salvatores wasn't there a bar called \"The Lone Star\" What about the \"Salty Dog\" across from \"Melanies?\" \"After Dark\" in Lockport...then BEFORE \"Whiskey MIkes\" it was a German bar/restaurant called: \"Auf Wiedersehen\" what about the \"Honky Tonk\" down the street from \"Unger's Du Drop Inn\" and \"Louies Hot Dogs\" going towards Walden? Where the bikers hung out? And wasn't \"Binky Browns\" on Grant called \"The Inferno\" before it was \"Binky Browns?\" As you can tell I was born on the east side and then I lived on my own on the west side and went to all of them in between...even the Royal Pheasant! Went to almost all of the others mentioned on here. We thought it was cool getting served at 16 even though some were those \"old man\" bars going up and down Broadway. (Bailey area)\n\nJust to bring the good old days back just for a little while....I remember being a freshman in 1981 at Porter Hall in Buff State. Beers on campus were 3 splits for a dollar. The bars just off campus were Annies and Reagens which was located beyond that psych ward and my dorm. Going off Campus was Cassidy's and if we went to UB bars that would be 3rd base. Uncle Sams was in an old airplane hanger and was where I spent my months allowence...lol Foosball was the big thing, and Chicken wings were 3 years old. IT also snowed EVERY day. I went back home to Long Island after one semester... Oh and there was a large hole down main street which they said was going to be a subway but they lost funding at the time to either finish it or fill in the hole. It wasnt Buffalo's finest moment, but I did have some fun times... I remember the Mug well. $1 beer night on Mondays and the place was always packed. I beleived it was owned by the Alfiari Brothers. (name could be mispelled) Barbara St Clair & the Pin Cushions played there frequently. I used to set up for the band at The Mug and Uncle Sams on Walden. The Mug was located in a strip plaza on Hertel north of Elmwood just past the RR Viaduct on the left hand side. ( Aprroximatly the distance of 3-3 city blocks. Directly accross the street from the Mug was Nortel's.\n\nI grew up in the Kensington section of Buffalo and graduated from Kensington HS in 1969. Many great bars on Bailey also. Pat's Playtime,300 Club Wurtzburgerhof,Rabels,Galvins,Anacone's,The Letterbox, French Poodle,Ken Lounge,Midway,Sportmans,Ungers to name a few. You could always get served under 18 at most of these bars.In the early 1980's, I always remember arriving at Cassidy's, but never remember leaving. Pitcher's of vodka-tea's and the wheel did me in. Moved on to my all-time favorite bar in the mid-1980's: The Locker Room. Also often went to (in general order of likability):\n\nGabel's - A friend bounced there. Always knew someone in there.\n\nMulligan's Brick Bar - Cases of Bud splits on ice.\n\nMr. Goodbar - Easy drinking bar.\n\nMickey Rats - Saw many of the Bills in their glory years celebrating a win.\n\nThe Continental - Saw many weird things inside and outside.\n\nLong Branch Saloon (Elma) - No rules. Bar lights went out at 4:00am, but the drinking went on.\n\nCasey's Nickelodeon - A cool place\n\nSeptember's - Always knew someone in there also.\n\nUncle Sam's - 2 for 1's \"I'll have 30 vodka tea's\"\n\nIt is sad to see most of the old places are gone. We were reckless back then, but we sure had fun. These places mentioned are REAL bars....a \"Bar's Bar \" if you will....I remember late 70's and early 80's going to the Locker Room, corner of Delaware/Delevan I think. There was another place (name escapes me)on Main St. near Amherst HS that always seemed to have specials on pichers of Ice Picks (oooh watch out, you get drunk fast on those iced tea & vodka drinks)...And there was this very cool place in ealy 80's, this big old yellow house on Hertel and ? that was a reggae bar (before reggae got popular)called Rude Boys. Rick James was part owner I believe. Of course who can forget the criss-cross back/forth thing of Caseys & No Names. No Names played better music but Casey's had cuter bartenders! And remember The Continental? Downtown near the old Tralf, it was place to go for alt/new wave music. Saw 10,000 maniacs there once. So many others...\n\nThe only wrong thing with this site is when it ended. Wow, great site and memories. Sure glad you're memories are still entact.S. Bflo girl but base home was the Tudor, stepping over to Mclaughlins. Then you mention Caseys which I frequented now that you jogged my memory but don't know how I got there. Remember Tudors when Bo Diddley stopped in. Other places stopping in Library, Dubels, Do Drop and the Inferno. Not much in my area except tending bar for\"Tom Mucchie\" with various names as 'Paltonys?'- Tom & Jerry's on S. Park. Oh, Bailos where you never went hungry. Just had old menu out from the Bocci Club from the 60's. Thank you so much for this site. It's marked! Made my night.I used to live in Buffalo in the 70's. I went to many of the bars on this Website. I no longer drink, I have been sober for 22 years now, but I have many memories of some of the people on this Website. I have often wondered what happened to them. I was know as Harvey back then and went to Casey's a lot. I wish you all well.Does anyone have a picture of Cassidy's? I had some great times there in the late 70's and early 80's. I remember the \"Wheel\" and the chant of \"Freddy's Special\", hoping that wheel would hit on the special so everyone got a shot of some disgustingly sweet concoction. The back room may have had a pool table, or was it foozball? We went for the girls, mostly. It was total craziness. I loved it. We all bought football jerseys emblazoned \"Wooton College\" and told the girls there that we were Rugby players. Who knew where Wooton College was anyway? A great starter line made possible by a purchase from Champion Outlet store in North Tonawanda. Wonder if that's still there?The memories keep pouring in. I attended Buffalo State from 1966 to 1970 and one of my favorite hangouts was The Ivanhoe. I became friends with Chic and the Diplomats; I met my future wife there (who for a while bar tended there) and danced all night long to some very good music. Laughlin's was another great spot; I acutally got a summer job right across the street from there, so it was a daily stop for a beer after work. Living around Buffalo State was everyone's objective. Our apartment was at 601 Elmwood Ave. at Forest, in a one room apartment. This apartment complex is still standing and looks much like it did in the '60's.Quite the site. During the mid 70's used to head 'over the river' from Welland regularly to party it up in Buffalo. Mulligan's was a common destination. And the cutest, curly headed blonde regular that I've ever 'almost' got to know.\n\nWhat was the name of the bar next to Mulligan's? Used to head into there just for a change of pace, with a 50:50 chance that it would end in a scrap.\n\nThirty years now in the Canadian west, but I still think fondly of those times.\n\nYou folks are right. No place then like Buffalo. Our trips to NYC paled.Thought about it for a few days and I remeber the Old Tralf then the new Tralf where I saw Albert Collins tear the place up! Room Full of Blues anson and the Rockets with Sam Meyers, The Fabulous Thunderbirds, I remember seeing Stevie Ray Vaughn when he was first starting out in Ellicotsville. Downchild Blues Band, When I was dating Joe Skinner he played at the Governors Inn with James Peterson. I saw Muddy Waters at the Imperial Garage with Charlie Musslewhite, Guitar Junior, Shakin Smith Blues Band Stevie B and the Rhythm Rockers, Kingsnake and Excelllos. There was never a times when you had to look for live music it was everywhere. Buffalo was a great city to grow up in. Great People!Was into the music, miss Buffalo, Peanut House on Grant, great bands at Layfayette Tap room, Marshalls, Brown Baron, I am a blues girl, Imperial Garage in NIagara Falls,I remember J.P.Bullfeathers when it had wooden floors and it was just a bar, along with No Names,I went to Aliota,s with one of my biker boyfriends back in the day always alot of fights. Saw some great acts at the Rooftops on Seneca Street, also McGullicuttys on Baily. There was a very small club on bailey forget the name, it was a lovers den you could not see in the place and it was all candles on the tabes I think it was called JB.s Miss the old days in Buffalo! I was a hostess at the Cloister when I was in my twenties, had a blast great music and great people.Oh the memories keep flooding in after reading these comments and seeing the photos. I am sorry to say I do not have a photo of Caseys on Hertel or Elmwood to add to the collection here but kudos to the website.\n\nMy friend Philip Butera sent me this and it is a gift to those of us who spent many nights of our youth in these establishments. Caseys of course was my favorite and I miss Butch, Paps, and Dorothy. I get great joy from remembering the great times and music. On a recent trip to Western NY to visit my Dad (he is 97) and my sister, who recently cleaned out our parents home, we were discussing the past. I was telling my sister about a resturant we went to as children that had great fish frys and hot roast beef sandwiches with gravy. Both of these dishes are hard to find in Houston TX. Later that day as we sorted through photos and other boxed items, we found a menu for Gillitzers. The resturant was at 757 Broadway at Stanton. I do not know how old the menu is, but the most expensive dinners, T-Bone are .75.\n\nOne of the places I went to when I was 18 was the Anchor Bar, in fact we can buy Anchor Bar hot wing sauce here in Houston, it is still the best.\n\nTalk about being home sick, I had at least one drink in 11 of those bars pictured, maybe more it was the 70's. I was one of those 16 year olds sneaking into the In between (Ivanhoe at one time) on Thurday nights and Casey's on Friday, Saturday and Sunday nights (best bar on a Sunday night)Also hit palces like Gabels, Mulligans on Hertal, Merlins, No Name,anyone remember the Parrot on Hertel? Tried to sneak into Ma Barkers in Kenenore but got caught....WOW talk about old memories I havn't even heard the names of the streets in yrs I have lived in ATl Ga for 30 yrs now. I was sitting here thinking about the old days & looking at my glass that I still have a Uncle Sam's FIRECRACKER. Thought that would make ya'll laugh ya I still have the glass. Buffalo is still the best place I have ever lived, use ta live in Williamsville. Man wish I had a Beef On Weck A Genny Cream Ale (worst beer ever) and was watching Jim Braxton (BILLS)or Don Luce(SABERS).I left Buffalo in the early 80's, but still have very fond memories of going to The Underground, Stuffed Mushroom, buying cases of splits at the New Federal Pub where they cut the top off a case of OV splits, open all 24 beers and cover with ice and hand it over the bar to you for $8, skipping school and having Labatt's at Checker's, Gimlets at the PM (Park Meadow) and having lunch (20 oz genesse and a bowl of chilli)at a bar across the street fro the Trico plant, I believe it was called Slambas. What great memories, I can't wait to get back!!I too was in the bars at 15 and 16. First was the Inn-Between on Forest Ave to see the band Future History on several occasions. Glasses of slammers... Then was the Recovery Room where I had a tab as an underage senior in high school - yikes. Vodka and Iced Tea - yummm. Lots of fun - and no one parties like Buffalonians - great memories. Glad I stumbled on this site. Hertel does not look like it used to. Couldn't believe no Mighty Taco on Hertel anymore, last time I was in town...I grew up off of Forest Avenue and started getting into Brinkworth's on the corner of Forest and Baynes when I was 16. No ID checks or police visits...I believe one of the owners was a Buffalo police detective. I also remember the Allentown bar just to the right of Mulligan's Brick Bar...I spent plenty of hours at the foosball table there playing for beers. After that it was a short walk down the block to the Towne restaurant for breakfast at 4:00 am BUFFALO WAS, AND STILL IS THE BEST PLACE I'VE EVER BEEN IN FOR BARS, MUSIC, AND MOST OF ALL; FRIENDLY PEOPLE.ALL THESE BARS THAT EVERYONE HAS MENTIONED BRING BACK SO MANY MEMORIES OF \"GOOD TIMES\". I LEFT BUFFALO IN 1981 FOR SUNNY ARIZONA, BUT JUST RECENTLY RETURNED FOR MY 40TH HIGH SCHOOL REUNION. IT'S A SHAME THAT MANY OF THE \"SPOTS\" ARE GONE, BUT I DID FIND THAT THERE ARE STILL ALL THOSE GOOD BUFFALO PEOPLE AND NO MATTER WHAT BAR YOU'RE IN,IT STILL FEELS LIKE THOSE DAYS OF THE 60'S AND 70'S.\n\nI GREW UP IN SOUTH BUFFALO, AND YOU COULDN'T WALK ONE BLOCK WITHOUT PASSING AT LEAST 2 OR 3 \"GIN MILLS\". MANY A FRIDAY NIGHT WAS SPENT TRYING TO DRINK YOUR WAY DOWN SENECA ST.\n\nALL THE BARS ON ELMWOOD WERE GREAT TO GO TO ALSO. GOOD MUSIC,PRETTY WOMEN(THE PRETTIEST), GOOD PEOPLE AND FUN !\n\nGREAT PICTURES OF ALL THE PLACES IN BUFFALO...BRINGS BACK MANY MEMORIES !Dianne Podleiszek/Cohen I grew up in Buffalo in the 50/60's with my family and I left Buffalo in 1971 I attended Lafayette High school. I wonder if you could find some pics of the schools of Buffalo. I recall the beautiful buildings of Klinehans music hall, Buffalo State, etc. My family spent most Saturday afternoons at The ellenterry(sp) theatre on the west side, those were the days you could walk freely up and down Grant Street to window shop. Anyone remember Nablo's, Kresge's 5 and dime store or woolworth's, the nu-way market, A&P grocery store, Liberty shoe store? Just to mention some of my family's memories. Thanks for the memories I really enjoyed them all. Too bad for the condition she is in now.In the early to mid-seventies, there were two bad-butt bars in the area of Main Street and Transit Road: The Yellow Monkey, which had previously been a \"Polynesian\" restaurant and which was lovingly called the \"Mellow Junkie,\" and Casey's in Clarence. After Casey's closed at 3:00 AM, we would head a few miles down Main Street toward Transit to Donut Heaven. At about 3:30 the donut maven, Vicki, would bring the donuts fresh out of the deep fryer. They were still hot, and when you bit into them, they went \"pooof.\" Never had a better cup of coffee either. That's the way my drug-riddled mind remembers it anyway. Also, I remember the record co-op in the basement of the UB Student Union, where you ordered vinyl, and paid $2.80 for a brand new, virgin album like Sticky Fingers.Boy, I happened upon this site trying to find out where the Red Pepper Tavern used to be located and can't believe all the awsome memories I have of most of these bars. I cut my teeth in a lot of them. Does anyone remember Melanies in Amherst, Patrick Henry's in Clarence, Mickey rats, Broadway Joes, the Brass Palm tree, The Elmwood lounge, Cheers, The End Zone on Grote St. If anyone knows where the Red Pepper Tavern used to be, please let me know. This is an awsome site.It was sometime in the winter of 68 that I first went to Buffalo. I was on a fraternity pledge quest with 4 other pledges from SUNY Plattsburgh. We had to get some ridiculous items from UB as proof that we were actually there and turn around and go right back. Some locals told us that the best place in town was the Inferno so we decided to give it a try before heading out. It was great, we had nothing like that up at Plattsburgh. It was packed and loud and the beers were cheap and cold. Not sure where we stayed for what turned into a three day long party, but I am sure I had a good time. That was 3 nights in a row at the inferno, couldn't handle anymore, but a great memory. Would love to see a picture of it. Dano\n\nWhat a great discovery - so many memories of late '70's & early '80's. Get a carload of UB guys, drive down to Birdie's 19th hole for all the draft beer you could drink 9-12 for $2 & see how many redlights you could run on Main St coming home. Gabel's (California Coolers and Foosball)and Cassidy's and the CPG were the \"homes\". 'Lude behavior on Allen St at the Brick Bar and at CPG's. Watching the crowd chant \"Crucify him\" as JC got up in costume at the Brick Bar on Halloween. Elmwood Ave - sharing cocktails with Lindy Ruff - when he was a player. Going to the Buff State bars on Grant St. All this when all the boomers were \"Lookin' for Mr. Goodbar\" - before AIDS - when EVERYONE went out and all the bars were 4-5 deep on a Fri or Sat nite. I now live in the NYC area, and I have seen some wild stuff, but there was nothing like the combination of people, buzz and lust in the air. God do I miss it....How about \"The Andante\" on Hertle where \"The Vibratos\" played ...along with The Town Casino and The \"Glen Casino\" ?? How about \"The Ivanhoe\" on Forest?\n\nGood groups: The Vibratos (with Gary Mallaber the great drummer who also played with The Raven and later with Van Morrison and the Steve Miller band) and Jack Terranova and Chic from \"Chic and the Diplomats?\"\n\nOh yeah and 'Johnny's old time salon\" where there was video and sing along throwing PEANUTS ON THE FLOOR. i HAVE MOVED FROM BUFFALO.. BUT I WILL ALWAYS REMEMBER ALL THE GREAT FUN TIMES I HAD IN THE MID TO LATE SIXTIES! I moved to Buffalo in 1979 to attend Canisius. Never missed a weekend at the PM. I think it was 50cent Labatts on Thursday night. Brian P. the bouncer saved my butt many times. Thank you. Also loved 60 cent Bionics at Slombas. The Locker Room, Cassidy's, Stuffed Mushroom, 3rd Base, CPG, Mean Guys East (went to see The Road there every Sunday), The Stumble Inn (pitchers of Alabama Slammers yikes!) and all of the Elmwood bars. I know this is for Buffalo bars, but I loved going to see bands like Elliot, Flashpoint, Lebel, Only Humen, and Broken Silence at places like the After Dark, DJ's Stillery, and the Macaroni Company (first time I saw the Goo Goo Dolls OPEN for Lance Diamond). Thanks for the walk down memory lane!Hey all, hope you are all having a great summer! How about listening to the Weekend Trip (ak/a Weekend) at the Factory on Hertel???? Used to take the bus to the East Side and go to The Funnel to hear the Road! Good times! Does anybody know what happened to The Road? I used to have their album, but I would LOVE to listen to it again if anyone knows where I could buy a copy!!!!!Let's see if I can remember them all... I know I won't - but this is my list from growing up as a tall kid on the East Side thru - well - I'll end with the classic days of the 90's (oh - and for bartenders and tenderettes - and musicians - I may know you - have partied with you - or dated you - so if you think that's a possibility - get in touch again!)\n\nAlden Hotel - Belle Starr - Purple Moose - Stage One - Yellow Jaguar - Club 747 - Mickey Rats - Captain Kidds - Brick Bar - Mulligans - Mothers - Shadracks - Uncle Sams - Emils & Emils II - Jacobis - The Basement - Locker Room - The PM - Tugboat Annies - Sunset Bay Bearch Club - Barrel House - Ounce and an Half - GDI's - The Anchor Inn - Pee Wee's Brown Derby - The Schuper House - Newmans - No Names - Gandalfs - Cathode Ray - Laurel and Hardy's - The Black Star - Chin's Islander Lounge - Bagatelle/Molly's Pub - Third Base - Elbow Room - The Pentacle - The Mushroom - 2001 - Bobby McGee's - The BBC and The Library - Anancones - Joey's Beltline - The Jolly Roger - The Shebeen - IV Stallions - Placeys - Caseys - The Stuffed Mushroom - Jack's Place - The Warsaw Inn - Cassidys - The Underground - The original Continental - Merlins - JP Bullfeathers - Adam's - Cheers - Do Drop Inn - Red Brick Inn - J&R's Lounge - Kiebsczaks - PJ Bottoms - Welington Pub - Malamute - Crawdaddys - RC Anna's - Hannah's - Slomba's...\n\nchrist - now I'd have to go back to photo albums and napkins to get even more...\n\n:)\n\nthere's more - I just need nother beer and I don't feel like digging thru the stamps and coasters and plactics glasses and pics...\n\nsuffice it to say - nowhere like Buffalo for a bar scene.\n\npeace all\n\n.g.I went to Bennett from 1957 to 1961 and frequented most of the mentioned bars that were open then, particularly in the Hertel Ave area. I can't remember the name of the little bar across from Bennett, but the owner used to live upstairs and when he got tired he would leave us the key to close up. We would drink Schmidt's beer on the honor system and put the key through the mail slot when we left. Anyone remember Hermy the Spermy at Lulubelle's? What a great site devoted to great memories!I second the Bona Vista - though I'm pretty sure it was the Buena Vista - on Hertle as a great classic bluse bar. In 73 I was a student at SUNY but had my best times and best education blowing harp with Spoon and the Houserockers at the BV. Spoon was a steelworker by day and a bluesman at night. Great musicians came through that band including Jay Beckenstein who went on to form Spyro Gyra. Any other vets of the BV out there? Still blowing harp out here in SF (see fogtone.com if curious) thanks for the siteI coldn't remember all of the stories. My church was next to brunners. Cassidys best bar. Freddys special, the beach party where they would spread sand all over the floor, beach attire, leave your shoes at the door and alot of sunglasses and squirtguns! The breakdancer with the \"now doo rag\" who didn't speak much, just danced. Getting girls to dress behind the sheet for a $50 bar tab, only to get naked and have the sheet dropped. The originators of the belly shot, the tit shot, and the bartenders standing on the bar puoring Alabama Slammers! I could go on but I'll bring up some more at a later time! Thanks for the friends and the memories!then there was the spectrum at amherst and elmwood across elmwood from the bowling alley. then there was club 747 connected to the executive across from the airport, with junction west, then the scintas held the stage there before they became regulars at las vegas. i remember i couldn't afford the drinks at 747 when i was in high school so i got a vodka & lime with \"two straws\" for me and my date. i made the bartender laugh, how embarrassing. but those were great times.Great site: I went to UB and remember great late nights at the Beef & Ale House on Main Street and the Library on Bailey. Moved to the West Side after graduating and spent memorable and forgotten hours at Mickey's on Allen (owned by Jack Heisler who also owned the Beef & Ale up near UB), the Brick Bar, sometimes for fun down to the Aragon (never got into any fights) at the end of Allen or up at the other end of Allen on Main, Lux's Lounge and the Villa Capri which can best be described as uniquely local and most eclectic! I bartended at the Continental on Franklin just south of Chippewa...which is very bland these days but the last time I was back in Buffalo, the Lakeview Inn was still holding forth, on and out on Chippewa. A flyer on the wall noted, \"City of Buffalo Employees Drink 1/2 price every weekday.\" What a joint! What a city! Thanks for site and the memories!The Inferno was without a doubt, the best place to be from 1965 until it burned down in 1968. Iroquois draft in a 16 ouch cup was only 35 cents and a 7&7 was only .70 cents. The most expensive drinks were the Zombie and the Singapore Sling which was $1.50 for a 16 ounce drink. (Remember the minimum wage back then is $1.25 an hour).\n\nOther great spots were the C Lounge on Dewey Avenue and the Hideaway on E. Delevan. The Twigs use to play at the C Lounge and the Rising Sons at the Hideaway. How about Stan & the Raven playing at the Colony on Hertel before it turned into a topless bar?\n\nLate in 1968 Gilligan's on Walden Avenue opened up. The old owners of the Inferno made a go of it until 1971. Such groups as Alice Cooper, Joe Cocker, Blue Cheer, the Amboy Dukes featuring Ted Nugent, Deep Purple, the original Fleetwood Mac featuring Peter Greene, Chicago Transit Authority (later renamed Chicago), Spirit, Steppenwolf, MC5, Brownsville Station, Paul Butterfield Blues Band, Ricky Nelson, and Deep Purple all played there. The house bands were the Magic Ring (formerly the Twigs)and the Charles featuring John Valby (of Dr. Dirty fame). A 16 ounce draft was 60 cents back then.I did a search on Google for \"Tommy's Schuper House\" because I have a large glass with that name on it. It also say's \"1802 Niagra St., Buffalo. N.Y..\n\nIt's got a paint ring around the text but I'm not asking anything for the glass. It's not a mug as much as a huge goblet type glass.\n\nIf someone wants it, let me know, you can have it. Email mark_a_wilber@dresser-rand.com and let me know if you want it. You pay postage------> It's yours. Waste not, want not type thing.Hey Charlene, I bartended at the Brick Bar from 1976-1980. I was hired by Pat Ford. They used to call me \"Tone the Bone.\" Anyway, I'm still best friends with Pat and he has been working at Smith & Wollinsky's in NYC for the last 20yrs. or so. It was nice to hear all the people who appreciated and miss what we all used to do at the nut house. I miss it and think about it alot myself. Take care.How about Casey's on Hertel, Dirty Dick's Bathhouse, No Name Bar, Casey's Nickelodeon on Elmwood, Shane's Tavern, Beef 'n Ale House on Grant St and Main St.,McVann's, Colony Lounge, Parkside Grill, The One Eye'd Cat on Bryant St., Pat's on Bailey Ave., Slatt's on Bailey Ave, the 300 Club, the Library, Bailos, Maxl's Brau Stube, John Barleycorn's on Bailey Ave.,Fibber McGee's on Seneca Street, Sunday's on Elmwood Ave, the Locker Room. The best bar ever was the Inferno in Williamsville that had Wilmer & the Dukes every Wednesday evening and national acts on the weekend such as Paul Butterfield, Wilson Pickett, Arthur Conley, the Esquires, Bob Seger System, Sly & the Family Stone, the Soul Survivors, Ike & Tina Turner just to name a few!. I should know, I tended bar there from 1966 until it burned down in 1968. Top drinks back then were Zombies, Singapore Slings, Iroquios Draft, 7/7's and Schmidt's Beer in the bottle.OH MY GOODNESS!! I've been away from Buffalo since 1976 (my family is still there, and I visit but don't cruise the bars anymore) but those bars were the best!! Sneaking in at 16 and no one seeming to care! I'd love to know what has become of those bartenders from the Brick Bar..Pat especially! They were soooo much fun!!!!\n\nThis site..every picture..is wonderful! Thanks for the vacation without having to leave home!!!The nightlife was great in Buffalo, especially when I got back from the Marines in '66. Everyone in the Westside was swing dancing. Bars like the \"Ivanhoe\" or \"Flays.\"\n\nHow about \"Jacobi's\" in South Park? The women in Buffalo were some of the best swing dancers I've ever danced with. They were world class and I think they knew it. The guys were cool too. All true perfomers and the local dance floor at the neighborhood bar was our stage.\n\nThe bands that played were largely blues type in the late sixties. I developed my appreciation of blues music at that time."
