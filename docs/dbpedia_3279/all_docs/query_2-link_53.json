        "text": "Norma J. Spadafore, of Stockbridge, MI, age 72, passed away on April 27, 2024 at her home surrounded by her loving family.\n\nNorma (affectionately known as Normi) was born on June 2, 1951, in Jackson, MI, the daughter of Norman and Marjorie (McIntee) Mitchell. She grew up in Leslie, MI, graduating from Leslie High School in 1969. She married the love of her life, Frank R. Spadafore, on July 24, 1971 in Bunker Hill Twp., and they enjoyed 52 years of marriage. They lived in Pinckney, MI for many years, where they raised their family and owned and operated the local grocery store before eventually settling in Stockbridge, MI.\n\nNormi was a loving wife, mother, grandmother, sister and friend. Family came first, and she was always happy to host Sunday dinners and organize family vacations, nurturing the close relationships she knew to be so important. She adored her grandchildren and supported their passions by cheering enthusiastically at sporting events, dance recitals, and plays.\n\nNormi truly loved life and embraced it with open arms, never missing an opportunity to make memories. She rarely turned down a road trip, a concert, a round of golf or a game of cards. She loved music and took to the dance floor whenever the opportunity presented itself, even if the dance floor was on the golf course. Her outgoing and fun loving personality allowed her to make friends wherever she went, but she truly cherished her lifelong friendships, many spanning decades. She was always grateful for time spent with her treasured best friends and sisters, and had countless stories of their adventures. She was an avid reader, a great cook, a talented gardener, and she didn’t shy away from a healthy debate. Most recently, Normi was a fighter and faced each new challenge with patience, determination, love and humor, inspiring those around her to treasure each day.\n\nNormi is survived by her four children, Michael Spadafore of Ann Arbor, Tony (Kelly) Spadafore of Chelsea, Joe (Melissa) Spadafore of East Lansing, and Nick (Melissa) Spadafore of East Lansing; nine adoring grandchildren: Ryan, Mya, Hunter, Phoebe, Aidan, Loela, Stella, Georgia, and Sienna; her siblings, Mary Ellen (Dale) Tithof of Chesaning, JoAnne (Rae) Edmondson of San Diego, CA, James (Nancy) Mitchell of Leslie, Janet (James) Muir of Farmington, Patrick Mitchell of Leslie, and Michael Mitchell of Leslie; her sisters-in-law, Shirley Mitchell of Lake Orion, and Connie Spadafore of Stockbridge. She was preceded in death by her husband, Frank, in February 2024, her parents, and a brother, Thomas Mitchell.\n\nVisitation will be held at the Staffan-Mitchell Funeral Home, Chelsea on Thursday, May 16, 2024 from 2-4 and 6-8 p.m.\n\nA Celebration Life will be held at the Brookshire Inn and Golf Club, 205 W. Church Street in Williamston, MI on Friday, May 17, 2024 beginning at 6:30 p.m.\n\nMemorial contributions may be made to SAESA (Stockbridge Area Emergency Services Authority), or the Glioblastoma Foundation.\n\nArrangements by Staffan-Mitchell Funeral Home, Chelsea."
