        "text": "1815 - Harriet Patience Dame was born in Barnstead, New Hampshire (or North Barnstead) to James Chadbourne and Phebe Ayers on January 5, 1815.\n\nIn 1843, Dame moved to Concord, New Hampshire and worked at various occupations. By 1861, she was running a student boarding house. She had no formal training as a nurse prior to the war. When war came, Harriet, aged 46, approached the recruit training station at Camp Union in Concord and offered her services to officers. As a result of no infirmary at the camp, Harriet was put into service as a nurse. She served with the 2nd New Hampshire Volunteer Infantry from April, 1861 to December, 1865.\n\nShe served the entire time without a furlough. This was through two enlistment periods of the regiment. This regiment was mostly men from Concord and Exeter, led by Col. Gilman Marston. Miss Dame marched and camped alongside the troops. Most of the time, she was often the only woman among the regiment of one thousand men. Col. Marston said of her: “Miss Dame was the bravest woman I ever knew. I have seen her face a cannon battery without flinching while a man took refuge behind her for safety from flying shells. She was always present when most needed.” She saw action at first Bull Run, second Bull Run, Fredericksburg, and Gettysburg. Concord, in 1861, was the site of political rallies.\n\nIt may have been those gatherings that fired Harriet up and made her want to do her patriotic duty with the boys in the Civil War. Whatever the reason, it is written in The Barnstead Reunion, “That at once aroused her patriotism and she anxiously desired to aid the Union cause. Not being permitted to carry a musket, she decided to become an army nurse and joined Second Regiment NH volunteers, as hospital matron.” The pay of a hospital matron at that time was six dollars a month, ($240.00 in today’s dollars). But Harriet probably was less concerned with her salary than she was helping the soldiers who were fighting in the war. If Harriet wanted to get close to battle, her wish was granted in April of 1862, when she was helping inside the trenches to treat the wounded at Fair Oaks, Virginia during the Peninsula Campaign. “She was inside the trenches at Fair Oaks while the rebels were bombarding them and a shell tore through the tent just as she left it, and another burst overhead while she was cooking some broth.\n\nIn the ambulance and hospital she was a ministering angel and saved the lives of many men by careful nursing. After that battle, the troops having retreated, she walked a long distance and assisted the sick and wounded on the march. One very dark night she passed in the thick of the woods, not knowing whether she was near friends or foes. Miss Dame said: “I remember an incident of one morning on the Chickahominy. The men came to me and wanted me to make them some tea, which I did. It seemed to refresh them greatly. I walked away from the fire and saw a man sitting on a stump at the edge of the woods. His face was in his hands, he acted greatly fatigued. I asked if he were ill. He said, ‘No,’ but he had been in the saddle for a whole day. As he looked up, I saw that he was a major-general, and offered him some tea, which he gladly accepted. I did not know the man, but years afterward, in looking at some pictures, I came across that of General Kearney, and he was the man on the stump.’ Due to her courage and compassion, Harriet was well known among all the soldiers and deep respect was always shown no matter where she went and nursed the men.\n\nWhen Union General Joseph Hooker announced that all soldiers who could not walk to Harrison’s Landing, Virginia during the Peninsula Campaign would be left behind to certain death, Miss Dame first organized the sick and wounded so they could help each other during the 120-mile trek and later won space for them on wagons. Her leadership and ability to organize saved the lives of many. Indeed, Harriet traveled extensively and saw the worst of the worst: she was with the 2nd NH regiment at Harrison’s Landing and treated the sick and wounded among them. Soon after, she was put on a hospital boat and sent to Fortress Monroe to aid the wounded that had been evacuated.\n\nFrom there she was ordered to accompany a shipload of sick and wounded soldiers to New York for treatment in a General Hospital. Not long after, Harriet was back on the battlefield nursing the wounded. She was at the Second Bull Run battle. After the fight, she was captured while in route to accompany soldiers to a hospital at the Stone Church. Her captors thought that she might be a spy. She was taken to none other than Stonewall Jackson himself. A written account of the meeting stated that, “The grand old warrior sat alone. He glanced at [Ms. Dame], and when she showed her bandages for the wounded, her flask and her medicines. General Jackson thundered: ‘Take that lady back to the Northern lines! He detailed a guard of eight picked men to guide this nurse safely back to Northern lines.’” In December ,1862, she was a nurse at the battle of Fredericksburg and suffered from exposure, but remained with the sick soldiers until they were deemed able to be removed to Washington D.C. Harriet once again packed her traveling bag and accompanied the wounded.\n\nHarriet next appeared as a nurse at the Battle of Gettysburg and what she must have seen cannot be imagined. A chaplain described the nobility of Miss. Dame: “I have heard them all tell how she toiled day after day on the bloody field of Gettysburg, sometimes during the battle, between the lines…absorbed and self-forgetful, devoting herself to the relief of our wounded men. And when the darkness of night, and the exhaustion of her energies made rest imperative, she would pillow her head on the gory field, and sleep amid the dead and wounded scattered around her.” During the years Harriet served as a nurse, she followed the New Hampshire regiment through one battle after another.\n\nShe became an almost legendary figure among all the soldiers that she served. In September, 1864, she was appointed Matron of the 18th Corps Hospital and supervised the nurses and also the cooking for the hospital’s sick and wounded, which at times amounted to over 3,000 men. The corps was sent first to the Bermuda Hundred, and later to the north bank of the James River. Its first division took part in the successful attack on Fort Harrison on August 29 during the Battle of Chaffin’s Farm. The corps was also engaged on October 27 in the Second Battle of Fair Oaks, fought over the same ground as the first battle in May, 1862. The corps was discontinued in December, 1864. On Christmas day, Dec. 25, 1865, the regiment of New Hampshire soldiers was mustered out of service and Harriet’s service to the Civil War ended when the men were sent home. General Gilman Marston, colonel of the regiment, said of Harriet, “Miss Harriet P. Dame went out with the Second NH Volunteers in June, 1861, and remained with that regiment and in the army hospitals until the close of the war. She sought no soft place and wherever her regiment went she went, often marching on foot and camping without tent on the field. She was always present where most needed, and to the suffering, whether ‘Yank or Reb’ it made no difference. She was truly an angel of mercy. Miss Dame was the bravest woman I ever knew. I have seen her face a battery without flinching, while a man took refuge behind her to avoid the flying fragments of bursting shells.\n\nOf all the men and women who volunteered to serve their country during the late war, no one is more deserving of reward than Harriet P. Dame.” After the war, Dame was appointed in 1867 by William E. Chandler to a Treasury Department clerkship in Washington, D.C. which she held into old age (she was still working at 81). She did not return to her home state until 1900 after Congress voted her a military pension in 1884. In 1886 she deposited $1,000 with a committee of the 2nd regiment veterans to erect a building for headquarters for their encampment at Lake Winnipesaukee. She was the second president of the Ex-Army Nurses’ Association, and she donated personal funds to build the NH Old Soldiers Home in Tilton. Dame served as the third president of the National Association of Army Nurses of the Civil War, in 1884 upon the death of Dorthea Dix and resignation of Dr. Susan Edson. Because of her service, a Senate bill was introduced in the 48th Congress to provide pensions to nurses who worked on the battlefield or in hospitals during the Civil War.\n\nPatience Dame never married. She died in Concord and was buried at Blossom Hill Cemetery on April 24, 1900 in Concord. Governor Frank Rollins and long lines of state militia participated in her funeral ceremony. A brief obituary in the New York Times on April 25, 1900 stated: “Harriet P. Dame, war nurse from New Hampshire, known by name to thousands of Union and Confederate soldiers, died tonight. She had the right to wear the insignia of the One Hundred and Eighty-eighth Corps, and the Third Corps of Hookers Division.” “She sought no soft place, but wherever her regiment went, she went, often marching on foot and camping without tent on the field. She was always present when most needed, and to the suffering, whether Yank or Reb -it made no difference- she was truly an angel of mercy. Miss Dame was the bravest woman I ever knew. I have seen her face a battery without flinching, while a man took refuge behind her to avoid the flying fragments of bursting shells.” – General Gilman Marston commander of the 2nd NH Regiment. “I can speak of personal knowledge, for I have seen her under fire on many a hard fought field, and when lying on my back shot through the body, unable to move a finger, with, as everybody thought, my last breath going out, and with shot and shell raining around us, as if the very heavens were about to fall, she at that time was indeed to me a ministering angel, and I candidly believe if it were not for her I could not have written this letter to-day.” – M.A. Dillon 2nd NH Regiment wounded at Second Bull Run. In 1901, the State Legislature appropriated funds so that a State House portrait might be painted of Harriet. Her portrait was the first portrait of a woman to be hung in the State House.\n\nThe City of Concord also named a school in her honor. With the soldiers she was entitled to wear the cross of the Eighteenth Corps, which she accompanied; the diamond of the Third Corps of Hooker’s Division; the heart of the Twelfth Corps and a gold badge given by the Second New Hampshire. The American Nurses Association put her in their Hall of Fame in 2002. She is their only Civil War Matron that they have honored for her nursing.\n\n1829 - Born: Albert Laighton in Portsmouth New Hampshire Albert Laighton was a 19th century American poet who lived all of his life in the New Hampshire town of Portsmouth.\n\nHe was a banker by profession and began writing articles and poetry for various periodicals from the age of 15 onwards. Many of his poems are of a light hearted nature, exploring the changing of the seasons and our attitudes to that inexorable passage of time, or vivid descriptions of the natural world. He liked to describe the glories to be found in woodlands and the joy of seeing the birds that herald the birth of a new Spring. Others though were of a more sombre nature, as discussed below.\n\nLaighton was born on the 8th January 1829 in Portsmouth. Very little is recorded about his life but it seems he grew up in a fairly affluent environment. He was educated at private schools in his home town and then moved into the banking profession (presumably) soon afterwards. His output of poetry ran to two volumes of collected poems, the first being published in 1859 and the second in 1878. In conjunction with another local poet he had a compilation published in 1865 called Poets of Portsmouth. While many of Laighton’s poems are fairly short, and usually in a standard rhyming format, he wrote one very long poem called Beauty.\n\nDuring the year 1858 he was invited by the literary society at Bowdoin College, along with other organisations, to read the poem in full. Here is a short extract from it:\n\nIn contrast to poems such as this were his examinations of death and society’s attitudes to this natural progression of life. Take, for example, his poem Found Dead which describes an event as commonplace when it was written in the 19th century as it is now. It’s about the vagrants, the rough sleepers, the exiles from normal family life – they have always been there and probably always will be. Here is the opening verse of this mournful poem:\n\nThen there was his poem The Dead which is an examination of death itself, offering his view of whether or not an afterlife exists and, if it does, what it might look like. Here is the poem in full:\n\nLaighton challenges the different beliefs that people have while stating the obvious fact that he cannot know if there is such a thing as a guardian angel who watches over us until it is our turn to die.\n\nWhere he says that “they speak to us, or press our hand, and strive to make us understand” it could be argued that he had “new age” philosophies perhaps well before the term was invented. The last verse, where he suggests that the golden gates are left ajar, certainly implies that he believes that there is a pathway to heaven that has been well trodden already.\n\nWith “immortal glory” streaming through the gates this is a clear invitation for those about to pass on and, perhaps, reassurance that being dead isn’t such a terrible thing to contemplate. The fact is, of course, that no one knows what happens after death but Laighton certainly offered an optimistic prospect with his poetry. Albert Laighton died in Portsmouth on the 6th February 1887, aged 58.\n\nJames Sheppard was born on February 25th, 1817.\n\nAfter his father’s death, he was raised by his guardians and family friends, the future President Franklin Pierce and Senator Atherton. At the young age of 14, he was appointed as midshipman in the US Navy, where he served on the frigate Columbia and the sloop John Adams. Five years later, he was sentto the US Naval Academy and the next year went to sea. By 1850 he was doing surveying in the Pacific, and resigned his commission to work in the gold fields in California, as did many people during the great\n\nGold Rush.\n\nHe rejoined the US Navy in 1854, where he was wounded in a duel. At the start of the Civil War, he was Lieutenant Commander, executive officer on Admiral Farragut’s flagship, the Hartford, where he was recognized for covering the sides of the ship with chains to protect it from cannon fire. In 1862 he commanded the Winona and then of the Kearsarge. This famous battle between the Kearsarge and the Alabama, in 1864 has gone down in Naval History, when the Alabama sank. James Sheppard Thornton received a Congressional vote of thanks and was given command of the Kearsarge. He was promoted to the rank of Captain at the Portsmouth Navy Yard in 1872. His last duty assignment was on the USS Monongahela, when he was injured aboard ship in the Pacific and sent home from South Africa. Upon arrival in the US, he died in 1875 in a hospital in Germantown PA, after which his body was returned to Merrimack, where he is buried today. He isfurther honored by having a torpedo boat, “The Thornton” named after him.\n\nJames Shepard Thornton was born in Merrimack, New Hampshire on 25 February 1826 and entered the Navy as a Midshipman in January 1841. Following duty in the frigate Columbia in the Home and Mediterranean Squadrons, he was assigned to the sloops of war John Adams and Falmouth, in which he served during the Mexican War. Beginning in late 1846 Thornton attended the U.S. Naval School at Annapolis, Maryland, and was promoted to the rank of Passed Midshipman in August 1847. He next served in the store ship Relief and in December 1848 was sent to Pacific coast for duty in the Coast Survey vessel Ewing. Thornton resigned from the service in May 1850, spent the next four years surveying gold fields in California and Utah, rejoined the Navy in February 1854 and again served in the Relief. Promoted to Acting Master in May 1855, he left the service later in that year but returned in January 1858 with the rank of Lieutenant and was once more assigned to the Relief.\n\nWhen Lieutenant Thornton's tour on USS Relief ended in mid-1860 he served on the Receiving Ship at Boston until the beginning of the Civil War. From May to November 1861 he was an officer of the brig Bainbridge, operating on blockade duty in the Gulf of Mexico. Late in that year he became Executive Officer of the steam sloop Hartford, performing with distinction in her during the Mississippi River campaigns of 1862. Promoted to Lieutenant Commander in July, he commanded the gunboat Winona in the Gulf area during August and September 1862. In April 1863 he became Executive Officer of the steam sloop Kearsarge, cruising in European waters, and in her participated in the successful 19 June 1864 action against the Confederate cruiser Alabama. Thornton finished the Civil War as Commanding Officer of the gunboat Iosco, operating in the North Carolina Sounds.\n\nFrom October 1865 Thornton had shore duty at the Portsmouth Navy Yard, Kittery, Maine, and was promoted to the rank of Commander in mid-1866. He returned to USS Kearsarge as her Commanding Officer in July 1868, serving in her in the Pacific until November 1870, after which he was again assigned to the Portsmouth Navy Yard. In May 1872 Thornton achieved the rank of Captain and in August 1873 was ordered to command the steam sloop Monongahela on the South Atlantic Station. On 14 January 1875, Captain Thornton's spine was gravely injured when his ship made a sudden lurch, throwing him against cabin furniture. Left an invalid, he was ordered home in February and died of his injuries at Germantown, Pennsylvania, on 14 May 1875.\n\nMatthew Thornton was born in Lisburn, County Antrim, Ireland on March 3, 1714 of Scotch-Irish parents, James Thornton, and Elizabeth Jenkins. When he was three years old, his family emigrated to America, settling first in what would become the state of Maine.\n\nIn 1722, Indians attacked the Maine settlement in the vicinity of Brunswick (or possibly Wiscasset) where they lived. James Thornton, his wife Elizabeth, and their 8-year-old son Matthew, escaped from their burning home by canoe, paddled out to Casco Bay, and proceeded from there to the Scotch-Irish town of Worcester, Massachusetts. There Thornton grew up receiving a classical education at Worcester Academy.\n\nYoung Thornton pursued medical studies in Leicester, Massachusetts under the direction of Doctor Grout, a relative. In 1740, at the age of 26, he began what became a thriving medical practice in the Scotch-Irish town of Londonderry, New Hampshire. He soon became distinguished, both as a physician and a surgeon.\n\nIn 1745, at the age of 31, Dr. Thornton served as a surgeon in the New Hampshire militia during King George’s War (1745-48). He accompanied Sir William Pepperell in the British expedition that captured Louisburg, the French fortress in Nova Scotia.\n\nDr. Thornton was elected a delegate for Londonderry to the colonial assembly in 1758, and began to figure prominently in colonial affairs.\n\nDerry, NH (Preserved)\n\nHe married Hannah Jack in 1760, and they had five children. Hannah’s parents were Andrew Jack and Mary Morrison, both of Scotch-Irish descent. Hannah Jack was born in 1742 and died on December 5, 1786.\n\nIn 1765, Thornton was prominent in the agitation against the Stamp Act in New Hampshire, but later held a commission as Colonel of militia under Royal Governor Wentworth.\n\nIn 1775, Dr. Thornton denounced the “unconstitutional and tyrannical Acts of the British Parliament”, and was elected President of the New Hampshire Provincial Congress when Royal Governor Wentworth fled from the Colony and boarded a British warship in Portsmouth. Thornton was also appointed Chairman of the provincial committee of safety in charge of raising troops and arms.\n\nUpon taking office, Thornton issued a statement to the citizens of New Hampshire, and this is part of what he said: “Friends and brethren, you must all be sensible that the affairs of America have, at length, come to a very affecting and alarming crisis. The horrors and distresses of a civil war, which, till of late, we only had in contemplation, we now find ourselves obliged to realize. Painful beyond expression, have been those scenes of blood and devastation which the barbarous cruelty of British troops has placed before our eyes. Duty to God, to ourselves, to posterity, ends forced by the cries of slaughtered innocents, have urged us to take up arms in our own defense….we seriously and earnestly recommend the practice of that pure and undefiled religion, which embalmed the memory of our pious ancestors, as that alone upon which we can build a solid hope and confidence in the Divine protection and favour, without whose blessing all the measures of safety we have, or can propose, will end in our shame and disappointment.”\n\nDr. Thornton was President of the five-man committee that drafted the first state constitution, and it was adopted on January 5, 1776, the first of the thirteen states to establish a constitution. Thornton was then elected to the new state legislature and elected Speaker of that assembly.\n\nIn September 1776, Dr. Thornton, at the age of 62, was chosen a delegate to the Continental Congress, and took his seat on the 4th of November 1776. Although Thornton was not present during the debates on independence or when 50 of the delegates signed the Declaration on August 2, he became one of six signers who did so in the following months. All six of these signers fully supported the sentiments in the document, and were permitted to affix their signatures to the engrossed copy of the Declaration of Independence.\n\nDespite having no legal education, Thornton served as chief justice of the Court of Common Pleas, the superior court of New Hampshire, from 1776 until 1782. After serving in the Continental Congress for only a little over a year, he left Congress and resumed his duties as associate justice of the Superior Court. In his seventies he served in the New Hampshire State senate from 1784 until 1786.\n\nIn 1780, he purchased a farm on the banks of the Merrimac River, near Exeter, where he devoted himself to the business of agriculture. He spent his last years farming and operating a ferry—Lutwyche’s (later Thornton’s) Ferry—across the Merrimac River. The house and ferry he purchased had been confiscated from a prominent Tory—Edward Gladstone Lutwyche.\n\nAlthough often exposed to the whooping cough, Thornton did not catch the disease until he passed his eightieth year, and he survived the attack. He continued to write essays and letters to newspapers on various topics well into his eighties, including an unpublished work on the metaphysical origins of sin.\n\nDr. Thornton exceeded six feet in height; his complexion was dark and his eyes black and piercing. At the age of 61, he was described as tall, clear-eyed, handsome, and charming.\n\nHe was described as a man of strong powers of mind, and on most subjects to which he directed his attention, was able to elicit light and information. In private life, he was peculiarly instructive and agreeable. The young were delighted with his hilarity and humor. His memory was well stored with entertaining and instructive anecdotes, which he was able to apply upon any incident or subject of conversation. He often illustrated his sentiments by fable. He delighted to amuse a circle of an evening by some fictitious narrative, in which he greatly excelled. At such times, placing his elbows upon his knees, and supporting his head with his hands, he would rivet the attention of his auditors, and astonish them by his powers of invention. In satire he was scarcely equaled. And although he sometimes employed his power immoderately, he was universally beloved, and occupied a large share of the confidence of his neighbors.\n\nThornton died while visiting his daughter in Newburyport, Massachusetts on the 24th of June, 1803, at the age of 89. His original gravestone was inscribed, “An Honest Man.” On May 22, 1892, New Hampshire dedicated a monument honoring Thornton’s memory located at the entrance to the Thornton Ferry Cemetery in Merrimack, New Hampshire, where he is buried.\n\nRev. Dr. Burnap spoke these words at his funeral: “He was venerable for his age, and skilled in his profession, and for the several very important and honorable offices he had sustained; noted for the knowledge he had acquired, and his quick penetration into matters of abstruse speculation; exemplary for his regard for the public institutions of religion, and for his consistency in attending the public worship, where he trod the courts of the house of God, with steps tottering with age and infirmity. Such is a brief outline of one who was honored in his day and generation; whose virtues were a model for imitation, and while memory does her office, will be had in grateful recollection.”\n\nThe Matthew Thornton Chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution placed a bronze marker at his grave, which reads, “Revolutionary Soldier, Matthew Thornton, 1775-1782”.\n\nIn the village of Thornton’s Ferry, Merrimack, New Hampshire, in the northbound lane of Route 3, there is this highway marker: “One of three New Hampshire men to sign the Declaration of Independence, Matthew Thornton, physician, soldier, patriot, agitated against the Stamp Act of 1765, presided over the Provincial Congress in 1775, served in the State Senate and as an associate justice of the Superior Court. The nearby monument honors his memory. He is buried in the adjacent cemetery. His homestead stands directly across the highway.” The signer’s house and Matthew Thornton Cemetery were listed on the National Register in 1978.\n\nThornton’s previous residence was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1971.\n\nThornton’s previous residence, on 2 Thornton Street, in Derry, New Hampshire was listed on the National Register and designated a National Historic Landmark in 1971.\n\nThe town of Thornton, New Hampshire was named in his honor, and there is a Matthew Thornton High School in Londonderry, New Hampshire.\n\nIn Washington, D.C., near the Washington Monument, is a memorial park and lagoon celebrating the signers of the Declaration of Independence, and one of the 56 granite blocks there is inscribed with the name of Matthew Thornton.\n\n1840: Born (Candia, New Hampshire) - Henry W. Rowe - Recipient of the Congressional Medal of Honor Name:Henry Walker Rowe - Age at Enlistment:22 Enlistment Date:14 Aug 1862\n\nPRIVATE HENRY W. ROWE, of the Eleventh New Hampshire Volunteers, gives the following interesting description of how he won his Medal of Honor: \" On the night of the 15th of June, 1864, Burnside with his Ninth Corps crossed the James River, and after a twenty-four hour march arrived at the outposts of Petersburg with the advance of his corps. At 6 P. M. an advance was made in the face of a murderous fire, and the Eleventh New Hampshire Volunteers, together with the Second Maryland, succeeded in getting close under a rebel battery. After several hours of continuous firing, during which many men were killed and wounded, the assault had to be given up. \" Not discouraged by this first repulse, Burnside reconnoitered the lines and determined to make a second assault.\n\nThe point chosen for the attack was a residence owned by Mr. Shand, a large two-story building shaded by buttonwood and gum trees, with a peach orchard in the rear. Fifty yards from the front door was a narrow ravine fifteen or twenty feet deep, with a brook flowing northward. West of the house about the same distance was another brook, the two joining twenty rods north of the house. A rebel brigade held this tongue of land with four guns. Their main line of breastworks was along the edge of the ravine east of the house. South, and on higher ground, was a redan with two guns, which enfiladed the ravine. \" It was Burnside's idea to take this tongue of land, break the rebel line and compel the evacuation of the redan. General Potter's Division of the Ninth Corps was selected to carry out his plan, and the attacking column was to consist of General Griffin's brigade on the right, supported by Curtis' on the left.\n\nGriffin's brigade contained, all told, only 260 men, and in the front line the Eleventh New Hampshire found its place, including Company I with its remaining five privates. \" A little past midnight General Potter led his division into the ravine in front of the house. The soldiers divested themselves of knapsacks, canteens and cups-everything which could make a noise-and moved forward stealthily. All was still and perfectly quiet. We reached the ravine, and there above us, not fifteen paces distant, were the rebel pickets. The night was warm and sultry.\n\nThe sky was flecked by only a few light clouds, the moon becoming full and clear. Not a sound was heard, save the rumble of a wagon or a stray shot from the enemy's pickets. \" Finally, a little past three, as the dawn was beginning to light up in the east, the command, 'Forward !' was passed along the line in whispers. \" The men rose in a body from the ground; not a gunlock clicked; the bayonet was to do the work, Forward we started with steady, noiseless step. One bound and the rebel pickets were overpowered. Now toward the Shand House, and over the breastworks!\n\nAt the right of the house, Comrade Batchelder, of Company I, joined me, and soon we fell in with 'Sol' Dodge, Sergeant of Company C. Passing the second corner of the house, we heard the report of a musket from a rebel pit about fifteen feet to the right. We ran around to the rear of this pit and shouted: 'Surrender, you damned rebels!' The 'Johnnies' were rather rudely awakened from their sleep, and although twenty- seven in number, dropped their guns.\n\nGuarded by our attacking force of three, they were finally turned over to the Union officers in the rear, together with a rebel flag captured by myself. The rebel line was broken and Grant's lines were drawn closer around Petersburg.\"\n\n1917: Born - Harl Pease Jr - Recipient of the Congressional Medal of Honor World War II Congressional Medal of Honor recipient.\n\nBorn in Plymouth, New Hampshire April 10, 1917. Harl Pease Jr. enlisted in the Army Air Corps in 1939. He served as a Captain in the 19th Bomb Group, U.S. Army Air Corps in the Pacific Theater. During a bombing mission over New Guinea on August 5, 1942 one of the engines on his B-17 bomber failed, forcing him to return to an Australian base. There, he selected an aircraft deemed unready for combat missions, but air worthy. Leaving early in the morning, he flew throughout the day, and rejoined his squadron at Port Moresby, New Guinea.\n\nOn August 07, 1942, the squadron took off for an attack on a Japanese held airfield near Rabaul, New Britain. The squadron was attacked by about thirty enemy aircraft before reaching their target. He being on the wing of the squadron was able to shoot down several Zeroes and managed to drop his bomb load on the hostile base. His plane was damaged in the attack and fell behind the squadron. The enemy succeeded in igniting one of his bomb bay tanks which he jettisoned, but it was believed that he and his crew were eventually shot down, as they did not return to the home base. In September 1942, a Roman Catholic Priest, Father George Lepping was taken as a prisoner to a Japanese camp near Rabaul. He reported that he found Captain Pease and one his crewmen at the prison camp. Father Lepping reported that Captain Pease, three Americans and two Australian prisoners were taken into the jungle, were forced to dig their own graves and executed by the sword.\n\nOn December 2, 1942, the Medal of Honor, the Distinguished Flying Cross with an Oak Leaf Cluster, and the Air Medal was posthumously awarded by President Franklin D. Roosevelt to Mr. and Mrs. Harl Pease Sr. For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity above and beyond the call of duty in action with the enemy on 6–7 August 1942. When 1 engine of the bombardment airplane of which he was pilot failed during a bombing mission over New Guinea, Capt. Pease was forced to return to a base in Australia. Knowing that all available airplanes of his group were to participate the next day in an attack on an enemy-held airdrome near Rabaul, New Britain, although he was not scheduled to take part in this mission, Capt. Pease selected the most serviceable airplane at this base and prepared it for combat, knowing that it had been found and declared unserviceable for combat missions. With the members of his combat crew, who volunteered to accompany him, he rejoined his squadron at Port Moresby, New Guinea, at 1 a.m. on 7 August, after having flown almost continuously since early the preceding morning. With only 3 hours' rest, he took off with his squadron for the attack.\n\nThroughout the long flight to Rabaul, New Britain, he managed by skillful flying of his unserviceable airplane to maintain his position in the group. When the formation was intercepted by about 30 enemy fighter airplanes before reaching the target, Capt. Pease, on the wing which bore the brunt of the hostile attack, by gallant action and the accurate shooting by his crew, succeeded in destroying several Zeros before dropping his bombs on the hostile base as planned, this in spite of continuous enemy attacks. The fight with the enemy pursuit lasted 25 minutes until the group dived into cloud cover. After leaving the target, Capt. Pease's aircraft fell behind the balance of the group due to unknown difficulties as a result of the combat, and was unable to reach this cover before the enemy pursuit succeeded in igniting 1 of his bomb bay tanks. He was seen to drop the flaming tank. It is believed that Capt. Pease's airplane and crew were subsequently shot down in flames, as they did not return to their base. In voluntarily performing this mission Capt. Pease contributed materially to the success of the group, and displayed high devotion to duty, valor, and complete contempt for personal danger. His undaunted bravery has been a great inspiration to the officers and men of his unit.\n\nInformation pieced together after the war from two Catholic priests who had been at the Rabaul prisoner of war camp indicates that Captain Pease and another crew member did survive the crash. They were subsequently held at the camp for several weeks, and on October 8, 1942, they were executed by the Japanese. On December 2, 1942, the Medal of Honor, awarded posthumously to Captain Pease for his heroism in combat, was presented by President Franklin D. Roosevelt to the hero's parents.\n\nIn formal dedication ceremonies, Portsmouth Air Force Base was dedicated to Captain Pease on September 7, 1957. That tradition continued 40 years later, as Pease Air National Guard Base was formally rededicated on September 19, 1997.\n\n1922 - Born in Newport Rhode Island -Charles \"Bud\" Thompson - Creator of the Mt. Kearsarge Indian Museum in Warner New Hampshire.\n\nA native of Newport, RI, Bud recalls that life-changing day in second grade. \"Our teacher told us we were going to have a visitor. Then in walked a huge, handsome Indian. Our eyes popped out of our heads, but he wasn't threatening.\" Sachem Silver Star invited the children to sit on the floor in a circle, the Native American's most sacred symbol, \"because when you take your place in the circle, you belong.\" Eyes twinkling, Bud continues. \"Silver Star told us that when you're born, you're given a special gift, a talent. When you find it, use it.\" That evening, little Bud described the encounter to his family, including his older sister who had nicked named him. \"She said 'Write him a letter and tell him how great he is. Tell him you hope he'll read about you someday.' So I did and my sister corrected my spelling.\" Silver Star duly responded, enclosing a photo of himself and thanking Bud. \"He said he was already proud of me for writing the letter.\"\n\nThat summer, young Bud visited his grandparents on their farm in Connecticut, where he enjoyed working alongside his grandpa in the garden. \"It was a scorcher of a day,\" Bud recalls. \"I was drinking cold water under a maple tree when I saw a little stone. Grandpa told me it was an Indian arrowhead, probably a spear point or a knife blade. Grandpa told me it was like a voice out of the past telling me someone had once lived here.\" The discovery had a profound effect on the small boy who began to collect more artifacts from Grandpa -- Algonquin, Pequod and Mohegan -- even as he discovered his own talents. The philosophy of Silverstar continues to resonate for Bud and his wife, Nancy, Co-founders of Mt. Kearsarge Indian Museum. The Thompsons were deeply troubled by the harm being done to the environment by greed and apathy. With the help of friends, Bud and Nancy set in motion a plan to create a unique museum, not just a mausoleum of artifacts, but an education and cultural center – a “Museum with a Voice” to pass along Silverstar’s message.\n\nThe artifacts, instead of being just things would inform the study of cultures that understood how to live harmoniously with this land so as to leave it fruitful and beautiful for generations to come. With this in mind, the Museum galleries, grounds and gardens were designed as teaching tools while also functioning as tranquility zones in which visitors would find respite from the hectic pace of modern life. Consider these statistics in the light of Silverstar’s brief visit. In the 27 years since this “dream museum” was founded, more than 250,000 visitors from all over the U.S. and 34 foreign countries have experienced the Museum with a Voice. MKIM is a favorite site for educational school field trips, and hosts over 5,000 school children a year! An inspired teacher, Silverstar has passed away but his message lives on and thousands of lives have been touched by his inspirational philosophy. One man laid out a road map, a clear path to follow; one boy took that message to heart and made it his life’s journey and we are all the better for it.\n\nThe Medicine Woods Nature Trail - Dump to Tranquility Zone In a triumphant story of reclamation, what is now MKIM’s Medicine Woods Trail, was once an unofficial dump. Coils of barbed wire, a broken manure spreader, an old safe minus its door, a refrigerator, lengths of rope, smashed glass and bald tires once littered what is now a peaceful refuge from the hectic pace of the modern world. This space exists as an educational tool that let’s you step out of the daily grind and reconnect with the Earth. Museum Founders Bud and Nancy Thompson had the vision to see the potential of a beautiful arboretum amidst the refuse. With the help and hard work of friends and volunteers, the vision became a reality. Roger Sanborn, a former MKIM Trustee, brought in a front-end loader and a dump truck to haul off larger items. Smaller pieces were picked up by hand. The Student Conservation Association, headquartered in Charlestown, NH, laid out and mapped the trail and leveled pathways.\n\nBud identified wild plants and set about obtaining non-represented plants used by Native Americans for the site. Generous assistance from Millican Nurseries enables this process even today. Current Board Chairperson, Betsy Janeway orchestrated the securing of a grant to continue trail development. In 2006, our Gardens and Grounds Director, John Brooks, undertook the direction of an ambitious renovation. With grant funding generously awarded by the New Hampshire State Conservation Commission, the trails were widened; leveled significantly, new trails were developed, and new trail covering mulch installed. The result is that the overall accessibility of the Medicine Woods was greatly enhanced, allowing visitors of all ages and abilities to enjoy this jewel. The Medicine Woods was dedicated in June of 1992. John Peters, whose Native name was Slow Turtle, and who was the Supreme Medicine Man of the Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe, presided over the ceremony. His blessing rests lightly over the Medicine Woods to this day.\n\nOver the years, plants have thrived or not, based on their adaptability to our climate. Former Board Secretary and current Honorary Trustee Karen Sullivan produced signs while her husband Joseph, an engineer, developed a bridge to arch over the delicate wetland area to preserve it. Bud is often to be found tending the plants, shrubs and trees. His goal is to showcase plants used by Native Peoples for food, medicine, tools and dyes. Today, Museum Educators take groups, including school groups, on tours through the Medicine Woods. MKIM seeks to develop a greater understanding of, and active respect for, the natural world we all share and upon which our survival is dependant. Visitors, and especially children, listen eagerly to descriptions of how plants were used and quickly grasp the idea that humans are part of the sacred circle and have a responsibility to act responsibly as caregivers to the Earth – mother to us all.\n\nFrom the Past to the Present MKIM’s mission presents the museum’s goal of connecting people to 20,000 years of ongoing Native American cultural expression. In this way, we span a timeframe that reaches back to the roots of this land, long before it was called America or had been “found” by people from Europe. Native North Americans are an original element in the multi-cultural landscape of the United States. Unfortunately, their complex cultures suffered, and continue to suffer, extreme dissipative pressures after the arrival of the Europeans and the founding of our nation. These cultures form a natural treasure – they exist nowhere but here.\n\nAmerica has been likened to a “melting pot” but that metaphor implies that all the diverse elements are boiled down into a homogenous state. At the Museum a different metaphor prevails – that of the tapestry. If America is seen as a great weaving, in which unique strands retain their distinctiveness while adding to the beauty of the whole – then Native Americans are the original strand. Their history in this land dates back thousands and thousands of years. Much of the archaeological work done in the state relates to Native American artifacts. Putting the science of archaeology in New Hampshire into a Native American context is one of MKIM’s goals. In this we have had the invaluable assistance of several key individuals. Howard Sargent, a Founding Trustee, and seminal figure in New Hampshire archaeology was a key advisor to the Thompson’s as their dream museum took shape. In addition, he created the large mural map of the continent that graces our lobby.\n\nThis map, unfortunately incomplete at the time of Sargent’s death, vividly illustrates the range of Native habitation – coast to coast, north to south. Below it is a case containing archaeological artifacts found in New Hampshire including an excellent example of a prehistoric Woodland ceramic vessel as well as lithic implements such as stone axes. As a member of MKIM’s Collections Committee, State Archaeologist Richard Boisvert, helps assess collecting priorities and renovation proposals that impact MKIM’s collections. His office works with MKIM in presenting Project Archaeology trainings that highlight the importance of the land we call New Hampshire. We are grateful to all those who have helped MKIM in its mission to educate visitors about the full scope of Native expression.\n\nAugust 12, 2021 - It is with great sadness that we announce the passing of Charles “Bud” Thompson, founder of the Mt. Kearsarge Indian Museum, at 99 years of age. From the time he was a young boy, Bud cultivated a love for all things Native American. At the age of 70, he turned his passion into the Mt Kearsarge Indian Museum, with his extensive personal collection of Native artifacts serving as the foundation for this award-winning museum. Through his leadership, the museum has grown and thrived over the past thirty years.\n\nBud’s contributions were not limited to the museum; he was also instrumental in preserving the Canterbury Shaker Village, and received numerous awards and commendations for his contributions to preserving New Hampshire’s heritage, culture, and history.\n\nBud’s energy and ideas for the museum will be sorely missed, and we extend our sincerest condolences to his wife, family, and the many people whose lives were touched by him. We are honored to be the stewards of his vision and his legacy, and will do everything in our power to safeguard this legacy for the generations to come.\n\nA public memorial service for Bud Thompson was held at the museum (outdoors) on Saturday, September 25th, 2021 at 2 pm. Thank you to all who were able to attend and who donated to the museum in memory of Bud.\n\nHon. John Kimball, A.M., ex-mayor of Concord, N.H., a man of strong character, sterling worth, and more than ordinary ability, is held in high esteem by his fellow-citizens.\n\nHe was born in Canterbury, N.H., April 13, 1821, a son of Benjamin and Ruth (Ames) Kimball. The Kimballs have been domiciled in New England for more than two hundred and sixty years, and have given to these States many intelligent and capable men and women. The first immigrants of the name, Henry and Richard Kimball, with their wives and children, fled from the religious persecutions of the Old World, and found freedom and prosperity in the new. Joseph Kimball, who was of the fifth generation in America, was the great-grandfather of John Kimball. He was born in Exeter, N.H., and died in Canterbury.\n\nJohn Kimball was apprenticed at the age of seventeen to his father’s cousin, William Moody Kimball, to learn the millwright’s trade; and, as he had a natural gift for mechanics, it was not long before he was a Suncook and Manchester, N.H., and Lowell and Lawrence, Mass. In 1848 he took charge of the new machine and car shops of the Concord Railroad in this city. In 1850 he was master mechanic; and he efficiently acted in that capacity for eight years, turning his attention then from mechanical to other pursuits. In the railroad service his practical skill and sound judgment were in constant requisition, and his training and experience there were afterward used to good account in behalf of the city and State. He gradually became interested in various financial and political enterprises, and as his ability became recognized greater responsibilities devolved upon him. Thousands of dollars were entrusted to him as guardian, trustee, administrator, and executor, and never was a trust betrayed or slighted; and, to quote from a local paper, “as Treasurer of the New Hampshire Bible Society, the New Hampshire Orphans’ Home, and various other such institutions, he has been trustworthy, painstaking, and just.” For twenty-six years he has been Treasurer of the Merrimack County Savings Bank. He has been for a number of years a Director of the Mechanics National Bank; and he has filled the office of President of the Concord Gas Light Company, of which he is now Treasurer. In 1880, when the Manchester & Keene Railroad was placed in the hands of the court, the late Chief Justice Doe appointed Mr. Kimball one of the Trustees.\n\nMr. Kimball’s father and grandfather were stanch Whigs; and he has followed the family traditions, giving his lifelong allegiance to the Republican party. He was for twenty-seven years Treasurer of the Republican State Committee. In 1856 he was elected to the Common Council of this city. In 1857 he was re-elected and chosen President of that body. In 1858 he was sent to the House of Representatives from Ward Five, where he has always made his home since he took up his residence in this city; and he was re-elected in 1859, and presided as Chairman of the Committee on State Prison. From 1859 to 1862 he was City Marshal and Tax Collector of Concord; and his administration was marked by “promptness, accuracy, and close devotion to the interests of the people.” In 1862 President Lincoln appointed him Collector of Internal Revenue for the Second District of New Hampshire, comprising Merrimack and Hillsborough Counties; and during the seven years he held the office he collected and paid to the Treasurer of the United States nearly seven million dollars. He was for eleven years Moderator of Ward Five, an impartial and clear-headed presiding officer; and for a number of years he served acceptably as moderator of the Union School District.\n\nIn 1872 through a popular movement he was elected Mayor of Concord. He was honored with re-election in 1873, 1874, and 1875, annual elections then being the law. Immediately after his installation as Mayor a severe freshet injured five of the seven wooden bridges over the Merrimack and Contoocook Rivers. As superintendent of roads and bridges he repaired these structures in such a manner as to demonstrate his mechanical knowledge, replacing the insecure bridges by substantial structures that defy the wear and tear of time and travel. During his administration the water supply system from Penacook Lake was completed; and he was afterward elected one of the Water Commissioners, and served for fourteen years as President of the Board. While he was Mayor, also, the fire department was invested with new dignity by the city government, the central fire station and other Mayor Kimball. Blossom Hill Cemetery was doubled in size, the main thoroughfares of the city were graded and improved, and stone culverts replaced the primitive wooden ones which had served for years.\n\nIn 1876 Mr. Kimball was elected a member of the convention to revise the Constitution of the State, and served as Chairman of its Committee on Finance. In 1877 an appropriation was made by the legislature for a new State Prison; and upon the passage of the law, which was a carefully guarded one, Governor Benjamin F. Prescott, with the advice of his council, appointed Mr. Kimball, Albert M. Shaw, and Alfred J. Pillsbury commissioners to carry the law into effect. Mr. Kimball was chosen chairman of the board. Under these commissioners the present penitentiary was completed in the fall of 1880, every dollar appropriated being prudently and judiciously expended. In November, 1880, Mr. Kimball was elected to the State Senate from the Tenth Senatorial District; and when the Senate was organized, in June, 1881, he was chosen President. In this honorable position he presided with wisdom, dignity, and courtesy. He was chairman of the committee that built the high school, and he has rendered such services to the cause of popular education that one of the handsomest modern school-houses in Concord has been named in his honor the Kimball School. Mr. Kimball was honored with the degree of Master of Arts by Dartmouth College in 1884. He was a Director of the Republican Press Association of Concord.\n\nOn May 27, 1846, he was married to Maria H. Phillips, of Rupert, Vt., who died December 22, 1894. He has since married Miss Charlotte Atkinson, a lady of culture and refinement. His only child, a daughter-Clara Maria, born March 20, 1848 -was married June 4, 1873, to Augustine R. Ayers, of this city, and had several children.\n\nIn person Mr. Kimball is tall, erect, and remarkably well-preserved for a man of seventy-six. He is a total abstainer, and his modes of life are regular. He is firm and decided, with strong confidence in his own judgment; frank and downright, always giving right the precedence of policy; somewhat bluff in manner, but never discourteous; openhearted and free, kindly and sensitive. A careful reader, he is particularly fond of genealogical and historical research; and he speaks and writes with precision. Faithful in every relation of life, public and domestic, he is valued and loved by all. Mr. Kimball has travelled abroad, and is one of the most cultured men of the day. In 1843 he joined the Congregational church at his old home in Boscawen, N.H.; and for a great many years he has been a member of the South Congregational Church of Concord, contributing generously to its support.\n\n1946: Born - Stephen Merrill - Governor of New Hampshire in Hampton New Hampshire\n\nSTEPHEN MERRILL was raised in the seacoast town of Hampton, New Hampshire. In 1969 he earned a bachelor of arts degree in history from the University of New Hampshire (UNH), where he was a Ford Foundation scholar; he was the first governor of the state to graduate from UNH.\n\nHe received a law degree from Georgetown University Law School in 1972. He was in the U.S. Air Force from 1969 to 1976, serving as civilian aide to the secretary of the U.S. Army for the final two years. He served as the state attorney general from 1984 to 1989. He was elected governor in November 1992 and reelected in 1994.\n\nSeptember 5, 2020: Former Gov. Stephen E. Merrill, a fiscally conservative staunch opponent of broad based taxes and a family man known as much for his sense of humor as his adherence to Republican principles, has died at the age of 74, his family and Gov. Chris Sununu announced Saturday evening.\n\nMerrill was elected the state's 77th governor in 1992 and was reelected in 1994 after serving as New Hampshire attorney general and earlier, as legal counsel and chief of staff to former Gov. John H. Sununu.\n\nMerrill was known for his tough conservatism but also for his affable demeanor and exuberant personality.\n\nA statement was issued by the Merrill family:\n\n\"With regret, we share the news with the State of New Hampshire that former Attorney General and Governor Stephen Merrill passed away peacefully at his home with his family today. Additional information about remembrance services will be forthcoming. We ask that you please respect the privacy of our family at this difficult time.\"\n\nGov. Chris Sununu, who was a youngster when Merrill served in his father's administration, said:\n\n\"Governor Steve Merrill was a dear friend who had an incredibly positive impact on the citizens of our state. He will be missed by everyone who knew him.\"\n\nMerrill was a native of Norwich, Connecticut but came to New Hampshire at an early age. He was a graduate of Winnicunnet High School in Hampton and the University of New Hampshire, graduating Phi Beta Kappa.\n\nMerrill served in the U.S. Air Force as a lawyer from 1972 to 1976 and was legal counsel to the Secretary of the Air Force.\n\nAfter practicing law in Manchester from 1976 to 1984, Merrill became legal counsel and later chief of staff to the elder Sununu before serving as attorney general.\n\nHe succeeded Judd Gregg as governor when Gregg won election to the U.S. Senate. Merrill defeated broad based tax advocate former state Rep. Arnie Arnesen, and was he reelected in 1994, defeating former state Sen. Wayne King. After two terms, he returned to private life.\n\nMerrill during his years as governor held the line against spending but also was a defendant in the Claremont school funding lawsuit. In opposing broad based taxes and advocating for smaller government and fewer regulation, he coined the phrase, \"New Hampshire Advantage.\"\n\nRepublicans today, including the current Gov. Sununu, still use that phrase often as a mantra to describe their support for lower taxes and smaller government.\n\nMerrill was twice named “the most fiscally conservative governor” in the United States by the Wall Street Journal and the Cato Institute. Merrill was also active as an advocate for the Daniel Webster Council of the Boy Scouts of America.\n\nWhile governor, Merrill joined with fellow Republican and Democrats leaders to protect the first-in-the-nation status of the New Hampshire presidential primary against a threat by Delaware officials to encroach on the primary's first-by-a-week status. In 1995, he drew national headlines by backing former Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole for president.\n\nDole fell a percentage point short in his New Hampshire primary bid to conservative firebrand Patrick J. Buchanan but went on to win the 1996 Republican presidential nomination.\n\nAfter leaving office in 1996, Merrill tried his hand at national politics, running for chairman of the Republican National Committee. He competed for several ballots in that voting, but eventually withdrew and the chairmanship went to Jim Nicholson of Colorado, who later became Secretary of Veterans Affairs.\n\nMerrill later became chair of the prominent Boston-based Bingham Consulting firm.\n\nA Manchester resident, Stephen Merrill is survived by his wife, Heather, and two sons, Stephen and Ian.\n\nThe elder Sununu said he was saddened to learn of Merrill’s passing.\n\n“He was a nice man and a smart man,\" said Sununu, who called Merrill \"a dear friend.\"\n\n\"He did a good job for the state and a wonderful job for me as my legal counsel. He had never been involved in politics. I met him through the campaign, and in an out-of-the-box move, I invited him to come in to my office as legal counsel, and later nominated him as attorney general.\"\n\n“I’m a conservative Republican and he was a conservative Republican and we both worked to make sure that New Hampshire stayed New Hampshire,” Sununu said. “And he was fun to be around. We always had a good time.\n\n“Steve was able to keep his eye on the objective and still have a good time going from Point A to Point B, and he was able to succeed.”\n\nMerrill, after serving as attorney general and before being elected governor, partnered in a law firm with Democrat John Broderick. The two were friends for more than four decades.\n\nWhen Merrill became governor, he received some criticism from conservative Republicans for naming Broderick as an associate justice of the New Hampshire Supreme Court because Broderick was from the opposing party. But Merrill was unfazed.\n\nLater, in 2004, Broderick was named chief justice by another Republican governor, Craig Benson.\n\nAn emotional Broderick told WMUR on Saturday night, “Steve Merrill’s life was a testament to his commitment to something larger than himself. He was political – he was very good at what he did, but he wasn’t ‘sharp-edge’ political.\"\n\nBroderick said that people would ask him how he and Republican Merrill could get along while on opposite sides of the political aisle.\n\n“And I’d say I love Steve Merrill. It wasn’t about what issue he felt strongly about or what issue I felt strongly about. I admired his character.\n\n“He was a talented politician, a gifted lawyer and he was a wonderful friend,” Broderick said. “He knew how to do that well, too.”\n\nAnother Democrat who was a friend of Merrill is veteran state Sen. Lou D’Allesandro of Manchester.\n\n“It’s a terrible loss,” D’Allesandro said. “He was a young man in today’s world, a wonderful attorney and did a lot of good things for the state of New Hampshire.\n\n“He loved the state, a resident of Manchester, a UNH guy, which is very, very important. It’s a great loss to the state at a very early age when there was so much more to do and so much more to give to the people of the state. He’ll be greatly missed.”\n\nFormer Sen. Kelly Ayotte, who also served as attorney general before being elected to the Senate in 2010, said in a statement, “I am so sad about the passing of my friend and mentor Governor Steve Merrill.\n\n“New Hampshire has lost of one its best, a great leader and extraordinary person. I will miss Steve’s brilliance, his way with words and wonderful sense of humor. My thoughts and prayers are with Heather, Ian and Stephen.”\n\nThe state Republican Party said in a statement:\n\n\"We are deeply saddened by the passing of former New Hampshire Governor Steve Merrill, whose dedication to New Hampshire was exemplified through his public service as our state’s Attorney General and our 77th Governor. Our thoughts and prayers are with the Merrill family at this time.\"\n\nNew Hampshire Democratic Party Chair Raymond Buckley added his tribute.\n\n\"Condolences to former First Lady Heather Merrill and family in the passing of former Governor Merrill,\" Buckley said. \"As a legislator, I worked closely with him on several issues. He was always fair and kept his word. And nobody had a better smile than Steve Merrill.\"\n\nBryant \"Corky\" Messner called Merrill \"a true public servant, and his passing is a profound loss for those who knew him personally, professionally and politically. He was a man of integrity, a true conservative who never wavered in his beliefs.\n\n\"He is credited with creating the phrase 'New Hampshire Advantage' -- a reference to our lack of sales and income taxes -- and believed, as I do, in less government, individual liberty and economic freedom. My prayers are with his family and friends at this difficult time.\"\n\n1832 - Born: Thaddeus Sobieski Constantine Lowe in Jefferson Mills, New Hampshire. US Army First Aeronaut.\n\nIntellectually curious and driven from a young age, Lowe had almost no formal education but demonstrated an appetite for learning which hinted at his future career as an inventor. At the age of 18 he attended a lecture on the subject of lighter-than-air gases and so impressed the professor, Reginald Dinkelhoff, with his enthusiasm that Dinkelhoff offered to take the young Lowe on the lecture circuit with him as an assistant. Over the course of the next decade, Lowe devoted himself to balloon aviation, and became a prominent builder of balloons and showman.\n\nIn 1855, at one of his demonstrations, he met the Parisian actress Leontine Augustine Gaschon, and they were wed just one week later. The couple eventually had ten children. In the latter part of the decade he set about building bigger balloons, with an eye towards a transatlantic crossing, and began to garner a prominent scientific reputation. In April, 1861, Lowe intended to make a test run from Cincinnati, Ohio to Washington, D.C. He took off on April 19, just a week after the fall of Fort Sumter, but instead of heading due east towards Washington Lowe’s balloon was blown way off course, eventually landing in Unionville, South Carolina. There, he was arrested on suspicion of being a Northern spy.\n\nWhen he finally convinced the Confederate authorities of his innocence he returned to Cincinnati, only to be immediately summoned to Washington. The government was in fact interested in his experimental balloons as a means of gathering intelligence. In June of 1861, Lowe demonstrated for President Lincoln how useful his balloons could be when combined with new electric telegraph technology.\n\nOn the 11th of that month, from a height of 500 feet above the National Mall in Washington D.C., Lowe transmitted to the President: “This point of observation commands an extent of country nearly 50 miles in diameter. The city with its girdle of encampments, presents a superb scene. I have pleasure in sending you this first dispatch ever telegraphed from an aerial station, and in acknowledging indebtedness for your encouragement for the opportunity of demonstrating the availability of the science of aeronautics in the military service of the country.” Little more than a month later, Lowe and his balloon were in action during the First Battle of Bull Run, after which Lincoln approved the formation of the Union Army Balloon Corps, with Lowe as Chief Aeronaut (at a colonel’s salary). Lowe’s principal contribution to the militarization of balloon technology, and its use in the field, was the portable hydrogen gas generator, which allowed the balloons to accompany the army wherever they were needed. Made of a rugged material that could withstand the wear and tear of active campaigning, Lowe’s balloons could also be inflated in a very short amount of time.\n\nThey were a sensation in Washington, and many prominent military and political figures accompanied him on his ascensions. He eventually built a total of seven balloons and twelve generators for the war effort. In the spring of 1862, Lowe and his balloons played a significant role in the Peninsula Campaign, observing the enemy’s defensive dispositions and helping relay information during the slow but steady advance on Richmond. At the Battle of Seven Pines, Lowe’s aerial reconnaissance helped identify the buildup of Confederate forces near the Fair Oaks train station prior to the start of the battle. In addition to providing valuable aerial reconnaissance information, Lowe, when supported with direct telegraphic links to commanders, was able to provide near real-time artillery spotting to Army of the Potomac artillery units. While operating from Dr. Gaines’ farm on the future Gaines’ Mill battlefield, Lowe was positioned close enough to Richmond that he could clearly see the movements of soldiers and individuals within the city.\n\nThe sight of Lowe’s balloons, ominously hanging over the Virginia landscape, certainly must have unsettled the Confederates, who knew their movements were being observed by the enemy. While several attempts were made to destroy the Union balloons via long range artillery fire, none of Lowe’s balloons were ever damaged or destroyed in combat. Though Lowe and his balloons were able to avoid damaging enemy fire, Lowe himself contracted a serious bout of malaria from the mosquito infested waters near the Chickahominy River. After the conclusion of the Peninsula Campaign, Lowe’s Balloon Corps was utilized during the 1862 Fredericksburg and 1863 Chancellorsville campaigns.\n\nDuring this period, some Union commanders and leaders began to question Lowe’s heavy expenditures and poor administrative skills. Placed under a more controlling military command structure, the frustrated and sick Lowe resigned from his balloon corps and the use of balloons within the Union armies ended shortly afterwards. Lowe returned to the private sector following the war, and made a fortune developing ice-making machines before moving to Los Angeles, California in 1887. He died at his daughter’s home in Pasadena in 1913, aged 80\n\n1826 - Tragedy in Crawford Notch - The Willey Slide.\n\nIn 1825, Samuel Willey Jr. and his family moved into a house nestled in the heart of Crawford Notch. The events that transpired there unknowingly turned the White Mountains into one of the biggest tourist attractions on the East Coast.\n\nBorn in 1788, Samuel Willey Jr. was a New Hampshire local. He and his wife, Polly Lovejoy, were born in Concord, and owned a farm in Lower Bartlett. They stayed at the farm for thirteen years, raising their five children before relocating to Crawford Notch. Though Crawford Notch was relatively desolate at the time, the Willey family moved there in an attempt to break into the inn-keeping business. They purchased a house known as the Old Notch House built in 1793 and situated in the shadow of what is now called Mt. Willey. After they moved in, they hired two additional men to help enlarge and repair the house, turning it into a two-story home with stables and a barn. They renamed the house the Willey House Inn and Tavern.\n\nMost of the visitors who stayed at the Willey House were farmers from New Hampshire and Vermont who were passing through the Notch on their way to Portland, Maine. However, these were not the visitors the Willey family was anticipating. They were hoping for tourists who, inspired by the works of authors and artists at the time, came to Crawford Notch for the beauty of the White Mountains. The house was situated in a valley full of sugar maples, offering unparalleled fall colors. In June of 1826, a severe rainstorm tore through the White Mountains, causing a landslide across the Saco River. A huge mass of soil and vegetation slid into the floor of the valley near where the Willey House was situated. As a result, Samuel Willey Jr. decided to build a stone shelter slightly above the house where the family could flee if another landslide threatened the valley.\n\nTwo months later, in August of 1826, one of the most violent rainstorms ever known in the White Mountains passed through Crawford Notch. This rainstorm followed a period of severe drought which had transformed the mountain soil to powder and gravel. The result was another massive, destructive landslide. The Saco River rose 20 feet overnight, farms and their livestock were set afloat, and the dry soil came tumbling down into the valley. Able Crawford (for whom the Notch is named after) reported that his farm, located six miles below the Willey House, was destroyed. The next morning, a merchant traveled through the Notch to the Willey House. After navigating around six miles of rubble, he found the Willey House, still intact and standing. However, the Willey family and their two hired men were nowhere to be found. The merchant traveled back to Bartlett to spread the mysterious news. The day after, a search party full of anxious friends and relatives was organized. They reached the Willey House, but like the merchant, found it completely deserted. Though the area nearby was covered in debris and rubble, the house had somehow survived because it was situated near a rock ledge that divided the major slide into two streams. The slide, therefore, passed by the house on both sides leaving it untouched.\n\nInside the house the search party found unmade beds, clothes thrown about, and an open Bible on a table. The party concluded that the family must have left the house in a hurry. After hours of looking, the search party found the bodies of Mr. and Mrs. Willey, two of the children, and the two hired men nearby. They had been crushed in the wreckage of the slide. The three other children were never found. Though it’s not clear what happened, it’s presumed that the family had fled the Willey House to stay in the stone shelter that Samuel Willey Jr. had built after the first landslide. Whether they died in the shelter, or on their way, is a mystery. What is known is that if they’d stayed in the Willey House they likely would have survived.\n\nNews of the Willey Family tragedy spread through newspapers and guidebooks, attracting tourists to the region. People were drawn to the site, captured by the story of what happened, and awed by the survival of the house. Famous authors and poets used the house as a source of inspiration. Nathaniel Hawthorne wrote a short story about the tragedy called The Ambitious Guest. Artists were equally inspired. Thomas Cole, the founder of the Hudson River School of Painting, painted a landscape called Distant View of the Slide that Destroyed the Willey Family. These works of art and literature drew people to the White Mountains like never before – the kinds of people the Willey family were hoping to meet when they first moved to the house.\n\n1948 - Born: Sharon Christa McAuliffe, the eldest of Edward and Grace Corrigan's five children, was born on September 2, 1948, in Framingham, Massachusetts.\n\nWhile in high school, Christa met Steve McAuliffe. Christa attended Framingham State College, majored in history, and received her degree in 1970. That year, she and Steve were married. Soon after, they moved to Washington, D.C., where Steve attended law school. Christa taught school until the birth of her first child, Scott. She then attended Bowie State College and earned a masters degree in school administration in 1978. Shortly thereafter Steve, Christa and Scott moved to Concord, New Hampshire, and Christa's second child, Caroline, was born.\n\nThe McAuliffes settled into an old, three-story house, Steve began his law practice, and Christa stayed home with the children. Christa's love of teaching soon led her back to the classroom. First, Christa taught at Bow Memorial School, and then moved to Concord High School. Christa was also actively involved in the community - church, a tennis club, the local playhouse, the YMCA and Concord Hospital. In addition, she was a Girl Scout leader, a jogger and a swimmer. When the opportunity came to apply to be the first Teacher in Space, everyone who knew Christa told her to \"Go for it!\" She completed the eleven page application, mailed it at the last minute and hoped for the best. After becoming a finalist, Christa did not think she would be chosen. Some of the other teachers were doctors, authors, scholars. . . she was just an ordinary person. However, she was chosen, out of 11,500 applicants.\n\nAn ordinary person - to whom ordinary people could relate - doing the extraordinary. Christa's presence in the space program helped boost public interest and curiosity, and through her participation she became an inspiration to the teaching profession as well. She felt her exposure as the Teacher in Space reflected well on all teachers. Regarding the space program, she said, \"A lot of people thought it was over when we reached the Moon. They put space on the back burner. But people have a connection with teachers. Now that a teacher has been selected, they are starting to watch the launches again.\" Christa began her training at NASA's facility in Houston in September of 1985. At first she was worried that the other astronauts might think she was just along for the ride. She wanted to prove she could work just as hard as they could. But when they met, the other members of the crew treated her as part of the team. Christa trained with them for 114 hours, and when launch time came, she was ready. Just 73 seconds after lift-off, the space shuttle Challenger exploded, killing all seven astronauts aboard. While aboard the shuttle, Christa was to have taught two lessons from space. In one she would have introduced each flight member, explained their roles, shown the cockpit with its 1,300 switches and dials and explained how crew members ate, slept and exercised in microgravity. Her second lesson would have explained how the shuttle flew, discussed why people explore space, and reported on technological advances created by the space program. Throughout her voyage she was to have kept a journal, inspired by the journals of the pioneer women who left their homes in search of a new frontier. Christa said \"That's our new frontier out there, and it's everybody's business to know about space.\" Grace Corrigan, Christa's mother, said in her book A Journal For Christa, \"Christa lived. She never just sat back and existed. Christa always accomplished everything that she was capable of accomplishing. She extended her own limitations. She cared about her fellow human beings. She did the ordinary, but she did it well and unfailingly.\"\n\nOn January 28, 1986, her mission in space ended in tragedy. However, her message continues to speak to us today. Christa's motto was \"I touch the future, I teach\", and she is teaching us still. Christa's mission continues here at the Christa McAuliffe Planetarium which was erected in her memory. The idea for a planetarium was suggested by Louise Wiley, a teacher from Northwood, New Hampshire, and was chosen from among many other ideas because it combined Christa's dream of traveling through space with her dedication to teaching. In April, 1988, the New Hampshire Legislature appropriated funds to build the Planetarium, and ground breaking took place on October 26, 1988. Construction was completed in little more than a year. On June 21, 1990 the Planetarium began its mission to educate, incite and entertain learners of all ages in the sciences and humanities by actively engaging them in the exploration of astronomy and space science. Since then nearly 30,000 school children a year, and thousands of others, have passed through the doors to participate in The Ultimate Field Trip.\n\n1815: Walter A. Wood was born in Mason, New Hampshire on October 23, 1815. His father was a wagon and plow manufacturer. At age one the family moved to Rensselaerville, New York.\n\nDuring his early years, he worked in his father’s shop. At age twenty-one (1836), he moved to Hoosick Falls where he worked as a blacksmith for Parsons & Wilder. He was a blacksmith by trade and became an excellent machinist. After four years he moved to Nashville, Tennessee to work as a carriage maker. (1840) In 1842, he moved back to Hoosick Falls and married Bessie Parsons, daughter of Seth Parsons. Seth Parsons had been his employer from 1836-1840. He and John White operated a small foundry and machine shop under the name of White and Wood. In 1852, he became interested in a reaper patented by John Manny of Illinois. He purchased shop rights for the New York territory. He divided the purchased territory with Chandler Ball and J. Russell Parsons.\n\nWood represented the western part of the state. The other two represented the eastern part of the state. They both started the manufacturing of the reaper in separate shops. In 1860, the Ball and Parsons Reaper Company burned to the ground. Russell Parsons went to work for Wood. Walter A. Wood purchased the Tremont Cotton Factory in 1855 to increase the production of the reaper. In 1852, he built two reapers and by 1858-59 he was producing 5,000 per year. In 1860, the plant was destroyed by fire. He immediately constructed a new plant. In July 1857, the Wood Reaper won first prize by the Syracuse Agricultural Society. In 1861, he patented the “chain rake reaper” that was so unique that it caught the attention of farmers all over the world. A mower was added as well as improvements on all the machines manufactured. By 1865, his reapers and mowers were so successful that financial people became interested in the Wood Company.\n\nIn 1866, the company was organized as a stock company and called the “Walter A. Wood Mowing and Reaper Machine Company.” Walter A. Wood was President, William Tibbets, Vice President and Willard Gay, Treasurer. The second large fire destroyed much of the Wood factory in 1870. They used the Caledonia Mill Building while the factory was being rebuilt. The output of the factory was about 8,000 units during this time. By 1890 the output had increased to approximately 90,000 units. During this time, the reapers and mowers won medals all over the world. (1862: Medal of Merit in England; 1867: Iron and Gold medal in Paris; 1873: medal in Vienna)\n\nThe factory grew continuously and employment grew as Hoosick Falls prospered with the successful plant. His wife Bessie died. They had one child, Lynn P. Wood. In 1868, he married Elizabeth Warren Nicholls and had two children. A boy named Walter, Jr and a girl named Julia. The following is provided by David W Babington Aug, 2007: His second wife's name was Elizabeth Warren Nicholls (spelled commonly now as Nichols), daughter of George Huntington Nicholls (1818, Stratford, CT - 1902, Hoosick Falls, NY) and Julia Louisa Phelps (1818, New York, NY - 1892, Hoosick Falls, NY). Elizabeth Warren Nicholls (Wood) was born 24 Apr 1845 in Hartford, NY.\n\nThe date of the Walter A Wood marriage to Elizabeth Warren Nicholls was 2 Sep 1868 at the St. Mark's Church in Hoosick Falls. I am not sure when Elizabeth Warren Nicholls (Wood) died, but she could have died in Hoosick Falls. In 1873, they built a large mansion modeled after an English castle. Beautiful gardens were located toward the rear and extended to a large pond. The entrance to the mansion had a large metal fence that surrounded the front, which is now the Woods Park without the fence. They owned more than 1,000 acres that extended into East Hoosick. They operated a large farm. Walter A. Wood started the First National Bank of Hoosick Falls.\n\nHe was elected to the House of Representatives in the 46th and 47th Troy district. (1878-1882) He was President of the Board of Education, as well as President of the Village. He was a vestryman at St. Marks Church and was a generous giver to all denominations. Mr. Wood came down with pneumonia and died in 1892 at the age of 77. The factory was shut down and all works lined the streets as his funeral processional passed toward burial. He is buried in the old Maple Grove Cemetery at the back part of the Cemetery\n\n1835: Born - Wheelock V Veazey - Brentwood NH\n\nVeazey received the Medal of Honor for his gallant leadership of the 16th Vermont during the battle. The regiment’s fame continues to this day for repelling Pickett’s Charge.\n\nThe Most Important Day\n\nWheelock Veazey was born Dec. 5, 1835, in Brentwood, N.H., the 10th child of Jonathan Veazey, Jr., and Anne Stevens Veazey.\n\nThe family moved to Exeter, N.H., in 1842. He attended Phillips Academy and, later, Dartmouth College. He was a good student but a prankster who was frequently disciplined. He once painted a portrait of Satan above the pulpit at the college chapel. After graduation he attended Albany Law School for a year and was admitted to the Vermont bar. When war broke out, he left his infant law practice in Springfield, Vt., to enlist.\n\nOn April 22, 1861, he wrote in his diary, This is probably the most important day of my life. May God bless our efforts & the Cause. Before his regiment left for the front, he took time out to marry Julia Beard, daughter of Albin Beard, owner of the Nashua Telegraph. “She seems perfect to me,” he wrote. Eight days after arriving in Virginia, then-Capt. Veazey fought in a skirmish in Lewinsville, Va. He was quickly noticed as a spirited and capable commander whose regiment had complete confidence in him. He was named to the court martial board that ordered the execution of the Sleeping Sentinel, who was later pardoned by President Abraham Lincoln.\n\nFour months after enlisting as a private, Veazey was promoted to lieutenant colonel and helped form the 16th Vermont Regiment. 'The Majority Fell Asleep' He had complained about his troops’ and his own lack of sleep in a letter to his wife. On the third day of the Battle of Gettysburg that, apparently, caught up with them. The rebels opened the fighting that day with a massive bombardment from 140 artillery pieces. Wrote Veazey, My men were lying flat down, and most of the fire with that of our own artillery which was on the crest in our rear passed over us. I lost several men, however, by it. This continued about 2 hours. The effect of this cannonading on my men was the most remarkable ever witnessed in any battle, many of them, I think, the majority fell asleep. It was with the greatest effort only that I could keep awake myself, not withstanding the cries of my wounded men & my anxiety for the more fearful scene which I knew must speedily follow. That fearful scene was Pickett’s Charge, an infantry charge ordered by Gen. Robert E. Lee against Union troops holding a position on Cemetery Ridge. Then all of a sudden the artillery fire slackened.\n\nVeazey’s friend Lt. Joseph Goulding described what happened next: There is a portentious hush and some one with a glass at his eye says: 'there they come,' and just emerging from the rebel lines you can see the long ranks of gray, the shimmer of steel in the July sun as their bayonets glitter above their heads. They are sweeping grandly on and on as they come toward us down the slope. They are in three divisions with a front of about a thousand yards but looking far longer in this smoky air. Now fairly on their way, our fire rekindles and shot and shell tear through their solid masses but the gaps close sternly up and on they come. Their batteries behind them open again over their heads and again the air seems filled with all that kills. They are headed straight for that part of the line where the Vermonters are still hugging the ground and out of sight from the foe who quite naturally suppose them destroyed or paralyzed by the heavy fire to which they have been subjected. Now the gray ranks are almost upon us, their fringe of skirmishers engage ours but are momentarily repulsed while still the heavy charging column comes on nearer and yet nearer. Now within rifle range, their tossing flags wave with their rapid motion as they hurry toward their goal, but just here the long lines of the Thirteenth, Fourteenth and Sixteenth rise as if suddenly grown out of the very earth at their very feet and pour a deadly volley into those closed massed ranks.\n\nThey stagger and break and surge off to the right as they meet it and so expose their flank and out upon that flank changing front forward under the storm of lead as if on parade, Veazey swings the Sixteenth on the left of the Thirteenth...and firing as they advance, pours most terrible and destructive volleys into Pickett's dense column which seems to fairly wither and shrivel under them and this unexpected onslaught.\n\nMajor Gen. Abner Doubleday waved his hat and shouted, \"Glory to God, glory to God, see the Vermonters go at it.\" Afterward, a captured Confedereate soldier said he was never more confident of victory as they marched over the field. \"But when I saw that Damn Vermont Colonel on foot, hat off, sword swinging in the air in front of his men and cheering them on upon our flank, I knew we were doomed.\" Wheelock Veazey won the nation’s highest military honor, the Medal of Honor, for his bravery in battle. He was mustered out on Aug. 10, 1863, in failing health. Once he recovered, Veazey led an illustrious career as Vermont state senator, judge, and member of the Interstate Commerce Commission. Wheelock Veazey died March 22, 1898\n\n1898 - Born: Neil Tillotson- Inventor of the Latex Balloon Neil Tillotson, an industrialist and resort owner who became a celebrity every four years as the first person to vote in the presidential primaries and the election of the president, died Oct. 17, 2001 at a hospital in Colebrook, N.H. He was 102.\n\n''I saw Teddy Roosevelt, I was probably 16, 17 years old, at the fairground in Morrisville, Vt., and he made a speech, and he wasn't just something to read about in the paper,'' Mr. Tillotson once told National Public Radio. That enthralling moment spawned an enduring political spectacle decades later as Mr. Tillotson literally put the polling place of Dixville Notch, N.H., on the map. While running an international rubber products company out of Boston, Mr. Tillotson bought the Balsams Grand Resort Hotel in Dixville Notch at auction in 1954.\n\nHe established a home in that White Mountains community, but learned that the nearest polling place, at the county seat, was 50 miles away. Still intrigued by the presidential drama he had witnessed as a boy, he had Dixville Notch incorporated for voting purposes and created an early-bird election special of sorts. Since the 1960's, the polls at Dixville Notch have opened at midnight for New Hampshire's first-in-the-nation primary and on election days. Voters -- in some years as many as 30 or so -- cast their ballots at the Balsams. At 12:01 a.m., 100 percent of those eligible having voted, the polls close, and the wire services flash the results around the nation. It is participatory democracy in action, but everyone has a good time as well. ''Afterward, we have a little party -- but no booze,'' Mr. Tillotson said.\n\nAs the town moderator, Mr. Tillotson was always the first Dixville Notch resident to place his vote in the wooden box at the Balsams's ballot room. A few other New Hampshire towns have had sporadic midnight voting, but Dixville Notch garners all the attention because the Balsams offers communications facilities for television crews, reporters and photographers. The hoopla over Dixville Notch, in northern New Hampshire, about 220 miles from Boston, has brought presidential hopefuls trooping to Mr. Tillotson. Gov. George W. Bush visited him during New Hampshire's 2000 Republican presidential primary and Senator John McCain paid two calls.\n\nGovernor Bush won 12 votes in Dixville Notch in the Republican primary to Senator McCain's 10. On Election Day, Dixville Notch gave Mr. Bush 21 votes, Vice President Al Gore 5 and Ralph Nader 1. However charming the tableau at Dixville Notch, it is no rustic New England village. It consists almost entirely of the Balsams, a luxurious getaway on Lake Gloriette, and a factory that is part of a rubber company founded by Mr. Tillotson.\n\nMr. Tillotson grew up in Beecher Falls, Vt., quit high school, worked for a rubber company in Watertown, Mass., then served as a teenage cavalryman in Gen. John J. Pershing's Mexican expedition, chasing Pancho Villa. He founded his own rubber company in the early Depression years, at first featuring children's balloons in the shape of a cat, then expanding into an international operation that manufactures industrial products.\n\nIn the 2000 election campaign, he was still active in overseeing the Tillotson Corporation out of offices in Boston. Advertisement He is survived by his wife, Louise; two sons, Rick, of Colebrook, and Tom, of Dixville Notch; two daughters, Neila Tillotson Monahan of Brewster, Mass., and Janet Tillotson Munchak of Roswell, Ga.; and grandchildren, great-grandchildren and great-great-grandchildren.\n\nMr. Tillotson was considered a lifelong Republican, but said he had an open mind in assessing a candidate. ''I think the first thing you look for is honesty,'' he said. ''The next thing is, has he got a brain? And is he emotionally reasonably stable?'' He was hardly overwhelmed by all the excitement over being the first to vote. ''The important thing is, here's a town with, for many elections, 100 percent of the voters voting,'' he said last year. ''That's a lot more important than voting first or last\n\n1697 - Born: Theodore Atkinson in New Castle New Hampshire.\n\nTheodore Atkinson was born in New Castle, New Hampshire, on December 20, 1697, the son of Mary and Theodore Atkinson (1669–1719), a provincial councilor.1 Atkinson attended Harvard College with the class of 1718. Shortly after graduating, he received a commission as lieutenant of Fort William and Mary in New Castle, a position his father had occupied. In 1720 he was appointed clerk of the Court of Common Pleas, and by 1731 he was admitted as an attorney.\n\nIn 1722, Atkinson was elected a representative to the General Court. Lieutenant Governor John Wentworth, who had been a close associate of Atkinson’s father, appointed the younger Theodore collector, naval officer, and sheriff of the province. During these years, New Hampshire was a royal province controlled from a distance by the governor of Massachusetts and, locally, by the lieutenant governor.\n\nThe tension between the local and distant authorities resulted in a political rivalry between Massachusetts Governor Jonathan Belcher and New Hampshire Lieutenant Governor Wentworth. Consequently Belcher removed Atkinson from the first two positions and appointed another man to share the office of sheriff. Atkinson was appointed in 1732 councilor of New Hampshire, but Belcher stalled his appointment for two years. When John Wentworth died in 1730, his son Benning (1696–1770) rose to power in his place and became the first royally appointed governor of New Hamsphire.\n\nAtkinson and the younger Wentworth remained political allies, and the two men dominated New Hampshire politics over the next generation. Atkinson was chosen secretary of the province in 1741, and passed the office to his son, Theodore, Jr., in 1760. Upon his son’s death in 1769, Atkinson resumed the office until 1775. He also served as clerk of the council and was promoted to colonel in the New Hampshire militia. In that capacity, he commanded one of ten New Hampshire regiments in the French and Indian War. In 1754, Atkinson was a delegate to the Albany Congress, which existed to form an alliance between the British colonies and the Iroquois tribes of the Six Nations.\n\nThe committee ultimately presented a plan of union among the colonies to facilitate their defense, but both the king and the colonial governments rejected it.2 Later that year, Atkinson was appointed chief justice of the Superior Court and remained in that office until the Revolutionary government was formed in 1775. In 1773 he was promoted to major general. Then Atkinson’s power began to wane, as did that of the royally sanctioned government in general. In December 1774, he confronted a crowd threatening to seize Fort William and Mary, declaring that failure to disband would constitute an Act of High Treason and Rebellion. But instead of being obeyed, Atkinson was mocked.4 When he refused, in July 1775, to turn over the records of the province to the Revolutionary government in Exeter, and the documents were seized from him. Curiously, Atkinson was not named in 1778 among the Loyalists whose land the patriots confiscated, despite the elder statesman’s unambiguous political allegiance to the Crown. Close associates such as Benning and John Wentworth, on the other hand, were individually named in acts passed by the Revolutionary government of New Hampshire as \"enemys\" of the state, and their property was seized. Atkinson built a fortune in land investment.\n\nIn 1719 he inherited a substantial sum, amounting to 1,200 pounds, from his father’s estate. In the mid-1730s, he moved to Portsmouth, where he helped establish an Anglican church—Queen’s Chapel, later renamed St. John’s—and was a warden of the Masons. In 1754 he gave land to the church for building tombs, Vaults & Monuments.6 He expanded his wealth as one of the principal investors in 1739 in the Masonian Proprietorship, which was based on a seventeenth-century land grant of all the property within sixty miles of the New Hampshire coast, including Portsmouth, Dover, and Exeter. That corporation’s success hinged upon the resolution of an ongoing boundary dispute between Massachusetts and New Hampshire, which was settled in 1741 in favor of Atkinson’s province and investment.\n\nInhabitants of the towns established within the proprietorship were granted title to the land they had improved.7 Atkinson and his son also held seventy-three proprietorships in the contested land to the west of New Hampshire, which would later become Vermont.8 The town of Atkinson, New Hampshire, founded in 1767, was named for him.9 Atkinson’s taste for display prompted him not only to have his and his wife’s portraits painted by Joseph Blackburn but also to build a grand house on Court Street in Portsmouth. This residence contained a substantial amount of silver, including a tray engraved with birth and death dates of family members and friends.10 Atkinson apparently owned the finest carriage in town and once challenged another man to a sulky race from Portsmouth to Boston.\n\nHis interest in sport is suggested by the dedication of the Reverend Joseph Seccombe’s so-called fishing sermon to him. On September 4, 1732, Atkinson married the widow Hannah Plaisted (1700–1769), daughter of his late political benefactor John Wentworth. This union added 1,000 thousand pounds to Atkinson’s wealth and further solidified his ties to the Wentworth family.\n\nTheir children Hannah, who was baptized 1734 and died young, and Theodore (1737–1769)—both predeceased their parents.12 When Atkinson, who had no immediate heirs, died in Portsmouth on September 22, 1779, he left the bulk of his fortune to a cousin, George King, on the condition that he change his name to Atkinson.\n\nHe also left 200 pounds to the Anglican church he helped found in Portsmouth for the distribution of bread to the poor on Sundays. In addition, Atkinson’s will included bequests of 100 pounds apiece to the libraries of Harvard and Dartmouth College; he had been appointed a trustee of the latter school in 1769. He specified that Harvard spend the funds for books \"usefull in the Study of the Civil—Statute—& Common Law of England.\" And the books purchased by both colleges were to be impressed with Atkinson’s initials in gold letters on the binding."
