        "text": "Alan Shepard was born on November 18, 1923, in East Derry, New Hampshire, a small village a few miles south of Manchester.\n\nHe was the son of an army colonel. As a small child, Shepard attended school in a one-room schoolhouse, where he was a good student, particularly in mathematics. He graduated from the Pinkerton Academy in Derry, New Hampshire, and entered the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, in 1941. During World War II, Shepard served as an ensign aboard the destroyer Cogswell in the Pacific. Following the war, he began flight training and qualified as a pilot in 1947.\n\nAs a Naval pilot, Shepard served in Norfolk, Virginia, Jacksonville, Florida, and aboard several aircraft carriers in the Mediterranean. In 1950, he became a test pilot, and over the next eight years he tested a variety of aircraft and worked as a flight instructor. He was also assigned to duty aboard a carrier in the Pacific and eventually earned an appointment to the staff of the Atlantic fleet's commander in chief. One of the First Astronauts In 1958, Shepard was one of 110 test pilots chosen by NASA as prospective astronauts. NASA planned to judge the applicants based on physical and mental criteria, looking, as NASA administrator T. Keith Glennan stated, for \"men of vision … with a practical, hardheaded approach to the difficult job ahead.\" After a battery of physical and psychological tests, seven men were selected as the nation's first astronauts: John Glenn, M. Scott Carpenter, Virgil Grissom, Donald Slayton, Leroy Cooper, Walter Schirra, and Alan Shepard.\n\nFollowing the announcement Shepard said, \"My feelings about being in this program are really quite simple….I'm here because it's a chance to serve the country. I'm here, too, because it's a great personal challenge: I know [space travel] can be done, that it's important for it to be done, and I want to do it.\" Shepard began intensive training for space flight. Courses in biology, geography, astrophysics, astronomy, and meteorology supplemented his physical training, which included exposure to conditions much more severe than were anticipated during space travel. Shepard also spent long hours performing weightlessness tests, preparing for the weaker gravitational pull outside the earth's atmosphere. First American in Space Early in 1961, NASA chose Shepard over Glenn and Grissom, the two other finalists, to be the first American in space. The astronauts themselves had attempted to downplay the importance of the selection of the first astronaut. John Glenn said, \"We have tried to do away with a lot of this talk about who is going to be first on this, because we feel very strongly that this is so much bigger than whose name happens to be on the first ticket.\" Preparations for America's first manned space flight therefore commenced in a spirit of cooperation. Glenn acted as Shepard's backup, ready if Shepard became unable to fly, and Slayton served as Shepard's radio contact at the Mercury Control Center. The other astronauts also had responsibilities during Shepard's flight. On May 5, 1961, Freedom 7 lifted off from Cape Canaveral, Florida. Shepard piloted the Mercury capsule 115 miles above the earth's surface and 302 miles across the Atlantic Ocean. After landing safely in the Atlantic, Shepard was picked up from the water by helicopter pilot; his first words were, \"Man, what a ride!\" Although the trip lasted for only about fifteen minutes, Shepard's journey was almost technically perfect, and it paved the way for many more flights by U.S. astronauts. Shepard returned to ticker-tape parades, and he received a medal from President John F. Kennedy. After his historic flight Shepard looked forward to future missions.\n\nIn 1963, however, he was diagnosed as having Meniere's syndrome, a disease of the inner ear that produces nausea, vertigo, and hearing impairment. NASA removed Shepard from active flight duty and reassigned him to NASA's Houston, Texas, facility, where he became chief of the Astronaut Office. Although he became quite wealthy as a result of real estate and banking investments during the next few years, he yearned for space flight. In 1968, he underwent a successful operation in which a small drain tube was implanted in his inner ear. Shepard applied for readmission to active duty, and in 1969 his patience and determination were rewarded when NASA chose him to command the Apollo 14 flight to the moon. \"I think if a person wants something badly enough,\" Shepard once said, \"he's just got to hang in there and keep at it.\" Went to the Moon Apollo 14 became an important mission for the U.S. space program. Apollo 13 had been a disappointment; technical difficulties had prevented it from landing on the moon as planned and placed the astronauts in danger, and the space program was losing public support. The Apollo 14 astronauts were scheduled to test new equipment on the moon's surface and to spend longer periods outside the space capsule. Shepard and Edwin Mitchell were assigned to land on the moon while Stuart Roosa orbited the moon in the command module, the Kitty Hawk On January 31, 1971, Apollo 14 blasted off from Cape Kennedy, nearly ten years after Shepard's first space flight. Five days later Shepard and Mitchell landed on the moon's surface, the third group of astronauts to do so. From their lunar module, the two astronauts stepped out into the Fra Mauro Highlands, as the world watched on television. Shepard said, \"Wow, it's really wild up here…. It certainly is a stark place.\" The astronauts had brought a lunar cart with them, and during two trips outside the lunar module, each lasting more than four and a half hours, they conducted experiments and gathered rock specimens. On one excursion Shepard hit a golf ball across the moon's surface. In addition, the astronauts left behind a multi-million dollar mini-scientific station that would continue to send messages to scientists on earth. Thirty-three and a half hours after they landed, the two astronauts completed a successful docking with Kitty Hawk. The 240,000-mile journey back to earth ended with a splash-down near Samoa in the South Pacific on February 9. By all accounts, the voyage was a big success.\n\nImmortalized in The Right Stuff The story of the 1961 flight was immortalized in a book by Tom Wolfe and 1983 movie, both titled The Right Stuff. Both the movie and the book found a sizable audience, but Shepard wasn't that impressed, as he told Publisher's Weekly. \"Wolfe never talked to any of us original seven guys. His book was based on hearsay, on what he got from second generation astronauts. The story line was good, but the characterizations left a little to be desired.\" Shepard and Deke Slayton, another former astronaut, sought to set the story straight when they contracted to write their own account of the Mercury, Gemini and Apollo programs, tentatively titled Giant Steps: The Inside Story of the American Space Program. \"The other books written about the space program have been may be more like stories by engineers than by reporters,\" Shepard told Publisher's Weekly. \"Ours has a little more drama.\" Asked why he had waited until the mid-1990s to tell his story, he told Publisher's Weekly,\"It's been in the back of my mind, but I've been busy with other things until now, until these guys came to me.\" Shepard retired from NASA in 1974. Always a successful entrepreneur, he developed a wholesale beer distributorship and a real estate firm in the Houston area. Shrewd investments in horses, banks, oil, and real estate have made him a multimillionaire. He has been married for over 40 years and has two daughters, lives in Houston and chairs the board of the Mercury 7 Foundation, the original astronauts' educational organization. Although no longer active in the space program, Alan Shepard will be remembered both as the first American in space and as one of a handful of men to walk on the moon. Shepard, Alan American Astronaut 1923-1998 Alan Bartlett Shepard Jr. was America's first human in space and the fifth of only twelve men to walk on the Moon. His combination of professionalism and impish sense of humor vaulted him to the status of space hero, and he became a symbol of perseverance to the world. A graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy, test pilot, and flight instructor, Shepard was selected as one of the original seven Mercury astronauts. At the age of thirty-seven, he was launched atop a Redstone rocket, May 5, 1961. The tiny Mercury capsule soared to an altitude of 116 miles (187 kilometers). The 15-minute sub-orbital flight demonstrated that a human could survive and function in the weightlessness of space.\n\nThe success of Shepard's mission inspired U.S. President John F. Kennedy's challenge to the nation to land men on the Moon by the end of the decade. After an ear problem grounded Shepard for many years, he finally returned to space as commander of Apollo 14 in 1971 aboard the giant Saturn V Moon rocket, 111-meters (363-feet) high compared to his 83-foot (25-meter) Redstone, bringing back 43 kilograms (94 pounds) of Moon rocks. Shepard left behind two golf balls hit with a cleverly devised golf club. Alan Shepard died July 22, 1998 from leukemia.\n\nHon. William D. Swart, President of the Senate, was born in New Kingston, New York, July 9, 1856, son of William R. and Eliza (Dumond) Swart. His ancestors on both sides came from Holland and were among the first European settlers of New York state, locating at and near Kingston on the Hudson River. His great-grandfather, son of Samuel Swart, lost his entire possessions at the time the British burned the city of Kingston, during the Revolutionary War, and his grandfather, Samuel Swart, served throughout the War of 1812 with honor and distinction. On the maternal side he traces his ancestry back nine generations to Walerandt Du Mont, who married in Kingston, January 13, 1664, Margaret Hendrick, and who was at that time serving on the staff of the Noble Lord Director, General Stuyvesant, in the Netherlandish service, stationed at Kingston, N. Y. William Dumond Swart was educated in the public schools of Margaretville and at the Wesleyan Academy at Wilbraham, Mass., finishing at the age of eighteen. After leaving school, he was in the employ of Evans, Peak, & Co., of New York City, wholesale dry goods merchants, for five years; and with Bates, Reed and Cooley . in the same business, two years. In 1880, he engaged in the decorative art business which he carried on successfully in Newark, N. J., for seven years. After spending two years in travel in this country, he located in Nashua, in this state, in February, 1890, going into the retail lumber business with Charles A. Roby, under the firm name of Roby & Swart. Two years later the firm purchased the edge tool works in the same city and added a wood working plant. In 1894 the retail business was consolidated with F. D. Cook & Co., Roby & Swart retaining the manufacturing and wholesale business under the name of Roby & Swart Manufacturing Co. Mr. Swart is a director in the former company and director and treasurer in the latter. He is also a director and president of the Nashua Machine Company; director and vice-president of the Nashua Trust Company; director and president of the Londonderry Spring Water Company; director and treasurer of Nashua Building Company; director and treasurer of the Nashua Paper Box Company; director and treasurer of the American Box & Lumber Company. In 1893 to 1895, and again in 1907 and 1908 he was president of the Board of Trade. He was a member of the Common Council from 1893 to 1895, being president for two years. He was appointed aide with the rank of colonel on Governor Ramsdell's staff in 1897. He is a Congregationalist in religion; a thirty-second degree Mason and a member of Rising Sun Lodge, Free and Accepted Masons, Aaron P. Hughes Council, St. George Chapter, and Commandery of the E. A. Raymond Consistory and of the Aaron P. Hughes Lodge of Perfection Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rites, also a member of Bektash Temple, order of the Mystic Shrine. In politics, Mr. Swart has always been a Republican, and has filled various offices in the Nashua city government. He was elected from Ward 1 as Representative to the General Court for 1909-10, serving as a member of the Committee on Banks and as chairman of the Committee on State Prison, and as Senator from the nineteenth district for 1911-12, of which honorable body he was chosen president. He married October 7, 1890, Lizzie A., daughter of Luther A. Roby of Nashua. They have two children, Elizabeth and William Roby Swart. President Swart demonstrated his absolute independence of partisan bias so far as the administration of his office is concerned, by assigning each of the eight Democratic Senators to a committee chairmanship at the opening of the session, and in pre siding over the deliberations of the Senate his action has invariably been characterized by courtesy, fairness and impartiality.\n\nMatthew Thornton was born in Lisburn, County Antrim, Ireland on March 3, 1714 of Scotch-Irish parents, James Thornton and Elizabeth Jenkins. When he was three years old, his family emigrated to America, settling first in what would become the state of Maine.\n\nIn 1722, Indians attacked the Maine settlement in the vicinity of Brunswick (or possibly Wiscasset) where they lived. James Thornton, his wife Elizabeth, and their 8 year old son Matthew, escaped from their burning home by canoe, paddled out to Casco Bay, and proceeded from there to the Scotch-Irish town of Worcester, Massachusetts. There Thornton grew up receiving a classical education at Worcester Academy.\n\nYoung Thornton pursued medical studies in Leicester, Massachusetts under the direction of Doctor Grout, a relative. In 1740, at the age of 26, he began what became a thriving medical practice in the Scotch-Irish town of Londonderry, New Hampshire. He soon became distinguished, both as a physician and a surgeon.\n\nIn 1745, at the age of 31, Dr. Thornton served as a surgeon in the New Hampshire militia during King George’s War (1745-48). He accompanied Sir William Pepperell in the British expedition that captured Louisburg, the French fortress in Nova Scotia.\n\nDr. Thornton was elected a delegate for Londonderry to the colonial assembly in 1758, and began to figure prominently in colonial affairs.\n\nHe married Hannah Jack in 1760 and they had five children. Hannah’s parents were Andrew Jack and Mary Morrison, both of Scotch-Irish descent. Hannah Jack was born in 1742 and died on December 5, 1786.\n\nIn 1765, Thornton was prominent in the agitation against the Stamp Act in New Hampshire, but later held a commission as Colonel of militia under Royal Governor Wentworth.\n\nIn 1775 Dr. Thornton denounced the “unconstitutional and tyrannical Acts of the British Parliament”, and was elected President of the New Hampshire Provincial Congress when Royal Governor Wentworth fled from the Colony and boarded a British warship in Portsmouth. Thornton was also appointed Chairman of the provincial committee of safety in charge of raising troops and arms.\n\nUpon taking office, Thornton issued a statement to the citizens of New Hampshire, and this is part of what he said: “Friends and brethren, you must all be sensible that the affairs of America have, at length, come to a very affecting and alarming crisis. The horrors and distresses of a civil war, which, till of late, we only had in contemplation, we now find ourselves obliged to realize. Painful beyond expression, have been those scenes of blood and devastation which the barbarous cruelty of British troops have placed before our eyes. Duty to God, to ourselves, to posterity, ends forced by the cries of slaughtered innocents, have urged us to take up arms in our own defence….we seriously and earnestly recommend the practice of that pure and undefiled religion, which embalmed the memory of our pious ancestors, as that alone upon which we can build a solid hope and confidence in the Divine protection and favour, without whose blessing all the measures of safety we have, or can propose, will end in our shame and disappointment.”\n\nDr. Thornton was President of the five man committee that drafted the first state constitution, and it was adopted on January 5, 1776, the first of the thirteen states to establish a constitution. Thornton was then elected to the new state legislature and elected Speaker of that assembly.\n\nIn September 1776, Dr. Thornton, at the age of 62, was chosen a delegate to the Continental Congress, and took his seat on the 4th of November 1776. Although Thornton was not present during the debates on independence or when 50 of the delegates signed the Declaration on August 2, he became one of six signers who did so in the following months. All six of these signers fully supported the sentiments in the document, and were permitted to affix their signatures to the engrossed copy of the Declaration of Independence.\n\nDespite having no legal education, Thornton served as chief justice of the Court of Common Pleas, the superior court of New Hampshire, from 1776 until 1782. After serving in the Continental Congress for only a little over a year, he left Congress and resumed his duties as associate justice of the Superior Court. In his seventies he served in the New Hampshire State senate from 1784 until 1786.\n\nIn 1780, he purchased a farm on the banks of the Merrimac River, near Exeter, where he devoted himself to the business of agriculture. He spent his last years farming and operating a ferry—Lutwyche’s (later Thornton’s) Ferry—across the Merrimac River. The house and ferry he purchased had been confiscated from a prominent Tory—Edward Gladstone Lutwyche.\n\nAlthough often exposed to the whooping cough, Thornton did not catch the disease until he passed his eightieth year, and he survived the attack. He continued to write essays and letters to newspapers on various topics well into his eighties, including an unpublished work on the metaphysical origins of sin.\n\nDr. Thornton exceeded six feet in height; his complexion was dark and his eyes black and piercing. At the age of 61 he was described as tall, clear-eyed, handsome and charming.\n\nHe was described as a man of strong powers of mind, and on most subjects to which he directed his attention, was able to elicit light and information. In private life, he was peculiarly instructive and agreeable. The young were delighted with his hilarity and humor. His memory was well stored with entertaining and instructive anecdotes, which he was able to apply upon any incident or subject of conversation. He often illustrated his sentiments by fable. He delighted to amuse a circle of an evening by some fictitious narrative, in which he greatly excelled. At such times, placing his elbows upon his knees, and supporting his head with his hands, he would rivet the attention of his auditors, and astonish them by his powers of invention. In satire he was scarcely equaled. And although he sometimes employed his power immoderately, he was universally beloved, and occupied a large share of the confidence of his neighbors.\n\nThornton died while visiting his daughter in Newburyport, Massachusetts on the 24th of June, 1803, at the age of 89. His original gravestone was inscribed, “An Honest Man.” On May 22, 1892, New Hampshire dedicated a monument honoring Thornton’s memory located at the entrance to the Thornton Ferry Cemetery in Merrimack, New Hampshire, where he is buried.\n\nDavid Andrew Warde, Henniker NH (Feb 1, 1828) became a notable instance of a self-made man, fighting the battles of life bravely after the age of thirteen, when he obtained a brief academic education at Hopkinton, under the instruction of Prof. Ballard. At the age of fifteen, he went to Concord and found employment in an eating-saloon, which business he followed but a few months. Locking the saloon, upon the last night of his engagement, and handing the key to the proprietor, he said, “I will never sell another glass of liquor while I live: I shall seek new business to-morrow.” He immediately entered the hardware store of Porter & Rolfe, of Concord, where he remained until March, 1852, when, in company with a partner, he became the owner of the stock of the store where he had been employed, the partnership lasting until 1855, when it was dissolved. Mr. Warde continued in business alone until 1858, when he became associated with an intimate friend, who survived him in the business. As the head of this business house, Mr. Warde achieved an enviable reputation as a business man, and was widely known, not only in this but in other states, as an active and enterprising man, who achieved success by industry and well-directed application. He represented Ward 5, Concord, in the legislatures of 1867 and 1868, and his senatorial district in the years 1872 and 1873, the last year serving as president of the senate with marked abil ity. He was one of the water commissioners of Con cord several years. He was ever foremost with his aid in every movement that tended for the public welfare. Mr. Warde married, Nov. 12, 1852, Martha, daughter of Perley Cleaves, of Concord. His domestic relations were of the happiest character, he being a kind, indul gent, and thoughtful husband, father, and neighbor. He died Thursday, May 14, 1874, of pneumonia, having been ill but nine days. His funeral was largely attend ed, some of the most prominent gentlemen in the state being present; and, as a mark of the high esteem in which he was held, all places of business were closed during the solemn ceremonies of his burial. He was followed to his last resting-place by a long line of friends, and his remains were tenderly laid to rest, with the choicest flowers around them and the opening spring verdure above them, typical of the life immortal that awaits those who sleep well “after life's fitful fever.” Mr. Warde became a member of the First Baptist church in Concord, in 1852, and was ever after an upright and devoted Christian. He was also a member of Eureka Lodge and Trinity Chapter of Masons. He reflected much honor on the town that sent him forth ; and in his death his native town, as well as his adopted city and the state, suffered a great loss.\n\nWentworth was born in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, on August 9, 1737.[1] His ancestry went back to some of the earliest settlers of the Province of New Hampshire, and he was grandson of John Wentworth, who served as the province's lieutenant governor in the 1720s, a nephew to Governor Benning Wentworth,[2] and a descendant of \"Elder\" William Wentworth. His father Mark was a major landowner and merchant in the province, and his mother, Elizabeth Rindge Wentworth, was also from the upper echelons of New Hampshire society.[3] In 1751, he enrolled in Harvard College, receiving a bachelor's degree in 1755 and a master's degree in 1758.[4] During his time at Harvard, he was a classmate and became a close friend of future Founding Father and President of the United States John Adams.[5]\n\nIn 1759, the young Wentworth made his first significant investment, joining a partnership in the purchase and development of land in the Lake Winnipesaukee area. Wentworth sat on a committee of partners that oversaw the settlement of the community, which the investors named Wolfeboro. In 1763, his father sent him to London to act on behalf of his merchant interests. Based on his father's introductions, he was soon mingling with the upper levels of British society. Among the connections he made was one with the Marquess of Rockingham, a distant relative (although neither was apparently aware of this) and a leading Whig politician. In 1765, Wentworth, still in London, was appointed by the province as one of its agents. That same year Rockingham became Prime Minister and led the repeal of the hated Stamp Act. Whether Wentworth influenced Rockingham's decision is uncertain, but New Hampshire's other agent, Barlow Trecothick, drafted with Rockingham a position paper on the matter, and Wentworth was clearly sympathetic to colonial opposition to the Stamp Act.\n\nWentworth's uncle Benning had spent many years of his governorship lining his pockets by selling land grants to the west of the Connecticut River, territory to which the province held dubious claim. In 1764, the Lords of Trade ruled that New Hampshire's western border was at the Connecticut River, decisively awarding the territory (the future state of Vermont) to the Province of New York. The governor, however, refused to resign, leading the Lords of Trade to consider his recall. Wentworth interceded, and convinced them to allow his uncle the dignity of resigning in his nephew's favor.\n\nIn August 1766, he was commissioned as Governor and vice admiral of New Hampshire, and Surveyor General of the King's Woods in North America. Before he returned to North America he was awarded a Doctorate of Common Law by Oxford University. After a difficult crossing he arrived at Charleston, South Carolina in March 1767, where he proceeded to make the first major survey of the forests of Georgia and the Carolinas on behalf of the crown.[6] He then made his way north overland, and was received in Portsmouth with pomp and ceremony on June 13, 1767.\n\nNew Hampshire Colonial Governor. Born into a New Hampshire family of wealth and position, he attended Harvard College and by 1758 had received both a bachelor and masters degree. He became Governor of New Hampshire in 1766. As a loyalist during the American Revolution, Wentworth was forced to flee to New York City in 1776, and to England in 1778. His property and possessions were seized by the government that was established upon his departure. From the mid-1780s Wentworth lived in Halifax, Nova Scotia, and served as Lieutenant Governor of Nova Scotia from 1792 until his retirement in 1808. During his service he was knighted and awarded a baronetcy in 1795. Wentworth was buried in the crypt beneath St. Paul's Church in Halifax, where a tablet exists to his memory."
