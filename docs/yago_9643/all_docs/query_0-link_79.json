You won't forget The Slaughtered Lamb, the Nazi/Muppet dream sequence, or Brenda Bristols in a hurry...\n\n​\n\nAN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN PARIS (Anthony Waller 1997) - delayed and disappointing sequel to the Landis hit, from the director of the promising MUTE WITNESS.

(Steve Oram 2015) - absurdist fantasy set in a world where human beings act and converse in the manner of apes.

Adopted woman returns to her Russian homeland, but steps into a nightmare where she and everyone around her seem to be under attack from threatening doppelgangers.

An expansion of the BAFTA-nominated short film ZOMBIE MUSICAL.\n\n​\n\nANNIHILATION (Alex Garland 2018) - US/UK production which had a brief theatrical release in some parts of the world but was mainly seen via Netflix. Natalie Portman and Jennifer Jason Leigh star in this rather ponderous and pretentious offering, in which a team of scientists investigate 'the Shimmer', a mysterious zone containing mutated plants and animals.\n\n​\n\nAPOSTLE (Gareth Evans 2018) - period horror piece from the director of the RAID films.

Bazzer and his auntie, Edna Everage, meet Donald Pleasence as Count Plasma, Transylvanian bloodsucker. Gross, totally offensive, and one of the funniest movies you'll ever see. Just how much lager does Clive James consume during the course of this film?\n\n​\n\nTHE BEAST IN THE CELLAR (James Kelly 1970) - Beryl Reid and Flora Robson add some real class to this rural shocker.\n\n​\n\nTHE BEAST MUST DIE (Paul Annett 1974) - clever opening sequence, and of course the William Castle-style 'werewolf break', identify this so-so Amicus stab at lycanthropy.\n\n​\n\nTHE BEETLE (Alexander Butler 1919) - early silent feature - soul of an Egyptian princess, seeking vengeance against a British M.P., possesses the title creature.\n\n​\n\nBEG!

Keith Allen impresses as a low-rent Hannibal Lecter, Liz Hurley is o.k. as the heroine, but as for one-time soap star Anita Dobson, oh dear...\n\n​\n\nBIZARRE (Antony Balch 1970) - weird sex/horror anthology, narrated by a mummy with the voice of Valentine Dyall; vignettes include a photographer using instrument of torture 'the Spanish Horse', a scientist giving birth to a monster, and a gardener who cultivates human souls.\n\n​\n\nTHE BLACK PANTHER (Ian Merrick 1977) - ripped-from-yesterday's-headlines account of the Lesley Whittle kidnap case, handled with commendable sensitivity by scripter Michael Armstrong.\n\n​\n\nBLACK RAINBOW (Mike Hodges 1989) - supernatural thriller shot in North Carolina for Britain's Goldcrest Films.

Low-budget Scottish shocker, shot on 16mm and unreleased for several years. (At one point the rights for the movie appeared to have been successfully sold to American distributors, but they turned out to be a bunch of religious cranks who specialise in purchasing 'satanic' films and then destroying them...)\n\nBLOOD OF FU MANCHU (Jess Franco 1968) - Christopher Lee back behind the droopy moustache for one of two cheapo instalments lensed by the prolific Spaniard Franco.\n\n​\n\nBLOOD OF THE VAMPIRE (Henry Cass 1958) - Donald Wolfit in substandard attempt to imitate the Hammer style.\n\n​\n\nBLOOD ON SATAN'S CLAW (Piers Haggard 1970) - Linda Hayden leads a bunch of juvenile devil worshippers in this fan favourite; similar old-time setting, and atmosphere, to WITCHFINDER GENERAL.\n\n​\n\nBLOOD TIDE (Richard Jeffries 1980) - Anglo-Greek production pitting James Earl Jones against a legendary sea monster.\n\n​\n\nBLOODBATH AT THE HOUSE OF DEATH (Ray Cameron 1983) - great opening scene as cowled monks slaughter their way through the corridors of 'Headstone Manor', but it's downhill thereafter in this misguided vehicle for madcap d.j. Kenny Everett. Vincent Price is wasted as 'The Sinister Man'.\n\nBLOODSTREAM (Michael J. Murphy 1985) - From the director of INVITATION TO HELL and THE LAST NIGHT, this was Murphy’s attempt to consciously make a ‘video nasty’! “I had been badly treated by distributors and took my revenge by making a film about them and their family members being murdered in the most vile ways possible... even burnt their pet dog” - Murphy, quoted at www.zone-sf.com in an interview with Paul Higson.\n\n​\n\nBLOODY NEW YEAR (Norman J.Warren 1986) - deserted island hotel, somehow stuck in the year 1959, is the focus for weirdness and horror. Mixes some clever original ideas with rip-offs of contemporary Hollywood terror hits.\n\n​\n\nBLUE BLOOD (Andrew Sinclair 1973) - Oliver Reed usurps his master's position as head of a country estate in this exploitation revamp of THE SERVANT, with stray satanist touches designed to appeal to the horror crowd.\n\n​\n\nBLUE FEAR (Darren Ward 1994) - home-made 'giallo'-style thriller, distributed via mail order video sales. Witness to a drug-related murder suspects the killer is someone close to them. Ward's \"Giallo Films\" also produced PAURA IL DIAVOLO, another Italian-influenced item, and 1995 gunplay/action offering BITTER VENGEANCE.\n\nTHE BODY BENEATH (Andy Milligan 1970) - U.K.-produced vampire movie from Milligan, New York’s king of no-budget horror.\n\n​\n\nTHE BODY STEALERS (Gerry Levy 1969) - Tigon quickie - parachutists abducted during descent are being replaced by aliens.\n\n​\n\nBORN OF FIRE (Jamil Dehlavi 1987) - Peter Firth stars as a flautist who discovers that music is about to cause the destruction of the Earth. Dismal apocalyptic fantasy, made for Channel 4. Saving grace - some of the most gorgeous locations you'll ever see in a movie. Nice travelogue, shame about the film.\n\n​\n\nBOY MEETS GIRL (Ray Brady 1994) - controversial, three-hander torture drama which caused a stir among genre fans, not to mention at the offices of the BBFC!\n\n​\n\nTHE BOYS FROM BRAZIL (Franklin J.Schaffner 1978) - from Ira Levin's novel; Dr.Josef Mengele experiments in creating clones of Adolf Hitler. Among the glitzy, big-name cast (Olivier, Peck, Mason) you'll also find those ubiquitous Britsploitation greats Michael Gough and Linda Hayden.\n\n​\n\nBREEDERS (Paul Matthews 1997) - More monster mayhem shot in the U.K. for the American market – originally intended as a sequel to GRIM, though the eventual production has no connection to Matthews’ earlier film. Features familiar t.v. face Samantha Janus.\n\n​\n\nTHE BRIDE (Franc Roddam 1985) - Sting and Jennifer Beals in an ill-advised, would-be 'sequel' to the classic BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN.\n\n​\n\nTHE BRIDES OF DRACULA (Terence Fisher 1960) - Peter Cushing returns as Van Helsing, to combat the vampiric Baron Meinster (David Peel). Hammer horror at its finest, with classic scenes galore - perhaps most notably, Van Helsing himself tainted by the vampire's bite...\n\n​\n\nTHE BRIDES OF FU MANCHU (Don Sharp 1966) - second in the series featuring Christopher Lee as the evil Oriental mastermind.\n\n​\n\nBRITANNIA HOSPITAL (Lindsay Anderson 1982) - vicious political satire, swiping at the government, bureaucracy, and the unions in equal measure. Third of the 'Mick Travis' trilogy (following IF.... and O LUCKY MAN!); major subplot has mad scientist Graham Crowden and his research team attempting to construct Frankenstein-type monster, leading to some excessively gory scenes in the lab!\n\nBUNNY LAKE IS MISSING (Otto Preminger 1965) - young mother seeking her missing child in London finds no-one will even admit to her daughter's existence. Satisfying psychological mystery with a good psycho role for Keir Dullea and a scene-stealing show from Noel Coward.\n\n​\n\nBURKE AND HARE (Vernon Sewell 1971) - semi-comic re-telling of the bodysnatchers' saga.\n\nBUTTERFLY KISS (Michael Winterbottom 1994) - body-pierced psychotic and her willing partner-in-crime travel up and down Britain’s motorways murdering truckers and travelling salesmen. One of the decade’s few genuinely evocative, truly British shockers. Starring Amanda Plummer and Saskia Reeves.\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\nPost-2000\n\nBAD MOON RISING (Alasdair MacKay 2021) - Dani Thompson stars in this story of a reality-TV ghost hunting team who get more than they bargained for.\n\n​\n\nTHE BAD NUN (Scott Jeffrey 2018) - originally entitled THE WATCHER, this Rebecca Matthews production is a typical quickie slasher affair, with Matthews herself (as 'Becca Hirani') as a young woman staying at a B&B who has to deal with a persistent nun knocking at the door - but is the nun all they seem? Obviously, this was packaged to look like it had something to do with Blumhouse's hit from around the same period...\n\nBAD PLACE (Darren Winter 2003) - \"thirty-somethings come up against the ghost of a child-murderer in an haunted house\" - 73-minute DV feature made on the Isle Of Wight. Ref: Paul Higson\n\n​\n\nBANE (James Eaves 2008) - \"A woman awakes in a cell with three others to find she is part of a horrible experiment\"\n\n​\n\nBANNISTER DOLLHOUSE (MJ Dixon 2019) - Mycho Entertainment Group offering, connected to their earlier SLASHER HOUSE 2. \"After the death of their eldest sister the women of the Bannister family begin to feel that something is very wrong, Molly is getting sick, there are strange noises in the night, a constant feeling that they are being watched and what's with that doll, that seems to be everywhere they go? How is it connected to them and how will they survive the nightmare that is the Bannister DollHouse?\"\n\nBANSHEE (Ben Cobb 2003) - gory, hour-long shocker “about a cursed beauty”, screened at various British film festivals. Supposedly inspired by the work of Herschell Gordon Lewis. (Ref: Paul Higson)\n\n​\n\nTHE BARBER (Michael Bafaro 2001) - disturbing horror-drama set in Alaska, starring Malcolm McDowell.

Publicity blurb: \"Two young women arrive at a curious penthouse apartment, led by one's crush on her tutor. However, her love interest doesn't live alone. He's part of a trio of computer hackers about to embark on the ultimate job on the world's most mysterious mainframe. Whilst doing so, they unlock more than they bargain for with supernatural and ultimately fatal results\".\n\n​\n\nBEAST (Chris Jupp 2009) - remake of the 2007 Michael J. Murphy film SKARE. All of the footage shot for Murphy's original 2001 version of SKARE went missing, and Jupp asked if he could base a new movie on the script. Mike bet him £10 that he wouldn't complete; four years later, Chris finished his movie - but Murphy had also refilmed SKARE himself during Chris' production period!\n\n​\n\nBEAST IN THE BASEMENT (Robbie Moffatt 2010) - also known as CONQUERING HEROES, this remake of THE BEAST IN THE CELLAR features younger women as the central characters, and a decidedly less hairy and more normal-looking 'beast', but is quite impressive in its own small way.\n\n​\n\nBEFORE DAWN (Dominic Brunt 2013) - couple who go away in an attempt to patch up their failing relationship find themselves in the midst of a zombie outbreak. Low-budget living dead fare from Brunt, who has since managed to balance a career as a TV soap opera star (as a main cast member of 'Emmerdale') with sideline forays into exploitation/horror cinema.\n\n​\n\nBENEATH STILL WATERS (Brian Yuzna 2005) - Spanish/U.K. co-production from Yuzna's Fantastic Factory.

Toby Jones stars in this mesmerising puzzle.\n\n​\n\nBEYOND THE RAVE (Matthias Hoene 2008) - the much-trumpeted return of Hammer Films disappointed many fans, but there's lots to like in this modern vampire item.

Ingrid Pitt made a cameo appearance.\n\n​\n\nBICYCLE DAY (Damian Morter 2011) - lads on a camping trip have their drinks spiked with LSD (the film's title refers to Albert Hoffmann's pioneering 1943 acid-dropping and bicycle-riding experiment) - and things then get gory.

Troma-like horror comedy.\n\n​\n\nCREEPSHOW 4 (John Perry 2018) - this outrage popped up briefly on YouTube in late 2018 before being swiftly removed. Some chancer has stolen a handful of other people's short films (including the rather good remake of PANIC, LEFT TURN), tacked them together, stuck on the Warner Bros logo, and used artwork from the CREEPSHOW franchise as well as pitching this cut-and-shunt job as a part of that franchise. The world of the British horror anthology has been a rather shady realm in the past but never quite this desperate.\n\n​\n\nCRISPY'S CURSE (John Williams 2017) - entertaining horror comedy featuring a back from the grave killer clown and Christian heavy metal band Messiah Fist.\n\n​\n\nCROW (Wyndham Price 2016) - property developer tries to evict squatters from his land, with folk horror rituals and deaths ensuing.\n\n​\n\nCRUCIBLE OF THE VAMPIRE (Ian Ross-McNamee 2019) - starring Katie Goldfinch and Neil Morrissey. \"Young museum curator, Isabelle, is sent to inspect a part of what seems to be a strange crucible buried near an eerie old manor\".\n\n​\n\nCRYING WOLF (Tony Jopia 2015) - werewolf comedy horror in 3D, including Caroline Munro among its cast\n\n​\n\nTHE CRYPT (Mark Murphy 2014) - \"The Church sends in a team to investigate the tragic deaths of a young group found in the crypt of a Convent\". 3D horror feature.\n\n​\n\nCRYPTIC (Freddie Hutton-Mills, Bart Ruspoli 2014) - a bunch of criminals are tasked with guarding a coffin, and tensions mount between them as time passes, with some talk of a vampire...\n\n​\n\nTHE CURED (David Freyne 2017) - Irish/French/US/UK co-production, in the aftermath of a zombie-causing plague that has swept Europe, with the infected now being rehabilitated into society.\n\n​\n\nTHE CURSE OF BA'AL (Joe Wheeler 2012) - in between churning out his 'Jengo' movies, amateur director Wheeler offered up this low-budget horror item too.\n\n​\n\nTHE CURSE OF JENGO (Joe Wheeler 2015) - the fourth of Wheeler's films about Jengo, a nightmare figure who possesses his victims and urges them to murder.

Produced by the Children's Film Unit for Channel 4 - Finbow and his juvenile crew, all 16 or under, later concocted the enjoyable monster comedy UNDER THE BED.\n\n​\n\nDALEKS - INVASION EARTH 2150 A.D. (Gordon Flemyng 1966) - Peter Cushing as t.v.'s 'Doctor Who' in Amicus Films' second Dalek adventure. Great death scene for stuntman Eddie Powell!\n\n​\n\nTHE DAMNED (Joseph Losey 1963) - ingenious political sf filmed for Hammer by Losey, effortlessly mixing leather-clad bikers, holiday romance, and looming apocalypse.\n\n​\n\nDANCE OF THE VAMPIRES (Roman Polanski 1967) - splendid vampire spoof with Jack MacGowran and Polanski as bumbling monster-hunters. Production design, photography, and haunting Kristopher Komeda score could not have been bettered.\n\nDARK EYES OF LONDON (Walter Summers 1939) - Bela Lugosi as 'Dr.Orloff' in this Edgar Wallace adaptation.\n\n​\n\nDARK INTERVAL (Charles Saunders 1950) - old dark house stuff from the early days of Hammer.\n\n​\n\nDARK PLACES (Don Sharp 1973) - big name cast in disappointing 'find the inheritance' chiller set in old house with history of murder.\n\nDARK RED ROSES (Sinclair Hill 1929) - ref: ‘English Gothic’; “has a distinct flavour of THE HANDS OF ORLAC”.

Craig Fairbrass is no Edward Woodward...\n\n​\n\nDAWN (Niall Johnson 1990) - low-budget vampire movie shot in Bristol.\n\n​\n\nDAY OF THE TRIFFIDS (Steve Sekely 1963) - Sekely's original cut of this John Wyndham adaptation was deemed unreleasable, until Freddie Francis shot additional footage of the killer plants attacking a lighthouse.\n\n​​\n\nDEAD MEN TELL NO TALES (David MacDonald 1938) - Emlyn Williams as headmaster who leads a double life as a hunchbacked moneylender and murderer, getting up to no good in true Tod Slaughter fashion before cutting his own throat with a sliver of glass at the climax!\n\n​\n\nDEAD OF NIGHT (Basil Dearden, Robert Hamer, Charles Crichton, Alberto Cavalcanti 1945) - legendary British compendium of horror, with Michael Redgrave’s ventriloquist episode proving the stand-out.\n\n​\n\nTHE DEADLY BEES (Freddie Francis 1966) - rarely-screened Amicus killer bee outing, with Suzanna Leigh.\n\nDEADLY STRANGERS (Sidney Hayers1974) - girl accepts lift from a stranger at a time when a mad strangler is at large.\n\n​\n\nDEATH IS A NUMBER (Robert Henryson 1951) - 50-minute supporting feature - a witch’s curse of ‘fire and water’, and the numerological power of the number 9, mean that a racing driver is fated to die. Staid and somewhat talky in parts, but this extremely rare item has its moments, notably some terrific ghostly special effects as spectral mist gathers in the grounds of a manor house.\n\n​\n\nDEATH LINE (Gary Sherman 1972) - fondly-remembered 'horror on the London Underground' cannibalism tale. \"Mind The Doors!\"\n\n​\n\nDEATH MACHINE (Steven Norrington 1994) - experimental killer robot on the loose; worth seeing for a terrific turn from cult genre star Brad Dourif. Norrington moved on to big things in Hollywood, directing Wesley Snipes in BLADE.\n\n​\n\nDEATH SHIP (Alvin Rakoff 1980) - haunted Nazi warship from WW2 still sails the oceans in this lousy U.K./Canadian production.\n\n​\n\nDEATH SHOCK (Lindsay Honey 1981) - shot-on-video sex romp with satanic sacrificial rites thrown in as the rather unlikely raison d'etre. Ineffective as porn or horror movie, but not without a certain grubby charm.\n\nDEJA VU (Anthony Richmond 1985) - Jaclyn Smith and Nigel Terry as romantically-involved couple who realize they are the reincarnations of lovers who perished in a wartime fire.\n\nDEMONS OF THE MIND (Peter Sykes 1971) - ambitious and atypical Hammer outing, described by scripter Christopher Wicking as being a werewolf movie without the werewolf. Nobleman keeps his children locked away in fear that they will be inflicted with the insanity hereditary in the family line.\n\nDEMONSOUL (Elisar C. Kennedy 1994) - low-budget, shot-on-video feature, includes devil-worship, possession, vampirism etc.\n\nDESIRE (G. E. Hall 1920) - 54-minute silent adaptation of Balzac's story 'Le Peau De Chagrin'. Ass's skin grants author's wishes - but each wish shortens his lifespan...\n\nDEVIATION (Jose Larraz 1971) - early attempt at the 'sex and murder in a country manor' formula which became Larraz's trademark. Good in parts, a little confused in others.\n\n​\n\nTHE DEVIL DOLL (Lindsay Shonteff 1963) - taking its cue from DEAD OF NIGHT, a feature-length restaging of the 'ventriloquist possessed by his dummy' concept. Quite brilliant twist ending.\n\n​\n\nDEVIL GIRL FROM MARS (David Macdonald 1954) - early 'invader from another planet' offering.\n\n​\n\nTHE DEVIL RIDES OUT (Terence Fisher 1968) - the Duc de Richleau and friends combat satanic forces commanded by the evil Mocata (Charles Gray). Magnificent screen version of Dennis Wheatley's novel, scripted by Richard Matheson.

Just another day at the office for Uncle Ken...​\n\n​\n\nTHE DEVIL'S MEN (Costas Carayiannis 1976) - drab satanic stuff set in Greece, with Donald Pleasence and Peter Cushing slumming.\n\n​\n\nDEVILS OF DARKNESS (Lance Comfort 1964) - rather dreary vampire second-feature, not without its admirers.\n\n​\n\nDIE, MONSTER, DIE (Daniel Haller 1965) - American International production, based on Lovecraft's 'The Color Out Of Space' and shot in the U.K.\n\n​\n\nDIE SCREAMING MARIANNE (Pete Walker 1970) - psychological thriller from Walker, with a few minor hints indicating that he would breathe life into the home-based horror industry within a few years.\n\n​\n\nDISCIPLE OF DEATH (Tom Parkinson 1972) - one of several horror vehicles for former Radio One d.j. Mike Raven in the early 70s.\n\n​\n\nTHE DOCTOR AND THE DEVILS (Freddie Francis 1985) - Mel Brooks backed this old-fashioned body-snatching drama, based on an unfilmed script by Dylan Thomas.\n\n​\n\nDOCTOR BLOOD'S COFFIN (Sidney J.Furie 1960) - sinister goings-on in Cornish tin-mining country. Attractively shot but rather dull, despite the presence of Hazel Court and a shambling zombie.\n\n​\n\nDOCTOR FAUSTUS (Richard Burton, Neville Coghill 1967) - from Marlowe's play.\n\n​\n\nDR.JEKYLL AND SISTER HYDE (Roy Ward Baker 1971) - Ralph Bates and Martine Beswicke in Hammer's distaff version of Stevenson.\n\nDR.PHIBES RISES AGAIN (Robert Fuest 1972) - more flamboyant comic chills; this time, Phibes (Vincent Price) seeks the elixir of life in Egypt.

A diverse selection indeed, from silent classics to unknown Filipino gore-fests.\n\n​\n\nDOOMWATCH (Peter Sasdy 1972) - Tigon's big-screen version of the BBC ecological drama series.\n\n​\n\nDRACULA (Terence Fisher 1958) - Christopher Lee's first appearance as the Count, pitted against Peter Cushing's valiant Van Helsing in the first of Hammer's long-running series. A classic of British horror.\n\n​\n\nDRACULA (Dan Curtis 1973) - Curtis shot his t.v. movie adaptation of Stoker, scripted by Richard Matheson, in England. Jack Palance makes an oddly effective Count.\n\n​\n\nDRACULA (John Badham 1979) - Frank Langella as a matinee idol-style vampire in this version inspired by a successful stage revival.\n\n​\n\nDRACULA A.D. 1972 (Alan Gibson 1972) - Christopher Lee's Count hits swinging London. Outdated even before it was released, but now holds a peculiar and fascinating appeal. Tremendous prologue, set in 1872, sees Dracula and Van Helsing battling to the death aboard a speeding horse-drawn carriage.\n\nDRACULA, DEMON OF THE NIGHT (Ian Yeoman 1975) - perhaps the strangest film to appear anywhere on this site, this was a 45-minute (approx.) amateur remake of Hammer’s DRACULA, PRINCE OF DARKNESS, shot on 8mm and in colour - in an animated version in which the characters are represented by cardboard toilet-roll tubes!! It was screened at the first Horror Elite convention at the Kenilworth Hotel, Great Russell Street, London on November 15th 1975 - Hammer director Terence Fisher was in attendance as a convention guest, and was presented with the 8mm print as a gift after the screening! Ref: Dave Simpson.\n\nDRACULA HAS RISEN FROM THE GRAVE (Freddie Francis 1968) - intriguing Hammer vampire sequel, with the feel of a spaghetti western and a script overloaded with theological debate.\n\n​\n\nDRACULA, PRINCE OF DARKNESS (Terence Fisher 1965) - Christopher Lee's Count revived in an excellent sequel. Barbara Shelley steals the show with a full-throttle display of unleashed repressed libido.\n\n​\n\nDREAM DEMON (Harley Cokliss 1988) - potentially powerful mix of post-Falklands War trauma and supernatural horror merely produces a rather silly film, with absurd roles for t.v. favourites Timothy Spall and Jimmy Nail.\n\n​\n\nDRIFTWOOD (Ronan O'Leary 1996) - James Spader as man washed ashore on remote island, held captive by young woman. Spectre, axe murder, etc. in British/Irish co-production doubtless influenced to some degree by the success of Rob Reiner's MISERY.\n\n​\n\nDUST DEVIL (Richard Stanley 1992) - young woman escaping from failed relationship hooks up with an African desert traveller, revealed as a supernatural demon.\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\nPOST-2000\n\n​\n\nDADDY'S GIRL (D.
