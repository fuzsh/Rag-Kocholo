        "text": "DVD Rentals - And You Can Take That to the Bank (Job)\n\nJuly 31st, 2008\n\nThere were a boatload of were new releases on the rental charts this week, including the new number one renter, The Bank Job, which generated nearly 50% more revenue than its nearest competitor. More...\n\nDVD Rentals - Vantage Remains on Point\n\nJuly 23rd, 2008\n\nWeak new releases allowed Vantage Point to remain on top of the rental charts with fellow holdover Drillbit Taylor placing second. More...\n\nDVD Sales - Meet the New Number One\n\nJuly 15th, 2008\n\nMeet the Browns led all new releases on its way to capturing the number one spot on this week's sales chart. However, its opening week sales of $8.75 million from 474,000 units were not strong to say the least and were behind the $10.64 million in sales generated by Vantage Point. It is important to note that the latter film sold only 407,000 units and only earned more thanks to a higher per unit price. More...\n\nDVD Rentals - Point to Vantage\n\nJuly 15th, 2008\n\nVantage Point led the way on the rental charts, generating nearly 30% revenue more than either of the next two films: Drillbit Taylor, which opened in second place, and 10,000 B.C., which fell from first to third place. More...\n\nDVD Releases for July 8, 2008\n\nJuly 7th, 2008\n\nAnother week without a first-run release that deserves serious consideration for the DVD Pick of the Week award. This means we are left looking at special editions, limited releases, and TV on DVD sets for the best of the week. Sadly there are not a lot of contenders here either. Batman Begins on Blu-ray Standard Edition or Limited Edition is certainly worth picking up, but it is mostly just a port of the HD DVD release and I was hoping for more (like having the extras in High Definition). The Monk / Psych two-pack offers two great shows for a reasonable price, but I'm not sure it's award-worthy. The best this week has to offer is Stargate Atlantis - Season Four - Buy from Amazon, and it is this week's DVD Pick of the Week. More...\n\nDVD Releases for July 1, 2008\n\nJune 30th, 2008\n\nAnother week without a marquee first-run release, but that's not surprising given the time of year. There are a few releases that were contenders for DVD Pick of the Week, including two TV on DVD releases: 30 Days - The Complete Second Season - Buy from Amazon and Mad Men - Season One - Buy from Amazon: DVD or Blu-ray. Both are worthy for different reasons, and if I were forced to pick one, I'd probably just flip a coin, so I might as well award them both the DVD Pick of the Week. More...\n\nInternational Details - Step Up Falls Down and Out of the Top Five\n\nApril 6th, 2008\n\nStep Up 2 The Streets fell more than 40% last weekend while dropping out of the top five. This was mainly due to the lack of major openings, while its holdover results were merely average. In the U.K. it was down 42% to $2.74 million on 351 screens over the weekend for a total of $11.32 million and in Australia it was down 44% to $1.31 million on 188 screens lifting its total to $5.10 million after two. Overall it added $7.38 million on 1615 screens in 27 markets for a total of $53.21 million, which was enough to lift its worldwide total to more than $100 million. More...\n\n21 Busts at the Box Office, But in a Good Way\n\nApril 1st, 2008\n\nA mixed week at the box office, but the overall box office was a little higher than expected. That said, at $107 million the total was down 6% from last weekend. More importantly, it was down 16% from the same weekend last year. 2008 has fallen behind 2007's pace in terms of ticket sales and it up in terms of dollars by less than 1%, $2.12 billion to $2.11 billion. This lead might not hold up until the weekend. More...\n\nInternational Details - Race to the Top Ends Short\n\nMarch 30th, 2008\n\nThe latest Indian movie to be released on the worldwide stage was Race, which earned $9.90 million on 1212 screens in 16 markets placing sixth on the international charts. It did very well in India, but exact numbers were not released. More...\n\n21 Hopes to Hit the Jackpot\n\nMarch 27th, 2008\n\nFour wide releases this week, but only two have a real shot at top spot. In fact, the other two don't really have a shot at the top five. Add in Horton Hears a Who and there should be a three-way race for first place. If Horton can pull off a victory, it would be amazing, since is already the only film released in 2008 that has repeated as box office champion. More...\n\nFunny Brings in the Money over Bunny Weekend\n\nMarch 25th, 2008\n\nEaster Weekend is not regarded as a long weekend and expectations were not unreasonably high. However, a few films missed expectations and this left the box office on the south side of predictions. Overall, films earned $113 million over the weekend, which was down 6% from last weekend. More importantly, it was down nearly 16% from the same weekend last year. Hopefully things will turn around in April, because I don't see that happening next weekend. More...\n\nMovie Website Reviews for Weekend of March 21, 2008\n\nMarch 22nd, 2008\n\nSlow week for top-notch websites with only one film that was even in contention for the Weekly Website Award. Fortunately, Drillbit Taylor - Official Site is such a good site it could have won if it was a busy week. More...\n\nTaylor Made\n\nMarch 20th, 2008\n\nIt's Easter weekend, which is a rather big holiday up here in Canada, but is not even considered a long weekend in the United States. We celebrate it by eating lots of chocolate bunnies (ears first) and cheering or favorite NHL teams into the play-offs. (Or if you are from Toronto saying, \"Next year will be different.\" (...No it won't.)) But there are new wide releases to check out, three of them, in fact. We also have the second weekend for the biggest opener of the year, which is aiming to become repeat champion at the box office. More...\n\nCast Updates - March 20, 2008\n\nMarch 20th, 2008\n\nThis week's round of new casting information contains updates for The Grand, The Proposal, The Legend of Secret Pass, and more! More...\n\nContest - You Know the Drill\n\nMarch 14th, 2008\n\nIt's Friday. That must mean we have a ton of prizes to give away and another box office prediction contest to do it. In order to win this one, one must simply predict Drillbit Taylor's three-day, opening weekend box office. Whoever comes the closest to predicting the film's opening 3-day weekend box office (Friday to Sunday), without going over, will win Suburban Girl on DVD and Dedication on DVD. Meanwhile, whoever comes the closest to predicting the film's opening 3-day weekend box office (Friday to Sunday), without going under, will win General Hospital: Night Shift - The Complete First Season on DVD. Additionally, both the above winners will also take home The Darjeeling Limited on DVD Entries must be received by 10 a.m., Pacific Time on Friday to be eligible, so don't delay! More...\n\n2008 Preview: March\n\nMarch 1st, 2008\n\n2008 stumbled last month and there doesn't seem to be many potential blockbusters this month. By the end of March last year, there were three films releases that would reach $100 million, including one that reached $200 million, and two others that missed that milestone by less than $5 million. This year, we could enter April without a single $100 million movie. More...\n\nCast Updates - December 27, 2007\n\nDecember 27th, 2007\n\nThis week's round of new casting information contains updates for Fly Me To the Moon, Justice League, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, and more! More...\n\nNew Movie US Release Dates - April 22, 2007\n\nApril 22nd, 2007"
