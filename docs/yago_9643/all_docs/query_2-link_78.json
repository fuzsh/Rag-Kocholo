        "text": "Drillbit Taylor (102 mins, 12A) Directed by Steve Brill; starring Owen Wilson, Troy Gentile, Nate Hartley, David Dorfman\n\nFinally, four American comedies, two of them as bad as anything I've endured this past decade. First, Drillbit Taylor, directed by Steven Brill (whose credits include the dire remake of Mr Deeds) from a script by Seth Rogen, author of Superbad, is a familiar tale of three sympathetic, 14-year-old dorks (one short and fat, one tall, thin and bespectacled, one small and weedy) picked on by bullies during their first week in a Los Angeles high school.\n\nThe chief bully is a sadistic psychopath who manipulates the school's dim principal and the lads hire a charming drop-out (Owen Wilson), living rough by theft and begging in the hills above Santa Monica, as their bodyguard. There are amusing moments, but the boys' fellow pupils are so appalling in their tolerance of bullying as to be utterly loathsome and the payoff is as violent as the end of On the Waterfront."
