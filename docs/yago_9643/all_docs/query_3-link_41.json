        "text": "OP\n\nTop 10 Poster\n\nJoined:\n\nPosts: 29,275\n\nEveryone LOVES a Good Highschool Fist-Fight between the Nerds and The Bullies..so add-in Owen Wilson as \"DRILLBIT TAYLOR\" (Military DeserterCon-Man/& Rent-a-Bodyguard) & here comes a Real FUN Flick-at-the-Fights!\n\nSet in Sunny Southern California's High School Culture, this plot's Scripted by John Hughes, & later, by Seth Rogen & Kristophor Brown. Comedically-Pits NERDS Wade (Nate Hartkey), Emmitt (David Dorfman) & Ryan (Troy Gentile) against BRUISERS Felkins (Alex Frost) & Ronnie (Josh Beck), two Typically-Rich Ne'er-Do-Wells who enjoy beating up The Fat, The Small, The Skinny. (Yeah, our 3 \"Heroes-in-the-Making!\") As Actors, ALL these Kids do a Wonderful Job here!\n\n\"Drillbit\" (Wilson) transforms quite a bit, too...Homeless..picking up scammed loot, a Girlfriend..then finally, \"A Life\"...along the way. (Girlfriend Lisa's well-portrayed by Leslie Mann..Producer Judd Apatov's real-life wife.) Let's mention Wade's Girlfriend, too: Valerie Tiant plays Brooke..a sweet Asian Gal he meets in the Hallways, First Day of High School...(You saw her in \"JUNO\" as The Picketer outside the abortion clinic.) She's good in here, too!\n\nI think it's safe to say that ANYONE who's ever been bullied in school will LOVE this Flick. Sight Gags & Smooth Moves GALORE, with fine Punk-to-Pop Music behind all the action. Plotline's fairly-cliche: It's \"ROCKY\"-with-Acne..(Times Three)..and Scam Man goes Straight. A whole LOT of Rock-'Em/Sock-'Em FUN aimed at High-Minded Kids of ALL Ages. An \"8-Outta-10\" for Viewability, though I'd recommend leaving Younger Kids Home, so they don't grow up thinking \"Fists can Solve Everything\".\n\nYet sometimes watchin' a Good Butt-Whippin' Develop IS VERY-Satisfying to us More-mature Onlookers..& this Flick Delivers. Owen Wilson's stayed Fun-&-Quite-Watchable here,\n\n& I'm VERY glad he's sticking-around to keep on feedin' us his Loveable Characters onscreen.\n\nJMO...Keep-or-Sweepit\n\nBig Hugs,\n\nStan\n\nOP\n\nTop 10 Poster\n\nJoined:\n\nPosts: 29,275\n\nI'm gonna Bump This Baby Back Up, in hopes You'll Maybe Go SEE this Flick & have a Good Time Doin' So...\n\n& Maybe post us a Wee Bitta Feedback here..to say I was \"Dead Wrong\"..or a Small Backpat sayin' \"Right ON, Bro!\"\n\nI say this partly because I REALLY Enjoy Owen Wilson's Acting, AND because he kinda Stepped-Back & Let The KIDS \"Do Their Stuff\"..& it's the Kid Actors who more-or-less Steal The Show on this one.\n\nWhile I DO enjoy \"Movies that Make Ya Think\"...I also enjoy \"Movies that Make Ya Laugh (& NOT Think-TOO-Much)\" & in this Second Category, this Movie Soars.\n\nSo..if you're Tired of all The Political News...the Casualty Count in Iraq..Gas Prices...(Etc., Etc..) just GO See This Movie & LAUGH for an Evening/leave the Theater feeling GOOD-&-Entertained..& consider it \"Inexpensive Therapy\", if ya have to have \"A Reason\" for having a Good Time.\n\nI'll confess to watchin' WWE Rasslin' every Fri Nite..tho my wife thinks I'm Nuts..but it's fun to watch some PROS poundin' away on each other after a Long Week of Day-Job. (NOTHIN' \"Intellectual\" about it in The Least.)\n\nI know it's Only Flop-&-Roll, but I Like It.\n\nBest Wishes & Big Hugs,\n\nStan\n\nTop 10 Poster\n\nJoined:\n\nPosts: 19,620\n\nLikes: 13\n\nI can't imagine seeing an Owen Wilson flick at the theater for money... he seems like a Cable TV kinda actor... = )\n\nBrian Austin Whitney\n\nFounder\n\nJust Plain Folks\n\njpfolkspro@gmail.com\n\nSkype: Brian Austin Whitney\n\nFacebook: www.facebook.com/justplainfolks\n\n\"Don't sit around and wait for success to come to you... it doesn't know the way.\" -Brian Austin Whitney\n\n\"It's easier to be the bigger man when you actually are...\" -Brian Austin Whitney\n\n\"Sometimes all you have to do to inspire humans to greatness is to give them a reason and opportunity to do something great.\" -Brian Austin Whitney"
