Unfortunately, that potential is rarely reached.

Sadly, the kind of consistent humor delivered by this film happens too rarely. This is the movie Wedding Crashers should have been: rude, raunchy, uproarious, yet wi...\n\nBling Ring, The\n\nWatching The Bling Ring, Sofia Coppola's exploration of today's \"celebrity culture,\" is an uncomfortable - bordering on unpleasant - experience.
