        "text": "“Drillbit Taylor” – A Paramount Pictures release. Directed by Steven Brill. Starring Owen Wilson, Leslie Mann, David Dorfman, Danny McBride, Josh Peck, Troy Gentile, and Nate Hartley. Rated PG-13.\n\nDrillbit Taylor is a bad comedy. Audiences will get the feeling, while watching this film, that it would love to be an R-rated high school comedy, but for some reason it’s PG-13. And, although there are plenty of lame jokes – poorly done slapstick and some very violent situations that just don’t feel like they should be as strong as they are – it feels like something was held back.\n\nThe story here is pretty old school; it’s all about the high school bully, or, in this case, bullies. There are two of them, Filkins and Ronnie (Frost and Peck), and they turn their attention toward skinny Wade (Hartley) and his chucky friend Ryan (Gentile), who try to help the small and scared Emmit (Dorfman).\n\nThe three are in constant fear of the two bullies. Desperate, they decide to hire a bodyguard, and the only one they can afford is Drillbit Taylor (Wilson). Of course, he’s far from a real bodyguard; he’s a homeless guy who normally spends his days begging for money. Assuming that playing bodyguard is easy money, he teaches the three some lame kung fu moves and lies about his special forces background, all the while suckering them into giving him cash and clothes. Later, he ends up pretending to be a teacher so he can watch over them. What he doesn’t figure on is that the three will grow on him or that he’s going to fall for a fellow teacher (Mann).\n\nWhat audiences get is pretty weak stuff that just isn’t funny. First and foremost, the three kids are in high school, but there’s no way they would believe Drillbit could protect them. Secondly, not one character is funny.\n\nHow bad does it get? Not once but twice audiences get to see Drillbit showering naked on the beach – that’s a real scream, isn’t it?\n\nOnly once, when Wade and Ryan try to take punches from each other, does the film generate some laughs.\n\nThe rest of the time the audiences sits there, hoping for a joke, but, instead, gets a ridiculous climax complete with a samurai sword.\n\nWilson is lost playing another obnoxious character, even worse than the loser he played in You, Me and Dupree (2006). He just isn’t funny, and the whole laid-back routine is getting old.\n\nDrillbit Taylor is just terrible. If audiences want to see an excellent version of this same story they should rent My Bodyguard (1980), which stars a young Matt Dillon."
