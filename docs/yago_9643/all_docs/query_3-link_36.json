        "text": "Reviewed by Colin Jacobson (August 23, 2021)\n\nBack in 1980, My Bodyguard offered a gentle look at a bullied teenage boy who actually hires a bigger dude to protect him from his peers. That theme gets a 21st century update with the much more overtly comedic Drillbit Taylor.\n\nIn this flick, we meet two high school freshmen: rail-thin Wade (Nate Hartley) and chubby Ryan (Troy Gentile). They hope to have a great first year, but things go awry on opening day. When bullies try to shove tiny Emmit (David Dorfman) in a locker, Wade stands up for him.\n\nThis doesnt go well. Bully Terry Filkins (Alex Frost) targets the pair for his reign of terror, and adds Emmit to the bunch when he starts to pal around with the other boys.\n\nAfter a while the guys tire of their daily torture, so they decide to take an extreme step: they hire a bodyguard. They cant afford much, so they end up with Drillbit Taylor (Owen Wilson), a homeless vet hard up for money. We follow their path as they attempt to deal with the bullying.\n\nResearch shows that circa 2008, 84 percent of the movies made over the prior couple of years involve Judd Apatow and/or Seth Rogen. They participate in Taylor as well since Rogen acted as co-writer, while Apatow co-produced it.\n\nThat means a certain level of familiarity comes out here, especially when compared with 2007s Superbad. That flick featured a shy, scrawny nerd and a fat, curly-headed one as they try to finish high school on a high note.\n\nHere we get a shy, scrawny nerd and a fat, curly-headed one as they attempt to start high school in a positive way. The two flicks arent clones, but they clearly come from the same gene pool.\n\nTo be sure, Taylor shows some of the standard Apatow trademarks. Though not to the ridiculous degree seen with efforts like Knocked Up or 40-Year-Old Virgin, its too long. The filmmakers couldve easily trimmed a good 15 to 20 minutes here and made the movie tighter and more satisfying.\n\nLike many efforts under the Apatow umbrella, Taylor shows ramshackle storytelling. The film features a loose sense of narrative, and it takes a fair number of distracting detours.\n\nThe tale doesnt flail due to excessive ambition  its not like it tries to pack in a great deal of different situations  but it simply fails to develop them in a smooth, concise manner. Scenarios change and progress in a jerky, awkward manner much of the time. This gives the film an almost episodic feel instead of the natural tone that should dominate.\n\nDespite the flaws, Taylor manages to become generally entertaining. Wilson doesnt break a sweat as the lead character, but he provides a typically likeable performance.\n\nHe hits the right comedic beats and also turns Drillbit into a reasonably engaging personality. The various young actors do just fine with their roles as well, though none of them provide breakout work, as they occasionally seem a little anonymous to me.\n\nAnd the same goes for Taylor. This is the kind of movie that offers decent entertainment as you watch but doesnt go any deeper.\n\nThough it prompts occasional chuckles, it lacks deep laughs or much to make it memorable. Expect a minor diversion and nothing more.\n\nFootnote: stick around through the finish of the end credits for a little coda. Oh, and My Bodyguard fans will find a reference to that film in Taylors first act.\n\nDrillbit Taylor appears in an aspect ratio of approximately 2.35:1 on this Blu-ray Disc. The movie featured a good transfer.\n\nSharpness usually appeared acceptably accurate and detailed. At times, however, I found the image to come across as a little fuzzy and soft, with lesser definition seen in some of the wide shots. Nonetheless, most of the movie appeared clear and appropriately focused.\n\nMoiré effects and jagged edges presented no concerns, and edge haloes remained absent. No print flaws materialized, so the film remained clean and fresh.\n\nIn terms of colors, the flick went with a subdued set of tones, with a golden tint to things. Within those parameters, the tones looked fine.\n\nBlacks were dark and firm, while shadows appeared clear and well-developed. The image worked fine.\n\nAs for the films Dolby TrueHD 5.1 soundtrack, it offered a functional effort and that was all. Of course, I didnt expect a dazzling soundfield from this sort of comedy, and I got exactly what I anticipated.\n\nSurround usage stayed limited most of the time. A few action scenes opened things up in a minor way, but the rear speakers really had little to do here.\n\nIn those forward channels, the music provided decent stereo separation and opened up the mix reasonably well. There wasnt a whole lot of activity or movement, but they conveyed a passable sense of space and place. The track functioned appropriately for the story.\n\nAudio quality appeared fine. Dialogue was consistently warm and natural, and speech displayed no concerns related to edginess or intelligibility.\n\nEffects were a minor component of the mix, and they seemed appropriately subdued and accurate; there wasnt much to hear, but the various elements were clean and distinct.\n\nThe music came across as acceptably distinctive. This was a standard comedy mix and became a decent reproduction of the material.\n\nHow did the Blu-ray compare to the DVD version? The BDs lossless audio showed a little more range than the lossy DVD, but the limited nature of the mix restricted improvements.\n\nVisuals offered more obvious upgrades, though, as the Blu-ray seemed better defined and more vivid than the DVD. This turned into a worthwhile step up in quality.\n\nThe Blu-ray shares the DVDs extras, and we start with an audio commentary from director Steven Brill, writer Kristofor Brown, and actors Troy Gentile, Nate Hartley and David Dorfman. Brill and Brown participate in the entire running, screen-specific chat, while the actors come in gradually.\n\nDorfman shows up briefly, Gentile pops in mid-film, and Hartley appears toward the end. Gentile and Hartley overlap for a short period, but usually the actors comment without their peers.\n\nThe commentary looks at locations and sets, cast, characters and performances, story and script issues, and various trivia tidbits. The track usually works best when the actors dont get involved. Brill and Brown offer some good notes and prove entertaining as well.\n\nWhen the performers come into the picture, the piece becomes fluffier and less informative. Overall, it ends up as a pretty good track; it has its faults, but it keeps us involved most of the time.\n\n19 Deleted and Extended Scenes last a total of 23 minutes, 32 seconds. Not a single bit here adds to the story or characters, but plenty of amusing moments appear. I dont know how they wouldve worked in the final cut, but theyre fun to see.\n\nNext we find a 14-minute featurette called The Writers Get a Chance to Talk. It presents remarks from Brown and co-writer Seth Rogen as they chat about their relationship with producer Judd Apatow, character and story notes, alternate ideas not used in the final film, and thoughts about a potential sequel.\n\nTalk is essentially a casual phone conversation between Rogen and Brown, and it proves quite fun. They cover a lot of good details about the script and make the result eminently enjoyable as well.\n\nMore cut material comes from Line-O-Rama. It offers a four-minute, 24-second collection of alternate lines. These mostly come from scenes that made the flick but provide different takes. That makes them entertaining.\n\nAfter this we find a four-minute, one-second Gag Reel. These offer the usual goofs and giggles. A few interesting alternate lines also appear, but not enough to allow this to rise above the level of the standard blooper nonsense.\n\nFive short featurettes follow. Rap Off goes for three minutes, 35 seconds as it shows Gentile and Alex Frost as they work through their lines for the big rap confrontation scene. Its a good look behind the scenes.\n\nIn the three-minute, 24-second Sprinkler Day, we find more candid footage of the set. This follows the scene in which Drillbit sets off the schools sprinklers to save the kids. It intercuts too many movie shots so its not as revealing as one might expect.\n\nBully fills two minutes, 59 seconds with shots of the movies baddies. Its a greatest hits reel that combines film clips and behind the scenes images. Not much of interest materializes.\n\nFor the three-minute, two-second Directing Kids, we find outtakes of the young actors as they goof around during the shoot and see how Brill worked with them. Despite the pieces brevity, enough intriguing moments emerge to make it worthwhile.\n\nFinally, The Real Don: Danny McBride goes for five minutes, 46 seconds as it allows us to hear the actors thoughts on his character. He jokes around a lot, and he occasionally offers some amusing comments. Nothing terribly informative appears, though.\n\nThe disc ends with two trailers for Taylor.\n\nNote that the Blu-ray comes with some featurettes absent from the DVD. We find Panhandle, Kids on the Loose, Super Billy, Bodyguard, Trading Punches, Filkins Fight and The Life of Don.\n\nNormally I would discuss these, but the rental Blu-ray of Taylor I got suffered from scratches that rendered these unwatchable. Based on what I read, they fall into the same vein as the featurettes found on the DVD, so they should offer similar content.\n\nAs a comedy, Drillbit Taylor gives us a smattering of laughs but it never quite sizzles. Though the movie proves acceptably entertaining, it doesnt become anything more substantial or memorable; its a B-level effort. The Blu-ray provides good picture and acceptable audio along with a long roster of extras. This is a perfectly positive release for a generally watchable flick.\n\nTo rate this film visit the DVD review of DRILLBIT TAYLOR"
