        "text": "The Eight-Part Series Begins Friday, March 26 at 9PM ET/8C\n\nNew York, February 4, 2010 – Sundance Channel will premiere the critically acclaimed comedy series, Chandon Pictures, as part of its Friday night comedy block, \"Knock Knock,\" beginning March 26 at 9PM/8C. Created and written by noted Australian filmmaker, Rob Carlton, Chandon Pictures follows the amusing misadventures of a struggling video company. The eight-episode first season will premiere over the course of four weeks, with two half-hour episodes airing back-to-back at 9PM/8C and 9:30PM/8:30C every Friday night, from March 26 – April 16.\n\nIn Chandon Pictures, Rob Carlton stars as Tom Chandon, a documentary filmmaker and founder of the hapless video production company Chandon Pictures. Though Tom considers himself an auteur — or, in his words, \"a documenteur\" — his portfolio mainly consists of wedding and children’ birthday party videos and a strange little film called, Bonzo: The Clown that Killed a Child. But with the help of his loyal cameraman, Rick (Darren Gilshenan), his pragmatic producer, Lucy (Rebecca Massey), and an ample supply of vanity and self-delusion, Tom manages to twist each client’s brief to match his creative dreams of making \"films that matter.\" Chandon Pictures is directed by Rob Carlton and Alex Weinress.\n\nEpisode descriptions for Chandon Pictures are as follows:\n\nFriday, March 26th at 9PM/8C\n\nEpisode 1: \"Cousins\"\n\nTom is not at all pleased at the prospect of making yet another wedding video, this one commissioned by the families of sexy, baby-voiced Sherbert (Kathryn Beck) and guileless David (Ed Kavalee). But Sherbert and David are no ordinary, head-over-heels young lovers: they’re first cousins. Tom is eager to tell a story of forbidden love against the odds, and he and Nick are delighted to uncover even more secrets as they begin taping interviews at David’s parents’ house. Tensions rise with the unexpected arrival of Sherbert’s older brother (Mark Brady), and the stage is set for a supremely uncomfortable backyard wedding conducted by a studiously tolerant priest named Bevan (Angus Sampson).\n\nFriday, March 26th at 9:30PM/8:30C\n\nEpisode 2: \"Back to School\"\n\nTom is stunned and excited to receive a visit from his high school classmate, the lovely Samantha Howarth (Justine Clarke). Now an administrator at their alma mater, Samantha needs Tom’s help for the school’s upcoming Careers Day, when successful alumni offer advice to the student body. Tom is elated until he realizes Samantha doesn’t want him to speak at the event she wants him to videotape it. For free. Tom bargains his services for a brief speaking slot, fully expecting to emerge with a brilliant documentary about his own triumphant return. But the younger generation doesn’t seem the least bit excited to have a filmmaker in their midst. Worse yet, Tom discovers that the day’s keynote speaker is none other than his younger brother, the slick and extremely successful banker, Carmichael (Josh Lawson).\n\nFriday, April 2nd at 9PM/8C\n\nEpisode 3: \"Bevan’s Heaven\"\n\nChandon Pictures is having serious cash flow problems and its offices – aka Tom’s house – are plagued with termites. As a co-owner of the house, Carmichael is concerned and lines up a potential contract for Chandon making training videos for his bank. Lucy and Rick welcome the idea of steady income, but Tom bristles at the very idea of \"selling out.\" Besides, Reverend Bevan – the bearded, dulcet-toned priest who officiated at cousins Sherbert and David’s wedding – has split from the church to launch his own non-denominational ministry. The renegade cleric arrives at Chandon Pictures accompanied by a worshipful acolyte named Gabby (Andrea Wallis) and a proposition for Tom: that he become the official videographer of \"One.God.\"\n\nFriday, April 2nd at 9:30PM/8:30C\n\nEpisode 4: \"Champion Charles\"\n\nDog-owner Helen McDonald (Penne Hackforth-Jones) comes to Chandon Pictures hoping to transfer photos of her beloved pup, Champion Charles Wink Monte Carlo to video; thanks to Lucy, she walks out having commissioned a tribute film to her canine companion. It may not be the hard-hitting truth-telling filmmaking Tom is accustomed to, but the money’s good. Tom reconnects with his former assistant Zoe (Nadia Townsend), who helped him on Oh No Bonzo. Zoe is now working for one of the biggest game show producers in the business – and when Tom learns her boss has feature documentary ambitions, he cajoles a promise of an introduction. Work begins on the Champion Charles tribute, Tom, Lucy and Nick find themselves dealing with a micro-managing client, her resentful adult daughter, and a very elusive star.\n\nFriday, April 9th at 9PM/8C\n\nEpisode 5: \"Private Dick\"\n\nTom combines sleuthing with filmmaking when an old friend, Andrew (Michael Denkha) hires him to surreptitiously videotape his wife Annabelle (Jessica Napier), whom he suspects of infidelity. As Lucy, Carmichael and Nick gather to discuss the bank pitch, Tom refuses to participate and declares that he will focus on the big picture: making his documentary about breakaway priest Bevan. To everyone’s astonishment, Tom announces he has found an investor willing to fund Bevan’s Heaven.\n\nFriday, April 9th at 9:30PM/8:30C\n\nEpisode 6: \"Death Wish\"\n\nSpirits are high at Chandon Pictures, with the arrival of former Chandon Pictures client Helen McDonald as executive producer and chief investor. But there is more to Tom’s relationship with Helen than meets the eye. Chandon’s latest client is John (Graeme Blundell), a cancer-stricken accountant who wants to videotape his last will and testament. Tom isn’t pleased with John’s no-frills reading of his will, however, and insists upon a more emotional approach. Carmichael is aghast to learn that Tom is sleeping with his investor, while Lucy and Rick are simply aghast that Tom is sleeping with a woman 30 years his senior. Tom meets with Helen’s financial advisor, Mr. Gilbertson (David Ritchie) to discuss the next steps.\n\nFriday, April 16th at 9PM/8C\n\nEpisode 7: \"White Ants\"\n\nNick threatens to resign unless Tom gets the corporate job with Carmichael’s bank. Pest expert Dean (Gary Wardell) arrives to deal with the infestation at the Chandon house, bringing with him some bizarre theories about termite psychology. Tom finally meets Eddie Connoly (Peter Phelps), producer of \"Cash Cash Cash\" and other hit game shows. As Tom, Rick and Lucy arrive at the bank to present their pitch, Rick gets the phone call he’s been waiting for – and so does Tom. A relieved Lucy completes her Power Point presentation to the search committee, Tom steps up to unveil the second part of the pitch: the Chandon Pictures’ video profile.\n\nFriday, April 16th at 9:30PM\n\nEpisode 8: \"Hollywood\"\n\nA newspaper article exposes seamy goings-on at Bevan’s church; as the only person with footage of Bevan’s fledging sect, Tom is in the catbird seat. With a contract seemingly imminent, Tom is ready to turn down a job making an audition tape for stand-up comedian Shane (Anthony Simcoe). But he recognizes a kindred spirit in Shane, who toils by day in desktop publishing. As Lucy nervously awaits the bank’s verdict on Chandon’s pitch, Nick learns his wife is carrying twins. Tom is summoned to Eddie Connoly’s office, and brings along his full retinue – Carmichael, Lucy and Nick – to make a deal for Bevan’s Heaven."
