        "text": "Updates provide foundation for near term development plans\n\nSince 1 July 2023, Catalyst has been re-estimating Reserves and Resources for all deposits across the Plutonic Gold Belt\n\nK2 and Plutonic East are near term developments for Catalyst and the updated Mineral Resources will underpin Catalyst's organic growth plans\n\nMineral Resources for K2 are:\n\n0.7Mt at 3.6g/t Au for 81,000oz\n\nMineral Resources for Plutonic East are:\n\n2.2Mt at 2.5g/t Au for 182,000oz\n\nK2 and Plutonic East have existing underground declines. As a result they will have low start-up costs and are incremental ore sources for Plutonic's underutilised mill. These Mineral Resources are an important step toward bringing these deposits into production.\n\nPERTH, Australia, Aug. 9, 2024 /PRNewswire/ - Catalyst Metals Limited (Catalyst or the Company) (ASX: CYL) is pleased to provide updated Mineral Resource Estimates for the K2 and Plutonic East underground mines.\n\nPlutonic East and K2 represent near term developments for Catalyst. These Resources provide the foundation for Catalyst's approach to developing and mining these deposits.\n\nCatalyst's MD & CEO, James Champion de Crespigny, said:\n\n\"Catalyst is rapidly progressing developments across the Plutonic Gold Belt. Our strong balance sheet, supported by stable operations will allow us to prudently bring developments into production and utilise the excess mill capacity at Plutonic.\n\n\"The updated Resources at K2 and Plutonic East will form the basis of Catalyst's development and mine planning. They are an important step towards taking these projects into production.\n\nSince consolidating the Plutonic Gold Belt in July 2023, Catalyst has been systematically re-evaluating previous Mineral Resource Estimates across the Plutonic Belt.\n\nCatalyst considered that a new approach to estimation was appropriate. To date, this approach has been validated through the improved operating performance of the Plutonic Gold Mine.\n\nK2 Underground Mineral Resources\n\nThe Mineral Resource Statement for the K2 Underground Mineral Resource estimate was prepared during July 2024 and is reported according to the Australasian Code for Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves (the 'JORC Code') 2012 edition.\n\nThe Mineral Resource estimate includes 81,734 m of drilling from 844 reverse circulation (RC) drill holes and 78 diamond drillholes (DD) including RC holes with diamond tails (RCD, DD/RC) completed since 1990. The depth from surface to the current vertical limit of the K2 Underground Mineral Resources is approximately 250m (390 mRL).\n\nIn the opinion of Catalyst, the resource evaluation reported herein is a reasonable representation of the global gold Mineral Resources within the K2 underground deposit, based on sampling data from RC, RCD, RC/DD and DD drilling available as of 2 May 2024. Mineral Resources are reported below topography and comprise only fresh rock.\n\nThe K2 Underground Mineral Resource (MRE) has been undertaken with a focus on delineating areas of the MRE with Reasonable Prospects for Eventual Economic Extraction (RPEEE) by underground mining methods. The MRE has been constrained within an underground Stope Optimiser (SO) evaluation from the depleted resource model.\n\nSO input parameters include a 1.5 g/t Au cut-off, minimum mining width of 1.5m, minimum stope length of 5m and minimum stope height of 5m. The orientation of SO's is variable depending on the geometry of the mineralisation resource model.\n\nThe entire MRE consists of Indicated and Inferred Mineral Resources. No Measured Mineral Resources have been reported at this stage of the project. The model has been depleted for both historical open pit mining as well as underground development.\n\nThe Mineral Resource Statement is presented in Table 1.\n\nTable 1: K2 MRE\n\nPlutonic East Underground Mineral Resources\n\nThe Mineral Resource Statement for the Plutonic East Underground Mineral Resource estimate was prepared during June 2024 and is reported according to the Australasian Code for Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves (the 'JORC Code') 2012 edition.\n\nThe Mineral Resource estimate includes 288,123m of drilling from 2,301 reverse circulation (RC) drill holes and 1,088 diamond drillholes (DD) and 7,623 Face Samples completed since 1997. The depth from surface to the current vertical limit of the Mineral Resources is approximately 600 m (1110 mRL).\n\nIn the opinion of Catalyst, the resource evaluation reported herein is a reasonable representation of the global gold Mineral Resources within the Plutonic East underground deposit, based on sampling data from Face Samples, RC and DD drilling available as of 6 June 2024. Mineral Resources are reported below topography and comprise only fresh rock. Historic open pit and underground mining depletion has been removed.\n\nThe Plutonic East Underground Mineral Resource (MRE) has been undertaken with a focus on delineating areas of the MRE with Reasonable Prospects for Eventual Economic Extraction (RPEEE) by underground mining methods. The MRE has been constrained within an underground Stope Optimiser (SO) evaluation from the depleted resource model.\n\nSO input parameters include a 1.5 g/t Au cut-off, minimum mining width of 2.5m, minimum stope length of 5m and minimum stope height of 5m. The orientation of SO's is variable depending on the geometry of the mineralisation resource model.\n\nThe entire MRE consists of Indicated and Inferred Mineral Resources. No Measured Mineral Resources have been reported at this stage of the project.\n\nThe Mineral Resource Statement is presented in Table 2.\n\nTable 2: Plutonic East MRE\n\nMINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATE (K2)\n\n1. Drilling Techniques\n\nAll drilling data used in this Mineral Resource Estimate were from Diamond and Reverse Circulation methods.\n\nThe sampling database has been compiled from information collected when the Project was under ownership of numerous companies including (listed from most recent):\n\nCatalyst Metals (2022 to current)\n\nVango (2013 to 2023)\n\nDampier Gold (2012 to 2013)\n\nBarrick Gold (2001 to 2012)\n\nHomestake (1999 to 2001)\n\nResolute (1990 to 1999).\n\nFor the most recent drilling completed by Vango, planned drill hole collars were pegged with a DGPS and marked with wooden pegs hammered into the ground and flagged with high visibility flagging tape.\n\nOn completion of drilling, the actual drill hole collar position is measured by survey staff using a DGPS working off a network control of survey stations, to an accuracy of 20 mm from the nearest survey station. These coordinates replace the planned coordinates in the geological database. All reported coordinates are referenced to grid system MGA_GDA94 Zone 50. The topography is relatively flat at the location of drilling.\n\nThe survey station network meets the Mine Safety and Inspection Regulations 1995, section 3.49, where the accuracy of a survey must be not less than 1:5000.\n\nThe collar locations of historic drill holes were validated from geological logging information from annual reports and the original database when Vango acquired the tenure.\n\nThe majority of drill holes used in the resource estimate have been accurately surveyed by qualified surveyors using DGPS. Downhole surveys have been conducted at regular intervals using industry-standard equipment.\n\nSome magnetic units have affected the azimuth readings where single shot cameras were used and these records have not been used. Many holes have been surveyed using Gyro tools.\n\nAll Vango holes used in the resource estimate have some form of down hole survey. Recent (2023) downhole survey data was collected by Westdrill using an Axis Mining Technology Champ North Seeking Gyro tool. Surveys are conducted at EOH using a north seeking gyroscope reading every 5 m. If early drilling finds strong hole deviation, then surveys are conducted during drilling (collar, 30 m, 60 m, 90 m etc to EOH). Survey deviation is supervised by the geologist onsite, with major deviation discussed with the driller at the time.\n\nPrevious downhole survey data was collected using a REFLEX gyro tool and historically with Eastman cameras, with follow-up downhole surveys carried out by Surtron using gyroscopic survey equipment. Historical downhole surveys were reviewed and verified where information was available through direct comparison within the database.\n\nRecent Vango RC drilling was conducted utilizing 5.75 inch face sampling bit.\n\nDiamond drilling was conducted utilising NQ2 core. Core was orientated by spear methodology.\n\nHistorical Diamond holes utilised PQ3, HQ3 or NQ2 core diameter, RC drilling utilised a 5.5 inch drill bit.\n\n2. Historical Drilling\n\nExtensive previous work has been completed by Resolute Mining, Homestake Gold, Battle Mountain Australia, Barrick Mining and Dampier Gold. Previous metallurgical and resource work has been completed by Resolute Mining, Barrick Mining and Dampier Gold. Quality of historical drilling information is varied, but all of the above companies used high quality methodology at the time.\n\nCatalyst consolidated the belt in 2023 following the successful acquisition of Vango Mining and the merger with Superior Gold Inc.\n\n3. Sampling and Sub-Sampling Techniques\n\nRecent Vango RC drilling assays are from 1 m samples split on the cyclone (using a cone splitter). Each RC sample weighs approximately 3–5 kg. 4 m composites from these 1 m splits are taken in the cover sequence.\n\nVango Diamond drilling assays are from mostly half core and minor quarter core, NQ2 and HQ size core. This is considered to be sufficient material for a representative sample. Core samples were taken at 1 m intervals or at geological boundaries. (between 0.8-1.25 m length) The DD holes were geologically logged to geological boundaries in addition to being structural and geotechnically logged.\n\nRecovery in diamond drilling is based on the measured core returned for each 3 m. RC drilling was bagged on 1 m intervals and an estimate of sample recovery has been made based on the size of each sample.\n\nQAQC protocols include the collection and analysis of field duplicates and the insertion of appropriate commercial standards (certified reference materials) and blank samples. Standards submitted every 20 samples with a tenor similar to those expected in the sampling. Blanks were inserted every 20 samples.\n\n4. Historical Sampling\n\nHistorical RC samples were collected as 4 m composite spear samples. Mineralised zones were sampled at 1 m intervals using a 1/8 riffle splitter.\n\nCore sampled was halved using a diamond saw and sampled at 1 m intervals, or to geological contacts.\n\nField duplicate sampling was completed by passing the bulk reject sample from the plastic bag through a riffle splitter. In addition, ¼ core was routinely submitted. Duplicate sample intervals were designated by the geologist.\n\nNo assessment of RC chip sample recoveries was undertaken on historical data however a comprehensive historical review of sampling procedures was undertaken which indicates that standard procedures where enacted to ensure minimal sample loss. Where information on the recoveries has been recorded, they have been consistent with those noted by recent drilling.\n\nRecovery in diamond drilling based on measured core was returned for each 3 m.\n\nSampling procedures earlier than 2018 were not available.\n\n5. Sample Analysis Method\n\nInformation sourced indicates that several analytical laboratories have been used over the history of the three deposits, and analytical methodologies have varied slightly over time. Typically fire assay with determination by atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS) has been used.\n\nFor the recent Vango drilling, all samples were dried, crushed and pulverised then a 50g charge analysed at Intertek Laboratories using an Industry Standard Fire Assay method. Standards were submitted every 20 samples of grade-range/tenor similar to those expected in the sampling. Blanks were also inserted every 20 samples. Field duplicates also analysed.\n\nStandards and Blanks were reported within acceptable accuracy and precision levels around the expected standard value. The results indicate the fire assay results from Intertek are of sufficient quality to be acceptable for use in resource estimation.\n\nFor the historical drilling gold was analysed using fire assay with a 25-50g charge for Au within mineralised zones. Some Aqua regia data is included in the resources, generally in lower grade, oxide and transition, areas. Drilling programs carried out by (Homestake Gold of Australia Limited) HGAL have included ongoing QAQC procedures. These included the use of certified standards, blanks, check assay and duplicate sampling. The various programs of QAQC carried out by HGAL have all produced results which support the sampling and assaying procedures used at the site.\n\nSpecific QAQC procedures for previous owners were unavailable.\n\nAlthough sample collection, sample preparation, sample logging and analytical techniques have varied over the Project's history, all can be considered as industry standard at the time. The amount of QC data that was collected has also varied over the Project's history, but overall is considered as being acceptable to support the MRE.\n\n6. Geology and Geological Interpretation\n\nRegionally, the Plutonic Gold Belt lies in the Archaean Plutonic Well Greenstone Belt, an elongate NE trending belt within the Marymia Inlier. The Marymia Inlier is an Archaean basement remnant within the Proterozoic Capricorn Orogen and comprises two mineralised greenstone belts (Plutonic Well and Baumgarten greenstone belts), with surrounding granite and gneissic complexes.\n\nThe Marymia Greenstone Belt comprises two corridors of northeast – southwest trending mafic/ultramafic and sedimentary sequences separated by a conglomerate-dominated sedimentary sequence.\n\nThree major structural events are interpreted to have shaped the belt, including D1 low-angle thrusting and isoclinal folding that has emplaced mafic and ultramafic units structurally above the sedimentary units in the northwest side of the belt (\"the overthrust terrane\"), followed by southeast directed upright D2 folding and faulting, granite/porphyry sheet intrusion then D3 high- angle thrusting, open folding of earlier structures plus reactivation of D1/2-thrusts.\n\nThe K2 deposit lies along the northern flank of the Plutonic Well Greenstone Belt within the mining lease M52/183. The geology of the K2 area is dominated by north east- south west trending mafic-ultramafic and sedimentary package which has been metamorphosed to lower amphibolite facies and intensely deformed. Foliation and bedding are generally steeply dipping.\n\nHistorical open pit mining at K2 focused on three lodes developed along the contact between high iron and high magnesian amphibolite units. The mineralised contact is marked by faulting, shearing, brecciation, quartz and quart-carbonate style veining and extensive alteration. The zones of brecciation are rarely mineralised. The main structures at K2 include the north east-south west trending breccia fault, the east striking K2 cross fault and a series of east- south east trending discontinuous faults in the northern portion of the pit.\n\nGold mineralisation at K2 demonstrates a close association with lithological contacts, in particular the sheared contact between high iron and high magnesian amphibolite units. These zones display strong silicification and narrow, en echelon quartz ± carbonate vein arrays in high iron amphibolite units which trend parallel to the main foliation and shear structures. The mineralised lodes are generally thin (2 to 4m wide), steeply dipping (70° to 80°) predominantly to the west and strongly sheared. The mineralised lodes are relatively continuous for several hundred meters along strike and have potential to be extended down dip.\n\nA total of 146,492.7 m of drilling from 120 diamond and diamond tails, 1,297 RC holes, 754 Rotary Air blast (RAB) holes, 12 Air Core (AC) and 3 holes of an unknown type were available for interpretation of the MRE and supported by a nominal drill density of 20 x 20m.\n\nMineralisation domains were interpreted primarily on geological logging and downhole geological contacts, based on lithology, grade distribution, major faults and geometry. Weathering surfaces were created by interpreting the existing drill logging for oxidation state and were extended laterally beyond the limits of the Mineral Resource model.\n\nInterpretations of domain continuity were undertaken in Leapfrog software using all available drillholes. Intercepts correlating to gold mineralisation and underpinned by strike continuity were independently identified and manually selected within Leapfrog prior to creation of an implicit intrusion model. Existing mineralisation wireframes, pit design and site-based observations were used to evaluate geological, structural and mineralisation continuity.\n\nA cut-off grade of 0.2 g/t Au was used to guide the geological continuity of the interpreted mineralisation lodes. Selection of the cut-off grade was based on statistical and spatial analysis of composite data indicating a natural mineralisation population exists above 0.2 g/t Au. Within the mineralised wireframe, if an intercept fell below the nominal cut-off but continuity was supported by host lithologies, the intercept was retained for continuity purposes due to the commodity and the style of deposit.\n\nCYL considers confidence in mineralisation continuity and distribution, as implied within the Mineral Resource estimate classification of Indicated and Inferred, is moderate to high, given the regularised drill pattern, drill centre spacing (20 m) informing these Mineral Resources.\n\nMineralised domains extend approximately 1200 m along strike (9 domains total) to approximately 400 m below surface (220 mRL).\n\n7. Estimation Methodology\n\nAll geological domains used in the K2 MRE were constructed in Leapfrog software. Block modelling and grade interpolation were carried out using Surpac software. Statistical analysis was carried out using Supervisor software.\n\nBlock model constraints were created by applying the interpreted mineralised domain wireframes. Sub-celling in all domains was 1.25 m x 1.25 m x 1.25 m to accurately reflect the volumes of the interpreted wireframes.\n\nAll drillhole assay samples were uniquely flagged according to the mineralisation domains. All drillholes are composited to 1m downhole using a best-fit methodology and 0.5 m minimum threshold on inclusions. All RC and DD samples were composited to 1m downhole using a best-fit methodology and 0.5 m minimum threshold on inclusions. A small number of residual composites were retained in the estimation.\n\nK2 mineralisation is hosted in multiple sub-parallel and sub-vertical tabular lenses ranging in strike length from 150m up to nearly 1,200m in length. The vertical extent of individual lenses can range from around 100m to 400m vertically. The true width of the lenses ranges from 1m to >10m. The K2 July 2024 MRE incorporates the estimation of nine individual mineralised lenses comprising:\n\nK2 – Domains 1001-1005\n\nK2 South East – Domains 2001-2004\n\nThe distribution of gold grades within the mineralised lenses is highly variable and is characterised by distinct cohesive regions of higher tenor gold grades, with clusters of individual values often reaching over thirty grams per tonne. Whilst these higher-grade zones appear reasonably cohesive, they are manifested by a high-degree of short-scale variability, making difficult to manually interpret constraining domains. These internal; high-grade regions are often surrounded by peripheral regions of lower grade mineralisation that is also highly variable.\n\nRaw Coefficients of Variation (CoV) are typically in the order of 2 to 14, indicating moderate to high grade variability.\n\nThe moderate to high grade variability and complex spatial continuity of high grades at K2 requires a pseudo non-linear approach to deal with these high grades during estimation. A traditional approach of physical domaining, assay cutting, and linear estimation (IDW or OK) is considered inadequate in dealing with this complexity.\n\nThe estimation method applied to most of the domains combines Categorical Indicator Kriging (CIK) to define internal estimation sub-domains domains, together with applying distance limiting at chosen grade thresholds to restrict the influence of the high grade and extreme grade values during grade interpolation.\n\nPrior to estimation, a reference surface for each estimation domain was exported from the Leapfrog. This is calculated as the best fit surface using the hangingwall and footwall surfaces. The reference surface is then imported into Surpac and a dip and dip-direction of each triangle facets is imported into the Surpac block model to provide information for dynamic search and variogram model orientation during interpolation. Dynamic estimation is applied for estimating the CIK indicators and gold grades.\n\n8. Categorical Indicator Kriging Workflow\n\nTwo Categorical Indicator values are determined for the CIK domains:\n\nA low-grade (LG) indicator of 0.2 g/t Au was assigned to differentiate between background 'waste' and low-tenor mineralisation.\n\nA high-grade (HG) indicator of 1.4 g/t Au was assigned to define broad areas of consistent higher-tenor mineralisation.\n\nIndicator variograms were modelled for the LG and HG thresholds for all mine areas. The indicator variograms for both grade thresholds exhibited a moderate nugget effect of around 30%. The LG indicator demonstrated well-structured average continuity of up to 80m. The HG indicator demonstrated less well-structured average continuity of around 20m.\n\nThe CIK indicators were estimated using Ordinary Kriging into a finely gridded block model with block dimensions of 1.25m x 1.25m x 1.25m. The small block size for the indicator process is beneficial for creating categorical sub-domains at resolution which can be used to accurately back-flag composite data.\n\nThree categorical sub-domains were generated: low-grade (LG), medium-grade (MG) and high-grade (HG) areas. The HG sub-domain was based on an indicator probability threshold of 0.35 and the LG sub-domain was based on an indicator probability threshold of 0.65. The MG sub-domain is assigned to blocks that do not satisfy either the HG or LG sub-domain criteria.\n\nThe three categorical block model sub-domains (HG, MG and LG) were used to 'back-flag' the 1m composites from each mine area, thus creating a separate composite file for each sub-domain.\n\nAssay top-cuts are applied to the sub-domain composite files on a domain-by-domain basis and typically in the following ranges:\n\nHG = 15-75 g/t Au\n\nMG = 5-10 g/t Au\n\nLG = 0.5-3 g/t Au\n\nThe assay top-cuts were generally between the 97th to 99.9th percentile of the distribution and were aimed at globally limiting extreme values only. Top-cuts are not used as the primary tool to control metal risk. The use of grade thresholds and distance limiting is considered a more objective and influential method in controlling metal risk, while better reflecting the actual localised occurrence of discontinuous high-grade gold mineralisation.\n\nGrade variograms were initially attempted separately for the LG, MG and HG sub-domains, however, this resulted in poorly structured and incoherent variograms. It was decided to use a variogram modelled on the combined grade data set. The combined grade variogram exhibited a moderate nugget effect of 35% with a maximum range of continuity of 45m.\n\nGrade thresholds for distance limiting were initially determined for each mine area from log-probability plots and visual inspection. Final distance limits were subsequently optimised following a detailed backward-looking mill reconciliation using historic open pit mining during the period July 1992 to December 1995 (964Kt). The adjustment of grade distance limits was an iterative process until an acceptable reconciliation with the mill was achieved. The final applied grade distance limits are follows:\n\n0-10 g/t = No Limit\n\n10-30 g/t = 20m\n\n>30 g/t = 12.5m\n\nPrior to grade estimation, sub-domain codes from the 1.25m resolution block model are imported into a 2.5m x 2.5m x 2.5m resolution model and the proportion of LG, MG and HG is calculated for each 2.5m block. Grade estimation for the LG, MG and HG domains was undertaken in Surpac software using Ordinary Kriging with grade threshold distance limiting. Kriging Neighbourhood Analysis (KNA) was undertaken to assist with defining estimation parameters. Search routines and variogram orientations are drawn from the pre-populated dynamic search information recorded in each block.\n\nFinal block grades at a 2.5m x 2.5m x 2.5m block resolution were calculated by weighting the estimated grades for each sub-domain by the relevant domain proportion. The parent estimation block size was 2.5m x 2.5m x 2.5m. A minimum of 2 and maximum of 12 composites were used for each sub-domain estimate per block. It is possible that up to 36 composites can be used to estimate a parent block where there is a proportion of all three sib-domains present. Block discretisation was set at 3 E x 3 N x 3 RL points (per parent block). A standardised single pass search distance of 45m was used. Octant restrictions were not used. Data spacing varied from <10m x 10m to >40m x 40m.\n\nModel validation was completed to check that the grade estimates within the model were an appropriate reflection of the underlying composite sample data, and to confirm that the interpolation parameters were applied as intended. Checks of the estimated block grade with the corresponding composite dataset were completed using several approaches involving both numerical and spatial aspects as follows:\n\nSemi-Local: Using swath plots in X, Y and Z directions comparing the estimates to the sample data.\n\nLocal: Visual inspection of the estimated block grades viewed in conjunction with the sample data.\n\n9. Bulk Density\n\nDensity has been assigned to the resource using interpreted weathering surfaces determined from drill hole logging. Bulk density was coded by oxidation type:\n\nOxide = 1.8 t/m3\n\nTransitional = 2.2 t/m3\n\nFresh = 2.9 t/m3\n\n10. Classification Criteria\n\nMineral Resources were classified as Indicated and Inferred to appropriately represent confidence and risk with respect to data quality, drill hole spacing, geological and grade continuity and mineralisation volumes. Additional considerations were the stage of project assessment, amount of RC drilling undertaken, current understanding of mineralisation controls and mining selectivity within an open pit mining environment.\n\nThe drilling, surveying and sampling undertaken, and analytical methods and quality controls used, are appropriate for the style of deposit under consideration.\n\nIndicated Mineral Resources were defined where a moderate level of geological confidence in geometry, continuity and grade was demonstrated, and were identified as areas where:\n\nThe portions of the K2 MRE classified as Indicated have been flagged in areas of the model where average drill hole spacing is typically 20m x 20m or closer. The drill spacing within the Indicated portion of the resource is appropriate for defining the continuity and volume of the mineralised domains, at a nominal 20 m drill spacing on 20 m sections.\n\nBlocks were interpolated with a neighbourhood largely informed by the maximum number of samples.\n\nInferred Mineral Resources were defined where a low to moderate level of geological confidence in geometry, continuity and grade was demonstrated, and were identified as areas where:\n\nThe portions of the MRE classified as Inferred typically represent minor lodes or portions of larger domains where geological continuity is present but not consistently confirmed by 20 m x 20 m drilling.\n\nFurther considerations of resource classification include; data type and quality (drilling type, drilling orientations, down hole surveys, sampling and assaying methods); geological confidence and geostatistical considerations.\n\nA final reportable classification is generated post creation of a Stope Optimiser (SO) outcome used for RPEEE. Each SO is assigned a classification based on majority reporting by tonnes of the raw classification scheme.\n\nMineralisation within the model which did not satisfy the criteria for classification as Mineral Resources remained unclassified.\n\nThe delineation of Indicated and Inferred Mineral Resources appropriately reflects the Competent Person's view on continuity and risk at the deposit.\n\n11. Cut-off Grade\n\nThe K2 underground Mineral Resources is reported at a cut-off grade of 1.5 g/t Au. The cut-off grade has been derived from current mining and processing costs and metallurgical parameters. Inputs into the cut-off grade calculation include:\n\nAverage Mining Cost = AUD$86.93/t\n\nProcessing and Other Costs = AUD$55/t ore\n\nMetallurgical Recovery = 92%\n\nRoyalties = 2.5%\n\nGold Price = AUD$3,200/oz\n\nIn addition to applying a cut-off grade of 1.5 g/t Au, the MRE has been reported within an underground Stope Optimiser (SO) evaluation from the undiluted resource model. SO input parameters include a minimum mining width of 1.5m, minimum stope length of 5m and minimum stope height of 5m.\n\n12. Assessment of Reasonable Prospects for Eventual Economic Extraction\n\nThe K2 Underground Mineral Resource (MRE) has been undertaken with a focus on delineating areas of the MRE with Reasonable Prospects for Eventual Economic Extraction (RPEEE) by underground mining methods. The MRE has been constrained within an underground Stope Optimiser (SO) evaluation from the depleted resource model.\n\nSO input parameters include a 1.5 g/t Au cut-off, minimum mining width of 1.5m, minimum stope length of 5m and minimum stope height of 5m. The orientation of SO's is variable depending on the geometry of the mineralisation.\n\nThe Mineral Resource is considered to have reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction (RPEEE) given the access to critical infrastructure, the volume and grade of mineralisation available for mining and the RPEEE criteria which have been applied prior to reporting the Mineral Resource.\n\n13. Mining and Depletion\n\nHistorical mining has been undertaken at K2 by Resolute Mining as part of their Marymia Project.\n\nBetween the period of 1992 to 1995 the K2 open pit produced 964,000t of ore grading 4g/t Au for approximately 124,600oz of contained gold mined.\n\nDecline development commenced at K2 Deeps in 1996 from the base of the K2 Open Pit. The decline produced a total of 3,700t of ore grading 1.9g/t Au for 226oz of contained gold when the operation was closed in 1998.\n\nNo dilution or cost factors were applied to the estimate.\n\n14. Metallurgy\n\nPlutonic is an operating mine and there are no material metallurgical issues that are known to exist.\n\nNo metallurgical recovery factors were applied to the Mineral Resources or resource tabulations.\n\nMINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATE (PLUTONIC EAST)\n\n1. Drilling Techniques\n\nOver its 33-year production history, the Plutonic deposit has been sampled using numerous drilling and sampling techniques by Catalyst Metals Limited and previous operators. Drilling and sampling techniques by previous operators is assumed to be to industry standard at that time.\n\nThe sampling database has been compiled from information collected when the Project was under ownership of numerous companies including (listed from most recent):\n\nCatalyst Metals (2023 to current)\n\nSuperior Gold (2016 to 2023)\n\nNorthern Star (2014 to 2016)\n\nBarrick Gold (2001 to 2014)\n\nHomestake (1999 to 2001)\n\nResolute (1994 to 1999)\n\nBattle Mountain Australia Inc. (Pre 1994)\n\nInco (1969-1971 and 1972-1976)\n\nFor Mineral Resource estimation, the Plutonic East area has been based on diamond drilling (DD) from surface and underground platforms, reverse circulation (RC)and underground rock chip face samples (FS).\n\nDiamond core diameters include BQ (36.4 mm), BTW (42 mm), LTK60 (43.9 mm), NQ (47.6 mm), NQ2 (50.7 mm). RC holes were drilled with face hammers and were sampled at one metre down hole intervals. Face chip samples are completed by the mine geologists. The sampling is taken by chipping the face into calico bags with definition by lithological boundaries.\n\nUnderground hole collar locations are picked up regularly by site surveyors. Multi-shot cameras are used for down-hole survey. Face chip samples are spatially positioned within underground development voids which are picked up regularly by site surveyors.\n\n2. Historical Drilling\n\n1969-1976 – International Nickel Company (Inco) conducted nickel exploration using geochemistry, geophysics, costeaning, RAB and RC drilling.\n\n1987 – Great Central Mines (GCM) identified an arsenic and gold anomaly by geochemical sampling in the Plutonic tenements.\n\n1987-1993 – Battle Mountain Australia (BMA) undertook regional mapping, Bulk Leach Extractable Gold (BLEG) soil sampling, and RAB drilling. The Triple P, Pelican, Albatross and Flamingo deposits were discovered in 1992. Further RAB, AC, RC and DD programs were conducted to define these deposits.\n\n1988-1994 - Resolute Resources Ltd (75%) and Titan Resources NL (25%) commenced exploration on the Marymia tenements. Gold mineralisation was discovered in the Keillor Shear Zone following regional exploration soil, stream sediment and rock chip sampling and geological mapping. Several phases of follow-up RAB, AC, RC and DD drilling was carried out. K1 deposit was discovered in 1989. Prospect scale geophysical surveys including magnetics and gradient array IP were undertaken between 1989 and 1994.\n\n1990 – GCM carried follow up grid-based mapping, soil and lag geochemical surveys which led to the discovery of the Plutonic deposit.\n\n1990 – GCM discovered satellite deposits at Area4 and Channel. Both were mined by open pit between 1999 and 2001.\n\n1990-1995 – Plutonic Resources exploration division carried out exploration on the Freshwater tenements and discovered a total of 1 underground and 30 surface prospects. Follow up resource definition drilling resulted in conversion of these prospects to 10 open pits and one underground mine, including Area 4 open pit, Plutonic East underground deposit, Salmon, Trout and Perch.\n\n1999-2004 - Homestake Gold of Australia undertook a detailed aeromagnetic and radiometric survey over the entire lease area. Additional IP and moving loop geophysical surveys were undertaken between 2000 and 2004 across several prospects. The largest of which was across the K1-K2 project area in 2004.\n\n2004 - the Plutonic Development department undertook a large soil sampling programme over the northwestern end of the Marymia tenements, in conjunction with the IP survey. These surveys identified a number of targets that were followed up with some additional surface geochemical sampling.\n\n2001-2007 - exploration and resource definition drilling by RAB, RC and diamond core drilling was undertaken by the Plutonic Development department across numerous prospects outside of the Plutonic Mine area. Many of these drilled prospects were proven up to become small satellite open pit mines such as Triple P B-Zone, Albatross, Flamingo, Kookaburra, Ibis, Piranha, to name a few.\n\n2009-2012 - RC and diamond core drilling concentrated on extensions to the known Plutonic deposit. Outside of this area two 2D seismic lines were shot in conjunction with Curtin University and diamond core drill was undertaken at Plutonic West and Cod prospects.\n\n3. Sampling and Sub-Sampling Techniques\n\nExploration DD core is sawn in half along the orientation lines, with half the sample being submitted for assay and the remaining half being retained for reference. Grade control DD core is whole core sampled and sent for analysis. DD core samples were taken at 1 m intervals or at geological boundaries.\n\nRC samples were collected for each metre drilled and passed through a cyclone and riffle splitter to produce a two kg to four kg assay into calico bags.\n\nRock chip FS are completed by the mine geologists. The sampling is taken by chipping the face into calico bags with definition by lithological boundaries. FS samples are taken perpendicular to the lode orientation in the face. The face sample locations are marked up and measured from fixed survey points.\n\nDD recovery is not noted specifically, though the core is jig sawed back together, and meter marked carefully. Discrepancies to core blocks are brought up with the drill contractor. Occasionally core loss blocks are inserted. Overall drill core recovery is very high due to the competent nature of the ground.\n\nRock chip FS recoveries are not relevant in this instance.\n\n4. Historical Sampling\n\nThe Plutonic Gold Mine has been in operation since 1990 following discovery in 1988. QAQC procedures have changed throughout that period. The current underground Mineral Resources have been identified over a long period of time with a number of companies. All high confidence Mineral Resources are based dominantly on underground DD and FS completed in the last 14 years. Drilling and sampling techniques by previous operators is assumed to be to industry standard at that time.\n\n5. Sample Analysis Method\n\nIn recent years, for DD and FS, gold concentration is determined by fire assay using the lead collection technique with a 40gm sample charge weight. An AAS (Plutonic site laboratory) or ICP (ALS and Bureau Veritas) finish. A Pulverising and Leach (PAL) method was introduced to the Plutonic site laboratory in 2005. Underground GC samples are initially assayed by PAL and where the result is greater than 0.5 g/t Au the sample is re-analysed by 40gm fire assay and the fire assay result is retained for grade estimation purposes. It has been shown that the use of PAL assays is likely to have negligible influence on the Mineral Resource.\n\nSample preparation procedures for DD and FS includes:\n\n1-4 hours drying at 150°C depending on moisture content;\n\nCrush 85% < 3mm – Essa jaw crusher or rotary Boyd crusher;\n\nRiffle split 50:50 to<1kg;\n\nPulverise ~700-750g to 90% passing 75μm in Labtechnics LM2;\n\nScoop 250-300g.\n\nScoop to subset to 40gm for fire assay.\n\nQuality control procedures for DD and FS includes:\n\nFS – blanks added to each face sample with ore zones;\n\nDD –barren wash and blanks added after each ore interval;\n\nCrusher duplicates taken at 1:40;\n\nPulp duplicates taken at 1:40.\n\nSample preparation protocols and sample sizes are considered appropriate for the style of mineralisation encountered and should provide representative results.\n\nCertified Reference Material (CRM's) are submitted every 20 samples for DD and once per shift for FS (approx. 1 in 15 samples). CRM's are of similar grade tenor to those expected in the sampling. The CRM insertion rate ensures that there are at least two CRM's per assay batch. CRM's are selected based on their grade range and mineralogical properties with an emphasis on sulphide ores.\n\nBlanks are inserted every 20 samples for DD and for FS they are inserted after any face that contains mineralisation.\n\nThe Plutonic Gold Mine has been in operation since 1990 following discovery in 1988. QAQC procedures have changed throughout that period. The current underground Mineral Resources have been identified over a long period of time with a number of companies. All high confidence Mineral Resources are based dominantly on underground DD and FS completed in the last 14 years.\n\nA comprehensive review of the QAQC results was undertaken for both the 2022 and 2023 MRE updates of the Plutonic Underground by Superior Gold and Cube Consulting respectively.\n\nConclusions from the 2022 MRE Qualified Person include:\n\nOverall performance of the Plutonic site and external laboratory (ALS) are adequate for estimating and reporting Mineral Resources for the Plutonic underground operations despite some minor shortcomings in the site laboratory;\n\nThe accuracy of the laboratories is within 3% error;\n\nThe variance of the laboratories (precision) based on CRM's is acceptable for underground production purposes;\n\nBoth ALS and Plutonic laboratories performed well on precision and accuracy with ALS lab slightly better precision;\n\nCoarse duplicates revealed relative errors at 20% for samples with Au >7 g/t and 30% relative errors for samples with Au between 3 and 7 g/t;\n\n50% of the errors of the coarse duplicates may have been caused by a coarse gold nugget effect. The remaining errors were likely caused by contamination, other laboratory procedure breaches and human error.\n\nConclusions from the 2023 MRE Competent Person include:\n\nResults indicate that the QAQC performance is sufficient for using the data for an underground Mineral Resource Estimate;\n\nElement of risk in using PAL due to incomplete digestion;\n\nSite laboratory performance (the majority of the samples) is poorer than off-site commercial laboratories (ALS and Bureau Veritas) due to contamination and percentage of CRM failure;\n\nSite laboratory shows poorer performance at low levels of Au (0.4 - 0.8 g/t), but effect on underground Mineral Resources likely to be minimal;\n\nPrecision of CRMs for site laboratory poorer than manufacturer.\n\nNo review of the QAQC results at Plutonic East were undertaken by CYL during this MRE.\n\n6. Geology and Geological Interpretation\n\nThe Plutonic gold deposit is located within the Archaean Plutonic Well Greenstone Belt, an elongate NE trending belt within the Marymia Inlier. The Marymia Inlier is an Archaean basement remnant within the Proterozoic Capricorn Orogen, and comprises two mineralised greenstone belts (Plutonic Well and Baumgarten greenstone belts), with surrounding granite and gneissic complexes. The Capricorn Orogen is situated between the Pilbara and Yilgarn cratons and is interpreted to be the result of the oblique collision of these two Archaean cratons in the early Proterozoic.\n\nGold mineralisation occurs in a large number of deposits and prospects in the Belt, with the main deposit at the Plutonic Gold Mine. Mineralisation regularly occurs as shallowly dipping, layer parallel lodes, although steep lodes and minor quartz-vein-hosted deposits also occur. Regionally within the greenstone belt, mineralised host rocks vary from amphibolites to ultramafics and banded iron formation (BIF). Lateritic and supergene enrichment are common throughout the Belt and has been mined locally. Biotite, arsenopyrite, and lesser pyrite/pyrrhotite are common minerals generally accepted to be associated with gold mineralisation.\n\nMineralisation at Plutonic East is characterised by a series of steep to flat-lying, stacked replacement-style lodes, individually up to five metres wide that are hosted within ductile shear zones oriented slightly oblique to stratigraphy. Lodes are preferentially restricted within the top half of the Mine Mafic, which is a sequence of upper-greenschist to lower amphibolite grade basaltic flows of variable thickness sandwiched between the hanging wall and footwall ultramafic units. Lodes are characterised by intense banding, defined by crude mineral segregation and mineral alignment. Gold where visible, is commonly associated with grey quartz veins and fine-grained arsenopyrite and pyrrhotite.\n\nThe main style of gold mineralisation (Plutonic brown-lode) typically occurs as thin (~1 – 3 m wide) lodes that consist predominantly of quartz-biotite-amphibole-titanite-epidote-carbonate-tourmaline-arsenopyrite-pyrrhotite ± chalcopyrite ± scheelite ± gold. Visible gold is considered to have occurred at a late-stage during the evolution of the deposit as it is largely undeformed and overprints most, if not all, of the minerals and fabrics. It is typically associated with thin, discontinuous quartz-calc-silicate veins within the brown-lodes. Where these gold-bearing zones are well developed, they tend to be near-parallel to the stratigraphy as marked by the rare metasedimentary horizons and to the dominant foliation, which is also typically parallel to metasediment horizons. Geochemistry suggests that these lodes developed on the boundary between mafic units or are focused along or adjacent to minor metasedimentary units within the Mine Mafic unit. Lodes may be rich in arsenopyrite or pyrrhotite, and while arsenopyrite is a good indicator of mineralisation, it may not be present in all mineralisation.\n\nMineralisation domains were interpreted primarily on geological logging and downhole geological contacts, based on lithology, grade distribution, major faults and geometry.\n\nWeathering surfaces were created by interpreting the existing drill logging for oxidation state and were extended laterally beyond the limits of the Mineral Resource model.\n\nFour lithological units containing the bulk of Plutonic East mineralisation were interpretated:\n\nOverthrust Mafic – OTM\n\nUpper Ultramafic – UM1\n\nMine Mafic – MMA\n\nLower Ultramafic – UM2\n\nThese four lithological units form the basis of the primary estimation domains. Interpretations of the lithological units were undertaken in Leapfrog software using all available data.\n\n7. Estimation Methodology\n\nGold mineralisation at Plutonic East exhibits very similar style and spatial behaviour to that observed at the Plutonic mine located approximately 4km to the west. Indeed, the bulk of Plutonic East mineralisation is hosted in the same Mine Mafic (MMA) unit that hosts almost the entire Plutonic deposit.\n\nApproximately 94% of economic gold mineralisation at Plutonic East is hosted within the Mine Mafic Unit (MMA). Plutonic East mineralisation is characterised by a significant population of high to extreme gold grades that demonstrate very poor spatial continuity (only a few meters at best). Raw Coefficients of Variation (CoV) are typically in the order of 8-27, indicating extreme statistical variability.\n\nThe estimation approach adopted for Plutonic East was identical to that used for the November 2023 Plutonic MRE. Four primary domains were separately estimated for Plutonic East:\n\nMine Mafic Unit (MMA-1000)\n\nUpper Ultramafic Unit (UM1 – 2000)\n\nLower Ultramafic Unit (UM2 – 3000)\n\nOverthrust Mafic Unit (OTM – 4000)\n\nGiven the similarities to the nearby Plutonic mine, most of the estimation parameters were applied as the average of parameters used for the November 2023 Plutonic MRE.\n\nThe estimation method developed for the MRE combines Categorical Indicator Kriging (CIK) to define broad estimation domains, together with applying distance limiting at chosen grade thresholds to restrict the influence of the high grade and extreme grade values during grade interpolation.\n\nPrior to estimation, a closely spaced set of structural surfaces are developed in LeapFrog reflecting the primary controls on mineralisation within the primary lithological units. A dip and dip-direction of each triangle facets is imported into the Surpac block model to provide information for dynamic search and variogram model orientation during grade interpolation. Dynamic estimation is applied for estimating the CIK indicators and gold grades.\n\nAll DD and FS data are composited to 1m downhole and data within dolerite dykes or vein zones are removed. Composited data was split into the eight mine areas.\n\nTwo Categorical Indicator values are determined for each mine area:\n\nA low-grade (LG) indicator to differentiate between background 'waste' and low-tenor mineralisation – 0.5 g/t Au.\n\nA high-grade (HG) indicator to define broad areas of higher-tenor mineralisation – 1.4 g/t Au.\n\nIndicator variograms were modelled for the LG and HG thresholds for all mine areas. The indicator variograms for both grade thresholds exhibited a moderate nugget effect and demonstrated well-structured continuity up to 30m. The CIK indicators were estimated using Ordinary Kriging into a finely gridded block model with block dimensions of 1.25m x 1.25m x 1.25m. The small block size for the indicator process is beneficial for creating categorical sub-domains at resolution which can be used to accurately back-flag composite data.\n\nThree categorical sub-domains were generated for low-grade (LG), medium-grade (MG) and high-grade (HG) areas. The HG sub-domain was based on an indicator probability threshold of 0.35 and the LG sub-domain was based on an indicator probability threshold of 0.65. The MG sub-domain is assigned to blocks that do not satisfy either the HG or LG sub-domain criteria.\n\nThe three categorical block model sub-domains (HG, MG and LG) were used to 'back-flag' the 1m composites from each mine area, thus creating a separate composite file for each sub-domain.\n\nStandardised assay top-cuts are applied to the composite files for each domain area as follows:\n\nThe assay top-cuts were generally above the 99th percentile of the distribution and were aimed at globally limiting extreme values only. Top-cuts are not used as the primary tool to control metal risk. The use of grade thresholds and distance limiting is considered a more objective and influential method in controlling metal risk, while better reflecting the actual localised occurrence of discontinuous high-grade gold mineralisation.\n\nGiven the similar spatial characteristics of mineralisation between Plutonic East and the Plutonic Mine, it was decided to use average grade variogram values modelled for the LG, MG and HG sub-domains for all mine areas from the Plutonic November 2023 MRE.\n\nThe HG grade variograms exhibited a very high nugget effect (average 79%) with maximum ranges of only a few meters (average 3.4m). Grade variography undertaken on the HG domain confirms the extremely variable nature of Plutonic and Plutonic East mineralisation. Grade variography on the MG and LG domains resulted in lower nuggets effects and longer ranges.\n\nGrade thresholds for distance limiting were also applied using averages from the Plutonic November 2023 MRE. Grade thresholds and distance limits from the Plutonic November 2023 MRE were optimised following a detailed backward-looking mill reconciliation using mine stope voids for the period January 2023 to August 2023 (550Kt).\n\nThe final applied grade distance limits for Plutonic East are follows:\n\n0-8 g/t = No Limit\n\n8-70 g/t = 10m\n\n>70 g/t = 5.5m\n\nPrior to grade estimation, sub-domain codes from the 1.25m resolution block model are imported into a 2.5m x 2.5m x 2.5m resolution model and the proportion of LG, MG and HG is calculated for each 2.5m block. Grade estimation for the LG, MG and HG domains was undertaken in Surpac software using Ordinary Kriging with grade threshold distance limiting. Kriging Neighbourhood Analysis (KNA) was undertaken to assist with defining estimation parameters. Search routines and variogram orientations are drawn from the pre-populated dynamic search information recorded in each block.\n\nFinal block grades at a 2.5m block resolution were calculated by weighting the estimated grades for each sub-domain by the relevant domain proportion.\n\nThe parent estimation block size was 2.5m x 2.5m x 2.5m. A minimum of 3 and maximum of 12 (1 m composite) samples per block were used. It is possible that up to 36 composites can be used to estimate a parent block where there is a proportion of all three sub-domains present. Block discretisation was set at 3 E x 3 N x 3 RL points (per parent block).\n\nA standardised search ellipse of 25m x 25m x 6.25m was used. Octant restrictions were not used.\n\nTypical data spacing varied from 3m x 3m to >40m x 40m.\n\nThe model was validated by comparing statistics of the estimated blocks against the composited sample data; visual examination of the of the block grades versus assay data in section; swath plots; and reconciliation against previous production.\n\n8. Bulk Density\n\nBulk density is determined from drill core using a weight in air/weight in water method. Currently there is a database of over 3,800 bulk density measurements which have been taken from mineralised and unmineralised intervals, with an ongoing sampling program in place.\n\nSamples of between 0.5 and 2.0kg are weighed in air and weighed in water. The following equation is used to derive bulk density Bulk Density = 𝑊𝑑 / (𝑊𝑑−𝑊𝑤).\n\nBulk density was directly assigned by oxidation type and rock type:\n\nFresh MMA and Ultramafic = 2.9 t/m3\n\nTransitional MMA and Ultramafic = 2.2 t/m3\n\nOxide MMA and Ultramafic = 1.8 t/m3\n\nPit Backfill and Surface Dumps = 1.8 t/m3\n\nMining depletion to July 31st 2024 was applied to the model. Mining depletion is represented (at a 1.25m subcell size) through both a depletion inside all surveyed cavities and a reset to background of estimated grades within in a 2.5m skin around all historic stopes. Additionally, density has been modified for portions of any subcell that contacts a surveyed void by way of void proportion attribute.\n\n9. Classification Criteria\n\nThe Mineral Resource has been classified following due consideration of all criteria contained in Section 1, Section 2 and Section 3 of JORC 2012 Table 1.\n\nThe supplied drilling database represents an appropriate record of the drilling and sampling undertaken at the project. In general drilling, surveying, sampling, analytical methods and controls are considered appropriate for the style of mineralisation under consideration.\n\nThe continuity and volume of the mineralised domains has been established by surface and underground diamond drilling, together with extensive underground development and production history.\n\nThe estimation method and the associated search and interpolation parameters used are considered appropriate for estimation of the Mineral Resources and have been calibrated to recent production reconciliation.\n\nThe Competent Person has considered all the relevant criteria and has classified the estimated Mineral Resources as Indicated and Inferred Mineral Resource.\n\nDue to the high degree of grade variability and short-scale continuity of mineralisation, the portions of the MRE classified as Indicated are typically based on data spacing (DD and FS) less than or equal to 15m x 15 m and located within close proximity to underground development. This drill spacing is appropriate for defining the continuity and volume of the mineralised domains and estimating robust global Mineral Resources.\n\nThe portions of the MRE classified as Inferred typically represent peripheral areas of the deposit where geological continuity is present but not consistently confirmed by 15 m x 15 m drilling or closer.\n\nFurther considerations of resource classification include; data type and quality, geological understanding, amount of historical development and stoping, and historical and recent production reconciliation performance.\n\nA final reportable classification is generated post creation of a Stope Optimiser (SO) outcome used for RPEEE. Each SO is assigned a classification based on majority reporting by tonnes of the raw classification scheme.\n\nThe Mineral Resource classification appropriately reflects the view of the Competent Person.\n\n10. Cut-off Grade\n\nThe Plutonic East Underground Mineral Resources is reported at a cut-off grade of 1.5 g/t Au. The cut-off grade has been derived from current mining and processing costs and metallurgical parameters. Inputs into the cut-off grade calculation include:\n\nAverage Mining Cost = AUD$85.20/t\n\nProcessing and Other Costs = AUD$40/t ore\n\nMetallurgical Recovery = 86%\n\nRoyalties = 2.5%\n\nGold Price = AUD$3,200/oz\n\nIn addition to applying a cut-off grade of 1.5 g/t Au, the Mineral Resource has been reported within an underground Stope Optimiser (SO) evaluation from the undiluted and depleted resource model. SO input parameters include a minimum mining width of 2.5m, minimum stope length of 5m, minimum stope height of 5m.\n\n11. Assessment of Reasonable Prospects for Eventual Economic Extraction\n\nThe Plutonic East Underground Mineral Resource (MRE) has been undertaken with a focus on delineating areas of the MRE with Reasonable Prospects for Eventual Economic Extraction (RPEEE) by underground mining methods. The MRE has been constrained within an underground Shape Optimiser (SO) evaluation from the depleted resource model.\n\nSO input parameters include a 1.5 g/t Au cut-off, minimum mining width of 2.5m, minimum stope length of 5m and minimum stope height of 5m. The orientation of SO's is variable depending on the geometry of the mineralisation resource model.\n\nThe Mineral Resource is considered to have reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction (RPEEE) given the access to critical infrastructure, the volume and grade of mineralisation available for mining and the RPEEE criteria which have been applied prior to reporting the Mineral Resource.\n\n12. Mining and Depletion\n\nMining depletion to July 31, 2024, was applied to the model.\n\nMining depletion is represented (at a 1.25m subcell size) through both a depletion inside all surveyed cavities and a reset to background of estimated grades within in a 2.5m skin around all historic stopes.\n\n13. Metallurgy\n\nPlutonic is an operating mine and there are no material metallurgical issues that are known to exist.\n\nNo metallurgical recovery factors were applied to the Mineral Resources or resource tabulations.\n\nThis announcement has been approved for release by the Board of Directors of Catalyst Metals Limited.\n\nCompetent person's statement\n\nThe information in the report to which this Mineral Resource Statement is attached that relates to the estimation and reporting of gold Mineral Resources at the Plutonic East underground deposit and the K2 deposit is based on information compiled by Mr Andrew Finch, BSc, a Competent Person who is a current Member of Australian Institute of Geoscientists (MAIG 3827).
