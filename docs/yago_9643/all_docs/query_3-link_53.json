        "text": "“Drillbit Taylor”\n\nAs the titular homeless hustler hired by three McKinley High freshman to be their bodyguard, Owen Wilson often gives the camera something touching to work with. Concave-chested Wade (Nate Hartley) and pudgy pal Ryan (Troy Gentile) are likable best friends in what feels like a “Superbad” knock-off for the PG-13 set. David Dorfman is Emmit, the geeky minnow even more vulnerable to bullying than Wade and Ryan. Leslie Mann is the teacher taken with Drillbit’s substitute-teacher guise. The school’s predators are played by Alex Frost and Josh Peck. Which leads us to a bedeviling problem: Frost’s feral portrayal bullies the comedy. His sociopath really belongs in another movie. PG-13. 1 hour, 42 minutes. Released today. Lisa Kennedy\n\n“Vantage Point”\n\nFear not the eight viewpoints of an act of terror “Vantage Point” delivers. This involving thriller — anchored by Dennis Quaid, Forest Whitaker, William Hurt and Sigourney Weaver — doesn’t resort to hand-held subjective angles. But it does return to the scene of the crime again and again, uncovering with heated pacing, who’s responsible for an attack on the president’s double (Hurt) during a historic announcement on the “war on terror,” in Spain. Screenwriter Barry L. Levy and director Pete Travis (the latter made a TV film about an IRA bombing) pepper this action foray with thorny ideas about U.S. arrogance and ideals. PG-13. 1 hour, 30 minutes. Released today Lisa Kennedy\n\n“City of Men”\n\nHow a cycle of absent fathers has produced multiple generations of lost boys in squalid Rio de Janeiro. Douglas Silva and Darlan Cunha play lifelong friends who have grown up on Dead End Hill, purposely avoiding the gang warfare that punctuates their lives. Ace has a young son but has no idea how to be a father to him. Meanwhile, Wallace, about to turn 18, decides to track down the dad he never knew. It turns out that the fathers of these young men were once connected and that the sins of the fathers threaten the tight bond between the sons. R. 1 hour, 50 minutes. Released today.
