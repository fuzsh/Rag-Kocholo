        "text": "The two giraffes playing doubles drew an overflow crowd to Court 10 at the United States Open. Sam Querrey and John Isner stand taller than 6 feet 6 inches, but it was their pairing, not their passing resemblance to an N.B.A. frontcourt, that rendered them a curiosity.\n\nRarely anymore does one see two prospering singles players like Querrey and the 6-9 Isner moonlighting in doubles in a Grand Slam event, the era of all-purpose players long ago having given way to specialists.\n\nThe pair advanced to the second round Wednesday with a straight-sets victory over the Americans Wayne Odesnik and Michael Shabaz. The match took 63 minutes, roughly the time they would have spent on the court preparing for their Thursday singles matches, which is the whole point.\n\n“If I wasn’t playing doubles,” Querrey said, “I’d be going out and practicing for an hour, so I might as well play a match.”\n\nFew of the top players share the view of the 21-year-old Querrey, the hottest player during the summer hardcourt season. The days of singles superstars like Martina Navratilova and John McEnroe doubling their workloads at Grand Slam tournaments became a casualty of the power age ushered in by the steel-framed Wilson T-2000 racket.\n\nThe shift from wooden rackets created a surge in backcourt specialists who took pleasure in beating the air out of the ball and in operations on joints that buckled under all the pounding. Neither development did doubles much good.\n\n“As the game has gotten more physical, obviously as more money has gotten into the game, there’s more at stake for the top singles guys,” the ESPN commentator Patrick McEnroe said. “They don’t want to take any chance of losing an edge by playing a doubles match.”\n\nIn 1991, Patrick McEnroe advanced to the finals of the doubles and the semifinals of the singles, a feat matched  indeed, surpassed  in today’s game only by Serena and Venus Williams. At Wimbledon this year, the sisters met in the singles final and won the doubles crown. In the year’s first major, the Australian Open, Serena won the singles title and teamed with Venus to capture the doubles crown.\n\nOn Thursday afternoon, the Williamses began their pursuit of a 10th Grand Slam doubles title with a 6-2, 6-2 victory against Julia Goerges and Arantxa Parra Santonja. It was a quick turnaround for Serena, who on Wednesday did not leave the U.S.T.A. Billie Jean King National Tennis Center grounds until close to midnight after winning her second-round singles match at Arthur Ashe Stadium.\n\nAsked why she plays doubles when so few top players do, Serena said: “I have a great partner. I think she has a great partner, too. It’s a no-brainer. It’s easy playing with her. It’s fun. We love getting out there playing doubles. We love to give the fans a little extra.”\n\nThere are also bonuses for the players, who invariably come away from doubles with sharper returns, more fluid transition games and better volleys. Patrick McEnroe, whose duties as the United States Davis Cup captain include monitoring the progress of Querrey and Isner, maintains that the doubles court has been their launching pad for singles.\n\nSince the start of May, Querrey has won one tournament, in Los Angeles, and reached three other finals. He has rocketed 39 spots in the world rankings, to No. 22. Isner, who started the year No. 144, has ascended to 55th\n\nTheir partnership works because Querrey and Isner are best friends off the court, two self-described goofballs.\n\n“For both of them, it’s helped them with their transition games,” McEnroe said. “They’re never going to be serve-and-volley players, but you want to see them be able to come to the net and finish a point. It’s also great for the return because neither of them are great returners.”\n\nDoubles waits for no one. Its fast pace has cured Querrey of his passivity on points. “I’ve had to be a little more aggressive,” he said, “and go after the ball and attack and not be content with crosscourt rallies.”\n\nTo encourage greater participation, the Association of Tennis Professionals, the governing body for the men’s professional game, streamlined doubles, limiting most matches to two sets with a tie-breaker replacing a third set, if necessary. As a result, the players seldom are on the court for much longer than an hour.\n\nRafael Nadal, the third-ranked men’s player, has competed in doubles on occasion this year. The world No. 1, Roger Federer, used to compete in doubles at the Grand Slam events but cannot imagine a scenario in which he’d do so now. “I don’t want to say it’s never going to happen,” he said. “But chances are on the slimmer side.” In 2001, Federer played doubles with Wayne Ferreira and they won their first two matches at Wimbledon. Then Federer upset the defending champion, Pete Sampras, in the fourth round of singles and Ferreira told him, “You shouldn’t play doubles.”\n\nFederer said that was nonsense but Ferreira was insistent. “He goes, ‘Well, I’m injured, just so you know,’ ” Federer recalled Wednesday night, “and he pulled out. He did that for me. I was like this doesn’t feel right. That’s I guess what made me just think I better not enter.”\n\nVenus has a left knee injury that has put the Williamses in a similar bind. The sisters have to weigh whether the rewards they stand to reap from competing in doubles are worth the risk of inflicting more damage to Venus’s knee or hurting her chances for success in singles.\n\n“My mentality for doubles for me is a major title,” the third-seeded Venus said after advancing Wednesday to the third round in singles. “I love winning majors, so it’s not a decision I take lightly.”\n\nSerena, the second seed, suggested she would not hesitate to pull a Ferreira and scratch from doubles if she thought it was in Venus’s best interest to do so. “Yeah,” Serena said. “Obviously, I want her to do the best in singles.” She added, “If that’s the situation, it’s the situation.”"
