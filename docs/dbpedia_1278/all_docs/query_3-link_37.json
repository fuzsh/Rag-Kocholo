        "text": "Brandon Perez, current Venezuelan Davis Cup player, won the Fisher Island One-On-One Doubles Shootout on Sunday, December 19th overcoming a draw filled with 4 former top 100 ATP level players. Perez defeated OWEN DEMUTH, who won the Michigan State High School Championships, 4-1, to capture the first place prize.\n\nPerez recently played Davis Cup for Venezuela on the Stadium Court at the West Side Tennis Club in Forest Hills, NY,\n\nwhere he lost to South Africa’s LLOYD HARRIS, a US OPEN Quarterfinalist. Perez was ranked #46 in the NCAA Division 1\n\nDoubles rankings while he played for Virginia Tech. “The all court, serve and volley play was excellent, but it was the game’s two- point bonus that made the difference in some of the matches at the very end. What was most impressive thing was the fact the two finalists overcame a very strong eight man draw, four of whom had top 100 ATP pedigree”, stated PAULO BARROS, Tennis Director at the prestigious Fisher Island Tennis Club in Miami Beach."
