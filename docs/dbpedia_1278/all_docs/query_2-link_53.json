        "text": "This year he arrives in Dubai after completing an uninterrupted and unprecedented treble of titles at the Australian Open.\n\n“I cannot ask for a better start to the year. It definitely gives me a great confidence boost and hopefully I can keep that level of confidence this week,” said Djokovic, who has won three titles in Dubai between 2009 and 2011.\n\n“Mentally I do feel relieved a little bit more than at the start of 2012. Following up after 2011 was an extreme challenge for me mentally mostly, because I still played really well, but I found myself for the first time to be No1 in the world and having to defend three Grand Slam titles in one year.\n\n“That was very challenging and I consider finishing the year as No1 in the world in 2012 maybe even a bigger success than 2011, and right now I feel great. I learnt my lesson, I understood the experience that I went through and I’m ready for new challenges.”\n\nCentre of attention: Djokovic speaks to the assembled media in Dubai.\n\nThe 25-year-old, who plays fellow Serb Viktor Troicki on Tuesday in the first round, is on a 13-match unbeaten run and has not lost since Bercy last October when he was knocked out of the Paris Masters by Sam Querrey.\n\nBut building up another streak like the one he had at the start of the 2011 season, which amounted to 42 consecutive victories, is not on his mind.\n\nHe added: “I am aware of the run I am on but I’m not thinking about another streak and trying to overcome the one I had in 2011 because it’s really hard to ask from myself something that is basically maybe even impossible to do.\n\n“But knowing I’ve made it obviously gives me that mental edge and confidence that I need in order to approach every tournament with self belief.”\n\nDjokovic had clearly stated at the start of the season that Roland Garros is his No1 priority, being the only Major he is yet to win and the six-time Grand Slam champion reiterated that goal.\n\nLast year was Djokovic’s first final at the French Open, where he lost in four sets to Nadal, and having made the semi-finals three times is also the Grand Slam with his lowest win percentage: 79.49 per cent.\n\nWith Nadal returning from injury, some would consider this year to be Djokovic’s strongest chance in Paris but he says his chances are the same as every year. He also says he’s thrilled Nadal is back on tour after the Spaniard won the Brazil Open last week.\n\nHe said: “I’ve seen highlights of his matches and I’ve watched him playing maybe one set in Brazil. He’s still playing really, really good on clay and I didn’t expect anything different.\n\n“I’m not in his shoes and I don’t know how he physically feels but he has played finals and he won a tournament. Even though it’s a 250 event and he hasn’t played those tournaments in many years, I’m sure that will give him a lot of confidence for the rest of the season.\n\n“Because that’s what he wanted, he wanted to play matches and it doesn’t matter at what level. It’s great for tennis that he’s back, no question about it.\n\n“Even last year when he was playing really well on clay I still felt that only a few points decided the winner of our matches. I think I got better on this surface, which isn’t my most successful one. Rafa is obviously the ultimate challenge on this surface, but we’ll see.\n\n“To be able to win it you have to be 100 per cent emotionally, mentally and physically fit.”"
