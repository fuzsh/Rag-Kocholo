        "text": "Bio Known for his powerful serve, Querrey holds the record for consecutive service aces in a match with 10. He is also a capable doubles player, with five doubles titles and a career-high doubles ranking of world no. 23.\n\nIn singles, Querrey has won ten titles. His best performance in a Grand Slam singles event was at the 2017 Wimbledon Championships, where he reached the semifinal by defeating World No. 1 Andy Murray.

Querrey turned down a scholarship offer from the University of Southern California (USC) to turn pro. His father Mike Querrey recommended that his son try making it in tennis, as he often regretted his own decision to attend the University of Arizona rather than play baseball for the Detroit Tigers, who had drafted him.

I'd lose and want to go to college.\n\nOn June 11, 2006, Querrey became the first player to win a challenger event in his pro debut.[citation needed] He won in the Yuba City and Winnetka challengers.

This was Querrey's first ATP tour title on grass.\n\nDespite being ranked no. 21 in the world at the time, Querrey was seeded no. 18 at Wimbledon, due to his Queen's Club result. He was entered in the doubles with Isner, where they were the 12th seeds, but the partners agreed to forfeit after Isner played the longest tennis match in history. In the singles, Querrey defeated 2002 Wimbledon semifinalist Xavier Malisse in five sets to reach the fourth round of Wimbledon for the first time, where he lost to Andy Murray.\n\nQuerrey defended his title at the Farmers Classic in Los Angeles, winning a third-set tiebreaker in the quarterfinals against 2003 Australian Open finalist Rainer Schüttler, then defeating Janko Tipsarević in the semifinals, to reach his fifth final of the year.
