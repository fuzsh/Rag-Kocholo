        "text": "The Payment Business\n\nForrester’s latest analysis of merchant payment providers makes for fascinating reading. The scoring can be a little incoherent at times but the report includes unparalleled direct feedback from Forrester’s clients. Stripe and Adyen come out best but don’t escape criticism. Stripe is “expensive” and Adyen’s support “can be hit and miss.”\n\nGlobal Payments and Worldline, neither of whom participated in the research, score badly. Forrester doesn’t think either has done enough platform integration.\n\nTo celebrate its top spot, Adyen has made the report available free of charge. It’s worth a read and a reminder to always engage with analysts. The more you communicate – product roadmaps, customer testimonials, invitations to events etc – the better coverage you get.\n\nForrester aside, Worldline had a good month by recent standards. The beleaguered processor has won the fight with arch-rival Nexi to become the exclusive partner of Cassa Centrale Group. The deal doubles the size of Worldline’s Italian business by adding more than 90,000 POS terminals processing €9bn annually.\n\nThe next Italian bank up for grabs is Banca Popolare di Sondio which is reportedly considering selling its merchant services business and ending its partnership with Nexi. Worldline is said to be in poll position to pay €70-€100m for 25K POS processing €2.2bn. Nexi, BCC Pay and Market Pay are also in the running.\n\nWorldline has also finalised its JV with Credit Agricole in France. Meriem Echcherfi, currently head of merchant services at the French bank, will run the new business which will should be live in early 2025. This is smart move. The first rule of bank partnerships is to hire your general manager from the bank.\n\nNexi reported decent full year results with merchant services revenue up 6% in Q4 2023 and a particularly good performance in Germany. Management will be relieved that Unicredit, Italy’s largest bank, looks set to renew it partnership with Nexi and extend the relationship to additional countries.\n\nStripe celebrated becoming cashflow positive for the first time. This takes the pressure off a possible IPO. “We’re not in a rush,” said the CEO. Stripe’s 2023 letter to shareholders was very bullish but didn’t disclose the company’s revenue or profit numbers.\n\nThe letter did reveal that payment volume rose 25% in 2023 to exceed $1tn and that the business is increasingly servicing larger merchants. More than 100 of Stripe’s clients process over $1bn and it has been signing good omni-channel customers such as Hertz. The car rental giant is moving its worldwide payment acceptance to Stripeincluding installing BBPOS terminals in 3,000 locations. The big win for Hertz is to be able to accept Apple Pay. Although this seems a low bar, it’s a real pain point in the US.\n\nPAX Technology had a difficult 2023 as key customers showed “increased prudence in payment terminal deployment.” Revenue was down 18% to $860m and profits down 12% to $150m. In Europe, PAX called out good performances in Italy, the United Kingdom, Turkey, Spain and France but Germany proved more challenging.\n\nAlthough than 50% of sales are Android terminals, PAX is struggling to generate revenue from services. Sales of SaaS solutions associated with the 11m devices connected to MAX Store were just $13m.\n\nPaypoint, one of the UK’s leading ISO’s, will consolidate all its processing with Lloyds Bank Cardnet. Paypoint’s 20,000 merchants deliver around £7bn volume and the acquiring relationship had been at risk, notably from Global Payments Inc., which inherited a chunk of Paypoint’s merchants when it bought EVO last year. It looks like Lloyds’ ability to extend its offer to include a bank account and commercial card won the deal.\n\nWe saw several interesting fund raises this month.\n\nPPRO, the white label local payments platform, raised €85m, taking its total investment to an eye-popping $462m. PPRO has some great customers including Stripe and PayPal and insiders tell me it hopes to be EBITDA positive by the end of 2024.\n\nFlowpay, the Czech merchant cash advance specialist, raised €2.1m to expand out of its home market. Already boasting key local ISV partnerships including Dotypos, Storyous and Shoptet, Flowpay is one to watch.\n\nBezahl, a Cologne based supplier of payment acceptance to car dealers, raised €22m. The business already has 130 clients serving 1,100 locations. Bezahl charges a monthly fee per location and sends most transactions to Adyen for processinghttps://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/zplTu4QN3zA?rel=0&autoplay=0&showinfo=0&enablejsapi=0\n\nStaying in Germany, REWE, the supermarket giant, has spun out its payment acceptance team with the brand name of Payment Tools. REWE’s strategy mirrors that of its French rival, Carrefour, which demerged its payment division as MarketPay.\n\nFinally, GoCardless has bought Nuapay, a specialist in SEPA Instant, UK direct debits and open banking, from EML Payments, the hapless Australian processor, for €34m. Nuapay, based in Ireland processes €44bn of A2A transactions annually and is forecast to lose €1.2m EBITDA this year. GoCardless also revealed its latest financial results in an exclusive interview with Sifted. Discussing a substantial loss of £80m on sales of £92m, the CEO said “The results demonstrate that we’re moving from strength to strength.”\n\nMPE 2024\n\nThis year’s Merchant Payment Ecosystem conference in Berlin was as good as ever. Read this special edition of Business of Payments to discover more about the end of cards, digital Euro and the slow uptake of open banking.\n\nI moderated an entertaining panel discussion nominally about consumer behaviour but actually covering a variety of topics from Saudi investment in Fintech to why Finland’s largest retailer chose Adyen for its payment processing. The panelists were Adil Riaz from NearPay, a SoftPOS vendor, Gábor Bujáki from OTP Bank, Hungary’s largest acquirer, Janine Kaiser from The Payments Association EU and Kai Lindström from S-Group, Finland’s largest retailer. Watch the conversation below..\n\nSchemes\n\nVisa and Mastercard’s landmark deal to end 20 years of US litigation on “swipe fees”attracted much press coverage. The schemes have conceded an average 7bp reduction in Interchange paid to card-issuing banks. Although retailers will have more freedom to introduce surcharging, it’s likely that large merchants on IC++ pricing will see most of the benefits. Consumers may be annoyed by some potentially rather complex POS flows as merchants attempt to calculate differential surcharges by card type.\n\nImmediately after this announcement, Mastercard revealed it was increasing scheme fees in the US. Just like a casino, the house always wins.\n\nOn this side of the Atlantic, leading French retailers including SNCF and Auchan report that the transaction share of Carte Bancaire, the domestic card scheme, has fallen from 97% to 85% in just three years. Shoppers are increasingly choosing to pay with mobile wallets or Visa/Mastercard branded cards issued by the neo banks. The retailers are not happy, saying that international cards cost 1.2% on average compared to 0.9% for CB.\n\nJP Morgan has become the first US bank to join Carte Bancaires. A spokesman said the move was “mainly a request from our customers, the use of the [CB] network being less expensive than that of other card networks.”\n\nIreland no longer has a local scheme so it’s hard to understand recent thinking in Dublin. Ireland’s Central Bank announced that the country’s payments strategy “needs drastic change” only months after the competition authorities killed an attempt to do just this by outlawing the introduction of a domestic mobile payment scheme. Revolut, which is wildly popular in Ireland, will likely profit from this regulatory confusion.\n\nBlik, the fast-growing Polish mobile payment standard, has restated its international ambitions. With launches already planned in Slovakia and Romania, management believes “Blik Euro” could become a pan-European payment system. Local vendors are innovating with Blik. Posnet is offering Blik acceptance at cash registers without the need for a payment terminal. eService (Global Payments) is providing the processing. Fees are 0.6% + 1.4c.\n\nWero, the new QR based mobile payment scheme promoted by the European Payment Initiative is supposed to launch in June. However, the EPI has not posted any news on its website since December. We await updates with interest.\n\nCapital One has revealed more of its plans for Discover, the US card network it hopes to acquire later this year. The new owners want to “fix” the network’s international acceptance, “which is not quite where it needs to be, for the entirety of our card business today,” said its VP Finance.\n\nNew Shopping\n\nAmazon shocked the industry by axing its “Just Walk Out’ Stores in the USA, resulting “a few hundred” layoffs in its technology team. Instead, the company will focus on its new range of Smartcarts. Retail analysts conclude that Just Walk Out technology does not scale for large format stores – it’s too expensive and needs too much manual intervention. Amazon had previously revealed that 1,000 staff in India acted as “virtual cashiers” for its autonomous stores.\n\nWhile there still seems a strong business case for Just Walk Out in small format stores, Amazon’s decision will come as a blow to other retailers that have bought its technology, presumably to benefit from Amazon’s well-funded roadmap. One of these may be Delaware North, a hospitality vendor that has just installed Just Walk Out technology to sell beer at London’s Wembley Stadium.\n\nOther vendors are available. Lekkerland has installed three AI-based smart fridges at an EV charging station in Saxony. You tap your payment card, open the door, remove the items and are automatically billed. Portuguese start-up, Reckon.ai is providing the technology.\n\nWe’ve been talking about RFID to automate grocery checkouts for over twenty years but it’s still not ready. Walmart has withdrawn a pilot in which it used RFID to verify whether customer’s self-scanned purchases were accurate.\n\nSometimes simpler is better. Take a look at Sticky, a Manchester-based start-up which allows consumers to pay by simply tapping a cheap NFC label. “You can get a drink in five seconds with our physical digital labels. It’s faster than a card,” says the CEO. Sticky charges £60/month for eight “flows.”\n\nProduct\n\nRetailers say that returns abuse is the leading source of fraud, overtaking phishing for the first time.Here’s a good round up from Edgar Dunn which shows the scale of the challenge. Unsurprisingly, this trend is leading to a big increase in chargebacks so why don’t retailers dispute more of them? One reason may be the risk of offending good customers. This New York restaurant complained when a customer used a chargeback to reclaim a deposit for a cancelled booking and the ensuing argument became very public.\n\nThe UK has a cunning plan to fight fraud. New legislation will make Faster Payments slower to give PSP’s time to investigate suspected bad transactions.\n\nDwayne Gefferie lays out the strategic case for PSP’s to move into orchestration or infrastructure-as-a-service. Or both. However, it’s not clear how much money is in orchestration. One analyst says the market will grow from $846m today to $4.8bn by 2032. Aite, a more reliable source, suggest the actual revenue reported by dedicated fintech orchestrators today is less than $25m. Looking on the bright side, Aite says “there’s plenty of room for providers to grow.”\n\nMerchants are divided on whether to go with a single payment provider or use “orchestration” to manage a series of best of breed vendors. Hugo Boss is using Adyen for all its in-store and online requirements. Why not use multiple suppliers? “We are not a petrol station. We are Hugo Boss,” explains the retailer’s head of payments.\n\nInPost, Poland’s last mile delivery specialist, has launched a payment wallet called InPostPay. It could do well as it builds on an installed base of over 9m mobile app users.\n\nMany are sceptical about Click to Pay but the schemes’ much delayed attempt to compete with one-click wallets is finally coming to Europe. ING is offering Click to Pay with Mastercard, initially in Spain. Visa has launched Click to Pay in Francewhere Adyen is the first PSP to offer the product. It claims 4% points increase in authorisation rates compared to a standard transaction.\n\nISVs and their payment partners are scrambling to offer pay-at-table. Toast, the US restaurant software vendor, has launched in the UK with an impressive solution running on Adyen’s POS hardware. “Long battery life and durable,” says one IT Director.\n\nRevolut launched its acquiring business in 2021 but we heard little news until it launched point of sale software with integrated payments. Aimed at retail and hospitality, Revolut POS is based on Nobly, the ISV it bought in 2021. The software appears to be free and transactions start from 0.8% and 2c for domestic cards. International cards are 2.6% which is pricey for any merchant in a tourist location.\n\nHere’s a good case study from the introduction of contactless ticketing across 60,000 validators covering the whole Dutch public transportation network. The new system is saving money and travellers seem happy. EMS (Fiserv) is the acquirer. Meanwhile, Getnet has resigned the Madrid bus network including acceptance, gateway and acquiring.\n\nThere’s a small but growing category of software vendors aiming at making life easier for people who run payment businesses. Kani, founded in Newcastle, reconciles PSP transaction data with the information provided by the card schemes. Torus, started by an ex Mastercard consultant, won the innovation competition at MPE with its pricing software that gives acquirers better control over their portfolio profitability. Both are worth a look.\n\nSoftPOS\n\nSoftPOS is a downloadable payment application that turns any Android or iOS device into a payment terminal. The standards regime is quite complicated. Matt Jones gives a good explainer of how it all fits together.\n\nThis technology seems finally ready for prime time. Tabesto, a vendor of intelligent ordering tools for restaurants, says 90% of sales are a new product called Fox, an integrated all-in-one kiosk with no external POS or printer. Customers can choose SoftPOS payment apps from Worldline or DejaMobile. Here’s it is in action at Waffle Factory.\n\nDeja Mobile, based in France and now owned by MarketPay, has some good case studies. Two months after launch with Rabobank in the Netherlands, 1,200 micro-merchants have activated the service of which 80% are generating transactions.\n\nI’m not convinced PSPs can make any money out of micro merchants but if you want a mass-market customer base you will need to spend money on marketing. Best of luck to Viva, the mPOS vendor partly owned by JPMorgan, which has launched a major advertising campaign in France.\n\nSoftpay is another vendor in the news, announcing a partnership with Elavon, targeting SMEs in the Nordics. SoftPay is now listed on the Sunmi app store giving access to a broad range of merchants.\n\nRubean, the German softPOS vendor quoted on the Munich stock exchange, expects 2024 revenue of c.€2.5m, doubling year on year but below expectations. The company predicts sales rising to c.€10m by 2027 on the back of new contract wins including Commerzbank Global Payments.\n\nBT, still the UK’s largest telco, is offering SoftPOS to its 1m SME customers with Adyen is providing the technology. The service is good value. All transaction are priced at 1.4% and there is no monthly fee. BT’s move could start a trend. Ericsson says mobile operators worldwide want to offer financial services to their customers.\n\nOpenbanking\n\nGrowing disquiet at the UK’s slow progress on open banking was highlighted by a speech made by Chris Hemsley of the Payment Systems Regulator to the Pay360 conference.\n\nReferring to emerging rules for variable recurring payments (VRPs), widely believed to be the best hope of driving mass market adoption, the regulator says it has asked the industry to “get on with it.” Jack Wilson from TrueLayer takes issue with this and writes the industry is now “moving at the pace of the slowest” and that the slowest is the regulator itself. The industry is complaining that it is in limbo waiting for the results of a consultation on how open banking should be priced and without a clear way of making money, has little incentive to commercialise new products.\n\nThe lack of an acceptance mark or scheme brand is also major stumbling block. Looking at the checkout page below, how would consumers know they can pay with their banking app? Clue: Vyne is an open banking vendor.\n\nDespite the current uncertainty, there is some good news. Ecospend, Trustly’s UK business says that 30% of payment volumes at Hargreaves Landsdowne, a retail investment manager, are made using open banking.\n\nEcospend has been the supplier to HMRC (the UK tax authority) which has long been the poster child of UK open banking payments. With Ecospend’s initial 3 year term completed, HMRC is retendering its banking contract. The winner is likely to be one of the 15 vendors selected to join the Government’s framework contract.\n\nIn partnership news, Nexi has selected Mastercard as its open banking provider. Mastercard’s product is based on a white-label of Token’s service. Visa-owned Tink has won a contract from Deutsche Bahn for direct debit setups to power its bike sharing service and also a deal with Micropayment, a Berlin-based PSP.\n\nA number of vendors are building an interface to allow open banking payments at POS using contactless NFC in place of cumbersome QR codes. Kevin, the Lithuanian fintech which made some high-profile layoffs before Christmas, has demonstrated A2A NFC payment on iPhone. Click through and read the comments which indicate some scepticism.\n\nMultiPay, the UK POS focused PSP is doing something similar. Acquired.com is providing the open banking connections. Assuming the technology works, is there a business case? Alexander Peschkoff explains why A2A payments at POS don’t have commercial appeal.\n\nMore importantly, A2A payments may just be too slow for POS. A killer table from the UK Future of Payments Review shows the time it takes for a user to initiate a payment. PIX is regarded as best in class but, with Apple Pay as a comparator, even 20 seconds is too slow for POS merchant payments. Shoppers will keep using cards for a long time yet.\n\nArtificial Intelligence\n\nKlarna’s CEO has clarified that although the company’s AI chatbot is doing work equivalent to 700 people, this is entirely unrelated to the 700 people he layed off in 2022.\n\nIt doesn’t matter how clever your chatbot. RSR Resarch says consumers want to talk to a real person.\n\nBut the AI demos keep getting better. This ChatGPT video certainly passes the Turing Test.\n\nPossibly, one of the most appropriate uses of AI is to count the number of mentions of AI in corporate earnings calls. Hat tip to PayPal. And to FXC for asking its robots to research this pressing question.\n\nIn other news\n\nIn a disastrous week for the UK payment industry, there were outages at Greggs, Sainsburys, McDonalds and Tesco. Although the incidents do not seem connected, the regulator is investigating. McDonalds blamed a “configuration change” but Burger King had the last word.\n\nRapyd’s Icelandic boss hit back at calls for a merchant boycott following the Group CEO’s strong support for Israel’s war in Gaza. “Claims such as that Rapyd works in Israeli settlements in the West Bank and that the company supports the Israeli army’s war on Gaza are completely false”, he wrote.\n\nA fascinating piece from Matt Jones on the rise of Ali/Wechat Pay and the implications for Chinese soft power. On a similar theme, FXC looks at Asian QR code payment schemes and asks what happens when they become interoperable.\n\nIt’s been a good month for bloated corporate buildings. Fiserv has finally opened its new $37m HQ. “Welcome to Milwaukee. We have been waiting for you Fiserv,” said the mayor. PAX went bigger. Its new $46m HQ in Shenzen is 18 storeys high.\n\nPayments from a Merchant Perspective – useful (and free) research from Arkwright. Standardised and low-friction open banking is their number one ask.\n\nWe may think of payments as an environmentally friendly business but Edgar Dunn calculates transaction processing generate 3.3m tonnes of greenhouse gases each year. And card production releases a further 1m.\n\nWirecard latest. Dan McCrum, the FT journalist who broke the story, gives a good interview to Chris Skinner. Four years on, the story itself gets even stranger. It seems that Jan Marsalek, Wirecard’s fugitive COO, was working for Russian intelligence and has recently been living in Russia under the assumed identity of an Orthodox priest.\n\nAnd finally\n\nKevin Hart, the US comedian, bought a bored ape NFT in January 2022 for $200,000. This is a particularly fine ape which sits under a rare “spinner hat.” Hart just sold the NFT for $47,000. Which still seems a lot for a jpg, even one as fine as this.\n\nVisa and Mastercard’s Q3 financial results are well covered elsewhere. At Business of Payments, we’re more interested in what the investor updates tell us about trends in the European market and the success (or otherwise) of new products.\n\nMastercard continues to outperform Visa in Europe although its pace of growth has moderated. The two schemes are now almost neck and neck. Mastercard’s merchant payment volume grew 26% in Q3 to $602m while Visa’s was up 20% to $637m. Total scheme volume was up 23% in dollar terms although this falls to 14% when calculated in euros. Overall ATV was steady at $36.24.\n\nEuropean politicians and regulators have long been worried about an over-reliance on US payment networks. The European Payments Initiative and the Digital Euro are two of the latest responses. Asked about the threat of protectionism, Michael Miebach, Mastercard’s CEO was adamant that his business would always have a role in any payment ecosystem saying. “We’re seen as a technology company, a global technology company, not necessarily as a US payment brand.” That’s a bold statement and one which does not align with current sentiment at the European Central Bank and elsewhere. Dependence on foreign owned payment systems is a risk for any jurisdiction.\n\nLast week, Worldline’s profits warning highlighted weakening European payment volumes, especially in Germany but Miebach said he saw no slowdown. “Consumer spending remains pretty steady in Germany and generally in Europe…. So Europe’s been a bright star, continues to be for us. So we don’t quite relate to what others are reporting.”\n\nPortfolio wins\n\nThe deceleration in Mastercard’s European volume growth is primarily due to the removal of the NatWest portfolio win (16m cards) from the annual comparisons. But Mastercard has continued to win new card portfolios including 10m Deutsche Bank cards and 20m from UniCredit. Miebach said the Deutsch Bank conversion “has already started. It’s a combination of debit and credit. It will happen over an extended period of time. It’s not a flip-the-switch kind of scenario.”\n\nMastercard is also working with issuers to migrate more than 100m Maestro cards (mainly in Germany and the Netherlands) to its own-brand debit product. This is good news for consumers as their cards will now work online. It’s less good news for merchants who will be faced with higher transaction charges.\n\nVisa is also positive about Europe, remarking that it has opened seven new locations over the last five years and more than doubled its workforce. Visa claims more than 100 relationships with European fintechs and even bought two of them – Tink (open banking) and CurrencyCloud (cross-border money transfers).\n\nExcluding Maestro, the total number of Mastercards in Europe rose 13% increase to 796m. Visa did not publish numbers for card this quarter but reported that, excluding the UK, the number of active Visa cards in Europe is up 50% since 2019. Including the UK, where it has lost one third of the debit market to Mastercard, the figures would not seem so pretty. However, Visa’s management says it expects to migrate 40m cards from 40 issuing clients in Europe over next few years. The company says that these incomings portfolios are skewed to high margin cross-border transactions.\n\nTokenised transactions\n\nIncreasingly, cards are tokenised which means that the fraud-prone 16 digit PAN is not included in the transaction data. Visa processed 14bn tokenised transactions worldwide in Q3, up 60% year on year. Tokens make card transactions significantly more secure, and this means that issuers are much less likely to block them. This is very good news for merchants. Ryan McInerney, Visa’s CEO, said “we’re seeing, on average, somewhere between 4% and 5% higher approval rates across our partners. And we also see it with a reduction in fraud — a 30% reduction in fraud.”\n\nMastercard reported “the number of tokenized transactions has more than doubled over the past two years. We just processed over three billion tokenized transactions in one month.” Management highlighted the importance of tokens in allowing Mercedes-Benz customers in Germany to “pay for fuel directly from their vehicle using only their fingerprint.”\n\nOpen banking\n\nAlthough Visa was blocked from buying Plaid, an open banking leader in the US, it was able to acquire Tink, a similar business HQ’d in Sweden. Management said that Tink “continues to perform very well in Europe…and we look forward to the opportunity to bring Tink outside of Europe.”\n\nMastercard has acquired Token, another European open banking provider. Questioned about the commercial model for the schemes to enter open banking, Mastercard’s Miebach said “We’re putting in our open banking connection to make it clear is there a balance on the account. It’s called the payment success indicator. That is the product. And it is a per-click fee related to the API call. So that is the model.”\n\nContactless\n\nMastercard says contactless now represents 63% of face-to-face transactions globally. Miebach explained why mass transit was so important. “By converting transit to Open-Loop, we gain access to more low-ticket, high-frequency transactions, both at the station and the surrounding merchants.”\n\nVisa reports 76% of all F2F transactions outside the US are contactless, up 5ppts. The US is growing more quickly, albeit from a lower base. Contactless share was up 13ppts to 40%. Rapid transit is driving adoption worldwide. Visa says it enabled 150 new transit systems for contactless, taking the global total to 750. Impressively, 40% of these new customers are using Cybersource, Visa’s in-house acceptance solution, as their payment gateway.\n\nGateways\n\nCybersource seems to be out-performing Mastercard Gateway Services, its direct competitor. Cybersource attracted 2,600 additional customers in 100 countries in Q3. McInerney put its success down to investments in omni-channel, tokenisation (vital for mass transit) and fraud prevention capabilities.\n\nBoth schemes have products that allow money to be sent to one of their cards. Visa reported 7.5bn Visa Direct transactions globally in Q3 up 19%. In Europe, it is supported by 1000 programmes managed by 100 Visa partners. McInerney said Visa Direct is “focused on bill payments, on earned wage access, on insurance disbursements, on P2P more broadly in new geographies around the world, both domestic and cross-border.”"
