The majority of the fine is suspended, with $1,000 payable within 90 days.\n\nMs Baskova had a highest WTA ranking of 1117 in singles and 777 in doubles.\n\nThe breaches of the Tennis Anti-Corruption Programme (TACP) that Ms Baskova has been found guilty of are:\n\nD.1.d of the 2017 TACP – “No Covered Person shall, directly or indirectly, contrive or attempt to contrive the outcome or any other aspect of any Event.”\n\nD.2.a.ii of the 2017 TACP – “In the event any Player knows or suspects that any other Covered Person or individual has committed a corruption Offense, it shall be the Players’ obligation to report such knowledge or suspicion to the TIU as soon as possible.”\n\nMs Baskova has since retired from the sport.\n\nThe Tennis Integrity Unit is an initiative of the Grand Slam Board, the International Tennis Federation, the ATP and the WTA and established to promote, encourage, enhance and safeguard the integrity of professional tennis worldwide. From 1 January 2021, the TIU will become part of a new, independent body – the International Tennis Integrity Agency.\n\nBulgarian tennis player Aleksandrina Naydenova has been issued with a lifetime ban from the sport after an investigation by the Tennis Integrity Unit (TIU) found that she had partaken in match fixing activity multiple times between 2015 and 2019. Additionally, she was charged and found guilty of failing to co-operate with the TIU investigation. Alongside the ban, she has been fined $150,000 (US).\n\nThe disciplinary case was heard by Anti-corruption Hearing Officer Richard McLaren. He found that Ms Naydenova made 13 breaches of the Tennis Anti-corruption Programme (TACP) – 12 relating to match fixing and one relating to several incidents of non-co-operation with the TIU investigation process. The subsequent sanction means that from today, 20 November 2020, the player is permanently prohibited from playing in or attending any tennis event authorised or sanctioned by the governing bodies of tennis.\n\nMs Naydenova who had a highest ITF singles ranking of 89 and WTA ranking of 218, had been provisionally suspended on 27 December 2019 prior to the hearing.\n\nThe breaches of the Tennis Anti-corruption Programme (TACP) that Ms Naydenova has been found guilty of are:\n\nSection D.1.d. of the 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018 TACPs: “No Covered Person shall, directly or indirectly contrive or attempt to contrive the outcome or any other aspect of any Event.”\n\nSection F.2.b / D.2.c of the 2017 and 2019 TACPs: “All Covered Persons must co-operate fully with investigations conducted by the TIU including giving evidence at hearings, if requested.

Ms Dmitrieva, who had a highest WTA singles ranking of 1191 and a highest doubles ranking of 939, was involved in a total of six incidents of match fixing.

The offences took place in October 2016.\n\nIn addition, she was found guilty of two further offences of failing to report knowledge of corrupt activity and failing to co-operate with a TIU investigation.\n\nThe sanction and fine were imposed in a decision issued today, 28 May 2019, by independent Anti-Corruption Hearing Officer Ian Mill QC. As a result, and with immediate effect, the player is permanently excluded from competing in or attending any sanctioned event organised or recognised by the governing bodies of the sport.\n\nCurrently ranked 821 in ITF World Tennis singles, Ms Ploskina has a career high ranking of 698 WTA, in October 2014.\n\nThe relevant sections of the Tennis Anti-Corruption Program she was found to have breached are:\n\nSection D.1.e: “No Covered Person shall, directly or indirectly, solicit or facilitate any Player to not use his or her best efforts in any Event.”\n\nSection D.2.a.ii: “In the event any Player knows or suspects that any other Covered Person or other individual has committed a Corruption Offense, it shall be the Player's obligation to report such knowledge or suspicion to the TIU as soon as possible.”\n\nSection D.2.c: “For the avoidance of doubt, (i) a failure of the Reporting Obligation by any Covered Person; and/or (ii) a failure of the duty to cooperate under Section F.2 shall constitute a Corruption Offense for all purposes of the Program.”\n\nMauricio Alvarez-Guzman banned for life for tennis match-fixing and associated corruption offences\n\n3059 ITF ranked Chilean player found guilty of attempting to bribe a player and of offences related to purchasing wild cards\n\nChilean tennis player Mauricio Alvarez-Guzman has been handed a lifetime ban from professional tennis after being found guilty of match-fixing and associated corruption offences, which breach the sport’s Tennis Anti-Corruption Program (TACP).\n\nThe 31-year old was found to have attempted to contrive the outcome of an August 2016 ATP Challenger match in Meerbusch, Germany by offering a player €1,000 to lose a set.\n\nIn addition he was found guilty of contriving the singles draw of the ITF F27 Futures tournament played in July 2016 in Antalya, Turkey by purchasing a wild card for entry into the singles competition. An intention to purchase a wild card for the doubles competition of the same tournament did not come to fruition, but still stands as a corruption offence.\n\nThe disciplinary case against Mr Alvarez-Guzman was considered by independent Anti-Corruption Hearing Officer Charles Hollander QC at a Hearing held in London on 11 March 2019.\n\nHaving found him guilty of all charges, the lifetime ban imposed by Mr Hollander means that with effect from 14 March 2019 the player is permanently excluded from competing in or attending any tournament or event organised or sanctioned by the governing bodies of the sport.\n\nIn July 2010 Mr Alvarez-Guzman reached a career-high ATP singles ranking of 1050; his highest doubles ranking of 672 came in August 2014.

The approach offered payment in return for agreeing to lose nominated sets and games in a match at the event.\n\nIn addition, Mr Mikos was found to have operated two gambling accounts through which bets were placed on tennis between March 2012 and December 2013.\n\nThe case was considered by independent Anti-Corruption Hearing Officer Jane Mulcahy QC, who imposed the lifetime ban today, 4 May 2017.\n\nThe ban from all professional tennis applies with immediate effect and means the player is not allowed to compete in, or attend, any tournament or event organised or sanctioned by the governing bodies of the sport.\n\nThe offences for which he has been sanctioned are:\n\nSection D.1.a: No Covered Person shall, directly or indirectly, wager or attempt to wager on the outcome or any other aspect of any Event or any other tennis completion\n\nSection D.1.d: No Covered Person shall, directly or indirectly, contrive or attempt to contrive the outcome or any other aspect of any Event\n\nSection D.1.e: No Covered Person shall, directly or indirectly, solicit or facilitate any Player to not use his or her best efforts in any Event\n\nSection D.1.g: No Covered Person shall, directly or indirectly, offer or provide any money, benefit or Consideration to any other Covered Person with the intention of negatively influencing a Player’s best efforts in any Event\n\nMr Mikos achieved a career-high singles ranking of 933 in in August 2014.\n\nThe Tennis Integrity Unit is an initiative of the Grand Slam Board, the International Tennis Federation, the ATP and the WTA, who are jointly committed to a zero tolerance approach to corruption in tennis.\n\n*Alexandros Jakupovic was the subject of a separate TIU investigation and disciplinary hearing that led to him receiving a lifetime ban in December 2015:\n\nhttp://www.tennisintegrityunit.com/media-releases/tennis-player-alexandros-jakupovic-banned-life-breaches-tennis-anti-corruption-program"
