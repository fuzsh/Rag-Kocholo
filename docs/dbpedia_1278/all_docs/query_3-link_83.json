        "text": "Wayne Odesnik's big win over Cedrik-Marcel Stebe on Wednesday afternoon was exciting and fun to watch.\n\nIt was also annoying for some.\n\n\"Why does he need a towel after every point,\" one spectator said. \"He shouldn't be mean to the ball boy,\" said another, after Odesnik barked for a ball in the third set.\n\nPro tennis players can be peculiar in the way they behave on the court. Some yip and yell and curse in other languages (such as Argentines Facundo Arguello and Guido Pella), some throw rackets (Denys Molchanov of Ukraine) and some hit themselves in the head with their rackets when they are frustrated (Stebe).\n\nOdesnik likes to call for a towel after every point. He also checks the strings on his racket after every point, often moving them around.\n\nOn Wednesday, he asked for new tennis balls twice and also re-gripped his racket three times. \"It was hot out there,\" said a hairy-faced Odesnik after his impressive 6-3, 3-6, 6-4 second-round victory over Stebe at the $100,000 Sarasota Open. \"I was sweating a lot so I had to re-grip.\"\n\nOdesnik is also picky about other things. He says his schedule needs to be the same every match day: up at 8 a.m., eat at 9 a.m. and hit at 11:30 a.m. if a match is in the afternoon.\n\n\"It's all part of being a professional,\" Odesnik said. \"It's really important for me to control the things that I can control.\"\n\nIf his rackets aren't strung correctly he admits he gets annoyed -- \"But you have to try to adapt to the situation,\" he said.\n\nAgainst Stebe, he used a stellar forehand and well placed shots to climb back into the match. He was down, 3-2, in the deciding set but broke Stebe three times to win it.\n\nOther players who advanced Wednesday in singles were Molchanov and Pella. Molchanov defeated Canadian Frank Dancevic, 7-5, 7-6 (7-2) and Pella defeated China's Ze Zhang, 6-4, 2-6, 6-1.\n\nSerbian Ilija Bozoljac teamed with Somdev Devvarman to win in doubles.\n\nBozoljac is considered a pest, too.\n\nApparently, he likes to bust chops. He told one ball boy Tuesday during his singles match, \"You have to anticipate\" the play. Later, he asked the chair umpire to tell his opponent to move more to the left during a serve.\n\nAfter Bozoljac's match was over, a woman asked her friend \"Who won?\" The friend replied, \"The Serbian guy I don't like.\""
