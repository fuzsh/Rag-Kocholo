        "text": "American tennis player (born 1985)\n\nJohn Robert Isner (born April 26, 1985) is an American former professional tennis player. He was ranked as high as world No. 8 in singles and No. 14 in doubles by the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP).[2] Considered one of the best servers ever to play on the ATP Tour, Isner achieved his career-high singles ranking in July 2018 by virtue of his first Masters 1000 crown at the 2018 Miami Open and a semifinal appearance at the 2018 Wimbledon Championships. He also twice reached the quarterfinals at the US Open in 2011 and 2018, the latter of which helped qualify him for an ATP Finals appearance later that year. At the 2010 Wimbledon Championships, he played the longest professional tennis match in history, requiring five sets and 183 games to defeat Nicolas Mahut in a match which lasted 11 hours and 5 minutes, and was played over the course of three days.[3] Isner holds the record for hitting the ATP's fastest \"official\" serve ever and third-fastest on record in tennis at 157.2 mph or 253 km/h during his first-round 2016 Davis Cup match. He has the most aces in the history of the ATP Tour, having served 14,470, as of August 31, 2023.[4][5][6][7] Isner retired from professional tennis following the 2023 US Open.[8]\n\nEarly life\n\n[edit]\n\nIsner was born on April 26, 1985, in Greensboro, North Carolina, to Robert and Karen Isner. He has two older brothers, Jordan and Nathan.[9]\n\nIsner started playing tennis at the age of 9 and did not take the sport seriously until the age of 11. He played for his high school of Walter Hines Page Senior High School where he helped lead them to a state championship in 2001.[10] He also played in 10 junior tournaments which included the 2002 US Open (losing in the second round to eventual champion Richard Gasquet) and the 2002 Orange Bowl. He also made the finals of a tournament in Tulsa, Oklahoma, losing to Brian Baker.[11]\n\nCollege career\n\n[edit]\n\nComing out of high school in 2003 as a heavily sought-after prospect, Isner was recruited by the University of Georgia Bulldogs. He was dominant in college, compiling a win-loss record of 143–28 in singles and 140–27 in doubles. He was ranked the top tennis player in the country on numerous occasions and won many tournaments. Some highlights from his college career include winning the 2005 NCAA doubles title partnering with Antonio Ruiz-Rosales, winning the 2007 team event against Illinois and reaching the 2007 NCAA singles finals where he lost to Somdev Devvarman of Virginia in three sets.[12] He ended his college career after his singles final loss and team win in 2007 and turned professional.[13]\n\nProfessional career\n\n[edit]\n\n2007–2008: Turning pro, First ATP final, top 100\n\n[edit]\n\nIsner began his professional career in earnest in the summer of 2007. With a world ranking of no. 839, he needed a wildcard entry into the main draws of every single tournament, even at Futures level.[14]\n\nHe won his first tournament of the summer, the USA F14 Futures,[15] beating the top three seeds along the way. Then, after first-round losses at Challenger level as well as a tournament at ATP level, he beat five top-300 players and three seeds to win the Lexington Challenger in July and improve his ranking to no. 416 after just one month.\n\nAt the following week's tournament at the Legg Mason Tennis Classic in Washington, D.C., a late withdrawal freed up a wildcard spot, which was given to Isner at the last minute.[16] Isner took full advantage of his good fortune, recording his first wins over top-100 players. He won third-set tiebreakers on five consecutive days, beating no. 73 Tim Henman, no. 47 Benjamin Becker, no. 189 qualifier Wayne Odesnik, no. 12 Tommy Haas, and no. 54 Gaël Monfils, to reach the final, where he fell to fellow American Andy Roddick. His week raised his ranking to no. 193 in the world after six weeks on the pro tour.\n\nIsner's success in Washington, D.C. earned him wildcard entries into three more ATP tournaments—the Masters 1000 Series event in Cincinnati a week later, New Haven and the US Open. He lost in the first round in Cincinnati to quarterfinalist no. 15 David Ferrer. The following week in New Haven, he beat no. 49 Becker a second time, before falling to Ferrer for the second week in a row.\n\nIn his US Open début, he defeated the 26th-seeded player, former quarterfinalist Jarkko Nieminen, firing 34 aces along the way. He proceeded to win his second-round match against Rik de Voest, before losing in the third round to top seed and eventual champion Roger Federer. Isner was one of only two players to take a set from Federer in the championship. His US Open performance improved his ranking to no. 144.\n\nAfter the US Open, Isner continued to play exclusively in North America and finished the year ranked no. 107. That year, Isner was added to the United States Davis Cup team as a practice partner.[17]\n\nIsner's no. 106 ranking in November 2007 was just good enough to get him direct entry into his first Australian Open after several players ranked above him dropped out.[18] He was defeated in the first round of the 2008 Australian Open by veteran Fabrice Santoro of France. Teamed with Croat Ivo Karlović, who stands half an inch taller (Karlović is currently the joint tallest player on the ATP World Tour alongside Reilly Opelka), Isner also lost in the first round of doubles.[19]\n\nIsner broke into the top 100 at no. 93 in February with a quarterfinal appearance at an ATP event in San Jose, beating no. 90 Florent Serra and no. 26 Tommy Haas. He maintained a top-100 ranking in the first three months of the year, beating six players in the top 100, while playing exclusively in events at ATP level. Isner played at his first French Open and Wimbledon, losing in the first round of each. He also played at the US Open, where he lost in the first round. He ended the year ranked no. 144 in the world.\n\n2009: Top 40, first top-10 wins\n\n[edit]\n\nIsner qualified for the singles draw of the 2009 Heineken Open in Auckland, after winning three consecutive three-set matches in qualifying. His final match saw him bounce back from a 0–3 deficit in the third set to eventually beat Brazilian Thomaz Bellucci in a tiebreaker. In the main draw, Isner beat Albert Montañés and countryman Robby Ginepri, before ultimately exiting with a loss in the quarterfinals.\n\nIsner received a wildcard into the 2009 Australian Open, after winning the United States Tennis Association's wildcard tournament, beating Donald Young and Jesse Levine along the way.[20] Despite serving 39 aces against his first-round opponent, Slovakia's Dominik Hrbatý, he lost in four sets. Isner began working with a new coach, Craig Boynton, who had coached former world no. 1 Jim Courier in the 1990s, in March 2009.[21]\n\nAt the 2009 Indian Wells Masters, Isner pulled off a major upset by defeating ninth seed Gaël Monfils. This was Isner's first win over a top-10 player, after four previous defeats. He then went on to defeat former world no. 1 Marat Safin, before losing to world no. 6 Juan Martín del Potro in the fourth round.\n\nIn April 2009 at the U.S. Men's Clay Court Championships in Houston, Texas, at River Oaks Country Club, Isner made it as far as the quarterfinals, where he was defeated by fellow American Wayne Odesnik.[22] Isner qualified for the French Open, but had to withdraw after being diagnosed with mononucleosis, which caused him to miss Wimbledon as well.[23]\n\nIn August 2009, he defeated world no. 7 Jo-Wilfried Tsonga and world no. 18 Tomáš Berdych en route to the semifinals of the ATP World Tour 500 event in Washington, before losing to world no. 5 Andy Roddick. This performance brought him to a career-high ranking of no. 55 and a special exemption into the Masters 1000 Series event in Montreal, where he defeated Jesse Levine, before losing to Mikhail Youzhny. He earned a wildcard into the Masters 1000 Series event in Cincinnati, where he defeated world no. 21 Tommy Haas, before losing to world no. 35 Jérémy Chardy in the second round.\n\nUnseeded and ranked no. 55 in the world entering the US Open, Isner defeated world no. 29 Victor Hănescu in the first round, which was his first win in a Grand Slam tournament since the 2007 US Open, ending a streak of six consecutive defeats. He then advanced to the third round, where he defeated world no. 5 and fellow American Andy Roddick in five sets for his first victory over Roddick, his first victory in a five-set match, and the first time he advanced past the third round of a Grand Slam tournament. He was then defeated in the fourth round by world no. 10 Fernando Verdasco in four sets. His US Open performance brought his ranking to a career-high no. 39.\n\nAfter playing in Vienna, Basel and at the Paris Masters, Isner finished the year at a career-high no. 34 in the world. He has credited his work with Boynton for helping him get back on track following his disappointing 2008 season.[21]\n\nHis progress was acknowledged by his peers, as he was voted the ATP Most Improved Player for 2009,[24] becoming the tenth American to win the award, and the first since Andre Agassi in 1998.\n\n2010: First title, longest match in history\n\n[edit]\n\nIsner began the year at the 2010 Heineken Open in Auckland. Unseeded, he reached his second career ATP final and first since Washington in 2007. In the final, he saved a championship point to defeat 2001 Australian Open finalist Arnaud Clément.[25][26] The victory in Auckland was Isner's first ATP tour title; after the victory he donated $5,000 of his winnings to aid rescue action for the 2010 Haiti earthquake.[27]\n\nThe victory catapulted Isner into the top 30 for the first time and also allowed him to surpass Sam Querrey to become the second-highest-ranked American for the first time, behind only Andy Roddick.[21] Isner said he intended to finish the year in the top 20,[27] and given his ascendency in the world rankings combined with the absence of Roddick and James Blake for the 2010 Davis Cup season, it became increasingly likely that Isner would qualify to play singles for the United States Davis Cup team for the first time in his career.[21]\n\nAfter Gilles Simon withdrew, Isner became the final seed for the 2010 Australian Open.[28] In the first round, he defeated world no. 49 Andreas Seppi for his first victory at the Australian Open and his first victory at a Grand Slam other than the US Open. He then advanced to the round of 16, before losing to world no. 4 and eventual finalist Andy Murray.\n\nAfter the Australian Open, Davis Cup captain Patrick McEnroe announced that Isner and Querrey would be first and second singles selections on the United States Davis Cup team's first-round World Group tie in Serbia on indoor clay in March 2010; Isner described the selection as \"a dream come true\".[29]\n\nIsner next entered the 2010 Regions Morgan Keegan Championships in Memphis. Seeded sixth, he made it to the finals, before losing to Sam Querrey. In the doubles event, Isner teamed up with Querrey to win the tournament, defeating the British-Australian pair of Ross Hutchins and Jordan Kerr.\n\nPrior to the Davis Cup tie, Isner competed at the 2010 Abierto Mexicano Telcel Championships, an ATP World Tour 500 event on clay, where he was the fifth seed. He lost in the first round to Simon Greul. Despite the loss, Isner following the tournament moved into the top 20 for the first time.\n\nIsner appeared in the first round of the 2010 Davis Cup, where the United States was up against Serbia. In his two singles matches, he faced Serbia's team of world no. 2 Novak Djokovic and world no. 35 Viktor Troicki. He lost the first singles match against Troicki, but bounced back by winning the doubles match with Bob Bryan, as a replacement for food-poisoned Mike Bryan. In his second singles match, he lost to Djokovic, which enabled Serbia to defeat the United States.\n\nAt the 2010 BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells, he was seeded 15th and advanced to the fourth round, before losing to world no. 2 and defending champion Rafael Nadal.\n\nAfterwards, he appeared as the 17th seed at the second Masters 1000 Series event of the season—the 2010 Sony Ericsson Open in Miami. He advanced to the third round, before losing to 12th seed Juan Carlos Ferrero.\n\nIsner began the clay-court season with an opening-round loss to world no. 89 Xavier Malisse at the U.S. Men's Claycourt Championship, followed by a round of 32 showing at his first-ever Internazionali BNL d'Italia, where he defeated Horacio Zeballos, before losing to Thomaz Bellucci.

He had guest appearances on Good Morning America and the Late Show with David Letterman, and threw the ceremonial first pitch at a New York Yankees game in Yankee Stadium.[92][93] He and Mahut won the 2010 ESPY Award for Best Record-Breaking Performance in sport.[94]\n\nLine score: 2010 Wimbledon Championships – Men's Opening Round 1 (32') 2 (29') 3 (49') 4 (64') 5 (491') John Isner (23) 6 3 67 7 70 Nicolas Mahut (Q) 4 6 7 63 68\n\nThe second-longest match: Isner v Anderson, July 13, 2018\n\nThis match saw Isner face similarly big-serving Kevin Anderson of South Africa.[95] The match is the longest tennis match ever in the second week of a Grand Slam tournament, both by time and number of games played. It is also the longest-ever match on Centre Court, and the fourth-longest tennis match of all time.\n\nThe first three sets were all decided by tiebreakers, the first going to Anderson and both the second and third going to Isner. In the fourth set Anderson exploited an opening and broke Isner's serve to make the score 7–6, 6–7, 6–7, 6–4 going into a fifth set in which Anderson seemed to have gained significant momentum from his service break. The fifth quickly became a battle of services as both players began to tire. At 16–17 it began to rain, leading to speculation of a delay to close the Centre Court roof, but the rain stopped during the crossover break. Isner endured a shaky mistake which permitted Anderson to get back in the game to 40–30 from 40–0 down, but Isner forced Anderson to miss the next backhand return and held serve. At 24–24, Anderson built up a 0–40 lead and while Isner got back two of those points to bring the score to 30–40, Anderson broke Isner on his third break point of the game, and served out to win the match in 6 hours and 36 minutes, with the scoreline reading 7–6, 6–7, 6–7, 6–4, 26–24.[96]\n\nLine score: 2018 Wimbledon's Championships – Men's Semifinals 1 (63') 2 (54') 3 (61') 4 (43') 5 (175') Kevin Anderson (8) 7 65 69 6 26 John Isner (9) 66 7 7 4 24\n\nPlaying style and equipment\n\n[edit]\n\nIsner had an extremely powerful and consistent serve, thanks in part to his 6-foot-10½-inch height which made him the third-tallest player in tour history, behind Ivo Karlović and Reilly Opelka. Commentators[who?] have also praised his serve's composure under pressure.[97] Isner also had a powerful forehand, used in tandem with his serve in one-two points: a big serve followed by a big forehand. He was also known to follow his serves with approaches to the net, though not strictly in a serve-and-volley tactic. Isner's movement around the court was limited by his large body, and he struggled most with players who moved him around the court. Isner's fitness improved considerably during his career, as displayed during his win in the longest tennis match ever at Wimbledon against Nicolas Mahut.\n\nBecause of his dependence on his powerful and consistent serve, Isner won a great majority of his service games. But simultaneously, his limited movement made it difficult to break the opponent's serve. This resulted in long matches where each player continues holding serve until the set reaches a tiebreak. At Grand Slam tournaments with no fifth-set tiebreaks, his matches could extend very long: indeed, he played in the two longest major matches in history during the 2010 and 2018 Wimbledon Championships. In large part due to Isner, in 2022 all four majors adopted 10-point fifth-set tiebreakers.\n\nAs of January 2012, Isner was sponsored by Lacoste and Prince for his attire and rackets, respectively.[98][99] His attire carried through most of 2015. He switched his attire to FILA in 2016 at the Australian Open.\n\nCoaches\n\n[edit]\n\nIsner's first coach was Craig Boynton, who worked with him from 2009 to 2012 and helped develop his style of play.[100] Isner and Boynton split over reportedly mutual agreement. Isner then hired Mike Sell, who helped him to significant success, such as defeating Roger Federer, David Nalbandian and Novak Djokovic. During his time with Sell, Isner's ranking stayed around no. 10 in the world. After parting from Sell in 2014, Isner teamed with Justin Gimelstob and worked with him until April 2016. With Gimelstob, Isner's ranking stayed around 10, until 2016, where he dropped to 17. As of 2018, he is currently working with coaches Rene Moller and David Macpherson.\n\nPickleball\n\n[edit]\n\nIn June 2024, Isner made his professional pickleball debut in men's doubles at the Texas Open.[101]\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nWhile at the University of Georgia, Isner majored in speech communication. He resided in Tampa, Florida, where he trained at the Saddlebrook Academy alongside other American tennis pros such as James Blake and Mardy Fish. Currently, he resides in Dallas, Texas.[102]\n\nIsner married Madison McKinley, a jewelry designer, on December 2, 2017, in Bluffton, South Carolina.[103] They have four children.[104][105][106][107]\n\nCareer statistics\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: John Isner career statistics\n\nGrand Slam tournament performance timeline\n\n[edit]\n\nKey W F SF QF #R RR Q# DNQ A NH\n\n(W) winner; (F) finalist; (SF) semifinalist; (QF) quarterfinalist; (#R) rounds 4, 3, 2, 1; (RR) round-robin stage; (Q#) qualification round; (DNQ) did not qualify; (A) absent; (NH) not held; (SR) strike rate (events won / competed); (W–L) win–loss record.\n\nTo avoid confusion and double counting, these charts are updated at the conclusion of a tournament or when the player's participation has ended.\n\nTournament 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 SR W–L Win% Australian Open A 1R 1R 4R 3R 3R A 1R 3R 4R 2R 1R 1R 3R A 1R 1R 0 / 14 15–14 52% French Open A 1R A 3R 1R 2R 3R 4R 2R 4R 3R 4R A 2R 3R 3R 1R 0 / 14 22–14 61% Wimbledon A 1R A 2R 2R 1R 2R 3R 3R 3R 2R SF 2R NH 1R 3R 1R 0 / 14 18–14 56% US Open 3R 1R 4R 3R QF 3R 3R 3R 4R 3R 3R QF 3R 1R 1R 2R 2R 0 / 17 32–16 67% Win–loss 2–1 0–4 3–2 8–4 7–4 5–4 5–3 7–4 8–4 10–4 6–4 12–4 3–3 3–3 2–3 5–3 1–4 0 / 59 87–58 60%\n\nSignificant finals\n\n[edit]\n\nMasters 1000 finals\n\n[edit]\n\nSingles: 5 (1 title, 4 runner-ups)\n\n[edit]\n\nResult Year Tournament Surface Opponent Score Loss 2012 Indian Wells Masters Hard Roger Federer 6–7(7–9), 3–6 Loss 2013 Cincinnati Masters Hard Rafael Nadal 6–7(8–10), 6–7(3–7) Loss 2016 Paris Masters Hard (i) Andy Murray 3–6, 7–6(7–4), 4–6 Win 2018 Miami Open Hard Alexander Zverev 6–7(4–7), 6–4, 6–4 Loss 2019 Miami Open Hard Roger Federer 1–6, 4–6\n\nDoubles: 8 (5 titles, 3 runner-ups)\n\n[edit]\n\nResult Year Tournament Surface Partner Opponents Score Loss 2010 Italian Open Clay Sam Querrey Bob Bryan\n\nMike Bryan 3–6, 2–6 Win 2011 Italian Open Clay Sam Querrey Mardy Fish\n\nAndy Roddick w/o Loss 2012 Indian Wells Masters Hard Sam Querrey Rafael Nadal\n\nMarc López 2–6, 6–7(3–7) Win 2016 Shanghai Masters Hard Jack Sock Henri Kontinen\n\nJohn Peers 6–4, 6–4 Win 2018 Indian Wells Masters Hard Jack Sock Bob Bryan\n\nMike Bryan 7–6(7–4), 7–6(7–2) Win 2022 Indian Wells Masters Hard Jack Sock Santiago González\n\nÉdouard Roger-Vasselin 7–6(7–4), 6–3 Win 2022 Miami Open Hard Hubert Hurkacz Wesley Koolhof\n\nNeal Skupski 7–6(7–5), 6–4 Loss 2022 Italian Open Clay Diego Schwartzman Nikola Mektić\n\nMate Pavić 2–6, 7–6(8–6), [10–12]\n\nRecords\n\n[edit]\n\nThese records were attained in the Open Era of tennis.\n\nTournament Year Record accomplished Player tied Wimbledon 2010 113 aces in an ATP singles match[33] Stands alone 113 aces in a Grand Slam singles match 85 aces in a single set 92 games won in a single match 91 games lost in a single match that he won 246 winners in a single match Longest singles match ever played (11 hours, 5 minutes) Nicolas Mahut Longest play in a single day (7 hours, 6 minutes) Nicolas Mahut 118 games in a single day Nicolas Mahut 2018 Longest Grand Slam semifinal ever played (6 hours, 32 minutes) Kevin Anderson Hall of Fame Championships 2017 Won an ATP tournament never facing a break point[108] Tommy Haas\n\nAlex de Minaur 2011, 2012, 2017, 2019 4 singles titles Stands alone Atlanta Open 2013–2015, 2017, 2018, 2021 6 singles titles 2010, 2011, 2013–2018, 2021 9 finals ATP Tour 2007–2023 14,470 aces served 505 tiebreaks won 839 tiebreaks played\n\nNotes\n\n[edit]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nOfficial website\n\nJohn Isner at the Association of Tennis Professionals\n\nJohn Isner at the International Tennis Federation\n\nJohn Isner at the Davis Cup\n\nJohn Isner at Olympedia\n\nJohn Isner at ESPN.com"
