        "text": "What do you remember about that first tournament?\n\nI won there and didn’t really know what to expect because there weren’t too many sporting events in those parts of the world at that time. But it was amazingly organised. The Aviation Club was very nice, and everything was at a high level and they took great care of us. The field was strong – obviously not as strong as these days since Roger Federer started playing there.\n\nHow did you decide to play in 1993?\n\nIt was a long year for me and I got injured, so I decided not to go to Australia in 1993. I prepared for the season and said ‘OK there’s a pretty big tournament in the United Arab Emirates and I think that’s where I should start my season’.\n\nSo my decision was made based on me skipping Australia and I wanted to start the year outdoors not indoors. At the time, a $1million (Dh3.67m) event was a lot of prize money and a lot of points.\n\nDo you remember any of your matches en route to the title?\n\nI played Thomas Muster in the semi-finals and then I beat Fabrice Santoro in the final. I remember playing good games. It was a pretty slow hard court and very comfortable for me. The weather was not too hot, not too cold, a very pleasant atmosphere and conditions.\n\nI think there was a sandstorm at the beginning of the tournament. I was losing like 5-2 in the second set and won five games in a row to beat Santoro in the final.\n\nWhat was the city like back then for you as a first-time visitor?\n\nIt was sort of a cute place to be. It was spectacular for the players. It was new and different than anywhere we had played before. From the food to the local culture, it was great.\n\nBut I’m sure I wouldn’t recognise it today. The last time I was there was 1996. If I receive an invitation I will definitely come visit again.\n\nI’m really glad that the tournament is still going on. I think it has established itself as maybe one of the favourites for the players as well. I’m following tennis still.\n\nDo you still have the silver dhow you won for the singles event?\n\nYes I have it of course. The amazing trophy was presented to me by His Highness Sheikh Mohammed. I have pictures from that day in my home in the US.\n\nIn that part of the world the ATP didn’t have any tournaments, so it was a very brave move to bring tennis events to that part of the world. That led to Doha having a tournament and then the ladies events followed. So it was a spectacular move.\n\nWould you have imagined 20 years ago that the tournament would be as big?\n\nProbably not, but at the same time I had no reason not to believe. Everything was so well-prepared and I could see that the local businessmen and the rulers were behind it and they wanted it to be successful. And when they want to be successful, they do everything to prove it and it’s great to see how the tournament has grown and is attracting all the top players.\n\nI won doubles there too so it was a great place for me and I have the best memories. It’s satisfying for me to have my name as the inaugural winner because this tennis tournament is successful and I’m proud to be part of the history of it.\n\nNovak Djokovic, Roger Federer, Tomas Berdych and Jo-Wilfried Tsonga are all playing this year. Who is your tip to win?\n\nIf you look at the last Grand Slam it’s really about Roger and Novak Djokovic. So you have to pick them as the favourites.\n\nCzech tennis is in a really good place right now. What do you think?\n\nLast year was one of the most successful years in the history of Czech tennis – maybe the most successful. We won the Davis Cup after many many years and at the same time we won the Fed Cup for the ladies. We did it within a span of two weeks in the same country, same city, so it was really a year to celebrate for Czech tennis.\n\nWhere are you based now and what have you been up to post-retirement?\n\nI am based in Prague and I also have a place in the United States. I work as a private banker. It was something which happened in 1999. I started at Morgan Stanley in the United States and for many years I was with them. I moved back to the Czech Republic in 2010 and joined UniCredit Bank, which is a big Italian bank and has businesses in the Czech Republic as well.\n\nIf there is a current player you wish you could have played, who would it be?\n\nWhen you see players of the calibre of Djokovic, Rafael Nadal and Federer, obviously I would love to hit the ball with them. But it’s scary how good they are so I think a practice session would be enough!\n\nWho was your toughest opponent?\n\nSergi Bruguera. I played him many times and never beat him.\n\nWhat are your favourite memories?\n\nIt’s hard to choose one that ranks the highest. Obviously the first tournament I won, first on the Tour, those are great memories. Reaching the top 100, then the top 10, those too. It was a very fortunate time to be part of the Tour."
