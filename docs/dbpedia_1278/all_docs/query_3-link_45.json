        "text": "INDIAN WELLS, Calif. — The BNP Paribas Open has long been known for the strength of its doubles field, and this year was no exception, with nine of the top 10 singles players entered. But few ATP Tour events are as fortunate.\n\nSteve Simon, the tournament director, noted that although the sport’s popularity in Southern California gave doubles a knowledgeable audience, it was the tournament’s spot on the calendar that was most responsible for the strong field. The Indian Wells event is held over 10 days, giving players a day off between most rounds of singles. It also runs two weeks, so most players who lose here have to wait more than a week before playing again in Miami.\n\n“I think that they would rather play doubles than sit around and just practice,” Simon said. “It’s a good way to do that. When you couple that along with the fun that they’re having with it, I think that combination makes it that we just happen to be in the right spot with the right deal. If we were a one-week event, I’m not sure you’d see as many players playing doubles.”\n\nThe crowds come out for the stars, with Novak Djokovic, Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and Andy Murray drawing overflow crowds to their doubles matches. But with the stars rarely aligning for doubles any other week, the tour is looking for ways to increase the discipline’s popularity the rest of the year.\n\n“What we see here is that there’s a massive following for the likes of Andy Murray in doubles,” said Dominic Inglot, a British player ranked 38th in doubles. “There was a whole crowd. But how much of it is the sport of doubles and how much is the names?”\n\nDoubles unexpectedly found itself in the spotlight Thursday evening after the withdrawal of Bernard Tomic from a singles quarterfinal match left tournament organizers scrambling to fill the night session. They inserted a doubles match between the American twins Bob and Mike Bryan and the Wimbledon champions Jack Sock of the United States and Vasek Pospisil of Canada. The crowd of 13,827 did not seem disappointed.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
