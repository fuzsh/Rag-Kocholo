        "text": "Spanish tennis is always at the top. This year we missed Rafa after Wimbledon, but Ferrer had a remarkable season and Granollers and Lopez won a very prestigious title in doubles in London. Ah.. yes… do not forget that the Spanish Armada is also about to play the Davis Cup final.\n\nYou have to get back to Stockholm 1975 to see another Spanish couple to win the championship (Gisbert and Orantes).\n\nFrom Granollers\n\n“We finished here winning the title, so it’s incredible for us. We try to play as best as we can always. I think we have very good relationship. So, I think, that’s one of the key of our success.\n\nI’d like to congratulate Mahesh and Rohan for their year. They played a great tournament. Good luck next season. Marc is one of my best friends. To win here with him is very special. Thanks to the ATP for a great tournament and to Barclays for supporting our sport.”\n\nFrom Buphati\n\n“It’s always tough playing them. They’re not a conventional doubles team. They make it very, very difficult in more ways than one, no matter who they play. We were expecting that. We fought hard to stay in the match. We got ourselves again into a Match tie-break. This time I think we just played a bad tie-break. That sums it up.\n\nThese two are going to be a great asset for Spain in the next week’s Davis Cup final against the Czech Republic."
