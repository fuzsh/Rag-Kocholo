A.Radwanska in 3s).\n\nIn 2016 she defeated five Top 20 players en route to 2016 Wuhan title: No.18 Svitolina (2r), No.1 Kerber (R16), No.13 Konta (QF), No.5 Halep (SF) and No.12 Cibulkova (F).

Kvitova managed to come back at Roland Garros. In her second tournament of season, she clinched 20th singles title at Birmingham (d. Barty in F). Kvitova then enjoyed a return to form at US Open, upsetting Muguruza, the highest-ranked opponent she beat in 2017, en route to the quarter-finals.\n\nIn 2018, Kvitova won a WTA Tour-leading five titles in 2018, at St. Petersburg (d. Mladenovic), Doha (d. Muguruza), Prague (d. Buzarnescu), Madrid (d. Bertens) and Birmingham (d. Rybarikova), where she defended a title for the second time in her career after New Haven in 2014-15. She was the first player to win a title on three difference surfaces in a season since Serena Williams in 2015.\n\nThe Czech has won at least one title every year dating back to 2011 and moved to the fifth place among active players for titles won. Her five appearances in finals is most title-matches she’s reached in a season since 2011.

She steered Czech Republic to Fed Cup semifinals for the 10th year in a row, and followed this up by going 2-0 in singles play against Germany (d. No.11 Goerges and No.12 Kerber), but she had to withdraw from the final won against the USA.\n\nShe made her sixth appearance at the WTA Finals, and first since 2015, losing all the round robin matches to Wozniacki, Svitolina and Karolina Pliskova in the White Group. She ended the season on a five-match losing streak, the longest since 2010, when she lost six from Wimbledon through to the US Open.\n\nIn 2019 she played her third Grand Slam final, losing at the Australian Open against Naomi Osaka, 6-7 7-5 4-6.

She also possesses a good tempo and variety of strokes.\n\nHer height often causes her lateral movement difficulties and consequently she sets her game on very short rallies, in which she tries to take control of the game already from the serve / return.

She underwent surgery to repair the damage to her hand and was expected to be out of action for the next six months to make a full recovery. Three days later, in her first press conference since her surgery, Kvitova revealed that she had regained movement in her left hand.\n\nIn early January 2017, it was reported that Kvitova's recovery was proceeding according to her plan and that she had gradually begun exercising her injured fingers. In addition, her local tennis club offered a $3,850 reward for information leading to the whereabouts of her attacker.\n\nOn May 23, 2017, Kvitova announced that she would play the Wimbledon Championships the following month and make a last-minute decision later in the week about whether to compete at the French Open. In May 2018, it was revealed that a suspect had been taken into custody, later identified as repeat offender Radim Zondra.\n\nNet Worth and Endorsement\n\nKvitova has a net worth of approximately $35 million as of 2023.
