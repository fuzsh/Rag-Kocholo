        "text": "It wasn't that long ago that Robby Ginepri was near the top of the tennis world, but these days he's climbing back up from the bottom of the mountain.\n\nGinepri continued his comeback from injury with a straight-set victory over fifth-seeded Wayne Odesnik on Thursday in the second round of the Savannah Challenger at The Landings Club's Franklin Creek Tennis Center. Odesnik was the event's defending champion but couldn't overcome five double faults against in the 7-6 (7-2), 7-5 defeat.\n\nUp 5-4 in the second set, Ginepri served two aces at deuce to close out the match. Ginepri had squandered two match points en route to losing the previous set but responded to break Odesnik's serve and then serve out the victory.\n\nAlthough unseeded, Ginepri may be the tournament's biggest name. He has three career ATP singles titles and has reached at least the fourth round in all four Grand Slam events.\n\nGinepri rose as high as No. 15 in the world in 2006 and earned a spot on the U.S. Davis Cup team in 2004 and '09. But a freak mountain bike accident stalled his career and sent him out of the top 100 in the world and back to the Challenger tournaments.\n\n\"It's like I'm starting my career over again trying to work my way up in the rankings,\" said Ginepri, currently No. 192 in the world and a finalist in the year's first Challenger tournament in Hawaii. \"It's almost like a separate life. I'm not trying to compare myself against a few years ago because it's a different Robby.\"\n\nAgainst Odesnik, Ginepri served five aces against only two double faults and survived long rallies on the clay courts at Franklin Creek. He broke Odesnik's service five times but also committed a couple of double faults and had his service broken four times.\n\nGinepri seemed poised to win the match a game earlier than he did, but Odesnik fought back from a 40-15 hole to even the second set at five games apiece. But helped by a double fault and aided by two nifty passing shots, Ginepri regained the advantage by breaking Odesnik's serve.\n\n\"Any way you finish a win is great,\" Ginepri said. \"I was kind of getting nervous there for a while, so I was glad to not have to play any additional points. It was a physical match and we were both running each ragged and not giving away any free points.\"\n\nAfter playing a limited schedule in 2011 while recovering from his injury, the Savannah tournament is just the third time in nine events this season that Ginepri has advanced past the second round. He hasn't been ranked inside the top 100 since the summer of 2010 but says his elbow is as healthy as it is going to get and he's prepared to work through the Challenger series.\n\n\"These (Challenger) tournaments aren't easy by any means, because there are some really good players out here who all are hungry to take the top guys out,\" said Ginepri, who will face No. 10 seed Brian Baker today in the quarterfinals. \"I'm kind of a target out here because I have been at the top of the rankings. I know that guys want to take me out, so I do my best not to let that happen.\"\n\nNote: Participants in Special Pops Tennis Savannah, a program based at The Landings bringing the sport into the lives of intellectually challenged individuals, will have a short exhibition between today's matches after 2 p.m.\n\nSAVANNAH CHALLENGER\n\nAt Franklin Creek Tennis Center\n\nThe Landings Club, Savannah\n\nThursday\n\nSingles, Second Round\n\nRobby Ginepri def.
