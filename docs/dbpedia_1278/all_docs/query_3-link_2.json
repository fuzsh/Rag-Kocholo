        "text": "Wayne Odesnik is on fire\n\nWayne was introduced to tennis at age 7. Moved from South Africa to the U.S. at three and started playing at the JCC in Miami Beach. In his junior career he made it all the way to the sinals in singles at the Easter Bowl in 2000. In 2001 he won the singles title at the El Paso Youth Tennis Centre ITF Tournament, was a semifinalist in both singles and doubles (with Jarrett Chirico) at the USTA Junior International Hard Court Championships, finished in third place in singles and doubles (with Chirico) at the boys’ 16 USTA Super National Hard Court Championships, and was a boys’ 16 singles semifinalist at the USTA Super National Clay Court Championships. He also won the Curacao Junior Open, and won the doubles title (with Chirico) and at the USTA Super National Spring Championships – The Easter Bowl.\n\nIn his pro career he succeeded in Wimbledon (2008, 2009, 2012 and 2013), US Open (2007 and 2008), French Open 2008, and Australian Open 2010. His highest ranking was No. 77 and he is currently ranked No. 168.\n\nWayne is a good player that is truly passionate about tennis with great appreciation to be a professional athlete. Despite the tornado of attention that surrounds him, Wayne is a fighter that came back after a 7 month tennis break. His progress has been remarkable and Wayne has soared up the charts and is on his way back to break into the TOP 100."
