        "text": "Robert Kendrick's still in Honeymoon Mode, just a bit sluggish after 'a lot of drinking, a lot of golfing' at his Myrtle Beach wedding two weeks ago.\n\nThe thing is, an admittedly playing-back-to-shape Kendrick is still bad news for the field at the Naples ITG Challenger Series.\n\n'Wedding week, you're pretty much having a good time with all your buddies,' the 27-year-old, ranked 83rd in the world, said after dispatching Wayne Odesnik (7-5, 6-4) in the quarters on Friday at The Naples Tennis Club. 'I hit for maybe two of those days, so I knew I needed two or three weeks to get ready for the French (Open).'\n\nThat partly explains Kendrick's pseudo-homecoming ? the California native has spent half the year in Sanibel, where his parents have owned a condo for 30 years, for as long as he can remember ? but at the expense of his honeymoon?\n\nSurely the new Mrs. Kendrick isn't happy about this.\n\n'We're gonna do it later in the year,' he assures his interrogator, loud enough for the still blushing bride to hear. 'But she's gonna come to Paris and London.'\n\nSurely there are worse ways for newlyweds to spend their first weeks as man and wife, the groom training in Europe for potential fame and riches in Paris and then at Wimbledon.\n\nOnly Mrs. Kendrick ? formerly Elizabeth Proctor, all-ACC at Wake Forest and the South Carolina Player of the Year as a high school senior ? knows all about this life.\n\nHeck, it's what brought them together, the couple first crossing paths while she worked for The Tennis Channel at the U.S. Open, then later re-connecting at the wedding of a mutual friend, Liz's former coach.\n\nHow could this mixed doubles pairing ever fault?\n\nConsider, he said with a smile, 'We're 3-0 together.'\n\nThe top seed nabbed his third win as a married man by dominating with his serve, then volleying to keep Odesnik on the move under a searing, midday sun. Kendrick got a break in the 11th game to take the first set, then after Odesnik rallied from a two-game deficit to tie the second at four, he claimed the last two games with his wife shouting spousal support from the bleachers.\n\n'The guy's just a great player,' Odesnik said. 'The courts played a little faster today and that favored him. He's a very good serve-and-volley player and he takes the ball pretty early. I had chances, a break point to go up 3-1 in the second, then I finally broke him and I gave it right back. He played a good match.'\n\nImagine how much sweeter that win, which propels Kendrick into Saturday's semis against Benedikt Dorsch (who beat Kevin Kim 6-4, 7-5), would have been had the couple's dream house been there to go home to?\n\nKendrick was supposed to move to Naples last fall, but ran into problems with the construction company. As a result, he and his wife are living out of suitcases in the same hotel that's housing most of this weekend's players and officials.\n\n'I'd love to bash them in the newspaper, that's for sure,' Kendrick said of his ex-builder. 'Now we're looking at places in Estero.'\n\nIt makes sense, he said, not too far from his parents and sister, who moved to Sanibel with her children a few years back, but a little livelier than the island life he fell in love with as a child.\n\nIt was here in muggy Southwest Florida that Kendrick got some valuable conditioning growing up, sweating through the summer months before heading back to school in Fresno, where other players nodded but couldn't really relate with serving in a sauna.\n\nSanibel has been Kendrick's professional base for almost four years now, closer to his coach in Orlando and the small concentration of pros who train year-round in Tampa.\n\nNot to mention its proximity to this week's Challenger Series, honeymoon-interrupting though it might be, which could ultimately be Kendrick's second tournament win of the year. He beat Dorsch in straight sets (6-3, 6-4) in the final of the Challenger Series event in Dallas in February.\n\nIt was another positive step for a guy that, as young and talented as he might be, seems to have made his name with his biggest disappointment.\n\nKendrick, then ranked 237th in the world and with just one win on grass to his résumé, lost a two-set lead to second-seed Rafael Nadal in the second round at Wimbledon last June. The unknown Kendrick came within two points of upsetting the charismatic Spaniard, the world's No. 2, before losing a five-set heartbreaker that ended after three hours and 42 minutes.\n\nIt's made for a long year of ?what if?' and ?what happened?,' but Kendrick said he's finally put it in his past and that he's looking forward to the start of a potentially redeeming grass court season.\n\nAfter all, this is a man who's embracing fresh starts and new beginnings.\n\nJust ask Mrs. Kendrick.\n\n'You don't learn,' he said of his famous loss. 'You're still mad about it, but there's nothing you can do. So many people watched it, so everyone comes up to me and asks about it still. I'm a little sick of hearing it, but hopefully I'll have a new story pretty soon.'\n\nTickets are $15 on Saturday and Sunday. Tickets are on sale on site or reserve tickets by calling 784-2236 or (305) 335-8196.\n\nParking is $5, which is being collected by The Rotary Club of Naples for a water project with International Tennis Group and the Global Water Foundation in Manta, Ecuador.\n\nThe tournament continues through Sunday, with final round singles and doubles starting at 2 p.m.\n\nSaturday's schedule\n\nat Naples Tennis Center\n\nCenter Court\n\nSemifinals\n\n2 p.m.\n\nRobert Kendrick (USA) vs. Benedikt Dorsch (GER)\n\nfollowed by\n\nPaul Capdeville or Paul Goldstein vs. Bobby Reynolds\n\nDoubles\n\nFollowing singles semifinals\n\nBenedikt Dorsch (GER)/Sergiy Stakhovsky (UKR) vs. Pablo Cuevas (URU)/Horacio Zeballos (ARG)\n\nfollowed by\n\nSantiago Gonzalez (MEX)/Mirko Pehar (USA) vs. Juan Pablo Brzezicki (ARG)/Leonardo Mayer (ARG)"
