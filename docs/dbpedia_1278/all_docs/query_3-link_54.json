The anti-doping controls have got stricter, I believe, over the last few years. I would say we're doing a lot more than what we were,\" Murray said.\n\n\"I certainly feel I'm getting tested a lot more than what I was, many out-of-competition blood tests from the ITF and also the UK anti-doping, as well.\n\n\"I feel like it's an inconvenience getting woken up at 6:30 in the morning, but if it gets people that are cheating out of the sport when they are doing it, then I'm all for that.\"\n\nTennis\n\nPickleball ace Linton strikes gold at English OPEN\n\n12 hours ago\n\nTennis\n\nGlobal titans bring stardurst to Pickleball English OPEN\n\n12 hours ago"
