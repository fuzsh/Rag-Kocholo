        "text": "No. 6 Querrey, No. 7 Odesnik fall to unranked foes.\n\nThursday was not a good day to be a ranked singles player in the $50,000 Challenger of Oklahoma.\n\nUnseeded Phillip Simmonds knocked off No. 6 Sam Querrey and doubles specialist Scott Lipsky outlasted No. 7 Wayne Odesnik to highlight action at Philcrest Hills Tennis Club.\n\nSimmonds had the most unusual match of the day. The 20-year-old trailed 5-4 in the second set. Querrey had won the first set and was serving for the match.\n\nSimmonds then mounted his best rally in his short pro career.\n\nSimmonds won the next three games while having to break Querrey's serve twice to win the second set. That was the turning point as Simmonds won the third set for a 3-6, 7-5, 6-1 verdict.\n\n\"It's good to gut it out,\" Simmonds said. \"I'm playing pretty well, but I have always done better in doubles.\"\n\nSimmonds turned pro two years ago and decided not to attend college. This year has been a breakout season in terms of singles play.\n\nHe won a Futures satellite event in Boca Raton, Fla., won a Mexico Challenger and reached the quarterfinals at Lubbock, Texas, another Mexico event and now in Tulsa.\n\nLipsky understands Simmonds' way of life. Lipsky has played many more doubles matches than singles. However, he beat Odesnik in a long 6-4, 5-7, 6-4 match to reach the quarterfinals. Lipsky then teamed with Tulsa native David Martin in a quarterfinal doubles match. The defending Challenger of Oklahoma champs defeated Lesley Joseph and Sunil Kumar Sipaeya 5-7, 7-6, 10-8 in the super tiebreaker.\n\n\"I've got to the semifinals and quarterfinals a couple of times,\" said Lipsky, who has a 380 singles ranking, but No. 229 in doubles. \"It's hard sometimes because you have to sacrifice singles (to do well in doubles).\"\n\nLipsky won seven doubles events last year and has 13 for his career.\n\nThe wildest match of the day featured Robert Kendrick and Harel Levy. Kendrick fell behind 5-1 before winning 12 of the next 13 games to advance.\n\nResults\n\nSingles: second round: Michael Russell d. Wesley Whitehouse 6-4, 6-3.\n\nScott Lipsky d. Wayne Odesnik 6-4, 5-7, 6-4.\n\nPhillip Simmonds d. Sam Querrey 3-6, 7-5, 6-1.\n\nRobert Kendrick d. Harel Levy 7-6, 6-0.\n\nDoubles: quarterfinals: Rajeev Ram-Bobby Reynolds d. Pierre-Ludovic Duclos-Wesley Whitehouse 6-4, 6-1.\n\nScott Lipsky-David Martin d. Lesley Joseph-Sunil Kumar Sipaeya 5-7, 7-6, 10-8.\n\nFriday's Schedule: 11 a.m.-Bobby Reynolds vs. Jeff Morrison (Court 4); Zack Fleishman vs. Cecil Mamiit (Court 5). Matches to follow: Phillip Simmonds vs. Rolbert Kendrick. Michael Russell vs. Scott Lipsky.\n\nDoubles: Alex Kuznetsov-Scott Oudesma vs. Rajeev Ram-Bobby Reynolds.\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\n* I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy."
