        "text": "The Tennis Anti-Doping Programme (the “Programme”) and the United States Anti-Doping Agency (“USADA”) jointly announced today that Wayne Odesnik has committed a second Anti-Doping Rule Violation.\n\nMr Odesnik, a 29-year-old player from the USA, provided an out-of-competition urine sample to USADA on 14 December 2014, and further samples to the ITF (on behalf of the Programme) on 17 December 2014 and 12 January 2015. Those samples were sent to WADA-accredited laboratories in Salt Lake City, USA and Montreal, Canada for analysis, and were found to contain one or more of: metabolites of methenolone; metabolites of androst-(2,3)-en-17-one; and GHRP-6. All are Prohibited Substances under the 2014 and 2015 WADA List of Prohibited Substances: methenolone under section S1 (Anabolic agents); androst-(2,3)-en-17-one under section S4 (Hormone and metabolic modulators); and GHRP-6 under Section 2 (Peptide hormones, growth factors, related substances and mimetics). They are therefore also prohibited under the 2014 and 2015 versions of the Programme. Accordingly, Mr Odesnik was charged with an Anti-Doping Rule Violation under Article 2.1 of the Programme.\n\nMr Odesnik’s commission of an Anti-Doping Rule Violation under Article 2.1 of the Programme was confirmed, which was his second such violation, having been sanctioned in 2010 for the possession of human growth hormone. It was, therefore, determined that he is suspended from participation for a period of 15 years, back-dated to commence from 30 January 2015, and so ending at midnight on 29 January 2030. It was also determined that Mr Odesnik’s results at the Happy Valley Challenger event, Australian Open and Maui Challenger event should be disqualified, with forfeiture of the ranking points and prize money that he won at those events.\n\nThis case featured extensive cooperation between the ITF (on behalf of the Programme) and USADA, including information sharing, use of the expertise of each organisation and a consolidated approach to the results management process. These contributions are hereby recognised and held up as an example of the benefits of cooperation between Anti-Doping Organisations.\n\nThe Tennis Anti-Doping Programme is a comprehensive and internationally recognised drug-testing programme that applies to all players competing at Grand Slam tournaments and events sanctioned by the ITF, ATP and WTA. Players are tested for substances prohibited by the World Anti-Doping Agency and, upon a finding that an Anti-Doping Rule Violation has been committed, sanctions are imposed in accordance with the requirements of the Tennis Anti-Doping Programme and World Anti-Doping Code. More background information on the Programme, sanctions, tennis statistics and related information can be found at http://www.itftennis.com/antidoping.\n\nUSADA is a signatory to the World Anti-Doping Code and fully complies with the World Anti-Doping Code’s International Standards. USADA runs the anti-doping program including education, sample collection, results management, and drug reference resources for athletes in US Olympic, Paralympic, Pan American, and Parapan American Sport, including all Olympic sport national governing bodies, their athletes, and events throughout the year. Additionally, USADA’s commitment to clean competition and the integrity of competition also includes programs aimed at scientific research and education & outreach initiatives focused on awareness and prevention.\n\nFollowing the recent natural catastrophe which has ravaged the island of Vanuatu, the International Cricket Council (ICC) today confirmed that in a show of solidarity and support for the wider cricket community, it will be offering its support through the platform of one of its official charity partners, UNICEF, at the forthcoming ICC Cricket World Cup quarter finals between Australia versus Pakistan in Adelaide and New Zealand versus West Indies in Wellington.\n\nThe ICC, alongside the co-hosts of ICC Cricket World Cup 2015, Cricket Australia and New Zealand Cricket, will jointly contribute $200,000 USD to support UNICEF in its aid and recovery programmes in the region.\n\nIn addition, the ICC will provide promotional opportunities through LED advertising at these marquee fixtures as a platform to launch an appeal to the international community to lend its support to the Pacific island.\n\nCommenting on the initiative, ICC Chief Executive David Richardson said: “It is hard not to be affected by the horrific images which have emanated from Vanuatu in recent days. Having recently supported the area as part of the ICC’s ongoing Development programme in the Eastern Asian Pacific region, through significant investment in the island’s cricket facilities which have been severely damaged, the ICC has taken these steps to give back to the game and support the people in the region at this challenging time.\n\n“The ICC is appealing to the international community to donate whatever it can to help the people of Vanuatu get back on their feet. Any donation over the coming days and weeks, however large or small, would be gratefully received.”\n\nCricket Australia CEO James Sutherland added: “Australian cricket fans have a long tradition going back to the 2005 Tsunami cricket match of showing that cricket cares at times of crisis.\n\n“I hope they can dig deep to show they care about our Vanuatu neighbours as well. Please log on to the online donation address at http://www.unicef.org.au”, he said.\n\nNew Zealand Cricket CEO David White encouraged New Zealand fans and World Cup fans in New Zealand to support the fund.\n\n“New Zealanders understand all too well the trauma and shock caused by the effects of natural disaster,” said Mr White.\n\n“This time it’s one of our South Pacific neighbours which needs help, and I’m sure cricket lovers throughout the country will want to join us in offering assistance.”\n\nDr Norman Gillespie, CEO UNICEF Australia said: “The ICC Cricket World Cup 2015 has driven a spirit of sportsmanship through the competition in Australia and New Zealand.\n\n“However, an extraordinary show of sportsmanship is to give a hand up to another in need, and the international cricket community has shown its true colours in responding for communities in Vanuatu and the other island nations affected by Cyclone Pam,”\n\n“We congratulate the ICC and the entire cricket community for its passionate support of UNICEF’s rapid response to the Cyclone Pam emergency. Please donate, and donate now to keep supplies flowing at http://www.unicef.org.au.”\n\nThe CAF Interclubs Organising Committee issued its decision Today Thursday, 19 March 2015 on the basis of the various reports of the match officials and correspondences between the concerned parties.\n\nThe Committee had received a petition from Nigerian club, Dolphins, through the Nigeria Football Federation. Dolphins did not show up at Rades Stadium (Tunisia) on Saturday, 14 March 2015 at 3pm local time, for the kick-off of the match against Club Africain of Tunisia, for the 1/16th round first leg of the Orange Confederation Cup. The referee acknowledged forfeiture of Dolphins.\n\nThe Committee noted that the Nigeria Football Federation did not observe article 10.2 of Chapter IX of the rules of the competition, which obliges the federation of the visiting team to inform the federation of the host team and CAF of the date of arrival in the capital of the host country at least two weeks prior to the date scheduled for the match. The non-observance of this disposition attracts a fine of $2000.\n\nAs it stands, the club only informed CAF on 13 March 2015 of the fact that it missed its flight between Port-Harcourt and Lagos, and could only arrive in Tunis on the day of the match without requesting for a postponement of the encounter. Even though the request was not made, CAF proposed to the Tunisian team to delay the kick-off of the match by 30 minutes for the sake of fair-play.\n\nIn view of the above, the Committee did not consider that we were facing a case of force majeure and went on to apply Article 17 of Chapter XI of the regulations, which states: “If for any reason whatsoever, a team withdraws from the competition or does not report for a match-except in case of force majeure accepted by the Organizing Committee – or if it refuses to play or leaves the ground before the regular end of the match without the permission of the referee, it shall be considered loser and shall be eliminated from the competition.”\n\nDolphins are thus eliminated without prejudice to other financial sanctions that could be taken by the Committee.\n\nORANGE CONFEDERATION CUP 2015,\n\nThe World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) has announced pledges of USD 6.45 million from world governments in the fight for the clean athletes which will create a joint fund of nearly USD 13 million.\n\nOne of the first initiatives of Olympic Agenda 2020 was the creation of a USD 20 million fund to protect the clean athletes, 10 million of which was to be used in particular to research new techniques to detect prohibited substances and methods. The IOC had called on governments to match the USD 10 million, and WADA, under the presidency of Sir Craig Reedie, has successfully secured pledges of USD 6.45 million, meaning that the WADA-administered fund will have a starting budget of almost USD 13 million.\n\nThe USD 13 million joint fund represents a 50-50 split between the IOC and world governments that responded to a call to match the IOC funding. China, France, Ivory Coast, Japan, New Zealand, Peru, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, Turkey, the United States and Sweden have pledged their financial support.\n\nThe IOC will also administer the balance that remains from the full USD 10 million it approved as part of Olympic Agenda 2020 (remaining balance is USD 3.55 million) as a separate fund for new anti-doping research in the fight against doping. This will be allocated by the IOC to researchers involved in athlete-centred projects, with a science or social focus. Following a call for applications in 2014, the IOC has selected four applications from researchers in Spain and Australia, and further projects will be selected in 2015.\n\n“With Olympic Agenda 2020, we are changing the philosophy with regard to the credibility of sports competitions and of athletes,” said IOC President Thomas Bach. “We must consider every cent in the fight against doping as an investment in the future of Olympic sport, not as an expense. This fund clearly shows that we support innovative anti-doping research that will lead to better protection of the clean athletes.”\n\nIn December 2013 during discussions on Olympic Agenda 2020, the strategic roadmap for the future of the Olympic Movement, the IOC created a fund of USD 20 million aimed at protecting clean athletes from drug cheats and match-fixing and related corruption. Half of the money was earmarked to fund social and scientific research pertaining to anti-doping, the other half to fight match-fixing.\n\nThe IOC, together with WADA, called on world governments to match the amount by 16 November 2014. The funds committed by the 12 governments are payable in full to WADA by 31 March 2016.\n\n“WADA is very pleased with the financial commitments that this partnership has generated for the fight against doping in sport”, said WADA President Sir Craig Reedie. “The fund allocated by the IOC has received the commitment of governments of the world to contribute a total of USD 6,452,296. The funds will provide a tremendous boost to WADA in their efforts to carry out innovative, anti-doping research focussed on protecting the clean athletes.”\n\nThe strategy for distribution of this fund is to complement, but not duplicate, existing anti-doping research programmes. Anti-doping organisations agree that alternative strategies are needed so the priority is innovative and novel research in all areas of anti-doping, which have the potential to lead to a significant change in the way anti-doping programmes are carried out and will have a direct impact on the daily lives of the clean athletes.\n\nThe world governing body of baseball and softball, the WBSC, has announced that the world-famous PEANUTS comic strip icon, Snoopy, will be the official Global Ambassador of the U12 Baseball World Cup 2015, being staged from 24 July – 2 August in Tainan, Chinese Taipei.\n\nWBSC President Riccardo Fraccari said Snoopy’s role with the 2015 U12 Baseball World Cup, the pinnacle platform that is the highest level of competition for 12-year-olds, can help to raise awareness and interest in sport amongst more young people, especially the ‘digital generation’.\n\nThe announcement was made at Daan Forest Park in Taipei City, alongside Tainan Mayor Lai Ching-Te, Taiwan Ministry of Education Deputy Director of Sports Administration Peng Tai-Ling and Chinese Taipei Baseball Association (CTBA) Honorary President Tom Peng, and was followed by a U12 Baseball World Cup ‘live’ dance performance by the life-sized Snoopy and Charlie Brown.\n\n“Baseball and softball support the IOC’s Agenda 2020 under President Thomas Bach, and the focus on youth and sport in society,” Fraccari said. “Snoopy is embraced by many different cultures and societies globally, and Snoopy’s involvement and promotion of the U12 Baseball World Cup can help produce a synergy that we hope can connect more young people with sport and the lasting teachings of sport — on and off the sports field.”\n\nAs part of his role as Global Ambassador of the WBSC U12 Baseball World Cup, Snoopy will be incorporated into the official look and logo of baseball’s 2015 U12 world championship, which will showcase the elite 12-year-old baseball players in the world playing for their National Teams.\n\nVenues in Tainan, where the U12 World Cup will be hosted by the CTBA and City of Tainan through 2019, will have designated areas with signage featuring Snoopy and the rest of the PEANUTS Gang in iconic poses, playing baseball, for fans to visit and engage with as part of the attractions and to share selfies via social media from the 2015 WBSC U12 Baseball World Cup III.\n\nIn addition, Snoopy, who was both a player and manager of the PEANUTS comic strip baseball team, will visit the venues during U12 World Cup competition to interact with fans and deliver an unforgettable in-stadium experience in Tainan.\n\n“Global events that attract and put the focus on the next generation of athletes and fans to grow our sport around the world is a top priority for the WBSC and all our sport’s stakeholders, particularly as we strive to earn a place for baseball and softball in the Olympic Games,” WBSC President Fraccari said. “Snoopy joining our team as the Global Ambassador for the 2015 U12 Baseball World Cup is in perfect alignment with the mission, values and objectives of the WBSC and our sport.\n\nThe U12 Baseball World Cup, now in its third edition, is one of several junior baseball and softball world championships in the portfolio of events conducted by the WBSC, which is hoping for the possible inclusion of baseball and softball at the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games.\n\nWBSC Baseball Marketing Director Masaru Yokoo said: “The WBSC is thrilled to have such an instantly recognisable icon, like Snoopy, on board as the Official Global Ambassador to shine the spotlight on the 2015 U12 Baseball World Cup. Snoopy and the entire PEANUTS Gang have a timeless and universal connection to people of all ages and to the sport of baseball, and that’s why we are extremely confident that the PEANUTS’ presence will help create an exciting atmosphere in Tainan for the teams and fans, and will help elevate brand recognition and the global appeal of the WBSC U12 Baseball World going forward.”\n\nU12 Baseball World Cup Groups and Schedule Revealed\n\nThe groups and competitions schedule for the WBSC U12 Baseball World Cup III were also revealed by the WBSC.\n\nGroup A Group B\n\nNo. 3 Cuba No. 1 Japan\n\nNo. 4 Chinese Taipei No. 2 USA\n\nNo. 8 South Korea No. 12 Mexico\n\nNo. 10 Venezuela No. 14 Australia\n\nNo. 15 Brazil No. 16 Nicaragua\n\nNo. 32 Russia No. 27 France\n\nIt is the first time in history that the top four nations in the world — Japan, USA, Cuba and Chinese Taipei — are featured together at the U12 World Cup.

Some come on a mission to confirm whether Okpekpe is a myth or a living legendary home to people.\n\nOsigbemeh noted that although all investors have the opportunity to invest in hotel accommodations in Okpekpe, the pioneer investors will make a fortune from the retinue of visitors.\n\nHis words: “I am very grateful to the Comrade Governor Adams Oshiomhole and Mr. Mike Itemuagbor, who have lifted Okpekpe to prominence with the this annual road race.\n\n“However, from the previous tournaments, it is obvious that travelers that come during and after the event would have loved to spend longer time in my kingdom end leaving in a hurry due to them lack of hotel accommadtions.\n\nI want to assure investors that if they invest in hotel accommodations and tourism in Okpekpe they will make appreciable profit from the risk.”\n\nSpeaking further monarch said: “Expectedly it is boosting tourism in the community, but the Okpekpe 10 kilometres race is yet to give my community the much awaited commercial advantage owing to the absence of hotels in Okpekpe. By and large, Okpekpe 10 kilometres race has enriched hoteliers in Auchi and its environs.”\n\nOsigbemeh also said that since the institution of the road race, it has been attracting national and international competitors.\n\nAccording to him, it has placed the kingdom on the international map, finally the monarch said that “Okpekpe 10km race has also exposed the community hitherto unheard of before to tremendous publicity.”\n\nThe world’s best table tennis players have arrived in Bremen, Germany for the next stop of the prestigious GAC Group 2015 World Tour Super Series, the German Open.\n\nThe German Open is traditionally one of the most popular World Tour events among the players and fans, with 301 players from 48 countries making their way to Bremen for the fourth World Tour of 2015.\n\nAs usual in Germany, all eyes will be on the local hero and former world number one Timo BOLL (GER). BOLL will be playing his first international event since his semi-final appearance at the Liebherr 2014 Men’s World Cup in October last year.\n\nIf the 34-year-old, who has won this tournament a record four times, wins two matches at the Men’s Singles main draw, he is on course to play an intriguing quarter-final match against his Qoros 2015 World Table Tennis Championships doubles partner, world number one MA Long.\n\nOn this potential match up, BOLL stated: “I always look forward to playing against top players like MA Long.

Assar is placed at number 11, alongside Austria’s Robert Gardos with same points.\n\nThis year, Quadri has attended three World Tours, as he is placed at 17 with 75 points in the singles, while the victory recorded in his partnership with Makanjuola in the men’s doubles as placed them in number nine globally.\n\nTo be listed among the elite names in the world, Assar has made two appearances, the previous one being in Kuwait when he was beaten in the first round by China’s Fan Zhendong.\n\nAruna is at no.17 with 75 points, being level with Korea’s Cho Eonrae, Jeong Samgeun and Kim Minseok, in addition to Poland’s Daniel Gorak and Hong Kong’s Tang Peng.\n\nBelarus’ Vladimir Samsonov continues to lead with 525 points and closely followed by China’s Ma Long, who has 500 points.\n\nChinese Taipei’s Chuang Chih-Yuan is in third place with 300 points; a position he shares with Portugal’s Marcos Freitas, Germany’s Dimitrij Ovtcharov and China’s Xu Xin.\n\nAlso, women’s singles champion at the Lagos Open, Portugal’s Shao Jieni established her name in the Women’s Singles Standings. She is at no.16 with 100 points); a position she shares with Korea’s Jeon Jihee, Hong Kong’s Lee Ho Ching, Japan’s Misako Wakamiya and Germany’s Wu Jiaduo in addition to the Chinese duo of Chen Meng and Wu Yang.\n\nLagos Open’s runner’s up, Egypt’s Dina Meshref is now at no.31 on the Standings (50 points), a position she shares with the Chinese Taipei’s Chen Szu-Yu and Cheng I-Ching as well as with Turkey’s Hu Melek, Monaco’s Yang Xiaoxin and Singapore’s Yu Mengyu.\n\nHowever, on the Under 21 Women’s Singles Standings, Meshref is very much amongst the leading names, as she is with Jieni on the Women’s Doubles listings, the pair being crowned champions in Lagos.\n\nOn the Under 21 Women’s Singles Standings, Meshref is at no.7 (200 points); on the Women’s Doubles order of merit, with Jieni, she is at no.12 (100 points).\n\nMeanwhile, Aruna and Makanjuola are now listed at no.9 on the Men’s Doubles Standings with 100 points, with the combination of Portugal’s Marcos Freitas and Croatia’s Andrej Gacina (550 points) topping the standing.\n\nA first appearance of the year for Quadri and Makunjuola, as a Men’s Doubles partnership;

Brazil’s GUI & YAMADA fought back against Melanie DIAZ & Daniely RIOS to take the doubles match by the narrowest margin, 3-2 (9-11, 11-9, 11-13, 12-10, 14-12). GUI then concluded matters with Adriana DIAZ in a five-games thriller (11-7, 10-12, 12-10, 15-17, 11-9)\n\nAfter the victory, a delighted Hugo HOYAMA, coach of the Brazilian Women’s Team stated “It was excellent not only by the results but also because of the attitude I saw in the players. All matches were really tough, in the end of many matches, they had to give a plus to win; they were able to put the ball on the table when they needed.”\n\nHe added that “It was good to win that way because it will teach us a lot, so we can use it here and also in Toronto for the Pan American Games.”\n\nLikewise for the Men’s Team gold medal match, the Brazilian Men’s Team, represented by Hugo CALDERANO, Cazuo MATSUMOTO and Thiago MONTEIRO, secured the Men’s Team gold, 3-1 against the host nation.\n\nMONTEIRO was the man of the hour as he scored 2 matches for the team, in the Men’s doubles match with teammate MATSUMOTO against Argentina’s Rodrigo GILABERT & Pablo TABACHNIK, and finally 4-1 (8-11, 11-5, 11-7, 11-4) against Gaston ALTO to seal the overall victory for Brazil.\n\nEarlier in the Team finals match, CALDERANO won the first match against TABACHNIK three-nil, after which ALTO accounted for MATSUMOTO to score level the score for Argentina.\n\nCoach of the Brazilian Men’s Team Jean-René Mounié shared after the team victory that “Perhaps it’s not the most important tournament in the year but for the players every tournament is important, it’s a good opportunity for them to be together. Today they showed a good spirit; both Hugo Calderano and Humberto Manhani came through tough matches today and should very good mental strength!”\n\nWith the Team events concluded, all attention now turn to the Singles & Doubles events of the 2015 ITTF-Latin America Championships, which will be played to the semi-finals stage on Wednesday 18 March 2015."
