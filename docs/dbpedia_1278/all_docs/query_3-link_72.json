        "text": "JP is playing singles only this week at the Tiburon Challenger after winning doubles championships in each of his last two tournaments: the Napa Valley $50K Challenger and the Sacramento $100K Challenger. He has 16 career doubles titles with ten different partners.\n\nJP started the Tiburon tournament yesterday with a 76(6) 26 64 win over Steve Johnson in the 1st Round. Smith and Johnson have not faced each other previously on the pro tour, but competed against each other in college when JP played for the University of Tennessee and Johnson played for the University of Southern California. This was a very satisfying win for Smith.\n\n2nd Round Singles was played today with JP facing World No. 123 and No. 2 Seed Rajeev Ram USA. JP Smith won the match 76(2) 64 and advances to the Quarterfinals to face World No. 97 and No. 1 Seed Dennis Kudla.\n\nTiburon Challenger Main Draw Singles\n\nJP Smith and Matt Reid won their semifinal doubles match Saturday against Robert Kendrick USA and the Sacramento Natomas Racquet Club Pro Brian Martinez USA. JP and Matt were definitely NOT the crowd favorite, as a large contingent of club members and youth who take lessons from Martinez were on hand to cheer him on. Smith and Reed, however, prevailed by a score of 76(5) 75 to face Donald Young USA and Jarmere Jenkins USA in the final on Sunday.\n\nThe Doubles Final was a very competitive match played thirty minutes after Donald Young defeated Tim Smyczek in the singles final. Both doubles pairs played great tennis. Smith and Reed took the first set 76(1), Young and Jenkins took the second set 46, and then the Super Tiebreak was won by Smith and Reed 14-12, making them the Champions of the Sacramento $100K Challenger. That makes two Challenger titles in a row for John-Patrick Smith.\n\nHe heads to the Tiburon $100K Challenger to play singles only this week. His 1st Round Singles match will be played Tuesday against Steve Johnson.\n\nJohn-Patrick Smith and Bobby Reynolds defeated Steve Johnson and Tim Smyczek in the Doubles Final at the $50K Napa Valley Challenger today. It was a very energetic and entertaining match with a final score of 64 76(2). The Winners Trophy was a huge etched bottle of wine from the Napa Valley. This is JP’s 15th doubles title, with nine on the ATP Challenger Circuit. This was the first time JP and Bobby Reynolds have played together.\n\nJP is headed to Sacramento tonight to begin playing singles and doubles with Matt Reid on Tuesday at the Sacramento $100K Challenger.\n\nJohn-Patrick Smith is in California for three ATP Challengers: Napa Valley $50K, Sacramento $100K, and Tiburon $100K. He is playing doubles with Bobby Reynolds this week after leaving Taiwan and not being able to arrive in Napa in time for singles. JP and Bobby have reached the final round of doubles, to be played tomorrow. They have had a great time on court together and seem to be the crowd’s favorite doubles team:\n\nFrom Napa, JP will travel to Sacramento to play main draw singles and play doubles with Matt Reid of Australia. The final California Challenger will be in Tiburon, before heading back to the East Coast for the Charlottesville, Knoxville, Champaign swing of the tour and home to Australia in November. It’s been a great year!\n\nJP Smith AUS and Adil Shamasdin CAN played their second round doubles match at the ATP 250 Hall of Fame Tennis Championships in Newport, Rhode Island yesterday. Their opponents were Ivo Karlovic of Croatia, known as the world’s tallest professional tennis player at 6′ 10″, and his partner Divij Sharan of India.\n\nKarlovic and Sharan won the first set 64, but Smith and Shamasdin battled back taking the second set 64. This put a long and intense super tiebreak into play. Unfortunately for Smith and Shamasdin, Karlovic and Sharan got the victory by a score of 19-17. Tough loss, but great match!\n\nJP has been in Knoxville at the University of Tennessee working hard training and doing some rehabilitation to prepare for the next part of the 2013 season. He flew out of Knoxville today to attend ATP University in Miami, FL. This training is required for players with a singles ranking of 200 or above or a doubles ranking of 100 or above.\n\n“The programme, which has seen more than 800 students graduate since its launch in 1990, aims to provide players with a thorough knowledge of ATP world tour operations and the skills necessary for a productive and lasting career. Among the topics … rules and officiating, giving back, one-on-one media training, marketing the tour, nutrition and personal finances.” http://www.atpworldtour.com\n\nJP will travel from Miami to Canada for the Rimouski Challenger which will be played on indoor hard courts beginning March 18th.\n\nThanks for all the support! JP is looking forward to a great season."
