        "text": "No. 2 seeded Dalma Gálfi of Hungary defeated No. 9 seed Sofia Kenin of the United States in the final of the junior girls' competition at the US Open tennis tournament in New York City in the United States. 17-year-old Gálfi is the first Hungarian to capture a title in the history of the US Open. Hungarians seem to win a juniro singles title at a grand slam tournament every five years.\n\nAccording to the tournament's website, the opening set was quiet in terms of opportunities, until Galfi broke her American opponent in front of a packed crowd to jump ahead 3-2. Kenin engaged in long rallies with the big-hitting Hungarian without giving up ground from the baseline, and broke right back.\n\nIt looked like the American would steal the opener when Galfi double faulted to hand her set point, but Kenin could not convert at 30-40 or on her advantage two points later, and her opponent would not let her back into the match.\n\nAfter the Hungarian playerbroke and held to win the first set, she never looked back. Galfi, traded early breaks in the second set with her 16-year-old opponent. But she managed to right the ship and gain an advantage from which she would never look back.\n\nKenin held in a tough service game at 3-5 to give herself a fighting chance, but Galfi closed the door with an ace down the middle, her ninth of the match, to win the championship title.\n\nNo junior from Hungary had ever reached the final of the US Open Junior Championships prior to Gálfi this year. She is the fourth Hungarian to win junior title at a grand slam tournament after Anikó Kapros won the girls' singles title at the Australian Open in 2000, Ágnes Szávay won that title at the Roland Garros in 2005 and Márton Fucsovics took home the Wimbledon crown in the boys' singles in 2010.\n\nGálfi's doubles partner, fellow Hungarian Fanny Stollár made it to the semifinal of the tournament where she lost to Kenin, who thus, prevented an all-Hungarian final."
