        "text": "SARASOTA\n\nAlex Kuznetsov knows what needs to be done.\n\nMore importantly, he knows that it can be done.\n\nThe path that Kuznetsov, a 28-year-old tennis player who resides in Tampa, must take is to win the $100,000 Sarasota Open. It is a long one and the first step begins today with the first round of qualifying at the Lakewood Ranch Tennis and Athletic Center.\n\n\"All I can do is take it one match at a time and see how I do,\" Kuznetsov said.\n\nThe road is treacherous. He would have to win three qualifying matches to reach the main draw, and then five more to win the Sarasota Open title.\n\nDon't tell Kuznetsov it can't be done ... because he has done it.\n\nTwo years ago, Kuznetsov arrived at the tournament with low confidence and a ranking that hardly scared his competition. A week later, he was holding the championship trophy.\n\nIt was a win that kick-started one of the most successful years Kuznetsov has had as a professional player. He followed up his win at the Sarasota Open by making the quarterfinals of his next two tournaments, a streak that got Kuznetsov into the main draw of the French Open for the first time in his career.\n\n\"It would be a great thing to do that again,\" Kuznetsov admitted.\n\nLike 2013, Kuznetsov arrives at the tournament with a year that has had its ups and downs.\n\n\"Some good. Some bad. Things all tennis players go through,\" Kuznetsov says. \"I am trying to get some confidence back, trying to play as many matches as I can.\"\n\nAlso like 2013, Kuznetsov's ranking has slipped past the No. 200 mark. It is a dangerous ranking level that makes it tough to make much headway unless you make a marathon run and experience a week like Kuznetsov had at the Sarasota Open two years ago. \"I remember I was struggling a little bit with my confidence that year as well,\" Kuznetsov said. \"Going through qualifying actually did me some good. I got some matches under my belt. I then played some tough matches in the main draw and beat some pretty good players.\"\n\nHe overcame a couple three-set tests, found his groove, and ripped through Wayne Odesnik in the title match, winning 6-0, 6-2. Kuznetsov then went on to reach the quarterfinals of the next two events to win a playoff set up by the USTA involving three Challenger clay court events, earning the wild card into the French Open.\n\n\"It was my first time in the French Open, a great experience,\" Kuznetsov said. \"A lot of good things came from winning (the Sarasota Open).\"\n\nIt was a revitalization for a player who played in the final of the French Open juniors in 2004, turned pro later that year, then was involved in a car accident in which he broke the femur in his right leg. Surgery included inserting a titanium rod, followed by rehab.\n\nThough he has had a serviceable career, playing in all four Grand Slam events, Kuznetsov's top moments came during the year he won the Sarasota Open. In addition to playing in the French Open, he also qualified at Wimbledon in 2013. By that fall the player who was born in Kiev (now part of the Ukraine) and grew up in Philadelphia had reached his career high ranking of No. 120.\n\nToday, he will be one of 32 players competing for four qualifier spots in the Sarasota Open. Kuznetsov hopes to make the main draw in a tournament that has been won in the past by the likes of Kei Nishikori, James Blake, Sam Querrey and ... Alex Kuznetsov.\n\nBradenton teens\n\nwin Easter Bowl titles\n\nA pair of Bradenton teenagers not only won prestigious titles this week but they each found a creative way to do it. Adam Neff won the boys title and Whitney Osuigwe the girls championship Wednesday in the 14-Under division at the 48th annual ASICS Easter Bowl held in Indian Wells, California.\n\nOsuigwe, who won the 12-Under division at the Junior Orange Bowl in December, had to come back from down 5-2 in the final set, saving a pair of match points along the way to beat top-seeded Alexa Noel, 4-6, 6-0, 7-6 (4).\n\nNeff's 1-6, 6-4, 6-4 win over Jaycer Calleros may have been even more remarkable. Not only did Neff come back from the brink of a loss -- down a set and 1-4 -- he broke the strings in five rackets along the way and, at one point, borrowed a racket from someone in the stands.\n\nWhat: USTA Pro Circuit $100,000 men's tennis tournament When: Today through April 19 (Qualifying Today through Monday; Main draw Monday through April 19) Where: Lakewood Ranch Tennis and Athletic Center Who: World-ranked players competing in singles and doubles on USTA Challenger level Surface: Green clay / outdoors\n\nSARASOTA OPEN"
