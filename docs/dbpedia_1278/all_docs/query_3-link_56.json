        "text": "After Saturday's upsets in major conference tournaments, Sunday's finals were much more predictable.\n\nLast night, the Pac-12 completed its men's final, with top-ranked UCLA defeating USC 4-2 to claim their third victory over the Trojans in four attempts this year. UCLA lost the doubles point but Marcos Giron at No. 2 was the only Bruin to lose in singles, with Dennis Mkrtchian, Adrien Puget, Karue Sell and Clay Thompson earning victories. The match at No. 1, between USC's Raymond Sarmiento and Dennis Novikov, was in the third set, but did not finish when Thompson clinched. USC's Emilio Gomez did not play and teammate Max de Vroome only played doubles. The two teams could play again, for the fifth time this year, in the NCAAs, but that will depend on the seedings and the draw.\n\nThe ACC tournament's finals were both completed indoors, with the Virginia men losing the doubles point to Wake Forest on Duke's courts, but taking four straight-set wins in singles for a 4-1 victory and their seventh straight ACC tournament title. The women were also forced inside, with Miami finishing its 4-1 win over Florida State at North Carolina's indoor facility. It was the Hurricanes' first ACC title, which is somewhat surprising given how good they've been the past ten years.\n\nMichigan had both its teams in the Big Ten final, but neither returned to Ann Arbor with a championship. In the men's final, Ohio State cruised past the Wolverines 4-0 to win its seventh tournament title in the last eight years. I believe that now puts the Buckeyes' home winning streak, the longest in NCAA Division I team sports, at 170.\n\nThe Michigan women had beaten Northwestern 4-3 during the regular season and were the tournament's top seed, but the third-seeded Wildcats came out on top 4-1 Sunday. Last year Northwestern's streak of 13 straight conference tournament titles ended with a semifinal loss to Purdue, but it didn't take them long to return to the top.\n\nIn the Big 12, two teams started streaks, with the Texas women and Oklahoma men collecting their second straight tournament titles. No. 3 seed Texas beat Oklahoma State, the No. 5 seed, 4-0, and Oklahoma, the No. 2 seed, defeated No. 1 Baylor 4-2 in the day's tightest final.\n\nMany of the smaller conferences also decided their automatic bids for the NCAA tournament this weekend. Please see the ITA's Matchday Central for links to all the conference's tournament pages.\n\nThe NCAA selections will be announced on Tuesday at ncaa.com, with the men's show at 5 p.m. EDT and the women's show at 5:30.\n\nThe Pac-12 didn't implement a women's team tournament as it did with the men two years ago, so the Ojai tournament continues to feature the individual singles and doubles champions. UCLA's Kyle McPhillips, the No. 8 seed, defeated No. 3 seed Krista Hardebeck of Stanford 6-1, 6-0 in Sunday's final. Rhiannon Potkey of the Ventura County Star provided this look at the friendship of the two freshmen after they knew they would be playing each other in the final. Complete draws are at the TennisLink site.\n\nMcPhillips was hardly the only player with UCLA ties to succeed in Ojai. Mackenzie McDonald, who will be joining the Bruins this fall, won the Men's Open title unseeded, beating former champion and No. 5 seed Lester Cook 6-7(1), 6-4, 6-1, while former UCLA Bruin Noelle Hickey, the top seed, won the Women's Open, beating No. 2 seed Ashley Harkleroad 0-6, 6-3, 6-1. Hickey and Laura Gordon, a former UCLA player now on its coaching staff, won the Women's Open doubles. The Open draws are at this TennisLink site.\n\nThe USC team of Sabrina Santamaria and Kaitlyn Christian managed to stem the UCLA tide by winning the Pac-12 doubles title for the second straight year. Santamaria and Christian, who have won both ITA majors this school year, beat UCLA's Pam Montez and Courtney Dolehide 6-3, 6-3.\n\nThe junior tournaments at Ojai wrapped up on Saturday, and here is a recap from the Star. Complete draws are at this TennisLink site.\n\nSeventeen-year-old Allie Kiick and 20-year-old Shelby Rogers will meet in the final Sunday of the $50,000 Pro Circuit event in Charlottesville, Va., with the lead in the French Open wild card race on the line.\n\nThe unseeded Kiick, ranked 313, has never reached the final of a $50,000 tournament, but she has been playing well this spring, particularly in qualifying at the Sony Open in Miami last month. Rogers, also unseeded, has been in three finals at the $50,000 level, two of them last year, winning in Yakima, Wash., and losing in Las Vegas, to Lauren Davis.\n\nKiick beat No. 5 seed Julia Cohen in Friday's quarterfinals, the only seed she will have encountered this week, and today defeated unseeded Madison Brengle 6-4, 6-3. Brengle was suffering from a foot injury late in the match but did not retire. Rogers' opponent, unseeded Patricia Mayr-Achleitner of Austria, did retire, with Rogers leading 7-6(5) 4-2. The winner of Sunday's final, which will be streamed at usta.com, will lead in the Har-Tru French Open Wild Card Challenge with one more tournament remaining.\n\nRogers also has reached the doubles final, with Stanford's Nicole Gibbs. Gibbs did an interview this week with Tennis Grandstand, and the 20-year-old confirms what has long been assumed--that she will turn pro after the NCAAs, forgoing her senior year.\n\nAt the men's $50,000 Savannah Challenger, it will be No. 3 seed Ryan Harrison against unseeded Facundo Arguello of Argentina in the final. Harrison is already in the French Open, so that match will have no impact on the men's French Open wild card race.\n\nMost of the conference tournaments will conclude Sunday, in advance of Tuesday's NCAA Division tournament selection announcement, and not all the finalists are the top two seeds.\n\nThe ACC women's final will feature No. 4 seed Miami against No. 7 seed Florida State, after both teams upended higher-ranked teams today by 4-3 scores. Tenth-ranked Miami beat No. 2 North Carolina, with freshman Kelsey Laurente clinching for the Hurricanes at No. 2, taking a 5-7, 6-3, 6-4 decision over Zoe DeBruycker. Florida State, ranked No. 30 this week, beat No. 13 Virginia 4-3. After dropping the doubles point, Florida State got singles wins from the bottom four spots in the order, with Amy Sargeant clinching for the Seminoles with a 76(2), 4-6, 7-5 win over Xi Li at No. 4. Florida State had taken out No. 2 seed Clemson in Friday's quarterfinals, so their ranking will get a boost from this tournament. They also beat Miami in Miami during the regular season.\n\nThe men's ACC final will feature Virginia for the tenth straight year, but the No. 1 seeds will be facing not usual nemesis Duke, but Wake Forest, after the Demon Deacons upset the Blue Devils 4-3. Duke, the No. 2 seed and No. 9 in the ITA rankings, led 3-0, but Wake came all the way back, with Amogh Prabhakar winning a third-set tiebreaker from Michael Redlicki at No. 3 to finish it. According to a Wake Forest tweet, Redlicki was given a game penalty for his fourth overrule in the tiebreaker, trailing 5-0.\n\nAn interesting twist to Sunday's final involves the two head coaches, with Wake's second-year coach Tony Bresky an assistant to Virginia's Brian Boland from 2003-2010.\n\nThe Big Ten did deliver both its top seeds, with the Michigan women and Ohio State men comfortably through, but it is the No. 3 seeds they will face in Sunday's finals. The Michigan men have reached the conference final for the first time after a 4-3 win over No. 2 seed Minnesota, avenging a 4-3 home loss to the Golden Gophers during the regular season. Michael Zhu clinched at No. 5, taking a 2-6, 7-6(5), 7-5 win over Ruben Weber after trailing 6-2, 4-0. Michigan's women will face Northwestern, the No. 3 seed, after the Wildcats disposed of No. 2 seed Nebraska 4-1.\n\nIn the Big 12, No. 1 seed Baylor will meet No. 2 seed Oklahoma in the men's final. The women's semifinals are still in progress. The Pac-12 final between the USC and UCLA men is also not complete as of 8 p.m.\n\nFor links to all the tournament results, see the ITA's Matchday Central page.\n\nIn Ojai today, Easter Bowl champion Gage Brymer won his third consecutive CIF singles title, the first player to accomplish that since Bobby Riggs did it in the 1930s. Brymer defeated Taylor Fritz, who finished third in the 16s Easter Bowl this year, 6-3, 6-0 in the final of the tournament for high school tennis players in Southern California.\n\nIn the women's Pac-12 individual tournament it will be two freshmen going for the title on Sunday, with Stanford's Krista Hardebeck against UCLA's Kyle McPhillips.\n\nAll the draws for the Ojai can be found at the tournament website.\n\nA couple of days ago, I responded to a comment about the USTA's French Open wild card points accrual with the statement that in 2012, the qualifying points were counted in determining the winner.\n\nThis is incorrect. Qualifying points earned do not count in the standings now, nor did they last year, when Brian Baker and Melanie Oudin won the French Open wild cards with their performances in the designated tournaments, now known as the Har-Tru USTA Pro Circuit Wild Card Challenge.\n\nThe fact sheets for the 2013 Har-Tru Challenge, which can be found on the Pro Circuit home page at usta.com, state \"The wild card will be awarded to the American player with the highest total of cumulative singles main draw ATP (or WTA) ranking points...\"(emphasis mine), and I'm told that was the same as last year, and Baker's point total from last year bears that out.\n\nWhy qualifying points wouldn't count, although a minor issue, is a question that has been raised by a few readers, and Lew Brewer, who is the USTA point person on this, provided me with this answer.\n\n\"Our opinion is that we think that's the most fair,\" Brewer told me in a telephone conversation. \"I understand why people would argue why you would want to include the qualifying points--because it's hard to qualify, they've played matches already. The other side of that is that they get extra points if they qualify. They've been around the site for a few days, so they've acclimated, especially if someone is coming from another tournament, and they've had that opportunity to get used to the courts, the facility, the water, all that stuff. I think a lot of times that's why you see some upsets in the the first round, because qualifying players have had a chance to get used to the whole atmosphere. We feel it is just more fair for everyone just to count the main draw points.\"\n\nI personally would like to see the qualifying points count, while recognizing that it's probably never going to matter and is a small part of an otherwise great system for awarding a wild card. My feeling, which I relayed to Brewer, is that the minuscule points on offer for qualifying, where you must win 2 or 3 matches, make this an \"advantage\" that is very expensive in terms of physical exertion. And if the ATP (or WTA) is awarding points for a result, they have determined it has value, so I don't think it's necessary to exclude it from this competition. But my thoughts are just that, and the fact sheet provided the notice necessary to the participants, so the discussion is now just expressing opinions now that I've gotten the facts straight myself.\n\nAnother means of receiving entry into a tournament is via wild card, and this year, as in the past several, the USTA has published the performance-based wild cards awarded for results in junior competition. The wild cards are not always used; for example, last year, both Easter Bowl ITF champions Taylor Townsend and Mackenzie McDonald received entry into the US Open juniors based on their ITF junior rankings. But they are a means for players who do not play the ITF circuit regularly to get into the US Open juniors. Caroline Price, the 2010 USTA 18s Clay Court champion, played the US Open juniors that year due to her wild card, and this year's Easter Bowl ITF champion Gage Brymer is now assured of his place in the draw in New York this September.\n\nGirls Easter Bowl champion Mayo Hibi, however, is another story. Hibi is a Japanese national, who has lived in Southern California for nearly 15 years and is eligible to play in USTA events because she meets the USTA's requirements, but because she has not taken the step necessary to certify herself to represent the USA in ITF team competitions, she cannot be granted the US Open junior wild card she earned with her win at the Easter Bowl. This also extends to a much more important and lucrative wild card into the US Open main draw that goes to the USTA National 18s winner in August, should she win that. My understanding is that Hibi's status isn't permanent; in other words, she could notify the USTA of her intention to represent the United States and be eligible for that US Open main draw wild card (or qualifying wild card if she were to make the 18s final), but as of now she has not done so.\n\nHere is the language, which I don't recall seeing before, on the junior performance-based wild card restrictions.\n\nRules and Restrictions Related to Results-Based Wild Cards:\n\nPlayers/teams qualifying for a wild card are not required apply for the wild card by the deadline; however, an application is preferred - see ITF Junior Tournament Wild Cards and USTA Pro Circuit Wild Cards above.\n\nOnly those players who have not expressed an interest to compete for another country or have not represented another country in ITF team competition are eligible to receive wild cards. Players must have made every effort to become eligible for USA International Team Events and be Jr Davis Cup or Jr Fed Cup eligible.\n\nPlayers must be age eligible by ITF rules to receive wild cards for US Open Junior Championships.\n\nPlayers receiving US Open Junior Championship singles wild cards are expected to sign-up to play in the US Open Junior Championship doubles event.\n\nDoubles wild cards are awarded to teams - players must play with the same doubles partner. For example, if a team wins the The USTA National Championships (Hard Courts) and one of the partners is not age eligible for the US Open Junior Championships, the team will not receive a wild card.\n\nBecause I am at the Easter Bowl or other concurrent USTA events, the only chance I have to see the 12s during the year are at the Eddie Herr and Junior Orange Bowl. I had seen 12s Spring Champion Amanda Anisimova at the Plaza Cup, playing in the 14s in January of this year, but I wasn't familiar with Adam Neff, who won the boys 12s Spring Nationals and a trip to Paris during the French Open to play in an international competition there sponsored by Longines. The Tennis East Coast blog has an interview with Neff's coach Lance Luciani, which provides a look at the young Bradenton resident's training regime and game style.\n\n©Colette Lewis 2013--\n\nRancho Mirage, CA--\n\nIt's not a narrative he can explain, nor does he have a history of comebacks, but Gage Brymer won the Asics Easter Bowl ITF Grade B1 title in what is now predictable fashion Sunday afternoon at the Sunrise Country Club.\n\nDown a set and a break, the unseeded 18-year-old roared back to defeat No. 3 seed Luca Corinteli 3-6, 6-4, 6-1, his fifth three-set win of his six victories this week, and the fourth from a set down.\n\n\"What's funny is that this is the first tournament where that's really been the case,\" said Brymer, an 18-year-old from Irvine, Calif. \"It's not like I'm known for losing the first set. That's just been this week, but it's not too disheartening when I lose the first set now. I don't know if it's a good thing or a bad thing. I'll never count myself out in that second now, but it might be a bad thing because I'm having so many long matches.\"\n\nCorinteli began the match determined not to engage Brymer in a baseline slug fest. He served and volleyed, hit drop shots and angles and played defense, never allowing Brymer to find a rhythm. Although Corinteli is built like a linebacker and does have the requisite serve of someone his size, the 17-year-old from Alexandria, Va. believed he needed to take advantage of his other skills.\n\n\"He stands really far back behind the baseline,\" said Corinteli, who will be joining the Virginia Cavaliers this fall. \"I don't know if it's a tactic because I'm serving pretty big and the balls are kind of flying off these courts. I thought it would be a good idea to serve slice wide, kick wide and come in, use the angles of the court. If someone's standing really far back, you don't want to bang with him, because I don't think he'll miss a ball. I thought it would be a good idea, it's something I'm comfortable with and I do it a lot and it was definitely a part of my game plan the whole week. I'm not completely a serve and volley type of player, but it's something that's in my toolbox and something I can use in the future for sure.\"\n\nCorinteli saw three set points come and go in the opening set, with a perfect backhand volley finally securing it. In the second set, Brymer needed seven deuces before he held in the first game, but he was broken for 2-1 in the second and went down 3-1 when Corinteli held. Brymer took the next two games, and then demonstrated his tenacity serving at 3-3, winning another seven-deuce game to go up 4-3. After two more holds, Corinteli played his worst game of the match serving at 4-5, double faulting twice, including on game point, and missing a volley and netting a backhand to get broken at love.\n\nThe start of the third set went no better for Corinteli. He double faulted on game point again to go down 2-0, and it was 5-0 before he finally held, ending a seven-game losing streak.\n\nBrymer said that seeing the finish line and yet maintaining his focus was difficult at that stage.\n\n\"I think it's an incredibly tough place to be, 5-0, 5-1, 5-2,\" said Brymer, who will be joining the UCLA Bruins this fall. \"It's much harder to close it out than it is to get up 5-0. Those last couple of games are very tough, and to be honest, I got nervous at 5-0 and 5-1. But I did the best I could to shake off the nerves and pull out that last game at 5-1.\"\n\nCorinteli saved two match points and had a break point in the final game, but Brymer held on for the victory, adding an Easter Bowl ITF title to the 16s championship he won in 2011.\n\nBrymer is not planning a lengthy celebration, however, as he returns to school at University High in Irvine on Monday and will play a match with his team there on Tuesday.\n\n\"I have a little bit of a break tomorrow, but then I've got to get right back on the horse,\" said Brymer, who is the third consecutive UCLA recruit to win the Easter Bowl ITF, joining Marcos Giron and Mackenzie McDonald. \"I'm looking to close out my senior year with a really good high school season as well. It means a lot.\"\n\nThe tournament's last day provided ideal conditions for excellent tennis, with temperatures in the upper 70s and no wind, with 14-year-old CiCi Bellis making the most of her second straight trip to an Easter Bowl final, this time in the 16s division.\n\nBellis, the No. 8 seed, who had lost in the 14s championship match in 2012, put that disappointment out of her mind with a 6-4, 6-1 win over No. 7 seed Caroline Dolehide.\n\n\"I thought about it a little bit before the match,\" said Bellis, from Atherton, Calif. \"I obviously wanted to win today, but I really didn't want to think about that. I tried my hardest and it just didn't happen.\"\n\nBellis had several better memories to draw on, as she had swept the European 14-and-under majors at Teen Tennis in England and Les Petits As in France this year, taking all four titles in singles and doubles. Bellis believed that her experience in Tarbes helped her on the Sunrise Country Club stadium court Sunday.\n\n\"There they had umpires to call the lines and ball kids and everything too,\" said Bellis. \"I feel that gave me a lot more experience for this. I really love that--playing in front of people, playing on center court, everything.\"\n\nBellis started the match with all the poise of a longtime veteran, but Dolehide came back from two breaks down to even the first set at 4-4. Serving at 4-all, Dolehide, a 14-year-old from Hinsdale, Ill., had a game point for a 5-4 lead, but Bellis came up with the shots she needed to break, then held for the first set.\n\n\"I had a game point and she just hit a winner on that,\" said Dolehide. \"I didn't feel tired, but I felt I needed to pick it up to stay with her. She's pretty consistent and all her balls are pretty deep. I missed a little bit too much to stay in the match.\"\n\nAlthough Dolehide was down early in the second set, falling behind 3-0, the games were long and the points entertaining. The 5-foot-8-1/2-inch Dolehide used her serve and her power to keep Bellis from dictating the points, but it was Bellis who managed to find ways to win those close games.\n\n\"She was actually the one being aggressive there,\" Bellis said of the first few games of the second set. \"Her serve is really good so I just had to try to get that back, and if there was a second serve, I had to attack it.\"\n\nBellis came close to seeing another 4-1 lead erode, but after saving a break point and surviving a couple of deuces, she held for 5-1, and broke Dolehide for the win.\n\nAfter a family dinner to celebrate, Bellis will return to competition, concentrating on ITFs and the 18s division in USTA events.\n\nThe boys 16s singles final, which closed the tournament Sunday afternoon, was not a competitive match, with 16s Winter National champion and top seed Sameer Kumar adding an Easter Bowl title to his resume with a 6-0, 6-0 rout of No. 17 seed Kalman Boyd.\n\nKumar, a 15-year-old from Carmel, Ind., hadn't played on stadium court throughout the week, so he and his coach Bryan Smith came out to practice on it after Saturday's matches in preparation for the final.\n\n\"We hit here to kind of get a feel for the court, get used to it, see the conditions, see how the wind was,\" said Kumar. \"I think that helped quite a bit today.\"\n\nKumar dominated Boyd, who was playing in his first USTA Level 1 final, allowing him only 19 points total and finishing the match in 45 minutes.\n\n\"After a tough match yesterday (winning 7-5 in the third over No. 3 seed Taylor Fritz) I thought I recovered very well,\" said Kumar. \"I felt physically perfect. I felt I could go for hours.\"\n\nBoyd, who had reached the semifinals in the 16s division at the International Spring Championships in Carson, couldn't match Kumar's energy and resilience.\n\n\"I just couldn't hang with him,\" said Boyd, of Rancho Sante Fe, Calif. \"I just got way too tired after each point and he was fresh. I guess he was more mentally tough or something, because after each point I was dead, just trying to recover. He played better today.\"\n\nKumar is undecided about which age division he'll play at this summer's USTA Clay Courts, but he is definitely going for the 16s title in Kalamazoo this summer.\n\n\"That's the goal for the year,\" said Kumar. \"That's been the goal since the beginning of the year, to win Kalamazoo. I think I'm well on my way to that.\"\n\nThe boys 18s doubles title went to No. 2 seeds Spencer Papa and Jordi Arconada of Argentina, who defeated No. 4 seeds Mackenzie McDonald and JC Aragone 6-1, 7-5.\n\nPapa had originally planned to play with Stefan Kozlov, with the pair already two-time doubles champions during the South American swing, but when Kozlov withdrew after winning the International Spring Championships in Carson, Papa had little time to find a replacement. Arconada, who trains at the Junior Tennis Champions Center in College Park, Md., didn't have a partner, so they agreed to join forces for the first time.\n\nThey went to a match tiebreaker in their opening match, but that was all the time they needed to feel comfortable.\n\n\"The first match we kind of struggled a little,\" said Arconada. \"But we pulled through, 10-7 in the breaker. The guy's a beast.\"\n\n\"By the second match we were playing pretty well,\" said Papa, who trains with the USTA in Boca Raton.\n\nAgainst McDonald and Aragone, Papa and Arconada were forced to find way over and around their opponents.\n\n\"They were both coming to the net pretty well and volleying pretty well, so we had to find little holes to pass them,\" said Papa. \"Jordi did a good job with that, finding the down the line. We were being really aggressive with a lot of energy.\"\n\n\"In the second set, we had a lot of chances, deuce points, but they definitely stepped it up,\" said Arconada. \"They played much better in the second set.\"\n\nAfter her loss in singles Sunday morning, Dolehide had a second chance at a gold ball in the afternoon and she grabbed it, winning the 16s doubles with Brienne Minor. Dolehide and Minor, the No. 1 seeds, beat No. 3 seeds Emma Higuchi and Rebecca Weissman 1-6, 6-4, 6-2.\n\nFor complete 16s results, see the TennisLink site.\n\nThe 18s ITF results are here."
