        "text": "BINGHAMTON – A year ago, Bradley Klahn entered the final day of the Levene Gouldin & Thompson Tennis Challenger with the chance to win both the singles and doubles title.\n\nNow, it’s Sergiy Stakhovsky’s turn.\n\nThe 28-year-old Ukrainian withstood a spirited challenge from Great Britain’s Daniel Cox for a 6-2, 6-4 victory in a singles semifinal Saturday at Recreation Park.\n\nThe second-seeded Stakhovsky will meet eighth-seeded Wayne Odesnik, a 6-1, 6-2 victor over Takanyi Garanganga in Saturday’s first semifinal, for the singles title 11 this morning. That will be followed by the doubles final pitting Stakhovsky and Marius Copil against the team of Cox and Daniel Smethurst. Admission is $6.\n\nLast year, Klahn lost the singles final to Alex Kuznetsov before teaming with Michael Venus to defeat Adam Feeney and John-Patrick Smith in the doubles final. No player in the 21-year history of the tournament has won both the singles and doubles title in the same year.\n\n“I’m excited to get to the finals,” Stakhovsky said. “I didn’t expect that I’d be playing that well this week, I was more expecting to get into form by the end of the week.\n\n“I’m happy to be consistent all week long and looking forward to (today).”\n\nStakhovsky broke Cox’s serve in the opening game of both the first and second sets.\n\nIn the first set, a well-placed drop shot by Stakhovsky at 0-40 put him the early break, he later broke Cox again to go up 5-2 before serving out the set.\n\nIn the second set, a misfired return by Cox at 30-40 gave Stakhovsky the first-game break. Both players held serve the remainder of the match, Stakhovsky putting the finishing touches on the victory with a backhand volley.\n\n“It gives you a little confidence,” Stakhovsky said of the early breaks in both sets. “You’re already a step up and that means he needs to do something better. Even if he breaks you you’re still even. It was a great start, both sets were good for me.”\n\nCox acknowledged the early breaks were a big factor, especially in light of a Stakhovsky serving performance in which he had 10 aces and won 74 percent of his points.\n\n“I lost a few big points on my service game, and if you let these kind of guys get a little bit of a lead, they get really confident and outplay you,” Cox said. “I’m happy with the week, disappointed right now that I lost, but I tried my best so no excuses.”\n\nWhile the Stakhovsky/Cox match was seemingly more evenly-played than the score might suggest, Odesnik was dominant in his victory over Garanganga.\n\nThe American won the first five games — helped by numerous unforced errors by Garanganga — en route to winning the first set. When the Zimbabwean stepped up his game in the second set, Odesnik responded in kind, the big moment a running forehand down the line for a winner to break Garanganga and go up 3-2 in the second set.\n\nOdesnik would not lose another game, earning his berth in the finals when Garanganga hit a forehand long on match point.\n\n“I think I started the way I wanted to, with good intensity and I put him under pressure,” said Odesnik, in his second LG&T Challenger final, having lost in 2011 to Paul Capdeville, 7-6 (4), 6-3. “He started to play a little bit better (in the second set), it seemed like the crowd got behind him, I’m sure they wanted to see a little more tennis.”\n\n“I just tried to stay focused and keep with my gameplan.”\n\nGaranganga, who had won three three-set matches to advance to the semifinals, didn’t help his cause when he tweaked his right leg during the fourth game of the second set while jumping in anguish over a missed shot. A successful conversion of the shot would have set up a break point and a chance to go up 3-1 in the second set. Instead, Odesnik had an ace on the next point to tie the set at 2.\n\n“It hindered my movement a little bit,” said Garanganga of the thigh injury, which required about 10 minutes of treatment from a trainer. “But I really couldn’t get into a rhythm earlier in the match. He took advantage of that and made me move a lot more. It just wasn’t my day.”"
