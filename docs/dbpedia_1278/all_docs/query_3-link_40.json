        "text": "Ruben Ramirez-Hidalgo may not have known what time zone he was in on Monday afternoon, but it didn't take him long to get his bearings once he stepped on the tennis court.\n\nAfter winning the ATP Challenger Tour Visit Panama Cup in Panama City, Panama, on Sunday evening, Ramirez-Hidalgo continued his winning ways by knocking out No. 1 seed Mardy Fish 2-6, 6-2, 6-4 in the first round of the ATP Pro Circuit Savannah Challenger at the Franklin Creek Tennis Center at The Landings. The 35-year-old Spaniard, ranked No. 103 in the world, didn't arrive in Savannah until Monday and played a sluggish first set before coming to life against his American counterpart.\n\nOther than Fish's early departure, the top seeds held serve on Tuesday with five of the top eight seeds advancing to the second round. The No. 6 seed, American Jack Sock, was upset by unseeded Russian Teymuraz Gabashvili in straight sets 6-4, 6-1, and the No. 8 seed, American Tim Smyczek, was knocked out 7-5, 7-5, by unseeded Argentinian, Facundo Arguello.\n\n\"In the first set, I was a little tired and slow, but I told myself to relax and enjoy the game because I was playing against a good player in a good match,\" said Ramirez-Hidalgo, who was forced to take seven weeks off earlier this year due to a recurring ankle injury. \"I started to play better, and (Fish) started to make some mistakes. He doesn't usually play for a long time, so he started to look tired.\"\n\nTrailing 4-3 in the third set in his first appearance in the Savannah Challenger, Ramirez-Hidalgo broke Fish's serve and proceeded to hold serve and break Fish again to seize the victory. In the deciding game, Fish led 40-15 before Ramirez-Hidalgo rallied to force deuce and then closed out the match on a Fish mishit.\n\n\"I'm so happy to come back (from the ankle injury) like this,\" said Ramirez-Hidalgo, who has a 68-130 career singles record and whose highest world ranking in singles was No. 50 in 2006. \"This is not normal. I need time to recover, because there was pain in my legs and all of my body and I don't know how I won.\"\n\nFish, currently ranked No. 42 in the world, was ranked No. 7 in the world in 2011 and has won more than $7 million in singles and doubles during his career, but he struggled to land his first serve against Ramirez-Hidalgo. He grabbed his racquets and exited the court with the fans, immediately leaving the tennis complex following the match.\n\nWhile the day's final match provided the most excitement, former Olympic gold medalist Nicolas Massu from Chile won one of the longest matches in the Savannah Challenger's five-year history over Ukrainian Denys Molchanov. Massu, who won qualifying matches on Saturday, Sunday and Monday, outlasted Mochanov 6-4, 6-7 (5), 7-6 (4) in a match that endured for 3 hours and 56 minutes.\n\n\"I had two match points up 5-3 in the second set and could have ended the match in an hour and 20 minutes,\" said a visibly tired Massu, who won gold medals in both singles and doubles in the 2004 Olympics in Athens, Greece. \"I played almost two more hours for one more point. I had so many chances to win, because I was always up in the match.\"\n\nIt's been a frustrating year for Massu, once ranked as high as No. 9 in the world in 2004, following elbow injuries which sidelined him in 2011 and 2012. Now ranked No. 571 in the world, the 33-year-old veteran has been forced to play qualifying matches just to get into the main draw of ATP Pro Circuit challenger tournaments, and he's lost several three-set matches in heartbreaking fashion.\n\n\"Normally, matches like this one, I lose,\" said Massu, who will play 2012 Savannah Challenger runnerup Wayne Odesnik today. \"I need to improve my ranking, so maybe if I had won some of those matches I wouldn't be where I am. This match was very important for my confidence.\"\n\nMore information for the Savannah Challenger is available at savannahchallenger.com.\n\nSAVANNAH CHALLENGER\n\nMen's Singles\n\nFirst Round\n\nR Ramirez Hidalgo (ESP) def.
