        "text": "Spinal surgeon Dr. Mary Neal is the author of the #1 New York Times bestseller and Books for a Better Life finalist, \"To Heaven and Back\" (Waterbrook-Multnomah, May 2012). As a result of her extensive medical training, she was definitely a skeptic before drowning on a South American river changed her perspective forever. She experienced God’s pure love and learned to trust the truth in all of God’s promises. She has been interviewed and featured as a guest on many national and syndicated television and radio shows, in documentaries, and in print media. She has traveled throughout the world sharing her experiences and her life-changing insights and observations. In the hope that her observations and practical advice will help others develop the trust that leads to a joy-filled life, she was prompted to write her new book \"7 Lessons from Heaven\" (Convergent, September 2017). Originally from Michigan, she completed her medical and surgical training in California and now lives in Jackson Hole, Wyoming.\n\nRead full bio"
