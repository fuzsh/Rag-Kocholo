        "text": "Praise\n\n“Mary Neal is the sort of friend – and doctor – we all want to have. Compassionate, kind, thorough, knowledgeable, healing in the best sense of the word. In her newest book she calls on all of those gifts to explain the unexplainable and show how the heavenly impacts earth.”\n\n– Rick Hamlin, executive editor, Guideposts magazine and author of Pray for Me\n\n“One of the most important questions we can ask ourselves in this earthly lifetime is whether or not we believe in God. Through sharing her personal experience and exceptional insight in 7 Lessons, Dr. Mary Neal paints a beautiful picture of heaven and has outlines a perfect path for us to follow on our quest for knowing our loving, personal, trustworthy God. I hope when you finish these pages, when you are asked if you believe in angels or God, you can firmly say, with absolute trust, “I Do!”\n\n– Deanne Breedlove\n\n“I love the way Mary so winsomely and beautifully describes the relationship we can and were created to have with God. The statement, “one man’s experience trumps another man’s opinion,” is very applicable to Mary’s life and the content of this book. She shares with passion and conviction what she has personally experienced so that we might embrace the truth and promise of it all. This is a must read!”\n\n–Terry Meeuwsen, Co-host of The700 Club\n\n“Are there any questions more important than what happens when we die or whether God is real? Mary Neal’s wonderfully clear but utterly extraordinary explanation of her experience is itself a gift from heaven to all of us. I am absolutely thrilled we have it and recommend it highly.”\n\n–Eric Metaxas, #1 New York Times Bestselling author of Miracles: What They Are, Why They Happen, and How They Can Change Your Life and host of the nationally syndicated Eric Metaxas Show\n\n“You must read this book. The new details of Mary Neal’s encounter with God are glorious, the collection of near death experiences through history is compelling, and the evidence for God is overwhelming. But best is Mary’s recipe for personal joy through trust in God.”\n\n–Douglas Ell, author of Counting to God\n\n“In 7 Lessons from Heaven, Dr. Mary Neal shares more about her inspiring near death experience and God’s profound love for us. Her powerful testimony and the practical advice she gives on accepting God’s love, forgiveness, and trusting Him completely is life-changing and should not be missed.”\n\n–Immaculee Ilibagiza, best-selling author of Left to Tell and Led by Faith\n\n“Having spent time with Dr. Mary Neal, I appreciate that this disciplined, analytical surgeon put her own near-death experience to the test while remaining committed to scripture. If you want practical ways to bring more of Heaven into your life today, Dr. Neal shows how.”\n\n–John Burke, pastor and author of New York Times bestseller Imagine Heaven\n\n“Dr. Mary Neal is a fine, caring physician who took a profound journey into the next life when she died. Near death experiences have now entered into the consciousness of the medical profession, and Dr. Neal’s astonishing book shares a wealth of practical and inspiring spiritual lessons gained from her journey to the other side. This is truly a delightful and extraordinary book.”\n\n–Raymond Moody, MD, author of Reflections on Life After Life, (Harrisburg, PA: Stackpole Books, 1977)"
