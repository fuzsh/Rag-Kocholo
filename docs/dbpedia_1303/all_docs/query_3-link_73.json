With records broken and competitions won, 1998 was filled with very interesting games, races and tournaments to reminisce about.\n\nVive la France\n\nIn football, the 16th FIFA World Cup took place this year in France. France had defeated Morocco in the bidding process, and it was the second time in the tournament’s history that France had held it. Up to 2022, it is the longest World Cup tournament, spanning 32 days. France played against Brazil in the final, winning 3-0 with player Zidane scoring two goals to put the team in a great position.

An NFL franchise record was reached on February 5 when Tom Clancy, the American novelist, signed a deal to purchase the Minnesota Vikings for just over 200 million dollars.

This achievement meant he broke the single season home run record of 61, which Roger Maris held since 1961. As well as this outstanding record-break, the 1998 World Series took place between October 17-22, with the final bringing the New York Yankees championship total to 24 when they won against the San Diego Padres. This means they tied with the Montreal Canadiens for the record of the most championships won by a North American professional sports team. They also overtook the Chicago Cubs for the record of the most overall wins in a single season in the history of MLB, with 125 wins, and won their second title in 3 years.\n\nBack to the top ↑\n\nThe Monica Lewinsky Scandal\n\nThe Monica Lewinsky scandal was a very controversial American political sex scandal, involving US President Bill Clinton and White House intern at the time Monica Lewsinky, who was in her early twenties. In 1995, Clinton and Lewinsky had begun a sexual relationship, continuing on and off until 1997. Lewinsky began a job at the Pentagon, leaving her position at the White House and spoke about the affair to her coworker, Linda Thripp.\n\nIn secret, Thripp began to tape some of the meetings she had with Lewinsky discussing the relationship, with news of the affair being broadcast in 1998. Thripp had shared the tapes with Lucianne Goldberg, who was an anti-Clinton conservative and literary agent, who had encouraged Thripp to record their conversations despite this going against the taping laws in Thripp’s home state of Maryland. News of their affair had reached Paula Jones, a woman who previously worked for the government and filled a lawsuit against President Clinton for sexual misconduct when he was the governor of Arkansas in 1991.\n\nWhen their relationship was made public, and quickly became a national controversy, Clinton denied the relationship, assuring the public that he had not had sexual relations with Lewinsky. He himself stated: “I did not have sexual relations with that woman, Miss Lewinsky.”\n\nOn August 17, Clinton admitted to engaging in “inappropriate intimate physical contact” with the White House intern, despite publicly denying any involvement with Lewinsky. Following this, Clinton took to national television to apologise for his actions and previous denial. Independent counsel Kenenth Starr then put together a 445-page report detailing the sexual encounters between the two, and put forward 11 causes for impeachment. The report, known as the Starr report, was soon made public by Congress and it was published as a book. In turn, the book became a bestseller.\n\nThe House of Representatives voted on Clinton’s impeachment, making him only the second President in history to be impeached after Andrew Johnson in 1868. They approved two articles for impeachment, one for perjury, and one for obstruction of justice. Following a five-week trial in the US Senate, Clinton would be acquitted for his actions. Despite the scandal, Clinton managed to finish his second presidential term and even had high approval ratings. He settled the Paula Jones lawsuit but didn’t actually admit he had done anything wrong, agreeing to $850,000. While President Clinton’s reputation was largely unscathed, Lewinsky became a public name and faced extreme public scrutiny.\n\nBack to the top ↑"
