        "text": "Mary C. Neal, M.D., is a board-certified orthopaedic surgeon, former Director of Spine Surgery at the University of Southern California, and a founding partner of Orthopaedic Associates of Jackson Hole, Wyoming. She received her medical degree from the University of California at Los Angeles School of Medicine, where she also trained in general surgery before completing an orthopaedic surgery residency at the University of Southern California. She went on to complete three fellowships in spinal surgery, trauma, and spin rehabilitation at highly-respected hospitals in Sweden, Switzerland, and California. Dr. Neal has published multiple articles and book chapters and is a member of numerous medical professional associations in the United States.\n\nDr. Neal is committed to the causes of environmental stewardship, individual responsibility for making the world a better place, and increasing awareness of Godâ€™s presence, love and grace. She has served as an elder in the Presbyterian Church of Jackson Hole, as a member of the board of directors for several non-profit organizations, and created the Willie Neal Environmental Awareness Fund .\n\nAn avid sportswoman, Dr. Neal participates in recreational and competitive skiing, kayaking, bicycling, as do her husband, William C. Neal, M.D., and their children. In 1999, while on vacation kayaking in the Los Rios region of southern Chile, she became trapped inside a waterfall and drowned. Before being resuscitated, she had a remarkable, joyful experience of going to heaven and engaging in direct communication with angels. As an inspirational speaker, she lectures publicly about this transformational event and how it has impacted her life and her family, as well as the important lessons it holds about the meaning and purpose of our lives.\n\nShe currently lives and works in Jackson Hole, Wyoming."
