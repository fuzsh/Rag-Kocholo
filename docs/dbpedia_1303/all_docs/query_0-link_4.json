The political relations between Great Britain and Ireland, which had been in a state of c^ntiiiuoiis tension since the foundation of the Home Rule movement in 1870, at once became acute witl\\ the outbreak of the Great War. German a^ent. were aetiv in Ireland, and on Easter Monday, 1916, tlicro was a rising bi Dublin, the insurgents seizing the Post Office and other ]>ubiic builuiiigs, and proclaiming an Irish Republic. The rebellion was abortive, but the political results were far-reaching. The old ‘ Home Rule’ party was discredited, ?ud place taken by the ‘Sinn Fein’ or ])hysicai force party, wiiose nominees, at the General Election of 1918, swept the country with the exception of the six North-Eastern Counties, where the electors with equal determination deC.ared for continued membership of the United Kingdom. To meet the dilliculty a new Government of Ireland \\ct was ])asscd in 1920, under which separate Parliaments were set up for Southern Ireland (26 counties), and Nortliern Ireland (6 counties)— the two bodies to choose a joint ‘ Council of Ireland,’ consisting of forty inemhcm, intended as a connecting link. The Ulster Unionists acce})ted this scheme, and the NoGhorn Parliament was duly elected on May 24, 1921, and opened by tlie King in I’lerson in the followiiig June. The Sinn Fein party, however, refused to work the Act, and their elected meml>eis assemhlerl in the Dublin Mansion House and again proclaimed the Republic, witli Mr. Edmond de Valera as President. A period of complete chaos followed. The British Government deelared the Irish PtJiliaTnent — ■ Dail Eireann — to be an illegal body, made many arrests, suppressed news- papers, and seized the ortices, books, j)apers and funds of the Sinn Fein Association. Sinn Fein, in its turn, formed a botly calling itself the Irish Republican Army, and carrii'd on a guerrilla war accompanied by outrage and assassination. At length, after much bloodshed and destruction of property, a truce Avas declared on July 7, aud the British Government and the Government of tlie Iris!) ‘ Republic’ each appointed a Delegation for the purpose of discussing a settlement. After prohmged negotiations eighteen Articles of Agreement Avere draAvn up and duly signed oii December 6, 1921, subject to their ratification by Tarliament aud by Dail Eireann. To prevent the delay involveil in the drafting aud ]iassiug of an Act of I’arliamciit, and the further risk of another outbreak, it AAras provided that the articles should bo at once adopted by both bodies, and a Provisional Government set up in Ireland to carry on for a period not exceeding ‘iwelve months, until a legal Administration Avas ready to take its place. The discussion in the Dail was prolonged and acrimonious, but the Articles Averc ultimately adopted on January 7, 1922, by a narroAv majority. In conse- quence of this vote Air. de Valera resigned liis ollice of President, and Mr. Arthur Griltlth was clec(e<l in hi.s place. On January 16 the Provisional Government Avas constituted !}s folloAVs : — Finance ami General. — Alicheal 0 Coileaiii (Alichael Collins). Home Jffairs. — Eainon 0 Ougain (Edmund Dugan). Foreign A ffairs. — GaAan Duffy. • Feonoinic Affairs. — v’aoimbghin 0 Huigin (Kevin Higgins). Labour. — Seosamli Alag Crait (Joseph MeGrath). AgricuUnre. — Padraig 0 Hogaiu (Patrick Ilogan).

Tlie old Irish Oovej-nment, Lord FitzAlan as Lord Lieytonaut representing tlie King, at once rScognisod the I'rovisional (Government, handed over the public otiices at Dublin Castle, and took |tcp% for tluf transfer by Orders in Council of the necessary powers. The unifying Act (tl^‘ DLsh Free SLHe (Agreement) Act) re(|uired for the legal establishment of the Jlisli Covern- inent, and the Act embod\\dng the terms of tlio new Irish Free State Con- stitutioii,*will, it is expected, bl passed „in the course of tV’ present year. The Bank of Ireland has been appointed the ofltclfd banker of t^e Iiish Government. ^ The outline laid down in the Artich^s of Agreement and approved by bot^i sides, contains the following })rovisious : — Ireland to have the status ‘in the community of nations known as tlie British Empire’ of a Sedf-Governing Dominion and to he called tlie Irish Free State. Its j'osition in relttion to the Imperial Barliainont and Goveriiment to he that of the Dominion of Canada, and the leprescntativi' ot the crown in Ireland to be a]>pointed in like manner v*s the (iovei nor-Geiieral of Canada. The share of the Free State in the debt of the United Kingdom and otlier charges to he determined, in default of agreement, hy ‘ OJie or more inde- pendent persons being citizens (^f the Britisli hhnjiire.’ Tlie Irish Free State to undertake its own coastal defence, Die defence !>>’ sea of Great Britain and Ireland being undertaken hy tlio Inipcj ial forces : these pirovisioiis to he reviewed at the exjiirAtion of fivoj’eais. ’J'he Free State to afford in time of ‘war or strnined relations' with other poweis, such harbour and other facilities as the British Government may reijuire. liehiml may establish a military defence force ])ro])uitionate to its population.

NORTHERN IRELAND (See fflso p. 7 below).

Tlic primary organs of the League are the Council, Assembly and Secretariat. The Council consists of the Great Powers membfra of the l^eaguo, i. f. ITance, Great Britain, Italy and Japan, and four other powers sefteted by the Assembly— at present Belgium, Brazil, Cliina and Spain. Each power has one representative and one vote on tl*e Council. All the members of the League have one vote and not more tliau three representatives in the Assembly of^he League. The members of the Council and Assembly ai*t as the representatives of their Governments. Both the Council and Assembly may deal at their meeiings ‘with any matter within the .sphere of action of the League or afi'ecting the peace of the world.’ Members of the l.eague must submit disputes to the Council of the As.sembly. Resolutions of the As.sernbly or Council must be unanimous, except on matters of procedure (voted by a simple mijority), tin* admiasiwi of new members (two-thirds majority of the Assembly), and amendments to the Covenant (a three-fourths majority of the Assembly, including all the members of the Council). The Council must rneet at least once a year, and has in practice met 16 times during the last two years of the League’s existence. The first Assembly decided that the Ahsembly was to meet on the first Monday in every Weptomber, and the second Assembly accordingly met on September 5, 1921. * '' The Council and Assembly are two independent bodic.s with many common and some distinct functions. The Covenant lias left their relations undefined, to be adjusted in practice, but in general it may be sai<l that the Council is an executive and initiative organ, and the Assembly a deliberative body, controlling and lajing down tire lines of general League policy. The members of the Council arc : (Temiiorary) M. Paul Hymans (Belgium), ex-Minister for Foreign Affairs. •-(Temporary) M. Gastao da Cunha (Brazil), Ambassador to i*ari.si. (Temporary) Mr. Wellington Koo (China), Minister to London. (Permanent) M. Leon Bourgeois (France), President of the Senate. (Permanent) Sir Arthur J, Balfour, K.O.

The Argentine (bBcrninent has not given notice of an intentlori to leave the liCag^ue, and appears to regaia itself as in a .state of suspended or puH.slve membership, to continpe until somj measure rfgA*ded as a satisfactory equivalent to the amendment pioposed by the Argentine has l>een adofted by the l.cague. * Signed the treaties concerning protection of national minorities as a condition of their entry into the League. • • • The following States are not yet members of the Tjoague United States, G#i'many, Kus^a, Turkey, Egypt, Hungary, Ecuador, Mexico.

The Secretariat acts as a link between the various organs of the League. The Secre^^ariat is responsiide for the archives of the League, collects the information, makes all the arrange- ments for, and prej'ares the agenda of the meetings of all League bodies, and waushes over the execution of the decisions taken at these meetings. The Secretariat numbers 350 men and The preseiu S ’-cretary-General (appointed under the annex to the Covenant) is Sir James Eric Draniraond, K.C. M.O., C.B. There are three Under-Secretaries-General : M. Jean Monnet (French, I *pntv Secret: ’y-General), Professor 11.

III. SEGONDA.TY ORGANS. Tlie League also includes several secondary org.anisations, whose purpOvSe it is to prepare and carry on (with the advice and aiij>roval of the Council and Assembly, and through tlie Secretarial) international co-operation in non-political field.s. A list of these secondary organisations and their functions is given herewith, but does not include the temporal y o.if hoc agf.iits and cymimissions the Council and As.sembly have appointed from time to time to carry out^a given piece of work or conduct some special investigation or enquiry. .
