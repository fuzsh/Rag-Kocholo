        "text": "On September 13, 2022 the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service announced a proposal to list the tricolored bat as endangered under the Endangered Species Act. The bat faces extinction due to the impacts of white-nose syndrome, a deadly disease affecting cave-dwelling bats across the continent.\n\nPublic Meeting and Virtual Public Hearing\n\nPress Release\n\nInformational Webinar\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nProposed Rule\n\nSpecies Status Assessment\n\nSaving the Tricolored Bat Story\n\nNew Draft Tools Available for Preview\n\nThe Service is currently developing new tools and guidance documents for the endangered northern long-eared bat (NLEB) and the proposed endangered tricolored bat (TCB). In the event that the tricolored bat is listed as endangered under the Endangered Species Act, these tools would be applicable to both species. The Service is sharing drafts of the new tools and guidance documents for interested parties to preview (see “New Draft Tools” below).\n\nThe Service is providing this preview so that interested parties can familiarize themselves with these tools and have the opportunity to ask questions before the final tools and guidance go into effect in summer 2024. Any substantive feedback on the draft materials that is shared before May 1, 2024, will be considered in the development of the final documents. The goal is to avoid confusion and disruption for federal, state and Tribal partners, project proponents, landowners and other interested parties with projects that occur in suitable habitat within the NLEB and TCB ranges.\n\nDraft New Tools and Guidance Documents"
