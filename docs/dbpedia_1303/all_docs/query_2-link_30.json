        "text": "Mariella “Mary” Neal passed peacefully in her home surrounded by family on April 12, 2022. She was 93.\n\nMary was born in Oakland, California to Earl Green and Florence Scriven Green. She resided in Fresno, California for most of her life, lived in San Luis Obispo for 4 ½ years and in Grants Pass, Oregon for the last 9 years.\n\nMary graduated from Fresno High School and Fresno City College. She was a Registered Nurse for over 30 years and became specialized as an Oncology Nurse.\n\nMary loved ballroom dancing and was an instructor at Arthur Murray’s. She volunteered for an organization benefiting children with disabilities. She also enjoyed gardening, camping, and the beach. Her biggest joy came from being surrounded by her family. She planned wonderful family gatherings and many precious memories were made during holidays and vacations. Her giving spirit and her love for family and friends will resonate for many generations.\n\nMary is survived by her three daughters Catherine Cormier, Marti Walton (husband Jake), Kristen Hathaway (husband Jim); five grandchildren Kathryn Swick (Mark), Kyle Hancock (Natalie), Allison Stebe (Scott), Chelsea Bein (Alex), McKenzie Hathaway; and great-grandson Rio Swick.\n\nA funeral service will be held at 10:00 a.m., Saturday May 21, 2022 at Saint Anne Catholic Church in Grants Pass, Oregon.\n\nFor those wishing, flowers are welcome at the church."
