        "text": "In November 2022, President Joe Biden's eldest granddaughter Naomi Biden married Peter Neal at the White House.\n\n\"Peter and I are endlessly grateful to my Nana and Pop for the opportunity to celebrate our wedding at the White House,” Naomi tweeted ahead of the wedding. “We can’t wait to make our commitment to one another official and for what lies ahead.”\n\nNaomi Biden and fiancé Peter Neal, April 2022.\n\nPeter and Naomi's nuptials were the first major White House wedding event since President George W. Bush threw his daughter Jenna a reception in June 2008, a month after her actual marriage ceremony to Henry Hager took place in Texas. The two were just the 19th couple to wed at the White House in history.\n\nIn November 2022, New York Times White House correspondent Katie Rogers tweeted that not only were Peter and Naomi set to marry at the White House, in fact, the two have been living at the White House with President Biden and First Lady Jill Biden. They live in a suite on the third floor.\n\nHere, everything you need to know about Naomi's husband Peter, one of the current residents of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.\n\nPeter Neal and Naomi Biden attend the Ralph Lauren Fall 2022 Fashion Show, March 2022.\n\nPeter was raised in Jackson Hole, Wyoming.\n\nHe was born on April 17, 1997 in Los Angeles, California, but his family relocated to Jackson Hole, Wyoming when he was young. He attended Jackson Hole Community School, before going to Burke Mountain Academy, a preeminent prep school for ski racers.\n\nNeal has three siblings, Eliot Neal, Betsy Neal, and his brother, Willie Neal, who tragically died at age 19 in a roller skiing accident. His family later established The Willie Neal Environmental Awareness Fund in his honor.\n\n\"Willie brought great joy, inspiration, and passion to this world and showed all of us how to be better people,\" Mary Neal, his mother, said after his death. \"In this next chapter, we hope our pain will subside to the point that our memories of Willie will bring only joy and will continue to motivate us to make a difference in this world each and every day.\"\n\nHis mom is also the author two books, and , both about a near-death kayak accident. Mary also shared her story in Netflix's Surviving Death docuseries.\n\nHe interned for Barack Obama's White House and Hilary Clinton's presidential campaign.\n\nNeal was an intern at the White House from May 2015 through September 2015, and worked on Hillary for America as a finance intern from May 2016 through November 2016.\n\n\"What a wild, wild journey this has been,\" he wrote in November 2016 of working for the Hilary Clinton campaign. \"This team has been kicking ass and taking names(&money) like none other in history, and to have played a small role in that has been a serious honor. I've spent just about every waking minute with these people for the last 6 months, and to see that work come to an end today is surreal. There were days I thought I wouldn't survive and days I didn't want to end, and I'm grateful for all of them. I've learned so much from these people and no matter what happens tonight, all of those lessons will endure.\"\n\nAfter Clinton lost the election, Neal again took to Instagram—this time, he shared a picture of a \"Never never never give up\" sign on Hillary's desk. He wrote, \"Nothing comes easy, and no one understands that better than Hillary Clinton. I noticed this sitting on her desk today, and the message could not be more apt, or more fitting for the woman whose desk it sits on. She has set the bar for what it means to be a public servant, and it's time for all of us to take notes, buckle down, and follow suit. That this is what she is reminding herself of daily should give us all hope and inspiration.\"\n\nHe graduated from George Washington University in 2018.\n\nAt GWU, he majored in political communications with a minor in journalism and mass communication. He graduated magna cum laude. After, he attended University of Pennsylvania Carey Law School, where he graduated from in 2022.\n\nPeter and Naomi met in June 2018.\n\nAccording to a recent anniversary post Peter shared, their first date was June 8, 2018. They were set up on a date by a mutual friend, according to . Naomi first makes an appearance on Peter's Instagram a month later (the post has since been archived or deleted). In a birthday post for Naomi from 2019, Peter wrote, \"Happy birthday to my partner in everything @naomibiden who is the most brilliant and beautiful best friend. She is more kind, loving, and thoughtful than the world deserves and we are all, and me in particular, lucky to get another trip around the sun with her.\"\n\nDuring Joe Biden's presidential campaign, Peter was by Naomi's side. He started to participate in more public events following Biden's election.\n\n(L-R) Dr. Jill Biden, Peter Neal, Finnegan Biden, Joe Biden and Ashley Biden help fill food donation boxes in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, January 2021.\n\nHe also attended the Inauguration with Naomi.\n\nPeter proposed to Naomi in Jackson Hole in September 2021.\n\nNaomi shared a selfie on Instagram showing off her engagement ring, simply writing, \"Forever.\"\n\nPeter also shared the sweet snap, without a caption. The engagement ring uses the band of Peter's grandmother's engagement ring.\n\nSince their engagement, he's made more public appearances at Naomi's side.\n\nNaomi and Peter ride bikes in Nantucket during Thanksgiving 2021.\n\nHe spent Thanksgiving 2021 with the Bidens in Nantucket; he's in this family photograph (back row, second from right) with the rest of Biden's grandchildren:\n\nIn recent months, he's appeared by her side at various White House events, including at a state dinner in October 2023 and one in April 2024.\n\nNaomi Biden and Peter Neal arrive for a state dinner at the White House on October 25, 2023.\n\nBiden and Neal at a State Dinner in April 2024.\n\nPeter and Naomi have a dog named Charlie.\n\nPresident Joe Biden, First Lady Jill Biden, Naomi Biden and Peter Neal walk to the White House from Marine One, returning from a long weekend in Rohoboth, Delaware, June 20, 2022.\n\nCharlie is a constant presence on both Peter and Naomi's Instagram feeds.\n\nHe is in the U.S. Army Judge Advocate General's Corps (JAG).\n\nThe JAG Crops \"is a government law organization and one of the country's largest law firms.\" Before, he was a legal intern at the Office of General Counsel of the U.S. House of Representatives and a legal intern at the U.S. Department of Justice.\n\nThey had a White House wedding on November 19, 2022.\n\nNaomi and Peter tied the knot on a chilly November day on the White House's South Lawn. His three-piece navy suit was designed by Ralph Lauren, and his diamond brooch was from Tiffany's. His brother, Robert, was a best man, and his sister, Besty, was one of Naomi's bridesmaids.\n\nBefore the wedding, Naomi tweeted, \"Peter and I are endlessly grateful to my Nana and Pop for the opportunity to celebrate our wedding at the White House.\"\n\n\"It has been a joy to watch Naomi grow, discover who she is, and carve out such an incredible life for herself,\" President Biden and First Lady Jill Biden said in a statement on the day of their wedding. \"Now, we are filled with pride to see her choose Peter as her husband and we’re honored to welcome him to our family. We wish them days full of laughter and a love that grows deeper with every passing year.\""
