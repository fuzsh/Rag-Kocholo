        "text": "From August 13-15, Rev Sisters will present the Black Hills Motorcycle Film Festival, featuring independent filmmakers. And yes, you read it right, the Weekend Festival Pass is free from these generous organizers. If you’re reading this too late, don’t worry; you can still access all the films for $10 here—a small price to pay for nearly 30 films. The festival is online, and those purchasing extended viewing tickets can watch the films over and over until August 29.\n\nI had the pleasure of being one of the judges for submissions, and I can say there will be some fantastic films coming your way this weekend, with gorgeous cinematography and creative ingenuity. You’ll laugh, you’ll cry (at least, I did).\n\nFilm categories include Ultra Short, Novice Short, Most Inspirational, and Judges Choice, to name a few. The films focus on moto life in general: adventures, bikes, moto culture, and more.\n\nHere is a brief press release from Michelle Lamphere, co-founder of Rev Sisters and event organizer.\n\nThe Black Hills Motorcycle Film Festival will be held online August 13-29, 2021. As a way of connecting and supporting the motorcycle community, Rev Sisters is offering free viewing for this online film festival August 13-15. If attendees need more time to watch the 15+ hours of films, they can purchase an extended viewing pass for $10 and watch videos at their own pace from the comfort of their own homes. The curated collection of films includes films showcasing a variety of riding styles from around the world—flat track racing, round-the-world adventure travel, bike building, and more. Each film is unique and creative and will leave viewers yearning to get out on the road. Winners for each of the annual categories—ultra short, short, and feature— will be announced during the festival. This year, Rev Sisters will also be highlighting novice filmmakers. Information and links to acquire free weekend and extended viewing tickets for the Black Hills Motorcycle Film Festival can be found at https://revsisters.com/bhmff2021/.\n\nAbout Rev Sisters\n\nLiza, Michelle, and Shana became friends in the midst of planning a global event,Woman Riders World Relay. They discovered that they were able to balance one another’s talents to create amazing things and together became a powerhouse team. Eighteen months of long nights and intense on-the-go planning solidified that Liza, Michelle, and Shana wanted to continue even after the relay was completed. And so Rev Sisters was born.\n\nTickets for Black Hills Moto Film Festivals\n\nOur No Compromise Clause: We carefully screen all contributors to make sure they are independent and impartial.
