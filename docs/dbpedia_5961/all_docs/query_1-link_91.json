        "text": "The Most Magical Natural Wonder in All of America – Behold the Black Hills.\n\nOf all the magical natural places I’ve traveled to in America (and beyond), the Black Hills National Forest tops the list.\n\nMaybe it’s just the dazzling rock formations, beautiful pine forests, incredible wildlife, mesmerizing magic hour, and insane amount of recreation opportunities that exist here. Or maybe it’s more than just that…\n\nThere’s something almost spiritual about this place (just ask the native tribes who’ve lived here for nearly 10,000 years).\n\nSure the air is crisp, the forests are vibrant, and the land is serene, but there’s something intangible about the Black Hills that you just have to experience for yourself.\n\nYou can feel the magic of this place. So, to properly capture the essence of the Black Hills, we partnered with South Dakota to create a breathtaking film on the forest.\n\nThe results are, well, magical.\n\nAbout Our Travels to the Black Hills National Forest\n\nMy first trip to the Black Hills was nearly a decade ago during a road trip with my brother Jim (pictured above) and some friends across America. We stopped into the region, like many folks do, for the sole purpose of seeing Mount Rushmore.\n\nRELATED: 15 HELPFUL Tips for Visiting Mount Rushmore (Things to Do + Photos)\n\nRushmore was interesting but the real star of the show was the Black Hills National Forest. We were hooked. Since that trip we’ve returned many times, culminating (finally) in a to document the forest in partnership with the state and the US Forest Service.\n\nWe decided to feature the Black Hills during the fall season largely due to the breathtaking foliage displays that happen during this time of year.\n\nBlack Hills National Forest Guide\n\nAbout the Black Hills National Forest\n\nSituated in western South Dakota, the Black Hills National Forest comprises 1.2 million acres of unparalleled beauty. Rising far above the surrounding prairie, the Black Hills even contains the tallest peak east of the Rocky Mountains.\n\nBoasting over 13,000 acres of wilderness, 1,300 miles of streams, 450 miles of hiking trails, and 2 national scenic byways, it’s no wonder why so many consider the Black Hills a recreation paradise.\n\nRecreational Opportunities\n\nHorseback Riding\n\nMountain Biking\n\nClimbing\n\nFishing\n\nHunting\n\nOHV Driving (ATVs, Dirt bikes, etc)\n\nHiking\n\nCamping\n\nBoating (kayaking, canoeing, motors, etc)\n\nand so much more\n\nThings to Know Before You Visit the Black Hills\n\nBest Map\n\nMap: We use this one.\n\nBest Guide\n\nGuide: We love this one.\n\nDownloadable Visitor Guide (courtesy USFS)\n\nEntrance Fees\n\nEntrance Fees: There are no entrance fees to get into the Black Hills National Forest. This is pretty typical for national forests. Some areas are designated fee areas but by and large no fees are required here.\n\nIf you’d like to be on the safe side you can purchase the America the Beautiful Pass (which can be found at the entrance gates to most national parks or online here). This pass gets you into all National Parks, Forests, Monuments, and more including 2,000 sites for free after a one time $79 fee (annual pass).\n\nLather up!\n\nSunscreen: For many of us visiting national forests in the summer means lots of sun. Seriously, some of these parks can zap you if you don’t wear sunscreen. We happen to like this one because it works AND it’s not full of a bunch of chemicals.\n\nLeave No Trace\n\nWe’re big fans of Leave No Trace, here at MTJP. Want to learn more? Read about the seven principals of Leave No Trace here.\n\nMosquitoes\n\nInsect Repellent: You hope not to need it, but you want to have it. We typically bring an Eco-Friendly Insect Repellent with us just in case.\n\nDogs\n\nDogs are allowed on national forests including the Black Hills.\n\nDetails About the Black Hills National Forest\n\nLocation: Western South Dakota & Eastern Wyoming\n\nClosest City: Spearfish, Rapid City (among others)\n\nEstablished: February 22, 1897\n\nSize: 1,253,308 acres\n\nNative Land: Arapaho, Cheyenne, Kiowa, Kiowa-Apache, Lakota, Omaha,\n\nEntrance Fees: Free\n\nBlack Hills National Forest Maps (4)\n\nBear Lodge Ranger District Map\n\nNorthern Hills Ranger District Map\n\nMystic Ranger District Map\n\nHell Canyon Ranger District Map\n\nWhere is the Black Hills National Forest?\n\nThe Black Hills National Forest is located in Western South Dakota over 4 different ranger districts featuring different topography.\n\nRanger Districts\n\nBear Lodge Ranger District\n\nNorthern Hills Ranger District\n\nHell Canyon Ranger Districts\n\nMystic Ranger District\n\nGetting to the Black Hills – Directions & Location\n\nThe Black Hills National Forest is massive at over a million acres. Getting to the forest depends on which part you’re trying to access.\n\nClosest Airport (Rapid City): RAP – Rapid City Regional Airport (distance – 20 miles from the Mystic Ranger District)\n\nThe best way to get to the Black Hills is typically flying into Rapid City (RAP) and driving to the forest.\n\nDepending on which part of the forest you are trying to visit will determine the drive time but typically somewhere from 30 minutes to the Mystic & Northern Hills Ranger Districts and about to 90 minutes to the Bear Lodge Ranger District.\n\nRELATED: 20 (INCREDIBLE) Things to Do in Badlands National Park 2021\n\nWatch the Award-Winning Black Hills Video\n\nAbout the Black Hills Video\n\nThis film was created by the team at More Than Just Parks in partnership with Travel South Dakota in an effort to adequately capture the essence of the Black Hills National Forest.\n\nIn the making of this film we hiked nearly every trail, traversed most of the roads, rode horses, drove ATVs, went fishing, filmed hunting, boated, camped, biked, and so much more.\n\nThe film features the fall season because we feel like that’s the most impressive season in the forest.\n\nRELATED: 14 BREATHTAKING National Park Videos to Inspire Your Next Trip\n\nSeasons & Weather in the Black Hills\n\nThe weather on the Black Hills National Forest is pretty variable with four very distinct (and wonderful) seasons.\n\nSpring is rainy but vibrant, summer is hot and dry with the occasional awe-inspiring thunderstorm, Autumn is cool and colorful, and Winter is cold and snowy.\n\nBest Time to Visit the Black Hills\n\nThe best time to visit the Black Hills National Forest is during Fall when the park is cool but not cold, crowd sizes are down, and the foliage is shocking.\n\nI recommend visiting between late September and mid-October for the best chance at seeing peak fall foliage.\n\nBlack Hills Seasons\n\nSpring on the Black Hills National Forest\n\nSpring is a pleasant and vibrant time to visit the Black Hills with all the deciduous trees slowly coming back to life.\n\nAs a rule of thumb, the later into Spring the better the weather will be which means more accessible forest recreational opportunities.\n\nSummer on the Black Hills National Forest\n\nSummer is a great season to visit the Black Hills. Temperatures are warm but usually not too hot given the elevation. The full arsenal of recreational activities are available during Summer which makes it a great time to visit.\n\nSummer is the most popular time to visit the forest so crowds will be up but still nowhere close to what you will see in the national parks.\n\nFall on the Black Hills National Forest\n\nFall is the best time of year to visit the Black Hills National Forest. The foliage here is unexpectedly (at least to me) striking. The Spearfish Canyon region has especially beautiful color.\n\nTemperatures are down and so are crowds as kids return to school and vacation season winds down.\n\nRELATED: 10+ Must See National Parks This Fall (A Stunning Guide)\n\nWinter on the Black Hills National Forest\n\nWinter is cold and snowy on the Black Hills National Forest. If you love winter sports then you can find plenty of great winter recreation opportunities all over the forest.\n\nBest Things to Do On The Black Hills National Forest\n\n1. Saddle Up & Go Horseback Riding\n\nOne of the most popular and iconic activities in the Black Hills is horseback riding. Nothing feels quite so right for the setting or the western landscapes as soaking in the beauty via horseback.\n\nOur favorite horseback riding vendor is Elk Haven which you’ll see featured here and in our Black Hills film.\n\n2. Hike To the Highest Point In South Dakota, Black Elk Peak\n\nBlack Elk Peak (formerly Harney Peak) is the highest point in all of South Dakota at 7,244 feet elevation. Hiking to the top is a wonderful way to see the best views in the Black Hills.\n\nDistance: 7.1 miles\n\nElevation Gain: 1,469 feet\n\nTime Required: 4-5 hours\n\nBe sure to pack plenty of water and snacks for the trail. The trail starts off in coniferous forests crossing a small creek before ascending above the tree line up a series of rocky stairs. The lookout tower is usually open and is a site to behold.\n\nNOTE: This trail is primarily on the Black Elk Wilderness which is the highest level of protection on federal lands. Tread lightly and practice Leave No Trace.\n\n3. Try Your Hand at Some World Class Fly Fishing\n\nThe Black Hills National Forest is home to some of the best small stream fly fishing on the planet with over 500 miles of streams. Rainbow, brook, brown, and tiger trout are mostly the types of fish you’ll find in these streams.\n\nThe setting amongst the epic canyons of the Black Hills makes for a magazine-esque experience.\n\nA few of the best places to fly-fish are:\n\nSpearfish Creek\n\nCastle Creek\n\nRapid Creek\n\nBox Elder Creek\n\nSand Creek\n\nFor more fishing information visit Dakota Angler.\n\n4. Soak in the Views (& History) at Mount Roosevelt Friendship Tower\n\nFor the history buffs and fans of the hit HBO show, Deadwood, the Mount Roosevelt Friendship Tower will have special meaning for you. This tower was built by the famous Deadwood Sheriff, Seth Bullock, as a tribute to his good friend Theodore Roosevelt.\n\nThe tower was built in 1919 and is still standing strong today, albeit with a few structural improvements over the years.\n\n5. Check Out The Gold Mountain Gold Mine\n\nThe Gold Mountain Mine gives visitors a glance into what life might have been like as a Black Hills prospector. This site is significant as it is the only remaining gold mining site in the Black Hills.\n\nVisitors can drive right up to the mine which has a few interpretive signs describing its history in greater detail. Please do not attempt to climb the structure.\n\n6. See the Stunning Spearfish Falls\n\nSpearfish Falls is an 80 foot waterfall located on the Spearfish Creek that is often overlooked by folks as signage is lacking and the falls are not visible from the main road.\n\nTo get to the falls, visitors should park at the Latchstring Restaurant and look at the end of the parking lot for the trailhead. The trail is only about .8 miles long round trip and descends gently into the canyon leading to the falls.\n\n7. Drive the Incredibly Scenic Highway 16 Through the Black Hills\n\nHighway 16 is an incredibly scenic drive that winds through the heart of the Black Hills National Forest. From the road you can see epic overlooks of the granite spires that rise out of the coniferous forests.\n\nSeveral tunnels perfectly frame Mount Rushmore in the distance (by design). This is a lovely area to escape the Rushmore crowds and soak in the full beauty of the forest.\n\nWhere to Stay in the Black Hills – Camping & Lodging\n\nCamping & Campgrounds\n\nThe Black Hills National Forest is home to 30 developed campgrounds with 682 individual campsites. The forest also has one rent-able cabin.\n\nCentral Hills / Rapid City\n\nBlack Fox Campground\n\nCastle Peak Campground\n\nDeerfield Reservoir Complex\n\nCuster Trails Campground\n\nDutchman Lake Campground\n\nWhitetail Campground\n\nDitch Creek Campground\n\nPactola Reservoir Complex\n\nPactola Campground\n\nSheridan Lake Complex\n\nSheridan Lake South Shore Campground\n\nNorthern Hills / Spearfish\n\nBoxelder Forks Campground\n\nDalton Lake Campground\n\nHanna Campground\n\nRod & Gun Campground\n\nRoubaix Lake Campground\n\nSteamboat Rock Picnic & Tent Camping Area\n\nStrawberry Picnic & Tent Camping Area\n\nTimon Campground\n\nNorthwestern Hills / Sundance\n\nBearlodge Campground\n\nCook Lake Recreation Area\n\nReuter Campground\n\nSundance Horse Camp\n\nSouthern Hills / Custer\n\nBeaver Creek Campground\n\nBismarck Lake Campground\n\nComanche Park Campground\n\nGrizzly Bear Campground\n\nHorsethief Lake Campground\n\nIron Creek Horse Camp\n\nOreville Campground\n\nRed Bank Springs Campground\n\nWillow Creek Horse Camp\n\nFor more about camping on the Black Hills visit the USFS camping page.\n\nLodging\n\nUnlike many National Forests, there are no lodges located on the Black Hills National Forest. There is one rent-able cabin however – for more info on it visit the USFS cabin page.\n\nIf you’re looking for a hotel, there are a plethora to choose from within a stones throw from the forest. Rapid City, Deadwood, Keystone, and Spearfish are all great towns with lots of hotel beds.\n\nHere’s our favorite hotels in the Black Hills.\n\nDriving in the Black Hills\n\nSome forests are designed for 4WD vehicles due to the sheer amount of roads they have to maintain and their relative remoteness. The Black Hills is more of an AWD or even 2WD national forest.\n\nDon’t get me wrong, if you have a 4WD vehicle there are *some* spots where it will come in handy. But, by in large the roads are great in the Black Hills.\n\nBlack Hills National Forest Photos\n\nPhotos of the Black Hills National Forest\n\nNearby Attractions\n\nWind Cave National Park\n\nBadlands National Park\n\nCuster State Park\n\nJewel Cave National Monument\n\nBuffalo Gap National Grassland\n\nMount Rushmore\n\nThat’s a wrap folks!

We’ve spent our entire adult lives exploring and filming America’s national parks and public lands.\n\nWe’ve worked with the National Park Service, the Department of Interior, and the U.S. Forest Service for years creating films on important places and issues.\n\nOur work has been featured in leading publications all over the world and even some people outside of our immediate family call us national parks experts.\n\nWe’re Jim Pattiz and Will Pattiz, collectively known as the Pattiz Brothers.\n\nOur goal here at More Than Just Parks is to share the beauty of America’s national parks and public lands through stunning short films in an effort to get Americans and the world to see the true value in land conservation.\n\nIf you’d like to follow along our journey we’d be delighted to have you!\n\nFirst Name\n\nEmail address:\n\nLeave this field empty if you're human:\n\nAnd a bonus! Tips for Visiting a National Forest\n\nPermit Systems and Reservations\n\nCheck to see if the national forest you’re visiting has a permit or reservation system in place before visiting. As public lands become increasingly crowded more has to be done to safeguard them which means controlling the hundreds of millions of people who visit these places each year.\n\nPopular national parks & forests with reservation systems of some kind include Yosemite, Yellowstone, Zion, Rocky Mountain, Glacier, Arches, Acadia, Denali, and more.\n\nWant Less Crowds? Try another National Forest!\n\nTry visiting a national forest while you’re on your trip to avoid the crowds. There are 155 national forests in America, many of which are equally as beautiful as the national parks they neighbor and only see a fraction of the visitors.\n\nFor example, try the Flathead National Forest next to Glacier National Park, the Bridger-Teton next to Grand Teton, and the Dixie which borders nearly all of the Utah National Parks.\n\nPractice Safety, Seriously\n\nNational forests and parks are amazing but wild places so it is essential to practice basic safety while visiting them. Every year people die while vacationing in national parks. This is easily avoided by:\n\nSticking to trails\n\nChecking the weather before going out on a hike\n\nMaintaining a safe distance between wildlife which means at least 25 yards from most wildlife and 100 yards from predators\n\nAvoid ledges with steep drop offs\n\nblack hills national forest, black hills forest, black hills national park, black hills national forest hiking, usfs black hills, black hills nf, black hills national forest, black hills forest, black hills national park, black hills national forest hiking, usfs black hills, black hills nf,"
