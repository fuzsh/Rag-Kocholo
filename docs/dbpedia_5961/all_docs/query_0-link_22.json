        "text": "ISBN: 0224019805\n\nLondon, England: Jonathan Cape, 1982. First UK Edition. Hardcover. \"For eighty years Lewis and Benjamin Jones shared one life- ate the same food, wore the same clothes, slept in the same bed and swung an axe in the same trajectory. As boys they spoke in their own special language; by old age they had no need for words. One window of their farm, The Vision, looked out over the green fields of England: another, back into Wales, past a clump of larches, at the Black Hill. Behind the windows not a teacup nor a memory was moved out of place.\" (from front flap) The acclaimed third work published during the lifetime of Bruce Chatwin (1940-1989), the popular & award-winning British travel writer & novelist who died tragically of AIDS at the age of only 48. This haunting, probing novel about twin brother farmers at the border between England & Wales, & their relationships with their mother as well as each other, was the basis for a film version directed by Andrew Grieve (1987). Hardcover in unclipped dust jacket, first UK edition published in the year preceding the first American edition. We believe this is a first printing, & that the dust jacket is first-issue, although there is a sticker affixed with \"Publishers Price/ Net UK Only/ (PS)10.95\" near lower right corner of front flap. We have seen reference to an original price of 7.50 Pounds, & presume that this sticker covers that first price. In any case, this is an essential, classic Chatwin collectible almost certainly in its rarest original form & in exceptionally superb condition: Book very fine with only a touch of wear & slight fading to thin edges & corners of front, back covers & spine; very light browning & a few short, faint scratches to upper edge of text block. Interior very fine, substantially mint. Dust jacket very fine with only very slight rubbing to front, back covers & spine; a few tiny bumps, creases at thin edges & corners of same & flaps. Very Fine / Very Fine. [Item #4663]"
