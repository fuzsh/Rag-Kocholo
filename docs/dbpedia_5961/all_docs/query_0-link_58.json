        "text": "On the Black Hill begins in the closing years of the 19th century with the marriage of dour, puritanical Welsh farmer Amos Jones to his social superior, vicar’s daughter Mary Latimer after the death of her father. Her inheritance and social connections enable them to rent a vacant farm, ‘The Vision’, a situation that is a cause for resentment in their relationship. It is against this background, along with a boundary feud with Watkins, a malicious neighbour, that the twins Lewis and Benjamin grow up. Having come through wars, romance and separation, they are still farming at ‘The Vision’ eighty years later.\n\nDirector: Andrew Grieve\n\nFilming Location: Llanfihangel Nant Brân, The Black Mountains, Hay-on-Wye and Crickhowell\n\nCast: Mike Gwilym, Robert Gwilym, Aled Baker, Rhys Baker, Iona Banks\n\nWriter: Bruce Chatwin\n\nCast: Bob Peck, Gemma Jones, Nicola Beddoe, Patrick Godfrey\n\nProduction Company: British Film Institute (BFI), British Screen Productions, Channel Four Films\n\nLength: 117 min\n\nFormat: Check with distributor\n\nLanguage: English"
