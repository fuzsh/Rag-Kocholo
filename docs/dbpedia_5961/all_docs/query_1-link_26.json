The epic sweep of the film takes in two world wars, exploring themes of nationalism, class, community, faith and pacifism. Though unrelenting in its portrayal of the raw experiences of rural life, On the Black Hill celebrates the people of the Black Mountains and its landscape, made transcendent by the magnificent cinematography of Thaddeus O'Sullivan.\n\nSet in the stunningly dramatic Welsh Borders, Andrew Grieve's (Hornblower, Letter from the East) evocative adaption of Bruce Chatwin's novel is presented with a fascinating selection of new and archival extras.\n\nExtras"
