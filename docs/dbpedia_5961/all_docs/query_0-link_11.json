This 1987 BFI/Film 4 movie from director Andrew Grieve is an adaptation of one such novel, 1982's On the Black Hill by Bruce Chatwin.\n\nThe book tells the story of 80 years in the lives of Welsh farmers and identical twins, Lewis and Benjamin Jones. The narrative explores their near psychic bond and simplistic life as well as the courtship, marriage and subsequent life of their parents, the refined and educated Englishwoman Mary and their proud and mercurial Bible thumping father Amos. That it effectively tells the story of the twentieth century from the point of view of its protagonists in just 250 pagesâ€¦"
