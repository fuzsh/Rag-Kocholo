        "text": "From the UK. The first thing we see is a passage from revelations. Followed by a family in church. So much religion! Stars mike and robert gwilym, as welsh twins lewis and benjamin, and their lives. The first hour is just growing up as kids, with an unpredictable father. Kind of a wasted hour... didn't really need to spend that much time on how their parents met. When one brother is sent off to war, they both suffer, in separation, and their gentle, non-violent beliefs. We see many samples of their pain and suffering. After the war, they get rich and successul, but as one of them points out, they have no heir to whom they can leave it. Gotta be honest... not a lot happens in this one hour fifty one minute film. I was hoping for more drama, but if you were wondering what life was like in wales, from 1900 to 1950, this is your film. I guess it shows the friendship between brothers. Directed by andrew grieve. Mike gwilym only made one more film after this, but robert was still acting as recently as 2019."
