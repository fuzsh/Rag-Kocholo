Based on the novel published in 1982 by Bruce Chatwin, On the Black Hill is about identical twin brothers who grow up on a farm in rural Wales and never leave home. They till the rough soil and sleep in the same bed, touched only occasionally by the advances of the 20th century. By depicting the lives of Benjamin and Lewis, and their interactions with their small local community, Chatwin comments movingly on the larger questions of human experience.

On the Black Hill is a novel that portrays themes of unrequited love, sexual repression and confusion, social, religious and cultural repression, hate, and the historic social values of rural Britain.

Narrated by Callum Scott Howells and directed by Luke J Collins, the film combines a performance reading with flashback imagery.
