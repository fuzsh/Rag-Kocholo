NOT SO DUSTY is written and directed by the hard-working Maclean Rogers, who seemed to single-handedly prop up British B-movie cinema back in the 1950s. It's a remake of a '30s comedy about the escapades of a couple of unlucky bin men who come into possession of a rare book and subsequently are involved in plotting by various characters each attempting to win it for themselves.

Needless to say that the laughs are broad and dated in this film, with lots of humour that would be considered tired and predictable by modern viewers. Saying that, the naturalness of the jokes feels effortless in places and the good cast do very well at bringing their caricatures to life. Bill Owen in particular seems to be channelling the spirit of Compo in an early turn while Leslie Dwyer is ever impressive. The supporting cast includes plenty of familiar faces such as Dandy Nichols, Wally Patch and Roddy Hughes from the TOFF films, and child actor William Simons, later to become a mainstay of British TV for his role in HEARTBEAT.
