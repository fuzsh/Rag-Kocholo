        "text": "\"Mars ain't the kind of place to raise a kid/In fact it's cold as hell.\" According to SF frontier drama Settlers, Elton John couldn't be more wrong, except when he added \"And there's no one there to raise them/If you did.\" Remmy (Prince) has her parents, Ilsa (Boutella) and Reza (Miller), looking after her on their arid settlement on a terraformed future version of the fourth planet from Sol. But the inevitable attack by a trio of roaming ravagers throws their domestic contentment into chaos.\n\nSettlers continues the old idea of space as the Old West, a place for rugged colonists to forge their own future with the occasional intrusion by equally individualistic bandits. But head ravager Jerry (Cordova), a veteran of \"a war for less and less,\" throws that dusty idyll into chaos because of what he represents: not undomesticated chaos, but a more mournful take on the trope than has been traditional. While the recent Prospect found room for hope in a cosmos without conscience, writer/director Wyatt Rockefeller turns what seems to be a conventional continuation of space colony fiction along a more dystopian path. Everything is about the next logical step, while subverting expectations: after all, if the whole point of colonizing other planets is to get away from Earth, why do these stories end up so Terra-bound? Instead, Settlers ponders humanity's dichotomous flair for self-destruction and self-preservation - after all, if we messed up one planet, why would we be presumed to be be much better at tending to a new home just because it's a hundred million miles away (give or take). Even the ownership of the farmstead is not as clear cut as it first seems, triggering a queasy wandering of allegiances."
