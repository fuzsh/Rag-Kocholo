        "text": "Hello film fans! Slick Dungeon here back to review yet another Oscar nominated film. This time we’re talking about the film written and directed by Cord Jefferson, starring Jeffrey Wright and Sterling K. Brown, American Fiction. It’s up for five Oscars this year. There will be spoilers for the film so if you don’t like that sort of thing, find your nearest theater, go watch the film, and come on back here to read the review.\n\nWhat’s it About?\n\nDr. Thelonious “Monk” Ellison (Jeffrey Wright) is an author and college professor. He has written several books which are well respected but not overly popular. In class one day, Monk gets in trouble because he tries to have a frank conversation about literature but teaches about a title in class that has an offensive word in it. A student feels she is uncomfortable with the word and this leads to a complaint that causes the college to put Monk on a leave of absence.\n\nMeanwhile, Monk can’t get his next book published because his agent says publishers think it is not, “black” enough. Monk points out that he is black and he wrote the book so by definition it is a black book. This doesn’t help him sell it to anyone though.\n\nWhile visiting his family, Monk has to confront his mother’s increasing Alzheimers and reunites with his sister who he has not seen in a long time. Unfortunately for the family, his sister Lisa (Tracee Ellis Ross) suffers a heart attack and dies while he is there. Monk’s brother Cliff (Sterling K. Brown) comes to pay his respects but is not willing to pay for his mother’s care. Cliff is also gay and has recently come out and as a result his wife divorced him and took his children with her.\n\nAs things become more desperate for Monk financially, he decides to write a book that panders to black stereotypes and sends it to his agent as a joke. To Monk’s chagrin, this book is picked up swiftly and enthusiastically by publishers unlike his other books. The amount of money he earns from selling it is enough to help get the care his mother needs, but Monk has to pretend to be someone he is not in order to keep the publishers happy.\n\nThe remainder of the movie has Monk dealing with crisis after crisis as he has to navigate a dual identity to his publishers and the media, all while still firmly believing the other types of books he writes have more value. He struggles with his girlfriend, he ends up having to judge his own work in a literary award contest, and his mother continues to get worse.\n\nThe film touches on ideas of duality, themes of loss, grief, joy, race and academia. It doesn’t hold back on any of these issues and asks complex questions without giving the audience an easy answer. After watching the film, many of the questions the viewers have will remain and you’ll find yourself thinking about this film long afterwards, including wondering if there are times this film actually falls into some of the categories it criticizes. It’s a multilayered portrayal of complex issues and is quite well made. It is one of the more entertaining of the Oscar picks this year and there is good reason it was up for so many awards.\n\nThe Awards\n\nSpeaking of awards, let’s take a look at each category this one is up for.\n\nBest Actor\n\nThere are several great actors up for this award. Colman Domingo had a great turn as Bayard Rustin in Rustin, Bradley Cooper is up for Maestro, Paul Giamati who is no stranger to the Oscars is up for The Holdovers, and Cillian Murphy is up for Oppenheimer. Jeffrey Wright has a phenomenal and nuanced performance here playing a character that never quite opens himself up entirely to the world, all the while complaining that things are not the way they should be. As good a performance as this is, Cillian Murphy is almost certain to win in this category.\n\nBest Supporting Actor\n\nThis category is also filled with big name actors and for me, it’s a tougher call than Best Actor. Sterling K. Brown is up for American Fiction. He has a memorable role as Cliff who is struggling with how the world perceives him but all in all he doesn’t have a huge amount of screen time here. There are several actors who could end up with the award here besides Brown. Robert De Niro is up for yet another Oscar for Killers of the Flower Moon, Ryan Gosling has lots of buzz for his role as Ken in Barbie, Robert Downey Jr. is up for Oppenheimer, and Mark Ruffalo is up for Poor Things. I think De Niro has a really strong shot but Gosling may just sneak his way into a win here.\n\nMusic (Orignal Score)\n\nThe score is fine in this film but I simply don’t see it winning. There are too many other films with more notable music in them. I think Killers of the Flower Moon has a much better shot here. The other movies in question here are Oppenheimer, Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, and Poor Things.\n\nBest Picture\n\nAmerican Fiction is an excellent film and despite being one of the Oscar nominees, I suspect not enough people have watched it who should. It’s rather entertaining and has some really good humor that makes you uncomfortable in the best way. But, this will not win Best Picture. That is still going to Oppenheimer in my mind. I have one more film to see in this category so unless The Zone of Interest is so incredible it has to change my mind, I don’t think any other film has a shot.\n\nWriting (Adapted Screenplay)\n\nThere are so many well written movies this year. American Fiction is able to tell a nuanced story with complex matter while confronting things head on. It’s also about writers which can often help a movie win in the writing category. American Fiction is up against Oppenheimer, Barbie, Poor Things, and The Zone of Interest. I think this one is going to go to American Fiction or The Zone of Interest but honestly any of these winning would make complete sense.\n\nIn Conclusion\n\nAmerican Fiction is a great film with great performances and confronts issues that need to be confronted. It doesn’t tend to insult the audience (except maybe for a little bit at the end) and it will remain in your mind long after you see it. It’s an excellent watch and well deserving of being one of the most nominated films of the year. It’s up against major competition that may outshine it, however.\n\nAwardingly yours,\n\nSlick Dungeon"
