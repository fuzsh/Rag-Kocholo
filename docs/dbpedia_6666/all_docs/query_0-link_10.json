        "text": "This article argues that, after decades of pointing towards the importance of including production and reception research into the study of film remakes, we should actually start addressing production and reception methodologies and investigate why this is necessary for the sustainability and future development of the field. I argue that a lot can be learned from the insights coming from the existing methodologies that are being used in, that is, format studies, (critical) media industry studies, (audiovisual) translation studies, and more recently the study of cultural transduction. The first section of the article mainly deals with the importance of investigating the different cultural mediators that take part in the production lifecycle of the film remake. It is contended that the analysis of film remakes should start examining the different individuals or institutions that mediate or intervene between the production of cultural artefacts and the generation of consumer preferences. The second part of the article points towards the importance of investigating the reception, experience, and interpretation of film remakes. It is shown that crucial questions like ‘(why) do audiences prefer the domestic remake over the foreign film?’, ‘how do audiences experience, interpret, and explain differences and similarities between source films and remakes?’, but also ‘how do audiences define and assess film remakes?’ remain yet to be asked. The article concludes that if the field of remake studies wishes to break out of its disciplinary boundaries, adopting a multi-methodological approach will help to further brush off its dusty character of textual analysis.\n\nThis book provides a dynamic investigation of processes of cultural reproduction – remaking and remodelling – in film, television and new media. Drawing on a wide variety of Hollywood and other examples, this impressive group of contributors considers a wide range of film adaptations, remakes and fan productions from various industrial, textual and critical perspectives. Their case studies discuss new versions of popular texts such as The Manchurian Candidate, Invasion of the Body Snatchers and The Stepford Wives. They provide new perspectives on the unlimited cultural production of classics like The Wizard of Oz, Wuthering Heights and The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, and they analyze the groundbreaking work of fan appropriations, including Batman and Spiderman fanvids, and fanfic trailer revisions for The Shining and television's The Adventures of Merlin.\n\nFilm remakes, akin to palimpsests, are layered texts that bear the imprint of their creation, influenced by the dynamic interplay of political, ideological, and social contexts. They represent a complex convergence of artistic vision, commercial interests, and cultural currents, serving as both reflections and reframings of the original source material. As such, they occupy a unique space within the cinematic landscape, offering insights into the evolving nature of storytelling, audience reception, and the zeitgeist of their respective eras. At their core, remakes embody a tension between tradition and innovation, fidelity to the past and the impulse to reinvent. They navigate a delicate balance between honoring the legacy of the original film and forging new paths of creative expression. This tension is particularly pronounced in the realm of cultural relevance, where remakes serve as barometers of shifting tastes, values, and technological advancements. By revisiting familiar narratives through a contemporary lens, filmmakers aim to strike a chord with audiences of the present moment, infusing classic tales with fresh perspectives and contemporaneous themes.\n\nThough current research on the film remake phenomenon acknowledges an underlying industrial process, it rarely analyses it. Therefore, building on expert interviews with people working in the remake industries of the Low Countries, this article places the production aspect of the film remake process central. The findings suggest that the manner in which these cultural mediators describe and evaluate the film remake mirrors popular discourses and seems to affect the production process of film remakes themselves. It was found that the phenomenon is generally seen as the result of a lack of originality, authenticity and is, moreover, highly commercially driven. These aspects were found to sometimes function as a license for initiating remake projects. However, next to the financial benefits, other personal and creative rationales were advanced. Additionally, the element of localization was deemed as one of the most essential tactics in the creative process. Finally, distributors appear to be crucial figures in the emergence of film remakes in small geo-linguistic film markets.\n\nThe 2000s have seen a number of remakes in the horror genre. If critics have generally argued that Hollywood aims at erasing the original movie when it is foreign, the marketing strategy of domestic remakes relies on the audience’s awareness of the existence of the original film. As the prefix “re-” suggests, producing a remake generally rests on the belief that a profit can be made by improving on the original in terms of technique and technology. This article attempts to foreground some of the contradictions immanent to the remake by arguing that what Thomas Leitch calls its “stance” is, in effect, a disavowal of the very terms contained in the prefix. The remakes of The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (Tobe Hooper, 1974)—The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (Marcus Nispel, 2003) and Texas Chainsaw 3D (Luessenhop, 2013)—are examined as paradigmatic examples of this disavowal through a study of both pragmatic and formal levels.\n\nIn Stand-In (Garnett, 1937), Atterbury Dodd/Leslie Howard, the representative of the East Coast bankers who own Colossal Pictures, is sent to correct the financial mismanagement of the studio. He enters Mrs. Mack’s boarding house inhabited by stand-ins, has-beens, stuntmen, and bit players and meets “Abe Lincoln” at the door. While waiting downstairs, Dodd overhears the actor wearing the familiar top hat, beard, and coat tails of the sixteenth president of the United States tell a fellow boarder, herself reduced from silent star to talkie extra, that he has been waiting for seven years for the remake of The Battle of Gettysburg to make his comeback. That there will be a remake, he is convinced. That he uses the term “remake” locates the practice as standard in current studio production. “Abe Lincoln’s” assurance that Hollywood will always return to themes of cultural, historical, and mythological importance to Americans links the remake to standard production formulas, from genre pi..."
