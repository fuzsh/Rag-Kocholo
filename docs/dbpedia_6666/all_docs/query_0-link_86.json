        "text": "It’s easy to think of film as immortalizing people — there they are, up on the big screen, young and beautiful forever.\n\nThe truth is, though, that enormous amounts of films end up lost and forgotten. Incredible, era-defining work ends up wiped, rotting or sitting in a dusty box in an attic, labeled wrongly and in a format nobody can play. We think that in this modern age of digital everything and damn near unlimited storage that we’ve moved beyond such issues, but if you try watching something on YouTube from before about 2010, it looks like it was filmed with a shoe, and millions of us have CD-Rs filled with precious memories and computers with no CD drives.\n\nSometimes, someone is rooting through a big box of old crap and stumbles upon an old film reel that turns out to be an incredibly important part of cinema history. The performances, ideas and dreams of these long-gone people get to be seen again, and thankfully there are movie historians and academics who can contextualize it all — otherwise however modern and exciting and provocative and futuristic anything seemed at the time can seem like just so much other jittery old shit.\n\nPoring through these archives to sort the pieces of history from the pieces of shit is a huge, neverending job — there are cupboards in basement offices in Hollywood that nobody’s touch in 75 years that might contain masterpieces, but who has the combination of time, money and expertise to look?"
