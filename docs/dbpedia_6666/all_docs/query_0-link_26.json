        "text": "About Me\n\nName: Steve Ember\n\nLocation: United States\n\nI am a writer, photographer, and voice actor. No particular order - depends on which of those activities I might be engaged in at the moment. Unabashedly romantic and unapologetically sentimental. Old enough to remember Walter Cronkite reporting the death of JFK, as well as when popular music was good...and good music was popular. I share my digs with a big, sturdy gray and white, very conversational cat named Mewer, who tolerates my proclivities toward Kaempfert, Rachmaninoff, Mahler, and movies with explosions. I love being anywhere Alpine. I enjoy trains and airplanes, and get attached to my cars. I love quality music and good movies. Need a versatile, seasoned voice-actor? Please visit SteveEmber.com. Like to see more of my photography? Easy - same place, and click on the photography link. Oh, and if something I write here strikes your fancy, do feel free to comment, or e-mail me at emberphoto(at)hotmail(dot)com"
