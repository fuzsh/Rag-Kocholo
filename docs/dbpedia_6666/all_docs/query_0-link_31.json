        "text": "I adore TCM.\n\nThanks to Ted Turner‘sgenius, thousands of tasty morsels from the wonderful world of classic cinema are merely a couple of remote clicks away. Despite the abundance of good that TCM provides to the starving film fan, there is a downside to having only a handful of movies stored in their archive. Usually, this means that the network has the tendency to replay a lot of movies.\n\nThis would irritate me, normally, but there’s always an actor (or director in this case) that’s an exception to this phenomenon.\n\nIn this case, it’s Alfred Hitchcock.\n\nA couple of months ago, I was on my way to visit some family members in the northern part of the United States.\n\nI’m an anxious flyer so, naturally, to calm my pre-flight jitters, I turned on TCM just a few hours before my flight left the following morning. Fortunately, all throughout that month, the network decided to sporadically play Hitchcock‘s voyeuristic masterpiece Rear Window in celebration of what would have been Grace Kelly‘s 88th birthday.\n\nI’ve seen Rear Window about a dozen times on several different occasions (I even own it on Blu-ray) but, for some reason, this viewing felt very unusual.\n\nInstead of enjoying the cheeky humor, incredible sets, and the brilliant screenwriting, I took an active effort at trying to understand the intricate fusion between the character of Lisa Carol Fremont and Grace Kelly – the actress.\n\nAs you may know, it has often been said that Grace Kelly had a ‘dual persona.’\n\nThis is in reference to the “ice queen” image that plagued her throughout her career. There’s no denying that Kelly was a pretty reserved person in her personal life – depending on which biography you read, but what about her movies?\n\nThis is where my re-viewing of Rear Window helped me to understand that this dichotomy that followed her career (and to a lesser extent her private life) wasn’t necessarily a bad thing.\n\nLisa Carol Fremont as a character was at times rather selfish, stubborn, and oftentimes just plain rude. That’s understandable, of course, when you realize she’s dealing with a man with a proclivity for adventure and a fear of commitment (played to perfection by James Stewart), yet as I was re-watching Grace as Lisa with a different set of eyes, I quickly recognized, “well, of course, she would act this way.”\n\nAlfred Hitchcock specifically picked Grace for this role due to this persona. Lisa was a fashionista, she loves clothing and even would forgo going on a trip with her boyfriend because she didn’t have the “proper attire” for the environment she’d be traveling in.\n\nWho in their right mind would do something like that?\n\nRight! An “ice queen” who gives off an air of entitlement and impenetrability.\n\nThere are some moments in the film where Lisa could be extraordinarily cold and distant, but it only ever happened when she was in crisis or when Jeff wasn’t conforming to her standards of what their relationship should look like.\n\nGrace’s “ice queen persona” helps a lot in this aspect; she was the only actress that could’ve taken this role. Hitchcock deliberately crafted the role of Lisa Carol Fremont for Grace, he knew that if any other woman stepped into that role, the entire tone of the film could have been something that he didn’t intend to mean.\n\n‘Hitch’ has always carefully crafted his pictures this way, it doesn’t surprise me that he chose Grace for this role. This same sentiment could be applied to her role in 1955’s To Catch a Thief as well.\n\nIf it wasn’t for Hitchcock‘s cinema IQ and Grace’s typecast, I don’t believe Rear Window would’ve been as good as it is.\n\nIt’s funny, all it took for me to understand this was my fear of flying and my love for overanalyzing movies.\n\nGo figure.\n\nThe M-G-M movie musical has become intrinsically linked with the Golden Age of Hollywood.\n\nThe rouge stained faces, silk dresses, and elaborate backdrops are all staples of MGM’s musical repertoire. Unlike their soulless modern counterpart (I don’t know why producers subject us to this mumbo jumbo) classic Hollywood musicals have a magical quality to them that could only exist in that specific era in movie history.\n\nNo other film personifies this feeling better than 1957’s Les Girls.\n\nDirected by the legendary George Cukor and starring a talented cast of dancers, actors, and singers that include the fabulous Mitzi Gaynor, the witty Kay Kendall, the very sensual Taina Elg, and of course, everyone’s favorite hoofer Gene Kelly, Les Girls is every francophile’s dream.\n\nTold in 3 segments, the film tells the story of three women and their experiences working in Paris as showgirls. It goes sours when, 10 years later, one of the women writes a shocking memoir detailing the unglamorous side of being in show business.\n\nThe movie begins in London at the Royal Courts of Justice where Angele DuCros (played by Taina Elg) is suing her former dance troupe member Lady Wren- formally known as Sybil Wren (played by Kay Kendall) for defamation.\n\nSybil’s memoirs recount the days and memories she had while working for Barry Paris (played by Gene Kelly) and his vaudeville act – Les Girls ironically, in the same city that shares his last name. In one of the book’s chapters, Sybil alleges that Angele stepped out on her then-fiancé now-husband Pierre DuCros with Barry and tried to commit suicide after he rebuffed her advances.\n\nReady to take the stand to defend her honor, Sybil’s testimony takes us back to Paris circa 1949, where the streets were white and the wine was dark.\n\nBarry is looking for another woman to add to his already very successful dance group, which already has Sybil, of course, and American Joanne “Joy” Henderson (played by Mitzi Gaynor.) Being the overbearing man he is, Barry has 4 rules that each girl must abide by:\n\nBe prompt\n\nBe persistent\n\nBe private\n\nand the last and most absurd important of them all….\n\nNo marriage.\n\nWell, then!\n\nAngele joins the troupe and instantly break the one rule that essentially holds the group together when she reveals that she’s engaged to Pierre.\n\nA couple of days go by and Les Girls finally make their debut as a trio with a song (whether you like it or not) that will invade your mind and become a VERY catchy earworm. After a performance that would’ve made Louis the XIV proud, the girls head to their dressing rooms where Angele makes a startling confession.\n\nShe has a bit of a crush on Barry.\n\nSybil and Joy attempt to warn her about Barry’s playboy lifestyle.\n\n“But it is ze French way to ‘ave an affair!” she snaps back. Sybil and Joy can only shake their head in grief, loathing what they might have to do to keep this lie going.\n\nLater in the evening, Barry and Angele run off to have an impromptu “rehearsal” to “go over” the new dance number they created. Back at the apartment, Angele’s fiancé unexpectedly drops by for a visit. Unwillingly to break the ‘girl-code’ Joy and Sybil comes up with all sorts of lies to cover for their friend’s lack of foresight.\n\nWhen Angele returns from her rendezvous with Barry, Pierre excitedly tells her that his parents are in Paris to meet her, the final step in their courtship.\n\nUh, oh. There’s a problem here.\n\nPierre believes Angele is in Paris studying to be a nurse and is cohabitating with Joy and Sybil to save on rent costs; she’s neglected to tell him that she’s actually a dancer. Nevertheless, she still plans on performing the following night… IN FRONT OF Pierre and his parents, seeing as they have tickets for the show.\n\nBelieving that this her only chance at true happiness, before the show begins Angele pleads with Barry to confess his ‘love’ for her. Barry being reasonable, obviously rejects her efforts, Angele takes the stage a beaten and broken woman. On top of that, she also makes a fool of herself, trying to hide her face from being seen by Pierre.\n\nToo late!\n\nIn trying to conceal her face, she manages to screw up the number and ruin her costume. Assuming she’s ruined her chances with both men, Angele looks to Sybil and Joy – particularly Sybil, for comfort. Nighttime begins to fall, and Joy and Sybil go out for a bite to eat, leaving Angele in the apartment alone. When they return, they find her passed out from inhaling gas fumes.\n\nReturning to the courtroom, Sybil explains that Angele wanted to die because of her unrequited feelings toward Barry. Pierre horrified during the duration of the testimony, is humiliated by the alleged affair that took place between Angele and Barry and raucously argues with her. The next day in court, Angele gets to right her wrongs by telling her version of events.\n\nBack to 1949 Paris, we go….\n\nSybil’s fiancé London businessman Gerald Wren (of course his name is Gerald…) pays her a surprise visit (what’s with the surprise visits?) to Paris to see how’s she’s doing.\n\nTurns out she isn’t well at all, in fact, she’s terribly drunk.\n\nBeing the good friends they are, Joy and Angele use their wit and charm to distract Gerald and cover up Sybil’s indiscretions. Barry notices Sybil’s declining status and threatens to fire her until Angele convinces him not to when she explains that her drunkenness is due her unreciprocated love for him.\n\nBarry ego is said to have swelled 5x that day and he soon takes pity on her.\n\nMonths later, Barry asserts that he was able to convince Sybil to go sober; Oh, and they also end up having an affair as per tradition.\n\nTouring the small Carribean country of Grenada (odd, but understandable) Gerald, again, pops up suddenly on this tiny island offering Barry a job in London. Little did he know that Gerald had ulterior motives. You see, Gerald did this with the hope that Sybil would return to London, and stay there – permanently.\n\nLater that night, Sybil and Barry head to a Flamenco club where they discuss the proposition Gerald gave them. However, when Barry brings up the subject Sybil tells him that Gerald canceled his offer after he learned about the affair that they’re having. Befuddled at this statement, when Gerald show up at the club a few moments later, Barry disavows Sybil’s statement.\n\nGerald, naturally, shocked that his fianceé would cheat on him, starts a good ole’ fashioned barfight with Barry. After that whole ordeal, Sybil tries to apologize to Barry with no luck. He comes clean saying that he only showed interest in her intending to curb her habit of alcoholism.\n\nShocked and saddened, Sybil relapses.\n\nThe group returns to Paris where Sybil’s nasty habit starts to bleed into her performances.\n\nBarry ends up firing her in a fit of rage.\n\nBack at the apartment later that night (there are sure a lot of night scenes in this movie) Angele finds Sybil unconscious from inhaling gas fumes and comes to the conclusion that she tried to commit suicide, thus ending Angele’s “side” to the story.\n\nWe return to the courtroom where the session has been adjourned. Sybil confronts Angele claiming she invented every word of her story.\n\nWell, Sybil’s accusations aren’t enough for her husband Gerald, and he ends up telling her that their marriage is over.\n\nThe next day, Barry is called into court to make sense of all of these conflicting testimonies.\n\nPerhaps my favorite of the 3 stories (mostly because I identify with Joy so strongly here) Barry admits that he wasn’t in love with Sybil or Angele; as matter of fact, he had he eyes set the quieter more conservative, Joy.\n\nHis attempts to court her fail – repeatedly. Joy doesn’t want to dirty her unblemished reputation by dating a man with Barry’s womanizing history.\n\nOne night after rehearsals, Barry offers to drive a very tired Joy back to her apartment. Fully aware that he’s trying to take advantage of her, Joy allows him upstairs and tells him she’s going to slip into something “a little bit more comfortable.”\n\nFully believing that he’s got his way, Barry takes off his shoes, looses up his tie and makes himself comfortable only to have his dream crushed when Joy returns looking like she’s ready to travel to the spa, pinned up hair and all!\n\nBarry storms out of the apartment in sexual frustration. A couple of days later, Pierre and Gerald ask Barry to fire Sybil and Angele so they could marry them (how ridiculously selfish!), Barry doesn’t think so, however. Intrigued at the prospect of being alone with Joy, he plots a plan that would disband the group forever.\n\nThat night after performing the greatest and most sensual musical number I’ve ever witnessed, Barry collapses backstage feigning a heart condition prompting Joy to console him. He tells Joy that even though he’s been diagnosed with a terminal heart condition, “the show must go on.”\n\n“Absolutely not!” she retorts back.\n\nBarry’s plan appears to have worked.\n\nJoy charges back to the apartment where she tells Angele and Sybil the ghastly news.\n\nA few days later, the girls and Barry have an anniversary party celebrating the group’s existence. It’s at this gathering that Sybil and Angele agree to quit the group due to Barry’s health (among other things.) He accepts their resignations and asks Joy if she could kindly take him home.\n\nWhen they get to his apartment, Barry falls on top of Joy still pretending to have a heart palpitation. She desperately wants to succumb to his advances, but she fears if she gets his heart rate up, he could be in worse shape than he already is.\n\nThat’s it!\n\nBarry gives up this shtick that he’s doing and tells Joy that it’s all a facade. This clearly does NOT go over well with Joy and she races out of his apartment while Barry runs after her. In a very Say Anything… type of moment Barry gets to Joy’s apartment (really the apartment she shares with the girls) and essentially screams out that he loves her. Jokes on him, if he only knew that Joy was standing a few yards away from him, he might’ve never done that.\n\nOh, well.\n\nDisappointed that he didn’t get the response he wanted, Barry sulks up to her apartment where he finds Angele and Sybil passed out from gas fumes from a wonky water heater.\n\nBack to the present day, Barry explains that both girls were taken to the hospital and Les Girls never performed as a group again.\n\nBoth Sybil and Angele were troubled that the cause of their asphyxiation was never made clear to them, but that doesn’t matter anymore! Sybil accepts Angele’s motion to drop the case and all is right with the world, except for Pierre and Gerald.\n\nInsulted by their husband’s scheme to end their careers Angele and Sybil embrace like old friends as they walk off to their cars.\n\nAs for Barry? Well, he and Joy got married.\n\nI guess everyone did get what they wanted in the end.\n\nHow sweet.\n\nConclusion\n\nNow, Les Girls is a film that stands out above the rest.\n\nReleased in 1957, just as the musical craze in Hollywood was starting to die down due to 1960s obsession with rebellion and counterculture, Les Girls brings back that old Hollywood flavor to musicals that harken back to the day of Busby Berkeley.\n\nThat’s what I love about this film.\n\nIt’s absolutely heavenly.\n\nIt makes you want to fly to Paris find the nearest bistro order a café au lait while smoking Virginia Slims with a cigarette holder.\n\nKay Kendall, Mitzi Gaynor, and Taina Elg gave this move an extra *umpfh* that the original cast of Leslie Caron, Jean Simmons, Cyd Charisse probably couldn’t.\n\nGene Kelly was positively charming (and kind of scummy) playing the egomaniacal, fame-hungry Barry Paris.\n\nThis is definitely a movie that I cherish. When I first viewed it, I was enchanted. The lights, the dresses, the sets, the costumes by Orry Kelly, all of it sucked me in. I supposed this a lesser-known musical that doesn’t nearly get enough attention – it’s a shame because it should. Without it, I never would’ve never known who Kay Kendall was; trust me, folks she lived a crazy life, an unfortunate one at that.\n\nAll in all Les Girls is my second favorite musical (behind Seven Brides for Seven Brothers of course.) It deserves that spot because it’s truly in a league of its own and I’m glad it is.\n\n“An Italian bombshell and an English gentleman walk into a Roman bar…”\n\nThis is a story of the courtship, romance and eventual falling out between two classic Hollywood legends.\n\nShe’s from the eternal city of Naples, He’s from the cold, windy, rainy streets of Bristol in southern England. She grew up in the working class fishing town of Pozzuoli, He grew up with a mother who was very insistent on having her son become a star.\n\nOne was discovered during a flight to Rome, the other by a vaudeville act when he was expelled out of his, very strict, very expensive private secondary school. Despite all of this, both wanted nothing more than to be loved and cherished.\n\nThe tale of Cary Grant and Sophia Loren is one of classic Hollywood legend. They first met on the set of The Pride and The Passion in 1957 and from then on, their story takes on another life of its own.\n\nSo, sit back, relax and enjoy the tale of an old Hollywood romance that almost was.\n\nTheir Movies\n\nWhen you read about on-set romances, they usually start on movies that are glamorous, exciting and well-received.\n\nThis isn’t the case.\n\nThe Pride and The Passion is an action adventure that stars Frank Sinatra, Sophia Loren, and Cary Grant. Directed by Stanley Kramer, the film is a modern re-telling of a Napoleonic war era battle between the Spanish and the French.\n\nGrant plays British Royal Navy Captain Anthony Trumbull, who is sent on a mission to retrieve a siege cannon in Spain, then return it to British forces. His orders are spoiled by a Spanish guerrilla leader, played by Sinatra, who wants to use the weapon to capture the town of Ávila before French forces stake their claim. As for Loren‘s character, well, she’s basically the ‘token’ woman that Sinatra and Grant fight over.\n\nThis movie would NOT pass the Bechdel Test.\n\nAnyway…\n\nThe picture didn’t do too well; It was critically and commercially panned with the worst reviews being reserved for the horrendous plot. Luckily for the duo, they’d get a second chance to redeem themselves with 1958’s Houseboat.\n\nThe better of the two movies that this duo stars in, Houseboat, is a romantic comedy that I can not stand did significantly better than Grant and Loren‘s first cinematic go-round. Grant stars as a Tom Winton, a widower who’s struggling to raise his three kids after his wife’s tragic death.\n\nNo need to worry! In enters, a gorgeous, charming 23-year-old Italian named Cinzia Zaccardi who he meets at a concert and hires her to be his live-in nanny. Jokes on him, Cinzia is actually a wealthy socialite on the run from her tyrannical father and has no idea how to cook, clean or take care of children. On the bright side, she does have a romantic interest in the man who employed her.\n\nLaughter and situational comedy ensue.\n\nFor the rest of the film, the pair goes through a number awkward situations and adventures all while falling in love. In the final moments of the movie, the pair ends up happily married and living permanently on the Houseboat they once loathed.\n\nUnlike their widely criticized 1957 counterpart, Houseboat enjoyed a lot of success. It was critically and financially successful and was nominated for two Academy Awards. However, by the time filming wrapped on the romantic comedy, the intense passion between Grant and Loren, that started in 1957, started to fizzle out.\n\nTheir Romance\n\nIt all started in Spain.\n\nIn 1956, Sophia‘s husband Carlo Ponti landed his wife a role in the Stanley Kramer production The Pride and the Passion. Having his cast and crew assembled, Kramer threw a cocktail party to celebrate the start of filming. Sophia, who was so nervous she changed her dress multiple times, was one of the first ones to arrive.\n\nStricken with anxiety, she patiently waited for her fellow co-stars to show up to this little get-together. A couple of hours and martinis later, the nervousness swiftly melts away when Cary steps into the room.\n\nWhen they first meet, Grant teases her by conflating her name with a fellow Italian actress Gina Lollobrigida, but, eventually that teasing escalated into deep conversations and late-night dining at Spanish restaurants.\n\nThey fell in love.\n\nGrant, in particular, took this relationship – hard.\n\nIn anticipation of her arrival in America, Grant wrote Loren several letters detailing the trials and tribulations her career could face in an entirely new country. What was also enclosed in these letters were two gold bracelets he had given her. Grant was serious about her, he wanted marriage.\n\nShe was all for it until Sophia realized she was VERY involved with her FIANCÉ of 3 years Carlo Ponti.\n\nUh oh.\n\nIt was a stroke of luck and Jayne Mansfield’s dress that changed the trajectory of Cary and Sophia‘s relationship.\n\nHow? Let’s find out…\n\nThe Aftermath\n\nAfter location shoots in Spain and Libya, Ponti and Loren flew to California and checked into the Beverly Hills Hotel to attend a reception held in her honor at Romanoff’s restaurant. The event was going smoothly until it was crashed by Jayne Mansfield.\n\nIf you’re a classic movie fan, then you’ve probably seen that infamous photo of Mansfield and Loren. It may seem like all fun and games now, but, at the time Sophia was very put off by this so-called “publicity stunt.”\n\nThis was the turning point.\n\nAlready turned off by the Hollywood lifestyle, this incident sent those feelings over the edge. On top of this, the studios didn’t really know the type of films to put her in. Was she a dramatic actress? A Comedienne?\n\n“I know,” says your typical Hollywood producer, ” I’ll put her in as many stereotypical Italian roles as I can!”\n\nSo, Loren goes forth and does her due diligence in Hollywood until she can’t take it anymore. She was a hair’s breadth away from quitting altogether and returning to Italy until the script for Houseboat came along.\n\nRe-united and feeling lonely, Grant and Loren fall even harder the 2nd time around. It was then where Carlo decided to do something drastic.\n\nFortunately for Mr. Ponti, he didn’t have to choose.\n\nSophia was faced with two choices.\n\nGo back to Italy with a man (and a mentor) who, “belonged to my world,” as she would later put it. Or, stay in the United States and start a new life with a man that she met a year ago?\n\nThe choice was clear to her – she decided on Carlo. He gave her a sense of security and the confidence to go do great things, but, not in America. That’s the advantage that Carlo had over Cary: Italy.\n\nUltimately, Sophia loved her homeland and Carlo more than she ever could love the bright lights and glamour of Hollywood. Cary was disappointed, but, hell – he’s Cary Grant for crying out loud, he was bound to find someone else.\n\nAs for Sophia and Carlo? They lived happily ever after. What could possibly be more classic Hollywood than that?\n\nIf you would like to read more entries in this blogathon click: here.\n\nI watched Bus Stop the other night, and I think I’m in love.\n\nDon Murray.\n\nLord, have mercy.\n\nI’ve never seen a more handsome man on the silver screen, other than Paul Henreid of course. There was something about Murray‘s performance in Bus Stop, however, that changed the way I saw this film.\n\nAs a matter of fact, not only does Murray (in his film debut by the way) give an unbelievably attractive performance as thick-headed country boy Beauregard “Bo” Decker, Marilyn Monroe, arguably, gives the best acting display in her entire filmography.\n\nAt this point in her career, Marilyn was exhausted, not just mentally and physically, but creatively; she wanted, desperately, to shake off the “dumb blonde, sex-pot” stereotype.\n\n“How might I go about this,” the then 29-year-old Marilyn asked herself in 1955.\n\nWell, after many days of deliberation and pacing the floor of her California home, she found a way.\n\nDespite coming off the successes of films like Gentlemen Prefer Blondes and The Seven Year Itch, Monroe was tired of the dross that 20th Century Fox was sending her. Because of this, she took the matter into her own hands.\n\nStudying at the Actors Studio with the legendary Lee Strasberg, Monroe fled to New York where she took a sabbatical to hone her skills as an actress.\n\nLuckily for Marilyn, this “leave of absence” did wonders for her confidence in her acting ability. Revitalized and anxious, she returned to Hollywood on December 31st, 1955 where she re-negotiated her contract with 20th Century Fox which saw (in the fine print) Monroe gain control of the story material, the director and cinematographer for all of the movies she starred in.\n\nIn tandem with this decision, Monroe also opened up her own production studio, aptly named, “Marilyn Monroe Productions.” Subsequently, the first film ‘MMP’ happened to produce for Fox was the movie that kickstarted a 5 year period where Marilyn attempted to shed the persona she believed was holding her back from reaching her full potential.\n\nDirected by Joshua Logan and starring Marilyn Monroe, Don Murray, and Arthur O’ Connell, Bus Stop is a hilariously endearing film about a rambunctious, dimwitted cowboy and his journey to find love.\n\nNot just any kind of love, though – no – he wants an angel; one he picks himself, one that loves him unconditionally, one that (as we see later) wants absolutely nothing to do with him.\n\nNaive, raucous, lewd, and just plain rude, Beauregard “Bo” Decker is a 21- year- old cowboy who has the social awareness of a child. Only having been off his family’s Montana ranch once in his life, his guardian/father figure Virgil “Virg” Blessing (played Arthur O’ Connell) starts to mentally prepare ‘Bo’ for a rodeo they’re participating in all the way down in dusty Phoenix, Arizona.\n\nSeeing how ‘Bo’ is probably the only 21-year-old male who hasn’t had a girlfriend, ‘Virg’ encourages him to take an interest in the opposite sex.\n\nDuring this 19 hour trip to “The Copper State”, ‘Virg’ gives ‘Bo’ some advice on how to properly handle a woman. He advises him to settle down and marry a “plain old little girl” who could be there to take care of him when, eventually, ‘Virg’ either dies or moves onto something bigger and better.\n\nUnfortunately, his advice falls on deaf ears.\n\n‘Bo’, like most men, wants a woman who can do no wrong, someone he can put on a pedestal and treat like a goddess, someone who exists purely for his pleasure, he wants an angel – his angel.\n\nEventually, he got one.\n\nAs their bus nears Phoenix, it stops for an hour or so for a quick rest at a small diner named “Grace’s” run by, coincidentally, a woman named Grace (played by Betty Field.) ‘Bo’, with his lack of table skills and brash attitude, aggressively storms the eatery, plops down on one of their swivel chairs, and loudly requests to have served to him three uncooked hamburgers with milk and a side of onions.\n\nNot only is this very unhealthy and disgusting, it also doesn’t go over too well with the other paying customers and his bus mates.\n\nAfter he finishes his meal, ‘Bo’ decides it’s time to “hop to it” and get back on the road. Wanting to keep the peace, the bus’s driver Carl (played by Robert Bray) obliges.\n\nThey board the bus and ‘Virg’ spots a nice, young girl that ‘Bo’ could possibly take up with. He introduces himself to her and the girl says her name is Elma (played by Hope Lange.) Elated that he found a girl for his ‘traveling companion’, ‘Virg’ swiftly encourages ‘Bo’ to court this young woman, but, he isn’t interested; he’s still holding out for that “angel” that he so longingly craves.\n\nA couple of hours and dusty back roads later, the bus arrives at Phoenix. Exhausted and thirsty (not for water, if that’s what you’re thinking) they head to the local saloon named the Blue Dragon Café.\n\nSo, Virg and ‘Bo’ saunter into this pub when the young cowboy, finally, spots his angel: a 5’5″ honey blonde, cabaret singer named ‘Cherie’ (played by Marilyn Monroe.)\n\n‘Cherie’ (or “Cherry” as ‘Bo’ would later go onto mispronounce) is an ambitious, tone-deaf singer who hopelessly wants a career under the bright lights of Hollywood. Being from a small town in the backwoods of Arkansas, ‘Cherie’ hitch-hiked her way to Phoenix, marking each town she stopped at with a smidgen of lipstick on her map.\n\nWhile ‘Cherie’ performs her sultry rendition of “That Ole’ Black Magic” with ‘Virg’ looking on in amazement, ‘Bo’ storms the bar, and immediately locks eyes with the sultry singer.\n\nUtterly infatuated with this woman, ‘Bo’ stalks her backstage after her set and convinces her to have a quick chat with him.\n\nNo sex, just talking.\n\nInitially, ‘Cherie’ is shocked that a man is treating her with respect, and quickly becomes enamored with ‘Bo’s physically strong nature.\n\n‘Bo’ takes this interest as an invitation to visit ‘Cherie’ early the next morning just as she’s getting out of bed. Much to her chagrin, ‘Bo’ comes to see ‘Cherie’ at her boarding house and proclaims (from the mountain tops) that they’re engaged.\n\nHorrified and terribly turned off by his demeanor, ‘Cherie’ relents all the feelings she ever had about him and angrily tells ‘Bo’ off. Naturally, this hurts him, seeing how this woman (now fiancée) was his “angel.” Hoping to impress her with his “intellect”, ‘Bo’ recites the Gettysburg Address while straddling an unclothed, half awake ‘Cherie.’ This only upsets her further and frustrates ‘Bo’ even more.\n\nSick and tired of trying to properly court a woman, ‘Bo’ chooses to handle the situation in a calm, rational, sensible manne-\n\nWho am I kidding? He reverts back to his farm boy ways and rips ‘Cherie’ out of bed and forces her to go to the rodeo he’s performing in later that day.\n\nA couple of moments after that, we see ‘Bo’ holding up an annoyed ‘Cherie’ on his shoulders, believing that he’s being a proper gentleman by letting her see the pre-rodeo parade from, in his opinion, the best vantage point possible.\n\nAt the actual event that ‘Bo’ and ‘Virg’ traveled to Phoenix for, ‘Cherie’ is not only fatigued mentally but physically as well. Due to the rigorous situations ‘Bo’ has been putting her in, sitting in the stands watching her husband-to-be hoot and holler about getting married becomes a tortuous affair.\n\nAt the end of her wits, ‘Cherie’ attempts to flee.\n\nNot so fast.\n\nWhile riding a bull, ‘Bo’ spots ‘Cherie’ scurrying along the dusty bull pen looking for an exit. In the middle of roping a calf, ‘Bo’ runs after her, which gives the crowd a further reason to believe that the marriage between the two is imminent.\n\nWhen ‘Cherie’ returns to her room at the boarding house she and her friend Vera (played by Eileen Heckart) help her pack a trunk filled with clothes and other valuable items. Back at The Blue Dragon, ‘Virg’ and ‘Cherie’ have a heart to heart about her situation with ‘Bo’. ‘Virg’ slowly explains to her over a nice glass of whiskey that the 21- year -old lovesick cowboy is a kissless virgin.\n\nWith this new information known, ‘Cherie’, ‘Virg’ and Vera come up with a strategy to handle ‘Bo’. But, before anything could be implemented, ‘Bo’ finds the trio at the Café and promptly wants answers. Not one to tell a lie, ‘Cherie’ simply tells ‘Bo’, “goodbye forever.”\n\nFury\n\nThis enrages ‘Bo’.\n\nHe can’t possibly understand why his “angel” wants absolutely, positively nothing to do with him.\n\n“That’s it”, he says and in a fit of anger, he tears off the train of ‘Cherie’s’ dress as she’s running away. In a McLintock! style chase scene to her bus station, ‘Cherie’ tries to shake off the looming footsteps of her former fiancé. Frantically trying to lose the man she once was in love with, her anxieties ease when she gets to her bus without interruption.\n\nNot so fast.\n\nBefore ‘Cherie’ could step foot on her ticket “outta there” ‘Bo’ comes rearing like a buckin’ Bronco and lassos (yes, lassos) ‘Cherie’ like a calf and forces her to come back to his ranch in Montana.\n\nJust as she thought would be able to escape the vice-like grip ‘Bo’ had on her, ‘Cherie’ now has to sit through a 19 hour trip on a rickety bus to the snowy tundra of Montana. As the bus approaches Grace’s Diner, which is the midway point of the journey, the bus is forced to make a stop due to a blizzard.\n\nAs the bus stops and everyone else is fast asleep, ‘Cherie’ makes a B-line towards the diner’s door, hoping to, somehow, lose ‘Bo’ in the process. Quickly realizing that something’s gone missing, ‘Bo’ wakes up and barges into the diner demanding to see “Cherry.”\n\nWhen asked why she left him behind on the bus, ‘Cherie’ couldn’t answer.\n\n“Okay, no answer? I’ll just force it outta’ ya!”\n\nSo, ‘Bo’s harassment goes on for an uncomfortable amount of time which eventually sees our friendly neighborhood bus driver Carl pick him up by the scruff of the neck and challenge him to a fight.\n\nBeing a rough n’ tumble farm boy, you’d think that he would easily win the fight, right?\n\nHah, no.\n\n‘Bo’ loses – badly.\n\nSent with his tail between his legs, the next morning ‘Virg’ forces ‘Bo’ to apologize to ‘Cherie.’\n\nHe does it, begrudgingly, and to ‘Cherie’s’ surprise he also returns the green scarf that went missing the first night they met, which can be seen: here. Wanting to end it once and for all, ‘Cherie’ gives back his engagement ring.\n\nOuch.\n\nInstead of making a giant hullabaloo about it like he normally would’ve done, he tells her to keep, in remembrance of the love he has (or had) for her. ‘Cherie’ feels bad about this and struggles to tell ‘Bo’ that she wasn’t the perfect angel that he thought she was.\n\nIn the final, arguably most heart touching scene of the film, ‘Bo’ and ‘Cherie’ share a poignant moment together where ‘Bo’ tries to explain that his lack of experience and her abundance can cancel each other out, and they can live happily together without any jealousy.\n\nThis sentiment moves ‘Cherie’, particularly when ‘Bo’ tells her that he can love her despite the way she feels about herself. Caving into his affections, ‘Cherie’ throws her map to Hollywood away and embraces him with a warm hug, thus ending a weeklong courtship that started in horror, but, ended in love.\n\nConclusion\n\nThis movie marked the change in the way I saw Marilyn.\n\nI know, it’s not fair to judge, but, I’m glad I watched Bus Stop.\n\nLike I said at the beginning of the review, Don Murray hooked me. He was unquestionably the best part of the movie. His portrayal of naive farm boy ‘Bo’ sent this movie into overdrive. This easily could’ve been another Monroe sex romp picture, but both Murray and Monroe put in performances that taught me otherwise.\n\nMonroe as ‘Cherie’ the fame hungry saloon singer who’s desperate to avoid her past, is award worthy. Some people may disagree, but, I undoubtedly believe that at this point in her career, Marilyn‘s reinvention of herself was for the better.\n\nBy studying at the Actor’s Studio, Marilyn has said that the experience, “had opened a part of her head, given her confidence in herself, in her brainpower, in her ability to think out and create a character.”\n\nThis is what makes Bus Stop so great, not because of its scenic shots of Montana, or its bits humor interjected at the perfect times, no, it’s because of the intimacy between Murray and Monroe.\n\nThey were very believable as a couple, which comes as a surprise since, allegedly, Murray and Marilyn didn’t get along too well during filming. That’s just a testament to how good this film is. Everyone who worked on this movie deserves some credit, it’s fantastically crafted, masterfully directed, and beautifully acted.\n\nIf you haven’t seen it you should, it will certainly pull at your heartstrings, I know it did with mine.\n\nI have a bone to pick with this movie.\n\nSure, it’s Grace Kelly and Cary Grant in the French Riviera.\n\nYeah, it’s Alfred Hitchcock in his prime, but, the movie lacks…..something.\n\nReleased in 1955, To Catch a Thief stars Cary Grant, Grace Kelly and Jessie Royce Landis in what could be the worst of the three films Kelly did with Hitchcock. I don’t mean that in a malicious way; I believe, objectively, that the plot in this film compared to Dial M for Murder and Rear Window is hands down the weakest of the Kelly/Hitchcock films.\n\nMy main gripe?\n\nThe plot\n\nThe Story\n\nCary Grant plays John “The Cat” Robie, a retired cat burglar who now lives a secluded life on the French Riviera.\n\nAfter a string robberies that were made to imitate his style, Robie immediately returns to being public enemy number one. The police show up to his seaside villa to arrest him, but Robie manages to escape out the back.\n\nNaturally, running away from police builds up an appetite, so, John visits a restaurant.\n\nHe walks into the kitchen and instantly recognizes the staff. The cooks, busboys, and sous chefs are all old buddies from John’s French Resistance days.\n\nThey harbor a bit of resentment towards John because they were granted parole based on how patriotic they were. Because of John’s new ‘adventure,’ they’re all under suspicion of colluding as long as ‘The Cat’ is still active. Things get hostile for a minute, then calm down when the police see Robie and he makes a run for it.\n\nConveniently enough, the restaurant’s owner’s teenaged daughter named Danielle (played by Brigitte Auber) shuttles him away to safety.\n\nRobie desperately wants to clear his name.\n\nIn order to do that, he seeks the help of a man named H.H Hughson (played by John Williams.) Hughson is an insurance man who gives Robie a list of, as he puts it, the “most expensive jewelry owners currently on the Riviera.”\n\nFirst on that list? A woman named Jessie Stevens (played by Jessie Royce Landis) and her very charming daughter Frances (played by Grace Kelly.) John, posing as an Oregon lumber magnate, strikes up a conversation with them later that night at dinner.\n\nSo the trio and John start a dialogue about a multitude of different subjects. The discussion, embarrassingly, culminates in Jessie Stevens asking John why he hasn’t made a move on her daughter.\n\nOh, Lord..\n\nFrances, or “Francie” as her mother calls her, originally shows no interest. However, that all changes when John walks her back to her hotel room and Francie proceeds to give him a good night kiss.\n\nThe next morning, Robie receives a note claiming that his life in danger as he’s tanning on the beach with Frances. Danielle walks by with an inquisitive look on her face as she dives into the water. John, not one to miss out, follows her.\n\nDanielle goes on to tell Robie that there are a group of ex-convicts that are out to kill him.\n\nLater that day on a picnic, Frances tells John that she knows he isn’t an American businessman. In fact, not only does she know that he’s John Robie “The Cat”, she also begs him to be his accomplice. Robie, bending but not breaking, maintains his innocence and agrees to meet Frances in her hotel room later that night.\n\nIf you’ve seen this movie, then you know that this next scene is THE scene.\n\nRobie shows up to Frances’ hotel room and Frances tries to tempt him with the jewels she’s wearing. Jokes on her though, John quickly recognizes that her necklace is fake. As the moment progresses and the fireworks build up behind them, the pair shares a very passionate kiss as the screen fades to black.\n\nThis quiet moment lasted for about 8 hours.\n\nThe morning after Frances and John’s rendezvous, she storms his hotel room asking where her mother’s jewels were. Robie admits that he’s “The Cat” but, he didn’t steal the jewelry. Francie doesn’t care, she calls the police anyway. But, before they got there, John has already slipped out of the window.\n\nSick and tired of being accused of a crime, John decides to surveil the area for that night. In case something goes wrong, Robie calls the police as a preventative measure.\n\nWell, what do you know, something does happen.\n\nJohn struggles with an attacker and accidentally shoves him off the building.\n\nOops.\n\nThe next scene we see is everyone gathered around a casket. The man inside is Danielle’s father, Foussard. While walking out of the cathedral, a policeman tells John that they’ve identified the body and that he’s cleared of all suspicion.\n\n“Oh, no!” says John.\n\nRobie claims it couldn’t have been Foussard because he had a peg leg. Understandably, the police let him go to find the real ‘Cat’ later that night at a masquerade party.\n\nIt turns out that at the gathering, everything falls into to place for John.\n\nIn the end, John catches the woman *gasp* that was posing as him (it was Danielle), clears his name, and starts a long-term relationship with Frances.\n\nHow perfect is that?\n\nThe Bone I Have To Pick With This Movie\n\nWhere do I begin? I love Cary Grant and Grace Kelly equally. I love their movies. I love them in this movie together, but, this film lacks something.\n\nI know, I know, there are A LOT of folks who adore this movie. I don’t want to take that away from anybody, but, there are some glaring issues in this movie for me.\n\nThe plot.\n\nMy main issue with it is that it’s non-existent. It’s very compelling for the first 20 or so minutes and then it sort of….drops off. There were a lot of ‘lull’ moments in the film. At times, I didn’t really care about the side stories, I just wanted to know who stole the darn jewels.\n\nHeck, even Hitchcock called this picture a “lightweight” story.\n\nI never felt that anyone was in real danger in this movie. In Dial M, and Rear Window I was genuinely afraid for certain characters. Not once did I believe that Cary Grant was going to get harmed in any way in this film.\n\nThe moments between Cary and Grace, however, were excellent and dripping with innuendo, as only Hitchcock can do. But, other than that, it didn’t give that same thrill that I got from other films from Hitch.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn the end, my opinion is just an opinion. I may not enjoy this movie as much as other Hitchcock features, but that doesn’t mean I don’t appreciate it. The shooting locations are gorgeous and the coincidence of Grace Kelly shooting one of her last movies in Monaco isn’t lost on me.\n\nI do enjoy the film, I truly do. Sometimes, movies you think you were going to like don’t always go the way you plan, and that’s okay.\n\nIf you would like to read more entries in this blogathon click: here.\n\n“Too Bad, We can’t go back to Moscow!”\n\nI don’t think there’s a musical that I enjoy watching more than Silk Stockings.\n\nReleased in 1957, the movie co-stars Fred Astaire, Cyd Charisse, Janis Page, and Peter Lorre in what could be the best musical adaption of a film that originally wasn’t meant to be one.\n\nThe Plot\n\nThe film follows Fred Astaire‘s character, an American producer named Steve Canfield, as he travels to Russia to convince musician Peter Illyich Boroff (played by Wim Sonneveld) to compose some music for his new movie that is being shot in Paris. After some coaxing, Boroff agrees and starts working on Canfield’s score. A few weeks and many pieces of paper later, Boroff finishes Canfield’s request. The only problem is, Boroff doesn’t want to return to his homeland.\n\nThis doesn’t go over too well in Russia. To fix this, three incompetent commissars played by Peter Lorre, Jules Munshin, and Joseph Buloff are sent over to Paris bring him back to the motherland. Brankov, Bibinski, and Ivanov, as they’re called, try to do the best they can to return Boroff back to Russia.\n\nSteve Canfield has other ideas.\n\nTo prevent his composer from returning to that ice-filled abyss that is Russia, he comes up with a very clever excuse. Steve, ingeniously tells them that his friend Boroff isn’t really who he says he is. According to Steve, he’s found an affidavit that disputes Peter’s Russian heritage and that they need to go to court to resolve the issue.\n\nBeing the bumbling numpties that they are, the trio believes the lie and lets Boroff stay.\n\nSteve spends the next couple of weeks exposing the three commissars to Western culture.\n\nWomen, nightclubs, French champagne, you name it.\n\n*MEANWHILE*\n\nBack in Russia, they get word that their commissars are having an extended Parisian ‘holiday.’ Worried and frustrated (as most Soviets were) they send a militant, “homely” looking women named Ninotchka (ha ha!) Yoschenko played by Cyd Charisse to drag all four of the men home.\n\n(I put homely in quotations because it’s Cyd Charisse, there’s absolutely nothing homely about her! But, in this film, she was supposed to be, oh well!)\n\nNinotchka walks into their hotel’s lobby and, immediately, her Communist sensibilities begin to get assaulted. She shocked at what she sees; servile laborers, a lavish interior, and an advertisement that happens to be selling silk stockings. After recovering from that shock, she finds Boroff’s suite (with Steve inside) she instantly asks him to see the affidavit.\n\nsource: MGM\n\nSteve tries to woo her, hoping to divert her attention away from her investigation with tales of late nights in Paris. Ninotchka refuses his advances, claiming they were part of the West’s “bourgeois propaganda.” The next morning, Steve semi-successfully seduces Ninotchka when she, begrudgingly, agrees to let him take her on a tour of Paris.\n\nHe makes sure that the trip is tailored to her interests while also managing to sneak a few beauty store locations in the itinerary with the hope of enticing her.\n\nWhen the pair returns Steve’s hotel room later that night, Canfield tries to set the mood with romantic music and low lighting.\n\nWhen that doesn’t work, Steve takes Ninotchka into his arms and starts dancing with her. She struggles against his lead for a few moments then, subsequently, starts moving to the rhythm, eventually succumbing to his advances. Being a dancer, Ninotchka quickly picks up Steve’s steps. Their close proximity culminates in a kiss, and her cold, Communist exterior slowly melts away.\n\nFearing that she’s getting too emotionally attached to Steve and that she’s neglecting her duties, Ninotchka decides to return to Russia with Boroff and the three commissars.\n\nA few months later, Ninotchka receives a letter from Steve. She invites the three commissars and Boroff into her apartment and tries to read it to them, but, so much of it has been redacted that only Steve’s name, greeting, and the ending remains on the sheet of paper. Disappointed, Boroff finds a piano and starts to play the composition he wrote for Steve in Paris.\n\nOvercome with joy, Ninotchka starts leaping through her apartment, showing that she’s been ‘corrupted’ by her stay in that “Western hell-hole” that is France.\n\nBack in Paris, Steve is concocting a plan to get Ninotchka, Boroff and the three commissars back to his hotel room. His scheme involves getting the commissars back to Paris to sell Russian films. He hopes that the three will overstay their welcome again and that Ninotchka will be forced to come back and retrieve them.\n\nSurprisingly, the plan works and the four of them return Paris.\n\nThe rest of the movie sees Ninotchka and Steve fall in love and get married, Boroff, ultimately, accepting Western culture, Brankov, Bibinski, and Ivanov standing up to their higher-ups and finally, everyone ends up living happily ever after in Paris.\n\nThe Wicked Fun Dancing Sequences\n\nOh, boy, where do I begin?\n\nThis film is astonishingly fun to watch. There are so many entertaining musical numbers in this movie, I don’t think I can count them on one hand.\n\nThe one number I keep on coming back to is this scene: here. It’s Cyd Charisse as Ninotchka just kicking back, and letting loose. In the movie, she plays this stuffy character that is no-nonsense, the fact that she’s able to have this moment of rapturous joy just by dancing is phenomenal.\n\nNext, of course, is Fred Astaire. We couldn’t possibly talk about this movie without discussing him. There’s this musical number where he dances alongside the lead actress in his movie, Peggy, played by Janis Page that is absolutely a riot (in a good way.) In the scene, they’re explaining that in order to sell movies, you need Technicolor, CinemaScope, and stereophonic sound, not good acting. It sounds absurd but, it couldn’t be more entertaining. If you like, you could watch it: here.\n\nIf you want to see more, here’s a list of honorable mentions:\n\nFred Astaire cutting loose.\n\nCyd and Fred cutting loose.\n\nAnd finally, my favorite, not so much of a dance scene, but a song that is a constant earworm for me.\n\nAll in all, Silk Stockings is a fabulous film to choose for this blogathon. Yeah, the plot could get confusing at times, but, for what the plot lacks more than makes up for in its musical numbers."
