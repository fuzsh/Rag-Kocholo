        "text": "1992\n\nCity Locations\n\nIrving, Fort Worth, Midlothian, TX; Las Vegas, NV (USA)\n\nLocation Types\n\nRanch, Concert/Entertainment Venue, Museum, Clubs/Bars\n\nLocation Styles\n\nRanch Style, Southwestern, Resort, Rustic, Parking Lot, Georgian/Southern\n\nAbout Pure Country\n\nReleased in 1992, Pure Country is a unique blend of drama, music, and western, directed by the gifted Christopher Cain. This film marked the impressive acting debut of country music sensation George Strait. Alongside Strait, the film boasts a dynamic cast, including Isabel Glasser, Lesley Ann Warren, and the talented Kyle Chandler.\n\nThe storyline revolves around Wyatt \"Dusty\" Chandler (George Strait), a famous country music icon who grows weary of his high-profile career and extravagant stage pageantry. Searching for authenticity, Dusty takes a detour, retreating to the humble roots of his small farm town. There, he crosses paths with a local woman named Harley Tucker (Isabel Glasser) and rediscovers his passion for life away from the spotlight. The plot thickens when his persuasive manager, Lula (Lesley Ann Warren), finds him and urges him to return to his once-glamorous music career.\n\nDespite its initial critique, Pure Country found commercial victory, raking in over $15 million at the box office. Straitâs musical contributions to the filmâs soundtrack were also met with widespread acclaim, making it his highest-selling album. This cinematic masterpiece led to two sequels: Pure Country 2: The Gift in 2010 and Pure Country: Pure Heart in 2017. Christopher Cain also took the helm for the first follow-up film.\n\nAlthough there are no records of any awards won by Pure Country, this does not diminish the film's value and significance in a unique drama-musical-western genre. This exertion is an absolute must-see for fans of Strait, westerns, and compelling character journeys.\n\nPure Country Locations\n\nTexasâs rolling hills and open fields served as the backdrop for the beloved movie Pure Country. The quaint town of Maypearl, just south of Dallas, captured the essence of the film and charmed audiences with its small-town allure. The old-fashioned Hardware and Feed store and the serenity of Cresson Cemetery, where the iconic graveyard scene was shot, invoke a truly captivating nostalgia.\n\nMeanwhile, the bustling city of Fort Worth kept the beats alive with its unquestionable charisma, wherein the memorable concert scenes were shot at the renowned Will Rogers Coliseum. And let's not forget about the dance hall scenes, which were brought to life at Western Kountry Klub in Midlothian, Texas.\n\nA trip down to these locations is more than just a wanderlust for movie fans. It's an opportunity to relive the scenes from the movie in living color, to immerse yourself in the same environment that once breathed life into the story. Stroll through Cresson Cemetery, wander through the burgeoning downtown of Fort Worth, or soak up the charm of Maypearl. For those looking to experience a part of Texas or tap into the magic of Pure Country, visiting these locations promises a worthwhile journey.\n\nBeneath the exhilarating performance at a concert, Dusty (George Strait) feels a growing unease. He believes that the spectacle of his shows overshadows his music's heart. His suspicion is confirmed during a performance of his hit song, \"Where the Sidewalk Ends.\" Dusty intentionally omits several bars of the song, only to find that his fans do not notice. Disheartened, he cuts the performance short, leaving the stage amidst a cacophony of cheers and applause that seem oddly hollow.\n\nSome concert sequences were filmed at Fort Worth, Texas's historic Will Rogers Coliseum. Located less than three miles from Fort Worth's bustling Downtown District, the Will Rogers Memorial Center is a 120-acre multipurpose facility known for hosting various events, including equestrian, agricultural, entertainment, corporate, educational, social, and sporting events. The venue's grandeur and history add authenticity to the scenes, reflecting the scale of Dusty's fame and the spectacle that his performances have become.\n\nTo visit this coliseum, make your way to the cultural district in Fort Worth, Texas. Situated near downtown Fort Worth, the Will Rogers Memorial Center is easily accessible by car, with just a short 10-minute drive or a leisurely one-hour stroll alongside the picturesque Fort Worth Botanic Garden.\n\nDusty decides to take an indefinite break from his life as a country music superstar. Without informing his manager, Lula (Lesley Ann Warren), Dusty waits for his truck and hitches a ride. He then shaves his beard and cuts off his ponytail, symbolically shedding the trappings of his fame.\n\nThis transformative scene takes place in downtown Maypearl, Texas. This quaint town, incorporated in 1914, is primarily known for farming and stock-raising. Despite its small size, Maypearl offers a rich, authentic atmosphere that perfectly encapsulates Dusty's longing for a simpler life away from the spotlight. It is here that Dusty finds a barber shop, where he drastically changes his appearance to blend in with the townsfolk.\n\nWhile the exact location of the barbershop within Maypearl isn't specified, fans of the movie can explore the town's downtown area to get a feel of the setting. The town itself is south of the Dallas / Ft. Worth area, making it easily accessible for those visiting Texas. Visitors can take the I-35E S from Dallas or Fort Worth, then continue on FM 66 W to Maypearl.\n\nA poignant scene unfolds as Dusty visits Cresson Cemetery. The ambiance is serene, with calming music playing in the background, underscoring Dusty's quiet contemplation. He stands next to the graves of his parents, immersing himself in a moment of reflection and memory.\n\nThis emotionally charged scene was filmed at Cresson Cemetery in Cresson, Texas. This is the same cemetery where Dusty, in the film's narrative, walks through after leaving his grandmother's house. However, the headstone bearing the inscription \"Chandler\", which signifies the resting place of Dusty's parents in the movie, was merely a prop. In reality, there is no \"Chandler\" stone in this cemetery. The prop was placed just to the right of a stone marked \"Crook.\" The graveyard still looks the same as in the movie, so fans will be excited to visit the iconic location.\n\nCresson is located roughly 26 miles southwest of Fort Worth, Texas. To get there from Fort Worth, you would typically take US-377 S. Please remember to respect the sanctity of the location as it is an active cemetery.\n\nDusty later visits a bar where he and his friend Earl (John Doe) used to play before they hit the big time. Dusty immerses himself in the familiar surroundings, soaking up the nostalgia. As the evening progresses, he encounters Harley Tucker (Isabel Glasser), who dances and smiles at him. Tension arises when Al (Mark Walters), Harley's rough-and-tumble drunk friend, picks a fight in the parking lot over Dusty, whom neither Al nor Harley has ever met before.\n\nThis notable scene was filmed at the Western Kountry Klub, which was transformed into the Prairie Rose Dance Hall for the movie. The club, situated between Midlothian and Mansfield, Texas, also served as the backdrop for several other scenes in the film, including the 'drunk as a skunk' altercation in the parking lot.\n\nFans of Pure Country can still visit the Western Kountry Klub, which remains operational today. This classic venue offers a spacious dance floor and maintains its old-school charm, making it an excellent spot for some family-friendly honky-tonkin'. And as a bonus, you can proudly tell folks that you've danced where George Strait danced in the movie.\n\nTo reach Western Kountry Klub from Dallas, start by heading south on US-67 S. Then, take the exit towards US-287 N/Fort Worth. Follow US-287 N until you reach Lakeview Dr in Grand Prairie. The final destination will be on the left side. Please note that there is no public transportation available from Dallas.\n\nDusty takes a break from his superstar life and stays at a ranch. Here, he pays for room and board while learning the ropes of ranch life, quite literally, as he takes roping lessons. These experiences earn him the respect of Harley's father, Ernest (Rory Calhoun). In a heartfelt moment, Ernest confides in Dusty about his financial struggles, forcing him to sell pieces of the ranch slowly.\n\nThese meaningful scenes were filmed at the Tucker Ranch. The ranch served as the backdrop for the roping scenes, riding scenes, and Dusty's second fight with Al, the cowboy who kept pestering Harley. An iconic windmill used to stand between the barn and the top of the silo, adding to the authenticity of the ranch setting.\n\nDespite its prominence in the film, the Tucker Ranch is located on private property and is not open to the public. Any fans wishing to visit must obtain permission before venturing onto the property. Please note that public transportation is not available in the area.\n\nIn a covert move, Lula arranges for Harley and her family to attend Dusty's concert. After they are seated, she sends a staff member to fetch Harley and confesses the truth to her. Upholding his desire, Dusty performs the show without the usual smoke and lights. Sitting on the edge of the stage, he strums his guitar and serenades Harley with \"I Cross My Heart,\" a heartfelt ballad he has written especially for her. This tender gesture earns him Harley's forgiveness. The scene concludes with an emotional embrace between the two at the edge of the stage.\n\nThis scene was filmed at The Mirage, a resort and casino on the Las Vegas Strip. Opened on November 22, 1989, The Mirage was once the world's most expensive resort. It is known for its various attractions, including an artificial volcano that erupts nightly, providing free entertainment for passersby and guests. In 1990, the Mirage became the captivating venue for Siegfried & Roy's mesmerizing magic show, enthralling audiences for nearly 14 unforgettable years.\n\nFans of Pure Country can easily visit the iconic location where this scene was shot. The Mirage continues to operate as a hotel and casino, and visitors can experience the same vibrant atmosphere that was captured in the film. Depending on the schedule, fans might even have the opportunity to attend a concert at the same venue where Dusty Chandler graced the stage.\n\nYou have a few options to reach The Mirage from McCarran International Airport in Las Vegas. You can opt for a convenient taxi ride or consider renting a car for your convenience. The journey typically takes around 15 minutes by car or hotel transfer. Alternatively, you can also explore public transportation with a transfer from the city center."
