        "text": "You may wonder why your house seems to have a thin film of dust covering its surfaces mere hours after you’ve dusted it from top to bottom. What causes houses to become so dusty anyway?\n\nIt might surprise you to learn that there are actually several reasons why houses get dusty, from the way you dust to perhaps even your own HVAC system.\n\nAir Duct Issues\n\nOne of the reasons you may have so much dust in your home could be due to an issue with your air ducts. If your ducts are wearing out and have holes in them or are coming apart, this can cause dust to build up within them and then circulate throughout your home when your HVAC system comes on.\n\nA good way to test this theory is to keep an eye on your dust situation after your furnace or air conditioner turns off. If you notice the dust level increasing, then you may need to hire a professional to come in and clean your ducts up for you. At Ambient Edge, we conduct a pressure test to determine how well your ducts are operating, then we can either conduct replacements or air duct repair in Paradise, NV.\n\nAir Filter Issues\n\nIf you’re not already keeping up with the air filters in your air conditioner and/or furnace, then you need to make this a priority. Not only will a clean filter help your HVAC system run more efficiently, but it will also cut down on the amount of dust that circulates around your home.\n\nYou should clean your filters often until they are no longer as effective, in which case you’ll need to replace them. Generally, this is every 90 days or so, but if you have pets you should replace them every 60.\n\nIf you find this too much of a hassle to keep up with on your own, you can sign up for preventive maintenance with Ambient Edge, and let us worry about your filters for you!\n\nThe Act of Dusting\n\nWhen some people dust, they end up moving the dust around, rather than removing it. For instance, if you use a feather duster to dust off your entertainment center, then you’re simply pushing the dust off and into the carpet, which you will then kick up later on and it will end up right back on the entertainment system again, among other places.\n\nTo dust more efficiently, you can use a microfiber cloth, which grabs dust like a magnet to ensure it does not simply push off a surface and recirculate around your home. Else, you can use a damp rag to trap the dust. Don’t use a dry rag, as this is less productive and does not trap the dust very well, if at all.\n\nYou should also dust your home, quite literally, from top to bottom so that you’re not covering items with dust like you would if you dusted upwards. And don’t forget the walls, which also get dusty – something many folks don’t realize. All you need to do is wipe them down once a month with a damp rag.\n\nVacuuming\n\nBelieve it or not, vacuuming your carpets can actually make your dust problems worse. Have you ever noticed your allergen-sensitive spouse sneezing like crazy after you vacuum? How is that possible – you just cleaned everything!\n\nIn fact, both the vacuum and the act of vacuuming can release allergens into the air. Vacuuming doesn’t suck up those allergens that remain suspended in the air, so once you’re done vacuuming, they simply settle back down into the carpet to be released again, or onto other surfaces, leading to a dust buildup.\n\nThere are two ways to combat this. If money is no issue, you may want to switch to hardwood floors. However, for most folks, it makes more sense to simply invest in a HEPA-approved filter for the vacuum. This filter will trap more allergens before they have the chance to release back into the air.\n\nA Dry House\n\nYou may have a dust buildup in your home because the air in your home is too dry. If the humidity in your home is below 40%, then your air is probably too dry. How does this create more dust, you may ask? Dry air causes fabric, animals, and even you (dry skin) to shed more particles that ultimately end up in your air and on surfaces in your home.\n\nYou have a few ways with which you can moisten up the air in your home. You can invest in a humidifier, or you can reduce the amount of time your air conditioner and/or heater run. Switching to fans or opening windows more often can cause a significant change in the quality of your indoor air in a variety of ways.\n\nThink Your HVAC System May Be the Source of Your Dust Issues?
