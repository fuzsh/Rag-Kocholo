The crime is temporarily delayed by the maid. Dusty and Nobby find a diamond brooch in the bin outside the property. They enter the building to return it just as the owner, Miss Duncan, returns. This allows Dusty to meet Lobelia, the maid. He asks her out to the pictures.\n\nInstead of cash, Miss Duncan gives them a book on the philosophy of Diogenes as a reward. This is the same book which the couple were trying to steal. An American is seeking the book offering $5000 (£500).\n\nNobby's son Derek takes it to a bookseller as part of a bundle of old books which need to be in groups of six. Thinking it is a valuable book, Nobby and Dusty break into the bookseller's to retrieve it.\n\nThey have to thwart the attempts of some criminals to con them out of it. Mrs Lincoln eventually finds them and gives them £500 for the book. However, it is revealed that the American seeks volume 1 and they had volume 2 which is worthless.\n\nVolume 2 is tracked and they rush to the airport to get the American the copy just in time. He writes a cheque for more money.\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nBill Owen as \"Dusty\" Grey\n\nJoy Nichols as Lobelia, Miss Duncan's maid\n\nLeslie Dwyer as Nobby Clarke\n\nHarold Berens as Driver\n\nRoddy Hughes as J.C.

It is a remake of a 1936 film of the same title which was also directed by Maclean Rogers. Wally Patch, who had written and starred in the earlier film, appears in a small role in the remake.\n\nCritical reception\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Monthly Film Bulletin wrote: \"Rather laboured comedy, depressingly laced with topical gags. Joy Nichols sings pleasantly. Id\"[3]\n\nIn British Sound Films: The Studio Years 1928–1959 David Quinlan rated the film as \"mediocre\", writing: \"Remake of 1936 film of thr same title, brought up to date in rather laboured fashion.\"[4]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
