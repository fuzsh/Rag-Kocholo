        "text": ".\n\nDirector: Roger Corman\n\nScreenwriters: Lou Rusoff / Lou Rusoff, Charles B. Griffith (uncredited)\n\nBy Roderick Heath\n\nIn memoriam: Roger Corman 1926-2024\n\nI started writing this to give more appreciation to Corman before it was too late; then, mid-writing, it was too late. In any event, this is the first of a two-part look at some of my favourite Corman films of his pre-1960 phase.\n\nThe first five years of Roger Corman’s directing career saw him direct twenty-five feature films, a frenzy of creative zeal mixed with mercenary cool practically without comparison for productivity or richness in the history of cinema. In 1960 Corman released two movies that garnered him a sudden upswing in attention and respect, if not exactly respectability: The Little Shop of Horrors, a movie that was, like most of the films he had made up until then, incredibly cheap and filmed quickly in black-and-white, and House of Usher, a lush colour horror movie made on a comparatively munificent budget. The Little Shop of Horrors played at the Cannes Film Festival, and House of Usher kicked off a series of films adapted from Edgar Allan Poe and H.P. Lovecraft that remain, today, his best-known and most-loved works. It’s comparatively easy to celebrate Corman as a director for his later work – other entries in the Poe-Lovecraft series, also including Pit and the Pendulum (1961), The Haunted Palace (1963), and The Masque of the Red Death (1964), his variably mythic and surreal counterculture exploitation excursions like The Wild Angels (1966), The Trip (1967), and Gas, or, How It Was Necessary to Destroy the World in Order to Save It (1970), and his thematically and directorially ambitious historical films, The St. Valentine’s Day Massacre (1967), Bloody Mama (1970), and Von Richthofen and Brown (1971).\n\nBy contrast, the fruits of those first five years have long attracted two entwined but also sharply distinct kinds of appreciation: viewers and critics genuinely fascinated by the particular kind of ingenuity and eccentric verve Corman and his team of regular collaborators exhibited, and those seeking immersion in the pantomime delights of Corman’s tacky monsters, makeshift sets, and other threadbare wonders. Here is where truly advanced Corman studies await. Those films range from strange masterpieces to a couple that are indeed pretty bad, but are all interesting – an array of stark, smart, ideogram-like variations on the essential stuff of genre cinemagoing, often delivered to meet whatever genre vogue there was going on, but shot through with perverse speculative interest, radicalism in theme and humour, and theatre-of-the-mind invention. Corman didn’t just prove you could make a movie about the end of the world on a budget that would hardly cover the catering on a big movie, but, perhaps, could and should only be done that way, with scope and scene reduced to a handful of players clinging on to the edge of the world – subject matter and setting mimicking Corman’s place in the Hollywood scheme of things. In that he proved, at long last, the ablest survivor. Corman successfully defined a version of commercial cinema that could subsist beneath the superstructure of expensive spectacle, a version that would split and veer off into many streams.\n\nCorman’s factory-line approach to turning out movies could well be traced back to the place of his birth, Detroit, and his initial choice to train as an engineer, in trying to follow his father, after the family moved to California. Corman served in the US Navy through the end of World War II before finishing a degree in industrial engineering at Stanford. After a brief attempt to work in a car manufacturing plant, Corman realised this was not his metier. His older brother Gene was already working as an agent in the film world, and Corman decided to follow him. His first display of his defining independent streak and dislike for the big Hollywood studios would emerge when he quit working for Twentieth Century Fox after not getting any credit for coming up with the idea behind Henry King’s The Gunfighter (1950), and became a student again, using the GI Bill to study English at Oxford before returning to Los Angeles and working for a literary agent whilst thrashing out scripts. One he wrote became Highway Dragnet (1954), a movie he also signed on to serve as an associate producer for no pay, purely to get experience. Corman immediately ploughed the money he got for the script and more he borrowed from contacts, adding up to about $12,000, into his first foray as full producer, Monster from the Ocean Floor (1954).\n\nThis gambit proved sufficiently successful for Corman to quickly produce another, The Fast and the Furious (1955), which Corman wrote as well and was directed by its star, John Ireland, alongside Edward Sampson. Despite receiving interested offers from well-established players, Corman sold the movie to American Releasing Company, a recently founded by the two entrepreneurial impresarios, James H. Nicholson and Samuel Z. Arkoff, as they offered Corman the chance to immediately make more movies. Corman kicked off his official directing career with his next project, Five Guns West (1955), a modest, mostly conventional, solidly-handled Western: Corman was still not yet thirty years old. Corman’s loyalties as a movie aficionado were perhaps most clearly signalled in his early work by the relatively straight-laced approach he usually took with the Westerns and gangster movies he made, but he began introducing twists, like the warring female antagonists of Gunslinger (1956), and the fascination with criminal psychology as a house of cards introduced in Day The World Ended and developed in Machine-Gun Kelly (1958) through to Bloody Mama. Corman later described The Intruder (1962) as his one stab at a message movie and his only flop, but Corman’s edge of social critique and humanist concern was percolating from the start, like the confrontation with racism often elided in Westerns in Apache Woman (1955). Gunslinger also proved fateful for Corman as it was his first time working with screenwriter Charles B. Griffiths, who would write many of Corman’s films in the next few years.\n\nSome were crime sagas, some teen flicks, others monster movies, a neat cross-section of the era’s popular fare. Still, Corman sometimes found himself starting trends rather than chasing them. The Undead (1957), a truly original and odd melange of horror, science fiction, and fantasy, emerged right at the cusp of a resurgence for horror cinema, whilst the trilogy of burlesques A Bucket of Blood (1959), The Little Shop of Horrors, and The Creature From The Haunted Sea (1961), helped birth the 1960s style of hip, pop art-inflected satirical comedy – particularly the latter, which came well before the likes of Dr. Strangelove, or, How I Learned To Stop Worrying and Love The Bomb (1964) and A Hard Day’s Night (1964) in transposing the aesthetics of stand-up comedy and MAD Magazine to the movie screen. Corman would later become most celebrated for the sheer number of future major Hollywood figures to gain major early career boosts from working with him. More immediately, Corman assembled a cadre of collaborators behind the camera and in front, employed across many movies. Some major if aging stars like Vincent Price, Boris Karloff, Peter Lorre, and Ray Milland would pass through his orbit, and stars on the rise, particularly Jack Nicholson and Charles Bronson, but also including Peter Graves, Lee Van Cleef, Mike ‘Touch’ Connors, and Robert Vaughan. But it was Corman’s corps of regular players whose faces become like old pals, among them Jonathan Haze, Dick Miller, Susan Cabot, Beverly Garland, Allison Hayes, Abby Dalton, Mel Welles, Dorothy Neumann, Barboura Morris, Richard Devon, Richard Garland, Bruno Ve Sota, and Mike Forrest.\n\nOne of the peculiar truths Corman stumbled upon, one he’d later explain to one of the young, blow-in talents looking to him for backing, a lad named Martin Scorsese, was that if you hit the right beats for pleasing the market being aimed for in his hemisphere of the filmmaking business, you could basically make any movie you wanted in between. Corman had already proved this often, and some of his best, most peculiar work exists in arguably his least-appreciated, most ephemeral movies-as-product, the ones he made to get in on the rock ‘n’ roll craze: movies like Rock All Night (1957) and Carnival Rock (1957) toss in a couple of numbers by some hit parade acts in scripts that otherwise dabble in postmodern farce and operatic tragedy, explorations of the absurd underside of show business and its players, and its connection with the vast American demimonde, the appetites serviced and personal fantasies given realisation, but built not down from the airy clouds of most Hollywood product, but from the stanchions of the street up. From almost the beginning, too, Corman had experimented with blending genre modes in a way that annexed the postmodern. It’s tempting to call Day The World Ended, Corman’s fourth film as a director, the wellspring of his oeuvre as his first movie in a fantastical genre and the one that really got things moving when it proved extremely profitable, making upwards of $1,000,000 from a budget of $96,000 and a shoot that lasted ten days.\n\nIn another sense, however, Day The World Ended stems directly from Five Guns West in focusing on a small, motley band adrift in a hostile landscape. From the Old West to the new: a high mountain abode at the fringes of what was civilisation, suddenly the only recourse for a small group of survivors of nuclear apocalypse. The script was written, as several of his early films would be, by Arkoff’s brother-in-law Lou Rusoff. Nepotism helps keep costs down, but Rusoff was also a sober, canny screenwriter, and he proved the first to invest Corman’s oeuvre with the trait that helped it to stand out, good writing and acting even in the most straitened circumstances. “Our story begins with….THE END!” announces the opening title card; its partner right at the end of the movie is, of course, “THE BEGINNING.” Corman would return to that idea with a more radical angle on Teenage Caveman (1958). “THE END!” is a mushroom cloud boiling up into the atmosphere. Atomic war has broken out, the world’s cities have been pummelled, and radioactive death is spreading across the world. Faux-Biblical scripture booms out over churning clouds. A narrator intones over shots of ruined buildings, “This is TD Day – Total Destruction by Nuclear Weapons…Man has done his best to destroy himself.” A gnarled and filthy figure gropes his way out of surging smoke and steam and stumbles down a slope before collapsing, revealing the stigmata of radiation poisoning blooming on his face. This is the edge of Corman’s little world, the pocket of normality left by the apocalypse, floating on an island of reality, the B-movie rough draft for Solaris (1972).\n\nCorman signals John Huston as a particular touchstone in Day The World Ended, borrowing the coot prospector from The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (1948) and from Key Largo (1948) the surly gangster with might-makes-right attitude and his brassy, mistreated moll at his side, as well as the theme of siege and of nerves being ridden like a merry-go-round. Day The World Ended is however more a sci-fi redraft of Frank Capra’s Lost Horizon (1937) – a fantasy of seclusion unfolding in a mountain retreat protected by walls of stone, left delicately untouched by the churning storms without, with a mystic pool of purity at its heart where the maidens swim, and where the disruption in the tenuously balanced Eden comes from those who cannot let go of the world that was. Corman’s fondness for that source was signalled decades later when he acted in a short film directed by his daughter built around its mystique. Day The World Ended is also inflected with a brand of meta-textual play that would recur throughout Corman’s career, in the characters-in-search-of-an-author eccentricity of Rock All Night, The Little Shop of Horrors, and Creature From The Haunted Sea, and hit an apotheosis with Gas, or, How It Was Necessary To Destroy The World In Order To Save It, which would also provide the ultimate self-deconstruction of Day The World Ended’s titular thesis, tales where Corman confronts characters and dramatic modes usually kept apart.\n\nDay The World Ended is still circumspect in that regard but the borrowings and tropes are fed into a supercollider, as Corman gropes towards discovering his compulsive themes and essential business model. The trash auteur who’d studied English at Oxford gives the game away by prominently featuring the Tragedy and Comedy masks on the wall of home that constitutes the bulk of the film’s setting, and even makes their presence the butt of a ruthless visual joke, as he zeroes in on a heroine trying to cheer everyone only to move as she dissolves in tears, the Comedy mask kept sarcastically in the frame. The bedraggled and irradiated survivor is Radek (Paul Dubov); shortly after geologist Rick (Richard Denning) arrives by the same path and finds Radek collapsed and seemingly dying. A little further along the ridge, gangster Tony (Connors) and his burlesque dancer girlfriend Ruby (Adele Jergens) also arrive at the fringe of the poisoned clouds in a car, and look down the slope into the mountain valley where a single, modernist-style house stands. The house belongs to Jim Maddison (Paul Birch), a retired US Navy Commander who chose the locale to live in precisely because he anticipated nuclear war and sought out a local where there was a chance of remaining safe from clouds of radioactive fallout: as well as high and remote, the mountains around the valley are filled with lead, and the house is well-stocked with provisions and fuel.\n\nMaddison lives with daughter Louise (Lori Nelson), who had called her fiancé to retreat to the house with them when it became clear war was going to break out, but he never showed up. At first Maddison wants to fight off the new arrivals because their presence would swiftly exhaust their stockpiles, a stance that seems all the more justified when Tony uses a pistol to shoot off the lock on the front door, but Louise demands her father open the house to them. Rick arrives shortly after, carrying Radek, and Maddison checks Radek with a Geiger counter, finding he’s badly irradiated. Tony’s initial intention to seize control of the situation by brandishing his gun is foiled by Rick, who surprises him with a powerful punch and disarms him. A final survivor arrives, this one descending from the mountains above: Pete (Raymond Hatton), aged gold prospector with a mule he calls Diablo. Pete claims to have just found the gold seam he’s searched for; Pete has big deals going down in his intended destination, the now non-existent San Francisco. Corman’s debriefing of the different eras and ideals of American life, pack mule to car to atom bomb to mutant, but the search for gold goes on. Despite his misgivings, Maddison quickly advises his guests to wash off with bottled water and sets about arranging the house for them. As in a fairy-tale, the clean water is the prize above all.\n\nScience fiction films of the 1950s often dealt in veiled or slightly metaphorical ways with the new reality of the atomic age. Arch Oboler’s Five (1951), a likely immediate influence on Corman and Rusoff, proposed a similar tale of a handful of survivors holed up in a large, modern house after such a war and arguing through what world they would build after, but avoided dealing directly with the realities of nuclear war. Other films had dealt with what-if scenarios about sudden cataclysms disrupting and even ending human civilisation, like Deluge (1933), Le Fin du Monde (1933), and When Worlds Collide (1952). And still more had envisioned the shock of the new and threat of the next through monstrous figurations, as mutant atomic monsters started stalking across movie screens, from Them! (1954) to Godzilla (1954). But Day The World Ended synthesised all those influences and more, and created a new subgenre: the post-apocalyptic drama, and children run as wayward as Planet of the Apes (1968), The Omega Man (1971), Mad Max (1979), and The Matrix (1999), all dealing in different ways with the same basic proposition of a post-nuclear landscape becoming as strange, teeming, brutal, transformation-riddled, and dreamlike as Greek mythology. Its DNA could also be said to inflect the entire realm of American independent film, an idea that barely existed when Corman began, but his template of making virtues out of scarcity and constructing elemental situations became its backbone: Corman, for instance, gifted the basic template to Monte Hellman for his debut The Beast From Haunted Cave (1959), and Hellman passed on the influence through his own cinema. Wim Wenders, whose Paris, Texas (1984) describes an American landscape as alien, arid, and depopulated as Corman’s, paid it puckish tribute in his The State of Things (1983), a film about a wayward attempt to remake Corman’s film.\n\nThe tiny cadre of survivors settle down to try and outlast the fallout before they exhaust their supplies. The situation is complicated as Radek, who everyone expects to die, instead clings on to life, but seems to need no food or water. Instead, he goes out of the house at night and devours wildlife that should be inedible, contaminated as all the animals are. One night, about to consume a snared rabbit, Radek sees a strange, gnarled figure looming out of the darkness and shrubbery at the valley fringe, and flees in fear. Meanwhile Tony stews with increasing frustration as he fixates on Louise, spurning Ruby and looking for a chance of gaining the upper hand over everyone. Maddison is worried that seasonal rains might dump radioactive water on the valley, spelling their doom, but for the time being a spring-fed pond provides fresh water and a place to swim. Having a dip there one day with Ruby, Louise experiences the peculiar feeling not just of being watched but of something trying to communicate with her on some inchoate level. Eventually Radek steals away Diablo the donkey and eats him, only for the lurking being to attack and kill him: the being is a mutant, a swiftly evolved response to the new radiation-soaked Earth beyond the valley, but one that still seeks what it can only find there. The distraught Pete, after finding Diablo dead, tries to climb back into the mountains but drops dead from radiation poisoning. Maddison, trying to chase him down, also receives a dangerous dose and barely makes it back to the house. Finally the mutant dares to try and snatch Louise away, whilst Tony takes advantage of Maddison’s prostration to steal his gun and plan Rick’s murder.\n\nThe valley and the house are Corman’s Forest of Arden, his Prospero’s Island, realised in a fashion that sustains a tradition to back when Shakespeare’s players only needed to hang up a sign announcing the scene was a forest. The immune Eden encompasses the possibilities of what the world looks like boiled down to a basic dichotomy: communal selflessness versus will to power. That dichotomy, as reports transmit from the mystic mutant zone from beyond the protecting ridge suggests, is solved in favour of raw strength – Corman’s regressing version of the apes-around-the-waterhole scenes of 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968). The basic object of all effort is Louise, the young, unsullied mother of the future – paging another Corman acolyte, James Cameron, and his The Terminator (1984) – and who will be her mate. The three immediately vying candidates are Rick, Tony, and the mutant; Ruby, despite being only a little bit older than Louise, is nonetheless discounted, hated by Tony as the emblem of what he was forced, in his way of thinking and seeing, to settle for. Maddison is the canny prototype of a survivalist, and also an emblem of paternal authority: the island of refuge is his discovery, his construction, and despite his own misgivings and sense he tolerates his gate-crashers. Maddison is also keeper of forbidden lore: as a Navy captain he witnessed the results of atomic bomb tests, animals deliberately exposed to the fallout. Most died, but a handful mutated rapidly to weather the new climate, gaining new, tough, crusty skin and horns on the head – and in the case of a monkey, a third eye and wicked claws.\n\nThis finds its alarming rhyme when another badly irradiated and disfigured man (Jonathan Haze) tumbles into the valley. Rick and Maddison recognise his gnarled skin and changed features as resembling the test animals, and Rick realises that Radek and this man are both stages in a continuum of mutation, of which the ultimate and perfect example is the mutant stalking the valley. The man quickly dies from starvation after reporting the formation of a community of mutants, who are stronger than him and so claim all the food. When Rick tracks Radek and asks up him what he sees when he goes back over the ridge, Radek reports, “There’s wonderful things happening,” but also mentions that he has “an enemy.” As if already tuned into the wavelength of where imagination would drift in the post-World War II era, Corman conceives of the chimera produced by the atomic age as a neo-hobgoblin with the third eye of Buddhist lore and psychic powers. These transmit on levels only Louise can pick up and that only registering on the level of sensation rather than thought, flesh and sex threatening to break and reform in strange, grotesque patterns – anticipating the proto-Cronenbergian warpings of The Haunted Palace, Corman’s great blueprint for modern body horror, in particular. In a cheeky touch, Corman includes himself as Louise’s fiancé in the framed photo she keeps and discards at film’s end, whilst it’s very faintly suggested the mutant might in fact be Louise’s fiancé, radically transformed. Playing the mutant is Paul Blaisdell, a specialist in creating masks, models, and suits, who found himself the go-to man for Corman and other makes of low-budget creature features like Edward L. Cahn throughout the late 1950s.\n\nOne of Corman’s recurring, even obsessive themes in his early movies was a fascination with defining the difference between the genuinely tough, brave, hardy, streetwise, what have you, and the merely posturing, the macho, and the maniacal. It’s a question he likely figured a vast number in his audience would respond to: many of Corman’s heroes are literal and figurative little guys who prove braver and more resilient than the hulks and he-men. He’d revisit this in terms comedic (Rock All Night), revisionist of classical myth (The Saga of the Viking Women and Their Voyage to the Waters of the Great Sea Serpent, 1957), and socially conscientious (The Intruder, when the Rick-Tony figuration is inverted and recast as the racist rabblerouser and righteous plebeian hero). The variation is straightforward in Day The World Ended, with the intelligent but still potent Rick contends with Tony, or, as they’re called at different points in the movie, “Mr All-American Hero” and “Mr Heel.” Tony is the embodiment of primeval virtue, for whom civilisation is a perpetual stymie: even in the refuge he’s only held at by Maddison who carries a gun and the key to the storeroom. Rick is at once an ideal hero but also the fallen version of something worthier, pressganged stand-in for Louise’s fiancé whilst mourning his brother, who was “studying for the ministry,” but the world needs a saviour of the flesh, not the spirit. He is, nonetheless, still two-fisted, besting Tony in their two stand-up fights. The seething, acquisitive, self-congratulatory hard-knock student Tony, declares that when he repopulates the Earth with his progeny, “They’ll be tough!” The end of the world and the reduction of the human race to a handful only winnows Tony’s feelings of frustrated strength and need down to the perfect version.\n\nMaddison, realising that survival might just be possible, lobbies for Louise to marry Rick and have children, appointing himself as the equivalent of a ship’s captain with emergency clerical powers. This all seems amusingly prim given the situation portrayed, as too is Louise and Ruby swimming together in swimsuits that wouldn’t get a deacon bothered, but the censor doth sleep no less than the atomic mutant. The dichotomy of the two female archetypes is very different to the men, signalling another quality that would distinguish Corman at the time: his female characters were a cut far above where the vast bulk of Hollywood cinema was, and sometimes still feel radical. Here basic presumptions are still in play: Louise is the “nice” girl, so prudishly dressed it borders on the satiric (like the entirely swathing nightgown she wears in the climax) versus Ruby the sexy dame. And yet Ruby is Corman’s truest figure of empathy, victim of a particular kind of misogyny not ended with the old world but perhaps only, again, rendered to pure form, as she finds herself the inferior candidate for mating and propagation. She gets along best with Pete, who she sneaks pilfered sugar to make moonshine with, watches Louise’s back, and tries to maintain Tony’s last tethers to human decency. Ruby kicks up her heels and amuses her companions by recreating her old burlesque act: “They’d give me the blue spot and then I’d give them the clincher!” she recalls with the glee of someone who’s held the eyes and groins of an audience enthralled, enacting the role of sexual a form of power and exaltation that played to a world vanished but could, in a genuinely revivified world, be powerful and beneficent. Ruby is however doomed by alternations of love and hate for her ratbag boyfriend, enacted in quick and deadly manner when she saves Louise from being raped by Tony and makes a last, desperate appeal to Tony: “What are we fighting for? We’re like a couple of kids!”, only to turn homicidally enraged when Tony spurns her: trying to stab him, Ruby instead ends up with Tony shoving the knife in her own gut, and in a startling vision of misogynist disdain, he drops her corpse over the edge of a cliff with a wiseguy kiss-off that could come right out of Raymond Chandler: “Happy landings, sweetheart.”\n\nCorman’s concise, waste-free technique contends expertly with the limited settings, as when he uses the prostrate Maddison on the couch that bisects his living room as a compositional element to complicate the space and staging, and his steady editing rhythm invisibly breaking up what is in effect a dialogue-driven chamber piece. Later Corman would know that his audience at least partly showed up to see the cheap monsters, but for the moment he makes the mutant’s first appearance a cleverly elusive, even hallucinatory moment, the creature hovering slightly out of focus in the distance, Radek looking on from the foreground. The “wonderful things” hover in the stygian mist all around, at least until the Biblically cleansing rain starts to fall. The mutant’s attempt to abduct Louise is foiled when it proves terrified of the water of the spring, and Louise manages to wriggle free and take refuge in the pool. The rain that starts falling proves to not be irradiated but instead start washes the fallout away. Representing as it does a sudden evolutionary leap to contend with a poisoned world, clean water is ironically toxic to the pathetic mutant, which dies, its corpse smoking in the downpour: Rick and Louise deduce the reason for its death and know this means other mutants won’t survive the rain either. Meanwhile Tony manages to snatch up the pistol Maddison keeps close and immediately plans to gun Rick down when he and Louise return, but he doesn’t know Rick gave Maddison another pistol for extra security, and when he realises there’s no other choice Maddison kills Tony. Maddison finally dies and Louise and Rick finally leave the valley together, with a closing note that might be just a tad excessively optimistic, but certainly fulfils the film’s parable-like form.\n\nBy the standards of Corman’s first phase, Day The World Ended is a leisurely affair at 80 minutes long – if he’d made it couple of years later it would likely have been ten to fifteen minutes shorter. It also follows suit with a lot of ‘50s sci-fi cinema in invoking religious overtones, at a time when to sell to a large audience many dabbling in the genre assumed there had to be some kind of parochial moral to what was being portrayed. This was something Corman would quickly dispense with when he realised his young audience, watching from their cars in the drive-ins between make-out sessions, didn’t really want or like. By contrast, when the moral of the story is summarised at the end of Corman’s follow-up monster movie, It Conquered The World, it’s couched entirely in terms of human qualities and potentials, distinguishing their emotional reflexes from the cold, calculating alien whose lack of feeling indicates a species without any feel for, or interest in, communal care. Rusoff wrote the script for It Conquered The World again, although Corman had Griffith give it an uncredited polish, and indeed the writing has the feel of Griffith’s involvement in the headier dialogue and quirkier humour. Again, Corman is doing the utmost with next to nothing, although now the settings stretch to a couple of different houses and interior sets, a world where famous scientists subsist in California bungalows and army bases are safely represented by some wire fencing.\n\nIt Conquered The World was the first film released under American Releasing Corporation’s new, more ambitious name of American International Pictures. This time Blaisdell was given few hundred dollars to build the monster that was to be the movie’s main attraction. Corman later, wryly commented that it taught him that movie monster shouldn’t be shorter than the leading lady, and that lady herself, Beverly Garland, reportedly snorted on seeing the creature, “That conquered the world?” The Venusian is indeed pretty blatant in its stiff articulation and rubbery stature, but is also amongst the most memorably designed and iconic of movie monsters, vaguely resembling an ambulating upturned radish with a skirting fringe of scuttling claws, two waving, pincer-capped arms, glow-in-the-dark eyes, and face twisted into a permanent evil leer. It Conquered The World gets in on the run of mid-1950s movies about alien possession and suborning with its theme of an alien invader who starts using creepy little bat-like creatures to fly around and implant control devices in chosen recipients, turning them into slaves.\n\nAnother of Corman’s recurring preoccupations emerges here, in the figure of the intelligent and inquisitive being whose private moral schemes lead them in a radically different direction to the society about them, which they consider themselves above or fatefully at odds with. Corman would later take that figure to a conceptual limit in The Masque of the Red Death’s Prince Prospero, who devoted to evil as an ethic, and Bloody Mama’s titular matriarch. Here the equivalent is Lee Van Cleef’s Dr Tom Anderson, a brilliant physicist who has nonetheless alienated himself from authorities with his impassioned antiwar activism and bizarre predictions, including theories about life on other planets being provoked by human emergence into space. Tom is first glimpsed lobbying US Defense Secretary Platt (Marshal Bradford) and General Carpenter (David McMahon) in a desperate effort to get an army-run project trying to launch satellites into space cancelled: “We’re all in a state of high hilarity,” Tom comments sardonically when the honchoes denies he’s been worrying them, “And we’ll all end up in a state of high mortality if you don’t call off this satellite project.”\n\nMeanwhile Anderson’s close friend and former colleague Dr Paul Nelson (Peter Graves) is running the project with his own, more orthodox genius and sense of duty to the fore. His team of scientists and technicians includes Dr Ellen Peters (Karyne Kadler) and Dr Pete Shelton (Griffith), and they’re trying to finally get a satellite into orbit after several failures. “I hear that satellite cost us nine million bucks,” one of the team notes, to another’s quip: “It’d be just great if she sideswiped an airliner.” Tom and Paul and their wives Claire Anderson (Garland) and Joan Nelson (Sally Fraser) have dinner together at the Andersons’ house, where Paul gets the feeling Tom is peculiarly smug about his latest satellite launch. Tom responds by showing Paul a shortwave radio setup in his living room, and lets Paul listen to a peculiar throbbing noise coming in over it, a noise that Tom says is actually the voice of an alien being he’s made contact with, one of a circle of nine, immensely advanced beings living on Venus. What Tom doesn’t tell his friend yet is that he’s been paving the way for the alien to come to Earth: Tom has given the alien information about the personnel of the project base and who exactly it needs to take control of amidst the local population in order to seize all the levers of authority. Tom’s reasons for helping the creature emerge quickly: Tom believes the alien will benignly apply its greater intelligence and will on the human race, finally cure it of warlike impulses and set the species on the path to noble betterment, a world where a man like Tom will finally be hailed as a noble visionary rather than a brilliant crank. The alien’s spacecraft crash-lands after encountering the satellite Paul’s team launched, but the alien survives and takes up residence in a cave system near the project base. The alien sends out a number of small, bat-like flying creatures to track down those selected to be controlled, including Paul and his fellow scientists on the project as well as its military overseer, General Pattick (Russ Bender), and the Sheriff of the nearby town, Shallert (Taggart Casey), as well as Joan and other wives, as Tom has told the alien they must also be controlled. The alien also uses its powers to shut down every machine in the surrounding countryside, save those belonging to Tom and the subjugated: in a miniature remake of The Day The Earth Stood Still (1951), trains, cars, and industrial machines crawl to a halt.\n\nAt first glance It Conquered The World seems fairly conventional in its mid-1950s social presumptions, with its pair of dutiful housewife-partners framing the core clash of rebel antihero, a study in warning about and professional intellectual dissenters crossing the line into outright disloyalty through utter conviction they’re doing right, versus the firmly with-the-program hero. Add to this to the way the alien mimics a particular kind of propagandist ideal of what a Communist was supposed to act like – lacking familiar moral standards, acting according to emotionless expedience and absorbing other consciousnesses into its own, blank, gestalt identity. As the film unfolds, however, Corman has great fun revising and toying with those precepts. The alien proves instead a caricature of arch individualism, as Paul realises, acting without any understanding of human empathy as above all the underpinning of a social animal. Paul has to become the anarchic and ruthless guerrilla warrior within his own little backwater. The wives are soon split between the conformity-pushing, in the shape of the controlled Joan, thrusting one of the bat-creatures at her husband with a smile of pleasure straight out of a TV commercial evangelising a miracle cleaning product, and Claire, the seething defender of both home and species, who becomes increasingly determined and irate in provoking her husband’s conscience before marching off with rifle in hand to confront the alien invader. The military hierarchy, in the form of Pattick, is easily controlled, and his watchwords of paranoia readily tweaked to serve the alien’s quarantining needs precisely.\n\nAll that’s left of army power capable of intervening is a unit of bewildered GIs tramping about the landscape as if trapped in their own private Beckett play. Here we get the essential Corman double act, of Dick Miller as the stern, rugged, but confused sergeant Neil, and Haze as Ortiz, ethnic comic relief, an obscurely accented, clumsy, but attentive private who notes the “funny-looking bird” that keeps flitting overhead. Cruel satire on the spectacle of repression of civil rights protestors comes when Paul happens upon the controlled sheriff casually gunning down elderly newspaper editor Haskell (Thomas E. Jackson) for his refusal to obey orders. Paul’s sense of logic dictates that anyone possessed by the alien is “my enemy,” and takes this to the still rather shocking limit of shooting Joan after she attempts to plug him into the alien’s soothing mainstream of mindless obedience. Corman’s jocular cynicism extends to the dead-eyed violence that dots the film, from Tom setting Shallert on fire with his blowtorch after he changes sides, to one of the suborned scientists at the rocket range calmly reciting instructions over the radio whilst his colleague throttles Ellen to death, after she is horrified to find the bat-creatures that delivered their control devices in a putrefying stack stashed in a locker: the cool, post-gender landscape of scientific research suddenly becomes the scene of proto-slasher movie stuff. Corman’s images become increasingly charged with evocations of extreme threat but all couched in everyday and domestic settings – Claire beholding her husband dutifully oiling up his rifle to get ready to kill his friend and lurking behind decorative bars that became a cage cutting her off from her husband, and Paul pulling out his pistol to gun down his wife and then clutching her body whilst sobbing.\n\nWhilst dotted with such episodes of surprisingly hard-edged violence and weirdness, It Conquered The World is like Day The World Ended finally propelled by character interaction, with the two scientists duelling with a kind of violence manifest in thought and attitude, violence that never becomes physical between them as Tom in particular tries to maintain the indulgent reasonableness of a man confident he’s about to be proven right. The rest of the action can be seen as mere illustration of the clash of their differing philosophies. Science fiction epic spills over into domestic drama, the two different marriages proving battlegrounds the alien war is fought on. Joan’s possession and Paul’s slaying of her sparks Tom’s appalled bewilderment: “She was still your wife – still Joan! You would have been one with her…”, to Paul’s hard, disgusted retort that she had become his enemy in a war that Tom has foisted on them all. Hard as it to see the roguish Van Cleef with his vulture-like, lunging physique as anyone’s idea of a famous scientist, he does a great job regardless of selling his character’s mix of fanatical fervour and friendly indulgence, as when he assures Paul over the phone that since he’s destroyed his control unit and can’t be possessed for at least a week he might as well come over a drink. But the scotch-sipping palsiness of Tom and Paul doesn’t disguise the sharp angles of their duels of language. “Makes me look back into history for comparison,” Tom comments when Paul notes the alien’s ruthless methods. “Comparison or rationalisation?” Paul retorts. Finally the alien, tired of Paul marauding and upsetting their plans, decides it can’t wait to muzzle him and commands Tom to kill his friend. And Tom seems to shoulder this responsibility in the name of the greater good.\n\nMeanwhile Claire, marvellous played by Garland, personally embodies a paradigm in her moment of his history, trying to live according to the ideal of wifely duty, a duty that demands she incessantly harass her husband over his increasingly dubious life choices, the old job talk transmogrified into a running debate on the ethics of intergalactic treason. As treason unfolds, Claire finds herself made militant and obliged to go out and face the being that is both organ of and puppet master for Tom’s galactic-sized ego. In the process she evolves into a rough draft for Ellen Ripley in her furious, alien-slayer resolve. “Look, I don’t know if you can hear me or not,” she barks over the radio at the alien she now sees as her personal nemesis, “But if you can you listen good – I hate your living guts for what you’ve done to my husband and to my world! I know you for the coward you are and I’m gonna kill you!” The steals the rifle Tom intends to use on Paul and ventures into the caves. There she’s confronted by the creature: “You think you’re gonna make a slave of the world? I’ll see you in hell first!” she snarls as she plugs the sneering creature. But the alien proves invulnerable to both bullets and invective, and Claire dies nastily in its pincers. A sorry end for a character who today would be onto her fourth franchise instalment. Tom and Paul overhear her death through the radio, finally shocking Tom out of all his illusions about the alien’s nature.\n\nOrtiz hears Claire’s screams whilst he’s foraging, as he fetches his comrades. Too late to save Claire, they battle the monster within and outside the cave. Meanwhile Paul visits the rocket range and guns down the possessed there, whilst Tom improvises a weapon with the blowtorch and kills the sheriff to get hold of his working car. Arriving at the cave, Tom is in time to see the soldiers being slaughtered by the alien on the rampage, but he manages to approach the alien which thinks it still his stooge, only for Tom to declare with savage reckoning, “I made you welcome to this Earth – you made it a charnel house!” He plunges the blowtorch into one of the Venusian’s eyes: the alien swipes him in agonised retaliation, and monster and scientist both topple over dead, Tom lying in the alien’s cold embrace. Corman’s laconic direction sharpens here and there with flashes of the inspired, like the sight of the alien’s gleaming eyes in deep shadow as it advances on Claire, and suddenly at the very end he goes for a concluding note of threadbare cinematic poetry, cutting between the various littered corpses left behind by the drama, as Paul makes account of the meaning of it all: “There can’t be any gift of perfection from outside ourselves,” Paul notes by way of eulogy when he arrives too late: “It has to come from inside – from Man himself.” A fascinating sign-off to a movie from the era, contrasting the usual moral along the lines of “there are some things man is not meant to know,” with Corman’s own, distinct variation: humanity must know itself before it can know anything. And in this idea, Corman had found the key to his career’s preoccupations. That, and making much out of practically nothing.\n\n.\n\nDirector / Screenwriter / Actor / Producer / Editor: Charles Chaplin\n\nBy Roderick Heath\n\nCharles Chaplin the filmmaker and Charlie Chaplin the performer were inseparable concepts from the first few months of his movie career. He became world-famous on the back of short films, at first churned out with insatiable creative zeal for an equally insatiable audience. Of the fifty-two known films he helmed and released between 1914 and 1919, all ran from one to four reels long, with his sense of the cinematic .obviously, constantly growing in ambition and skill. He had, in himself, the ideal star to build his movies around, knowing it was his business on one side of the camera to supply funny business and on the other side to catch it all in the best way possible. The flow of creation abruptly turned off for a time in 1919, and for over a year no new Chaplin film hit movie screens. The reasons for this piled up. Chaplin had formed the new studio United Artists with fellow stars Douglas Fairbanks and Mary Pickford to foster their artistic ambitions, but was still tied to a contract with the studio First National and forced to fulfil it. In the same period Chaplin had his disastrous first marriage, to be a recurring adjunct of his life and career. Chaplin’s growing determination to stretch his talents beyond straightforward comedy had been clearly indicated in the genre and tonal play of A Dog’s Life (1918) and Shoulder Arms (1918), and he next set out to make overtly Dickensian blend of comedy and human drama. The result of this labour of love was The Kid, released early in 1921.\n\nWith The Kid Chaplin stretched his cinematic and dramatic reflexes to finally make a feature film. Chaplin had obviously been moving in that direction, but also evidently wrestled with the question of how to annex the realm of long-form narrative without diluting the appeal of his comedy or stumbling into pretentiousness. The Kid drew on his childhood poverty in London and depicted with jagged immediacy the experience of being separated from a parent – in his case, his mentally ill mother, the movie a version of his essential Tramp hero and the young boy he takes under his wing – and at the mercy of a world, where protective authority feels like no protection at all and the leafless street can prove its own kind of garden. Chaplin had matured into a front-rank directing talent: Chaplin effortlessly handled the film’s shifts from knockabout humour to stylisation, realistic reportage, tear-jerking feeling, dreamy reverie and fantasy, and action-thriller stuff in the film’s most famous sequence. That sequence depicted the Tramp having his young ward taken from him by authorities, and his venture across the cityscape to rescue him from the van taking him away. Chaplin had also, in The Kid, recreated the feel of the London of his childhood, evoked and recreated in the shabby areas of an American city.\n\nChaplin achieved a rare and double-edged feat with his movies, drawing the filmgoing audience around the world into a world most either wanted to forget or didn’t know existed, and making it seem like the most vital place in the universe. Chaplin’s Tramp was always a figure hovering on the edge of things – broke, alone, itinerant, clinging on to existence on the underside of cities and societies. The Tramp was essentially good but never saintly: he could be hard, scruffy, a little dishonest, a man whose sympathy lay in his perpetual pluck, his obvious heartsore solitude, and his constant, improvisatory genius for endurance. Chaplin, after turning out a few more short subjects to fulfil his First National contract, next tried to break out of being a director tied to his own presence and persona with his second feature, A Woman of Paris (1923), which was amongst other things a vehicle for his discovery and regular costar Edna Purviance. Chaplin only appeared in a cameo, as the film was, in part, an attempt to break away from making movies only featuring himself, and accusations that was all he was good at. Despite being recognised now as one of Chaplin’s major works, and drew notices even at the time for how adroitly Chaplin had swapped out his comic detail for emotional and stylistic nuance, the movie proved a bomb. Purviance’s career was abruptly killed stone dead, and Chaplin nursed his wounds whilst indulging a second, even more disastrous marriage with the teenaged Lita Grey, a union on which the fuse burned quickly and detonated as Chaplin was gearing up to make The Circus.\n\nIn the meantime, Chaplin rebounded with The Gold Rush (1925), a film he spent a head-spinning $1 million making and 15 months shooting. The Gold Rush proved every bit the successful resurgence Chaplin sought and, although not universally admired at the time, it quickly became regarded as one of his finest films: indeed, it was Chaplin’s personal favourite. Chaplin’s Tramp trying his hand at gold prospecting in the Klondike was the pretext for legendary comic set-pieces including the eating of a shoe and a shack tilting on a cliff’s edge. Chaplin perhaps came closest to an ideal in his method of extracting humour from situations and prospects that seem grim, even horrific on the face of things, and touched with more than a little surrealism and lyrical energy. The Gold Rush is still the ideal movie for introducing an audience to silent cinema. It also felt like a farewell to the mature concept of the Tramp persona as a not-quite-happy, not-quite-going-lucky embodiment of the Everyman who could by virtue of his simplicity turn up in any place and any time – by film’s end the that incarnation of the Tramp got rich and got the girl.\n\nThe Circus, on the other hand, looks like the first of a loose trilogy where the Tramp character seen in all three could be taken to be the same person. We get the Tramp in three different locales that speak of changing times and ways of seeing the world, moving from the transient and illusive Victoriana refuge of a circus to a labyrinthine, expressionist, contemporary city of City Lights and on to the hyperbole of the slightly futuristic, inimical industrial world nestled cheek-by-jowl with the same old poverty in Modern Times. Each movie ends with distinct variations on a theme, seeing the Tramp as someone looking for anyone to love in any fashion, but also willing to selflessly fight for and sacrifice on behalf of those he loves, not demanding anything for it, passing through variations of dashed hopes, disillusionment and understanding, and finally gaining someone to walk down the road with. The Circus was made under particularly heavy weather for Chaplin: he was just coming out of an acrimonious break-up with his Grey played out in tabloid headlines, his studio burned down mid-shoot, and, as with The Kid, the personal failure provoked artistic intensity. In one of those little ironies of cinema, Grey suggested Merna Kennedy to Chaplin as his costar for the film (Kennedy went on to have a busy career in the early talkie era, only to cut it short when she married director and choreographer Busby Berkeley in what proved a short union, and died startlingly young of a heart attack, aged 36). Whilst Chaplin would, famously, resist the tide of talkies in his own fashion, a tide already rising when he released The Circus, nonetheless it was also his own, last, proper silent movie.\n\nThe Circus was another big hit and gained Chaplin attention at the first Oscar ceremony, where he was given a special award for his overall achievement in making the movie, and also nominations as Best Actor and the soon-defunct award for Best Comedy Director. But The Circus has long hovered with relative unease in critical terms between the outlandish bravura of The Gold Rush and the exactingly fashioned, poetic crescendo of City Lights. Chaplin’s own reticence to talk about it, stemming from the mess that was his life at the time and which he plainly channelled into the movie, didn’t help, although he did, decades later, write a new score for the movie and append a song to the opening. It is, however, a candidate for Chaplin’s richest film, and the pivotal work of his career. His experience and sense of artistic meaning are conceptually summarised and metaphorically encoded throughout The Circus, contemplating a life up until that point spent as an entertainer and creator, and opening the gate to the themes and gestures of his later work. Chaplin’s established artistic reflexes, swerving beyond high slapstick comedy and emotion, here revel in jagged alternations.\n\nThe Circus also reveals how much Chaplin had learned about making movies since the days of Shoulder Arms, which was already damn good filmmaking. Chaplin’s contribution to the lexicon of popular film is generally seen not as one of big technical gestures, no revolutionary editing displays or the like, but in terms of a succinct sense of how to connect elements to an overall expressive urge, inviting the viewer into the space, physical and mental, of his protagonist, the staging of comic elements always lively, even madcap, but only ever proving lodestones of what the Chaplin hero is experiencing. It’s hard to ignore the feeling that beneath all the other reasons for Chaplin’s sudden plunge in popularity during and after World War II lay, beyond all his other failings, the feeling that Chaplin was reminding everyone of the past, hanging around like a bad smell when after the war everyone wanted to pretend that world was dead and gone. Whereas Chaplin’s entire career and famous persona were built around the proposition that the worst might indeed happen – but that too can be weathered.\n\nThe movie proper opens with a star emblazoned in a white background, which proves within seconds to be the paper target through which bursts a young circus performer, Merna (Kennedy), an acrobat who performs leaps off a horse’s back. Merna provides the idealised feminine element of the circus’ roundelay of dynamic physical performance, specialising in seeming gossamer and agile and lovely in her white costume and tutu, contrasting the lumpen crew of circus clowns who pivot at the centre of the arc her horse describes. Her stepfather is the Ring Master (Allan Garcia), and after she dismounts and bows to the applause of the crowd, he stalks after her, cornering her alone and berating her for missing one of her leaps through the hoop: in what is evidently a common occurrence, the girl, frightened and submissive, pleads that she couldn’t help, but the Ring Master grabs her by the wrist and throws her down through one of the star-stamped hoops. Merna lies prone as the Ring Master tells her she won’t get any food that night, and heads back out to meet the clowns as they come out of the ring: he looks between them with patent disgust, noting, “And you’re supposed to be funny,” before pointing out the half-empty stalls and blaming them for the poor attendance. After he stomps away, the clowns sit in glum wilting whilst the girl sobs where she lies. Chaplin softens the shocking impact of this a tad by billing Merna as only the Ring Master’s stepdaughter, but in the dialogue she only calls him “Father,” and another character refers to her by the same name as the actress playing her.\n\nThe star target in the hoop is already established the film’s recurring, deeply ironic emblem, of aspiration in general, and the eternally aimed-for glory as a performer in specific – in this case initially the girl who has to balance on a moving horse and make leaps into the air, something requiring amazing skill even to attempt and the closest thing to a modern equivalent of a Minoan bull jumper, all of life contained in the jump. Within seconds afterwards the girl is being pushed to the ground through one of those stars, and at the end the Tramp screws up a tattered remnant of it and throws it aside. Extraordinary ambivalence for an artist who had climbed to the absolute pinnacle of success in the history of his profession. Merna and her life would be at home in Dickens or D.W. Griffith’s Broken Blossoms (1919). Not only does Chaplin establish the girl as a figure of ready sympathy, but as indeed one he wants the audience to see as more deserving of sympathy than the Tramp, partly to sell the ending. The Ring Master is a bully and thug under his well-maintained performance veneer, but his bad attitude is at least partly informed by the perpetual dance near the edge of ruin that is being an impresario, saddled with performers who just don’t have the edge he thinks required to make the whole enterprise work: the entire circus vibrates on the depressing and cringe-inducing wavelength of desperation.\n\nThe one thing this place needs is yet another loser in dire circumstances, so of course a Tramp (Chaplin) is drawn to it like a magnet. The Tramp, as a title card states thing succinctly, is “around the Side Shows, hungry and broke.” He immediately finds himself in danger, as a pickpocket (Steve Murphy) targets onlookers outside a funhouse. When a victim accuses the thief of taking his wallet, the pickpocket swiftly stuffs the wallet into the Tramp’s jacket, planning to get it back later, and so passes a pat-down by a cop called by the victim. The thief trails the Tramp as he searches for any happenstance source of food. The Tramp finds one in the form of a sandwich in the hand of a small child carried on his shoulder by his father. Whilst the father is distractedly talking to another patron, the Tramp makes a play of amusing the child with funny faces as he takes bites from the sandwich. It’s a marker of Chaplin’s confidence of his connection with audience, and also his willingness to test it, that within seconds of first appearing in the film he’s stealing food from a baby, and doing so in a way that highlights Chaplin’s most impish expressivity, the aspect of teasing good-humour, bordering on cuteness, he often invested in the Tramp figure, playing up its calculated side to better note how he’s learned to act in response to sheer need.\n\nThe Tramp even slaps a little more sauce from the vendor’s table onto the sandwich, and adds sauce to the act when the father suddenly turns about: the Tramp grabs the tyke’s bib and wipes his lips with it, as if the child has been chomping down merrily. The Tramp’s desperation is his engine of wit and ingenuity, and the source of his humour value to the viewer. This contradiction had been present in the persona almost since his inception, and The Circus meditates on the aberrance of this, as well as the necessity of it. Marcel Carné would borrow and recontextualise the wallet-stealing business for Les Enfants Du Paradis (1945) to introduce his hero Baptiste, who would be at once a tribute to Chaplin and also to Chaplin’s own inspirations, the mimes of French and Italian theatre. The pickpocket tries to recover the stolen wallet from the Tramp’s pocket, only to be grabbed himself by a cop, and the cop hands the Tramp the wallet assuming it was his, even telling him to count the money to make sure it’s all there. The Tramp, after almost giving the wallet over, decides to hold onto this tremendous stroke of luck, but immediately pays the price when the wallet’s actual owner sees him with it and tries to have him arrested, even as the real pickpocket slips the cop’s grasp and flees into the carnival row crowd. The two men converge, both with cops chasing them, running pell-mell down a lane, locked as mirror images, except for the piquant aside of the Tramp, glancing at his doppelganger, briefly lifting his hat in greeting.\n\nThe Tramp scurries into the funhouse, where a young couple are amusing themselves on an oscillating bit of floor and an open door leads into a mirror maze, a space where the Tramp finds himself utterly bewildered and lifting his hat to his own reflection. The pickpocket also tries to hide in the funhouse, momentarily falling foul of the treachery of the sliding floor, before attacking the Tramp in the maze, demanding the wallet. The Tramp gives him the slip and escapes outside, but sees one of the cops below, and so pretends to be one of the automatons on the funhouse frontage, pivoting and gesturing. When the pickpocket emerges he moves to strike the Tramp with a blackjack, but stands dead still in following the Tramp’s lead when he too spots the cop, his forced immobility allowing the Tramp to change his automaton act and keep bashing him over the head with his own blackjack. The act is only given away as the pickpocket keels over, and a cop catches the Tramp after he dives back into the mirror maze: for a moment the cop is bewildered about how to get out again. All of The Circus is great but this opening is particularly brilliant, indeed a height of cinema in its way, silent and otherwise, in the way Chaplin builds his jokes and his visuals in careful concert.\n\nThe image of Tramp and thief running alongside each-other, locked together by the consequences of actions and motives that are similar but also asymmetrical in fundamental terms, kicks off the game of splintering identity and simulacra, playing off the sudden flux of each man’s status in the world: the Tramp dances on the edge of criminality but tries with all his might to avoid falling over it until tempted beyond endurance and seemingly beneficent fortune. This turns immediately into an absurdist trap, forcing him to take refuge in the organised illusions of the funfair which only contrast and clarify all the unstable surfaces of the real world. The mirror presents the Tramp’s image metastasizing into something inescapable, splintering his sense of self until he finishes up lifting his hat to his own reflection, an image that gets crazier until the Tramp’s last, frantic retreat there as the cop chases him, his darting image suddenly hitting an ecstatic flux that sees the frame churning with a plethora of Chaplins. As well as a great visual joke, this can be seen as a possible dig at Chaplin’s many imitators, both onscreen and off – which inspired him to get the first ever copyright protection for an artist’s appearance and style – and the feeling of the artist’s specific identity suddenly being at the mercy of the world, escaping their own frame and running rampant in the world, diffusing essence. It’s the logical terminus for the idea of falling in love with the camera, and it falling in love with you, as Chaplin first explored in is screen debut, Kid Auto Races At Venice (1914): the complete loss of self, the disintegration into manifold reflected images. But the cop, the authority, can still spot the real one. The game of automatons demands the ability to seem perfectly mechanical and dehumanised, an idea Chaplin would again return to with more thoroughness in the assembly lines of Modern Times. The game of pretending to be automatons sees the Tramp able to deal out a dose of the pickpocket’s own medicine and a touch of revenge besides, but it also has a touch of the grotesque in the Tramp’s indulgence of a mocking laugh disguised as part of the mechanised ritual.\n\nThe way Chaplin builds up the momentum of this comic mayhem and pieces it all together into a flux of carefully organised chaos is cinema of a sophistication only a few filmmakers were matching — Griffith, Lang, and the Soviet filmmakers, and none of them, apart from Dziga Vertov sometimes, were funny. Chaplin continues layering his gag sequences in this seemingly random, finally converging style right through the film, culminating in the tightrope walk that is the last comic set-piece. The Tramp manages to give the cop the slip in the mirror maze and flees into the big top. In the ring the proper clowns of the circus are working through a routine on a spinning stage with all their well-honed art, tumbling off the disc, but the audience is bored. In comes the Tramp and pursuing cop and both finish up running on the stage, seeming to get nowhere, until the Tramp manages to outpace the cop just enough to come up and around behind him, before tripping and falling, swatting the cop off the stage in turn, and then also knocking down the Ring Master when he dashes over to see what’s going on. The crowd is absolutely delighted by this spectacle of life that looks like art, and they’re rewarded with a second display of the Tramp’s accidental greatness when he takes refuge in the apparatus of the circus’s resident magician, Professor Bosco (George Davis), who performs, trying to disappear and re-conjure his compulsory leggy assistant (Betty Morrissey) only to get the Tramp in her place. Finally the Tramp flees the tent and encounters the pickpocket, now firmly in the custody of the cop who was pursuing him: the Tramp hands over the wallet in question eagerly and bids adieu to his brief life of crime. “Bring back the Funny Man!” the audience demands, whilst the Tramp settles down and goes to sleep in the back of a cart outside the tent.\n\nThe joke extends through the film as the Tramp operates from positions of emotional directness – he’s funny when exhibiting the traits of raw survival and also of the outsider, and when alight with the strange stimulus of love, but take away both and he becomes a damp squib, urged to ever-more-risky escapades to top himself. The distortions and reality-warping effect of the funhouse proves a kind of portal for the Tramp, who passes through into the nominal shelter and refuge of the circus itself, and that proves a place with transformative and highly ironic possibilities for transmuting the Tramp’s errant nature into the stuff of entertainment and earning potential. But it also proves a place rife with its own kind of inequity, brutality, hierarchy, and a queasy mixture of artistry and raw profit motive imperatives: domestic abuse from a brutish parent and angry haranguing of hard-luck clowns. Behind the surface frivolity, heroic discipline and entertainment of the circus lurks real people in states of misery and hard-working. Merna is punished by her father for her failures in performing: “You don’t eat tonight,” he dictates, and extends this ban to all the other people of the circus when they try to slip her some food. Success in show business is the literal difference between eating and not eating a lesson the Tramp knows implicitly and Merna has foisted on her.\n\nAfter the Ring Master realises the crowd enjoyed the Tramp’s travails, he looks for him and sees him as he’s being unwittingly hauled away in the cart. The Tramp is offered a chance to audition for the clown troupe, and he camps out amidst the circus trailers: having been loaned a bit in advance, the Tramp boils some water in a can on a campfire, and has a piece of bread, and even obtains an egg from a chicken that trots by: the splendour of plenty. Merna, famished, exits her trailer, whilst the Tramp chases the chicken, can’t help taking a bite of his slice of bread. The Tramp returns and seeing this responds exactly like a man used to his life would, grabbing the bread and warding the girl off with a threat of force. As with his temptation with the wallet earlier, this proves his undoing as he trips over his own campfire and knocks over his pot of soup. As the Tramp settles down, and recovers his affectation of calm rectitude, he waves the girl over and splits the piece of bread with her as recognises she’s as hungry as him. Gifted the portion of bread, Merna starts scoffing it down, only for the Tramp to stop her and tells her off, warning her she’ll get hiccups. When he glances away she quickly downs the rest and, as the Tramp warned, gets hiccups, but so does he. As the Tramp tries to get over this attack he learns from Merna that she lives and works in the circus, and is soon privy to a quick display of her lot in life as the Ring Master sees her eating, takes the bread off her, and slaps her in the face before chasing her off.\n\nThis whole sequence is just as impressive as the opening, but in a completely different register, madcap comedy and conceptual patterning giving way to precisely mimed and observed characterisation – the reflexive hard case visible under the Tramp’s surface is, like the earlier food-stealing bit, an acknowledge of just what dire straits look like, but go further: Chaplin pushing his stock character into a zone of disconcerting realism, a place the Tramp immediately withdraws from, acknowledging that his civility is a pretence, but a pretence he requires, and so does everyone else. His own flurry of threatened violence is also immediately contrasted with the cold thuggery of Ring Master, the deftness of Chaplin’s portrayal of the Tramp’s attempts to reassert his savoir faire and get Merna to act right and getting her doe-eyed, smiling gluttony instead. The Tramp’s expression of disbelief when he sees Merna’s treatment is immediately followed by a reflexive twitch as the Ring Master turns from him as if afraid he’ll hit him too, but immediately switching to pleasantry as he knows damn well his own chance of regaining a niche in the world depends on this dubious dictator. Nonetheless, covert resistance and mutual aid: the Tramp dashes back long enough to give the egg to the girl.\n\nDuring his tryout, the Tramp’s efforts to be deliberately funny include waddling and some simple farceur moves, meeting the Ring Master’s loathing. He gets the company clowns to show the Tramp some of their regular acts, including the “William Tell act” where one shoots an arrow through the apple on another’s head – part of the act is to take a bite from the apple before the shot, but the Tramp proposes to substitute a banana instead – and “the barber-shop act,” where the clowns play two rival barbers and a hapless customer that finishes with everyone slathered in soap suds. Here Chaplin nods deliberately not just to the kind of vaudevillian routines and slapstick elements given new life in the short funnies his old boss Mack Sennett specialised in making, but the whole art of the physical comic and the kinds of routines that have a basic structure, and what’s required to make those acts funny with each iteration. Chaplin even manages to get a banana skin in there, but in a totally different fashion to expected. Soon enough the Tramp has repeatedly annoyed the Ring Master, accidentally causing him to drop on his bum when the Tramp settles on his chair, and flailing wildly when trying to perform the barber routine and getting the boss lathered too, and he’s chased out in a fury. But Chaplin’s little master class in comedy staging commenting upon itself isn’t finished yet: as the Tramp heads out, miffed but acquiescent, he annoys a donkey that chases him, and becomes his bete noire around the circus, charging at him whenever it sees him. The Tramp’s obliviousness to humiliation and failure is nonetheless on display in a variation on the kind of scene where a man tries to be charming despite the impossibility of his position with a woman, when he talks to Merna after the failed audition, still with soap smeared in his face, and she helps him restore his façade of natty composure. After she’s called to perform, the Tramp indulges a little lovelorn voyeurism through a hole in the circus tent.\n\nThe Tramp’s tryout sees Chaplin reducing his own, familiar act to shtick, an act of overt self-satire that takes a poke at both his own temptations to complacency and caricatures of his style: just about anyone can move like me, Chaplin saying, but it’s how it’s all put together that makes the difference. This feeds into the way Chaplin constructs a story that affects to make slapstick comedy a succession of ridiculous events. The obvious irony in all this is that Chaplin, a man who had poured every inch of himself, physically and mentally, into becoming a great clown, the sure-fire crowd-pleaser playing his signature persona, presents his character as someone who becomes a comedy star through being frantic, clumsy, and utterly hapless, whilst of course actually being rigorously and agonisingly planned and played. Chaplin’s rise to fame was the quintessential American success story: all he needed to get ahead was hard work, moxie, genius, a once-in-a-century opportunity, impossibly gruelling training in theatrical arts, and an aching existential void at heart demanding constant effort and movement. Chaplin’s thesis about the circus being a society in miniature is expanded as the Tramp’s second shot comes when several of the stagehands revolt when they’ve not been paid: the head property man (Stanley J. ‘Tiny’ Sandford), the ideal enforcer for the Ring Master in his size and strength, gets angry and beats up the whole lot of them. The head property man grabs the Tramp, who’s looking in on Merna within the circus tent through a loophole, and asks if he wants a job.\n\nBeing pressganged into prop man service puts the Tramp and the prop plates he carries in for a juggler at risk again: the donkey charges him again, knocking him into the lower audience stalls. His attempt to carry out a table loaded with Bosco’s animals for his hat-pull tricks sees him unleashing fur and fowl: the Tramp cannot construct comedy, but he can deconstruct the tricks and mechanics of show business, which the audience finds cripplingly hilarious. The Tramp’s efforts to put the rabbits back in the hat are the ultimate mockery of the Tramp’s keep-up-appearances life ethic, everything conspiring to give the game away, to turn the performance inside out, to make the seemingly unfunny reality of the enterprise the source of humour, and also a contemplation of how the perception of intensity of effort in entertainment is so often the lodestone of its failure. One has to be so good at art that it simply seems to happen. The blown act becomes the new act, Chaplin’s existential confession. The Ring Master finally realises what he has on his hands, and commands that the Tramp be kept on to exploit this unique deconstructive talent for disaster, a joke he cannot be let in on for either the joke’s sake or the Ring Master’s financial advantage. Chaplin’s understanding of Hollywood economics is still true today, in the boss’s certainty that well-fed talent is unproductive and unmanageable. “The circus prospered, but not the property man; and the girl led the same hard life.”\n\nChaplin had a way with not just investing a comedy routine with a guiding idea but in turning it into a kind of ritualised expostulation of that idea, and it’s the marrow of The Circus, much as it would be with the Tramp getting caught in the moving gears in Modern Times and Adenoid Hynkel playing with the inflatable globe in The Great Dictator. Other comedy sequences throughout The Circus carry the same quality of implication through the chosen motifs and elements – the art of forcing the swallowing a horse pill, being trapped in a cage with a lion, walking a tightrope whilst harassed by monkeys. As if Chaplin has set out very precisely to put across the feeling of being someone obliged to both work and live in the public eye, to make one’s living, even one’s fortune, in labour that demands arts both subtle and forceful, mischievous and bludgeoning, always at risk of getting shredded or battered or broken, where a perspective and a concept can be reported but not editorialised. One also leads to another: the attempt to blow the pill down the horse’s throat sees the Tramp finish up with it lodged in his throat instead – “He blew first!” – and in his panic runs right into the lion’s cage, the door slamming shut and closing him in. The Tramp’s attitude swerves hysterically between posturing bravado and sheer terror: Merna’s arrival seems to promise rescue, only for her to faint at the alarming spectacle. When she wakes up and frees him, the Tramp flees at a gallop and finishes up on a flagpole, but tries again to recover his self-image as he pretends to be stretching his muscles in exercise. Finally an angry slap from the Head Property Man brings up the horse pill: too hard to swallow.\n\nThe Tramp’s success gives him a power that notably eludes the striking stagehands, power he immediately applies to secure decent treatment for Merna as well as himself, one he is finally clued into his success. This cues another of Chaplin’s brilliant bits of behaviour, as the Tramp squares off against the Ring Master as he suddenly flexes muscle of a kind, tearing bits of straw in rough approximation of macho gesture and leaning on a bale to indicate his resolve, only for the bale to tip and him fall to the ground. The Ring Master offers fifty dollars a week, then sixty, and finally offers to double that, only for the Tramp to declare, “Nothing less than a hundred!” Master negotiator. Whilst clued in, the Tramp doesn’t lose his ability to make the crowd laugh: the buoyancy of love and empowerment carry him through, but heartbreak proves ruinous. The circus fortune teller, pressed to read Merna’s palm by some of the other young circus women, predicts for her “love and marriage with a dark, handsome man who is near you now.” The Tramp, overhearing this, goes loopy, of course assuming he is the man, and he buys a ring off one of the other clowns (Chaplin regular Harry Bergman) to propose to Merna. But fate is a quick-change artist, and Merna swiftly encounter the new tightrope-walking act, Rex (Harry Crocker), “King of the Air,” and Merna’s heart is instantly lost. “I’m in love!” Merna quickly tells the fortune teller, and again the Tramp overhears. The Tramp’s spirit visibly wilts within his body, but he obeys the call to perform. The show must go on.\n\nAnd yet the show without passion, without feeling, is meaningless: professionalism is a tool that can get an artist through a trough of such feeling, but not replace it indefinitely. The heartbroken Tramp is no longer capable of being funny, his audiences suddenly silent and bewildered by his performances. He is instead driven to competition, trying his hand at mastering tightrope-walking with a low-slung rope: “New Hopes and New Ambitions.” Rex triply taints the Tramp, both in his skill, a daring, heroic thing compared to the clown. His performing costume is evening wear, aping the kind of high society style the Tramp himself evidently fantasises about wearing but never can, but strips this off mid-act to reveal the outfit of a more traditional circus performer, masculine virility bared. But one night he proves a no-show, and the Ring Master presses the Tramp replacing him as he’s seen him practising. The Tramp talks a carny into strapping a sandbag hoist onto him, allowing him to pretend to be a phenomenally skilled and daring eacrobat. Things go wrong, of course. Some monkeys from the magician’s menagerie, accidentally released by the Tramp before the show, scuttle into the highwires and clamber all over the would-be wirewalker, and the harness comes off, forcing the Tramp to traverse the wire and fight off monkeys all at once, his existence reduced finally to its perfect essence, the ultimate act of fine balance. The ideal act is matched to the ideal audience reaction, the crowd below thrilled and terrified, leaping from their seats in alarm and concern, save one sole man who remains stuffing popcorn in his face even as his eyes remain glued to the spectacle: the movie viewer in microcosm.\n\nThe monkeys themselves contribute invaluably to this scene, one impish animal draping itself over Chaplin’s head, biting his nose and slipping its tail in his mouth. Chaplin nonetheless regretted losing footage from the first version of the scene he shot, yet another of the disaster plaguing the production. The scene is however its emblem, and one for the entire experience of the film’s making, and of Chaplin’s philosophy of show business. Chaplin would return to the self-reflexive contemplation of the stage artist’s life in Limelight (1952), if in quite a different key, from the perspective of an aging has-been musing sadly on a waned career. Of course, too much woe-is-me from the superstar who kept marrying teenage girls, and left his last wife Oona an estate worth $100 million, might get more than a bit rich. But The Circus is an artefact imprinted with Chaplin’s mental landscape as a man as much as The Kid was with his childhood, and suggests it was never a happy place, a realm where the ultimate fate could always be to finish up alone and on the skids. But Chaplin his prime could count on an audience, and his art was communing with that audience, converting the private into the public. Except that The Circus portrays the consequences of losing that touch: the Tramp can no longer protect Merna, or himself, when he cannot make the crowd laugh. One of Chaplin’s coups of visual effect, characterisation, and comedy coalesces again in a framing where the Tramp imagines, in the form of a projected alternative self, rising up and knocking out Rex with a few stiff blows, with a backward flick of his foot to kick dust on his felled rival for extra disdain. Here Chaplin illustrates, with a clever split-screen effect, the Tramp’s interior mental landscape when finally provoked to a fine edge not just in humiliation by the world but humiliation in the small salving space available to all humans regardless of social station.\n\nAnd yet this is an illusion, an almost Buddhist rejection of grasping, desirous love. Instead, the Tramp’s actual, ultimate expression of love it to abandon it and draft Rex into the role, ensuring he and Merna get married.Not that the Tramp surrenders that easily: after seeming despite all the odds of reviving his fortunes by surviving the highwire, an entry into a completely absurdist and hyperbolic zone, the Tramp sees the Ring Master hit Merna again and promptly attacks and flattens him, leaving him with a beautiful shiner as recompense for getting sacked. When the Tramp camps out near the circus that night, Merna comes to him and wants to leave with him, but the Tramp laughs that off and instead tracks down Rex, proposes he propose, and gives him the ring he bought to do it with. The next day he provides a one-man crowd throwing rice for the happy couple as they emerge from a court house, and looks on as the newlyweds approach the Ring Master. The Tramp immediately gets confirmation he’s helped the right man for the job when Rex immediately stands up to the Ring Master when he accosts Merna: “You’re speaking to my wife,” Rex tells the Ring Master fiercely. Merna demands the Tramp be given his place in the troupe back again as part of the peacemaking of morning, and the Ring Master complies with the condition he ride in the last wagon. Merna and Rex instead invite him to ride with them, but the Tramp makes his point when he lifts two fingers with a smile and then three with a shake of the head.\n\nChaplin’s influence flows on endlessly – in the theme of a selflessly arranged marriage with a hidden cost there’s as much of The Circus in Yasujiro Ozu’s Late Spring (1949) and in the spectacle of bittersweet survival in Federico Fellini’s Nights of Cabiria (1957) as in any comedy. Here Chaplin unifies the meditation on his career and the emotional instincts of his audience. Just about everyone, or everyone who counts, anyway, has been the Tramp to some degree in their life, on both the crucial but also incidental levels of not knowing what the next step is, where the next meal or roof or paycheck is, but also in the things actually lived for. The Tramp’s gestures for Merna and Rex reconfigure his experience with the wallet at the outset. Chaplin could well have ended The Circus easily with the Tramp farewelling the newlyweds with a fatherly, acquiescent twinkle, or take his place in the wagon train as the circus rolls out of its campsite on to a new vista. But Chaplin knew the show was rolling on: sound was coming, his career and life were on shaky ground, and what came next would have been a loaded question for him just as it was for so many who had been gods of the silver screen until the microphone switched on. The relatively limited range of such concerns nonetheless were amplified soon as the Great Depression took hold and suddenly a generation of people found themselves playing the Tramp.\n\nAnd the Tramp as a character was made for something for more than regulation happy endings – the whole point of the character, indeed, was that he showed people how to weather unhappy endings. We should all wish we could pick ourselves up and get on with life like the Tramp. But here Chaplin manages something that goes beyond stoicism or sadsack pathos. The Tramp stands and watches as the carts trundle off, until he’s left in the centre of the ring left in the ground by the big top amidst settling dust. The parade has literally gone by, leaving only its ghostly impression, and with it the moment of the Tramp’s brief impersonation of a star and aspiring lover. Chaplin shifts in from his stark long shot to a close one, regarding the Tramp as picks up a scrap with the star Merna jumped through on it, registering the look of abyssal regret and pining that passes over the Tramp’s face. Chaplin’s greatness as a mime is apparent, but so is the subtlety of expression, a glimpse of something over the edge of his guise. The Tramp here is the man, the inner self, the one he hides, and he damn well hurts: that Chaplin seems to be wearing less makeup, to be more himself, also registers. And then he mutters a very plain “Oh well,” scrunches up the scrap, stands, and kicks it away with one of his backward foot flips. This was a trick Chaplin had first used on screen in Kid Auto Races At Venice (1914), but with the bit of comic skill now reconfigured as something infinitely more meaningful, blending acceptance and defiance, weariness and willpower, finality and reflexive purpose. The Tramp trots away, resuming his sprightly walk twirling his cane, still impossible, still hopeless and placeless and friendless, and still indomitable. It’s one of the most famous last shots in cinema, and justly so – Chaplin’s most exactingly crafted and calculated, most perfectly iconic vision of his persona. And also Chaplin’s commentary on himself, and any entertainer. The show must go on. Because the show is life.\n\n.\n\nKid Auto Races At Venice (aka The Kid Auto Race ; The Pest): Director / Screenwriter / Actor: Henry Lehrman\n\nShoulder Arms: Director / Screenwriter / Actor / Producer: Charles Chaplin\n\nThis essay is presented as part of the Eighth Annual Allan Fish Online Film Festival 2024, a festival founded by Jamie Uhler and hosted by Wonders in the Dark, held to honor the memory of the late cineaste extraordinaire Allan Fish, considering films in the public domain and/or available to view online\n\nBy Roderick Heath\n\nCharlie Chaplin. 110 years after he made his debut in the costume of his ‘Tramp’ character, Chaplin is very possibly still the most recognisable and emblematic performer in cinema history. Even those who have never seen his films, and indeed would not be caught dead daring to watch a silent movie, know on sight the figure with the bowler hat, little moustache, cane, ballooning trousers, and odd ways of ambulating. The mystique of Chaplin feels inextricable from the phenomenon of popular cinema itself. Although movies had around for twenty years by the time his face first flickered upon a screen, Chaplin became the first bona fide superstar of cinema. Perhaps of history altogether. Before, performers had been limited, however far their names travelled, to whatever locale they were in. Then Chaplin was on screens all over the world, completely uninhibited by place or language but exploring life with image and gesture and motion – precisely why, arguably, only a physical comedian like Chaplin was equipped to truly make the best of what cinema was in his day. Chaplin’s life arc has long been inseparable from his art, and indeed Chaplin owed much of his colossal success precisely to the way he made the overt stylisation of his performance, the archetype he stepped into with his costume, somehow nonetheless suggest a lowered veil between performer and audience, that Chaplin was inviting the viewer into his personal mental universe and that he was also accessing theirs.\n\nAnd there was truth to this. Chaplin had assimilated his childhood and maturation and turned it into a running blend of high comedy riven with pathos and pain, even horror. Chaplin’s parent, Charles Snr and Hannah, were music hall performers, and Charles Snr had Romanichal heritage on his mother’s side. His parents’ marriage, whilst never officially dissolved, was essentially over just a couple of years after his birth in 1889. His mother, whose singing career never took off, also suffered from bouts of mental illness and venereal disease. Their father never provided support, so young Charles and his brother Sydney both eventually had to go into a workhouse and later to schools for pauper children. When their mother was finally hospitalised, Charles and Sydney were taken in by their father, but his severe alcoholism was also driving him to an early grave. Chaplin later recounted that his first stage performance came one night in Aldershot when he filled in for his ill mother with a short song and dance act. Forced to support both himself and his mother, Chaplin pursued performing as the only thing he could do, and spent a period time sleeping rough around London in the meantime. Chaplin had a steady stream of juvenile parts through his childhood and teenage years, including acting in the play Sherlock Holmes opposite actor William Gillette, who had co-written the play with Arthur Conan Doyle, on several national tours. Chaplin’s skill as a dancer later gained him success in a member of a clog dancing group, but he quit as he felt increasingly attracted to comedy.\n\nCharles and Sydney started working together and formed a comedy routine called Repairs when Charles was 18. Sydney later helped bring Charlie into the company run by the theatrical impresario Fred Karno, and Chaplin’s growing talent eventually made Karno select him for a team of performers he was sending to the United States – Stan Laurel was also one of the company. Whilst in the US Chaplin started an act he called “the Inebriate Swell,” an upper-crust souse, and this became his calling card. During his second American tour in 1913, Chaplin received an invitation from the New York Motion Picture Company, whose Los Angeles-based subsidiary Keystone Films had recently lost a star comedy performer, to give replacing him a shot. Chaplin watched some Keystone movies and found them a bit slapped-together in comedy terms, but the promise of a steady, $150 dollar-per-week contract was undoubtedly tempting. On a more personal level, so too was the chance to change his lifestyle. Chaplin took the offer, arriving at Keystone’s studio early in 1914 and encountering its legendary chief Mack Sennett, who was slightly surprised and a little aggravated by how young Chaplin was. His first movie was Making A Living, directed by and starring Henry Lehrman, released a month after it was filmed. In the meantime Chaplin was cast in Mabel’s Unusual Predicament, opposite Keystone’s biggest female star Mabel Normand. For this film, Chaplin started assembling a costume to give him a distinct screen persona, in a performing tradition with roots in the commedia dell’arte and its stock characters: Pierrot in a bowler hat.\n\nChaplin deliberately placed together bits of costuming that seemed at odds with each-other, as both packaging for and signals of his body’s unruly capabilities, his discordant impulses and flashes of anarchy held together only by a tattered pretence of dignity. As well as a statement of character, the Tramp proved to perfectly encapsulate a moment in time, poised between the affectations of one era and another, just as Chaplin himself was poised between two different continental sensibilities in body and the jagged disparities of his life so far. The Tramp’s ideal of a place in a society that constantly rejects him is rooted in the demarcations of Victorian gentlemanliness and his notion of a poised, forbearing, proudly self-contained man of the world, when he is actually a knot of barely controlled impulses in an assembly of op-shop garments, striving in a time when the nominal ideals of class are giving way to mere strata of power and wealth. He might be someone from a good background who’s fallen calamitously, or he might be someone from the bottom desperately trying to mimic what he takes for the aspiration-worthy. As he evolved, the Tramp gained mannerisms that could point in either direction, an edge of pretention in his maintenance of outlandish pride and savoir faire, his curiously pansexual flirtiness often turned on to disarm, floating on a lode of anarchism held at bay only by a sense that his decorum, his remnant pretences, are the only things giving him identity: as long as he has them, he is not yet an actual bum. The Marx Brothers, for instance, can be seen as splitting the Chaplin persona into pieces – the trickster survivor, the dubious traveller, and the chaos-bringing holy fool. Indeed, just about every screen comedian since has drawn on the template Chaplin offered to some degree or another over the intervening decades, but, notably practically no-one has ever come close to successfully mimicking the most essential part of his persona – the part that seemed to be able to become more sympathetic and empathetic the more pathetic he became.\n\nChaplin’s perspective nonetheless was thoroughly that of someone very familiar with being at the bottom of the heap, particularly in his impudent, sometimes quizzical, sometimes downright contemptuous take on authority, his scepticism towards do-gooders, cops of both the legal and moral variety, and his celebration of that tattered pride, that lurching, ever-moving approach to life, somehow both accepting its chaos and rejecting it at the same time. And his audience, the vast bulk of which shared his perspective and experience, loved him for it, for reporting without the usual kind of mediation from above: there is no hint of noblesse oblige in Chaplin’s reportage from the fringe, save the most ironic kind. In any event, Mabel’s Unusual Predicament came out a few days after Chaplin’s second performance in the guise, The Kid Auto Races At Venice, so that film became, as far as viewers were concerned, his debut. Venice in this case being Venice, California. The film was subtitled “Extract from a letter from Charlie Chaplin to his best girl,” a flourish that began the perpetual burring of actor and role together: the Tramp was Charlie Chaplin, and vice versa, at least until Chaplin finally tried to bust out of the association, and paid the price for it. Chaplin was reteamed with Lehrman for The Kid Auto Races At Venice, and Lehrman is listed as the writer and director, although the degree to which either art is applied is debatable. The subject of the movie is already Chaplin’s irrepressible sense of connection to the movie camera, as both subject of its attention and of his fascination. The joke of the short film is straightforward, and exploits a real, unsimulated event, the Junior Vanderbilt Cup, held in Venice, California. This was a rally for “pushcars” with very small, light motors something like modern go-karts but also resembling soapbox racers, starting like those on a ramp for initial propulsion. The race seems to have been a pretty big deal at the time, judging by the audience that’s turned up – a survey of people in their day out finery, a splendid incidental time capsule of both social mores and the environs of Venice in the day.\n\nChaplin, as the film would have it, is attending the races, a little pickled. “I made tracks for the track,” a title card supposedly drawn from Chaplin’s letter announces. The movie opens with a newsreel or documentary-like conceit of simply filming the race, but with Chaplin standing on the edge of the race course near the finish line, watching with wobbly fascination. A cop nudges him and tells him to get out of the way, so Chaplin trots down the course, nearing the camera and noticing he’s being filmed. He seems to be breaking the fourth wall, only for a later shot to reveal that a newsreel crew is shooting the event. Chaplin, intrigued and dosed with Dutch courage, starts pestering the crew, constantly trying to get in front of the camera. His lurching progress up and down the fringe of the race route sees him constantly nearly hit by the racers charging by – I bet the drivers just loved having some random actor lurching in their path. Chaplin becomes so annoying the director becomes increasingly aggressive in clearing him from the proximity. The director is played by Lehrman himself, who might well have been authentically piqued at being handed this freakish, man-sized mass of physical verve and independent wit by Sennett and told to make a movie happen, expected to keep him on the rails and within the margins of the Keystone house style. Within a few seconds of the film’s start, some of Chaplin’s about-to-be-signature mannerisms are apparent. He tries to pull together the front of his jacket, at once too tight and too long, aware he looks a bit slovenly, and then sets himself, stiffening his legs right up to his buttocks, pushing his torso forward a little, as if wanting to project an air of jaunty, hearty insouciance, and trots out of frame, twirling his cane with feverish energy, like he thinks he might possibly whir it fast enough until he takes off like the first helicopter.\n\nThe most telling disparity between the version of the Tramp Chaplin presents in Kid Auto Races At Venice and the more developed persona is the prototype still has one foot unsteadily planted in Chaplin’s drunk act: the Tramp is plainly inebriated, and like many a drunk we’ve all encountered, he becomes fixated on something and can’t leave it alone, the attempts by the director, crew, and cops to move him along only provoking him to further defiance. The costume wasn’t quite complete yet: Chaplin would later go for baggier, freer trousers, where the ones he wears here instead bulge at the front where he’s tied the too-large pants up tightly. The younger Chaplin’s face is slightly heavier, darker and not yet brightened with makeup, his prop moustache a little thicker and bushier. He looks a tad more aggressive and provocative than the Tramp in full flower, and indeed the Tramp proved a little disconcerting to Keystone with his early, slightly fouler edition, which Chaplin would quickly refine into the more familiar, romantic, fool-of-fortune version. Chaplin keeps sticking himself in front of the camera as it surveys the racers lining up to start, the junior drivers with their approximations of manly pith. At another point, the film crew set up further down the road, and Chaplin comes running up in search of them, tripping at some point but recovering and quickly striking a casual pose before the camera, before the director spring out and shoves him away.\n\nChaplin, seemingly sobering up and becoming more artful in what has now become a duel of a kind with the habitual Tramp pride already at stake, postures with billboard advertisement cool as he flicks ash from his cigar and then tosses the butt over his shoulder to kick away with his flicked-up foot. Chaplin’s nerve and skill are instantly apparent, in the way he so casually plays out his comic conceits whilst dodging speeding vehicles and oblivious to the real crowd amused by his antics, sticking to his bit to the end with the dedication of a man who knows life falls to pieces the moment the act stops. The chagrined director at various points shoves him hard out of the way onto the road, and later reaches out and drags him bodily out of the frame, recreating the old vaudevillian joke of the hook reaching out for the unpopular performer. By movie’s end the director has given Chaplin a kick in the pants – a gesture the Tramp would usually be delivering to others later. Chaplin now has licence to jump in close to the camera and gain his revenge by making faces right into the lens, marking the only time the movie shifts from full-body shots to a close-up as Chaplin sneers and twists his nose. A descent into pure, childish antic and defiance, taunting the eye of the device that remains indifferent to him, and through it the world. The End. It feels so perfectly apt that Kid Auto Races At Venice is an overt joke about the whole idea of being in front of a camera and performing for it, blending aspects of documentary and fiction in a manner that feels strangely modern. The oldness of Kid Auto Races At Venice is also its newness: it is simplicity itself. One could easily remake it at any public event with an iPhone. Indeed, just about any TV news broadcast from a public space will pick up its selection of onlookers waving or making faces at the camera.\n\nThe obvious joke to make here is that Charlie Chaplin invent"
