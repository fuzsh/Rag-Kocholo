Despite being approached by a gang of international forgers he keeps his word but soon discovers that his nephew is following his old ways. Keeping his word about going straight, he decides to stop his nephew, however Scotland Yard are in hot pursuit.\n\nCan you help:\n\nIf you have any information regarding this production, the locations or, even better, some comparison shots please contact us. Images submitted must be in Landscape orientation, as would be seen on the cinema screen, not Portrait.\n\nWe are aware that there are films on the site that were added when the criteria for the inclusion of locations was very different from today and, as a result, there may be scenes missing from some productions. Please do not forward additional screen captures to us but bring the detail to our attention, for we do, and are, 're-addressing' these older entries as time allows."
