        "text": "By Soila Kenya and Sam Kombo\n\nAs I scrolled through the r/scifi subreddit sometime last year, I came across a series of AI-generated space colonies made by user u/cmplsv. They are both panoramic scenes of a city at night. The details are endless and the whole landscape just seems so grand and magnificent. It all got me thinking: What is the allure of alien, desert planets? The first and most popular that come to mind are Tatooine and Arrakis from Star Wars and Dune, respectively. Both are hugely successful and endlessly inspirational.\n\nOur Introductions to the Franchises\n\nWe had vastly different routes to these series.\n\nWhile Sam has been a Star Wars kid for almost as long as he can remember, having watched the Star Wars reboot, The Phantom Menace (1999) at a young age, Soila has never really gotten into Star Wars despite being a big fan of the fantastical.\n\nInstead, she found her sci-fi feet with Nnedi Okorafor’s Binti trilogy in 2019, and from there, she realised what she had been missing out on. One thing led to another and she stumbled upon the Dune series, one of the holy grails of modern sci-fi.\n\nSoila: So, I actually am really interested in how those early days of the internet in the sci-fi community were?\n\nSam: I’ve been on the internet for a long time. It was totally the Wild Wild West…\n\nStar Wars was basically the background radiation for a lot of my childhood. As a kid, I couldn’t even remember when The Phantom Menace (1999) was released in cinemas, but the Blockbuster culture of the late 90s and early 2000s is completely incomparable to anything we have today. When a movie was successful, it was SUCCESSFUL, and the return of George Lucas to the big screen was VERY SUCCESSFUL.\n\nI was surrounded by merchandise, action figures, small plastic toys in cereal boxes and restaurant meals, and a Star Wars pillow and duvet so you could appropriately dream of a galaxy far, far away. I’m not surprised in the least that the hype stuck with me, even though I don’t remember my first experience of the film; the memorabilia I had was enough.\n\nWhen I grew older and finally revisited the first movies in the series, I truly fell in love with Star Wars, even buying the novellas which explored the relationship between Obi-Wan Kenobi and his master, Qui-Gon Jinn. And we were getting plenty of new content too, as not too long after the end of the prequel trilogy, the animated series Star Wars: The Clone Wars premiered with a full movie, which I also saw in theatres.\n\nSoila: I legit have no clue about Star Wars except the whole John Boyega and Kelly Marie Tran thing that happened on the internet a few years ago.\n\nSam: That was honestly one of the franchise’s biggest low points if I’m being honest… not just the treatment of the actors, but also the story in general.\n\nSoila: And what about Dune?\n\nSam: OMG. The memes… Dune is such a quotable story and some of the quotes from the books hung around on the internet for so long that they’re basically fossilised, lol. But it honestly made it so much easier to get into because you already know the vibe by the time you’re committing to this two-and-a-half-hour-long movie.\n\nThe Desert Ecology and Environment\n\nIn Dune, the entire series revolves around the desert planet Arrakis which is nicknamed for its most distinctive feature, the dunes. Frank Herbert, who was a journalist, worked in the Gulf and was partially inspired by this landscape when creating his fictional world. It was so intricately woven that ecologists have called it a highly predictive model for environmental concerns of our own planet.\n\nArrakis is hostile in a way completely alien to anyone but its original inhabitants, the Fremen. From sand-walks with no pattern to avoid the attention of the infamous sandworm, to the moisture-trapping suits of the Fremen, Arrakis constantly makes demands of all life on it. This intense detail allows for the creation of culture, and for its visual adaptations, such as the films, a unique architecture that considers the hostility of the planet.\n\nIn this way, the planet Arrakis becomes a character in the book, not merely a setting.\n\nNaturally, works in a similar genre inspire each other. As a result, Dune exists downstream of influential works like Isaac Asimov’s Foundation series, and upstream of pop culture monoliths, such as Star Wars. Dune, which came out in 1965 influenced major elements from Skywalker’s home on Tatooine—including its ecology and environment—to the centrality of age-old political struggles, to the conflicts of the plot.\n\nThroughout the Star Wars series, and more so within the Skywalker saga, Tatooine is a perpetual cradle. A planet where Anakin, and later, his son Luke, are plucked from for them to truly grow into their own in the world beyond Tatooine. This does not mean that the planet is not cruel and hostile, after all, water is scarce and raiders are a dime a dozen; however, the cruelty of Tatooine is primarily a product of the characters who inhabit it.\n\nThe desert, the giant worms, and the hostile environment in Star Wars act as shorthand. They are a familiar entry point, as well as a knowing nod for its original audience in the 1970s, one that is deeply familiar with Dune’s role in the contemporary science fiction canon.\n\nTherefore, audiences in the 2000s and beyond were frequently introduced to Dune by taking the trip upstream. This may be through comparisons of sarlaccs in Star Wars to the giant sandworms of Dune, or through lists upon lists of the art that influenced Star Wars.\n\nThe thoroughly described cultures of these planets affect how we view any desert. Visions of desertic sceneries give feelings of isolation and bring images of space travel, battles with sandworms or sarlaccs, and the technology required to survive such harsh environments. This all raises the experience to another dimension.\n\nFrom Sci-Fi to the Real World\n\nAs much as sci-fi casts you into different universes that supposedly have nothing to do with our realities as humans on planet Earth, there is no way a few real-world dynamics won’t leak into the fictional narratives.\n\nAnd for a desert planet, it’s no leap of the imagination that the creator will draw from Earth-based communities that live in the desert. Unfortunately, Dune was written in the 1960s so that meant a not-insignificant amount of orientalism made its way into the narrative. I talk about this as my main problem with Dune in the YouTube video where I reviewed the book and its various other IPs, including the 2021 movie starring Timothée Chalamet and Zendaya.\n\nIn a twist of fate, however, it turned out that the book that introduced me to American sci-fi, Binti, also has desert imagery and gave me another perspective on the classic setting. Nnedi Okorafor, a Naijamerican, as she calls herself, was inspired by the real-life Himba people of northern Namibia and southern Angola. Almost wholesale, except for the sci-fi elements, she gave the main character, a teenage girl called Binti, this culture.\n\nThe Himba, both fictional and real, apply otjize, a mixture of butterfat and ochre pigment, to protect themselves from the harsh desert climate. When Binti gets accepted into Oomza University to study mathematics—which happens to be on the other side of the galaxy—she immediately begins to worry about how she will maintain her connection to her desert homeland and practices. In this case, the desert is quite literally a part of her. Not only through the otjize but also as her spiritual home.\n\nJust like the Fremen of Arrakis, she and her ancestors had evolved to rely on and live in harmony with this seemingly uninhabitable landscape. Just before she leaves, she even finds an important object in the desert that proves important to her journey, ensuring that the desert connection is never forgotten throughout the narrative.\n\nBefore I knew it, Okorafor had filled in the gap by writing from the point of view of the desert-dweller rather than from the point of view of the outsiders or, if we’re being honest, the invaders, as is the case in Dune. This gave me a whole new perspective and appreciation of desert imagery in a sci-fi setting. I look forward to reading and watching other desert-themed sci-fi such as this short film I discovered recently called The Oceanmaker (2015).\n\nHave you watched or read Star Wars, Dune or Binti? What did you think of them? Or do you have any recommendations for similar-themed sci-fi epics? Sound off in the comments below!"
