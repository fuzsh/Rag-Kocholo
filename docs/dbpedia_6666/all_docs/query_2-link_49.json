        "text": "EVEN MORE SELF LOVE The template and modus operandi are simple. Find 30 or so authors with something to say. No fee. Get them to say it clearly and quickly. Put it together thematically at a cheap price. Some of the writing is superb, some not. We polish it in editing. All of the books are interesting, all have impact, all get plenty of publicity and re-use in the national media. Some are real gems – Lord Leveson read at least one of them-on hacking – in the course of his hacking inquiry. One of the latest, How do we pay for the BBC after 2027? has set the agenda for the BBC licence fee debate. JC - And I’m pleased to say, Bite-Sized Books has played a large part in publishing those books - I believed we’re up to around 30 now out of an extraordinary 60 titles you’ve edited altogether? A sample of John's prolific output. The result of his 'Hackademic' approach; getting 'the great and the good' to contribute their expertise that he combines with his own writing to create timely and highly informative books. JM – Paul Davies must regret meeting me at a Christian Wolmar Book launch in Marylebone. Since then BSB have published 30 Mair edited books. Abramis have published an equivalent number. Recently my own little imprint Mair Golden Moments (the joke is deliberate) has published four or five including one of my favourites ’Boris Johnson. Media Creation, Media Celebrity, Media Casualty’ with a stunning Dean Stockton cover. See: https://lnkd.in/e_FKzPSX I never forget a face or a name of somebody I’ve met socially or professionally. I inveigle many of them to write short essays for the books. No fees remember. In the course of sixty books probably commissioned between 800 and 1000 authors. There is a core group of around 100 who are usually happy to contribute to a Mair volume. They cover not just media but another couple of Mair interests/obsessions. The Guide to the Oxford of Inspector Morse, Lewis and Endeavour is a best seller and in second edition. It led to a packed event in March 2023 in St Barnabas Church in Jericho to mark the end of the TV franchise after close to 100 two-hour films. John on stage with Cara Hunter, the crime writer, at the book launch of MORSE, LEWIS, ENDEAVOUR AND OXFORD - CELEBRATING 35 YEARS ON SCREEN. JC - And I should say, thanks to you so many of your contributors have become authors directly with Bite-Sized Books for which we’re very grateful. JM – I seem to be responsible for at least half the BSB author roster. One short essay for me then a whole book for you Julian. John Redwood, Farukh Dhondy, Liz Gerard, Angela Antetomaso, Vicky Pryce to name a few. Will you ever pay me a Finder’s Fee Julian? JC - Fast forward to 2021 and we came back in contact again? How did that come about?\n\nHow I name my characters (From my \"Blurred Musings\" blog) If there’s an art to picking clever character names, then I am not an artist. In fact, I don’t want to be one. I write about average people, so names like Shadow Moon and Hiro Protagonist are forbidden from my novels. Don’t even get me started on Ender Wiggins. With a few exceptions, function trumps meaning for me, particularly with protagonists. To be frank, I’m more concerned with how fast I can type their names, because I don’t want to be tripping over my fingers when spewing out paragraphs. Kal, Wes, and Alec (from my upcoming series) have a combined letter-count of ten. How’s that for easy? I suspect I’ll never create a character whose name starts with Z, X, or Q. That would give me hand cramps. At the same time, I want my character names to be believable. That requires work. Let me explain... https://lnkd.in/g3sYAjVV\n\nAre your spots going viral? Chances are, if they use the same old rhythms, they’re getting lost no matter how awesome the message. Why not use humor? Science shows that humor creates engagement and turnout. Gotham Studios are Emmy-winning writers and producers from Comedy Central and standup, who want to help you beat your opponent with ads that are replayed, shared, and discussed next week at dinner with friends. We also have four decades of the more serious stuff—documentaries and programming for National Geographic, Today Show, the History Channel, the Olympics. In positive spots, self-deprecating humor can make people smile with your candidate’s warmth, humanity and honesty, and defuse their opponent’s attacks. In attack ads, humor can skewer your opponent for their hypocrisy, while your candidate stands above the fray. Yes, you need your standard spots too. But you're missing a crucial tool in your kit if you're not making people laugh. Use humor and win. Contact Gotham Studios. https://conta.cc/3V2Lnxo\n\nSo how do you keep things interesting? Quentin Tarantino’s 2022 book, Cinema Speculation, goes through the 1970s and early 1980s movies that most inspired him. It’s a thought-provoking, funny and frank view about why that era had some great (and not-so-great) movies. It also helped me better understand the thinking behind one of my favourite movie scenes. In Pulp Fiction, John Travolta’s character Vincent has to take his boss’s wife Mia (Uma Thurman) to dinner. He’s struggling to make conversation. She asks him “So did you think of anything to say?”. He replies, “Actually I did. However, you sound like a really nice person, and I … I don’t want to offend you”. This prompts the line below. I love this line so much that I have it on a post-it next to my desk. It’s a good reminder that sharing ideas means taking a risk. But that’s OK. Better “out” than “in”. Better to share an idea (and risk a reaction) than stick with the usual mindless and boring chit chat (and get no reaction). An idea with a well-crafted opening line. An unexpected thought. Something that takes a risk and isn’t the same old, same old. Something interesting. If this thought interests you, feel free to get in touch for a chat (DM me or use the contact form at www.three-brains.com). I appreciate that it’s not always easy to comment or like stuff on here that’s a bit more unusual (but thanks and kudos to those who have!). I’ll be interested to hear your thoughts."
