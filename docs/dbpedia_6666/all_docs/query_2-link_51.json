        "text": "The White Buffalo is a film that, like so many others, I stumbled across by accident. I was actually looking for movie posters to reference for a drawing project I was working on at the time, and was so intrigued by this one that I had to look deeper into the film. Unfortunately, The White Buffalo is not a movie that gets a lot of attention, even on obscure internet forums.\n\nEven so, after seeing the trailer, I decided to give it a chance and ordered a copy of the Blu Ray from Amazon. When it arrived, I was expecting a mildly entertaining Moby Dick style creature feature set in the wild west. To my surprise, that’s not what I got. Continue reading “Review of The White Buffalo (1977)”\n\nIn my time, I like to think I’ve seen many movies from all across the spectrum. Some were terrible, some glorious, and some somewhere in the middle. Then there are movies like 1981’s Caveman, starring Ringo Starr. Is it good? Not particularly. However, unlike other movies, I’m still not sure whether Caveman is bad based on execution, or just a lack of material to work with from the start. Even so, there might be some fun to be had if you’re in the mood for a dopey comedy that’s fittingly primitive.\n\nContinue reading “Review of Caveman”\n\nIf you think about it, Planet of Dinosaurs is maybe one of the most brilliant titles for a movie ever. To a young mind like mine once was, it creates image to put any prepubescent youth into a near euphoria. Sadly, this movie was difficult to find for several years. However, now with the advent of the internet and the expansive market that it provides, obscure films like this are finally becoming easy to track down and pick up. The only question is whether or not digging Planet of Dinosaurs out was worth it.\n\nContinue reading “Review of Planet of Dinosaurs”\n\nThe second chapter has been added to Godzilla vs Trump. If you’d like to read it, it is posted under The Godzilla Zone, Special and Dusty Reel Comics. I also included the current cover to the 3rd and final chapter, but that will probably take me awhile to finally finish and post. Still, I hope you like what I’ve made so far.\n\nThomas\n\nI first saw Titan A.E. years and years ago. Our baby sitter at the time always brought over some movies to watch. We popped this bad boy in and, lo and behold, our household full of 5-10 year old boys loved it. In truth, I must have watched Titan A.E. 15-20 times since then. That made my recent viewing experience all the more interesting, since it had been at least 5 years since my last viewing. I still feel nostalgic love for it, and it has some great qualities, but the total package is a bit of a mixed back in retrospect.\n\nContinue reading “Review of Titan A.E.”\n\nWhen I was younger, I always wanted to make my own comic book, but I never had the skills or patience to make it very far before everything just fell apart. In the last few years, however, through practice in making cartoons for my high school newspaper and other side projects, I decided to take a few lessons and give it another spin. This is Godzilla vs Trump. Continue reading “Godzilla vs Trump Comic”\n\nDue to some events and shifts in my personal life, I haven’t had the opportunity to post for awhile. Now that everything has calmed down a tad, I’ll be getting back to more frequent posts. However, for those of you who kept visiting and patiently waiting for new content, I wanted to jump back in with something different. Introducing Special Reviews (marked as Special under categories) which will be reviews and posts will be made that don’t necessarily fit with The Dusty Reel’s usual content. As a first item in the section, we’re going to look at Boom! Studios recent 12 issue comic series, Kong of Skull Island. Continue reading “Review of Kong of Skull Island (Boom! Studios)”\n\nI had never actually heard of Spacehunter: Adventures in the Forbidden Zone, until I bought it in a DVD Double Pack with Krull (the movie I actually wanted to get). When I saw the pack on Amazon for under $5, I thought “wow, I can get a movie I’ve always wanted to see with something totally new!” Interestingly, I saw this one first. Sadly, I wasn’t a huge fan of it. However, I have a two viewings rule before I review anything which meant that I would have to give Spacehunter a second chance before hammering down the last nail in its coffin. The only question is, was it worth it?\n\nContinue reading “Review of Spacehunter: Adventures in the Forbidden Zone”\n\nKrull is one of those films that just has such a uniquely awesome concept to it. I mean, come on, aliens invading a knights of the round table esque world? There’s no way this isn’t good action cheesy fun. Then I watched it and was…not quite sure what to think. I certainly liked things about it, but the film was way more serious than I expected. However, as mentioned before, I have a policy that I must see a movie at least two times before reviewing it. At the second viewing, knowing what to expect, I enjoyed Krull much more for what it was trying it be, and not for what I wanted it to be. It’s not perfect, but has enough merit to warrant fans of 80s fantasy checking it out.\n\nContinue reading “Review of Krull”\n\nGames aren’t something I associate with myself as much as movies, but I’ve played my fair share. As a lifelong Godzilla fan, when I was younger, I was always fascinated with the idea of a Godzilla video game. As most of you likely know, they have generally been less than stellar, but that didn’t keep me from giving them a whirl. Godzilla, Monster of Monsters for the NES was probably my first play at one and, while it is very much flawed, it is interesting and worth a look for fans of Toho’s science fiction films from the 60s and early 70s.\n\nContinue reading “Review of Godzilla NES”"
