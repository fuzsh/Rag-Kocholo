Realising the more ashes he consumes, mixed with the ever-growing quantity of drugs, the more vivid Ashleigh becomes… and the longer she stays.

Dusty doesn’t hold back. reunited again, they proceed to have the time of their lives. To reach Ashleigh, he takes his body and mind to places they were never meant to go, bringing him to the brink of survival. Rock bottom looming, Dusty’s the only one who can save himself from complete self destruction.

Grief, intense sorrow, the loss of a loved one, is something every human being experiences in their lifetime.

How each of us copes with it is what varies dramatically. Dusty is a deeply personal and courageous story written by my incredibly talented dear friend, Travis Jeffery.

It’s been an absolute honour to step behind the camera for the first time with such an empowered, professional and passionate team of creatives and bring this story to life. I truly believe taking on such a universal and crucial subject matter opened the door for good Karma throughout the filmmaking process. So, take a seat, strap yourselves into our Dusty rollercoaster, and be prepared to be punched in the heart!
