        "text": "Synthesizing political, anthropological and psychological perspectives, this book addresses the everyday causes and appeal of long-term involvement in extreme political violence in urban Pakistan. Taking Pakistan’s ethno nationalist Mohajir party, the Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) as a case study, it explores how certain men from the ethnic community of Mohajirs are recruited to the roles and statuses of political killers, and sustain violence as a primary social identity and lifestyle over a period of some years. By drawing on detailed fieldwork in areas involved in the Karachi conflict, the author contributes to understandings of violence, tracing the development of violent aspects of Mohajir nationalism via an exploration of political and cultural contexts of Pakistan’s history, and highlighting the repetitive homology of the conflict with the earlier violence of Partition. Through a local comparison of ethnic and religious militancy she also updates the current situation of social and cultural change in Karachi, which is dominantly framed in terms of Islamist radicalization and modernization. In her examination, governance and civil society issues are integrated with the political and psychological dimensions of mobilization processes and violence at micro-, meso- and macro- levels. This book injects a critical and innovative voice into the ongoing debates about the nature and meaning of radicalization and violence, as well as the specific implications it has for similar, contemporary conflicts in Pakistan and the developing world.\n\nOn August 22nd 2016 Altaf Hussain, the leader of the MQM, made anti-Pakistani claims during his address to his supporters in Pakistan. This was followed by attacks on various media houses by MQM workers. The next month Farooq Sattar, one of the leaders of MQM, excommunicated Hussain from the party because of his expression of anti-Pakistani sentiment. This led to the division of the mainstream party MQM in to two: (1) MQM-L and (2) MQM-P. This vocalization of anti-Pakistani sentiment is a result of the greater process of nation building, which has kept identities polarized against each other since the advent of Pakistan. Adopted from the colonial masters the tools, which the state uses to govern are essentially an extension of the divide and rule policy of the colonial masters. Muhajir identity, as a political identity, which has been for long equated to the political party MQM, has been symbolically dismantled following the split of MQM. This thesis explores the various dynamics and transformations of the Muhajir identity, in the context of Pakistan, from its advent. The thesis tries to submerge the understanding of the Muhajir identity in to the understanding of the Pakistani nation-state.\n\nKarachi has roots in a history of competing claims of ownerships. The central – and provincial government’s conflicts and tensions over asserting control over the city, as well as the political feuds among the parties having representation in different ethnic communities have transformed the city through various phases of transitions and transformations during the years. Chronic violence has always been a permanent trait of politics in the city. Rivalries and distrust among various communities, social classes, ethnic groups and religious sects have consistently been dividing the city along these lines. State-backed enterprise of religious militancy for achieving strategic and political objectives through violence has resulted in the emergence of home grown Jihadi groups with ideologues such as Mufti Ahmadur Rehman, Mufti Rasheed Ahmed Ludhianvi (AlRasheed Trust) and Mufti Nizamuddin Shamezai. The Upper tier and mid-level leadership of these groups come from the vast network of religious seminaries across the city. The fact that recruits are coming from all the ethnic groups, has made the city a capital of militancy; providing a major part of the jihadis’ financial resources through voluntary donations, intimidation of businessmen and traders, as well as a complex network of financial crimes. Sectarian differences have never been settled. In fact, they can be traced to the long history of religious and political conflicts and contradicting interpretations of historic incidents. But acts of terrorism against minority sects are an extension to, and a facet of the enterprise of jihad. It emanates from the same network of religious seminaries in the city, while the ability to inflict violence comes from their training in camps run by jihadi groups. On the other hand, Karachi has been a killing and dumping place not only for deranged militants of various factions of the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan, but also for activists of Baloch nationalist groups rebelling against the Pakistani State from the neighboring province of Baluchistan; mutilated dead bodies have been found at the outskirts of the 4 city, as well as in the bordering territories of the adjacent district of Lasbella, Baluchistan. Targeted operations by the Police and paramilitary forces, the Rangers, have triggered political discontent in the ranks and files of the largest political party of the city, Mohajir Qaumi Movement (MQM), as well as within the various factions of the Taliban. The Taliban have thus tabled a list of demands before the ongoing bid of talks with the government. Stopping law enforcement agencies from killing their detained militants is on the top of the list of demands. The conflict in Karachi portrays the overall condition of what has been going wrong at the central level and what will come in the near future, when the United States and its allies are withdrawing from Afghanistan. Various jihadi groups linked to the military establishment and intelligence agencies have escalated their activities in the city in order to make new alignments for jihad on the old fronts of Kashmir and Afghanistan; as well as the new battlefields of Syria and Myanmar."
