        "text": "Thanks to the support of Lilly Endowment Inc. and Wake Forest University, the Educating Character Initiative (ECI) has awarded $15.6 million in Institutional Impact Grants to 24 projects among 29 colleges and universities seeking to undertake a substantial and sustained effort to educate character in undergraduate populations across their institutions. These three-year grants range from $100,000 to $1 million. They will provide support to enable institutional leaders, faculty, and staff to infuse character in undergraduate curricula and programming in ways that align organically with their mission, context, and culture.\n\nWith the addition of $2.1 million in Capacity-Building Grants awarded in June, the Educating Character Initiative will provide grants totalling over $17.7 million to 71 institutions in 2024. This year, the ECI was able to award more Institutional Impact Grants than anticipated, thanks to a generous commitment from Lilly Endowment Inc. last month.\n\n“We are thrilled to see the creativity and commitment of so many colleges and universities who want to educate character at such a critical time in our society,” said Michael Lamb, the executive director of the Program for Leadership and Character, of which the ECI is a part. “Character education is not one-size-fits all, so we’re excited to learn from the initiatives that this impressive group of institutions will undertake. We are grateful to Lilly Endowment Inc. for supporting this national community and eager to see its impact on the future of higher education.”\n\nA wide range of public and private colleges and universities––representing diverse populations of students, institutional types, and disciplinary orientations––submitted innovative proposals to develop or expand character education efforts at their institutions. Recipients of Institutional Impact Grants include major research universities, liberal arts colleges, Asian American and Native American Pacific Islander-Serving Institutions, Hispanic-Serving Institutions, religiously affiliated colleges, multi-institutional collaborations, a Historically Black University, two military academies, and universities serving large populations of first-generation college students.\n\n“Beth Purvis and I are grateful for and impressed by the exceptional quantity and quality of proposals we received this cycle,” said Jennifer Rothschild, incoming Director of the Educating Character Initiative. “Our entire ECI team is excited to support these grantees as they deepen our collective understanding of character and expand the capacity to educate character in their respective undergraduate institutions across the country.”\n\nImpact Grant Awards\n\nThe list of institutions receiving 2024 Institutional Impact Grants, along with the names of their projects and project leaders, are included below:\n\nArizona State University\n\nCultivating Civic, Moral, and Epistemic Virtues\n\nAmong Undergraduates in Arizona’s Public Universities\n\nJoan McGregor, Tyler DesRoches, Cristy Guleserian, and Juliann Vitullo\n\nBelmont University\n\nLeading With Character and Purpose\n\nNathan Webb and Lori Baker\n\nBrandeis University\n\nDeveloping Just Actors and a Just Community:\n\nCharacter Education as Active Participation and Respectful Inclusion at Brandeis\n\nAnita Hill and Daniel Kryder\n\nCampbell University\n\nCharacter, Initiative, and Calling:\n\nEducating Leaders for Purposeful Lives and Meaningful Service\n\nFaithe Beam and Borrée Kwok\n\nCatholic University of America\n\nThe Catholic University of America Virtue and Character Initiative\n\nPeter Kilpatrick, Andrew V.

The broader aspiration is to foster a robust network that recognizes the value of educating character within higher education. ECI is hosting a number of opportunities for faculty and staff at Wake Forest and beyond through the end of 2024, including webinars, campus visits, and a major international conference in December featuring keynote speaker Jesmyn Ward. For more information on these events, and how to join the ECI community, email us at ECI@wfu.edu.\n\nAbout The Program for Leadership and Character\n\nThe mission of the Program for Leadership and Character is to inspire, educate and empower leaders of character to serve humanity. Through innovative teaching, creative programming, and cutting-edge research, we aim to transform the lives of students, foster an inclusive culture of leadership and character, and catalyze a broader public conversation that places character at the center of leadership.\n\nWith the creation of a network of interested institutions and educators, the development and dissemination of research and resources, the organization of conferences and convenings, and the direct awarding of grants to individuals and institutions, the Program for Leadership and Character aspires to nurture a creative, compassionate, and collaborative community of educators who can learn from each other as partners in character education."
