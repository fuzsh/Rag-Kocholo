        "text": "THE PLEASURE OF HIS COMPANY, coasting into 23rd place in 1961 by grossing $9,000,000, is another of the many comedies of manners & morals that show their age through the scripting, and are best enjoyed as nostalgia. Fred Astaire plays a wandering, work-shy sophisto-cat who shows up at the home of his ex-wife (Lilli Palmer) to attend, and meddle in, the marriage of their daughter (Debbie Reynolds).\n\nFred hasn’t seen Deb for years, and she’s about to marry a yahoo (Tab Hunter) whose insight into The Good Life is limited to things that pertain to his breed bulls; he’s a cattleman.\n\nRather lengthy at 115 minutes, it’s expensively decked out; the costume design and set decor are plush. The four stars are deft, and there are good moments from Gary Merrill as Palmer’s current husband, and Charlie Ruggles as Palmer’s dad.\n\nBut all the expense and expertise add up to little more than trivia, written by Samuel A. Taylor directed by George Seaton."
