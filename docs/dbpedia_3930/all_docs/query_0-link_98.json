        "text": "Sandy Cowell said on 14/Jun/17\n\nSo this lady was in 'The Boys From Brazil'! What a great film that was, and I have a copy just waiting to be watched, so when I do, I can check out Lilli Palmer's height, not to mention the other little details that make each person an individual.\n\nUntil then, I will vote for Lilli to be 5ft3.5 as stated by one of the two articles mentioned above, the other placing her at 5ft4.\n\nThe reasons I have gone for the lower height are because a) as she was around in the 50's, and fully grown, she must be getting on now (sorry Lilli - it happens to us all!), and b) there is only the one box, so we don't have the opportunity to do a 'peak' and a 'now'.\n\nI have learned something about her today as well; I never knew Lilli was German, but I have heard of her, so I felt I was entitled to vote for her! Ha ha ha!"
