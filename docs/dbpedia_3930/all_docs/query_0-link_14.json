        "text": "Commentary\n\nPogo finally arrives at Jim and Katharine’s beautiful home, unannounced and eager to surprise everyone. He demands a room overlooking the San Francisco Bay from their Chinese houseboy, Toy (Harold Fong). The faithful servant protests, but after Pogo speaks to him in his native tongue and gives him a generous cash tip, Toy has been won over!\n\nJessica has been following her father’s adventures around the world through newspaper clippings and pictures. Pogo comes back into his daughter’s life after being away for 17 years, bearing gifts and just as charming as she imagined. He has a present for her mother and a very expensive gift for Jessica, an heirloom emerald and pearl necklace that his grandmother instructed him to give to someone she would have loved. Pogo had given it to Katharine on the eve of their wedding, but he took it with him when they separated.\n\nPogo takes Jessica sightseeing around San Francisco, including out dining and dancing with her fiancé, down-to-earth cattle rancher Roger Henderson (Tab Hunter), in tow. She is entranced with his charm and worldly ways, but Roger does not share her admiration for her father’s footloose lifestyle and fondness for extravagance. Likewise, Pogo is not particularly impressed by Roger. He is polite to the young man, but he doesn’t think he is good enough for his daughter. He subtly tries to sway Jessica away from Roger.\n\nIn the movie, Pogo finally has to accept the fact that he came back into Jessica’s life too late to enjoy a close relationship with his daughter. He has come back to give away something he never had. You feel very sorry for him because he traded the joys of fatherhood for the pleasures of this world. It’s true that it was a decision he made, but now that he is a more mature man, he regrets leaving Katharine and Jessica. He admits to his ex-wife that he is corroded with regret. Katharine is very surprised to hear him admit it.\n\nMy grandfather similarly felt a lot of regret about missing major events in my mother’s life, such as her musical performances over the years, her high school and college graduations, and her wedding.\n\nIt is sweet to see the warm relationship Jessica has with her father, despite the long separation. She has no anger toward him and holds no feelings of abandonment. In fact, she is completely enamored by him. My mother was also able to establish a nice relationship with her father for 17 years, until his death.\n\nIs there a classic movie that reminds you of your life?\n\nThis movie isn’t available for streaming, but there are several free copies on YouTube. You can also buy it on DVD from eBay."
