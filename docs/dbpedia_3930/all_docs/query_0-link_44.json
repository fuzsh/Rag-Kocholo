        "text": "Tab Hunter's time at the top was brief. He was Warners Bros' most popular star from 1955 to 1959, and WB was intent on making him and Natalie Wood the William Powell and Myrna Loy of the teen set. They were to star in five pictures together, but after the second one flopped (\"The Girl He Left Behind\"), Hunter backed out of the third, \"Bombers B-52,\" which ended future pairings of the two.\n\nHunter also had a successful recording career on the Dot label, but this angered Jack Warner, who wanted a big cut of the pie. Warner banned Dot from putting out Hunter's second album, and created the Warner Bros music label specifically for Hunter. But Hunter barely saw a dime from these recordings and Hunter soured on the whole WB deal altogether and rebelled. Warner retaliated by bringing in Troy Donahue from Universal and giving him the young male lead parts. In 1959, Tab bought out his WB contract and went freelance, but never again had the level of success he had at Warner Bros.\n\nIf he'd stayed at Warner Bros, he probably would have been stuck in \"A Summer Place\" and Parrish\"----campy soap operas. He was a better actor than Troy Donahue, but that isn't saying much. He might have wound up with a more successful tv series (Warner cycled their contract players through tv and movies more than some other studios), instead he had a one season show with a weak time slot.\n\nI saw him when he was promoting his biopic. I don't think he had a big head at all. He seemed fairly realistic about his talent and career. The biopic was based on his autobio which was written to get out ahead of someone else's bio of him that was never published. There are some sections of the book & film that seem a bit elipitical--esp. around his relations with his brother and the period after he was no longer a tv or movie property.\n\nHe was well-cast in Damn Yankees, and held his own well. He was pretty much the only one who didn't do the show on Broadway, so there was some natural resentment on the part of the cast that he \"took\" Stephen Douglass' role. Of course, Hollywood was never gonna use him. Gwen Verdon almost missed out on the chance to recreate her own start turn. Tab may not have been the world's greatest actor, but he was right for the role, and it played to his strengths -especially his all-American looks and general likability.\n\nOf course, anyone with an eye had to know that he was gay! The first time I saw the movie, I totally believed that young Joe loves his wife, and wasn't interested in Lola \"that way\" which meant either Tab Hunter was a very fine actor, or Tab Hunter was gay.\n\nWho do you think would have gotten the Lola part(which Gwen probably got because of Troy Donohue starring in the movie as box office insurance.)? Gwen was not pretty enough for a role like that on camera. Cyd Charisse would have been a possibility but she was still firmly at Metro doing things like Meet Me in Las Vegas and Silk Stockings. John Raitt was a mistake in Pajama Game. Doris wipes him off the screen. It needed a Keel or MacRae both of whom had the chops for the role. Haney wasn't pretty enough for her role and Shirley or Mitzi would have been perfect. Both films I believe were not the hits that were expected though they did respectably.\n\nNot a movie, but Tab and Tallulah starred in the 2nd Broadway run of 'The Milk Train Doesn't Stop Here Anymore' in 1964, with Tony Richardson directing. It was a complete flop, lasting only x5 performances. The hooting and hollering gays were in full force for those five performances, though...how I'd kill to travel back in time and see it, just for kicks.\n\nBTW, I had Tab sign a Tab can in 2016 while he was promoting his bio in Palm Springs. He couldn't have been nicer...a stand-up guy.\n\nTallulah was a complete pain in the ass during rehearsals and previews for \"Milk Train...\" She completely ignored Richardson's direction, constantly interrupted the other actors line readings with idle chatter, was consistently late to the set, and was locked in an upstaging duel with veteran actress Ruth Ford. Tab let it be known he wasn't a fan of Tallu, especially after she told the press when questioned about Tab's sexuality, \"Well, I don't know, dahling, he never sucked my cock!\" When the show opened on Broadway, Tallu camped it up for her gays in the audience. With them hooting and hollering at their idol's double-entendres and knowing deliveries, Tab finally realized why Tallu wasn't invested in putting on a great play. They were merely props for her one-woman show.\n\nR9\n\n[quote] I've always wondered if The Pleasure of his Company is any good. Great cast.\n\nTab doesn't have much to do here because the great chemistry is between Fred Astaire and Lilli Palmer who plays his ex-wife and mother to their daughter Debbbie Reynolds.\n\nPlot: Famous globetrotter father \"Pogo\" Poole (Astaire) returns to the USA (San Francisco) because his daughter (whom he hasn't seen for years, since she was little) is getting married. Ex-wife Lilli is now long married to wealthy Gary Merrill (stepfather to Debbie Reynolds) and they live in a great San Francisco mansion together with Lilli's father played by Charles Ruggles, who watches the ensuing action and comments from the side. The San Francisco family has left messages for Pogo all over the world telling him about the upcoming nuptias but discouragingly have received no reply.\n\nWhen Pogo returns unexpectedly and moves into their home he proceeds to take over (a bit of \"The Man Who Came to Dinner\"). He charms and is charmed by his now grown daughter and is less than enthused over her fiance, a local rancher, played by Tab Hunter. Watched skeptically by his knowing ex-wife, Pogo would like nothing better than to go off globetrotting with his beautiful daughter in spite of the planned approaching nuptials.\n\nNot much for Tab to do, but he's OK in this. The real charm, though, is Astaire and Palmer, with worried frustration played by Merrill and Ruggles doing the comments from the sidelines. Debbie Reynolds is OK as the bride and she has some nice moments with Astaire when her wish to have him there for the wedding comes true.\n\nNice, likeable film.\n\nBeautiful clothes, sets and San Francisco. Made in 1961."
