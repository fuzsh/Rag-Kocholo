Actress Born Lilli Peiser on May 24, 1914 in Posen, Germany

Lilli Palmer was a spirited and beautiful stage and film actress who in her middle years became a bestselling author.

In 1945, she accompanied her husband, Rex Harrison, to Hollywood where he was under contract, and a film they had made together in England as "The Rake's Progress" was released in this country as "Notorious Gentleman." Its success put her in demand and she was cast opposite Gary Cooper in "Cloak and Dagger," a wartime spy thriller about the Office of Strategic Services.

She made 50 films, among them "My Girl Tisa," the acclaimed "Body and Soul" in which she and John Garfield gave film-goers a look at the seamy side of boxing; "The Pleasure of His Company" with Fred Astaire in 1961, and "The Four Poster," for which she won the best actress award at the International Film Festival in Venice, Italy, in 1953.

Her last novel, "Night Music" was published in 1983. Art Seidenbaum, then book editor for The Times, noted simply: "A writer is at work here."
