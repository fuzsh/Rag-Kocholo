        "text": "Hulu has announced the release date for another new movie shot in Syracuse.\n\n“Sex Appeal,” the latest film from Liverpool, N.Y.-based American High, will premiere Jan. 14, 2022, on the streaming service.\n\nThe teen sex comedy stars Mika Abdalla (”Project MC2″) as a high school student whose long-distance boyfriend wants to take their relationship to the next level at an upcoming STEM conference (“nerd prom”), so she sets out to master her sexuality as a scientific experiment with help from her best friend Larson (“A.N.T. Farm” actor Jake Short). Avery’s study soon leads to the realization that there’s more to sex, and love, than mechanics: Relationships require both head and heart.\n\nThe cast includes Paris Jackson, the model-actress daughter of late pop singer Michael Jackson; comedians Margaret Cho and Fortune Feimster; “Westworld” actress Rebecca Henderson; and “It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia” fan favorite Artemis Pebdani.\n\n“Sex Appeal” is produced by Jeremy Garelick, Will Phelps and Ryan Bennett for American High, Mark Fasano and Tobias Weymar for Nickel City, Kendrick Tan for Lit Entertainment, and Michael Glassman for LD Entertainment. Talia Osteen directed the film, written by Tate Hanyock, who also executive produced.\n\nOsteen, whose credits include the HBO documentary “Blindsided” and the award-winning short “The Shabbos Goy,” told syracuse.com | The Post-Standard that she’s excited to create a “sex-positive” teen comedy from a female perspective.\n\n“It’s a hilarious, poignant, irreverent and very current script with a wonderful cast that we put together,” Osteen said.\n\n“I want to make sure that this movie reflects... the multitude of experiences and perspectives on sex and love and being a teenager. And talks about it in a way that is not shaming or judgmental for people... wherever they are in their journey,” she added. “It’s fun, sex-positive and it’s ultimately a movie about vulnerability, and learning how to let your guard down and the highs and lows of love and relationships and connections and life and how scary it may be.”\n\n“Sex Appeal” is part of a reported eight-picture deal with Hulu, which also released American High titles “Plan B,” “The Binge,” “Big Time Adolescence,” and “The Ultimate Playlist of Noise.” All were filmed at the former A.V. Zogg Middle School in Liverpool, now known as Syracuse Studios; Garelick bought the school in 2017 for $1 million, and has used it as the headquarters for 12 movies filmed in Central New York over the past four years."
