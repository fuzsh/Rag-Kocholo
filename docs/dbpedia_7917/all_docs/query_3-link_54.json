        "text": "The sex scene is a difficult – and controversial – art to master. Get it wrong and you could go down in history as a laughing stock (looking at you, The Idol). But get it right and, as well as being drafted into the horny hall of fame, you’ll have succeeded in capturing life’s most enigmatic and intimate experiences – all made in what is usually the least sexy setting possible.\n\nAs it takes a lot to achieve such a feat (and for a handful of other reasons, too), the last decade has left us with a dearth of pulse-racing sex on screen. Not just that, but before intimacy coordinators started appearing on set in 2017 – off the back of the #MeToo movement – off-screen protocol also left much to be desired.\n\nAll of that appears to be changing, though. These days, TV shows are inundated with sex scenes – Normal People, Bridgerton, Sex Education, the list goes on – many of which are nuanced, spine-tinglingly authentic, and even groundbreaking. This year, the silver screen caught up with a bang, with the likes of Passages, All of Us Strangers, and Netflix’s Fair Play all boasting masterful steamy moments.\n\nIn light of this carnal resurgence, facilitated by a new host of intimacy experts, you might be wondering: how exactly is the, erm, sausage made?\n\nTo find out, we asked director Sheree Folkson, who, along with intimacy coordinator Lizzy Talbot, is behind Daphne and Simon’s first sex scene in Bridgerton, and pioneering intimacy coordinator Ita O’Brien, of Normal People, It’s A Sin, and I May Destroy You fame, to walk us through the ins and outs of prepping, shooting, and wrapping a sex scene.\n\nHow a sex scene is planned\n\nIn O’Brien’s ideal scenario, the intimacy coordinator would also be involved from the first reading of the script, just like a fight choreographer or stunt coordinator would be. “If we’re in at the beginning, we can help with a clear breakdown of the intimate content, which goes out to casting directors and agents,” she says. “[This can help actors trust that] producers are intending to work with best practice.”\n\nOnce the cast is solidified, Folkson explains that the director will share their vision with the actors and the intimacy coordinator, noting that she never talks to actors about sex without the intimacy coordinator present. “I talk to them about what I’m trying to achieve, what I want the scene to look like, and what we might reveal,” she says. “After we’ve all agreed, the intimacy coordinator puts it in writing.”\n\n“Our role is to support the actor-director process,” adds O’Brien. “We listen, support, and lift what they create. Then we establish agreement and consent to touch, so asking, ‘Are you happy with sexual content? What body parts are you happy – and not happy – to show?’. And then we choreograph that really clearly.”\n\nThe intimacy coordinator also liaises closely with other departments, including the costume designers to decide what modesty garments are needed, location scouts to draw up risk assessments and close public sets, and medics if, say, the actors are shooting in cold weather or water. “This way, by the time you come to set, everything’s understood and prepared, and you can hit the ground running for a smooth day on set,” says O’Brien. A pre-shoot rehearsal – in which actors discuss and learn the choreography – helps with this, too.\n\nAnd, action! What happens on the day\n\nSex scenes are always filmed on a closed set, meaning the only people either in the room or watching on monitors tend to be the actors, a camera operator, the director, and the intimacy coordinator. “If there’s any degree of nudity, you’ve got ‘camera rolling’, sound, and then the last thing that happens is pull robes, action, and then into the choreography,” says O’Brien. As well as modesty garments, like flesh-coloured shorts, actors are provided with padding to protect them from any unwanted and unplanned intimate contact.\n\n“When we had the actual sex [in Bridgerton], we used one handheld camera,” reveals Folkson. “The director of photography was operating because we needed precision, and we’d discussed in detail what he was going to do.”\n\nDuring filming, O’Brien says a lot of what the intimacy coordinator does is watching for impulses from the actor. “You listen to what someone says, the words they use and how they say it, but you’re also listening to the body – what’s happening to it, if there’s any tension. It takes somebody to be quite self-aware to be able to trust their boundaries and then articulate them clearly, so you observe, share what you’ve noticed, get clarity, and then make sure those requirements are listened to and put in place.”\n\nShe continues: “We say consent is a process not a moment. A yes is a yes, a no is a no, and a maybe is also a no. But something that was a no might become a yes; [the actor] might be on set and say, ‘Actually, that’s fine’.” O’Brien also puts a timeout in place, so the cast can pick a word that will pause the action for any reason, and it has to be respected. “The actor has total autonomy to halt the action.”\n\nThen, when the director calls cut, nobody moves until the costume department has come in to put the actors’ robes on. “Then the director can give notes, the lighting can be changed, and whatever else [is needed],” says O’Brien.\n\nFolkson says the pre-shoot work that the actors and crew do, including extensive discussions and regimented choreography, tends to alleviate a lot of the uncertainty, awkwardness, and discomfort that used to exist during these scenes. “I’ve been directing for a long time and it never used to be like this,” she reflects. “It was much more haphazard. We’d turn up on the day, talk about it, then shoot it. I’d try to make it as nice as possible, but really it was awful for the actors and awful for me.”\n\nStill, she adds: “I do try to get through it as quickly and efficiently as possible. I make it like a technical exercise. There’s nothing sexy about it.”\n\nThe post-sex (scene) clean-up\n\nIf filming has been scheduled well, the actors won’t have to film another scene immediately after a sex scene. “Just as we’ve done the journey of stepping into the scene, it’s really important to step away,” explains O’Brien. “Sometimes I’ll do a physical release with the actors, like a shakedown or the act of taking your character costume off and putting your own clothes on – making it a clear ritual that you’re stepping away from character.”\n\nAs for the tapes of the meticulously-planned scene, Folkson says none of them are released, except to the director and editor – that is, until the date of the premiere."
