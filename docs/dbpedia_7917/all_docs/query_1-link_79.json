        "text": "With a tagline like “Dying To Show You a Good Time,” Ti West’s “X” was bound to be a gem in the erotic thriller genre.\n\n*SLIGHT-SPOILERS AHEAD (SORRY)*\n\nA typical 1970s period era Texas slasher film has to have a few things: A small town sheriff! An old creepy couple in a house in the middle of nowhere! Cocaine! A shaggin’ waggin! And porn stars!\n\nDirector Ti West’s newest film, “X”, has all these essential elements. The picture begins with a salacious Scooby–Doo gang deciding to leave Houston to head out in the country to begin shooting a smut film, “The Farmer’s Daughters.”\n\nBut as the group arrives, something seems amiss with the couple owning the property they’re shooting on.\n\nThis A24 production stars indie icon and former Miu Miu girl Mia Goth, who has kept her pattern of portraying these darker, it-girl roles. Her former films include Luca Guadagnino’s remake of “Suspiria” and Lars von Trier’s “Nymphomaniac.”\n\nGoth plays two characters: Maxine Minx, a young woman determined to create a name for herself in the porn world — a Linda Lovelace kind of star — and Pearl, the hopelessly romantic killer antagonist. The actress wears prosthetic makeup to make herself look ghostly. Her partner-in-crime is her husband Howard, played by Australian actor Stephen Ure.\n\nThe supporting cast includes newly-pronounced Scream Queen Jenna Ortega, fresh off her role in this year’s “Scream.” Ortega plays Lorraine, the sheepish girlfriend of RJ Nichols, the self proclaimed “good dirty movie” cinematographer who is played by Owen Campbells. Brittany Snow from “Pitch Perfect” shows her range in emulating the captivating and erotic Bobby-Lynn. The imaginative genius Scott Mescudi (aka Kid Cudi) plays the film’s male pornstar, Jackson Hole, and former-fake-doctor-on-“Grey’s Anatomy”, Martin Henderson plays Southern adult film producer, Wayne Gilroy.\n\nThe film first debuted at South by Southwest in early March, and captivated audience members with its horror mixed with niche actors and a splash of executive production from virally hated creator of “Euphoria” Sam Levinson, who’s infamous for television shows and movies that are just expensive music videos with fancy makeup, and inserting unnecessary sex scenes. It had all been bundled into the perfect cinematic birthday gift; just in time for my 20th.\n\n“X” is a sharp homage to “The Texas Chainsaw Massacre,” but separates itself into its own realm through artistic style, pacing and decisions to create humanity and a psyche for its characters. It also wasn’t an hour-and-a-half of the characters running around… which takes up the majority of scenes in Tobe Hooper’s 1974 classic.\n\nThe central themes West zones in on are about aging, sex and inclinations of the past.\n\nSplit-screen scenes comparing the contrast between Maxine and Pearls’ first interaction, and the beginning of the porn movies lemonade scene with Bobby-Lynne and Jackson, illustrated the eagerness of Pearl’s wish to be youthful again and the couples ability to still have sex — which Pearl’s declining husband Howard is incapable of.\n\nOr when Pearl sees Maxine filming her porn scene in the barn and is aroused; a spark was relit in her. Pearl then proceeds to ask her lover to pay attention to and affirm her, which he doesn’t (this causes problems down the line. You know, the whole murderous rampage thing).\n\nThis was a turning point in the film where I realized that:\n\n“Ohh, the plot was basically about what could happen if you don’t give your girl dick.”\n\nAnd I know that sounds ridiculous, but hear me out. Pearl, throughout the film, shows interest in Maxine’s physical appearance, even confiding to the young adult film rookie that she was once young and beautiful too.\n\nBut Maxine, along with other characters in the film such as Howard, RJ and Bobby-Lynn, are cruel to her, underestimating how far Pearl is willing to go to have sex and feel desirable. Simultaneously, she is obsessed with youth and perfection. That ends up being the reason Pearl targets Maxine in the first place. She views a sense of her younger self within Maxine, hence West’s directorial decision for Goth to play both characters.\n\nI mean the woman tries to kiss RJ and he rejects her, and then begins treating her like an old lady. So she murders him?? She also climbs into bed with Maxine and starts cuddling her??? Uh… uncalled for Pearl…The decision to make Pearl murderous becuase she was horny is outlandish.\n\n“X” had a few moments that were irrelevant.\n\nOne in particular was a montage of Pearl getting ready, being depressed because she gets none and crying in her sleep while Jackson and Bobby-Lynn perform a useless cover of Fleetwood Mac’s “Landslide” to the “bang gang” in the boarding house (I will never listen to it the same way anymore now. Thanks). Many audience members held their breath trying to contain their laughter during this.\n\nDespite the few flaws, “X” has reimagined the slasher film genre. The movie finishes with a preview of the prequel titled “Pearl.” Fans of the former will be able to learn Pearl’s story as Goth reprises her role.\n\nWith a whopping 96% on Rotten Tomatoes, “X” has met strong reviews and praise for its revival of horror.\n\nIt’s hard to disagree. As the genre has become extremely predictable and repetitive, it is uncommon to see a new horror story that not only has created its own aesthetic but pays respectable homage to films such as “Psycho,” “Boogie Nights” and “The Shining.” West was able to recreate and perfect what a true horror film deserves; its own identity.\n\nCorrection: A previous version of this article incorrectly referenced the 1970s porn star “Linda Lovelace” as “Linda Lovegood.”"
