        "text": "It’s been nearly a decade since the last American Pie film was released. While the first film, released in 1999, was a box office success, none of the subsequent sequels and spinoffs have been as successful critically and commercially. In the sex comedy genre, all American Pie films focus on a group of high school students (mainly men) that want to have sex with certain women in their lives. This recurring trend of men fantasizing and wanting to seduce women appeared in all 8 of the American Pie films until the release of the ninth film just a few days ago.\n\nIn American Pie Presents: Girls’ Rules, the script is flipped. Instead of the typical band of odd-coupled boys that wanted to lose their virginity to Nadia, the newest film features a core group of girl friends that want to change up their sex lives during their senior year of high school. Girls’ Rules features four main characters: Annie, the girl whose boyfriend just moved to college; Kayla, the sexually active wild child at school whose boyfriend just dumped her; Michelle, the girl who has never had a boyfriend and has an odd sexual attraction to JFK; and Stephanie, the promiscuous girl that never commits to a relationship.\n\nWanting to take control of their lives and live senior year to the max, the girls decide to explore their sexual side. Annie declares that she wants to lose her virginity to her boyfriend, while the other three decide that they want to find somebody new to be with. Just like with all coming-of-age comedies, there’s a new kid in school that everybody falls for. While all the girls (except Annie) comedically swoon for the new kid in town, Grant, they maintain a solid friendship while continuing to explore this part of their lives. Unlike the other American Pie films where women are objectified, a man is objectified in this movie. Without too many spoilers, there is a defining moment in the film where Grant makes it clear that objectification, of men or women, is wrong. This is a significant point that should be noted since it basically says that the messages of the previous films in the series are not okay, however, Girls’ Rules has a lot more to unzip than objectification.\n\nThe messages of Girls’ Rules center around notions that sex is okay and should be a part of your life. Whether sex is with someone you love, someone you barely know, or with your favorite toy, it’s okay. In this century, these messages can be empowering for women, but some parents may not think so. Moreover, the film showcases different values of sex and self-worth for each of its protagonists, but it’s much more prominent in this film than in other coming-of-age comedies. This movie is all about sex. Due to this being the first of its kind as a sex-driven story of four high school girls, this could have implications on audiences. The sexual uncertainty hypothesis describes that conflicting and inconsistent values of sex portrayed in the media leave adolescents feeling uncertain about what they should actually value in sexual relationships. Staying in the scope of the film itself, Michelle is portrayed as a self-loving masturbation advocate in the beginning of the film, but ends up transitioning to an intercourse-seeking character like the other girls. While character development is a beautiful thing in storytelling, is this character development actually harmful to viewers? Are these inconsistent values of sex going to have a negative impact on viewers of Girls’ Rules? The sexual uncertainty hypothesis could be relevant to some viewers of this movie.\n\nAlthough the intended audience for this movie isn’t easy to figure out (it’s a bit too raunchy to be considered for young adults, but there’s no nudity, which is the first for an American Pie film), the implications of this movie are still strong. On one hand, this movie does an excellent job in giving women the power to embrace a side of themselves that society usually wants to hide and shame, but on the other hand, some inconsistent portrayals could be detrimental to audiences. While I don’t think American Pie Presents: Girls’ Rules was a revolutionary step in being vocal about sexual activities, I still think it’s a good movie to watch if you want a lot of laughs and an overall good time. I would not be opposed to a sequel to see where these characters end up. College?"
