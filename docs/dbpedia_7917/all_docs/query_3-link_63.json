        "text": "EXCLUSIVE: Blue Finch Films has boarded international sales rights (excluding North America) to the Toronto Film Festival selection The End of Sex ahead of the American Film Market.\n\nStarring Emily Hampshire (Schitt’s Creek) and Jonas Chernick (Ashgrove), the film follows Emma and Josh, whose kids are away at camp. With the house empty for a week, the couple embark on a series of sexual adventures to recapture the magic of their now-too-comfortable relationship.\n\nThe film was directed by Sean Garrity who is re-teaming with his My Awkward Sexual Adventure collaborators Chernick and Hampshire.\n\nJustin Rebelo, CEO of Vortex Media, serves as producer alongside Sally Karam, and Christopher Giroux, with Jesse Ikeman and Bill Marks executive producers for Vortex Media. On behalf of Brainstorm Media, Michelle Shwarzstein and Alex Peters act as executive producers. Stars Hampshire and Chernick also executive produce.\n\n‘We’re thrilled with the reception at TIFF of The End of Sex, the film has universal appeal to anyone who’s experienced a long-term relationship,” said Rebelo. “Blue Finch was a natural fit to aid us in extending the reach of film to the rest of the world leading into AFM given our already established, successful working relationship.”\n\n“It’s great to be continuing our working relationship with Vortex on The End of Sex. This stand-out romantic comedy delivers everything one would want from the genre, seamlessly mixing laugh-out-loud humour with thoughtful performances,” commented Mike Chapman of Blue Finch Films.\n\nBlue Finch’s international slate includes the SXSW-selected Blumhouse thriller Soft & Quiet, the documentary Once Upon A Time In Uganda, and horror-comedy She Came From The Woods starring Cara Buono (Stranger Things) and William Sadler (Bill & Ted Series)."
