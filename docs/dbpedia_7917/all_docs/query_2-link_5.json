        "text": "Bruce Bisbey…please follow me at: https://dumbdogproductions.com/ https://dumbdogproductionsllc.blogspot.com or https://www.facebook.com/DumbDogProductionsLLC/ thank you.\n\nA look at the Drama Film Genre?\n\nDrama Films are serious presentations or stories with settings or life situations that portray realistic characters in conflict with either themselves, others, or forces of nature. A dramatic film shows us human beings at their best, their worst, and everything in-between. Each of the types of subject-matter themes have various kinds of dramatic plots. Dramatic films are probably the largest film genre because they include a broad spectrum of films.\n\nIn film and television, drama is a genre of narrative fiction (or semi-fiction) intended to be more serious than humorous in tone. Drama of this kind is usually qualified with additional terms that specify its particular subgenre, such as \"police crime drama\", \"political drama\", \"legal drama\", \"historical period drama\", \"domestic drama\", \"teen drama\", or \"comedy-drama\". These terms tend to indicate a particular setting or subject-matter, or else they qualify the otherwise serious tone of a drama with elements that encourage a broader range of moods.\n\nAll forms of cinema or television that involve fictional stories are forms of drama in the broader sense if their storytelling is achieved by means of actors who represent (mimesis) characters. In this broader sense, drama is a mode distinct from novels, short stories, and narrative poetry or songs. In the modern era before the birth of cinema or television, \"drama\" within theater was a type of play that was neither a comedy nor a tragedy. It is this narrower sense that the film and television industries, along with film studies, adopted. \"Radio drama\" has been used in both senses—originally transmitted in a live performance, it has also been used to describe the more high-brow and serious end of the dramatic output of radio.\n\nTypes of drama in film and television\n\nCrime drama, Police procedural, and legal drama\n\nCharacter development based on themes involving criminals, law enforcement and the legal system.\n\nHistorical drama\n\nFilms that focus on dramatic events in history.\n\nHorror drama\n\nA film that focuses on imperiled characters dealing with realistic emotional struggles, often involving dysfunctional family relations, in a horror setting. The film's horror elements often serve as a backdrop to an unraveling dramatic plot.\n\nDocudrama\n\nThe difference between a docudrama and a documentary is that in a documentary it uses real people to describe history or current events; in a docudrama it uses professionally trained actors to play the roles in the current event, that is \"dramatized\" a bit. Not to be confused with docufiction.\n\nComedy-drama\n\nA film in which there is an equal, or nearly equal, balance of humor and serious content.\n\nMelodrama\n\nA sub-type of drama films that uses plots that appeal to the heightened emotions of the audience.\n\nMelodramatic plots often deal with \"crises of human emotion, failed romance or friendship, strained familial situations, tragedy, illness, neuroses, or emotional and physical hardship\". Film critics sometimes use the term \"pejoratively to connote an unrealistic, pathos-filled, camp tale of romance or domestic situations with stereotypical characters (often including a central female character) that would directly appeal to feminine audiences\". Also called \"women's movies\", \"weepies\", tearjerkers, or \"chick flicks\". If they are targeted to a male audience, then they are called \"guy cry\" films. Often considered \"soap-opera\" drama.\n\nMilitary drama\n\nFocuses on the interpersonal and situational crises of characters in the military.\n\nRomantic drama\n\nA sub-type of dramatic film which dwells on the elements of romantic love.\n\nTeen drama\n\nFocuses on teenage characters, especially where a secondary school setting plays a role.\n\nReferences & Credits: Google, Wikipedia, Wikihow, WikiBooks, Pinterest, IMDB, Linked In, Indie Wire, Film Making Stuff, Hiive, History Channel, Film Daily, New York Film Academy, The Balance, Careers Hub, The Numbers, Film Maker, TV Guide Magazine, Blurb, Media Match, Quora, Creative Skill Set, Chron, Investopedia, Variety, No Film School, WGA, BBC, Daily Variety, The Film Agency, Best Sample Resume, How Stuff Works, Studio Binder, Career Trend, Producer's Code of Credits, Truity, Production Hub, Producers Guild of America, Film Connection, Variety, Wolf Crow, Get In Media, Production Beast, Sony Pictures, Warner Bros, UCAS, Frankenbite, Realty 101, Careers Hub, Screen Play Scripts, Elements of Cinema, Script Doctor, ASCAP, Film Independent, Any Possibility, CTLsites, NYFA, Future Learn, VOM Productions, Mad Studios, Rewire, DP School, Film Reference, DGA, IATSE, ASC, MPAA, HFPA, MPSE, CDG, AFI, Box Office Mojo, Rotten Tomatoes, Indie Film Hustle, The Numbers, Netflix, Vimeo, Instagram, Pinterest, Metacritic, Hulu, Reddit, NATO, Mental Floss, Slate, Locations Hub, Film Industry Statistics, Guinness World Records, The Audiopedia, Imagination for People,\n\nTHIS ARTICLE IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.
