        "text": "CLEVELAND, Ohio -- Mainstream audiences were thrust into unchecked hedonism and the sex trade in 1980s classic film “American Gigolo.”\n\nNow Hollywood is rebooting the Paul Schrader film, complete with plenty of Blondie tunes, including the movie soundtrack classic “Call Me.”\n\nThe eight-episode original series starts streaming Friday, Sept. 9, for Showtime subscribers before making its on-air debut at 9 p.m. Sunday on the cable network.\n\nThe drama series picks up with the titular character Julian Kaye (Jon Bernthal) after his wrongful conviction release from prison.\n\nAlso appearing on the show are Gretchen Mol (“Boardwalk Empire,” “Yellowstone,” “Perry Mason”), as well as Rosie O’Donnell, Lizzie Brocheré, Gabriel LaBelle, Leland Orser and guest star Wayne Brady.\n\nWe recently caught up with Mol to discuss the original film, roller skating to Blondie’s iconic “Call Me” and working with Bernthal.\n\nHello, Gretchen, congrats on the new series. What’s your history with the original 1980 film?\n\nI had seen it. I worked with Paul Schrader on a film [”Forever Mine”] he directed and wrote. When “American Gigolo” came out, I was young at the time to see it so it was bizarre to me. I didn’t quite understand what I was seeing, but now in the modern-day reimagining of it, I thought it was interesting to remove it from that time period and place it in this contemporary world where technology has changed everything. Even from the character of Julian Kaye who goes to prison. So the flashbacks are set in 2006 and just how much the world changes between that time and the present.\n\nThe original film naturally includes Blondie’s “Call Me.” Were you a fan?\n\nI was a huge fan of that song, Debbie Harry and her whole style. That was like a roller rink song for me. It was so much fun and so cool. I’m so glad we got to use that song. Its sort of disco-y era of music makes me think of Studio 54. Just this era where people were sexually liberated before AIDS. This kind of sexual freedom and sexiness. That’s what it conjures for me. Also, each episode is titled a different Blondie song, so there’s definitely homage paid.\n\nWhat stands out when thinking about the original film is its style and fashion sense. Does that continue in the new “American Gigolo?”\n\nI remember the stylization of Richard Gere and Lauren Hutton’s wardrobe. Everybody knew the sort of iconic thing about the film was the fashion and the style of it. You couldn’t do this material without the sort of neon lights, glossiness and pop style but what’s interesting was pulling it apart and exploring how does someone become Julian Kaye, this gigolo. You can’t really gloss over what that is. That makes the show not deeper than the film, but you’re going into the subject matter in a way that brings interest, intrigue and makes the stakes even higher. It’s also what makes you want to keep coming back for more.\n\nNaturally, the film takes a hard look at the sex trade, which some 40 years later is viewed and discussed differently.\n\nYou can’t just come into this in a glib way. From “Pretty Woman,” we’ve come to a place now where we want to understand and explore things. I don’t think you can just tap into this genre without understanding this sort of trauma element of it, too. In the show, you do explore Julian’s upbringing, his life, his sort of own sexual abuse and how he has kind of in some way taken ownership of it by becoming a gigolo.\n\nRegarding your co-star Jon Bernthal, you both come from a theater background. Did having that shared experience help your performances in “American Gigolo?”\n\nBefore even starting to shoot, there were a lot of conversations about obviously the story depends on this sort of purity of this love. It’s not a job. She meets him as the man that he is. She doesn’t pay for it. So it was really interesting to me to explore and try to understand what the attraction is based on above and beyond just being a kind of physical, chemical reaction to one another. What is the thing that they feel for each other? I had to come at it and understand at least why she could fall in love with this man and then still find herself in a sort of transactional relationship that is its own prison of her making. There has to be something similar in her history that sort of compels her to Julian.\n\nRegarding “Perry Mason,” you appeared in the first season of the HBO series. Are you in the second season, which is set to return next year?\n\nThe good news is I get to be back on the show but it’s just a glimpse. It was interesting, they were shooting “Perry Mason” in L.A. at the same time I was shooting “American Gigolo,” so I had the opportunity to kind of go over to shoot a little bit but I couldn’t do as much as I’d like to.\n\nWe’re assuming you weren’t humming “Call Me” on the “Perry Mason” set?\n\nNo, it’s such a different world."
