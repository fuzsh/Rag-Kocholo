        "text": "Director Craig Boreham’s sophomore feature Lonesome is a movie about sex. The film centers around Casey (Josh Lavery), a cowboy who emerges out of the vastness of Australia’s countryside to seek refuge amidst the city lights of Sydney. “Didn’t take long for you to get your Big Smoke slut on,” teases Tib (Daniel Gabriel) on Casey’s first night in town… the first night they sleep together. Both boys are guarded, wounded, and primarily able to communicate with their bodies rather than their words.\n\nAs they get to know one another physically, they open up emotionally as well, learning how to be honest with themselves and each other about just how deep their pain goes… and just how much they enjoy one another’s company. In Lonesome, sex is a form of communication, at once a tool for self-discovery and a way to find desperately-needed connection."
