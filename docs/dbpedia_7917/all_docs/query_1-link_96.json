        "text": "The curious case of So This Is Africa (Columbia, 1933) shows that both Hollywood's in-house censors and state and local censors took seriously cinematic violations of racial and sexual norms. This spoof of “jungle” films exploited audience interest in a cycle of fictional and nonfictional depictions of “primitive” life. These films claimed partial exemption from taboos against sexual and racial boundary-crossing, and usually showed unclothed “native” women. But So This Is Africa went further. However farcical, its suggestions of adultery, interracial sex, homosexuality, and even bestiality raised an unusually large storm among the censors. Cut by one-third, the film still outraged many and helped precipitate the industry's creation of the Production Code Administration, designed to police the screen more tightly.\n\n2 David Nasaw, Going Out: The Rise and Fall of Public Amusements (New York: Basic Books, 1993); Daniel Czitrom, “The Politics of Performance: Theater Licensing and the Origins of Movie Censorship in New York,” in Francis G.

The Library of Congress holds a heavily censored print of the film.\n\n8 The script is in the So This Is Africa file, Records of the New York State Motion Picture Commission (after 1927 the Education Department, Motion Picture Division), New York State Archives, Albany, NY (hereafter NYSMPC). All subsequent quotes from script are from this file.\n\n12 Review of Congorilla, New York Times, 22 July 1932. On impositions of narrative form on South Sea documentaries see reviews of Mawas, Variety, 4 June 1930, and of Isle of Paradise, ibid., 26 July 1932; on ones centered on the western hemisphere see reviews of Voodoo, New York Times, 27 March 1933, and of Savage Gold, ibid., 25 July 1933.\n\n14 Review of Congorilla, Variety, 26 July 1932. Criticism of inferior documentaries appears in reviews of Up the Congo, Variety, 22 Jan. 1930; Ingagi, ibid., 16 April 1930; Africa Speaks, ibid., 24 Sept. 1930; Wild Men of Kalihari, ibid., 26 Nov. 1930; Ubangi, ibid., 2 June 1931; The Truth about Africa, ibid., 18 April 1933, and New York Times, 17 April 1933. The Imperatos (Congorilla, 167–68) say the Johnsons used staged footage shot at his African compound.\n\n19 In the case of Ingagi, the trump did not always work; Chicago's censors passed it, but Little Rock's banned it as “lewd, lascivious and indecent,” and the Dallas City Council was moved by it to “consider the need [for a] censor”; on the other hand, a New Orleans newspaper opined that while Little Rock “was violated in all its finer sensibilities … New Orleans was merely bored.” Quoted in Daily Reports, 5 April, 26 April, and 15 May 1933, Will Hays Papers (Microfilm Edition, University Publications of America).\n\n31 In Daughter of the Congo, the African American filmmaker Oscar Micheaux followed the same racial code, distinguishing between dark-skinned “savages of the jungle” and the “beautiful mulatto girl” who falls into their clutches: Gary Null, Black Hollywood: The Negro in Motion Pictures (Secaucus, NJ: Citadel Press, 1975), 44–45. New York's leading African American newspaper, the Amsterdam News, condemned Micheaux's “intraracial color fetishism … All the noble characters are high yellows; all the ignoble ones are black.” Quoted in Henry Sampson, T., Blacks in Black and White: A Source Book on Black Films (Metuchen, NJ: Scarecrow Press, 1977), 51. In “Micheaux: Celebrating Blackness,” Black American Literature Forum, 25 (Summer 1991), 351–60Google Scholar, bell hooks claims that beneath this apparent fetishism was a subtextual strategy affirming “an unbroken diasporic bond with Africa.” See also Thomas Cripps, “‘Race Movies’ as Voices of the Black Bourgeoisie: The Scar of Shame,” in John E. O'Connor and Martin A. Jackson, eds., American History/American Film: Interpreting the Hollywood Image (New York: Ungar, 1979), 39–56.\n\n35 “Woody” Van Dyke, after directing several Tim McCoy silent westerns, was picked by MGM's David O. Selznick to take over a stalled documentary about the South Seas being made by Robert Flaherty. Van Dyke used Flaherty's footage “to provide a sense of atmosphere” for a movie that became “the story of a down-and-out American whose latent idealism is brought out by the love of an unspoiled native girl”; Van Dyke's success in this assignment led to Trader Horn and Tarzan the Ape Man, and, in 1934, his finest year, to The Thin Man and Naughty Marietta.
