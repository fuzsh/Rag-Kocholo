The album is set to be released on October 16, 2020 by independent record label Hot Eye Records. The visual film will feature all 25 songs from the album which will stream exclusively on Netflix on October 16, 2020 to coincide with the album's release. The visual concept of the album is heavily inspired by fairytale and greek mythology themes. The album follows the same undertones of \"The Past, The Present and the Future of Pop\", \"Diary of a Pop Sinner\", \"Stephanie Fierce\", \"Newborn\", \"Free\", \"Life's Good\", \"Love is Lust\", \"Amplified\", and \"Lost in Electronica\" and makes subtle references socnially to signature sounds and themes of those albums.\n\nIn terms of storytelling; the album plays as a soundtrack to the music film of the same name but does not include any narrative parts from the film but only the musical score. The film/album will consists of three acts that separate the album into each respective aesthetic personas and sounds. While the album is not limited to a particular genre; the album is promoted and identified as a pop album. The album will only be available for purchase through physical CD and digital download through stephaniefierce.com and hoteyerecords.com starting on October 16, 2020 but will not be counted for charting on commercial charts. The album will be made available for pre-order on September 18, 2020 on those respective websites.\n\n\"Lost in Electronica was a stepping stone for me. After being gone for so long I had really forgotten to do so many things that I felt almost in a sense like a brand new artist. But just like you never forget to ride a bike, I quickly was able to get a grasp on how this music things works and with this album I came in with a more clear head. I really sat down withmyself and just took the time to iron out everything with a clear head and no pressure of making a comeback. The bar is always set up high with me as an artist. That can definitetly mess with your creative space because you start doing things just to please people. So I just had to kind of removed myself from the popular crowd and put myself in a world where I knew no one and just create with my heart. I wanted to make an album that was in a way like an extension to what Lost in Electronica was and almost like a sequel to Diary of a Pop Sinner which was almost like a fairytale in a sense. The more songs I recorded the more I realized that this was an album of its own. I had to really put myself in a creative space where I could create something that not only was cohesive but didn't shy away from the sound I was going for which turned out to be almost like a collection of all of my albums into one. The most important thing about this album is the story being told. My journey as an artist has never been a traditional one but with this album it puts all of the pieces of the puzzle together.\"\n\n[Message from; Stephanie Fierce]\n\nMore information on ROYAL SEX STORIES will become available in the coming weeks.\n\nCOMING SOON.\n\nPlease do not reply to this thread until all content is posted :)\n\nEdited by user 23 September 2020 08:56:49(UTC) | Reason: Not specified\n\nRank: Advanced Member\n\nGroups: Registered\n\nJoined: 21/02/2009(UTC)\n\nPosts: 18,252\n\nThanks: 6248 times\n\nWas thanked: 7557 time(s) in 3439 post(s)\n\nArtist: Stephanie Fierce\n\nTitle: A Pop Sinner's Prayer\n\nGenre(s): Soul, Pop-Rock\n\nLength: 5:31\n\nWriters: Stephanie Fierce\n\nProducer: Stephanie Fierce, Patrick Leonard, Stephen Bray\n\nLabel: Hot Eye Records\n\nFrom The Album: Royal Sex Stories\n\nA Pop Sinner's Prayer is a song recorded by American artist Stephanie Fierce for her tenth studio album, Royal Sex Stories. Serving as the first and opening track on the album, 'A Pop Sinner's Prayer' was writtern by Stephanie Fierce in efforts to tie in with the theme of the visual album. The song was also written in tribute to a fictional theme Fierce came up with for her second studio album \"Diary of a Pop Sinner\". Fierce was joined by producers Patrick Ray Leonard and Stephen Bray to help compose the track with an orchestra and live band. The song also features the choir group 'The Black Doves'; who previously worked with Fierce on her fourth and fifth studio album \"Newborn\" and \"Free\". Throughout the song prior to the bridge they serve as back up vocalist; post-bridge they serve a main vocalists with Stephanie Fierce as they switch off singing high notes. A guitar riff and 80's inspired drums are heard throughout the song contributing to it's rock sound. The song is a depiction of Fierce as a young teenager praying to become a famous pop star.\n\n\"This song was written with the short film in mind because it's the premise of the story I'm telling. Because this is a visual album after all I did want the music to match the storytelling in the film. You have a young woman who's only wish is to become a superstar; so in her prayers at night she just prays that it will happen to her. It's kind of taking it back to those innocent youthful years when I had a desire to be famous. I wanted to start there because we all kind of forget from time to time that one point in our lives we all wanted this and I think it's really important to look back and showcase that side of me.\n\nAs far as the sound I really wanted something that not only sounded heavenly but still had some rock-edge to it. It gives you an late 80's pop-rock vibe and kind of reminds me of the approach I took when I made \"Pop Sinner\" in Diary of a Pop Sinner but it's a bit more evolved in the essence of how I sing and also this song contains elements from \"The Black Doves\" a choir group who sang on my fourth and fifth studio albums. On this song they embody and represent the angels in the imaginary heaven Stephanie Rios created when she was young.\" - [Message from; Stephanie Fierce]\n\nA Pop Sinner's Prayer (Official Lyrics)\n\nWith a performance from The Black Doves\n\n[With The Black Doves as back up vocalists]\n\n\"Living life in misery everyone fighting for a throne\n\nfighting for a chance in fame but then you feel all alone...\n\nIn it for the fame, she does her little prayer\n\nshe begs and pleads she's close she swears\n\nlike a lotus flower I will build my power\n\nIt's just a pop sinner's prayer\n\ntime to rejoice, so no more crying\n\nremain poised through the noise\n\nI know you're trying\n\nan angel in disguise,\n\ncomes down at night\n\nfeel like sobbing\n\nmidnight sky, now I rise\n\nnow I fly free\n\nIn it for the fame, she does her little prayer\n\nshe begs and pleads she's close she swears\n\nlike a lotus flower I will build my power\n\nIt's just a pop sinner's prayer\n\nLost in the clouds; with an endless journey\n\nangels watch over you now no need to worry\n\nIn the new york lights, or the LA concrete stars\n\nI know I'll make it, and I'm going far\n\nnow watch me rejoice,\n\nLike a choir,\n\nhear me sing\n\nIn it for the fame, she does her little prayer\n\nshe begs and pleads she's close she swears\n\nlike a lotus flower I will build my power\n\nIt's just a pop sinner's prayer\n\nIn it for the fame, she does her little prayer\n\nshe begs and pleads she's close she swears\n\nlike a lotus flower I will build my power\n\nIt's just a pop sinner's prayer\n\nOh, oh, oh,\n\nLiving life in misery everyone fighting for a throne\n\nfighting for a chance in fame but then you feel all alone...\n\n[With The Black Doves as main vocalists]\n\nIn it for the fame, she does her little prayer\n\nshe begs and pleads she's close she swears\n\nlike a lotus flower, I will build my power\n\nIt's just a pop sinner's prayer\n\nJust like a prayer, I'll take you there\n\nIt's like a dream to me.

Serving as the second track on the album, 'Superstar (1999)' was writtern by Stephanie Fierce solely. The song transitions into the genres of a primarily \"soul and funk\" sound and features a more grownup approach with the sound. Fierce was joined by producers Patrick Leonard (who also worked on the prior track) and Fernando Garibay who added the Jazzy elements to the production of the song. The song begins with a jazzy sound that is joined by funky guitar and adult contemporary R&B sound. Fierce is heard singing in a sultry but soft manner. The jazzy instruments also tend to match the tone in which she's singing throughout. The second to last features a clashing verse where Stephanie Fierce and background singer sing over each other to add a climatic effect. The last verse is sung more rapidly as it fades out.\n\nThe song also features very subtle but distintive background vocals from The Chickmunk Girls and lyrically the song talks about the ambition of a superstar in the making. Fierce makes slight references to her younger self with her lyrics \"cause these girls spent too much time putting their make up on while you played with barbies I played with guitars and microphones\" in light of the fact that all Fierce did growing up as child was rehearse and sing while normal kids just played. While the song talks about Fierce's perfectionist flaw it also describes the passion she has which also translates to her sexual desires.\n\n\"This song is a representation of everything I listened to in 1999 because of my dad. So in a sense I'm kind of paying homage to that time in my life and also to my father because this is the type of music he would listen to that was released in the late 80's when I was in my toddler/young child years. Of course there's a contemporary apprach to it and for me that was probably the most exciting element is to bring a sound that was kind of left in the late 80's and bring it back with a modern spin with all of the wonderful technology we have today. I didn't want the song to sound like another artist, I definietly wanted it to sound like me so I brought my vocal styling but also explored the idea of singing more sultry and soft which is something I don't often do.\n\nThis song also picks up where the last left off in turns of the message. I'm really kind of describing the passion and determination I had before I became famous and I kind of want to inspire others to keep working towards whatever the live. Give them a song that they can resignate with in that sense because there are people out there that of course will doubt you but you have to keep pushing. However, it's not all a serious message there's a spin to the song when the lyrics take a turn and describe a topic that relates to love vs what the original meaning of the song was.\". - [Message from; Stephanie Fierce]\n\nSuperstar (1999) (Official Lyrics)\n\nFeatures background vocals from The Chickmunk Girls\n\n\"[Lyrics include background singers]\n\nSuperstar since 1999\n\nBoy I got a passion, please excuse my fashion\n\nin which I present it\n\nIt brings a fire to me and boy I can't control it\n\nI can't hold it, posses me in ways\n\nboy I can't afford it\n\nSuperstar [yeah]\n\nA bib on her shirt, a microphone in her hand\n\nShe don't know she was born for this\n\nshe don't know if she's ready for this\n\nbut she knows she's earned it\n\nshe earned it [yeah]\n\nShe dances with the lights\n\nalmost like she's fighting a crime\n\nshe puts all into her bite\n\nwhatever she wants she gets\n\nSuperstat (yeah)\n\n[Vocals become stronger, more attitude and pick up the pace]\n\ncause these girls spent too much time putting their make up on\n\nwhile you played with barbies I played with guitars and microphones\n\nSuperstar is what I was meant to be\n\nSince 1999 All I did was sing\n\nSorry mom for breaking your dreams [going to college]\n\nLittle did you know your girl was already filled with knowledge\n\nshe needs\n\ncause\n\nI'm bleeding my heart out for you baby\n\ncan't you see how hard I want this\n\n(Since 1999)\n\nI'm singing my heart out for you bay\n\ncan't you see that I want this\n\n(since 1999)\n\nBoy I got a passion, please excuse my fashion\n\nin which I present it\n\nIt brings a fire to me and boy I can't control it\n\nI can't hold it, posses me in ways\n\nboy I can't afford it\n\nSuperstar [yeah]\n\nA bib on her shirt, a microphone in her hand\n\nShe don't know she was born for this\n\nshe don't know if she's ready for this\n\nbut she knows she's earned it\n\nshe earned it [yeah]\n\nShe dances with the lights\n\nalmost like she's fighting a crime\n\nshe puts all into her bite\n\nwhatever she wants she gets\n\nSuperstat (yeah)\n\nshe's not your typical, she works miracles\n\nshe's invincible, a star and its biblical\n\nsuperstar since 1999\n\nshe's not your typical, she works miracles\n\nshe's invincible, a star and its biblical\n\nsuperstar since 1999\n\nshe's not your typical, she works miracles\n\nshe's invincible, a star and its biblical\n\nsuperstar since 1999\n\nshe's not your typical, she works miracles\n\nshe's invincible, a star and its biblical\n\nsuperstar since 1999\n\nA superstar, a superstar, a superstar\n\nsince 1999, 1999, 1999\"\n\nEdited by user 24 September 2020 10:47:26(UTC) | Reason: Not specified\n\nRank: Advanced Member\n\nGroups: Registered\n\nJoined: 21/02/2009(UTC)\n\nPosts: 18,252\n\nThanks: 6248 times\n\nWas thanked: 7557 time(s) in 3439 post(s)\n\nArtist: Stephanie Fierce\n\nTitle: Roots\n\nGenre(s): R&B/Soul\n\nLength: 4:00\n\nWriters: Stephanie Fierce\n\nProducer: Stephanie Fierce\n\nLabel: Hot Eye Records\n\nFrom The Album: Royal Sex Stories\n\nRoots is a song recorded by American artist Stephanie Fierce for her tenth studio album, Royal Sex Stories. Serving as the third track on the album, 'Roots; was written and produced by Stephanie Fierce solely. While the song was produced solely, Fierce was joined by her all female band to provide instrumentation for the track, mainly consisting of a very present bass guitar, horns and other instruments and softwares used in classic R&B records. While the instruments are a focus point on the track, Fierce's vocals also dominate the record with many belting moments and strong vocal transitions; primarily in the bridge when Fierce is heard at her highest range. After birthing Helle; Fierce's vocals begun to mature in a way that it sounded more aged and mature so in contrast to some of Fierce's earlier R&B records this song takes it up a notch when it comes to being a vocalist on this track.\n\nThe song's lyrics adresses Fierce's encounter and critism with the music industry at one of the highest points of her career but also makes references to her divorce with Johnny Johnson. The song serves as a female empowerment track. Despite the lyrics not being specific on who Fierce is talking about many listerners familiar with the singer's historical background will be familiar with whom Fierce is referencing without having to list any names. The roots symbolize Fierce's strenght as a person and as an artist standing tall today despite all the setbacks and tribulations she's been through in her journey.\n\n\"When I hear back on my first album there are many vocal moments I wish I could change. Primarily I think of the song \"Where I Belong\" because that song's vocal style is somewhat similar to the one on this song. Before attempting to record \"Roots\" I played \"Where I Belong\" to kind of show myself my growth as both a vocalist and a songwriter. I wanted this song to be a representation of me today as a vocalist. Not to completely just shit on my first album but at that point I was just starting out but in a way this song pays homage to that sound I was going for and I think It's kind of like a full circle moment happening in a sense.\n\nI didn't want this song to just thrive off nostalgia factor I really wanted it to also stand on its own two legs. With that being said. I don't think I've released a song in a while where I'm actually sangang if you know what I mean. With this song I was really focused on the soul of the voice and I didn't really hold myself back in terms of how loud or how strong I was hitting certain songs which I often do because in my first album I was known to doing that on certain records and it can come across as I bit intimadating. After all this song is a female empowerment song. With this song it's all about reminding yourself how powerful you are. Going through a divorce isn't an easy thing. With this song I obviously was adressing certain things about my divorce from the Stephanie Fierce artist stand point. It's every aggressive and unapologetic and every woman deserves to feel that and have that moment of rage just like the men do with their little rock songs. \". - [Message from; Stephanie Fierce]\n\nRoots (Official Lyrics)\n\nFeatures The Stephanie Fierce Live Band\n\n\"HORNS!\n\nLately I've been reminising of what I've been through\n\nIt's evident that I'm still standing and that upsets you\n\nand I know like a diss, I dismiss and I repent you\n\nwill never make the same mistake that is you\n\nboy you tried to rip me out my roots and of my soul\n\nbut all you did was dig yourself into a deeper hole\n\nBaby I hope you enjoyed the view\n\nbut next time you see me I'll be brand new\n\nand you'll never find a substitute\n\nI'm strong cause baby it's in my roots\n\nso babe I hoped you enjoyed the view\n\nbut next time you see me I'll be brand new\n\nand you'll never find a substitute\n\nI'm strong and I survived cause baby it's in my roots\n\nPeeling, all the bad energy you gave me\n\nall the things you did to tarnish my name\n\ndo you think this is a game\n\nBoy I'm not playing\n\nI'm slaying\n\nso you better move out of my way\n\nboy you tried to rip me out my roots and of my soul\n\nbut all you did was dig yourself into a deeper hole\n\nso\n\nBaby I hope you enjoyed the view\n\nbut next time you see me I'll be brand new\n\nand you'll never find a substitute\n\nI'm strong cause baby it's in my roots\n\nso babe I hoped you enjoyed the view\n\nbut next time you see me I'll be brand new\n\nand you'll never find a substitute\n\nI'm strong and I survived cause baby it's in my roots\n\n[Bridge]\n\ncause you're goin to see me everywhere\n\ncause baby I'm not going anywhere\n\nyou can try and bend the truth\n\nyou can try and pull me off my roots\n\ncause I will be the one that you would fear\n\ncause no other woman will even compare\n\nDoesn't it suck to see you lose\n\nas you tried to pull me off my roots\n\nBoy you tried to break me\n\nand drain me of my soul\n\nI'll never quit resisting\n\ngot my roots planted in this soil\n\ncan't rip me out my roots\n\nLADIES SING WITH IT WITH ME NOW\n\nBaby I hope you enjoyed the view\n\nbut next time you see me I'll be brand new\n\nand you'll never find a substitute\n\nI'm strong cause baby it's in my roots\n\nso babe I hoped you enjoyed the view\n\nbut next time you see me I'll be brand new\n\nand you'll never find a substitute\n\nI'm strong and I survived cause baby it's in my roots\n\nI hope you enjoyed the view\n\nbut next time you see me I'll be brand new\n\nand you'll never find a substitute\n\nI'm strong cause baby it's in my roots\n\nso babe I hoped you enjoyed the view\n\nbut next time you see me I'll be brand new\n\nand you'll never find a substitute\n\nI'm strong and I survived cause baby it's in my roots\n\nIN MY ROOTS\n\n[Spoken]\n\nBoy you tried it\n\nnow watch me \"\n\nEdited by user 24 September 2020 10:45:03(UTC) | Reason: Not specified"
