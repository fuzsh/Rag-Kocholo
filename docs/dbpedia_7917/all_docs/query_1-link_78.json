        "text": "Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein has been found guilty of rape and sexual assault by courts in New York and Los Angeles.\n\nHere is a summary of the key events that led him to court:\n\n5 October 2017\n\nThe New York Times publishes a story detailing decades of allegations of sexual harassment against Harvey Weinstein. Actresses Rose McGowan and Ashley Judd are among the women who come forward.\n\nAmong the accusations are that he forced women to massage him and watch him naked. He also promised to help advance their careers in return for sexual favours.\n\nWeinstein issues an apology acknowledging he \"has caused a lot of pain\" - but disputes allegations he harassed female employees over nearly three decades.\n\nWeinstein says he is taking a \"leave of absence\" from The Weinstein Company and is working with a therapist.\n\n8 October 2017\n\nIt is announced that Harvey Weinstein has been sacked by the board of his company, with immediate effect. They say the decision was made \"in light of new information about misconduct\".\n\n9 October 2017\n\nBritish actress Romola Garai tells the Guardian that she felt \"violated\" when Weinstein auditioned her as an 18-year-old, saying that he had answered the door to his hotel room in a bathrobe.\n\n10 October 2017\n\nAllegations from 13 more women are published in the New Yorker magazine, including three accusations of rape, which Weinstein strongly denies.\n\nActress Asia Argento and a former aspiring actress named Lucia Stoller say Weinstein forced himself on them sexually. A third woman withholds her name from the article, the result of a 10-month investigation by the magazine. Argento says the incident happened in 1997 in the south of France while Stoller, who now goes under the name Evans, says she was forced into a sexual act by the producer after going for a casting meeting in 2004.\n\nMira Sorvino, who starred in several of Weinstein's films, told the New Yorker that Weinstein sexually harassed her and tried to pressure her into a physical relationship.\n\nWeinstein's spokeswoman Sallie Hofmeister tells the publication: \"Any allegations of non-consensual sex are unequivocally denied by Mr Weinstein.\"\n\nHollywood A-listers Gwyneth Paltrow and Angelina Jolie say they were harassed by Weinstein. Paltrow says she was propositioned as a 22-year-old, while Jolie refers to a \"bad experience\" in her youth.\n\nWeinstein's wife Georgina Chapman announces she is leaving him and that her priority is her young children.\n\n11 October 2017\n\n12 October 2017\n\nPolice are called following a \"family dispute\" at the home of Weinstein's daughter. The Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) confirm they were called to reports of a \"disturbance\" at the house but say no crime was committed. Weinstein was not there when officers arrived.\n\nFamily Guy creator Seth MacFarlane addresses a joke he made about Weinstein's sexual conduct at the 2013 Oscar nominations, saying he decided to speak out after a co-star had been harassed by the producer.\n\nPolice in the US and UK say they are investigating specific allegations from 2004 and the 1980s. No charges are yet brought.\n\nRose McGowan says on Twitter that Weinstein raped her. Weinstein has \"unequivocally denied\" any allegations of non-consensual sex in a statement released through his publicist.\n\n13 October 2017\n\nWeinstein's former office assistant Lisa Rose says the film mogul tried to invite her to another room, mentioning a massage.\n\nThe Late, Late Show presenter James Corden makes jokes about Weinstein's alleged sexual assaults at a charity gala in Los Angeles. He later apologises on Twitter, saying he \"was not trying to make light of Harvey's inexcusable behaviour, but to shame him, the abuser, not his victims\".\n\n14 October 2017\n\nThe organisation behind the Oscars votes to expel Weinstein. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences says: \"What's at issue here is a deeply troubling problem that has no place in our society.\"\n\nActress Alice Evans tells BBC Radio 5 Live that Weinstein made lewd comments towards her.\n\nKate Winslet reveals she deliberately did not thank Weinstein when she won her Oscar for The Reader in 2009. \"I remember being told, 'Make sure you thank Harvey if you win',\" the actress tells the Los Angeles Times. \"And I remember turning around and saying, 'No I won't'.\"\n\n15 October 2017\n\nBritish actress Lysette Anthony says Weinstein raped her at her London home in the late 1980s while another, unidentified woman says she was raped in 1992.\n\nWoody Allen says he is \"sad\" for Harvey Weinstein. He later clarifies his comments in a statement: \"When I said I felt sad for Harvey Weinstein I thought it was clear the meaning was because he is a sad, sick man.\"\n\nUK police investigate a number of sexual assault allegations involving Weinstein. The Metropolitan Police say he is accused of assaulting three women in separate incidents in London in the late 1980s, 1992, 2010, 2011 and 2015.
