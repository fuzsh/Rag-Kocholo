Their relationship isn't easy, as she's already promised to a Duke.\n\nChicago Tribune's Michael Wilmington called \"Moulin Rouge!\" a \"landmark musical movie — controversial, mercurial, even cheeky. It's the kind of film that wildly divides audiences and critics — people tend to either love or hate it. I loved it.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n59. \"Braveheart\" is a three-hour film filled with war, gore, and expert storytelling.\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 76%\n\nA Scottish patriot William Wallace (Mel Gibson) seeks revenge after his bride is murdered, sparking a battle — and eventual war — against King Edward I of England in the 13th century.\n\nThe Washington Post's Hal Hinson called the film \"a completely adequate modern facsimile of the classic romantic epic.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n58. \"Mansfield Park\" follows a man and woman as their relationship evolves from childhood best friends to romantic partners.\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 77%\n\nFanny Price (Frances O'Connor), a young girl born into a poor family in the early 1800s, moves to live with her aunt at an estate called Mansfield Park.\n\nAs she grows up, she becomes very close with Edmund Bertram (Jonny Lee Miller), the son of her aunt's husband, and eventually, they both must confront their feelings for each other. The film is adapted from Jane Austen's 1814 novel.\n\n\"Intelligence and beauty — and teasting romance — shape 'Mansfield Park' into a gorgeous, enchanting experience,\" Peter Stack wrote for the San Francisco Chronicle.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n57. \"Dreamgirls\" chronicles The Dreamettes' quest for fame in the 1960s.\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 79%\n\nAdapted from the 1981 Broadway musical and set in 1960s Detroit, \"Dreamgirls\" follows the female singing group \"The Dreamettes.\" The trio sets out on a journey to become stars but must overcome obstacles along the way.\n\n\"Fit with pitch-perfect costumes and sets and a sufficient sense of scope and grandiosity, 'Dreamgirls' is an enjoyable musical, even if it has to rely on the voices of its actors to carry certain scenes,\" Cameron Johnson wrote for The Spread.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n56. \"A Very Long Engagement\" follows one woman's journey to learn the truth about her fiancé's death during World War I.\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 79%\n\nMathilde (Audrey Tautou) refuses to believe reports that her fiancé (Gaspard Ulliel) was killed in World War I and begins to investigate his disappearance. As she searches for answers about what happened to him, she uncovers a chilling secret.\n\n\"'A Very Long Engagement' is all that its title promises. At two and a quarter hours, it is the longest film yet by French director Jean-Pierre Jeunet; happily, it is also the most engaging, a stylish and satisfying epic of love and war, hope and memory,\" Christopher Orr wrote for The Atlantic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n55. \"The Theory of Everything\" delves into physicist Stephen Hawking's life, including his relationship with Jane Wilde.\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 80%\n\nA look at how one man's diagnosis with ALS altered the course of his life, \"The Theory of Everything\" chronicles famed physicist Stephen Hawking's (Eddie Redmayne) career and romance with wife Jane Wilde (Felicity Jones).

As she begins to learn more about the group and its members, Ashton finds it impossible to return to her normal life.\n\n\"'The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society' is an old-school, old-fashioned entertainment, a romantic drama bursting with scenic vistas and earnest charm that contains just enough mystery to keep us involved,\" Kenneth Turan wrote for the Los Angeles Times.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n50. \"Atonement\" examines the consequences one decision can have on people's lives.\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 83%\n\nWhen Briony Tallis (Saoirse Ronan) wrongly accuses her older sister Cecilia's (Keira Knightley) lover (James McAvoy) of a crime in the early 20th century, she changes the directions of the couple's lives.\n\n\"This screen version, directed by Joe Wright and adapted by Christopher Hampton from Ian McEwan's novel of the same name, stands on its own as a singular achievement — romantic, sensuous, intelligent and finally shattering in its sweep and thematic complexity,\" Joe Morgenstern wrote for The Wall Street Journal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n49. \"Darkest Hour\" is a biopic about Winston Churchill's early days as prime minister.\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 84%\n\nGary Oldman plays Winston Churchill in his early days as the prime minister of the United Kingdom in \"Darkest Hour.\" The film, which was directed by Joe Wright, takes a concentrated deep dive into Churchill's term from appointment to the Battle of Dunkirk.\n\n\"Wright has found an ideal collaborator in Oldman, an actor who knows how to embrace his most dramatic side but who still excels in his quieter moments,\" David Sims wrote in The Atlantic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n48.\"The Ten Commandments\" brings Moses' story to the screen.\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 84%\n\n\"The Ten Commandments\" tells the biblical story of Moses (Charlton Heston), an Egyptian prince who finds out his true heritage — altering the course of his life.\n\n\"'The Ten Commandments' takes all the great technical advances, VistaVision, Technicolor, high fidelity recording, etc., and without allowing these physical elements to dominate, tells one of the greatest stories of all time,\" The Hollywood Reporter staff wrote.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n47. \"Jane Eyre\" brought Charlotte Bronte's novel to life.\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 85%\n\nAn orphaned girl named Jane Eyre (Mia Wasikowska) finds stability as a governess at Edward Rochester's (Michael Fassbender) estate in this adaptation of Charlotte Bronte's 1847 novel. As she begins to form a relationship with the head of the estate, she learns a troubling truth about him.\n\n\"This 'Jane Eyre,' energetically directed by Cary Joji Fukunaga ('Sin Nombre') from a smart, trim script by Moira Buffini ('Tamara Drewe'), is a splendid example of how to tackle the daunting duty of turning a beloved work of classic literature into a movie,\" A.O. Scott wrote for The New York Times.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n46. \"Far From the Madding Crowd\" is the fourth film adaptation of Thomas Hardy's 1847 novel.\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 85%\n\nSet in a rural English farming community in the 19th century, \"Far From the Madding Crowd\" follows Bathsheba Everdene (Carey Mulligan) as she manages a farm she inherited from her uncle.\n\nPlaying on themes like love, passion, betrayal, and family, the 2015 film is centered around a vibrant, independent protagonist that must navigate a variety of marriage offerings and relationships.\n\n\"Cheers to Danish director Thomas Vinterberg for blowing the antiquated dust off Thomas Hardy's 1874 novel about a willful heroine who'd rather muck about in sheep dip on a farm she inherited than marry guys who treat her like property,\" Peter Travers wrote in Rolling Stone.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n45. Based on a true story, Ridley Scott's \"The Last Duel\" is a powerful film about silencing women.\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 85%\n\nBen Affleck and Matt Damon's first movie in years bears a timely feminist message that speaks to the arrogance and seemingly limitless power of men.\n\nTold from three points of view during the 14th century, the film is based on a true story of betrayal between former friends Jean Carrouges (Damon) and Jacques Le Gris (Adam Driver) as the latter is accused of raping Carrouges' wife, Marguerite (Jodie Comer).\n\nMarguerite speaks up about her assault when it's dangerous for a woman to be anything but silent and subservient to her male guardian out of fear of being ostracized by her community.

Once he is set free, he seeks vengeance against those who have wronged him and his family.\n\n\"The big difference between 'Ben-Hur' and other spectacles, biblical or otherwise, is its sincere concern for human beings. They're not just pawns reciting flowery dialog to fill gaps between the action and spectacle scenes. They arouse genuine emotional feeling in the audience,\" Variety's Ronald Holloway said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n42. \"The English Patient\" tells a love story set in World War II.\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 86%\n\nAs a nurse (Juliette Binoche) works to heal an injured man (Ralph Fiennes) in Italy during World War II, he remembers his life.

Smart, fierce, and independent, she decides to fight for ownership over her work.\n\n\"As merely a biopic of her life, British director Wash Westmoreland's 'Colette,' with Keira Knightley in the title role, is the best and most lavishly appointed, gorgeously photographed period movie in years,\" Observer's Rex Reed wrote.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n37. \"The Longest Day\" attempts to capture D-Day from both the German and Allied armies' perspectives.\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 87%\n\nIn one of the most influential battles of World War II, the Allied forces stormed the beaches of Normandy on June 6, 1944. \"The Longest Day\" examines the fateful day from both the German and Allied sides, channeling both leaders and soldiers' experiences (using a star-studded, massive cast) into the narrative.\n\n\"It emerges as a sort of grand scale semi-fictionalized documentary concerning the overall logistics needed for this incredible invasion. It carries its three hour length by the sheer tingle of the masses of manpower in action, peppered with little ironic, sad, silly actions that all add up to war,\" the Variety staff wrote.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n36. \"Como Agua Para Chocolate (Like Water for Chocolate)\" is filled with magical realism.\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 87%\n\nSet in Mexico in the 1900s, \"Como Agua Para Chocolate\" follows Tita (Lumi Cavazos), whose duty is to care for her elderly mother.\n\nShe realizes that she can't marry her true love Pedro (Marco Leonardi). Instead, he marries her sister but remains infatuated with Tita, who finds a way to channel her emotions into cooking.\n\n\"Food and passion create a sublime alchemy in 'Like Water for Chocolate,' a Mexican film whose characters experience life so intensely that they sometimes literally smolder,\" Janet Maslin wrote for The New York Times.\n\nShe continued, \"The kitchen becomes a source of such witchcraft that a fervently prepared meal can fill diners with lust or grief or nausea, depending upon the cook's prevailing mood.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n35. \"The Age of Innocence\" is Martin Scorsese's interpretation of Edith Wharton's 1920 novel.\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 88%\n\n\"The Age of Innocence\" takes place in 19th century New York. A wealthy lawyer (Daniel Day-Lewis) puts his seemingly perfect engagement at risk after he meets his fiancée's elegant cousin (Michelle Pfeiffer).\n\n\"No screen couple has ever been this sexy with their clothes on,\" Peter Travers wrote in Rolling Stone, continuing, \"Scorsese stages their most touching scene in a horse-drawn carriage, huddled together against the forces that divide them.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n34. \"Catherine Called Birdy\" is a sweet coming-of-age medieval comedy set in 1920.\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 88%\n\nThe book adaptation from director Lena Dunham (\"Girls\") follows Lady Catherine aka Birdy (Bella Ramsay) who doesn't care to be married off despite her parents' wishes.\n\n\"Lena Dunham's directorial romp through medieval England's child-marriage scene is largely a winner, thanks in large part to a rambunctious performance from young Bella Ramsey in the title role,\" Brad Newsome wrote for the Sydney Morning Herald.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n33. \"The Dig\" showcases a historical romance in 1939.\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 88%\n\nBased on the 2007 novel of the same name by John Preston, the film focuses on a slow-burn romance that ensues between Edith (Carey Mulligan) and Basil (Ralph Fiennes) ahead of World War II as an excavation for ancient artifacts on her estate ensues.\n\n\"Told with simplicity and grace, and a sensitivity to the pastoral Suffolk landscape of wide fields and wider skies, 'The Dig' is often quite thrilling,\" Sheila O'Malley wrote for RogerEbert.com.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n32. Two British messengers set out on an arduous journey during World War I in \"1917.\"\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 88%\n\nWhen British command realizes that their upcoming attack on the Germans is likely a trap, they send two men to relay the message to the frontlines in time to save their soldiers' lives. \"1917,\" which won three Academy Awards, is an action-packed film that brings viewers along on a high-stakes, seemingly impossible mission.\n\n\"It's the usual action-movie setup — a mission, extraordinary odds, ready-made heroes — but with trenches, barbed wire and a largely faceless threat,\" Manohla Dargis wrote in the New York Times.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n31. \"Titanic\" follows an impassioned romance amid the backdrop of the ship's doomed maiden voyage.\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 88%\n\n\"Titanic\" takes a human approach to the ship's ill-fated maiden voyage in 1912 by allowing the romance between an aristocrat (Kate Winslet) and a poor artist (Leonardo DiCaprio) to take the forefront of the narrative.\n\n\"[James] Cameron, who wrote and directed the film, has put a face on that horrific happening; he has taken us beyond the forensics of the sinking and put us inside the skin and psyches of those who perished and those who survived,\" Duane Bygre wrote in The Hollywood Reporter.\n\nHe continued, \"In both, we see facets of ourselves: In philosophical microcosm, Cameron shows that in the end — both the good and the bad endings — we're all in the same boat.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n30. \"Gandhi\" is a thorough biopic of one of the world's most famous activists.\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 89%\n\nDirector Richard Attenborough captures Mahatma Gandhi (Ben Kingsley)'s life on-screen — from his earliest days as an activist in South Africa to his assassination in 1948.

His fortune goes to his eldest son, and the women are left with no options but to seek their own security through marriages.\n\n\"'Sense and Sensibility' used updated versions of early 19th-century heroes to sell emerging ideals of manhood to the late-20th century, at a time when the pro-feminist men's movement was challenging gender norms in the realm of politics and pop culture,\" Devoney Looser wrote in The Atlantic's review of the film.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. \"Portrait of a Lady on Fire\" is a stunningly shot film providing a glimpse into two women's relationship in 18th century France.\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 97%\n\nSet in the 1700s, a painter named Marianne (Noémie Merlant) arrives at an island in Brittany after being commissioned to paint a wedding portrait of Héloïse (Adèle Haenel), a young aristocrat who refuses to pose for a portrait.\n\nMarianne pretends she is merely an acquaintance to accompany Héloïse on walks, studying her subject's features and painting her in secret.\n\n\"'Portrait of a Lady on Fire' — the fire is figurative, but also real — goes beyond painterly beauty,\" The Wall Street Journal's Joe Morgenstern wrote, adding, \"It sees into souls.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. \"Schindler's List\" is a heartbreaking tale of a German member of the Nazi party that saved the lives of 1,200 Jews during the Holocaust.\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 98%\n\nIn \"Schindler's List,\" Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson) is a member of the Nazi party that employs Jews in his factory during World War II. As the war worsens, he becomes morally invested in saving over a thousand Jews from being sent to concentration camps during the Holocaust.\n\n\"Marked by a brilliant screenplay, exceptionally supple technique, three staggeringly good lead performances and an attitude toward the traumatic subject matter that is both passionately felt and impressively restrained, this is the film to win over Spielberg skeptics,\" Variety's Todd McCarthy wrote.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. \"Selma\" follows the 1965 marches from Selma to Montgomery during the civil rights movement.\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 99%\n\nCentered around the 1965 Selma to Montgomery marches, \"Selma\" tells the story of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.'s (David Oyelowo) campaign for voting rights.\n\nDirector Ava DuVernay's 2014 historical drama highlights people's sacrifice and pain in pursuit of equality, making \"Selma\" a timely, essential watch 55 years after the Voting Rights Act passed.\n\n\"While entirely satisfying on its own, 'Selma' seems to contain the seeds of at least a dozen other movies — a reminder of how fertile the civil rights era is and how poorly it has been explored by popular culture,\" The New York Times critic A.O. Scott wrote.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n1. \"A Room With a View\" transports its audience to the romantic hillsides of Florence.\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 100%\n\n\"A Room With A View\" is based on the novel by E.M.
