        "text": "Lost for decades and now found, SEX DEMON is an erotic grotesquerie that was openly inspired by THE EXORCIST and ABBY. John gives Jim, his lover, a medallion as an anniversary gift. But all hell breaks loose—literally—when the medallion causes Jim to become possessed by a sex demon and wreak havoc on New York's gay cruising spots. Never released on home video, J.C. Cricket's SEX DEMON is a crucial piece of queer horror history that has been preserved from a 16mm release print. Plus: The XXX-rated hauntings continue with DEADLY BLOWS and 10:30 P.M. MONDAY—two formerly lost horror films that also make their uncut home video debuts. In the words of GAY SCENE critic Bruce King: “The squeamish may not want to watch . . . but if you do, you won’t forget!”\n\nSPECIAL FEATURES\n\n• SEX DEMON (1975, J. C.
