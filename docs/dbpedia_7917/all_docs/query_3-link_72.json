        "text": "If you’re looking for sexually explicit movies on Netflix, then you’re in for a real treat. In addition to being able to watch all of the best movies on Netflix, which make the platform one of the best streaming services, anyone with a Netflix subscription can check out all kinds of racy, steamy, and hot and heavy stories with a few clicks. Sometimes viewers want a movie that will add a little steam to their stream, and the granddaddy of the streaming format can also provide that, with a number of films that push the envelope in terms of their sexually explicit nature and nudity.\n\nBelow, we’ve listed over 10 movies that subscribers can watch to expand their explicit viewing horizons so that they can investigate some of the more hot-n-heavy options on the streamer. And, when I say “hot-n-heavy” I do, indeed, mean filled with the sexytimes your gleeful little heart desires. If you're looking for something more intense than most of the offerings in this service's very extensive library, then these are the movies you need to add to your queue. Part the beaded curtain, and follow along as we list the most sexually explicit Netflix titles we could find.\n\nAnne+: The Film (2021)\n\nA continuation of the Dutch drama series of the same name, Anne+: The Film follows Anne (Hanna van Vliet) as she prepares to make one of the biggest decisions of her life: uproot from Amsterdam and move halfway across the world to Montreal. But as she contemplates her past, present, and future, the young and confused woman begins to look deep inside to figure out what she really wants out of life.\n\nIn addition to focusing on love, new beginnings, and the tying up of loose ends, Anne+: The Film also has multiple sex scenes that are passionate to say the least. Nothing too extreme, but things do get hot, heavy, and bare by the time this one is finished.\n\nStream Anne+: The Film on Netflix.\n\nThe Year I Started Masturbating (2022)\n\nLooking for a raunchy Swedish film that blurs the lines between comedy and drama, or love and lust? Well, look no further than The Year I Started Masturbating, a daring exploration of new beginnings in more than one way. After being dumped shortly before her 40th birthday, Hanna (Katia Winter) is forced to reevaluate her wishes and desires in life, which results in her embarking on a journey of self-discovery.\n\nWith a title like The Year I Started Masturbating, it shouldn’t be all that shocking that this dramedy has all kinds of sex scenes throughout its runtime, some of which get extremely hot and heavy.\n\nStream The Year I Started Masturbating on Netflix.\n\nBliss (1997)\n\nLance Young’s 1997 erotic drama, Bliss, follows newlyweds Maria (Sheryl Lee) and Joseph (Craig Sheffer) as they try to get to the bottom of their intimacy issues in a rather unorthodox way. Enlisting the services of tantric specialist Baltazar (Terence Stamp), the couple opens up a pandora’s box of sexual awakening while also digging up some intense past trauma.\n\nOriginally given an NC-17 rating before changes were made to tone down the film, Bliss has its fair share of sex scenes as well as countless conversations about intimacy and other racy topics.\n\nStream Bliss on Netflix.\n\nThe Fifty Shades Movies (2015 - 2018)\n\nBased on E.L. James’ series of romance novels, the Fifty Shades movies introduced a massive audience to the world of erotica and BDSM back in 2015, and didn’t let up until the trilogy concluded a few years later. Centering on the relationship between Ana Steele (Dakota Johnson) and Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan), the box office juggernauts proved that people will come out in droves to watch sultry and intense sex scenes on the big screen.\n\nOnce these movies get going, you can expect to see all kinds of sex scenes, be it more intimate sequences or the franchise’s multiple visits to the “Red Room” where nothing is off the table. This is definitely a “wait until the kids go to bed” movie experience.\n\nStream The Fifty Shades of Grey on Netflix.Stream Fifty Shades Darker on Netflix.Stream Fifty Shades Freed on Netflix.\n\nA Simple Favor\n\nThough there is not as much nudity as in other movies on this list, A Simple Favor is still an extremely sexy experience. A daring whodunnit with numerous twists, turns, and tense situations, the movie follows Stephanie Smothers (Anna Kendrick), a widow who starts looking into her best friend’s (played by Blake Lively) life after she goes missing. But the deeper she looks, less and less makes sense.\n\nPassionate sex scenes, graphic conversations, and a particular painting make this popular Netflix movie a mystery that’ll leave you guessing (and blushing) at every turn.\n\nStream A Simple Favor on Netflix.\n\nAnyone But You (2023)\n\nOne of the best romantic comedies in recent memory, Anyone But You has a rather simple yet effective premise: two people who can’t stand each other decide to act like a couple to prevent a wedding from becoming a complete disaster. Bea (Sydney Sweeney) and Ben’s (Glen Powell) story is up there with some of the great enemies-to-lovers movies from over the years, but unlike Pride and Prejudice, you have a lot, like A LOT, more skin in this raunchy rom-com.\n\nThe on-screen pairing, which started a series of rumors before the film’s release, is electric, to say the least, and adds a lot of sexual tension to the film. This also means you can expect to catch a decent amount of nudity (both male and female) as well as a passionate sex scene, but we’ll leave the rest to your imagination.\n\nStream Anyone But You on Netflix.\n\nMILF (2018)\n\nWith a title like MILF, it’s easy to imagine how Axelle Laffont’s 2018 movie would end up on this list. This French-language sex comedy follows a group of three middle-aged women as they decide to make the most of a trip to the French Riviera by trying their hand at dating younger men.\n\nWith multiple sex scenes, several nude scenes, and some very suggestive conversations throughout its 101-minute runtime, it won’t take long before you realize that this is not a movie you’ll want to watch with your children, parents, or anyone of the faint of heart.\n\nStream MILF on Netflix.\n\nHard Feelings (2023)\n\nGranz Henman’s Hard Feelings (not to be confused with No Hard Feelings, which can be found further down) could be one of the more unique sexually explicit movies on Netflix. This quirky, raunchy, and wild rom-com centers on two friends – Charly (Tobias Schäfer) and Paula (Cosima Henman) – as they attempt to come to terms with feelings they have for one another as well as the fact that their genitals talk to them.\n\nWhile there isn’t nudity around every corner, there is a scene partway through the movie where you are exposed to more genitalia in a short amount of time than probably any other movie on Netflix. Add in some awkward sex scenes, wild conversations, and loads of tension, and you have yourself one hell of an experience.\n\nStream Hard Feelings on Netflix.\n\nBurning Betrayal (2023)\n\nThe 2023 Brazilian Netflix film, Burning Betrayal follows a soon-to-be bride named Babi (Giovanna Lancellotti) as she discovers that her loving, and supposedly faithful fiance has been cheating on her. Instead of letting things go or accepting the infidelity for what it is, the heartbroken and vengeful heroine embarks upon a spiritual and sexual awakening that will lead her to some steamy and dangerous situations.\n\nWith elements of erotic dramas and revenge-driven thrillers, this film adaptation of Sue Hecker’s O Lado Bom de Ser Traida (The Good Side of Being Betrayed) pushes things to the extreme, both with its sensual scenes of sexuality and action-packed scenes. Those latter sequences will surely hold your attention between the film’s various sex scenes.\n\nStream Burning Betrayal on Netflix.\n\nWhite Girl (2016)\n\nElizabeth Wood’s 2016 drama film, White Girl, follows college student Leah (Morgan Saylor) as her life is turned upside down after moving to Queens and meeting Blue (Brian Marc), a small-time drug dealer who becomes her hook-up in more than one way. When Blue is arrested for possession of cocaine, Leah comes up with a plan to get him out of jail, but as they say, the road to Hell is paved with good intentions.\n\nIf you’re looking for a movie that is heavy on romance, drama, and a frightening portrait of life in New York City with its drug dealers, crooked cops, and life-or-death situations, then White Girl is going to do the trick. It’s intense, engaging, and absolutely wild, to say the very least.\n\nStream White Girl on Netflix.\n\nDry Martina (2018)\n\nChe Sandoval’s 2018 film, Dry Martina, follows popular singer Martina Andrade (Antonella Costa) as she makes two discoveries. First, she finds out that she has a long-lost half-sister, and then she discovers she has a great deal of romantic chemistry with her newfound sibling’s boyfriend. What follows is a hilarious yet heartfelt story about a woman finding herself after a bad breakup and discovering what it is to love again.\n\nWith a blend of side-splitting comedy, powerful human drama, and some steamy sex scenes mixed throughout, Dry Martina is a fun, charming, and sometimes intense romantic comedy that offers a little something for everyone.\n\nStream Dry Martina on Netflix.\n\nThrough My Window (2022)\n\nReleased in 2022, Through My Window centers on Raquel Mendoza (Clara Galle), a young woman whose obsession with her uber-wealthy neighbor, Ares Hidalgo (Julio Pena) turns into a swirling romance when she discovers he has the same feelings. Though their families and completely different lifestyles run the risk of ripping the two young lovers apart, they attempt to fight through it all for the sake of love and passion.\n\nThere are multiple sex scenes throughout Through My Window, including some in wild places like a Ferris wheel and a helicopter. But at the same time, the movie also features several of the most sensual sequences on Netflix.\n\nStream Through My Window on Netflix.Also try: Through My Window: Across the Sea on Netflix.Also try: Through My Window 3: Looking At You on Netflix.\n\nNo Hard Feelings (2023)\n\nPart sex comedy, part buddy comedy, and part romantic comedy, No Hard Feelings is one wild ride from start to stop. The movie centers around the cash-strapped Maddie Barker (Jennifer Lawrence) as she responds to a very strange Craigslist ad from the parents of the shy and awkward Percy Becker (Andrew Barth Feldman), who are looking for someone to date their son to help him open up socially before college. She accepts the role to stay afloat ahead of a looming bankruptcy.\n\nYou’ve probably already heard about J-Law’s hilarious nude scene that involves a fight on a moonlit beach, but that is just part of the raunchiness in Gene Stupnitsky's over-the-top yet heartfelt comedy. Multiple sex scenes, several instances of nudity, and probably the most painful accident involving a Chinese finger trap await in this movie that earned its R-rating.\n\nStream No Hard Feelings on Netflix.\n\nCam (2018)\n\nOne of the sexiest movies on Netflix, the 2018 psychological horror film, Cam, follows Alice Ackerman (Madeline Brewer) as she navigates the dark, twisted, and highly profitable world of camgirl websites. Subjected to the whims of her clients, who push the young model to great lengths for their own personal enjoyment, Alice goes on the hunt after someone takes over her account.\n\nDue to the nature of the film, which is one of the best Blumhouse horror releases, it shouldn’t be all that surprising that you will be subjected to sex, nudity, and various instances of disturbing imagery. And while the explicit material isn’t enough to distract you from the intricate story, it is there in bounds.\n\nStream Cam on Netflix.\n\nFair Play (2023)\n\nChloe Domont’s 2023 erotic thriller, Fair Play, introduces audiences to the cutthroat world of hedge funds and the various characters who navigate its murky and dangerous waters. The movie primarily focuses on Emily Meyers (Phoebe Dynevor) and Luke Edmunds (Alden Ehrenreich), two coworkers at the center of its cast who attempt to keep their passionate relationship a secret at the office. But when Emily is given a promotion over Luke, things get out of hand.\n\nFair Play doesn’t really hold back when it comes to sexually explicit content, and its various sex scenes put it in the same category as other erotic thrillers like Basic Instinct, Indecent Proposal, and Disclosure, especially when the drama is ticked up as the story progresses. However, things do get dark, so make sure to go into this movie with that in mind.\n\nStream Fair Play on Netflix.\n\nMore The Merrier (2021)\n\nThose looking for more comedy than drama, as well as more than one partner, Paco Caballero’s 2021 Spanish-language film, More the Merrier (Donde caben dos), should surely do the trick. Instead of focusing on one or two relationships, the movie follows the lives of several couples who are members of a swingers club known as “Paradiso.”\n\nImagine Love Actually, but instead of 10 or so love stories set around Christmas, you get five stories taking place on a single night in the aforementioned swingers club. Instead of trading gifts, they trade partners. It’s fairly light-hearted, but More the Merrier doesn’t shy away from sex, nudity, laughs.\n\nStream More the Merrier on Netflix.\n\nRide Or Die (2021)\n\nThe Japanese psychological thriller, Ride or Die, follows Rei Nagasawa (Kiko Mizuhara) a young woman who leaves her partner and career as a talented plastic surgeon behind to help her former crush, Nanae Shinoda (Honami Sato), who is being tormented physically and mentally by her abusive husband. But when Rei makes a terrible decision that changes all of their lives, things take a turn.\n\nThere’s plenty of drama, steamy sex scenes, and murder to go around, which makes for a rather peculiar combination of tones and emotions for the viewer. This is an intense romance road-trip film like no other.\n\nStream Ride or Die on Netflix.\n\nNo Limit (2022)\n\nDavid M. Rosenthal’s 2022 French-language film, No Limit (Sous Emprise) centers on the relationship shared by young free-diver Roxana (Camille Rowe) and her coach, Pascal (Sofiane Zermani), one that is as intense in the bedroom as it is in the depths of the ocean. Blending spots and romance, this hot and heavy drama shows two highly competitive athletes and loves pushing themselves and each other to new heights.\n\nPhysically, mentally, and emotionally exhausting, No Limit paints an intimate picture of two determined individuals who are drawn together, for better or worse.\n\nStream No Limit on Netflix.\n\nLady Chatterley’s Lover (2022)\n\nBased, of course, on the famed 1929 novel by D.H. Lawrence (which was banned for obscenity in several countries for quite some time), Lady Chatterley’s Lover follows Constance (Emma Corrin), whose husband is paralyzed in WWI and who then requests that his wife find someone to impregnate her so that he can have an heir.\n\nThough angered by his request at first, she eventually finds herself taken with the gamekeeper, Oliver (Jack O’Connell), and they soon begin an affair. Look, I’ve seen a lot in my day, so believe me when I say that what goes down between Connie and Oliver throughout the film (frequently with full or near-complete nudity) surprised even my nearly unshockable sensibilities. If I were ranking the steam level of these movies, I’d have to draw a thermometer that got so hot it exploded for this one.\n\nStream Lady Chatterley’s Lover on Netflix.\n\nMadame Claude (2021)\n\nAnyone looking for hotness that’s rooted in reality should check out Madame Claude, as it’s a biographical drama based on the life of the infamous brothel owner who rose to prominence in late 1960s Paris. Her sex workers plied their trade in an area of the city favored by many of the town’s elite, which gave her quite a bit of power over politicians and criminal figures, but that power didn’t last for very long.\n\nIn watching the successes and eventual downfall of the madam, viewers will be treated to several scenes befitting the profession that’s being investigated, but be warned, there are a few such scenes that are likely to make one uncomfortable.\n\nStream Madame Claude on Netflix.\n\nHigh Society (2018)\n\nThis Korean drama comes from director Byun Hyuk (who also wrote the film), focuses on a young married couple (Park Hae-il and Soo Ae) who are already on an incredibly high rung on the ladder when it comes to social standing, but still seek to make it to an even more elite standing in their community, and how they will do and risk anything to get there. Not only is the sex explicit in this one, but there’s an extended scene that involves some kind of fetish that will truly keep your eyes peeled.\n\nStream High Society on Netflix.\n\nThe 365 Days Franchise (2020-2022)\n\nAdmit it, this trilogy of Netflix original films is probably one of the things that brought you to this list. No one could really blame you, either, as the first movie, 365 Days, hit the streaming giant in the summer of 2020 and quickly became the latest steamy sensation to get users excited and keep everyone talking for a long time. For the uninitiated, the film franchise is based on the Polish novels of the same name by author Blanka Lipińska, telling the story of mafia don Massimo (Michele Morrone) and his captive love interest Laura (Anna-Maria Sieklucka).\n\nHer captivity is a large part of the reason why this movie led many to sign a petition for its removal, but fans loved its exceedingly realistic looking sex scenes. Two sequels, 365 Days: This Day, and The Next 365 Days debuted on April 27, 2022 and August 19, 2022, respectively, and while the franchise-ending cliffhanger frustrated many fans, you can’t beat these films as a whole if you’re looking for some naughty, naked entertainment.\n\nStream 365 Days on Netflix.\n\nStream 365 Days: This Day on Netflix.\n\nStream The Next 365 Days on Netflix.\n\nElisa & Marcela (2019)\n\nAnother movie from Spain, Elisa & Marcela is, this time, based on a true story, and follows two women (Natalia de Molina and Greta Fernández) who meet in the late 1800s and form a strong friendship. But, that bond soon turns into something much deeper, and one of them begins posing as a man so that they can legally marry. This romantic drama will tug on those ol’ heartstrings while delivering some very steamy scenes, which help make it one of the best movies on Netflix with lesbian characters, and make it one of many Netflix movies and shows with great LGBTQ+ representation.\n\nStream Elisa & Marcela on Netflix.\n\nThe After Movies (2020-2022)\n\nSpeaking of youthful dramas with sexytimes, 2020’s After We Collided and 2021’s After We Fell take things a bit further, showing us a slice of complicated romantic life for two college students. While the first film in the trilogy, 2019’s After, is not currently on the streamer, the sequels continue the story of what happened after (Get it?) sexually inexperienced Tessa (Josephine Langford) met and fell for bad boy Hardin (Hero Fiennes Tiffin) during her freshman year.\n\nRight now, you have three hot tales of young love to watch, as the After We Fell ending set up the fourth film in the series based on Anna Todd’s best-selling books (After Ever Happy), which debuted in theaters in September of 2022 came to the streamer a few months later. Meanwhile, a fifth and final installment, After Everything, premiered in September 2023.\n\nStream After We Collided on Netflix.Stream After We Fell on Netflix.Stream After Ever Happy on Netflix.\n\nStream After Everything on Netflix."
