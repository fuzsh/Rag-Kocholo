        "text": "01 of 25\n\n1917 (2019)\n\nSam Mendes immerses us in the hell of war in this visceral drama set in the heart of World War I. Lance corporals William Schofield (George MacKay) and Tom Blake (Dean-Charles Chapman) are tasked with relaying an important message to a superior to call off a scheduled attack that would put British troops in harm's way. Schofield and Blake traverse the precarious battlefields of northern France, and Oscar-winning cinematographer Roger Deakins' expert camerawork makes the film appear to be shot with only two uninterrupted takes. As EW's critic writes, this trick \"effectively drops the viewer into the center of the story and compels them to stay there.\" —Kevin Jacobsen\n\nWhere to watch 1917: Netflix\n\nEW grade: A– (read the review)\n\nDirector: Sam Mendes\n\nCast: George MacKay, Dean-Charles Chapman, Mark Strong, Andrew Scott, Richard Madden, Colin Firth, Benedict Cumberbatch\n\n02 of 25\n\nAftersun (2022)\n\nAn 11-year-old girl tries to understand her increasingly distant father while on vacation in this understated indie drama. At their holiday resort, Sophie (Frankie Corio) videotapes her dad, Calum (Paul Mescal, in an Oscar-nominated performance), who struggles to find meaning in his life. Interspersed throughout the film are present-day segments depicting an adult Sophie (Celia Rowlson-Hall) as she studies the footage from her youth, still looking for answers. Aftersun is a quietly powerful meditation on memory and the relationship between fathers and daughters, directed with great sensitivity by Charlotte Wells in her feature debut. —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch Aftersun: Netflix\n\nDirector: Charlotte Wells\n\nCast: Paul Mescal, Frankie Corio, Celia Rowlson-Hall\n\n03 of 25\n\nCall Me by Your Name (2017)\n\nAn idyllic Italian summer in 1983 is the perfect setting for this sensual romantic drama. Timothée Chalamet, in his breakout performance, plays Elio, a bookish 17-year-old who finds himself unexpectedly drawn to his father's new grad student, Oliver (Armie Hammer), a preppy jock-type who reciprocates those feelings for Elio. The hot summer days only enhance the lust between the young men, as their relationship blossoms.\n\nCall Me by Your Name was a major critical success, with EW's critic writing, \"The small miracle of the movie isn't just that it tells a gay love story with such unreserved tenderness, but that it makes the fate of a romance not meant to last feel like much more than exquisitely framed filmmaking.\" It earned four Oscar nominations, including Best Picture and Best Actor for Chalamet, with James Ivory winning for his adapted screenplay. —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch Call Me by Your Name: Netflix\n\nEW grade: A– (read the review)\n\nDirector: Luca Guadagnino\n\nCast: Timothée Chalamet, Armie Hammer, Michael Stuhlbarg, Amira Casar, Victoire Du Bois\n\n04 of 25\n\nDark Waters (2019)\n\nThis engrossing legal thriller is all the more disturbing when you know it's based on a true story. Mark Ruffalo stars as Rob Bilott, a corporate defense lawyer who discovers evidence of the DuPont corporation's dumping of unregulated chemicals in a West Virginia town that led to health problems for its residents. As Rob investigates the situation he is met with significant pushback, but the more he understands the extent of the coverup the more he's motivated to prosecute those responsible. Auteur director Todd Haynes elevates what could have been a standard social-issue drama by infusing the film with well-earned righteous anger, and Ruffalo is a perfect vessel for our building frustrations. —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch Dark Waters: Netflix\n\nEW grade: B– (read the review)\n\nDirector: Todd Haynes\n\nCast: Mark Ruffalo, Anne Hathaway, Tim Robbins, Bill Camp, Victor Garber, Mare Winningham, Bill Pullman\n\n05 of 25\n\nThe Devil All the Time (2020)\n\nBased on the novel by Donald Ray Pollock, The Devil All the Time features a tangled web of connections spanning the two decades post-WWII. When Arvin (Tom Holland) loses his parents (Bill Skarsgård and Haley Bennett), he moves in with his grandmother. He meets Lenora (Eliza Scanlen), who becomes an unofficial sibling to him. Nearly a decade later, Lenora is seduced by a new reverend in town (Robert Pattinson). She comes close to killing herself after she realizes that she's pregnant and the reverend denies his involvement, but changes her mind at the last second. Unfortunately, it was a second too late.\n\nThis film's not for the faint of heart as it features murder, religious extremism, rape, and other sensitive topics. But with an all-star cast pulling off incredible performances, director Antonio Campos nails the adaptation. —Sammi Burke\n\nWhere to watch The Devil All the Time: Netflix\n\nEW grade: B+ (read the review)\n\nDirector: Antonio Campos\n\nCast: Tom Holland, Bill Skarsgård, Riley Keough, Jason Clarke, Sebastian Stan, Haley Bennett, Eliza Scanlen, Mia Wasikowska, Robert Pattinson, Harry Melling\n\n06 of 25\n\nDownton Abbey (2019)\n\nAfter six seasons of transporting viewers back to post-Edwardian era England, Downton Abbey landed the jump to cinema with this well-received continuation. In a storyline fitting of the big screen, the lords and ladies and their staff prepare for a visit from King George V and Queen Mary. Naturally, there's plenty that goes awry, including an assassination attempt that nearly changes the course of history forever. But don't be alarmed: Fans shouldn't expect too much of a change from the warm-blanket vibes of the original series. As EW's critic writes, \"Solving problems in Downton-world is like unknotting a tangled necklace: There may be difficulties, but rest assured that by the 122-minute mark, as above, so below; all will be right and dreamy with the Abbey.\" —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch Downton Abbey: Netflix\n\nEW grade: B (read the review)\n\nDirector: Michael Engler\n\nCast: Hugh Bonneville, Laura Carmichael, Jim Carter, Raquel Cassidy, Brendan Coyle, Michelle Dockery, Kevin Doyle, Michael C.

If you're not already familiar with the true story of Ted Bundy (played here by Zac Efron), the film's title is unlikely to leave the quality of his character open to debate. What distinguishes director Joe Berlinger's 2019 attempt from the many other true crime retellings of this story, however, is the point of view on which the script is centered.\n\nAdapted from a memoir by Bundy's ex-girlfriend Elizabeth Kendall (Lily Collins), Extremely Wicked tracks Kendall's emotional processing of the case, starting as a girlfriend who refuses to believe her partner could be capable of committing such atrocities and ending as a new woman, finally beginning to heal. EW's critic writes of Efron's performance, \"Alternately charming, belligerent, and incalculably shrewd, he captures both the shark-like charisma of Bundy and the deeply damaged man beneath.\" —S.B.\n\nWhere to watch Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile: Netflix\n\nEW grade: B (read the review)\n\nDirector: Joe Berlinger\n\nCast: Zac Efron, Lily Collins, Kaya Scodelario, Haley Joel Osment, Jim Parsons, John Malkovich, James Hetfield\n\n08 of 25\n\nFrances Ha (2012)\n\nOne of the best-known additions to the mumblecore movement that briefly invaded independent cinema during the mid-2010s, Frances Ha is also one of the most charming. Directed by Noah Baumbach and co-written by the film's star, Greta Gerwig, Frances Ha chronicles a rough period in 27-year-old aspiring dancer Frances Halladay's life. Struggling with the dissolution of one of her closest friendships, financial challenges, and difficulties with her chosen career, Frances is both unmoored and undeterred.\n\nA late-20s coming-of-age story released in 2012, Frances Ha contains some vague similarities to HBO's Girls (Adam Driver, for one), but the film offers such a high level of style, point of view, and performance as to distinguish itself from the rest of the genre. —S.B.\n\nWhere to watch Frances Ha: Netflix\n\nEW grade: B+ (read the review)\n\nDirector: Noah Baumbach\n\nCast: Greta Gerwig, Mickey Sumner, Adam Driver, Michael Zegen\n\n09 of 25\n\nI'm Thinking of Ending Things (2020)\n\nIf you're looking for structure or a linear story with a clearly defined ending, then Charlie Kaufman's I'm Thinking of Ending Things might not be the right film for you. Written and directed by Kaufman and adapted from Ian Reid's novel by the same name, the film is a psychological thriller that traffics in the surreal, shifting fluidly between narrative and free association, all grounded in excellent performances by the film's actors. Jessie Buckley stars as the Young Woman — her name and occupation changing frequently — who contemplates ending her seven-week relationship during a Thanksgiving trip to meet her new boyfriend Jake's (Jesse Plemons) parents (David Thewlis and Toni Collette) at their farmhouse. Throughout the visit, character ages change, an old janitor weaves himself in and out of the story, and a maggot-infested pig makes more than a few appearances.\n\nThere is an explanation for all the absurdity — but you might not catch it on the first viewing. With the film's true premise often clouded, what audiences are left with are Kaufman's \"dizzying stretches of dialogue,\" as EW's critic describes them. These conversations, she says, \"have the quality of both earnest debate and avant-garde theater, ebbing and flowing on their own inscrutable tides.\" —S.B.\n\nWhere to watch I'm Thinking of Ending Things: Netflix\n\nEW grade: B (read the review)\n\nDirector: Charlie Kaufman\n\nCast: Jesse Plemons, Jessie Buckley, Toni Collette, David Thewlis\n\n10 of 25\n\nThe Irishman (2019)\n\nLongtime collaborators Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro reunited for this 2019 gangster epic, about the real-life hitman Frank Sheeran and his experiences working for the Mafia. Spanning several decades, the film tracks Frank's evolution from truck driver to trusted gunman for crime boss Russell Bufalino (Joe Pesci) and bodyguard for the infamous Jimmy Hoffa (Al Pacino). Despite his professional success, his home life deteriorates, particularly his relationship with his daughter.\n\nWhile its 209-minute runtime may be daunting, the film moves along at an entertaining clip (thanks in part to master editor Thelma Schoonmaker), and the viewer's patience is rewarded with a haunting conclusion that recontextualizes all that came before. The Irishman scored 10 Oscar nominations, and though it was criminally shut out when it came to wins, time will be kind to the film, even if it wasn't to Sheeran. —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch The Irishman: Netflix\n\nEW grade: B+ (read the review)\n\nDirector: Martin Scorsese\n\nCast: Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, Joe Pesci, Harvey Keitel, Anna Paquin, Ray Romano, Stephen Graham, Bobby Cannavale\n\n11 of 25\n\nLa La Land (2016)\n\nOld Hollywood was built on movie musicals like La La Land, a modern film that feels like it was transported into theaters directly from 1952. Five years after playing opposite one another in their first collaboration (Crazy, Stupid, Love), Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone are back at it, this time falling in love in Los Angeles. Mia (Stone) and Sebastian (Gosling) are aspiring artists — her an actress, him a jazz musician — both striking out in the City of Angels. After several chance encounters, the two begin dating, their relationship unfolding against the city's most romantic landmarks, all lit and styled to make Los Angeles look as alluring as the dreams Mia and Sebastian can't keep themselves from chasing.\n\nA classic Hollywood musical in the style of Singin' in the Rain, La La Land is a strong argument for a once beloved, now less forgotten movie genre. —S.B.\n\nWhere to watch La La Land: Netflix\n\nEW grade: A (read the review)\n\nDirector: Damien Chazelle\n\nCast: Emma Stone, Ryan Gosling, John Legend, J.K. Simmons, Rosemarie DeWitt, Finn Wittrock\n\n12 of 25\n\nMarriage Story (2019)\n\nNoah Baumbach reached new heights with this bittersweet examination of a relationship in the aftermath of a breaking point. Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver star as Nicole and Charlie, artists in the entertainment industry whose amicable separation soon turns into a nasty divorce and fight for custody over their son. The film even-handedly explores the nature of relationships and societal expectations, with two fully committed performances at its center (plus a scene-stealing, Oscar-winning turn from Laura Dern as Nicole's lawyer). EW's critic calls Marriage Story \"a movie that somehow makes its intimacy seem like a radical act, one messy, heart-wrecking moment at a time.\" —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch Marriage Story: Netflix\n\nEW grade: A– (read the review)\n\nDirector: Noah Baumbach\n\nCast: Scarlett Johansson, Adam Driver, Laura Dern, Alan Alda, Ray Liotta, Julie Hagerty, Merritt Wever\n\n13 of 25\n\nMay December (2023)\n\nTodd Haynes' mesmerizing new film defies genre, blending psychological drama and ironic satire as it unravels. Natalie Portman stars as Elizabeth, a television actress who travels to the home of Gracie (Julianne Moore) — a woman she's set to portray in a film — to study her. Gracie was tabloid fodder in the '90s for her sexual relationship with a boy named Joe, whom she met when he was 13, while she was 36 (loosely inspired by the real-life story of Mary Kay Letourneau). All these years later, the couple is married with three kids, and doing their best to leave their controversy behind them. But the arrival of Elizabeth leads a now-grown-up Joe (Charles Melton) to reexamine his relationship, while Gracie gradually becomes resentful of the actress insinuating herself into their lives.\n\nMay December succeeds most as a well-observed, well-acted character study; the nature of Gracie and Joe's relationship is thorny, but so is Elizabeth's obsessive probing. Because, as the film demonstrates on both a surface and subtextual level, there's always more to the story. —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch May December: Netflix\n\nEW grade: A– (read the review)\n\nDirector: Todd Haynes\n\nCast: Natalie Portman, Julianne Moore, Charles Melton\n\n14 of 25\n\nMiss Juneteenth (2020)\n\nOne of the most underrated indie dramas of the decade so far, Miss Juneteenth is a lived-in examination of a mother and daughter's relationship as they grapple with expectations placed on them. Nicole Beharie plays Turquoise, single mother to Kai (Alexis Chikaeze), who is working multiple jobs to make ends meet. She pushes Kai to compete in the Miss Juneteenth pageant, which she won in her youth, even though her daughter expresses little interest in following in her footsteps. Featuring an impressively naturalistic turn from Beharie — who earned multiple critics' award notices for her work — Miss Juneteenth is a loving yet realistic tribute to finding one's path despite the roadblocks that inevitably pop up along the way. —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch Miss Juneteenth: Netflix\n\nDirector: Channing Godfrey Peoples\n\nCast: Nicole Beharie, Kendrick Sampson, Alexis Chikaeze\n\n15 of 25\n\nMolly's Game (2017)\n\nGenerally critiqued for his struggles in writing complex female characters with agendas independent of the men with whom they work, Aaron Sorkin strikes a commendable balance with Molly’s Game, his feature directorial debut. The story follows Molly Bloom (Jessica Chastain), a young skier who, after her Olympic dreams end in injury, uses her athletically-earned gifts of confidence and composure to run an exclusive underground poker ring.\n\nBased on Molly Bloom's memoir, the film’s two-hour and 20-minute run time races past in a series of flashbacks and narration as Bloom relays her riches-to-rags story to her lawyer (Idris Elba). Fans of celebrity gossip will delight in Michael Cera's performance as an unpleasant Hollywood actor and poker enthusiast who, according to clues dropped in the movie and book, is likely Tobey Maguire. —S.B.\n\nWhere to watch Molly's Game: Netflix\n\nEW grade: A– (read the review)\n\nDirector: Aaron Sorkin\n\nCast: Jessica Chastain, Idris Elba, Kevin Costner, Michael Cera, Jeremy Strong, Chris O'Dowd, Bill Camp\n\n16 of 25\n\nThe Nest (2020)\n\nSean Durkin's enigmatic '80s-set drama is a masterwork of unease. An American family transplants to London for patriarch Rory's (Jude Law) new job, and, despite the promise of prosperity and happiness, soon falls into dysfunction. Rory hasn’t informed his wife, Allison (Carrie Coon), that he’s nearly broke, Allison struggles to adjust to her new life, and their new mansion home is so creaky and uninviting it may as well be haunted. Imbued with dread, The Nest is an enrapturing portrait of a marriage and a family, with two stellar performances in Law and Coon.\n\n\"Durkin captures it all with a sort of menacing restraint, building a deeply disquieting mood from long, almost voyeuristic shots and loaded gazes,\" EW's critic observes. \"Is he giving us gothic romance, domestic drama, existential horror?\" —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch The Nest: Netflix\n\nEW grade: B+ (read the review)\n\nDirector: Sean Durkin\n\nCast: Jude Law, Carrie Coon, Charlie Shotwell, Oona Roche, Adeel Akhtar\n\n17 of 25\n\nOn the Basis of Sex (2018)\n\nThis biopic about Ruth Bader Ginsburg is a compelling saga of a trailblazer in her early years. Felicity Jones portrays the future Supreme Court justice as a young law student looking to make her mark on the world — and frequently running into roadblocks due to her gender in a male-dominated society. She eventually becomes a law professor and sets out to challenge sex-based discrimination, making a name for herself as an equal rights advocate in the process. EW's critic writes that On the Basis of Sex \"represents a noble attempt to showcase the roots of how deeply her efforts and passions would come to alter the fabric of American life.\" —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch On the Basis of Sex: Netflix\n\nEW grade: B (read the review)\n\nDirector: Mimi Leder\n\nCast: Felicity Jones, Armie Hammer, Justin Theroux, Sam Waterston, Kathy Bates\n\n18 of 25\n\nPhantom Thread (2017)\n\nPaul Thomas Anderson's beautiful, dark, twisted love story unfolds with the precision of the urbane fashion designer at its center. Daniel Day-Lewis, in what is presumed to be his final film role, plays Reynolds Woodcock, a celebrated dressmaker in 1950s London who falls in love with Alma (Vicky Krieps), a waitress who soon becomes his muse. Though Reynolds' sister Cyril (a scene-stealing Lesley Manville) fears that Alma may be distracting him from his work, Alma proves herself equally matched with the stubborn Reynolds. With Oscar-winning costumes and a nominated score by Jonny Greenwood, Phantom Thread is a hypnotic (and shockingly honest) exploration of love and the shifting power dynamics therein. —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch Phantom Thread: Netflix\n\nEW grade: B (read the review)\n\nDirector: Paul Thomas Anderson\n\nCast: Daniel Day-Lewis, Vicky Krieps, Lesley Manville\n\n19 of 25\n\nThe Power of the Dog (2021)\n\nSimmering with tension, Jane Campion's moody revisionist Western is a transfixing examination of power and control — and the lengths to which a boy will go to protect his mother. Benedict Cumberbatch stars as Phil, a spiteful rancher who torments his brother's (Jesse Plemons) new wife (Kirsten Dunst) and her sensitive teenage son Peter (Kodi Smit-McPhee) against the backdrop of 1920s Montana. As Phil plays psychological mind games on his farm's new inhabitants, Peter quietly calculates how to get back at his uncle after discovering a buried secret. The widely-acclaimed drama earned a whopping 12 Oscar nominations, including acting nominations for all four central performances, with Campion becoming only the third woman to win Best Director. —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch The Power of the Dog: Netflix\n\nEW grade: A– (read the review)\n\nDirector: Jane Campion\n\nCast: Benedict Cumberbatch, Jesse Plemons, Kirsten Dunst, Kodi Smit-McPhee, Thomasin McKenzie, Genevieve Lemon, Keith Carradine, Frances Conroy\n\n20 of 25\n\nPrivate Life (2018)\n\nThis emotional dramedy from Tamara Jenkins follows a middle-aged couple and their painstaking efforts to have a baby. With Richard (Paul Giamatti) having sperm issues and Rachel (Kathryn Hahn) struggling with in vitro fertilization, the couple is desperate for solutions. After their niece, Sadie (Kayli Carter), goes to live with them, Rachel considers asking her for help, leading to awkward family tension when Sadie's parents find out. Emotionally honest with just the right dash of humor, Private Life is a poignant slice of family drama anchored by Hahn's vulnerable performance. As EW's critic writes of the film, \"It’s about perseverance, compassion, and empathy.\" —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch Private Life: Netflix\n\nEW grade: A– (read the review)\n\nDirector: Tamara Jenkins\n\nCast: Paul Giamatti, Kathryn Hahn, Kayli Carter, Molly Shannon, John Carroll Lynch, Desmin Borges, Denis O'Hare\n\n21 of 25\n\nSweet Girl (2021)\n\nKillers for hire, big pharma's lies, and a touch of corporate espionage, oh my! Sweet Girl's got it all. Starring Jason Momoa as Ray, a man seeking answers and responsibility after his wife's death, Sweet Girl puts the greed of pharmaceutical companies on blast. Featuring subway stabbings, FBI ambushes, and a twist that nobody could see coming, this action-packed drama is definitely the film version of a page-turner. (A scene-flipper? Frame-forwarder? Eh, we'll work on that.) Sweet Girl received mixed critical reviews, but anything that can make your jaw drop like that is a winner in our book. —S.B.\n\nWhere to watch Sweet Girl: Netflix\n\nDirector: Brian Andrew Mendoza\n\nCast: Jason Momoa, Isabela Merced, Manuel Garcia-Rulfo, Adria Arjona, Raza Jaffrey, Justin Bartha, Lex Scott Davis, Michael Raymond-James, Amy Brenneman\n\n22 of 25\n\nThank You For Your Service (2017)\n\nWhile numerous films have depicted the hellishness of war, sometimes the more interesting story comes from what happens when soldiers return home. Such is the case with Thank You For Your Service, which finds Miles Teller's Iraq War veteran Adam Schumann struggling to readjust to life in Kansas between his PTSD and survivor's guilt. The underrated drama, as EW's critic writes, proved \"successful at capturing the Iraq War's effects on American lives,\" centering on the specific sense of malaise experienced by veterans coming back to a country that doesn't always provide them with the help they need to re-acclimate. —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch Thank You For Your Service: Netflix\n\nEW grade: N/A (read the review)\n\nDirector: Jason Hall\n\nCast: Miles Teller, Haley Bennett, Joe Cole, Amy Schumer, Beulah Koale, Scott Haze\n\n23 of 25\n\nTo Leslie (2022)\n\nThe 2023 Oscar nominations featured high-profile favorites like Top Gun: Maverick and Avatar: The Way of Water, but Andrea Riseborough's surprise nomination for this largely unknown indie drama was one of the top stories of the day. Riseborough stars as the eponymous Leslie, a Texas woman who wastes her lottery winnings on drugs and alcohol and is now looking for a second chance, hoping to make amends with her estranged son.\n\nTo Leslie had a tiny release in 2022 but was subsequently boosted by numerous celebrity endorsements for Riseborough, with the film's creative team forgoing traditional awards campaigning in favor of strong word of mouth. While the film treads a similar path as other stories about addiction, the strength of Riseborough's raw performance is more than enough to make this worth watching. —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch To Leslie: Netflix\n\nDirector: Michael Morris\n\nCast: Andrea Riseborough, Allison Janney, Marc Maron, Andre Royo, Owen Teague, Stephen Root\n\n24 of 25\n\nWonder (2017)\n\nWonder follows a 10-year-old boy named Auggie (Jacob Tremblay) as he deals with the common trials and tribulations of growing up. However, what makes Auggie's story unique is his medical condition: a rare facial deformity called mandibulofacial dysostosis, which he hides by wearing an astronaut helmet in public. Upon making the transition from homeschooling to private school, Auggie struggles to fit in but ultimately makes friends with another boy, though their friendship is put to the test when he makes fun of Auggie behind his back. It's an uplifting story that earns your emotional investment; as EW's critic writes, \"Yes, you’ve seen some version of this before, but rarely done this well, this tastefully, and with this much restraint.\" —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch Wonder: Netflix\n\nEW grade: B+ (read the review)\n\nDirector: Stephen Chbosky\n\nCast: Jacob Tremblay, Julia Roberts, Owen Wilson, Mandy Patinkin, Daveed Diggs\n\n25 of 25\n\nThe Wonder (2022)\n\nFollowing the Great Famine in 19th-century Ireland, British nurse Lib (Florence Pugh) is called to look after a girl who has not eaten in months, claiming to be fed with \"manna from Heaven.\" As villagers come to be in the presence of a seemingly holy girl, Lib meets a journalist (Tom Burke) who suspects it all to be a ruse.\n\nTackling themes of science vs. faith and family trauma, this period drama nearly tips over into gothic horror, brimming with moody atmosphere. As EW's critic notes, \"The sumptuous cinematography, by Ari Wegner (The Power of the Dog, Zola), makes the landscape look like a Brönte novel, full of windswept moors and flickering, fire-lit shadows. Pugh, too, is pretty much perfectly cast, an actress with such a keen emotional presence that she tends to cut through pretense and triviality like a hot knife.\" —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch The Wonder: Netflix\n\nEW grade: B (read the review)\n\nDirector: Sebastián Lelio\n\nCast: Florence Pugh, Kíla Lord Cassidy, Tom Burke, Niamh Algar, Elaine Cassidy, Caolán Byrne, Toby Jones, Ciarán Hinds"
