        "text": "Movies vs. Television Industry: An Overview\n\nThese days, it seems like it is all about the small screen. More and more people are gathering around to binge-watch reality TV shows, stream whole seasons of series, and watch missed favorites. Fewer and fewer people are heading out to movie theaters to plunk down a hefty fee for two hours of entertainment. The COVID-19 pandemic has further exacerbated this divergence. So which entertainment sector is more profitable: movies or TV? Let’s take a look.\n\nThe Movie Industry\n\nFor many people, it is tough to justify spending $20 to $30 per movie when you factor in popcorn and drinks with the ticket price. Hollywood studios have been churning out more big-budget tentpole films (films whose earnings are expected to bolster the company financially), 3D movies, and action-adventure tales since audiences are more likely to splurge on a flashy, explosion-heavy movie than they are on a small, intimate drama.\n\nFilmmaking is also a very risky investment, since most movies, even those small, intimate dramas, take several million dollars to make. Still, it’s definitely a hugely profitable business—if you hit the jackpot (aka the target audience). When the theatrical run for a film ends, studios earn money from home video, streaming, and video on demand (VOD).\n\nThe Television Industry\n\nSo which medium is more profitable, movies or TV? One of cable’s most successful brands, HBO, saw enormous profit margins with now-classic shows like The Sopranos and Sex and the City. Then along came Game of Thrones.\n\nCompetition from Netflix Inc. (NFLX), Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN)'s Prime Video, and Hulu inspired HBO to roll out its standalone subscription service Max. HBO has also partnered with major movie studios to launch movies exclusively in theaters and on Max.\n\nMeanwhile, many of the major TV companies are launching their own streaming services to stay competitive. This includes Comcast's launch of Peacock, which includes channels and networks like Oxygen, Syfy, CNBC, NBC, Universal Pictures, and DreamWorks.\n\nThen there's Paramount's Paramount+, which includes Nickelodeon, Showtime, CBS, NBC, ABC, Miramax, and Paramount Pictures. Apple TV also launched in 2006 from Apple (AAPL).\n\nThe Bottom Line"
