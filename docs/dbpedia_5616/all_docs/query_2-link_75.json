        "text": "Carrie Coon wed actor, playwright, and screenwriter Tracy Letts in 2013, and together they share two children. The couple met during a 2010 theatre production of Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? and had an unconventional wedding to say the least.\n\nTheir nuptials took place at a hospital after Tracy was rushed in for emergency gallbladder surgery. With their marriage license set to expire, the duo decided to say 'I do' and avoid re-registering.\n\n\"I have a healthy, happy marriage. When I was younger, let's say I didn't always conduct myself with integrity in my relationships. Now I've found a partner who I can be truly honest with, I never want to go back,\" Carrie told The Guardian in 2021.\n\nLike his wife, Tracy has established an impressive career with acting credits in The Big Short (2015), Lady Bird (2017), Ford v. Ferrari (2019) and Little Women (2019). As a playwright, he is also known for penning August: Osage County, which won a Pulitzer Prize and was later adapted into an Oscar-nominated film starring Meryl Streep and Julia Roberts.\n\nMorgan Spector first crossed paths with BAFTA-winning actress, Rebecca Hall, in 2014 after co-starring in the Broadway play, Machinal. They were married a year later and have since welcomed their daughter Ida in 2018.\n\nVicky Cristina Barcelona (2008), The Town (2010), Transcendence (2014) and The Night House (2020) are among Rebecca's extensive filmography. Most recently, she reprised her role as Ilene Andrews in Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire, which as of 2024 holds the record for the highest-grossing Godzilla film of all time.\n\n\"We live in the countryside away from everything, a very rural situation,\" the actress said of her home life with Morgan.\n\nPatrick Page – aka Richard Clay – has been married to TV personality Paige Davis since 2001. She is best known as the host of the home improvement show, Trading Spaces (2001-2008), and its 2018 reboot.\n\nPatrick and Paige's love story quite literally hails from a fairytale, as they met while playing candelabra Lumiere and feather duster Babette in a national stage tour of Beauty and the Beast. In 2014, Paige explained that she and Patrick had decided not to have children after having an \"eye-opening discussion at dinner a number of years ago.\"\n\n\"We were talking about having a baby when I admitted I'd only be doing it for him. Then he said, 'Well, I was only considering it for you,'\" she recalled on her blog.\n\nChristine Baranski fell for actor Matthew Cowles while working on a theatre production of Henrik Ibsen's Ghosts in 1982. Matthew had offered her a lift home on his motorcycle, and the \"rest is history,\" Christine quipped to The Guardian.\n\nThe couple had two daughters – Isabel and Lily – and were married for 30 years before Matthew's passing in May 2014.\n\n\"I think every marriage is supremely challenging, but my late husband was enormously supportive and very proud of me, and I think we managed it quite well. He was an exceptional person,\" Christine said of Matthew.\n\nIn 2018, the Gilded Age star spoke candidly of her loss. \"There's no shortcut to grief. A few months after Matthew passed away I had to be back in front of a camera, but it helped to be with my community of people\" she told Parade.\n\n\"The death of a loved one is not only deeply sad but also very disorienting. When you've had a 30-year marriage and sat across from this person every morning having coffee, it's so strange. Someone is there and then suddenly they're not there to talk to ever again.\""
