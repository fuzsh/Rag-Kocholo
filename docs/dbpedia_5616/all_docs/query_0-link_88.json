        "text": "Julia Roberts, a mom of 3, knows parenting can be hard work sometimes. Especially nowadays, when you just turn on the TV and have no idea what may pop up this time. So today, we have the lovely Julia Roberts sharing her parenting rules and what lies behind her 20-year-old break from acting.\n\n20 years of a happy marriage\n\nRoberts met her husband, Danny Moder, on the set of a movie they were working on together. The couple has been together for 20 years and is still as in love as when they first began dating. Roberts told Gayle King that she still got butterflies whenever she thought of her husband of 2 decades.\n\nTalking to Oprah Winfrey about why she was so happy and finally satisfied with her life, Roberts confessed, “A huge part of it is my marriage. My husband, Danny, has really shined the light for me. Because of being married, I’ve met people and experienced all these little things that have nurtured my life — not so much changed it, just nurtured it in a way that’s astounding.”\n\nRoberts put her career on hold.\n\nFor many years, we didn’t see Roberts appear in any acting roles. The actress mentioned that she had to consider both her husband’s work schedule and her children’s schedules before she could make any drastic decisions about accepting a new role. She focused on raising her children and being there for them when their father wasn’t around.\n\nShe opened up about parenting.\n\nInvision/Invision/East News\n\nJulia Roberts is not the kind of mother who lets her children get away with everything. She has admitted to having strict parenting methods and mentioned that she has forbidden her 3 children from using social media and limits the amount of TV they watch. “I try to keep them off social media because I don’t really understand what they need that for right now”, she said.\n\n“I have a sense of great pride in being home with my family,” Roberts said. According to Fox News, Roberts is a strict mom, she doesn’t really lose her temper but thinks that it’s important that children know their boundaries. “If something happens I don’t really punish them, I prefer to have conversations with them. I think my serious face is punishment enough,” she added.\n\nKeeping their kids out of the spotlight is one of Roberts and Moder’s top priorities when it comes to parenting. Because Roberts loves her private time with her little ones, the Hollywood pair relocated from the busy city of Los Angeles and settled in San Francisco. “She wanted her children, who are growing up so fast, to have the experience of a city with a different energy and vibe,” a pal of the actress exclusively told Closer in June 2020. “Her kids are not movie star kids in San Francisco, where no one cares who your mom is.”\n\nCareer and family\n\nIn an interview with CBS Sunday Morning, Roberts shared her feelings on her career and her family, noting that acting “is my dream come true, but it is not my only dream come true.” When she was asked about her other dreams, the Oscar winner pointed to her family, sharing, “The life that I’ve built with my husband, with our children. And that’s the best stuff. The point is to come home at the end of the day triumphantly to them.”\n\nQuiet and normal family life is essential to Roberts, and she said she works hard at keeping a balance. Her kids do regular chores, like making their beds and doing laundry because those are “important life skills.”\n\nWhat are the parenting methods you would recommend to other parents? Let us know in the comments!"
