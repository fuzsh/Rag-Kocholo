        "text": "One of the most celebrated comedies of 1999 is “Notting Hill,” starring Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant. Written by Richard Curtis and directed by Roger Michell, the film tells of a famous movie actress named Anna Scott who falls in love with a small-town England bookstore owner named William Thacker. Released 25 years ago in May 1999, “Notting Hill” was a major box office success, grossing $364 million worldwide on a $42 million budget. Read on for more about the “Notting Hill” 25th anniversary.\n\nThe nation’s critics gave mostly positive reviews to “Notting Hill,” unusual for a studio romantic comedy. Derek Elley in Variety wrote, “[The film] has buckets to spare of that rarest screen commodity — genuine, engaging charm — plus a cast and production values that fully deliver.” Wesley Morris in San Francisco Examiner said, “Director Michell isn’t content to rest on his stars’ slapstick laurels, mining instead the more sophisticated if subversive socio-romantic pratfalls in Curtis’ script.” And Roger Ebert wrote in the Chicago Sun-Times, “The movie is bright, the dialogue has wit and intelligence, and Roberts and Grant are very easy to like.”\n\nWith “Notting Hill” released to strong reviews as well as big box office, was it possible for this film to be an awards player in early 2000? Many voting bodies push the comedy genre aside, especially romantic comedies, but there was enough passion and respect for “Notting Hill” throughout the summer and fall of 1999 that a couple of Academy Award nominations seemed possible. The Oscar success five years prior for the romantic comedy “Four Wedding and a Funeral,” which got Best Picture and Best Original Screenplay nominations, starred Grant and was written by Curtis, proved that “Notting Hill” had potential in getting into, at minimum, Best Original Screenplay for Curtis at the 72nd Academy Awards. In addition, Roberts was a two-time Academy Award nominee at that point, which included a Best Actress nom for her mega-hit 1990 comedy “Pretty Woman.” She gives one of her finest performances in “Notting Hill,” and she likely had some Oscar buzz headed into awards season.\n\nSEE Watch our lively chats with dozens of 2024 Emmy contenders\n\n“Notting Hill” started strong at the Golden Globe Awards, where it received three nominations, all in the Comedy or Musical category — Best Actor for Grant, Best Actress for Roberts and Best Picture. In a category that also included Robert De Niro for “Analyze This,” Rupert Everett for “An Ideal Husband” and Sean Penn for “Sweet and Lowdown,” Grant was likely in second place behind the eventual winner Jim Carrey for his astonishing performance in “Man on the Moon.” I would argue Milos Forman’s biopic about Andy Kaufman is a drama, not a comedy, and that it landed in the wrong category at the Golden Globe Awards.\n\nRoberts also had a shot at a Golden Globes win in a category that included Julianne Moore for “An Ideal Husband,” Sharon Stone for “The Muse” and Reese Witherspoon for “Election,” the latter an especially inspired choice. Roberts ultimately lost to Janet McTeer for “Tumbleweeds,” McTeer being the only actor in this category to be nominated for her performance at the Oscars. And in Best Comedy/Musical Picture, “Notting Hill” was pushed aside, along with other contenders “Analyze This,” “Being John Malkovich” and “Man on the Moon,” for the winner “Toy Story 2,” a fantastic victory in this category.\n\nDespite its losses at the Golden Globes, “Notting Hill” could’ve still broken through at the Oscars if it had been nominated for at least a couple things at either Critics Choice or SAG, but sadly it missed entirely at those two precursor ceremonies. It did get four Blockbuster Entertainment Award nominations, three Satellite Award nominations, and two Kids’ Choice Awards nominations. And the movie wasn’t ignored at BAFTA, winning the Audience Award for Favorite Film, and being nominated for Best Supporting Actor for Rhys Ifans and Best British Film. Ifans is a stand-out in “Notting Hill” as William’s flat-mate and would’ve been an amazing Supporting Actor nomination at the Academy Awards.\n\nUnfortunately, “Notting Hill” didn’t show up anywhere on Oscar nominations morning, not in Best Actress for Roberts or in Best Original Screenplay for Curtis. The Actress line-up in early 2000 is weak enough that Roberts (and Witherspoon for that manner) could’ve broken through, and in Best Original Screenplay, Curtis should’ve taken the slot that went to Mike Leigh for “Topsy-Turvy.” However, given the landmark year in film that was 1999 and all the intense competition from lots of year-end dramas, it’s clear why “Notting Hill” came up short at the Oscars. Roberts wasn’t nominated for her delicious romantic comedy turn two years prior for “My Best Friend’s Wedding,” so her also missing for “Notting Hill” made sense. She needed a memorable turn in a drama — 2000’s “Erin Brockovich” — to get a third nomination, and a win, in Best Actress at the following year’s Academy Awards ceremony.\n\nDespite “Notting Hill” only getting nominated at the Golden Globes and BAFTA, this film continues to be a favorite for many 25 years later. The chemistry between Roberts and Grant is incredible, the comedic moments still land, and the emotion of the story rings true. In the Chicago Tribune, Mark Caro wrote, “[The movie is] funny, sympathetic, and smart, and it boasts a likable cast of characters led by two performers who have star power and know how to use it.” I couldn’t have said it better myself.\n\nPREDICT the 2024 Emmy nominees through July 17\n\nMake your predictions at Gold Derby now.
