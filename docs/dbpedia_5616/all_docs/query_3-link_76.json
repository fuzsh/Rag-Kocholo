What did you think of the film?\n\nWADING RIVER, NY — A new movie starring Julia Roberts that filmed at several locations around Riverhead in April, 2022, and debuted on Netflix Friday has shot to #1 in theGlobal Top 10on Netflix in less than a week.\n\nAccording to Netflix, so far, the film has garnered 41,700,000 views, for a total of 98,700,000 hours in viewing time.\n\nA description by Netflix of \"Leave the World Behind\" hinted at the film's suspense: \"A family’s vacation is upended when two strangers arrive at night, seeking refuge from a cyberattack that grows more terrifying by the minute, forcing everyone to come to terms with their places in a collapsing world.\"\n\nAccording to Netflix, in the \"apocalyptic thriller\" from award-winning writer and director Sam Esmail (Mr. Robot), Amanda (played by Academy Award winner Julia Roberts) and her husband Clay (portrayed Academy Award nominee Ethan Hawke), rent a luxurious home for the weekend with their kids, Archie (Charlie Evans) and Rose (Farrah Mackenzie).\n\nBased on the National Book Award-nominated novel by Rumaan Alam, \"Leave the World Behind\" is produced by Esmail Corp, Red Om Films, and executive produced by Higher Ground Productions.\n\nAlthough Roberts wasn't spotted on Hulse Landing Road in Wading River, where filming was taking place last year, her co-star Ethan Hawke was reportedly on set, according to the Riverhead News-Review.\n\nNetflix began filming \"\"Leave the World Behind,\" in April, 2022 on Long Island — with first stops in the Lloyd Neck section of the Village of Lloyd Harbor, in the town of Huntington, Newsday reported.\n\nA Long Island home was also featured predominantly in the film, Jeffrey Ramirez, partner and brand designer for The Up Studio, an architecture and interior design firm, told Patch.\n\n\"We designed a home on the North Shore of Long Island in 2019 that we call the Open Corner House,\" he said; that home is located in Old Westbury and is designed \"to capture sunlight,\" a description reads.\n\n\"In 2020, a Netflix location scout called me and we, along with the homeowners, were able to coordinate that home being rented as the main set location for the film, Ramirez said. \"All of the characters spend the vast majority of the film at the house we designed, which was also re-created on a sound stage for certain special effects.\"\n\nThe movie also filmed up at some Hudson Valley locations, although the action is set on Long Island.\n\nAccording to Variety: \"'Leave the World Behind' is a story about two families, strangers to each other, who are forced together on a long weekend gone terribly wrong. . .The story explores the complexities of parenthood, race, and class — along with how our closest bonds are reshaped in moments of crisis.\"\n\nDenzel Washington was initially slated to star alongside Roberts, but later, it was announced that Ali would be taking the role, Newsday said.\n\nThe film was produced by Roberts through her Red Om Films, and Esmail and Chad Hamilton through Esmail Corp; Red Om's Lisa Gillan and Marisa Yeres Gill were producers, Deadline said; Alam also executive produced.\n\nAccording to Netflix, the film is based on Alam's novel. The book was published in October 2020 and was a finalist for the 2020 National Book Awards; Alam's work has also garnered other accolates, including having been named A Best Book of the Year by The Washington Post, NPR, Time, Esquire and Elle, Deadline reported.\n\nA resolution passed 5 to 0 by the Riverhead town board last year stated that Netflix Productions, LLC was expected to film for a period of two days, with one rain day, if needed.\n\nFilming was slated for four separate locations around Riverhead: Hulse Landing Road, between Sound Avenue and New York State Route 25A in Wading River; Sound Avenue, between East Winds Drive and Hulse Landing Road; Twomey Avenue, between Sound Avenue and Youngs Avenue; and Horton Avenue, between Reeves Avenue and Sound Avenue, the resolution said.\n\nNetflix also required the assistance of Riverhead Town Police regarding road closures, traffic control and escort, the resolution said; the town was paid $75,000 for the film production.\n\nA publicist for Netflix at the time told Patch that she could not confirm the Riverhead shoot, as filming location information is never released, both \"for security, and to minimize any disturbance to the neighborhood.\"\n\nGet more local news delivered straight to your inbox.
