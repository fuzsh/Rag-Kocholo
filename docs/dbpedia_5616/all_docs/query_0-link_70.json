        "text": "Emma Roberts revealed in a new interview that some of her favorite comfort movies star her famous aunt, Julia Roberts—and that she’d be open to working with her on future projects.\n\n“I would love to find the perfect project for me and my aunt, and I know that there will be something,” the actor told Variety. “But it’s never been the right thing. She’s the best, and I want to do something with her. We send each other books and talk about stuff but it hasn’t been right.”\n\nThough the relatives haven’t found a project they’d want to work on together yet, Roberts shared that she often rewatches movies starring her aunt to feel at ease. “I watch her movies when I’m on location and I’m by myself,” she shared. “I have movies of hers downloaded on my computer that I watch for comfort. ‘My Best Friend’s Wedding’ and ‘America’s Sweethearts’ are my safe movies.”\n\nRoberts, who recently starred in films Space Cadet and Madame Web, also talked about her past projects, going all the way back to her role as a child actor on Nickelodeon's “Unfabulous.” Speaking of her experience on the show’s set, she shared how “completely horrified” and “shocked” she was to learn about the abusive allegations against the network in the Quiet on Set documentary.\n\n“[The documentary] made me really, really, really sad that that was happening to people that I literally saw often and had no idea. For me, my show, ‘Unfabulous,’ the showrunner we had was this amazing woman named Sue Rose. And I didn’t realize at the time, but a female showrunner back then was not very common,” she shared, adding that her mom refused to let the then-13-year-old actor out of sight. “It makes me really sad, and I just feel like children need to be protected on sets, as do adults, and I feel like we’re working towards a better work environment in that sense.”"
