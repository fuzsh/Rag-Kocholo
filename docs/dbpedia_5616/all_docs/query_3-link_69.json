        "text": "It resulted, the Times reported, that eventually, the actors worked more with each of their stand-ins than each other.\n\nWhen asked about working with Nolte before the movie opened in a 1993 New York Times story, Roberts said that he was \"completely disgusting.\"\n\n\"From the moment I met him we sort of gave each other a hard time, and naturally we get on each other's nerves,\" she said.\n\nThe star went on to say Nolte can be \"completely charming and very nice,\" but \"he's also completely disgusting. He's going to hate me for saying this, but he seems to go out of his way to repel people. He's a kick.\"\n\n28 years later, Nolte finally gave his side of the story to Insider while chatting about his latest project, the indie film \"Rittenhouse Square.\"\n\nHas he ever reached out to Roberts and buried the hatchet?\n\n\"No, I haven't. Though it's buried,\" the 81-year-old three-time Oscar nominee said. \"I mean, it was absurd what we went through. It was partly my fault, and a little bit of hers. Julia got married at the beginning of that film and it was one of those things where I just approached it all wrong.\"\n\nA representative for Roberts didn't respond to Insider's request for comment.\n\nRelated stories\n\nRoberts married musician Lyle Lovett in June 1993 and they divorced less than two years later. She has been married to cinematographer Daniel Moder since 2002.\n\nSince \"I Love Trouble,\" Roberts went on to become one of the biggest stars in Hollywood, winning an Oscar in 2001 for \"Erin Brockovich.\" She currently stars opposite George Clooney in the hit rom-com \"Ticket to Paradise.\"\n\nNolte, always considered a bad boy of Hollywood throughout his career, continued to work regularly between Hollywood titles and indies through the late 1990s and 2000s, getting two Oscar nominations along the way for 1997's \"Affliction\" and 2011's \"Warrior.\" Most recently he's stayed away from studio movies.\n\n\"My connection is to the story itself,\" Nolte told Insider. \"The stories in Hollywood are just so few that I don't know of them anymore.\""
