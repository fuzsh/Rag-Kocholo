        "text": "As the niece of Julia Roberts and daughter of Eric Roberts, actor Emma Roberts learned a lesson or two about show business before entering it herself. While on Bruce Bozzi’s Table for Two podcast, the American Horror Story lead was asked whether becoming a “massive movie star” was ever a professional priority for her.\n\n“I saw very up close what that really looks like with my aunt Julia,” Roberts replied. “It’s fun and it’s great, but there is a part of it that’s really scary. And so I’ve always wanted to kind of carve my own path…Fame has never been the goal, because fame at a certain level is kind of scary.”\n\n“Even in my later teens, I was like, I never want my fame to outweigh my work,” she continued. “Because there’s nothing scarier to me than being so famous that you’re never left alone, but also you’re not getting good jobs. And that was kind of happening to a lot of people, I think, when I was in my teens and early 20s. And that really scared me, and so I never wanted that to happen to me.”\n\nRoberts broke out in the early-2000s Nickelodeon series Unfabulous before starring in Nancy Drew, We’re the Millers, Valentine’s Day (alongside her aunt), the TV series Scream Queens, and, more recently, Madame Web. As the relative of two Oscar honorees, she was also asked to wade into Hollywood’s intrepid nepo-baby discourse during the podcast. “I think there’s two sides of the coin,” Roberts said. “People like to say, you know, you have a leg up because you have family in the industry. But then the other side to that is, you know, you have to prove yourself more. Also, if people don’t have good experiences, maybe, with other people in your family, then you’ll never get a chance.”\n\nShe continued: “Everybody loves the kind of overnight success story. And so if you’re kind of not the girl from the middle of nowhere that broke into Hollywood, there’s kind of an eye roll of like, ‘Well, your dad was this.’ And I always joke, I’m like, ‘Why is no one calling out George Clooney for being a nepo baby? [His aunt] Rosemary Clooney was an icon.’ But I feel like also the point is, young girls get it harder with the nepo-baby thing. Like, I don’t really see people calling out sons of famous actors, not that they should be called out.”\n\nRoberts concluded that those who criticize nepo babies “only see your wins, because they only see when you’re on the poster of a movie—they don’t see all the rejection along the way. That’s why I’m always very open about things I’ve auditioned for and haven’t gotten the part for.”\n\nHollywood\n\nGeorge Clooney Endorses Kamala Harris, Praises Biden for Dropping Out\n\nLess than two weeks ago, Clooney penned a New York Times op-ed headlined, “I Love Joe Biden. But We Need a New Nominee.”\n\nPolitics\n\nWhere Do the Obamas Stand on Joe Biden? “If President Obama Was All In, He’d Be All In.”\n\nAs the threat of another Trump presidency looms, America turns its eyes to Michelle and Barack Obama, still the most powerful politicians in the world—whether they like it or not.\n\nAward Season\n\nJoan Chen Has Always Been a Movie Star. Hollywood Is Finally Catching Up\n\nThe veteran actor has worked with Bernardo Bertolucci, David Lynch, and Ang Lee, and maintained rich careers in both China and the US. With the new film Dìdi, Oscar buzz is trailing her for the first time. What took so long?\n\nAward Season\n\nHow Timothée Chalamet’s Bob Dylan Biopic Could Shape This Year’s Oscar Race\n\nWith A Complete Unknown, the Oscar nominee could be back in the race for the first time since his breakout in Call Me by Your Name. But that’s only the beginning of the awards potential for this movie.\n\nAward Season\n\nHow Ripley Changed Dakota Fanning: “If I Can Do That, I Can Do Anything”\n\nAfter nearly 25 years onscreen, Fanning just received her first Emmy nomination for the Netflix series. She tells Vanity Fair why it represents her next chapter in Hollywood: “People feel like they know me, but then they also don’t.”\n\nAward Season\n\nBaby Reindeer’s Jessica Gunning Never Saw Martha as a Villain\n\n“She’s so much more than that,” says the newly minted Emmy nominee of her breakout role in the Netflix hit series.\n\nCelebrity\n\nTom Girardi and the Real Housewives Trial of the Century\n\nThe personal injury lawyer was made famous by Erin Brockovich and infamous by a divorce that played out on Bravo. As his federal fraud trial gets underway in Los Angeles, the attorney who blew the whistle on him describes how he came to see the saga as “significantly worse than what Bernie Madoff did.”\n\nAward Season\n\nViggo Mortensen Speaks His Mind: On Amazon’s “Shameful” Decision, Green Book’s “Disingenuous” Critics, and Indie Film’s Unclear Future\n\nThe Oscar nominee, whose acclaimed new film, The Dead Don’t Hurt, has just hit VOD, offers his frank assessment of Hollywood.\n\nMovies\n\nWhen You’re 23 and Spielberg Calls: The Wild Origin Story of Jon M. Chu\n\nIn an excerpt from his new memoir, the director of Crazy Rich Asians and Wicked remembers the shock and awe.\n\nAward Season\n\nVenice and Toronto Film Festival Lineups Raise Our Oscar Hopes\n\nHotly anticipated films like Joker: Folie à Deux and The Piano Lesson are mixed with some wild cards that could shake up awards season."
