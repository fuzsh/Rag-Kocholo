        "text": "“I would say to any actor is don’t take advice from actors. It would be the worst thing to do because we all have our unique experience.” – Julia Roberts\n\nAcademy Award-winning actress Julia Roberts may have been less visible on the screen over the last few years, but the popular actress is still one of the most beloved American actresses. This year, Roberts attended Cannes to present this year’s Trophée Chopard, and sat with Variety to speak with her career.\n\nRoberts admits that she feels that aspiring actors shouldn’t ask actors for advice. She says, “When people say, ‘What advice would you give to an actor?,’ I would say the first thing I would say to any actor is don’t take advice from actors. It would be the worst thing to do because we all have our unique experience.”\n\nSimilarly, Roberts points out that every “failed” audition for an actor might not really be a failure in the the long run, and she points at the “opportunities” she missed that may have hurt her career. She recalls, “I’m so deeply thankful for all the jobs that I didn’t get because I auditioned for a lot of really terrible commercials and not quality television. And so, I think it was a lot of good fortune that no one wanted me. I look back on it with real good feelings now.”\n\nRoberts also says that she doesn’t stay in character during filming, though she does admire actors who does. She says, “No way. Are you kidding? It is too much. You have to put the bag down… I mean, I admire people that do that. It looks exhausting to me and I secretly think: ‘Oh, I wish I could do that. I wish I could be that intense.’ I’m just kidding.”"
