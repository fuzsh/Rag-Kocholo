        "text": "The One After the Superbowl Part II\n\nRachel and Monica compete for the affections of Jean-Claude Van Damme after meeting him on a movie set. Chandler meets a former schoolmate, a makeup artist, who seems to have the hots for him. An excited Joey gets a role as an extra in the movie and Ross and Marcel go on a whirlwind tour of the city.\n\nHidden Kin\n\nHenry Louis Gates explores the remarkable roots of actors Edward Norton and Julia Robertsâusing DNA analysis and genealogical detective work to travel generations into the past, tracing lineages that run from Northern Europe to the American South. Along the way, Norton and Roberts reimagine their family stories and discover their hidden connections to our nationâs historyâand each other."
