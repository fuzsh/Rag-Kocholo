        "text": "The fan-favorite family/romance film Steel Magnolias celebrates its 35th anniversary this November. As the milestone moment approaches, we’re looking back on our favorite scenes from the film, as well as BTS press junket snippets. In doing so, we came across a resurfaced clip of Julia Roberts recounting one of her favorite takeaways from the filming process: a heart-to-heart with Dolly Parton herself.\n\nIn the clip (which was reposted to ), Julia is sitting cross-legged on a couch talking to Oprah Winfrey, recalling a time when the entire cast was sweating and complaining in the Louisiana heat. “Dolly never said anything,” Julia was quick to point out. “And I finally just had to say, ‘Dolly, I mean, you’ve got a wig, you’re doing the thing, and the wool… I mean, c’mon; it’s hot! ...Just say, ‘I’m hot,’ you know, ‘This is a drag.’”\n\nBut Dolly never did any of that.\n\n“I remember we were sitting on the porch—do you remember this?—we were sitting on the porch and she said to me, ‘When I was a little girl, I wanted to be famous and I wanted to be rich, and now I’m both those things; I’m not going to complain about it.’ And I thought, ‘Okay, I’m going to be quiet for the rest of the day.’”\n\nSimple as the encounter may seem, Julia admitted that it was a lesson that stuck with her. “Every time I go to complain or just kind of moan, I always hear Dolly sittin' on the porch and saying that, and it kind of like keeps you quiet.”\n\nIt’s a lesson on perspective that Dolly fans were quick to applaud in the comments section of the TikTok post. “Dolly is just in a class of her own, so classy and humble,” one fan wrote. “That’s a great lesson for all of us to remember,” another remarked. “I remember this interview and this exact conversation. It has always stuck with me. I may not be rich and famous but I’m very grateful for the life I have,” someone else commented.\n\nAs Dolly fans know, this is just one of many memorable Dollyisms. Do you have a favorite?"
