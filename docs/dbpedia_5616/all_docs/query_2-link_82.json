        "text": "Topline\n\nOne is a modern-day horror film and the other a classic 1990s rom-com, but two of Netflix's most-streamed movies of last week have one thing in common that has drawn viewers by the tens of millions: They star A-list actress Julia Roberts.\n\nKey Facts\n\nBig Number\n\n$178.4 million. That's how much \"Pretty Woman,\" which had a $14 million budget, has grossed domestically since its 1990 release. That's the equivalent of about $425.6 million in today's dollars, more than what \"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse” made to become 2023's third-highest grossing film ($381.3 million) but less than \"The Super Mario Bros. Movie,\" in second place for the year with a $574.9 million domestic draw.\n\nKey Background\n\nJulia Roberts played the leading role in a spate of ultra successful films through the early 2000s, including \"Pretty Woman,\" \"My Best Friend's Wedding,\" \"Erin Brockovich\" and \"Ocean's Eleven.\" She starred in the film adaptation of \"Eat Pray Love\" in 2010 and last took on a major drama in 2018, when she played a mother struggling to help her drug addicted son in \"Ben is Back.\" At the busiest point in her career, Roberts’ name was almost synonymous with box office success—dozens of her films have crossed the $100 million mark with her most commercially successful, \"Ocean's Eleven,\" grossing $450.7 million at the worldwide box office in 2001 (about $783.1 million today). Roberts was reportedly paid $25 million for her role in \"Leave the World Behind.\"\n\nTangent\n\nNetflix has often been responsible for a resurgence in popularity of older shows and movies. \"Avatar: The Last Airbender,\" originally released in 2005, enjoyed a pandemic resurgence on Netflix and shows like “The Office,” “Friends”—which plays prominently in “Leave the World Behind,” and where Roberts’ guest-starred—and “Schitt's Creek” enjoyed much streaming popularity years after their natural end. In some cases, the late popularity has led to remakes and spinoffs. \"Gilmore Girls,\" which first aired in 2000, caught fire after being added to Netflix in 2014 and the streamer created a four-part miniseries revival starring the original cast called \"Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life\" in 2016. The legal drama \"Suits,\" which ended in 2019, spent four months at the top of Nielsen's streaming charts after the show hit Netflix for the first time in July 2023 and the surge has NBCUniversal reportedly eyeing a new “Suits” series.\n\nCrucial Quote\n\n\"Sony right now is making a movie of Cobra Kai. Why do you think they're doing that? Because Cobra Kai was a monster on Netflix,\" Ted Sarandos, Netflix co-CEO, said last month. \"That was IP [intellectual property]\n\nthat had failed elsewhere.\"\n\nWhat To Watch For\n\nDisney will be sending a number of its older catalog shows to Netflix in the coming months, the New York Times reported, including “This Is Us,” “How I Met Your Mother,” “Prison Break,” “Home Improvement” and \"White Collar.\" ABC's \"Lost\" will also return to the streamer this year.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nForbes'Bluey' Becomes Most-Streamed Show, Ending 'Suits' Streak - Plus This Year's Other Most Popular TitlesForbesUncle Fester Could Get His Own Addams Family Show-Here Are The Spinoffs That Have (And Haven't) Hit It BigForbesWhat's Really The Most-Watched Netflix Show?
