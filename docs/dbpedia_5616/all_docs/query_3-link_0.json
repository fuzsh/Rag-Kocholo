        "text": "(Photo by Warner Bros. / courtesy Everett Collection)\n\nAll Julia Roberts Movies, Ranked by Tomatometer\n\nIt didn’t take long for Julia Roberts to become America’s de facto sweetheart – literally, she made a movie called America’s Sweethearts in 2001 – after starting out with Mystic Pizza and Steel Magnolias in the late-1980s. Those breakouts set the stage for Pretty Woman, the inescapable rom-com phenom that guaranteed all her movie choices for the rest on the ’90s would make headlines. These included thrillers like The Pelican Brief, Conspiracy Theory, and I Love Trouble; major directorial collaborations with the likes of Steven Spielberg (Hook) and Robert Altman (Ready to Wear); and more hits in the romantic-comedy space, with Notting Hill, My Best Friend’s Wedding, and Runaway Bride, which re-united Roberts with her Pretty Woman co-star Richard Gere.\n\nIn 2000, you could pinpoint a full pivot into drama with Erin Brockovich (which won Roberts the Best Actress Oscar), leading to Full Frontal, Confessions of a Dangerous Mind, Mona Lisa Smile, and Closer. Things got a little lighter over the past decade, as Roberts showed up for Eat Pray Love, and worked with Tom Hanks in his starring-and-directing vehicle Larry Crowne. (They had previously acted in Mike Nichols’ final film Charlie Wilson’s War.)\n\nThis career shift, mixed heavier material, has proven fruitful, as she’s had a string of Certified Fresh dramas including The Normal Heart, Wonder, and Ben is Back. Her latest Oscar nomination came through with 2016’s August: Osage Country, adapted by Tracy Letts from his Broadway play. And now we’re ranking all Julia Roberts movies by Tomatometer! —Alex Vo\n\n#1\n\nThe Normal Heart (2014) 94%\n\n#1\n\nAdjusted Score: 95517%\n\nCritics Consensus: Thanks to Emmy-worthy performances from a reputable cast, The Normal Heart is not only a powerful, heartbreaking drama, but also a vital document of events leading up to and through the early AIDS crisis.\n\nSynopsis: In 1980s New York, a writer (Mark Ruffalo) and his friends join forces to expose the truth about the emerging...
