Then you’re doing that, and you think, ‘Oh to be wearing a pretty dress and laughing.’ People sometimes misconstrue the amount of time that’s gone by that I haven’t done a romantic comedy as my not wanting to do one.”\n\nShe added: “If I had read something that I thought was that Notting Hill level of writing or My Best Friend’s Wedding level of madcap fun, I would do it. … I’m living my acting dreams.”\n\nThe Georgia native — who got her start acting in Mystic Pizza and Steel Magnolias — eventually went on to star in a string of successful romantic comedies, including Pretty Woman, Runaway Bride and Notting Hill.\n\n[sendtonews type=\"float\" key=\"oydUGntQlC-3114051-14453\"]\n\nHer starring turn as lawyer Erin Brockovich in the 2001 drama of the same name went on to win Roberts her first Oscar. “[I keep my trophy] in the parlor,” the Ocean’s 11 actress revealed during a December 2019 appearance on The Ellen DeGeneres Show. “It’s in a room that has a piano in it that my daughter [Hazel] plays, so we call it the piano room and I thought it might sound pretentious, so I said ‘parlor’ [instead].”\n\nWhile Roberts — who shares twins Hazel and Phinnaeus and younger son Henry with husband Danny Moder — loves performing, it’s the role of “mom” and “wife” that are her favorite positions.\n\n“When I’m not working, [being a homemaker] is my full-time job,” the Gaslit star during an October 2022 interview for CBS Sunday Morning. “It isn’t rainbows and kittens every day, but it does bring me a lot of joy.”\n\nShe continued at the time: “It’s just never consumed me, being an actor. It is my dream come true, but it is not my only dream come true. The life that I have built with my husband [and] the life that we’ve built with our children, that’s the best stuff.
