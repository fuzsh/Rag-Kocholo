        "text": "There’s No Going Back to Normal. -Tagline for the movie\n\nAmanda (Julia Roberts) and Clay (Ethan Hawke) Sandford leave the hustle of NYC (Brooklyn) for a quiet/ Long Island vacay w/ their 2 teen kids: 17 y.o. Archie (Charlie Evans- a 19 y.o. Aussie actor/musician) and 13 y.o. Rose (Farrah Mackenzie- now 19 y.o.) Their trip is interrupted by the arrival of a middle-aged man, G.H Scott (Mahershala Ali), and his 20-ish daughter, Ruth (Myaha’la), who own this luxury rental house. The Scotts (dressed to the nines for the Bronx Symphony) decided to leave the city when a blackout occurred. When the internet, TV, and radio stop working, as well as the landline, there is no way of finding out what is exactly happening! Loud sonic booms shatter the peace, animals start to migrate to weird places, and the physical/mental health of both families begins to disintegrate. As the renters are white and the owners are Black, issues of race clash and become distractions to the more disturbing events happening around them.\n\nAmanda: Well, when I couldn’t fall back asleep this morning, I came over here. To watch the sunrise. And I saw all these people starting their day with such tenacity. Such verve. All in an effort to… make something of themselves. Make something of our world. I felt so lucky to be a part of that. But then, I remembered… what the world is actually like. And I came to a more accurate realization. I f*****g hate people.\n\nMy parents really valued assimilation. They were leaving a political system that had failed, and there was no desire on the part of either of my parents to look back with any rose-colored perspective. We were there to be American. They were extremely clear about that. I was raised like any other white kid in any other nice house in any other fancy American suburb. -Rumaan Alam (author of the source novel Leave the World Behind) in Vulture: September 15, 2020.\n\nWith Amanda, we get to dissect white entitlement, and I thought, What a fascinating challenge for America’s sweetheart [Julia Roberts] to examine that privilege. -Sam Esmail (director/screenwriter) in Vulture: September 15, 2020.\n\nYup, you heard right- former prez Barack Obama and his wife, Michelle, are producers on this movie! Netflix won a bidding war for the rights to the novel by Rumaan Alam (a queer/Bangladeshi-American writer) in July 2020. Alam and his husband (photographer David Land) are raising two Black sons in Brooklyn; he has written re: adoptive fatherhood in NYT. Sam Esmail (best known for Mr. Robot) was attached to write/direct the movie; he is Egyptian-American. This is the 3rd collab btwn. Esmail and Roberts after Gaslit (2022) and S1 of Homecoming (2018). Leave the World Behind had its world premiere at the AFI Fest on October 25, 2023. It was released (select theaters) on November 22nd, then hit Netflix on December 8th.\n\nG. H. Scott: A conspiracy theory about a shadowy group of people running the world is far too lazy of an explanation… especially when the truth is much scarier.\n\nAmanda: What is the truth?\n\nG. H. Scott: No one is in control. No one is pulling the strings.\n\nThe central Q posed here: What has modern life made of us? We are focused on tech and ourselves, so perhaps are losing what makes us human. There is plenty of meta commentary in this movie; for EX: Roberts’ character’s daughter, Rose, is obsessed w/ Friends (1994). The girl becomes V anxious when unable to stream the series finale. Many viewers (esp. near by age) will recall that Roberts was a guest star in one ep of the hit comedy series; she also dated Matthew Perry. Rose doesn’t get much empathy from Archie, who is the typical down-beat/self-concerned boy. Some viewers commented on his resemblance to a young Adam Driver: tall, pale, slim, w/ long-ish dark hair. I had somewhat high hopes for this movie, as the cast is good and the premise is intriguing. Several viewers noted that Hawke is playing a version of himself, which I felt also. This movie is TOO long (2 hrs. 18 mins) and lacks pacing (momentum); there are a few scenes w/ good tension.\n\n[1] I think the movie was timely. COVID accelerated our isolation with everyone living in their own realities of happiness. I recommend watching this movie and thinking about how our world is rapidly changing. How many of us would be perfectly happy living in our bunkers of our own making with our own devices watching our own shows not needing to pay attention to the outside world? The movie takes it to the extreme with bombs dropping right outside, but I thought the point was powerful.\n\n[2] It’s supposed to be a deep, political exploration of what would happen to the average citizen if America were to be destabilized. And the answer is: they’d sit around and wander around and generally mope around. That’s very boring. Nothing about this movie hits. Nothing about this movie hits any of the right notes. I want my time back!\n\n[3] And if 2023 has shown us anything, it’s revealed to more and more people that maybe we’re just cogs turning in a vast machine that we can’t possibly understand. There are forces shaping the world that are bigger than our individual capacities, and maybe too complex for us to collectively confront. We lack a common cause. Because we often can’t even agree on what the problem is. And where we can and do see problems we only see the surface problems. We band-aid things, and we swat flies. But we’re not building the solutions that we need to build a better future.\n\n-Excerpts from IMDb reviews"
