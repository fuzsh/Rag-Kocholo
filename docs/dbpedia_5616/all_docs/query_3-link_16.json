        "text": "Highest Rated: 94% The Normal Heart (2014)\n\nLowest Rated: 8% Mother's Day (2016)\n\nBirthday: Oct 28, 1967\n\nBirthplace: Smyrna, Georgia, USA\n\nOne of the few bankable female stars of the 1990s and 2000s, actress Julia Roberts remained an iconic figure whose assured, winsome performances underscored her undeniable public appeal. Following a breakthrough role in \"Mystic Pizza\" (1988), Roberts earned critical acclaim and award recognition for her portrayal of the ill-fated Shelby in \"Steel Magnolias\" (1989). But it was her performance as a hooker with a heart of gold opposite Richard Gere in \"Pretty Woman\" (1990) that propelled Roberts into the upper tier of Hollywood actresses. Roberts quickly became one of the highest paid stars - male or female - in the world, eventually raking in $25 million for a film. Equally in the limelight for a torrent of high-profile and often rocky romances, Roberts managed to maintain an output of projects that consistently topped the box office. While sometimes accused of lacking the chops to be a serious actress, she erased all doubts with her Oscar-winning performance in \"Erin Brockovich\" (2001), as well as other acclaimed roles in \"Eat Pray Love\" (2010), \"August: Osage County\" (2013) and \"Ben Is Back\" (2018), all of which underscored Roberts' unique ability to be both a huge box office draw and an accomplished performer.\n\nHighest rated movies\n\n94% The Normal Heart\n\n86% Wonder\n\n85% Erin Brockovich\n\n84% Notting Hill 83% Ocean's Eleven 82% Charlie Wilson's War 81% Ben Is Back\n\n80% Confessions of a Dangerous Mind\n\nPhotos\n\nJulia Roberts Meryl Streep, Julia Roberts at arrivals for 19th Annual Critics'' Choice Movie Awards, The Barker Hangar, Santa Monica, CA January 16, 2014.
