        "text": "Ant Bully, The\n\nThe Ant Bully is a sore disappointment to anyone hoping for a turnaround to the recent downward quality spiral of animated films. In fact, this movie may represent a new nadir for 3D animation. Although it's pretty enough to look at (although now...\n\nAugust: Osage County\n\nAugust: Osage County is all about the acting. That makes sense because the storyline doesn't offer much that could be considered new or remarkable. It's as big a downer as the pills popped by matriarch Violet Weston (Meryl Streep) but the quality ...\n\nBen Is Back\n\nBen is Back is one-half of an awards-worthy exploration of the impacts of addiction on the victim and his family and one-half of a muddled quasi-thriller that undercuts the power of the rest of the movie. This review will contain some limited ...\n\nCharlie Wilson's War\n\nIt's a curious thing. Whenever this much talent is assembled for a motion picture, the result inevitably seems to be a letdown. And to say that Charlie Wilson's War is topheavy with talent is to understate the matter. The cast features three Osc...\n\nCloser\n\nIf you pay attention to Hollywood's romantic comedies, the interaction between men and women is all about love and companionship. If you instead rely upon the philosophy of Closer, it's all about power. Closer starts like a nice romantic drama, w...\n\nDuplicity\n\nWhen it comes to spy thrillers, Tony Gilroy knows the game. The formula for a crackling entry into this genre is simple enough: keep the action moving and the twists coming, then engage in one late innings sleight of hand that pulls the rug out fr...\n\nEat Pray Love\n\nEat Pray Love is a muddle of a film - an overlong bore that either mistakenly thinks it's something more than a humdrum romance or has incorporated a variety of pretentions as window-dressing. In either case, the movie's quasi-preachy attitude eff...\n\nErin Brockovich\n\nThe cinematic landscape of early 2000 is littered with the carcasses of disappointing dinosaurs presented by respected, or at least recognizable, filmmakers: John Frankenheimer and ...\n\nEveryone Says I Love You\n\nIn the past decade, only two live-action, mainstream musical motion pictures have been released. While the first, Little Shop of Horrors, met with some success, the second, Newsies, was a box-office disaster. The poor performance of the Disney-ba...\n\nLarry Crowne\n\nA dozen years ago, the prospect of a romantic comedy starring Tom Hanks and Julia Roberts - two of the most bankable actors of the late-'90s and early-'00s - would have created waves of anticipation.
