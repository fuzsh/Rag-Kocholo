        "text": "In “Secret in Their Eyes,” we see Julia Roberts as we never have before.\n\nOne of the few actresses who could genuinely lay claim to the title America’s Sweetheart for her run of hits like “Pretty Woman,” “Flatliners,” “My Best Friend’s Wedding,” “Notting Hill,” “Erin Brockovich,” “Ocean’s Eleven” and, um, “America’s Sweethearts,” Roberts is all about devastation with this one. Emotional, to some degree physical, and by the end, spiritual devastation.\n\nIt’s not a pretty thing to see the actress with the megawatt smile do. It is, however, a terrific performance to watch.\n\n“It’s so funny: Be careful what you ask for,” Roberts, 48, shrugs. “It’s like, ‘I want a really interesting, complicated (role), y’know?’ And then you get there and it’s like, ‘Why is everybody looking at me?’ ”\n\nBoth Juan Jose Campanella’s 2009 Argentine murder mystery movie “The Secret in Their Eyes” and the new film directed and adapted by Billy Ray are based on an Eduardo Sacheri novel. But Ray, whose screenplays range from the realistic “Captain Phillips” to the not very “Hunger Games,” really changed the story by moving it from Buenos Aires to his hometown of Los Angeles and altering the political backdrop to the case from the Argentine military junta’s Dirty War against its citizens to U.S. anti-terrorism efforts in the wake of the 9/11 attacks.\n\nToggling between 2002 and today, the new movie centers on a team of U.S. anti-terror investigators, primarily Roberts’ Jess, her partner and dear friend Ray played by Chiwetel Ejiofor and Deputy D.A. Claire (Nicole Kidman). When the body of Jess’ teenage daughter Caroline (Zoe Graham) is found in a dumpster next door to a mosque, single mom Jess is understandably destroyed while Ray spearheads a sometimes extra-legal, ultimately unsuccessful effort to nail the killer.\n\nThirteen years later, long after heartbroken Ray has left the L.A. unit, he returns to Jess and Claire with what he’s certain is a solid lead on the murderer. The new investigation starts heading south much like the first one, however, as clues to a totally different outcome mount.\n\n“The biggest part of my preparation was figuring out what she looked like in the beginning and what she looked like 13 years later, and then sort of constructing the performance around that in a way,” Roberts says of Jess, who wears little to no makeup and some really bad hair. “It was a unique approach. I don’t think I’ve ever tried to craft a character like this, and tried, as I did, making a commitment in the beginning that my personal thoughts had no intersection with Jess’ personal thoughts. Normally, actors say ‘Oh, my kitten died when I was 12 in my arms and I cried all night.’ No. It was all Jess, all the time. Everything that she was going through was never a thought outside of what was her planet.”\n\nJess is a combination of two male characters in both the Argentine film. When Roberts expressed interest in the project, Ray changed the gender for her, as happened recently with Sandra Bullock for “Our Brand Is Crisis.” Roberts says that the only major alteration she requested for the character was that her murdered loved one be changed from Jess’ wife to her daughter.\n\n“The note that I had been sent with the script was that it would be a woman who loses her wife,” Roberts reports. “I thought, ‘Well, that’s really cool and 21st century and I’m down with that. But about halfway through the script, I felt that if you’re going to really need people to be openly invested in the truth as Jess reveals it, she has to somehow have a story that everybody has a part in. So I said to Billy, if she’s a woman and loses her child, we all have one or have been one, so everybody is there or connected to her grief.”\n\nThat grief is most harrowingly demonstrated when first Ray, then Jess, discover the identity of the body in the dumpster. We have never seen Roberts in such extreme agony, and she admits it was a tough scene to play. Helping matters, though, was the fact that her husband, Daniel Moder, with whom she has three children, was the film’s cinematographer.\n\n“I mean, it was amazing,” she says of having Moder on the set. “It’s so great. He’s my favorite person on the planet, so I love spending time with him and I love his work ethic and his point of view is really valuable to me. Also, when you feel like you do have scenes when you’re sort of really exposing yourself, (with him around) I felt some sense of that security. It just makes you want to do more.”\n\nThere was a real world reason to have as much moral support on the set as she could, too. Roberts’ mother, actress and acting coach Betty Lou Bredemus, died in February while “Secret” was in production.\n\n“There were days when she would shoot, go to the hospital and see her mother, then come back and shoot more,” Ray says of Roberts. “If we had been making a romantic comedy, I think we would have had a problem. Aside from her other virtues and her magnificent ability, she also is very brave and was willing to go into that feeling and make it a part of the fabric of the movie.”\n\nRoberts will be seen next in the Jodie Foster-directed hostage thriller “Money Monster” with her “Ocean’s” movies cohort George Clooney and in “Pretty Woman” director Garry Marshall’s self-explanatory “Mother’s Day.” Asked if they were more fun to do than “Secret in Their Eyes,” the old sharp-humored Julia we know and love answered.\n\n“Well, I mean, anything would be,” she says. “Getting your legs waxed would be fun and frothy compared to this.”"
