        "text": "The One Where Rachel Goes Back to Work\n\nWhen Rachel visits her workplace to show off baby Emma, she is surprised to find a handsome temporary worker, Gavin (Dermot Mulroney- \"About Schmidt\"), who has been doing her job while she was on maternity leave. Their immediate war of wills prompts Rachel to make a rash decision that she could regret. Meanwhile, Joey arranges for Phoebe to get a job as an extra on his daytime drama series, but she wreaks havoc on the set. And, having quit his job, Chandler must get another--fast--because Monica desperately wants a family.\n\nThe One Where Monica Sings\n\nWhile Rachel sorts out her conflicted feelings for her handsome co-worker Gavin (recurring guest star Dermot Mulroney), Ross recruits Chandler to help him meet attractive women in order to make Rachel jealous. Meanwhile, Phoebe regrets bringing Monica to karaoke night when Monica takes the microphone and delights in the applause--unaware that the guys in the audience are cheering because they can see through her dress. And Joey submits to painful eyebrow waxing before a photography session. Recurring guest star Melissa George appears as Molly.\n\nFancyman II\n\nJessâ sophisticated date with Russell (guest star Dermot Mulroney) doesnât go as planned. Meanwhile, Nickâs college friend visits and brings out Nickâs inner frat boy to help him get over his break-up with Julia. Also, Winston panics when Shelby goes on a âgirlsâ vacation and Schmidt and Cece try to keep their relationship under the covers, but one of the friends finds out their secret."
