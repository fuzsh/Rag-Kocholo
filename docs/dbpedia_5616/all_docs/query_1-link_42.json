        "text": "THE NINETIES WAS the decade that pop-culture truly took off. We had an inconceivable amount of sitcoms (Friends reign supreme), the daytime talk show reached its prime and romantic comedies were a Hollywood goldmine. The biggest romcom selling point? Julia Roberts. There was no one more lucrative or loved as a leading lady than the actress with the megawatt smile.\n\nFollowing her breakout role in the 1988 teen film Mystic Pizza, Roberts became one to watch. Shortly after, the Georgia-native was nominated for a Best Supporting Actress Oscar for her work in Steel Magnolias opposite industry veterans, Sally Field and Shirley MacClaine. But it wasn’t until Roberts was cast in Gary Marshall’s Pretty Woman in 1990 alongside Richard Gere, that she became Hollywood’s next obsession. At just 22 years old, Roberts was catapulted into fame — becoming as tabloid-worthy and powerful as her future role in Notting Hill.\n\nThroughout her now 35-year career, Roberts’ has been nominated for an Oscar four times — including for Pretty Woman — but it was the more serious 2001 drama Erin Brockovich which finally scored her a golden statuette. While her career has considerably slowed down since becoming a mother in the mid aughts, Roberts still shines when she does take on a new project — be it a drama, biopic or yes, a classic romcom.\n\nWith her new Australian-shot romantic comedy featuring longtime friend George Clooney Lost in Paradise hitting cinemas on September 15 — BAZAAR rounds up 9 of Roberts’ best ever films.\n\nBest Julia Roberts Films of All Time"
