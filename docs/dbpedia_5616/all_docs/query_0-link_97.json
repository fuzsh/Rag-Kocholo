I mean, I have the first letter he ever wrote me. ... And one day, I'll show it to Hazel and say, 'That's what you're looking for.'\"\n\nTo watch a trailer for \"Ticket to Paradise\" click on the video player below:\n\nThe Emmy Award-winning \"Sunday Morning\" is broadcast on CBS Sundays beginning at 9 a.m. ET. \"Sunday Morning\" also streams on the CBS News app [beginning at 10:30 a.m. ET] and on Paramount+, and is available on cbs.com and cbsnews.com.\n\nBe sure to follow us at cbssundaymorning.com, and on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and TikTok.\n\nFor more info:"
