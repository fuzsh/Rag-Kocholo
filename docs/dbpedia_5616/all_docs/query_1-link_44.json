        "text": "Julia Roberts is one of the biggest movie stars of all time, so it's no surprise that some of her movies are on Netflix at any given time. Right now, Roberts is closely associated with the company because she stars in the Netflix original film Leave the World Behind, released last week. However, there are three other movies starring Roberts on Netflix at the time of this writing.\n\nRoberts has 67 credits as an actress on IMDb, and more on the way. The 56-year-old actress has candidly said that she has slowed down in her work in order to spend more time with her children, but she has not stopped completely. Meanwhile, her legendary work includes movies that are highly sought after by streamers, and Netflix has several of them right now. Read on for a look at each of the movies she has on Netflix.\n\nRunaway Bride\n\nThe third movie is a rom-com too – the 1999 film Runaway Bride. In it, Roberts plays a woman who has run away from three previous weddings at the last moment, and is now engaged to be married once again. However, leaving all those men at the altar has given her some notoriety and a magazine writer – played by Richard Gere – has come to write a story about her. Her spark of interest in him threatens to derail yet another wedding at the last moment.\n\nLeave the World Behind\n\nFinally, Roberts' most recent movie is the Netflix original film Leave the World Behind. Based on a novel by the same name written by Rumaan Alam, it is an apocalyptic psychological thriller written and directed by Sam Esmail. Roberts plays a misanthropic suburban mom who decides to take her family on a beach vacation on a whim. While there, they experience more and more surreal phenomena indicating that they may be under attack, and that they are intentionally being kept in the dark. The movie also stars Mahershala Ali, Ethan Hawke, Myha'la, Farrah Mackenzie, Charlie Evans and Kevin Bacon. It premiered last week and is streaming now on Netflix."
