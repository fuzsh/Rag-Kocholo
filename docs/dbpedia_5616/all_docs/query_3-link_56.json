        "text": "Netflix’s new thriller “Leave the World Behind” delivers with a stellar cast and arthouse direction. The film dropped on the streaming platform days ago. It was written, directed and produced by Sam Esmail. The story is based off the 2020 novel of the same name by Rumaan Alam.\n\nI was hooked on the teaser image. A thriller starring Julia Roberts and Ethan Hawke – one of my all-time favorite actors. That Netflix has gone from cheesy feel-good films to landing names like these is a testament to the influence and staying power the company has. Twenty years ago, it changed the way we rented movies. Now, it’s changing the way movies are made. Much to the chagrin of Martin Scorsese.\n\nBig Names\n\nStars aside, I was captivated by the filming style of Sam Esmail. I saw homages to classic, and recent horror films scattered throughout. I won’t spoil them – horror junkies will have fun finding them on their own. Esmail includes beautiful framing techniques and off-putting angles; some subtle, some not, to move the story in a cinematic way. I’m unfamiliar with Esmail’s prior work and am now eager to see what else he has to offer.\n\nThe plot includes standard elements for a thriller and is both pertinent and relevant in today’s world. I knew nothing from the still image I saw, and I suggest (as always) skipping the trailer and diving right in. I can offer the briefest synopsis.\n\nAmanda and Clay Sandford (Julia Roberts and Ethan Hawke) are spending a weekend at a quaint beach community away from the stresses of New York City. They are with their two children (played by Farrah Mackenzie and Charlie Evans). The Sandford family encounters a father (Mahershala Ali) and daughter (Myha’la) who may or may not have devious intentions. Oh, and Kevin Bacon plays a gruff survivalist.\n\nNow Go Watch!\n\n“Leave the World Behind” covers prejudices, fear of outsiders, reliance on technology – all done in a way that won’t force agendas and never openly tells you who or what is right or wrong. The characters rely on a modern world of smart phones and satellites. Any break in that, and the appropriate chaos will ensue.\n\nEthan Hawke was my favorite character. No surprises there. Hawke can master any role given and excels as being a standard everyman. He’s not a superhero or martial artists – and isn’t afraid to openly admit it. As Clay Sandford, Hawke plays a typical husband and father who isn’t looking for confrontation and tries to see the best, no matter the situation.\n\nJulia Roberts does a capable job as Amanda Sandford, a woman with a bit more nuance. Amanda is a misanthrope who doesn’t trust anyone that she doesn’t know. Her interactions with the characters played by Mahershala Ali and Myha’la are some of the best moments in the story. Mahershala Ali will also leave you bedazzled. Is he good? Is he evil? Who’s to say.\n\nDon’t Let the Run-time Deter You\n\nThe 141-minute run-time was a bit scary. But the chilling scenes early on border on horror and hit with excellence. One of my favorite parts depicts each of the characters on their own reacting to their current, impossible situation.\n\nThe score, handled by Mac Quayle, is a perfect accompaniment to the building tensions. The pacing is superb, and you, like the characters, won’t be reaching for your phone.\n\n“Leave the World Behind” is one of the best new releases I have watched in some time. The run-time shouldn’t deter you. Once you settle down, you won’t look away. I for sure will be watching again.\n\n“Leave the World Behind” is only available on Netflix."
