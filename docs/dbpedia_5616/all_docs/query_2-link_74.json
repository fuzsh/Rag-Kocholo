        "text": "Actress Julia Roberts and cinematographer Danny Moder have been together for over two decades after meeting on the set of The Mexican in 2000. The couple went on to have three children and make a number of films together.\n\nHere’s the famous and long-loving couple’s full relationship history.\n\n2000\n\nIn early 200o, the pair met when Roberts was starring in The Mexican, and Moder was working as a cameraman. The cinematographer was married to celebrity makeup artist Vera Steimberg, and Roberts was dating Benjamin Bratt. Her four-year relationship with Bratt ended in June 2001, and Moder and his wife also split, finalizing their divorce in 2002.\n\n“He sorted his whole thing out, separate and apart from me,” the actress told Oprah. “And I sorted my life out, separate and apart from him. I think that’s the only reason we were able to ultimately fall in love with each other and be together.”\n\nJuly 2002\n\nThe couple were married on July 4, 2002, on Roberts’ ranch in Taos, New Mexico, among a small group of family and friends who were surprised they weren’t just at a regular Fourth of July party.\n\nMay 2004\n\nThe pair confirmed they were expecting in a statement to People in 2004. The couple had twins. Roberts later described how she headed to Italy while pregnant for her role in Ocean’s 12.\n\n“I was pregnant for the first time, and you would have thought I was made of glass,” she said on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert. “They just wanted to dress me in cotton balls and usher me. It was really, really charming.”\n\nNovember 2004\n\nThe twins were born on Nov. 28, 2004. The fraternal pair were named Phinnaeus and Hazel.\n\n“Hazel is an old-fashioned name, and she’s a strong, perfect Hazel,” Roberts said on The Late Show with David Letterman.\n\nDecember 2006\n\nIt was confirmed in late 2006 that Roberts was expecting again.\n\nJune 2007\n\nOn June 18, 2007, Roberts and Moder welcomed another son named Henry Daniel.\n\nAugust 2014\n\nModer gushed about his wife to The Hollywood Reporter after she received an Emmy nomination for her role in The Normal Heart as Dr. Emma Brookner. Moder also worked on the film.\n\n“It was a challenging role,” he said. “It wasn’t a sexy role, but, wow, what she brought to it, I was really impressed.”\n\nThe Normal Heart won for outstanding television movie at the Emmys, and Moder celebrated by sharing his first photo of Roberts and himself on Instagram. The image is of their silhouette across the award show’s red carpet.\n\nNovember 2015\n\nRoberts talked with People about working with Moder on the set of Secret in Her Eyes.\n\n“It was amazing. It was so great. He’s my favorite person on the planet, so I love spending time with him, and I love his work ethic,” she said. “His point of view is really valuable to me.”\n\nMay 2016\n\nModer shared a picture of Roberts getting ready for her first appearance at the Cannes Film Festival for the screening of her movie The Money Monster. He jokingly called it the “glam countdown.”\n\nApril 2017\n\nDuring her interview for her fifth win as People's Most Beautiful Woman in April 2017, she talked about still being infatuated with her husband after so many years together.\n\n“I mean, every day my husband walks in the door, it’s like a recurring dream,” she said. “I’m like, ‘Ah, he’s back!’”\n\nJuly 2017\n\nModer celebrated their 15-year wedding anniversary on Instagram.\n\n“this pretty lady and I have been following each other around for awhile,” he wrote in the caption. “married 15 years today..And look how green our garden still is!!! love you.”\n\nSeptember 2018\n\nRoberts shared a photo of her and Moder embracing on the beach in an ode to summer.\n\n“Oh, Summer, thank you! You made us happy and brave,” she wrote. “We embraced every moment of sun drenched JOY ☀️ #familytime.”\n\nOctober 2018\n\nIn 2018, Roberts spoke with Oprah for Harper’s Bazaar and discussed negative gossip about her marriage.\n\n“Sometimes we are in the grocery store, and I won’t even know something is out, but we’ll see a tabloid, and we’ll all be standing there like, ‘Oh, that's uncomfortable. This is really uncomfortable,’” she explained. “It can still hurt my feelings because I’m so proud of my marriage. We just celebrated being married for 16 years this Fourth of July, and there's so much happiness wrapped up in what we’ve found together.”\n\nShe also shared a bit about how her kids deal with fame.\n\n“I don’t think they will ever have a true sense of [my fame],” she said. “I think I told you once when they were starting to figure it out, it was like, ‘You’re famous?’ And I said, ‘I think a lot of people might have seen the movie that I’m in or might know who I am.’”\n\nNovember 2018\n\nOn the , Roberts talked about how meeting Moder completely transformed her life.\n\n“Getting married to Danny. That was the first, like, my life will never be the same in the most incredible, indescribable way,” she said. “The best decision I ever made in my entire life was to hitch my wagon to Danny Moder.”\n\nJuly 2019\n\nFor their 17-year anniversary, Roberts shared a photo of herself wearing a T-shirt with a photo of Moder riding a bicycle printed across it.\n\nShe captioned the pic, “💖17 Years💖 #TheWheelieKingsWife💫.”\n\nJuly 2021\n\nBoth of them shared pics for their 19-year anniversary. Roberts shared a photo of them on the beach, writing, “19 years. Just getting started!”\n\nModer shared a throwback pic from when they had just started dating, writing, “Today we start our 20th year of marriage. This photo was on a dusty road before that big idea … just holding onto this beautiful girl one day at a time. One epic day at a time.”\n\nFebruary 2022\n\nRoberts shared a sweet photo of them kissing for Valentine’s Day.\n\nApril 2022\n\nOn E!’s Daily Pop, Roberts shared a bit about how she and Moder approach parenting their kids.\n\n“I think it’s our personal responsibility to advocate for ourselves,” the actress explained. “I think that my husband and I both are people of strong convictions and opinions and compassions, and I think that we try to instill that in our kids as much by example as by preaching.”\n\nJuly 2022\n\nFor their big 20th wedding anniversary, Roberts shared another kissing photo.\n\n“⭐️TWENTY⭐️ #can'tstopsmiling😊 #can'tstopkissing😘,” she captioned the post.\n\nOctober 2022\n\nOn CBS Sunday Morning, Roberts talked about writing letters back and forth with her husband.\n\n“The first letter he ever wrote me, which was seven pages long, I still have it tucked away. One day I’ll show it to Hazel and say, ‘That’s what you’re looking for,’” the actress said.\n\nShe continued, “The life that I’ve built with my husband. The life that we’ve built with our children. And that’s the best stuff, to come home at the end of the day triumphantly to them.”\n\nDecember 2022\n\nThe couple attended the Kennedy Center Honors, which was honoring their close friend George Clooney.\n\nJuly 2023\n\nRoberts shared another kissing photo for their 21st year.\n\nDecember 2023\n\nOn the Today show, Roberts shared how important Moder was within her family.\n\n“It all starts with Danny Moder,” she said. “He is our person and, in the most beautiful way, the captain of our ship.”\n\nShe also shared a bit about her kids and parenting.\n\n“I have an immense amount of appreciation for both of my older kids because they still allow me to be the same mom to them, and it’s not eye-rolling. There’s a huge amount of understanding,” she said. “I parent them the same way out of the house that I parent them in the house. Which is, ‘Are you getting enough sleep? You sound like you’re sick, are you drinking tea?’ And, ‘Text me when you get home so I can see that you’re safe and sound.’”\n\nJuly 2024\n\nThe couple enjoyed Wimbledon in London."
