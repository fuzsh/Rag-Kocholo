This chapter explores Roman Polanski's early films, such as Murder (1957), The Lamp (1958), When Angels Fall (1959), among others, in relation to the aesthetics of Surrealism. "With a mood and aesthetic reminiscent of Buñuel's Los Olvidados (1950), Polanski's most famous short film, Two Men and a Wardrobe (1958) goes a step further in his portrayal of inhumanity.'
