Its new title, Polish Cinema: A History emphasizes that this is a revised and enlarged chronological account of the development of Polish cinema from 1896 to 2017.1 Since 2002, more than five hundred new films have been released alongside dozens of old films, once considered lost, that have reemerged from archives. In addition, several significant studies have been published (in Polish as well as in English) on various aspects of the Polish film industry. The present book deals not only with films themselves but also with their characteristic features and elements, recognized locally and internationally as distinctively Polish—what one might call a recognizable “national accent.” The focus is on full-length narrative films, although the book occasionally offers commentary on major Polish television films, documentaries, and animated films. Polish cinema has made considerable progress in recent years and, arguably, has become better known outside of Poland. This publication follows the largest presentation of Polish films outside of Poland: the touring twenty-one-film retrospective “Martin Scorsese Presents: Masterpieces of Polish Cinema,” which premiered at the Film Society of Lincoln Center in New York on 5 February 2014. It also follows Polish cinema’s first Oscar in 2015, the Best Foreign Language Film category for Ida (Poland-Denmark) directed by Paweł Pawlikowski. Throughout its history, the Polish film industry has been able to produce a diverse corpus of work. Several representatives of Polish cinema have enjoyed international fame; some are even generally regarded as masters of cinema. Almost every film history textbook contains a chapter discussing the emergence and importance of the Polish School phenomenon. The names of Poland’s bestknown directors, such as Andrzej Wajda, Roman Polański, and Krzysztof Kieślowski, are mentioned among the world’s most important filmmakers. In many books, the Łódź Film School serves as a model for successful film education.\n\n2 . POLISH CINEMA\n\n*** Any writer dealing with the development of Polish cinema must take into account the complexity of Poland’s history. Changing political situations typically defined the development of local cinema. Polish films thus reflect the history of a land in which national insurrections resulted in military defeat, a presence of occupying forces, and the suppression of Polish culture. It is feasible to distinguish films made in the Polish territories during the absence of the Polish state (before 1918), the cinema of interwar Poland (1918–1939), the cinema of communist Poland (1945–1989), and the films made after the return of democracy in 1989. It is also necessary to take into account Poland’s borders, which have changed throughout history. After the three partitions (in 1772, 1793, and 1795), Poland was wiped off the map in 1795 and divided among its three powerful neighbors— Russia, Austria, and Prussia—until the end of World War I. The partitions of Poland, including the one in 1939 between Soviet Russia and Nazi Germany, defined the character of Polish nationalism: its pro-Catholic stance and antiauthoritarianism, and its largely romantic vision of history. Because of this “burden of history,” Polish cinema and other arts often had to perform specific political, cultural, and social duties. Without a state, without an official language, the partitioned Polish territories were unified by the Roman Catholic religion, a common heritage and culture, as well as a spoken language. Before 1918, Polish territories were on the peripheries of the three European superpowers. Their economy remained poor and underdeveloped; its population had a high illiteracy rate, especially in the biggest Russian-controlled sector.2 Consequently, it was not the press but the cinema that performed an educational role for a number of people because this art form spoke to the literate and the illiterate. Polish history provided an abundance of themes for the screen, and local audiences always seemed to prefer films narrating local history and referring to local culture. As a result, a large number of Polish filmmakers were preoccupied with local issues that were, sometimes, difficult for outsiders to comprehend. In addition, during the communist period, Polish films were often seen in the West as works depicting the “political other.” Politically minded Western critics, as well as Polish critics, often overlooked their value as works of art. Given this uneasy background, before the return of democracy in 1989, Polish filmmakers were often expected to perform various educational and nation-\n\nINTRODUCTION . 3\n\nbuilding duties. While they also produced entertainment films, the filmmakers saw themselves primarily as guardians of national culture and propagators of the national literary canon. During Poland’s communist period, local filmmakers were perfectly aware of their role within the nationalized film industry as educators, entertainers, social activists, and political leaders. Filmmakers were at the foreground of Polish life, accustomed to a situation in which their voices and their works were carefully watched by both authorities and general Polish audiences. The transition to democracy altered the relationship between filmmakers and their audiences. In the late 1990s, Polish filmmakers began winning back their audiences with popular adaptations of the national literary canon. The foundation of the Polish Film Institute (PISF) in 2005 continued this work by stimulating the film production and increasing popularity of Polish cinema in Poland, as well as abroad. To write about Polish cinema before 1939, in particular, is a difficult task because little is known about Polish films produced in the early twentieth century. In fact, most early Polish films have been lost. A number of films and documents related to film production before World War II in Poland were destroyed, especially during the Warsaw Uprising of 1944. Because of the absence of several primary sources (films), a researcher must reconstruct the picture of Polish cinema before 1939 through miraculously preserved artifacts—fragments of films, articles, reviews, still photographs, film posters—most of which are archived at the Polish Filmoteka Narodowa (National Film Archives) in Warsaw. An expert on early Polish cinema, Małgorzata Hendrykowska, stressed this arduous investigative task by titling her book on the origins of cinema in Poland Śladami tamtych cieni (Following Those Shadows).3 Before the fall of communism in 1989, little had been written about early Polish cinema. The communist authorities preferred to promote the picture of prewar “bourgeois Poland” as a land of commercial cinema and disrespect for art films. They also did not want to mention several prewar films that were anti-Russian and anti-Soviet; these films were neither released nor discussed in the People’s Republic of Poland. One faces similar difficulties when dealing with the communist period. Polish sources published before 1989 often suffer from restrictions that had been imposed by the oppressive communist ideology. Frequently, they testify more about the nature of “cultural politics” in Poland than about the aesthetic or political impact of these films or their true popularity. Polish cinema familiarized local and international audiences with its unique political context. This context and the relationship between film and politics in\n\n4 . POLISH CINEMA\n\nPoland had been so self-evident that they frequently served as a preconceived methodological approach. In film criticism, Polish cinema often existed mostly as an expression of Polish history and of political and social tensions, and rarely as a discipline in its own right. The distinguished Polish filmmaker Kazimierz Kutz wrote bitterly in 1996: “Polish cinema in years past, propelled by anticommunism of the West, benefited from the permanent discrediting, because the theme had been always more important than the style. It never had to compete intellectually; we were allowed to enter salons in dirty boots to describe communism, which the public wished a quick death.”4 For Western viewers, Polish film frequently served as an introduction to communist politics, to the nature of the totalitarian state, to censorship and its repercussions—an Aesopian reading. Nowadays, more and more critics and audiences, not tainted by perspective of the previous system, see films as films, not as political statements playing some role in the demolition of the communist system. By perceiving films merely as political tools, willingly or not, some critics, including me, often situated them among other remnants of the past. Milan Kundera’s comment is appropriate in this respect: “If you cannot view the art that comes to you from Prague, Budapest, or Warsaw in any other way than by means of this wretched political code, you murder it, no less brutally than the worst of the Stalinist dogmatists. And you are quite unable to hear its true voice.”5 *** Randall Halle in his book The Europeanization of Cinema stresses several of the problems film historians face while debating the early stages of cinema, chiefly the difficulty of distinguishing the difference of the national and the international (film as an international medium and a national product).6 Halle is right that film historians, including me in Polish National Cinema, often tend “to nationalize this prenational cinema.”7 Because of the lack of a Polish state, the Polish territories becoming peripheries of the partitioning superpowers, and the extraterritorial and international nature of early cinema, several Polish filmmakers moved to neighboring state capitals (Moscow, Berlin, and Vienna) where they contributed greatly to cinemas of Russian, German, and Austro-Hungarian empires. Their ethnicity was often overlooked. For example, in his pioneering study about films made on Polish territories during World War I, Mariusz Guzek lists thirty-one films directed by the Polish director Edward Puchalski in Russia from 1915 to 1917,\n\nINTRODUCTION . 5\n\nseveral of them comedies starring the Polish actor Antoni Fertner as Antosza (Antoś). He also lists fourteen films made in Russia with the significant participation of Polish artists from 1915 to 1918, and he provides a list of thirty-two documentaries shot by the Russian military film units on Polish territories.8 To complicate this issue, one should also take into account filmmakers and film inventors born in foreign capitals to Polish parents who became pioneering figures within other national cinemas. For example, the first Polish animator Władysław Starewicz (Ladislas Starewitch, 1882–1965), the world-known pioneer of puppet films, was born in Moscow, made his first films in Kaunas (today Lithuania) and Moscow, and after 1918 continued his career in France. For practical reasons, in this book I consider only those Polish filmmakers who either started their careers in Poland (or the Polish territories) or significantly contributed to the development of the Polish film industry. In addition to creating its own national industry, however, Poland has been greatly contributing to world cinema through its émigrés. Most of them are representatives of what in Poland is called “Polonia” (a term referring to Polish émigrés). Most of them are not discussed here, since their artistic biographies are now a part of other national cinemas. For example, I do not discuss extensively Polish diasporic filmmakers, that is, directors, cinematographers, and actors working outside of Poland. For example, not present in this book is a discussion of films directed outside of Poland by Paweł Pawlikowski. He was born in 1957 in Warsaw, but was educated and made most of his films in England, with the exception of the aforementioned Academy Award–winning Ida. Also absent in this text are the achievements of a group of prominent Polish cinematographers working in the United States, such as Andrzej Bartkowiak (1950– ), Adam Holender (1937– ), Janusz Kamiński (1959– ), Andrzej Sekuła (1954– ), and Dariusz Wolski (1956– ). This book also does not include Polish actors whose careers developed abroad, such as Joanna Pacuła and Gosia Dobrowolska. Several film directors, for example, Roman Polański and Jerzy Skolimowski, are considered as essentially Polish artists despite the fact that they left Poland during the early stages of their careers. Their films made in Poland are discussed in this book in more detail, whereas their international careers are covered only briefly.9\n\n6 . POLISH CINEMA\n\n*** Since the mid-1980s, the concept of national cinema has been much debated in film and cultural studies. Many writers have theorized the idea of a nation, nationalism, and national identity, most often returning to the much-quoted book by Benedict Anderson, Imagined Communities.10 National cinema as a multidimensional theoretical construct appears in Thomas Elsaesser’s book on German, Susan Hayward’s on French, Andrew Higson’s on English, and Tom O’Regan’s on Australian national cinemas, to name just a few classic examples.11 More recently, several studies have addressed the issue of transnational cinema concerning Polish film.12 Apart from the understandable transnational aspect of Polish cinema before 1918 (films made during the last years of the partition period and during World War I), Poland produced films in both Polish and Yiddish during the interwar, so language alone cannot be used as the defining feature of Polish cinema. In recent years, the Polish Film Institute has funded several international productions, including minority projects. Frequently, these borderline films disappear from cinema history books, since they are claimed by different historiographies. While I am cognizant of the theoretical complexities of the issues involving writing a history of a national film industry, for the purpose of this book I have adopted a simple and functional definition of Polish cinema. I examine films that fulfill at least two of the following criteria: works that were made in Poland (or on the Polish territories before 1918), in the Polish language, and by Polish filmmakers (filmmakers living in Poland, regardless of their nationality). Furthermore, I consider the transnational aspect of Polish films: I examine international coproductions with significant Polish contribution (director and part of the crew), as was the case of Kieślowski’s Three Colours trilogy (1993–1994). Rather than provide close textual analysis of select films that have already been seen outside of Poland at international film festivals and discussed by scholars, I prefer to present an extensive factual survey of Polish film in general. Less familiar films and names are included to show the richness of Polish cinema and to build a more complete, balanced picture. The book is divided into eleven chapters. Unlike Polish National Cinema, which included three topical chapters covering the representation of the Stalinist years, the representation of Jewish-Polish relations and the Holocaust, and the new action cinema, this revised edition employs a chronological framework—this periodization largely mirrors the political changes that occurred in Poland. The data provided for\n\nINTRODUCTION . 7\n\nthe films include the year of theatrical release instead of the year of production. During the communist period, the authorities shelved and delayed several films; in such cases, I provide both dates. The Polish title is listed first, followed by the English title in parentheses. All subsequent references employ the English title.\n\nNotes 1. Polish National Cinema was the first comprehensive study of Polish cinema in English.

Consequently, cinema became the only-of-its-kind reserve of local stereotypes, obsessions, and phantasms. —Alina Madej, Mitologie i konwencje Polish cinema has a history essentially as long as cinemas elsewhere. The first screening in the Polish territories with the Lumière brothers’ camera, Cinématographe, took place on 14 November 1896 in Kraków’s municipal theater. The program consisted of some of the films from the first Lumière screening in Paris on 28 December 1895.1 Nevertheless, the public was already familiar with moving images before this screening organized by the Lumières’ representative. As early as mid-1895, Thomas Edison’s Kinetoscopes had been introduced in several major Polish cities, so Poles credited cinema’s discovery to Edison.2 In the early twentieth century in the Polish partitioned territories, as elsewhere, films were shown during public fairs among other wonders of nature. A typical program consisted of documentaries, news, and historical reenactments.3 Films performed vital educational and nation-building functions for Polish audiences. In the absence of the Polish state, these films portrayed images of other Polish cities (now part of different states) and covered important national events such as mass gatherings at funerals of great Polish artists (for example, the memorial services of writers Stanisław Wyspiański in 1907, Eliza Orzeszkowa in 1910, and Bolesław Prus in 1912). Films also recorded the celebrations of significant national moments in history, such as the 1910 Kraków commemorations of the 1410 Battle of Grunwald against the Teutonic Knights, won by the combined Polish and Lithuanian forces. Like other nations, Poland had its own cinematic inventors such as Jan Szczepanik and Bolesław Matuszewski. Piotr Lebiedziński and the Popławski brothers (Jan and Józef) collaborated on the construction of an apparatus that\n\n10 . POLISH CINEMA\n\nFigure 1.1 Kazimierz Junosza-Stępowski. Publicity still. Public domain (www.polona.pl).\n\nPOLISH SILENT CINEMA (1896–1929). 11\n\nrecorded and projected pictures, which they called “Zooskop Uniwersalny.” With the help of “Zooskop,” the Popławski brothers recorded a number of short scenes on glass plates in 1893. In 1896, another Polish scientist and inventor, Kazimierz Prószyński (1875–1945), created his own camera, called—like his studio—Pleograf (Pleograph).4 In 1902, the perfected Pleograph was employed by Prószyński to produce the first Polish narrative film, a simple, single-shot feature, Powrót birbanta (The Return of a Merry Fellow), which introduced one of the most important prewar actors, Kazimierz Junosza-Stępowski (1882–1943). From 1901 to 1903, Prószyński also produced and screened several short documentaries and scenes capturing images of Warsaw. Regular film production in the partitioned Polish territories started, however, some years later with adaptations of the national literary canon, commercially oriented melodramas, and comedies. In 1908, a short comedy, Antoś pierwszy raz w Warszawie (Antoś for the First Time in Warsaw, directed by Jerzy Meyer; real name: Joseph-Louis Mundwiller), produced by the owner of a Warsaw cinema called Oaza, introduced another actor, Antoni Fertner (1874–1959). On the screen, he created a fun-loving, chubby character from the provinces, Antoś, an extension of his own popular theatrical and cabaret performances in Warsaw. After being seen in several comedies as Antoś, Fertner became the first recognizable “star” of Polish cinema. From 1915 to 1918, during World War I, he continued his career in Russia working for, among others, Alexandr Khanzhonkov’s studio.5 Fertner appeared in more than thirty Russian films, earning the nickname “the Russian Max Linder.” He reemerged in Polish cinema in the 1920s. His favorite brand of comedy was farce; coupled with musical comedy, farce flourished in the 1930s, again with Fertner, though now in strong supporting roles. In 1908, a film called Pruska kultura (Prussian Culture, Mordechai Towbin)— the oldest preserved Polish film—introduced a new genre of prewar Polish cinema: “patriotic pictures.”6 The term applies to films set predominantly in recent history that show struggles against Poland’s powerful neighbors and efforts to preserve Polish culture and language in the absence of the Polish state. The prototypical patriotic picture, Prussian Culture depicts the Prussian Poles suffering under the process of Germanization at the turn of the century and portrays their struggles to preserve their national heritage and to stop German colonization. A great number of patriotic pictures were produced during World War I and directed against the most oppressive of the occupiers—the Russian tsarist regime.7 These melodramatic versions of “patriotic kitsch”—such as Ochrana\n\n12 . POLISH CINEMA\n\nwarszawska i jej tajemnice (The Secrets of the Warsaw Police, 1916) and Carat i jego sługi (The Tsarist Regime and Its Servants, 1917), both made by the Jewish-Polish producer/director Aleksander Hertz and his studio Sfinks (Sphinks) in Warsaw— laid the foundations for future national art and became an important part of Polish culture. One of the main accusations that had been raised against early Polish film producers was the lack (or decline) of patriotic themes in locally made films. Other allegations dealt with the decline of public morality and the endangered physical health of the youth. Following the tradition of the French film d’art, theatrical actors began to appear in Polish films to give the new medium a much-desired aura of artistic status. In Polish territories, however, theater was not only the domain of high art but also the respected guardian of national values. Artists were called on to play the roles of educators of the masses and defenders and propagators of national culture. Such a task proved extremely difficult to combine with the requirements of popular culture. Despite that, a surprisingly large number of well-known Polish writers had been either writing specifically for cinema (e.g., Gabriela Zapolska) or allowing their works to be adapted for the screen (e.g., Henryk Sienkiewicz, Eliza Orzeszkowa, and Stefan Żeromski). Adaptations of works published in the early twentieth century created another significant trend in Polish cinema. The year 1911 marks the production of several films adapted from recently published, much-discussed works by Polish authors: Dzieje grzechu (The Story of Sin, Antoni Bednarczyk), based on Stefan Żeromski’s novel; Meir Ezofowicz (Józef Ostoja-Sulnicki), based on Eliza Orzeszkowa’s work; and Sąd Boży (God’s Trial, Stanisław Knake-Zawadzki), based on Stanisław Wyspiański’s drama Sędziowie (The Judges). Since only fragments of Meir Ezofowicz are preserved today at the National Film Archives in Warsaw, and the only source of knowledge about these adaptations remains a few press reports and reviews, it is difficult to discuss their merit as films. We know that they were box office successes, effectively competing with imported films. Although they touched on such problems as the assimilation of Jews (Meir Ezofowicz), they attracted viewers primarily with their sensational, “forbidden” topics (The Story of Sin) and the exoticism of the portrayed community (God’s Trial).8 The historian Sheila Skaff in the only English-language book devoted exclusively to Polish cinema before World War II, The Law of the Looking Glass, Cinema in Poland, 1896–1939, writes the following about Meir Ezofowicz:\n\nPOLISH SILENT CINEMA (1896–1929). 13\n\nThe seemingly bizarre choices made in filming Meir Ezofowicz may have arisen from Herz’s insistence on offering a little something for everyone—for Polish speakers, a Polish novel; for Yiddish speakers, a Yiddish title; for multiculturalists, a story of positive intercultural relations; and for anti-Semites, an anti-Semitic director. Finally, scandal-seekers chitchatted about the fact that a prominent Jewish producer had hired the enemy to direct his films.9 Polish filmmakers were eager to popularize the national literary canon and looked for stage-tested scripts that, apart from signs of high art, contained melodramatic and sensational plots. Their choices had been dictated by the preferences of the Polish viewers. With the exception of the 1912 adaptation of Sienkiewicz’s Szkice węglem (Charcoal Sketches), produced as Krwawa dola (Bloody Fate, Władysław Paliński), other films were adapted from previously popular stage plays or operas. All of them were closely linked with the Polish historical and cultural contexts. Unlike film d’art in France, in Polish productions, “costume was not an indication of theater, a peculiar reference to ‘genuine art,’ but the sign of the presence of Polish culture.”10 This may explain the popularity of the faithful adaptation of Halka (1913, Karol Wojciechowski) from the Polish national opera by Stanisław Moniuszko. Another popular film, adapted from a celebrated play by Władysław Ludwik Anczyc, Kościuszko pod Racławicami (Kościuszko at Racławice, 1913, Orland), was an epic production with thousands of extras that portrayed the defeat of the Tadeusz Kościuszko Insurrection of 1794 by a combined Russian and Prussian army. This film had also been screened for Polish emigrants in the United States and Canada.11 Both domestic and foreign films that had Polish themes, or were based on Polish literary classic works, proved to be box office successes in the Polish territories. One of them was a lavish Italian spectacular Quo Vadis? (1913) by Enrico Guazzoni, adapted from Henryk Sienkiewicz’s classic 1895 novel of the same title and set in Rome under Emperor Nero. The preference of Polish audiences for films narrating their history or referring to Polish culture had been often exploited by film distributors, who did not hesitate to alter titles or intertitles to find an audience.12 “The history of cinema in Poland is, in large part, a history of people alternately participating in and negotiating ways to avoid the linguistic and class tensions with which they lived on a daily basis,” writes Skaff.13 She also emphasizes that although cinema from its origins supported the cause of Polish nationalism, it also “exacerbated existing conflicts between speakers\n\n14 . POLISH CINEMA\n\nof different languages under the partitions.”14 Several recently published regional histories of Polish cinema stress the complexity of the language issue on the Polish territories that were multinational, multilingual, and part of different powerful states.15 The most significant single influence on early Polish films was exercised by Danish melodramas, which were widely distributed in Poland, especially contemporary “decadent” melodramas starring Asta Nielsen and directed by Urban Gad. Polish filmmakers imitated their sensational and tragic stories. They also attempted to portray formerly forbidden topics: sexuality, prostitution, and the world of crime. For example, in Wykolejeni (aka Aszantka, Human Wrecks / The Led Astray, 1913, Kazimierz Kamiński and Aleksander Hertz), one finds the familiar story, also exploited in later Polish films, of a young girl from the province who comes to a big city and is corrupted by its excess and lack of moral principles. The influence of Danish films began to wane during World War I; gradually, German films, including expressionist films, started to dominate the Polish market.\n\nThe Beginning of Yiddish Cinema in Poland A significant number of early films made in the Polish territories were productions in Yiddish, the language of more than ten million Jews living in Eastern Europe and in Jewish Diasporas in the United States.16 Interwar Poland was a multinational state, with national minorities (Jewish, Ukrainian, Belarusian, German, etc.) comprising more than 30 percent of the total population. The census based on language, conducted in 1931, shows that Poles accounted for less than 70 percent of the population. The Jewish minority (speaking Yiddish as the first language) comprised 8.7 percent and was behind the Ukrainian-speaking minority of 14 percent.17 In the capital city of Warsaw (the center of Polish film production), Jews accounted for about 38 percent of the population in 1914, as much as 50 percent in 1917, 26.9 percent in 1921, and 28.4 percent in 1931.18 The first Yiddish films known to have been produced in Poland appeared in 1911, such as Der Wilder Foter (The Savage Father, Marek Arnsztejn [Arnshteyn]). In 1913, six out of sixteen films were productions in Yiddish based mostly on popular plays by Jacob (Jakub) Gordin, such as Der Unbekanter (Stranger, Nachum Lipowski) and Gots Sztrof (God’s Punishment, aka God’s Orchard, Izak Kamiński).19 Warsaw became the center of Yiddish cinema during World War I with such\n\nPOLISH SILENT CINEMA (1896–1929). 15\n\nproduction companies as Kantor Zjednoczonych Kinematografów—branded as “Siła” (Power)—founded by Mordechai (Mordka) Towbin, and Kosmofilm, headed by Samuel (Shmuel) Ginzberg and Henryk Finkelstein, both companies established in 1913. Films in Yiddish had been popular in the 1920s, especially works produced by Leo Forbert’s studio, Leo-Film, and photographed by Forbert’s cousin, Seweryn Steinwurzel, who quickly gained the reputation as arguably the best prewar cinematographer working on both Yiddish and Polish films. Forbert’s production Tkies Kaf (The Vow, aka The Handshake, 1924, Zygmunt Turkow), starring the famous Ester-Rokhl Kamińska (“the Jewish Eleonora Duse”) and her daughter Ida Kamińska (Turkow’s wife), was lauded by, among others, a Polish critic, Andrzej Włast, who praised its on-location scenes, commenting that they were done “with a great feeling of photogeneity.”20 In his book on Yiddish film, J. Hoberman comments that The Vow “confidently drew on folk tradition—the various misalliances and deceptions resolved through divine intervention—and this supernaturalism was certainly part of its appeal.”21 Jewish films and themes were appreciated by Poles and other nationalities living in prewar Poland, who enjoyed their exoticism, reliance on metaphysics, and social themes, such as the Jewish participation in Polish history and the problem of assimilation. Among these films is In di Poylishe Velder (In Polish Woods, 1929, Jonas Turkow), an adaptation of Joseph Opatoshu’s novel published in 1921, which employs well-known Jewish and Polish actors to tell a story about PolishJewish unity during the January Uprising of 1863 against tsarist Russia.22\n\nStudio Sfinks (Sphinx) Film production in the Polish territories before World War I remained the domain of economically feeble, ephemeral studios. This situation continued even after the World War I. For example, 321 feature films produced in interwar Poland (1919– 1939) were made by as many as 146 film production companies. Ninety of them shut down after making their first picture, and only twenty-five were able to make more than three films.23 The studio Sfinks, established in 1909 and headed by Aleksander Hertz (1879– 1928), dominated the film landscape in prewar Poland.24 In 1915, Hertz merged with another studio, Kosmofilm, which also owned a film laboratory in Warsaw.25 With the outbreak of World War I, when other film studios went bankrupt, Hertz\n\n16 . POLISH CINEMA\n\nestablished international contacts first with Russian and then with German companies. These connections helped him to survive on the market and to broaden his sphere of influence. The number of films made in the Polish territories increased during the war. The new Sfinks production and distribution company, headed by Hertz with Henryk Finkelstein as his deputy, established a virtual monopoly. During the German occupation of Warsaw (from August 1915 to November 1918), Sfinks produced, among others, several “patriotic anti-Russian pictures” that reflected the spirit of the times, such as the aforementioned The Secrets of the Tsarist Warsaw Police and The Tsarist Regime and Its Servants.26 Before the end of the war, the studio, which relied heavily on its own version of the star system, was immersed in a crisis. It had lost its two biggest stars, Pola Negri and Mia Mara (Aleksandra Gudowiczówna, later known as Lya Mara), who moved to Germany in 1917. Because of the lack of Polish statehood and a solid film industry, it was common for Polish artists to be active outside of the Polish territories, especially in Berlin, Moscow, and, to a lesser degree, Vienna. Moscow attracted several Polish actors and filmmakers, including Ryszard Bolesławski, Edward Puchalski, and pioneer of puppet cinema Władysław Starewicz (aka Ladislas Starevich, 1892–1965). Born in a Polish family in Moscow, Starewicz received acclaim for his stop motion animation films with insects and dolls, such as The Beautiful Lukanida (1910), The Battle of the Stag Beetles (1910), The Ant and the Grasshopper (1911), and numerous others made at Aleksandr Khanzhonkov’s studio. After 1919, he continued his career in France. Opportunities for Polish artists were not confined to the neighboring capitals; for example, Helena Makowska and Soava Gallone (Stanisława Winawerówna) had successful acting careers in Italy. Despite the growing competition on the Polish market, the early 1920s belonged to Hertz’s Sfinks and its continuing strategy, which recognized the commercial appeal of stars. Hertz was also responsible for launching the career of his new star, Jadwiga Smosarska. In the early 1920s, he produced a series of melodramas, known as the “Sfinks golden series,” with Smosarska as the lead. These were films like Tajemnica przystanku tramwajowego (The Tram Stop Mystery, 1922) and Niewolnica miłości (The Slave of Love, 1923), both directed by Jan Kucharski. Portraying the dangers facing young women, these moralizing films exploited sensational themes under the umbrella of “educational films.” Sfinks dominated mainstream Polish cinema with its combination of patriotic and melodramatic features: the use of national themes and mythologies, the\n\nPOLISH SILENT CINEMA (1896–1929). 17\n\nexploitation of “educational” topics, and borrowings from Hollywood (sensationalism, dynamic action, stars). One of Hertz’s films produced in 1926, O czym się nie myśli (The Unthinkable, Edward Puchalski), contains almost all of the aforementioned features: the sensational title, love that goes beyond class borders (a successful musician from a wealthy family gets involved with a worker’s daughter), and “the girl with the past,” who (to make it worse) is suffering from a venereal disease (the film was intended to campaign against sexually transmitted diseases). Finally, it has love and betrayal mixed with the necessary patriotic theme (the protagonist takes part in the Polish–Soviet War of 1919–1920).27 Although the studio lasted until 1936, Hertz’s premature death in 1928, at the age of forty-nine, marked the end of the first period of Polish cinema.\n\nPolish Film Stars: Pola Negri and Jadwiga Smosarska Hertz’s biggest discovery certainly was Pola Negri (Barbara Apolonia Chałupiec, 1897–1987), a “Polish Asta Nielsen”—a young, photogenic, and energetic star with a modest background in dancing and theater. In a series of unsophisticated but popular melodramas, starting with her debut, Niewolnica zmysłów (Slave of Sin, aka Love and Passion and Slave to Her Senses, 1914, Jan Pawłowski),28 she created a Polish femme fatale who attracts and then destroys her lovers. The eight melodramas that Negri made for Sfinks are frequently set in the exotic Warsaw underworld, and peopled with streetwise characters and outlaws—those driven by passionate love and suffering from its destructive power. In the only surviving film out of eight melodramas made for Sfinks, Bestia (aka Kochanka Apasza; The Polish Dancer, 1917, Aleksander Hertz), as well as in Slave of Sin, the character played by Negri is killed by her jealous former lover. Another film, Żona (Wife, 1915, Jan Pawłowski), is described by a reviewer in 1915 as “the tragedy of a wife who loves her husband but, after a long internal struggle, must accept a disgraceful proposition from her husband’s supervisor because she is afraid that he may lose his job. She confesses her mistake to her husband and then takes her life.”29 Negri sealed her popularity with a series of films made by Sfinks in 1917 known as Tajemnice Warszawy (The Mysteries of Warsaw), which referred to real-life Warsaw criminal activity and erotic affairs.30 The Sfinks origins of Negri’s stardom, as well as the beginnings of her career in Germany, are less well known than her career in the United States. Thanks to her\n\n18 . POLISH CINEMA\n\nFigure 1.2 Pola Negri. Publicity still. Courtesy of Filmoteka Narodowa.\n\nrole in the pantomime Sumurun, produced in 1913 by Ryszard Ordyński (1878– 1953) for a Warsaw theater, Negri moved in 1917 to Berlin to play the same character in Max Reinhardt’s stage production.31 From 1917 to 1922, she starred in approximately twenty German films. Her career, however, accelerated after she met Ernst Lubitsch, who directed her in internationally famous films, such as The Eyes of the Mummy Ma (The Augen der Mumie Ma, 1918), Carmen (1918), Madame DuBarry (Passion, 1919), and Sumurun (aka One Arabian Night, 1920), which enabled her to move with him to Hollywood in 1922.32 After Negri’s departure for Germany, Jadwiga Smosarska (1898–1971) became Sfinks’s leading star in the 1920s, and she remained one of Poland’s major stars into the 1930s.33 Unlike Negri’s aggressive, caricatured women, Smosarska specialized\n\nPOLISH SILENT CINEMA (1896–1929). 19\n\nin characters who embodied a number of clichéd female Polish virtues. Her protagonists were patriotically minded, romantic, well bred, and beautiful, yet they suffered the pangs of unhappy, often tragic, love. She started her career by playing supporting roles in propagandist “patriotic pictures” dealing with the Polish–Soviet War, such as Cud nad Wisłą (Miracle on the Vistula, 1921), directed by Ryszard Bolesławski, an actor, screenwriter, and director trained at the famous Moscow Art Theatre, who moved to Hollywood in 1922.34 Characters played by Smosarska in patriotic pictures are in line with the Polish romantic female stereotype, which was, and still is, present in many Polish films. In Polish iconography, originated during Poland’s partition (1795–1918), a female character stands for suffering, pain, and subordination—the symbol of the suffering country.35 This iconography also stresses that women are responsible for preserving national heritage, since the public sphere, usually the domain of men, is taken by the occupiers. The symbolic Polish woman represents a peculiar form of Polish patriotism, which is a combination of the martyrological (she sacrifices her own welfare for the country—images of numerous mothers sending their sons\n\nFigure 1.3 Jadwiga Smosarska (left) in The Leper (1926), directed by Edward Puchalski and Józef Węgrzyn. Public domain (www.polona.pl).\n\n20 . POLISH CINEMA\n\nto meet their death and glory in a series of national uprisings) and the religious (she is reminiscent of Mary suffering after Christ’s crucifixion). The mythologization of a female character in Polish culture, the stress on her dignity, often leads to her monumentalization and one-dimensional representation, because, “while making choices, she always takes into account the interest of the country, and even the simplest household duty gains exceptional importance as being part of a sacred service for the enslaved country.”36 Smosarska achieved fame later when she appeared in several melodramas produced by Sfinks, such as The Tram Stop Mystery and The Slave of Love. Polish critics compared her no longer with Asta Nielsen (which, at that time, was the highest compliment a Polish actress could get)37 but rather with less theatrical and increasingly popular American actresses, chiefly Lillian Gish. For instance, in Iwonka (1925, Emil Chaberski), she plays an innocent Gish-like character in love with a handsome uhlan (light cavalry) lieutenant, her savior. In this and other works, Sfinks succeeded in creating a mélange of patriotic and melodramatic films that reinforced clichés dealing with Polishness. The setting of the action of Iwonka in so-called Kresy (Borderlands, Polish Eastern Provinces) and images of noble young girls from country manors who parade with their good-looking uhlans are present in many subsequent films. The peak of Smosarska’s career is certainly the box office hit of the 1920s— Trędowata (The Leper, 1926), directed by Edward Puchalski and Józef Węgrzyn, and adapted from the best-selling novel by Helena Mniszkówna. (Mniszkówna’s popular romance had almost no competition in Polish literature, which was then highly didactic and obsessed with history.) The film offers an unsophisticated love story that goes beyond class borders and is free from the political and social responsibilities that restrained “serious” Polish literature. The title of the film refers to the protagonist, Stefcia Rudecka (Smosarska), a young teacher in mutual love with the nobleman Waldemar Michorowski (Bolesław Mierzejewski). Under Stefcia’s civilizing influence, Waldemar leaves his life of revelry and becomes a responsible man. Stefcia is, however, rejected by his family and his class, and treated like a leper. Because of the intrigues instigated by Waldemar’s circle, Stefcia becomes ill and dies before their scheduled wedding. As one Polish critic noticed about this narrative: “[Mniszkówna] employed the pattern so simplified and categories so general that apparent banality had been changed into mythology.”38 The apparent lack of originality and the fact that the action takes place among the Polish rich and famous made the film attractive to “ordinary”\n\nPOLISH SILENT CINEMA (1896–1929). 21\n\nviewers. This may explain many subsequent imitations of Mniszkówna’s writing, as well as many adaptations for the screen of her other works.39\n\nFilm Industry after 1918 The restoration of the Polish state in 1918 created conditions for the development of national art. After the war, however, there was practically no film industry in Poland. The postwar period was affected by the presence of economically feeble Warsaw-based studios, a few outdated films, high tariffs and taxes, and ineffectual distributors based in former partition territories. In 1921, twenty-seven million inhabitants lived in Poland, 69.2 percent of whom were Poles. Cinemas numbered around four hundred.40 During the interwar period, the ratio of cinemas to inhabitants situated Poland at the very low end of the scale in Europe, above only Albania and Yugoslavia. In Poland, there was one cinema for every 46,400 inhabitants, compared to 12,000 inhabitants in Germany and 9,500 in Czechoslovakia.41 The situation had moderately improved toward the end of the 1920s with 727 cinemas in operation.42 Undoubtedly, the economic backwardness, due to the period of partition, and the unstable postwar political and economic reality that Poland experienced after 123 years of nonexistence contributed greatly to this situation.43 The poor Polish economy, inflation, and huge differences in the economic development of various parts of the country contributed to the imposition of heavy taxes on the owners of cinemas. The municipal tax on movie passes was at 50 percent in Warsaw in 1919 and as much as 100 percent in 1920. Such measures led to the decline of attendance, to the sporadic closing of cinemas, and, finally, to an unusual protest strike by cinema owners in 1923. Taxes were lowered in 1926 to 75 percent, and again in 1931, when they oscillated between 10 and 60 percent, depending on the film.44 Taxes had been reduced on Polish “patriotic pictures,” which may partly explain the popularity and rate of recurrence of such pictures in prewar Poland. American films entered the Polish market after the war and became hugely popular. D. W. Griffith’s films were screened in Warsaw for the first time in 1920 (Judith of Bethulia, 1914, and Intolerance, 1915), but the name of the “father of American cinema” was barely mentioned in press reviews. Everything changed in 1922 after the Polish premiere of Griffith’s Orphans of the Storm (1921). Critics\n\n22 . POLISH CINEMA\n\nstarted talking about the American school of filmmaking, associating it no longer with sensationalist action cinema but rather with art films.45 According to Kristin Thompson, American films dominated the Polish market and contributed 39.4 percent of all screened films in 1924, 52.9 percent in 1925, and as much as 70.6 percent in 1926.46 Flooded by American films, Polish authorities tried to impose a ten-to-one contingent plan (ten imported films for every Polish production), which did not materialize because of the pressure Hollywood placed on the Polish minister of foreign affairs and the minister of the interior.47 Although numerous American films were screened in Poland after 1922, immediately after World War I (1918–1921), critics and viewers in Poland preferred European (chiefly German) films to American products.48 Occasionally, American films (including films by Griffith) had been promoted as or compared to German films to find viewers in Poland. Later, films by Griffith, Cecil B. DeMille, and Charlie Chaplin and some American genre films (thrillers and William S. Hart’s Westerns) took the Polish screens by storm. In 1925, some American studios, including the Fox Film Corporation and Universal, established their distribution offices in Poland.49 The mid-1920s also marked the return of French films, including critically acclaimed impressionist films. In 1925, French films held 20 percent of the Polish market, and German films 15 percent.50 Despite the geographical closeness, the number of Soviet films on the Polish market was extremely small because of political censorship in Poland.51 Postwar Poland was a country traditionally suspicious of ideas coming from its communist neighbor, so it is not surprising to note that in 1925 Soviet films had only 0.4 percent of the Polish market; Battleship Potemkin (1925, Sergei Eisenstein) and Mother (1926, Vsevolod Pudovkin) had problems being released on Polish screens.52 However, Russian films made before the Russian Revolution of 1917 and films made by Russian directors who emigrated from Imperial Russia to France were imported to Poland, mostly by Sfinks. From 1918 to 1921, approximately forty such films premiered on Warsaw screens, including pictures starring the Russian émigré actors Ivan Mozzhukhin and Vera Kholodnaya.53\n\nGenre: Patriotic Pictures Immediately after World War I, “patriotic pictures” became a staple of Polish cinema. Heavily promoted by the new Polish state, these films referred to recent wartime experiences and emphasized the role of the Polish Legions and their\n\nPOLISH SILENT CINEMA (1896–1929). 23\n\ncommandant, Marshal Józef Piłsudski, in regaining independence.54 The historic fear of Russia was expressed in several films dealing with the 1920 Polish–Soviet War, such as Miracle on the Vistula, Bohaterstwo polskiego skauta (The Heroism of a Polish Boy Scout, 1920, Ryszard Bolesławski), and Dla Ciebie, Polsko (For You, Poland, 1920, Antoni Bednarczyk). The 1918–1919 battle with the Ukrainian forces for Lvov (today Lviv in Western Ukraine) was portrayed in Tamara (aka Obrońcy Lwowa, The Defenders of Lvov, 1919), made by the first and only female Polish director working during the silent period—Nina Niovilla.55 Films confronting recent Polish-German history were scarce but did exist. For example, the turbulent modern history of industrial Upper Silesia, with its series of risings against German rule, was the topic of the propagandist Nie damy ziemi skąd nasz ród (We Will not Give up Our Land, 1920, Władysław Lenczewski). Another film, the well-received Bartek zwycięzca (Bartek, the Victor, 1923, Edward Puchalski), was adapted from Sienkiewicz’s novella about the struggles to preserve Polishness under the German rule, and it starred the famous Polish wrestler Władysław Pytlasiński. In the mid-1920s, Polish patriotic pictures had been evolving in two directions: political melodrama and historical reconstruction. The first group, including films such as Miłość przez ogień i krew (Love Through Fire and Blood, 1924, Jan Kucharski), has been aptly summarized as follows: “In search of an attractive script, the producers were ready to reach for whatever themes, ideas, programs, atmosphere, political news; they treated them in the manner of cheap pulp fiction.”56 Historical reconstructions include films made chiefly after Marshal Piłsudski’s coup d’état in May 1926, during the so-called Sanacja (literally, period of moral purification). These films mythologized Piłsudski, his Polish Legions, and the patriotic tradition they represented. Frequently, they dealt with the January Uprising (powstanie styczniowe) of 1863 against tsarist Russia or with the 1905 revolution in the Russiancontrolled part of Poland. The ideology of the 1863 and 1905 heroic struggles served the newly emerging mythology of Marshal Piłsudski’s Polish Legions well. The regaining of independence in 1918 was portrayed in Polish historiography as a result of the earlier efforts by the young and desperate patriots.57 The former assistant of Robert Wiene, Józef Lejtes (1901–1983), directed one of the best examples of patriotic pictures, Huragan (The Hurricane, 1928, PolishAustrian production). Its story of suffering and intrepid struggle is told through tableaux-like compositions, modeled on Artur Grottger’s series of sketches titled Polonia (1863) and Lithuania (1864–1866). Grottger’s powerful visions of the uprising—stressing its heroic and tragic dimension, patriotic fervor, and the pain\n\n24 . POLISH CINEMA\n\nof the defeat—virtually replaced the factual knowledge about the 1863 insurrection. Grottger and the painter Jan Matejko are often credited as being responsible for influencing Polish national imagery. Grottger’s works frequently overshadowed and emulated later literary attempts to retell the events of 1863. In the interwar period, Polish films followed Grottger’s version of the events and his manner of portraying patriotism, pathos, and religious and patriotic symbols. As Alina Madej rightly points out, Grottger’s imagery—as seen in its theatricalization of mise-en-scène, actors’ poses, and lighting—had overtaken the film. In so doing, the director Lejtes follows the long Polish tradition of staging “live paintings,” usually allegories of abstract concepts (such as “Poland,” “freedom”), or the “apotheosis” of important historical figures.58 References to Polish painting tradition aside, the martyrological national drama by Lejtes also contains elements of Griffith’s dynamic editing techniques and melodrama. The love story between a young insurgent, Tadeusz Orda (Zbigniew Sawan), and a proud noblewoman, Helena Zawiszanka (Renata Renée), is set against the backdrop of the 1863 January Uprising. Rather than following the unwritten rules of melodrama, The Hurricane ends tragically, as do many Polish historical dramas: after learning about his lover’s death at the hands of the Russians, the insurgent dies a heroic death, attacking the enemy with a group of his compatriots. The final call to arms and the suicidal charge, however, bring some hope. They symbolically link the events of 1863 with the year 1918, creating a connection with another group of insurgents: the victorious Piłsudski’s legionnaires. A combination of the patriotic and the melodramatic is also present in many other films that tell the story of the 1863 uprising. Some of them are literary adaptations, for example, Rok 1863 (Year 1863, 1922, Edward Puchalski), based on Stefan Żeromski’s novel Wierna rzeka (Faithful River).59 The blend of melodrama and history, with the addition of the assimilationist discourse, is also discernible in a group of Yiddish films, addressed primarily to Jewish audiences: In Polish Woods and Henryk Szaro’s debut in Yiddish, Der Lamedvovnik (One of the Thirty-Six, 1925). Furthermore, the return of recent history is also seen in a small group of films about “Piłsudski’s road to Poland,” such as Mogiła nieznanego żołnierza (The Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, 1927) by Ryszard Ordyński and Szaleńcy (Daredevils, 1928, rereleased in 1934 in the sound version) by Leonard Buczkowski (1900–1967). The Tomb of the Unknown Soldier contains many elements of another group of Polish films: dramas inspired by metempirical phenomena, such as metempsychosis and telepathy, and peopled by demonic characters (and by mediums and ghosts).\n\nPOLISH SILENT CINEMA (1896–1929). 25\n\nGerman influences, sometimes described in Poland pejoratively as mabuzeria (inferior imitations of Fritz Lang and early Paul Wegener dramas),60 are apparent in several films: Blanc et noir (1919, Eugeniusz Modzelewski, written by Dimitri Buchowetzki, who also played the leading role), Syn szatana (Satan’s Son, 1923, Bruno Bredschneider), Orlę (Young Eagle, 1927, Wiktor Biegański), and Mocny człowiek (A Strong Man, 1929, Henryk Szaro). The latter, an adaptation of Stanisław Przybyszewski’s novel published in 1913, received critical acclaim—the leading role was played by the Ukrainian-born actor Gregori Chmara, who had earlier appeared in classic German films such as Raskolnikow (Crime and Punishment, 1923, Robert Wiene) and Die freudlose Gasse (The Joyless Street (1925, Georg Wilhelm Pabst). German Kammerspielfilm influences, chiefly Pabst’s films, are noticeable in Kropka nad i (The Final Touch, 1928) and Policmajster Tagiejew (The Police Chief Tagiejew, 1929), both films directed by Juliusz Gardan (Gradstein, 1901–1944). The latter was based on Gabriela Zapolska’s novel and produced by Leo-Film, which\n\nFigure 1.4 Gregori Chmara and Maria Majdrowicz in A Strong Man (1929), directed by Henryk Szaro. Courtesy of Filmoteka Narodowa.\n\n26 . POLISH CINEMA\n\nemerged as the strongest film studio after Sfinks. Toward the end of the 1920s, however, Polish films were not being compared to German cinema; now the comparison was to American film. For instance, Czerwony błazen (Red Jester, 1926, Henryk Szaro) was praised by the critic Leon Bruno, who noted that this fine film bears “the signs of the good American school, assimilated by the clever and talented disciple.” The much-praised beginning of Buczkowski’s debut Daredevils was “indeed American” for one of the reviewers.61\n\nAdaptations and Personal Style Polish cinema has been known for its close bonds with national literature. In the early twentieth century, literature provided an abundance of patriotic and social themes not only for the stateless nation but also for the emerging national cinema. It also gave Polish cinema some respectability among audiences and helped to grant cinema the stature of art. Adaptations of the national canon remained very popular in the second half of the 1920s. Literary works by, among others, Stefan Żeromski, Józef Ignacy Kraszewski, Adam Mickiewicz, and the Nobel laureates Władysław Stanisław Reymont and Henryk Sienkiewicz had been written by notable contemporary writers and adapted for the screen. The most prestigious productions include Ziemia obiecana (The Promised Land, 1927, Aleksander Hertz and Zbigniew Gniazdowski) and Pan Tadeusz (1928, Ryszard Ordyński). The former, adapted from Reymont’s novel of the same title, commemorated the twentieth anniversary of Hertz’s work as a film producer. The latter, Pan Tadeusz, adapted from Mickiewicz’s national book-length poem, became the focal point of the celebrations of the tenth anniversary of Polish independence. Although very popular among the audiences for their faithfulness to the esteemed literary sources, these films were rarely praised by contemporary critics, who frequently faulted the trivialization of the original, the literariness of the film, the lack of originality, and, usually, the lack of professionalism. The 1920s also marked the appearance of the first directors with recognizable personal style. Probably the most interesting of them was the actor-writer-directorproducer Wiktor Biegański (1892–1974), who started his career in 1913 with Dramat Wieży Mariackiej (The Drama of the St. Mary’s Church Tower, unreleased). In 1921, he co-established a film cooperative, Kinostudio. He became the founder of the Warsaw Film Institute in 1924, which produced several prominent prewar Polish\n\nPOLISH SILENT CINEMA (1896–1929). 27\n\nstars such as Nora Ney, Adam Brodzisz, and Maria Bogda. Biegański was also responsible for launching the career of his assistants, future leading Polish directors, including Michał Waszyński and Leonard Buczkowski. Biegański is primarily known for a series of melodramas that usually deal with the themes of betrayed love, rape, and, eventually, the revenge of the deceived.62 He is also known for his innovative use of locations that perform an important dramatic role in some of his films, for example, in his works set in the Tatra Mountains, such as Otchłań pokuty (The Abyss of Repentance, 1922) and Bożyszcze (The Idol, 1923). Unlike other producers, Biegański tried to pursue personal, independent projects and paid a heavy price for it. Situated on the periphery of the mainstream cinema, his films were well received by critics but ignored by audiences and attacked by the government for their lack of “patriotic” and nationalistic themes. Critics praised his works for their dynamic montage, painterly mise-en-scène, and ability to tell a story visually. They also commented that Biegański had been influenced by the German expressionist and the French impressionist cinema.63 Another important influence discernible in Biegański’s works comes from prerevolutionary Russian cinema, chiefly films produced by Alexandr Khanzhonkov’s company. This influence, present in particular in Biegański’s most popular film, Wampiry Warszawy (The Vampires of Warsaw, 1925), is apparent in his films’ rich mise-en-scène, slow pace, tragic denouements, and stress on psychologization—traits that are characteristic of films made by Yevgeni Bauer for Khanzhonkov. Biegański’s later films, made before the advent of sound—for instance, Kobieta, która grzechu pragnie (The Woman Who Desires Sin, aka When a Wife Cuckolds Her Husband, 1929)—were less popular with critics. Toward the end of the 1920s, a new group of directors emerged, including Józef Lejtes, Leonard Buczkowski, Henryk Szaro, Michał Waszyński, and Juliusz Gardan. They dominated Polish filmmaking in the 1930s by producing some of the best examples of prewar Polish cinema. For example, the prolific Michał Waszyński (Moshe Waks, 1904–1965), who made as many as thirty-nine films from his 1929 debut, Pod banderą miłości (Under the Banner of Love), to 1939’s Włóczęgi (The Tramps), is responsible for films that are considered the most representative of Polish films (including films in Yiddish) of the 1930s.64 The change of guard also indicates the origins of a new sensibility and a novel, more professional, approach to cinema.\n\n28 . POLISH CINEMA\n\nEarly Polish Film Theory and Criticism In interwar Poland, film theory and criticism formed an original and interesting domain of thought, not limited to incorporating ideas from abroad, but instead proposing its own concepts. In contrast to the first Western European theorists, who tried to define the specificity of cinema, Polish authors were more interested in film’s place in society and its cultural role. Although the film industry was economically weak, film theory and criticism flourished during the first years of independence. According to Marcin Giżycki, the mediocrity of film production in prewar Poland provided the impetus to campaign for artistic cinema. Between the two world wars, Polish intellectuals and artists went through a peculiar “film fever,”65 as Giżycki calls it, which was quite incompatible with the current stage of development of local cinema. The result of this “creative fever” deserves more careful examination. The first texts written by a Pole on cinema appeared as early as 1898: Bolesław Matuszewski’s two studies published in Paris, “Une nouvelle source de l’Histoire” (A new source of history) and “La Photographie animée” (Animated photography).66 These were pioneer texts, arguably on a world scale, that aimed at presenting the practical possibilities of film to the world of science and government institutions. Though now almost forgotten, these works were well received and debated in many French journals.67 Matuszewski (1856–1943?), a well-known Warsaw photographer and camera operator, worked for the Lumière brothers in Poland, France, and Russia, where, in 1897, Tsar Nicholas II awarded him the title of court cinematographer. As a camera operator traveling across Europe, Matuszewski was interested primarily in the recording function of film as an eyewitness to history. Film, according to Matuszewski, provides new research methods for the science of history by supplying it with “direct vision.” In his studies, he considers “living photographs” capable of truthful documentation of reality. Unlike traditional photography, which is capable of distortions and falsifications, “living photographs” can present only “absolute truth.”68 Matuszewski grounds this opinion, interestingly, on the technical impossibility of altering thousands of pictures (frames). Matuszewski, regarded in Poland as the pioneer of scientific cinema, in his studies stresses cinema’s educational and cultural role in bringing nations together. He postulates the creation of film archives, a “storehouse of historical cinematography,” functioning as a “new source of history.” He also calls for the\n\nPOLISH SILENT CINEMA (1896–1929). 29\n\npublication of a professional film journal devoted to technical and cultural aspects of cinema. Given his practical and theoretical interest in documenting rather than reproducing reality, Matuszewski marginalizes, as might be expected, the narrative opportunities of cinema. He follows the Lumières’ line of the development of cinema, namely, of those who “believe in reality.” After Polish independence was regained, the social and cultural implications of cinema became of prime importance. The lack of a strong film industry probably explains the interest in cultural rather than purely cinematic issues. Most writers on cinema, while agreeing on the medium’s entertainment role, stressed the complexity of the filmic phenomenon and noted its documentary, cultural, and educational functions. Like other “silent theorists,” Polish writers compared cinema with other arts in order to elevate cinema to the status of art. They also stressed those properties of cinema that were unique to the new medium. Unlike in France and the Soviet Union, where cinema was mostly discussed by practitioners associated with the film industry (in other words, by people interested in aesthetic issues), in Poland film attracted primarily the interest of critics who were not professionally involved in film production and evaluation. These were mainly writers, literary and art critics, art historians, and educators. Most critics were not academic teachers or scholars per se, as was the case with many German film theorists. We may partly attribute the lack of serious discussions of the formal aspects of cinema to critics’ social and educational interests and to their ignorance of cinema’s aesthetic problems. An important influence and a continuous point of reference for early Polish writers on cinema were provided by the German theoretical legacy. Not only did the German language occupy the position of a principal language of Central Europe, but Germany, “the land of theory,” as Walter Bloem writes (without exaggeration),69 also provided stimuli for theoretical debates and engaged Polish critics and writers with its polemics. In the 1920s, Polish writers and literary critics started to be more interested in cinema’s aesthetic issues, and French influences became more discernible, especially the impact of avant-garde concepts. The assimilation of ideas from the French impressionist cinema movement of the 1920s enabled the actor turned critic and then filmmaker Leon Trystan (1899– 1941),to develop his own concept, which focuses on the specificity of film. Although Trystan did not produce a theoretical book on cinema, he attempted to develop a coherent film theory in his articles.\n\n30 . POLISH CINEMA\n\nTrystan popularized the French impressionist avant-garde theory of Louis Delluc and Jean Epstein.70 In his works published from 1922 to 1924, Trystan propagates poetic cinema: cinema that is avant-garde, “photogenic,” influenced by the concept of “film as music.”71 The concept of photogénie (filmowość), part of “pure cinema” consisting of movement alone, occupies a central position in Trystan’s writings. He pronounces that “a theorist dealing with film aesthetics should consider a movement itself, a movement as a movement, with the exception of ‘content’ … he should deal only with formal values of cinema.” 72 When compared with other Polish theorists of that time, Trystan is more preoccupied with aesthetic issues, which is why he was attacked by other, more culturally inclined critics, including Karol Irzykowski. Trystan made seven feature films from 1926 to 1938. In the first two, made in 1927, Kochanka Szamoty (Szamota’s Lover) and Bunt krwi i żelaza (The Mutiny of Blood and Iron), he tried to follow his theoretical premises; he combined melodrama with “photogenic” scenes that enhanced the atmosphere and created suspense. The later films were commercial undertakings. His last film, A Brivele der Mamen (A Little Letter to Mother, 1938, codirected with Joseph Green), was made in Yiddish and premiered in the United States after the war. The first original work and the crowning accomplishment of prewar Polish film theory was Karol Irzykowski’s X Muza: Zagadnienia estetyczne kina (The tenth muse: Aesthetic problems of cinema), published first in 1924.73 Well known in Poland, but still limited to readers of Polish, this book could have played an important role in the development of classical film theory if it had been translated. Karol Irzykowski (1873–1944), a literary critic and writer and one of the most important figures on the Polish literary scene, followed other early film theorists and tried to overcome some prejudices against cinema. As early as 1913, Irzykowski was already writing, in a manner reminiscent of Emilie Altenloh, the German author of the first serious sociological study on cinema,74 that “a contemporary European goes to the cinema but is ashamed of it.”75 Even though Irzykowski proudly states that he does not quote others because cinema is still “the field untouched by thinkers” and therefore he is “the source,”76 his theoretical study is partly influenced by the German theoretical tradition. He refers primarily to works by Konrad Lange, Hermann Häfker (the author of probably the first monograph on film aesthetics),77 and Rudolf Holzapfel. Irzykowski also debates the concept of photogénie expressed by Delluc and Epstein and propagated in Poland beginning\n\nPOLISH SILENT CINEMA (1896–1929). 31\n\nin 1922 by Trystan. In addition, Irzykowski references prominent Polish critics and theorists such as Leon Belmont, Stanisław Brzozowski, and Tadeusz Peiper. According to many film scholars, Irzykowski’s study belongs to the most important works of film theory produced in the 1920s.78 Paul Coates interprets The Tenth Muse’s obscure status outside Poland as being the consequence of its “accidental” formulation in Polish, which resulted in “its exclusion from the ranks of the world’s imperially disseminated languages” because of “the fierce jealousy with which Poles hug their national culture to themselves.” Yet. this cannot be the sole reason. The aphoristic writing of Irzykowski, so different from the academic works of German theorists, contributed to his work’s lack of popularity. Coates aptly compares Irzykowski’s style to that of Jean-Luc Godard. Furthermore, Coates implies that there is, in fact, “no ‘Irzykowski line’ on cinema”; instead, one finds a labyrinth of “interlocking lines the reader is invited to extend beyond the confines of the book.”­79 The fact that The Tenth Muse was written concurrently with the development of cinema (the volume’s first chapter was finished in 1913) gives it a personal flavor; the book resembles an intellectual diary. Irzykowski is aware of all the problems an innovative theory has to face. In the introduction, he writes that he has purposely left many questions unanswered and is not afraid of contradictions because his intention is not to “transform theory into a system.”80 The personal character of The Tenth Muse is probably one of the main reasons why Irzykowski’s work never received the wide acclaim and readership as did, for instance, the systematic study by Béla Balázs81 published in the same year. Unlike many of his contemporaries, Irzykowski focuses on the artistic possibilities of film rather than on its present, imperfect stage of development. When compared with the other arts, states Irzykowski, cinema’s unique feature is the visibility of movement of material forms, illustrating man’s struggle with matter. In the very first paragraph of the introduction, he defines film as “the visible association of man with matter.” 82 This laconic and complex pronouncement, the nucleus of his theory, already appeared in 1913. Developing the man-matter dichotomy, he writes: “The ‘man and matter’ formula, in any case, simply corresponds to the optical relations between things in a film: in a film, matter is generally an immobile part, an inert background, whilst it is man who triggers movement, change and unrest.”83 Irzykowski believes that by capturing reality that has not been processed artistically (“naked nature, not covered by a network of human concepts”),84 film\n\n32 . POLISH CINEMA\n\nallows the viewer to uncover the world free from misrepresentation of concepts and words. In line with the German theorists influenced by Gestalt psychology (e.g., Hugo Münsterberg), Irzykowski stresses the roles of memory, conscience, and imagination, which enable cinema to penetrate our inner world. As Jadwiga Bocheńska appropriately points out, Irzykowski, as early as 1903, was already paying a great deal of attention to the mystifying role played by both conscious and subconscious processes in his experimental antinovel Pałuba. Echoing Bergson, Irzykowski claims that cinema imitates the mechanism of human perception and, furthermore, simulates human memory, imagination, and conscience. In this context, film is viewed as being capable of reproducing with equal adequacy external reality and internal processes, even without the direct participation of an artist.85 Taking into account Irzykowski’s emphasis on the uniqueness of the cinematic medium, it comes somewhat as a surprise to find that he places it outside contemporary aesthetics. Despite his sympathy for cinema, and the lack of any intellectual prejudice against cinema, the reason for situating cinema outside of the domain of aesthetics is quite pragmatic: by employing concepts of traditional aesthetics, chiefly works by Rudolf Holzapfel, Irzykowski cannot prove that film is truly an art form. Instead, he claims that, from the point of view of contemporary aesthetics, film belongs to “inauthentic” arts, which work with the given materials of nature, such as gardening, the art of the actor, or pedagogy. The decisive factor, however, that contributed to Irzykowski’s stand was most likely the influence of Konrad Lange, a German authority who refused film the status of art. Lange asserted that the moving picture is only a mechanical reproduction of reality, a nonartistic illusion.86 Irzykowski claims, however, that film does not necessarily have to be considered art to perform its function as “a filter of reality.” Its main task is to register the world around us. The only instance, Irzykowski believes, in which film may be considered an art form, in line with contemporary aesthetics, is the case of cartoons, which belong to the realms of both painting and film. In cartoon, a metaphor of reality, an artist has full control over the entire creative process.87 Yet, the author of The Tenth Muse discusses mainstream narrative films, not cartoons. Irzykowski’s study, like many other once innovative, now historically important works, remains unknown to the English reader already familiar with great systematizers like Balázs or Rudolf Arnheim and famous filmmakers and theoreticians such as Eisenstein or Pudovkin. Irzykowski’s motivation in producing\n\nPOLISH SILENT CINEMA (1896–1929). 33\n\nhis theoretical study was to influence the course of Polish cinema. Yet, despite his importance and broad readership in Poland (there were numerous reprints after the war), Irzykowski’s ideas had only limited influence on cinematic practice and on the dominant mode of theorizing and film criticism.88\n\nNotes 1.

Lewandowski notes that Negri’s role in Ordyński’s Sumurun was a turning point that helped to establish her career in Berlin; it proved to be more important than her films. Negri also stresses the importance of Ordyński’s pantomime in her autobiography. Negri, Memoirs of a Star, 119–29. It must be noted, however, that Sfinks’s films featuring Negri were distributed in Germany. Ryszard Ordyński (Dawid Blumenfeld) was a respected theater and film director, as well as a well-traveled theater reviewer. He worked as Max Reinhardt’s assistant in Berlin and directed plays for the Deutsches Theater. In 1915, he moved to the United States, where he worked as a stage director at the Metropolitan Opera (credited as Richard Ordynski). After collaborating with major American studios as a screenwriter, actor, and director, he returned to Poland in 1920, making his first film in 1927. 32. Negri starred in several Hollywood films directed by, among others, Ernst Lubitsch (Forbidden Paradise, 1924), Raoul Walsh (East of Suez, 1925), Dimitri Buchowetzki (Lily of the Dust, 1924, The Crown of Lies, 1926), Mauritz Stiller (Hotel Imperial, 1927; The Woman on Trial, 1927), and Rowland V. Lee (Three Sinners, 1928; Loves of an Actress, 1928). In the early 1930s, after appearing in her first sound film, A Woman Commands (1932, Paul L. Stein), Negri moved back to Germany, where she starred in films such as Mazurka (1935, Willi Forst) and Madame Bovary (1937, Gerhard Lamprecht). In 1941, Negri returned to America. In 1964, she appeared in her last film, The Moon Spinners, directed by James Neilson. Details from Negri’s life can be found in her 1970 autobiographical book, Memoirs of a Star, and in Mariusz Kotowski’s monograph, Pola Negri: Hollywood’s First Femme Fatale (Lexington: University of Kentucky Press, 2014).

Details concerning Jadwiga Smosarska’s life and career can be found in Małgorzata Hendrykowska, Smosarska (Poznań: Wydawnictwo Naukowe Uniwersytetu im. Adama Mickiewicza, 2007). 34. Ryszard Bolesławski (Srzednicki, aka Richard Boleslawski, 1889–1937) in 1923 created the American Laboratory Theatre in New York in order to promote Stanislavski’s method acting. Later, after the advent of sound, he became a successful Hollywood director with such films as Rasputin and the Empress (1933), The Painted Veil (1934), and The Garden of Allah (1936), working with some of Hollywood’s biggest stars, including Greta Garbo, Marlene Dietrich, Lionel Barrymore, and Charles Laughton. Bolesławski’s career is discussed in Marek Kulesza Ryszard Bolesławski: Umrzeć w Hollywood (Warsaw: Państwowy Instytut Wydawniczy, 1989). 35.

The violently disputed borders with Polish neighbors were finally settled at the Riga Treaty, signed in March 1921, which ended the war between Soviet Russia and Poland (1919–1921). The defeat of the Soviet army, led by General Mikhail Tukhachevsky, at Warsaw, known as the Cud nad Wisłą (Miracle on the Vistula), occupies a place of prominence in Polish mythology and, consequently, in Polish film. 44.

Contrary to popular opinion, Soviet cinema had some admirers in Poland. One of the leading prewar Polish critics, Stefania Zahorska, was known as a promoter of films in which imaginative form matches “humanistic content,” the ideal of which she found in the montage cinema of the Soviets, especially that of Eisenstein. Her stand was far from common, given the situation in Poland after the Polish–Soviet War. According to Sheila Skaff, Battleship Potemkin was released in Poland in 1927.
