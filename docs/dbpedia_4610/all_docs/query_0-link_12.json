        "text": "A well shot and very good looking film with good performances particularly that of the female lead Grazyna Dtugotecka. As with several of the films of Walerian Borowczyk, however, part of the charm is the idiosyncratic pacing. Some films are more subject to this than others, seeming, an almost arbitrary mix of very slow sequences and speeded up ones barely allowing enough time for the viewer to absorb the goings on. The director's, The Strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Miss Osbourne issues this technique to marvellous effect but here it can be distracting and with the film already rather lengthy, perhaps something that could be done without. Nevertheless this is entertaining enough and covers much ground from the young girl's virginal confession and through love and hate, motherhood and murder, robbery and rape, prostitution and more. If the film is a little overlong there is much to enjoy with a turbulent story and some ravishing visuals\n\nHaving found in the past that Arrow put out seperate releases for other films by directors they have done dedicated sets for,I decided to check for this film maker. Pleased to find they had put out another of his works,I sat down for a tale.\n\nView on the film:\n\nMatching the care shown for the film makers work in their earlier set, Arrow present a fantastic transfer,with the sharp soundtrack and crisp print being backed by extensive, detailed extras.\n\nThe only time he made a live action film in his home country of Poland, directing auteur Walerian Borowczyk crosses visual motifs and a major recurring theme in his works,within the opening shot, as a distorted Ewa is lectured to about sin by a self-important priest.\n\nBreaking a run he had been on in being the editor of his own projects, with editor Lidia Pacewicz brilliantly entering the role,whose measured cuts keep the surrealist flourishes held as part of the wider picture of Ewa's life. Closely working with cinematographer Zygmunt Samosiuk, Borowczyk reveals a refined eye that gazes on a passionate Melodrama atmosphere of graceful long tracking shots gliding to the lowest depths Ewa's life hits,in an irresistible, romantic final shot.\n\nCarrying a heaviness of following Ewa's troubled life (with Ewa being the latest in Borowczyk's major theme of a woman being the lead in his works) Borowczyk continues to build on his surrealist stylisation, with a excellent framing of Ewa's conversations reflected in objects and taking place behind closed doors creating a vision of seeing Ewa in her most private moments.\n\nWearing Ewa's life in only her second feature film, Grazyna Dlugolecka gives a incredible, subtly expressive performance as Ewa, whose bleak, brittleness from the horrors inflicted on her being placed by Dlugolecka on top of the faint hope Ewa holds by her fingertips,of discovering a happy ending in her story of sin.\n\nPeople either praise this film or rate it very low. Unfortunately, I was bored with this production. In a way, there are plenty of events here, but you get the impression that several stories were cut out from something and directly glued together without any explanation what happened between them. Those pieces are joined together by leading female character but sometimes it feels like the other characters popped out randomly. I do not understand this but plenty of things happen and there are hardly interesting to follow. The novel by Å»eromski was not that long and the film is quite lengthy. Nonetheless, it could possibly be better when converted to miniseries, obviously with some extensions to understand the motives and suffering of the main character (compare Lalka film and series). Disappointing, but I would not discourage from seeing and making one's own opinion about it."
