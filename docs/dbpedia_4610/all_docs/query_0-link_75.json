        "text": "Source: Warner Bros. Pictures Japan, FilmPressPlus Official Site: gukoroku.jp (Japan) Special Thanks to Richard Lormand\n\nA SCIFI JAPAN EXCLUSIVE\n\nWarner Bros. Pictures Japan and international publicity agent FilmPressPlus have provided press notes and high-res photos for their new mystery, GUKOROKU – TRACES OF SIN (???, Gukoruku). The movie opens in Japan on February 18th.\n\nINTRODUCTION GUKOROKU - TRACES OF SIN is a haunting and intense tale of the demons we face every day -- inside and out. Satoshi Tsumabuki (THE ASSASSINS by Hou Hsiao-Hsien, THE LITTLE HOUSE by Yohji Yamada, VILLAIN by Lee Sang-il ) and Hikari Mitsushima (HARA-KIRI: DEATH OF A SAMURAI by Takashi Miike, LOVE EXPOSURE by Sion Sono) star as the reporter Tanaka and his troubled sister Mitsuko. A graduate of ?ód? Film School and director of short films selected at New Directors, New Films and Sitges, Kei Ishikawa makes his feature directorial debut, from a screenplay by Kosuke Mukai (LINDA LINDA LINDA, MATSUGANE POTSHOT AFFAIR by Nobuhiro Yamashita), based on the Naoki Prize nominee novel Gukoroku by Tokuro Nukui. Office Kitano’s Makoto Kakurai produces with executive producers Masayuki Mori & Takio Yoshida (OUTRAGE BEYOND, HANA-BI by Takeshi Kitano). The crew includes director of photography Piotr Niemyjski (FOREIGN BODY by Krzysztof Zanussi) and casting director Takefumi Yoshikawa (Academy Award for Best Foreign Film DEPARTURES by Yojiro Takita). GUKOROKU - TRACES OF SIN was shot in selected locations around Tokyo in Spring 2016. SYNOPSIS Tanaka is going through a tough time trying to support his younger sister Mitsuko, recently arrested and on hold in jail. An investigative reporter, he immerses himself into a story about a shocking murder case gone cold. The “perfect” family – successful businessman, beautiful wife and adorable child – were brutally murdered a year ago and the case remains unsolved. Tanaka interviews their friends and acquaintances, and as stories of their true nature unfold, he begins to discover that the family was not as ideal as believed. The interviewees themselves unveil their own hidden natures, revealing a disturbing portrait of social elitism.\n\nCOMMENTS FROM DIRECTOR KEI ISHIKAWA REACHING FOR THE TOP I remember when I started living in Tokyo about 7 years ago, I was really struck by the Shibuya crossing. It seemed like people were all rushing about to reach the center of the world without really knowing what or where that actually is. There isn’t really a center point in Tokyo, so people just circle around. Everyone keeps walking as part of a massive crowd. This is how I interpret the dynamic of Japanese social cliques. The characters in GUKOROKU, while each admiring, dreaming and striving for that center point, reaching for the top, but they end up finding themselves in a downward spiral of nothing. These characters represent a microcosm of Japan today. To me, GUKOROKU is THE GREAT GATSBY of present day Japan, wrapped up in a mystery.\n\nTHE INSIDERS I’m from the countryside and I studied up north in university, so I didn’t have any experiences with social cliques. I discovered this more urban phenomenon when I came to Tokyo. Japanese social cliques are somewhat different. In Europe, those social cliques are visible somehow and you would be pushed out. But here in Japan, they are invisible. Most of the time, such attitudes arise from an inferiority complex. CHAPTERS What attracted me the most about this novel was that it wasn’t written with the intention of becoming a film. It’s a confession style novel with some chapters of interviews and I knew it would be challenging to adapt it. In other words, we had to invent our own way but because of this we could put our own interpretation in the script. I also liked that it’s not a pure crime mystery novel. Who killed the family is a big twist in the story, but that’s not the point of the story. And my true interest wasn’t there either. ABSURDITY\n\nI didn’t imagine a mystery film would be my first feature. My original ideas for a film were mostly dramas and absurd comedies. One of the biggest challenges for me in working with this material was probably when I explained the complex story to my grandmothers... I’m not very picky when it comes to genre. I look for themes and characters. Comedy, sci-fi, it doesn’t matter. My interest is always about how absurd this world can be and how absurdly we live in it. POLISH EYE We didn’t intend to achieve anything special for the film to look different from other Japanese films. GUKOROKU is an example of how I like to film and how I work with a cinematographer. Of course, my Polish cinematographer’s eye affects the frame a lot. Probably where he places the camera is slightly different from Japanese cinematographers. ?ód? My film studies in ?ód?, Poland, changed my views a lot. When I was making films in Poland, nothing seemed real to me. It was not my language, not my childhood. When I shot a documentary there, the reality turned out surreal and absurd to me. I started to seek out something universal in the subject and characters. Interestingly I had to do the same here as well, when making a film in Japan about my own culture. I had to look for something universal in this story and characters. I’m not sure if studying in Lodz has added any European tendencies to my filmmaking. I generally feel that I have been more influenced by Kon Ichikawa’s or Shohei Imamura’s films. I am interested in exploring different frames and more dynamic camera works. I would also like the chance to make features not only in Japan, but also in Europe and elsewhere.\n\nCAST AND DIRECTOR PROFILES Satoshi TSUMABUKI (as Tanaka) is a versatile actor comfortable and successful in both mainstream entertainment and challenging roles.
