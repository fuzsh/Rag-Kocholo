        "text": "Imagine a new era of filmmaking, powered by DAOs! üé¨üåü A DAO, or Decentralized Autonomous Organization, is a fresh type of corporation that's taking the world by storm. Imagine a film studio where everyone has a voice. üó£Ô∏è Where decisions aren't made by a single executive, but by a collective of passionate film lovers. This is the power of a DAO. Now, imagine this concept applied to the world of AI in film. üé•üí° We're talking about a future where AI doesn't just assist in filmmaking, but actively participates in the process. Where AI isn't just a tool, but a collaborator, a partner, a co-creator. This isn't just a dream, it's a real possibility. And it's closer than you might think. Film AI llc Stay tuned for more updates on this exciting journey!\n\nThe Role of AI in the Production of \"Cosmic Companions\" https://lnkd.in/g5U2cbia \"As we venture into the making of 'Cosmic Companions,' embracing AI is not just an option; it's a strategic advantage. AI's integration into film production is transforming how we create, from pre-production through post-production. By leveraging AI, we aim to bring unprecedented innovation, efficiency, realism, and accessibility to 'Cosmic Companions,' ensuring that our film not only competes at the highest levels but also pushes the boundaries of what's possible in cinema.\" Benefits of AI in 'Cosmic Companions': Innovation: AI will allow us to create lifelike CGI characters and environments, providing a visual spectacle that tells our interstellar story more convincingly. These technological advancements will bring our creative vision to life with greater detail and imagination. Efficiency: AI streamlines our editing and post-production processes, significantly reducing the time from shooting to final cut. This efficiency cuts costs and allows our creative team to focus more on creative aspects rather than logistical complexities. Realism: With AI, 'Cosmic Companions' will feature stunningly realistic visual effects that immerse viewers completely. AI enhances not just the believability of our scenes but also enriches the storytelling, making every frame more impactful. Accessibility: AI tools democratize filmmaking, allowing us, an independent film team, to produce effects and polish that would typically require the budgets of major studios. This levels the playing field and brings high-quality cinematic experiences to broader audiences. Evolution: Embracing AI keeps our production contemporary and competitive. As the film industry evolves, staying ahead means adopting new technologies that keep the storytelling fresh and engaging. Countering Resistance to AI: Ignoring AI's potential leads to stagnation in creativity and production capabilities. Without AI, processes remain slower and more prone to errors, leading to delays and higher costs. Poor visual effects result in disbelief among audiences, undermining the cinematic experience. Lack of accessibility to advanced tools can exclude talented filmmakers with limited resources, leading to a less diverse industry. Failing to evolve with industry trends can render a film project obsolete even before its release. Conclusion: \"Embracing AI in the production of 'Cosmic Companions' is essential for delivering a film that is not only cutting-edge in terms of technology but also deeply human at its core. By integrating AI, we ensure that our film is a beacon of modern filmmaking, inviting viewers on a journey that's as emotionally engaging as it is visually spectacular. Let's not resist the future; let's define it.\" #IndieFilm, #SciFiMovies, #FilmMaking, or #Crowdfunding\n\nCurious about the future of AI in filmmaking? Let's dive in. The current buzz around two-minute videos by Sora, Runway, and a Chinese company is exciting. Here's what you need to know: ‚óâ These short videos showcase the potential of AI in creative fields. They are impressive and hint at what's possible. ‚óâ While a full 90-minute movie by AI isn't here yet, the progress is undeniable. Each step forward brings us closer to that reality. ‚óâ The collaboration between humans and AI is key. Combining human creativity with AI's capabilities can lead to groundbreaking results. ‚óâ The technology is evolving rapidly. What seems impossible today might be achievable sooner than we think. I think it will take as much as two years to get to the point of 100% AIM of 90 minutes, it may be possible if somebody will invent sort of a train of two minute or three minute videos, connecting and one with the other. At the end of the day, most movies are made from segments except that the segments can be much longer than the two minutes allowed today but if they will extend it to, let‚Äôs say five minutes, it would be much easier to actually come up with a full length movie. Alternatively, you can mix AI and real people in the same movie. With more info, contact filmAI.tech The possibilities are endless.\n\nMy latest AI ‚Äòexperiment‚Äô isn‚Äôt really an experiment but more a test of whether GenAI filmmaking be used successfully to help co-direct a PSA with Jason Zada and the fine folks at Secret Level. As Jason already posted this film let me add to the narrative around the piece. Like most PSAs it required quite a bit of donated time and effort on the talent collaborators involved and for me this is where the magic happens like a regular filmmaking process. Using AI allowed us to create way more set ups and scenes that would be have be available for our very small production budget (it‚Äôs a PSA after all). Process: We used Midjourney to create still images of areas of Los Angeles with levels of success and failure using local knowledge to help craft areas that weren‚Äôt available in stock libraries. This is where I think GenAI has it uses and value; a virtual location scout with camera tests is almost instant allowing us to ‚Äòpost visualize‚Äô the journey of our hero (the feather becoming a visual metaphor for hope expressed in the voice over) as it flys around LA. There‚Äôs plenty of glamorous neighborhood stock footage in Los Angeles but not much range in more nuanced and true to life scenes we prompted - the irony of this thought is not lost on me here‚Ä¶ These base plates and scenes - everything before the fence shot (excluding the Hollywood Sign plate that is a real shot) where then edited to ‚Äòvisually prompt the motion we wanted‚Äô and ran through Stability AI SVD1.1 video via ComfyUI and uprezzed via Topaz Labs Video tools to 1080p. We then ‚Äòcleaned up‚Äô and enhanced the using traditional 2D and 2.5D video workflow and tools and a ‚Äòtraditional CG‚Äô feather was added after our GenAI feather tests proved way to problematic for continuity. Still plenty of issues to iron out and optimize but GenAI in film production shows some promises if used to it‚Äôs strengths and weaknesses corrected just like any other toolset available. Is it a success? I‚Äôll let you be the judge and jury here. For me it continues to help me explore the right use of AI and leaning into where AI can assist and merge with the more established techniques and craftspeople."
