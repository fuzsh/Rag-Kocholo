        "text": "In his latest film, Filip Bajon transports us to early 20th century Kashubia. “Kamerdyner” takes place over four decades – from 1900 to 1945 – and tells a tragic love story set against the backdrop of European history. The film, whose script was inspired by the real lives of the German Pomeranian houses of von Belov and von Grass, stars Anna Radwan, Janusz Gajos, and Sebastian Fabijański. It is set to premiere in early 2018.\n\nDiana Dąbrowska: What was the most alluring thing about the screenplay for “Kamerdyner”? Why did you decide to direct this movie?\n\nFilip Bajon: I was approached by the producers, who appreciated the way I handled epic films. The first thing that convinced me to participate in this project was the fact that it fell within the scope of my interests: I have a whole shelf of books on East Prussia at home, I even once wrote a screenplay about Prussian Junkers and the famous Marion Dönhoff, known as the „Red Countess”. The other thing was that even though I consider myself to be an expert on the topic, I had not known the fact-based story told in “Kamerdyner” – it was a surprise to me. I was also attracted by the worldbuilding aspect: it is a tale about a land that is no more, so as a film director, I had to create it anew. Our story takes place against the backdrop of two world wars, a total reorganization of the world on a national, political, and even simply human level. If there’s a producer willing to financially support a production of such magnitude, it would be a sin not to seize this opportunity.\n\nHow did you reconstruct this bygone world? Where did you find the locations that would fit your vision of it?\n\nWe ended up shooting in Warmia, which is geographically very alike to East Prussia. When you pick up any book by Günter Grass, Arno Surminski, or any other German writer who wrote about Kashubia, you always come across the same image – one of a tree-lined road. These roads connect palaces spread out from each other. Lakeside villages of Warmia have to this day retained their original structure, described by Siegfried Lenz in his novel “The Heritage”. Importantly, the locations where we shot are still relatively devoid of signs of our times: contemporary architecture, power lines, etc. This made the filming process much easier. We have recently reached the halfway point.\n\nMeaning?\n\nWe’ve done thirty days of shooting. And still have 30 more ahead of us, including such vital scenes as the incorporation of Prussia into Poland, the construction of Gdynia, and elaborate hunting sequences. I refuse to make any compromises here. We’re not skimping on costumes, we have them brought in from London, from the famous Barrandov studio in Czechia, or from Babelsberg in Germany. We are also shooting on location in a real palace. When I first saw it, I thought: “This is all great, but we’ll have to cover up these radiators”. And then, surprise surprise, it turns out that they were part of the original design, and have been in operation since 1907.\n\nKnowing history is one thing, but in your previous films, you have shown time after time that you like to create your own visions of past events on screen.\n\nAs far as this creative approach is concerned, I like to go back to this anecdote from the premiere of one of my most important films – “When They Were Lads”. Much like Fellini in “Amarcord”, I told in it a story about past events through the lens of a child’s memories. Not everyone liked this approach, it particularly infuriated the people who participated in these events as adults. After the screening, I went to the toilet, where I overheard a conversation between two Poznanians. One of them, outraged, said: “But that’s not how it was!” To which the other one calmly replied: “But it could have been like that.” That’s my approach to the past. Potentiality is the key to original takes on historic events. In “Kamerdyner”, I added many secondary characters in order to broaden the spectrum of social, political, and religious commentary. Even though the film takes place in East Prussia, I tried to present a broader perspective, which is why, for example, I added a scene in which the Kashubian played by Janusz Gajos goes by horse to the Congress of Warsaw. It was also important for me to show how unique those times were through anecdotes. I really like the story about the guile of a certain officer from Königsberg who would go to horse races in Berlin with his superiors and, even though he never took the train, always arrived back in Königsberg ahead of them. It turned out that another, secret, faster train was also available, but even the commander didn’t know about it. In order to get a ticket, you had to travel with an animal, so the officer would always obtain a sheep or a goat, and thus make it back home before his friends.\n\nThis interweaving of various stories brings to mind “The Magnate”. Will “Kamerdyner” resemble that film in any way?\n\nNot necessarily. In “The Magnate” I told the story in a non-linear way, and in this case I went for continuity and simplicity. When I received the first draft of the screenplay, on which I had yet to put my own stamp, I decided that combining the interwoven stories of over a dozen people was challenging enough. There was no need to complicate the film further. In “Kamerynder” we follow the lives of a dozen people which sometimes run parallel to each other, at other times interlocking, looping around, diverging, and coming together again.\n\nWhat did you mean when you said that you put your own stamp on the script? Do you think all your films share some sort of instantly recognizable trademark?\n\nI think they all show history as being ironic, because when I reflect on the past, I am always reminded of this irony. Irony, in general, is a weapon that I couldn’t do without in the cinematic arena. I also think that – despite its epic nature – “Kamerdyner” will be a cool and somewhat detached film. It’s not an aesthetic choice that I’ve made, but rather a result of my desire to accurately depict complicated human relationships on screen. Irony amplifies critical thinking and lends itself to a certain detachment.\n\nDoes a grand epic narrative require an epic running time? The theatrical version of “The Magnate” was nearly three hours long.\n\nI follow the same formula I did with “The Magnate” or “The Spring to Come” – making six hours of material that will be shown on TV in six installments. The cinematic version will be 2+ hours long. This type of solution is not unusual for epic productions and works great, for example in France or Italy.\n\nCan we expect “Kamerdyner” to have a sequence to match the famous poppy scene from “The Magnate”?\n\nNo, that was a unique, once in a career sort of thing. While we were shooting it, no one in the crew, myself included, expected it to achieve such cult status. That’s part of its beauty. Which doesn’t mean that “Kamerdyner” won’t have eroticism or intensely present femininity. For example – the romantic plot involving the characters played by Sebastian Fabijański and Marianna Zydek. There’s a chance that they are stepsiblings, which introduces additional difficulties into their relationship. But despite this setback, their story is an optimistic one – unlike if, say, it was shot by Visconti, in whose films this topic is usually associated with ostracism and decay.\n\nSince we’re on the subject of actors, I remember that after the premiere of “Panie Dulskie” you said that you cast that movie in a dream. Was it also like that this time around?\n\nThis time I didn’t have a dream, but completing the principal cast turned out to be very easy. It only took a day. Interestingly, aside from Janusz Gajos, with whom I had worked before, I was also intent on casting Adam Woronowicz and Ania Radwan, with whom I had no previous professional dealings, but who I felt were literally the only right choices for these roles. My instinct didn’t fail me, they both did a great job and turned out to be the sort of people with whom you don’t need to talk much, but can instead get right down to business. The cast also includes such talented actors as Borys Szyc, Kamila Baar, Sławomir Fabijański, and Marianna Zydek. With the last two I had already worked on “Panie Dulskie”.\n\nPlease tell me about the main characters in “Kamerdyner”\n\nThe two main antagonists – Count Herman (Adam Woronowicz) and Bazyli Miotka (Janusz Gajos) are continuously fascinated with each other, though their relationship evolves: from friendship, through animosity, extreme hostility, and finally towards solidarity. Their complex dynamic is set against the backdrop of grand politics.\n\nWe also wanted to use the central conflict of “Kamerdyner” as an opportunity to set the story straight and debunk certain myths. In the Polish view of history there’s this conviction that wealthy Germans would buy land from peasants to – in keeping with Bismarck’s Kulturkampf – expand their estates at the expense of the Poles. Meanwhile, after a close study of historical sources it turns out that it was Poles, not Germans, who would make such purchases more often.\n\nWhy will the film be called “Kamerdyner” (The Butler)?\n\nThere are essentially two butlers on screen. The one played by Sebastian Fabijański is forced into this position, which is meant to humiliate him. But there’s also the second butler, played by Sławomir Orzechowski. When Nazis appear in the story, the other butler vanishes, but we have this sense like he’s still present. He is a “divine” butler, myth personified, whose metaphysical existence stands in stark contrast to the tangible presence of the man played by Fabijański.\n\nAre you able to watch films by other directors when you’re shooting your own, or preparing for a shoot?\n\nYes. I even made it into something of a ritual. For a while, no matter what type of film I was shooting, I would prepare by watching Coppola’s “Godfather 2” and Bertolucci’s “1900”. A while ago I modified this set. Before I started shooting “Kamerdyner”, I watched Jan Troell’s epic “Here’s Your Life” and Billy August’s “Pelle the Conqueror”.\n\n—Interview by Diana Dąbrowska (translated by Wojciech Góralczyk)"
