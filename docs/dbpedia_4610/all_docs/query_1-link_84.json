        "text": "Yohan is a devout young man who abides by his religious teachings. He attends church regularly and meets with the other parishioners. One day, a newcomer named Juwon joins his congregation. This new church member is friendly and loves to smile. He makes eye contact with Yohan, and their gazes lock for a moment. Yohan immediately feels self-conscious and looks down at his bible.\n\nYohan invites several congregates to his home for a bible study. Juwon joins the meeting. As they sit down to chat, one of the female members discusses feeling troubled by her lesbian friend. She states it's a sin according to the bible. Juwon offers his personal interpretation and claims they're all sinners. As he says this, Juwon makes eye contact with Yohan. However, Yohan remains silent during this exchange and doesn't contribute to the debate. That night, he struggles to fall asleep.\n\nYohan attends church. After praying, Yohan wanders around the building and makes a startling discovery. He sees Juwon in the washroom, getting intimate with another church member. Yohan quickly scurries away. Later, Juwon initiates a conversation between them. Juwon grabs Yohan's hand and tells him, \"When I look into someone's eyes, I can tell what they're thinking.\" Yohan doesn't respond to his cryptic message and leaves in a hurry.\n\nThe two men meet again in private. Juwon makes an unannounced visit to Yohan's apartment, claiming he left behind his bible last time. With a solemn expression, Yohan invites his acquaintance inside his home. Juwon makes himself comfortable and begins his seduction.\n\nIn Original Sin, the protagonist struggles between his religious faith and his sexual desires. The story begins with him on his knees, contemplating a biblical passage about sin. We don't know his circumstances yet. However, we can tell there's a heavy burden weighing on his mind. This brief opening scene sets the melancholic tone for the rest of the narrative. Original Sin is a sombre film that takes the viewers on a harrowing journey into one man's inner turmoil.\n\nThe \"sin\" part of the movie's title refers to Yohan's complicated feelings about his sexuality. His same-sex attraction is at odds with the church's teachings. From his perspective, being devout and being gay are incompatible. By lusting for another man, Yohan fears he puts his own wants before the Lord's doctrine. Unfortunately, Juwon's arrival presents an irresistible temptation. Yohan grows flustered around his new acquaintance, who senses his self-loathing. \"You're lying,\" Juwon tells him during a cryptic exchange. \"When I look into your eyes, I can see what you're thinking.\"\n\nOriginal Sin is twenty minutes long, but this movie manages its time wisely. It quickly introduces the leads and develops their sexual tension. I like how it uses subtle cues to convey the storytelling. For example, Yuhon shaves before Juwon's visit, suggesting he wants to look attractive for his love interest. In another scene, Yuhon can't sleep after the bible study since he's tormented by the earlier chat about sinners. Although these scenes only last a few seconds, they have covert meanings. Original Sin trusts the viewers to deduce the symbolism and fill in the blanks.\n\nThe romance is intriguing due to its ambiguity. Although the movie highlights that Yohan is drawn to Juwon, we don't know how either would respond. Yohan appears repressed over his sexuality and won't confront his feelings for another man. Meanwhile, Juwon is a mysterious love interest whose motives and sexual orientation remain vague. As the characters navigate their feelings, every intimate moment becomes riveting. What are the leads thinking? How will they behave? Their relationship culminates in a thrilling climax that will leave you scandalized.\n\nOriginal Sin is a plain-looking project that doesn't have the best production values. Its cinematography appears unimpressive, diminishing the romantic passion instead of amplifying it. This movie is missing a level of polish you'd expect in more professional BL dramas, from the camera placement to the lighting conditions. It tends to film in dark settings, so the visuals have a dull, dingy feel. Regardless, the two leads (Oh Dong Joon & Han Hyun Jun) still shine with their solid acting performances. They portray their roles with emotional nuance and sensitivity.\n\nOriginal Sin is too short and doesn't create a lasting impact. I'm interested in the plot, the characters, and their sexual tension. However, the movie's length prevents it from exploring the themes thoroughly. Although I sympathize with Yohan's predicament, my attachment develops as much as twenty minutes will allow. Ultimately, this film feels more like a quick anecdote than an intricate story. With more time, Original Sin could've delivered a poignant examination of sexuality and religion. In its current state, the skeletal narrative leaves me praying for more content."
