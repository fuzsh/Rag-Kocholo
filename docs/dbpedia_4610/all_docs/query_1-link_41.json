        "text": "'A Story of Sin' is an attempt at a reconstruction of Surrealist traditions in Polish cinema. The book reveals the repressed, obscure and alternative aspects of Polish cinematography by providing an invaluable guide to the Surrealistic 'terra incognita' whose outline authors recognise in films by Wojciech Jerzy Has, Walerian Borowczyk, Andrzej Zulawski, Roman Polanski, Jan Lenica, Piotr Szulkin, Grzegorz Krolikiewicz, Tadeusz Konwicki and others. Can Surrealist tradition provide an inspiring alternative to realism in Polish cinematography? What are the features specific to Polish Surrealism; how should it be placed in a cultural and socio-political context, bearing in mind strong Romantic traditions, Catholicism, and the experiences from the Communist era?
