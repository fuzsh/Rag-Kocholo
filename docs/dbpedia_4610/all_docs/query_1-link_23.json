        "text": "Infuriating, provocative, perplexing and inpenetrable, Wojciech Has’s phantasmagoric meta-cinematic orgy comprises stark visual symbolism, Daedalian surrealism and some of the most (architecturally) awe-inspiring and unimaginably detailed mise en scène in Polish cinema history.\n\nThe film itself is admittably difficult to get into, as it constantly throws you off track with its insouciant narrative, infinite(ly) subtle twists and illogical violations of time and space, while compulsively toying with memory, fantasy and reality, as if they all bridged on the same plane of existence. The film itself unfolds like a manuscript, peeling back the page, as it overflows with new ideas, characters and landscapes, merging information and misinformation, emotion and indifference, ultimately assigning the (in)patient viewer the final role of inspector and voyeur – allowing them to investigate, experience and indulge, before critcizing this same voyeuristic inclination.\n\nWhilst difficult to fully dissect on a first viewing, Rekopis znaleziony w Saragossi (The Saragossa Manuscript) is nonetheless a visual and aural feast, equally enlightening and disconcerting for both the mind and the senses, and it is a metacinematic piece that definitely needs to be revisited to be appreciated!\n\n”This is one mother of a film.” -David Lynch\n\nI am still trying to find the right words to express how I feel about Ryszard Bugajski’s Przesluchanie (Interrogation) – the deep-founded emotions and observations it drew out of me, and the tremendous, almost unbearably painful (psychological), weight of its heavy subject matter. It is perhaps one of the most psychologically penetrating films I have ever seen, peeling back every layer of the human condition to expose the ineffable dogmatism of a totalitarianist regime and its impact on human (individual and collective) identity, and everything else that lies underneath, in the very bedrock of our humanity.\n\nIn the end what remains is not any vitriolic judgement of human nature, but simple, incisive observation. The film itself often reveals our own judgemental nature, exposing us in our most hideous and beautiful forms throughout, pointing the finger back at us directly, and reminding us – through its evocative, and tantalizing imagery – how we are all human, and the message could never be more clear. I even daresay the visceral, psychological impact of Bugajski’s film exceeds that of Idi i Smotri (Come and See), and this should give you at least some incentive to see it, if you are not already convinced.\n\nIt is absolutely atrocious, and almost laughable, that this film lost the Palme d’Or to Wild at Heart in 1990 and has gone unnoticed for so long. Although I am still trying to recover from the inexpressible, psychological impact of this film, and intend to write a wholly thorough critique in the future, for now all I want to say is that again – I cannot recommend the film highly enough!\n\nWalerian Borowzcyk’s Dzieje grzechu (The Story of Sin) mixes subtle symbolism, religious motifs and social commentary with naturalistic performances, piercing classical music, and an unnerving air of sexual euphoria and explicit violence providing a jarring insight into a sinful existence, void of virtue and grace.\n\nBorowzcyk presents us with an existentialist dilemma from the opening scene during which a woman, Ewa confesses her sins to a priest, and also begs for his advice. He responds by explaining to her the nature of sin and the virtues she must uphold in order to purify her soul and evade a sinful, meaningless existence. The rest of the film follows Ewa’s harrowing transformation as she abandons all sense of morality and virtue, and descends into adultery, prostitution and murder.\n\nThe whole affair is excruciatingly painful to watch but Borowzcyk effectively captures this spectator response through a rape sequence which culminates in the shot of an angelic statute (comprised of an innocent, child-like stature). The angel sits with his head facing downwards, his hands covering his eyes emulating not only the profound sense of sadness and pain the spectator similarly experiences, but a sense of disappointment in a person’s self-inflicted downfall from achieving grace – like the angel that became the devil, from vanity and the inability to love. The angel statue does not look away symbolically because he is judging our sinful existence but rather our sin – spiritually and physically – turns us away from God. We reject his love and this in itself separates us from him, which is something even the angel cannot stand to bear witness to. The film’s opening discussion thus can be seen as serving as a direct antithesis to the violent imagery and corrupt ideology that follow – viciously overtaking the narrative, and engulfing its characters in the process.\n\nThis absurdist piece of cinema possesses raw and poetic imagery, challenging its spectator every step of the way, with an unflinching grasp of humanity’s frailty, and tendency to commit sin. This treatment can however become somewhat monotonous – tonally – throughout, unchanging in narrative and frequently lacking development with its side characters who remain generally one-note. Additionally, its perspective on human existence (through the exploration of sin) often falls short thematically, with existential concepts remaining underexplored, because no contrast is given to the misery the main character experiences – no significant deeper questions or solutions are (pro)posed. Nonetheless Dzieje grzechu remains a daringly poetic work that works as an apt introduction into the mind of Walerian Borowczyk, whose filmography I highly anticipate exploring.\n\nNiewinni czarodzieje (Innocent Sorcerers) is a searing social satire, and remarkable achievement from Polish auteur Andrzej Wajda.\n\nIts ethereal black-and-white cinematography conjures up an uncannily dreamlike world within which youth culture, entertainment and sexual fantasies and delusions are equally realized and nullified. The characters are poetic realizations of a timeless youth whose insubordance, hopefulness and free-minded philosophy ultimately guides them. An older man in the film attacks the film’s central couple saying ”Oh, youth, give me thy wings” and when they ignore him, he proceeds to beg them to kill him.\n\nNow although I’m not completely well versed in the socio-historical context of ’60’s Poland, Wajda’s criticism of the impact of the 1956 Polish spring on the then-contemporary political realities remains clear. Youth is here not merely symbolic of liberalization and free spirted thinking but acts as a rejection to conformity and ideological affinity, and the conservative methods of the Communist regime. The film’s jazz score works wonders in further shaping this temporal landscape, and creating a nostalgic portrayal of adolescence, with a wistful saxophone (or piano) melody playing faintly throughout.\n\nWajda’s underestimated master-work remains one of the most delicate visual poetries of ’60’s cinema and a metaphorical pre-cursor to the hypercharged sexual revolution to come. I may even prefer it over Ashes and Diamonds. Highly recommended!"
