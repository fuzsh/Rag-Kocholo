        "text": "Class with Claudia Mattos Avolese on Brazilian Indigenous Art, MCH G-10, 9:35 AM-10:55 AM\n\nFebruary 9, 2024\n\nÍNDIO PRESENTE”: Indigenous self-representation in the arts of Brazil\n\nThis class will discuss the emergence of Indigenous self-representation in the arts of Brazil, with special focus on the last decade. It will look at landmark exhibitions and closely examine the recent works of Indigenous artists active in the national and international art scene today. The class will also discuss the challenges of producing art from the border space between cultures inhabited by these artists. Denilson Baniwa, Natureza Morta (Still-life/Dead Nature), Digital print, 2017.\n\nYou can access the recommended readings here and here.\n\nFruits of Labor\n\nFebruary 17, 2022\n\nJoin us for a virtual Screening and discussion of \"Fruits of Labor\"\n\n5-7 p.m. Feb 17, Zoom\n\nFilmmaker Emily Cohen Ibañez will be present for a Q&A Conversation after the film.\n\n\"Fruits of Labor\" follows Ashley, the film's protagonist and co-writer, a Mexican-American teenager who dreams of graduating high school and going to college. But when ICE raids threaten her family, Ashley is forced to become the breadwinner, working days in the strawberry fields and nights in a food processing factory. \"Fruits of Labor\" is a coming of age story about an American teenager traversing the seen and unseen forces that keep her family trapped in poverty.\n\nUnder the Skin: a workshop of a new play\n\nOctober 19, 2021\n\nTuesday, Oct. 19, 2021\n\nNoon-1:30 p.m., Zoom\n\nPlease join the minor in Creativity, the Arts, and Social Transformation (CAST), Hispanic Studies, Latin American, Caribbean and Latinx Studies (LACLS), and Theater Arts, for an online workshop of \"Under the Skin,\" a new one-person play about the artist and human rights activist Claudia Bernardi’s life growing up in Argentina under a military junta, and her subsequent work digging up the past. This presentation is hosted by Professor María J. Durán as part of her course, Latinx Theatre: Politics, Performance, and Social Change and is funded in part by the Dean's Research Fund.\n\n\"Under the Skin\"\n\nA new play by award-winning playwright Catherine Filloux\n\nPerformed by Mercedes Herrero\n\nDirected by Elena Araoz\n\nCommissioned by INTAR (Lou Moreno, Artistic Director; Paul Slee Rodriquez, Executive Director)\n\nAfter the workshop, Claudia Bernardi and Catherine Filloux will join us online for a discussion.\n\nPerforming Indigenous Blackness: Ancestral Memory in the Garifuna Diaspora\n\nApril 12, 2021\n\nPaul Joseph López Oro, Smith College\n\n4-5:30 p.m.\n\nAncestral memory is conjured, performed, and reenacted in multiple spaces and times in the Garifuna diaspora. Garifuna peoples are descendants of shipwrecked enslaved West Africans and Carib Arawak Indians on the lesser Antillean island of St. Vincent. Their exile by British colonial powers in 1797 from St. Vincent to the Bay Islands of Honduras marks a collective nostalgia of arrival memorialized and invoked as an act of resistance to enslavement and European colonial governance. Garifuna Settlement Day marks this arrival to Central America’s Caribbean Coast as one of ancestral exile, maroonage, and history of cultural survival. In this chapter, I turn to ancestral memory as an embodied archive performed to conjure a past in the present to reenact marronage and survival.\n\nIn conversation with the works of M. Jacqui Alexander, LeRhonda S. Manigault-Bryant, and Omise’ke Natasha Tinsley, I closely examine the sacredness and spirituality of memory as a manifestation of ancestral presence onto and through the flesh in the public spaces of Garifuna Settlement Day, visual mediums of films such as El Espíritu de mi Mamá (1999) and Garifuna in Peril (2011), and digital spaces of Twitter #GarifunaTwitter, Facebook, and YouTube as multi-sited spaces of embodied archives of Garifunaness.\n\nPaul Joseph López Oro is an Assistant Professor of Africana Studies at Smith College. His research and teaching interests are on AfroLatinidades in the Américas, specifically on Black Central Americans in the United States, by closely examining hemispheric political mobilizations of Garifuna New Yorkers and by engaging with Black Feminist Queer theory & ethnography, he argues that queer politics are at the center of how and why Garifuna New Yorkers perform, articulate, and mobilize their multiple subjectivities as Black, Indigenous, and Latinx.\n\nCo-Sponsored by:\n\nThe Latin American and Latino Studies Program\n\nThe Department of African and African-American Studies\n\nThe Department of Women's, Gender and Sexuality Studies\n\nThe Department of Anthropology\n\nHello I am Kitty\n\nApril 12, 2021\n\nJoanaToro\n\n2-3:30 p.m.\n\nBeing an immigrant is an enormous challenge, this book provokes a reflection on the status of Latin immigrants in the U.S., their cultural appropriation and new identities, ironies of immigrant life on the margins of a globalized world.\n\n“Hello I am Kitty” is the result of a personal journal to find my new “identity” viewing right through an eye hole in the head of my Hello Kitty costume while I asked for donations after posing for pictures in Times Square between 2012-13.\n\nThe phenomenon of Latino immigration is a cultural issue of social appropriation, in which symbols play an integral role in generating images and self-images of Latinos in a society that is itself globalized. This project challenges symbols and misconceptions about Latino immigrants.\n\nApril 8, 2021\n\n7 p.m.\n\nUndocumented immigrants in the United States who engage in social activism do so at great risk: the threat of deportation. In \"Organizing While Undocumented,\" Kevin Escudero shows why and how — despite this risk — many of them bravely continue to fight on the front lines for their rights. Drawing on more than five years of research, including interviews with undocumented youth organizers, Escudero focuses on the movement’s epicenters — San Francisco, Chicago, and New York City — to explain the impressive political success of the undocumented immigrant community. He shows how their identities as undocumented immigrants, but also as queer individuals, people of color, and women, connect their efforts to broader social justice struggles today."
