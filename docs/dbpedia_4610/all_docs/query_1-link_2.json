You can install the BrowZine app and create a custom Bookshelf of your favorite journal titles. Then you will get the Table of Contents (ToCs) of your favorite journals automatically delivered to you when they become available. Once you have the ToC's you can download and read the articles you want.\n\nYou can get the app from the App Store or Google Play.\n\nDon't own or use a mobile device? You can still use BrowZine! It's now available in a web version. You can get to it here. The web version works the same way as the app version. Find the journals you like, create a custom Bookshelf, get ToCs and read the articles you want.\n\nAmong the earliest Polish feature films were Antos po raz pierwszy w Warszawie/Anthony’s First Trip to Warsaw (Josef Meyer, 1908) and Dzieje grzechu/The History of Sin (Antoni Bednarczyk, 1911). At the outbreak of World War I there were over 300 cinemas in Poland, and production companies such as Sfinks, headed by Alexander Hertz, had released some fifty full-length features and 350 shorts (fiction, newsreel, and documentaries). A hiatus in the postwar period, with US imports dominating, was followed by a rise in production in the 1930s, with fourteen films per year in 1932–4 rising to between twenty-three and twenty-six annually in 1936–8. Pola Negri was Poland’s best-known film star during this period. Popular genres included literary adaptations, comedy, history films, social problem films, and a number of early synchronized sound films drawing on Poland’s rich cabaret tradition. Director Michał Waszyński (see yiddish cinema) made forty-one feature films between 1929 and 1941, while the films of Józef Lejtes garnered international critical acclaim. ...\n\nKuhn, A., & Westwell, G.
