        "text": "09/10/2018 - Cineuropa chatted to Wojciech Smarzowski, the director of Clergy, which has just enjoyed a record-breaking opening in Polish cinemas\n\nPolish director Wojciech Smarzowski’s latest film, Clergy , enjoyed a record-breaking opening in Poland, racking up almost one million ticket sales straight away, and now, ten days since the premiere, it has 2.5 million admissions on the clock. We spoke to Smarzowski to find out more about the hit movie.\n\nCineuropa: Clergy is a film about the sins committed by the Catholic Church in Poland. It deals with paedophilia, corruption, alcoholism, unfairness and vanity, and it had a record-breaking opening in Poland, a result that is out of reach even for rom-coms and adventure films. How do you explain this result?\n\nWojciech Smarzowski: I think that divine providence is on my side [laughs], and many external factors resulted in the commercial success of the film. I guess the most important factor is that I am not the only person in Poland who is disturbed by the fact that the Church is above the law. While preparing a film, I always start with an issue; I never think about whether the subject I have picked will be popular with the audience. I make films the best way I possibly can, and I believe that apart from focusing on a hot topic, it’s also a very well-made piece of cinema that has a moving story, credible characters and, most importantly, emotions.\n\nThe protagonists of the film are three priests, and each faces a different sin committed by the Church. In the script you wrote with Wojciech Rzehak, were these characters based on real-life priests?\n\nAll of the characters in the film are fictional, but their core is taken from real life. The resemblance was so strong that the priests who watched early edits of the film recognised the actual clergymen. Naturally, the story is more compact – that is the advantage of fiction – but what we really cared about was showing the extent of the depravity in the Polish Church. In order to present that institution and its mechanisms from the inside, we had to place the camera in a curia, in a modest parish, and in a prosperous one in a medium-sized city. That necessitated three plot lines and three protagonists, supported by the character of the archbishop.\n\nDid Polish Catholic priests help you in your research for the film or did you consult them? Have they watched Clergy?\n\nYes, I consulted priests and former priests, who aided us at every stage of the production. They helped me with the script, the choice of locations, the costumes, the on-set work and, later, the editing process. Those who want change in the Church shared their experiences and their observations. They liked the film and considered it to be Christian, and they said it didn’t insult the Christian faith, but rather showed a corporation. I once joked in an interview about how I could start Clergy 2; then, Wojciech and I independently received several offers to meet a number of priests we hadn’t met before, who were willing to provide us with information about the faults of the Church that weren’t presented in our film.\n\nClergy and your previous movies Hatred and Rose were the first Polish films to touch on these particular thorny issues. Why do you choose such topics, and how does entering these dark places change you?\n\nI make films about what causes me pain, about what was forgotten or – as in the case of Clergy – hidden. I always suffer most during the initial stages of preparations for the film, while reading and hearing stories of the people who were wronged – Masurians who were raped in the case of Rose, the survivors from Volhynia for Hatred, and for Clergy, this handful of people who decided to talk about being molested by paedophiles in the Church. My films are dark, but trust me: I make them so that the world will become a better place."
