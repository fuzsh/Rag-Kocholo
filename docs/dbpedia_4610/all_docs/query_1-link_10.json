        "text": "By the time of his third Polish feature, On the Silver Globe (Na srebrnym globie, 1977/1988), Żuławski could not have been further removed from the dominant tendencies towards realism evidenced by the “Cinema of Moral Concern”, of which he was a particularly severe critic. Eventually production was halted on the film and was only able to be resumed, in a truncated form, eleven years later. Meanwhile the director had initiated another series of films made in France, beginning with L’important c’est d’aimer (The Most Important Thing: Love, 1975), which while aesthetically and contextually very different, nevertheless can be seen as a continuation of and development of this critical escape in the necessarily transnational context of making films in another European country. This chapter examines these two strands of his cinematic career as related attempts to escape the limits of “moral realism” via expressive excess and argue that from the start this trajectory had transnational dimensions. Even in the case of productions taking place entirely within Poland, the films of Żuławski can be productively seen in terms of “accented cinema”, to use Hamid Naficy’s term, in that they transgress the borders of Polish national cinema, even if this is as much in stylistic as geographical terms or refers as much to internal as external exile. This chapter will therefore examine key films of this director, both those made in Poland and abroad as strategies against and beyond the dominant aesthetic and political tendencies of Polish cinema.\n\nThis article examines Bataille’s philosophy of art apropos of his express writings on literature. The aim is to see what program Bataille can offer for an aesthetics in terms of future writings of artistic works including “the novel,” which Bataille also wrote himself. First it discusses Bataille’s 1949 article “Happiness, Eroticism, and Literature,” which posits literature as a quest for happiness, and compares this with his 1957 Literature and Evil which posits it, rather, as a quest for “Evil.” Then it explores Bataille’s writings on poetry, which invoke it as a way to smash through the rut prose literature falls into, in order to attain a more immediate experience. Finally, it turns to the need for separation Bataille posits between the poetic and rational that must also be a path between the two – and argues that a clarity of consciousness of these two distinct but related realms would constitute Bataille’s directive for future novels: to help us think within the real of their experience.\n\nIn this article I consider how the erotics of the real, of Bataille, might contribute to the ethics of the real, of Lacan, and also to the genealogy of morals disclosed by Nietzsche. Bataille was a key intellectual figure in twentieth-century Paris, closely associated with the initial inspiration of French Nietzscheanism and personally connected with Lacan, the “French Freud.” Bataille’s work can even be viewed as a unique synthesis of the Dionysian wisdom of Nietzsche’s philosophy and the growing awareness of the sexual real made possible by the pioneering works of Freud. Combining Bataille’s anthropological understanding of a taboo-transgression correlation with Lacan’s analytic episteme of the real, symbolic, and imaginary, I trace a recessive loss of the erotic function of religion, ethics, and the sacred through the Platonic, Christian, and Modern Science epochs that Nietzsche’s revaluations of the Good also tend to centre on. I suggest that an ethics of the real, of unconscious desire as a configuration of the drives, can be better served by restoring a living openness to the originary erotics observable in the culture of pre-Platonic Greeks. This erotics manifests most famously perhaps in their polymorphous libidinal structures, their stories of the gods, and the festivals of Dionysos to host the works of their greatest tragic poets. What emerges from this extended genealogical analysis is an understanding of why the brothels of Paris, for instance, can become for Bataille true churches again.\n\nThe career of British director Peter Greenaway, now more than four decades long, has often been animated by a profound interest in what one may call the aesthetics of death. This is particularly true for his 80s and 90s films, which explore a wide array of strategies for the staging and ritualization of death. In “The Cook, the Thief, his Wife & Her Lover” (1989), for the first time, this interest takes Greenaway into the territories of the tragic. I propose to rethink the fundamental relationship that Greenaway’s film entertains with the narrative and aesthetic forms of the tragic. More precisely, I suggest to interpret The Cook in the light of the reflections on the Trauerspiel (mourning-play) that Walter Benjamin elaborates in “The Origin of German Tragic Drama” [Ursprung des deutschen Trauerspiels]. After giving a short account of the first macro-section of Benjamin’s essay, I will argue that the opposition between the Thief and the Lover mirrors the Trauerspiel’s opposition between Tyrant and Martyr, that Benjamin regards as one of the conceptual cores of this theatrical form. This, in turn, reflects the presence in the film of a more abstract conflict between two systems for the construction of knowledge and experience. By drawing on Benjamin’s study, I will trace this conflict back to the opposition between nature and books in baroque culture. The battle between the Thief/Tyrant and the Lover/Martyr takes the form of a succession of rites and counter-rites for the (un)making of social bonds, and the film constructs these rites by clearly referring to the Christian imagination and its subversion. I will contend that the motif of the subversion of the Holy Communion can provide us with a unifying key for the interpretation of the film. From a semiotic perspective, this manipulation consists in the substitution of what our culture constructs as food with its dysphoric counterparts: decay, excrement, and human flesh.\n\nThe article employs categories of post-colonialism to examine two novels by Henryk Sienkiewicz, With Fire and Sword and Fire in the Steppe, and their filmic adaptations by Jerzy Hoffman in order to reconstruct their ideological discourse regarding Polish national identity and its positioning within Europe. Located between East and West, Poland was both a colonizing power (of Ukraine, Lithuania, and Belorussia) and a colonized country (by Russia, Prussia, and Austro-Hungary). The novels of the cycle, written during the time of partitions, offer a nostalgic vision of the country’s past power and its colonizing aspirations. The author argues that various textual efforts aimed at solidifying the notion of national identity and its positioning within a geopolitical order of Europe are disrupted by structures of female desire implicitly present in both the novels and films. These structures puncture the solid fabric of the national historical epic and undermine the hegemonic notion of Polish masculinity."
