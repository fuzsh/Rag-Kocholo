Carlos, the ’scope telefilm directed by Olivier Assayas, from a script co-written with Dan Franck, gives Ilich Ramírez Sánchez, aka “Carlos the Jackal,” his cinematic apotheosis.

Read more…\n\nOn Soundies [nybooks.com] “Soundies”—the three-minute musical films made for a bare six years in the 1940s and shown in bars, taverns, and bus stations—are relics of relics. On the one hand, they belong to the century-plus process by which motion pictures traveled from big to little screens and from theaters into life. On the other, they are social hieroglyphs. Read more…\n\nOn Up Against the Real [Artforum] There are many paths through the radical arts of the 1960s. Nadja Millner-Larsen’s Up Against the Real: Black Mask from Art to Action takes one back alley and turns it into a bustling boulevard.

One quaint and underappreciated precursor to the information highway was the underground press that proliferated during the late 1960s. The medium was never more the message. Read more...\n\nOn the 100 Most Significant Political Films of All Time [The New Republic] Polls gauge public opinion. So do movies. Seventy-nine expert witnesses—film critics, programmers, and academics—named their candidates for the most significant political movies of the past 120 years, listing a combined total of over 450 individual films. Gillo Pontecorvo’s The Battle of Algiers (1966) won … by a lot. What did we learn? Read more…\n\nRemembering Kenneth Anger [artforum.com] Kenneth Anger was an audacious filmmaker, a self-proclaimed magus, a never-closeted queer, a shameless scandalmonger, a sometime Satanist, a difficult person, and, as P. Adams Sitney put it, the “conscious artificer of his own myth.” He was also the King of Pop—at least that’s what I thought on first seeing Scorpio Rising (1963) in the mid-1960s, age sixteen, at New York’s Museum of Modern Art. Read more…\n\nOn Unrest [The Nation] Cyril Schäublin’s Unrest may be the most orderly movie about anarchists ever made. That is part of the point.

Read more…\n\nRemembering Michael Snow [New York Times]: Michael Snow, a Canadian painter, jazz pianist, photographer, sculptor and filmmaker best known for “Wavelength” — a humble, relentless, more or less continuous zoom shot that traverses a Lower Manhattan loft into a photograph pasted on its far wall — died on Thursday in Toronto. He was 94.

She was 76. Read more…\n\nOn Radu Jude’s Potemkinists [Artforum online] A Romanian filmmaker who regularly deflates Romanian myths of national greatness, Radu Jude recently graced the New York Film Festival with a compact, farcical essay on the material basis of historical memory, or, to use Trotsky’s term, “the dustbin of history.” Read more…\n\nRemembering Jean Luc Godard [The Nation] “Godard didn’t make cinema. Godard was cinema.” So said some French dignitary (was it Macron or his tweeters?) when the news broke last Tuesday morning, September 13, that Jean-Luc Godard est mort. Read more…\n\nOn Diane Arbus (and Susan Sontag) [Tablet.com] “Go in for the kill” is an expression I’ve heard photojournalists use. To me, it suggests that their art requires a skill akin to bullfighting. Still, it’s a truism that the camera can be “a weapon of aggression.” So it was described by Susan Sontag in her ferocious takedown of the recently deceased photographer Diane Arbus, first published in The New York Review of Books in 1973 under the headline “Freak Show.” Read more…\n\nOn the Jewish Museum show “NYC 1962-64” [NYR.com] The Jewish Museum’s current show, New York: 1962–1964, is nostalgic not so much for the early Sixties as for a time when, with the art market booming and experimentation in full flower, it seemed that the New York of the Sixties was a sequel to the Paris of the Twenties.

These are questions that Sergei Loznitsa’s new documentary, Babi Yar. Context, asks the viewer as well as itself. Read more…\n\nOn Radu Jude’s Bad Luck Banging [NYRB] Bad Luck Banging, or Loony Porn, the Romanian director Radu Jude’s exuberantly rude and bawdy new film, is a movie about us. Or rather, it’s a comedy about our world: how we live under surveillance, with diminished boundaries, plagued by conspiratorial thinking and multiple pandemics—virtual as well as actual. Read more…\n\nOn Todd Haynes’s The Velvet Underground [Tablet.com] “It is said that nowhere in the world are so many people crowded together on a square mile as here.” So Jacob Riis wrote of the lower Manhattan neighborhood he called “Jewtown,” noting that “the average five-story tenement adds a story or two to its stature in Ludlow Street.” Read more…\n\nOn Pulp Empire [The Nation] Blame the comic book. Cheap and transportable, a trove of infantile fantasy and psychosexual Pop Art, often spiced with egregious stereotypes and nativist aggression, this humble medium was for a time the United States’ most ubiquitous cultural ambassador. Such is the thesis of Paul S. Hirsch’s Pulp Empire: The Secret History of Comic Book Imperialism, an engaging account of the ways in which comics variously served or confounded official interests.

Trump is not the first professional entertainer or pitchman to be elected president of the United States but, however he may refuse to break character or take an adjustment, he is not Ronald Reagan.

So declared the philosopher Theodor Adorno in the last paragraph of his 1951 essay “Cultural Criticism and Society.” The line is surely Adorno’s most notorious utterance, and also, yanked from its original context, his most misunderstood.

Read more…\n\nOn David Dufresne’s Monopoly of Violence [Artforum.com] Essentially a vehicle or solo performance, TikTok can make individual careers, but the humble Facebook-Twitter-YouTube ecosystem—identified by the British filmmaker Peter Snowdon as the vehicle for “vernacular video”—can make history. Read more…\n\nOn Alice Neel [The Point.com] Alice Neel is generally thought to be twentieth-century America’s greatest portraitist—an assessment she would likely have rejected as too restrictive. Given her status, it’s little wonder that “Alice Neel: People Come First,” on view at New York’s Metropolitan Museum of Art through July, may be the most enthusiastically received and is certainly most aptly named exhibition in the Met’s recent history.

He was 90.

Read more…\n\nOn The Spook Who Sat By the Door [New York Times] There are movies whose back stories and reception histories are as compelling as the movies themselves. “The Spook Who Sat by the Door” is one. Read more…\n\nOn Predicting the Past [NYRB Daily] An artist is a person who invents an artist. So it has been said, neither by Marcel Duchamp nor by Jorge Luis Borges, but by Harold Rosenberg, the critic who invented a school of painting when he coined the term “action art.”The American photographer Stephen Berkman could be said to have taken Rosenberg literally. Two decades in the making, Berkman’s huge new book, Predicting the Past: Zohar Studios the Lost Years invents, creates, and explicates an artistic oeuvre—in this case, one that purportedly belonging to a nineteenth-century studio photographer named Shimmel Zohar.

Read more…\n\nOn Camus’s The Plague and Kazan’s Panic in the Streets [Paris Review] The plague that gave Albert Camus’s novel its title is the plague but it is also, as Stephen Spender put it in his 1948 New York Times review, a “Social Catastrophe.” In that sense, The Plague is a political allegory with a large cast of quasi-allegorical characters—the perfect prototype for a disaster movie.

Read more…\n\nOn Joker [Tablet] Every four years or so, typically around the time of a presidential election, a genre flick storms the zeitgeist with the force of its social metaphor. In 1969 it was Night of the Living Dead; in 1972, The Godfather. Rocky (1976), Ghostbusters (1984), The Matrix (1999), and The Passion of the Christ (2004) are other examples. So is Joker, Todd Phillips’ Oscar-nominated addition to the Batman mythos, with Joaquin Phoenix, also up for an Oscar, in the title role.

Two years later, in 1966, Czech director Věra Chytilová and screenwriter–production designer Ester Krumbachová debuted a sort of cinematic version of Sontag’s call to arms. Read more…\n\nOn Steve Bannon in the movies [Tablet] Clint Eastwood was “The Man with No Name,” Steve Martin played “The Man with Two Brains,” but alt-right rogue Stephen K. Bannon—the subject and star of two new documentaries—is “The Man with Two Shirts.” Read more…\n\nOn László Nemes’s Sunset [NYRB Daily] Sunset, the forty-two-year-old French-Hungarian filmmaker László Nemes’s follow-up to his astonishing 2015 debutSon of Saul, is a gothic melodrama and a modernist period piece that, set on the eve of World War I and shadowed by impending doom, might be called “Mysteries of Budapest” or even, after Arthur Schnitzler’s 1926 novella, “Dream Story.” Read more…\n\nOn Dusan Makavejev [Tablet] Three titans of the ’60s counterculture died within two weeks this past January: Jonas Mekas, the main force behind the New American Cinema, aka underground movies; Izzy Young, the original folkie and prime organizer of the Greenwich Village folk revival; and Dušan Makavejev, the taboo-busting Yugoslav filmmaker who made the quintessential counterculture film WR: Mysteries of the Organism.

This 13-episode examination of ancient Greece’s contribution to the modern world is at once illuminating and confounding, heady but playful.

Zionism was a utopian project first imagined by writers— Theodor Herzl, Max Nordau, Israel Zangwill, and Ze’ev Jabotinsky among them. As that thought experiment was early realized in Herzl’s 1902 novel, Altneuland, so the activist-artist Yael Bartana, born in a moshav ovdim in northern Israel, willed into existence a reverse (or perhaps alt) Zionism with her video trilogy, And Europe Will Be Stunned—namely the not quite fictitious or entirely ironic Jewish Renaissance Movement in Poland.

If you were an American kid during the season in which 15-year-old Christine Blasey encountered 17-year-old Brett “Bart” Kavanaugh and Mark Judge, you and your parents undoubtably saw E.T. If you had (or were) a hip older sibling, you might have caught the more complicated Blade Runner. But if you were a brewski-chugging body-builder, the movie of movies was Conan the Barbarian. Read more…\n\nPretty Poison and the original Gun Crazy [New York Times] “Pretty Poison,” starring Anthony Perkins and Tuesday Weld, was hardly the greatest Hollywood movie of 1968. As a film about delusional young folk run murderously wild, and the subject of critics’ debates, it was however one of that turbulent year’s quintessential stories.

Read more…\n\nOn Paradjanov’s The Color of Pomegranates and Fernando Birri’s ORG [New York Times] Understanding is not synonymous with enjoying. The visual language of some movies is so personal and hermetic that interpreting it could be compared to reading a novel written in hieroglyphics. “The Color of Pomegranates,” also known as “Sayat Nova,” made by the Soviet director Sergei Parajanov (1924-1990) is one.

The last of the remaining stragglers is the 1961 crime-syndicate classic, “Underworld U.S.A.,” out on Blu-ray from Twilight Time. It’s a movie of which the British critic V. F.

[New York Times] Verisimilitude is always an issue with a war film. “You can’t show war as it really is on the screen, with all the blood and gore,” the director Samuel Fuller once observed, suggesting that it might be better to “fire real shots over the audience’s head” and “have actual casualties in the theater.” Read more…\n\nOn The Death of Stalin [Tablet] A dark comedy with an inappropriately antic tone, opening here a week after Purim, The Death of Stalin has something to offend everyone—Slavophiles and Slavophobes, The Nation and The National Review, erudite professors and historical ignoramuses, neo-Stalinists and anti-Stalinists of all persuasions.

And all six movies about the blundering Inspector Clouseau, starring Peter Sellers and directed by Blake Edwards (who also did much of the writing), are out from Shout! Factory as the six-Blu-ray “Pink Panther Film Collection.” Read more…\n\nOn Nocturama [NYRB Daily] A shabby-chic cadre of photogenic young Parisians coordinate a series of terrorist attacks, blowing up or setting fire to buildings and monuments throughout the city, then take refuge after nightfall in an empty department store. Nocturama, the French filmmaker Bertrand Bonello’s daring and controversial follow-up to his 2014 Yves Saint Laurent biopic, is even more relentlessly stylish than its predecessor. Read more…\n\nOn two movies by Nick Ray, They Live by Night and Savage Innocents [New York Times] Nicholas Ray’s “They Live by Night” (new on disc from Criterion) is a remarkable debut as well as an agonizingly pure love story — the most lyrical film of the director’s career. Read more…\n\nOn Menashe [New York Times] A Yiddish-language feature made with nonprofessional actors on the streets of Brooklyn? Joshua Z. Weinstein’s Menashe is not the product of a time machine but the belated rebirth of a venerable tradition. Read more…\n\nOn both versions of The Beguiled [NYRBlog] Seen strictly on its own terms, Sofia Coppola’s remake of The Beguiled is an adept, mildly wicked, discreetly violent riff on the relations between men and women. Put next to the original, an overheated Clint Eastwood vehicle, directed by Don Siegel, it’s a good deal more. Read more…\n\nOn The Wages of Fear [Lapham’s Quarterly] The Wages of Fear, directed by Henri-Georges Clouzot and first shown at the Cannes Film Festival in the spring of 1953, is movie as doom show: the four principal characters have signed on to a suicide mission, driving two truckloads of nitroglycerin across three hundred miles of winding, mountainous, badly paved roads.Read more…\n\n25 Films for the 21st Century People have been asking me so I thought I might as well join (or crash) the party initiated by The New York Times last week and put in my two cents regarding the 25 Best Films of the 21st Century (so far).

Both a world-famous director and a national conscience, Wajda—who died last October at age ninety—was a singular artist. It is appropriate then that his final film, hauntingly titled Afterimage would be a drama concerning the last years of another Polish artist, the abstract painter Władysław Strzemiński (1893–1952). Read more…\n\nOn The Wedding Plan [Tablet.com] I am not a religious Jew. Nor do I believe in Hollywood happy endings. Yet I can’t deny my fascination with the second feature by the ultra-Orthodox Israeli director Rama Burshtein. Read more…\n\nOn Paz Encina [Artforum] Paz Encina makes film objects and situational documentaries, or sit-docs, movies in which a dramatic narrative is transparently constructed from a handful of organized audiovisual facts. Sound in Encina’s minimalist films generally takes precedence over image. The artist is a formalist whose subject is the history of her native Paraguay—poor, landlocked, governed for decades by the ruthless right-wing dictator General Alfredo Stroessner.

Read more…\n\nOn The Settlers [Tablet.com] One of the first things to strike you in The Settlers, Shimon Dotan’s compelling, strongly articulated documentary portrait of Israelis and others living adjacent to the state of Israel on the occupied West Bank, is the quality of the light. Just about the last thing that Dotan shows is a scene of the gathering darkness.

Hartley wrote. “They do things differently there.” In silent movies, you might say they act differently.

In a map of the world attributed to him that year, the American republic (except for a giant Alaska) has been subsumed by Labrador in the north and a sprawling Mexico in the south. The image of Mexico as the center of the new world—and as what André Breton called “the surrealist country par excellence”—is a take-away from the exhibition “Paint the Revolution: Mexican Modernism 1910-1950,” now showing at the Philadelphia Museum of Art.

Motion pictures are where you find them—on disc, online, in museum galleries, between covers—as well as in film festivals and multiplex theaters. Herewith the best of those I saw this year.

Return of the Double Feature!, a 26-day retrospective series opening on Friday at Film Forum, offers proof. Read more…\n\nOn Demon [Tablet] S. Anski’s verse play The Dybbuk is arguably the key Jewish artwork of the past century as well as the unexpected inspiration for an audacious new Polish film, Demon, co-written and directed by the late Marcin Wrona. Read more…\n\nOn Bruce Conner at MoMA [NYRBlog] “It’s All True,” the title of the Museum of Modern Art’s powerful retrospective of the American artist Bruce Conner (1933-2008), comes from a letter Conner wrote to one of his gallerists in the aftermath of his only previous museum retrospective, organized by the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis in 1999:\n\n“My work is described as beautiful, horrible, hogwash, genius, maundering, precise, quaint, avant-garde, historical, hackneyed, masterful, trivial, intense, mystical, virtuosic, bewildering, absorbing, concise, absurd, amusing, innovative, nostalgic, contemporary, iconoclastic, sophisticated, trash, masterpieces, etc. It’s all true.”\n\nHow about “sinister,” “creepy,” and “indelible”? Read more…\n\nPeter Hutton 1944-2016 [New York Times] Peter Hutton, an experimental filmmaker noted for his contemplative, sensuous, masterfully photographed portraits of landscapes and cities, died on Saturday in Poughkeepsie, N.Y. He was 71. Read more…\n\nOn Kaili Blues [NYRBlog] Kaili Blues, an eccentric, remarkably assured first feature by the young Chinese director Bi Gan, is both the most elusive and the most memorable new movie that I’ve seen in quite some time—“elusive” and “memorable” being central to Bi’s ambitions. Read more…\n\nOn the King of Jazz restoration [New York Times] A significant movie restoration not only can return a film’s patina of newness but its place in film history as well. That may be the case when the musical revue “King of Jazz” (1930), brought back to something of its original splendor, emerges from the vaults in the soft, shimmering red and green tones of early Technicolor. Read more…\n\nOn Straub Huillet at MoMA [New York Times] Some movies want to be loved. Others prefer to be admired. And then there are the movies, like those by Jean-Marie Straub and Danièle Huillet, that, indifferent to love or admiration, are monuments to their own integrity. Read more…\n\nOn Eva Hesse [Tablet.com] Had she lived, artist Eva Hesse would have turned 80 this year. But lovely-looking, dark-eyed, and dead at 34, she personifies transitory beauty. So does her groundbreaking work… Read more…\n\nTony Conrad 1940-2016 [New York Times] Tony Conrad, an experimental filmmaker, avant-garde musician and university educator who in the 1960s was a central figure in a flowering Lower Manhattan art movement, died on Saturday at a hospice in Cheektowaga, N.Y., near Buffalo. He was 76. Read more…\n\nOn the rediscovered movie Who’s Crazy? [New York Times] There was a time in the late 1960s when artistic vanguards joined forces: Andy Warhol produced an album with the Velvet Underground, the rock star John Lennon teamed with the conceptual artist Yoko Ono, and Norman Mailer tried his hand at experimental films. More obscurely, Thomas White, a 33-year-old American in Paris, produced a semi-improvised movie featuring members of the avant-garde Living Theater and a soundtrack by the free jazz exponent Ornette Coleman. Read more…\n\nOn “Coney Island: Visions of an American Dreamland” [NYRBlog] “The only thing about America that interests me is Coney Island,” Sigmund Freud is supposed to have said—and the itinerary of Freud’s 1909 trip to America did include a visit to Dreamland, then the newest of Coney Island’s original three amusement parks. Read more…\n\nOn Irving Thalberg [Tablet] Darryl F. Zanuck won the first one in 1937 and two thereafter. Walt Disney won it. So did Cecil B. DeMille, Alfred Hitchcock, and, a rare outsider, Ingmar Bergman. Steven Spielberg got it eight years before he won an Oscar. George Lucas got one too, the only Academy Award he’ll ever need. Oscars are a dime a dozen but, in the 79 years since Zanuck took one home, only 39 of these babies have been awarded. Honored in 2010, Francis Ford Coppola was the last to receive it. It is the Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award—Hollywood’s ultimate self-tribute given to those “creative producers, whose bodies of work reflect a consistently high quality of motion picture production.” Read more…\n\nOn the 1950 movie Native Son [New York Times] Novelists might dream of playing their protagonists in the movies. Few have enjoyed the opportunity. The crime writer Mickey Spillane was one. Richard Wright, the most celebrated African-American novelist of his day, was another. Read more…\n\nOn Rabin, the Last Day [Tablet.com] Rabin, The Last Day, Amos Gitai’s sprawling, scarific two-and-a-half-hour quasi-documentary on the November 1995 assassination of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin by a young religious fanatic, Yigal Amir, after the signing of the Oslo Accords, begins by interviewing Rabin’s comrade Shimon Peres regarding the vilification the two men suffered after Oslo: “Sedition was in the air,” Peres says. Read more…\n\n2015\n\nAndrew Noren 1942-2015 [New York Times] The avant-garde film universe is small, so when a star, even a distant one, vanishes, attention is paid. It was not so in May, when Andrew Noren died of lung cancer at the age of 71. Read more…\n\nOn Son of Saul [Tablet.com] An immersion in Auschwitz during the mass murder frenzy of October 1944, when the gassing of Hungarian Jews had been nearly completed, Son of Saul—a first feature by the French-Hungarian director László Nemes—is not a movie to recommend lightly. Read more…\n\nOn Jim Shaw [NYRBlog] The term “outsider art” was coined in 1972 by the British art historian Roger Cardinal as a way to categorize work that might otherwise be described as naïve, fanatical, eccentric, autistic, or insane. The Los Angeles artist Jim Shaw is a connoisseur and collector of such things… Read more…\n\nOn Chantal Akerman [New York Times] Chantal Akerman, the Belgian-born filmmaker who died in Paris at age 65, was a prodigy. Almost before her career began, she wrote and directed one of the key artworks of the 20th century. Read more…\n\nChantal Akerman 1950-2015 [Tablet.com] One of the major film artists of our day, Chantal Akerman died suddenly in Paris, earlier this week. Read more…\n\nOn The Walk [NYRBlog] Two twenty-first century phenomena have changed the way moving pictures are made and perceived. The first is the accelerating use of digital technology and the inexorable rise of a cyborg cinema that, by combining animated and photographic images, compromises the direct relationship to reality that had long been the medium’s claim to truth. The second is the trauma of September 11, 2001, which for many provided the ultimate movie experience that was more than a movie—spectacular destruction, broadcast live, and watched by an audience, more or less simultaneously, of billions. Both events inform The Walk, the new 3-D movie by Robert Zemeckis that recounts and reconstructs the French aerialist Philippe Petit’s high-wire stroll between the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center in 1974. Read more…\n\nOn Robert Zemeckis [New York Times] This fall is the season of Robert Zemeckis, the 63-year-old Chicago-born writer-director who began making movies in the 1970s and changed American history, at least metaphorically, with his two huge hits “Back to the Future” (1985) and “Forrest Gump” (1994). Read more…\n\nOn Thomas Hart Benton and Hollywood [Artforum] Walt Whitman heard America singing; Thomas Hart Benton (1889–1975) heard the nation shouting, snapping its suspenders, slapping itself on the back, and dancing a buck-and-wing. Read more…\n\nOn The Kindergarten Teacher [Tablet] The subject of writer-director Nadav Lapid’s latest movie is a precocious 5-year-old poet. Lapid, who is 40, can hardly be considered a child prodigy. Still, his two features, Policeman (2011) and The Kindergarten Teacher (2014) have made him the most internationally acclaimed Israeli filmmaker in recent memory… and perhaps ever. Read more…\n\nOn Phoenix [Tablet] A psychological thriller set in the aftermath of World War II, the German director Christian Petzold’s Phoenix is a variant on a myth—the story of Orpheus and Eurydice—that has served many filmmakers. Read more…\n\nOn Mexican film noir [New York Times] A fake clairvoyant is outmaneuvered by the fetching widow he hopes to blackmail; a meek manicurist plots to replace her wealthy twin sister; an arrogant athlete is tricked into framing himself.The program “Mexico at Midnight,” at the Museum of Modern Art, overflows with fatalistic tales of passion, jealousy and betrayal. Read more…\n\nOn “Folk City” [Tablet] I confess. I was a teenage folkie—or at least I passed for one. I wore blue chambray work shirts and a red-and-black checkered lumber jacket to school. I took the E train to West 4th Street, milled around the fountain in Washington Square, smoked unfiltered cigarettes and drank coffee at Reggio, had my heart broken by long-haired girls who wore Fred Braun sandals. Read more…\n\nOn The Wolfpack and The Tribe [NYRBlog] Though they are set at opposite ends of the earth and represent opposed forms of cinema, The Wolfpack and The Tribe have much in common. Both new films share a concern with male-dominated groups vying for power inside what Nietzsche called “the prison house of language” Read more…\n\nOn Spencer Williams [New York Times] The history of American cinema is hardly synonymous with Hollywood’s. “A Road Three Hundred Years Long: Cinema and the Great Migration,” the wide-ranging series opening Monday at the Museum of Modern Art, not only maps the perimeters of African-American filmmaking but also showcases movies that defy characterization. Read more…\n\nOn Edward Owens [Artforum] The list of teenage filmmakers ssociated with the New American Cinema during its late-1960s glory days includes Barbara Rubin, Warren Sonbert, George Landow, and Robert Beavers.To these we can add Edward Owens (1949–2009), whose precocious 16-mm movies gathered dust on the shelves of the Film-Makers’ Cooperative for decades. Read more…\n\nOn Germany’s Forbidden Films [New York Times] The Third Reich was not only a totalitarian state but also a total multimedia regime. Seven decades after its fiery collapse, the embers remain — including some 1,200 feature films produced under Joseph Goebbels’s ministry of propaganda. Are they historical evidence, incitements to murder, fascist pornography, evergreen entertainments, toxic waste or passé kitsch? All of the above? Read more…\n\nOn Bryan Burrough’s Days of Rage [Los Angeles Times] Once upon a time, as a college senior in autumn 1970, I organized a committee to block a politician from making a campaign appearance on campus and sought support from a not-unsympathetic faculty member. Read more…\n\nOn Jack Smith’s Hamlet in the Rented World [Artforum] Given that Jack Smith never actually completed another movie after Flaming Creatures (1963), that most of his theater pieces concern the impossibility of their coming into existence, and that many all-but-identical drafts of the same scripts were found among his papers, it’s hardly surprising that he should have been fascinated by the most famously indecisive character in world literature. Read more…\n\nOn Afrofuturist Film [New York Times] “Being black in America is a science-fiction experience,” the culture critic and musician Greg Tate once asserted in an interview, articulating the premise for what has come to be called Afrofuturism. Read more…\n\nOn Siegfried Kracauer and Photography [NYRBlog] A photograph is a physical “representation of time,” the cultural journalist and polymath Siegfried Kracauer wrote in an article titled “Photography,” published on the front page of Frankfurter Zeitung in late 1927. Read more…\n\nOn Maps to the Stars and The Congress [Tablet] Some weeks ago, during the course of a televised discussion on Selma and the Oscars, an old colleague of mine explained that the reason the Motion Picture Academy appeared so oblivious to movies by or about women and people of color was that the Academy members “all look like me,” which he clarified as “over 50” and Jewish (adding, “I would quit if I were a member”). How responsible should Jews feel for Hollywood? Read more…\n\nOn Batman and Pop Art [Artforum] Loved and loathed beyond measure, the televised Batman (ABC, 1966–68) arrived sufficiently late in the day to recognize itself as a manufactured craze. The show, initially broadcast cliff-hanger style on successive evenings, Wednesdays and Thursdays at 7:30 PM, lasted only two and a half seasons—just a speed bump in Batman’s nearly eight-decade career—but its goofy lèse-majesté besmirched the durable icon forever. Read more…\n\nOn Jean-Luc Godard’s Montreal lectures [The Nation] “I’m always surprised to see what I do,” Jean-Luc Godard admits at the beginning of a talk delivered, nearly four decades ago, at Concordia University in Montreal. Could the single most influential filmmaker of his generation, who is still a provocateur at age 84, possibly be as baffled as we? Read more…\n\nOn American Sniper [NYRBlog] A country boy, who is a fabulous natural shot, goes to war and neutralizes an unprecedented number of enemy combatants. Books are written. A respected Hollywood director makes the movie that will be the biggest hit of his career: it’s received with near-unanimous praise, an Oscar nomination for Best Picture, and no small amount of controversy. Read more…\n\nOn “The Left Front: Radical Art in the ‘Red Decade,’ 1929-40” [Tablet] Entering “The Left Front,” the exhibition of political art from the 1930s, currently at NYU’s Grey Art Gallery through April 4, is to enter a foreign—but not completely unfamiliar world. Read more…\n\nOn Tomi Ungerer [NYRBlog Gallery] It may be that everyone has their own Tomi Ungerer. The eighty-three-year-old graphic artist and illustrator’s work has been part of many people’s childhoods, others’ countercultures, still others’ outrage, and, at one point in his career, every straphanger’s New York. Read more…\n\nOn Alexei German [New York Times] Aleksei German, who died last February at the age of 74 while putting the finishing touches on his most ambitious film, the long-awaited “Hard to Be a God,” was regarded by some as Russia’s greatest living director — despite, or perhaps because of, the fact that he managed to complete but a handful of features in a nearly half-century career. Read more…\n\nOn Two Days, One Night [NYRBlog] A thirty-something factory worker in a Belgian rustbelt town returns from medical leave to discover she’s become redundant. She has a weekend in which to persuade a majority of her sixteen colleagues to sacrifice their thousand-euro bonuses so that she can get back her job. Such is the situation dramatized by the Belgian filmmaker-brothers Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne. Read more…\n\nOn Inherent Vice [Artforum] It is obvious by now that Paul Thomas Anderson isn’t making individual movies so much as building an oeuvre block by block—the sturdiest, most resilient body of work by a big-time American director since Stanley Kubrick died and Martin Scorsese ran out of steam. Read more…\n\n2014\n\nOn David Lynch’s paintings [NYRBlog Gallery] Like Andy Warhol and Salvador Dali, David Lynch is a name-brand artist who confounds conventional categories. Read more…\n\nOn Peter Forgacs’s installation [Tablet] “Last night I was in the Kingdom of Shadows,” reported Maxim Gorky after attending a program of “Living Photography” at the Nizhny Novgorod Fair during the summer of 1896. “The extraordinary impression it creates is so unique and complex that I doubt my ability to describe it with all its nuances.” You may feel the same way after an hour spent with the video installation Letters to Afar. Read more…\n\nOn “What Nerve!” [NYRBlog] “What Nerve! Alternative Figures in American Art, 1960 to the Present,” the provocatively titled exhibit at the RISD Museum in Providence, presents a bracing counter to one prevailing way of telling the story of postwar American art. Read more…\n\nOn the 1968 New York Film Festival (written in 1968) [Film Comment Blog] Yes, I know. I was a teenaged know-it-all, as well as a rabid soixante-huitard, a serious pothead, occasional speed freak, and fanatical cinephile. Read more…\n\nOn Georgian cinema [New York Times] Squeezed between the Black and Caspian Seas, as it was among the Roman and Persian, and Ottoman and Russian empires, Georgia is a small realm with a spectacular natural setting and a proud past. Read more…\n\nOn Hou Hsiao-hsien [NYRBlog] Although the Taiwanese director Hou Hsiao-hsien has been making movies since the early 1980s, I first became convinced of his genius when I saw The Puppetmaster(1993) some twenty years ago. Read more…\n\nOn Tabu, People on Sunday, and the lost paradise of silent film [Artforum] The doors of Eden banged shut. Even so, during the summer of 1929, facing the clamorous inevitability of the talking picture and only months before the crash that would announce the Great Depression, a handful of filmmakers sought refuge in the “natural world” of the soundless movie. Read more…\n\nOn the films of the Hollywood blacklisted [New York Times] The close-up, the big screen, the eternal klieg light of unending media coverage: Motion pictures, especially those made in Hollywood, are a technology of magnification. How else to explain that the tale of the 300 or so movie studio employees whose political associations cost them their jobs has come to dramatize the repressive hysteria of the McCarthy era? Read more…\n\nOn Snowpiercer [NYRBlog] Bong Joon Ho’s Snowpiercer is a madcap addition to the comic-book-derived movies that have dominated cinematic summer fare for much of the twenty-first century. At once streamlined and ramshackle, it doesn’t have a plot so much as a premise—or rather, a ruling metaphor.
