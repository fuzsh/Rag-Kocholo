        "text": "We talk to the director of murder mystery Traces Of Sin…\n\nOne could tell that Kei Ishikawa was often deep in thought from the moment they laid eyes on him. After every question he would pause lengthily, pondering precisely how he would present his answers. Ishikawa attended the National Film and Television School in Lodz, Poland, something that he claims that he did “randomly”, and because he tended to favour the European cinematic style. In truth it makes complete sense that the acclaimed school that produced such geniuses as Andrzej Wajda, Krysztof Kieslowski and Roman Polanski would seem a good opportunity for the young filmmaker. After watching Traces of Sin, one sees remarkably the impact of particularly late Polanski in Ishikawa’s work. Like the other Polish auteur’s Ishikawa’s work is something you can appreciate purely aesthetically, but as he explained to me, there is something far more complex going on in Traces of Sin. Kei’s film explores hierarchy in its latent form, dictating our behaviour from below. Here is my talk with the impressive and surprising director of the nuanced social critique/murder mystery Traces of Sin.\n\nI have to ask, why go to film school in Poland? Why did that seem the logical choice in your progression as a filmmaker?\n\nI get asked this questions thousands of time, and I never feel like I give a proper answer. My own personal technical tendencies and stylistic preferences were always geared toward European cinema. Especially back in the day when it came to choosing a school, I looked specifically in Europe. And when I was searching I kind of wanted to go somewhere random, and to me Poland was that. When I arrived it definitely wasn’t a very optimistic, happening place, yet I felt that place was extremely photogenic. In Poland I really felt like I could create something.\n\nWere you in an international program? Were there even any other Japanese people there?\n\nIt was a quite international school, but I was their first Japanese student in 30 years. Come to think of it, there was only one other girl, and she is still filmmaking in Poland.\n\nSince you claim you favour the European style of Cinema, how do you consider this film Japanese? In other words is this film “Japanese”, and why?\n\nI had been living in Poland for quite a while, so upon returning to Japan I experienced a sort of foreign perspective, even though I am myself 100% Japanese. I think Traces of Sin in a way incorporated this outside view of my country, but no this is very much a Japanese film.\n\nDid living in Poland give you an enhanced perspective of Japan?\n\nThis Japanese social hierarchy is something quite invisible, the world is probably not aware of it, and I was not aware of it when I originally lived in Japan. It was not until I went to Poland and came back and saw that there were walls everywhere, people just don’t comment or talk about it. I feel it’s something that is very specific to Japanese society. Even though it is found somewhat in the novel that Traces of Sin is based, I incorporated heavily my own thoughts and experiences on the subject into the film.\n\nOne line that I couldn’t get out of my head is “In Japan there is no inequality only hierarchy”? Can you explain what that means?\n\nSo in Japan, people, mostly from the top of the wealth spectrum, they say you can get to the top if you really try hard enough, they sort of sell this “Japanese dream.” I always felt these were politicians words, in truth we are a very hierarchical society that just never clearly states it.\n\nCan we talk a little bit about how these ideas became Traces of Sin in the development from novel to film? Were these notions of separation and hierarchy in mind?\n\nThe original novel is a murder mystery, and it’s a pretty traditional style of murder mystery, but I wanted to make five specifically packaged stories. So I spoke with my scriptwriter to minimize the murder mystery angle to avoid becoming too black and white, the last thing I wanted to do was to create something dogmatic. As the title suggests, with Traces of Sin, I wanted to create a story where the audience could be left with something.\n\nWell that’s what I found interesting about your interpretation of sin, because your violence is different. I thought you were saying that there is a savagery expected from the poor and uneducated, but there is also a different, possibly more disturbing violence coming from the rich and educated?\n\nAt the beginning of production the notion of violence is something our team spoke a lot about. As you said it is birthed in various different aspects of society, from the poor to the rich, but not even exclusively within that dynamic. Think of the Internet, people may write something that is not intentionally evil, but on the other end of the net someone is getting hurt or even dying because of it. Situations like this I wanted to showcase with my film. Ideally, the question should be posed to the audience, what consists of the traces of sin, and what does it mean to be sinful?\n\nBut in this film would you argue that you are posing these questions more so at those on top of the hierarchy? Is it targeted at the elite?\n\nWhen you make a film about folly, like in these five tales of human folly, you are absolutely right hierarchy does play a huge part.\n\nIt was interesting to feature a protagonist who is an investigative journalist, especially one who specializes in murders, was this an homage, or something you considered yourself?\n\nIn terms of Tanaka, no I didn’t think of an homage to an older film or anything, the character doesn’t even exist in the original novel. I had to really expand my imagination to create this character. One of my major influences Roman Polanski has this film called The Ghost Writer, where the main character is a murder investigator as well. It is not something that was a direct reference though.\n\nHow did you get such a great cast involved and will we see them in any future projects?\n\nIt was a real blessing that Tsumabuki agreed to do the film before the script was even done. The main female character Hikari joined the project a little later on. Just to have both of them, I was so lucky in my first feature! In the future I would love to work with them again."
