        "text": "Back in 2021, a song released onMarc Anthony’s record label caused a stir among salsa fans.\n\nIt was a revamped version of the minor 1993 hit \"Hasta el Sol de Hoy,\" and the track introduced singer/songwriter Luis Figueroa as a messenger of change. It pulsated with the languid vibes of salsa romántica, but also uncoiled a harder, more ferocious groove on the chorus. It sounded like a Marc Anthony hit, but with an added patina of 2020’s urbano slickness. Anthony loved it.\n\n\"I realized that there was an open door —the opportunity to add a fresher sound to salsa for a younger audience,\" Figueroa, 34, tells GRAMMY.com.\n\nSince then, the Philadelphia native of Puerto Rican origin has become one of the few artists who consciously chose the somewhat forsaken mystique of salsa and turned it into a viable pathway for critical and commercial success. His latest recording – a fiery EP of urbano-styled salsa titled Voy A Ti — is nominated for Best Tropical Album at the 2024 GRAMMYs, alongside genre giants such as Rubén Blades, Grupo Niche and Omara Portuondo.\n\n\"Salsa is the music that I grew up with, and it was always a natural choice,\" he says. \"I guess I was taken by the passion and purity of the many salsa songs that focus on real love.\"\n\nFigueroa was just 9 years old when he began singing \"music that is meant to be enjoyed mostly at nightclubs,\" and met many genre legends. Graciela and Joe Cuba became his mentors. It was at that point that he envisioned himself following in the footsteps of Marc Anthony, Eddie Santiago — his sister’s favorite singer — and also his mother’s choice salseros: Frankie Ruiz and El Gran Combo.\n\n\"Because I was involved in music at a very young age, people called me el niño mimado de Filadelfia [Philadelphia’s pampered kid],\" he recalls. \"Artists like Ismael Miranda, Andy Montañez and Michael Stuart would come to the city for salsa fairs and they all wanted to meet the young kid who was singing their music. I got to perform [‘90s mega-hit] 'No Vale La Pena' onstage with Johnny Rivera.\"\n\nIt was only natural that Figueroa would gravitate to the salsa romántica sound that was prevalent at the time. \"My all-time favorite singer is Jerry Rivera, so clearly I have a weakness for the romantic side of tropical music,\" he agrees. \"Luis Miguel’s bolero album Segundo Romance (1994) was also an influence.\"\n\nBut then, Figueroa got the chance to study at the prestigious Berklee College of Music, where he discovered the complexity of R&B and other genres. A stint touring as backup vocalist with Romeo Santos allowed him to observe the bachata mega-star’s songwriting process. Just like Santos had updated and revolutionized the way bachata was supposed to sound, Figueroa thought that salsa could also benefit from a makeover.\n\n\"I realized that I wanted to partake in the evolution and revolution of this traditional genre,\" he recalls.\n\nCompared to the other nominees, Figueroa sounds like a salsa modernist on Voy A Ti. Its lead single, \"La Luz,\" kicks off with a digital loop and a vocal line that could belong in a straight-ahead reggaetón track, before it morphs into salsa and the singer’s impressive soneos anchor the chorus on traditional Afro-Caribbean territory. At times, the melody has subtle points in common with Karol G’s \"Tusa,\" the 2019 urbano anthem. The dramatic pyrotechnics of \"A Escondidas,\" on the other hand, with its smoldering trombone riffs and high-octane emoting, stems from the Marc Anthony school of thought.\n\nNot surprisingly, Figueroa became a Latin GRAMMY regular. In 2022, his self-titled album and the song \"Fiesta Contigo\" were nominated (he lost both to label boss Marc Anthony.) Voy A Ti was also nominated for a Latin GRAMMY a few months ago.\n\nThese accolades confirmed the prophetic worlds of salsa diva India, who met Figueroa at the beginning of his career and hailed him as a future star.\n\n\"She invited me onstage at the end of a festival,\" he recalls. \"I remember the bright lights and the smoke machines; the electricity of the moment. The keyboardist started playing the intro to 'Dicen Que Soy,' and people were singing the chorus before she stepped onstage. It was an epiphany, because at that moment I envisioned what I wanted my career to look like: to have, one day, people singing along in my own concerts.\"\n\nNow, Figueroa has become the latest in a distinguished line of salsa singers with boricua roots. From Tito Rodríguez and Héctor Lavoe to Cheo Feliciano and Ismael Miranda, the contribution of Puerto Rico to the salsa mystique is staggering — a reality that baffles the first time GRAMMY nominee.\n\n\"I don’t really know how to explain this phenomenon,\" he says. \"Is it something in the water? Is it the air? Is it the privileged location? If you ever understand it, please let me know.\" [Laughs.]\n\nWhile Figueroa craved the acceptance of Puerto Ricans who live on the island, he eventually realized that many salsa icons were born outside of it, including his idols Marc Anthony, India, and Frankie Ruiz.\n\n\"Creativity flows naturally in Puerto Rico, it stems from the heart and the soul. We have so many great singers and composers, poets, boxers, tattoo artists. Such a small island, too. It’s one of the great mysteries of the world,\" he says.\n\n2024 GRAMMY Nominations: See The Full Nominees List\n\nAt times, Laura Pausini has used music as a shield. On stage, she has felt powerful, untouchable. But when the music stops, her insecurity has managed to silence the creative corners of her mind.\n\nFive years ago, Pausini released Fatti Sentire / Hazte Sentir, which won a Latin GRAMMY Award for Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album. Despite this victory, comments from people around her regarding the future of women over 40 in the music industry had a demoralizing impact on her spirit.\n\n\"At that time, they told me that it was no longer possible for me to win an award as an older woman, with a musical style that no longer worked much on the radio,\" Pausini tells GRAMMY.com via Zoom from Milan.\n\nThe Italian singer admits that she felt confused and blocked for a while. Her inspiration was absent for three years, and she could not find a song that made her feel strong again.\n\n\"There have been moments of great insecurity, fear, doubts, thinking about the future in general as a woman, mother, and, of course, as a singer,\" says Pausini. \"I have felt baffled. I was blocked. I felt safe only when I was at home, not when I went outside.\"\n\nIn 2021, she won a Golden Globe for the song \"Ìo Si / Seen,\" composed by Diane Warren, Pausini, and Niccolò Agliardi. The song also received an Oscar nomination for Best Original Song (which ultimately went to H.E.R. for \"Fight For You\").\n\nPausini's path after the Oscar loss was transformative, and at the 2023 Latin GRAMMYs, she will be honored as Person Of The Year on Nov. 15. Read on for six takeaways from Laura Pausini's journey to finding purpose, new dreams to conquer, and her unique voice.\n\nEven With Dozens Of Awards Under Her Belt, Pausini Still Feels Pressure\n\nPausini's career began in 1993 after winning the famous Sanremo Music Festival in her native Italy. She did it with the song \"La Solitudine,\" quickly leading her to internationalization. She soon became a household name in Spain and throughout Latin America.\n\nIn her three-decade career, Pausini has been recognized with prestigious awards. In addition to multiple GRAMMY nominations and a golden gramophone at the 48th GRAMMY Awards for Best Latin Pop Album, Pausini had won an ASCAP Latin Music Award, multiple awards in Italy, a Billboard Latin Music Award, and four Latin GRAMMYs.\n\n\"When I won the Golden Globe, I questioned how I could deserve this new award and what new responsibility I had. \"In these 30 years, I have luckily won many awards, and with each one, I have said to myself: Okay, now I have won, so I must do better the next one because if I have an award, the responsibility is to improve myself,\" Pausini tells GRAMMY.com.\n\nDespite making headlines worldwide after her Golden Globe win, Pausini says she needed to be stronger and ready to manage the internal pressure. \"I even wondered if I was capable of accepting a daily challenge with what was happening at that time.\"\n\nOne Song Changed Everything — And Renewed Pausini's Confidence\n\nAll this sea of doubts was appeased two years ago with a song, \"Durare / Durar.\" Translated as \"to last\" in English, the ballad talks about the evolution of love over time and a couple's commitment to making the relationship last. With a theme that bets on love and relationships, the song illuminated the dark corners of her art.\n\n\"This song has opened all the doors that, inside my mind, my heart, my soul, were closed and afraid to open,\" says Pausini.\n\nThe topic triggered a personal process where Pausini analyzed herself as an artist. That internal reckoning resulted in the creation of 2023's Anime Parallele / Almas Paralelas, her fifteenth studio album.\n\nPausini Observed Herself To Create Anime Parallele / Almas Paralelas\n\nThe idea of Pausini's latest album arose after a creative exercise, where the GRAMMY winner was able to \"get out\" of her body and observe herself from above. She saw herself walking through the streets of the world; she saw the zebra crossings that are now the cover of her album, and she met people whose faces we do not see but whose stories we do hear.\n\n\"I have begun to criticize myself, also to say that I have done something brave,\" Pausini reflects. \"And then I started seeing other people in those streets. All the people I saw were not walking in my direction; they were going everywhere.\"\n\nInevitably, this inner work made her rediscover her power. Pausini found \"the nerve to put my voice and my face before everyone's judgments.\"\n\nAfter Looking Inward, Pausini Looked Outward To Tell New Stories\n\nTranslating to \"parallel souls,\" Anime Parallele / Almas Paralelas is unique in Pausini's discography. It's the first album that tells stories not exclusively from Pausini's experience, but also reflects on parts of her life.\n\n\"It's the first album that doesn't talk about something just mine, what I've experienced, what I want. [It is] dedicated to 16 stories from 16 different people,\" she says. \"It is an album that celebrates diversity, the right to individuality…because we are all citizens of the same streets in the world, but we do not have the same souls, with different dreams, desires, and ideals.\"\n\nAnime Parallele / Almas Paralelas is committed to inclusion, on the record and in life. Its dialogue is a hopeful exploration of how people who do not share the same point of view can still show respect and empathy.\n\nPausini took the theme further, describing \"the world I would like to have\" as one in which she wakes up \"every morning and hear no talk about war, bullying, violence. The one where I observe from above people living their lives in peace on the streets of the world.\"\n\n\"For the first time, I realized that perhaps all that news, which scared me incredibly, exists because people cannot respect each other for being different. I've wanted to dedicate an album to that. It is an album celebrating diversity and the right to individuality,” she explains.\n\nThe Passage Of Time Inspires Pausini\n\nReflecting on the passage of time — and the links between the past, present, and future — is so present in Pausini's life that it echoes throughout her latest album. Anime Parallele / Almas Paralelas even begins with a ticking clock.\n\nNot only does it musically give us clues about this process, but also, in the physical format, among the photographs in the booklet, there is a phrase from the artist that encompasses the production.\n\n\"'I have passed to be present in your future.' This phrase contains three of my favorite words, which give me the strength to believe in myself today,\" Pausini reflects. \" I don't want to reject anything from my past. I want to feel strong in this present, and I want to dream of my future.\"\n\nPausini Will Be Honored As The Latin Recording Academy's Person Of The Year\n\nAll the experiences that Pausini has lived have led her to be the most awarded artist in Italy, to be adopted by Latin America and Spain as another citizen, and, among other triumphs, to be the third woman in the history of the Latin GRAMMY to be named Person Of The Year.\n\nShe is also the first European woman to receive the recognition. She is joined on this list by Gloria Estefan and Shakira, who were honored in 2008 and 2011, respectively.\n\nStill, Pausini doesn't quite know how she arrived at this point. It could be the deep bond she shares with her global fanbase.\n\n\"From day one, I have always felt adopted by all of you, and I have felt like all the people who are adopted in life. I don't have the same blood, but I have grown up with my family, which is you. That is undoubtedly a very moving thing for me,\" she says.\n\nPausini's life and career will be celebrated on Nov. 15 in Sevilla, Spain, one night before the 24th Latin GRAMMYs.\n\nMeet The First Time Latin GRAMMY Nominee: Borja\n\nThe Latin Recording Academy has just announced the nominees for the 2023 Latin GRAMMYs, which air Thursday, Nov. 16, from Sevilla's Conference and Exhibition Centre (FIBES), marking the first-ever international telecast in the history of the organization and awards.

The pop icon highlighted her Latina heritage by embracing the music stylings of pasillo, a popular genre in Ecuador.\n\nAguilera's powerhouse voice soars as she sings about finding healing and closure from a traumatic childhood experience. The song builds from a vulnerable ballad to a moment of flamenco-infused catharsis.\n\n\"Carretera y Manta\" – Pablo Alborán\n\nMusical worlds collide in Pablo Alborán's \"Carretera y Manta,\" in which the Spanish singer/songwriter blends '80s-inspired pop with elements of contemporary Latin urbano beats.\n\nThe standout single from his La Cuarta Hoja album, Alborán sings about not worrying about the destination, but instead enjoying the journey to get there. Alborán is known for big ballads and with this carpe diem anthem, he shows off a more upbeat and danceable side to his artistry.\n\n\"Déjame Llorarte\" – Paula Arenas Feat. Jesús Navarro\n\nColombian singer/songwriter Paula Arenas explores the emotional depth of Latin pop music in \"Déjame Llorarte,\" teaming up with Jesús Navarro, the powerhouse voice behind Mexican group Reik.\n\nThe heartfelt ballad is centered by Arenas and Navarro's sweet shared harmonies, which detail moving on from a breakup. Backed by piano and strings, the soulful collaboration was included on Arenas' A Ciegas album.\n\n\"Shakira: Bzrp Music Sessions, Vol. 53\" – Bizarrap Feat. Shakira\n\nShakira turned a difficult time in her personal life into a global moment of empowerment. The Colombian pop icon teamed up with Argentinian producer Bizarrap for \"Shakira: Bzrp Music Sessions, Vol. 53.\"\n\nBizarrap seamlessly blends elements of EDM and Latin urbano music, as Shakira unleashes her inner \"She Wolf\" once again. In her Bzrp session, Shakira gave women wronged by an ex a kiss-off anthem that is packed with plenty of punchlines. \"Women no longer cry, women get paid,\" she sings in Spanish.\n\n\"Si Tú Me Quieres\" – Fonseca & Juan Luis Guerra\n\nIn addition to scoring further reggaetón hits from Mañana Será Bonito, Karol G also showed versatility to her artistry on her latest album.\n\nThe Colombian superstar sampled the feel-good classic \"Don’t Worry, Be Happy\" by Bobby McFerrin in \"Mientras Me Curo Del Cora.\" With a bit of reggaetón in the mix, she turns a dark moment in her life into Latin pop positivity and allows listeners get to know Carolina Giraldo Navarro — the woman behind Karol G.\n\n\"De Todas Las Flores\" – Natalia Lafourcade\n\nAfter paying homage to the music of Mexico and Latin America in her past few releases, Natalia Lafourcade returned last year with De Todas Las Flores, an album of all original music.\n\nOn the hypnotic title track, Lafourcade shows why she is one of Mexico's most exciting and innovative alternative acts. Lafourcade masterfully melds the sound of her guitar, folkloric Latin music, and jazz in the song where she mourns the memories of a past romance.\n\n\"Ojos Marrones\" – Lasso\n\nLast year, Lasso scored one of the biggest global hits that was outside the Latin urbano genre. The Venezuelan singer/songwriter channeled the spirit of '70s soft rock in \"Ojos Marrones, citing Fleetwood Mac as one of his inspirations for the alluring love song.\n\nWith his raspy voice, Lasso sings about getting lost in his partner's brown eyes. Lasso continued to put a refreshing spin on the music of pop past throughout his album Eva.\n\n\"La Fórmula\" – Maluma & Marc Anthony\n\nTo tap into the sound of salsa music, Maluma teamed up with one of the genre's giants. In \"La Fórmula,\" the Colombian superstar joined forces with Nuyorican icon Marc Anthony for a charming duet.\n\nThe colorful and sweeping song was included on Maluma's Don Juan album. Backed by a full band and tropical beats, Maluma and Anthony sing about wanting to reignite the romance with an old flame.\n\n\"Despechá\" – Rosalía\n\nRosalía continued to push Latin music to new places in the deluxe version Motomami, last year's Latin GRAMMY Album Of The Year winner.\n\nThis year, the Spanish pop star blended elements of merengue, pop, and house music in \"Despechá.\" Instead of being bogged down by a breakup, Rosalía gets the mambo dance line started while singing about cutting loose with her close friends. The genre-bending track was Rosalía's fierce remedy for channeling spiteful feelings into a cathartic club experience.\n\n\"Correcaminos\" – Alejandro Sanz Featuring Danny Ocean\n\nSpanish pop icon Alejandro Sanz teamed up with rising Venezuelan star Danny Ocean for \"Correcaminos.\" The sultry collaboration combines the alternative reggaetón sound of Ocean with flamenco influences from Sanz's home country.\n\nSanz and Ocean sing from the heart about winning over the women of their dreams. Whether that happens in this lifetime or the next, both singers are determined to make that happen in this magical duet.\n\nLatin GRAMMYs 2023: Song Of The Year Nominees — Read Them Here"
