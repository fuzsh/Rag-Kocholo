        "text": "Professor Catherine Bollard is Professor of Pediatrics and Microbiology, Immunology and Tropical Medicine at The George Washington University and Director of the Center for Cancer and Immunology Research at the Children’s Research Institute at Children’s National Hospital. In these roles, Cath leads clinical and research efforts to fight cancer by strengthening the immune system using adoptive cell therapy. She has a long-standing research interest in gene and cell therapies, and her laboratory research has worked to translate novel cell therapeutics to the clinic.\n\nFor over 20 years, Cath has investigated the efficacy of tumor- and virus-specific T cells for cancer, giving her extensive experience in the evaluation of antigen-specific immune responses in humans. She has treated more than 200 patients with novel cell therapeutics at Baylor College of Medicine and Children’s National Medical Center, and as the sponsor/principal investigator on more than a dozen investigator-initiated IND studies using immune-based therapies, she is highly experienced in developing and running clinical studies as well as the development of translational bench to bedside studies. Cath joined Children’s National from the Baylor College of Medicine where she was a tenured professor in the Department of Pediatrics. Prior to that, she served as a Postdoctoral Fellow at Texas Children’s Hospital. She holds Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery degrees (MBChB) and a Doctor of Medicine (MD) from Otago University Medical School in New Zealand.\n\nMartin Pule is Clinical Senior Lecturer in the Dept. of Haematology at UCL Cancer Institute and Honorary Consultant in Haematology at University College London Hospital. His research is focused on many aspects of genetic engineering of T-cells for cancer treatment, with a particular focus on CARs. He entered the T-cell engineering field in 2001 as a travelling Fulbright Scholar at the Center for Cell and Gene Therapy at Baylor College of Medicine, Houston. Here, Martin Pule was the first to describe third generation forms of CARs and described one of the first clinical studies of CARs, which showed efficacy in a solid cancer. Martin Pule is Director of the UCL Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) programme. He holds a Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery from University College Dublin and is a Fellow of the Royal College of Pathologists.\n\nProfessor Marc-Olivier Coppens is a chemical engineer, who is globally recognised for pioneering nature-inspired chemical engineering (NICE). He developed a rigorous and systematic nature-inspired solution (NIS) methodology, which leverages fundamental mechanisms underpinning desired properties in nature, to solve challenging engineering problems within a practical context, from energy and scalable manufacturing to health and biomedical engineering.\n\nMarc-Olivier is Ramsay Memorial Professor and Vice-Dean Engineering (Interdisciplinary, Innovation) at University College London (UCL). He leads the EPSRC (Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council) “Frontier Engineering” Centre for Nature-Inspired Engineering at UCL and is a Fellow of the Royal Society of Chemistry, the Institution of Chemical Engineers (IChemE), the American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE), Corresponding Member of the Saxon Academy of Sciences (Germany), and Qiushi Professor at Zhejiang University (China).\n\nSergio Quezada is a Professor of Cancer Immunology and Immunotherapy at University College London Cancer Institute and Chief Scientific officer of Achilles Therapeutics. He earned his undergraduate degree in biochemistry from the P. Universidad Católica de Chile and a Ph.D. from Dartmouth Medical School in the US. In 2004, he joined the laboratory of the Nobel Laureate Prof James Allison at MSKCC, where he unveiled mechanisms underpinning the anti-tumour activity of anti CTLA-4 antibodies.\n\nHis work at UCL focuses in cancer immunology, tumour microenvironment, regulatory T cells and immune checkpoint blockade. His team’s research unveiled the critical role of Fc receptors and the tumour microenvironment in the mechanism of action of anti CTLA-4 antibodies, and he is an inventor of several key patents supporting the clinical development of antibodies targeting immune checkpoints including VISTA, ICOS and CD25. In the last few years, Prof Quezada and his team co-led the development of a first in class Treg-depleting anti-human CD25 antibody acquired by Roche in 2018 and is currently in clinical evaluation against solid cancers.\n\nIn addition to immune regulation, Prof Quezada’s research also aims to characterization and interrogate immune reactivity and function within the microenvironment of different human cancers, helping identify mechanisms of response and resistance to immunotherapy. His work in this area led to creation of a spin off company, Achilles therapeutics, a clinical stage company delivering personalised T cell therapies against cancer. In April 2020 Prof Quezada stepped in as Chief Scientific Officer of Achilles to lead the current and future scientific direction of Achilles.\n\nProf Quezada was a recipient of Dartmouth’s John W. Strohbern Medal for excellence in biomedical research, the Cancer Research Institute new investigator award, a CRUK Career Development Fellowship and a CRUK Senior Cancer Research Fellowship. In 2022 Prof Quezada was elected Fellow of the European Academy for Cancer Sciences\n\nProf. Terry Rabbitts is a molecular biologist who trained at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology (LMB) in Cambridge as a post-doc with César Milstein. He succeeded Fred Sanger as head of the LMB Division of Protein and Nucleic Acid Chemistry, jointly with Cesar Milstein, and is currently Professor of Molecular Immunology at the Institute of Cancer Research, London. His work has centred on chromosomal rearrangements in antibody and T cell receptor genes and in cancer-associated chromosomal translocations. During this work, he has pioneered a number of technologies including cDNA cloning, chimaeric antibodies, gene targeting knock-in, intracellular antibody capture and antibody-derived compounds (Abd technology), including compounds to the “undruggable” RAS. Current work focusses on developing technologies to use intracellular antibodies and derived compounds as drugs against chromosomal translocation proteins and mutant RAS, aimed at leukaemia therapy.\n\nHe is a Fellow of the Royal Society, of the Academy of Medical Sciences, of the American Association for Cancer Research Academy and an EMBO Member. He has been awarded the Colworth Medal, the CIBA Medal and the Clotten Foundation Prize in recognition for his work on chromosomal translocation genes in cancer aetiology and novel approaches to cancer drug discovery.\n\nTerry Rabbitts contributions to biotechnology include being chairman the SAB of Cambridge Antibody Technology until its IPO, of Quadrant HealthCare and of Kymab until their commercial acquisitions, and an SAB member of Domantis until its acquisition. He was a member of the Apustcan Board until its acquisition by Avacata. He is a co-founder of Orbit Discovery and Quadrucept Bio.\n\nDr Patrick Hanley is the Chief and Director of the Cellular Therapy Program and an associate professor of pediatrics at Children’s National Hospital and the George Washington University, respectively. He oversees processing for standard of care stem cell transplantation as well as the development, manufacture, and testing of novel cellular therapies and is responsible for seeking partnerships and commercialization of promising cell and gene therapies. Trained as an immunologist, Patrick has an extensive background and interest in cellular therapy and is passionate about improving regulations for cellular therapy, training the next generation of cell therapists, and facilitating the translation of new therapeutics. Over the past 15 years he has helped to translate more than 300 products on over 25 cell therapy protocols – ranging from mesenchymal stromal cells to cord blood virus-specific T cells and tumor-associated antigen specific T cells – into the clinic.\n\nPatrick serves on the board of directors and as the chair of the education committee of the Foundation for the Accreditation of Cellular Therapy (FACT) and is an active cellular therapy and cord blood inspector. He co-founded and served as the inaugural co-chair of the Early-Stage Professionals committee and was elected as vice president, North America of the International Society of Cell and Gene Therapy (ISCT).

These include the isolation and transplantation of pure hematopoietic stem-cells (HSCs), isolation of hematopoietic progenitors and the development of non-toxic antibody-based conditioning for HSC transplantation. In acute myeloid leukaemia, he proposed and proved preleukemic development in clones of HSC accumulating one mutation at a time with the last mutation giveing rise to leukemic stem cells (LSC). Next, by comparing LSC to HSC, Irving discovered CD47 on leukemic stem-cells as a ‘don’t eat me’ signal used by leukemias and all human cancers tested to evade innate immunity. He showed that anti-CD47 blockade unleashes phagocytosis of cancer cells by macrophages, including brain microglia, and developed cancer immunotherapy, achieving remarkable results in phase-II clinical trials.\n\nIrving is a member of the National Academy of Sciences, the Institute of Medicine at the National Academy, and the American Association of Arts and Sciences.\n\nDr. John Maris is Giulio D’Angio Professor of Pediatrics in the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania and the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia.

Following these interests over the past two decades, I have had the privilege of working with world leaders in antibody engineering at Genentech and later able complete my PhD work at the University of Pennsylvania where the pioneering clinical work on CAR T cells was first done. I have built experience across immunology, protein engineering, cancer biology, and computational biology, and have applied my expertise to understanding the immune interface at of peptide/MHC/receptor. Interactions at this immune interface have demonstrated the ability to cure at least subsets of patients through immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) and adoptive transfer of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). My work is focused on expanding the population of patients who can benefit from immunotherapies by characterizing and engineering interactions at this interface. To date, my work has resulted in the identification of novel targets that are highly specific to tumors, and CAR T cell therapies that can identify these targets in a highly selective manner. These CAR T cells completely eliminate tumors in mice and are slated for human clinical trials next year. My work in the coming years will focus on building on these methods and expanding their application to other cancers.\n\nDr. Sgourakis earned his PhD in Biology from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in 2009, working with Angel Garcia on computational simulations of intrinsically disordered proteins, and a Master’s degree in Bioinformatics from the National University of Athens, Greece.
