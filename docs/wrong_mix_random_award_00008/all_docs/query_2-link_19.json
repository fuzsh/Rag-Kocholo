With speech you’re taking literature and bringing it to life and really begin to internalize, and certainly with poetry, with rhythm and sound and all of that, it ceases to just be something on the shelf. And that was an experience where I had someone saying “You’re good at this, you’re talented. This isn’t just average, and you need to keep working harder.” So along the way I felt like I kept having those kinds of mentors who would go, “You’re onto something, keep working harder.”\n\nLinks:\n\nSocial:\n\nPriya Krishna\n\nClass of 2009 | Greenhill School, Texas\n\nPriya Krishna is a food writer who contributes regularly to the New York Times and Bon Appétit.
