        "text": "Act III in Shakespeare’s Julius Caesar is known for the funeral speeches given by the characters of Brutus and Marc Anthony. The speeches are so notable that this year, to teach argument and rhetorical devices, we added the play to begin the American Literature unit.\n\nObviously, the play is not American, and historically, Shakespeare took liberties with the assassination of Caesar in this 400+-year-old play. But the different rhetorical devices Shakespeare used in these funeral speeches allow the English teachers a means to highlight how well the characters demonstrate their rhetorical skills of persuasion using the appeals of ethos, logos, pathos. These rhetorical elements form a rhetorical triangle and were first defined by Aristotle:\n\nEthos: the speaker appeals to the audience as credible (or not).\n\nLogos: the speaker appeals to the audience’s rational or logical thinking.\n\nPathos: the speaker appeals to the audience’s emotions.\n\nUnderstanding these elements will help students later when they analyze the American speeches that are in the curriculum such as Jonathan Edward’s sermon Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God, Lincoln’s Second Inaugural Address, or William Faulkner’s Nobel Prize Acceptance Speech.\n\nIn the play, the first up to eulogize Caesar is Brutus who makes use of rhetorical device antithesis:\n\n“Had you rather Caesar were living, and die all slaves, than that Caesar were dead, to live all freemen?”(3.2.22–24)\n\nBrutus uses rhetorical questions:\n\n“Who is here so base that would be a bondman?…\n\nWho is here so rude that would not be a Roman?…\n\nWho is here so vile that will not love his country?”\n\n(3.2.30-35)\n\nHe appeals to the crowd’s ethos as he tells them, “Believe me for mine honor.”\n\nHe appeals to the crowd’s logos as he argues, “Would you rather that Caesar be alive and you be slaves?”\n\nAnd he appeals to the crowd’s pathos as he states, “I did love Caesar, but I loved Rome more.”\n\nSoon after, Marc Anthony takes the stage, and he appeals to the crowd’s ethos with his opening line, “Friends, Romans and countrymen…”\n\nNot only does he show the crowd that he is “one of them” (common person) but he starts his speech in a memorable pattern, an example of the “rule of 3s” in speech.\n\nAntony appeals to the crowd’s logos by offering “proof” that Caesar was a war hero, who “thrice refused the crown.”\n\nIn a final bow to the crowd’s pathos, Antony shows his own emotion, saying:\n\nBear with me;\n\nMy heart is in the coffin there with Caesar,\n\nAnd I must pause till it come back to me.\n\n(3.2.115–117)\n\nAntony’s repeated use of the phrase ”but Brutus is an honorable man” cleverly implies an opposite meaning, stated just before he shows the people Caesar’s bloody corpse and connects the stab marks with conspirators.\n\nShakespeare’s Act III scene ii’s “speech-off” ends with a fired-up rabble of Romans ready to riot, as the blunt honesty of Brutus’s prose is upended by the poetic craftiness of Marc Anthony’s rhetorical style.\n\n1700 years later, the context for comparing and contrasting the McCain eulogies could not be more different. These speeches, given in the National Cathedral in Washington, D.C., were not part of a political contest but given as a tribute to an American icon, Senator John McCain, when a malignant brain tumor caused his death on August 25, 2018.\n\nMcCain was a Vietnam War hero who twice lost a chance to be President of the United States. He lost the 2000 Republican presidential nomination to George W. Bush, who then won the White House. He lost the 2008 presidential race, running as a Republican against the Democratic nominee, Barack Obama.\n\nThe only similarities between the eulogies for Shakespeare’s Julius Caesar to the larger-than-life McCain is that both that both sets of speeches have excellent examples of rhetorical elements and both sets of speeches were publically delivered in the same venue by political rivals.\n\nIt was McCain’s rivals, former presidents, Barack Obama (Democrat) and George W. Bush (Republican), who addressed a crowd gathered at his funeral on September 1, 2018.\n\nThe transcripts of these speeches are available on numerous websites including the CBS News website or the NYTimes website along with videos of the speeches (Obama 19:26 and Bush 7:53).\n\nThese videos and transcripts can give teachers an opportunity to have students analyze the speeches for the elements from the rhetorical triangle that these politicians used in paying tribute to an American icon.\n\nFor example, students may note how Obama, who spoke first, described McCain by using the rule of thirds, “a warrior, a statesman, a patriot.”\n\nThey can call attention to Obama’s appeal to ethos, as he explained how McCain authorized him to speak at this occasion.\n\n“So for someone like John to ask you, while he’s still alive, to stand and speak of him when he’s gone, is a precious and singular honor.”\n\nAnd they may note how Obama used an antithesis in his tribute saying,\n\n“It’s not based on where our parents or grandparents came from, or how recently they arrived, but on adherence to a common creed: That all of us are created equal.”\n\nThen, in Bush’s speech, students may notice an appeal to ethos,\n\n“He [McCain] was honest, no matter whom it offended. Presidents were not spared.”\n\nThey may notice Bush also used repetition stating:\n\n“If we are ever tempted to forget who we are, to grow weary of our cause, John’s voice will always come as a whisper over our shoulder: We are better than this. America is better than this.”\n\nOr Bush’s use of a rhetorical question, “Where did such strength of conviction come from?”\n\nGiving students copies of the transcripts of these speeches lets them find the evidence where the speaker:\n\nuses an emotional appeal?-pathos\n\nuses an appeal to reason?-logos\n\nestablishes his credibility?-ethos\n\nuses a rhetorical question?\n\nuses humor?\n\nuses repetition?\n\nuses antithesis?\n\nAfter finding the evidence, students could be asked to analyze each eulogy, before judging how well Obama and Bush used the elements of ethos, logos, and pathos.\n\nIn this example, students go as far back to the definitions of Aristotle and the examples of Shakespeare to study rhetoric. Then they can go back and analyze the speeches of two former Presidents of the United States of America.\n\nBut even the best of these literary tributes to John McCain fall short. History has already portrayed him as a man who only spoke “right on”, and one who let his actions speak louder than any rhetoric used to define him.\n\nBaseball is America’s sport, but I do not have a baseball “favorite team”.\n\nMy favorite team is whoever is playing the New York Yankees.\n\nI hope that team wins…and wins big.\n\nI hate the New York Yankees.\n\nThat said, I do have an appreciation for the cultural contributions of individual Yankee team members.\n\nFor example, I liked Babe Ruth…but the Yankees got rid of him.\n\nI liked the architecture of the “House that Ruth built”…but the Yankees got rid of that, too.\n\nI liked Lou Gehrig…and I especially liked how gracious he was when he retired from baseball after he was diagnosed with ALS amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.Before the diagnosis, Lou Gehrig was known as the “iron horse” of baseball, and according to the official Lou Gehrig website,\n\n….Gehrig’s consecutive game streak of 2,130 games (a record that stood until Cal Ripken, Jr. broke it in 1995) did not come easily. He played well every day despite a broken thumb, a broken toe and back spasms.\n\nOther statistics on the website highlight his remarkable career:\n\nGehrig’s 184 RBIs in 1931 remains the highest single season total in American League history.\n\nHe batted .361 in 34 World Series games with 10 homers, eight doubles and 35 RBIs.\n\nHe also holds the record for career grand slams at 23.\n\nHe hit 73 three-run homers and 166 two-run shots, giving him the highest average of RBI per homer of any player with more than 300 home runs.\n\nWhen Gehrig’s illness forced him to retire, the sportswriter Paul Gallico suggested to the New York Yankees management that there should be a “Recognition Day” to honor Gehrig.\n\nOn July 4, 1939, 62,000 fans watched in Yankee Stadium as Gehrig delivered a short speech during which he described himself as “the luckiest man on the face of the earth.”\n\nWhen Gehrig spoke that day, there were multiple microphones, but only a small section of the speech was recorded.\n\nThe text and audio from the speech are on the American Rhetoric website.\n\nDuring the speech, Gehrig listed the relationships he had with others repeatedly as “a blessing”.\n\nFirst, he thanked the fans:\n\n“I have been to ballparks for seventeen years and I have never received anything but kindness and encouragement from you fans.”\n\nHe thanked his fellow teammates:\n\n“Look at these grand men. Which of you wouldn’t consider it the highlight of his career just to associate with them for even one day? Sure I’m lucky.”\n\nHe thanked the NY Yankee’s management team, and he thanked the members of the rival team, the NY Giants:\n\n“When the New York Giants, a team you would give your right arm to beat and vice versa, sends you a gift, that’s something.”\n\nHe thanked the grounds keepers:\n\n“When everybody down to the groundskeepers and those boys in the white coats remember you with trophies, that’s something.”\n\nHe thanked his parents:\n\n“When you have a father and mother who work all their lives so that you can have an education and build your body, it’s a blessing.”\n\nAnd, he thanked his wife:\n\n“When you have a wife who has been a tower of strength and shown more courage than you dreamed existed, that’s the finest I know.”\n\nIn the brief text of only 286 words, Gehrig demonstrated both incredible grace and excellent speech-craft.\n\nOn June 2, 1941, Lou Gehrig succumbed to ALS.\n\nThe speech he left is a great literary text to share with students in middle or high school. The readibility of this speech is about a grade 7, and there are several rhetorical devices worth noting. For example, Gehrig’s rhetorical strategies in the speech included the anaphora, which is the repetition of a first word or phrase in successive phrases (“when”) and epistrophe, a stylistic device in which a word or a phrase is repeated at the end of successive clauses (“it’s a blessing…”).\n\nGiving students speeches to analyze is one way for teachers in all subject areas to increase background knowledge about history and American culture. Teaching this farewell address meets the Common Core Literacy Standards English Language Arts and for History, Social Studies, Science and the Technical Subject Areas, that require students to determine word meanings, appreciate the nuances of words, and steadily expand their range of words and phrases.\n\nOn July 4th, we celebrate all things American. What could be more American than baseball…even if it is a farewell to baseball address? Lou Gehrig’s speech is one of the great American inspirational speeches…even if he was a NY Yankee.\n\nOh, and one more thing I can say that I like about the Yankees?\n\nI like my husband.. he grew up as a Yankee fan."
