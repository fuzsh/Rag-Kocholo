        "text": "Manila (AsiaNews) - Children and women victims of sexual abuse find hope, comfort and healing from the Sisters of the Divine Saviour of the Diocese of Novaliches, in Quezon City, near Manila.\n\nThanks to the Salvatorian Pastoral Care for Children programme at Good Shepherd Parish, a group of the sisters and their volunteers provide much needed relief. \"These children and women need mental health care, as well as other kinds of support, to cope with their lives and move on,\" said Sister Mary Adeline Abamo, who is in charge of the programme that has expanded to 73 other parishes in the country.\n\nAccording to the nun, if a child or woman affected by sexual abuse in society does not share or vent to others, their mental health is disturbed. This represents a key social ministry of the Sisters of the Divine Saviour. After 18 years of work, the nun said that these children and women are at risk of poverty and other types of vulnerability.\n\nHowever, they need healing that is not only physical: through forgiveness and pastoral care, they can start their lives anew with God's grace, with the support of their families, communities and the Church.\n\n\"We are delighted with the interest in the programme. At least 12 vicariates are involved in the programme in the Diocese of Novaliches, sharing the commitment to make parishes more child-friendly,\" he adds.\n\nVolunteers, young people, collaborators, former victims and their families support the care and protection of children in the parish community. The idea of caring for abused children and women originated from the Second Plenary Council of the Philippines in 1991 and the pastoral letter of the Bishops' Conference of the Philippines on the exploitation of Filipino children.\n\nIn 1998, both articulated the social teachings that underpin the Salvatorian Pastoral Care for Children. 2,584 child rights activists received instruction on these social teachings during training sessions and conferences.\n\nPope Francis increased the importance of child protection by establishing the Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Children in March 2014 and hosting what was considered a high-level summit on the topic in 2019.\n\nIn 2014, the 15th year of the programme, the Salvatorian Sisters extended their pastoral care for children to two more parishes in the Diocese of Novaliches. Bishop Antonio Tobias established the pastoral care programme for children and vulnerable adults, which now operates under the Diocesan Commission for Social Action.\n\nIn response to Francis' request in 2019, Bishop Roberto Gaa of Novaliches founded the Diocesan Safeguarding Office in 2022, with protocols recorded in a manual for the protection of children and vulnerable persons.\n\nBetween January 2001 and January 2024, the Salvatorian Pastoral Care for Children programme helped 512 children who had suffered physical, mental, psychosocial or sexual abuse. Some were homeless, abandoned or had their births registered after the fact.\n\nSome received medical or educational assistance. A further twelve cases have reached trial, although they are still pending. The Sisters of the Divine Saviour face many challenges and resistance. But they face them with grit and courage.\n\n\"Our ministry with these children and women is relevant and necessary,\" added Sr Abamo. The sisters also work closely with other religious organisations or ecumenical churches. The Salvatorian Sisters are committed to promoting the rights of children, ensuring their well-being and promoting their future. They follow the approach of participatory techniques for the empowerment of people.\n\nThe guiding principle is that no child experiences any kind of neglect, abuse, violence, exploitation or discrimination; instead, all live in safe, healthy, caring and protective environments.\n\nA child-friendly parish, which utilises community engagement and child protection expertise, takes into account the Filipino culture and conditions in impoverished areas. \"We motivate and cultivate a loving and supportive atmosphere for children in families and communities,\" said Sr Abamo."
