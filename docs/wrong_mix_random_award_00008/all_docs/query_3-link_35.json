The prize recognizes contributions by scientists to the fields of heat and light. These terms are widely interpreted; awards range from discoveries in thermodynamics to improvements in the construction of steam boilers.\n\nThe award was created through the endowment of US$5,000 to the Academy by Benjamin Thompson, who held the title “Count Rumford of the United Kingdom,” in 1796. The terms state that the award be given to “authors of discoveries in any part of the Continent of America, or in any of the American islands.” Although it was founded in 1796, the first prize was not given until 1839, as the academy could not find anyone who, in their judgement, deserved the award. The academy found the terms of the prize to be too restrictive, and in 1832 the Supreme Court of Massachusetts allowed the Academy to change some of the provisions; mainly, the award was to be given annually instead of biennially, and the Academy was allowed to award the prize as it saw fit, whereas before it had to give it yearly. The first award was given to Robert Hare, for his invention of the oxy-hydrogen blowpipe, in 1839. Twenty-three years elapsed before the award was given a second time, to John Ericsson.\n\nThe prize is awarded whenever the academy recognizes a significant achievement in either of the two fields.

Townes+^ “for his development of the laser.”\n\n1891 // Edward Charles Pickering^ “for his work on stellar photometry and stellar spectra.”\n\nAmerican Association for the Advancement of Science Fellow\n\nAAAS Fellows are a distinguished cadre of scientists, engineers and innovators who have been recognized for their achievements across disciplines, from research, teaching, and technology, to administration in academia, industry and government, to excellence in communicating and interpreting science to the public.\n\nIn a tradition stretching back to 1874, these individuals are elected annually by the AAAS Council. Newly elected Fellows are recognized for their extraordinary achievements at the ceremonial Fellows Forum, a time-honored event at the AAAS Annual Meeting where they are presented with a certificate and blue and gold rosette.\n\n2020 // Peter Fisher\n\n2018 // Jacqueline N.

He has spent 40 years collaborating with a dozen high-tech industrial companies, advised 70 master and doctoral theses, co-founded a master’s program for entrepreneurial physics, and played a key role in seven start-ups. A source of pride is the co-founding of an MRI manufacturing company grown to 175 employees (2020), two dozen of them his former students. His research group efforts have resulted in over 200 publications and 70 patents held by his students (eleven co-authored by him). His teaching led to the writing of a thousand-page MRI textbook which has been called variously the “big green book,” the “green bible,” or the “daily companion of the MRI scientist.” Present-day work is focused on accurate, but low-cost magneto-optical medical detectors including applications in malaria, Lyme, and cancer. Professor Brown’s medical physics team has received a U.S. Patent Office “Patents for Humanity” award for the malaria work. He is an APS and AAPT Fellow and has won five national and regional teaching awards.\n\n2021 // Leonid Levitov\n\nBuechner Prize for Outstanding Teaching\n\n2023 // Krishna Rajagopal\n\n2018 // Richard Milner and Christoph Paus\n\n2016 // Jesse Thaler\n\n2015 // Iain Stewart\n\n2014 // Hong Liu and Jesse Thaler\n\n2013 // Jeff Gore* and Iain Stewart\n\n2012 // Martin Zwierlein*\n\n2011 // Peter Fisher\n\n2010 // Allan Adams+\n\n2009 // Robert L.
