In the summer of 2022, Estefan starred in âFather of the Brideâ opposite Andy GarcÃ­a airing on HBOMAX. The movie amassed HBO Maxâs biggest audience for a streaming-only film and soared to the No. 1 title spot across HBO Max worldwide. Released in November of 2022, the âEstefan Family Christmasâ album featuring Gloria alongside her daughter, Emily (27) and grandson, Sasha (10) will be one of the first albums of its kind to combine three generations.

Currently, Gloria alongside her daughter, Emily Estefan are writing the music and lyrics for an original musical called âFIVE NOTESâ. This broadway musical is based on the award winning documentary âLandfill Harmonicâ. With Karen ZacarÃ­as as writer, Ken Cerniglia as director and Alex Lacamoire as musical director this musical celebrates the power of music, resilience and community\n\nThe Gloria Estefan Foundation\n\nFounded in 1997, the Gloria Estefan foundation promotes education, health and cultural development. The organization funds itself through proceeds from several of Gloria's songs, benefit concerts and donations from supporters. The singer has said, âMy foundation tries to help people that fall through the cracks, that canât get help from big organizationsâ¦ We try to fill in where immediate help is needed.â\n\nAs Gloria is a strong supporter of spinal cord research, the Foundation has been a big part of the growth of the Miami Project to Cure Paralysis. It is an open-door Foundation accessible to individual cases of hardship. Animal causes have always been close to Gloria's heart. Each year the foundation supports no-kill shelters throughout the United States and helped to fund the creation of the Vero Beach Dog Park. We are honored to in some way be a part of keeping safe the hard working and loyal police dogs that help protect Miami Beach."
