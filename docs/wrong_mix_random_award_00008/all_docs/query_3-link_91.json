Hance Park in downtown Phoenix with Maggie Rogers topping Friday's bill and Jamie xx doing the honors Saturday. An eclectic mix is something of an M3F tradition, dating back to when its name was McDowell Mountain Music Festival, and this year's lineup does not disappoint on that front, ranging from EDM to indie, pop and R&B, including Polo & Pan, Quinn XCII, Toro y Moi, Purple Disco Machine, Ashe, COIN and Chelsea Cutler.\n\nDetails: 2 p.m. Friday, March 3; 1:30 p.m. Saturday, March 4.

Crescent Ballroom, 308 N. Second Ave., Phoenix. $25. 602-716-2222, crescentphx.com.\n\nGlendale Folk & Heritage Festival\n\nThe 33rd annual Folk & Heritage Festival will continue the celebration of folk music, its history and culture at historic Sahuaro Ranch Park.

Their latest album, \"Existence Is Futile,\" is an operatic masterstroke that singer Dani Filth explained in announcing the album's release is \"about existential terror, the threat of everything, the end of the world, the end of one's life, existential dread.\" I'd say you wouldn't know that from the sound of it, but if you've heard their music, you know that's not true.\n\nDetails: 7:30 p.m. Wednesday, March 8.

But they're still great at doing other people's music justice, as their latest album, \"Native Sons,\" reminds us, from \"The War Is a Ghetto\" by War to \"Sail on Sailor\" by the Beach Boys.\n\nDetails: 7:30 p.m. Saturday, March 11. Chandler Center for the Arts, 250 N. Arizona Ave. $28-$68. 480-782-2680, chandlercenter.org.\n\nLos Lobos interview:Los Lobos' Steve Berlin talks 40 years of rock\n\nMarca Registrada\n\nThis norteña quartet from Culiacan, Sinaloa, whose band name refers to a registered trademark, has been earning an average of 5 million streams a month across digital platforms and more than 110 million views of their videos on YouTube.

There's a practically Beatleseque pop sensibility underscoring any number of the album's more inspired moments, from the harmonies that swoop in to support Liz Stokes' ethereal vocal on the title track to the wistful power-pop of \"Your Side.\"\n\nDetails: 8 p.m. Thursday, March 16. Crescent Ballroom, 308 N. Second Ave., Phoenix. $25; $22 in advance. 602-716-2222, crescentphx.com.\n\nOld 97's\n\nAmong the more distinctive acts to emerge from the '90s alternative-country boom, Old 97's are fronted by the great Rhett Miller, whose voice was custom-made for heartbreak even if it is more likely to be wrapped around a line as playful as \"I saw her sitting at the bar/You know how some girls are/Always making eyes/ Well, she wasn't making eyes.\" Decades later, Miller hasn't lost one ounce of charm despite all that maturity he flashes on their latest LP.\n\nDetails: 8 p.m. Thursday, March 16. Rebel Lounge, 2303 E. Indian School Road, Phoenix. Sold out. 602-296-7013, therebellounge.com.\n\nGrupo Arriesgado\n\nAfter a highly successful inaugural tour in 2022 that found them selling out Microsoft Theatre in Los Angeles in less than an hour, RL Music and Grupo Arriesgado will launch the much-anticipated Risky Tour 2023 at Footprint Center.

Tucker famously launched her career at 13 with the breakthrough single \"Delta Dawn.\" That she's still adding to that legacy with a record as strong as \"While I'm Livin'\" in her 60s is cause for celebration.\n\nDetails: 8 p.m. Friday, March 17.

Or six if you include those \"Taylor's Version\" rerecordings of \"Fearless\" and \"Red.\" And really, why would any fan not count those? We're assuming we'll be hearing songs from all six albums at the first two concerts of the Eras Tour, which Swift calls a \"journey through all of my musical eras,\" in Glendale, with special guests Paramore and Gayle.\n\nDetails: 6:30 p.m. Friday and Saturday, March 17-18.

Tumbleweed Park, 745 E. Germann Road, Chandler. $35 and up. ostrichfestival.com.\n\nTrain interview:Pat Monahan reflects on keeping Train on the tracks\n\nWhiskey Myers\n\nWhen Whiskey Myers rocked McDowell Music Fest a few years back, I called them the Southern rock revivalists to beat in 2017. \"They were truly amazing,\" I added, \"from lead singer Cody Cannon's raspy vocals — just imagine if a young Rod Stewart sounded more like he could kick your ass — to a staggering number of breathtaking dual-guitar harmonies. They also looked the part, which always helps more than a fool would think it should.\"\n\nDetails: 7:30 p.m. Friday, March 17. Arizona Financial Theatre, 400 W.

Germann Road, Chandler. $35 and up. ostrichfestival.com.\n\nAlgiers\n\nThese soulful post-punk revolutionaries are headed to Phoenix in support of \"Shook,\" a head-on collision of musical genres. The opening track grooves like INXS channeling Prince after easing you in with a texture that's closer in spirit to the haunting side of Nine Inch Nails. But that's all just a backdrop to advancing their political agenda with real urgency. There's a reason they're joined on one track by Zack De La Rocha of Rage Against the Machine.\n\nDetails: 8 p.m. Sunday, March 19. Rebel Lounge, 2303 E.

Footprint Center, 201 E. Jefferson St., Phoenix. $255 and up. 602-379-7800, ticketmaster.com.\n\nArizona Jazz Festival\n\nAs often happens in these situations, the headliners are R&B, not jazz. Friday's bill is topped by Anthony Hamilton, with Eric Darius, Rebecca Jade, LaVelle and Vincent Ingala. Saturday, Morris Day and the Time will headline over Jonathan Butler, Wendy Moten, Michael Lington, Julian Vaughn, Marcus Anderson and more.

In 2016, the Mexican rockers were hailed in Billboard as “the most widely sold and heard Latin band in the world.\" And the fact that it takes three performances to satisfy demand in metro Phoenix would suggest that they're as popular as ever.\n\nDetails: 8 p.m. Saturday, March 25. Desert Diamond Arena, 9400 W. Maryland Ave., Glendale. Verified resale ticket prices vary. 623-772-3800, ticketmaster.com.\n\nYeat\n\nThe L.A. rap sensation sent two records to the Top 10 on the Billboard album charts in 2022 — \"2 Alive\" and an EP titled \"Lyfe\" Vulture named him one of last year's biggest breakouts, and he was part of a viral mainstream moment with \"Rich Minion,\" a single featured in the trailer to \"Minions: The Rise of Gru.\" And he just dropped a full-length follow-up to \"Lyfe,\" the aptly titled \"Afterlyfe.\"\n\nDetails: 8 p.m. Sunday, March 26.

It was 1981 when Cash emerged from the imposing shadow of her father with \"Seven Year Ache,\" the first of 10 chart-topping country singles in the '80s. Her latest album, \"She Remembers Everything,\" didn't have that kind of luck at radio, but it's a great addition to her legacy, one that speaks to her continued relevance as one of country's smartest voices.\n\nDetails: 7:30 p.m. Monday, March 27.

She arrives in support of the breathtaking \"And in the Darkness, Hearts Aglow,\" which made the rounds of critics' year-end lists, from Paste to Spin, which hailed it as \"an album of our times\" while choosing Mering as its Album of the Year and Artist of the Year for being \"the most interesting, passionate and exciting musician of 2022.\"\n\nDetails: 8 p.m. Tuesday, March 28.

In a press release, McEntire called playing the Garden \"just the extra icing on an already triple-layered, stuffed and filled, iced and frosted cake!\" Given setlists on the first leg of this tour, fans can expect to hear such favorites as \"Can't Even Get the Blues,\" \"And Still\" and \"Little Rock.\"\n\nDetails: 6:30 p.m. Thursday, March 30. Footprint Center, 201 E. Jefferson St., Phoenix. $74.75 and up. 602-379-7800, ticketmaster.com.\n\nBilly Idol\n\nThe most important question here is obviously \"Is Steve Stevens in the band?\" He is, so that's a \"buy your ticket now\" for anyone who loved his music in the '80s. This is his first show of the year. At Arizona Bike Week. He's been dressing for a gig like this for decades. And for those may be wondering if you'll hear \"White Wedding,\" \"Rebel Yell\" and \"Dancing with Myself?\" Those were all among his most-played songs on last year's setlists.\n\nDetails: 8:30 p.m. Thursday, March 30. The RockYard at WestWorld of Scottsdale, 16601 N. Pima Road. $58 and up single-day admission; $150 four-day pass. azbikeweek.com.\n\nInterview:Billy Idol on 'Dancing With Myself'\n\nMegadeth\n\nDave Mustaine formed Megadeth in 1983, shortly after his dismissal from Metallica. The thrash-metal pioneers are considered one of the genre's \"big four,\" alongside Metallica, Anthrax and Slayer. Their brilliantly titled debut, \"Killing is My Business... And Business is Good\" failed to chart, but second album \"Peace Sells... But Who's Buying?\" began a string of platinum releases. They're at Arizona Bike Week."
