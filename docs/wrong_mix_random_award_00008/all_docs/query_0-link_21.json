        "text": "About\n\nWinner List\n\nMaps: Author Origins Book Settings\n\nSponsor Recognition\n\nPublishers\n\nTeam\n\nAbout\n\nAbout the Awards\n\nThe Dayton Literary Peace Prize, inaugurated in 2006, is the first and only annual U.S. literary award recognizing the power of the written word to promote peace. The Dayton Literary Peace Prize invites nominations in adult fiction and nonfiction books published within the past year that have led readers to a better understanding of other cultures, peoples, religions, and political points of view. Both awards carry a $10,000 cash prize.\n\nThe Mission of the Dayton Literary Peace Prize\n\nThe Dayton Literary Peace Prize mission is To advance peace through literature.\n\nThe Dayton Literary Peace Prize goal is to Support those who write, publish, read, and share literature that advances peace.\n\nBy recognizing books that promote peace through the DLPP prizes.\n\nBy encouraging the reading of winning books through programming and education outreach at all levels to enlighten readers about people and issues that concern peace.\n\nBy creating programming that fosters the empathy that is the result of enlightenment through reading.\n\nBy encouraging the movement toward justice that stems from empathy through programming and education that define justice.\n\nBy creating awareness that the steps to peace are enlightenment, empathy, and justice, and that reading books that promote peace are an impetus for the evolution in thought.\n\nAward criteria:\n\nNominated works should focus on peace: increasing understanding between and among people as individuals or within and between families, communities, nations, ethnic groups, cultures and religions. Works should have enduring literary value and should appeal to a variety of audiences.\n\nNominated works should characterize peace as:\n\nending or seeking to end conflict—personal, national or international,\n\nestablishing concord between and among people, or\n\nshowing consequences of persons, nations or institutions recklessly disrupting personal harmony or universal accord.\n\nHistory of the Dayton Literary Peace Prize\n\nIn 1995 Dayton was chosen as the site of what came to be known as the Dayton Peace Accords. The accords were a last-ditch effort to stop the ethnic cleansing that had claimed more than 300,000 lives and displaced 1 million people. It was “the worst killing ground in Europe since World War II,” wrote Mr. Richard Holbrooke in his 1998 book, To End a War.\n\nAmbassador Holbrooke chose Dayton as the summit site, an unimpressive alternative to opulent settings in Geneva, Paris, or Washington. Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, the largest in the country, provided stark accommodations for the nine participating delegations, sealed off the press, and displayed America’s air power. This environment augmented Holbrook’s use of the “Big Bang” strategy—now known in diplomacy circles as a “Dayton”—where negotiators are locked in a room until they reach an agreement.\n\nDaytonians welcomed the negotiators and then formed human peace chains around the base, holding candlelight vigils throughout the 21 days of talks. Dayton City Commissioner Matt Joseph described Dayton’s response, “People reacted. There was a fire in Bosnia and it was brought to our neighborhood. We took our garden hoses and tried to put it out. We just acted like neighbors. That’s what we do in Dayton. If they’re in trouble, we’re in trouble.”\n\n(For a greater understanding of the Dayton peace process, please watch the video below and read these two articles by Kati Marton, Holbrooke’s wife, published in the New York Times on April 18 & 19, 2011: “Waging Peace With Justice“ and “The Weapons of Diplomacy, and the Human Factor“.)\n\nWhat happened between Dayton and Bosnia after the accords were reached is especially noteworthy. In looking for ways to keep the “spirit of Dayton” alive, community members established citizen-to-citizen relationships with Bosnians through cultural and educational exchanges, trade missions, and international conferences between policymakers and government officials. Dayton also arranged a sister-city agreement with Sarajevo and hosted a “Concert for Peace” with the Sarajevo and Dayton Philharmonic Orchestras.\n\n“We are 5,000 miles away and made a difference for people no one every heard of, and in a place almost no one knew was there,” says Commissioner Joseph. “We were chosen, and we took up the cause.” Community leaders created the Dayton Peace Prize in 1999 to recognize individuals who contributed to the peaceful reconstruction of a society torn apart by war. Archbishop Desmond Tutu (1999), William Jefferson Clinton (2000), George Soros (2002) and Richard Holbrooke (2005) were recipients.\n\nThe Dayton Literary Peace Prize Foundation is the successor to the Dayton Peace Prize. The DLPP is dedicated to celebrating the power of the written word to forge peace. Daytonians witnessed that words not guns stopped a war. An all-volunteer committee researched the award, discovering that only two other peace prizes existed in the world and no literary peace prize existed in the U.S. DLPP established the only international literary peace prize in the country. The DLPP annually presents awards in Distinguished Achievement, Fiction and Nonfiction, each winner receiving a $10,000 honorarium and the runners-up in Fiction and Nonfiction receiving $5,000.\n\nPublishers and writers immediately responded to the call for nominations. DLPP established a cadre of first readers and final judges, brought together universities in support of the awards, appealed to corporations, businesses, local government and individuals in the Dayton area to launch the first award ceremony. The DLPP board asked award-winning local sculptor Michael Bashaw to create an award. Bashaw created a brass sculpture that evokes paper and quill and is inscribed with the author’s name and book title and the word “peace” in over 200 languages.\n\nThe announcement of the first prize was picked up by 244 newspapers throughout the U.S., Canada, Europe, Asia, Africa, the Middle East and Australia. The DLPP has continued to enjoy media attention during its fourteen-year history. Some of the coverage is available on the website www.daytonliterarypeaceprize.org under Press Room.\n\nThe Dayton Literary Peace Prize has built an international reputation—already standing among prestigious literary awards. The Lifetime Achievement (renamed in 2011 for Richard C. Holbrooke — the Ambassador Richard C. Holbrooke Award for Distinguished Achievement) winners have included Studs Terkel (who gave his last public speech at the 2006 event), Elie Wiesel, Taylor Branch, Nicholas Kristof and Sheryl WuDunn, Geraldine Brooks, Barbara Kingsolver, Tim O’Brien, Wendall Berry, Louise Erdrich, Gloria Steinem, Marilynne Robinson, Colm Tóibín, John Irving, N. Scott Momaday, Margaret Atwood, Wil Haygood, and Sandra Cisneros.\n\nFiction and Nonfiction winners include both established and emerging writers: Francine Prose, Stephen Walker, Brad Kessler, Mark Kurlansky, Junot Diaz, Edwidge Danticat, Richard Bausch, Benjamin Skinner, Marlon James, Dave Eggers, Emir Suljagic, Chang-rae Lee, Wilbert Rideau, Nigel Young, Andrew Krivak, Adam Hochschild, Adam Johnson, Andrew Solomon, Bob Shacochis, Karima Bennoune, Josh Weil, Bryan Steveson, Viet Thanh Nguyen, Susan Southard, Patricia Engel, David Wood, Hala Alyan, Ta-Nehisi Coates, Golnaz Hashemzadeh Bonde, Eli Saslow, Alice Hoffman, Chanel Miller, Alexander Starritt, Ariana Neumann, Honorée Fanonne Jeffers, Clint Smith, Geraldine Brooks, and Robert Samuels & Toluse Olorunnipa.\n\nOver the last sixteen years, DLPP has recognized writers born in and writing from the perspective of Algeria, Australia, Bosnia, Canada, China, the Dominican Republic, England (6), Ethiopia, Ghana, Haiti, Iran, the Republic of Ireland, Jamaica, Kenya, Nigeria (2), North Vietnam, Peru, Romania, Scotland, South Africa, South Korea (2), South Vietnam, the United States (44), and Venezuela. We have received nominations from 230 publishing houses, both large and small, including houses in Australia, Cambodia, Canada, England, Germany, Greece, Hungary, India, Ireland, Israel, New Zealand, Qatar, Scotland, Singapore, South Africa, and Sri Lanka.\n\nThe DLPP University Consortium and Library Consortium have significant outreach programs. Each year, the University Consortium, made up of colleges and universities in Ohio and beyond (we have university connections in Michigan, Virginia, New York, Utah, Pennsylvania, California and the U.K. and are working to extend the university connections through universities with peace institutes throughout the U.S. and beyond) presents DLPP programming for their students and the public.\n\nThe Dayton Literary Peace Prize Foundation remains primarily a volunteer organization, is non-profit and depends upon donations from individuals, corporations, universities, local government and grants to sustain its efforts.\n\nThe History of the Holbrooke Award\n\nThe Ambassador Richard C. Holbrooke Distinguished Achievement Award was formerly the Lifetime Achievement Award. Upon the untimely and tragic death of Richard Holbrooke, the board of the Dayton Literary Peace Prize (DLPP) Foundation determined that renaming the DLPP Lifetime Award for Ambassador Holbrooke was a fitting tribute to the man who made Dayton synonymous with peace around the globe (see “History of the Dayton Literary Peace Prize“).\n\nWhen Ambassador Holbrooke received the Dayton Peace Prize, the forerunner of the Dayton Literary Peace Prize, he advised us to pay annual tribute to the peace process and not let the world forget that peace can be forged with words. The award has been renamed the Dayton Literary Peace Prize Richard C. Holbrooke Distinguished Achievement Award and will adhere to the same criteria as the DLPP Lifetime Award. The award has previously honored Studs Terkel (2006), Elie Wiesel (2007), Taylor Branch (2008), Nicholas Kristof and Sheryl WuDun (2009), and Geraldine Brooks (2010). After Ambassador Holbrooke’s death, Barbara Kingsolver became the first winner of the Richard C. Holbrooke Distinguished Achievement Award in 2011, followed by Tim O’Brien(2012), Wendell Berry (2013), Louise Erdrich (2014, Gloria Steinem (2015), Marilynne Robinson (2016), Colm Tóibín (2017), John Irving (2018), and N. Scott Momaday (2019).\n\nThe prize includes a Michael Bashaw sculpture and the monetary award of $10,000.\n\nWe invite you to follow these links to learn more about Richard Holbrooke. Holbrooke’s wife, Kati Marton, wrote two articles for the New York Times in a series called “Remembering Richard Holbrooke, Parts 1 and 2.”\n\nWaging Peace with Justice (April 18, 2011)\n\nThe Weapons of Diplomacy, and the Human Factor (April 20, 2011)\n\nHere is a review of The Unquiet American: Richard Holbrooke in the World by Derek Chollet & Samantha Power. The review was written by Michael Getler for the Washington Post and published on November 11, 2011.\n\nVideo Discussions\n\nOn Tuesday, January 3, 2012, Charlie Rose moderated a panel discussion about Richard Holbrooke with George Packer, Gordon Goldstein, David Rohde and Holbrooke’s widow Kati Marton. Click on this link to see a video of that discussion.\n\nOn Sunday, February 5, 2012, CSPAN-2 broadcast a program in which Kati Marton and Strobe Talbott talked about the life and career of Richard Holbrooke. Strobe Talbott is a former reporter and editor for Time magazine, served as Deputy Secretary of State during the Clinton administration. At the time of this program he was president of the Brookings Institution. Mr. Talbott’s books include The Great Experiment, Engaging India, and The Russia Hand. The program was hosted by Politics and Prose Bookstore in Washington, DC.\n\n2019 Governor's Awards\n\nThe Dayton Literary Peace Prize Foundation was honored that in 20019 The Dayton Literary Peace Prize was the recipient of the prestigious Irma Lazarus Award, considered to be the highest of the Ohio Governor’s Awards for the Arts. The Irma Lazarus Award goes to “individuals or organizations who have helped shape public support for the arts through their work as advocates and have brought national and international recognition to Ohio through sustained dedication to artistic excellence.\n\nWinner List\n\nLifetime Achievement Award & The Ambassador\n\nRichard C.
