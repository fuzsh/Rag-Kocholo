From the caterpillar that eats our crops before metamorphosing into a stunning moth, to the mosquito that elegantly sips our blood (in exchange for a proboscis full of virus particles or parasites), to the socially-connected bee that pollinates flowering plants, to the humble, but mighty fruit fly that continues to teach us how our bodies function, these tiny creatures fascinate, confound, and inspire us. “Little Body/Big Impact” invites us to learn about, wonder at, and celebrate these little creatures that run the world.\n\nWatch archived presentations\n\nAnne Sverdrup-Thygeson - Why We Should Love Insects\n\nSession 1 Panel Discussion and Audience Q&A\n\nShannon Olsson - Fly Psychology 101\n\nJonathan Birch - The Minds of Insects and Why They Matter\n\nSession 2 Panel Discussion and Audience Q&A\n\nSegenet Kelemu - Innovations in Insect Science\n\nJulie Lesnik - Latitude and attitude: Environmental and cultural impacts on the perception of insects as food\n\nSession 3 Panel Discussion and Audience Q&A\n\nJessica Ware - (Bio)Diversity\n\nMichael Young - What Happens to a Lonely Fly\n\nSession 4 Panel Discussion and Audience Q&A\n\n2022 - Mental Health (In)Equity and Young People\n\nPrioritizing the mental health concerns of young people has become essential amid times of global pandemic, racism, sexism, ableism, social unrest, climate change, and political upheaval. These social inequities limit our ability to promote resilience in the mental health of adolescents and young adults, especially those from marginalized communities. Young people often experience little control over their wellbeing, are affected by the decisions of parents, schools and society, and in these technology-driven times are vulnerable to the negative side effects of social media and information overload. In considering how to eradicate inequities and promote mental health, technology becomes central in how it both aids and hinders our modern existence, in the U.S. and around the world.\n\nWATCH ARCHIVED PRESENTATIONS\n\nMeryl Alper - Supporting Mental Health among Autistic Youth in the Digital Age\n\nManuela Barreto - It takes a village to make someone lonely.\n\nDaniel Eisenberg - Investing in Youth Mental Health at a Population Scale\n\nJoseph P.

In less than a generation, we’ve witnessed nearly every piece of personal, scientific, and societal data come to be stored digitally. Stored information is both an intellectual and an economic commodity; it is used by businesses, governments, academics, and entrepreneurs. The velocity with which it accumulates and the techniques for leveraging it grow at a pace that is remarkable and often intimidating. But this revolution also promises hope, in areas as diverse as public health, drug development, child welfare, and climate change.\n\nWATCH ARCHIVED PRESENTATIONS\n\nWendy Chun - Discriminating Data: Correlations, Neighborhoods and the New Politics of Recognition\n\nFrancesca Dominici - How Much Evidence Do You Need?

Their findings have led to the development of cancer therapies that can strategically target cancer cells, with the result that persons undergoing the treatments experience fewer side effects than they would with traditional chemotherapy. The complexity of these biological drugs allows for their specificity and greater effectiveness, but also makes them very expensive to develop, produce and administer. Advances in treatment also increase the number of individuals living with cancer raising questions about how to most effectively support patients in the long-term following diagnosis.\n\nWATCH ARCHIVED PRESENTATIONS\n\nCarl June - Engineering the Immune System as a New Tool for Cancer Therapy\n\nChanita Hughes-Halbert - Transformational Research in Cancer Health Disparities\n\nJim Thomas - Creating Global Access to Biologic Therapeutics for Treating Cancer and Other Serious Diseases\n\nTuesday Panel Discussion\n\nKathryn Schmitz - Exercise Oncology: Balancing Evidence with the Need to Implement\n\nSuzanne Chambers - A Dialogue About The Care of the Patient\n\nCharles Sawyers - Are There Magic Bullets for Cancer?\n\nBissan Al-Lazikani - Big Data and AI: Hype?

Nobel Conference 55 asked “What tools are available, what research efforts do we require, and what kind of people do we need to be to conceptualize and address global climate challenges?” Nobel Conference 55 brought together seven leading thinkers to address climate change from perspectives including paleoclimate studies, climate justice, climate modeling, and climate adaptation. Attendees were encouraged to grapple with the causes and consequences of climate change and with our responses to the challenges it presents us, as individuals and as a society.\n\nWatch Archived Presentations\n\nAmitav Ghosh (Not archived by request)\n\nQ & A Session\n\nRichard Alley\n\nClimate Has Always Changed, Sometimes Abruptly: More Evidence That Humans are Changing the Climate\n\nTranscript of lecture\n\nQ & A Session\n\nDiana Liverman\n\nHow Can We Respond to Climate Change and Meet Our Goals for Sustainable Development?\n\nTranscript of lecture\n\nQ & A Session\n\nSheila Watt-Cloutier\n\nEverything is Connected: Environment, Economy, Foreign Policy, Sustainability, Human Rights and Leadership in the 21st Century\n\nTranscript of lecture\n\nQ & A Session\n\nGabriele Hegerl\n\nModels and Observations in Climate Change: Understanding the Past, Predicting the Future\n\nQ & A Session\n\nDavid Keith\n\nHow Might Solar Geoengineering Fit into Sound Climate Policy\n\nQ & A Session\n\nMike Hulme\n\nBeyond Climate Solutionism\n\nTranscript of lecture\n\nQ & A Session\n\n2018 (LIV) - Living Soil: A Universe Underfoot\n\nScoop up some soil in your hands and consider there are more organisms in that handful of soil than humans who have ever lived. Soil is a living entity in its own right, a community of micro- and macro-organisms that interact with the earth’s mineral resources to create this complex entity that undergirds all life on the planet. The 54th Nobel Conference, Living Soil: A Universe Underfoot, invited participants to consider the vast diversity and complexity of soil, and to ponder the challenges we face in protecting this most fundamental resource.\n\nWhat is soil health, and what processes sustain healthy soils? What interactions connect the living entities in the soil, and how do these interactions shape natural systems? How will climate change affect soils, and (how) can soils be used to mitigate rising levels of carbon in the atmosphere? How do we develop sustainable agricultural practices that will protect against soil erosion and promote soil health? How might we best promote exploration of beneficial compounds from soils? How might we re-imagine our relationship to soil culturally and socially, as well as biologically? These are just some of the questions that Nobel Conference 54 addressed.\n\nWATCH ARCHIVED PRESENTATIONS\n\nDavid Montgomery\n\nGrowing a Revolution: Bringing our Soil Back to Life\n\nQ & A Session\n\nClaire Chenu\n\nOrganic Matter as a \"Soil-ution\" to Global Challenges?\n\nQ & A Session\n\nTranscript of lecture\n\nRattan Lal\n\nSoil Carbon Sequestration for Advancing Global Food Security and Enhancing Resilience Against Climate Change\n\nQ & A Session\n\nFrank Uekotter\n\nKnowledge is Power, and so is Ignorance\n\nQ & A Session\n\nRay Archuleta\n\nHealing the Land, One Heart and One Mind at a Time\n\nQ & A Session\n\nJack Gilbert\n\nThe Earth Microbiome Project\n\nQ & A Session\n\nSuzanne Simard\n\nThe Hidden Pathways of the Otherworld\n\nQ & A Session\n\n2017 (LIII) - Reproductive Technology: How Far Do We Go?\n\nFrom artificial insemination to in vitro fertilization to contraception, reproductive technologies have long raised a host of complex scientific, social, and ethical questions. New techniques and technologies, such as genome editing and mitochondrial transfer, complicate those questions even further. The 53rd Nobel Conference invites participants to consider how continuing innovations in reproductive technology challenge us to think about what it means to be human.\n\nHow have scientific and technological discoveries assisted, transformed, and suppressed reproduction, and how will they continue to shape age-old debates about fertility and reproduction, motherhood and fatherhood? How safe are new techniques and what might be their impact on human health and social health? Who decides which technologies to develop, how they are funded, and who should have access to them? This conference will explore the science of these emerging technologies and delve into the ethical complexities and social consequences that result when we reshape a process so central to human life.\n\nWATCH ARCHIVED PRESENTATIONS\n\nRuha Benjamin – Rethinking Reproduction, Re-imagining Technology\n\nQ & A Session\n\nJacob Corn – CRISPR Gene Editing\n\nQ & A Session\n\nMarsha Saxton – Disability Rights Meets DNA Research\n\nQ & A Session\n\nAlison Murdoch – Reproductive Technology Regulation in the UK: 40-Year Review\n\nQ & A Session\n\nDiana Blithe – Prospects and Pipeline for Male Contraception\n\nQ & A Session\n\nCharis Thompson – The End of the World As We Know it?

Optimizing a business for efficiency often results in fewer and lower paying jobs. Regulating businesses for the public good may reduce their ability and incentive to develop innovative solutions to challenging problems. In the end, we are left with questions like:\n\nWhy does inequality matter?\n\nCan we bring the prosperity enjoyed by the world’s advanced economies to the rest of the world?\n\nHow do we grow economies in a sustainable way that benefits most, if not all of the population?\n\nWATCH ARCHIVED PRESENTATIONS\n\nDan Ariely – The (Honest) Truth about Dishonesty (Not archived by request)\n\nOrley Ashenfelter – Comparing Real Wages around the World: Inequality in Human Wealth\n\nQ & A Session\n\nJoerg Rieger – What Does Jesus Have to Do with Wall Street\n\nQ & A Session\n\nPanel Discussion – Tales from the Tightrope: Economic Balance in Everyday Life\n\nPaul Collier – Africa’s Prospects in a Difficult Decade\n\nQ & A Session\n\nJohn List – Using Field Experiments to Make the World a Better Place\n\nQ & A Session\n\nDeirdre McCloskey – How the World Grew Rich: The Liberal Idea, Not Accumulation or Exploitation\n\nQ & A Session\n\nChris Farrell – On Economic Inclusion\n\n2015 (LI) - Addiction: Exploring the Science and Experience of an Equal Opportunity Condition\n\nAddiction permeates our society. With the scourge of methamphetamine, increasing use of heroin, and the ubiquity of alcohol, addiction is an “equal opportunity condition.” The substances and behaviors to which people become addicted continue to grow as well, with investigations into the possibilities of addictions to food, the Internet, and sex. But what does it mean to be addicted? Is it a brain condition? A psychological and sociological problem? What are the treatment options available? How do the various understandings of addiction influence public policy decisions?\n\nWatch Archived PresentationsClassroom Resources\n\nEric Kandel – We Are What We Remember: Memory and Age Related Memory Disorders\n\nQ & A Session\n\nDenise Kandel with Eric Kandel – Molecular Basis for the Gateway Hypothesis\n\nQ & A Session\n\nSheigla Murphy – Understanding Prescription Drug Misuse from a Sociological Perspective\n\nQ & A Session\n\nPanel Discussion – Front-Line Triage\n\nCarl Hart – Why Drug-related Research is Biased: Who Benefits and Who Pays\n\nQ & A Session\n\nOwen Flanagan – Willing Addicts?

From the newest results in physics, chemistry, and biology to the newest fields of multidisciplinary study, scientists at the Nobel Conference have examined the universe at its largest and smallest scales, explored the oceans, and described new materials. Conference speakers have debated the mechanisms of aging as well as the science and economics of food. Often, speakers have given us a glimpse of the next big questions and how they might be answered. Throughout all of the conversations, ethicists and theologians have grounded the science in a human dimension.\n\nWatch Archived PresentationsClassroom Resources\n\nSean B.

What is the universe made of? Where did it come from? Where is it going? At Nobel Conference 49, “The Universe at Its Limits,” to be held on October 1 and 2, 2013, we will explore these questions in the light of recent discoveries and spend time contemplating both their scientific and their philosophical implications.\n\nWestern science has roots in ancient Greece, where two seemingly opposite lines of inquiry began over 2,000 years ago. The first was astronomy, the study of what is “outside,” beyond the boundaries of Earth. Over the centuries this discipline has looked outward to our solar system, our home galaxy, and beyond, to examine the large-scale structure of the Universe. The second was the study of “inside” matter, which began with the concept of the atom but has reached the realm of subatomic particles and the fundamental forces in nature.\n\nWatch Archived PresentationsClassroom Resources\n\nFr.

The marine world provides us with necessities like seafood and medicines, fertilizers and petroleum. But the oceans are also associated with danger, from the devastating hurricanes we face each year to the under-reported facts of the oceans’ roles in climate change. Nobel Conference 48 examines “Our Global Ocean” as a source of inspiration, danger, and knowledge.\n\nToday, we know less about our own oceans than we do about the surfaces of other planets hundreds of millions of miles away. It’s time to take a new look at our oceans by gathering some of the top researchers in biogeochemistry, oceanography, deep-sea biology, molecular genetics, and coral ecology to speak about their research and our roles regarding the ocean. Through the lectures of these leading marine scientists, we hope to ignite thought and conversation about the interconnected bodies of water that play a crucial role in the development of human life and culture.\n\nWatch Archived PresentationsClassroom Resources\n\nBarbara Block – Sushi and Satellites: Tracking Large Predators in the Blue Serengeti\n\nWilliam Fitzgerald – Mercury, Microbes, Mosquitoes, and More…\n\nDavid Gallo – Beyond Titanic – What’s Left to be Discovered in the Deep Sea\n\nOve Hoegh-Guldberg – Coral Reefs in a Rapidly Changing Climate: Going, Going, Gone?\n\nTranscript of lecture\n\nKathleen Dean Moore – Red Sky at Morning: Ethics and the Oceanic Crisis\n\nTranscript of lecture\n\nChristopher Sabine – What Does Midwest Coal Have to Do with the Price of Shellfish in Seattle?

Aspects of daily human life are now incorporated into the scientific arena in a new synthesis to understand the human experience and what it means to be human. The braiding of neuroscience with the humanities, arts, social sciences, theology, and engineering has empowered explanations of the motivations and operations of our daily activities. This insight engenders uncertainty in terms of how to best apply this knowledge responsibly and ethically, and perhaps is even challenging the distinctiveness of our own species.\n\nWatch Archived PresentationsClassroom Resources\n\nJohn Donoghue – Merging Mind to Machines: Brain Computer Interfaces to Restore Lost Function\n\nMartha Farah – 21st-Century Neuroscience: From Lab and Clinic to Home, School, and Office\n\nPaul W.

During the last couple of decades, however, biologists, climatologists, geneticists, mathematicians, and psychologists, among others, have been adding to the scientific database. Using new techniques and state-of-the-art technologies, they have both aided the painstaking work of extracting skeletal remains and artifacts from ancient sites around the world and bolstered the physical findings.\n\nTogether, these scientists have produced a host of exciting, far-reaching discoveries. While they are still debating the exact relationships among the species of hominids, the genus from which modern humans arose, they are getting closer and closer to finding the very first of our kind with research that is rewriting our history and informing us in dramatic ways.\n\nThrough study of mitochondrial DNA and Y chromosomes, for example, molecular biologists and geneticists have traced the birth of modern humans to Africa around 200,000 years ago. They created art and musical instruments, buried their dead, learned to make tools, invented languages, and ventured out. From Africa, they headed to Asia, Europe, and across the seas to the Americas.\n\nFor tens of thousands of years, our forebears coexisted with Neanderthals, who, it turns out, were \"wired\" with the same language gene. While the Neanderthals headed for extinction in the forests, however, scientists recently found humans headed for the beach. Our ancient ancestors discovered the \"basket\" of food along Africa's coastlines and expanded their hunting and gathering skills from woolly mammoths and berries to seals and shellfish at least 167,000 years ago. Learning to harvest marine resources, in fact, just may have enabled them to survive the last ice age, as well as make it to the Americas. Perhaps the most thought provoking \"find\" is how the research has been consistently showing that for all our physical and genetic differences, we are more alike than anyone imagined—and the implications of that are nothing less than profound.\n\nWatch Archived Presentations\n\nRobin Dunbar – Mind the Gap: Why Humans Aren’t Just Great Apes\n\nMarcus Feldman – The History of Migration and Selection Seen through the Human Genome\n\nJ.

The rapid technological advances and prosperity enjoyed in the 20th century were driven by the use of fossil fuels—namely, coal and oil. In the 21st century, however, energy demand and prices are soaring, conflicts threaten political stability in the most oil-rich region of the world, and we are realizing the effects of a rapidly warming planet. In the United States, oil production has been declining since the early 1970s, and dependence on foreign oil continues to increase amid the threat of terrorism arising from the oil-rich Middle East. What will be the energy sources of the future? Several new and exciting technologies are on the horizon, including hydrogen, solar and wind power, biofuels, and advanced nuclear power.\n\nWatch Archived Presentations\n\nSteven Chu (Physics '97) – The World’s Energy Problem and What We Can Do about It\n\nKenneth S.

This year we are celebrating the 100th anniversary of the Nobel Prizes by reflecting on the great discoveries, works of art, and accomplishments in the pursuit of peace that, in the words of Alfred Nobel's will, \"conferred the greatest benefit on mankind.\"\n\nIn a century that produced two world wars, the atomic bomb, and tremendous social upheaval, we've also seen the virtual elimination of once-feared contagious diseases, incomprehensible increases in the speed of transportation, the fall of communism, the elimination of apartheid, and forms of communication completely unimagined by previous generations. As my 80-year-old father put it after marveling at the things he could do with his new computer, “I can't imagine any generation that has lived through more changes than I have,\" He may be right.\n\nGünter Blobel (Medicine '99), John D.

The sudden but quiet collapse of the Soviet Union spelled the apparent demise of an alternative to market capitalism that seemed to some for a time to promise a superior system, and for even longer at least a workable one. This event coincided with and encouraged a major change in thinking around the world concerning models for economic development. And in the world's developed nations, there has been heightened commitment to and movement toward greater economic integration and free trade.\n\nThese events taken together amount to much of what has come to be called \"globalization.\" A world of increasingly interdependent and highly competitive global capitalism seems upon us. Powerful economic institutions, such as The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, have been active in policy formulation and assistance in this transition. Governments in the Americas, Europe, and Asia have undertaken very profound initiatives toward economic integration and much freer trade. And the \"Asian model\" of export-driven development has become the most widely accepted vision of a path to successful development. All of this has not occurred without cost or controversy, as recent events in Seattle and Washington, D.C., attest. Concerns for the environment, for economic equity, for economic and cultural diversity have been voiced, often with force and passion. There is much concern and confusion about just what this new \"global\" era will mean. Even among those who greet this transition with optimism and enthusiasm, there is debate about important practical questions of implementation strategy.\n\nJagdish N.

How does a gene act? and How does a gene change or mutate? Participating scientists discussed studies on bacteria, viruses, and fungi that were promising to reveal the \"solution of the amino acid code.\"\n\nIn the intervening years, much of what was predicted at that conference has come to pass. Today we are able to isolate and clone genes from any organism. We obtain the nucleotide sequence of the identified gene. We reintroduce the gene into the organism. A number of genome projects, of which the Human Genome Project is the largest in size and scope, provide us with information that constitutes the ultimate reductionist view of a living organism. This information is giving us new perspectives on old questions regarding the structure and function of genes, the control of biological processes such as development, and the relationship of species.\n\nThe 35th Nobel Conference, \"Genetics in the New Millennium,\" will examine the emerging areas in genetics and genomics and will attempt to predict anew the long-term effects and applications of these discoveries.\n\nBruce Baker, Professor of Biological Sciences, Stanford University, Professor of Developmental Biology, Stanford University Medical School, Palo Alto, California\n\nThe Molecular Basis of Sex\n\nElizabeth Blackburn, Professor and Chair, Department of Microbiology and Immunology School of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco\n\nTelomerase: Dr. Jekyll or Mr. Hyde?\n\nLindon Eaves, Distinguished Professor, Department of Human Genetics, Medical College of Virginia, Virginia Commonwealth University Richmond, Co-Director, Virginia Institute for Psychiatric and Behavioral Genetics\n\nRevisiting the Biology of Ultimate Concern\n\nDean Hamer, Chief, Section on Gene Structure and Regulation Laboratory of Biochemistry National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland\n\nGenes for Human Behavior\n\nLeroy Hood, William Gates III Professor of Biomedical Sciences, Director of NSF Science and Technology Center, Chair, Department of Molecular Biotechnology School of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle\n\nThe Human Genome Project: Revolutions in Biology, Medicine, and Society\n\nEvelyn Fox Keller, Professor of History and Philosophy of Science, Program in Science, Technology, and Society, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge\n\nNature and Nurture in a Post-Genomic Age\n\nJ.

That may well have been by intent. Until recently, most primate researchers believed that human language was distinct and, as such, was separable from everything nonhuman. That point was well illustrated on the Gustavus campus nearly 30 years ago, when presenters for Nobel Conference® IV, \"The Uniqueness of Man,\" rejected the notion of studying apes in order to learn about humans.\n\nToday, the argument may have turned to support an early theory formed by evolutionist Charles Darwin, who anticipated continuity in mental and behavioral processes among primates. While there are important exceptions, it has become increasingly clear to researchers that animals developed their identities largely through historical cultures, not essential laws of physiology. With that in mind, the study of apes has taken on new importance as a way to better understand the roots of human language and behavior.\n\nThis year, Nobel Conference® XXXII, \"Apes at the End of an Age: Primate Language and Behavior in the '90s,\" has assembled six of the world's finest primatologists to discuss these new and exciting developments in their field. We invite you to join us as we learn about primates on the brink of human consciousness, and how research into their language and behavior holds implications for human intellectual development.\n\nBiruté M.F.

Theorists, the unifiers of science, have traditionally met this challenge by establishing a framework for understanding this experimental diversity.\n\nBut in the past quarter century, this fundamental balance has changed. Much of today's leading technologies have been created with little or no theoretical guidance. For example, while synthetic chemists have created and improved polymers over several decades, they have done so with only limited theoretical constructs for understanding polymer behavior. The discovery of ceramic superconductors in the mid-1980s challenged physicists to reformulate theories developed for metallic superconductors in the 1950s. And today, advances in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, X-ray spectroscopy and atomic resolution microscopy, coupled\n\nwith the wide availability of inexpensive high-speed computing, have enabled organic chemists and biochemists to investigate larger and more complex molecules without a comprehensive theoretical framework for understanding how this new technology could be applied.\n\nDuring Nobel Conference XXXI, \"The New Shape of Matter: Materials Challenge Science,\" an international group of experimental scientists will discuss their work on the cutting edge of scientific creation. The Nobel panel also will include modern-day theorists, who will seek to bring meaning and purpose to these discoveries. We invite you to attend a conference that promises to explore the farthest frontiers of materials science.\n\nPhilip W.

Indeed, the National Science Foundation has declared the 1990s to be the \"Decade of the Brain.\" The 1994 Nobel Conference will offer its audience an opportunity to hear what leading researchers think about how the brain performs its tasks. Emphasis will be placed on how changes in the tools we use to study the brain have heightened our level of understanding.\n\nThe 1994 Nobel speakers will address a number of very interesting questions: Are the connections within the brain fixed at birth, or subject to change with experience? How can a visual image of the activity of the brain improve our understanding of motor control, language, and memory? To what extent can we use a computer as a model for understanding how the brain works? What changes in the brain are associated with diseases such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's? Can these changes be reversed?\n\nWe hope that this conference will demonstrate the fruits of interdisciplinary research efforts, introduce the broad range of questions which challenge those who are trying to understand how the brain works and most of all, increase our appreciation of the human mind. We invite you to attend a conference which we are confident will be both fascinating and stimulating.\n\nAnders Björklund, Neurology Section, University of Lund, Sweden\n\nCell Transplants for Repair of the Damaged Brain\n\nPatricia Smith Churchland, Department of Philosophy, University of California-San Diego\n\nProspects for a Neurobiology of Consciousness\n\nAntonio Damasio, Department of Neurology, College of Medicine, University of Iowa\n\nA Neurobiology for Emotion and Reason\n\nApostolos Georgopoulos, Brain Sciences Center, Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Minneapolis\n\nBehavioral Neurophysiology of the Motor Cortex\n\nDavid Hubel (Medicine '81), Harvard Medical School\n\nEye, Brain and Perception\n\nEric R.

Many environmentally-concerned citizens and political leaders believe that by-products of an industrialized world, including threats to the integrity of nature, diversity of species, or impoverishment of ecosystems, are threatening our environment and, ultimately, the sustainability of all life. Solutions to these problems do not come easily. While the world's environmental problems arise from a combination of political, social and economic factors, long-term solutions must be based on the science of ecology. This science has been working for more than a century to unravel the complexities of the world's natural ecosystems.\n\nIn the past 15 years, however, scientists have learned that disturbances–such as fires and hurricanes–play a natural role in ecosystems. Scientists have also found that the traditional solution of reducing an ecological system to its smallest parts will not explain the behavior of the whole. People all over the world are becoming increasingly interested in ecological issues. During this Nobel Conference, our hope is to raise public awareness about the most recent trends and discoveries in the new ecology.\n\nDaniel B.

Viruses, bacteria, and other trespassers launch regular assaults against the body's immune system, which raises an intricate web of defense to identify and repel these biological invaders.\n\nIn recent years, researchers have slowly begun to unlock the mysteries surrounding how the body's immune system works. Research in molecular biology, for example, has shown that white T-cells are the linchpins of the body's immune system, they also can become a devastating enemy when they malfunction. Scientists also have learned that bacterial molecules called superantigens can overstimulate production of infection-fighting agents, causing more damage to the host than an invading enemy.\n\nWATCH ARCHIVED PRESENTATIONS\n\nBaruj Benacerraf (Medicine '80) – The Requirement of Antigen Processing and Presentation to Initiate Immunologic Response\n\nR.
