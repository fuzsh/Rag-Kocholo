A selection of relevant papers from Physical Review Letters and Reviews in Modern Physics have been made free-to-read.\n\nPatrick Charbonneau, Eric I.

Hell (Max Planck Institute and German Cancer Research Center), and William E. Moerner (Stanford Univerisity) have been recognized for their work in improving the resolution of optical microscopy, in particular the development of a super-resolved fluorescence microscope.\n\n“It’s a great year for optics,” said Pierre Meystre (University of Arizona Regents’ Professor of Physics and Optical Sciences, Physical Review Letters Lead Editor), “with blue LEDs winning the Physics Nobel yesterday and fluorescence microscopy winning the Chemistry prize today. It shows that wonderful things are happening in optics from saving enormous amounts of energy with efficient lighting to helping with life-saving medical advances that rely on super-resolution imaging. They are completely different technologies, but both light-based, and next year is the International Year of Light, so the timing couldn’t be better.”\n\nMany remarkable papers from these scientists contributed to this development. These include Moerner’s seminal 1989 work on optical detection and spectroscopy of single molecules in a solid, which was published in Physical Review Letters. This paper is now freely available on our website.\n\nRead More from APS:\n\nPhysics APS News Update\n\nChemistry APS News Update\n\nAPS Press Release for Chemistry Prize\n\nW. E. Moerner and L.

It transfers copyright for the article to APS, but keeps certain rights for you, the author. We have recently changed the form to add the right to make ‘‘derivative works’’ that reuse parts of the article in a new work. The importance of this change is discussed below.\n\nRead More\n\nEDITORIAL\n\nAnnouncement: New Prices and Payment Policy for Color Figures in the Print Journal\n\nEffective with manuscripts accepted for publication on or after July 1, 2007, APS will charge for publishing color figures in the print journal according to a simplified, flat-fee pricing scheme. The price for publishing a single color illustration will be US$800.00. Each subsequent color figure in that article will cost US$425.00.\n\nThis new fee structure will allow APS to streamline our operations by requiring advance payment for color charges. When an article is accepted for publication, the authors will receive confirmation of the amount due for color reproduction in the print journal. A formal invoice will follow this message within a few days of acceptance, together with payment instructions. The manuscript will not be forwarded to our composition vendor for publication until the invoice is paid, or a decision is made to publish the article without color in print. To avoid excessive delays in publication, if a response is not received within two weeks, the article will be sent to production with the figures designated as color online only. Publication charges and reprint charges will be invoiced separately, after publication of the article.\n\nOf course, APS continues to make available the option of publishing color figures in the online journal only without cost to the authors (provided the figures are submitted according to APS guidelines). Please refer to http://authors.aps.org/tips.html for more information about color online only.\n\nRead More\n\nANNOUNCEMENT\n\nChange in Printing Schedule to Synchronize Online and Print Journals\n\nReviews of Modern Physics is synchronizing the online and print journal so that, beginning in January 2006, the quarterly print issues will contain all papers published online in a given quarter (i.e., 1 January - 31 March, 1 April - 30 June, etc.). Therefore, the first printed 2006 issue will be mailed near the end of April, not in January.\n\nThis rearrangement is necessary to avoid citation ambiguities currently caused when articles are published online at the end of one calendar year and appear in print journals dated with the next calendar year.\n\nIn the future, issues will be labeled by the quarter in which the articles are published online, rather than the month in which the print issue is distributed; for example, the first issue of the year will now be labeled \"papers published January - March,\" and will be distributed a few weeks after the end of the quarter.\n\nPrint subscribers to Volumes 77 and 78 will receive four issues per volume as usual, though the Volume 78 issues will arrive on a later schedule.\n\nRead More"
