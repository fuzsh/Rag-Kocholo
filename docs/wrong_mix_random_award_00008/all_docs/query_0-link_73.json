        "text": "Our list has one mission: to empower readers to improve their lives. This is self-help for a new generation, encompassing everything from mental health and family/relationships to creativity, social justice, and more, along with journals for the inner explorer, and a few “odd ones” for the quirky teen in us all.\n\nFrom beloved classics like The Artist’s Way, Attached, and A Mind for Numbers to essential new favorites including Set Boundaries, Find Peace, Raising Critical Thinkers, and Anxiously Attached, our list is diverse, engaging, and full of empowering takeaway for living our best lives.\n\nTarcherPerigee’s authors range from renowned experts and powerful online voices to emerging artists –each with a unique perspective that speaks to the reader where they are.\n\nTarcherPerigee can be found online at @TarcherPerigee on Instagram, Twitter and Facebook.\n\nTracy Behar, SVP and Publisher of Avery and TarcherPerigee, joined Penguin in 2024. She was previously at Little, Brown and Company, where she served as VP, Publisher, and Editor in Chief of the imprint she founded, Little, Brown Spark.\n\nShe publishes in the categories of health, psychology, self-help, science, nature, and reference, and her roster of authors includes Mark Hyman, Andrew Weil, David Perlmutter, Kerry Washington, Daniel Kahneman, Nicholas Christakis, Sue Johnson, John Ratey, William Sears, and Roy Peter Clark. Many of her books have been #1 bestsellers and have garnered awards, including the PEN/E. O. Wilson Literary Science Writing Award, the Dayton Literary Peace Prize, the J. Anthony Lukas Book Prize, and Books for a Better Life.\n\nLindsay Gordon is the Associate Publisher and Director of Marketing and Publicity for both Avery and TarcherPerigee. She has spent her career promoting and publicizing non-fiction authors and their books. As Associate Publisher Lindsay oversees all of the customized publicity and marketing campaigns aimed towards securing as much media as possible and effectively getting the books in front of consumers in new and innovative ways.\n\nLindsay has overseen and worked on the campaigns of numerous New York Times and national bestselling titles, including Atomic Habits by James Clear, Good Energy by Dr. Casey Means, The Book of Joy by His Holiness the Dalai Lama and Archbishop Desmond Tutu, The Myth of Normal by Dr. Gabor Maté, The Oh She Glows Cookbook by Angela Liddon, Shabbat by Adeena Sussman, The XX Brain by Dr. Lisa Mosconi, Set Boundaries, Find Peace and Drama Free by Nedra Glover Tawwab, The Odd 1s Out by James Rallison and Unwinding Anxiety by Dr. Jud Brewer. Prior to joining Penguin Lindsay worked at the Doubleday Broadway Publishing Group at Random House, Inc.\n\nAs Editor-in-Chief of the TarcherPerigee imprint, I’m lucky to be immersed in a rich, long-lived list that empowers readers to improve their lives and find their way, spanning the areas of mental health, creativity, self-reflection, social justice, and gift/inspiration.\n\nI work with a wide range of authors – from credentialed experts to emerging illustrators – who bring fresh perspective and broader representation to these categories. My recent and bestselling authors include Nedra Glover Tawwab, Meera Lee Patel, Adam J. Kurtz, Scott Barry Kaufman, Whitney Goodman, Minaa B., Britt Frank, and many others.\n\nTo speak to an audience that’s diverse in every way, the books on my list include guided journals like Burn After Writing, Start Where You Are, and Create Your Own Calm as well as more traditional guides like Set Boundaries, Find Peace, Drama Free, and Toxic Positivity – along with card decks and workbooks. Each one is published with hands-on attention with the goal of being both timely and timeless, with a robust launch as well as healthy backlist sales.\n\nFrom my first acquisition here back in 2004 (The Cloudspotter’s Guide by Gavin Pretor-Pinney—still in print!), I’ve focused on finding fresh new voices and ideas that speak to readers where they are.\n\nLauren Appleton has been at TarcherPerigee since 2012, where she acquires a wide range of self-improvement titles, mainly for Millennials and Gen-Z.\n\nShe is particularly interested in the areas of inspiration/motivation, pop-psychology, creativity, social justice, female empowerment, and anything that will improve your life or simply make you smile. A large portion of her list includes illustrated gift books, journals, and other interactive activity books.\n\nAuthors she has worked with include James Rallison (New York Times bestselling author of The Odd 1s Out series), Vexx (Creatopia), Sergei Urban (The Dad Lab), Alice Boyes (The Anxiety Toolkit, The Healthy Mind Toolkit, and Stress-Free Productivity), Benjamin Lorr (The Secret Life of Groceries) and Erin Lowry (Broke Millennial series).\n\nLauren O’Neal joined TarcherPerigee in early 2023 and is looking to acquire a range of books in the practical nonfiction space. She is particularly interested in books about mental health and psychology, neurodiversity (ADHD and autism), spirituality and religion, nature, and language, as well as workbooks and guided journals.\n\nPrior to working at TarcherPerigee, Lauren was an editor at SoHo Publishing and at Callisto Media, where she worked on a wide variety of projects, from Bible studies to cookbooks and everything in between. She has also been on the editorial staff at literary websites like Midnight Breakfast, the Rumpus, and Catapult. Originally from California, she has a BA in English from Stanford University and an MFA in creative writing from San Francisco State University.\n\nEditor Hannah Steigmeyer joined Avery and TarcherPerigee in 2017 with a focus on nonfiction in the accessible science and health & wellness space.\n\nShe has a special interest in novel entrepreneurial approaches to science, technology, health, and business. Her upcoming books include Fasting Cancer by Valter Longo, PhD, Adaptable by Herman Pontzer, PhD, and Booster Shots by Adam Ratner, MD. She’s edited The Real Body Manual, The Complete Book of Pickleball, Secrets of Giants, Giving Hope, Fuel the Fire, and Prescription for Nutritional Healing, 6th edition and has worked with James Clear (New York Times bestseller Atomic Habits), Gabor Maté, MD (New York Times bestseller The Myth of Normal), Kelly McGonigal, PhD (The Joy of Movement), Judson Brewer, MD, PhD (New York Times bestseller Unwinding Anxiety), and Michael Oher (When Your Back’s Against the Wall).\n\nShe grew up in Fort Wayne, Indiana and graduated from Kenyon College where she double majored in English and Anthropology and minored in Russian Language and Literature."
