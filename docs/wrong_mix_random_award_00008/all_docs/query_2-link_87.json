        "text": "Good Monday Morning Team Northside,\n\nI know how exciting this final week of school will be, so I will be very brief. As I reflect on the school year, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to our entire TEAM! It seems like just yesterday we were celebrating the kickoff with Convocation and now we are preparing to wrap things up and graduate over 7,000 Seniors with our commencement ceremonies this week and next. There have been so many accomplishments and celebrations it is hard to define how proud I am of our students, staff, and dedicated employees- all of whom make it happen each and every day! You all have contributed to the overall success of our Awesome School District and words can not begin to express my appreciation.\n\nJust recently we celebrated the nine years of dedicated service of Trustee Gerald Lopez and welcomed Dr. Homer Guevara to the Board; the Trustees approved a 2% general pay increase and retention bonus to be paid in June; and witnessed amazing feats by our students (O’Connor baseball Regional Finalists, our World Champions Destination Imagination team from Briscoe Middle School, the Brain Ninjas from Helotes Elementary School, the Blue Aces Unarmed Drill Team from Brandeis High School winning yet another National Championship, an amazing GT showcase, etc). We have so many exceptional accomplishments, that it’s difficult to list them all. Congratulations to all!\n\nI sincerely hope you all find the opportunity to unplug and recharge your batteries over the next several weeks! As I have stated, it is essential to take care of yourselves and your loved ones during this downtime (well, slower time.) While many of us will be hard at work making preparations for the upcoming school year, it is equally important for those focused on the 2024-2025 school year to also find time to rejuvenate as time permits.\n\nThis August, we will be kicking off with Convocations on August 13 and 14 celebrating NISD’s 75th Anniversary and the rich heritage and traditions our district has established over that timeframe. It should be an incredible celebration of excellence, and we intend to have a lot of fun, so be prepared to laugh and enjoy the experience.\n\nThank you again Team Northside. Finish strong and enjoy your well-deserved summer!\n\nThe Spirit of Northside.\n\nThis week the Spirit Stick goes to Team Northside! You have and will continue to provide amazing experiences for our students as we continue to Transform the Learning Experience!\n\nGod Bless, Great Job and we will see you very soon!\n\nJohn M. Craft\n\nSuperintendent of Schools\n\nNorthside Independent School District\n\nGood Morning Team,\n\nI hope you were able to get out and enjoy the bountiful sunshine this weekend. I think it is safe to say warmer weather is upon us. This upcoming weekend we will be enjoying a much-needed three-day weekend with the recognition of Memorial Day on Monday.\n\nAs a free Nation, we will continue to celebrate the last Monday of May, as this occasion holds significant cultural and historical importance, serving as a poignant reminder of the bravery and selflessness displayed by countless individuals throughout American history. Originally known as Decoration Day, Memorial Day traces its origins back to the aftermath of the Civil War. In the spring of 1865, as the nation grappled with the profound loss of life from the conflict, communities across the United States began holding ceremonies to honor fallen soldiers by decorating their graves with flowers and other tributes. Over time, this practice evolved into the national observance we recognize today. Please join me in saluting our Nation’s heroes for their sacrifices ensuring we continue to thrive as a Free Democracy. Thank you again to all our service men and women and veterans.\n\nFrom Around the District\n\nLeadership Northside. We had a great meeting with our Leadership Northside cohort on Monday at the Northside Activity Center. The group had the chance to learn about the plethora of opportunities we provide students throughout the district including JROTC, Fine Arts, CTE, STEM, Athletics, and so much more. I want to give a special thanks to our directors, assistant directors, and staff who helped support the event by providing pertinent information and promoting these amazing programs. We look forward to the next meeting with our community supporters next month.\n\nO’Connor High School Theatre Arts. This weekend, O’Connor HS thespians traveled to the Austin ISD Performing Arts Center to perform “Amadeus,” at the State UIL One-Act Play competition. This is the first time in school history to advance to state, having placed first in five contests before advancing to the State level . When all was said and done, the HS theater students came out sixth in the state. Great job O’Connor!\n\nASTA/FFA Banquet. The NISD Agriculture Science and Technology Academy once again celebrated the success of our Ag. Science students and Future Farmers of America on Thursday at the C.E. Vickery Agriculture Multipurpose Building. It was great to see the Board of Directors and proud parents who graciously acknowledged our hard-working students through the awards and scholarships provided. I want to again acknowledge Principal Chad Bohlken, Associate Principal Tom Johnson, and Program Coordinator Bryan Hawkins for their hard work in leading our students. The FFA student Officers did a superb job leading the entire program and of course, we are so thankful for our hardworking Ag teachers for their tremendous efforts and time invested in our FFA and Agriculture students. Congratulations to our scholarship recipients and graduating seniors and we wish our newly installed FFA Officers all the best as they take the helm next year.\n\nConnally Middle School Second Chance Academy. We had the opportunity to visit the alternative Second Chance Academy housed at Connally Middle School on Friday. Honorable Judge Sid Harle, 4th Administrative Judicial Region, drove in from a hearing in Houston to visit with the students emphasizing making good decisions and the impact of mistakes in electing not to. He had a very powerful, down-to-earth message that really resonated with the students. It made me proud to see the positive impact this program has had on our youth and special thanks to Principal Andrew Drumm and the Connally Middle School staff for their relentless efforts to make a difference in the lives of students needing a second chance.\n\nCommunities in Schools Luncheon- CIS held its annual community supporter luncheon and it was a packed venue as our very own Electra Ramirez from Jay HS told her heart-wrenching story of never losing hope and tackling adversity head-on, regardless of how difficult the struggle was. Watch this video to hear her story in her own words. It serves as a reminder to always push forward and maintain HOPE. We could not be more proud of Electra.\n\nStoryfest. The Northside Activity Center was busy as a mouse house on Saturday morning as our Library Services Team hosted a full slate of fun activities for students to engage in and provided a plethora of literature for students to take home. We had the pleasure of hosting acclaimed author Laura Numeroff who has written several children’s books including one of my all-time favorites “If You Give a Mouse a Cookie.” It was great to see over 400 families and students attend the event and a special shout-out goes to our amazing librarians and staff who worked so hard to make the event so special.\n\nGood Morning Team Northside!\n\nFirst and foremost, I hope you all had a wonderful Mother’s Day weekend. Thank you again to all of our Northside ISD moms who not only give so caringly to the students they serve but also work tirelessly to care for their own children.\n\nThis week, we are recognizing Peace Officer Memorial Day and Police Recognition Week. Across the United States, we take time to pay tribute to the local, state, and federal peace officers who have died, or who have been disabled, in the line of duty. It is officially celebrated on May 15 each year. I know I have mentioned it, but we are so fortunate to have our own NISD Police Department who protect and serve in the best interest of our entire team and community. Their service is to be commended as our first responders and they remain such a vital part of our overall safety initiative. Thank you to Chief Charlie Carnes and our amazing officers. You continue to have such a positive impact on the entire district!\n\nFrom Around the District\n\nSolar Car Races. I wanted to circle back and brag about our students and faculty who participated in the Annual Solar Car Races on the 27th. While I was not able to attend due to our H-E-B Excellence in Education event held in Houston that weekend, I was receiving updates and the event went off without a hitch even due to lack of sunshine. The solar car event continues to serve as a venue for students to design and build miniature solar-powered cars while learning essential design, engineering, and harnessing alternative energy capabilities.\n\nWe had over 270 elementary and middle school teams, and 1,036 students competing with three or four students on each team. Approximately 46 elementary schools and 15 middle schools participated this year.\n\nAfter preliminary heats, semifinals, and a final race; awards were handed out to champions in the elementary and middle school divisions. We want to thank all of our sponsors and staff who, once again, worked so diligently to make this year's event a huge success!\n\nThe results are:\n\nMiddle School Race Results\n\n1st Place\n\nHobby Pasramchos\n\n2nd Place\n\nHobby Lightning McQueen's\n\n3rd Place\n\nHobby Ghost Riders\n\n4th Place\n\nHobby Solar Speeders\n\n5th Place\n\nGarcia GG Currus Unus\n\n6th Place\n\nJefferson Solar Sigmas\n\n7th Place\n\nGarcia GG Currus Quattor\n\n8th Place\n\nGarcia GG Currus Duo\n\nElementary School Race Results\n\n1st Place\n\nCarson Red Hornets\n\n2nd Place\n\nBlattman The Predators\n\n3rd Place\n\nElrod Solar Creators\n\n4th Place\n\nEsparza The Jetz\n\n5th Place\n\nHenderson The Racers Chicks\n\n6th Place\n\nMeadow Village Bobcat Rockets\n\n7th Place\n\nBehlau Bull Rushers\n\n8th Place\n\nScobee Blazing Stars\n\nCarlos Coon Elementary School Career Day. NISD Board President Bobby Blount and I had the opportunity to visit with Carlos Coon 5th grade students this past Thursday to describe the teamwork that guides the work across the district. While it was a very quick overview, it was once again great to field the questions in our young students' minds. From “Do we have animals in the district?” (which I had to think about until it came to me that our canine units qualified as a sufficient answer) to “Why don’t we pay students to come to school each day?” Admittedly, the latter made Mr. Blount and I pause and really process this question because I don’t think we had either really thought about attendance from that perspective. We want to Thank Principal Jessica Lundquist, Ms. Eva Barrientos, and the entire Carlos Coon ES staff and presenters for making the event such an engaging learning opportunity for our students.\n\nProject A.C.O.R.N. NISD hosted the third Annual Project A.C.O.R.N. event at O’Connor High School on Saturday and I was informed it was a tremendous turnout once again. This project teaches environmental science principles and promotes eco-friendly awareness by providing hands-on, project-based learning experiences. We want to again extend our appreciation to all our teachers, staff, and volunteers for their hard work and efforts throughout the year in shaping and forging pathways for our students to experience ways to better take care of our ecosystem. Great Job once again!\n\nWelcome to the Month of May Team Northside!\n\nThis week we will first and foremost be celebrating Teacher Appreciation Week. This remains a week set aside for honoring our amazing educators who remain our core business. The week-long celebration is the culmination of a 40-year push to establish a national teacher appreciation day, which was eventually established in 1953 by Congress. Since then we have been taking time to celebrate our teachers' hard work, dedication, and service. Teaching is so much more complex than it was in 1953, and I will argue it remains one of the toughest professions out there. Thank you NISD Teachers and please join me in expressing our gratitude this week.\n\nWe will also be celebrating NISD Substitute Educators Week as we also show our appreciation to our amazing substitute teachers. The work substitute teachers do is instrumental in maintaining instructional continuity in the absence of the permanent teacher. Substitute teachers walk into classrooms each day across the district unsure of what material they are going to teach, or what students they will be interacting with, and they do so willingly and with a smile on their faces. They remain some of the unsung heroes of education and so we applaud their efforts this week as well.\n\nNational School Nurse’s Day is Wednesday, May 8 and we couldn’t be more proud to celebrate the hard work of our Nurses across the district. Our school nurses support the health and educational success of children and youth by providing access to care while ensuring all students' physical and mental health needs are continuously met while at school. Our nurses play a pivotal role while ensuring students and (adults in many cases) are healthy, safe, and well-prepared to take on the challenges of the day. Working in isolation on most occasions, they quietly go about caring for and lifting up those needing aid, and do so selflessly daily. Thank you to all our School Nurses for all you do!\n\nPlease help me in recognizing these special individuals this week!\n\nOn Tuesday, April 29, the Board voted to appoint Dr. Homer Guevara as the Single Member District 2 Trustee to replace outgoing Trustee Gerald Lopez who will be assuming his role serving on the Board of the Alamo Colleges later this month. Dr. Guevara has served on the CPS Energy Board and is a Professor at Northwest Vista Colleges. With his children having been educated in Northside and his participation in the Leadership Northside cohort this year, we are excited to welcome Dr. Guevara as he takes the oath of office later this month.\n\nFrom Around the District\n\nEmpower Schools Visits CAST Teach. Empower schools is a National nonprofit that partners with communities to develop sustainable solutions that improve student success at school and in life. They help partners organize structures and conditions that empower the educators, innovations, and improvements sought. It was great to visit with professionals from such diverse communities and to be able to share our very innovative program at CAST TEACH and Stevens High School. The highlight of the event was our panel of students, moderated by Trustee Carol Harle, who described their experiences and articulated their passion for becoming a future educator. I know I am biased, but the panelists knocked it out of the park and made me want to immediately hire them. Special thanks to the Empower Schools members in attendance and congratulations to CAST TEACH staff and students on their accomplishments and work that continues to drive our Mission of transforming the learning experience for students each day!\n\nBrandeis Independent Study Mentorship. Brandeis High School hosted their annual ISM Presentation Night and it was amazing. The students presenting their projects and experiences were nothing short of amazing. The presentations included a culmination of their experiences through a variety of volunteerism entailing professions of their individual passions. I did not get to every room Wednesday night, but the several students I had the pleasure of observing really demonstrated just how hard they worked over the course of the year as well as their grit, dedication, and will to make a difference in our society. For example, Cameron Hughes presented entrepreneurship entailing her work with Elbow Room, a tiny home company here in San Antonio that prides itself on eco-friendly sustainable living spaces. Emily Villasenor described her journey in working alongside mentor Celeste Broerman as a Physicians Assistant. Victoria Xu was mentored by Mark Jordan at Clark Hill Law Firm and had the opportunity to learn all about Civil Law and the court system. Ashtyn Perez completed her ISM project at our very own Reddix Center, and explained how physical therapy is applied in the educational setting and more importantly, the positive effects the work has on children. Kaitlyn Reyes was mentored by Dr. Amy Robinson, one of the veterinarians with MissionVet also in San Antonio. Kaitlyn even created two “how to” books explaining the essentials associated with cat care. I was so impressed by the students’ ability to articulate and communicate their experiences and I could not have been more proud of their accomplishments. I do want to give a special thanks to our amazing teachers for their support and guidance as well as the amazing mentors for providing the environment for our future workforce to thrive. Great job students and I can’t wait to witness your success in the very near future!\n\n100th NISD Food Bank Distribution. On Friday, Northside ISD hosted its 100th Food Bank event at Gustafson Stadium. Attaining this benchmark has been the result of dedicated volunteers and the support of so many students/groups stepping up to the plate to give back to those in need. It remains unfortunate that the need continues to exist, but I couldn’t be more proud of NISD answering the call repeatedly. Thank you to Don Schmidt, Calvin Buchholtz, and our Whole Child Department for your service to our community and H.E.B. for continuing to help our families.\n\nHappy Monday Team Northside,\n\nI hope this message finds you well and rested after an extended Fiesta Weekend full of celebrations and festivities. The Battle of Flowers was once again a lot of fun and seeing our marching bands shine this past weekend was a great reminder of the significant role our students play in supporting our community. Thank you again to all who supported this year’s Fiesta parades, celebrations, and learning opportunities both on and off campuses. It was a great time to be had by all and even Mother Nature cooperated for most of the weekend. Thank you to all who worked so hard to support our students to make this year’s Fiesta such a success!\n\nIt is hard to believe we are already preparing to close out the month of April, but this week we will be celebrating our hardworking Campus Principals on Wednesday, May 1 with National Principal Recognition Day. I believe you will agree that our Principals set the culture and tone of the school, make student drop-off and pick-up run as efficiently as possible, and hire and grow the best staff members for the benefit of students (and so much more)! When you have the chance, please be sure to catch your Principal and let them know how much they are appreciated. Thank you again to our Campus Principals and we hope you enjoy your special day of recognition, you have earned it!\n\nWe will also be celebrating our hard working school nutrition staff with National School Lunch Heroes Day on Friday, May 3. We remain so blessed to have such a hard working team of professionals who begin their day well before our students are waking up each morning. They provide the fuel our students and staff need to be successful each day, (faster than a speeding bullet I might add) and do so with a sense of pride and dedication that often goes unnoticed. Thank you again to our School Nutrition Professionals and you deserve more than a SuperHero appreciation! Please join me in appreciating our School Lunch Heroes this week!\n\nFrom Around the District\n\nLunch with Steubing Elementary 2nd Grade Students. It’s not every day I get to sit down and have lunch with second grade students, and what a treat it was. I learned so much about what goes on in our second graders' lives. We had the opportunity to discuss their school day, birthday parties, swimming, gymnastics, and so much more. They were really interested in my job, which admittedly, I think I fumbled in trying to explain it to 8 and 9 year-olds. Karlee, Reagan, and Cori were such a breath of fresh air. I especially appreciated the fact that they agreed we should eat our chocolate chip cookies before our chicken nuggets and waffle fries. (We agreed we wouldn't tell our parents, so please keep this on the down low.) Thank you to the Steubing PTA for arranging the amazing experience and to our students for the great laughs. It made my week!\n\nNorthside Communications Network. We had our final NCN meeting with our Elementary and Secondary Representatives from across the district. I have greatly benefited from the discourse throughout the year, as we continue to work to continuously improve across all aspects of the district. This opportunity also allows me to gain a lot of intel and gauge the pulse of our Team through the panel questions and forum discussions. Please take a moment to review the presentations and Q&A from NCN published from each meeting. I want to express my gratitude to our Campus Representatives for taking the time out of their busy lives to participate and share their thoughts. We look forward to picking up the work next year as teacher voice is extremely important for us to best be able to support positive district growth. Thanks again!\n\nNorthside Technology Services- Kelly Smith Tour. I have mentioned that there are so many things that happen behind the scenes to make sure operations run smoothly and our customers remain satisfied (as much as possible.) One of these departments supports the platform that we would not likely be able to function without. This past week, Board President Bobby Blount and Vice President Corinne Saldana had the opportunity to tour Kelly Smith Technology Services Center. Tanya Harris, Leann Kidd, Kris Trejo, and Gary Dennis, who is the Lori Jones Service Award Recipient for 2024 btw, provided us an amazing overview of the complexities supporting IT infrastructure, security, hardware, project management, and training associated with making it all “click.” They perform amazing teamwork every day to ensure our users are supported and have seamless access to the power of technology. Keep up the great work NISD Tech Services, we greatly appreciate you!\n\nO’Connor High School One Act Play Advances to State. Congratulations to our Panthers Theater students and Director Michael Arellno for their Regional Performance of Amadeus. Not only did they manage to advance to this year’s UIL State Competition, but they also scored all 1’s with their stellar performance. Congratulations to O’Connor High School and we wish you the Best of Luck at State!\n\nGood Morning Team Northside,\n\nI hope you had a nice weekend and were able to navigate the weather safely. While Saturday failed to provide the proper weather conditions for our Annual Solar Car races (make-up date scheduled for May 4th), it ended up clearing and being a pretty nice afternoon on Sunday. We will be experiencing a shorter week with not having school on Friday so that students and families can enjoy the Battle of Flowers. Speaking of parades, Fiesta is in full swing and I hope you enjoy the festivities with Friends and Family members this week.\n\nWhile the week will be a shorter one, we will be celebrating and applauding the hard work of many across the district. To begin, we want to thank all of our Volunteers this week who help make our operations run so smoothly. Without their dedication and servant leadership, we would not be able to provide the level of service to our students and families. We are also celebrating our After-school professionals this week for their hard work and all they do to support students beyond the regular school day. Thank you to our Learning Tree Staff and others for all you do! Along with Public School Volunteer Week and After School Professionals Week, we want to salute our amazing Bus Drivers as Tuesday is National School Bus Driver Day as well as all of our amazing Administrative Assistants across the district. Wednesday is Administrative Professionals Day, so please take the time to appreciate these fine individuals when you have an opportunity.\n\nAround the District\n\nNorthside Museum Association Luncheon. It was great to catch up with our Northside Museum Association volunteers and retirees last Tuesday. It is always a fun group, and great to catch up with so many who paved the way across Northside ISD. I am amazed at how supportive and involved our Northside retirees remain, and I look forward to the next luncheon. Trustees Karen Freeman, Vice President Corinne Saldana, President Bobby Blount, and I really enjoyed seeing so many friendly smiles and sharing some laughs.\n\nCAFE - School Connect. We had the opportunity to engage with School Connect SA which works to empower schools to be the best version of themselves by building a bridge between the school and the community - nurturing partnerships between schools, businesses, and faith-based communities. It was great to see all the community partners and volunteers and the collaboration and discourse across tables. The CAFE event reminded me of the power of teamwork, but also how pulling resources together can have such a positive cumulative effect. Thanks again to Margaret Judson, the Executive Director for such an excellent Community and Family Engagement Event, and thanks again to all who participated. Teamwork at its best!\n\nJohn Jay Ribbon Cutting. If you heard a rock concert resembling a very close rendition of the Trans Siberian Orchestra on Thursday, it was actually the electric strings students at John Jay High School as they celebrated the opening of their new Fine Arts facility and auditorium. The students did a great job leading the event and we could not be more excited for the Mustangs and their new addition. Our Architect, Jerry Lammers, and contractor Gary Joeris with Joeris Construction did an absolutely amazing job. If you get a chance to swing by and see the beautiful facility, Principal Terry Cuellar and the Jay staff would love to show it off. Great job Mustangs and we hope you enjoy your new facility for many years to come.\n\nNISD Fine Arts Exhibit. The NISD Sports Gym played host to our Annual Fine Arts Exhibit Friday and Saturday, and what an awesome spectacle to witness so many incredibly talented artists’ work on display. I had the opportunity to select some special pieces to receive a special acknowledgment, and it was really tough to select amongst so many amazing pieces. I want to again Thank our amazing Fine Arts Department staff and all of our campus art teachers for your extra efforts and for making this year's Fine Arts Exhibit such a special event once again.\n\nRegional Track Athletes Advance to the State Meet. We want to congratulate the following track athletes who have advanced to the 6A State meet held at the Mike A. Myers Stadium in Austin later this week. Great job and we wish you the best of luck at State!\n\nI'yanna Webb Harlan Girls Long Jump 19-08.75 First Place\n\nI'yanna Webb Harlan Girls Triple Jump 41-10.75 First Place - 6A Region IV Record\n\nHarlan Boys 4x100 41.21 First Place\n\nGivori Graham, Anthony Durojaiye, Payton Matthews, Tate Taylor\n\nI’yanna Webb Harlan Girls 100m Hurdles 14.33 Second Place\n\nTate Taylor Harlan Boys 100m dash 10.37 First Place\n\nNick Ross Warren Boys 100m dash 10.50 Second Place\n\nHarlan Girls 4 x 200m 1:40.00 Second Place\n\nAva Salas, Addison Shumate, I'yanna Webb, Toryn Taylor\n\nShyniece Davis John Jay Girls 400m 55.38 Second Place\n\nElijah Hernandez Sotomayor Boys 400m 47.09 First Place - 6A Region IV Record\n\nJa'Dan Keiler Taft Boys 300m Hurdles 37.06 First Place\n\nNick Ross Warren Boy 200m dash 20.95 First Place\n\nTate Taylor Harlan Boys 200m dash 21.19 Second Place\n\nWaylon McKenzie - O'Connor - Discus - 1st place: 169'-1\"\n\nThe Spirit of Northside. Seeing that this Wednesday is National Administrative Professionals' Day and we will be recognizing the professionals who keep our offices and the district running smoothly every day, please join me in passing along the NISD Spirit Stick as we say Thank you from the Bottom of our Hearts!\n\nI hope you have a great week Team Northside. Viva Fiesta and please have a safe and enjoyable upcoming weekend.\n\nJohn M. Craft\n\nSuperintendent of Schools\n\nNorthside Independent School District\n\nGood Morning Team Northside,\n\nI hope you had a great weekend. There were plenty of activities transpiring across the district to enjoy, and of course, if you just enjoyed seeing a beautiful landscape and very skilled golfers, the Masters at Augusta didn’t disappoint.\n\nThe Eclipse. First, I would like to take a moment to brag about all the great learning opportunities our students were provided across the district as Monday’s Eclipse presented itself. Although the cloud coverage made it challenging to experience the full vantage, the students at Leon Valley Elementary School still had a great time and we were able to see some of the event as clouds would temporarily break.\n\nI also want to thank the Lighthouse Project and the team leader of teachers with students with Visual Impairments, Danielle Gonzalez. Our visually impaired students were able to engage in a unique experience like never before. With cutting-edge technology, the eclipse was transformed into sound waves, providing a truly immersive and inclusive opportunity for our students.\n\nThrough the relentless perseverance of the entire VI Department, our district was fortunate enough to receive one of 900 devices requested by thousands from Harvard University’s Astrophysics Department. Our NSITE Magnet Program played a pivotal role in sharing this experience with other students across the district. What an incredible example of Teamwork and collaboration across our district allowing Northside to once again lead groundbreaking opportunities, making moments special for all students regardless of the challenges presented.\n\nThanks again to all who made the rare event so special. It will be one staff and students remember for years to come.\n\nNext School Year’s Preliminary Fiscal Budget Presented. On Tuesday night we had the opportunity to present a very preliminary Fiscal Year 2025 (next school year) budget. We took a deep dive into enrollment trends and average daily attendance rates, which remain major budget drivers. We also discussed the anticipated reduction in revenue to SHARS funding and the impact of ESSER Federal recovery dollars expiring this September. We also discussed a broad overview of what pay increases could entail. Although no final decisions were made on Tuesday, we wanted the Board to have access to quite a bit of information as we begin answering questions in the coming weeks. Unfortunately, we are not unlike most, if not all, school Districts across the State who are looking to adopt a deficit budget this year. As a result of the most recent legislative (88th) session concluding without any meaningful increase in funding to support public education, we will have several challenges to navigate this budget season. The Board remains committed to making competitive pay a priority and we will continue to work hard to ensure our budget is reflective of our District goals and values.\n\nChild Abuse Prevention Month. The month of April continues to be a reminder that we can all play a pivotal role in preventing child abuse. All communities benefit when children and families are well supported and safe, and if all community members work together to ensure all children have positive experiences and families have the resources they need well before they are presented with a crisis, abuse can be curtailed. Please continue to join us in recognizing the month of April as Child Abuse Prevention Month and make the pledge to always work to protect students against all forms of abuse. Our collaborative efforts can make a significant difference in working to eradicate child neglect and abuse.\n\nMonth of the Military Child. April is also the Month of the Military Child and Monday will serve as Purple Up for Military Kids Day. Military members and military-connected families make many sacrifices for the security and safety of our nation, specifically military-connected children during their PK-12 career. Across the nation and Northside ISD, we will celebrate the important role military children play, while their service member parents serve our country. We thank all of our parents and staff who serve our great Nation and I encourage you to demonstrate this appreciation through special events and wearing the color purple this Month.\n\nSTUCO Wins Big. We have a few notable accolades and shout-outs this past week as our students continue to accomplish great feats. The National Association of Student Councils (NASC), recognized Sandra Day O'Connor and Marshall High School Student Councils as a 2024 National Gold Council of Excellence (NCOE)!\n\nWinning the National Gold Council of Excellence Award is a testament to the highest standards of quality, leadership, innovation, and community engagement that your council consistently demonstrates in its operation, and its projects and activities. NASC’s National Gold Councils of Excellence are the models of quality for which other student councils nationwide should strive to become. Congratulations to the Panthers and Rams STUCOs!\n\nNational Middle School Art Teacher, Larry West Recognized. Also, The National Art Education Association has a special network focused on promoting the merits of Choice-Based Art and the rewards of teaching students the practice and performance of artistic behaviors. Globally, this trend has contributed to allowing for greater student choice and voice through the artistic process. Congratulations to Rayburn Middle School Art teacher, Larry West, for being honored as the 2024 National Middle School Choice Based Art Educator. Way to represent Northside ISD Larry!\n\nNorthside Education Foundation Donor Appreciation Night. We had the opportunity to celebrate with our NEF Donors on Thursday night as our CAST Teach program served as our gracious host. We are so grateful for the unwavering support our Donors provide which has enabled us to provide funding for our teachers to reach beyond their classroom budgets. Thanks again to our Trustees, NEF Board of Directors and staff, CAST Teach High School, and all who came out to support this great event.\n\nScarborough Elementary STAAR Pep Rally. I once again had the opportunity to serve as a guest judge this year at the STAAR Pep Rally at Scarborough Elementary School. We could feel the energy the moment we walked in the door. The teacher's performances and “lip singing” once again raised the bar this year. While the Husky Pre-K team had a strong performance, it came down to the wire once again this year between the Discovery Team teachers and First Grade. Thankfully School Namesake Evelyn Scarborough helped the judges’ panel identify the winner. Congratulations to the Husky First Grade Team! Something tells me you may have to work hard to defend your title next year! It was a great time once again and Thanks to Ms. Sandra Luna and the Husky Staff for a great time and being vulnerable to help motivate our students!\n\nArea Track Athletes Advance. On Wednesday evening, our Northside athletes competed in the Districts 29 and 30-6A District Area Track and Field meet held at Heroes Stadium. The top four in each event will advance to the Regional Meet next Friday, April 19, and Saturday, April 20 held at Heroes Stadium. Please see attached track results. Congratulations to our Regional Qualifiers. We also want to congratulate both the Harlan Hawks Lady tracksters and the Brennan Bears Boys as they were crowned the Area Meet Champions! Awesome job and best of luck.\n\nThe Spirit of Northside. This week was once again almost impossible to deliver the Spirit Stick to a single recipient. So as a result, there are two Northside Spirit Sticks to be awarded.\n\nOur Visually Impaired Department truly went above and beyond to make the Eclipse such a meaningful experience for students last week. Thanks again to Jenice Dames, the Program Coordinator, and the entire VI Team.\n\nAnd of course, as a result of Scarborough Elementary “rocking” their STAAR Pep Rally, I felt compelled to recognize the amazing musical talent and creativity. Personally, I felt like the opening rendition of ACDC Thunderstruck by lead singer Brian Johnson (aka Ms. Sandra Luna) set the stage for those following and forced them to up their “game.” Thanks again for the great tunes and laughs Huskies!\n\nJohn M. Craft\n\nSuperintendent of Schools\n\nNorthside Independent School District\n\nGood Morning Team Northside,\n\nI hope this message finds you well this morning. I think it is safe to say that we are in the full swing of the Spring Semester and this weekend was proof of great things happening across the district. From the NEF Fun Run and ESports Spring Championships to our Lego Robotics Championship and the Fiesta of Cultures poetry event at Marshall High School, our students experienced tremendous success across a variety of venues.\n\nSpeaking of Robotics, we will be celebrating National Robotics Week, which actually officially kicked off Saturday. We have very talented students with impressive engineering, technical, and innovative skills in the world of robotics and we want to celebrate their success and of course, all of our instructors and sponsors who encourage and provide the pathways for their success. Congratulations are in order to some of our youngest robot enthusiasts at Ellison Elementary for winning the Lego League Championship Saturday! Awesome job Bees, you continue to stay very “Busy!”\n\nAnd of course, if you have not heard, we have prepared to experience the Solar Eclipse in its entirety as a result of residing in the Path of Totality. The rarity of getting to experience the moon rotating in direct alignment with the sun to create the shadowing effect will provide a tremendous learning experience for our students. Albeit the event will likely be well underway or perhaps over by the time you are reading this, but I hope you are able to enjoy the rare event. Hopefully, Mother Nature cooperates. I want to thank all of our teachers, science coordinators, and especially Deonna Dean, NISD Assistant Superintendent for Middle School Instruction, for all their hard work in planning instructional activities, procuring protective eyewear, and supporting the amazing experience. Enjoy the Day NISD!\n\nFrom Around the District\n\nSenior Staff - Reading at Carlos Coon Elementary School. Our Senior staff had a phenomenal day on Monday to start the week reading to the young Koalas at Carlos Coon Elementary School. Both the Pre-K and Kindergarten students had a pressing question upon my arrival which pertained to the fact I did not have a full head of hair. I blamed my baldness on having two teenage daughters, which they seemed to accept as an appropriate answer in both cases. It was a joy to see their smiling faces following an extended weekend. Thank you again to Principal Jessica Lundquist, Associate Principal Evelyn DeLeon-Garcia, and the students and staff at Carlos Coon Elementary for making the day so special. Special thanks to Kindergarten and Pre-Kindergarten teachers Amanda Barrientes and Amanda Kluna for allowing me the opportunity to spend some time with their amazing students.\n\nReflections Art Awards. Thursday evening, we were able to celebrate the success of 68 students who were recognized in the annual Reflections Art Program supported and coordinated by our PTA’s across Northside. The program is designed to enable students to have a creative outlet in the areas of dance choreography, film production, literature, music composition, photography, and visual arts. By focusing on positive recognition rather than competition, students of all ages and abilities can experience the benefits of creative expression and help in finding their own voice in telling their unique story It was great to see the students expressions as they received their awards and I want to again thank Irma Duran de Rodriguez, who oversees the Arts in Education and Crystal Rivas, PTA Council President for their hard work in providing our students the opportunity to participate in the Reflections Program.\n\nNISD Soccer Update. We want to again congratulate our soccer student-athletes on their very successful seasons. The Taft girls beat Round Rock on Friday to advance to the Regional Final matchup against a very competitive Austin Westlake team Saturday. While falling a bit short, they fought hard through the last minute, and congratulations to the Lady Raiders on a superb season! We also want to Congratulate the Harlan High School Boys for advancing to the Regional tournament. They played a tough Vandegrift team at Comalander Stadium on Friday, and we are very proud of the Hawks and their tremendous season.\n\nDistrict Track. After a late evening round of storms last Monday, it proved to provide two beautiful days of weather to follow for the district track meets to be run. With field events and prelims taking place on Tuesday and running finals on Wednesday night, we had plenty of stellar athletes competing hard on both days. It is always great to see our parents and community come out to support the student-athletes and Congratulations to our athletes and teams advancing to the Area Track meet. To see the full list of District winners and students advancing click below on the links for 29-6A District Results & 28-6A District Results.\n\nDistrict Golf. We would like to congratulate all the student athletes that competed in the district tournament last week. We are also appreciative for the Golf Club of Texas hosting us and our volunteers and rules officials who made this event run smoothly.

The annual NSITE College & Career EXPO for students was held this past Friday at the Northside Activity Center and at this event were representatives from colleges/universities, local businesses, and all branches of the military to provide promotional materials and teach our students about the different opportunities that these organizations have to offer. It was great to visit with all who supported the event and to be able to visit with some of the students as they learned more about potential college/career pathways. Thanks again to the NSITE staff and our event supporters for without their partnership the event would not have been possible.\n\nNorthside Education Foundation Fun Run. While the weather Saturday morning was a bit dreary, it did not stop over 2,000 NISD supporters from joining us at Northwest Vista College, who served as the host for our annual NEF Fun Run. It was so great to visit with many of our students, staff, and families supporting the event. Dr. Amy Bosley, Northwest Vista College President, and numerous staff joined us and we so appreciate their partnership in providing amazing learning opportunities for our high school students through dual credit programming. I also want to thank and acknowledge our NEF Board members, NISD staff, numerous sponsors, and the Board of Trustees for supporting the event. (Many of whom arrived at the NWV campus at 3:00 A.M. to begin setting up.) I want to particularly thank Wade Cleary and Calvin Bucholtz for cooking over 1,000 sausage links. (I kept telling myself while trying to keep pace with my wife on our fun run journey, that there was a delicious sausage wrap awaiting me at the finish line…. And it did not disappoint!) Thanks again to all who came out to support the amazing time and again special thanks to our sponsors and volunteers! We hope to see you again next year!\n\nThe Spirit of Northside. This week we once again have a tie for the Spirit Stick. To begin, I would like to recognize the efforts of Locke Hill Elementary who keeps the momentum going by scheduling and advertising attendance celebrations throughout the year. Every marking period, students get a fresh chance to earn the celebration events scheduled and parents are educated about the compulsory attendance laws in the process. Way to go Principal Melissa De Hoyos and the Locke Hill Team! We appreciate your efforts to boost daily attendance and emphasize the importance of students being present for instruction.\n\nI also want to recognize the Fisher Elementary School Marlins for their amazing Fiesta Parade. It was a very festive start to a Friday morning as hundreds of families came out to celebrate and view the student floats. Of course, I enjoyed playing the role of “Ray Feo” which is not a problem for me to cover the “ugly” portion of the “Ugly King” translation. Congratulations to Principal Rhapsody Quintero and the entire Marlin staff. You definitely know how to kick-off Fiesta Season (which is quickly approaching) by pulling out all the stops.\n\nI hope you have a great week and enjoy the Eclipse NISD!\n\nJohn M. Craft\n\nSuperintendent of Schools\n\nNorthside Independent School District\n\nGood Morning Team Northside,\n\nI hope you all had a wonderful and joyous weekend. It is always nice to have an extra day to enjoy with family and friends.\n\nThis week we will be celebrating two distinct, hard-working groups of individuals, our Assistant/Associate Principals and our Librarians.\n\nOur Assistant and Associate Principals play a crucial role, and this week is a dedicated time to recognize them for their hard work and commitment to our schools, students, and profession. Please join us in celebrating these incredible school leaders during National Assistant Principal Week. These dedicated individuals work tirelessly to bolster teachers, motivate students, support their principal, create a positive learning community, and face the many unpredictable challenges that land on their desks.\n\nEvery April we also encourage our schools to celebrate the vital role that our strong school library programs play in transforming learning! They also work long hours in helping to transform the learning experience for our students. April 4th is School Librarian Appreciation Day in Northside and we can not express our gratitude enough. Please take a moment to swing by a library and thank our amazing librarians.\n\nAs we begin the month of April, we will be in full planning mode for the upcoming school year. We recognize that preparing this upcoming school year’s budget is going to be very challenging as the past 88th Legislative Session was unsuccessful in providing districts the adequate and necessary school finance support that would have assisted in combating increasing inflationary pressures and the help to combat with the growing costs of meeting the needs of our diverse student population.\n\nThis being said, in working with the Board of Trustees, we understand the need and emphasis that will continue to be prioritized, to provide our staff a competitive compensation package. While no decisions have been made, there will be numerous conversations in the coming weeks as we remain focused on doing everything we can to take care of our employees. More information will be forthcoming in the weeks ahead, and rest assured, we understand the importance of prioritizing compensation through the budgeting process.\n\nFrom Around the District\n\nEducators of the Year. We had the opportunity to celebrate with both our Elementary and Secondary Educators of the Year on Wednesday and Thursday at the Sports Gym last week. It was great to meet so many fine teachers and their families. Please join me in congratulating our teachers of the year and as Tina Turner sang it best (much better than I ever could) “You’re simply the best,” and we couldn’t be more appreciative.\n\nView our Campus Educators of the Year\n\nRead about our District Educators of the Year\n\nTuesday Night School Board Honors and Recognitions. Tuesday was also a great time for celebrations as we recognized over 170 students and staff members at our Board Meeting hosted at the Northside Activity Center. It was a pleasure to recognize the following:\n\nLisa Delgado is the coordinator of the NISD School Age Parenting Program. She started as a social worker in this program in 1990, so she has been involved with the program\n\nfor 34 years – what a legacy! The SAPP program’s mission is to empower teen parents to stay in school and achieve academic success; to equip teen parents with the knowledge and skills needed to rear a child who will develop to his or her highest potential; and to equip teen parents with job skills so they can financially support themselves and their child. Thank you, Ms. Delgado for your tremendous efforts and the love you put into our students and this program daily.\n\nUIL State Champions/CTE Stevens High School Students. The Stevens UIL Audio Video Film team created a seven-minute documentary titled “God’s Dogs– A Dog’s Wish.” The premise of the story is centered around the CEO of Gods Dogs, an organization working to provide lost and stray animals with proper homes. The video highlights her story of establishing the Foundation for God’s Dogs Paws to raise awareness and stop the cycle of inbreeding dogs – in other words, encouraging us to Adopt, don’t Shop! Congratulations again to our CTE Audio Visual and Commercial Photography students from Stevens High School, the UIL 6A State Champions!\n\nAmazing Musicians. The Brandeis High School Orchestra was selected as the national symphony orchestra for command performance at the Midwest Band/Orchestra Clinic. Only three orchestras and three bands are selected annually through a rigorous process that includes hundreds of entries. Other than selection as the TMEA honor band or orchestra, this remains one of the most prestigious awards for an ensemble nationally and we could not be more proud of your accomplishment.\n\nWe also recognized the O’Connor HS Jazz Ensemble selected for TMEA winner of the Texas Music Educators Association’s (TMEA) Invited Jazz Ensemble Contest. This award signifies the O’Connor HS Jazz Band as the finest jazz program in Texas when assessed in a field of over 250 ensembles competing. Congratulations again to our very successful Jazz band musicians.\n\nSpeaking of TMEA All-State Musicians, Twelve NISD Fine Arts students from nine high schools were selected to the Texas Music Educators’ Association (TMEA) All-State Band, Choir, Orchestra, and Jazz bands. All-State is the highest individual honor that a student can receive in public school music education. It represents the top one percent of student musicians in Texas. Over 25,000 students engage in the audition process with only 870 students selected.\n\nNCA National Champions. It is always great to celebrate National Championships and we had two to honor Tuesday night. Warren High School took First Place in the Advanced Non-Tumbling Varsity Crowd Leading Team, and Brennan High School took First Place in the Intermediate Varsity Performance Small Team Division. Congratulations to both of these squads!\n\nAcademic Decathlon State Winners. Two NISD Academic Decathlon teams placed at the state level and are heading to the national competition later this month. Warren High School placed second in the Thomas E. Moseley State Finals from among the top 40 performing schools in the large school category. Health Careers High School placed second for Division 4 in the Frisco Invitational competition, placing among the next top 40 performing schools. Both teams are heading to Nationals later this month and we wish them the best as they continue their successful journey.\n\nState and National Visual Arts Winners. Hundreds of NISD student artists participated in the 2024 Visual Arts Scholastic Event. This event included 1,922 adjudicated artworks with individual interviews for every competing artist. Among the 526 individual medalists from NISD who received the highest rating for their art/interview, 36 artworks advanced to the State VASE competition which will be held at the end of this month.\n\nIn addition, we have some art students advancing to a National competition. The National Scholastic Art Awards recognized five Northside art students with Gold Keys at the regional event along with an American Visions Award Nominee. These students and their artwork have advanced to the national competition where they will go through another rigorous adjudication and we certainly wish them luck at the National level!\n\nCongratulations again to all our students and staff and thank you again for taking time out of your busy schedule to celebrate with us.\n\nSee our list of winners\n\nBrennan High School Student Named National Military Child of the Year. Congratulations are also in order for Noelani Martinez, a junior at Brennan High School, who earned the title of Military Child of the Year and will represent the Air Force in Operation Homefront’s 2024 Military Child of the Year award program. She is one of seven military children representing the different branches of the armed forces. She and the six other recipients (representing the Army, Marine Corps, Navy, Coast Guard, National Guard, and Space Force) will be recognized when they attend Operation Homefront’s April gala in Arlington, Virginia.\n\nGood Morning Team Northside,\n\nI hope this message finds you well and that you all are enjoying the warmer weather and extended daylight. (in the evenings at least). We are entering the final stretch and the time of year that tends to get really busy throughout the district. I am going to encourage you to try and enjoy this final stretch, as we prepare to finish strong and plan for the upcoming school year.\n\nIf you follow college basketball, I think it’s safe to say March Madness is somewhat of a metaphor. Just remember to take time to catch your breath and enjoy all the success our students continue to experience. I had the chance to stop by the Holmes vs. Taft baseball game this past week, and it was a nice reprieve to just be able to sit down for a moment and reflect, as students competed and played a game they love.\n\nThis week, we will continue to celebrate Women’s History Month. We remain very appreciative of the rich heritage and contributions of so many phenomenal female leaders who have paved the way for generations to come. Malala Yousafzai once stated, “One child, one teacher, one book, one pen can change the world.” I couldn’t agree more, as we celebrate and commend our phenomenal teachers and staff who continue to forge and impact our future daily.\n\nWe look forward to celebrating our Educators of the Year on Wednesday and Thursday evenings. I hope you all enjoy this short week and have a relaxing Good Friday and a blessed weekend. Thank you again for all your hard work Team Northside.\n\nFrom Around the District\n\nC.L.A.S.S. Conference. Prior to the week of Spring Break, I had the opportunity to take part in our annual Administrative Support Staff conference to engage in the celebration and recognition of our hard-working support staff. It goes without saying that we are blessed to have a tremendously supportive cast of hard-working individuals who work tirelessly to keep operations running smoothly across the district. Thank you to all who donated (monetary and supply items) in honor of our support staff which directly benefits our School Age Parenting Program and Benevolence Closet (school supplies). This conference provides the stage to share some laughs, highlight the excellent customer service we provide, and support professional learning. We want to thank our sponsors who donated to the door prizes and Diana Ely and her team for making this year’s conference a huge success.\n\nRead Across America and (NISD). It was a pleasure to engage in reading activities across the district as we continue to promote early childhood literacy. Thank you to Krueger, Burke, and Driggers elementary schools for providing me the opportunity to visit and read to our youngest learners. While this celebration occurs the first week of March, I believe it’s important to engage students in the importance of reading throughout the year. I have told my colleagues, “When you think you’re having a rough day, unplug and take the opportunity to read to a group of kindergarteners.” It puts everything back in perspective and serves as a reminder of the importance of our daily mission.\n\nAdam’s Hill Career Day. I also would like to thank Adam’s Hill Elementary for providing a phenomenal learning opportunity for students through their Career Day activities. The day before Spring Break can be somewhat challenging to keep students focused, and this was a phenomenal way to start the morning. Albeit when I arrived and EMS services and others had all their really cool trucks and equipment on display, I knew I had my work cut out to compete with their careers. It was a lot of fun and I always get a kick out of the questions the students pose. Thank you to Counselor Katlyn Phelan, Principal Annette Robinson, and of course, teacher Catherine Garza, and her very attentive class. Kudos to the entire Patriot staff for making the day such a wonderful learning experience. I don’t know how successful I was at recruiting future school superintendents, but you never know!\n\nLos Leones Festival. I know I have mentioned our talented fine arts students, and their abilities were on full display Saturday at Marshall High School, as we celebrated 25 years of the Northside Los Leones Festival. We had thousands of students, parents, and community members enjoy the beautiful day, and it was awesome to see so many come out to support the event, which reminded me once again of just how supportive our community remains. We had the opportunity for students to display their talents across a multitude of performances and activities. The original vision of Los Leones was to show students and their families that the study of the arts is not merely a life enrichment, but also the path to a career in the Arts. I really enjoyed the “Transformational Treasures” display, which was the culmination of our Fine Art teachers who created masterpieces using recycled items. The final pieces were then auctioned and the proceeds will benefit the Marcy Meffert Art Scholarship, which our students will have the opportunity to apply and benefit from this upcoming month. From sidewalk chalk art to mariachi bands, and more…what a great celebration. Thank you again to all who served as judges including our Board of Trustees, Jefferson Bank, our dedicated sponsor, James Miculka and the NISD Fine Arts Department staff, and of course our phenomenal Fine Arts teachers for making this year’s Los Leones a tremendous success. VIsit the Los Leones 2024 photo album of this wonderful event.\n\nLeadership Northside Bus Tour. We also toured the district with our Leadership Northside cohort on Saturday. This supportive group of parents and community member volunteers had the opportunity to start their day at Los Leones before proceeding to the NISD police station to see how we support safety and security through our own dedicated police force. They had the opportunity to observe our communications center, how police body cams work, GPS capabilities, radios, cameras, patrol units, and law enforcement equipment that may be deployed if needed. Thanks again to Asst. Chief Lucy Hemerly, Lt. Kelley Fryar, Officer Mauricio Hernandez, and our police department staff for helping to make this educational tour a success. The tour also included visits to Driggers Elementary followed by Oak Hills Terrace Elementary so they could see different campuses and how we continuously work to improve facilities across the district. We appreciate principals Paul Brusewitz and Stacy Winton for serving as guides through their campuses. Thank you again to Nicole Franco, Diana Ely, and Kelly Rasti for helping to organize this tour and especially Gloria Ramos, a 24-year NISD veteran for safely navigating the bus throughout the tour.\n\nSpherOlympics. We had approximately 600 seventh grade Innovative Thinkers participate in this year's SpherOlympics where they were tasked with coding and competing in a variety of olympic events with their Sphero Robots! They programmed and competed in downhill skiing, wrestling, played golf, figure skated, and more. I learned a lot about the event in a short amount of time and I just want to Thank all of our sponsors and GT teachers for planning and hosting the event. It was a lot of fun to see our middle school students from across the district so engaged and working collaboratively.\n\nBooks and Hoops. San Antonio will be hosting the NCAA Final Four in 2025 and as a City-Sponsored event our campuses will have the opportunity to participate in a community-wide reading competition next Fall. There will be more information forthcoming and shared with our librarians and campuses, but go ahead and mark your calendars as we will be formulating teams and preparing for our quest towards a NISD Championship shortly after Labor Day. It will provide a great opportunity to encourage and motivate our young readers while having a friendly competition at the same time.\n\nHEB Excellence in Education Awards. It was great to surprise four NISD All-Stars who received the H-E-B Excellence in Education awards this year. Their individual stories are so incredibly impressive and humbling. Please join me in congratulating these fine educators and check out the following link to learn more about their journeys and success stories.\n\nHonoree: Isaac Esquivel, Environmental Education Teacher\n\nCampus: Westwood Terrace Elementary School\n\nHonoree: Colin Varville, Music Teacher\n\nCampus: Warren High School\n\nHonoree: Michelle Fine, Principal\n\nCampus: Glenn Elementary School\n\nHonoree: Julie Minnis, Head Counselor\n\nCampus: Hector Garcia Middle School\n\nCongratulations again and Thank you for all your hard work. And another special thanks to H-E-B for their continued support of Public Education across the State of Texas.\n\nFestival of Cultures. Rudder Middle School and Marshall High School teamed up to provide an awesome celebration of the cultures across Northside ISD. I was really impressed by the turnout and enjoyed meeting so many students who are newcomers to the United States. The morning was filled with numerous activities native to the continents of the world (with the exception of Antarctica seeing snow and ice just wasn’t in the forecast this weekend.) Thanks again to Principals Paul Ramirez, Richard Halle, and Margaret Bray as your support and leadership is evident. I would also like to extend appreciation for the amazing teachers and staff members who supported the event and provided the fun activities for students and families to engage and pay tribute to the diversity of our district. We are blessed to support students who speak approximately 90 different languages across our campuses and I believe this is an absolute strength that helps to make our communities so welcoming and friendly. I learned so much and look forward to learning more.\n\nSteubing Stomp. Well, I admit, I got stomped last weekend in preparation for Steubing Elementary 18th Annual Stomp Carnival & Auction. I was not able to get by the event due to the numerous activities happening across the district but I am looking forward to the opportunity to enjoy lunch with Steubing students (they may not enjoy it as much as I will) while raising funds to support the campus. There will also be a student replacing Latia Bishop as Principal for the Day, so who knows what the lunch schedule and dress code may look like that particular day. In all sincerity, I want to express gratitude to the Steubing PTA for your dedication in supporting our students and staff!\n\nSteamFest. I also had the opportunity to run by John Jay High School on Saturday to check out the annual community event, STEAMfest. There were over 60 hands-on science, technology, engineering, math, and fine arts activities all supported and led by over 100 Jay/SEA high school students. We also appreciate the support from many of our STEM partners from around our city. Avery Pollick, a Zachry Middle School Magnet student, attempted to teach me to fly a drone. Upon self-reflection, I think it might be best for me to stick to spectating as the FFA licensure department doesn't have enough hours in the day to certify me as a drone pilot. Thank you to all who made the event such a success for our younger students and families. It was really a cool event.\n\nNISD Basketball. Friday night was an intense evening for NISD Basketball. The O’Connor Boys kicked us off with a nailbiter Overtime win against a very tough Lake Travis team. While they came up short on the match-up against Round Rock Stoney Point on Saturday in the Region IV Championship game, they competed well and we could not be prouder of their efforts.\n\nThe Brennan Boys team also played Friday and displayed similar tenacity, having to battle back from a double digit deficit to take the lead in the final minutes of the 4th quarter. With the final seconds remaining, Stoney Point was able to inbound the ball and hit a three-pointer for the win as the clock expired. It was an amazing demonstration by the Bears of resiliency and determination. There were so many opportunities for the team to lie down, but they kept fighting all the way to the end. These are the lessons competitive athletics instills in our student-athletes which will carry them through their careers long after they graduate from high school.\n\nThe Brennan Ladies also competed to the end at the Alamodome with a tough South Grand Prairie team in the State Semifinals match-up. At this level of play, it requires not only skill and athleticism, but also the “ball has to bounce” your way. It was a great season for the Lady Bears and Congratulations again.\n\nI want to acknowledge Coaches Koty Cowgill (Brennan Boys), Brett Jewasko (O’Connor Boys), and Jackie Contreras (Brennan Girls) and their staff for their hard work and dedication. Their seasons began back in October, and it takes a tremendous effort to make the successful runs they experienced. Great job, and we look forward to celebrating your future success.\n\nDon’t Forget to Vote! Just a reminder to be sure to exercise your right to vote! March 5th is Election Day and your final opportunity to participate in this year’s Primary Elections. Thank you to all who have voted and those who will Tuesday.\n\nThe Spirit of Northside. O’Connor High School hosted our Board Appreciation dinner (albeit January was Board Appreciation Month, but schedules just didn't provide an opportunity at the time) and it was a phenomenal dinner theater. Everything was absolutely amazing and we greatly appreciate the hospitality and incredible food. The annual Board recognition dinner is a way to demonstrate our appreciation for our Trustees and Principal Rob Martinez and the Culinary team led by the amazing Chef Jessica Parks hit a homerun. We were so impressed by the artists who displayed their work as well as the incredible student performances. Thank you again for making the evening such a special appreciation.\n\nAs we prepare to launch into Spring Break, I hope you have a great week and I plan to “Catch up with You” the week of March 25 after we return from Spring Break. Enjoy your break!\n\nJohn M. Craft\n\nSuperintendent of Schools\n\nNorthside Independent School District\n\nNISD Basketball Update. And the playoffs run continues on for the Lady Brennan Bears as they won a nailbiter Regional Championship game against the defending State Champions of Clark High School. Both Brennan and Clark won their matchups against Westlake and Harlan on Friday night to make it to the Region IV Championship match-up on Saturday afternoon. If you enjoy close competition with athletes leaving “nothing in the tank,” you were in luck Saturday. Both teams fought to the bitter end of two overtimes and after numerous lead changes, the Lady Bears prevailed. Congratulations to Coach Jackie Contreras and the Lady Bears as we look forward to your matchup against South Grand Prairie on Friday at the Alamodome. Go win a State Championship!\n\nGirls State Semifinals - Friday, March 1, 2024\n\nHumble Summer Creek vs Duncanville @ Alamodome* – 7:00 pm\n\nBrennan vs South Grand Prairie @ Alamodome* – 8:30 pm\n\nGirls State Finals - Saturday, March 2, 2024\n\nHumble Summer Creek/Duncanville Winner vs Brennan/South Grand Prairie Winner @ Alamodome* – 8:30 pm\n\nAdmission for State Tournament:\n\nTickets will be available to purchase online at: https://am.ticketmaster.com/cityofsanantonio/buy#/ or the Alamodome box office.\n\nSession tickets are good for (2) games purchased during the session.\n\nSchool Code for discounted tickets: 2VIS\n\nSchool code will be active from Sunday, February 25 at 12:00 pm to Tuesday, February 27 at 5:00 pm.\n\nWe will also be hosting the Regional Quarterfinals Tuesday for our four Boys teams advancing after victories on Friday night. It is awesome that these incredible NISD teams all advanced, but also bittersweet seeing they will have to cross paths and only two can advance to the Regional Tournament. It should be another great night of basketball at the Sports Gym Tuesday and I can assure you, if we can wrap up a Board meeting, I will see you there.\n\nBoys Regional Quarterfinal - Tuesday, Feb. 27\n\nHarlan vs O’Connor – 5:30 pm\n\nJohn Jay vs Brennan – 7:30 pm\n\nVisual Arts Scholastic Event Qualifier Competition. We also had a great VASE competition Saturday, Feb. 24 at Stevens High School as student artists from all over the Region competed to move on to the State competition. The event included 1,922 adjudicated artworks with individual interviews for every competing artist. Congratulations to all of our Northside ISD student artists and their respective teachers for an amazing performance. Northside ISD had 526 individual medalists who received the highest rating for their art/interview and also has 36 artworks that are advancing to the State VASE competition at the end of April.\n\n2023 State VASE Qualifiers\n\nStudent Name\n\nSchool\n\nGrade\n\nTeacher\n\nDivision\n\nAcree, Faith\n\nTaft\n\n12\n\nStephanie Silva\n\n4\n\nAllen, Isabel\n\nClark\n\n11\n\nBrandy Gonzalez-Kee\n\n4\n\nArredondo, Nicole M\n\nWarren\n\n10\n\nDaniella Jaime\n\n1\n\nBacon, Lana Jude\n\nMarshall\n\n12\n\nElyssa Holland\n\n2\n\nBauer, Gabriella\n\nBrandeis\n\n12\n\nJosh Gonzales\n\n4\n\nBjorlie, Riley\n\nO’Connor\n\n11\n\nAshley Henas\n\n4\n\nCaldwell, Erin\n\nBrandeis\n\n12\n\nJosh Gonzales\n\n4\n\nChaudhari, Koyel\n\nBrandeis\n\n12\n\nJosh Gonzales\n\n4\n\nCoudriet, Zoey\n\nSotomayor\n\n12\n\nMarco Gorena\n\n3\n\nCraft, Reagan\n\nBrandeis\n\n10\n\nJosh Gonzales\n\n4\n\nDejohn, Jade\n\nSotomayor\n\n10\n\nJaylin Von Berg\n\n2\n\nDelgado, Aylin\n\nSotomayor\n\n10\n\nMarco Gorena\n\n3\n\nDuran, Megan\n\nO’Connor\n\n11\n\nPearl Tenorio\n\n4\n\nGalvan, Adriana\n\nJohn Jay\n\n9\n\nKarina Garcia\n\n2\n\nGarcia Orihuela, Gabriel\n\nClark\n\n10\n\nMario Ortiz\n\n1\n\nHarrison, Preston\n\nO’Connor\n\n12\n\nPearl Tenorio\n\n4\n\nLarge, Aubrey\n\nHarlan\n\n11\n\nSarah Sharp\n\n2\n\nLeal, Victoria\n\nClark\n\n12\n\nBrandy Gonzalez-Kee\n\n4\n\nLindsey, Madeline G.\n\nHarlan\n\n9\n\nKristin Breaux\n\n2\n\nLongoria, Amaris\n\nTaft\n\n11\n\nStephanie Silva\n\n4\n\nMarquez, Lovelle V\n\nMarshall\n\n12\n\nAndra Ramirez\n\n4\n\nMiller, Sihnae A\n\nHarlan\n\n11\n\nMandy Clarson\n\n3\n\nNevarez, Kelly\n\nHolmes\n\n10\n\nScott Edwards\n\n1\n\nRodriguez, Marissa N\n\nHolmes\n\n12\n\nJessica Lebron\n\n3\n\nSantillan, Andrew\n\nBrennan\n\n11\n\nKellye Rogers\n\n4\n\nSauceda, Kaydence\n\nBrandeis\n\n12\n\nYma Luis\n\n4\n\nSawyer, Annaliz\n\nHarlan\n\n12\n\nSarah Sharp\n\n2\n\nSironda, Blissany N.\n\nHarlan\n\n11\n\nKristin Breaux\n\n2\n\nSmith, Sarah\n\nMarshall\n\n10\n\nKathryn Storck\n\n2\n\nStratton, Ashley T\n\nHarlan\n\n12\n\nMandy Clarson\n\n4\n\nSuffridge, Lola C\n\nMarshall\n\n11\n\nAndra Ramirez\n\n4\n\nThiessen, Cinda G\n\nHarlan\n\n12\n\nMandy Clarson\n\n3\n\nThomas, Isabel\n\nBrandeis\n\n12\n\nJosh Gonzales\n\n4\n\nThomas, Isabel\n\nBrandeis\n\n12\n\nJosh Gonzales\n\n4\n\nWintheiser, Amberly\n\nBrandeis\n\n12\n\nJosh Gonzales\n\n4\n\nWintheiser, Amberly\n\nBrandeis\n\n12\n\nJosh Gonzales\n\n4\n\nNAEA (National Art Education Association) recognizes Larry West, Rayburn Middle School. Speaking of Art and amazing instruction, we want to congratulate Mr. Larry West for being named the Choice Based Middle School Art Educator of the Year! Mr. West is so humble, but also so deserving. He indicated “Basically this was all happenstance, but I am grateful for the opportunity that all started with NISD! I am reminded of the Dr. Seuss book ‘Oh, the places you'll go’ I never saw this one coming!” Congratulations Mr. West, job well done!\n\nJROTC Visit. It was great to visit with our amazing JROTC instructors last Monday at Marshall High School. I learned quite a bit about the competitive aspect of our JROTC programs and I really appreciated the opportunity to slow down and engage in the dialogue. We have very robust leadership programs across the district and our ROTC programs are among some of the best we offer. Many times, you see our Colorguards supporting various events with the Presentation of Colors, but they do much more in giving back to our community. I look forward to forging forward and I know our students best interests are at the forefront of our instructors daily mission.\n\nBeard Custodial Appreciation. It was great to visit Beard Elementary on Friday as their Student Council took the time to articulate their appreciation for their amazing custodians. It was really nice to see student leaders recognizing the work of Corey Trevino, Steve Falcon, Patricia Justiniano, and K.C. Shayam. They do amazing work at Beard Elementary, that is not always highlighted. We appreciate our Beard students for “Packing Parachutes” and thanks again to Mr. Jeremy Day and the Beard Staff for recognizing the work of their amazing custodial team.\n\nLibrary Palooza. I was asked the question, Where can you find hundreds of middle and high school students from not only Bexar County but beyond excited about reading? Well, I found out pretty quickly. Library Palooza held at Brandeis High School Saturday definitely didn't disappoint. The event has been hosted by our amazing librarians for over a decade now, and it was great to witness the visiting authors present to our young readers and future writers. I felt the messages all of the authors provided were not only encouraging but providing insight to the importance of persistence, accepting constructive criticism, and determination. It was amazing to see the student's level of engagement not only with literary experts but also with one another. Great job to Co-Chairs Sheryl Stoeck and Lucy Podmore and their whole committee for a successful and thought-provoking event. Thanks to all the authors, This year’s event will include authors Victoria Aveyard, Gabriela Epstein, Marc Favreau, Renée Watson, Kasie West, and Kelly Yang, and Monica M. Magaña, who took time out of their busy schedules. They all had a tremendous impact on all the students in attendance.\n\nEarly Voting is Underway! Just a reminder to be sure to exercise your right to vote! Please remember early voting ends this Friday, March 1st. Please consider participating in this important primary election. We have voting sites across the district for your convenience. Thank you to all who have already voted!\n\nThe Spirit of Northside. This week the Spirit of Northside goes to the Brennan Bears! They have had tremendous success this year and we are very proud of their accomplishments. Good luck to the Lady Bears at the Dome this weekend and we hope to see the Bears Boys Team play with the same level of energy this week!\n\nAll the Best and Enjoy the week. (Only 2 more weeks until Spring Break!)\n\nJohn M. Craft\n\nSuperintendent of Schools\n\nNorthside Independent School District\n\nNISD Basketball. We are also in the thick of Playoff basketball now.

I had the opportunity to learn more about RootEd having visited with founder and Director Genevieve Suglaski. RootEd is a parent-led, grassroots organization that promotes neighborhood public schools through storytelling, advocacy, and education. The non-profit organization believes in a strong public school system for all children which creates a robust economic and well-connected community. Their primary focus areas:\n\nTo Promote our neighborhood schools through storytelling and marketing\n\nTo Dispel myths about public schools through conversations and introducing parents to their neighborhood schools\n\nTo Ensure parents understand the truth about public school funding and what it means to them personally and to our community\n\nTo Educate the public on pro-public education legislation and candidates\n\nTo Provide parents a search option for information on neighborhood schools using the hashtag #RootEdNameOfSchool\n\nFor more information, I would encourage you to check out their website at proudlyrooted.com. We remain very appreciative of your support and advocacy in promoting our public educators and schools!\n\nMid-Year Graduation. It was great to celebrate the milestone of receiving a high school diploma with 97 NISD graduates last Monday. Many of our students graduating have demonstrated resilience and determination along their journey as they have encountered numerous roadblocks. We remain very proud of our graduates and we appreciate their family members and friends for joining us at the Sports Gym in celebration of their success. We wish our graduates the very best in their future endeavors.\n\nSan Antonio School Public Relations Association (SASPRA). I had the opportunity to participate on a panel of superintendents to discuss many of the pressing matters surrounding effective communication in the world of Public Relations. It was a great opportunity for dialogue and Thank you to Barry Perez, Assistant Superintendent for District Communications, and our entire Comms. Department for all their hard work. There is so much that goes on behind the scenes and they work tirelessly to ensure the NISD brand and narrative is not only timely and effective, but also the messaging we want conveyed throughout our community.\n\nHoffmann Elementary Read Your Heart Out. Before I met with the SASPRA on Wednesday, I had the opportunity to see our young readers engaged in books of their choosing at Hoffmann Elementary. I have shared this with many, but what impressed me most was the levels of literacy our primary grade students were authentically engaged. I just want to applaud our teachers who are definitely shaping young minds at such an early stage, as I know how difficult the work remains. Special thanks to Andrea Turk, Hoffmann Reading Specialist, and Principal Kathryn Clements for organizing and hosting the event. What a special way to celebrate Valentine’s Day and I thoroughly enjoyed starting the day on such a positive note. Great job to all of our Hoffmann staff. It was very heartwarming to visit with such a positive group of students and educators.\n\nDestination Imagination (DI). On Thursday evening, I visited Forester Elementary as they hosted the District Imagination Parent Showcase prior to competing on Saturday at the Regional tournament in Seguin. We have some amazingly talented students spanning all grade levels and to see their creativity, critical thinking skills, and collaboration displayed was enlightening. From our 2nd grade Rising Stars to our Middle School Team Steam, I thought the “Challenges” the students prepared and presented were awesome. All projects were student-initiated and produced and I know our DI students will be well-prepared for whatever challenges may exist in the future. Great job and Thank you again to Principal Kelly Mantle and our fabulous GT teachers and DI sponsors for hosting the event and fostering our students' creativity.\n\nUTSA Resume and Interview Seminar Annual Interview and Resume Preparation Workshop. On Saturday, Valerie Sisk, Assistant Superintendent for Secondary Administration, had the opportunity to visit with many of the San Antonio area's aspiring campus administrators through a panel discussion and mock interview process. Hosted by our partners at UTSA through the Educational Leadership and Policy Studies Department, I think the workshop was beneficial in preparing future administrators for the interview process, but more importantly, growing and developing skill sets to navigate the complexities of school administration that exist today. Remaining intentional in our efforts to grow organizational capacity and develop leadership is so vital to our future success. Thank you again to Anita Cardenas, Meadow Village Reading and Academic Support Teacher, and Michelle Tomasino, McAndrew Instructional Coach for your willingness to participate in the mock interview process. It is never easy to interview, much less in the presence of colleagues within the room. Great job to both and please just make sure NISD has the first opportunity to hire/promote you in the future.\n\nGood Morning Team Northside,\n\nI hope “your team” was successful this weekend. Whether you are an avid Chiefs or 49ers fan, the Super Bowl festivities are always an enjoyable time of the year. I was personally relieved to see Team “Ruff” win the Puppy Bowl XX. It was close through the 4th quarter, but a last second score sealed the deal. It’s always enjoyable to debate the best commercials and play Monday Morning Quarterback assessing the halftime performances. Usher was a definite throwback. I didn't know my wife could still dance. It was definitely a spectacle! (The game, the game…to be clear.)\n\nThis week we will be meeting with the Board of Trustees and we will be presenting a resolution for their consideration requesting the State to support an accurate and transparent academic accountability rating system. I have attached a copy of the draft resolution.\n\nWhile I continue to be a firm believer that academic accountability should be measured and appropriately reported to our parents and public, and a valid and reliable instrument can serve as an important aide in the continuous improvement process; I do have many concerns with how the latest system was changed without appropriate notification, and furthermore how it continues to be more punitive towards impoverished campuses across the state.\n\nWe recognize the hard work our teachers and staff put in every day, and to quantify this work through a letter grade system, (that I will argue remains arbitrary and largely based on a single, standardized test-driven model) the current system remains an injustice to our educators who pride themselves on growing students to reach their maximum learning potential.\n\nWe will remain steadfast in our efforts to forge meaningful academic accountability measures, and this proposed resolution serves as a statement of this support and a request for effective change.\n\nFrom Around the District\n\nNorthside Education Foundation Clay Shoot. The annual NEF Clay Shoot & Cornhole Tournament took place on Feb. 7, 2024, at the National Shooting Complex and was a huge success. Luckily, the weather cooperated for both events and while not every competitor was crowned the boss of the boards nor king of range, it was a great time for fellowship. We greatly appreciate all of our staff who worked so hard to support the event by helping to set up in the early morning hours, our NEF Board of Directors, and of course all of our tremendous sponsors. We could not have pulled off the event without their dedication and support and Thank you to all who participated in the event. This continued support is extended to our teachers and students through the funding of engagement grants and innovative programs. Thank you again for a great event NEF!\n\nTMEA Conference Concert Featuring the O’Connor Jazz Band. The Texas Music Educators Association (TMEA) Music conference kicked off on Thursday and all of our district all-state students began their rehearsals with other high performing musicians from across Texas. One of the main highlights of the conference was Friday evening with the O'Connor High School Jazz Band performing in the S.A. Convention Center Hemisfair Ballroom. Our students were absolutely phenomenal and represented their school and NISD superbly at this prestigious event. Junior musician, Karolina Shrader, performed the 8 selected pieces of the program with her classmates on three different instruments including a violin solo performance. Absolutely amazing. It was also incredible to have Adam Carrillo, O’Connor Alumni of Class of 2007, join our students on stage for the inaugural performance and tribute to the first O’Connor Director of Bands, Wallace Dierolf, Ode to Wallace, composed by Dr. Adrian Ruiz. It was a very special tribute and amazing musical piece. We remain very proud of our musicians’ accomplishments and congratulations to Director Alfonso Alvarado and Associate Director Michael Bradford. Your work and dedication has been recognized across the State.\n\nGifted and Talented Enrichment Advisory Council (GTEAC). It was great to visit with our GTEAC Thursday evening. The GTEAC Board President Rebecca Hughes and officers have been very supportive of the efforts of our phenomenal GT teachers and staff and we remain very appreciative of their continued engagement. The mission of the NISD GTEAC remains to enhance the opportunities and experiences of Northside students by sharing resources with parents, by expanding public opinion and awareness through communications, and by providing funds for grants and specialized GT projects. I want to especially thank Roxanne Brown, our GT Services Coordinator and her amazing team for growing our GT program. Through the changes made to Middle School programming and early identification efforts, we now serve 9,000+ students through GT services district-wide and have seen significant annual increases the past three consecutive years. Thanks again to all of our GT coordinators, teachers, and staff for supporting our learners and for engaging last week in this important work.\n\nNational Signing Letter of Intent Days. One of the most exciting moments for a student-athlete is receiving a verbal scholarship offer representing the culmination of hard work they put forth over many years. Another exciting moment is when a student-athlete signs their Letter of Intent (NLI.) While it’s not mandatory, it remains an important recognition and highlight of their accomplishments. Every year more than 48,000 student-athletes take part in this commemorative ceremony across the Nation and it was awesome to see so many NISD student-athletes across our high schools engaging in their signing ceremonies last week. Trustees Freeman, Blount, Saldana, and I were so impressed to see the number of students whose lives will be changed as a result of this momentous decision. Once again, Congratulations to all of our student-athletes and family members. Thank you to our high school staff members for making this such a special celebration and acknowledgment of their hard-earned success.\n\nIt’s Playoff Time. Congratulations to our Lady Basketball Teams on their outstanding seasons!

We had another successful Mega Food Drive on Friday sponsored by our great partners at the SA Food Bank and of course supported by our amazing volunteers. Our students continue to learn the importance of philanthropy by giving back and donating their time (and muscle) to those in need. Thank you to all of our NISD employees, students, and volunteers who make this possible and it was great to see Trustees Salcido and Lopez working alongside students from Sul Ross Middle School. Great Teamwork, indeed.\n\nFinance Park. I had the opportunity to visit Finance Park, which provides a financial literacy curriculum and a culminating experience to approximately 9,000 NISD students annually. Ms. Krystal Williams and her Zachary Middle Magnet AVID students were engaged in their visit to Finance Park Friday morning, which is supported by volunteers from surrounding financial institutions like USAA and the Junior Achievement staff. I learned the history of the Junior Achievement (JA) program and the impact it has made in preparing our students to navigate their financial future. Janie Cook who serves as the South Texas JA President, and NISD Executive Director and JA Board Member, Traci Wernli were kind enough to give me a tour and explain the robust financial planning program curriculum. I was so impressed with their professionalism, but also their genuine interests in investing in our youth. This is a program we hope to expand across the NISD K-12 landscape as I could not help but reflect during the visit “if I had been exposed to these skill sets while I was in school.” Truly an impactful service that is being provided free of charge, and we appreciate the generosity of JA sponsors and supporters.\n\nMiddle School ESports Qualifier. I know I have probably expressed this, but Gamers love competition, and they love comradeship even more. NISD hosted the Middle School Regional Qualifier event on Saturday as the NAC doors were opened to almost 500 middle school Esports competitors. It was an awesome experience for our students once again. I have mentioned the growth of this industry in the past, but to put this in perspective, Texas A&M University (College Station) is discussing turning a recently acquired mall (Post Oak) into a gaming hub accommodating over 2,000 students actively participating in Esports. The proposal would have enough space to provide 400 game station PCs and a retail space for food, beverages, hardware, clothing, and more. Something tells me we may have a few future ESport Aggies in the making. (I have a feeling Longhorns may be taking notes on this venture.)\n\nGood Morning Team Northside,\n\nThis week, February 5-9, we are celebrating National Counseling Week. The theme for 2024 is \"School Counseling: Standards-Based, Student-Focused,\" and will focus public attention on the contributions schools make each and every day. National School Counseling Week highlights the tremendous impact school counselors can have in helping students achieve school success and plan for a career. We will be honoring our school counselors as this week provides recognition to those who implement comprehensive school counseling programs; a vital part of the educational process for all students as they meet the challenges of the 21st century. This special week honors school counselors for the important role they play in college and career readiness and in helping students examine their talents, strengths, abilities, and interests.\n\nPlease join me in congratulating and thanking all of our counselors across the district for their tremendous service to our students and community.\n\nFrom Around the District\n\nPTA Founders Day. We had the chance to celebrate the tremendous collaboration between our PTA’s and our schools and thank all of our PTA members for their volunteerism and the work they do year-round across our campuses. I’d like to thank our very own NISD Council of PTAs for all the work they have done in recruiting, training, and supporting PTA members across the district. NISD Council of PTAs President, Crystal Rivas, and the entire PTA Council Board should be commended for their commitment and dedication as we know it’s not easy to coordinate activities and work with thousands of PTA members across Northside, but they do it tirelessly and it is definitely appreciated. Thanks again to all our administrators for your commitment and support Thursday night.\n\nWe also want to thank our hosts for the amazing evening last Thursday, our very own Brennan High School Principal Dr. John Trimble and his staff, as well as applaud the students and instructors for their talents in providing us food and entertainment at the pre-event reception.\n\nThis supporting cast includes:\n\nCulinary Arts students and their instructors, Tony Capriatti, Mark Weaver, Nancy Pavlich, Yanica St. John, and Courtney Carrell;\n\nThe Brennan Band under the direction of Thomas Kober, Shayla Le, and Dillon Shaw;\n\nBrennan Choir under the direction of Jimmy Garrett\n\nBrennan Orchestra under the direction of Armando Rivera and Stephanie Wong;\n\nDance/Spirit organizations – teacher/sponsors Alexis Flores, Sofia Elizade, Cynthia Ferrell, and Dominique Katauskas;\n\nThe JROTC – under the direction of Col.

It was a great night for Northside students and advocacy and we appreciate all involved in making the event such a huge success.\n\nHealth Occupation Students of America (HOSA). HOSA is a global student-led organization recognized by the U.S. Department of Education, the Department of Health and Human Services, and several federal and state agencies. HOSA’s mission is to empower HOSA-future health professionals to become leaders in the global health community, through education, collaboration, and experience. HOSA actively promotes career opportunities in the health industry and enhances the delivery of quality health care to all people.\n\nThe Area 1 Spring Leadership Conference was held this past Friday and Saturday in Northside ISD. It was great to see our students so actively involved in the organization's Mission. We not only applaud our future health workers but also our NISD sponsors for their efforts in providing students with training and guidance far beyond the basic technical skills needed for entry into the healthcare field, and developing people-oriented leaders who will be orchestrating the efforts of a healthcare team soon. Our very own Area I President, Hector Frausto, a senior at O'Connor High School did a fantastic job planning and coordinating the Spring Conference.\n\nUIL Realignment. The UIL League office released the realignments that will be in effect for the upcoming (2) school years. As a result of each district submitting enrollment data for students in grades 9-12 as of Oct. 31, 2023, schools have been assigned to a conference based on these enrollment numbers and the following districts and regions have been established. Please find the newly drawn districts for Northside High Schools below.\n\nGood Morning Northside ISD,\n\nWelcome to the final stretch of January. I hope this message finds you well and you were able to get out and enjoy the beautiful weather we were blessed with this past weekend. It’s an incredibly busy time of the year and again Thank you for supporting our students in the variety of activities happening throughout the district.\n\nOn Tuesday, we had the opportunity to celebrate our Board of Trustees with School Board Appreciation Month. Our Trustees serve the district helping to ensure our students and staff have the resources and pathways to be successful. We appreciate our Council of PTA’s (President Crystal Rivas), Northside Education Foundation (President-elect Lilia Gibson), and the Northside Museum Association (Pam Sprague) for helping to recognize our Trustees. I especially would like to thank our amazing students who were kind enough to present their amazing artwork, a gift I know our Trustees appreciated immensely.\n\nTrustee David Saucedo was presented with artwork by Ria Velayo, a 12th grader at Jay High School.
