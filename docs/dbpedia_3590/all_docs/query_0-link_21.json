        "text": "Introduction\n\nBackground\n\nFormerly part of the Ottoman Empire, Iraq was occupied by Britain during the course of World War I; in 1920, it was declared a League of Nations mandate under UK administration. In stages over the next dozen years, Iraq attained its independence as a kingdom in 1932. A “republic” was proclaimed in 1958, but in actuality a series of military strongmen ruled the country, the latest was SADDAM Husayn. Territorial disputes with Iran led to an inconclusive and costly eight-year war (1980-88). In August 1990, Iraq seized Kuwait, but was expelled by US-led, UN coalition forces during the Gulf War of January-February 1991. Following Kuwait’s liberation, the UN Security Council (UNSC) required Iraq to scrap all weapons of mass destruction and long-range missiles and to allow UN verification inspections. Continued Iraqi noncompliance with UNSC resolutions over a period of 12 years led to the US-led invasion of Iraq in March 2003 and the ouster of the SADDAM Husayn regime. Coalition forces remain in Iraq, helping to restore degraded infrastructure and facilitating the establishment of a freely elected government, while simultaneously dealing with a robust insurgency. The Coalition Provisional Authority, which temporarily administered Iraq after the invasion, transferred full governmental authority on 28 June 2004, to the Iraqi Interim Government (IG), which governed under the Transitional Administrative Law for Iraq (TAL). Under the TAL, elections for a 275-member Transitional National Assembly (TNA) were held in Iraq on 30 January 2005. Following these elections, the Iraqi Transitional Government (ITG) assumed office. The TNA was charged with drafting Iraq’s permanent constitution, which was approved in a 15 October 2005 constitutional referendum. An election under the constitution for a 275-member Council of Representatives (CoR) was held on 15 December 2005. After an official certified ballot count is released, an Iraqi Government is expected to be formed by late spring or early summer 2006.\n\n» Geography\n\n» People\n\n» Government\n\n» Economy\n\n» Communications\n\n» Transportation\n\n» Military\n\n» Transnational Issues\n\nGeography\n\nLocation\n\nMiddle East, bordering the Persian Gulf, between Iran and Kuwait\n\nGeographic Coordinates\n\n33 00 N, 44 00 E\n\nArea\n\ntotal: 437,072 sq km;

Iraq’s seizure of Kuwait in August 1990, subsequent international economic sanctions, and damage from military action by an international coalition beginning in January 1991 drastically reduced economic activity. Although government policies supporting large military and internal security forces and allocating resources to key supporters of the regime hurt the economy, implementation of the UN’s oil-for-food program, which began in December 1996, helped improve conditions for the average Iraqi citizen. Iraq was allowed to export limited amounts of oil in exchange for food, medicine, and some infrastructure spare parts. In December 1999, the UN Security Council authorized Iraq to export under the program as much oil as required to meet humanitarian needs. Per capita food imports increased significantly, while medical supplies and health care services steadily improved. Per capita output and living standards were still well below the pre-1991 level, but any estimates have a wide range of error. The military victory of the US-led coalition in March-April 2003 resulted in the shutdown of much of the central economic administrative structure. Although a comparatively small amount of capital plant was damaged during the hostilities, looting, insurgent attacks, and sabotage have undermined efforts to rebuild the economy. Attacks on key economic facilities – especially oil pipelines and infrastructure – have prevented Iraq from reaching projected export volumes, but total government revenues have been higher than anticipated due to high oil prices. Despite political uncertainty, Iraq has established the institutions needed to implement economic policy, has successfully concluded a three-stage debt reduction agreement with the Paris Club, and is working toward a Standby Arrangement with the IMF. The Standby Arrangement would clear the way for continued debt relief from the Paris Club.\n\nGDP (purchasing power parity)\n\n$94.1 billion (2005 est.)\n\nGDP (official exchange rate)\n\n$46.5 billion (2005 est.)\n\nGDP – real growth rate\n\n-3% (2005 est.)\n\nGDP – per capita (PPP)\n\n$3,400 (2005 est.)\n\nGDP – composition by sector\n\nagriculture: 7.3%; industry: 66.6%; services: 26.1% (2004 est.)\n\nLabor Force\n\n7.4 million (2004 est.)\n\nLabor Force – By Occupation\n\nagriculture NA%, industry NA%, services NA%\n\nUnemployment Rate\n\n25% to 30% (2005 est.)\n\nPopulation Below Poverty Line\n\nNA%\n\nHousehold Income or Consumption by Percentage Share\n\nlowest 10%: NA%; highest 10%: NA%\n\nInflation Rate (Consumer Prices)\n\n40% (2005 est.)\n\nBudget\n\nrevenues: $19.3 billion; expenditures: $24 billion; including capital expenditures of $5 billion (2005 budget)\n\nAgriculture – Products\n\nwheat, barley, rice, vegetables, dates, cotton; cattle, sheep, poultry\n\nIndustries\n\npetroleum, chemicals, textiles, leather, construction materials, food processing, fertilizer, metal fabrication/processing\n\nIndustrial Production Growth Rate\n\nNA%\n\nElectricity – Production\n\n31.7 billion kWh (2005)\n\nElectricity – Consumption\n\n33.3 billion kWh (2005)\n\nElectricity – Exports\n\n0 kWh (2005)\n\nElectricity – Imports\n\n2.02 billion kWh (2005)\n\nOil – Production\n\n2.093 million bbl/day; note – prewar production (in 2002) was 2.03 million bbl/day (2005 est.)\n\nOil – Consumption\n\n351,500 bbl/day (2005 est.)\n\nOil – Exports\n\n1.42 million bbl/day (2005 est.)\n\nOil – Imports\n\nNA bbl/day\n\nOil – Proved Reserves\n\n112.5 billion bbl (2005 est.)\n\nNatural Gas – Production\n\n1.5 billion cu m (2003 est.)\n\nNatural Gas – Consumption\n\n1.5 billion cu m (2003 est.)\n\nNatural Gas – Exports\n\n0 cu m (2004 est.)\n\nNatural Gas – Imports\n\n0 cu m (2004 est.)\n\nNatural Gas – Proved Reserves\n\n3.115 trillion cu m (2005)\n\nCurrent Account Balance\n\n$-9.447 billion (2004 est.)\n\nExports\n\n$17.78 billion f.o.b.
