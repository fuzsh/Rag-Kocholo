        "text": "BAGHDAD, Iraq, June 8 â€” Al Qaeda's leader in Iraq, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, was killed in an American airstrike on an isolated safe house north of Baghdad at 6:15 p.m. local time on Wednesday, top American and Iraqi officials said today. Islamic militant Web sites linked to Al Qaeda quickly confirmed the death, saying Mr. Zarqawi had been rewarded with \"martyrdom\" for his role in the war here.\n\nAt a joint news conference with Iraq's prime minister, Nuri Kamal al-Maliki, the top American military commander in Iraq, Gen. George W. Casey Jr., said Mr. Zarqawi's body had been positively identified by fingerprints, \"facial recognition\" and \"known scars.\"\n\nSix people were killed in the strike: Mr. Zarqawi, his spiritual adviser and four other people including a woman and a child, the military said. The strike had been accompanied by a ground assault involving American and Iraqi troops.\n\nThe announcement of Mr. Zarqawi's death, shortly before noon today in Baghdad, 4 a.m. Eastern time, marked a major watershed in the war. With a $25 million American bounty on his head, the Jordanian-born Mr. Zarqawi has been the most-wanted man in Iraq for his leadership of Islamic terrorist groups that have carried out many of the most brutal attacks of the war, including scores of suicide bombings, kidnappings and beheadings. In his late 30's, he had been named \"Prince of Al Qaeda\" in Iraq by Osama bin Laden, Al Qaeda's fugitive leader."
