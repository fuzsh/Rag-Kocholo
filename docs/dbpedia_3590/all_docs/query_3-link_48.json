        "text": "Al-Sadr has been well represented in the Iraqi parliament and every government since 2003. He has played a crucial role in the naming of every premier, from Ibrahim al-Jaafari in 2005, to Mustapha al-Kadhimi in 2020.\n\nDespite his prominence, Iraq observers are uncertain of what to make of him.\n\nSome describe him as a selfless nationalist who wants to wrestle Iraq from both US and Iranian tutelage, while others see him as a thug with blood on his hands (in reference to the April 2003 assassination of prominent Shiite leader Abdul Majid al-Khoei, who was killed on al-Sadr's orders, according to the Americans, just days after their troops rumbled into al-Najaf).\n\nCritics claim that al-Sadr's only objective is to consolidate power within his own family, especially after winning 73 out of 329 seats in Iraq's parliament last October.\n\nClaiming to hold a clear majority, Sadr has tried to impose a figure of his choice as prime minister, refusing to share power with other Shiite leaders in the Iran-backed Coordination Framework (CF).\n\nWhen they refused to endorse his candidate — his cousin and brother-in law Jaafar al-Sadr — al-Sadr ordered his MPs to resign from parliament, hoping that the move would bring down the entire chamber.\n\nThat did not happen and was actually used by the CF to squeeze him out of the process of forming a cabinet, amid claims they were now the single largest bloc in Parliament.\n\nIn retaliation, his followers stormed the Iraqi Parliament in late July 2022, paralysing the state and its legislative branch.\n\nIconic figures\n\nWalking through the Shiite neighbourhood of Sadr City, one can see giant posters of al-Sadr clad in black, photoshopped next to his late father Sadiq and father-in-law Baqir al-Sadr. These two iconic figures in Iraqi history remain crucial to his career and to the story of Iraqi Shiites.\n\nAlthough many years have passed since they were both killed on Saddam Hussein's orders, al-Sadr never tires of mentioning them or stressing their importance to the history of Iraq and that of the Shiite community, in particular.\n\nIn the seminal work, \"Muqtada\", award-winning journalist Patrick Cockburn names Baqir al-Sadr, who was killed in 1980, as Sadr I, the First Martyr, and Muqtada's father Sadiq, assassinated in 1999, is identified as Sadr II, or the Second Martyr.\n\nWhen leading an armed insurgency against the Americans in 2004, Muqtada often referred to himself as the Third Martyr. That would make him Sadr III.\n\nIdentifying martyrs by such numbers is not new to the Shiites, and they regularly use such terminology in reference to two of their early martyred scholars, Jamal al-Din al-Makki and Zein al-Din Bin Ali al-Jebai al-Ameli.\n\nTo better understand al-Sadr, we need to take a deeper look at the history of his illustrious family, along with the role models in his life who have forged his identity and influenced his politics.\n\nWhen Baqir al-Sadr was born in Iraq's city of al-Kadhimiyya in 1935, the country was then ruled by the Hashemite family — descendants of the Prophet Mohammad who had been given seats of power by the British — first in Syria, then in Jordan and Iraq.\n\nThe first king of Iraq, Faisal I, had courted the Shiites lavishly, appointing Rustom Haydar, a notable from Baalbak, as his personal envoy and finance minister, while making Mohammad al-Sadr — a second cousin of Muqtada's father — as president of the Iraqi Senate in 1929.\n\nMohammad al-Sadr would eventually become prime minister of Iraq, albeit briefly, in 1948. King Faisal even chose 18 Dhu al-Hijja on the Muslim calendar (23 August) as the date of his 1921 coronation in Baghdad, which is when Shiite Muslims believe that the Prophet Mohammad singled out his cousin and son-in-law Ali as his successor.\n\nResponse to liberalisation\n\nBaqir grew up in a tolerant society. His father Haydar had died young, and he was raised by his elder brother Ismail, who, in 1946, sent him to study Shiite Islam in the holy city of al-Najaf, 160-km south of Baghdad.\n\nBy all accounts Baqir was an exceptionally smart and talented student, who helped establish a religiously driven political party named al-Dawa (The Call) in 1957.\n\nFounded in al-Najaf, al-Dawa was established in response to the increasingly liberal and secular views that were infiltrating Iraq and the broader Arab world.\n\nMuch of that secularism was inspired by colonial powers like France and Great Britain, who had just recently left the area. Women were unveiling. Men were no longer going to mosques, except on Fridays.\n\nSome Iraqi women were even starting to engage in politics through the Iraqi Communist Party, then, at its zenith during the Cold War, calling on them to break the bonds of male-dominated society.\n\nThat struck a particularly raw nerve with pious Muslims like Baqir al-Sadr — then a young man of 23 — who promoted al-Dawa as a protector of Islamic values.\n\nBaqir also joined a Shiite seminary (hazwa), through which he met a 62-year-old Iranian cleric named Ruhollah Khomeini sometime in late 1965. Khomeini had been banished from his country for opposing the secular and pro-Western rule of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and was to stay in Iraq for a total of 14 years until 1978.\n\nHe knew exactly who the Sadrs were, given that they traced their lineage directly to the Prophet Mohammad through the seventh Shiite imam, Musa al-Kazim.\n\nThere was an Iranian branch to the Sadr family into which Musa al-Sadr was born in 1928. He eventually moved to Lebanon in the late 1950s and established the Movement of the Dispossessed (aka AMAL), with whom Khomeini was well acquainted.\n\nKhomeini courted the young Baqir al-Sadr, inspiring revolution in his heart and the hearts of al-Dawa members. They watched in awe as he lectured them on an Islamic state where there is no constitution but the Holy Quran and no rule of law except the hadith and behaviour of the Prophet.\n\nExpanded activism\n\nBaqir and his friends had already started to expand their political activism, after a bloody revolution toppled and butchered the young king, Faisal II, along with his entire family on 14 July, 1958. They were shot and their bodies mutilated along with pro-American premier, Nuri Pashi al-Sa'id.\n\nIraq's new strongman Abdul Karim Qassim was half-Shiite from his mother's side, and he ordered the construction of homes and infrastructure in what was to become an all-Shiite suburb, created to serve the community's poor and needy.\n\nIt was first called al-Thawra (Revolution City after the 1958 Revolution) before Saddam changed it to Saddam City in 1982. After Saddam's downfall in 2003, Muqtada renamed it Sadr City, after his slain father, Sadiq al-Sadr.\n\nHowever, Baqir's relationship with the officer class had its ups-and-downs. In January 1970, his supporters were accused of wanting to stage a coup against Iraq's Baathist president, Ahmad Hasan al-Bakr.\n\nTwo years later, Baqir was arrested briefly for anti-government sermons, only to be released due to the sheer weight and number of his constituency throughout the Iraqi south.\n\nHowever, 74 members of al-Dawa, hailing from al-Najaf, Karbala and Basra were executed. The party's leader in Baghdad, Sahib al-Dakhil, disappeared and was never seen again.\n\nWhen Iraq's security chief Fadil al-Barrak asked Baqir to omit a phrase in one of his books criticising socialism — one of the main pillars on which the ruling Baath Party was founded — he agreed, trying to avoid a confrontation with the security apparatus.\n\nHowever, when he was later asked to ghostwrite a book on religion for President al-Bakr, Baqir said no.\n\nStriking a nerve\n\nThe turning point in Baqir al-Sadr's career came when the Islamic Revolution in Iran toppled the autocratic Shah in February 1979, overthrowing the Pahlava dynasty that had been in power since the mid-1920s.\n\nBaqir could not hold back his joy, sending an envoy to Tehran to congratulate his old friend, Imam Khomeini, while calling for three days of celebrations in al-Najaf.\n\nHe probably didn't think that this would anger Iraqi officialdom, which was never too fond of the Shah, accusing him, among other things, of being an agent of Western imperialism, an ally of the US, and a friend of Israel.\n\nBut the sheer thought of a turbaned cleric overthrowing an omnipotent president or king was enough to send shivers down the spine of Iraqi's powerful vice-president at the time, Saddam Hussein.\n\nWhen he assumed power that July, Saddam ordered an immediate crackdown on al-Dawa, arresting anywhere between 2,000-4,000 of Baqir's supporters, while sending 200 of them to the gallows."
