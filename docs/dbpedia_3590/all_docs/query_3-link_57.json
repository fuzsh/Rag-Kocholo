        "text": "FARGO, N.D. - When the war in Iraq began March 19, 2003, nearly 700 North Dakota Guardsmen were weeks behind the initial movement to combat. Hundreds more followed during the past eight years. But now, as the mission winds down and the U.S. prepares to withdraw all military forces by the end of this month, there’s just one who remains. Staff Sgt. Teresa Pavljuk, with the 119th Wing Logistics Readiness Squadron, extended in country to help with the drawdown. She will be the last North Dakota Guardsman to serve in Operation New Dawn, which succeeded Operation Iraqi Freedom.\n\nThe tradition of excellence she continues was carried for nearly a decade by 2,000 North Dakota Guardsmen. Eight lost their lives in Iraq in the effort, and dozens of others were wounded in action. In all, 12 North Dakota National Guardsmen have died fighting in the global war on terrorism. An unknown number suffer the effects of post-traumatic stress disorder. Nevertheless, few would argue the value of the legacy they have left in a troubled country.\n\n“Our Guardsmen have served and sacrificed in Iraq for the past eight years, and their families and employers have showed their commitment through their own service,” said Maj. Gen. David Sprynczynatyk, North Dakota adjutant general. “Their efforts will live on through the lives they saved, the tactics and techniques they developed, and the people they touched. We will never forget those Guardsmen who gave everything, and their families will forever be in our prayers.”\n\nPavljuk’s mission is historic in being not only the last in the Iraq war effort, but the first from North Dakota to deploy from her career field, which is a relatively new mission for the North Dakota Air National Guard. She arrived in Iraq in March and spent six months as the cargo non-commissioned officer in charge of a ramp section that inventoried cargo for accountability and tracking. She chose to extend her deployment to help with the drawdown and is working 12-hour days as part of the mission and volunteering her time beyond that.\n\n“With all of the events I am involved in, I have quickly become known as the ‘volunteer queen.’ I have spent the remainder of my little free time participating in the 447th Expeditionary Logistics Readiness Squadron’s adopt-a-road clean up and in the Good Neighbor Program, where we give out clothes, supplies and candy to Iraqi children and families that are part of the Iraqi military,” said Pavljuk, who expects to be home by the end of the month, but has no specific return date yet.\n\nHere’s a glimpse of the previous eight years of service in Iraq by North Dakota Guardsmen.\n\n142nd Engineer Battalion (Combat Heavy)\n\nWith only days of notice, 502 soldiers with the North Dakota National Guard, along with 145 Soldiers from Minnesota comprising Company C, mobilized to Fort Carson, Colo., in January 2003. They lived in a maintenance bay and trained for their mission until April. At midnight local time on April 27, 2003, 142nd Soldiers crossed the Kuwait-Iraq border, becoming the first North Dakota unit in Iraq for the war. While there, the battalion provided construction support for roads, airfields, fortification measures and buildings before returning home in March 2004.\n\n“They had only one week’s notice to report to the mob(ilization) station, and despite the difficult and trying conditions, they came together as a team from the very beginning and never looked back,” said Col. David Anderson, who commanded the battalion. “The 142nd performed courageously and played a critical role in supporting and establishing the theater of operations logistics base near Balad. Throughout the deployment, the soldiers and families of the 142nd demonstrated ‘resilience’ before that term became a part of the Army.”\n\n957th Engineer Company (Multi-Role Bridge)\n\nThe 175 soldiers of this Bismarck-based unit found themselves packing quickly in February 2003, when they mobilized to Fort Leonard Wood, Mo., for training in anticipation of a war beginning in Iraq. Like the 142nd, they arrived in Iraq in April and began to haul cargo as well as transport, assemble, disassemble and maintain U.S. Army bridging systems. They were the first unit to be equipped with new Common Bridge Transport trucks for the mission.\n\nThree soldiers were killed during the mission, and four were seriously wounded.\n\n“Our unit was very young. Our average age was 21, and I think many people had their doubts about us going to Iraq. What they didn’t know was that many of us had trained together for five years or more,” said Capt. Janet Masseth, who deployed with the 957th as an enlisted soldier. “… We were ready for our deployment, and I know I really wanted to go to Iraq. We were very proud, and we wanted to show not only our state but the nation what we were made of.”\n\n141st Engineer Combat Battalion\n\nAs nearly 700 Guardsmen prepared to return home from Operation Iraqi Freedom I, 480 more with the 141st was gearing up for part two. They mobilized to Fort Carson in December 2003, and arrived overseas two months later. In a first-of-its-kind mission, the battalion took on Task Force Trailblazer — clearing supply routes of improvised explosive devices and other hazards. The dangerous mission claimed the lives of four soldiers and left about two dozen others wounded. Yet, hundreds of lives were saved by their efforts.\n\nBetween March 12, 2004, and Jan. 29, 2005, the Guardsmen found 311 IEDs and destroyed about 10,000 pieces of unexploded ordnance, effectively preventing further IED development. Before returning home in February 2005, the engineers also sanitized more than 400 miles of roadways, which removed locations for hiding IEDs to prevent future emplacement. During the course of the mission, Guardsmen refined techniques and were able to provide a significant amount of data to enhance training and assist in follow-on Trailblazer missions.\n\nBattery F, 1st Battalion, 188th Air Defense Artillery Regiment\n\nIn the first of many global war on terrorism deployments for the 1-188th ADA, 100 Soldiers mobilized in June 2004 for training at Fort Bliss, Texas, and Fort Polk, La., before arriving in Iraq in December. Under the command of Maj. Jeff Jones, the unit trained Iraqi military forces and played an instrumental role ensuring the Iraqi free election process went smoothly.\n\n“We were a part of changing history,” said Retired 1st Sgt. Brad Aune, the senior enlisted leader on the mission. “Fox Battery provided election site security for the first democratic election ever in Iraq. Working and training the Iraqi army was another great experience. Because of our training and mentorship of the Iraqi Battalion, we were able to turn over the security and operation of our battle space to the Iraqi army when we left Iraq. I believe that our unit had a real sense of pride that we did make a difference during the time we were in Iraq.”\n\nCompany A, 164th Engineer Battalion\n\nFollowing in the tracks established by the 141st, the 164th Battalion mobilized to Fort Riley, Kan., in August 2005 before taking on the Trailblazer mission in Iraq in November 2005. During their year in Iraq, the unit located 470 IEDs and patrolled more than 86,000 miles. Beyond the hundreds of lives saved by their main mission, two soldiers dived into an irrigation canal during the deployment to save a drowning Iraqi boy. Sgt. Guy Stevens and Spc. Kyle Mueller were both awarded the Soldiers Medal for their heroic efforts.\n\nOne soldier died while performing the Trailblazer mission, and 11 others were wounded before the unit returned home in November 2006. Of the unit’s 122 soldiers, 107 earned Combat Action Badges during the mission, and the unit as a whole received the Excellence in Safety Award.\n\n1-129th Mobile Public Affairs Detachment\n\nWhile not specifically deployed to Iraq, the 13 soldiers in the MPAD spent time on the ground there during their mission to support U.S. Central Command and tell the story of U.S. service members’ efforts in the global war on terrorism.\n\nThe journalists, photographers and videographers mobilized in April 2006, training at Fort McCoy, Wis., before heading to locations at CENTCOM headquarters in Tampa, Fla., and an overseas base in Qatar. From Qatar, they forward deployed to Iraq, as well as Bahrain, Afghanistan, Kuwait, Kyrgyzstan, United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and Djibouti before demobilizing in June 2007.\n\n119th Maintenance Squadron\n\nSeventeen airmen from the 119th Wing contributed their aviation maintenance skills in Balad, Iraq, from February through April 2007. The Duluth, Minn.-based 148th Fighter Wing was deployed there, as well, and maintenance personnel from the Fargo-based Air Guard assisted in maintaining the unit’s F-16 fighter jets.\n\n“While stationed in Balad, otherwise known as Camp Anaconda, the military called for a major surge in operations. During our time spent there, we were under mortar fire daily,” said Master Sgt. Ted Robinette. “Several of our airmen not only performed their daily routines, but donated their own down time to helping at the hospital, unloading wounded servicemen brought in by helicopter and aiding the doctors and nurses at the Contingency Aeromedical Staging Facility to MEDEVAC the injured — sometimes severely — out of country.”\n\nEngineer Brigade, 34th Infantry Division\n\nAfter mobilizing to Camp Atterbury, Ind., in March 2007 for a month of training, the Brigade’s 45 soldiers headed to Iraq for a unique mission. Under the command of Col. Dale Adams, the unit integrated into the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Gulf Region Division and took on the responsibility of managing engineering projects, including restoring electrical power, providing potable water and constructing schools and medical facilities. Unit members were spread throughout Iraq until returning home in March 2008.\n\n“My time in Iraq was both unique and difficult to describe,” said Command Sgt. Maj. Orville Wang, the senior enlisted leader for the deployment, who oversaw about 350 service members and civilians doing engineering and contracting work in Iraq. “Providing leadership of a primarily civilian force in a combat area, with all the kinetic activity in a full 360 environment, is hard to explain, let alone manage. I am most thankful that this deployment time is over and behind me. I would like to believe that I’m a better NCO because of my experience in Iraq.”\n\n132nd Quartermaster Company\n\nSoon after the Engineer Brigade arrived in Iraq, the 132nd mobilized for its own mission. After two months of training at Fort Hood, Texas, the 21 soldiers arrived in country in July 2007. The Guardsmen forward deployed to several locations across Iraq where they provided potable water.\n\nHeadquarters and Headquarters Company, 164th Engineer Battalion\n\nIn the second deployment to Iraq for the 164th, 119 soldiers mobilized in June 2007. They trained at Camp Shelby, Miss., until starting their mission of providing perimeter and internal security for the Victory Base Complex and Baghdad International Airport in September. Under Lt. Col. Steven Jahner’s leadership, the Guardsmen provided security and presence patrols in and around Victory Base and Baghdad, as well as command and control for units from Iowa, Minnesota and California before returning home in May 2008.\n\n817th Engineer Company (Sapper)\n\nHaving formerly deployed as Company B, 141st Engineer Combat Battalion, this Jamestown unit was again mobilized for its expertise in the Trailblazer mission. In June 2007, 104 soldiers mobilized to Fort McCoy, Wis., and were in Iraq by September. The unit incorporated Soldiers from the 815th Engineer Company, as well. Before returning home in June 2008, soldiers cleared 119 IEDs, saving countless lives. Under the command of Capt. Craig Hillig, the unit also conducted 575 combat patrol missions and cleared about 51,000 miles of roadway in Iraq.\n\n119th Civil Engineer Squadron\n\nIn 2008, 35 airmen from CES deployed to Iraq, with 23 serving at Sather Air Base near Baghdad and 12 serving at Joint Base Balad. Their mission there included building and improving coalition force structures.\n\n“Master Sgt. Terry Babler was among the first builders into some areas of Iraq because he had to clear the ground with heavy equipment in order to begin building a forward operating base for coalition forces where none had existed before,” said Chief Master Sgt. Scott Terry, the senior enlisted airman on the mission. “We were very busy working at making the bases better over there, but that was OK because we didn’t have time to worry about little things and it made the time go by faster.”\n\nMaj. John Gibbs, base civil engineer, also spoke highly of the engineers’ efforts.\n\n“Our mission was to send people over there to build and improve military operating bases, although Maj. Jon Wahlgren also worked with the local communities to help them rebuild their infrastructure,” Gibbs said. “He was specifically working with helping them to bring back their electrical systems. Jon went into some of those communities very shortly after they were cleared of insurgents.”\n\n191st Military Police Company\n\nIn the first deployment for the recently re-established MP Company, the 191st began its mission in January 2008 at Fort Dix, N.J., and arrived in Iraq that April. The 182 soldiers, under the command of Capt. Ben Cleghorn, provided security and support until returning home in January 2009.\n\n119th Security Forces Squadron\n\nSecurity Forces members deployed to Iraq numerous times during the war there, including a mission from November 2003 through March 2004 with 13 volunteer airmen in Baghdad and Tallil Air Base and another stint from October 2005 to April 2006 at Tallil Air Base. A larger group of 26 airmen deployed again from February through August 2009, providing security support at Kirkuk Air Base.\n\nMaster Sgt. Erik Clemenson served on two of the missions, including as the non-commissioned officer in charge of the 2009 deployment, during which airmen were divided into small groups working multiple different sectors and shifts.\n\n“We worked general base security with personnel along the perimeter in towers, others working base entry control points involving search points for both personnel and vehicles. Some worked in the law enforcement area, which dealt with mostly internal base issues,” he said. “… Multiple different individuals received local recognition for excellence based on their normal work duties and some for their additional duties.”\n\n1st Battalion, 188th Air Defense Artillery Regiment (Sentinel Radar)\n\nThree groups from the ADA mobilized together in November 2009, with two groups headed to Afghanistan and a third group of eight arriving in Iraq in January 2010. The soldiers in Iraq were split among four Brigade Air Defense and Air Management cells throughout northern Iraq where they operated the AN/MPQ-64 Sentinel Radar. It was the first time North Dakota soldiers used the system in a combat zone to alert short-range air-defense weapons to sites of hostile targets. During the deployment, the Guardsmen worked to coordinate and deconflict airspace throughout Iraq.\n\n“These soldiers have done a tremendous job and have represented the state of North Dakota extremely well throughout this entire deployment,” said Sgt. 1st Class Michael Kraft, of Devils Lake, N.D., the senior member of the team. “It’s what is expected of soldiers from our state.”\n\nCompany C, 2nd Battalion, 285th Aviation Assault Regiment\n\nMore than a year after being put on alert, the 2-285th mobilized in October 2009, flying UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters from Bismarck to its mobilization station in Fort Sill, Okla. They arrived in Iraq two months later and provided transport to many high-profile passengers, including the deputy secretary of state, sergeant major of the Army and many morale, welfare and recreation performers.\n\nCapt. Douglas Larsen and 1st Sgt. Dan Marquardt led the unit, and during its time in Iraq, the 47 soldiers accumulated 5,000 hours of flight time. In a normal training environment in North Dakota, it would take pilots about four years and crew chiefs about five years to acquire that many training hours.\n\nIndividual Deployments\n\nWhile 2,000 N.D. Guardsmen deployed in groups, a smaller number had the additional challenge of deploying individually. Their skills were utilized in weapons video systems and as lawyers, doctors and chaplains. Others provided key consultation roles. For example, Col. Michael Wobbema played a key role in helping to establish a training program for pilots in the Iraq air force during a yearlong deployment to Baghdad. The year prior, Maj. Teresa McDonough deployed to Baghdad for six months in 2006 to coordinate security for the U.S. Embassy there as well as security for more than 200 movements by Dr. Ibrahim al-Jaafari, who was Iraq’s prime minister at the time. Meeting al-Jaafari and his chief of staff, Dr. Tamimi, was the most memorable part of her deployment.\n\n“His personality was genuine. He spoke softly but his English was excellent,” McDonough said. “My hope for a successful future of Iraqi government strengthened after meeting these gentlemen. In a three-hour visit, Dr. Jaafari spoke of his admiration for the United States and was extremely educated on our nation’s history. He mentioned the leadership styles of several of our presidents, vice presidents, and the years they served. He spoke about our Civil War, our Thanksgiving holiday, his thoughts about Hitler and all the World Wars, navigation via the stars, women’s liberation in America. I was impressed with Dr. Jaafari’s views on women and family.”\n\nComing to an End\n\nAs eight years of missions draw to a close this month, North Dakota Guardsmen reflect on their service more than ever. The memories shared move far beyond the mortars and IEDs, though. It’s about the people — the soldiers who gave their lives for the cause, the Guardsmen with whom they’ve formed an indelible bond, and the Iraqis, whom they hope are living a better life because of the military’s efforts.\n\n“One of my most memorable times would be during our long convoys between Iraq and Kuwait,” Masseth said. “Not the driving part — the flat tires, the maintenance issues, the attacks, getting lost, using the bathroom on the side of the road — but when we pulled over for the night. We would spend the night on our trucks — the time … after completing maintenance and after weapons cleaning and anything else we had to do. I remember how much I enjoyed visiting with my other unit members after a long day. No matter how smelly we were or how tired we were, I could always get a smiled out of my battle buddies and they could always get one from me. Sure I remember the horrible sand flies that would drive us crazy and sweating so much that it was hard to fall asleep. Even now after all these years when I close my eyes I can still see the stars. The stars in Iraq shined brighter than anywhere else I have ever been. They were beautiful.”\n\nNorth Dakota Guardsmen killed in Iraq\n\nSpc. Jonathan Fettig, 30, of Dickinson, N.D., was killed July 22, 2003, outside of Ar Ramadi, Iraq. He was serving with the Bismarck-based 957th Engineer Company (Multi-Role Bridge) when the Heavy Expanded-Mobility Tactical Truck he was in was hit by a rocket-propelled grenade.\n\nStaff Sgt. Kenneth W. Hendrickson, 41, of Bismarck, N.D., and Sgt. Keith L. Smette, 25, of Makoti, N.D., died from wounds they received in action Jan. 24, 2004, north of Fallujah, Iraq. They were serving with the Bismarck-based 957th Engineer Company (Multi-Role Bridge) when their convoy was attacked by an improvised explosive device.\n\nSpc. James Holmes, 28, of Peoria, Ariz., and East Grand Forks, Minn., died in Germany on May 8, 2004, of wounds he received in action on May 3 when an improvised explosive device detonated on his vehicle during a patrol near Baqubah, Iraq. He was serving with the Hettinger-based Company C, 141st Engineer Combat Battalion.\n\nSpc. Philip D. Brown, 21, of Jamestown, N.D., died of wounds he received in action May 8, 2004, west of Samarra, Iraq. He was on a dismounted patrol with the Jamestown-based Company B, 141st Engineer Combat Battalion.\n\nStaff Sgt. Lance J. Koenig, 33, of Fargo, N.D., was killed in action Sept. 22, 2004, while on a dismounted patrol near Tikrit, Iraq. He was serving with the Jamestown-based Company B, 141st Engineer Combat Battalion.\n\nSpc. Cody L. Wentz, 21, of Williston, N.D., was killed in action Nov. 4, 2004, near Balad, Iraq. He was serving as a MK-19 gunner on a mounted patrol with Company A, 141st Engineer Combat Battalion.\n\nSpc. Michael L. Hermanson, 21, of Fargo, N.D., died May 24, 2006, of injuries sustained when the RG-31 Mine-Protected Vehicle he was in was attacked by an improvised explosive device, rocket-propelled grenade and small-arms fire. He was serving with the Minot-based Company A, 164th Engineer Battalion.\n\nAdditionally, the North Dakota National Guard has lost four soldiers fighting in the global war on terrorism in Afghanistan. Sgt. Travis A. VanZoest, 21, of Bismarck, N.D., and Spc. Curtis R. Mehrer, 21, also of Bismarck, were killed in Khogyani, Afghanistan, while serving with the 1st Battalion, 188th Air Defense Artillery Regiment’s Security Forces deployment. Two other soldiers with their unit also were killed. Cpl. Nathan Goodiron, 25, of Mandaree, N.D.,was killed in action Nov. 23, 2006, and Cpl. Christopher Kleinwachter, 29, of Wahpeton, N.D., was killed less than a week later on Nov. 29."
