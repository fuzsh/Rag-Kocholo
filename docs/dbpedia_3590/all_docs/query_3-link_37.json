(New York Times)\n\nRadioactive Wounds of War (August 25, 2005)\n\nSome US soldiers returning from Iraq have tested positive for contamination from Depleted Uranium (DU).

While the Pentagon claims that DU poses no health threat, experts agree that it is toxic and can lead to cancer in those who have been exposed to it. (In These Times)\n\nThe Iraq War Is Over, and the Winner Is... Iran (July 21, 2005)\n\nProfessor Juan Cole points out that ironically, Iran may have benefited from the Iraq War more than any other state, including the US. His analysis comes in the wake of Iraqi Prime Minister Ibrahim al-Jaafari's trip to Iran in July. In the meetings, the leaders of Iraq and Iran discussed oil pipelines, trade and financial aid, and they talked about possible military cooperation along their common borders. Warming relations between the two countries could enhance Iran's geopolitical standing, a prospect which worries the US and Iraqi Sunnis, says Cole.

(Observer)\n\nPowell and Europeans See UN Role in Postwar Iraq (April 4, 2003)\n\nEuropean leaders want the UN to play an organizing role as quickly as possible in Iraq, but Washington wants its role to be limited to humanitarian assistance. (New York Times)\n\nWho Rules the Peace (April 3, 2003)\n\nAccording to Phyllis Bennis, the Geneva Convention states that the occupying powers are obligated to provide for the humanitarian needs of the Iraqi population.

(ZNet)\n\nWar by Example (April 3-9, 2003)\n\nRoger Owen, a professor of history at Harvard University's Center for Middle Eastern Studies, argues that the new US defense doctrine, based on the notion of preventive response, means that the current US war against Iraq is also meant to provide a test case for future instances in which the US will attempt \"to impose its world view.\" (Al-Ahram Weekly)\n\nBeyond the Veto (April 3-9, 2003)\n\nThis article from the Egyptian newspaper Al-Ahram Weeklyexamines the options open to the UN to delegitimize the US invasion of Iraq.\n\nWhite House Divided Over Reconstruction (April 2, 2003)\n\nThe US administration is divided on who should lead Iraq's transitional government after the war.
