        "text": "Picture Credit: Bag News Notes\n\nSince the US invaded Iraq and overthrew the government of Saddam Hussein, several bodies have successfully claimed authority over the Iraqi state. The occupiers established the Coalition Provisional Authority in April 2003, staffed by many Bush administration political appointees and led initially by General Jay Garner and later by L. Paul Bremer III. The CPA governed Iraq until June 2004. In preparation for the \"transfer of sovereignty,\" the CPA handpicked 25 Iraqi representatives to make up the Iraqi Governing Council, including Ahmad Chalabi and other Iraqi exiles who supported the US invasion. In June 2004, the CPA disbanded and transferred authority to the Iraqi Interim Government, headed by US favorite Iyad Allawi, and comprised of many members of the earlier Governing Council. Following the January 2005 elections, which were largely boycotted by the Sunni Arab population, the Iraqi Transitional Government was established in May 2005, under the leadership of Kurdish President Jalal Talabani and Shiite Prime Minister Ibrahim al-Jaafari.\n\nThe October 2005 elections for a permanent, 4-year National Assembly brought in greater Sunni representation, and witnessed the rise of the anti-occupation cleric Muqtada al-Sadr. Ongoing political haggling and US interference have slowed the formation of a permanent government, and led to the sacking of Prime Minister al-Jaafari in favor of fellow Shiite politician Nouri al-Maliki. Since the official transfer of sovereignty, roughly 150,000 US troops have remained in Iraq with the 'surge' strategy of General David H. Petraeus bringing the number to 180,000. The US Ambassador, Ryan C Crocker, along with General Petraues delivered a report on the success of the strategy to Congress in September 2007 but refused to set a timetable for withdrawal.\n\nThis page examines the various leaders and occupiers that have held power in Iraq following the US invasion and occupation including influential religious and trade union leaders, US state department leaders and a guide to the executive and legislative branches of the Iraqi government.\n\nÂ\n\nÂ\n\nArticles on Iraqi Parliament and Cabinet Structure\n\n2007 | 2006 | 2005\n\n2007\n\nDiagram of Political Affiliations and Alliances in the Iraqi Parliament (Summer 2007)\n\nThis diagram shows political configurations in the Iraqi parliament. A number of political blocs have now united across the previous sectarian political divisions. Some Shi'a, Sunni, secular, and other blocs have joined together in a new alliance. There are now two major tendencies , a majority (the \"nationalist\" tendency) and a minority (the sectarian or \"separatist\" tendency). The diagram shows all the political blocs in the parliament, with their place in the old (largely sectarian) structures and their place in the newer trans-sectarian alliances. The nationalists support a centralized government and a timetable for US withdrawal. The separatists favor a highly decentralized state, foreign oil company investments and an ongoing US presence in the country. Though the separatists are in the minority, they completely dominate the executive branch and are supported by the United States. (Raed Jarrar)\n\n2006\n\nIraq Parliament Re-Opens Amid Strife (September 5, 2006)\n\nAs Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki struggles to unite his country's warring factions, the question of federalism remains at the top of Iraq's parliamentary agenda. Whilst many Shiite and Kurdish leaders push for more autonomous regions, Sunni lawmakers seek a strongly centralized and unified Iraq. As this Herald Sun article emphasizes, independent zones in the oil-rich Shiite south and Kurdish north would leave Sunnis economically isolated and enhance the fragility of an already war-torn country.\n\nMembers of Iraq's Government (July 10, 2006)\n\nThis Education for Peace in Iraq Center document provides brief biographical details of Iraqi cabinet members. After months of negotiation, Iraqi politicians agreed on the formation of a permanent, 4-year government in May 2006 under Prime Minister Nouri Al-Maliki. This document includes information on the controversial Ministries of Interior, Defense, and National Security.\n\nWho's Who in Iraq's New Cabinet (May 22, 2006)\n\nBBC provides a list of cabinet members in Iraq's government. With the Interior, Defense, and National Security ministries still vacant, Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki, and Deputy Prime Ministers Salam Zaubai and Barham Salih have temporarily assumed the respective posts. Cabinet positions are split between Iraq's various ethnic and religious groups, including 17 members of the dominant Shiite alliance, 7 Sunni coalition members, 7 Kurds, and 5 members from the secular alliance.\n\nThe New Face of Iraq's Government (April 22, 2006)\n\nWith the nomination of Nuri Kamal al-Maliki as prime minister, Iraq has ended a months-long political deadlock and moved closer to forming a permanent government. Nonetheless, questions remain over political leadership and the control of Iraq's key government ministries. In this article, the Council on Foreign Relations examines various political figures and the future of Iraq's government.\n\n2005\n\nMajor Parties and Contenders for December Parliamentary Elections (November 23, 2005)\n\nRadio Free Europe/Radio Liberty has compiled a list of major political groups participating in Iraq's December 15 parliamentary elections.

He lived in exile in Syria and Iran after he was sentenced to death in 1980 by the Saddam Hussein government for his active role in the Dawa party. He is a Shi'a Muslim, and is the secretary-general of the Islamic Dawa Party. Al-Maliki and his government succeeded the Iraqi Transitional Government and was sworn in on May 20, 2006. Al-Maliki's mandate will last until 2010.\n\nJawad al-Maliki: A Novice, but Outspoken (April 23, 2006)\n\nAfter prolonged negotiation, along with substantial pressure from the US and the UK, Interim Prime Minister Ibrahim al-Jaafari withdrew his nomination for permanent prime minister, and the United Iraqi Alliance selected fellow Dawa party member Jawad al-Maliki to replace him. Though many Iraqis welcome the change and the formation of a permanent government, Maliki is not a well-known figure in Iraq, and the public has shown mixed reactions to his nomination. While some praise his direct and decisive style, others describe him as a Shiite \"hard-liner\"and criticize his lack of political experience.

Â He is native of Fallujah in Anbar province and leader of the Abu Eissa tribe. Al-Issawi became director of Fallujah General Hospital in 2003. In 2004 he accused the US army of having blocked a team of 11 Iraqi ambulances from evacuating or helping the dead during the Second Battle of Fallujah. In 2005 al-Issawi was elected to the Iraqi Parliament and became minister of state for Foreign Affairs. Two years later, he resigned, demanding that Nouri al-Maliki's government take a stronger stance against Shi'ite Militia. Four other ministers left government at the same time. Al-Issawi returned to government in July 2008 to his current post.\n\nÂ\n\nPicture Credit:\n\nSamir Mizban\n\nAssociated Press\n\nDeputy Prime Minister Salam al-Zubai\n\nA Sunni-Arab, al-Zubai is one of two Deputy Prime Ministers. He was injured in an assassination attempt on March 23, 2007, one day after meeting with UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon on the situation in Iraq. He is the highest ranking Sunni Arab in the Maliki government; his party, the Accordance Front, is the main Sunni Arab grouping in the governing coalition. He is also a member of a well-known tribe from the Abu Ghraib area northwest of Baghdad. Commentators report that the assassination attack results from feuds between rival factions in his tribe, with one side supporting Al Qaeda militants and the other loyal to the deputy prime minister and the government.\n\nÂ\n\nPicture Credit:\n\nAssociated Press\n\nPresident Jalal Talabani\n\nJalal Talabani was named interim president on April 6, 2005. He was chosen by Iraq's two key Kurdish parties who came in second in the elections in January 2005. Talabani is a Sunni Kurd who joined the Kurdistan Democratic Party at a young age and in 1975 he established the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, one of two key Kurdish parties. He helped lead the Kurdish fight in Iraq's north against former dictator Saddam Hussein.\n\nIraqi President Backs US Senate Proposal to Decentralize Iraq (October 8, 2007)\n\nA US Senate resolution which calls for the division of Iraq into separate regions receives widespread opposition in Iraq. However, Iraqi President Jalal Talabani, a Kurd, has expressed support for the proposal and says the resolution does not undermine Iraqi unity. He also calls for a withdrawal of 100,000 US troops by the end of 2008 but suggests that three US bases remain in the country. (Voice of America)\n\nIraq's President Complains of Shiite Prime Minister Monopolizing Power (July 10, 2005)\n\nAccording to Arabic press sources, Iraqi President Jalal Talabani sent a letter to Prime Minister Ibrahim al-Jaafari in July 2005, complaining that he monopolizes power and ignores the Kurdish members of the Iraqi Cabinet. Talabani also charged that al-Jaafari has not done enough to ensure the return of displaced Kurds to Kirkuk. A Kurdish legislator said that the letter had been \"effective,\"and that al-Jaafari has agreed to apply the laws concerning the Kurds' return to the province. (Associated Press)\n\nBreakfast at Talabani's (February 24, 2004)\n\nThis article provides information on Jalal Talabani, leader of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) and member of the Iraqi Governing Council.

Sistani, once the \"voice of reason\"for many Iraqis, expressed his frustration with the government's failure to bring law, order and security to Iraq and announced he will restrict himself to religious duties. As this Asia Times article suggests, Sistani's exit leaves room for the popular Shiite leader Muqtada al-Sadr, who has won the support of many Iraqis with the creation of his own militia, the Mehdi Army, and his outspoken criticism of the US occupation forces.\n\nIraq's Shadow Ruler (October 17, 2004)\n\nIraq's most prominent Shiite spiritual leader, Grand Ayatullah Sistani, has emerged as \"the country's pivotal political figure.\"Sistani's influence reaches as far as the White House, but his aides stress that he will not take on any leading role for himself in a future government.

Sadr also calls for an end to attacks by the militia on US and coalition troops. The ceasefire comes as fighting between rival Shiite factions culminates in gun battles in Karbala.

Washington has been criticized since the beginning of the war for its reluctance to accept Iraqis, many of whom work alongside the US. Since 2003, the US has accepted only 1,521 Iraqi refugees.
