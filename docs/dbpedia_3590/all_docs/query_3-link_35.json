[Part I] ---------- TUESDAY, APRIL 20, 2004 U.S. Senate, Committee on Foreign Relations, Washington, DC. The committee met, pursuant to notice, at 9:34 a.m. in room SH-216, Hart Senate Office Building, Hon. Richard G. Lugar (chairman of the committee), presiding. Present: Senators Lugar, Hagel, Chafee, Brownback, Alexander, Biden, Feingold, Boxer, and Corzine. opening statement of senator richard g. lugar, chairman The Chairman. This hearing of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee is called to order. I will give an opening statement, and then I'll recognize the distinguished ranking member of the committee, Senator Biden, for his opening statement. We look forward to hearing from our witnesses. At his nationally televised press conference last Wednesday, President Bush unequivocally asserted that the United States was committed to advancing freedom in Iraq. He stated, and I quote, ``Now is the time, and Iraq is the place, in which the enemies of the civilized world are testing the will of the civilized world. We must not waver.'' This expression of his personal determination was welcome and necessary. The President was right when he underscored that ``the consequences of failure are unthinkable.'' American credibility in the world, progress in the war on terrorism, our relationships with our allies, the future of the Middle East, and the fate of the Iraqis themselves depend upon the resolve of the U.S. Government and the American people in achieving a positive outcome in Iraq. In short, moving the Iraqi people toward a secure, independent state is a vital United States national-security priority that requires the highest level of national commitment. The President and other leaders, including Members of Congress, must continue to communicate with the American public on this point, because the work that must be done in Iraq will test our national fortitude. American lives will continue to be at risk in Iraq, and substantial American resources will continue to be spent there for the foreseeable future. During this endeavor, we will debate every aspect of United States strategy in Iraq. This is necessary in our democracy, and such debate can strengthen our national purpose, but this debate must be constructive. What happens in Iraq during the next 18 months almost certainly will determine whether we can begin to redirect the Middle East toward a more productive and peaceful future beyond the grip of terrorist influences. Congress does not have to agree with the President's policies, but our differences of opinion must be focused on improving our chances for success. For its part, the Bush administration must recognize that its domestic credibility on Iraq will have a great impact on its efforts to succeed. On some occasions during the past year and a half, the administration has failed to communicate its Iraq plans and cost estimates to Congress and to the American people. During the weeks leading up to the war, in early 2003, the Foreign Relations Committee held multiple hearings in pursuit of answers to basic questions about plans for Iraq reconstruction. Administration officials often were unable or unwilling to provide adequate answers. In one notable case, in March 2003, General Jay Garner, Director of the Office of Reconstruction and Humanitarian Assistance at the time, chose not to testify or to send his deputy, even though he briefed the press at the same time our hearing was occurring. This week, the administration may again have missed an opportunity by declining to send the highest Defense Department official possible to testify at the Senate Foreign Relations Committee's hearings. We are appreciative of the officials who will be here, and we look forward to their testimony on Thursday. Our experiences with inadequate planning and communication related to Iraq contribute to the determination of this committee to impose a very high standard on the information provided about Iraq. We understand that some information is classified and cannot be dealt with in open session. We also understand that not every official we would like to testify will be available for every hearing. But within the substantial bounds of our oversight capacity, we will attempt to illuminate the United States plans, actions, and options with respect to Iraq, both for the benefit of the American people and to inform our own policymaking role. The administration must present a detailed plan to prove to Americans, Iraqis, and our allies that we have a strategy and that we are committed to making it work. This will be the first of three Foreign Relations Committee hearings this week on Iraq. We intend to explore whether Americans and Iraqi authorities are ready for the transition to Iraqi sovereignty on July 1, and what steps are required to fill out a comprehensive transition plan. In our current series of three hearings, the committee, first of all, will attempt to discover the details of Ambassador Lakhdar Brahimi's plan for an interim Iraqi Government to which a transfer of sovereignty is planned on June 30, 2004. Specifically, what executive and legislative positions will be established in the interim government, and how will these positions be filled? Who will choose the people? Are we confident that Iraqis will support the United Nations formula for a new government? What will the United States do if Iraqis reject the Brahimi plan? Second, what status-of-forces agreement will make clear that the United States and Coalition Armed Forces will continue to provide internal and external security for the new Iraqi Government? Will that agreement make clear the chain of command and the relationship of Iraqi police, reserves, and army personnel with United States and Coalition forces? Third, will United Nations Security Council resolutions undergird the international legitimacy of the new Iraqi Government and all of the security arrangements that it will require? Continuing and expanded support of the new Iraqi Government by other nations may require additional Security Council resolutions. Fourth, will elections for the Transitional and Permanent Iraqi Government's--scheduled for no later than January 2005, and December 2005, respectively--be held under the auspices of the United Nations or some other authority? How will that authority provide security for the elections and assemble a registration list or otherwise determine who is eligible to vote? How will we deal with elections that are postponed or deemed to be fraudulent? Will the National Assembly, which is to be elected in January 2005, have full authority to write a constitution and construct the framework of a permanent government? Fifth, we were pleased to learn yesterday that President Bush has designated Ambassador John Negroponte as his nominee to be the United States Ambassador to the new Iraqi Government. What will be the composition and the time of arrival of all of the U.S. personnel associated with the new embassy? And, sixth, will the costs associated with the new diplomatic presence be covered by a transfer of funds under the umbrella of the $87 billion appropriation enacted by Congress last year? If not, what is the plan for providing the necessary funding? Clear answers to all of these questions would constitute a coherent transition plan for Iraq. Americans should have the opportunity to view this plan and carefully monitor its progress. To help spell out such a plan is an important responsibility for a congressional committee, as part of a well-functioning constitutional system of checks and balances. We will also want to discuss how Iraqis are preparing to take over the police and security functions of a sovereign state. Equipment and training for these forces are needed urgently. Contracting problems have delayed delivery. Reports that some Iraqi units refused to be deployed, and others actually supported insurgent factions, are part of a sober assessment of the Iraqi role in a security plan. The Iraqis need to know that there is a difference between an occupied Iraq and a sovereign Iraq. Our public-information efforts must become a lot better in demonstrating to Iraqis the advantages of new freedoms. We must find more effective ways of spurring the public dialog in Iraq and supporting the aspirations of the majority of Iraqis who want peace and democracy, but who have been intimidated by purveyors of violence who cloak their actions in false nationalism. Bands of insurgents, terrorists, and murderers have made the process more difficult, but must not be allowed to determine the outcome in Iraq. To begin our examination of these questions, the committee is pleased to be joined by two impressive panels of witnesses today. On the first panel, we welcome Dr. James Schlesinger, former Secretary of Defense, former Secretary of Energy, and now senior advisor at Lehman Brothers. Dr. Schlesinger recently served as co-chair of a Council on Foreign Relations Task Force that published a comprehensive report entitled ``Iraq: One Year After.'' We also welcome Mr. Sandy Berger, the former National Security Advisory for President Clinton, and currently chairman of Stonebridge International. On our second panel, we will welcome Dr. Richard Perle, of the American Enterprise Institute, Dr. Toby Dodge, of the International Institute for Strategic Studies, and Dr. Juan Cole, of the University of Michigan. We look forward to the assessments and recommendations of our witnesses. We appreciate their presence this morning. I turn now to the distinguished ranking member of our committee, Senator Biden. opening statement of senator joseph r. biden, jr., ranking member Senator Biden. Mr. Chairman, thank you very much. As they say in this business, I'd like to associate myself with your opening statement, and I'll try not to repeat some of the specific questions that you acknowledge at the front end, that we need answered to determine whether or not there is a policy. But it's difficult. Over the last 31 years, we've both experienced being in the majority and the minority. We've experienced being in the majority when we've had a President of our own party. We've been in the minority with a President of our own party. And I just want to compliment you on not just holding these hearings, but the way in which you have been steadfast and frank and straightforward in sharing your considerable--considerable--knowledge and experience with the Senate and the American people. And you are, to state the obvious, more diplomatic than I am. I think it's outrageous the administration has not provided every witness we've asked for. I do not find it acceptable that there is a single witness that is unavailable to us that we've asked. Not a single one. This administration has taken this committee and this Congress for granted. Someone should have them read the Constitution of the United States of America and understand that, Article II, there is a legislative body. We do not work for the President. I serve with the President. I served before him, and I'll serve after him. And it is outrageous that they're making the same arrogant mistake they made when we held hearings the first time, and that is not providing every witness we ask for. You know, there was a famous member of this committee years ago who said, ``If the President wants us in on the landing, he'd better have us in on the takeoff.'' Well, this administration, and every administration, including the previous one, makes mistakes. It is virtually impossible not to make mistakes, and, in some cases, make serious mistakes. I've been here for seven Presidents. The fact of the matter is that if they had had witnesses show up at our first hearings, they might have actually had to answer questions that would have caused them to think about the premises upon which they were responding and which they based their policy. This committee, when I was Chair, and then, when you took over as Chair, immediately thereafter, has been consistent. People say to me, Mr. Chairman, ``I wish Washington weren't so partisan.'' Take a look at this committee. I don't see any partisanship in this committee. There hasn't been any partisanship on this committee. You and I both voted for giving the President the authority to go to war. We've tried to be constructive. The fact of the matter is, they're making it very difficult. And here we go again, at this critical juncture. And, you know, we've been in this business a long time, and there's a tendency--and the press probably tunes it out, and I don't blame them--to say, this is the most important moment. The truth of the matter is, this may be the last best chance to get this right for a generation. For a generation. This June 30 date is going to be one, I say to the witnesses, that historians are going to look to like they did 9/11, and 3/11 in Madrid. And they're going to look at June 30 to figure out whether we got it right. And this warrants not a partisan disagreement, but an honest engagement with the outfits that have to come up with the money, the outfit that has to sign the American people onto this, the U.S. Senate and the House of Representative and the administration. And the fact that they're not prepared to send a witness either means they are totally incompetent and they don't have anything to tell us, which would constitute incompetence, or they're refusing to allow us to fulfill our constitutional responsibility. And there's always a price to pay for that. Not a price to pay that's vindictiveness; a price to pay. When you shut out a bipartisan group of United States Senators from asking hopefully intelligent questions and probing a policy, you're doing yourself and the Nation a significant disservice. Mr. Chairman, after that statement, you may not like my next statement. I am proud to serve under you, as chairman of this committee. I am proud that you are the chairman, and I'm proud to be a part of it. Many of the challenges identified in the hearings that you and I held as the transfer of congressional power took place, many of those things we identified have turned out to be absolutely accurate, on the button, not because we did it, but because we had witnesses like the men before us, and the women who will come before us. The best minds in the country sat here, and they said that every basic premise upon which we were told--and Mr. Perle will testify next--he's not part of the administration--was going to happen was not likely to happen. We'd be greeted with open arms, there would be enough oil revenues to pay for everything, there would be an Iraqi army to stand up immediately, there would be an Iraqi police force to be able to maintain peace and security, and there would be a civil service that would be stood up immediately to be able to keep every function of government operating very quickly. The result is that we may soon be confronted with an untenable situation--American forces caught between an increasingly hostile Iraqi population, notwithstanding the Secretary of Defense's reference in private and public meetings--with me, anyway--to quote, ``flare-ups''--flare-ups--implying that this is something that's going to pass very quickly, like a brush fire--that these forces are caught between hostile Iraqi populations that they were sent to liberate, and an increasingly skeptical American public, whose support we badly, badly, badly need. I'll editorialize by saying, I think there's virtually little comparison to Vietnam here, in terms of what's at stake. When I ran for office in 1972, I disagreed with that war, and I said, ``Even if I win, if it turns out the Russian fleets end up in Cam Ranh Bay, I'll resign,'' because I was so certain that was not what it was about. But I am certain the President's right about how important it is to succeed. This is a seminal event in the Middle East. This is a seminal event. This is of incredible consequence. Walking away from this is not an option, in terms of our security. And I'm convinced, though, we can still succeed if we level with the American people about the costs and the risks. I know this is, sort of, getting it backward, I say to my colleagues that are about to testify, but I think we've got to make sure we've got American support first. First. We've got to go shore it up. No foreign policy can be sustained in this country without the informed consent of the American people, and it has not been an informed consent yet, because we have not leveled with them that it's going to cost several hundred-billion more before this is over; it's going to take tens of thousands, if not a hundred-thousand or more, troops for an extended period of time, even if we get help from other folks; that we're going to be there even if things go very well, which they're not going now, for the next 3 to 5 years, and maybe longer. And the second thing we have to do is, we have to bring along the Iraqi people. I know Jim Schlesinger knows better than anybody--he's been around a long time, and he's a brilliant guy academically, he was brilliant in terms of his service to the country, and continues to be--I know he understands the simple proposition--even though sometimes he and I have disagreed in the past, in the last 15 years, on some specific items relating to our national security--that if we can't find an Iraqi middle, if we can't find a bulk of the Iraqi people who are willing to fight and die for their own democracy, then this doesn't matter. This doesn't matter. We cannot do it. So, Mr. Chairman, we need to create an environment where the American people think this is doable and worthwhile, and the Iraqi people think--if the polling data is correct, and I believe it is--that fewer than 15 percent of the Iraqi people want a religious theocracy, like exists in Iran, which means 85 percent of the people want something else. We've got to convince them that there's a possibility of that happening, that we've got a plan, that there's a plan. Because absent that, they're not going to stick their heads up, and we're going to lose--without them investing in their own future. It's the President's responsibility to do both those things--level with the American people and provide a plan. He needs to explain the hard road ahead and the commitment we have to make, in terms of times, troops, and treasure; and he must convince the American people, the Iraqi people, and the international community that he has a strategy for success. I've used this joke so long to make a serious point; now I find other people using it. I had a baseball coach who used to tell that story about the kid who played centerfield--I was a center-fielder--and I remember the coach saying one day--after an error, saying--you know, the story about George, who played centerfield in the first three innings? He had five errors. The coach calls timeout, pulls him out, and says, ``Dick, you're in.'' First pitch, routine fly ball to Dick, hits Dick's glove, he drops it. Coach goes ballistic, calls Dick out. Dick comes running across the third-base line and says, ``Coach?'' And he says, ``What's the matter with you, Dick?'' And Dick looks at the coach and says, ``Coach, George screwed up centerfield so badly, no one can play it.'' Well, I'm joking, but I tell you, that's what they think in France, Germany, England, Portugal and Spain. And we've got to change that. We've got to change the notion that this thing is so badly broken it can't be fixed, because, as the witnesses will tell you, Europe needs us to succeed even more than we do. About 10 percent of France's population is Arabic-speaking. The Germans are deathly afraid of population flows that would come from a Kurdish-Turkish war. And the list goes on. They have a keen interest in seeing success. And, in my judgment, the most important ingredient for success is the emergence of that silent majority of Iraqis who can provide an alternative to the extremes and who can create a participatory republic when we leave. Equally important is getting the help that we need from outside Iraq, in term of troop, money, manpower, to see this mission to completion. There are three things, in my humble opinion, the President should do immediately. First, he needs to send more troops, which is now happening, to gain control of security, to give other countries confidence that they will not be walking into a centerfield that is screwed up so badly no one can play it. Second, he should bring together the major powers with the most at stake in Iraq to form an international board of directors, in some form or another, responsible for overseeing the political transition so everyone's invested--everyone's invested and has a stake in the outcome. It could be the U.N. Security Council, but it doesn't have to be. It could be an ad hoc group like the kind we formed to deal with Bosnia, or a contact group like we tried to deal with Middle East peace. It should include our European allies, probably Russia, and our friends in the Middle East. A senior representative of that board would replace Ambassador Bremer in the CPA as Iraq's primary partner, and speak with the authority of the international community, not just the United States, when they speak. Brahimi has begun to play that role, informally. I've found it fascinating. The President and his administration have downgraded the value of the United Nations, and yet in a press conference, when asked who we're going to turn power over to, the President of the United States says, ``Well, we're waiting for Brahimi to tell us.'' That's real leadership. Let's make it formal, with a clear, authoritative mandate from the major powers, starting now, carrying through till Iraq ratifies a constitution and subsequently elects a government. This would maximize a Brahimi, or whoever would follow him, leverage and our prospects for success. Third, the President should ask the U.N. to bless the agreement--not be in charge, but bless the agreement with a new resolution. None of us has any illusions about the United Nations. But its central involvement would, to quote George Will, of all people, ``usefully blur the clarity of U.S. primacy.'' The President and everybody says we've got to get an American face off of this. We're not asking, like some of my right-wing friends in my home state, say, ``Well, Biden wants to give power to the United Nations, one world government.'' This is about allowing other nations to do what is difficult to do. They opposed the war. Ninety percent of their populations don't want any part of providing for the peace, and they need some excuse to be able to give them some cover to do what they know they have to do in their own interest. Foreign leaders need this political cover. The Iraqis are more likely to listen to a partner who speaks for the world than to heed an American ambassador hunkered down in a new super embassy. And I have great respect for Mr. Negroponte. I really do. But as one of my staff sitting behind me said, ``Going from Paul Bremer, with a CPA, that at least has international involvement in it, to a super Ambassador, is like going from Clark Kent to being Superman.'' Talk about taking an American face off it, we're saying, here we are. All us, all alone. If the President does these three things, I believe several major benefits will follow. First, other countries will be much more likely to contribute resources to reconstruction. Second, NATO is more likely to get engaged, spreading the security risk and freeing up as many as 20,000 American troops to focus on the hot spots. We're not going to get 20,000 NATO forces immediately. But in my travels, which are now 3 months old, throughout the capitals of Europe, every major power said they would vote to allow this to be a NATO operation. Probably wouldn't get more than 5,000 to 7,000 thousand troops to begin with, but speaking with General Jones, the Supreme Allied Commander, that would free up the ability of the Americans to not do border patrol, and allow NATO troops to support the Poles in the south and/or the Kurds in the north, thereby freeing up significant American forces and building on this NATO operation, and, by the way, convincing the American people we're not in this alone. If NATO's in the deal, they know everybody else has a stake in it, as well. The President should immediately convene, in my view, a summit of our traditional allies in Europe, and our friends in the Arab world and Asia, to talk about what they think is needed. You know, I've found it fascinating, Mr. Secretary and National Security Advisory Berger--I've found it fascinating--I was making the case several months ago to President Chirac that, look, the President of the United States has made serious concessions here. He's moved up the date to June 30, he says we'll transfer power then, and he's backed off the insistence-- that I initially agreed with, by the way; I think I was wrong-- of saying that there had to be a constitution before there were elections, and there had to be--and so on and so forth. And he sat there politely and listened--and he is no box of chocolates, in terms of the problems he's caused us and how he's taken advantage of us--but he looked, and he said, ``Senator, it would have been nice had the administration told us they were going to do this. We read it in the paper.'' That's a good way to win friends and influence people. And throughout Europe, to the best of my knowledge, from Javier Solano on, no one, based on what I was told, was told, before they read it, that we had made this change in policy. It's time we start talking to people. We should tell them that we need their help. We should acknowledge that success in Iraq requires centrist Iraqis to step up, the world to step in, and the Middle East countries to take a chance on a representative government in Iraq, or they're likely to be gone. Then the President should ask each of them what they need in order to participate. He should work with them to forge a common plan in Iraq that they can support. And, Mr. Chairman, let me conclude with something I talked about in a speech I made last week on this subject, which is the most critical speech I've openly made of this administration thus far. I come from Delaware. I have been to Dover Air Force Base many times. The men and women there, who receive our soldiers and their families in that last long flight home from the battlefield know what this is all about. When those planes fly over Dover in the middle of the night, press not allowed to be there when they land, they remind us that this is not about politics. This is not about whether with every fiber in our being, we think we're right, or that someone else is dangerously wrong. It's not about that. This is about something bigger. It's not about assigning blame, it's not about partisanship. It's about that last long journey to the Dover Air Force Base. It's about those brave Americans who are doing everything in their power to get it right. They're doing everything in their power to get it right over there. And we owe them no less than to do everything in our power to get it right here, to acknowledge--not publicly, just privately, by policy--what's not working, acknowledge that we went with too little power and too little legitimacy. And the only way to get this right, for their sake, is to give them enough power and enough legitimacy. Because if we don't do that, those flights home to the only mortuary on the East Coast are going to be places where there are going to be a lot of not just sullen people, but sullen, angry people, that we were unwilling to try to get it right, knowing what's not working. I apologize for the length of the statement, Mr. Chairman, but I have not attended a hearing in my 31 years that I think is more consequential than what we're attempting to get right here. Thank you. [The prepared statement of Senator Biden follows:] Prepared Statement of Senator Joseph R. Biden, Jr. Mr. Chairman, I commend your leadership in calling these hearings. They come at a critical time in Iraq and for our interests in the region. I am proud of the partnership we've forged on Iraq, starting with the hearings we held in the summer of 2002. Many of the challenges identified in those hearings have been borne out. Now, I am deeply concerned that time is rapidly running out on our ability to get it right in Iraq. The result is that we may soon confront an untenable situation: American forces caught between an increasingly hostile Iraqi population that they were sent to liberate and an increasingly skeptical American public, whose support they need and deserve. I'm convinced we can still succeed if we level with the American people about the costs and the risks. If we develop a coherent plan for success and if we bring the Iraqi people and the rest of the world with us. It is the President's responsibility to level with the American people about what will be required to prevail. He needs to explain the hard road ahead and the commitment we must make in terms of time, troops and treasure. And he must convince the American people, the Iraqi people, and the international community that he has a strategy for success. I hope that our witnesses this week will help to fill in that strategy. In my judgment, the most important ingredient for success is the emergence of that silent majority of Iraqis who can provide an alternative to the extremes and can create a participatory republic when we leave. Equally important is getting the help we need from outside Iraq--in terms of troops, money and manpower--to see this mission to completion. There are three things the President should do immediately: First, he needs to send in more troops now to gain control of security and to give other countries confidence that they will not be walking into a quagmire. Second, he should bring together the major powers with the most at stake in Iraq to form an international board of directors responsible for overseeing the political transition in Iraq. It could be the U.N. Security Council. It could be an ad hoc group, like the kind we formed to deal with Bosnia. It would include our European allies, Russia and our friends in the Middle East.

That would maximize Brahimi's leverage and our prospects for success. Third, the President should ask the U.N. to bless this arrangement with a new resolution. None of us have any illusions about the U.N. But it's central involvement would, to quote George Will, ``usefully blur the clarity of U.S. primacy.'' Foreign leaders need political cover to convince their people who opposed the war to help build the peace. The Iraqis are more likely to listen to a partner who speaks for the world than to heed an American ambassador hunkered down in a super embassy. If the President does these three things, I believe several major benefits would follow. First, other countries would be much more likely contribute resources to Iraq's reconstruction. Second, NATO is more likely to get engaged, spreading the security risk and freeing up as many as 20,000 American troops to focus on the hot spots. At this late hour, it will take some powerful persuasion to get all these players in the game. But one man has the power to do just that-- to change the dynamic--to finally make Iraq the world's problem, not just our own. That man is the President of the United States. Now is the time for him to lead. The President should immediately convene a summit with our traditional allies in Europe, our friends in the Arab world and Asia, the U.N. and NATO, and Iraqi political leaders. He should tell them that we need their help. He should acknowledge that success in Iraq requires centrist Iraqis to step up, world powers to chip in, and Middle East countries to take a chance on representative government in Iraq. Then the President should ask each of them what they need from us in order to participate. And he should work with them to forge a common plan for Iraq that they can support. Mr. Chairman, let me conclude with something I talked about in a speech last week. I come from Delaware. I have been to Dover many times. The men and women there who receive our soldiers and their families on that last long journey home know what this is about. When those planes fly over Delaware and land in the middle of the night, we are reminded that this is not about politics, about whether we believe with every fiber of our being that we are fundamentally right or that someone else is dangerously wrong. This is not about assigning blame or about partisanship. This is about that last journey home to Dover Air Force Base. It's about those brave Americans who are doing everything in their power to get it right. We owe them no less than to get it right ourselves. The Chairman. Thank you very much, Senator Biden. We call now upon our witnesses. I will ask you to testify in the order in which I first introduced you. This would mean, first of all, Secretary Schlesinger. Welcome to the committee. STATEMENT OF HON. JAMES R. SCHLESINGER, SENIOR ADVISOR, LEHMAN BROTHERS Dr. Schlesinger. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman, members of the committee, I thank the committee for its invitation to discuss the continuously unfolding situation in Iraq and the actions required to achieve a successful transition. I shall touch on some of the themes, Mr. Chairman, Senator Biden, that you have touched upon. Since I am dealing with the successful transition and what is required, I shall pass over the many notable achievements, including acceptance of the Transitional Administrative Law, the restoration of power production, the rehabilitation of schools, the renovation of hospitals, and the like, in order to focus on such additional requirements. Before I proceed further, I need to underscore why it is that the United States is so deeply engaged in the Middle East and what is at stake in Iraq, for I fear there is some public uncertainty regarding these issues. Mr. Chairman, you mentioned the need to communicate with the American people. For that purpose, I recommend a re-reading of Osama bin Laden's declaration of war against the Americans issued in 1998. In that declaration, bin Laden states, ``The Defense Secretary of the crusading Americans has said that the explosions at Riyadh and al Khobar had taught him one lesson, that is not to withdraw when attacked by cowardly terrorists.'' Need I point out that in 1998, the Defense Secretary in question was not Donald Rumsfeld, but, rather, your old colleague, Bill Cohen. Bin Laden continues, ``We say to the Defense Secretary that his talk could induce a grieving mother to laughter, and it shows the fears that have enveloped you all. Where was this courage of yours when the explosion in Beirut took place in 1983? You were transformed into scattered bits and pieces. Two- hundred-and-forty-one soldiers were killed, most of them marines. When tens of your soldiers were killed in minor battles and one American pilot was dragged in the streets of Mogadishu, you left the area in disappointment, humiliation, and defeat, carrying your dead with you. Clinton appeared in front of the whole world, threatening and promising revenge, but these threats were merely a preparation for withdrawal. You had been disgraced by Allah, and you withdrew. The extent of your impotence and weakness became very clear.'' As bin Laden had earlier explained in the declaration, ``Efforts should be concentrated on destroying, fighting, and killing the American enemy until, by the grace of Allah, it is completely defeated.'' The task is stated quite simply. Killing Americans and other infidels. In June 2002, bin Laden's spokesman, Suleiman Abu Gheith, placed this statement on the al-Qaeda Web site, ``We have the right to kill four million Americans--two million of them children--and to exile twice as many, and wound and cripple hundreds of thousands.'' They may be fanatics, but they are deadly serious and thoroughly persistent. We must anticipate, therefore, a conflict that will continue for many years. Osama himself has opined that, ``When the people see a strong horse and a weak horse, they naturally gravitate toward the strong horse.'' Consequently, this nation must conclusively demonstrate that we are not the weak horse. Withdrawal from--before we have successfully stabilized Iraq is, therefore, not an option. It would be dramatically more visible throughout the Middle East and elsewhere than were those earlier retreats cited by Osama. I recognize that inevitably debate will continue regarding at least the timing of our move into Iraq. Nonetheless, we must not allow the political contentions of an election year to create any impression that we are anything but united in our determination to persevere and to prevail in Iraq. Success is the only acceptable course of action. How, then, are we to be successful in sustaining order and stability in Iraq? Only by embracing certain fundamental realities. First and foremost, establishing reasonable security is the prerequisite for achieving the goals of political stability. In principle, we have come to accept that reality; but, in practice, we have been too slow, effectively, to act upon it. Second, neither the American nor the Coalition forces can, by themselves, impose security on Iraq. Iraqis themselves must provide indispensable support. Only Iraqis can gather the intelligence to identify the regime remnants and the foreign terrorists who must be largely neutralized before adequate security can be ensured. Moreover, it will be essential for Iraq's security forces to be the principal element in rooting out terrorists and destroying their cells, with the Coalition military increasingly in a supporting role. ``We will stay the course'' may be a necessary guideline or an exhortation, but it is not a strategy. We will stay the course until we have an Iraqi force capable of providing reasonable security for the people of Iraq is a strategy. But that implies a viable plan to create such a force. It also implies that we should not expect the level of security in, say, Denmark or Japan. Regrettably, we have allowed almost a year to pass without creating an effective Iraqi security force. While we have recruited several hundred-thousand Iraqis into the security force, those forces have tended to melt away in times of difficulty. It may be that this behavior reflects a problem of morale, though that was not the judgment of those who had observed at least the CDC as it was being organized. Possibly, it reflects a deep unwillingness to use force on recalcitrant fellow Iraqis. But the most obvious answer is our own failure properly to train and properly to equip these security forces. On the equipping issue, all too many months have gone by without appropriately vetted forces being appropriately equipped with weapons, protective gear, and communications. That is a reflection, in part, of our own cumbersome budgetary and procurement procedures, which have imposed a high long-run cost on our operations. On the question of training, we have not allowed sufficient time for the training of individuals and the organizing of units with a high degree of cohesion; nor, by the way, have we had, to this point, an Iraqi chain of command, because Iraqis like to be ordered into battle by Iraqis rather than Americans. The task of training Iraqi security forces should be a principal obligation of American and Coalition forces in country. Other nations, such as India, even if they have not contributed military forces, may be prepared to participate in training these security forces. Second, we must focus more effectively on economic problems. There is a correlation between the high prevailing unemployment in Iraq and the restlessness and low morale spreading among the populace. Admittedly, initial expectations regarding an immediate magical boost in living conditions were unrealistic. Yet months have gone by without the improvement in living conditions that might realistically have been expected. The $18.4 billion that the Congress appropriated for reconstruction should have already begun to alleviate the problem--improving living conditions and expanding employment. It is a shame that so little of that $18.4 billion has been obligated to this point, and even significantly less has been spent. We must get that money flowing. Delay makes the problem worse. Yet, once again, it is our procurement procedures that have imposed these costs upon us. We cannot afford normal peacetime procurement procedures, with 60 days to submit responses to requests for proposals, and another 60 days to assess them, et cetera. Congress can act quickly. It should assess whether existing requirements result in a penny-wise/pound-foolish outcome, and help ease self-defeating restraints. Now let me turn to the political transition, while bearing in mind that effectively dealing with the security and economic conditions will necessarily remain the foundation for a successful political transition. As this committee well knows, since November of last year we have committed to transferring of sovereignty to the Iraqis after 30 June. The President has firmly reiterated that he intends to stick to that date. The administration has indicated that it is inclined to accept Ambassador Brahimi's proposals for the new Iraqi regime. Both Chairman Lugar and Senator Biden have noted that we would pay a high cost if we fail to abide by that date. That does not mean, by the way, that we cannot wait an extra 10 days or 2 weeks, but we cannot wait an extra 10 weeks or 2 months. While nothing is ever set in concrete, especially if the conditions within the country were to deteriorate substantially, I would expect that the date for transferring sovereignty to the Iraqis will be met. At that point, the Iraqis themselves will be making decisions regarding the civil order. Yet, once again, time's a-wastin'. There are only some 10 weeks left before the transfer is to be made. The new American ambassador was announced just yesterday, John Negroponte. I think John Negroponte is a superb choice. I have known him for the last 30 years. But, still, the embassy team reportedly amounting to 4,000 people, has obviously not yet solidified. The overall team has not had a chance to work with each other, to learn their respective roles, in effect to put on ``training wheels'' for the tasks ahead. The less time available will certainly detract from a smooth takeover from the CPA by the new team. I do not wish to overstate this point. One must recall that the critical issue of security will remain largely in American hands and under the control of a selected four-star general. Under U.N. Security Council Resolution 1511, Iraqi armed forces will be a principal partner in the multinational force operating in Iraq under unified command, in accordance with the Transitional Administrative Law. Thus, even if the transfer of sovereignty on several issues does not proceed perfectly smoothly, in the crucial area of security, which remains the largest challenge in Iraq, there will be less change. Contrary to a widespread public impression, which I hope that you gentlemen and Ms. Boxer will help counter, the transfer of authority on June 30 does not mean that the American role is ending, or that we are somehow washing our hands of Iraq. This last must effectively be conveyed to the Iraqi public at large. As we look beyond June 30, we should expect a closer collaborative relationship between State and Defense than has been our experience to this point. The relationship between the civilians and the CPA, mostly buttoned down in the Green Zone, and the military, who have been out in the field interacting with the Iraqis, has been something less than ideal. After all, it is the CPA that has maintained tight control over the resources, but it is the division commanders that have been in close contact with the Iraqis and know what the local needs are, and have too frequently been obliged to fund local activities out of their quite-limited discretionary funds. The civil-military relationship worked out far better in Vietnam, after General Abrams took command in 1968. He and Ambassador Bunker worked intimately in deciding what the needs were for the pacification program, and how to allocate resources. We should seek to achieve that degree of collaborative behavior once the new embassy team comes into play this summer. One final, but crucial, point. To date, our efforts to communicate with the Iraqis have been inadequate. We have failed to convey to the Iraqis what our intentions are, or have conveyed them belatedly. Consequently, all too many excellent and well-intentioned actions on our part have not gotten through to the Iraqi public. It is almost as important that such plans or such actions be understood as that they be executed. The American-sponsored television station has not been well designed to attract an audience, and has, thus, been peripheral for Iraqi listeners. The upshot has been that al-Jazeera and al Arabiya have filled the void. It must be remembered that al-Jazeera's general manager was on Saddam's payroll. Al-Jazeera seems to have been regularly tipped off regarding any clashes in country, so that the television cameras would be present, and, indeed, may have staged such events. It must be recognized that with unemployment as high as it is, it is easy to buy a demonstration. Indeed, simple payment in cash has been a principal motive for many of those engaged in attacking either Americans or Iraqis. Mr. Chairman, the decision to go into Iraq was a fateful one, not only for Iraqis, but for the larger Middle East and for the credibility, and you've mentioned, of American foreign policy. We must see it through. Coalition forces, as well as Iraqi forces and government officials, are now under assault-- some calculated and deliberate, but some emotional and mindless. It is time for us to remind Iraqis, ``If you want a decent life, you must not support the elements that are destroying your country and may actually be seeking a civil war.'' We must persuade Iraqis to foresee the consequences of frustrating Coalition efforts, in their behalf. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. After Sandy is through, I shall be happy to respond to any questions of you or the members of the committee. [The prepared statement of Dr. Schlesinger follows:] Prepared Statement of Hon. James R. Schlesinger Mr. Chairman, Members of the Committee: I thank the Committee for its invitation to discuss the continuously unfolding situation in Iraq--and the actions required to achieve a successful transition.

Thank you, Mr. Chairman, I shall be happy to respond to any questions that you or the Members of the Committee may have. The Chairman. Thank you very much, Secretary Schlesinger. We appreciate that testimony. Mr. Berger, would you proceed. STATEMENT OF HON. SAMUEL R. BERGER, CHAIRMAN, STONEBRIDGE INTERNATIONAL, LLC Mr. Berger. Chairman Lugar, Senator Biden, members of the committee, thank you for inviting me to join Secretary Schlesinger and be a part of these important hearings at this very important time. It was one year ago that Saddam Hussein's statue crashed to the ground in Baghdad; 4 months ago that he was captured. Yet since the start of this month, 105 U.S. troops and over a thousand Iraqis have been killed. Civilians from a number of countries have been taken hostage. Suicide attacks, roadside ambushes, and heavy fighting have dominated the news. Even before what President Bush called these ``tough weeks,'' Coalition troops were facing down dozens of attacks each day. That is not to say that many good people in Iraq, American and Iraqi, are not accomplishing good things in many parts of the country. Under the most trying circumstances, our troops have shown truly inspiring skill and courage. The Coalition Provisional Authority has worked tirelessly to move reconstruction forward. But the Iraqi people have high hopes and expectations for their future, and we should have nothing less. But we'll never be able to meet those high hopes if we don't get security and governance right, and I think it's clear that pressures in Iraq are reaching, now, the boiling point. Mr. Chairman, the outcome of this enterprise will help define our world for a generation. We could have a stable, secure, peaceful, and pluralistic Iraq, which will have a positive impact on the entire region; or we could have an Iraq that is slipping into chaos, civil war, or radicalism, redefining not only Iraq, but the region and our relationship with it. Imagine if Iraq becomes a failed terrorist state. Imagine a fundamentalist nation next door to Iran. Imagine a country that fragments, drawing in its neighbors. Imagine the shadow such an Iraq would cast on our security. We cannot permit this to happen. The President passionately and properly declared in his press conference last week that ``we cannot cut and run.'' But, honestly, Mr. Chairman, I don't hear many people saying we should. The American people don't want to ``cut and run;'' they want to know how we get from here to there. And the fact is, many of the choices that brought us to here do not fully inspire confidence. We ignored the cautions of people like General Eric Shinseki, who said the peace would be harder than the war. If we had put the same number of troops in Iraq per capita as we did at the outset in Kosovo--6 to 1 instead of 20 to 1--we would have 500,000 troops there today; or, compared to Bosnia, 350,000 troops. Instead, we left ourselves ill-equipped to stem looting, establish order, even protect our own troops. Meanwhile, the notion that we could create and train an effective Iraqi army or police in a matter of months never made sense to me. At the core, we put a higher value on maintaining control than on sharing risk. We and the British declared ourselves occupying powers. As a result, we are bearing close to 90 percent of the costs and the risks. As Secretary Schlesinger pointed out, we've fallen way behind on our own schedule for reconstruction. Of the $18.4 billion supplemental for aid to Iraq, only $2.1 billion has been obligated, and 20 percent of that now will go to security. As you've said, Mr. Chairman, many Iraqis don't understand how the most powerful nation in the world could defeat their armed forces in 3 weeks and still have trouble getting the lights on. And despite the uncertain situation on the ground, we set an arbitrary date for transferring sovereignty before we knew to whom, and before we had broad agreement on a formula for multi-ethnic rule. Mr. Chairman, what I find most disconcerting is the administration's jarring certainty about June 30, and this jarring uncertainty about July 1. We have been told where we want to go--Iraqi sovereignty, American-led security, and, eventually, Iraqi elections. We haven't been told how we plan to get there. The American people need to know we have a confident and workable plan. There is too much at stake in Iraq to lose the American people. As I see it, we have three basic options: apply more force, hunker down, or make a serious effort to internationalize this enterprise. First, applying more force. This may be necessary in some cases. If our military commanders say they need more troops, they will have them, they should have them. But we also must recognize the risks of military solutions in the absence of a clear political strategy. Attempting to crush the opposition can create its own dangerous backlash. Our military strategy will be no better than our political strategy; and our political strategy, while allaying the concerns of the Sunnis and the Kurds, must empower legitimate and respected Shia moderates. If we lose the Shia population's support, then we will lose Iraq. Our second option is to hunker down--to replace the CPA sign with one that says ``U.S. Embassy,'' turn sovereignty over to as-yet undetermined group of Iraqis, and try to stay out of harm's way. I continue to fear the temptation of this option, Mr. Chairman, it is a prescription for chaos. It is unrealistic to think a new Iraqi leadership will be equipped to govern on July 1, much less prepared to send troops to this or the next Fallujah. As Lieutenant General Sanchez has said, ``We know that it's going to take us a while to stand up reliable forces that can accept responsibility.'' A third option is one that many of us have been advocating all along. It would have been easier to implement a year ago, 6 months ago, last month. That is a genuine, non-grudging effort to internationalize the enterprise in Iraq, both military and civilian. I welcome the fact the administration is finally coming to that view, inch by inch--painful inch by inch. By last week's press conference, the President was deferring critical decisions on Iraqi's future government to U.N. representative Lakhdar Brahimi. Mr. Brahimi has proposed a caretaker government and a consultative assembly. These make sense to me. But, as Senator Biden has noted, there's a gap in what Mr. Brahimi is suggesting. On the civilian side, there will be some new Iraqi authority, hopefully broad-based and more widely supported than the current one we selected. There will be a large U.S. Embassy presence. But in the absence of some sort of an international high commissioner supported by a consortium of key countries-- not only the United States, but also European and Arab and Asian--this newly formed Iraqi government will not have the capacity to act strongly, and they will be reluctant to cooperate too openly with our behemoth American Embassy, even in the hands of someone as capable as Ambassador Negroponte. There needs to be an international mechanism that reinforces the exercise of Iraqi executive authority and, quite honestly, facilitates the ability of the United States to function more effectively with the new Iraqi leadership. We also need a troop presence in Iraq that is genuinely international. Some have concluded that it's too late to obtain help from the allies. I disagree. Like us, our partners in Europe and the Arab world will bear the full brunt of an Iraq in turmoil. The fact that they did not participate in the invasion will provide them, in the end, no comfort. Senator Biden, I support your proposal that President Bush call for an immediate summit with our European and Arab and Asian friends, representatives of the U.N. and NATO. Say, we need your help, and ask what their meaningful engagement would take. So far, we've said, in effect, we welcome your troops and your money, but largely on our terms. We've got to be prepared to give up our hammerlock on decisionmaking in exchange for genuine burden-sharing. To conclude, Mr. Chairman, let me say that we will not meet any of our goals in Iraq if we lose the public at home. Today, the question on the public mind is, what is our strategy for success in Iraq, and is it achievable? Too often today, it seems to be improvised. And while, yes, we are willing to stay the course if we know what that course is. My fear, to borrow Yogi Berra's famous words, is, ``If we don't know where we're going, we will wind up somewhere else.'' More troops and more money is not a strategy. Steadfastness is an imperative, but it is not a strategy. Americans need to hear a plan to stem the insurgency, disarm the militia, hasten reconstruction, and, most important, enable Iraqis themselves to forge consensus on the future of their country. Sitting here today, Mr. Chairman, I still believe we can do this. I still believe the Iraqi people can do it. But success requires international support, and we don't have a moment to waste. Thank you. [The prepared statement of Mr. Berger follows:] Prepared Statement of Hon. Samuel R. Berger Chairman Lugar, Senator Biden, Members of the Committee: Thank you for inviting me to be a part of these important hearings, at this very important time. Much is riding on the next few months--for Iraq, for America and for the world. It was one year ago that Saddam Hussein's statue crashed to the ground in Baghdad; four months ago that he was captured hiding in a hole. Yet, since the start of this month, 105 U.S. troops and over 1,000 Iraqis have been killed. Civilians from the United States, Japan, China, the Czech Republic, Russia, Ukraine and more have been taken hostage. Suicide attacks, roadside ambushes and heavy fighting have dominated the news. Even before what President Bush called these ``tough weeks,'' coalition troops were facing down dozens of attacks each day. That is not to say that many good people in Iraq--American and Iraqi--are not accomplishing good things in many parts of the country. Under the most trying circumstances, our troops have shown truly inspiring skill and courage. The Coalition Provisional Authority has worked tirelessly to move reconstruction forward. The Iraqi people have shown impressive resilience. They have high hopes and expectations for their future. We should have nothing less. But we'll never be able to meet those high hopes if we don't get security and governance right. And I think it's clear that pressures in Iraq have reached the boiling point. Mr. Chairman, the outcome of the enterprise in Iraq will help define our world for a generation. We could have a stable, secure, peaceful and pluralistic Iraq, which will have a beneficial impact on the entire region. Or we could have an Iraq that is slipping into chaos, civil war or radicalism, redefining not only Iraq but the region and our relationship with it. Imagine if Iraq becomes a failed, terror state. Imagine a fundamentalist nation next door to Iran. Imagine a country that fragments, drawing in its neighbors. Imagine the shadow such an Iraq would cast on our security. We cannot permit that to happen. The president passionately and properly declared in his press conference last week that we can't ``cut and run.'' But honestly, I don't hear many people saying we should. The American people don't want to ``cut and run.'' They want to know how we get from here to there. And the fact is, many of the choices that brought us to ``here'' do not fully inspire confidence. We ignored the cautions of people like General Eric Shinseki, who said the peace would be harder than the war. If we had put the same number of troops in Iraq per capita as we did at the outset in Kosovo-- 6 to 1 instead of 20 to 1--we would have 500,000 troops there today. Instead, we left ourselves ill-equipped to stem looting, establish order, even protect our own troops. Meanwhile, the notion that we could create and train an effective Iraqi army or police in a matter of months never made sense. At the core, we put a higher value on maintaining control than on sharing risk. We and the British declared ourselves occupying powers. As a result, we are bearing close to 90% of the costs and risks. We've fallen way behind on our own schedule for reconstruction. Of the $18.4 billion supplemental for aid to Iraq, only $2.1 billion has been obligated. As you've said, Mr. Chairman, many Iraqis don't understand ``how the most powerful nation in the world could defeat their armed forces in three weeks and still have trouble getting the lights on.'' And despite the uncertain situation on the ground, we set an arbitrary date for transferring sovereignty--before we knew to whom, and before we had broad agreement on a formula for multiethnic rule. I find disconcerting the administration's jarring certainty about June 30 and its jarring uncertainty about July 1. We have been told ``where'' we want to go--Iraqi sovereignty, American-led security and eventually Iraqi elections. We haven't been told ``how to get there.'' The American people need to know we have a confident and workable plan. There is too much at stake in Iraq, Mr. Chairman, to lose the American people. As I see it, we have three basic options: Apply more force, hunker down or make a serious effort to internationalize the enterprise. First, applying more force. This may be necessary in some cases. If our military commanders say they need more troops, then they should have them. But we also must recognize the risks of military solutions in the absence of a clear political strategy. Attempting to crush the opposition can create its own dangerous backlash. We need to be careful as we deal with the threat Moqtada al-Sadr poses that we do not turn him into a hero . . . or transform a fringe militia into a popular political movement. Our military strategy will be no better than our political strategy, and our political strategy, while allaying the concerns of the Sunnis and the Kurds, must empower legitimate and respected Shia moderates. If we lose the Shia population's support, then we will lose Iraq. Our second option is to ``hunker down''--to replace the CPA sign with one that says ``U.S. Embassy,'' turn sovereignty over to an as-yet undetermined group of Iraqis, and try to stay out of harm's way. Mr. Chairman, this option is a prescription for chaos. It is unrealistic to think a new Iraqi leadership will be equipped to govern on July 1, much less prepared to send troops to Fallujah or to quell a violent uprising. We've already seen Iraqi divisions refusing to fight, and Iraqi soldiers defecting to the Mahdi Army. As Lt. Gen. Sanchez has said, ``We know that it's going to take us a while to stand up reliable forces that can accept responsibility.'' Our third option is one that many of us have advocated all along. It would have been easier to implement a year ago . . . six months ago . . . last month. That is a genuine, non-grudging effort to internationalize the enterprise in Iraq, both military and civilian. I welcome the fact that the administration is coming around, belatedly, to that view. By last week's press conference, the president was deferring critical decisions on Iraq's future government to UN representative Lakhdar Brahimi. Mr. Brahimi has proposed a caretaker government and a consultative assembly. These make sense. But there is a gap, in my judgment, in what Mr. Brahimi is suggesting. On the civilian side there will be some new Iraqi authority--hopefully broad-based and more widely supported than the current one we selected. There will be a large U.S. Embassy presence. But in the absence of an international High Commissioner of some sort, supported by a consortium of key countries including not only the United States but also European and Arab, the newly formed Iraqi government will not have the capacity to act strongly . . . and they will be reluctant to cooperate too openly with our behemoth American Embassy, even in the hands of someone as capable as Ambassador Negroponte. There needs to be an international mechanism that reinforces the exercise of Iraqi executive authority and, quite honestly, enables the United States to function more effectively with that Iraqi leadership. We also need a troop presence in Iraq that is genuinely international. Some argue it's too late to obtain help from the allies. I disagree. Like us, our partners in Europe and the Arab world will bear the full brunt of an Iraq that fails--an Iraq in turmoil. The fact that they did not participate in the invasion will provide them, in the end, no comfort. Senator Biden, I agree with your conviction that President Bush should call for an immediate summit with our European and Arab friends, representatives of the UN and NATO . . . say we need their help . . . and ask them what their meaningful engagement would take. So far, we've said we'd welcome their troops and their money--but largely on our terms. We've got to be prepared to give up our hammerlock on decision- making in exchange for genuine burden-sharing. The future of Iraq cannot be divorced from the future of the region as a whole. It is not sufficient to trumpet that a mission is to bring freedom and democracy to the Middle East. We need to align ourselves with the indigenous forces of reform in the region--instead of trying to impose our own. We need to help Arab partners build opportunity societies. We need to redouble our efforts with Israelis and Palestinians. We need to start putting as much energy into this region as we've taken out--but energy of the diplomatic, economic, political and intellectual variety. To conclude, Mr. Chairman, let me say again that we will not meet any of our goals in Iraq if we lose the public at home. Today the question on the public mind is: What is our strategy for success in Iraq, and is it achievable? Our current policy seems to involve a significant element of improvisation. And while yes, we are willing to stay the course if we know what that course is, my fear, to borrow Yogi Berra's words, is that if we don't know where we're going, we will end up somewhere else. More troops and more money is not a strategy. Steadfastness is an imperative--but it is not a strategy. Americans need to hear a plan to stem the insurgency, disarm the militias, hasten reconstruction, and, most important, enable Iraqis themselves to forge consensus on the future of their country. Sitting here today, I still believe we can do that. I still believe the Iraqi people can do it. But success requires international support . . . and we don't have a moment to waste. Thank you. The Chairman. Thank you very much, Mr. Berger. Given the number of members here, and the need for all members to participate, let me suggest that we'll attempt a 7- minute question period, and then perhaps have a second round. We have a distinguished panel to follow. We want to take cognizance of that, as well as the time constraints of members. Let me begin the questioning. Mr. Berger, you mentioned several things in your testimony: a European summit on Iraq, internationalizing the foreign presence and a need to consider deploying troops in geater numbers to meet the needs of our commanders. You also said that you perceive a gap between our large embassy establishment and the new Iraqi government, that it's important to fill with some sort of international mechanism that may facilitate the work of the U.S. Ambassador. Now, those of us who attended the Munich Security Conference this year noted that although Europeans might have 2\\1/2\\ million men and women under arms, barely 65,000, under the best circumstances, were called expeditionary forces--that is, able to go anywhere. Of that number, many countries prefer to deploy only a third at a time. That is they choose to keep a third in the field, a third back for rehabilitation, and a third for training. This further cuts down the available numbers considerably. The requirements of NATO, and of Lord Robertson in Afghanistan have absorbed a good number of those troops. This begs the question, who is there left to send? In other words, in the event Europeans come to a conclusion that they would like to play a role comparable to the United States, or at least along side us, in this situation, what can they provide? Their participation might enhance the legitimacy and international flavor of the effort. Mr. Berger. Well I have no illusion, Mr. Chairman, that they are going to be able to provide large numbers, but there's the label and there's the contents; and I think the label here is as important as the contents. The label is ``American occupation.'' And even when we transfer to a new Iraqi government, the label will be ``Iraqi Government, American Embassy,'' and on the security side, will be ``Coalition,'' read ``American.'' I don't believe that it is too late for that label to be NATO--``American-led, NATO-backed, U.N.-blessed force.'' And even if it means, as Senator Biden was suggesting earlier, that the numbers are not overwhelming, I think the perception that Iraqi radicals are fighting the international community, not fighting the American occupation, will, in and of itself, have some dissuasive effect. The Chairman. As you pointed out, the President, in his press conference, indicated the importance of Mr. Brahimi's plan, and the fact that we are relying upon it. Let me just ask either one of you for a comment about how this is likely to work in the nitty-gritty of Iraqi politics, including the selection of the personnel. The Council on Foreign Relations, in an updated memo of April 16, 2004, has provided some of the best sheets of paper I've seen on speculation on how the Brahimi plan might work. It comes down to a president, two vice presidents, a prime minister, and an advisory council that would be smaller than the Loya Jirga in Afghanistan, and strictly advisory, but, nevertheless, broadly representative. The obvious question is, who will occupy the chairs, and who selects the committee? The idea, at least as the Council suggests, is that the Iraqis would provide suggestions to Brahimi and the United Nations Council. The United States and Great Britain and others would have at least some advisory capacity, as might some other countries that are involved in the Coalition. In any event, ultimately, the U.N. group, Mr. Brahimi, or his designee, would determine the president of the country, as well as the two vice presidents. The question then is, how are the Sunnis, the Shi'ites, and the Kurds represented, and do they accept this division? Furthermore, do all the people accept the thoughts of the Council? Given the fact that the current Governing Council is to be dismissed, some of these people may be unhappy over that, and may wish to be reappointed. This is not certain. At the end of the day, the President has indicated that we're waiting for Mr. Brahimi. Brahimi is going to consult some more, because he's been inhibited by a lack of security in going around the country. He's had to deal in Baghdad. He is going to other countries. Now he'll come back to the United Nations. But time is passing, and, ultimately, as you pointed out, this is going to be a pretty fledgling group of folks. Just to play the devil's advocate, what if Iraqis decide they don't like these people? What if the basic parties--the Shi'ites, the Kurds, and the Sunnis--decide that they are not adequately represented? For example, the Ayatollah al-Sistani had reservations with regard to the Transitional Administrative Law that the Governing Council passed. They may or may not have all been fulfilled at this point. As I understand it, Brahimi has talked to al-Sistani's son--not al-Sistani, at this point. But a Sunni of comparable stature to al-Sistani has yet to be found, as I understand it, to give some blessing to this proposal. What would you suggest as a fallback position in the event that we get close to the 30th and, as a matter of fact, these people appear to be unacceptable to each other or to the parties? What should the United States do at such a hypothetical juncture in history? Does anyone have a thought about that? Mr. Berger. One of the reasons why I think it's so important for us to stand up what we called the PIC in Bosnia, the international friends of Bosnia, so to speak--same thing in Kosovo--is that it may be--even if they are able to agree, Ayatollah al-Sistani has made it very clear that he expects the powers of this caretaker government to be rather limited until there's an election. He's read about majority rule, believes actually that the Shias should dominate the new government, wants to make sure that happens. So I think we're either going to have your situation, which is no consensus, or one step beyond that, which is a very weak government. And I think standing up a international enterprise, an international board of directors that--to use Senator Biden's word, an international group--could take the edge off the June 30 deadline, to some degree, because we would be relinquishing sovereignty. It would reside with some incipient Iraqi authority, but bolstered, reinforced, and strengthened by an international body that was present, that was not dominated by the United States and did not have an American high commissioner. The Chairman. Dr. Schlesinger, do you have a comment? Dr. Schlesinger. Well, my comment goes to the question of the various groups within Iraq. Happily to this point, Ayatollah al-Sistani has demonstrated a high degree of responsibility. He has not necessarily agreed with everything that the Americans proposed. But he has been responsible. And that is true for a bulk of the Shi'ites. Sandy mentioned earlier the need to make sure that the moderate Shia continue with the hopes for a future Iraq. I think they are there. Al- Sadr and his units have not been successful. He continues to be a marginal element. And his units, which are made up of the dispossessed from Baghdad, have looted in al Kut, in Kufa, and in Najaf, and that has not increased their popularity. So I think that the Shia will continue to see their stake in seeing a successful transition. The Kurds are reasonably protected, Mr. Chairman--or feel themselves to be reasonably protected. The long-run problem, of course, is the Sunni, who now feel politically dispossessed with the departure of Saddam. That is part of the reason that we have not been able to discover a senior Sunni. Many of the senior Sunnis were part of the Ba'athist regime, and there were few that were outside of it. We hope that sooner or later, we will find an Adenauer in the Sunni community, but, as yet, he has not appeared. The Chairman. Thank you. Senator Biden. Senator Biden. Thank you both very much. Let me say, Secretary Schlesinger, you coauthored two very important reports--one, ``Iraq: The Day After,'' March 2003, and then one entitled, ``Iraq: One Year After,'' March 2004-- along with Ambassador Thomas Pickering. And the project consultant was Eric P. Schwartz. I'd like to read a portion of the last page of the 2004 report. It says, ``The task force believes that sustaining this public consensus is essential, especially as the political will of the United States will continue to be tested in months and years to come in Iraq. These tests, which would include more high-profile attacks on U.S. troops, could come at a time of heightened political debate in the United States as we enter the final phase of the 2004 campaign. Iraq will unavoidably be the subject of debate during the U.S. Presidential campaign. This debate will almost certainly encompass the original decision to go to war, as well as the postwar political transition and reconstruction efforts. Nonetheless, the task- force members, who represent broadly diverse political perspectives, are united in their position the United States has a critical interest in a stable Iraq, whose leadership represents the will of its people. Civil conflict in Iraq, the alternative to peaceful political competition, would risk intervention by, and competing for, influence among Iraqis' neighbors,'' et cetera. Last paragraph, ``Although U.S. engagement cannot guarantee success, a diminished U.S. commitment to Iraq during the transfer of sovereignty would increase the likelihood of political failure. In fact, in the months ahead U.S. Government will have to sharpen its approach and increase its commitment of resources in several critical areas. As one analyst has written, the U.S. Government must recognize that the future of Iraq and, through it, the future of the entire Middle East is very much in our hands. If the United States is unwilling to shoulder the burden of leading the reconstruction economically, politically, and militarily for years to come, it will fail.'' Preceding that conclusion, you call for, as you did in your first report in March 2003, the need for international involvement, the need for training of Iraqi forces that will take a lot longer, and you point out that the failure to provide funding in the 2005 budget--that is the budget we're voting on this year--and the administration's assertion that we don't know what we'll need, but we'll know it when we see it-- we'll provide a supplemental--you point out on page 12 of the report that this has a very negative consequence. You said, ``At the same time, the absence of any clear projection of anticipated medium-term military or economic commitments creates uncertainty and enables officials to defer the process of building public consensus in support of continue U.S. engagement.'' Could you elaborate very briefly on what you mean by that? It's not just that--the money. But you're arguing that the failure to say what we'll need for fiscal year 2005 creates a sense of uncertainty. What's the consequence of that uncertainty? Dr. Schlesinger. The report, which was a year ago, points, I think, primarily to the issue that unless we clearly indicate to the American people how substantial a commitment this is and how large the financial costs are likely to be, and, although we have uncertainties about the troop levels, that those will continue to be very large, that unless we convey this to the American people, we could lose the American public, as we have previously; and, therefore, clarity with regard to the degree of commitment, the costs, and so forth, would be helpful, and we urge the President to make that clear. Senator Biden. You also make that point in this year's report, which was published March 4, just this last month, 2004. I wanted you to reiterate that point because I think, again, we take for granted that the American people are automatically, by the exhortation of the President, going to be there, without either an explanation of what the cost will be to stay or what the price of leaving would be. The President's finally laid out the price of leaving. I noticed, in his press conference, he did not use that same trite expression, if we don't--I'm paraphrasing--if we don't fight 'em in Baghdad, we'll have to fight 'em in Boston, as the rationale for being there. He laid out a much more coherent and straightforward reason why we had to succeed. Both of you have referenced the fact that it is possible that we would be able to get assistance from other countries in training Iraqis. My recollection--and it was pointed out to me in my meeting with European leaders several months ago-- immediately after Saddam's statue came down in that square, that rotary that we all saw and cheered--immediately after that occurred, the French and the Germans stepped forward and said, ``We are ready to participate, in a major way, and we are prepared to train Iraqi forces, but we need a U.N. resolution. Sanction this.'' And, as usual, Mr. Berger, you succinctly say things that I mean to say and can't say as well. You said we need ``an American-led, NATO-backed, and U.N.-blessed''--not U.N.-run; U.N.-blessed. Is there any reasons why the administration, in either of your views, would not be able to get a U.N.-blessed--a U.N.- blessed--resolution that would allow--whether it's France and Germany, still, or India and others, who are capable of the training--to get them in and do the training? Mr. Berger. I think if we demonstrated clearly the political will to make this an international enterprise, which I don't really think we've done to this--notwithstanding saying, well, we'll do what Brahimi says--I've not seen this administration say to our allies, what will it take to get you guys here? How can I help your politics? Because I understand your politics makes this very, very difficult. That's why your idea of going to Europe as a gesture, I think, makes a great deal of sense. I talk to Europeans all the time, European officials, and if we put this question right--we've made it very easy for them to say no--but if we basically say, listen, we need your help, we cannot fail, you're not going to be immune from the consequences of failure, what do you need to--in the way of U.N. support or otherwise, to make this possible, I believe, to this day, that our European allies and the Arab neighbors would participate in some fashion. Senator Biden. Jim, what do you think would happen if we made a genuine effort? Dr. Schlesinger. Well, I think that pursuit of international support is desirable, particularly on the training side. I believe that, at one point, the Indians, India, suggested that they would be prepared to train Iraqi forces. Now, India is, of course, the largest Muslim country in the world, 100-million-plus Muslims, and they have had great experience in the training of Muslims. And, therefore, that is something that, at least at this point, should be reexamined. Senator Biden. Let me close, Mr. Chairman, by saying that many of you saw Monday's New York Times. On the front page, it says, ``Security Companies Shadow Soldiers in Iraq.'' I imagine it came as a shock to a number of Americans to realize that we have a private army in Iraq. Larger than any other force beyond ours--larger than the Brits, larger than any other country; a 20,000 strong private army. And this private army is providing security. These are armies hired by contractors, funded by the $18 billion we're talking about, of which 15 percent was going to go to the Iraqi police; now it's estimated as much as 25 percent of the $18 billion will go to pay companies--I'm not criticizing, I'm just observing it--to pay companies to hire essentially the equivalent of the French Foreign Legion. We're paying, for example, former Navy SEALs somewhere between $500 and $1,500 a day, out of that money that we have appropriated, for a private army, which is needed for security, when we have young Navy SEALs who are actually employed by the Federal Government making that much a month, and National Guard kids over there, and people who are trained and competent and capable, who are making 30 to 50 percent less than they'd be making at home, and still have the same mortgage payment, still have the same tuition payment, still have the same car payment. And this is a prescription for disaster here if we don't get some additional help. I would offer this as evidence that even the administration acknowledges we need more force. This is the force they're prepared to pay for, though--private security forces. And it's guarding, by the way, Bremer, guarding the consulate--I mean, this is amazing. We'd better get to the business of figuring out how we get more forces in there. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The Chairman. Thank you, Senator Biden. Senator Hagel. Senator Hagel. Mr. Chairman, thank you. Gentlemen, thank you for your testimony. It has been noted this morning that you each have contributed so many years to this country, its security interests as well as other interests, and we are grateful for your continuation of wise counsel, thank you. I actually would like to pick up on where Senator Biden left off, on the troop issue. We have before us, as has been noted, a former National Security Advisor, a former Secretary of Defense, CIA Director. And here is my question, because I think you two are eminently qualified to answer this question. To continue with what Senator Biden has noted that was included in the New York Times article, and what I have heard this morning from each of you--and I think this is a fair assessment of where you believe our future force-structure needs are going to be--we're going to be in Afghanistan, we're going to be in Iraq, we are still in the Balkans, we're going to be in Korea. We're all over the globe with new commitments that we are taking on constantly. Now over 40 percent of our force structure in Iraq is represented by National Guard and Reserve units. We are going to face, as we already are, a retention/ recruitment issue with the National Guard, Reserves, active Army and--at least it's this Senator's assessment that our continued commitments over the next few years are probably not going to be any less, if we all believe what you've stated and I certainly know that you do believe it; I think everyone on this panel--that the threat of terrorism, proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and all that goes with that are going to require a tremendous amount of resources and intense leadership and focus. Now if that is the premise, and I assume you agree with, generally, what I have said, my question to you both is, where, then, do we continue to get those forces? How are we going to meet the obl"
