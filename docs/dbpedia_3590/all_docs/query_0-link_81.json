        "text": "The Kingdom of Iraq under British Administration, or Mandatory Iraq\n\nwas created in 1921, following the 1920 Iraqi Revolt against the proposed British Mandate of Mesopotamia, and enacted via the 1922 Anglo-Iraqi Treaty and a 1924 undertaking by the United Kingdom to the League of Nations to fulfil the role as Mandatory Power\n\nFaisal ibn Husayn, who had been proclaimed King of Syria by a Syrian National Congress in Damascus in March 1920, was ejected by the French in July of the same year. Faisal was then granted by the British the territory of Iraq, to rule it as a kingdom, with the British Royal Air Force (RAF) retaining certain military control, but de facto, the territory remained under British administration until 1932\n\nThe civil government of postwar Iraq was headed originally by the High Commissioner, Sir Percy Cox, and his deputy, Colonel Arnold Wilson. British reprisals after the murder of a British officer in Najaf failed to restore order. The most striking problem facing the British was the growing anger of the nationalists, who continued to fight against the imposition of British authority. British administration had yet to be established in Iraqi Kurdistan.\n\nThe Iraqi revolt of 1920 was a watershed event in contemporary Iraqi history. For the first time, Sunnis and Shias, tribes and cities, were brought together in a common effort. In the opinion of Hanna Batatu, author of a seminal work on Iraq, the building of a nation-state in Iraq depended upon two major factors: the integration of Shias and Sunnis into the new body politic and the successful resolution of the age-old conflicts between the tribes and the riverine cities and among the tribes themselves over the food-producing flatlands of the Tigris and the Euphrates. The 1920 rebellion brought these groups together, if only briefly; this constituted an important first step in the long and arduous process of forging a nation-state out of Iraq’s conflict-ridden social structure. The Assyrian Levies, a military force under British command, participated in the Kirkuk Massacre of 1924 of Kurds, Arabs, and Turkomen. (See Simele Massacres of 1933)\n\nCoronation of Faisal\n\nAt the Cairo Conference of March 1921, the British set the parameters for Iraqi political life that were to continue until the 1958 revolution; they chose a Hashemite, Faisal ibn Husayn, son of Sherif Hussein ibn Ali former Sharif of Mecca as Iraq’s first King; they established an Iraqi army (but kept Iraq Levies under direct British command); and they proposed a new treaty. To confirm Faisal as Iraq’s first monarch, a one-question plebiscite was carefully arranged that had a return of 96 percent in his favor. The British saw in Faisal a leader who possessed sufficient nationalist and Islamic credentials to have broad appeal, but who also was vulnerable enough to remain dependent on their support. Faisal traced his descent from the family of the Prophet Muhammad. His ancestors held political authority in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina since the 10th century. The British believed these credentials would satisfy traditional Arab standards of political legitimacy; moreover, the British thought Faisal would be accepted by the growing Iraqi nationalist movement because of his role in the 1916 Arab Revolt against the Turks, his achievements as a leader of the Iraq emancipation movement, and his general leadership qualities. Faisal was instated as the Monarch of Iraq after the Naquib of Baghdad was disqualified as being too old (80 yrs) and Sayid Talib (a prominent Iraqi from the province of Basra) was deported on trumped up charges by the British. The voting was far from a reflection of the true feelings of the Iraqi people. Nevertheless, Faisal was considered the most effective choice for the throne by the British government\n\nFaisal I bin Al-Hussein bin Ali Al-Hashemi\n\nKing of Iraq from 23 August 1921 until his death in 1933. A member of the Hashemite family, he was a leader of the Great Arab Revolt during the First World War, and ruled as the unrecognized King of the Arab Kingdom of Syria from March to July 1920 when he was expelled by the French.\n\nGhazi of Iraq\n\nwas King of Iraq from 1933 to 1939 having been briefly Crown Prince of the Kingdom of Syria in 1920. He was born in Mecca, the only son of Faisal I.He died in a car crash in 1939.\n\nGhazi’s vehicle after accident.\n\nDeath\n\nKing Ghazi died in April 1939 in an accident involving a sports car that he was driving.\n\nFaisal, Ghazi’s only son, succeeded him as King Faisal II. Because Faisal was underage, Prince Abdul Ilah served as regent until 1953.\n\nSecond Kingdom of Iraq\n\nAs for the second era – or the second Iraqi kingdom, it is represented in the post-departure phase of the British forces, which began with the formation of Nuri Al-Said Pasha for his ministry, who is known for his skill, his patriotism, his love for Iraq and his loyalty to the Hashemite royal family, determined to establish an alliance that includes the regent His Highness Prince Abdul Ilah Al-Hashemi and some centers of power of ministers and personalities representing different sects and races.\n\nIraq’s independence on the third of October 1932 Iraq gained its independence, and the country was transferred from a British mandate territory to the 57th country in the world, with full independence and powers in accordance with international law. Iraq remained 12 years of mandate submission from 1920 until independence on this day.\n\nFaisal II\n\nwas the last King of Iraq. He reigned from 4 April 1939 until July 1958, when he was killed during the 14 July Revolution. This regicide marked the end of the thirty-seven-year-old Hashemite monarchy in Iraq, which then became a republic.\n\nFaisal II\n\nThe only son of King Ghazi and Queen Aliya of Iraq, Faisal acceded to the throne at the age of three after his father was killed in a car crash. A regency was set up under his uncle Prince ‘Abd al-Ilah\n\nAbd al-Ilah of Hejaz,\n\n14 November 1913 – 14 July 1958) was a cousin and brother-in-law of King Ghazi of the Hashemite Kingdom of Iraq and was regent for his nephew King Faisal II, from 4 April 1939 to 23 May 1953, when Faisal came of age. Abd al-Ilah also held the title of Crown Prince of Iraq from 1943 to 1953.\n\nAbd al-Ilah was killed along with the rest of the Iraqi royal family in the 14 July Revolution in 1958 that ended the Hashemite monarchy in Iraq. His body was mutilated, dragged across the streets of Baghdad, and eventually burn\n\nNuri Pasha al-Said\n\nDecember 1888 – 15 July 1958) was an Iraqi politician during the Mandatory Iraq and the Hashemite Kingdom of Iraq. He held various key cabinet positions and served eight terms as the Prime Minister of Iraq.\n\nFrom his first appointment as prime minister under the British Mandate in 1930, Nuri was a major political figure in Iraq under the monarchy. The 1930 Anglo-Iraqi Treaty granted Britain permanent military prerogatives in Iraq, but also paved the way for the country’s nominal independence and entry as a member of the League of Nations in 1932. Nuri was forced to flee the country after the 1941 Iraqi coup d’état which brought a pro-Nazi government to power, but following a British-led intervention he was re-installed as prime minister.\n\n.\n\nFirst Republic\n\nThe Iraqi Republic was a state forged in 1958 under the rule of President Muhammad Najib ar-Ruba’i and Prime Minister Abd al-Karim Qasim. ar-Ruba’i and Qasim first came to power through the 14 July Revolution in which the Kingdom of Iraq’s Hashemite dynasty was overthrown. As a result, the Kingdom and the Arab Federation were dissolved and the Iraqi republic established. Arab nationalists later took power and overthrew Qasim in the Ramadan Revolution in February 1963, and then Nasserists consolidated their power after another coup in November 1963. The era ended with the Ba’athist rise to power in a coup in July 1968.\n\nMuhammad Najib ar-Ruba’i (1904–1965)\n\nwas the first president of Iraq (Chairman of Sovereignty Council), from 14 July 1958 to 8 February 1963.Together with Abdul Karim Qassim he was one of the leaders of the 14 July Revolution that toppled King Faisal II in 1958.\n\nAbdul-Karim Qasim Muhammad Bakr al-Fadhli al-Zubaidi\n\n21 November 1914 – 9 February 1963) was an Iraqi military officer and nationalist who came to power in 1958 when the Iraqi monarchy was overthrown during the 14 July Revolution.
