        "text": "BAGHDAD, Iraq, April 21 - Shiite leaders on Friday selected Jawad al-Maliki, one of their more conservative, forceful and outspoken officials, as their nominee for prime minister, opening the door for him to become the leader of Iraq's first full-term government since the fall of Saddam Hussein.\n\nDespite earlier misgivings, Kurdish and Sunni Arab leaders said they intended to support Mr. Maliki, 56, a hard-nosed negotiator and close ally of the departing prime minister, Ibrahim al-Jaafari. The prime minister's agreement on Thursday to step aside broke a two-month political deadlock that had worsened Iraq's instability and contributed to an increase in sectarian killings across the nation.\n\nThough Sunni Arab leaders voiced support for Mr. Maliki on Friday, he has been a backer of strict policies intended to keep former supporters of Mr. Hussein's Sunni-dominated government out of power. He pushed for de-Baathification, a program to remove former Baath Party members from important jobs in post-invasion Iraq.\n\nAnd in contrast to more moderate Iraqi leaders who have sought to bring insurgents into the political process, Mr. Maliki pushed proposals aimed at the Sunni-dominated insurgency that called for the death penalty not only for those who commit murder but also for anyone, he said last year, found to \"finance, propagate, cover up, support or provide shelter for the terrorists, no matter how involved they are.\"\n\nIf the Iraqi National Assembly can agree on other senior government leaders, Mr. Maliki, a senior member of the Islamic Dawa Party who fled to Iran and then Syria after being threatened with death by Mr. Hussein's government, will be asked to form a cabinet. Several key political leaders said in interviews on Friday night that agreement had been reached on posts the Assembly must first approve, including president and Assembly speaker.\n\nThey said the current president, Jalal Talabani, a Kurd, would retain his job, while a top Sunni Arab leader, Mahmoud Mashhadani, was expected to become speaker despite concerns from some Kurds and Shiites who sought someone more moderate.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
