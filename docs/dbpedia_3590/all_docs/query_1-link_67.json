        "text": "TAL AFAR, IRAQ  Iraq’s prime minister on Monday toured the ancient northern city of Tal Afar, reportedly ignoring a threat of a chemical-weapon strike, to congratulate Iraqi forces for rousting militants from their stronghold near Syria, Iraqi television reported.\n\nIn Baghdad, a car bomb exploded outside a restaurant in the Mansour neighborhood Monday night, witnesses said. Hospital officials said at least two people were killed and 17 hurt. A doctor at Yarmouk Hospital said most of the victims were women.\n\nAl-Iraqiya television, which showed no pictures, said Prime Minister Ibrahim al-Jaafari was in the Tal Afar area despite an insurgent threat to unleash chemical and biological arms on the 5,000 Iraqi soldiers and commandos, backed by 3,500 troops from the U.S. 3rd Armored Cavalry regiment, who roared into the city Saturday.\n\nThe offensive \"was a great shock to al-Qaida. They were thrown off balance and issued this threat. We will be on the lookout,\" Interior Minister Bayan Jabr said.\n\nMilitant positions were found largely deserted Sunday, and the raiders discovered a network of tunnels below the city through which the insurgents were believed to have fled to the countryside.\n\nIraqi military officials said the offensive left almost 200 suspected militants dead and more than 315 captured.\n\nAmong that number were 40 insurgents killed Monday in clashes between militants and Iraqi troops.\n\nThe raids were launched in response to a roadside bombing of an Iraqi patrol that killed one soldier and wounded three, said Capt. Mohammed Ahmed, an Iraqi spokesman in Tal Afar. He said 27 militants were arrested.\n\nNo U.S. soldiers were reported killed in the fighting.\n\nAl-Iraqiya said al-Jaafari was in Tal Afar despite \"a terrorist threat to attack the city with chemical and biological weapons.\"\n\nThe insurgents have issued two Web postings since Friday, vowing to use chemical weapons against U.S. and Iraqi government interests in Baghdad, including the Green Zone, which houses the U.S. Embassy, Iraq’s parliament and government offices.\n\nAlso, Abu-Musab al-Zarqawi, leader of al-Qaida in Iraq, posted audio Sunday on the Internet accusing U.S. and Iraqi forces of using poison gas in the Tal Afar offensive. The authenticity of the tape could not be independently verified, but the voice was similar to other postings attributed to him. U.S. officials consistently have denied using poison gas in warfare.\n\nIn a new Web posting Monday, insurgents offered a bounty of nearly $200,000 for the deaths of al-Jaafari, Jabr and Defense Minister Sadoun al-Dulaimi in retaliation for the Tal Afar offensive.\n\nThe Islamic Army in Iraq, which previously claimed responsibility for kidnappings and killings of foreigners, called on its \"holy fighters to strike the infidels with an iron fist.\" It offered $100,000 for al-Jaafari, $50,000 for Jabr and $30,000 for al-Dulaimi.\n\nIn the days before the Tal Afar offensive, U.S. forces carried out airstrikes and joined Iraqi forces in encircling the city about 60 miles from Syria.\n\nTal Afar has now been swept clear of extremists for the second time in a year.\n\n\"The terrorists had seen it coming (and prepared) tunnel complexes to be used as escape routes,\" said Army Maj. Gen. Rick Lynch, deputy chief of staff for coalition forces.\n\n]>]>]>]>]>]>]>]>]>]>]>]>]>]>]>]>]>]>]>]>]>]>]>]>]>]>]>]>]>]>]>]>]>]>]>]>"
