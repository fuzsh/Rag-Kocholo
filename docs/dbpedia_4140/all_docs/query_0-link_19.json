        "text": "Johan Samsing meets prof. Edward \"Rocky\" Kolb, for a Science Talk in Niels Bohr Office about his work on the early universe:\n\nEdward \"Rocky\" Kolb is an American cosmologist and a professor at the University of Chicago as well as the dean of Physical Sciences. He is known for his groundbreaking work on Big Bang cosmology, including baryogenesis, nucleosynthesis and dark matter. He is the author, with Michael Turner, of the highly popular textbook The Early Universe. E. Kolb was awarded the 2010 Dannie Heineman Prize for Astrophysics.\n\nIn this video series, Johan Samsing (NBIA) meets 7 outstanding scientists, each of which have made profound contributions to our understanding of the Universe within the areas of black holes, gravitational waves, early universe dynamics, and quantum gravity.\n\nThe recordings took place at the Niels Bohr Office during the conference \"Current Themes in High Energy Physics, Gravity and Cosmology\" held by the Niels Bohr International Academy from Aug. 21st to 25th, 2023."
