        "text": "IMO systems innovation is all about learning to understand and work with emergence. Thus this quote is a good reminder to ecosystem builders and systems innovators \"You don't need something more to get something more...\" Murray Gell-Mann was the leading figure in the study of elementary particle physics in the middle years of the 20th. If you are not sure what emergence is, here is a video where I explain: https://t.ly/lRANP\n\nIt is with a heavy heart that we bid farewell to one of the most influential physicists of our time, Peter Higgs, who passed away today at the age of 94. Higgs will forever be remembered for his groundbreaking contributions to the field of particle physics, particularly his prediction of the Higgs Boson, a discovery that has reshaped our understanding of the universe. In 1964, Peter Higgs proposed the existence of a new particle, now famously known as the Higgs Boson, as a crucial component of the mechanism responsible for giving other particles mass. His theoretical work laid the foundation for the Standard Model of particle physics, revolutionizing our understanding of fundamental particles and their interactions. It wasn't until nearly five decades later, in 2012, that scientists at CERN confirmed the existence of the Higgs Boson through experiments conducted at the Large Hadron Collider. This monumental discovery not only validated Higgs' theory but also provided a crucial piece of the puzzle in our quest to unravel the mysteries of the universe. Peter Higgs' legacy extends far beyond the realm of academia. His work has inspired generations of physicists and has paved the way for countless scientific advancements. Today, as we mourn his passing, let us also celebrate his remarkable contributions to science and the profound impact he has left on our understanding of the universe. Rest in peace, Dr. Higgs. Your brilliance will continue to shine bright in the annals of scientific history. #PeterHiggs #HiggsBoson #Physics #Legacy"
