        "text": "Nikita Nekrasov, theoretical physicist, for many years associated with IHES, has been awarded the 2023 Dannie Heineman Prize for Mathematical Physics.\n\nThis award acknowledges Nekrasov’s “elegant application of powerful mathematical techniques to extract exact results for quantum field theories, as well as shedding light on integrable systems and non-commutative geometry.”\n\nProfessor at the Simons Center for Geometry and Physics at Stony Brook, Nikita Nekrasov was a permanent professor at IHES in 2000-2013, and a visiting professor almost every year since then. He is also on the board of Friends of IHES, a US-based non-profit organization.\n\nSome of the important contributions that have earned him this prestigious prize are discussed in the paper “Seiberg-Witten Prepotential from Instanton Counting”, that he has worked on during the time he spent as a permanent professor at IHES. Remarkably, this is the most-cited single-author paper by a researcher affiliated with IHES and this year marks its 20th anniversary.\n\nThe Dannie Heineman Prize is awarded every year by the American Institute of Physics and the American Physical Society to researchers who have made significant contributions to the field of mathematical physics.\n\nIHES warmly congratulates Prof. Nekrasov on this award!"
