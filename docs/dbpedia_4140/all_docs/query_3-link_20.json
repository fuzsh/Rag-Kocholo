The Council may recommend approval of new honors to the Board.\n\nThe Prizes and Awards Committee and the Council must evaluate whether a proposal for a new honor is consistent with the Society’s policies and procedures and may consider, among other things, whether the scope of the new honor is appropriately aligned with the scope of the unit or the Society, the finances of the unit’s existing honors, and the nomination history of the unit’s existing honors.\n\nH2.9 Establishing, Discontinuing, or Modifying a Unit Award: The Executive Committees of units may establish, discontinue, or modify Unit Awards in coordination with the APS Membership Department.\n\nH2.10 Reporting: Units or standing committees may be required to provide, with reasonable notice, information related to the administration of an honor to the Society, occasionally or regularly.\n\nH2.11 Guarantee of Invited Papers for Honor Recipients: Units or standing committees which administer Prizes, Awards, Lectureship Awards, or Dissertation Awards should guarantee an invited paper to recipients of such honors at a scientific meeting for which the unit or standing committee is allocated invited sessions.\n\nH2.12 Exceptions: Petitions for exceptions to APS Honors Program policies and procedures must be first reviewed by the Prizes and Awards Committee or by the Committee on Fellowship. The appropriate committee may forward policy exception requests to the Council for consideration.\n\nH3. Nominations\n\nH3.1 Honors in Recognition of a Given Achievement. An individual must not receive more than one Society Prize and Award, Prize, Award, or Lectureship Award for any given work or achievement unless the individual has significantly extended the previously-recognized work or achievements such that further recognition is appropriate.\n\nH3.2 Nominator Limitations: An individual may only participate in one active nomination for a particular prize or award, excluding nominations for APS Fellowship and Unit Awards. Any individual serving on a selection committee must not participate in any nominations reviewed by the selection committee regardless of the nomination’s original submit date. Participating in a nomination is considered serving as a nominator, serving as a co-sponsor, or writing a letter in support of a nomination submitted by another individual. APS membership must not be imposed as a requirement to submit nominations for Society Prizes and Awards, Prizes, and Awards.\n\nH3.3 Consideration Period for Society Prize and Award, Prize, Award, and Lectureship Award Nominations: Nominations for Society Prizes and Awards, Prizes, Awards, and Lectureship Awards must be reconsidered in the next nomination cycle, in either the original form or in an updated form, provided the nominator recertifies the nomination prior to the deadline and provided any other eligibility requirements are still met. A nomination not recommended after review by three consecutive selection committees is considered expired and is removed from further consideration, unless a different period is specified in the honor rules. Expired nominees may be renominated.\n\nH3.4 Consideration Period for Fellowship Nominations: Nominations for APS Fellowship must be reconsidered in the next nomination cycle, in either the original form or in an updated form, provided the nominator recertifies the nomination prior to the deadline. A nomination not recommended after review by two consecutive selection committees is considered expired and is removed from further consideration. Expired nominees may be renominated.\n\nH3.5 Team Nominations: Multiple individuals may be nominated together as a team for Society Prizes and Awards, Prize, and Awards unless otherwise stated in the individual honor rules. Teams should include only primary members who made original and indispensable contributions.\n\nH3.6 Self Nominations: An individual must not be permitted to nominate themselves for Society Prizes and Awards, Prizes, Awards, and Dissertation Awards, except for the Irwin Oppenheim Award.\n\nH3.7 Posthumous Honors: Nominations of known deceased persons must not be considered. Honors may be conferred posthumously if the recipient is approved following Society policies and procedures prior to death.\n\nH3.8 Frequency of Presentation: Honors may be conferred annually, biennially, quadrennially, or not at all if no suitable nominees are available.\n\nH3.9 Career-Stage Restrictions: Eligibility for honors may be restricted by an individual’s career stage, typically defined by the number of years since the individual received a terminal degree. Honors with career-stage restrictions must include exceptions for career breaks due to child, dependent, or family care, illness, military service, or similar reasons.\n\nH4. Selection Committees\n\nH4.1 Selection Committees: Selection Committees recommend recipients to the appropriate entity for approval, if qualified nominees are available. Honors Selection Committees are appointed by the unit, committee, or other body which has oversight over the honor. Appointments are subject to verification of compliance with Honors Policies and Procedures by APS staff, with oversight by the respective Council Committee: Prizes and Awards or Fellowship.\n\nH4.2 Selection Committee Composition: Selection Committees should be composed of a chair, vice chair, and additional members. The vice chair serves one year before moving into the chair position to serve one additional year as chair. Units without a Selection Committee chair and vice chair process like this should adopt and follow a process that ensures continuity, information transfer, and institutional memory from year to year. The overseeing unit, committee, or other body determines the role of the chair, i.e. convening or voting role. When the chair is a convener only, the chair may serve as substitute reviewer for nominations which otherwise lack a sufficient number of reviewers.\n\nH4.3 Onboarding: Any individual serving on a selection committee for a Society Prize or Award, Prize, Award, Dissertation Award, or APS Fellowship is required to certify they have reviewed and understand a set of onboarding materials related to the scope and purpose of the honor, Society policies and procedures, or other matters determined by the Society.\n\nH4.4 Conflicts of Interest: Conflicts of interest arise between reviewer and nominee in situations where there are close personal or professional relationships, lines of authority, or fiscal responsibility. Some examples include:\n\nResiding at the same institution, division, or department within the past four years\n\nCollaborations (co-authors, post-docs, etc.) published within the past four years\n\nFinancial via direct chain of command and/or participation in tenure, promotion, salary or forms of support by either party\n\nMember of the same center or sharing any funding contract\n\nRelationship due to immediate blood relation, current or prior marriage or civil union\n\nCurrent or prior students, advisees, and advisors,\n\nNominator or participant in the nomination package\n\nSelection Committee members are responsible for disclosing all potential conflicts of interest prior to review and assessment of nominations. The primary conflicts of concern are those between selection committee members and nominees and their institutions. Conflicts between selection committee members and nominators or supporters and their institutions are secondary but should be disclosed so all committee members are aware, and they can be managed by the selection committee. Selection committees are responsible for monitoring, handling, and reporting resolution for conflicts of interest.\n\nImmediately after nominations are available for review, committee members should review the list of nominees and their institutions/departments and disclose to the entire committee any conflicts of interest as described above or other potential conflicts as the list of examples is not exhaustive. The committee should unanimously agree on a response based on the level of the conflict. Recusal from scoring and discussion of the person with whom a committee member has a conflict is likely appropriate for most cases. In more serious cases, a new committee member may need to be identified. In some cases, disclosure to the committee may be considered sufficient. The chair is responsible for documenting the details of each conflict and the committee’s unanimous response in the chair report. If the committee cannot agree unanimously, the conflicted committee member(s) should be recused from scoring and discussing the affected nomination(s).\n\nGiven the large size of many institutions where physicists work, and the number and variety of their departments/divisions, shared institutional affiliation is less of a concern in these cases than shared department/division affiliation.
