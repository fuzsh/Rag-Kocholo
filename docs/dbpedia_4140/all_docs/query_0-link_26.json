He became the Principal Investigator of LIGO in 1994 and was LIGO Director from 1997-2005. Barish led the effort through the approval of funding by the NSF National Science Board in 1994, and the construction and commissioning of the LIGO interferometers in Livingston, LA and Hanford, WA in 1997. He created the LIGO Scientific Collaboration, which now numbers more than 1,000 collaborators worldwide to carry out the science. The Advanced LIGO proposal was developed while Barish was director and he has continued to play a leading role in LIGO and Advanced LIGO. He was president of the APS, the American Physical Society in 2011. He was awarded the 2017 Nobel Prize in Physics. In 2018, Barish was honored as the Alumnus of the year by the University of California, Berkeley, received an honorary doctorate at Southern Methodist University, and was conferred the Honorary Degree Doctor Honoris Causa of Sofia University St. Kliment Ohridski.\n\nRead More\n\nLee Berger\n\n2016 Rolex National Geographic Explorer of the Year, Paleoanthropologist | Phillip Tobias Chair of Paleo-Anthropology, University of the Witwatersrand\n\nLee R.

Buehler is a materials scientist and engineer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. As a professor and the department head at MIT‚Äôs Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, he leads the Laboratory for Atomistic and Molecular Mechanics (LAMM). His primary research focuses around materials science and mechanics of natural and biological protein materials (materiomics), how protein materials define our body and how they fail catastrophically (fracture, deformation, disease), large-scale atomistic modeling, protein based materials and biopolymers, interaction of chemistry and mechanics, bridging chemical scales to continuum theories of materials, modeling of bio-nano-materials phenomena, multiple-scale simulation, development and use of multi-scale simulation tools. His teaching activities center on the application of a computational materials science approach to understand functional material properties in biological and synthetic materials, specifically focused on mechanical properties. He has published several hundred scholarly articles on biomaterials design and modeling, material characterization and synthesis, and authored several books. He has received numerous awards and recognitions, including the Harold E. Edgerton Faculty Achievement Award for exceptional distinction in teaching and in research or scholarship, the highest honor bestowed on young MIT faculty.\n\nRead More\n\nRobbert Dijkgraaf\n\nMathematical Physicist | Director and Leon Levy Professor, Institute for Advanced Study\n\nRobbert Dijkgraaf is Director and Leon Levy Professor at the Institute for Advanced Study, one of the world‚Äôs leading centers for curiosity-driven research in the sciences and humanities. Dijkgraaf is a mathematical physicist who has made important contributions to string theory and the advancement of science education. In addition to discovering deep connections between matrix models, topological string theory, and supersymmetric quantum field theory, Dijkgraaf has developed precise formulas for the counting of bound states that explain the entropy of certain black holes. Past President of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences and Co-Chair (since 2009) of the InterAcademy Council, Dijkgraaf is a distinguished public policy adviser and passionate advocate for science and the arts. Many of his activities, which have included frequent appearances on Dutch television, a monthly newspaper column, and the launch of the science education website Proefjes.nl are at the interface between science and society. In 2019, he received honorary doctorates from the Vrije Universiteit Brussel and Leiden University and was awarded the inaugural Iris Medal for Excellent Science Communication.\n\nRead More\n\nShep Doeleman\n\nAstronomer | Founding Director, Event Horizon Telescope Project, Center for Astrophysics, Harvard & Smithsonian\n\nShep Doeleman received his B.A. from Reed College in 1986 and left soon after for a year in Antarctica where he ran multiple experiments in the polar cusp program at McMurdo Station on the Ross Ice Shelf. With an appreciation for the challenges and rewards of instrumental work in difficult circumstances, he returned to complete a Ph.D. in Astrophysics at MIT. Now as an astronomer and senior research fellow at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, he leads the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) whose goal has been to image the event horizon of a black hole: the boundary where gravity is so strong that even light cannot escape. The EHT does this by linking radio dishes around the globe into a virtual Earth-sized telescope with the highest angular resolution possible from the surface of our planet. On April 10th, 2019, the EHT project announced the first image of a black hole, confirming (at least for the moment) Einstein‚Äôs theories at the boundary of a supermassive black hole, and opening a new window onto the study of these most mysterious objects. Doeleman is working now on next steps to improve the EHT, sharpening our focus on black holes even further by adding to the global array and extension to telescopes in space. The goal now is to move beyond still images and make real-time movies of black holes. Doeleman was awarded the 2020 Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics as the Founding Director of the EHT Collaboration for the first image of a supermassive black hole.\n\nRead More\n\nSylvia Earle\n\nOceanographer, Marine Biologist | President, Chairman, Mission Blue\n\nNational Geographic Society Explorer-in-Residence Dr. Sylvia A.

In 2018, he was elected a member of the National Academy of Sciences.\n\nRead More"
