        "text": "HUNTSVILLE, Alabama - A NASA scientist at Huntsville's Marshall Space Flight Center has won a national award for her work in astrophysics. Dr. Chryssa Kouveliotou is the 2012 recipient of the Dannie Heineman prize in astrophysics, awarded jointly each year by the American Institute of Physics and the American Astronomical Society. The award is named for a Belgan-American engineer, businessman and philanthropist.\n\nKouveliotou was cited \"for her extensive accomplishments and discoveries in the areas of gamma ray bursts and their afterglows, soft gamma ray repeaters and magnetars.\" The award particularly mentions her collaborative efforts and her \"effectiveness and insights in using multi-wavelength observations.\"\n\nKouveliotou, a NASA astrophysicist since 2004, has been the principal researcher on numerous American and European research projects. She is currently a co-investigator on the Gamma-ray Burst Monitor, an instrument flying aboard the Femi Gamma-ray Space Telescope.\n\nKouveliotou was part of the team that first revealed that gamma-ray bursts were originating from outside the galaxy. Her team also were the first to confirm the ultra-dense neutron stars called magnetars.\n\nKouveliotou has won numerous other awards for her work including the Descartes Prize in 2004 and NASA Space Act Award in 2005. She is one of the 10 most cited experts in space science journals published worldwide.\n\n\"I am very grateful and honored to be recognized by the community with this very important award,\" Kouveliotou said in a statement. \"I am also very pleased to be recognized for building collaborations, which I consider to be an indispensable tool in scientific research today.\""
