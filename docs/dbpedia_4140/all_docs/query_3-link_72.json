        "text": "What Does Science Say About God?\n\nA few days ago I posted a update on one of my social networks. It was a simple scientific quote about the axis of the earth ending with the statement, “I love science…”. I was met with a response from a follower that mirrored what I myself have heard and even thought in previous seasons of my life, “How can you love science and still believe in God when science so clearly disproves the existence of a God?”\n\nWhile I would certainly concede that many within the scientific community would attempt to state or impose this position as a fact, in my experience science has done just the opposite, it has strengthened and encouraged my faith in the Creator. What I perceive to be truth is that science can encourage whichever argument you are inclined to want to believe. If you want to deny the existence of intelligent design, there are ample sources out there from which one could reference to establish an argument against a God. But, I’m convinced that there is also ample scientific evidence in favor of a Creator.\n\nI know many would argue, “but you are not a scientist ”… and I would concede that you are completely accurate, and as has been so adequately stated so also could be my argument for most reading this, “You also are likely not a scientist”. But if science so definitively disproves the existence of God as so many adamantly claim, it would also stand to reason that those who have dedicated their lives to the study of science, would collectively agree. But the truth of the matter is, there is significant disagreement within the scientific community on the subject because the evidence presented by one group as “conclusive” is deemed significantly “inconclusive” by another camp. We’ve heard the quotes against intelligent design shouted from the rooftops to the point that many simply accept that Science and Religion have no common ground, but I would like to present you with some perspectives from SCIENTISTS who don’t agree with the position that so many assume to be the “scientific position” of Atheism…\n\nSo, here are some quotes that you may not have heard before:\n\n“The beginning of the universe seems to present insuperable difficulties unless we agree to look on it as frankly supernatural” — Sir Arthur Eddington (1882-1944) (Expanding the universe p. 178) Eddington is considered to have been one of the most influential astrophysicists of the 20th century\n\n“I find it quite improbable that such order came out of chaos. there has to be some organizing principle. God to me is a mystery but is the explanation for the miracle of existence, why there is something of nothing” – Allan Sandage (1926-2010) (Sizing up the Cosmos p.b9) Sandage is considered to be one of the founders of modern astronomy. He discovered Quasars.\n\n“As we survey all the evidence, the thought insistently arises that some supernatural agency must be involved. Is it possible that suddenly, without intending to, we have stumbled upon scientific proof of the existence of a supreme being? Was it God who stepped in and so providentially crafted the cosmos for our benefit?” – George S. Greenstein (F.Heeren, Show Me God, P.233) professor of Astrophysics in the university of Amherst Massachusetts.\n\n“In the history of science, ever since the famous trial of Galileo, it has repeatedly been claimed that scientific truth cannot be reconciled with the religious interpretation of the world. Although I am now convinced that scientific truth is unassailable in its own field, I have never found it possible to dismiss the content of religious thinking as simply part of an outmoded phase in the consciousness of mankind, a part we shall have to give up from now on, Thus in the course of my life I have repeatedly been compelled to ponder on the relationship of these two regions of though, for I have never been able to doubt the reality of that to which they point.” Werner Heisenberg, Across the Frontiers, Chapter XVI (p. 213), Harper and row, publishers, New York, New York, USA. 1974\n\n“Gerald Schroeder, the Israeli physicist, released a book titled The Hidden Face of God in 2001. That all existence may be the expression of information, an idea, a quantum wave function, is not fantasy and it is not some flaky idea. It’s mainstream science coming from such universities as Princeton and M.I.T. There is the growing possibility that for all existence, we humans included, there’s nothing, nothing as in “no thing,” there. The world is more a thought than a thing.58 It took humanity millennia before an Einstein discovered that, as bizarre as it may seem, the basis of matter is energy, that matter is actually condensed energy. It may take a while longer for us to discover that there is some non-thing even more fundamental than energy that forms the basis of energy, which in turn forms the basis of matter. John Archibald Wheeler likened what underlies all existence to an idea, the “bit” (the binary digit) of information that gives rise to the “it,” the substance of matter. If we can discover that underlying idea, we will have ascertained not only the basis for the unity that underlies all existence, but most important, the source of that unity. We will have encountered the hidden face of God!”59 ~Mason, Phil (2012-01-01). Quantum Glory: The Science of Heaven Invading Earth (pp. 206-207). XP Publishing. Kindle Edition.\n\n“As to the cause of the universe in context of expansion, that is left for the reader to insert, but our picture is incomplete without God.” – Edward Arthur Milne (1896-1950) (F.Heeren, Show Me God, p.166) – Milne is a British cosmologist who was awarded the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society in1935\n\n“The American physicist and cosmologist, Robert Jastrow explains the theological implications for the discovery of this degree of fine-tuning in the universe. For the scientist who has lived by his faith in the power of reason, the story ends like a bad dream. He has scaled the mountains of ignorance; he is about to conquer the highest peak; as he pulls himself over the final rock, he is greeted by a band of theologians who have been sitting there for centuries.”50 ~ Mason, Phil (2012-01-01). Quantum Glory: The Science of Heaven Invading Earth (p. 204). XP Publishing. Kindle Edition.\n\nProfessor Robert Griffiths, the American physicist who in 1984 was awarded the Heinemann Prize in Mathematical Physics, once said, “If we need an atheist for a debate, I go to the philosophy department. The physics department isn’t much use!”51 Mason, Phil (2012-01-01). Quantum Glory: The Science of Heaven Invading Earth (p. 204). XP Publishing. Kindle Edition.\n\nThe IBM mathematician, Clifford Pickover, writes in his book, The Loom of God, “I do not know if God is a mathematician, but mathematics is the loom upon which God weaves the fabric of the universe.”52 ~Mason, Phil (2012-01-01). Quantum Glory: The Science of Heaven Invading Earth (p. 205). XP Publishing. Kindle Edition.\n\n“The Russian theoretical physicist, Alexander Polyakov, who was awarded the Heinemann Prize for Mathematical Physics in 1986, said, We know that nature is described by the best of all possible mathematics because God created it. So there is a possibility that the best of all possible mathematics will be created out of physicists’ attempts to describe nature.”57~Mason, Phil (2012-01-01). Quantum Glory: The Science of Heaven Invading Earth (p. 206). XP Publishing. Kindle Edition.\n\n“Dr. Paul Davies, author of God and the New Physics wrote, “The laws of physics seem themselves to be the product of exceedingly ingenious design.”42 ~Mason, Phil (2012-01-01). Quantum Glory: The Science of Heaven Invading Earth (p. 202). XP Publishing. Kindle Edition.\n\nProfessor Paul Davies said, “There is for me powerful evidence that there is something going on behind it all…It seems as though somebody has fine-tuned nature’s numbers to make the Universe. The impression of design is overwhelming!”38 ~Mason, Phil (2012-01-01). Quantum Glory: The Science of Heaven Invading Earth (p. 200). XP Publishing. Kindle Edition.\n\nSir Roger Penrose, the brilliant English mathematical physicist said, “There is something absolute and ‘God-given’ about mathematical truth….In my own mind, the absoluteness of mathematical truth and the Platonic existence of mathematical concepts are essentially the same thing.” 35 ~ Mason, Phil (2012-01-01). Quantum Glory: The Science of Heaven Invading Earth (p. 199). XP Publishing. Kindle Edition.\n\nEinstein once said, “The human mind is not capable of grasping the Universe. We are like a little child entering a huge library.…The child knows that someone must have written those books. It does not know who or how. But the child notes a definite plan in the arrangement of the books – a mysterious order which it does not comprehend, but only dimly suspects.”34 ~ Mason, Phil (2012-01-01). Quantum Glory: The Science of Heaven Invading Earth (p. 199). XP Publishing. Kindle Edition.\n\n“As a man who has devoted his whole life to the most clear headed science, to the study of matter, I can tell you this much as a result of my research about atoms: There is no matter as such. All matter originates and exists only by virtue of a force which brings the particle of an atom to vibration and holds this most minute solar system of the atom together. We must assume behind this force the existence of a conscious and intelligent Mind. This Mind is the matrix of all matter”. ~Max Planck (Founder of Quantum Mechanics) – Mason, Phil (2012-01-01). Quantum Glory: The Science of Heaven Invading Earth (pp. 195-196). XP Publishing. Kindle Edition.\n\n“The first gulp from the glass of natural sciences will turn you into an atheist, but at the bottom of the glass God is waiting for you.” [“Der erste Trunk aus dem Becher der Naturwissenschaft macht atheistisch, aber auf dem Grund des Bechers wartet Gott.”] (Heisenberg, as cited in Hildebrand 1988, 10) Werner Heisenberg – Father of Quantum Physics\n\n“Christianity has become a historical factor subservient to a secular culture, instead of functioning as the creative power it once was”. -Louis Dupre, Professor of Philosophy at Yale University\n\n(http://www.crosscurrents.org/dupre.htm)\n\nMax Planck (1858-1947)\n\n“It was not by accident that the greatest thinkers of all ages were deeply religious souls.” –German physicist, noted for work on quantum theory\n\nWilliam H. Bragg (1862-1942)\n\n“From religion comes a man’s purpose; from science, his power to achieve it. Sometimes people ask if religion and science are not opposed to one another. They are: in the sense that the thumb and fingers of my hands are opposed to one another. It is an opposition by means of which anything can be grasped.” –British physicist, chemist, and mathematician. Awarded Nobel Prize in 1915\n\nWernher Von Braun (1912-1977)\n\n“I find it as difficult to understand a scientist who does not acknowledge the presence of a superior rationality behind the existence of the universe as it is to comprehend a theologian who would deny the advances of science.” –German-American rocket scientist\n\n“We are not human beings having a spiritual experience; we are spiritual beings having a human experience.” Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, The Phenomenon of Man, (http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Pierre_Teilhard_de_Chardin)\n\n“God exists whether or not men may choose to believe in Him. The reason why many people do not believe in God is not so much that it is intellectually impossible to believe in God, but because belief in God forces that thoughtful person to face the fact that he is accountable to such a God.” Robert A. Laidlaw\n\n“A scientific discovery is also a religious discovery. There is no conflict between science and religion. Our knowledge of God is made larger with every discovery we make about the world.”–Joseph H. Taylor, Jr., who received the 1993 Nobel Prize in Physics for the discovery of the first known binary pulsar, and for his work which supported the Big Bang theory of the creation of the universe.\n\n“God [is] the author of the universe, and the free establisher of the laws of motion.”–Physicist and chemist Robert Boyle, who is considered to be the founder of modern chemistry.\n\n“I believe that the more thoroughly science is studied, the further does it take us from anything comparable to atheism.” “If you study science deep enough and long enough, it will force you to believe in God.”–Lord William Kelvin, who was noted for his theoretical work on thermodynamics, the concept of absolute zero and the Kelvin temperature scale based upon it. http://godevidence.com/2010/08/quotes-about-god/\n\n“As we conquer peak after peak we see in front of us regions full of interest and beauty, but we do not see our goal, we do not see the horizon; in the distance tower still higher peaks, which will yield to those who ascend them still wider prospects, and deepen the feeling, the truth of which is emphasized by every advance in science, that ‘Great are the Works of the Lord’.”–Sir Joseph J. Thomson, Nobel Prize winning physicist, discoverer of the electron, founder of atomic physics.\n\n“Science is incompetent to reason upon the creation of matter itself out of nothing. We have reached the utmost limit of our thinking faculties when we have admitted that because matter cannot be eternal and self-existent it must have been created.”–Physicist and mathematician James Clerk Maxwell, who is credited with formulating classical electromagnetic theory and whose contributions to science are considered to be of the same magnitude to those of Einstein and Newton.\n\n“For myself, faith begins with a realization that a supreme intelligence brought the universe into being and created man. It is not difficult for me to have this faith, for it is incontrovertible that where there is a plan there is intelligence—an orderly, unfolding universe testifies to the truth of the most majestic statement ever uttered—-’In the beginning God.”–Arthur Compton, winner of the 1927 Nobel Prize in Physics for his discovery of the Compton Effect.\n\n“God is a mathematician of a very high order and He used advanced mathematics in constructing the universe.”–Nobel Prize winning physicist Paul A. M. Dirac, who made crucial early contributions to both quantum mechanics and quantum electrodynamics.\n\n“Another source of conviction in the existence of God, connected with the reason and not with the feelings, impresses me as having much more weight. This follows from the extreme difficulty or rather impossibility of conceiving this immense and wonderful universe, including man with his capacity of looking far backwards and far into futurity, as the result of blind chance or necessity. When thus reflecting I feel compelled to look to a First Cause having an intelligent mind in some degree analogous to that of man; and I deserve to be called a Theist.”–Charles Darwin, the founder of evolutionary biology, as quoted in his autobiography.\n\n“The ghostly presence of virtual particles defies rational common sense and is nonintuitive for those unacquainted with physics. Religious belief in God, and Christian belief that God became Man around two thousand years ago, may seem strange to common-sense thinking. But when the most elementary physical things behave in this way, we should be prepared to accept that the deepest aspects of our existence go beyond our common-sense intuitions.”–Nobel Prize winning physicist Tony Hewish as quoted in the foreword to John Polkinghorne and Nicholas Beale’s book Questions of Truth: Fifty-one Responses to Questions about God, Science, and Belief.\n\n“If there are a bunch of fruit trees, one can say that whoever created these fruit trees wanted some apples. In other words, by looking at the order in the world, we can infer purpose and from purpose we begin to get some knowledge of the Creator, the Planner of all this. This is, then, how I look at God. I look at God through the works of God’s hands and from those works imply intentions. From these intentions, I receive an impression of the Almighty.”–Arno Penzias, the 1978 Nobel Prize recipient in physics as cited ‘The God I Believe in’, Joshua O. Haberman – editor, New York, Maxwell Macmillan International, 1994, 184.\n\n“Let me say that I don’t see any conflict between science and religion. I go to church as many other scientists do. I share with most religious people a sense of mystery and wonder at the universe and I want to participate in religious ritual and practices because they’re something that all humans can share.”–Sir Martin Rees, the British cosmologist and astrophysicist who has been Astronomer Royal since 1995 and was the president of the Royal Society between 2005 and 2010. Rees is the winner of the Crafoord Prize (which is the most prestigious award in astronomy), amongst many other awards.\n\n“A Creator must exist. The Big Bang ripples and subsequent scientific findings are clearly pointing to an ex nihilo creation consistent with the first few verses of the book of Genesis.”–Quantum chemist Henry F. Schaefer III, five time nominee for the Nobel Prize, as above.\n\n“When I began my career as a cosmologist some twenty years ago, I was a convinced atheist. I never in my wildest dreams imagined that one day I would be writing a book purporting to show that the central claims of Judeo-Christian theology are in fact true, that these claims are straightforward deductions of the laws of physics as we now understand them. I have been forced into these conclusions by the inexorable logic of my own special branch of physics.”–Professor of Mathematical Physics Frank Tippler, author of The Physics of Christianity and The Physics of Immortality.\n\n“But the context of religion is a great background for doing science. In the words of Psalm 19, ‘The heavens declare the glory of God and the firmament showeth his handiwork’. Thus scientific research is a worshipful act, in that it reveals more of the wonders of God’s creation.”–Arthur L. Schawlow, Professor of Physics at Stanford University and winner of the 1981 Nobel Prize in Physics.\n\n“Astronomy leads us to a unique event, a universe which was created out of nothing, and delicately balanced to provide exactly the conditions required to support life. In the absence of an absurdly improbable accident, the observations of modern science seem to suggest an underlying, one might say, supernatural plan.”–Arno Penzias, winner of the 1978 Nobel Prize in Physics.\n\n“The exquisite order displayed by our scientific understanding of the physical world calls for the divine.”–MIT physicist Vera Kistiakowsky\n\n“A common sense interpretation of the facts suggests that a superintellect has monkeyed with physics, as well as with chemistry and biology, and that there are no blind forces worth speaking about in nature. The numbers one calculates from the facts seem to me so overwhelming as to put this conclusion almost beyond question.”–Cambridge University astrophysicist and mathematician Fred Hoyle commenting on the incredible fine-tuning necessary for life to exist (as quoted in The Creator and the Cosmos by Hugh Ross).\n\n“As to the cause of the Universe, in context of expansion, that is left for the reader to insert, but our picture is incomplete without Him [God].”–Astrophysicist and mathametician Edward Milne (winner of the Royal Society’s Royal Medal, the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society, and the Bruce Medal)\n\n“What is the ultimate solution to the origin of the Universe? The answers provided by the astronomers are disconcerting and remarkable. Most remarkable of all is the fact that in science, as in the Bible, the world begins with an act of creation.”–Astronomer Robert Jastrow from Until the Sun Dies\n\n“Recently I have gone back to church regularly with a new focus to understand as best I can what it is that makes Christianity so vital and powerful in the lives of billions of people today, even though almost 2000 years have passed since the death and resurrection of Christ. Although I suspect I will never fully understand, I now think the answer is very simple: it’s true. God did create the universe about 13.7 billion years ago, and of necessity has involved Himself with His creation ever since. The purpose of this universe is something that only God knows for sure, but it is increasingly clear to modern science that the universe was exquisitely fine-tuned to enable human life. We are somehow critically involved in His purpose. Our job is to sense that purpose as best we can, love one another, and help Him get that job done.” (Smalley 2005)–Richard Smalley, winner of the 1996 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for the discovery of a new form of carbon (buckminsterfullerene or “buckyballs”).\n\n“Everyone who is seriously involved in the pursuit of science becomes convinced that a spirit is manifest in the laws of the Universe–a spirit vastly superior to that of man, and one in the face of which we with our modest powers must feel humble.”, “In view of such harmony in the cosmos which I, with my limited human mind, am able to recognize, there are yet people who say there is no God. But what really makes me angry is that they quote me for the support of such views.”–Albert Einstein Clark, Ronald W. (1971). Einstein: The Life and Times. New York: World Publishing Company\n\n“This much I can say with definiteness – namely, that there is no scientific basis for the denial of religion – nor is there in my judgment any excuse for a conflict between science and religion, for their fields are entirely different. Men who know very little of science and men who know very little of religion do indeed get to quarreling, and the onlookers imagine that there is a conflict between science and religion, whereas the conflict is only between two different species of ignorance.”\n\n“The first important quarrel of this sort arose over the advancing by Copernicus of his theory that the earth, instead of being a flat plane and the center of the universe, was actually only one of a number of little planets, rotating once a day upon its axis and circling once a year about the sun. Copernicus was a priest – the canon of a cathedral – and he was primarily a religious rather than a scientific man. He knew that the foundations of real religion are not laid where scientific discoveries of any kind can disturb them. He was persecuted, not because he went against the teachings of religion but because under his theory man was not the center of the universe and this was most displeasing news to a number of egoists.”\n\n“To me it is unthinkable that a real atheist could be a scientist.”\n\n“Religion and science, then, in my analysis are the two great sister forces which have pulled, and are still pulling, mankind onward and upward.”\n\n“The impossibility of real science and real religion ever conflicting becomes evident when one examines the purpose of science and the purpose of religion. The purpose of science is to develop – without prejudice or preconception of any kind – a knowledge of the facts, the laws and the processes of nature. The even more important task of religion, on the other hand, is to develop the consciences, the ideals and the aspirations of mankind.”–Robert Andrews Millikan, who won the 1923 Nobel Prize in Physics for his work on the elementary charge of electricity and on the photoelectric effect.\n\n“I strongly believe in the existence of God, based on intuition, observations, logic, and also scientific knowledge.”\n\n“Science, with its experiments and logic, tries to understand the order or structure of the universe. Religion, with its theological inspiration and reflection, tries to understand the purpose or meaning of the universe. These two are cross-related. Purpose implies structure, and structure ought somehow to be interpretable in terms of purpose.”\n\n“At least this is the way I see it. I am a physicist. I also consider myself a Christian. As I try to understand the nature of our universe in these two modes of thinking, I see many commonalities and crossovers between science and religion. It seems logical that in the long run the two will even converge.”–Charles Hard Townes, who received the 1964 Nobel Prize in Physics for his fundamental work in the field of quantum electronics.\n\n“I believe in God. In fact, I believe in a personal God who acts in and interacts with the creation. I believe that the observations about the orderliness of the physical universe, and the apparently exceptional fine-tuning of the conditions of the universe for the development of life suggest that an intelligent Creator is responsible.”\n\n“I believe in God because of a personal faith, a faith that is consistent with what I know about science.”\n\n“Being an ordinary scientist and an ordinary Christian seems perfectly natural to me. It is also perfectly natural for the many scientists I know who are also people of deep religious faith.”–William D. Phillips, who won the 1997 Nobel Prize in Physics for development of methods to cool and trap atoms with laser light.\n\n“I believe in God, who can respond to prayers, to whom we can give trust and without whom life on this earth would be without meaning (a tale told by an idiot). I believe that God has revealed Himself to us in many ways and through many men and women, and that for us here in the West the clearest revelation is through Jesus and those that have followed him.”–Sir Nevill Mott, recipient of the 1977 Nobel Prize in Physics for his research on the magnetic and electrical properties of noncrystalline semiconductors.\n\n“Science is a game – but a game with reality, a game with sharpened knives. If a man cuts a picture carefully into 1000 pieces, you solve the puzzle when you reassemble the pieces into a picture; in the success or failure, both your intelligences compete. In the presentation of a scientific problem, the other player is the good Lord. He has not only set the problem but also has devised the rules of the game – but they are not completely known, half of them are left for you to discover or to deduce. The uncertainty is how many of the rules God himself has permanently ordained, and how many apparently are caused by your own mental inertia, while the solution generally becomes possible only through freedom from its limitations. This is perhaps the most exciting thing in the game.”–Erwin Schroedinger, winner of the 1933 Nobel Prize in Physics “for the discovery of new productive forms of atomic theory.”\n\n“I believe in God. It makes no sense to me to assume that the Universe and our existence is just a cosmic accident, that life emerged due to random physical processes in an environment which simply happened to have the right properties. As a Christian I begin to comprehend what life is all about through belief in a Creator, some of whose nature was revealed by a man born about 2000 years ago.”–Antony Hewish, winner of the 1974 Nobel Prize in Physics for his discovery of pulsars.\n\n“Blind metaphysical necessity, which is certainly the same always and everywhere, could produce no variety of things. All that diversity of natural things which we find suited to different times and places could arise from nothing but the ideas and will of a Being, necessarily existing.”–Sir Isaac Newton, who is widely regarded to have been the greatest scientist of all time, as cited in Principia, which is perhaps the most important scientific work of all time.\n\n“Science and religion are very much alike. Both are imaginative and creative aspects of the human mind. The appearance of a conflict is a result of ignorance. We come to exist through a divine act. That divine guidance is a theme throughout our life; at our death the brain goes, but that divine guidance and love continues. Each of us is a unique, conscious being, a divine creation. It is the religious view. It is the only view consistent with all the evidence.”–Sir John Eccles, who received the 1963 Nobel Prize in Medicine and Physiology for establishing the relationship between inhibition of nerve cells and repolarization of a cell’s membrane.\n\n“Is the Church inimical to science? Growing up as a Catholic and a scientist – I don’t see it. One truth is revealed truth, the other is scientific truth. If you really believe that creation is good, there can be no harm in studying science. The more we learn about creation – the way it emerged – it just adds to the glory of God. Personally, I’ve never seen a conflict.”–Joseph E. Murray, winner of the 1990 Nobel Prize in Medicine and Physiology for work that “proved to a doubting world that it was possible to transplant organs to save the lives of dying patients.”\n\n“I find it quite improbable that such order came out of chaos. There has to be some organizing principle. God to me is a mystery but is the explanation for the miracle of existence, why there is something instead of nothing.”–Astronomer Allan Sandage, winner of the Crafoord Prize in astronomy (which is equivalent to the Nobel Prize). Sandage is considered to be one of the founders of modern astronomy and was widely regarded to be the world’s greatest cosmologist until his death in 2010. He came to belief in God as a result of his science, as he announced at a conference on the origin of the universe in 1985. He also became a Christian.\n\n“We know that nature is described by the best of all possible mathematics because God created it. So there is a chance that the best of all possible mathematics will be created out of physicists’ attempts to describe nature.”–Russian theoretical physicist Alexander Polyakov, winner of the Lars Onsager prize in 2011, the Dirac Medal and the Dannie Heineman Prize for Mathematical Physics in 1986, the Lorentz Medal in 1994, and the Oskar Klein Medal in 1996.\n\n“If we need an atheist for a debate, we go to the philosophy department. The physics department isn’t much use.”–Robert Griffiths, winner of the Heinemann Prize in mathematical physics.\n\n“For many years I have believed that God is the great designer behind all nature… All my studies in science since then have confirmed my faith. I regard the Bible as my principle source of authority.”–Sir Ghillean T. Prance, the knighted British botanist and ecologist, Fellow of the Royal Society.\n\n“I build molecules for a living. I can’t begin to tell you how difficult that job is. I stand in awe of God because of what he has done through his creation. My faith has been increased through my research. Only a rookie who knows nothing about science would say science takes away from faith. If you really study science, it will bring you closer to God.”–James Tour, one of the world’s leading nanoscientists\n\n“An equation for me has no meaning unless it expresses a thought of God.”–Srinivasa Ramanujam, who is widely regarded to be one of the greatest mathematicians of all time (on a similar plane with such greats as Archimedes and Newton).\n\n“God is Truth. There is no incompatibility between science and religion. Both are seeking the same truth. Science shows that God exists.”\n\n“The observations and experiments of science are so wonderful that the truth that they establish can surely be accepted as another manifestation of God. God shows himself by allowing man to establish truth.”–Sir Derek Barton, winner of the 1969 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, as quoted in Cosmos, Bios, Theos: Scientists Reflect on Science, God, and the Origins of the Universe, Life, and Homo sapiens.\n\n“The vast mysteries of the universe should only confirm our belief in the certainty of its Creator. I find it as difficult to understand a scientist who does not acknowledge the presence of a superior rationality behind the existence of the universe as it is to comprehend a theologian who would deny the advances of science.”\n\n“They (evolutionists) challenge science to prove the existence of God. But must we really light a candle to see the sun? They say they cannot visualize a Designer. Well, can a physicist visualize an electron? What strange rationale makes some physicists accept the inconceivable electron as real while refusing to accept the reality of a Designer on the grounds that they cannot conceive Him?”\n\n“God deliberately reduced Himself to the stature of humanity in order to visit the earth in person, because the cumulative effect over the centuries of millions of individuals choosing to please themselves rather than God had infected the whole planet. When God became a man Himself, the experience proved to be nothing short of pure agony. In man’s time-honored fashion, they would unleash the whole arsenal of weapons against Him: misrepresentation, slander, and accusation of treason. The stage was set for a situation without parallel in the history of the earth. God would visit creatures and they would nail Him to the cross!”\n\n“Although I know of no reference to Christ ever commenting on scientific work, I do know that He said, “Ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.” Thus I am certain that, were He among us today, Christ would encourage scientific research as modern man’s most noble striving to comprehend and admire His Father’s handiwork. The universe as revealed through scientific inquiry is the living witness that God has indeed been at work.”–Werner von Braun, the father of space science and the most important rocket scientist involved in the development of the U.S. space program.\n\n“There is no ground for supposing that matter and energy existed before [the Big Bang] and were suddenly galvanized into action. For what could distinguish that moment from all other moments in eternity? It is simpler to postulate creation ex nihilo—Divine will constituting Nature from nothingness.”–English mathematical physicist Edmund T. Whittaker, winner of the Copley Medal, which is the most prestigious award in British science.\n\n“The universe is a put-up job.”– Cambridge University astrophysicist Fred Hoyle, referring to the fine tuning of the laws of nature which he felt “could not be just a happy accident,” as his Cambridge colleague John Polkinghorne put it in Quarks, Chaos, and Christianity.\n\n“If the universe had not been made with the most exacting precision we could never have come into existence. It is my view that these circumstances indicate the universe was created for man to live in.”–Harvard educated NASA astrophysicist John A. O’Keefe.\n\n“Why do people cling with such ferocity to belief in a mind-independent reality? It is surely because if there is no such reality, then ultimately (as far as we can know) mind alone exists. And if mind is not a product of real matter, but rather is the creator of the illusion of material reality (which has, in fact, despite the materialists, been known to be the case, since the discovery of quantum mechanics in 1925), then a theistic view of our existence becomes the only rational alternative to solipsism.” [“Solipsism” is defined as “the view or theory that the self is all that can be known to exist.”]–Physicist Richard Conn Henry from Johns Hopkins University\n\n“There are good reasons to believe in God, including the existence of mathematical principles and order in creation. They are positive reasons, based on knowledge, rather than default assumptions based on a temporary lack of knowledge.”–Geneticist Francis Collins, the leader of the Human Genome Project and currently the director of the National Institutes of Health in the United States.\n\n“…We then examine a particular coding system in DNA and discover that UI [universal information] is conveyed within the genes. Using this DNA evidence and scientific laws governing UI as premises, we are able to develop sound, logical deductions. This leads us to the following conclusion: the God of the Bible exists and He is responsible for originating and embedding Universal Information into biological life.”–Werner Gitt, Director and Professor at the German Federal Institute of Physics and Technology, Germany. Gitt is also the head of the Department of Information Technology. The above is an excerpt from the introduction to his book Without Excuse, in which he utilizes the insights of information science to demonstrate that the origin of life can only be explained as the result of a conscious, intelligent creator.\n\n“God created the universe out of nothing in an act which also brought time into existence. Recent discoveries, such as observations supporting the Big Bang and similar astronomical phenomena, are wholly compatible with this view.”–Henry Margenau, Yale University Professor of Physics and Natural Philosophy, as cited in Cosmos, Bios, Theos: Scientists Reflect on Science, God, and the Origins of the Universe, Life, and Homo sapiens.\n\n“I think that God originated the universe and life. Homo Sapiens was created by God using the process that does not violate the physical laws of the universe significantly or none at all. (Hidden variables of quantum mechanics under God’s power?)”–Shoichi Yoshikawa, Senior Research Scientist and Professor, Department of Astrophysical Sciences, Princeton University, as cited in Cosmos, Bios, Theos: Scientists Reflect on Science, God, and the Origins of the Universe, Life, and Homo sapiens.\n\n“The question of whether there exists a Creator and Ruler of the Universe has been answered in the affirmative by some of the highest intellects that have ever existed.”–Charles Darwin, the founder of evolutionary biology, as cited in his book Descent of Man.\n\n“This sense of wonder leads most scientists to a Superior Being – der Alte, the Old One\n\n“This most beautiful system (the Universe) could only proceed from the consel and dominion of an intelligent being” – Isaac Newton – Principia, Book III Cited in : Newton’s Philosophy of Nature: Selections from his writings by H.S.Thayer p.42\n\nIt seems to me that when confronted withthe marvels of life and the universe, one must ask why and not just how. The only possible answers are religious…I find a need for God in the universe and in my own life. – Arthur L. Schawlow (1981 Nobel Prize in Physics)"
