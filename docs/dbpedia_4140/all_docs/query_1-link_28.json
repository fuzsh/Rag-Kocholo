        "text": "Observing the toroidal magnetic fields in the Milky Way's halo. Researchers led by Jun Xu and Jinlin Han from the National Astronomical Observatories of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (NAOC), have confirmed the existence of huge magnetic toroids in the halo of the Milky Way. In fact, the toroidal magnetic fields have a range from 6000 to 50000 light-years from the center of the Milky Way. The conclusion was reached after studying the data in the past 30 years concerning the polarization of the light coming from pulsars, and then subtracting the contribution from background cosmic sources. This way they obtained what is known as Faraday rotation data, and they could see how the magnetic fields in the halo of the Milky Way have reversed directions below and above the Galactic plane. The findings have been published in The Astrophysical Journal (10 May, 2024). https://lnkd.in/d7zfTfb5 #physics #physicsnews #astrophysics #astronomy #radioastronomy #milkyway #magneticfield #pulsars #polarization\n\nRipples in Space-Time: The Discovery and Impact of Gravitational Waves 🌌 1.

Researchers led by Chentao Yang at the Chalmers University of Technology, using the NOrthern Extended Millimetre Array (NOEMA), have observed for the first time several kinds of molecules in galaxies of the early universe. The galaxies studied are known as APM 08279+5255 and NCv1.143, and are located around 13000 million light-years away. Analyzing their spectra, they found evidence of the presence of molecules as the ethynyl radical (CCH), the hydronium ion (H3O+), diazenylium (N2H+), the methylidyne radical (CH), and cyclopropenylidene (c-C3H2), had never been observed before that far away, or otherwise said, so early in the universe history. The findings have been published in Astronomy & Astrophysics (14 December, 2023). https://lnkd.in/dfH6RZJM #physics #physicsnews #astrophysics #astronomy #chemistry #spectra #noema\n\nProfessor in theoretical astrophysics and part of the AAU Space Group, Thomas Tauris from AAU Materials and Production, has together with an international team of astronomers, made a fundamental discovery within pulsar astronomy 🌌🕳💥 Researchers from the international collaboration \"Transients and Pulsars with MeerKAT\" have identified the first known system of two orbiting objects, most likely a radio pulsar and a black hole, located in our galaxy in the globular cluster NGC 1851. According to Thomas Tauris, the discovery challenges the limits of the imagination and may lead to clarification of Einstein's general theory of relativity.
