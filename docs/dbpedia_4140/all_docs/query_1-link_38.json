        "text": "Using the AUM High Performance Computing Center, I have published numerous papers to date. I wanted to share with you my newly accepted publication, which also utilized the AUM-HPC. This publication is significant because it proposes a physical mechanism that can explain observational results in astronomy, such as the shadow of the M87 black hole observed by the EHT telescope, and has been accepted in a highly impactful journal in the field of astrophysics and astronomy. This paper, where I am the sole author, has been accepted for publication in the Journal of Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics, which has an impact factor of 5.3 (CiteScore 10.2).\n\nüéì 2024 Lewis Graduate Claire Zwicker (PHYS, ASTR ‚Äô23) wants to dedicate her life to solving the world's many wonders, choosing astrophysics because she ‚Äúfind[s] the questions in astronomy and physics to be very interesting to probe and answer.‚Äù Her research on binary stars in star clusters has been published in prestigious journals and earned her recognition from the American Astronomical Society. Want to learn more about her fascinating discoveries and how she's using cutting-edge technology to peer into the universe's secrets? Read the full story: https://bit.ly/3Qp6Grl\n\nThe first-ever polarised light image of #SagittariusA*, the supermassive #BlackHoles at our galaxy's centre. Using the #EventHorizonTelescope a global team captured this groundbreaking image, revealing strong, organised magnetic fields spiralling at the edge of Sgr A*. Luciano Rezzolla, Michael Kramer and Heino Falcke of the #BLACKHOLECAM team helped unveil this image. Many other researchers worldwide, including ERC-funded Anton Zensus's team working on the M2FINDERS project at the Max Planck Institute and Carolina Casadio's SMILE team working at the Institute of Astrophysics, FORTH were also involved in the research. Spoiler alert: the magnetic structure is similar to that of the black hole in the M87 galaxy.

I am thrilled to share that my first publication, which marks the initial phase of my master's project, is now live! üöÄ Under the expert guidance of Prof. Pralay Kumar Karmakar and research scholar Mr. Mritunjoy Das. I've delved into the fascinating world of astrophysics. Our research, titled \"Polytropic Spherical Astrocosmic Fluid Stability in the EiBI Gravity with Strong Collective Correlative Effects,\" explores the profound implications of EiBI gravity on gravitationally induced structure formation. Published in the esteemed Chinese Journal of Physics having impact factor 5.0 I invite you to read the full publication: https://lnkd.in/gY8f-ecH #FirstPublication #Astrophysics #EiBIGravity #Research\n\nMajor review article published: Mateusz Ruszkowski & Christoph Pfrommer (2023) Cosmic ray feedback in galaxies and galaxy clusters. Astron Astrophys Rev 31:4 https://lnkd.in/d32YZ4Ri #OpenAccess Understanding the physical mechanisms that control galaxy formation is a fundamental challenge in contemporary astrophysics. Recent advances in the field of astrophysical feedback strongly suggest that cosmic rays (CRs) may be crucially important for our understanding of cosmological galaxy formation and evolution. Here we present a review of the state-of-the-art of this field and provide a pedagogical introduction to cosmic ray plasma physics, including the physics of wave‚Äìparticle interactions, acceleration processes, CR spatial and spectral transport, and important cooling processes.\n\nHappy to finally have this paper on the arXiv! We show how to model the gas thermodynamic on top of large gravity-only simulations, and predict accurately tiny spectral distortions of the cosmic microwave background, known as the thermal Sunyaev Zel‚Äôdovich effect. At the same time, we compute the bending of light paths given by the gravity of cosmic structure, the so-called cosmic shear. The purpose is to use upcoming surveys to learn simultaneously about cosmology and astrophysics! https://lnkd.in/d7ETdBjT\n\nüåü Excited to Share My Latest Research Publication! üåü I am thrilled to announce my new paper, \"s-process Enriched Evolved Binaries in the Galaxy and the Magellanic Clouds\", published in the Publications of the Astronomical Society of Australia (PASA)üöÄ‚ú® üåå This study delves into the fascinating realm of Evolved low-mass binary stars, revealing unexpected insights into their chemical makeup!!! üí´ In observational studies focusing on low to intermediate-mass binary stars, such as Barium stars, Carbon Enhanced Metal-Poor (CEMP-s) stars, and extrinsic s-stars, we often attribute enrichment in carbon and slow neutron capture (s-process) elements to interactions with evolved companions like white dwarfs. However, our research challenges this notion. ü§î Through high-resolution optical spectra from VLT+UVES, we've uncovered a chemically peculiar sample of evolved stars, particularly the post-Asymptotic Giant Branch (post-AGB) binaries, showcasing carbon and s-process enrichments contrary to their expected depletion. This suggests an intrinsic enrichment process rather than the typical extrinsic mechanisms. üî≠ I am excited to share these groundbreaking findings and delve deeper into the mysteries of binary star chemistry! üöÄ‚ú® #Astrophysics #BinaryStars #Research #ChemicalEnrichment #ChemicallyPeculiarStars #EvolvedStars #StellarAstrophysics #Spectroscopy #Research #StellarEvolution"
