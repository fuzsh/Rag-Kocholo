        "text": "The Department of Astrophysical Sciences’ Robert Lupton, Senior Research Astronomer, has been awarded the Dannie Heineman Prize in Astrophysics. Lupton is an instrumentation and software expert, and shares this award with David Weinberg of Ohio State University, who received his Ph.D. from Princeton in 1989. The pair have been recognized by the Heineman Prize committee “for their essential contributions to facilitating, guiding, and participating in transformative science resulting from modern large-scale astronomical surveys at optical wavelengths, in particular the Sloan Digital Sky Survey.” In addition to the foundational role he played with SDSS, Lupton has led software efforts for numerous large-scale survey projects, including the Vera C. Rubin Observatory (Legacy Survey of Space and Time-LSST), Hyper Suprime-Cam on the Subaru Telescope , and the Prime Focus Spectrograph.\n\nThe Dannie Heineman Prize in Astrophysics was established by the Heineman Foundation in 1979 in honor of Dannie Heineman, a Belgian-American engineer and businessman who was a strong supporter of medical sciences, mathematical physics and astrophysics. The Dannie Heineman Prize in Astrophysics recognizes outstanding mid-career work in the field of Astrophysics. Previous Heineman Award winners from Princeton include Jim Gunn, David Spergel, Bruce Draine, Scott Tremaine, Bohdan Pacyznski, Joe Taylor, Jim Peebles and John Bahcall.\n\nAward recipients were announced by the American Astronomical Society (AAS) and the American Institute of Physics at the 237th AAS Conference in January. An award recognition is planned at an upcoming AAS meeting when both Lupton and Weinberg will be invited to speak and to receive their certificate and a monetary award."
