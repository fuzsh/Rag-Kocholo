His research interests include pattern recognition, signal processing, and computational intelligence.He received the “Shiksha Rattan Puraskar Award” for his meritorious services in the field of education by the India International Friendship Society. The award was presented by Dr. Bhishma Narain Singh, former Governor, Assam and Tamil Nadu, India. He also received the “Glory of India Gold Medal” by International Institute of Success Awareness. This award was presented by Shri Syed Sibtey Razi, former Governor of Jharkhand, India. He was also awarded with “Best Citizens of India 2013” by The International Publishing House.\n\nDr. Pavlidis holds a Diploma and a PhD degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering. His doctoral research focused on digital image processing and in particular on the optimal segmentation and compression of mixed document images, for which he received the Ericsson Award of Excellence in Telecommunications. He has worked on a variety of research and development projects, education & lifelong learning programs, computerization activities for the public, private and industrial sectors, as well as multimedia projects at a professional level. In 2002 he joined the Athena Research Center where he serves as a “Research Director” (Researcher A’). He has been the head of the Multimedia Department and head of research at the Clepsydra - Cultural Heritage Digitization Center. He is intensely involved in research and development projects, national and European, and had the opportunity to work in a wide range of research and innovation activities, including typical monothematic engineering and IT subjects, as well as cross-disciplinary topics in broad interdisciplinary groups (archeology, art history, museology, archaeometry, education). His research interests focus on digital image and multimedia technologies, content analysis and retrieval, machine learning and artificial intelligence, human-machine interaction, intelligent interactive environments, multi-sensory environments and ubiquitous and ambient intelligence, 3D digitization, as well as cross-reality applications. He has been a member of numerous scientific, technical and management committees and is the creator and Editor-in-Chief of the International Journal on Computational Methods in Heritage Science. He has served as an evaluator of research and development projects as well as a reviewer of research proposals. He is a member of the Technical Chamber of Greece, a member of the Association of Greek Researchers, a founding member of the Association of Researchers of the Athena Research Center, a senior member of the IEEE, a member of the CAA and a Board member of CAA-Gr.\n\nVisit George Pavlidis' personal web site @ http://georgepavlides.info\n\nI am a senior IEEE member and currently working as Data Scientist at Krian Software, Wolfsburg, Germany.

Also, I associated with Ennoventure Technologies Private Limited, Bengaluru, India as a software consultant. I received my Ph.D. from C. U. Shah University, Surendranagar, Gujarat, India in 2017, with outstanding research contributions in biometric security and data encryption. I have more than 8 years of research experience along with 4 years of teaching experience in various engineering institutes such as MBIT (Vallabh Vidyanagar), Atmiya Institute of Technology and Science (Rajkot), Saurashtra University (Rajkot), and Government Polytechnic (Rajkot). My research interests are medical image analysis, artificial intelligence, machine learning, deep learning, digital watermarking, image & video processing, biometrics, content security, compressive sensing, signal processing, and industrial applications. I have written over 15 technical books and published them with respected publishers such as Springer and CRC Press. Also, I have more than 50 research publications in various international journals and international conferences that are indexed in Web of Science (WoS) and Scopus. In addition, I have delivered many expert talks on computer vision and artificial intelligence topics. I have been invited as a reviewer in various reputed journals such as IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech and Natural Language Processing, ACM Transactions on Multimedia Computing, Communications and Applications, IEEE Consumer Electronics Magazine, IEEE Access, IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics, Signal Processing: Image Communication, Pattern Recognition, Computers, and Electrical Engineering, Informatics in Medicine, Journal of Ambient Intelligence and Humanized Computing, IET Biometrics, and IET Image Processing.\n\nPramode Verma (pverma@ou.edu) is Professor Emeritus of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the Gallogly College of Engineering of the University of Oklahoma.
