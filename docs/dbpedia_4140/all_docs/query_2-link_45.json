        "text": "Rutgers Physics News\n\nThanks to Eugenia Etkina, Rutgers has been named a member of the PhysTEC \"5+ Club\" for graduating five or more physics teachers in the past academic year. This puts Rutgers in the 99th percentile among institutions for physics teacher preparation. PhysTEC is a joint venture of the American Physical Society and the American Association of Physics Teachers dedicated to improving education of future physics teachers. See https://www.phystec.org for more info.\n\nCongratulations Eugenia!\n\n(12-6-2019)\n\nCongratulations once again to our Society of Physics Students Chapter. The SPS National Office has awarded the Rutgers SPS Chapter Outstanding Chapter status.\n\nCongratulations to the Chapter, and particularly the Officers, on the fine work they did to earn that status:\n\nLucas Hansen, President\n\nRiya Prabhudesai, Vice President\n\nSkanda Rao, Treasurer\n\nNoah Paladino, Secretary\n\nEsha Rao, Outreach Coordinator\n\nGeorgia Sandidge, Public Relations\n\nChong Xia, Event Coordinator\n\nAnd a tip of the hat to faculty advisors Matt Buckley, Jed Pixley, and Blakesley Burkhart.\n\n(12-5-2019)\n\nMatt Blackman, former Physics Major and graduate of the Rutgers 5-year Physics Education Program with Eugenia Etkina, was named the 2019 PhysTEC Teacher of the Year. PhysTEC, the Physics Teacher Education Coalition, is a joint project of the APS and the AAPT that addresses the shortage of qualified physics teachers in the US. Matt is an AP Physics teacher at Ridge High School, where he has successfully raised enrollment, diversity, and performance in the AP program. Most recently at Rutgers, Matt has been teaching a summer workshop for high school physics teachers aimed at aligning lessons with the Next Generation Science Standards, a program established by Eugenia and Amit Lath.\n\nLearn more at: https://www.aps.org/publications/apsnews/201908/blackman.cfm\n\nCongratulations Matt!\n\n(12-5-2019)\n\nGabi Kotliar has received a Carl Friedrich von Siemens Research Award of the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation. The award is given in recognition of the winner's entire body of work. It provides the opportunity to carry out a research project of their choosing with colleagues in Germany, to promote international scientific collaboration. Gabi will be hosted by Prof. Dr. Jan Delft of Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitat, Munich, Germany, where he will work collaboratively on strongly correlated electron systems.\n\nCongratulations Gabi!\n\n(12-5-2019)\n\nVitaly Podzorov and co-workers discover unusually large strain-induced anisotropic charge carrier mobility enhancement in organic semiconductors fabricated from the single crystalline organic semiconductor rubrene. This is an important step towards realizing higher peformance organic electronic devices. The work is reported in the journal Advanced Science, and featured in a recent article in Rutgers Today.\n\n(12-5-2019)\n\nHsaing-Hsi (Sean) Kung, former graduate student in Physics & Astronomy, has received the American Physical Society's 2020 Richard L. Green Dissertation Award in Experimental Condensed Matter or Materials Physics.\n\nSean, who's dissertation is entitled \"Collective excitations in the antisymmetric channel of Raman spectroscopy,\" did his Ph.D. work under the supervision of Prof. Girsh Blumberg.\n\nThis award recognized doctoral thesis research of exceptional quality and importance in experimental condensed matter or experimental materials physics. The annual award consists of a monetary prize, a certificate, and expenses to attend, give an invited talk, and accept the award at the APS March Meeting.\n\nOnce again we get to say congratulations Sean and excellent mentoring Girsh!\n\n(10-31-2019)\n\nThe American Physical Society has just announced that Gabi Kotliar, along with his long time collaborator Antoine Georges, has been awarded the 2020 Aneesur Rahman Prize for Computational Physics.\n\nThe citation reads: \"For the development of the Dynamical Mean Field Theory as a tool for the computation of properties of strongly correlated materials.\"\n\nThis prize recognizes outstanding achievement in computational physics research. The prize consists of a monetary award, an allowance for travel to the APS March Meeting at which the recipient will deliver the Rahman Lecture, and a certificate citing the contributions made by the recipient.\n\nGabi joins the ranks of our colleague David Vanderbilt who was awarded the Rahman prize in 2006.\n\nCongratulations to Gabi for yet another notable accomplishment.\n\n(10-23-2019)\n\nJed Pixley has been named a recipient of an Air Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR) Young Investigators Research Program (YIP) Award. The AFOSR made only forty YIP awards this year, in all areas of science and engineering of relevance to its mission. The YIP program makes awards to scientists and engineers at United States research institutions who received Ph.D. or equivalent degrees in the last seven years showing exceptional ability and promise for conducting basic research.\n\nYIP awardees receive a three year grant totaling $450,000.\n\nMore information about the AFOSR YIP program..\n\nMore information at the Daily Targum..\n\nCongratulations to Jed on receiving this well-deserved recognition.\n\n(10-15-2019)\n\nYuri Gershtein has been named a Senior LHC Physics Center Distinguished Researcher for 2020. Yuri is one of only three individuals to receive this honor.\n\nRead more at: https://lpc.fnal.gov/fellows/2020/Yuri_Gershtein.shtml\n\n(10-3-2019)\n\nWe are pleased to announce that three of our faculty members have been elected 2019 Fellows of the American Physical Society (APS). Moreover, these distinctions span three different Divisions of the APS, underscoring both the depth and breadth of scholarship in our department. Fellowship in the APS is a distinct honor signifying recognition by one's professional peers. Each year, < 0.5% of the Society's membership is recognized by election to the status of APS Fellow.\n\nYuri Gershtein was nominated by the Division of Particles and Fields. His citation reads: \"For important contributions to searches for physics beyond the Standard Model at both the Tevatron and the Large Hadron Collider, and for developing innovative techniques for precision photon measurement that directly contributed to the Higgs boson discovery.\"\n\nKristjan Haule was nominated by the Division of Materials Physics.
