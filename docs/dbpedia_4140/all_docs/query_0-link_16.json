Kolbï¼University of Chicagoï¼\n\nHost: Prof. WANG Yifang\n\nTime: 15:00, September 4, 2012\n\nPlace: Room C305, IHEP Main Building\n\nAbstract:\n\nNinety-five percent of the universe is missing! Astronomical observations suggest that most of the mass of the universe is in a mysterious form called dark matter and most of the energy in the universe is in an even more mysterious form called dark energy. Unlocking the secrets of dark matter and dark energy will illuminate the nature of space and time and connect the quantum with the cosmos.\n\nAbout the speaker:\n\nEdward W. Kolb, usually known as Rocky Kolb, is a cosmologist and a professor at the University of Chicago. He has worked on many aspects of the big bang cosmology, including baryogenesis, nucleosynthesis and dark matter. He is author, with Michael Turner, of the popular textbook The Early Universe (Addison-Wesley, 1990). Additionally, alongside his co-author Michael Turner, Kolb was awarded the 2010 Dannie Heineman Prize for Astrophysics."
