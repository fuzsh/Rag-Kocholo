        "text": "Bayer Leverkusen keep on making history.\n\nXabi Alonso's side have ended Bayern Munich's dominance of German football to win the Bundesliga, reached a first European final in more than two decades, and are on the longest unbeaten run since continental competition began.\n\nFollowing their last-gasp 2-2 draw with Roma, Leverkusen are 49 matches unbeaten. This surpasses the previous record of 48 set by the Eusebio-led Benfica side between December 1963 and February 1965.\n\nTheir streak was already a record for a team from one of Europe's big five leagues - the Bundesliga, Premier League, Ligue 1, La Liga and Serie A.\n\nAnd if they can keep it going for just four more games then it could see them pull off arguably one of the greatest achievements in football history - an invincible treble.\n\nWith the league title wrapped up, they could still add the German Cup and Europa League to their trophy cabinet this season.\n\n\"You can't count us out, not even for a second,\" wing-back Jeremie Frimpong told TNT Sports after the aggregate victory over Roma.\n\n\"No-one gives up. Everyone knows that if we go down, we will get a goal.\"\n\nOn 22 May, Leverkusen will face Italian side Atalanta in the Europa League final at the Aviva Stadium in Dublin.\n\nHopes are high of a first European trophy in 36 years - and of keeping their unbeaten run going.\n\n\"You see the desire from the team, we didn't want to slow down. We wanted to score the next goal to keep going unbeaten, 49 times now. We are proud of it,\" Leverkusen midfielder Granit Xhaka said.\n\n\"We have a lot of respect for Atalanta and first of all, we are happy to be in the final. We have time now to prepare and analyse, but we have some games to go still.\"\n\nAlonso's side have been extending their record run since breaking the previous elite leagues mark of 44 games - set by Juventus in May 2012 - last month.\n\nThey made it 45 games unbeaten with the 1-1 draw with Borussia Dortmund, when they needed a 97th-minute equaliser by Josip Stanisic.\n\nAnd Stanisic repeated the feat down to the minute when he cut inside from the right and scored low with his left foot to earn a 2-2 draw with Roma and send the BayArena crazy, Leverkusen fans and players alike.\n\nOf their 49 undefeated games across all competitions, Leverkusen have won 40.\n\nIt means they have surpassed the record set by the great Benfica side of the 1960s, which was previously the longest unbeaten run since continental competitions such as the European Cup - later the Champions League - were introduced.\n\nLeverkusen equalled it with a 5-1 thrashing of Eintracht Frankfurt - and now stand alone.\n\nThis has been a long campaign for Leverkusen - with the pressure to win every game increasing as the end of the season draws closer, and that almost told in the second leg against Roma.\n\nThey missed numerous chances against the Italians, who took a 2-0 lead on the night through a pair of Leandro Paredes penalties.\n\nA comical own goal by Gianluca Mancini put Leverkusen back ahead in the tie but still 2-1 behind in the second leg, and they looked set to sacrifice their unbeaten run for a place in the Europa League final.\n\nBut ultimately Leverkusen were able to have both, and double the reason for the players to streak on to the pitch and celebrate at the final whistle.\n\nLeverkusen now face Atalanta in a first European final since they lost to Real Madrid in the 2002 Champions League showpiece."
