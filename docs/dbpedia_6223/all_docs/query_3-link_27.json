Paredes scored with another spot kick in the 66th minute after Adam Hlozek's handball.\n\nWith eight minutes remaining, a Leverkusen corner confused the visiting defence, leading to Gianluca Mancini inadvertently deflecting the ball into his own net at the far post.\n\nStanisic then secured Leverkusen's place in the record books deep into stoppage time with the equaliser after a skilful move into the box.\n\nLeverkusen have already won the Bundesliga title and have reached the German Cup final.\n\nAtalanta 3-0 Marseille (4-1 on aggregate)\n\nIn the final in Dublin on May 22, Leverkusen will take on Atalanta, who eased to a 3-0 victory over Marseille for a 4-1 aggregate win.\n\nAtalanta's Ademola Lookman, Matteo Ruggeri and El Bilal Toure scored to send the Italians into their first Europa League final.\n\nLookman put Atalanta ahead in the second leg on the half-hour with a long-range strike past Pao Lopez before setting up Ruggeri to double the lead seven minutes after the break. Substitute Toure put the nail in Marseille's coffin with a goal in the 94th minute.\n\nAtalanta, who face Juventus in the Italian Cup final on Wednesday, are fifth in Serie A and have their sights set on a Champions League qualifying spot.\n\nHow to book Fury vs Usyk on Sky Sports Box Office"
