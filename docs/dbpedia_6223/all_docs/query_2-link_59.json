        "text": "Only five more days until Barça-Napoli in the Champions League, where the Catalans will seek to qualify for the quarterfinals. Five... European Cups that the club have won throughout its history: 1991/92, 2005/06, 2008/09, 2010/11 and 2014/15. This August, Barcelona fans will be hoping for a sixth but first Napoli have to be beaten on Saturday.\n\nFrom the first at Wembley to the last in Berlin. Barça - who in total have played in eight finals - have won five European Cups in the last 28 years. The first, in 1992 against Sampdoria, was the work of Johan Cruyff's 'Dream Team' and in some way made up for the defeats in Bern in 1961 and in Seville in 1986. An extra-time free-kick from Ronald Koeman changed the history of the club, and started a great stage of titles and football that still lasts today.\n\nWe had to wait 14 years until the second when, in the 2005/06 season, Frank Rijkaard's Barça would go on to beat Arsenal 2-1 in Paris thanks to goals from Eto'o and Belletti. It was the icing on the cake for a great generation of players, led by the Brazilian star Ronaldinho Gaúcho. Only three years later, a dream treble would arrive with Pep Guardiola as coach, culminating in the Champions League in Rome (2-0) with goals from Eto'o and Messi against Manchester United.\n\nIt was a legendary team that two years later would repeat their success, this time at Wembley, just like in 1992. It was a true Barça display which gave Manchester United no chance, and the final was won 3-1 with goals from its offensive trio: Pedro, Messi and Villa, Barça confirming themselves as one of the best teams in the history of football. Finally, four years later, with Luis Enrique in charge of the first team, the Catalans achieved another historic treble, beating Juventus 3-1 in the Berlin final - one that can be enjoyed on Barça TV + - with goals from Rakitic, Luis Suárez and Neymar Jr.\n\nBelow, we take a look at the 11 players who have scored in the eight Champions League finals that Barça have participated in. Did you remember them all?"
