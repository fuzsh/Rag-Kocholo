        "text": "Jose Mourinho heads into yet another European final as his storied managerial career takes another twist with Roma, who face Sevilla in the conclusion of the Europa League on Wednesday night.\n\nThe Portuguese is a two-time Champions League winner (with Porto and Inter Milan) and has also won the Europa League twice (Porto and Manchester United), so is no stranger to a European final.\n\nHe will relish the chance to disrupt Sevilla's dominance in the Europa League, with the Spanish outfit having won the competition – or its predecessor, the UEFA Cup – six times since the 2005/06 season.\n\nBut what about Roma's own history when it comes to the top European? The Sporting News looks back at the Italian club's pedigree here.\n\nMORE: Roma vs Sevilla Europa League final kickoff, TV details, lineups and more\n\nHave Roma played in or won the Champions League?\n\nYes, Roma have featured plenty in the Champions League, as well as in the days when it was called the European Cup.\n\nBack in 1983/84 they got all the way to the European Cup final, only to be beaten by Liverpool on penalties in their home stadium of the Stadio Olimpico.\n\nSince then, the Italian capital club have made semi-regular appearances at the top table of European football, reaching the Champions League group stages in 2001/02, 2002/03 and 2004/05 when the legendary Francesco Totti was a key pillar of their side.\n\nRoma got to the knockout stages in 2006/07 where they were pulled apart in an iconic 7-1 defeat to Sir Alex Ferguson's Manchester United in the quarterfinals.\n\nThe semifinals is as far as they've reached in the Champions League since it was named as such in the early 1990s, knocked out in the last four in 2017/18 by their old nemesis Liverpool over two legs – after a memorable quarterfinal win over Barcelona that year, winning the second leg 4-1 to pull off an improbable comeback.\n\nThe last time Roma competed in the Champions League was in the 2018/19 season when they reached the last 16. Since then, it's been Europe's second or third tier competitions for the Giallorossi.\n\nHave Roma ever won the Europa League?\n\nAgain, it's a no. Roma have regularly appeared in the Europa League, or UEFA Cup as it was called previously.\n\nThey got all the way to the final in the 1990/91 season, but were beaten in a two-legged final by Serie A rivals Inter Milan 3-0 on aggregate.\n\nTheir best return since the competition was renamed the Europa League from 2010 – until this year – was reaching the semifinals in 2020/21 when they were well beaten by Manchester United 8-5 on aggregate.\n\nMORE: How many times have Sevilla won the Europa League?\n\nRoma's history in European cup competitions\n\nRoma had six seasons in the old Cup Winners' Cup, from 1969 to 1991. They also won the inaugral Europa Conference League last season (2021/22) under Mourinho's stewardship – in what was their first piece of European silverware since the 1960/61 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup.\n\nDomestically, Roma have won three Serie A titles, nine Coppa Italias and have twice won the Suppercoppa Italia.\n\nRoma vs Sevilla kickoff time, match details\n\nThe 2023 UEFA Europa League final between Roma and Sevilla will be played on Wednesday, May 31 at the Puskas Arena in Budapest, Hungary.\n\nThe game will kick off at 8 p.m. BST in the UK, which translates as 3 p.m. ET in the USA and Canada, and 5 a.m. AEST in Australia (the following day).\n\nCountry Date Projected\n\nTime USA Wed, May 31 3 p.m. ET UK Wed, May 31 8 p.m. BST Canada Wed, May 31 3 p.m. EDT Australia Thu, June 1 5 a.m. AEST India Thu, June 1 12:30 a.m. IST Hong Kong Thu, June 1 3 a.m. HKT Malaysia Thu, June 1 3 a.m. MYT New Zealand Thu, June 1 7 a.m. NZST Singapore Thu, June 1 3 a.m. SST\n\nMORE: Europa League prize money 2023\n\nHow to watch Europa League final, live stream, TV details\n\nTV channel Streaming USA CBS, TUDN, Unimas Paramount+, ViX+, Univision Now, TUDN App/website, Fubo Canada — DAZN UK BT Sport Ultimate, BT Sport 1 BT Sport site/app Australia — Stan Sport India Sony Ten 2 JioTV, Sony LIV Hong Kong beIN Sports 3 beIN Sports Connect Malaysia beIN Sports 3 beIN Sports Connect,\n\nsooka New Zealand — Spark Sport Singapore beIN Sports 3 beIN Sports Connect,\n\nStarHubTV+\n\nUSA: This match will televised on CBS (English), TUDN and Unimas (Spanish), and those channels can be streamed on Fubo.
