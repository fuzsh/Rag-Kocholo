        "text": "The European Golden Shoe (also commonly known as the Golden Boot) is an award presented to the leading goalscorer from the top divisions of the European national leagues.\n\nHistory\n\nBetween 1968 and 1991, the award was given by L'Ãquipe to the highest goalscorer in any European league. Between 1991 and 1996 there were no official awards given to the top goal scorers, but the leading goalscorer for those years have since been recognized. Since the 1996â97 season, the award, given by European Sports Media, has used a weighted points system.\n\nPoint System\n\nThe winner is not simply the player with the most goals in the season. There is a weighting system where the goals scored in the top-ranked leagues are worth more. Players from the five highest ranked leagues according to UEFA (based on results of each league's clubs in European competition over the previous five seasons) get 2 points per scored goal, leagues ranked 6-22 get 1.5 points per goal and the remaining leagues get 1 point per goal. The top five ranked leagues in 2022 were Germany, Spain, England, Italy, and France. The winners usually come from the top-ranked leagues.\n\nRelated Pages"
