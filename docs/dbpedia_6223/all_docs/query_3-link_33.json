        "text": "The first step in a long history driven by speed and performance is marked by brothers Rudolf and Adolf Dassler who founded the company “Gebrüder Dassler Schuhfabrik” (Dassler Brothers Shoe Factory) in their hometown Herzogenaurach, Germany. In doing so, the world capital of sport shoes is born.\n\nThe brothers start their factory in their parents’ home in 1919, moving into a proper facility in 1924. While there were other, smaller factories scattered throughout the town, many did not manage to survive past the 1950s and 60s.\n\nIn 1954, the first world record is held by a pair of PUMA running shoes. Heinz Fütterer matches the 100m world record in Yokohama, Japan with an amazing time of 10.2 seconds. In true PUMA Athlete fashion, he adds to the success four years later when he sets the world record in the 4x100m relay. This is a huge achievement for the young company.\n\nPortuguese striker sensation and Ballon d'Or winner Eusébio is named top scorer in the 1966 World Cup in England while wearing PUMA football boots.\n\nHonouring this accomplishment and Eusébio's continued fantastic form, PUMA introduces the legendary PUMA KING football boot in 1966.\n\nIn 1967, the puma takes its first leap across the upper right corner of the PUMA word logo as the world famous “No. 1 Logo” is created. Only minor changes have been made over the years: today, the eye and nuzzle are gone and the ears are more pronounced.\n\nGRAND SLAM\n\nPUMA’s tennis roster continues to grow. Martina Navrátilová, the most successful player of her time, establishes a record of 167 singles and 177 doubles tournaments titles. Among these wins, she achieves an Open Era record of 59 major titles won by a single player, and accomplishes a \"Grand Slam Boxed Set\" (Career Grand Slam in singles, doubles and mixed doubles) as she is the only player to hold the top spot in singles and doubles for over 200 weeks. Together with Guillermo Vilas and Boris Becker, the trio help PUMA to become one of the most popular brands in tennis.\n\nYO SOY UN PUMA\n\nDiego Armando Maradona goes down in history with his second goal against England in the quarter finals of the 1986 World Cup in Mexico. Starting from his own half, he passes six players including the goalkeeper, touches the ball eleven times with his PUMA KINGs and scores the \"Goal of the Century\".\n\nDETERMINED CONFIDENCE\n\nJochen Zeitz is appointed CEO at the age of 30, becoming the youngest chairman in German history to lead a public company. During financial difficulties, Zeitz spearheads PUMA’s reconstruction and manages to turn it from a low-price brand into a premium sport-lifestyle company that is one of the top three brands in the sporting goods industry today.\n\nEYES OF A CAT\n\nIn a press conference prior to the 1996 Summer Olympic Games in Atlanta, Linford Christie proves he is a true PUMA Athlete. Wearing contact lenses that overlay his pupils with the PUMA cat, he displays his spirit for all to see. The picture of Christie wearing the PUMA lenses spreads rapidly and is world famous ever since.\n\nSPEEDING UP FASHION\n\nThe PUMA SPEEDCAT represents our long-standing connection to motorsports. Its design originated in 1998, when the fireproof version was created for Formula One drivers. Its innovative and elegant low-profile look and characteristically stitched cat logo, quickly turns the SPEEDCAT into a fashion classic.\n\nSince then, PUMA has established as one of the top suppliers for racing gear and merchandise in Formula One.\n\nWORLD CHAMPION ITALY\n\nAt the Football World Cup in Germany, PUMA sponsors more than any other supplier with 13 out of 32 teams. For the first time in the company’s history, a PUMA-sponsored team becomes the world champion as Italy beats France 5:3 after a penalty shoot-out. Wearing his trustworthy PUMA gloves, Italy’s goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon wins the Yashin-Award for “Best Goalkeeper of the Tournament”.\n\nCHALLENGE CONVENTION\n\nPUMA and artist Rihanna join forces as she becomes PUMA Women’s Creative Director and Ambassador.\n\nRihanna’s first collaboration with PUMA is an instant classic. Taking inspiration from the creeper sneaker silhouette that was popular in the punk era, the PUMA SUEDE is recreated with an extra thick sole and the PUMA CREEPER is born.\n\nBACK TO THE HOOPS\n\nAfter its absence for almost two decades, PUMA reintroduces the basketball category to its business portfolio. PUMA approaches basketball through a cultural lens by appointing entertainment and cultural icon Shawn Carter, better known as Jay-Z, as Creative Director for Basketball. Together, they place emphasis on how fashion, art and music elevate the world of basketball. PUMA presents its very first basketball silhouette after almost 20 years with the CLYDE COURT DISRUPT, paying homage to the original CLYDE.\n\nBRAND CAMPAIGNS\n\nPUMA launches SHE MOVES US, a communications platform where it celebrates women who move together to achieve and connect through sport, culture and values. Global superstar Dua Lipa and supermodel Winnie Harlow lead the campaign alongside several female athletes.\n\nPUMA takes consumers into the minds of its athletes and ambassadors to spread a vision of hope, optimism and self-belief with its campaign ONLY SEE GREAT. Cultural icon, entrepreneur and philanthropist Jay-Z inspired the campaign with his words: “I only see great. I don’t see good. I don’t see compromise. We should always strive to make something great, something that will last.\"\n\nPUMA75\n\nOver the last 75 years, PUMA has pushed sport and culture forward by creating fast products for the world’s fastest athletes. This year, PUMA celebrates 75 years of history in sports, culture and innovation with a series of events throughout the year which elaborate on its \"FOREVER. FASTER.\" mantra."
