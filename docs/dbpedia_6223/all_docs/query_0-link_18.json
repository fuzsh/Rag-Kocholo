        "text": "The UEFA Europa League final in Budapest won’t simply provide the opportunity to lift international silverware for Italian side Roma, who last night knocked out Germany’s Bayer Leverkusen in a hard-fought semifinal return leg.\n\nHoisting this prestigious trophy would also allow the Gialorossi to secure a spot in next year’s UEFA Champions League, the world’s most lucrative club soccer tournament.\n\nLast night, both UEFA Europa League semifinals were packed with drama.\n\nAt Ramón Sánchez Pizjuán Stadium, Sevilla and Juventus offered a very entertaining first half, featuring clear goal-scoring opportunities on both ends. The Bianconeri probably had the biggest chance with 2022 FIFA World Cup champion Angel Di Maria, who surprisingly missed the target from close range with an outside foot effort.\n\nSubstitute Dusan Vlahovic finally broke the deadlock in the 65th minute, just a few seconds after he stepped on the pitch. The Serbia international showcased all his composure in front of goal when he beat Sevilla’s goalkeeper with a gentle, left-footed chip that gave his side the 1-0 lead.\n\nSupported by 40,000 loud fans, Sevilla immediately found the strength to come back from the disadvantage. The Spanish side took six minutes to equalize the score, courtesy of former AC Milan attacking midfielder Suso, who fired from distance into the top-left corner.\n\nIn what remained a very balanced match throughout all 90 minutes, the tie was eventually broken in extra time. An Erik Lamela’s header, which was too carefully placed to be within Juventus goalkeeper Wojciech Szczęsny’s reach, was enough to hand Sevilla a ticket to their fifth UEFA Europa League final in 10 years.\n\nRoma, who started on a 1-0 aggregate following a goal in the first leg by Italian youngster Edoardo Bove, traveled to Germany knowing that a tie against Bayer Leverkusen would suffice.\n\nThe Giallorossi lined up in a very organized 3-5-2 system, channeling their energy on containing the opponent’s attacks rather than bringing numbers forward.\n\nAcross the two halves, Jose Mourinho’s men conceded a total of 23 shots to Xabi Alonso’s side, but they never lost composure and diligently stuck to their defensive game plan until the final whistle.\n\nTheir efforts eventually paid off: After nine, seemingly eternal minutes of added time, the Roma players could finally scream in joy for having clinched their second European final in two years and their first UEFA Europa League final since 1991.\n\nRoma are aware that lifting this piece of European silverware wouldn’t just come with sporting gratification. It would also guarantee access to next year’s UEFA Champions League, the biggest money-making tournament for soccer clubs but also for players, whose contracts often feature lucrative bonus clauses that get triggered upon accomplishing this goal.\n\nReserving a spot in the UEFA Champions League has proven particularly challenging this year for Serie A clubs, as six of them are fiercely fighting for three available slots with only three league rounds to spare.\n\nFeaturing in Europe’s most remunerative soccer tournament generates a minimum of €50 million in UEFA’s prize money distribution across participation and performance bonuses, market pool and coefficient-based amounts.\n\nConsidering that Roma’s financial statement reported €162 million in total revenue in 2022, this kind of proceeds from UEFA would account for a significant chunk of their income. It would also positively impact the club’s ability to sign new players in the transfer window and grant contract extensions to the most deserving footballers on their roster.\n\nOn May 31, Roma are scheduled to take the field against Sevilla at Budapest's Puskás Aréna, but there is already great anticipation in Rome among the Giallorossi fans.\n\nJose Mourinho’s men are ready to battle it out in a game that will define their current season as well as shape the fate of the upcoming one."
