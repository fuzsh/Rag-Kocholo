        "text": "Sevilla have won the Europa League final, beating Roma 4-1 on penalties following a 1-1 draw after extra time.\n\nGonzalo Montiel initially missed his deciding penalty to win it for the La Liga side, but VAR spotted encroachment by Roma's keeper and the Argentine — who also scored the winning penalty in the World Cup final — sent Rui Patricio the wrong way on his second attempt to clinch the title.\n\nThe victory extends Sevilla’s Europa League record as they lift the trophy for a seventh time. In addition to winning the competition, they have also secured qualification for next season’s Champions League.\n\nDespite Jose Mourinho claiming Paulo Dybala was only fit enough to play \"20 or 30 minutes\" yesterday, Sky Italia's Angelo Mangiante reports there is \"growing optimism\" the World Cup winner will make his first start since April 13.\n\nIf Dybala is not able to start, Stephan El Shaarawy is the most likely candidate to take his place in the team.\n\nBut Mourinho always has something up his sleeve...\n\n(All photos by Getty Images)\n\nYassine Bounou, better known as Bono, started the season as the first-choice goalkeeper in league matches, while Marko Dmitrovic was preferred for most cup games.\n\nSince Mendilibar was appointed they have swapped over, with the Serbian preferred in La Liga despite Bono being one of the best goalkeepers at the 2022 World Cup and impressing when selected by the new manager.\n\nHowever, Bono made his first domestic start under Mendilibar in the most recent league game, a 2-1 loss to Real Madrid as Sevilla rotated heavily, perhaps with an eye on today.\n\nWas that start compensation for being benched for Dmitrovic today? Or was Mendilibar trying to keep his cup keeper fresh?\n\n(All photos by Getty Images)\n\nWhen Jose Mourinho reached 1,000 career matches as a manager in 2021, he joined a short list of men who have achieved the same in the post-war era. Even more impressive, his win percentage at the time of 63.8 was best among all managers in that elite group.\n\nThe Athletic took a deep dive into the Portuguese manager's career, which has taken him to Benfica, Uniao de Leiria, Porto, Chelsea twice, Inter Milan, Real Madrid, Manchester United, Tottenham and now Roma.\n\nPutting Mourinho’s results, teams and players under the microscope over the course of 1,000 games, there was a lot to learn. Check out the full story at the link below.\n\nAs Bayer Leverkusen found out in the semi-finals, there are few things more painful in this world than trying to come back against a Jose Mourinho side.\n\nRoma took a 1-0 win at home in the first leg, setting up for the most frustrating of games as Leverkusen chased an equaliser at home in the return leg.\n\nFew can describe the frustration of playing against a Mourinho side better than The Athletic's Raphael Honigstein:\n\nBy the final whistle, Bayer Leverkusen’s players simply could not take any more. Jeremie Frimpong and Moussa Diaby repeatedly harangued referee Slavko Vincic, who needed to be shielded by stewards with umbrellas on his way into the tunnel.\n\nVincic had booked Xabi Alonso for dissent moments before. Earlier on, Bayer’s head coach had been forced to take off wing-back Mitchel Bakker for his own protection.\n\nThe Dutchman had lost his head and smashed a ball into the advertising board, a lapse of control that earned him a caution and a substitution shortly after. Five more of his team-mates found their way into the referee’s book, three of them in injury time.\n\nThey had all been Mourinho-ed: expertly driven to distraction by the Roma manager’s dark arts. Darth Jose’s disciples were slowing down and stopping the game at any given opportunity until time itself seemed to stand still in Leverkusen and the hosts had gone quite mad from all the pent-up energy.\n\n(All photos by Getty Images)\n\nSome people said Jose Mourinho was past it. His career seemed to be petering out after his departure from Tottenham in 2021.\n\nBut they were wrong.\n\nThe Portuguese manager has been revitalised during his time in the Italian capital.\n\nJames Horncastle has the full story at the link below, touching on Roma fans' disbelief that he is their coach. Mourinho departed Serie A as an unprecedented treble-winner in 2010. In the meantime, no one lifted a European trophy with an Italian club until his return last season.\n\n(All photos by Getty Images)\n\nSevilla were two points off the drop with a very credible chance of dropping into the relegation places, now they sit 10 points clear and in a European final.\n\nAfter a mixed start, beating Sevilla but collapsing late to concede two and draw against Celta Vigo, Mendilibar's side travelled to Manchester for a game that would change their season.\n\nHaving fallen 2-0 down within 21 minutes, Sevilla came out a different team in the second half as United regressed, grabbing a draw in injury time before defeating relegation rivals Valencia, starting. a run of four straight wins.\n\nNow 15 games into his reign, Sevilla have a record of 8-5-2 (1.93 ppg) and despite only being contracted to the end of the season, several players including Ivan Rakitic have spoken of their desire to see his contract extended.\n\nWill his future depend on success tonight?\n\n(All photos by Getty Images)\n\nWith two managerial sackings, a dispute over the presidency and a relegation fight... it hasn't been smooth sailing in Sevilla this season.\n\nJorge Sampaoli came in initially to get the season back on track but the polarising Argentinian failed to have as positive an impact as he did in his first spell in 2016-17.\n\nSampaoli is known to be a very attacking and tactical manager but couldn't get results from his low confidence side with Ivan Rakitic stating \"a lot of bad things happened\" and Rafa Mir stating \"he did things that made a footballer feel out of place\".\n\nWhen Mendilibar came in Sevilla were two points outside the relegation zone and many felt the survival specialist was the wrong choice, having been relegated with Eibar and Alaves in the previous two seasons.\n\n(All photos by Getty Images)\n\nMendilibar, especially during his time with Eibar, gained a reputation as a survival specialist whose teams are greater than the sum of their parts. However, the Sevilla manager believes many people understate his talents as a tactical coach.\n\n\"People paint me as a 4-4-2 coach, a coach who likes a direct style of play, who plays a lot in the opposition box, but I want intelligent players,\" said Mendilibar.\n\n\"I want players who know how to play in between the opposition when defending, not one-on-one. I don’t like duels. I like to anticipate duels. I don’t want them to run just for the sake of running. I prefer players who appear all of a sudden and win the ball without having to make a big effort.\"\n\nMendilibar is known for wanting his teams primarily to be hard to beat, but has played a 4-2-3-1 during his time in Andalusia with Gudelj and Fernando sitting deep with Rakitic ahead.\n\n(All photos by Getty Images)\n\n\"Like a dickhead,\" was Jose Luis Mendilibar's response when asked how he feels to be getting more credit now as manager of Sevilla.\n\n\"I have been in the first division for 20 years and it's as if no one knew me... What I did in Eibar is much the same as what I am doing in Sevilla,\" he continued.\n\nAs a player Mendilibar had a fairly unremarkable career, playing primarily with Sestao in the Segunda Division and never reaching La Liga as a player.\n\nThe well-travelled manager spent the majority of his early coaching career at youth and feeder teams of Athletic Bilbao. He briefly managed the senior team in 2005 but only lasted 13 games at the Basque team.\n\nIt was at Eibar — in his second spell between 2015 and 2021 — where he carved out his reputation as a survival specialist, guiding the side with the lowest budget to five seasons of La Liga survival until eventual relegation in 2021.\n\nMendilibar's most recent role before Sevilla saw him leading Deportivo Alaves last season. However, he lasted just 12 games with the club, winning only once as the team was ultimately relegated at the end of the season.\n\n(All photos by Getty Images)\n\nAn Englishman playing regular minutes in Italy isn't the most common sight, and yet Roma have two among their leading players.\n\nBoth players struggled to truly establish themselves in the Premier League but have really made a name for themselves in Serie A.\n\nChris Smalling ranks fourth on the team among outfield players in terms of minutes played in all competitions this season.\n\nTammy Abraham isn't far behind him, and leads all forwards in that stat.\n\nSmalling has been a key component of Roma's fourth-ranked defence, while Abraham is tied for second on the team with 17 goal involvements (nine goals, eight assists) in all competitions.\n\n(All photos by Getty Images)\n\nAs you might expect from a Jose Mourinho side, Roma haven't exactly lit up the scoresheet this season. Their 49 goals scored in Serie A are tied for ninth most and are less than two-thirds of Napoli's tally of 75.\n\nAcross all competitions, Paulo Dybala is Roma's only player to have reached double digits in goals, with 16.\n\nThe trio of Tammy Abraham (9), Stephan El Shaarawy (9) and Lorenzo Pellegrini (8) round of the rest of the players who reached at least five goals in all competitions, a rather short list.\n\nJust two years ago, Roma scored 68 goals in Serie A and had five goalscorers reach double digits across all competitions. Restoring that kind of scoring depth would go a long way towards helping them compete at the top end of the league.\n\nRoma's 2022-23 season in Serie A has been characterised by a struggle to get positive results against the other top teams in Italy.\n\nIn 12 matches against the six other sides that comprise Serie A's top seven — Napoli, Lazio, Inter, AC Milan, Atalanta and Juventus — Roma have suffered seven losses alongside just two wins. They have been outscored nine to 16 in these matches as well.\n\nWorst of all, they failed completely in their two fixtures against Lazio, letting their intra-city rival get the best of them in a pair of 1-0 defeats home and away.\n\nIt is these results more than any others that have left Roma in sixth place with one league match remaining. Their only path into next season's Champions League is by winning today's final.\n\n(All photos by Getty Images)\n\nSevilla may have reached yet another Europa League final this season, but they remain a club in deep turmoil.\n\nFlirting with relegation was certainly not in the club's plans for this season.\n\nOur reporter Dermot Corrigan dug into what is ailing Sevilla behind the scenes, discovering a power battle in the boardroom, seeing the effects of a failed recruitment policy, and exploring the uncertain future of their influential sporting director Monchi.\n\nCheck out his full report at the link below to learn more.\n\nJose Luis Mendilibar became Sevilla's third manager of the season on March 21. He immediately made an impression on the team's performances in La Liga, leading them to four wins and a draw in his first five league matches.\n\nHe kept the Europa League machine churning as well, as Sevilla rallied to defeat Manchester United in the quarter-finals before enduring a tense semi-final against Juventus to reach today. Given Sevilla's success in the competition under multiple managers this year, and all the past success they've enjoyed in it too, it almost doesn't seem to matter who their manager is!\n\nSevilla's league results have dipped as of late, with the team winless in their last three matches, but safety from relegation was secured long ago and the club is set for a mid-table finish with one league match remaining."
