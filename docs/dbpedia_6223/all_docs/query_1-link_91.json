        "text": "Exactly 20 years ago today, on November 19, 1991, Manchester United met European champions Red Star Belgrade in the European Super Cup and claimed their one and only victory in the competition.\n\nDespite being a much derided trophy, this was a chance for Alex Ferguson's rapidly-improving Red Devils to take on a great European side.\n\nEnglish clubs had only returned to European competition the season before, following the ban imposed after the 1985 Heysel Stadium disaster, and United had claimed the European Cup Winners' Cup with victory over Barcelona earlier in 1991.\n\nThat was the club's second trophy under the Scot, keeping the ball rolling from the 1990 FA Cup win against Crystal Palace, and in the 1991/92 season the Red Devils were mounting a serious challenge for the First Division title, aiming to end a 25-year wait for the championship.\n\nMeanwhile, Red Star Belgrade had recently become the second Eastern European team - after Steaua Bucharest in 1986 - to win the European Cup, beating big spending Marseille in the final.\n\nYugoslavian football was particularly strong at that moment and Red Star could boast talent including Vladimir Jugovic, who scored the winner for Juventus in the 1996 Champions League final, Sinisa Mihajlovic, who won two Serie A titles with Inter and Lazio, and European Golden Boot winner Darko Pancev.\n\nIn those days the European champions faced the Cup Winners' Cup holders in a two-legged Super Cup final, but due to the outbreak of civil war in Yugoslavia, the contest was reduced to a one-off match at Old Trafford.\n\nRed Star's Dejan Savicevic - who went on to destroy Barcelona in the 1994 Champions League final for AC Milan - was the star of the show, but as was so often the case Fergie emerged triumphant, thanks to a Brian McClair winner.\n\nUnfortunately for United, they failed to land the First Division title that season, being pipped by Leeds in the home straight, but kept the trophy count ticking over by adding a first League Cup with victory over Nottingham Forest."
