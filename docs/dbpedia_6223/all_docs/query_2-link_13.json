        "text": "The most-awaited event in club football—the UEFA Champions League final—is mere days away, with record-winners Real Madrid taking on Borussia Dortmund for a shot at their fifteenth UCL trophy. Meanwhile, Dortmund’s ascension to the final, perhaps a bit unexpected, gives the Germans a shot at their second UCL trophy in history.\n\nIn view of the upcoming final, we take a look at the winners of the UCL over the years, on a country-wise basis.\n\nSpanish heavyweights Real Madrid and FC Barcelona are the only two teams to have won the Champions League from Spain but their dominance in the competition puts them head and shoulders above the rest.\n\nFC Barcelona have won the title 5 times in their history, most recently in 2015 whereas serial winners Real Madrid have finished their season with the Champions League trophy a remarkable 14 times. A treble between 2016 and 2018 and winning 5 in a row from 1956 to 1960 helped The Los Blancos achieve the most success in the competition. In this year’s finals as well, Real Madrid will look to add one more to their already stuffed trophy cabinet.\n\nThe United Kingdom, collectively, has 16 UCL titles spread across multiple teams, mostly from England.\n\nLiverpool reign supreme with 6 Champions League titles to their name, followed by Manchester United (3), Nottingham Forest and Chelsea with two each, Aston Villa and most recently Manchester City in 2023.\n\nScotland is the only other country apart from England in the UK to have produced a Champions League winning side, namely the famed Celtic side of 1967.\n\nItalian giants AC Milan have a rich history in the tournament and are familiar with the taste of success, winning the title seven times in their history. Arch-rivals Inter are a distant second with three titles. Juventus are the only other side in Italy to win the UCL: despite making it to the final nine times, the Bianconeri could only manage wins on two occasions.\n\nGermany’s most successful team Bayern Munich is also the nation’s most successful team in the Champions League with six titles to their name, with their most recent win coming in 2020.\n\nTheir Der Klassiker rivals Borussia Dortmund have won a singular title in their history back in 1997 but have a chance to add to their tally if they can overcome Real Madrid in the 2024 Champions League final.\n\nSecond division team Hamburger SV had their hands on the trophy in 1983.\n\nThe Dutch have produced some fantastic teams over the last few years, with the most recent being the fantastic Ajax side of 2019 that made it to the UCL semifinal, only to bow down to Real Madrid.\n\nAlthough Ajax couldn’t win that season, they have won the competition four times in their history. Rivals Feyenoord and PSV Eindhoven have one title each to their name.\n\nFC Porto and Benfica, two of the three biggest teams in Portugal, are the only Portuguese teams to have won the competition. The most recent winner of them is FC Porto and their famously- led Jose Mourinho side of 2004, where they won in the most unexpected finals match-up between them and AS Monaco.\n\nEuropean powerhouses France have only produced one team to have won Europe’s most sought-after trophy and that team was Olympique Marseille back in 1993. The two other French clubs to have reached the finals, PSG and Monaco lost their respective matches, giving France only one Champions League title to be proud of.\n\nThe biggest club in Romania, Fotbal Club FCSB, formerly known as FC Steaua București, have made Romania proud on the biggest stage once in 1986, denying Spain’s FC Barcelona to become the only other team apart from Real Madrid to win the European Cup at that time.\n\nThe former nation of Yugoslavia produced the Red Star Belgrade side which beat Olympique Marseille in 1991 to become the only team to win the European Cup and Intercontinental Cup. Red Star Belgrade now plays in the Serbian League where they have become the most successful Serbian football club.\n\nThe countdown has already begun for the 69th UEFA Champions League final in which Champions League giants Real Madrid, who last faced a UCL final defeat in 1981 and have remained unbeaten since, face Borussia Dortmund, who will want to be on the winning side this time around after losing the title to rivals Bayern Munich in 2013.\n\nMarco Reus, the embodiment of loyalty and a Dortmund legend, who plays his final game for the club against Real Madrid, will want to leave a lasting legacy. Real Madrid, meanwhile, will want to add to their already stacked trophy cabinet and leave the pack behind, eyeing a record 15th title."
