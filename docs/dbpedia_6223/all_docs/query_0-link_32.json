        "text": "AC Milan are in the capital tonight to face AS Roma in the second leg of their Europa League quarter-final hoping to engineer a comeback after the defeat at San Siro.\n\nGianluca Mancini’s first half header was enough for Roma to emerge victorious in the first leg and give Daniele De Rossi’s men something to defend, but Milan will not give up on their European dream easily.\n\nYou can read the latest team news and some opposition insight in our pre-match preview, while below are the best stats ahead of the game.\n\n➤ Roma have lost three of their last four home games against Milan in all competitions (D1), more than they had in their previous 16 against them (W7 D7 L2).\n\n➤ Milan have already won 2-1 at Roma in Serie A this season – the last team to win two away games against them in the same campaign were Fiorentina in 2014-15.\n\n➤ This is Roma’s third home game in European competition against a fellow Italian side – they beat Internazionale 1-0 in the 1991 UEFA Cup final second leg, and lost 3-0 to Fiorentina in the 2014-15 UEFA Europa League round of 16.\n\n➤ Milan have only lost one of their six European away games against fellow Italian sides (W2 D3), though it did come in their most recent such match against Internazionale in last season’s UEFA Champions League.\n\n➤ After their 1-0 win in the first leg, Roma are looking to win both legs of a major European competition knockout tie for the first time since the 2020-21 UEFA Europa League last 16 vs Shakhtar Donetsk, while they have never previously done so against a fellow Italian side.\n\n➤ Milan have been eliminated from each of the last eight occasions they have lost at home in the first leg of a two-legged knockout tie in major European competitions, last progressing in the inaugural 1955-56 European Cup first round against 1. FC Saarbrücken after losing the first leg 3-4 (7-5 on aggregate).\n\n➤ Milan had 25 shots in the first leg against Roma without scoring, the second time this season they have had so many without scoring in a European fixture (also 25 v Newcastle in the Champions League in September). Before this season, they last had 25+ shots in a game in major European competition without scoring in October 2005 v PSV in the UEFA Champions League (27).\n\n➤ Gianluca Mancini scored Roma’s winner in the first leg against Milan, while the last player to score in both legs of the same two-legged knockout tie for the club in major European competition was Edin Dzeko vs Manchester United in the 2020-21 UEFA Europa League semi-finals."
