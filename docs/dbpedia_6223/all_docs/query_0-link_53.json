        "text": "The 2023 Europa League final saw Sevilla beat Jose Mourinho's Roma on penalties in Budapest, Hungary.\n\nMourinho's side at the time were UEFA Conference League champions and were looking to become the UEFA Europa League winners for the first time in their history. But there was one thing that stood in their way, Sevilla.\n\nSevillistas Los Rojiblancos came into the 2023 final as underdogs because of their form, but anyone who knows what the Spanish outfit are capable of in this competition will have backed them.\n\nHere, The Sporting News recalls how they overcame Roma in the 2023 UEFA Europa League final.\n\nMORE: Europa League 2024 final betting odds for Bayer Leverkusen vs. Atalanta\n\nWho won the 2023 Europa League final?\n\nSevilla beat Roma 4–1 in a penalty shootout to lift the 2023 UEFA Europa League title after the game ended 1–1 following extra time.\n\nThe LaLiga side claimed their seventh Europa League trophy, the most of any side in the history of the competition.\n\nFor Mourinho, it was a painful night, as he suffered his first defeat in a European final. In contrast, Sevilla's Jose Luis Mendilibar, only three months into his role as coach, celebrated his first European title.\n\nFollowing the medal ceremony, a dejected Mourinho handed his runner-up medal to a fan. The Portuguese boss then waited in a parking lot for referee Anthony Taylor and shouted at him that he was a 'f****** disgrace', because the English official had not awarded his Serie A club a penalty.\n\nThe Premier League referee handed out 13 yellow cards on the night, setting a record for a European final, and also booked several members of the Roma bench, including Mourinho.\n\nWho has won the most Europa League titles?\n\nNo side has won more Europa League titles than Sevilla with seven.\n\nThe Europa League has been dominated by the Spanish side, who have never lost a Europa League final.\n\nAfter Sevilla, four teams have won the competition on three occasions: Inter Milan, Liverpool, Juventus and Atletico Madrid.\n\nClubWinnersYears wonSevilla72006, 2007, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2020, 2023Inter Milan31991, 1994, 1998Liverpool31973, 1976, 2001Juventus31977, 1990, 1993Atlético Madrid32010, 2012, 2018Borussia Monchengladbach21975, 1979Tottenham Hotspur21972, 1984Feyenoord21974, 2002Eintracht Frankfurt21980, 2022IFK Gothenburg21982, 1987Real Madrid21985, 1986Parma21995, 1999Porto22003, 2011Chelsea22013, 2019Anderlecht11983Ajax11992Manchester United12017PSV Eindhoven11978Ipswich Town11981Bayer Leverkusen11988Napoli11989Bayern Munich11996Schalke 0411997Galatasaray12000Valencia12004CSKA Moscow12005Zenit Saint Petersburg12008Shakhtar Donetsk12009Villarreal12021"
