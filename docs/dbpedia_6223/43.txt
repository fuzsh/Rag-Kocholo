On the 8th May 1991, the San Siro Stadium in Milan, Italy, hosted the first leg of the UEFA Cup final which pitted two formidable Serie A teams against each other in the form of Inter Milan and AS Roma. The stage was set for an epic battle that would determine the champion of one of Europe’s leading club cup competitions.

Inter Milan, led by their charismatic manager Giovanni Trapattoni, boasted a star-studded line-up featuring the German trio of Lothar Matthäus, Andreas Brehme, and Jurgen Klinsmann supported by the home grown talents of Walter Zenga, Nicola Berti and Giuseppe Bergomi. On the other side, AS Roma, under the guidance of coach Ottavio Bianchi, counted on the talents of players such as Giuseppe Giannini, Aldair, and Rudi Völler.

From the opening whistle, the intensity was palpable as both teams showcased their skill and determination. Inter Milan drew first blood with a goal from midfield maestro Matthäus, sending the Nerazzurri faithful into a frenzy just after half-time from the penalty spot. The men from Milan doubled the lead shortly after thanks to another goal from midfield partner Nicola Berti which gave Internazionale a comfortable first leg lead.

The second leg at Stadio Olimpico in front of 70k Romans was a tense affair and AS Roma managed to secure a 1-0 victory courtesy of a goal from striker Rizzitelli but Inter’s defence held firm, denying their opponents any further opportunities. The victory in the second leg was not enough to overturn the deficit from the first leg, resulting in Inter Milan winning the UEFA Cup title with a 2-1 aggregate score.
