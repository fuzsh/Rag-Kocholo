The UEFA Europa Conference League 2021-22 final will see AS Roma and Feyenoord battle for the top prize at the Arena Kombëtare in Tirana, Albania on Thursday, May 26. The match begins at 12:30 AM IST (Indian Standard Time).

Jose Mourinho’s Roma have reached the final of a European competition for the first time since the 1991 UEFA Cup, where they lost by a 1-2 aggregate to Inter Milan.

After being held to a 1-1 draw in the first leg, Tammy Abraham’s 11th-minute strike in the second leg fixture at the Stadio Olimpico guided Roma to an eventual match-winning 2-1 aggregate against Leicester City.

Dutch giants Feyenoord, meanwhile, denied Marseille a chance to overturn a 2-3 first leg deficit as the teams played out a 0-0 draw in the second leg of their semi-final meeting.

The UEFA Europa Conference League 2021-22 final is the inaugural championship match of Europe’s third-tier club competition. The winner will receive a cash prize of five million euros.

Victory in the 2021-22 UECL final will be a historic moment for either party. For Mourinho, winning the UEFA Europa Conference League will make him the first manager to win all three major UEFA club competitions (UEFA Champions League, 2x UEFA Europa League).

As for Feyenoord, the Dutch team are on the verge of becoming the first club to win all current major UEFA club competition trophies. They have won the European Cup/Champions League once and the UEFA Cup/Europa League twice.
