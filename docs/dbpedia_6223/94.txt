The 1991–92 UEFA Cup was the 21st season of Europe's then-tertiary club football tournament organised by UEFA. The final was played over two legs at Stadio Delle Alpi, Turin, Italy, and at Olympisch Stadion, Amsterdam, Netherlands. The competition was won by Dutch club Ajax, who defeated Torino of Italy on away goals after an aggregate result of 2–2 to claim their first UEFA Cup title.

The victory made Ajax only the second team – after Torino's city rivals Juventus – to have won all three major European trophies (European Cup/UEFA Champions League, UEFA Cup/UEFA Europa League, and the Cup Winners' Cup). As the only English team in the tournament due to the aftermath of the 5-year ban for the Heysel disaster, and having been excluded for an additional year, Liverpool made its comeback to international competition for the first time since the 1985 European Cup final that sparked the ban.
