        "text": "I only managed one movie last night.. it was only nearly 3 hours long!\n\nDER UNTERGANG – DOWNFALL\n\n(Biography, Drama, 2004) (15) D: Oliver Hirschbiegel W: Bernd Eichinger S:Ulrich Matthes, Bruno Ganz, Christian Berkel, Tomas Kretschmann. 2h 36m. GER\n\nTAGLINE : April 1945, a nation awaits its…\n\nTraudl Junge, the final secretary for Hitler tells of the Nazi dictators final days in his Berlin bunker at the end of WWII.\n\nThe final days of hitler.. whoo! What a pleasure to watch. Or is it? I’m not sure if the movie was trying to portray the homicidal f*ckwit as a fragile old man with 99 problems but he does come across as paranoid and feeling desperately abandoned. It’s enjoyable to see the downfall of a tyrant but it was never going to be a fun movie to watch, tons of suicides, killing off of the kiddies and doggies but ultimately the end of the war. It was different to see a screenplay deliberate the Second World War without really mentioning Jewish persecution or having yanks winning the war. It details the ignorance of the young. All in all it was interesting to see this from such a unique perspective with more humanist honesty than glamour.\n\nQ : “And at that moment I actually realised that a young age isn’t an excuse. And that it might have been possible to get to know things.”\n\n8/10"
