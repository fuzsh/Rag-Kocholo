        "text": "Bürkel: What does the surname Bürkel mean?\n\nThe last name Bürkel is an ashkenazic Jewish surname derived from the Yiddish word ‘bürkele’ meaning small horse. It is believed to have originated as a nickname given to someone who resembled a horse in some way. The name may have referred to an individual's horse-like gait, strength, courage, or playful nature. Throughout Jewish history, horse-related terms have been seen as compliments and have been bestowed as terms of endearment.\n\nThe name Bürkel first originated in the area of Central and Eastern Europe known as the Pale of Settlement. It is probable that the name was borne by a Jewish family who had settled in this area, and was then passed down through the generations.\n\nSpelling variants of the name Bürkel exist, ranging from Burkel to Burkle and Burkell. Variations of the name Bürkel are now widely distributed throughout many countries, including the United States, Canada, Great Britain, Israel, and Australia.\n\nIt is purported that the Bürkel surname still exists in some form in parts of Eastern Europe where Jews once flourished, however there is no way to confirm this. Due to the Holocaust, tracing the origin of the Bürkel family is difficult and often impossible. As such, it is likely that modern day Bürkel families are descended from a Bürkel family of the past, but it may not be possible to trace their heritage any further.\n\nOrder DNA origin analysis\n\nBürkel: Where does the name Bürkel come from?\n\nThe last name Bürkel is most commonly found today in German-speaking countries, particularly Germany, Austria, Switzerland, and Liechtenstein. According to records from the genealogical website MyHeritage, the Bürkel surname originated in German-speaking regions and can be traced back to the early Middle Ages. It can also be found in the United States, where some immigrants with the Bürkel surname are thought to have settled in the 18th century.\n\nVarious forms of the surname have survived throughout Germany, Austria, and Switzerland, such as Bürkle, Bürklin, and Bürgling. It is also common in the region of Fürstenberg, a historic Principality of southwestern Germany, where the family is said to have originated.\n\nThe meaning of the name Bürkel is thought to have derived from the Middle High German word “burcke,” meaning “castle tower” or “place of refuge.” It is possible that the surname was initially given to a family who lived in or near a castle tower. Alternatively, the name may have been given to a family that ran a hostel or inn.\n\nA very large number of variant spellings have also been documented over time, such as Bürglein, Bürgerle, Bürkle, Bürgler, Burkci, Bürkl, Burgles, Burcl, Bürglerin, Burgele, and Bürklmann, as well as many more.\n\nVariations of the surname Bürkel\n\nThe surname Bürkel is a German name derived from a word meaning “little fort” or “little fortification.” Variants of the name Bürkel include Burkel, Berkel, Burckle and Burkle, as well as Buerkel, Buekel, Bürkle and Buerkle. Similarly, surnames with similar meanings or origins which stem from the same origin as Bürkel include Berking, Henkel, Killinger, and Börking.\n\nBurkel and Berkel are two of the most common variants of the surname Bürkel, with both corresponding to the original German spelling. In the United States, Burkle is the most popular spelling variant of the Bürkel surname, likely due to the influence of popular regional naming trends in the 18th century when the family first migrated to the country. However, the spelling Bürkle is also widely found in Germany and Austria.\n\nIn addition to the variants of the surname Bürkel discussed above, several surnames of similar origin are also found, with names like Henkle, Beckel, and Bockle all tracing their roots to Germany. Similarly, the surname Berkhoff is another related variant, with its roots in the Old German term “berctan,” meaning “to hang over.”\n\nThe spelling of the surname Bürkel may also have been altered due to the influence of different languages, dialects and accents over time. Spelling variations such as Berchle or Burkulla, for example, are also found.\n\nOverall, the surname Bürkel has several spelling variations, many of which are derived from different dialectal and linguistic influences, as well as related surnames which stem from the same origin.\n\nFamous people with the name Bürkel\n\nMaria Bürkel: German YouTuber and content creator.\n\nRudi Bürkel: German writer, screenwriter, and food journalist.\n\nJoe Bürkel: American singer-songwriter.\n\nChristopher Bürkel: German film and television actor.\n\nKonrad Bürkel: Swiss composer and multi-instrumentalist.\n\nChristian Bürkel: German actor, best known as one of the stars of the television series Charité.\n\nReinhard Bürkel: German sculptor and photographer.\n\nAlbrecht Bürkel: German painter and draftsman of the Renaissance.\n\nAlfred Bürkel: German visual artist and painter.\n\nLevi Bürkel: Swiss opera singer and impressionist.\n\nOther surnames"
