        "meta_description": "Haber: Directed by Daniel Ragussis. With Christian Berkel, Juliane KÃ¶hler, Wolf Kahler, Mark Margolis. In 1914, Fritz Haber is Germany's greatest chemist. His Nobel prize-winning synthetic fertilizers have saved the world from mass starvation. But as World War I breaks out across Europe, slaughtering millions of young soldiers, the desperate German military asks Haber to invent an entirely new kind of weapon. Already having sacrificed his Jewish identity and his wife's career to achieve success, Haber's decision not only unleashes weapons of mass destruction for the first time in human history, but also threatens to destroy his family as well.",

        "text": "The movie about Fritz Shimon Haber is a great dramatization of real life events that also allow a deeper insight into events surrounding the development of the \"Haber Process\". It is very educational and well made and for me it was much more interesting learning the Haber Process from it than from a text book. I was most impressed with the quality of the film and the sensitivity it showed towards the subject matter, the complexity of Fritz Shimon Haber's and his wife's characters and their relation to each other. Haber's personality really comes through in the film, but for me personally, most poignant was the portrayal of Haber's wife Clara."
