        "text": "The remarkable film Downfall is (sadly) more renowned because of an Internet meme than for the dramatic merits of the film itself. The movie documents the last few days of the Third Reich, notably the events that took place in Hitler’s bunker (the Führerbunker ) as allied armies closed in on him and ending the Nazi conquest segment of the second World War. Perhaps a victim of its own success, Bruno Ganz‘s superb portrayal of the bombastic Führer includes one particular tirade (shown below) in which he lashes out at his generals, pointing fingers at all military echelons as the realization sets in that defeat is imminent and the end is nigh. That scene was subsequently adopted as an Internet meme where the subtitles were changed to suggest that Hitler was discussing other, totally unrelated manor and in a comical vein. In a short time the meme had variations which mocked specific technologies, current events and even other memes.\n\nThe endless slew of those amusing videos, while funny when taken into context, sadly overshadowed the film itself but at the same time it did have one minor silver lining in that people (myself included) were curious about the source of the video, especially the superb Hitler impersonation, warranting a viewing of the film. I eventually got the Bluray so that I could see it myself, and was thankful that I did.\n\nThe script for Downfall (original German title Der Untergang) was cullled from numerous sources including some memoires of those who were there. While the veracity may remain questionable as we cannot verify that the omissions or recollections were changed to avoid some degree of complicity or guilt from those accounts, the main source appears to have been from Hitler’s very own personal secretary, Traudi Junge, someone who needn’t worry of serious reprisal. In fact the film begins and ends with a short snippet of Junge being briefly interviewed. While the film does not concentrate entirely on Traudi (Alexandra Maria Lara) certain scenes do depict what she and the other secretaries experienced.\n\nThe core narrative captures the perspectives of many characters present those final days but Hitler takes center stage. Aside from Traudi, others personages include Eva Braun, Joseph Goebbels and his wife, as well as other officers and civilians. These perspectives identify those who wholeheartedly believed in the superiority of the Reich and Hitler’s ever growing disillusioned view of the state of the war, as well as the many who knew the truth and the inevitable fate in store for them. Among the latter were those that accepted their lost cause and put on a brave face while others who tried to make a last minute escape. Interestingly the film depicts a number of individuals not only overtly defying Hitler in those last hours but bringing to light that they defied many other orders in the past, doing so on both humanitarian grounds or simply opposition to futile military tactics.\n\nEven though most of the film is set within the confines of the ‘bunker’ there are a number of scenes set immediately outdoors in the neighboring streets and buildings where street battles were ongoing with advancing Russian forces . In those we find the many children hastily recruited to the war effort and manning the battlements, starkly contrasting to Goebbels’ cherubic children singing patriotic songs to Hitler and the others sheltered in the bunker. Another side story culled from a memoir and used in the film is that of SS doctor Schenck (Christian Berkel) who could have escaped but opts to provide medical aid to the large number of injured and dying in the area, witnessing crude amputations and operations with rustic tools as bombardments pound the facilities.\n\nThe greatest takeaway from the film is the stark surrealism of the situation and the dichotomy between acceptance and denial, Eva holding an impromptu party while just a few steps away deserters, including civilians are being shot.\n\nWhile there has never been a shortage of war movies this film certainly offers a unique point of view. Everyone watching knows the ending of the story but I found it was mesmerizing to watch, presenting an important lesson that needs to be revisited every so often. Consider it as a warning to the many even today who disregard the signs of how such dictatorships emerge."
