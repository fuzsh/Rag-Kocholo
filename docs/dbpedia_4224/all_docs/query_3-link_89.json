        "text": "Vive la resistance? I don’t fucking know.\n\nDisclaimer: I know this thing is based on a true story, but I will not base my review on how perfectly accurate to the real situation it may or may not be, but I will instead judge it as a movie… which it is. Disclaimer over.\n\nLadies and gentlemen… “Flame & Citron”.\n\nThe story follows two Danish resistance fighters known as Flame (Thure Lindhardt) and Citron (Mads Mikkelsen) as they battle nazis in Denmark during the second world war. But as they do their mission(s) of taking out nazi targets, they soon find themselves doubting their mission and who their allies/enemies might be. So now we have a pseudo-spy-drama set in WW2 Denmark. And it’s actually quite an enthralling plot, taking several interesting twists and turns while still keeping it fairly simple and straightforward. My only flaw with the plot is that the pacing drags a little bit at times. It’s not often it happens and it’s not a total deal-breaker, but it does bring it down a little bit. But overall it is a really good plot.\n\nThe characters here are flawed, layered, and quite interesting. Thure Lindhardt plays Flame, the titular resistance fighter whose mission it is to kill nazis. He goes through a lot of shit in this movie, portraying all kinds of emotions. And Lindhardt is great in the role. Mads Mikkelsen plays the other title character, Citron (AKA Lemon, but shut up), and as you would expect, he’s great in the role… he’s Mads Mikkelsen, he’s always great. Stine Stengade plays a woman that Flame meets and gets to know throughout the movie, and she’s great in the role. Christian Berkel plays a very important nazi here, and he’s great in the role. Overall it is a very well acted movie filled with solid performances.\n\nThe score for the movie was composed by Karsten Fundal and it is great. It’s dramatic, tense, slightly haunting, and just really beautiful. It really helped elevate a lot of scenes in the movie, whether it was adding tension or making something a little more emotional. Truly great stuff.\n\nThis movie was directed by Ole Christian Madsen and I think he did a great job here. His direction is surprisingly stylish for this type of movie, but it never takes away from more quiet and serious moments. And it does look really good, showing that there’s a good eye behind the camera. The movie also has a couple of action scenes throughout, and while they’re stylized in some ways, they aren’t the overly flashy things that you often see in Hollywood movies. They’re really exciting and badass, with the final big action scene being especially riveting.\n\nThis movie has been well received. On Rotten Tomatoes it has an 87% positive rating and a “Fresh” certification. On Metacritic it has a score of 74/100. Roger Ebert gave it 3/4 stars. And on imdb.com it has a score of 7,3/10.\n\n“Flame & Citron” is a pretty damn good historical thriller. It has a really good plot, really good characters, great performances, great music, and great directing. Like I said earlier, my only flaw with it is that the pacing slightly drags at one or two points. Time for my final score. *Ahem*. My final score for “Flame & Citron” is a 9,33/10. So while slightly flawed, it is still definitely worth buying.\n\nMy review of “Flame & Citron” is now completed.\n\nWe’re going to be doing one thing, and one thing only… killing nazis!"
