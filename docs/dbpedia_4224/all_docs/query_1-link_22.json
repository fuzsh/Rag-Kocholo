        "text": "Origin\n\nLowe : 1: English and Scottish: variant of Low.2: German (Löwe) and Danish (Løwe): from Middle High German lēwe löuwe ‘lion’ hence a nickname for a brave or regal person. In some cases the surname may have been a topographic or habitational name referring to a house or inn distinguished by the sign of a lion. It is also found in Sweden. Compare Loewe 1 Lau Lave and Lurvey.3: Jewish (Ashkenazic; Löwe): artificial name from German Löwe ‘lion’.4: Jewish (Ashkenazic; also Löwe): Germanized form of Levy. Compare Loewe 3.5: Chinese: variant Romanization of the surnames 劉 (see Liu 1) and 盧 (see Lu 1).\n\nAaker : 1: Norwegian (also Åker): topographic name from åker ‘plowed field’. Compare Aker.2: Altered form of Swedish Åker (see Aker) a cognate of 1 above.\n\nAakre : Norwegian (also Åkre): habitational name from any of several places so named from an inflected form of Old Norse akr ‘plowed field’. Compare Akre.\n\nAger : 1: English (mainly Essex Suffolk and Northamptonshire): variant of Alger or possibly of Edgar.2: Danish: habitational name from any of several places called Ager meaning ‘plowed land’ (from a cognate of the English word acre).3: French: from the ancient Germanic personal name Adgari composed of the elements adal ‘noble’ + gari (from garwa) ‘ready eager’ or gari ‘spear’. This surname is very rare in France.\n\nAker : 1: Norwegian (Åker): variant of Aaker a cognate of 2 below. Compare Acker.2: Swedish (Åker): from åker ‘plowed field’ applied either as an ornamental or a topographic name. Compare Acker.3: German Dutch and English: variant of Acker.\n\nAlawi : Muslim: from Arabic ʿalawī denoting a descendant or follower of Ali the first imam of the Shiite Muslims. The surname may also be from the related Arabic personal name ʿAlawī ‘sublime exalted; heavenly’. Compare Alaoui and Alavi.\n\nAlgahim : Muslim: apparently a variant of al-Jahīm from Arabic jahīm ‘glowering’ (perhaps in reference to a fiercely glowering warrior).\n\nAllen : 1: English and Scottish: from the Middle English Old French personal name Alain Alein (Old Breton Alan) from a Celtic personal name of great antiquity and obscurity. In England the personal name is now usually spelled Alan the surname Allen; in Scotland the surname is more often Allan. From 1139 it was common in Scotland where the surname also derives from Gaelic Ailéne Ailín from ail ‘rock’. The present-day frequency of the surname Allen in England and Ireland is partly accounted for by the popularity of the personal name among Breton followers of William the Conqueror by whom it was imported first to Britain and then to Ireland. Saint Alan(us) was a 5th-century bishop of Quimper who was a cult figure in medieval Brittany. Another Saint Al(l)an was a Cornish or Breton saint of the 6th century to whom a church in Cornwall is dedicated.2: English: occasionally perhaps from the rare Middle English femaje personal name Aline (Old French Adaline Aaline) a pet form of ancient Germanic names in Adal- especially Adalheidis (see Allis).3: French: variant of Allain a cognate of 1 above and in North America (also) an altered form of this.\n\nAmarante : 1: Italian (Campania): from an early Christian female personal name Greek Amaranthē ‘unfading’ bestowed with reference to the adjective amarantos (conflated with anthos ‘flower’ to give the -anth ending) as used in I Peter 5:4: ‘And when the chief shepherd shall appear ye shall receive a crown of glory that fadeth not away’.2: Portuguese and Galician: habitational name from any of the places so called in northern Portugal and Galicia from Latin (villa) Amaranti from the Latin personal name Amarant(h)us (‘amaranth’).\n\nAmelung : German: from the Middle High German personal name Amelung which was popular in the 12th and 13th centuries. It was adopted in honor of the Amelungen of medieval literature warriors (in particular followers of Dietrich von Bern and successors of the Gothic royal house) who bore compound names of which the first element was amal ‘capable brave eager’. This surname is also found in the Netherlands.\n\nAmes : 1: English (of Norman origin): from the Old French personal name Amis or from the feminine form Amice. The Old French word amis is from Latin amicus ‘friend’ which was used in Late Latin as a term for a man of the lower classes in particular a slave. There were also derivatives of this as personal names in particular masculine Amicius and feminine Amicia. Both were in use as personal names in England and may have contributed to the surname.2: German: perhaps a nickname for an active person from an ancient Germanic word related to Old High German amazzig ‘busy’.3: Dutch: possibly a patronymic from Ame a common personal name in Holland and Friesland an abbreviated form of an ancient Germanic personal name perhaps beginning with amel ‘strong’.\n\nAmmerman : Americanized form of German Ammermann: habitational name for someone from Ammerland a region in the province of Oldenburg (Lower Saxony).\n\nAmrein : 1: South German chiefly Swiss German: topographic name from am ‘at’ + Rain ‘edge of plowed land’.2: German: altered form of Amrhein. Compare Amerine and Amrine.\n\nAndolsek : Slovenian (Andolšek): habitational name for someone from the village of Andol in Lower Carniola. In North America this surname may also be an altered form of the variant Andoljšek.\n\nAnstett : German:: 1: from the medieval personal name Anstett a vernacular derivative of Greek Anastasios (see Anastasio).2: habitational name from Anstedt in Lower Saxony.\n\nAntes : 1: German: from a vernacular form common in the Rhineland of the personal name Anton Latin Antonius (see Anthony) a variant of Anthes 1.2: German: humanistic surname a Hellenization of Blume literally ‘flower’ (see Blum) with reference to the Greek word anthos ‘flower’. Compare Andes and Andis.3: Dutch: from the personal name Ant(e) a short form of the ancient Germanic names such as Andbert with genitive inflection -s.4: Dutch: alternatively perhaps a variant of Antens itself possibly from a vernacular form of Antoons a patronymic from Antonius (see Anton).\n\nAnthis : 2: Greek: from a derivative of anthos ‘flower’. This may also be a shortened form of patronymics such as Anthimidis (from the personal name Anthimos derived from the same word anthos). Compare Anthes 2 and Antis 2.1: Americanized form of German Anthes 1 or Antis 1.\n\nAnthony : 1: English and West Indian (mainly Antigua and Barbuda Saint Lucia and Trinidad and Tobago also Dutch Caribbean): from the personal name Anthony Latin Antonius which with its variants and cognates is one of the commonest personal names in Europe. Spellings with -h- which first appear in English in the 16th century and in French (as Anthoine) at about the same time are due to the erroneous belief that the name derives from Greek anthos ‘flower’. The popularity of the personal name in Christendom is largely due to the cult of the Egyptian hermit Saint Anthony (AD 251–356) who in his old age gathered a community of hermits around him and for that reason is regarded by some as the founder of monasticism. It was further increased by the fame of Saint Anthony of Padua (1195–1231) who long enjoyed a great popular cult and who is believed to help people find lost things. In North America the English form of the surname has absorbed cognates and derivatives (patronymics) from other languages for example Greek patronymic Antoniades Italian Antoni Polish Antoniewicz Croatian and Serbian Antonović (see Antonovich) and Antunović; see also below. The name Anthony is also found among Christians in southern India but since South Indians traditionally do not have hereditary surnames the southern Indian name was in most cases registered as such only after immigration of its bearers to the US. Compare Antony.2: German Flemish and French (mainly Alsace): Latinized (humanistic) patronymic from local equivalents of the Latin personal name Antonius from its genitive form Antoni(i). In North America this surname is also an altered form of the German Dutch French and Slovak cognates Antoni 1 and Antony 2.\n\nAper : Flemish Dutch and German (Lower Saxony): from the personal name Aper a variant of Albert.\n\nArmendariz : Basque: Castilianized form (Armendáriz) of Armendaritz which is either a patronymic from Armentari from the Latin occupational name armentarius ‘herdsman’ or a habitatonal name from the village of Armendaritze (in French: Armendarits) in Lower Navarre (now in Pyrénées-Atlantiques France) most likely named from the same Latin word (derivation from the elements arri ‘rock’ + mendi ‘mountain’ + aritz ‘oak’ is probably a folk etymology). Compare Almendarez Almendariz and Armendarez.\n\nArrington : English:: 1: variant of Harrington with loss of initial H-.2: possibly a habitational name from Arrington a place in Cambridgeshire named from an Old English byname Earn(a) meaning ‘eagle’ + -inga- ‘people or followers of’ + tūn ‘settlement’.\n\nAshington : 1: from Ashington (Lincs Northumb Sussex). The Northumb place-name is from Old English æscen ‘ash-grown’ + denu ‘valley’. The Sussex name is from the Old English given name Æsc + -inga- indicating a connection between the family or followers of the person named and the place + tūn ‘farm village’ so ‘farm of those connected with Æsc’. The name in Lincs has not yet been explained. 2: perhaps sometimes from Ashingdon (Essex) but there is no clear evidence for continuity from the Middle Ages. The place-name recorded as Assandun in 1016 is from Old English assa ‘ass’ or a given name of the same form in the genitive case with -n + dūn hill. 3: possibly a variant of Ashenden in Kent contexts.\n\nAswegan : Americanized form of North German Aswegen: habitational name from Aschwege a hamlet near Oldenburg in Lower Saxony. The surname Aswegen is very rare in Germany.\n\nAx : 1: German: variant of Axt.2: Swedish: soldier's name apparently from ax ‘ear (i.e. the part of a cereal plant which contains its flowers or seeds)’.3: Amerindian (Guatemala): Mayan name from aax ‘wart’.\n\nAzcarate : Basque: Castilianized form (Azcárate) of Azkarate a habitational name from Azkarate (in Castilian: Azcárate) in Navarre and Azkarate (in French: Ascarat) in Lower Navarre (now in Pyrénées-Atlantiques France) from Basque atz ‘crag rock’ and gara ‘height’.\n\nAzzara : Italian (southern):: 1: from a personal name based on Arabic az-zahrah ‘the flower’.2: (Azzarà): occupational name derived from medieval Greek opsaras ‘fisherman’.\n\nBachan : 1: Altered form of French Bachand.2: Czech Slovak and Polish: derivative of the personal name Bach 5.3: Americanized form of Croatian Bačan and Baćan: occupational name for a senior shepherd from an augmentative of bač(a) (see Baca 2) or a nickname or a relationship name from baćan a pet name meaning ‘(little) brother’.4: Indian: variant of Bachchan from Hindi bachcha ‘child’ Sanskrit bačča. This is not a traditional Indian surname but rather a pseudonym adopted as a surname by members of castes ranked lower in the varna system. It is also common in Trinidad and Tobago.\n\nBadenhorst : from a place called Badenhorst in Elsdorf (Lower Saxony Germany).\n\nBahnsen : North German:: 1: patronymic from Bahn. This surname is also found in Denmark.2: habitational name from a place called Bahnsen near Uelzen Lower Saxony.\n\nBakas : Greek:: 1: nickname for a small rotund man from Albanian baq ‘lower part of the belly’.

This surname is very rare in Germany. In part it is a Gottscheerish (i.e. Gottschee German) surname originating from the Kočevsko region in Lower Carniola Slovenia (see Kocevar).\n\nBartle : 1: English: from the Middle English and Old French personal name Bartel a pet form of the medieval personal name Bartholomew.2: English: habitational name from Higher and Lower Bartle in Saint Michael on Wyre parish Lancashire.3: German (also Bärtle): from a pet form of the personal name Bartholomäus (see Bartholomew) or Berthold.4: Americanized form of German Polish Czech and Slovak Bartel and of the Slovenian variant Bartelj.\n\nBaudisch : Germanized form of Sorbian (and possibly also other Slavic) Budyš and Budiš: from a pet form of the personal name Lower Sorbian Budysław Upper Sorbian Budisław based on the Old Slavic element bud ‘to inspire’ (see Budish).\n\nBaute : 1: Spanish (Canary Islands mainly Tenerife): of Guanche origin but unexplained etymology.2: French: habitational name from (La) Baute the name of several places in southwestern France.3: French: variant of Baude a cognate of Bault.4: North German: unexplained. It is found mainly in North Rhine-Westphalia and Lower Saxony.\n\nBeeden : 1: from either Bidon or La Ville-Bidon (Ille-et-Villaine Brittany). The short vowel of Bidon was frequently lowered and lengthened to produce the spellings Beedon and Beeden. Stow Bedon and Kirby Bedon Norfolk were held by John de Bidun in 1212. It is probably the principal source of the surname Beedon in E Anglia and a contributor to Bedden in the Midlands. Some bearers listed below may however belong at (2). 2: from any of various places named with Old English byden ‘vessel for liquids’ in a transferred topographic sense such as ‘tub-shaped hollow’ or ‘narrow steep valley’. These include Benna in Christow Betham in Witheridge and Bidna in Northam (all in Devon) Bidden in Upton Grey (Hants) and Beedon (Berks). Early surname forms with atte are more likely to be topographic alluding not to a settlement but to a local landscape feature named with Middle English biden (western dialect) buden reflexes of the Old English word. Surnames with this etymology will be pronounced /'bɪdən/ or /'bi:den/ as in (1) and some bearers listed below may alternatively belong at (1).from Baydon (Wilts) or Beadon (in Hennock Devon) both possibly ‘berry hill’ from Old English beg + dūn. Alternatively the first element is the Old English female personal name Bēage (related to Old English bēag Middle English bei biʒe bye) ‘ring bracelet torque’. This would explain the 1327 surname de Bigedene in East Meon (Hants) with the not uncommon Middle English substitution of -den for -don in the Wilts place-name. The 1332 example in Lustleigh (adjacent to Hennock) clearly belongs to Beadon and the 1377 and 1381 examples of Beydon in Wilts and Surrey allude to Baydon as may do a number of examples spelled Bidon Bydon Byden etc. pronounced /'baidən/ in Modern English.for someone who lived by the hill from Middle English bi doun (Old English Middle English dūn ‘hill’) as in the 1332 Bishop's Tawton (Devon) example. 3: from Beeding (Sussex) recorded as æt Beadingum (about 880) Bedingges (1073) Beding (1327) and Byding (1330 1362) in Place-Names of Sussex. The place-name denoted ‘the people of Bēada’ from an Old English personal name + the Old English plural suffix -ingas forming folk-names. In the surname the final -ing may sometimes have been reduced to -en but some bearers listed below may belong at other senses. 4: see Beedham probably a major source of the name in the E Midlands.\n\nBeedham : 1: possibly from Bytham (Lincs) with Middle English lengthening and lowering of the main vowel to give modern Beedham.Later forms of the name may have been confused with or represent Beeden. 2: see Beetham.\n\nBeguin : French (also Béguin):: 1: from a diminutive of the ancient Germanic personal name Bego a short form of compound names based on the element beg from Latin beccus ‘beak bill’.2: nickname from beguin the name for a member of a medieval Christian male religious community (ultimately named after a priest called Lambert le Begue; see Begue) that followed a monastic rule without making perpetual vows and was quickly considered heretic; by extension the term came to mean ‘sanctimonious person’.\n\nBehling : German:: 1: habitational name from Behling in the Ruhr district (near Hagen) or possibly from Behlingen Württemberg Lower Saxony Bavaria or Belingen (Rhineland-Palatinate).2: variant of Böhling (see Bohling).\n\nBehringer : German:: 1: habitational name for someone from either of two places called Behringen in Lower Saxony and Thuringia or from Böhringen in Württemberg.

The 1300 example cited below seems to imply a comparison with a white flower as a symbol of beauty but so was white flour which was a traditional epithet in medieval romances for someone whose skin was perfectly smooth and white.
