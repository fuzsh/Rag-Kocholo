        "text": "Origin\n\nPen : 1: English: variant of Penn.2: Dutch: metonymic occupational name for a clerk or penman from pen ‘pen’ or for a craftsman using pins from pen ‘pin’ (compare Pin).3: Breton (mainly Le Pen): topographic name or nickname from penn ‘head’. Alternatively perhaps a cognate of French Payen (compare Pean). Compare also Pene 2 and Penn 8.4: Slovenian: nickname or ethnic name of the same origin as German Böhm (see Boehm) meaning ‘Bohemian’ (i.e. ‘Czech’). Alternatively from an old short form of the personal name Pernhart an old South German variant of Bernhard (see Bernard).5: Cambodian: written ប៉ែន of Chinese origin (see Bin 1).\n\nA'Lee : variant of Middle English atte Leye ‘(dweller) at the clearing’ (Old English lēah ‘open woodland’). Compare Attley.\n\nAaron : Jewish English Welsh West Indian Guyanese and African (mainly Nigeria): from the Biblical Hebrew personal name Aharon (which was Latinized as Aaron) borne by the first high priest of the Israelites the brother of Moses (Exodus 4:14). Like Moses it is probably of Egyptian origin with a meaning no longer recoverable. In England and Wales the name comes from the occasional adoption of Aaron as a Christian personal name. In south Wales for example where fixed surnames developed much later than in England it was coined independently as a surname in the 17th–19th centuries reflecting the enthusiasm for Old Testament personal names among Nonconformists.\n\nAbberley : from Abberley (Worcs) which is recorded as Edboldelega in 1086 Abbodeley in 1327 and Abburley in 1478. The place-name derives from the Old English personal name Ēadbald + lēah ‘open woodland’ but was occasionally treated as if the first element were abbod ‘abbot’.\n\nAbendroth : German: apparently from the vocabulary word Abendrot(h) Middle High German ābentrōt ‘sunset’ (compare Abend) but in many if not all cases actually a folk-etymological alteration of Appenrodt or of its cognate Appenroth.\n\nAbu : 1: Muslim: abstracted as a surname from Arabic abū ‘father’ a common component of traditional Muslim names. It is used to form the kunya (a type of name meaning ‘father of’ such as Abū-Bakr literally ‘father of the Young Camel’; see Abubakr) in combination with the name of a man's child usually his firstborn son (or hoped-for firstborn). In traditional Muslim society a man is generally known and addressed by his kunya rather than by his ism (his personal name) the use of which can seem unduly familiar. A kunya may also be used to form a nickname as in the case of Abū-Turāb ʿAlī ‘ʿAlī father of dust’ the kunya of caliph Ali conferred on him by the prophet Muhammad. — Note: It is possible that in some cases this is counted as an independent surname only in the population figure published by the US Census Bureau.2: Muslim and Jewish (Sephardic from the Maghreb): from the Arabic male personal name ʿAbbū a pet form of any of the many names beginning with ʿAbd ‘servant’.3: West African (Sierra Leone Ghana and Nigeria): probably of Arabic origin (see 1 and 2 above).\n\nAch : 1: German: topographic name for someone who lived by a spring or stream from Old High German aha ‘running water’.2: German: habitational name from any of the places so named in southern Germany and Austria.3: Americanized form of Hungarian Ács ‘carpenter’ (see Acs) and of its Slovak variant Áč.\n\nAcs : Hungarian (Ács): occupational name from ács ‘carpenter’. This surname is also found in Slovakia. Compare Ach.\n\nAdesina : West African (Nigeria): from the Yoruba personal name Adés̩ínà from adé s̩í ò̩nà ‘the crown opens the way’ often given to a child awaited for a long time and understood to mean ‘(the child) opens the mother's womb for more children’.\n\nAdsley : from Edgeley a lost place in Egerton near Headcorn (Kent) recorded as Edesle 1258 1313 Eadesleg' 1270 all in surnames. The place-name is probably from the Old English given name *Ēad in the genitive case with -es + lēah ‘open woodland’.\n\nAffeldt : North German: topographic name for a person living in a distant area of open country from Middle Low German af ‘away off’ + velt ‘open country’.\n\nAguirre : Basque: Castilianized form of Agirre a topographic name from ager agir ‘open space pasture’. This is found as the first element of several placenames reflected in Basque surnames such as Aguirrezabal ‘broad open space’. The surname Aguirre may also be a shortening of any of these. Compare Aquirre.\n\nAjanel : Amerindian (Guatemala): Mayan name from ajanel ‘carpenter’.\n\nAke : 1: English: topographic name for someone living by a prominent oak tree from Middle English ake ‘oak’ or a habitational name from the village of Aike near Lockington East Yorkshire which is named with Old English āc ‘oak’ dative āce ‘(place at) the oak tree’.2: Amerindian (Mexico): from the name of the site of a pre-Columbian Mayan settlement in the Yucatán Peninsula.\n\nAlbarran : Spanish (Albarrán): nickname or occupational name from medieval Spanish albarrán ‘foreigner alien’ also ‘chief herdsman or shepherd’ (from Arabic al- ‘the’ + barrāni ‘outside’ from barra ‘out’ or barr ‘land open country’).\n\nAlcaide : Spanish and Portuguese: ancient occupational or status name from alcaide from Arabic al-qāʾid ‘the leader the commander’ (see Kaid). The meaning of the Spanish and Portuguese word varied depending on period and region including ‘castellan’ ‘constable of a castle’ ‘customs officer’ and ‘jailer’.\n\nAldred : English:: 1: from the Middle English personal name Al(d)red or El(d)red an overlap or merger of three Old English names Ealdrǣd (or Aldrǣd) Æthelrǣd and Ælfrǣd. Old English Ealdrǣd and its variant Aldrǣd regularly appear in Middle English as either Eldred or Aldred depending on dialect. The pronunciation of Old English Æthelrǣd was often shortened occurring in Middle English as Ailred Eilred Alred and Elred. Subsequently a transitional -d- was inserted between the l and the r resulting in A(i)ldred and E(i)ldred. Middle English forms of Old English Ælfrǣd sometimes lost the medial -f- becoming Alred or Elred and then Aldred Eldred. All three personal names were largely obsolete by the end of the 13th century.2: variant of Audrey 2.\n\nAllington : English (southern): habitational name from any of at least nine different places called Allington two in Kent three in Wiltshire and one each in Dorset Devon Hampshire and Lincolnshire. These have different origins: those in Devon Wiltshire near Chippenham and Kent near Maidstone are from the Old English personal name Ælla + -ingtūn meaning ‘Ælla's farm’; those in Dorset Wiltshire near Devizes and Lincolnshire are named with Old English ætheling ‘prince' + tūn meaning ‘settlement of the prince’; those in Hampshire and Wiltshire near Amesbury are from the Old English personal name Ealda + tūn; and the one in Kent near Lenham is from the Old English personal name Æthelnōth + -ingtūn meaning ‘Æthelnōth's farm’.\n\nAlnajjar : Arabic: variant of Najjar ‘carpenter’ with the addition of al ‘the’.\n\nAmalfitano : Italian: habitational name for someone from Amalfi a small city on the Gulf of Salerno which was once an independent republic and an important sea power.\n\nAmberley : from Amberley (Sussex) which is recorded as Ambrelie in 1086 and Aumberly in 1279 Amberley in Marden (Herefs) which is recorded as Amburlege in 1086 and Ambrelegh in 1316 or Amberley in Minchinhampton (Gloucs) which is recorded as Amberley and Omberleia in the 13th century. All three place-names probably derive from the Old English bird-name amer ‘bunting’ + lēah ‘open woodland’.\n\nAn : 1: Chinese: Mandarin form of the surname 安 meaning ‘peace safe’ or ‘calm’ in Chinese: (i) borne by descendants of immigrants from an ancient state called An Xi (安息) also known as the Parthian Empire (located in present-day northeastern Iran). Traditional accounts record that the legendary emperor Huang Di the ‘Yellow Emperor’ (c. 27th century BC) had a grandson named An who moved to the far west to establish An Xi losing contact with the Middle Kingdom. In 147 AD An Shigao (安世高) prince of the Parthian Empire (An Xi) came to China to preach Buddhism. Later some immigrants from the Parthian Empire (An Xi) adopted their tribal name An as their surname. (ii) adopted as a surname by the An Chi (安遲) family from the Xianbei ethnic group in northern China during the Northern Wei dynasty (386–534 AD). (iii) from one of the ‘Nine Sogdian Surnames’ also known as ‘Nine Surnames of Zhaowu’ because their ancestors came from Zhaowu an ancient city in present-day Gansu province in northwestern China. During the Sui and Tang dynasties (581–987 AD) there were nine Sogdian states in Central Asia one of which was called An (安) in Chinese. Between 649 and 655 AD these states submitted to Emperor Gaozong of Tang (628–83 AD). (iv) possibly from An (安) the name of an ancient fief (located in Shanxi province).2: Chinese: variant Romanization of the surname 晏 see Yan 5.3: Chinese: variant Romanization of the surname 洪 see Hong 1.4: Korean: written 안 in Chinese characters 安 meaning ‘peace’. This is the only Chinese character for the surname An. Some sources indicate that there are 109 An clans but only six can be documented. All had one common founding ancestor named Yi Wŏn (李 瑗) who migrated from Tang China to the Shilla Kingdom in 807 AD. Yi had three sons who helped the Shilla king Kyŏngmun (861–75) to repel Japanese invaders. As a token of royal appreciation these three sons were enfeoffed with land and granted the surname An (安). It is now quite a common Korean surname and can be found throughout the peninsula. Compare Ahn 1.5: Vietnamese: from the Chinese surname 安 (see 1 above).6: Vietnamese (Ân): from the Chinese surname 殷 (see Yin 1).\n\nAndal : 1: Filipino: nickname from Tagalog andal ‘jostle push’ or Bikol (h)andal ‘to worry’ or alternatively borrowed from Indonesian andal ‘reliable dependable’ and ‘capable able’.2: Norwegian: habitational name from any of the four farms so named most likely from ahn ‘elm’ + dal ‘valley’.\n\nAngermeier : German: distinguishing name from Middle High German anger ‘meadow’ + meier ‘tenant farmer’ (see Meyer) i.e. ‘tenant farmer of the farm by the meadow or open field’.\n\nAnley : 1: from Anley in Settle (WR Yorks) which is recorded as Anele Anleie in 1086 and Aynley in 1580 or Only House in Northowram (also WR Yorks) recorded as Anele in 1200 and Anelay in 1389. The place-names derive from Old English lēah ‘open woodland’ with an uncertain first element probably either ān ‘one single’ (i.e. ‘isolated alone’) or the Old English personal name Ana. 2: an anglicization of a French surname such as Agnelet.\n\nAnnunziata : Italian: from a short form of the Marian name Maria l'Annunziata referring to the Annunciation by the archangel Gabriel to the Virgin Mary of her impending motherhood (Luke 1:20–38). The festival of the Annunciation has been celebrated since the 5th century. It was at first kept on Ember Wednesday during Lent but was later moved to 25 March exactly nine months before Christmas Day replacing pagan festivals celebrating the vernal equinox.\n\nAnsara : Arabic: apparently related to the Arabic word for Pentecost (Whitsunday) al-ʿanṣara of Aramaic origin. Bearers of this surname are Christians.\n\nAnslow : English: habitational name from Anslow in Staffordshire. The placename derives from the Old English female personal name Ēanswīth (genitive Ēanswīthe) + lēah ‘open woodland’. Compare Enslow.\n\nAppenzeller : German: habitational name for someone from Appenzell (city or canton) in northeastern Switzerland. The placename derives ultimately from Latin abbatis cella ‘abbot's cell’ in reference to the summer residence of the abbots of Saint Gallen.\n\nApperley : English:: 1: habitational name from Apperley in Deerhurst (Gloucestershire) which derives from Old English apuldor ‘apple-tree’ + lēah ‘open woodland’.2: possibly also a habitational name from Apperley Bridge in Eccleshill (Yorkshire) or from Apperley Dene (Northumberland) but evidence for the surname in northern England is wanting.\n\nArafat : Muslim: ornamental religious name adopted with reference to ‘Arafāt a plain lying twelve miles southwest of Mecca where pilgrims spend a day praying during the hajj.\n\nAragon : Spanish (Aragón) and southern French: habitational name from Aragon Spain which was an independent kingdom from 1035 to 1479. It took its name from the river Aragón which arises in its northwestern corner. The river name may be related to Basque (h)ara(n) ‘valley’; in Basque Aragon is called Aragoa or Aragoi which probably means ‘high valley’. Compare Deragon.\n\nArley : 1: from Arley (Warwicks) which is recorded as Earnlege in 1001 Arlei in 1086 and Arnlege in 1221 Areley Kings (Worcs) recorded as Ernele in 1156 Arneley in 1275 and Arleye in 1291 or Upper Arley (formerly in Staffs now Worcs) recorded as Earnleie in 996 Erlege in 1188 and Arnlege in 1276. All three place-names derive from Old English earn ‘eagle’ + lēah ‘open woodland’. Compare Earley.possibly from Arley in Aston by Budworth (Cheshire) which is recorded as Harlae in 1336 Arlegh in 1340 and Harlagh in 1347. The place-name derives from Old English lēah ‘open woodland’ with an uncertain first element perhaps hār ‘hoary grey’. 2: from Arley in Blackrod (Lancs) which is recorded as Erelegh in 1283 and Erley in 1394 or Arley in Mellor (also Lancs) recorded as Ereley in the 13th century and Arley in 1558. The place-names derive from Old English lēah ‘open woodland’ with an uncertain first element. The post-medieval bearers cited under (1) may alternatively belong here.\n\nArmfield : English (Cheshire): habitational name from Arnfield in Tintwistle Cheshire now Derbyshire. This is an unusual case because the 14th-century placename itself contains an earlier Middle English surname Arneway (from the Old English personal name Earnwīg) + feld ‘open land used for pasture or cultivation’. Compare Arnfield.\n\nArostegui : Basque: Castilianized form of Arostegi or Aroztegi a topographic name from arotz ‘carpenter or blacksmith’ + the ending -tegi ‘house workshop of’.\n\nAshcroft : English (mainly Lancashire): habitational name from Agecroft in Pendlebury Lancashire. It could also be a topographic name from Middle English asche ‘ash tree’ + croft ‘enclosure’.\n\nAshfield : English: habitational name from either of two places called Ashfield in Shropshire and Suffolk or possibly from any of numerous minor places called Ashfield; these are named from Old English æsc ‘ash’ + feld ‘open country’.\n\nAsp : 1: Swedish: ornamental name from asp ‘aspen tree’.2: Norwegian: habitational name from a farmstead named with asp ‘aspen tree’.3: German and English: topographic name from Middle High German aspe Middle English aspe ‘aspen tree’.4: English: metathesized variant of Apps.\n\nAspden : English: habitational name from Aspden (alias Aspen) in Oswaldtwistle Lancashire. This surname has been confused with Ashton and Austin and probably also with Aston and Astin all of which are common surnames in Lancashire.\n\nAspell : 1: English: habitational name from Aspull in Greater Manchester named from Old English æspe ‘aspen’ + hyll ‘hill’. Compare Asbell.2: Irish: in Ireland this is usually the English name in 1 above imported but according to MacLysaght it is also an east Leinster variant of Archbold (see Archibald).\n\nAspen : 1: Norwegian: habitational name from a place called Aspen from an inflected form of asp ‘aspen tree’.2: English (Lancashire): variant of Espin.\n\nAsper : 1: Swiss German German and Norwegian: topographic name for someone living by aspen trees from Middle High German aspe or a habitational name for someone from a place called with this word (compare Asp). This surname is rare in Germany and virtually non-existing in Switzerland.2: Americanized form of Arabic Esber 1 or Esper 4.\n\nAspin : see Aspen.\n\nAspinwall : English: habitational name from a place in the parish of Ormskirk Lancashire called Aspinwall (also Asmall) named in Old English with æspen ‘growing with aspen trees’ + wæll(a) ‘stream’. There has probably also been some confusion with another Lancashire habitational surname Aspinhalgh the second element of which is Old English halh ‘nook’.\n\nAspley : 1: from Aspley in Brewood or Aspley in Eccleshall (both Staffs) or from Aspley Heath in Tanworth in Arden or perhaps the lost Aspley in Wixford (both Warwicks). All these place-names are from Old English æspe ‘aspen tree’ + lēah ‘wood glade’. 2: from Apsley End in Kings Langley (Herts). 3: from Aspley Guise (Beds) or possibly from Apsley End in Shillington (also Beds). 4: perhaps occasionally from another of the many places called Apsley or Aspley (the metathesis operates in both directions) such as Apsley Farm in Thakeham (Sussex) Apsley in Ellesborough (Bucks) and Aspley Hall in Radford (Notts).\n\nAsplund : 1: Swedish: ornamental name composed of the elements asp ‘aspen’ + lund ‘grove’.2: Norwegian: habitational name from any of several farms named Asplund of the same derivation as 1 above.\n\nAssinder : perhaps an anglicized from Portuguese azeiteiro ‘olive-oil producer or vendor’. This is not inconsistent with its earliest appearance in the London area (though it subsequently flourishes in Kent). The form Assinder has epenthesis of -n- in a medial unstressed syllable as in nightingale and messenger.\n\nAtchley : English: habitational name from Atchley in Shropshire which may derive from an Old English personal name Æcca + lēah ‘open woodland’.\n\nAthens : 1: Americanized form of Greek patronymics derived from the personal name Athanasios meaning ‘immortal’ (see Athanas). Compare Athans.2: Americanized form of Greek Atheneos ‘Athenian’ or Athenakis a habitational name for someone from the city of Athens. These were also used as nicknames for people who had spent time in Athens and liked to show off their worldliness.\n\nAtherfold : from Middle English at ther folde ‘(dweller or worker) at the fold (in the sense pen for farm animals)’.\n\nAttfield : variant of Field from Middle English atte feld ‘(dweller) by the area of open land’ (Old English feld) sometimes with a prosthetic H-.alternatively a variant of Hatfield with loss of initial H-.\n\nAudi : 1: Italian: patronymic or plural form of the personal name Audo a variant of Aldo.2: Arabic (mainly Palestine): from ʿAwdī a habitational name for someone from Al-ʿAwd the name of several places mostly on Arabian Peninsula. It is found among both Muslims and Christians.\n\nAufderheide : German (mainly Westphalia): topographic name for someone who lived auf der Heide ‘on the heath’ meaning on open land outside the bounds of a village or town.\n\nAusterfield : from Austerfield (WR Yorks) so named from Old English eowestre ‘sheepfold’ + feld ‘open land’.\n\nAveley : 1: perhaps a variant of Averley or vice versa. Compare Martha Averley 1787 Martha Aveley 1788 William Aveley 1833 in IGI (Soham Cambs). 2: from Aveley (Essex) a few miles east of the old City of London. The place-name is recorded as Aluithelea in 1086 Alviueleia in 1157 Alvyleye in 1272–1307 and Alveley Aveley in 1535. It derives from the Old English female personal name Ælfgȳð + Old English lēah ‘open woodland’.perhaps an occasional pronunciation of Avery with [l] for [r] or vice versa. Compare John Averey 1621 in IGI (Saint Bride Fleet Street London). 3: perhaps from Avely Hall in Assington (Suffolk) a few miles south-east of Sudbury although the surname evidence is slight and may belong with (1) or (2) or have a different but unknown origin. The place-name is recorded as Aluenelega in 1086 Alwyneleye in 1298 Alvyngley alias Alweley in 1518–29 and Alveley alias Alvingley in 1569. It derives from the Old English female personal name Ælfwynn + Old English lēah ‘open woodland’. It is not certain that the 1340 example below belongs here.\n\nAverley : variant of Haverley (see Habberley) with loss of initial H-. This is explicit in Mary Averley or Aberley 1625 Edward Aberley 1708 in IGI (Rugeley Staffs) and in Edwd Habberley 1702 Edward Haverley 1708 Charles Aberly 1732 Eleanor Joyce Averley 1815 in IGI (Saint Giles Cripplegate London).perhaps from Aversley Wood in Sawtrey (Hunts now Cambs) with loss of medial -s-. The place-name is recorded as Ailbrittesle in 1209 Aylbritesle in 1245 and Albrichelee in 1290 and derives from the Old English personal name Æðelbeorht (genitive Æðelbeorhtes) + lēah ‘open woodland’. A(i)lbrit(s)ley will have been simplified to something like Aber(s)ley and Aver(s)ley but it is not known when. If the spelling of his surname is reliable it is conceivable that John de Averle 1279 in Hundred Rolls (Hunts) provides early evidence for it and it could account for the surname in 17th-century Cambs but the absence of any medieval spellings of the place-name with Aber- or Aver- makes it difficult to assess its plausibility.perhaps a variant of Aveley with -er- as an inverted spelling of medial unstressed -e-. Compare Martha Averley 1787 Martha Aveley 1788 William Aveley 1833 in IGI (Soham Cambs) but spellings with -er- occur much earlier for the Soham family name for which Aveley is more likely to be a late spelling of Averley.\n\nAwad : Arabic:: 1: occupational name from ʿawwād ‘lute player’ or ‘lute maker’.2: possibly also from a personal name based on ʿawwād ‘one who compensates or indemnifies’. Bearers of this surname are both Muslims and Christians.\n\nAwada : Muslim (mainly Lebanon): possibly from Arabic ʿawāḍa ‘compensation (from God)’. Compare Awadalla.\n\nAwadallah : Arabic (mainly Egypt Sudan and Palestine): from a personal name based on ʿawaḍ Allāh ‘compensation from God’ used in particular for a child whose elder sibling had died. Bearers of this surname are both Muslims and Christians.\n\nAxt : German: metonymic occupational name for a woodcutter carpenter or maker of axes from Middle High German ackes axt- ‘axe’.\n\nAxtmann : German: occupational name for a woodcutter carpenter or maker of axes from Middle High German ackes axt- ‘axe’ + man ‘man’.\n\nAza : 1: Spanish: habitational name from a place called Aza or Haza in Burgos province. Compare De Aza.2: Japanese: rare name from Fukushima prefecture usually written 呰 ‘slander’ but the character could be a miswriting of 此口 Konokuchi another rare name meaning ‘this opening’. Another possibility also pronounced Aza could be 字 ‘(one from a) rural district’.\n\nBadeau : French:: 1: variant of Badaud from the ancient Germanic personal name Badwald composed of the elements bad (from badhuo) ‘battle’ + wald ‘rule power’.2: (southern): unflattering nickname from Occitan badau ‘stupid gullible’ a derivative of badar ‘to be open-mouthed to gape’. Compare Badeaux.\n\nBahn : 1: German: topographic name from Middle High German or Middle Low German bān ‘open space public area’.2: East German (of Slavic origin): topographic name from Sorbian bahno ‘swamp’.3: North German and East Frisian: from an ancient Germanic personal name of uncertain origin.4: Chinese: variant Romanization of the surname 彭 see Peng 1.\n\nBalk : 1: German: from a pet form of a Slavic equivalent of the personal name Valentinus (see Valentine).2: Dutch and German: from balk balke ‘timber beam’ hence a metonymic occupational name for a carpenter or a nickname for a big man.3: English (Yorkshire): variant of Baulk from Middle English balke ‘ridge or bank created by plowing’ (Old English balca) or a habitational name from a place called with this word for example Balk near Thirsk in the North Yorkshire.\n\nBalkema : Dutch (mainly Groningen):: 1: patronymic formed with the Frisian suffix -ma ‘(one of the) men of’ from the personal name Balke a pet form of Bal.2: nickname for a carpenter from balk ‘beam’ (see Balk) composed with the same Frisian suffix as in 1 above.3: habitational name for someone from the hamlet Balk near Grotegast the village Balk in Gaasterland Balkbrug (Ooststellingwerf) or Balkend (Leeuwarderadeel).\n\nBallentine : Scottish: habitational name probably from the lands of Bellenden now Bellendean on Ale Water west of Roberton in Roxburghshire. John Ballantyne archdeacon of Moray 1533–38 was also recorded as John Ballentyne or Bellenden. It has been suggested that the placename is from Gaelic baile an deadhain ‘the dean's farm’ which leaves open the possibility of more than one geographical origin (there is also a place called Bellenden in Selkirk); the surname is persistently associated with Falkirk and Edinburgh as well as Roxburghshire. The origin of the variation between -d- and -t- if genuine is unknown.\n\nBalram : Indian: from a personal name denoting the older brother of the god Krishna an avatar of the god Vishnu. It means ‘Ram the strong one’ referring to his legendary muscular strength and penchant for using farm equipment (notably the plow) as weaponry. This surname is found mainly in Guyana and also in South Africa and Trinidad and Tobago. It is apparently not used in India.\n\nBanchero : Italian (Genoa): occupational name from banchero ‘banker’ or from Genoese bancà ‘carpenter’. This surname is also established in Spain.\n\nBanh : Vietnamese (Bành): from the Chinese surname 彭 see Peng 1.\n\nBarabas : Hungarian and Spanish (Barabás); Polish (Barabaś); Czech (Barabáš); Slovak (also Barabás and Barabáš); Serbian Croatian and Slovenian (Barabaš): from the New Testament personal name Barabbas meaning ‘son of Abba’ or ‘son of the father’ in Aramaic. This was the name borne by the thief whose life was demanded by the crowd in Jerusalem in preference to that of Jesus (Matthew 27:15–21). In central Europe it came to be used as a personal name with reference to a reformed or repentant sinner one whose life had been saved by Jesus's self-sacrifice. The surname Barabás or Barabas of Hungarian origin is also found in Romania where it is also spelled Barabaş. In North America the surname Barabas is also an altered form of the Polish variant Barabasz.\n\nBard : 1: English (of Norman origin) and French: from the Old French personal name Bard(e) ancient Germanic Bardo from barta ‘battle axe’. This was borne as a surname by a prominent Norman family with lands in west Normandy and in various English and Scottish counties including Essex Hertfordshire North Yorkshire Northumberland and Lanarkshire. In Scotland the original family were Norman landowners in Strathaven parish in Lanarkshire.
