Are all the bitswap exchange, swarm blocks encrypted/decrypted when sent/received?\n\nI was following the code and saw the secure_conn but couldn’t find the place of encryption. Digging more, I only found some handshakes and identity verification based on the Peer ID and Pub key.\n\nAre the data sent over the wire visible to everyone or? As far I see a TCP connection is being used right?\n\nThe following doc is also not very useful: https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/blob/master/docs/transports.md\n\nThx\n\nHey @stebalien i went through the secio library as well as all the links over here: https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p-secio/issues/7 but I can’t find the place in code where IPFS is actually performing data encryption.\n\nAs far I see the Secio library is handling authentication of the peers but the connection itself is still TCP without encrypting the blocks."
