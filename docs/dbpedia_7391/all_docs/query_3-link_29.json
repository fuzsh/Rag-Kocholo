Bert Ladd ‘49 (Inducted in absentee)\n\nBert grew up in Mid-continent oil country where his father began working on cable tool drilling rigs in his ‘teens after dropping out of school. Jerry Ladd evolved into acquiring his own rudimentary cable tool drilling rig in his 30’s and pursued a career as an itinerate wildcatter. He raised capital for drilling in various local oil prospective areas in Kansas and Oklahoma, choosing sites using very rudimentary early-day geology, usually founded by drilling on top of surface expressed anticlines or perhaps guided by a local farmer’s mention of having seen oil slick on a nearby stream. He never made the ‘big strike’ as did some of the other old timers like Harry Sinclair, Tom Skelly, H. L. Hunt, etc. At age 50 Bert’s father Jerry died in a drilling rig accident.\n\nBert himself worked as a roustabout on rigs and in the field throughout his ‘teen years and for a year following high school graduation.

In 1976 Utah merged into General Electric Company via a tax-free stock exchange----\n\nat that time this $2.5 billion deal was the largest ever USA corporate merger. LPC thereby became even more active in its new status as an autonomous subsidiary of GE. Bert remained as CEO through 1979 when he resigned his corporate positions to return to world of Independent Operators. At 87 he now says he has not nor will he ever retire, rather he restructures to fit the times of the ‘World’ and of his ‘Life’.\n\nBert has served on various corporate and institutional boards including Ladd Petroleum Corporation, Utah International, Denver University, Presbyterian Medical Center (Denver), Whiting Petroleum Corporation, The Aksel Johnson Group, a large international privately owned industrial and shipping company in Stockholm.

Winn Chair in the School of Chemical, Biological and Materials Engineering at the University of Oklahoma. He served as the director of CBME for 16 years, from 1998 to 2014, when he returned to full time teaching and research. His current research activities focus on catalytic conversion of biomass to liquid fuels and chemicals. He is the author or co-author of over 65 archival journal articles, three patents, and numerous technical presentations and seminars.\n\nHis research focuses on catalysis and reaction engineering. His group combines experimental measurement with theoretical analyses of reaction mechanisms in order to better understand and improve catalytic and non-catalytic chemical reaction processes. The operating conditions of the reacting systems studied include gas phase reactions at\n\ntemperatures up to 800°C, liquid phase reactions at room temperature and below, solid biomass reactions over a range of temperatures, photocatalytic reactions and reactions in cold plasmas. The experimental techniques have included steady and unsteady (transient) state kinetics measurements, adsorbed species identification using diffuse reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and measurement of isotopic species using mass spectrometry.\n\nHis current research involves thermochemical conversion of biomass to fuels and chemicals. He is investigating both conversion of natural fats and oils to diesel fuel and petrochemicals, and conversion of lignocellulosic biomass to hydrocarbon fuels and chemicals. Although the “refining” of biomass has analogies to refining of petroleum, biomass is highly oxygenated, and conversion to hydrocarbons requires new catalysts, reactors and reaction conditions that differ greatly from those used in petroleum refining. A huge challenge in development of these biomass conversion systems is the smaller scale at which they must operate due to the distributed nature of biomass resources.\n\nDr. Lobban has received multiple teaching and service awards at the University of Oklahoma at the department, college and university level, including the Mortar Board Top Ten Faculty Award, the University of Oklahoma Presidential Professorship, the Board of Regents Award for Superior Teaching, and the departmental outstanding instructor award more than ten times.\n\nLance has served as a member on the C&PE advisory board since 1996.

His professional career was almost entirely with Dow Corning and involved a very diverse set of responsibilities in different management positions. His successes and personal recognition from the company, as demonstrated by his appointment to several positions of very significant responsibility, exemplify what can be accomplished in professional work by a chemical engineer. Notable positions which he held with Dow Corning are described in what follows.\n\nEarly in his career he served as President and CEO of Dow Corning, Mexico, an introduction to management of a chemical company in the international sphere. Then in 1992 he was named Executive Director for Health and Safety, a role in which he served for two years as the Dow Corning point person interacting with the FDA and EPA during company lawsuits involving silicone breast implants. In this position he was a key person in decisions involving billions of dollars. A following very notable appointment was as Corporate Vice President, and President and CEO of Dow Corning Asia, a position which he held for six years. This company was active in the People’s Republic of China and South Korea. The very large company, approximately 700 employees, had a revenue stream on the order of one billion dollars. During this period, he also served as Board Chairman of Hemlock Semiconductor, the world’s largest producer of polycrystal silicon for the chip industry (joint Dow Corning venture with 2/3 ownership). In a final phase of his work, he was a member of the Dow Corning Investment Committee which has fiduciary and investment responsibility for benefit and pension plans with a value on the order of two billion dollars.\n\nFollowing retirement, since 2013 Rich has served on the Leelanau County, Michigan Conservancy Board, Executive and Finance Committees which advises on land purchases and development easements for watersheds, farmland and animal migration corridors.

His sister Alicia, and his brother-in-law Roger Rieder (both are here) are also KU\n\ngraduates. In retirement, Rich and Beth reside on the Leelanau peninsula in Northwest Michigan.\n\nInducted 2019\n\nTodd Slawson ’84 (Slawson Exploration Co.)\n\nMr. Robert Todd Slawson received his B.Sc. degree in Petroleum Engineering from our department in 1984. He became employed by Slawson Exploration Company in 1984 and worked one year in North Dakota before settling in in Denver, Colorado. He became Division Operations Manager in 1988 and now serves as President of Slawson Exploration. He is the youngest of the three sons of Donald C. Slawson who founded Slawson Exploration and many other companies. Todd has drilled over 800 operated wells (mostly horizontal) during his career in North Dakota, Montana, Wyoming, Nebraska, Colorado and California. Don Slawson drilled over 3,500 operated wells in his career – mostly vertical wells in Kansas, Oklahoma and the Texas Panhandle.\n\nTodd and his team have been innovators his entire career. In his California exploration and drilling days, he quickly improved vertical drilling time from 30 days to 5 days and found enough bypassed gas, utilizing the newer 3D seismic technology, to become the number one gas producer in California. In 1989, his Williston Basin career led him to be one of the first to drill a horizontal Bakken Shale well. That well, called the Sidewinder #1-7H, with a 1000’ lateral, made national news, as it was the horizontal well that finally “cracked the code” in the Bakken with an IP of over 1,300 BOPD. The syndicated news story headline was “Dakota Find May Be Significant,” but no one knew how significant the Sidewinder well would become. The Bakken is now estimated to produce over 30 billion barrels of oil over its lifetime.\n\nTodd has continued innovating in the Bakken play throughout its development. He started with unfrac’d laterals, progressed to open hole fracs and improved to stage fracs—setting a world record in 2012 with 47 frac stages per lateral, while most companies had less than 10 stages. He has also experimented with other completion techniques such as cemented liners, pounds of sand per foot, sliding sleeves, slick water, perf clusters, and diverters. These completion changes have almost doubled the ultimate recoveries per well since the beginning of the play and have made uneconomic fringes of the Bakken region now profitable.\n\nIn terms of service to KU, Todd was instrumental in founding the Earth, Energy, and Environmental Center (EEEC) at the University of Kansas. Completed in January 2018, the EEEC is anchored by Slawson Hall, which is a tribute to Todd’s father. The EEEC is highly relevant to the integration of petroleum engineering and geology, the two disciplines most significant to the successful discovery and exploitation of oil and gas reserves. The Center transforms the approach to interdisciplinary study at KU. With Todd now based in Denver and Slawson Exploration now focusing on the Bakken in North Dakota and Montana, it would have been easy for him to migrate away from the Kansas legacy established by three previous generations. To the contrary, he doubled down on the Kansas, KU, and higher education legacies by making Slawson Hall and the EEEC a reality for future Jayhawks. Todd also serves on the KU Endowment Association (KUEA) Board of Trustees. Todd Slawson has made stellar contributions to the oil and gas industry, was and is an engineering innovator, has been a fervent supporter of KU and the C&PE Department, and represents a legacy we would like to encourage our alumni to continue.\n\nInducted 2020\n\nMarylee Southard, (University of Kansas)\n\nPerry's Chemical Engineers' Handbook (9th Ed.)
