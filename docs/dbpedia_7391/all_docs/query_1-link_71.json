        "text": "Now in its 44th year, Tilles Center continues its commitment to entertain, inspire an enrich the community through arts performance, education and advocacy.\n\nThis fall, Tilles Center will join over 100 Long Island musicians, music executives and venues--from Billy Joel and Pat Benatar to Harry Chapin and Lou Reed--as it is inducted into the Long Island Music and Entertainment Hall of Fame.\n\nIn celebration of this great honor, Tilles Center joins the Long Island community in gratefully acknowledging the dedicated leadership of both the Tilles Family and past and present members of Tilles Center's Board of Advisors for nearly 50 years of exceptional world-class performances and arts education programs.\n\nFor sponsorship and registration inquiries, or to purchase gala tickets by phone or email, contact Erin Bevan, Advancement Coordinator, erin.bevan@liu.edu or 516.299.3825. Tilles Center is a non-profit organization. Contributions are tax-deductible to the extent allowed by law.\n\nAbout the Show\n\nWith very special guests JEFF BABKO AND THE STEEP CANYON RANGERS\n\nSteve Martin and Martin Short’s “The Dukes of Funnytown!” is a show that redefines the form in unexpected and profound ways, from two of the funniest, most influential and acclaimed talents of the past century. Their humor is often subversive, but it is always a joyous self-deprecating romp from two comedy masters driven to make each other laugh as much as the audience. The jokes come at you at a rapid-fire pace with little set-up and big punch lines as they mock Hollywood and the fickle nature of celebrity, but the comedy truly soars when they lovingly (and relentlessly) roast each other. Martin and Short’s chemistry and timing on stage reflects a friendship forged over three decades which developed when they met for the first time on the set of the 1986 film “Three Amigos.” These two titans of comedy have been touring together since 2015, when they launched their first live show entitled “A Very Stupid Conversation.”\n\nProceeds from Tilles Center's Gala Underwrite its Mission\n\nProceeds from Tilles Center's Gala help underwrite its enduring mission to inspire, engage and educate the Long Island community through arts performance, education and advocacy. Tilles Center, a non-profit organization, is committed to presenting the world’s finest artists across all genres including music, dance, comedy and theater. We seek to explore innovation within the disciplines and are committed to a perspective that is inclusive and equitable. We believe that the performing arts are uniquely capable of fostering communication and understanding among people, supporting social and emotional health, and demonstrating the highest potential for human achievement.\n\nIn addition to presenting world-class performances, Tilles Center proudly supports tens of thousands of children and adult learners each year through its meaningful and impactful arts education programs. The focus is on providing arts experiences to underserved communities — from low-income school districts and those on the autism spectrum to local seniors.\n\nView More on Arts Education"
