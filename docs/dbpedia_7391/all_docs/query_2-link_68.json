        "text": "Leading cryptography researchers and industry experts discuss impact of crypto modernization and Suite B and the growing use of ECC in commercial applications\n\nMISSISSAUGA, Ontario - (Sept. 27, 2007) – Certicom Corp. (TSX: CIC) today announced that Dr. Martin Hellman, one of the leading experts on cryptography and co-inventor of public key cryptography, will speak at “ECC: Simply the Best,” the fourth annual Certicom ECC Conference, November 13-15 in Toronto, Canada. Dr. Hellman is Professor Emeritus of Electrical Engineering at Stanford University.\n\nIn his keynote address, entitled, “A Fool's Errand: Inventing Public Key Cryptography,” Dr. Hellman will recount his early days in studying cryptography and discovering public key cryptography. He will share with participants what brought him to cryptography; why he disregarded conventional wisdom; the roles of Whitfield Diffie and Ralph Merkle (his co-inventors), RSA, and NSA; and the thought sequence that led to pubic key cryptography.\n\nThe Certicom ECC Conference offers a forum for discussing real-world applications of cryptography, evolving security standards and pure mathematics. This year, session speakers will discuss Suite B cryptanalysis; application interoperability; the transition between ECC and RSA; Suite B product applications; ECC applications in electronic commerce, content protection, mobility, wireless networks, RFID and enterprise software; and ECC implementation, optimization and benchmarking.\n\n“We are honored to have one of the true luminaries in cryptography at our conference,” said Dr. Scott Vanstone, Certicom founder and EVP strategic technology. “Martin Hellman will give us a special perspective on today’s security challenges. We look forward to hearing his views on the industry.”\n\nECC is used in a growing number of industries – ranging from consumer electronics, wireless devices and semiconductors to financial services and government. The U.S. Government (through the National Security Agency's Suite B initiative) has identified ECC-based security mechanisms as the recommended technology for protecting government communications. ECC implementations are used to protect content, securely transmit data and digitally sign documents. The small size of ECC algorithms is the main driver behind its popularity as it provides savings in terms of time, memory, bandwidth, and energy consumption.\n\nFor more information about the Certicom ECC Conference or to register, visit: www.certicom.com/conference2007\n\nABOUT CERTICOM\n\nCerticom protects the value of content, applications and devices with government-approved security. Adopted by the National Security Agency (NSA) for government communications, Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) provides the most security per bit of any known public-key scheme. As the global leader in ECC, Certicom security offerings are currently licensed to more than 300 customers including General Dynamics, Motorola, Oracle, Research In Motion and Unisys. Founded in 1985, Certicom's corporate offices are in Mississauga, Ontario, Canada with worldwide sales and marketing headquarters in Reston, Virginia and offices in the U.S., Canada, Europe and China.
