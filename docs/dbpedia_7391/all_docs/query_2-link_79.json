        "text": "Modern cryptology was sparked by the groundbreaking work of Martin Hellman, a professor at Stanford University, and two graduate students who worked with him in 1974 and 1975, Ralph Merkle and Whitfield Diffie (see Figure 1). In April 1976, they started to publish their work in three papers [3, 4, 9], which revealed the concept of public key cryptography to the public. The work of Diffie and Hellman, which is now referred to as Diffie–Hellman key agreement, allows two people, or more properly their computers, to agree upon a secret key if they have only exchanged authenticated public keys of each other in the first place. Before Public Key Cryptography, it was unanimously agreed in the cryptography community that the only way for two parties to establish secure communications was to first exchange a secret key of some kind. This seemed to be simple common sense: if the recipients didn't have a secret to give them some leverage, how could they be in a better position to decrypt the...\n\nRights and permissions\n\nReprints and permissions\n\nCopyright information\n\n© 2005 International Federation for Information Processing\n\nAbout this entry\n\nCite this entry\n\nBleumer, G.
