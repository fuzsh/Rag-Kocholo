        "text": "I have been interested in cryptography, intermittently, since I was ten. When I was ten years old, I had a teacher, named Mary Collins, in primary school who taught us one day about simple cryptosystems and I was fascinated and I got my father to get me all of the books on the subject from the City College Library in New York. It occurs to me now as I say it that there are books I do not remember from that collection that that library ought to have had because they were written at City College, but maybe I just don't remember them. And in any event I read all the children's books and I tried to read Helen Gaines' book \"Cryptanalysis\" and didn't succeed. As a matter of fact I have yet to read Helen Gaines' book. I was interested for a short period of time and I didn't do a great deal.\n\nThen, when I was a teenager I was very interested in military matters but for some reason I recall that cryptography seemed vulgar to me. I thought that everyone was interested in cryptography. I was interested in more esoteric things. And so I didn't pursue it again at that time.\n\nBut, while I was at MIT every now and then I would learn some little tidbit, something would come up and somebody would mention something interesting and after I graduated, I went to work for a company called Mitre and there my boss told me in fact how modern cryptosystems work, that is that they generate a keystream in exclusive or it with the plaintext.\n\nAnd I began thinking about cryptography. At the time I was working in the Artificial Intelligence Lab at MIT, which was cheek by jowl with the Multics project, which is a big computer timesharing project with some very substantial security ambitions. They had the problem that they required you to trust other people, because if a subpoena came for your files from a court it would go to the system programmers who would not be interested in going to prison in order to protect your files. So I thought that cryptography was a technique that did not require your trusting other people. That if you encrypted your files, then if a court wanted your files they would have to come and threaten you and you would have the control to make the choice as to whether you would surrender your files or not.\n\nI began talking about the importance of cryptography to people but I didn't do any work on it at that time because I wasn't really interested in it, I was working on problems I considered more important, and I tried to talk a number of people into working on cryptography and they subsequently have wished that I had succeeded in talking them into it, but nothing happened for another two or three years. And then in 1972 I had moved here to the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory at Stanford, I was working with, under John McCarthy on proof and correctness of programs. Our money was coming from a man named Larry Roberts, who was the head of the information processing techniques office of something called ARPA which supported most of computer science. Roberts wanted to have cryptographic protection on the Arpanet. So he approached NSA and, for reasons I have never understood, NSA rebuffed him because he was, NSA construed its customers very narrowly at the time, in essence it only worked for the military. But, he was the head of a hundred million dollar a year military research budget and why they said no to him, I don't know. I need to ask him, he now lives near here. But he went for some reason I also do not understand, to my boss, John McCarthy and asked him for assistance for his problem. And John McCarthy and Ralph Goren, who was his chief system programmer, and a woman named Peggy Waters with whom I was living, cooked up a cryptographic system, and I began thinking about this system. My assessment of the application of cryptography in the security of timesharing systems prior to this had been that it had to be built in and it had to run fast enough that it wasn't any inconvenience. And in general what happened is that encrypting a file multiplied the copying time by about a hundred and, therefore, nobody ever did it. And so I began studying this algorithm, mostly examining its complexity, not its cryptanalytic strength and I gradually became willing to do what I had never been willing to do before. Wanting to study cryptography and if had there been a book on the mathematic shelf, a modern book on it on the mathematic shelf in the bookstore, I would have bought one, but I didn't feel like reading. I've always been very sensitive to notation and style, at least I was at that time, I found it very hard always studying modern books on analysis. I like to read about Banach spaces and I didn't like to read the details and the sequences. But I gradually became willing to read the classical literature of cryptography.\n\nI studied David Kahn's book, I started late in the fall of '72, I read very slowly. By the spring of '73 I was doing nothing but working on cryptography and John McCarthy was fed up with me and we separated. I took a leave of absence and I began travelling around the country.\n\nFirst thing happened is I met my wife in New Jersey and we began travelling together and in the summer of 1974 we went to the IBM Laboratory at Yorktown Heights [N.Y.]. That had the only significant non-governmental cryptographic group in the country at the time, that's the group that designed DES [Data Encryption Standard]. And I spoke to Allen Konheim who was very secretive, he didn't want to tell me anything. He only told me one thing, and since then he wishes he hadn't said that. He said: An old friend of mine, named Martin Hellman, was here a few months ago, and he's out at Stanford, and two people can work on a problem better than one, and so when you get back to Stanford, you should look him up. So I got back to Stanford in the fall of 1974 and I called Marty Hellman and it just worked out wonderfully. Each of us found the other person the best informed person willing to talk about the subject he had yet run into and so we then worked together from the fall of 1974 until the fall of 1978. Really, the meeting was just amazing, not only did we get along, but I had come down to Stanford from the East Bay, we staying over in Oakland and Mary Fischer, my wife, had gone off to do something and Marty and I talked for an hour and then when she returned he invited us over to his house.\n\nMy wife is a great expert on animals and in particular on dogs. And it turns out that Marty's mother-in-law is a dog breeder and his wife knows a lot about dogs, all together as families we found a great deal in common. I began working casually with Marty and Marty found some, found a little bit of money to support me. And the spring of 1975 John McCarthy left and went to Japan. And his daughter was then, his younger daughter, was a little too young to be able to take care of herself here in California alone, because she didn't have a car, you can't go shopping, you can't get anywhere without a car, so we moved into John McCarthy's house which was very convenient, because I was living 200 meters uphill from Martin Hellman, and in a house that had what was at the time very rare, it had a good workstation and a high-speed connection with Artificial Intelligence Lab. My wife was working for British Petroleum up in San Francisco and I was just keeping house and staying home and thinking. Quite a number of things happened at this point, several people play a role.\n\nI should back up actually. Back up to something that happened, amusing to me, in the summer of 1974. I spent most of the summer in Cambridge, Massachusetts, which, I mentioned I visited Yorktown Heights, that was a day trip, it's a two hour drive down there. And Jim Reeds, who is one of the smartest people in cryptography, was as graduate student then in statistics at Harvard. Jim Reeds was holding a seminar on cryptography and I went to it and I took a friend named Bill Mann who was working on a cryptographic project for a communications company and he was interested in acquiring background, because it was a bizarre business at the time, you could be working on cryptographic projects for the government, still they wouldn't tell you anything about what they wanted you to do. He went there just to learn stuff. And we explained the notion of a one-way function to Bill and he misunderstood it. And his understanding was what we would now call a trapdoor one-way function. I wrote this down in my notes and we all speculated, we thought it would be very hard to build one. We were not sure if you could build one, and we weren't sure what use it was and we forgot about it. Years later, I found in my notes.\n\nI was doing a couple of things. In the summer of '73 in some sense, public key was discovered, as far as I can tell there, but the discovery wasn't understood. I mean that happens with many things and I think that's the kind of thing you are interested in. How much influence I had I can't tell, you see, because at the time it seems to me I made the discovery I was not aware of that, it was only somewhat later when I was looking at my own note that I saw that that had been so. So then in the winter of '74 and spring of '75 I was at first living up in Oakland and then living at John McCarthy's house and Hellman and I were running a seminar, and I had gone to visit a man named Lance Hoffman, who is now at the George Washington University, he was up at Berkeley. I think he had done a Ph.D. thesis on some aspect of computer security and I had met him here at Stanford two or three years earlier and he said to me that he had a student named Peter Blatman who was interested in cryptography. And Blatman, it turned out, had been a friend (when Blatman was a child) of David Kahn. I talked to Blatman about cryptography and Blatman began to come to our seminar.\n\nI have to go back again. Basically, I have been working on the two problems, at this point in some sense for three years, one of them for 8 or 9 years, and one of them for 3, 4, 5 years. In 1965 somebody told me, mistakenly, as it turns out, that NSA, National Security Agency, the U.S. cryptologic organization, encrypted the telephones within its own building. That turns out that was not true but I believed this and I began to worry, to try to figure out what good it would do. Because I remember I had this view of cryptography in which the critical value of cryptography was that you didn't have to trust other people. And so I never understood the classical notion of a key distribution center, which is a trusted resource that you have to share. So I can now imagine how they might have done it at the time although it turns out they didn't do it. They really ran their phonelines in shielded conduit, it makes more sense. So I began worrying about how you could secure the whole North American telephone system. How could you ever have a spontaneous call between two people and have it secure?\n\nPeople have asked that question, I can't distinguish the two. I have always worked on what interests me. And what interests me I take, it has always struck me that one of the things that characterizes good intellectual work is a certain self importance. I remember noticing some years ago, I worked quite a while for Bell Northern Research, I was sitting at lunch with the people in my department and they were bullshiting about some things, they were talking about intellectual, sort of social problems, I don't know what the issues were, but it was clear to me that they regarded this as casual conversation. They just took it for granted, they couldn't do anything about this or they wouldn't make any contribution. And it struck me that that was in very sharp contrast to the style of conversation, particularly at MIT, I had grown up in, in which we believed, basically that, we didn't take ourselves lightly, if we were interested, our thinking about something was important, so when you ask was this an intellectual game, no more or less so than my interest in proof of correctness of programs.\n\nIn 1965 I started working at Mitre and the most interesting piece of work there was called Mathlab, symbolic mathematical manipulation system, which later eventually became Macsyma and I began working on that. I really didn't know anything at the time, I knew some mathematics, I didn't know anything about computers, I had to get into system programming and I began working on the compiler and then I learned about the notion of proof of correctness of programs and immediately it seemed to me, it still seems to me that that's maybe the most important problem in all modern engineering, so I began to think about that problem. Then John McCarthy came to town, John McCarthy was almost the only person at the time who understood the importance of that problem. So I talked to John McCarthy and he offered me a job and I moved out to Stanford. That was in 1969. My meeting with John McCarthy was late June '69.\n\nBy then, the work on proof of correctness had taken off, and lots of people were working on it, whereas when I came here, John McCarthy had about two graduate students and then one or two within the three years I was here, two or three more people arrived to work on the problem.\n\nIn a sense I really worked with nobody because my approach was entirely different from the approach of that group. John McCarthy is a formalist. He knows a lot of formal logic and so forth. We are compatible in the sense that I also knew a lot of formal logic and appreciated formal methods, but in retrospect what I was interested in is what would now be called programming methodology. His approach was take programming as it exists and figure out how to construct proofs about programs the type of objects we know now. My view of the matter was we clearly dump the program, the reason that large programs are so confusing is that we don't know how to write them, so I was trying to understand how you write programs better, so what I was doing, what most interested me was less formal, I did some work on proof checking and things like that and supported his activities but my real interest was in the organization of programs. The second when I arrived in late 1969 here at Stanford, John McCarthy had just written a paper on the subject of home terminals. And he envisioned people buying and selling and booking through home terminals and things like that. And I began to think about what, I don't know what the buzzword was at the time, about paperless offices. I couldn't understand what you would do to replace the signed document. So that's when I began thinking about, you know, what we now call the problem of digital signature. Because I reasoned that since written signatures depend critically on the fact that it is so hard to copy the document but since digital documents are always exactly copyable, how could you have a signature? In some sense, the interesting point is, I made one discovery that solved two problems, one of which I've been thinking about since 1965, and one of which I've been thinking about since 1969.\n\nBack to the fall of '74/'75. We were holding the seminar, I met this man Peter Blatman and he told me about Ralph Merkle. And this is discussed also in \"The First Ten Years of Public-Key Cryptography\". He said Merkle had been working on the problem of secure communication over a channel with somebody you'd never met before and I had thought about that problem for a long time. I was convinced you couldn't do it and I persuaded Blatman you couldn't do it. But I went back thinking about the problem. And so I think Merkle plays a very critical role.\n\nAs it turned out Merkle already probably knew how to do it at that time, but he saw the problem differently from the way I did. Merkle took Hoffman's class. Hoffman wanted everybody do a term paper, and he wanted a proposal for the term paper very early in the term. So Merkle submitted a proposal which is a paper about his key exchange system and Hoffman didn't understand it and Hoffman made him rewrite it and he still didn't understand it. And they got fed up with each other and Merkle left the class. And Hoffman threw away the chance to have the well known names read Merkle and Hoffman rather than Diffie and Hellman. And Merkle went on working on that problem and eventually wrote a paper that finally appeared as \"Secure communication over insecure channels\" about five years later [CACM 1978]. Part of the reason that it wasn't appreciated sooner is that Ralph Merkle didn't write very well. I have a draft somewhere, he wrote a hundred pages paper or something, it was very very hard to read. [1]\n\nAs I said, I was sitting, keeping house and thinking about working on these problems and I knew two different things. One, I was keeping a list of problems of what I called problems for an ambitious theory of cryptography, that is to say I didn't think of those at first as what I was working on, just whenever I've come across some problem that seemed to be very hard I would bring this down in this category. What I was interested in was the classical problem of producing secure conventional cryptosystems. I was thinking about the interaction of two things. One of the critical threads in modern cryptography is what is called the IFF problem, the Identification Friend or Foe problem. Horst Feistel, who was at Yorktown Heights, whom I did not meet on that occasion, I did not meet him for years later, but I talked to a man named Allen Tritter who was working with that group who had spoken a lot with Feistel. And Tritter told me that Feistel had this criterion he called the IFF criterion for the strength of a cryptographic system of what we know call the chosen plaintext condition. When I went back to Cambridge, I met a man named Peter Schweitzer, who had worked for Horst Feistel 20 years earlier, in the 1950s. And so I learned something about the problem that they had worked on, this problem of IFF. And I recognized that that protected you against an eavesdropper who intercepted the communication on the channel. I had been thinking for a year or two at that time about the problem of the one-way functions and login. I was interested in that for two reasons. Mostly because, that was in my mind most simplest cryptographic problem. If you could prove that something was a one-way function that was the most practical thing to attack, that was purely cryptographic. It seemed to me these two techniques protected you against two different threats. One threat was the compromise of the authentication information, and that's why it was done in computers, where the computer itself was quite vulnerable. And the other was the eavesdropping on the channel. So I was setting out to try to evolve a protocol for combining the two phenomena. That led me first to realize that you could have a digital signature, that you could have somebody who could judge the answer to a question that he couldn't answer himself and I cooked up a scheme for doing that, it turned out to be not any good. I reflected on that in this paper I was writing about protocols. I kept on thinking about that.\n\nWe back up again. In March 1975 the DES proposal appeared in the Federal Register. I immediately, the political problem with DES is one I have never been able to solve, because I did not understand how those people dared either standardize a secure system or standardize a non-secure system, because if it was secure - since they were primarily an intelligence agency - they would be afraid that they wouldn't be able to read other people's traffic. If it was not secure, since they had certified it for the use of U.S. government organizations, they risk having a tremendous black eye if it were broken. So I didn't understand what they could do.\n\nAnd the minute it appeared, I envisioned what I called a trapdoor cryptosystem. And it now seems, looking at Shamir's work that this is much closer to the truth than I imagined it could be at the time. I imagined a cryptosystem with two properties. The first property was the one that DES appears to have. It is one element in a space in which good cryptosystems are sparse and therefore, if you alter it, you are likely to get a worse cryptosystem. So in some sense there is no good cryptosystem close and having distance or some other method to each good cryptosystem, they are sparsely distributed. And in the second place, and this is not at all clear, this is what people usually mean by trapdoor, and it's not true of DES, that there was some secret information remembered in the design process that maybe even the good ones are breakable by the people who knew how they were designed. So I had that idea, that's one of the things I put in my list of problems for an ambitious theory of cryptography, I saw no hope for that one, I saw that problem as one to be solved after we'd figured out how to make provably secure systems. But in any event, some ten days, two weeks something after I thought this way of having an enhanced IFF so that the responder could answer in such a way that the challenger could judge the answer but could not have constructed the answer. I realized this could be turned around to solve the problem that had been aching in the back of my head for 9 years, 10 years. Then, if you had this asymmetry, then and I don't know about the terms, if I had this public key of your's, it could be turned round, so I can send you a message, even though I have never talked to you before. I had not at the time sorted out the authentication issues from the secrecy issues. I think that's one of the most important threads in the later history of this.\n\nUnfortunately, in that moment I realized that I'd discovered something important and I was acutely aware that the computer on which I was keeping my notes was not secure so I didn't write it in my file of ambitious problems so I've lost the exact date of that problem, it's some time in May 1975, I believe. If possible, looking at notes would tell us more and I haven't looked back at my old records there, they're sort of buried, but what I did, I think I first told it to my wife when she came home from work and then I walked down the hill and I told it to Marty Hellman and it took me about 45 minutes to explain it, to convince Marty that it was true; I didn't have an example of it at the time I was trying to convince him that something could be done and he immediately had the invitation from Jim Massey to write a paper for the Transactions on Information Theory. And he immediately said how would you like to join me in writing this paper [both laugh]. Marty is a very good talent scout. That's when we began working on that problem. That's in essence all of what I called the pre-history. Then as we thought about this for several months and we wrote a paper that eventually appeared in the National Computer Conference in 1976, and that was written in December 1975. And we sent preprints around and we deadlined a submission for the conference very early, had to give in before Christmas, or by January, 1st. or something like that and immediately we sent the preprints around very widely and I gave one to Blatman who gave it to Merkle. And Merkle, who had been beating his head against a stonewall for years, suddenly realized, here were people who would understand what he was talking about. So Merkle then got in contact with us, he called me because I lived in Berkeley and sent Marty Hellman a copy of his paper, because Hellman was farther away. And, once again Hellman was a very good talent scout, he immediately recognized that Merkle was a very smart person. And Merkle was a graduate student in computer science at Berkeley and Hellman offered him support at Stanford and he moved, because he had no particular advisor to work with at Berkeley. At that point we began to get active, another graduate student named Steve Pohlig began working on cryptography. So there were four or so of us and we had an active group working at Stanford.\n\nThe most original person I can identify in this case is Merkle. Merkle had the earliest claim. I had been thinking about the problems for the longest period of time. So I have one kind of claim to being the earliest. Bill Mann had enunciated the solution earliest on, but he didn't understand it and none of us who listened to him understood it, which is another sort of claim. Merkle had the first thing which is really any sort of a solution to the problem: the Merkle-puzzle system. It is a remarkable object, because it might even be practical in some channels. The argument for its security is exceedingly clear, although it is a reductionist argument, depends on having primitives with simpler properties, but properties we don't know how to prove. It is utterly resistant to being improved in its work factor to where it's of use on most channels. I never cease to be amazed by the puzzles system, it's a fantastic discovery.\n\nAnd then I got a message, there is a very smart man, named Peter Deutsch, who is now, a little more recently than I am, working for Sun, and he sent me a message in 1976 or '77. He sent me a message saying what's known about cryptosystems with the following property and spelled out the public key property. Since he didn't think about cryptography he hadn't had the mental block against what seems in a way some obvious. There is nothing wrong with these asymmetries. It's just the way that people were used to thinking about cryptography made them think that was difficult to do. So I sent him back a message, saying we call these public key cryptosystems, we know the following things about them. I think if we hadn't discovered it, somebody else would have within a very short period of time, because we were thinking of the requirements of a digital signature, became sort of clear and once you began thinking about authentification problems in computer networks. We were staying with Leslie Lamport, also now with the DEC center of systems research, over here, a couple of blocks away. At some time, fall of '75 I think, he asked me questions about this, he seemed to have thought of these things as problems. And I couldn't tell how much had come from talking to me because I hadn't talked to him about it a great deal."
