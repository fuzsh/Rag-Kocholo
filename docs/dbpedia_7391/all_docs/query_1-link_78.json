        "text": "Economic analysis is essential to understanding modern global affairs. In the International Economics (IECO) major, students investigate how economic decision-making produces social change across the world.\n\nIECO majors study the behavior of social systems and actors — from markets, corporations and unions to international institutions, government actors and even families — through unified frameworks that combine quantitative techniques with qualitative analysis.\n\nThis approach can be applied to international affairs in numerous ways, providing valuable insights in topics such as trade policy, international economic organizations, economic growth and development, international financial markets, financial crises and international migration. Students who select the IECO major will:\n\nLearn about the central tenets of microeconomic and macroeconomic theory\n\nEngage with statistical analysis and its international applications\n\nInvestigate fundamentals of international trade and finance\n\nPursue original projects with a focus on elements of compelling research and writing\n\nAcademics Anchor\n\nAcademics\n\nThrough SFS courses in international economic theory, policy, finance, commerce, growth, transition and development, students in the International Economics major gain a deep understanding of how economic systems and processes impact the world.\n\nBack to Top\n\nDeep Dive into Economics\n\nEconomic theory courses provide students with the quantitative skills necessary to conduct economic and statistical analysis. These classes provide a strong foundation for students who want to pursue careers in areas such as international development, applied econometrics and international trade by providing a foundation for higher-level coursework in these subject areas. The courses are also valued by students considering potential graduate study in economics.\n\nInternational finance and commerce courses prepare students for successful careers in business, finance and consulting. These courses also pair well with those offered by the Landegger Program in International Business Diplomacy, an honors certificate program that prepares students for business careers in the international arena.\n\nFor students interested in development work, courses in economic growth, transition and development provide a solid foundation for a career working in development or in transitioning economies around the world.\n\nLastly, students in the major can pursue higher-level courses in mathematics to ensure that they have a strong foundation in quantitative skills.\n\nSharpen Research and Writing Skills\n\nAt SFS, all students gain a thorough grounding in written and verbal communication skills, enabling graduates to explain their ideas and work to diverse global audiences. IECO majors will also add a number of mathematical and statistical tools to their analytical repertoire. Building on the base of the SFS core curriculum, upper-level IECO classes enable students to become adept at working with a range of sources to understand the economic factors driving the modern world.\n\nSenior Thesis\n\nIn IECO, students embark on a number of independent research projects, culminating in the opportunity to write a senior thesis. Working alongside an expert faculty advisor, IECO majors identify a research question, gather data and sources, analyze results and communicate their findings in a robust piece of original work which they will then present to faculty and peers. Many IECO students have published or presented their thesis research in various academic and industry forums.\n\nStudent Experience Anchor\n\nStudent Experience\n\nIECO majors take advantage of SFS’s unique position in Washington, DC, and our connections around the world, to gain hands-on experience in international economics. Many students hone their skills and knowledge through DC-based internships that they can complete during the semester alongside their studies, while study abroad programs and undergraduate research initiatives, such as the Carroll Round, enable students to pursue research and learning opportunities they are passionate about.\n\nBack to Top\n\nStudy in the Heart of Washington, DC\n\nOur location in Washington, DC gives students a front-row seat to the latest events in domestic and international affairs. IECO students can engage with national and international financial institutions in both the public and private sectors. They have the opportunity to work and engage with multinational corporations and regulatory agencies based in the nation’s capital. IECO students also have lots of opportunities to relax in Washington, DC, whether it’s by indulging a unique passion for currency through a tour at the U.S. Mint or catching a concert with friends at the Kennedy Center.\n\nLearn more about student life in DC.\n\nInternational Opportunities\n\nThrough SFS and Georgetown’s extensive study abroad and internship options, IECO students can observe international economic dynamics in action by immersing themselves in the environment of a particular country or organization. In the past five years, IECO majors have studied abroad at the London School of Economics and the University of Oxford in the UK, Sciences-Po in Paris and numerous other locations in Europe, Asia and Latin America.\n\nLearn more about international opportunities at SFS.\n\nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion\n\nAt the very core of every major is a commitment to recognizing and celebrating cultural diversity and fostering an inclusive environment for all students. SFS is dedicated to welcoming students from all backgrounds to our community and the SFS Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) Office leads school-wide efforts to enhance DEI in the SFS curriculum, faculty and recruitment of students and staff.\n\nNo matter their background or interests, students are sure to find like-minded and supportive peers here on the Hilltop. Whether through campus ministry, student groups or engaging with neighbors in DC, you can find your community at Georgetown.\n\nFind out more about DEI at SFS.\n\nFaculty Anchor\n\nFaculty\n\nIECO faculty have more than just academic expertise to share with their students. Faculty in the major have been at the forefront of shaping global economies, whether as senior economists at the World Bank, former international trade negotiators or as top advisors to the federal government on industrial organization.\n\nBack to Top\n\n“IECO students amplify with their enthusiasm every new course I teach. With their spirit of inquiry, they always end up teaching me something in return.”\n\nDr. Lidia Ceriani, IECO Faculty Member\n\nIECO Faculty\n\nIECO Curricular Dean\n\nRecent Faculty Publications\n\nLidia Ceriani, “Excess Mortality as a Predictor of Mortality Crises: The Case of COVID-19 in Italy,” Global Labor Organization, (2020)\n\nJenny Guardado Rodriguez, “The long-run influence of institutions governing trade: Evidence from smuggling ports in colonial Mexico,” Journal of Development Economics (2020)\n\nShareen Joshi, “The Intersections of Women’s Economic and Reproductive Empowerment,” Feminist Economics (2020)\n\nArik Levinson, “America’s regressive wealth tax: state and local property taxes,” Applied Economic Letters (2020)\n\nRodney Ludema, “The sword and the shield: The economics of targeted sanctions,” European Economic Review (2020)\n\nJoel Simmons, “Detecting anomalies in data on government violence,” Political Science Research and Methods (2021)\n\nCareers & Alumni Anchor\n\nCareers & Alumni\n\nThe IECO major prepares students for careers and leadership positions in the public or private sectors or in multilateral institutions. Alumni have built successful careers in finance, consulting, law, management, media, international development, international organizations, research institutes, government, non-profit organizations and academia.\n\nBack to Top\n\nBuilding a Career at Georgetown\n\nWith DC on your doorstep, students can pursue career opportunities that can take them all over the world. IECO students take advantage of the many internship opportunities here in the capital to begin building real-world work experience even before they graduate.\n\nAt Georgetown, students connect with the Cawley Career Education Center, where they can meet with professional advisors who can help with everything from developing a perfect resume to nailing job interviews and exploring how to break into a new industry or field. And the Hoya network students build throughout their time at Georgetown can help unlock new opportunities throughout their careers.\n\nIECO Alumni Spotlight"
