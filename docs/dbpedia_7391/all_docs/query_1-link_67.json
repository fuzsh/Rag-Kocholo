        "text": "On September 24, 2019, the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom (UKSC) unanimously invalidated U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s attempt to suspend (or “prorogue”) Parliament. The UKSC’s decision, R (Miller) v. Prime Minister (Miller/Cherry), was a political thunderclap, contributing to the U.K.’s political turmoil over its exit from the European Union, or “Brexit.” But the legal crux of Miller/Cherry was justiciability: was the Prime Minister’s decision to prorogue parliament a non-justiciable political question? Despite this question’s centrality to the case, few commentators have analyzed the Miller/Cherry decision through the lens of the political question doctrine, an area of law held largely in common between the United States and the U.K. Likewise, scholarly analysis has failed to explore the striking contrast between Miller/Cherry and Rucho v. Common Cause, the U.S. Supreme Court’s most recent foray into the political question doctrine.\n\nThis Comment does both. Miller/Cherry adopted a narrow understanding of the political question doctrine and instead embraced a robust vision of judicial review which closely resembles that of famed mid-century law professor Herbert Wechsler. The U.S. Supreme Court’s recent decision in Rucho v. Common Cause, however, took the opposite approach. Where Miller/Cherry offered a full-throated Wechslerian defense of the judiciary’s obligation to police constitutional constraints, Rucho channeled Wechsler’s contemporary and frequent interlocutor Alexander Bickel. Holding that challenges to partisan gerrymandering are not justiciable, Rucho, following Bickel, emphasized institutional humility and the need for courts to act cautiously in light of the “counter-majoritarian difficulty.”\n\nMiller/Cherry and Rucho thus continue the great debate between Wechsler and Bickel, offering contradictory answers to the same foundational questions. Read together, they present a fascinating and transatlantic juxtaposition, illuminating key questions about the political question doctrine, judicial review, and the proper role of the courts.\n\nIntroduction\n\nOn September 24, 2019, the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom (UKSC) issued its decision in R (Miller) v. Prime Minister (Miller/Cherry), and British politics turned on its head. In an understated oral announcement and an unadorned written opinion, a unanimous Court held that Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s five-week suspension of Parliament—in Parliamentary jargon, “prorogation” —was unlawful and therefore void. The decision overturned the Prime Minister’s latest gambit in his duel with a recalcitrant House of Commons over “Brexit,” the U.K.’s planned exit from the European Union. Miller/Cherry was immediately controversial, prompting calls for the Prime Minister to resign, jubilant declarations that the rule of law had been vindicated, and accusations that the Court had perpetrated a “constitutional coup.”\n\nAlthough many British commentators have analyzed and criticized Miller/Cherry since its decision, the case has not received sustained or detailed attention on this side of the Atlantic. This lack of American attention is regrettable. Miller/Cherry holds important lessons for the American lawyer, especially through its striking contrast with recent decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nAlthough nominally about the Prime Minister’s prorogation of Parliament, Miller/Cherry was really about justiciability: could (or should) the Court decide the case in the first place? The UKSC’s answer to this question not only took sides in a long-standing debate about the proper role for courts in reviewing government action—it also did so in a way directly contrary to the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision three months prior in Rucho v. Common Cause. Whereas Miller/Cherry endorsed a robust judicial role and a correspondingly narrow political question doctrine—a perspective associated with famed mid-century academic Herbert Wechsler—Rucho emphasized constraint on judicial discretion and expressed a concern for institutional legitimacy, two hallmarks of the approach of Professor Alexander Bickel.\n\nAlthough decided on different sides of the Atlantic, these two cases are fundamentally about the same issue. Far from merely being a curious case from a foreign jurisdiction, Miller/Cherry lays bare the tensions inherent in the political question doctrine and in judicial review more broadly. Especially through its juxtaposition with Rucho v. Common Cause, Miller/Cherry provides an important perspective on judicial review and the judicial office in a time of heightened attention to the proper role of the courts."
