        "text": "The Diffie–Hellman protocol is a cryptographic protocol that allows parties to generate a shared secret cryptographic key by exchanging data over an insecure channel. The resulting key can be used to both encrypt and decrypt messages by means of symmetric algorithms.\n\nThe Diffie–Hellman method solves one of the main problems of symmetric encryption — secure key transmission. The protocol is named after U.S. cryptographers Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman, who were the first to publish a working algorithm for public key exchange over a network. The scheme they proposed is applied in many encrypted communication standards and software, such as Gnu Privacy Guard (GnuPG, GPG), VPN protocols, SSH, TLS, etc.\n\nHow Diffie–Hellman works\n\nAt the heart of the protocol is the concept of partial key exchange, formulated by US cryptographer Ralph Merkle and implemented by Diffie and Hellman in the form of a cryptographic algorithm with a public key. Under this scheme, each party to the exchange:\n\nGenerates a random natural number — their private key;\n\nAgrees with the remote party on the public parameters to be used to create a secret key;\n\nComputes the public key based on the private key and the public parameters;\n\nExchanges public keys with the remote party;\n\nComputes the shared secret key using the remote party’s public key, their own private key, and the public parameters.\n\nThe Diffie–Hellman method can be applied to any number of exchange parties, not just two. To obtain the shared secret key, all parties to the exchange take turns computing keys using the common public parameters, public keys received from other parties, and their respective private keys.\n\nDiffie–Hellman implementations\n\nDepending on the lifetime of the private keys, there are two options for implementing the Diffie–Hellman protocol:\n\nThe static variant uses long-term private keys that are not changed when the connection is terminated.\n\nThe ephemeral (DHE) variant generates private keys for each new connection.\n\nDiffie–Hellman weaknesses"
