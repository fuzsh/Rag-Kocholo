        "text": "Computer History Museum\n\nAbramson, Norm\n\nAfter receiving his Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from Stanford University (1958), Norm Abramson remained on the faculty of Stanford (1955-1965), before accepting a visiting professorship at the University of California, Berkeley (1966). He then took as he says, “a pretty big gamble,” and accepted a professorship at the University of Hawaii (1968- ).That big gamble quickly paid off, for in the next year the Department of Defense announced the Themis program to aggressively fund research at “second tier” universities, universities like the University of Hawaii. Abramson, who very much wanted to do research, teamed up with two of his new faculty members, Wes Peterson and Ned Weldon, and others, and conceived a research program that was funded by ARPA and managed by Bob Taylor and Larry Roberts at the IPTO. To become known as ALOHAnet, it proved that broadcast radio communications could be the basis of an inter-island communication system. As important as this finding was, how ALOHAnet influenced Bob Metcalfe’s thinking and led to Ethernet is the story investigated in this interview and the interviews with Metcalfe, Charlie Bass and John Davidson: for Ethernet is one of the important and crowning achievements in the early history of computer communications.\n\nPaul Baran helped me in ways beyond identifying people I should interview. For example, at the time, Paul and Bill Houser were meeting with Norm Abramson to see if there was a way they could help him start a company around technologies dating back to ALOHAnet. On this occasion, Norm was visiting them at Interfax, one of the start-ups Paul and Bill were engaged in launching. Knowing I wanted to interview Norm, they invited me to meet with him at Interfax. I gladly accepted. I am sure that Norm, on seeing how my friends welcomed me, create a level of trust that facilitated our conversation. This is a wonderful story of how it is not necessary to know the objectives or benefits of research if there is sufficient funding, highly qualified and motivated researchers, a supportive network of collaborators and a management style that recognizes managing technical research is vastly different than managing a profit and loss operation. So please enjoy; even the story of the blackboard.\n\nBaskett, Forrest\n\nIn this two-part oral history, Forest covers the full arc of his career from growing up in Texas, earning PhD in Computer Science from the University of Texas, becoming a professor, then entrepreneur and finally a venture capitalist.\n\nHis work at the University of Texas/Austin centered on early timesharing systems and computer performance optimization. After his PhD, he moved to Stanford University where he continued his work in performance analysis. He was also influenced by the work at nearby Xerox PARC and the development of the Alto personal computer.\n\nForest took a leave from Stanford to spend full-time at PARC where he was exposed to all the exciting work going on there. As a result, he was invited to join several startups, but for personal reasons decided on a lower pressure alternative and took the leadership role in establishing DEC’s Western Research Laboratory. After 4 years at DEC’s lab, Forest moved onto Silicon Graphics, where he spent 13 years in a CTO type role\n\nHis work at Silicon Graphics was exciting and varied. He was heavily involved in making key technology decisions, including decisions around potential acquisitions. That experience and his on-going contact with the venture industry led him eventually to join New Enterprise Associates (NEA), where he has had a very productive venture capital career for the last 17 years.\n\nBanatao, Dado\n\nDado Banatao was born into a poor family in the Philippines. His father was a farmer and his mother a housekeeper. He excelled in school and was able to attend Mapua Institute of Technology, from which he received a BS in electrical engineering. After not finding an interesting engineering position, he decided to enter commercial airline pilot training. Part way through that training, he received an offer from Boeing to come to Seattle as an engineer working on the 747 program.\n\nWhile working at Boeing, Dado was given the opportunity to take a paid leave and attend the University of Washington. He ended up transferring to Stanford and moving to Silicon Valley in 1971. Upon graduating with a PhD, he went to National Semiconductor. Three years later he went to Commodore, and then onto Intersil, where he was the microprocessor design manager. From there it was on to Synertek and then SEEQ. While at SEEQ, he formulated ideas for his own startup, Mostron, to develop a PC chipset. Mostron ran out of money, but the chipset became the heart of his next startup, Chips and Technologies with Gordon Campbell. After driving his division to $450M, he left to start S3 in 1989 where he developed the first graphics accelerator for the PC.\n\nDado’s next step was to become a venture capitalist. After a stint at Mayfield, he started his own firm, Tallwood, where he continues to invest in companies with unique technologies.\n\nBass, Charlie\n\nCharles “Charlie” Bass made an auspicious decision in 1968: after earning his masters degree in Electrical Engineering from the University of Miami, he elected to pursue his PhD at the University of Hawaii (UH). In 1967, UH received a THEMIS ARPA grant that would have important implications for both the University and Bass. For Bass, over the next four years, Principal Investigators and ARPA personnel would be frequent visitors to UH, introducing Bass to some of the best young research scientists of the day. The THEMIS funding meant UH could attract more faculty and students, such as Bass and John Davidson, who became friends and life-long colleagues. A third important event was in 1972, when Robert Metcalfe came to UH to study the ALOHAnet in order to finish his thesis. Metcalfe, Bass and Davidson became friends. Consequently, Bass was no stranger to the people and events of his day.\n\nWhen Bass received his Ph.D in Electrical Engineering in 1972, he accepted a teaching position at the University of California, Berkeley. Happy though he was in academia, in 1975, a mutual friend introduced him to Ralph Ungermann who was co-founding Zilog Inc. with Federico Faggin and substantial financial backing from Exxon Enterprises. Bass decided to join Zilog and began teaching at Stanford University. When Ungermann had a falling out with Exxon during the latter half of 1978, and was fired at year-end, Ungermann and Bass had grown closer, to the extent that when Ungermann began contemplating his future, he invited Bass to join him. After months of deliberation, they founded Ungermann-Bass (UB) in July 1979, and settled on a local area networking, or LAN, product able to connect from eight to thirty-two terminals to host computers over Ethernet using the XNS protocol, named the NIU-1. Bass recounts these days in absorbing detail; up through his hoping to create a “home run” product with IBM. He also describes learning in 1984 that IBM had committed to MAP, the Manufacturing Automation Protocol, and thus OSI, or Open System Interconnection protocols. Bass had convinced Ungermann; then GE came looking for a partner and INI was created. MAP proved to be a false hope. Bass confesses it was “the biggest flaw in his crystal ball ever.”\n\nBy the spring of 1985, Bass began feeling “disenfranchised” within UB and resigned. As he weighed his alternatives, he unexpectedly received a call from Steve Schwartz, Assistant Group Executive for Telecommunication Products for IBM, offering him a consulting assignment assisting IBM to determine their telecommunication strategy. He was soon “wandering the hallways of IBM.” Nearly a year later, in late 1986, Bass returned to California and rejoined the UB Board of Directors. UB had become a very different company, however: “it was drifting” until the stock market crash of October 1987, when DCA suddenly put the company into financial “play.” Bass had had enough and resigned again. In 1989 Tandem acquired UB for $274 million. That same year, Bass launched his venture capital fund, Bass Ventures.\n\nAlthough this interview was conducted after 1988, Bass remembers in detail the events of the day, many of which are supported by the interviews of others. Stories of particular importance include; the product planning meetings at Zilog; UB’s struggle to settle on a company strategy; how Sytek became UB’s arch rival; the drama surrounding UB’s Ethernet chip; how Bass closed a deal to develop IBM’s token ring bridge; the acquisitions of both Amdax and Pyramid; and how UB won the Texas Instruments contract to build a PC and how it led to the next generation Terminal Server.\n\nBechtolsheim, Andy\n\nBorn in 1955, Andy describes growing up in Germany in a small rural town in the shadow of the Alps. Although he had no direct outside influence, Andy quickly developed a keen interest in electrical and electronic devices. He turned his basement into his electronic workshop. When the microprocessor was developed in the early 1970’s he immediately recognized the unique potential of this new device, becoming a self-taught expert. While working at a local shop which did machine controllers, he developed the idea to replace the random logic controllers with a programmable machine. He built the device from scratch, programmed it in binary, and made a very successful business selling these controllers to this local shop.\n\nAfter winning a national science fair award, he won a Fulbright scholarship to come study in the United States. He enrolled in Carnegie Mellon as a graduate student and earned a Master’s degree in 1976 at the age of 19. He transferred to Stanford University in 1977 where he came into contact with the work at Xerox Palo Alto Research Center. On seeing the Alto computer at PARC, he immediately realized it represented the future of computing. He embarked on building a similar personal workstation at Stanford where it became an immediate hit.\n\nAfter several attempts to sell his workstation design to existing companies, he decided to once again start a company of his own, Sun Microsystems. After helping Sun grow into a major workstation vendor, Andy got the entrepreneurial itch again and started Granite Systems, a gigabit Ethernet company. Since then he has founded or funded many other companies, including being the first outside investor in Google. Andy is currently at his latest startup, Arista Networks, which went public in 2015.\n\nCisco Heritage Project oral history panel : Tom Rindfleisch and Ed Feigenbaum\n\nTwo important Stanford University figures, Ed Feigenbaum of the Artificial Intelligence lab and Thomas Rinfsfleisch, head of IT services for thirty years, were jointly interviewed about the origins of networking on campus, including how that eventually led to Cisco’s founding. This is a chapter long disputed with various combatants regarding who ‘invented the router’, who ‘owned it’, and what some of the various claims are. Rindfleisch established the SUMEX-AIM facility at Stanford, a pioneering facility in terms of its national networking capability for multiple universities. This gave rise to multiple approaches for connectivity, for “real work” as Feigenbaum explains it. ARPANet, XeroxPARC, Tymnet, FTP, Appletalk, TCP—all are discussed in some detail.\n\nKey figures—Josh Lederberg, Les Earnest, Bill Yeager, and Ralph Gorin all are described for their roles. And the angst about ‘who owned what’ and the various perspectives that were extant at the time, is given considerable discussion. Also, the interactions of Heils Reimer and the Stanford Office of Technology Licensing (OTL), and data re Silicon Graphics, Sun Microsystems, Imagen, and other companies that emerged from Stanford’s campus are covered. Jim Clark, John Hennessey, and Andy Bechtolsheim are discussed in this context, as well as Sandy Lerner and Len Bosack. Kirk Lougheed, Mark Crispin, and Bill Yeager are depicted also.\n\nDiffie, Whitfield\n\nWhitfield Diffie is an American computer scientist and researcher. In this interview, he discusses his formative years and upbringing, including an early interest in codes and ciphers. He discusses the meaning of cryptography and his early forays into the field while working at Stanford University’s AI laboratory under John McCarthy. After an extended journey across the United States with his friend Mary visiting various research centers and investigating cryptography with leading figures in the field, Diffie began work at IBM’s Thomas Watson Research Center. While there, he learned of professor Martin Hellman of Stanford University, whom he soon joined in a research effort on the West Coast. Diffie then discusses the origin and development of the Diffie-Hellman public-key cryptography system, one of the most significant developments in computer security in many years and their collaboration with computer scientist Ralph Merkel.\n\nEarnest, Les\n\nLester Donald Earnest (born December 17, 1930) is an American computer scientist. In this interview, he describes his childhood and early influences, including a brief stay at Caltech. He began work as a programmer for the U.S. Navy in the early 1950s, checking solutions derived from one of the world’s largest and fastest analog computers of the day, the Typhoon.\n\nIn 1956, he began work at MIT on the USAF SAGE project. In Earnest’s view, the SAGE system was a fraudulent technical solution to a political problem, one whose capabilities were always exaggerated. He provides support for this view.\n\nEarnest took courses towards a master’s at MIT and created a novel handwriting recognizer. He then moved to Stanford University where he was a founding member of the AI lab there, working with John McCarthy. The early ARPANET is discussed, as is Earnest’s founding of a laser printer company, Imagen. Finally, Earnest discusses some of his post-retirement work with professional cycling.\n\nFairbairn, Douglas\n\nIn this oral history, Doug describes his early interest in rockets and space, amateur radio, and his decision to pursue electrical engineering as a career. He entered Stanford University in 1966 and graduated with an MSEE degree in 1971. He spent 8 years at Xerox PARC, where he worked on the POLOS program, VLSI design methodologies, and the NoteTaker portable personal computer.\n\nHe left Xerox in 1980 to pursue work on Lambda Magazine and to become a founder of VLSI Technology. At VLSI, he headed a design tool group initially, but eventually took over the whole ASIC business.\n\nIn 1990, he left VLSI Technology and co-founded Redwood Design Automation, a software design tool company. Redwood was purchased by Cadence in 1994, at which time Doug became the General Manager of the Alta Group at Cadence.\n\nSince leaving Cadence in 1998, Doug has served on the Boards of a number of small companies. Since 2007, he has pursued a dual career, working at the Computer History Museum and running his own photography business.\n\nFeeney, Hal\n\nHal Feeney discusses his childhood in Iowa and electrical engineering studies at Notre Dame University. Following his work at Hughes and a Master's program Stanford, Feeney returned to Notre Dame, but then left to join General Instruments to work on digital differential analyzers for satellite control. Feeney joined Intel to work on the 8008 processor project for CTC's Datapoint terminal proposed by Ted Hoff and Stan Mazor. Feeney discusses issues around design tools, Rubylith, packaging, and testing as well as his work with Federico Faggin on the 8008. He talks about the 8008 customers and the transition to the 8080. Feeney joined Intel marketing and discusses the changes in documenting and selling microprocessors and the need for development tools. Feeney left Intel to join first Dataquest and then Pathfinder Research to focus on market research and consulting. The final part of the recording is Hal Feeney showing photomicrographs of the Intel 8008 and his engineering notebook. Feeney discusses the changes of the processor and pricing over time as well as patent lawsuits. He closes with a list of names of people involved in the 8008 project.\n\nFeigenbaum, Edward\n\nEdward Feigenbaum is a professor of Computer Science and co-scientific director of the Knowledge Systems Laboratory at Stanford University. Feigenbaum served as chief scientist of the United States Air Force from 1994 to 1997.\n\nProfessor Feigenbaum was chairman of the Computer Science Department and director of the Computer Center at Stanford University. Until 1992, Feigenbaum was co-principal investigator of the national computer facility for applications of artificial intelligence to medicine and biology known as the SUMEX-AIM facility, established by the National Institute of Health (NIH) at Stanford University. He is past president of the American Association for Artificial Intelligence. He has served on the National Science Foundation Computer Science Advisory Board, an ARPA study committee for Information Science and Technology; and on the National Research Council's Computer Science and Technology Board.

He also was a member of the Board of Directors of Sperry Corporation prior to its merger with Burroughs. He is a member of the Advisory Council of the Kansai Silicon Valley Venture Forum.\n\nHe was elected to the National Academy of Engineering in 1986. In the same year, he was elected to the Productivity Hall of Fame of the Republic of Singapore. He is an elected Fellow of the American Association for Artificial Intelligence, the honorary American College of Medical Informatics. He was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1991. He is the first recipient of the Feigenbaum Medal, an award established in his honor by the World Congress of Expert Systems. He was elected Fellow to the American Institute of Medical and Biological Engineering in January 1994. He was a recipient of the 1994 ACM Turing Award. He was named Kumagai Professor of Computer Science at Stanford University in 1995. He received the U.S. Air Force Exceptional Civilian Service Award in 1997.\n\nFlynn, Mike\n\nMike Flynn is a founder of the field of Computer Architecture. His research into computer hardware concepts has enabled enormous improvements in all areas of computer design and computer applications. He has authored many critical papers in the field, creating what is known as the Flynn taxonomy of computer architecture (SISD, MISD, SIMD, and MIMD).\n\nAs a boy, his interest in amateur radio led to his interest in computers. After a scholarship to Manhattan College to play French horn in the orchestra, Mike turned to the study of electronics. He went to work at IBM that paid for his PhD at Purdue University. Alongside other famous computer pioneers, Mike worked on the IBM 360 upon which IBM bet its future, a gamble that paid off extremely well for IBM. Mike then went to teach at Northwestern University, Johns Hopkins, and eventually Stanford University where he retired in 1999.\n\nIn this interview, Mike discusses what got him interested in computing, his rebel streak at IBM, and his collaboration with other pioneers in the field. In the 1970s he chaired a committee of computer scientists to evaluate the Safeguard missile defense program and gives his strong opinions about that. He talks about the ups and downs of his IBM career and his academic career. He discusses his current projects, post retirement, including a new high performance start-up, and gives a little advice to those considering entering the field of computer science.\n\nFuller, Sam\n\nSam Fuller grew up in humble surroundings in the Detroit, MI area. He developed an interest in mechanical devices and eventually electronics while helping his father in his business. From this work, he developed an interest in engineering. He entered the University of Michigan in 1964. In his sophomore year, he took a course in computer programming which eventually steered him towards computer science which became the focus of his career.\n\nSam graduated at the top of his class and moved west to Stanford University for graduate work. While there, he earned a Hertz Fellowship to support his work through his PhD in Computer Science. After graduating, he was recruited to come to CMU by Gordon Bell, where Sam worked on multiprocessor computer systems.\n\nFrom there he was recruited to come to DEC, where he initially worked on the VAX architecture, helping to assure software compatibility among all VAX machines. Eventually he ran all of DECs long-term research groups around the world. As DEC fell apart in the 1990’s, Sam made the move to Analog Devices, Inc. where he became VP of R&D and Chief Technical Officer.\n\nGibbons, Jim\n\nJames Gibbons is a professor of electrical engineering at Stanford University where he also served as Dean of Engineering among many other critical roles. He received a BS degree from Northwestern in 1953 and a PhD from Stanford University in 1956. He became fascinated with the emerging world or solid-state circuits while working on his PhD and made that that focus of his career. Dr. Gibbons worked closely with William Shockley in the establishment of the IC Lab at Stanford in 1957. He was a pioneer contributor to the application of ion implantation to the field of semiconductor fabrication, a critical contribution to the field. In addition to his tremendous contributions to semiconductors, he has made the same kind of significant contributions to education. In 1972, he invented Tutored Video Instruction, which is widely used at Stanford and elsewhere for continuing education of engineers. He has applied his tutored video instruction to pressing social problems, including the education of children of migrant farm workers (in the 1980's) and to anger management in at-risk teens (in the 1990's), primarily through SERA Learning Technologies, a company he founded.\n\nGoldberg, Adele\n\nAdele Goldberg reflects on her life and career from her early days at the University of Chicago and Stanford University through her career at Xerox PARC and ParcPlace Systems.\n\nGolub, Gene\n\nGene Golub, a numerical analyst and Fletcher Jones Professor of Computer Science at Stanford University, discusses his career to date. Born in Chicago in 1932, Golub attended several colleges before graduating from the University of Illinois with a bachelor’s degree in mathematics in 1953. He stayed on for graduate study, receiving a PhD in 1959 under the direction of Abe Taub. Golub discusses his involvement with the ILLIAC computer and its creators and users, including John Nash, Franz Hohn, David Wheeler and Bill Gear. He describes work on statistical applications with C.I. Rao and Charles Wrigley. In 1959, Golub left for Cambridge, England on a postdoctoral fellowship with Maurice Wilkes’ EDSAC II group, where he shared an office with William Kahan and collaborated by mail with R.S. Varga on his first major paper. After returning to the USA, Golub worked briefly at UC Berkeley’s Lawrence Radiation Laboratory and at Space Technology Laboratories, before accepting a visiting position in the Computer Science Division of Stanford University. After a one year appointment at the Courant Institute (on the invitation of Eugene Isaacson) during 1965–6 he returned to Stanford as Associate Professor and remains a faculty member there. Golub outlines the evolution of numerical analysis within the computer science department at Stanford, including its early history with George Forsythe and Jack Herriot and his later role with Joseph Keller and Joe Oliger in creating the Scientific Computing and Computational Mathematics program, which Golub directed from 1988 to 1998. He discusses his students, including Margaret Wright, Michael Overton and Eric Grosse. Golub reviews his extensive list of publications and collaborations, identifying those he considers most significant and explaining their origins and impact. Among these are his papers with Kahan, Christian Reinsch and Peter Businger on singular value decomposition, with Jim Wilkinson on the application of iterative refinement to least squares problems, Victor Pereyra on differentiation of pseudo-inverses and non-linear least squares problems, and Charles Van Loan on total least squares and the book “Matrix Computations.” Golub explains in some detail the origins of his well known work on direct methods for Poisson’s equation with Bill Buzbee and Clair Nielson, including discussion of his related work on the conjugate gradient method with Paul Concus, and of the roles of Roger Hockney and Oscar Buneman in triggering this research. Golub also summarizes his work with Carl De Boor and with DL Boley on inverse eigenvalue calculations, and with a range of collaborators on Gauss quadratrure rules. Golub has been very active within the academic community, and explains his long involvement with the Householder meeting series and participation in ACM SIGNUM, SIAM, and the national academies of sciences and of engineering. He has been most active within SIAM, where he was editor of its SIAM Classics series, the founding editor of its journals on Scientific and Statistical Computing and on Matrix Analysis and Applications, and a founder of the affiliated International Council for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (ICIAM).\n\nHellman, Martin\n\nStanford professor Martin Hellman describes his early work, with fellow researchers Whitfield Diffie and Ralph Merkle, on public-key cryptography. This work has enabled secure communications over an insecure channel, a key driver of e-commerce and financial transactions on the Internet. Hellman describes his early explorations and influences and concludes with his thoughts on some of the major problems facing the world today.\n\nHennessy, John\n\nDr. John Hennessy of Stanford University in an interview with John Mashey describes how his academic career began, his role in helping initiate some of the major advances in computer science, and his rise through academia to become President of Stanford University. Hennessy began his scientific work writing a thesis in real time programming and after joining Stanford University in 1977 became involved in advanced computing design. That lead to Hennessy's interest in VLSI which led to developing MIPS technology. While running the Stanford Computer Systems Lab, Hennessy took a leave of absence to co-found MIPS, Inc.. When MIPS was acquired by Silicon Graphics, Hennessy returned to Stanford and became head of the Stanford Computer Science Department in 1994. Hennessy also partnered with David Patterson to write the classic textbook: 'A Quantitative Approach: Computer Architecture'. Rising to greater positions of responsibility, Hennessy became Stanford's Dean of Engineering in 1996 and then Provost succeeding Condoleezza Rice in 1999. In 2000, John Hennessy was named President of Stanford University.\n\nKoogle, Tim\n\nTim Koogle served as founding CEO of Yahoo!, guiding the company’s growth from $0 to well over $1 billion in revenue in six years, and from a startup venture to a publicly traded and profitable company.\n\nA Virginia native, Koogle is the son of a machinist and mechanic. He put himself though college repairing cars and tractors. He attended Stanford for his doctorate in mechanical engineering, and founded his first business around preparing Porsche engines for the race track.\n\nAfter Stanford he founded a company that manufactured equipment for electronic manufacturing companies, and then joined Motorola, where he rose through the management ranks. He left to join Western Atlas, an automated data collection and communications systems manufacturer located in Seattle, Washington, that had (earlier) invented bar code symbols. He then ran its subsidiary Intermec corporation.\n\nFrom Intermec, Koogle was recruited by Yahoo! founders David Filo and Jerry Yang as the first chief executive officer and president in March 1995, a month before the company went public. As CEO, he kept tight rein on the young company’s expenses in an era known for excess. The assets he built up let Yahoo! aggressively acquire companies as a way to expand services and fight off mounting competition. Under his leadership, the firm refined features such as personalized home pages, stock quotes, chat rooms, and free e-mail, in addition to its core Web directory services. By 1998 Yahoo! had expanded Yahoo!'s into 14 countries, with 30 percent of its traffic coming from outside North America.\n\nSince leaving Yahoo! Koogle has been actively engaged in funding and scaling numerous early stage private companies in technology and consumer products. He invests directly and is on the Board of between 3 and 5 companies at any given time, sometimes as Chairman.\n\nMcCarthy, John\n\nComputer science legend John McCarthy speaks with Stanford University AI researcher and professor of computer science, Nil Nilsson. McCarthy discusses his early academic training and influences at Caltech and Princeton University. He then describes his early work at MIT and Dartmouth College in which he helped organize the highly influential Dartmouth Summer Research Project on Artificial Intelligence, the seminal first conference in the field. McCarthy then discusses his work at Stanford University and briefly summarizes some of the mathematical underpinnings of the logical models he uses in explaining and understanding computer systems.\n\nMakimoto, Tsugio\n\nThis oral history summarizes Japanese pioneer Tsugio Makimoto's many contributions to the development of a global semiconductor industry. He began his engineering career as Japan was recovering from the effects of WW II and its semiconductor industry was in its earliest stages. After graduating from Tokyo University, he started as a young engineer in the Hitachi in 1959 and ended up as General manager of its Semiconductor Division. In 1999, he left Hitachi, after 40 years, to go to Sony Corporation where he was in charge of the company's semiconductor strategy. Along the way he went to Stanford where he received BS and MS degrees and back to Tokyo University for a PhD.\n\nIn this oral history, Dr. Makimoto discusses the role of technology transfers from U.S. companies such as RCA and Bell Laboratories in the development of the Japanese semiconductor industry. He also talks about his role in U.S. Japan semiconductor \"trade wars\" as one of the key Japanese negotiators. He was also significantly involved with the formation of the World Semiconductor Council.\n\nMerkle, Ralph\n\nCryptography pioneer Ralph Merkle discusses his early work at UC Berkeley and how this lead to a unique method of key exchange—the primary requirement for sending secure communications over an insecure channel and a key feature of all Internet commerce today. Merkle’s work is placed in the context of the work as extended by Martin Hellman and Whitfield Diffie of Stanford University. Merkle concludes by examining some advanced technologies for the future.\n\nMorgenthaler, Gary\n\nIn this interview, Gary Morgenthaler discusses his career as a programmer with Stanford University and Tymshare, an early time-sharing company, as a consultant with McKinsey & Company, and as a founder, COO and CEO of Ingres, one of the major database software vendors of the 1980s. Ingres (originally called Relational Technology, Inc.) was founded in 1980 to commercialize the INGRES database technology developed at UC Berkeley. He describes the intense competition between Ingres and Oracle throughout the 1980s and how Ingres began to lose momentum in the late 1980s, leading to the sale of the company to ASK Computer Systems. In the 1990s, Morgenthaler became a venture capitalist, running the West Coast office of Morgenthaler Ventures, the venture capital firm founded by his father in Cleveland. As a venture capitalist, he was instrumental in the founding of Illustra to market POSTGRES, also developed at UC Berkeley. Illustra was subsequently sold to Informix and then to IBM.\n\nNie, Norman\n\nNorman Nie discusses the development of the SPSS statistical analysis software product that was developed when he was a graduate student at Stanford University and how it was distributed by Stanford and then the University of Chicago until the IRS determined that the income received from had to be declared as unrelated business income. This forced Nie and his associates to form the company SPSS to distribute it as a commercial product. He describes how this resulted in a model for commercializing products developed in university research laboratories which has become widely used in many industries and how the funding of the development of SPSS differed from similar products developed by early competitors. He presents his view of IBM's role in forming the early software industry and his view on how the difficulty of developing a second successful software product is a significant inhibitor to the growth of the software industry.\n\nPerlegos, George\n\nRaised in Greece, George Perlegos moved to California in high school and went on to have a sterling Silicon Valley career. The son of a grape farmer, he finished high school in California’s Central Valley before earning a BS in engineering at San Jose State and an MSEE at Stanford University.\n\nGeorge is one of those rare individuals who made major contributions to both technology and business.

In high school, he did odd jobs that always revolved around some aspect of construction, including digging ditches for the city water company and working in a warehouse that housed construction supplies. Sletten attended the University of Colorado on a Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps (NROTC) scholarship, where he received a Bachelor of Science degree in civil engineering. In his sophomore year at the University of Colorado, he transferred from the Navy to the Marine Corps. As a Marine, Sletten served in Korea and also made his first trip to the West Coast, where he recalls being stationed in Oceanside, California. After nearly a year spent recovering from an injury he sustained in Korea, Sletten signed up for Stanford Business School in 1954 at the urging of a close friend. His first job after graduating from Stanford in 1956 was with the construction company, Williams and Burrows.\n\nIn 1962, Sletten teamed up with Onslow “Rudy” Rudolph. Together they formed the general construction and engineering company Rudolph and Sletten. Rudolph and Sletten would construct buildings for some of Silicon Valley’s most historic companies including Fairchild Semiconductor, National Semiconductor, Memorex, Xerox PARC, AMD, and Apple. Rudolph and Sletten developed groundbreaking business techniques for their company including fast-track construction, emphasized the importance of safety by keeping their employees up to date on the latest standards and protocols, and implemented a top-notch education, training, and recruiting program for new hires. As a result from their stellar work in Silicon Valley, Rudolph and Sletten have also become the go-to construction company for biotech, pharmaceutical, education, government, and health care facilities throughout California.\n\nSze, Simon\n\nSimon Sze was born in China in 1936. He moved to Taiwan at age 12 and attended the National Taiwan University, studying electrical engineering. He then left for the US where he received an MSEE at the University of Washington and a PhD at Stanford University.\n\nUpon graduation, Dr. Sze went to Bell Labs in 1963. His assignment at Bell Labs was to “work on silicon.” During a lunchtime conversation with a colleague in 1967, they conceived of the idea of a “floating gate” into a MOSFET gate structure. It could be used to store charge and perhaps be a mechanism for building solid-state memories to replace core memories in computers. He proved it worked in the lab but did not pursue it to a product. In addition to his research, he authored about 20 books at Bell Labs.\n\nSze stayed at Bell Labs until 1989. He then returned to Taiwan and joined the National Chiao Tung University in Taiwan, where he became a professor. His major focus was teaching semiconductor technology to the next generation of students. He also completed another 20 books after his retirement from Bell Labs. In addition, he has been a visiting professor at Kings College in England, Stanford University, and other well-known academic institutions.\n\nTerman, Lewis\n\nThis oral history recounts the life of Fred Terman through the eyes of his son, Lewis.

Tesler went on to Stanford University to major in mathematics, graduating in 1965. He began working at the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (SAIL) as a consultant the following year, after running a small software consulting business while still a student.\n\nIt was in 1968 that the historic Doug Engelbart “Mother of all Demos” took place at the Fall Joint Computer Conference in San Francisco in which a dramatic vision of future computing was presented. Tesler comments on the Demo and its influence, with particular reference to the use of “modes” in computing generally and the controversies over their use at Xerox and Apple Computer.\n\nTesler then describes his work at the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) on the POLOS and PUB projects, Smalltalk and NoteTaker and the creation of the first graphical IDE (Integrated Development Environment), an essential tool for programmers.\n\nTesler moved to Apple Computer, Inc. in July, 1980, in part because of PARC’s demo of Alto and other technology to Apple’s CEO Steve Jobs, which resulted in a crash program (Lisa) at Apple to incorporate PARC’s graphical user interface (GUI) into a mass-produced computer. Tesler found this appealing. He describes in detail important aspects of the Lisa project, including software development, managing large teams of people as he accepted increasing responsibilities, and extensive user and user experience testing.\n\nTesler eventually moved to head a new R&D group within Apple called the Advanced Technology Group. He discusses some of Apple’s successful and failed products and the challenges of managing a complex research organization. He concludes with a brief discussion of later work at Amazon and Yahoo.\n\nWidrow, Bernard\n\nBernard Widrow received S.B., S.M., and Sc.D. degrees in Electrical Engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1951, 1953, and 1956, respectively.
