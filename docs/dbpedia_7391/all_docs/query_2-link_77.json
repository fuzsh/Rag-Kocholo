For our purposes, we will mainly be concerned with its application in cryptography. The reason why knapsack systems are pertinent is because the encryption process is very fast, in fact, faster than RSA.\n\nThe problem goes like this...There is a thief who breaks into a jewelry store which is showcasing various gems . Each gem has a weight and is appraised to be worth a certain value. If the thief wants to fill his knapsack, which gems should he steal in order to maximize the cumulative value?\n\nHere is a simple applet simulating the knapsack problem, where c = capacity, p = price, w = weight and x = 0 or 1 (in or out). Click link #5.\n\nA special case of this problem occurs when the value of each gem is equal to its size and then finding a subset of the gems that sum to a given capacity. This is commonly known as the \"subset sum problem\" or \"knapsack problem\" in cryptography. It is possible that no such subset exists or that the number of gems is so great that the worst case scenario is too difficult to solve; therefore, the problem is NP-complete. This problem generalizes to other NP-complete problems, in particular, the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP).\n\ntop\n\nCryptographic knapsack scheme\n\nOne of the earliest public key cryptosystems is the knapsack cryptosystem, first described by Ralph Merkle & Martin Hellman in 1978 and the underlying scheme implements the subset sum problem. As stated before, the subset sum problem can be unsolvable, however, there are still instances of the problem that are solvable. The basic idea of the Merkle-Hellman scheme is in transforming hard or unfeasible subset sum problems into easy subset sum problems.\n\ntop\n\nEnciphering and Deciphering\n\nSuppose Bob wants to send a message to Alice, and Alice's public key is a = (a1, a2, ..., an). To encipher a message x = (x1, x2, ..., xn) of n bits, Bob makes the sum:\n\n(1)\n\ntop\n\n(2)\n\n(3)\n\nand , (4)\n\nor and ,\n\nand (5)\n\ntop\n\nAttacking the Trapdoor Knapsack Scheme\n\nBasic Notation and Terminology\n\nPosets\n\nA poset or partially ordered set is a set taken together with a partial order on it. To illustrate the point, let A and B be two sets, A is a subset of B, then these sets are partially ordered with respect to eachother. If A is not a subset of B and B is not a subset of A, then they are not partially ordered.\n\ntop\n\nLattice\n\ntop\n\nLeast Upper Bound and Greatest Lower Bound\n\nTo look at an example of the lattice formed by the power set of {a,b,c}, refer to this link.\n\ntop\n\n(6)\n\n(7)\n\nfor (8)\n\ntop\n\nExample Application\n\nSuppose we have a superincreasing knapsack:\n\nS = [2, 5, 9, 21, 45, 103, 215, 450, 946] which is our private key p = 2003; m = 1289; therefore, m-1 = 317.\n\ntop\n\nConclusion\n\nAfter the realization of the LLL algorithm, subsequent modifications have been applied to the knapsack scheme, attempting to improve its security. But as the knapsack scheme evolved so did the LLL algorithm, in particular, that proposed by Schnorr. Shamir is the first to actually apply the LLL algorithm to break the Merkle-Hellman cryptosystem using Lenstra's linear programming algorithm and later Adleman extended his work by treating the cryptographic problem as a lattice problem rather than a linear programming problem. Even further improvements were made until every known trapdoor knapsack public key scheme had been broken, the last being the Chor-Rivest scheme and the general knapsack scheme.\n\nOther uses of the knapsacks in cryptography include use of knapsacks (subset sum) problem as a one-way function instead of the S-Boxes in DES, proposed by Desmedt, Vandewalle and Govaerts. Also Shamir has come up with a \"provably\" secure protocol to protect passports.\n\nIt seems that there is little security using any trapdoor knapsack based cryptosystem for protecting signatures and authenticity. There might, however, be a future for it in other scientific applications, for example, protocols which is a standardized means of communication among machines across a network. Of course research into this idea would involve a completely different approach.\n\ntop"
