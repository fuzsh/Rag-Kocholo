        "text": "2015 Turing Laureate (Computing's Nobel Prize)\n\nDiffie-Hellman Key Exchange\n\nFoundation of Internet Encryption\n\nWe have a very special announcement today advising that a founding father of Internet encryption, Whitfield Diffie, has joined BankVault as an Advisor and Stakeholder.\n\nIn 2015 Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman won the $1M Turing Prize (computing's Nobel Prize) for the invention of public-key encryption. The Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange is the foundation that secures almost all Internet communication. Every device, every browser, has the Diffie-Hellman algorithm embedded natively - facilitating over $4 trillion per day in global transactions.\n\nTheir discovery is a work of genius. A mathematician by background, Whit's deep non-intuitive insights discovered a fundamental principle that allows two independent parties to set up a common security-secret in public, and then use this to encrypt their communication across that same public network.\n\nWhit is a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (RoyalSociety.org) and was a Sun Microsystems Fellow before the company was acquired by Oracle.\n\nHere is a short video on the significance of their work\n\nAn interesting twist and symmetry to this is that Martin Hellman has joined BankVault's competitor Beyond Identity. Balance is restored to the universe.\n\nAsk us to Test Drive your website.\n\nBankVault provides Passwordless Logins to Web Services.\n\nNo technology risk\n\nNo security risk\n\nIt's free to Test Drive and virtually self-service.\n\nGraeme Speak CEO/Founder"
