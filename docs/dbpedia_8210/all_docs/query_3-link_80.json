        "text": "Though Liverpool's quadruple hopes have faded, their pursuit of a treble remains fervent. Explore the latest on Liverpool's treble odds post-setback and seize your chance to watch Klopp's final games at Anfield from premium matchday seats.\n\nLiverpool are once again on track to win the treble this season. Despite having narrowly missed out on securing the quadruple after their FA Cup loss against Manchester United, their last-minute win against Chelsea in the 2024 Carabao Cup Final has them ready to make history again.\n\nHaving already won the Carabao Cup, Liverpool currently sit close behind Arsenal in second place in the Premier League. Liverpool's treble dreams rest on a win against Atalanta in the Europa League quarter-final, needing to bounce back from last week's draw with Manchester United.\n\nLiverpool also faces a challenging run-in for the Premier League title, sitting one point behind Arsenal and with Manchester City on their heels. Although this will not be the year the Reds reach their quadruple aspirations, the fight for a treble to add to their historic achievements is still ongoing.\n\nAs Liverpool fight for two more trophies, we explore the team's quest for a historic second treble, as well as the impact of Jürgen Klopp's departure. Plus, we reveal how to secure official matchday hospitality for Liverpool's remaining fixtures.\n\nBuy Liverpool v Wolves hospitalityBuy Liverpool Europa League Semi-final hospitality\n\nHas any Premier League team won the quadruple?\n\nNo English team has ever won the quadruple before. The Lisbon Lions are the only team to ever claim all 4 trophies in 1967. It has often been seen as an impossibility for modern teams to achieve a quadruple, but some have been close.\n\nLong-time Liverpool rivals, Manchester City, won the treble last season, after winning the Premier League, FA Cup, and Champions League but were unable to claim the Carabao Cup, after suffering a 1-0 loss to Newcastle United who went on to the final.\n\nManchester United came closer than any other English team in 1999 when they accomplished a treble by winning the Premier League, FA Cup, and the Champions League.\n\nWith Liverpool’s near miss in 2021/2022 and this season’s defeat in the FA Cup final, the first English quadruple remains to be claimed.\n\nWhat are the odds of Liverpool winning the treble?\n\nThe challenge ahead remains formidable, given the intense competition within the Premier League, notably from squads led by Pep Guardiola at Manchester City and Mikel Arteta at Arsenal.\n\nLiverpool have already secured the Carabao Cup, winning 1-0 against Chelsea with Van Dijk’s dramatic header in the 118' minute.\n\nThe numerous Premier League powerhouses are still fighting to be top of the table, including Arsenal and Manchester City respectively occupying the first and third positions.\n\nAt the time of being top of the Premier League last week, Liverpool's odds of winning a treble sat at 7/1. However, following a 2-2 draw with Manchester United - which positioned them second - according to The Independent Betting Liverpool’s treble odds have been pushed out to 5/1.\n\nHere are Liverpool's trophy multiples odds:\n\nPremier League, Europa League & EFL Cup – 5/1 (bet365)\n\nPremier League & Europa League – 5/1 (bet365)\n\nPremier League & EFL Cup – 9/4 (bet365)\n\nEuropa League & EFL Cup – 10/11 (bet365)\n\nPremier League – 9/4 (bet365)\n\nEuropa League – 10/11 (bet365)\n\n*Please note that these odds are correct at the time of publishing and are subject to change.\n\nWhilst Liverpool's quadruple plans may have changed, their unwavering determination to give Klopp a great send-off remains true. Rather than be derailed by the manager's departure, when still fighting for the quadruple title Virgil van Dijk had assured The Telegraph \"we all want to achieve so much and that mindset was already there since pre-season and that doesn't change\". Sending Klopp off in style with a treble will still require the same \"extra boost to do that extra or maybe enjoy it a little bit even more together and make the last part of the season, the last bit of the manager’s time at the club, the best time he’s ever had. That’s what we strive for and that’s why it’s business as usual.”\n\nThe LFC fighting spirit will have to be out in full force for the upcoming Europa League match on 11 Thursday 11th April at Anfield, overcoming their disappointing draw against Manchester United last week, to continue their winning streak in their last 10 European home matches.\n\nWhat will the treble mean for Jürgen Klopp?\n\nWhile the quadruple title remains out of reach for the Premier League team, being this close to replicating their past success is a testament to Klopp's managerial prowess. Ending his Liverpool career with a treble title would be another excellent achievement and farewell for the esteemed coach.\n\nThe effect of Klopp was felt immediately since he began managing the team in 2015, taking Liverpool from 10th in the Premier League to the Europa League and Carabao Cup finals within his first season.\n\nHe has had a consistent impact throughout his management of The Reds, lifting an illustrious 6 major trophies with the team. Liverpool had a fantastic run during the 2019/20 season and secured two trophies the club have never secured before, by winning both the Premiere League and FIFA Club World Cups.\n\nThis successful season of 2021/22 was built on Klopp's impressive career with LFC. After the defeat against Manchester United last month, the FA Cup will not be one of the titles Klopp managed to win with the Reds this year. However, it would be hard to understate the long list of achievements during his time at Liverpool, including their wins throughout this impressive season.\n\nThe Europa League Quarter-Finals against Atalanta and Liverpool’s last game of the season against Wolves on Sunday 19th May will be some of Klopp's final chances for a grand farewell worthy of his LFC career.\n\nHow to get Liverpool hospitality tickets for Klopp's last game at Anfield\n\nFor those seeking one last opportunity to witness Klopp's leadership at Anfield, Seat Unique provides you with access to a variety of official Liverpool hospitality packages covering all remaining home fixtures.\n\nExperience the games in style with the newly introduced 'Brodies' package, featuring premium seating in the recently refurbished Anfield Road stand.
