        "text": "Liverpool coach Arne Slot wants to play more possession-based football and consequently strengthen his No. 6 position.\n\nHe needs a more technical player who can fill the role played by Rodri at Manchester City.\n\nSlot wants to rely less on Wataru Endo, signed last summer from Stuttgart after failing to capture Romeo Lavia and Moises Caicedo both of whom signed for Chelsea.\n\nReal Sociedad’s Martin Zubimendi is the man Liverpool have identified to strengthen their midfield.\n\nBarcelona's former coach Xavi described Zubimendi as a player who can dominate with or without the ball.\n\nHe is a deep-lying playmaker who could be described as similar to Barcelona’s Sergio Busquets and he can create space and dribble past players.\n\nMost importantly, he won possession in midfield more than any other La Liga player last season.\n\nHis £51m release clause is the only potential problem because Sociedad would want the payment made immediately.\n\nGallagher forced out of Chelsea\n\nConor Gallagher reluctantly agreed to join Atletico Madrid after being told his team appearances would be limited at Chelsea this season.\n\nMany fans are furious that one of their own has been forced out of the club, especially, after proving to be the Blues best player last season.\n\nDiego Simeone’s Atletico and Chelsea forced Gallagher to decide by last Sunday night but left him little chance to refuse. He was told that he would not be allowed to train with the first team after returning from holiday.\n\nWith only 12 months left on his contract, Chelsea say they had to capitalise on selling him because of the club’s financial profits sustainability position and Conor is pure profit having risen from the club’s academy.\n\nHe had already rejected a deal to join Aston Villa which would have been the claret and blues club record spend at £57 million.\n\nChelsea ended their pre-season tour of America with a 2-1 loss to Real Madrid and boss Enzo Maresca admitted he is struggling with his team’s defensive problems.\n\nThe club ended its tour after conceding 12 goals in five games. Maresca played with Reece James, Benoit Badiashile, Levi Colwell and Malo Gusto in his backline which gave Chelsea plenty of pace but they were vulnerable to balls played in behind those defenders.\n\nChelsea looked slow, gave up too much space and Real’s forwards were able to stretch the defence.\n\nMaresca blamed his players for still doing what Mauricio Pochettino taught them and he wanted his defensive line to drop deeper when necessary.\n\nChelsea finish their pre-season on Sunday when they play Inter Milan at Stamford Bridge.\n\nAtletico Madrid have cleared the way for Samu Omorodion to leave as Chelsea move in with a £35m offer for the 20-year-old.\n\nChelsea want a new striker and Atletico have agreed to an £ 81 million deal to sign Julian Alvarez from Manchester City and therefore Omorodion can leave.\n\nSancho – Zero to Hero\n\nThe campus at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) breeds champions. So many of their athletes have risen to the top in their chosen sports.\n\nThe campus was the base for Manchester United’s pre-season tour of the USA and coach Erik Ten Hag was hoping that some of the stardust would rub off on his team.\n\nThe plan did not work perfectly with some questionable performances but Ten Hag remains confident that this year they will do well enough to forget last season’s sixth place in the league.\n\nHe was excited and animated on the touchline when United destroyed Real Betis in San Diego.\n\nHe was also delighted with the work Ruud van Nistlerooy, Rene Hake, Andreas Georgson and Jelle ten Rouwelaar have contributed giving the United forward line aggression and impetus.\n\nHe was particularly pleased with Marcus Rashford, Amad Diallo and Jadon Sancho—yes, I did say Jadon Sancho!\n\nHe could well become a major part of the United strike force having resolved his differences with Ten Hag and their joint decision to draw a line under last season’s massive disagreement but the rumours regarding him possibly joining Paris Sant-Germain are still rumbling on.\n\nTen Hag is also excited about the arrival of Leny Yoro and Joshua Zirkzee although the 18-year-old centre-back Yoro will not be available for a while due to injury.\n\nUnited are still negotiating to bring in Noussair Mazraoui and Matthijs de Ligt from Bayern Munich.\n\nUnited’s biggest challenge is to keep their players fit and avoid last season’s total of 60 injuries when regular first-team players were often not available.\n\nMy latest information from inside the club is that Yoro will likely miss three months at the beginning of the season and Rasmus Hojlund six weeks.\n\nCommunity Shield: Manchester City vs Manchester United\n\nThis weekend’s Community Shield promises to be a test of two teams who expect to be challenging for Premier League title honours this season.\n\nThe rivalry between the two Manchester clubs, United and City, will definitely guarantee a lively atmosphere and plenty of spice.\n\nUnited lost their final pre-season match against Liverpool 3-0 but Erik Ten Hag does not give much importance to that result.\n\nWith Rasmus Hojlund sidelined because of a hamstring injury, Jadon Sancho did well playing centre-forward. The 24-year-old is a definite option. “That is what we can do if we don’t have the availability of Rasmus,” said Ten Hag.\n\nMatch facts: This will be the 194th Manchester derby and their third Community Shield with United winning in 1956 and 2011.\n\nCan City gain revenge for losing the FA Cup final 2-1? City have lost their last three Community Shield games.\n\nUnited have won more Shields than any other club and can boast 21 wins although the last one was in 2016.\n\nPep Guardiola and Erik Ten Hag will not choose their line-ups until Saturday morning. However, this is what I am hearing from each camp:\n\nPossible team selection\n\nCity: Ortega, Walker, Dias, Ake, Gvardiol, Kovacic, Rodri, Savinho, De Bruyne, Doku, Haaland; United: Onana, Dalot, Yoro, Martinez, Malacia, Mainoo, McTominay, Garnacho, B. Fernandes, Rashford and Sancho.\n\nWest Ham strengthens striking force\n\nGood news at last Hammers fans…West Ham have completed the signing of Niclas Fulkrug from Borussia Dortmund.\n\nThe German striker has agreed a four year deal costing the club £27million and he becomes the fifth player to arrive under new coach Julen Lopetegui.\n\nFulkrug should fit in nicely because he worked with technical director Tim Steidten at Werder Bremen and he is looking forward to working with Lopetegui.\n\nHe said this week: “The chance to play under the head coach is really exciting. His playing style is important for me and I am confident that under him I will be able to perform at my best and score lots of goals.\n\nFulkrug scored 16 times in 41 games for Dortmund last season and the team reached the Champions League final where they lost to Real Madrid. West Ham have also signed Leed’s winger Crysencio Summerville for £25m and Wolve’s defender Max Kilman for £40m.\n\nArgentina’s 30-year-old midfielder Guido Rodriguez will also arrive at the club following the expiry of his contract with Real Betis.\n\nFears over Solanke\n\nBournemouth coach Andoni Iraola is monitoring carefully the injury sustained by his star striker Dominic Solanke and his future at the club. The Englishman missed last Sunday’s 1-0 win over Rayo Vallecano but this has been followed by intense interest from Tottenham.\n\nBournemouth confirmed last week that Solanke has a deal which expires in 2027 and includes a release clause of £65m.\n\nIraola played down the injury and said, “Dom came to the match but we decided not to risk him in a friendly with the new season about to start, but it’s not a big worry.”\n\nThe 26-year-old Solanke scored 19 goals last season and Tottenham want him if Richarlison finally moves to a Saudi club. Since the departure of Harry Kane, Heung-min Son has shouldered the responsibility of scoring goals for Spurs.\n\nHowever, coach Ange Postecoglou knows that Sonny is more of a No.10 than an out-and-out striker. He will score goals but he is more comfortable coming in from the left and moving into the centre following a ball from the wing or midfield.\n\nPlaying with a strong striker makes him a more dangerous player and that is the role Solanke can fill.\n\nManchester City and Pep Guardiola are taking a big risk by not seeking to replace Julian Alvarez if he leaves which is likely. Atletico Madrid are close to a deal worth £81m for the Argentine striker and I am told the transfer is likely to go through.\n\nAlvarez has been outspoken during his time with Argentina at the Olympics and said how unhappy he is to play second fiddle to Erling Haaland— remarks which have annoyed Pep Guardiola.\n\nThe 24-year-old saw plenty of action last season due to the injuries suffered by Haaland and Kevin De Bruyne but he recognises that this\n\ncoming season he might spend a lot of time on the bench. Guardiola said he was not thinking of replacing Alvarez because he was hoping there would be a last-minute change of heart and the striker would stay at the Etihad Stadium.\n\nGuardiola said: “The squad is strong enough if someone leaves and we talk about that. Of course, until the last transfer day, we have chances— I don’t rule out the option to have new players but if anyone leaves, I think 95 per cent we will have the same squad as last season.”\n\nTransfer news…\n\n**Brentford have agreed to loan Napoli’s midfielder Jens Cajuste for the whole of 24/25. The 24-year-old comes with an option to buy next summer for £10million.\n\nIvan Toney returned to Brentford training this week with reports coming in that Manchester United could make a late bid to sign him.\n\nArsenal, Tottenham, Chelsea and West Ham have stepped back from their initial interest to buy him.\n\n**Wolves boss Gary O’Neil says he will not stand in the way of Pedro Neto leaving if that is what he wants.\n\nTottenham are the most likely club to take the 24-year-old who played 20 games last season and scored 11 goals. Liverpool and Arsenal are also interested but\n\nTottenham leads the way. O’Neil said this week: “I know how good he is and I know how well he would do at a big club. I want our team here to be unbelievably successful so I’m hoping he stays.”\n\n**Newcastle are progressing in their attempt to sign 24-year-old Marc Guehi from Crystal Palace. Guehi impressed during the Euros playing for England and any deal would have to be around £60million.\n\nHe has been on an extended holiday break and reported back for training on Tuesday.\n\nGuehi’s fellow England teammate Eberechi Eze also reported back to the Eagles and he is aware of Manchester City’s and Tottenham’s interest in signing him.\n\nPalace have already lost key forward Michael Olise this summer but have brought in Morocco centre-back Chadi Riad, Daichi Kamada and Ismaila Sarr.\n\n**While several Premier League clubs were too slow to react, Barcelona have agreed a deal with RB Leipzig to sign Spain’s Euro Cup-winning star Dani Olmo for £47m.\n\n**Manchester United’s interest in signing PSG’s Manuel Ugarte has stalled because the French club want £52million for the midfielder. United are still interested but have started to explore other possibilities with Burnley’s 26-year-old Sander Berge under consideration for £30m."
