        "text": "Jurgen Klopp is the most successful Liverpool manager of the 21st century, having won six trophies with the Reds so far, including a Champions League and Premier League.\n\nIt's a remarkable record when one considers the club was in crisis when the German took over in 2015, shortly after Brendan Rodgers had been sacked.\n\nIndeed, one look at the starting line-up for Klopp's first match, at Tottenham on October 17, 2015, shows just how far Liverpool have come since his arrival at Anfield."
