        "text": "Before I start this post fully, I want to let the Liverpool fc team and fans knows that this is not the best time to celebrate, we all knows that we have a long way to go. We all knows that they are some teams out there that might start poorly and as time goes on they will be the team that will shock us by surprises. It is not how good you started the journey, it is definitely how far that you can hold on to the progress of the journey to the final end. There is this popular saying that states that it is not how far that matters as per the journey, it is how you eventually ends the journey that matters. The end result is definitely what matters when it comes to the soccer ecosystem. Many team just like what I stated above will start poorly but at the end of everything they will be the one lifting the trophy. The journey is not always that easy, you have to keep the fighting spirit alive till result that you wanted is achieved. When it comes to soccer and referring to the English premier league in particular, we all knows that the journey is not always that easy, it is always a battle between the best because as there is no small team in the English premier league when you are comparing it to other leagues out there. The team that you are referring to as a small team in the English premier league can go ahead by defeating those big name team in other league. This is to show ho far the teams in the English premier league are so strong. When you are discussing about the English premier league teams, you should never write any team off, this is simply because they are full of surprises. We have seen how those teams in the English premier league that was written off are found doing the unexpected. They have proven on numerous occasions that they have all it takes to do the unexpected.\n\nAs for your information, with the messages that I am trying to pass above, I am saying in a nutshell that we should not be carried away with our amazing performance yet, we need more backup players so that we don't over labour these players. That is one strategies that the Manchester city team have been applying and that has been working for them. What you are required to do or what my team Liverpool fc are expected to do right at this moment is what I just stated and hinted above. They need replacement on positions that lacks such. We can't over run these players. I am referring to Luiz Diaz, Dominic Szoboszklai, Mac Allister, Mohammed Salah and even our goalie, Allison Becker. If you have been following up with the English premier league, Liverpool fc to be precise, you will discovered that players like Dominic Szoboszklai has been doing more than expected, he is always found all over the place making sure that any loop holes in the matches are being destroyed. We all knows that not all players have that energy, pace nd power to do so. It shows that he is a rare gem but despite that, we have to make sure that we protect him so that he doesn't sustain injuries. If he does we are in trouble. This is what happened with Luiz Diaz last season and this is what cost us the league. We knows that Luiz Diaz is a player that is more than wonderful. He is top notch player. With that being said above him, I am always happy seeing him playing matches week in weeks out. We have seen in countless occasion where he had singlehandedly destroyed opponents and also how he has singlehandedly won numerous wins for his side, the Liverpool fc team.\n\nThings you should knows about the Liverpool fc progress so fa\n\nAs for your information, you should knows that when you are referring to soccer and the English premier league at large, Liverpool fc team have started their campaign pretty well. Once more we should not be carried away by this form at all. We should knows that we still have a lot of journey that is ahead of us that we must conquer. As per the English premier league, Liverpool fc started well by securing a draw with the Chelsea fc team at their home soil, Stamford bridge. Liverpool fc played well but they were lucky to walk away with a draw I must admit. Our next match saw us takes on Bournemouth fc, the good thing is that despite the red card given to Mac Allister, we still won the match 3 vs 1. Deviating from that we took on Newcastle United. This encounter is one of the best encounter that we have seen when you are referring o the English premier league current season so far. As for your information, the Liverpool fc team came from behind to win the match 2 vs 1 at the tail end. The wonderful thing is seeing that they scored us in the first half and above all, Van Dijk was red carded in the first half also. We were thinking that we will lost at the end of the match. Well, the second half does magic for the Jurgen Klopp side as Liverpool fc came from behind to rewrite history. The introduced Darwin was the one that scored the two goals for the liverpool fc team and that is what wins the match for the Liverpool fc.\n\nLastly on my radar before the international break we played against the Aston Villa team and we kept clean cheat in that match by winning the match 3 nil. I was surprised to see that we won the match, we all knows that when it comes to the English premier league, the Aston Villa team is one team you can't toil with.\n\nAs for your information , this is how far the Liverpool fc team have progressed so far. As per the English premier league table, my team Liverpool fc are currently occupying number three position after playing four (4) matches, winning 3 and drawing one just one. The big question is that are we sure that we can hold on to this amazing performance, well it is too early to ask and to decide, let us continue to watch and see how things goes. I will continue to get us updated.\n\nPhotos from YouTube\n\nI will end the post here, have a nice day."
