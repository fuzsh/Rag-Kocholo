        "text": "Naby Keita is set to leave Werder Bremen just a year after joining the club from Liverpool following showdown talks with club bosses\n\nAfter leaving Liverpool at the end of his contract last summer, Naby Keita looks set to be on the move again after holding showdown talks with Werder Bremen bosses. The Guinean joined the Bundesliga outfit on a free transfer following his Reds exit, but was limited to just five appearances last season because of injury.\n\nHowever, he found himself suspended by the club and banished from first team training after refusing to travel for his side’s clash with Bayer Leverkusen after finding out he had been left out of the starting XI.\n\n‌\n\nDespite his club suspension, Keita was Guinea’s flag bearer at this summer’s Olympic Games in Paris, and captained them in the men’s football tournament this month as they suffered a group-stage exit.\n\nREAD MORE: Martin Zubimendi frustrated by transfer speculation before Liverpool target reported back for pre-seasonREAD MORE: Liverpool win seven-goal thriller as four players demoted and transfer decisions loom\n\nHis future in Bremen remained unresolved as a result as Werder delayed making a decision on whether to welcome the 29-year-old back into the first team squad.\n\n‌\n\nLiverpool Echo Icon\n\nSign up to FREE email alerts from Analysing Anfield\n\nWe use your sign-up to provide content in ways you’ve consented to and improve our understanding of you.

More info\n\nKeita reported back to the club on Monday and underwent medical tests, before holding talks with new head of first-team football, Peter Niemeyer.\n\n\"Naby is back in Bremen, Niemeyer confirmed to Bild at the start of the week. “The sports medical examinations will be carried out on Monday and Tuesday.\n\n“After that, we will sit down together to clarify how we will continue to support Naby and how he will train. We want to talk to each other in person, which hasn't been possible so far.\"\n\n‌\n\nShowdown talks with Keita have now been held, and Werder Bremen have confirmed that the former Liverpool midfielder will not re-join the first team squad. Instead continuing to train alone, both player and club have decided he will seek a move elsewhere.\n\nAn official club statement confirming their decision read: “Naby Keita will not return to team training with the first-team squad, and will undertake an individual training programme instead.\n\n‌\n\n“This decision followed a conversation between Naby, his agent, and the SV Werder Bremen sporting management team.”\n\nMeanwhile, director of football Clemens Fritz said of Keita’s situation: “It was a very open discussion, through which we arrived at a shared decision that we saw best for the situation.\n\n“Firstly, we wanted to keep full concentration on the rest of our pre-season and the start of the new campaign, and, secondly, Naby had been thinking this way for some time.\n\n‌\n\n“Since his situation within the team has not changed, he would like to look for a new challenge. Together with his agent, we want to sort this all out as soon as possible.”\n\nKeita signed a three-year contract after joining Werder Bremen on a free transfer last summer. He had made 129 appearances during five seasons at Liverpool after signing from RB Leipzig in a £52.75m deal.\n\n‌\n\nHowever, despite winning the Premier League, Champions League, FIFA Club World Cup, FA Cup, League Cup and European Super Cup with the Reds, Keita’s Anfield career was repeatedly plagued by injuries.\n\nHe was limited to just 13 appearances during his final season with the club, and was substituted at half-time in his last Liverpool appearance in a disappointing draw with Crystal Palace in February 2023."
