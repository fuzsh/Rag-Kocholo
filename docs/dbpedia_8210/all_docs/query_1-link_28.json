        "text": "Liverpool boasted one of the oldest squads in the Premier League last season but their summer business has changed that this year\n\n\"You can’t win anything with kids\".\n\nIt might be 28 years since Liverpool legend Alan Hansen uttered such words on Match of the Day, but it remains one of the most famous quotes in Premier League history.\n\n‌\n\nHaving seen Manchester United miss out on the title to Blackburn Rovers in 1994/95, the Scot made the infamous claim after the Red Devils had lost 3-1 to Aston Villa on the opening day of the 1995/96 season. That summer, Sir Alex Ferguson had brutally sold experienced players Mark Hughes, Paul Ince and Andrei Kanchelskis, despite their contributions to their trophy-laden efforts, and controversially not made any major signings.\n\nInstead, he drafted in the ‘Class of 92’, with Paul Scholes, David Beckham, Gary Neville, Nicky Butt and Phil Neville joining Ryan Giggs as first-team regulars after emerging from the Red Devils’ academy. Yet after that 3-1 opening day defeat to Villa, Hansen was most-critical of his former Scotland manager’s decision when appearing on Match of the Day.\n\nREAD MORE: Liverpool £40million transfer spotted in transit as squad break unwritten travel rule\n\n‌\n\nLiverpool Echo Icon\n\nSign up to FREE email alerts from Analysing Anfield\n\nWe use your sign-up to provide content in ways you’ve consented to and improve our understanding of you.

I wouldn't say they've got major problems,” he said. “Obviously three players have departed, the trick is always buy when you're strong so he (Sir Alex Ferguson) needs to buy players.\n\n“You can't win anything with kids. You look at that line-up from Manchester United today and Aston Villa at quarter-past two when they get the team sheet, it's just going to give them a lift.\n\n‌\n\n“It'll happen every time he plays the kids. He has got to buy players, it's as simple as that. The trick to winning the championship is strength in depth. They just haven't got it.”\n\nManchester United went on to make Hansen eat his words, winning a league and cup double in 1996 with the Red Devils’ famous ‘Class of ‘92’ all establishing themselves as key members of Ferguson’s team both that season and long into the future.\n\nEvidently, if you’re good enough, you’re old enough, with that generation just at the start of a domineering cycle. Ultimately, they would contribute significantly to United winning 13 league titles, seven domestic cups, and two Champions Leagues between 1993 and 2013 under Ferguson’s watch during the Premier League era.\n\n‌\n\nIn contrast to their fierce rivals, three decades on and Liverpool should perhaps argue that, rather than kids being the problem, you can’t win anything with veterans.\n\nHaving nearly won an unprecedented quadruple in 2021/22, Jurgen Klopp’s side would disappointingly follow it up by failing to qualify for the Champions League and not winning any major silverware last season. Stuck in transition, a squad that had previously won every major prize were accused of growing too old together.\n\n‌\n\nWhen the Reds opened the season by beating reigning champions Manchester City 3-1 in the Community Shield, a match which took place a year ago today, Klopp selected a starting XI which was Liverpool’s oldest, with (an average age of 29 years and 315 days), since 1953 (30 years and 39 days).\n\nContaining seven players over the age of 30 (Adrian, Joel Matip, Virgil van Dijk, Jordan Henderson, Thiago Alcantara, Roberto Firmino, and Mohamed Salah), Alisson would return in goal for the Premier League opener away at Fulham the following week as they fielded the side with the joint-highest average age (28.7 years, according to FBref, quoted by The Athletic).\n\nStill boasting six players aged 30 and over in their starting XI, it was the first time the Reds had selected such a side in a Premier League game since facing Southampton in February 1994. It’s worth noting that at such a time, when manager Graeme Souness was blooding younger players like Robbie Fowler and Steve McManaman in a struggling team, the Scot was still ruing the presence of so many ageing stars, who had previously won everything there was to win at Anfield during the 80s, in his playing ranks.\n\n‌\n\nWith Klopp using 28 players in the Premier League last season as Liverpool finished fifth, FBref credit their average age of 27.4 as the fourth-highest in the league - behind Fulham, West Ham United and Tottenham Hotspur. Meanwhile, Transfermarkt claims only the Hammers fielded a starting XI with a higher average age than the Reds.\n\nCrediting the XI that faced Fulham to boast an average age of 29.4, such a total was beaten by the side Klopp selected to face Crystal Palace in February 2023 as the two sides fought out a dismal 0-0 draw. With six players aged 30 or over in their starting XI, Transfermarkt lists the average age of that XI as 29.6 - the joint-third-highest total selected for a Premier League match last season behind two West Ham line-ups.\n\nCome the end of the campaign, the Reds would boast nine players over the age of 30 (Alisson, Adrian, Van Dijk, Matip, Henderson, Thiago, Milner, Firmino and Salah), with a further three (Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Fabinho and Andy Robertson) set to celebrate their 30th birthdays in 2023/24.\n\n‌\n\nFrom that list of 12, only Adrian and Thiago weren’t Liverpool players when they won the Champions League in 2018/19. Klopp’s ranks had won everything at the peak of their powers, but there was no escaping the fact that their efforts last year showed them to be a squad growing old together and past its prime.\n\nYet, the Reds are at least addressing such a fact with Milner, Firmino and Oxlade-Chamberlain all leaving the Reds at the end of their contracts this summer, while Henderson has completed a controversial switch to Saudi Arabian side Al-Ettifaq in a £12m deal. Meanwhile, Fabinho is expected to join him after Al-Ittihad agreed a £40m transfer.\n\nBeyond that, Adrian, Matip and Thiago are out of contract in 2024, while Liverpool’s summer business to date has seen them sign 24-year-old Alexis Mac Allister and 22-year-old Dominik Szoboszlai to bolster their midfield. They have also had a bid worth £38m rejected by Southampton for 19-year-old Romeo Lavia, with a deal reportedly likely to be agreed following the Saints’ relegation. A new centre-back is also likely to still be sought, as a long-term replacement for Van Dijk, with Levi Colwill the subject of admiration at Anfield, even if such a switch currently looks difficult with Chelsea adamant the 20-year-old is not for sale.\n\n‌\n\nBeyond such incomings, Stefan Bajcetic (18), Harvey Elliott (20), Curtis Jones (22) and Trent Alexander-Arnold, Ibrahima Konate, Cody Gakpo, and Darwin Nunez (all 24) ensure the Reds have still built a young core within their squad yet to enter its peak years.\n\nKlopp will still have elder statesmen in his squad and his starting XI, with Van Dijk and Salah contracted until 2025, and Alisson’s own deal running until 2027. For now, unlike any of the aforementioned departees, they remain guaranteed starters when available.\n\nIf we assume Liverpool do sign Lavia, then their starting XI on the opening day of the season against Chelsea could look something like: Alisson (30); Alexander-Arnold (24), Konate (24), Van Dijk (32), Robertson (29); Mac Allister (24), Lavia (19), Szoboszlai (22); Salah (31), Gakpo (24), Diaz (26). Admittedly not taking into account exact months and days, the average age of such an XI would stand at 25.9. According to FBref, only Southampton, Arsenal and Leeds United boasted a younger squad across last season.\n\n‌\n\nIn truth, that average age could be lowered even more. It would admittedly be a surprise if Klopp named three new signings in midfield at Stamford Bridge, with Jones or Elliott instead possible inclusions, and 20-year-old Conor Bradley also a possibility at right-back if Alexander-Arnold is required in the engine-room. Meanwhile, Nunez’s goalscoring form in pre-season could see him also elected to start.\n\nMeanwhile, for comparison, the Liverpool squad’s average age when winning the Premier League in 2019/20 was 26.6, while the average age of the starting XI which won the Champions League in 2019 was 26.7. Clearly, Klopp’s latest squad has plenty of room for growth in the years ahead.\n\nWhile last year’s side was at the end of its cycle, the new generation are only at the beginning of theirs. Far more than raw potential or over the hill stars, though it's clear they now possess a healthy blend, only time will tell how long it takes them to get the Reds back up to speed and if they can emulate the ageing heroes that went before them.\n\n‌\n\nUnlike Ferguson, Klopp has strengthened his squad while drafting in youngsters and discarding declining lieutenants. While not as brutal or ruthless an overhaul as the one at United in the 90s, with some Anfield exits out of their hands, this latest Liverpool squad is still no longer littered with veterans as their talented youngsters start to come into their own. Given the club's fortunes last year, such a thorough revamp is better later than never.\n\nWith the Reds' latest crop now set to age together themselves, their peak years are just around the corner."
