        "text": "John Robertson@ @robertson_johnContributor III\n\nLiverpool: Best Team of the Steven Gerrard Era\n\n0 of 12\n\nThis season has seen Steven Gerrard bag his 100th Premier League goal and record his 450th appearance in the competition.\n\nSo, what better way to celebrate than by looking over Gerrard's career and highlighting the best players that have lined up alongside him since his first-team debut in 1998.\n\nAfter all, while he's a great player, Gerrard has had some help along the way.\n\nThe following 11 players—including Gerrard himself—represent the best team you can field (in a traditional 4-4-2 formation) using players who have played alongside Gerrard.\n\nWith that in mind, a player's ability has been judged over the years he played for Liverpool while Gerrard was part of the first team.\n\nAs an example, Robbie Fowler's first stint with Liverpool took place between 1993 and 2001, but only his performances from 1998 to 2001 are eligible for judgement.\n\nEnjoy the list and make your opinion heard in the comments.\n\nPepe Reina\n\n1 of 12\n\nPosition: Goalkeeper\n\nNationality: Spanish\n\nAt Liverpool: 2005—Present (currently on loan with Napoli)Games played for Liverpool: 394 (at time of publishing)\n\nSigned from Spanish club Villarreal in the summer of 2005, Pepe Reina immediately took the starting goalkeeper role from Jerzy Dudek. For the next eight seasons, no one would come close to realistically winning the job from him.\n\nIn his first 50 games for Liverpool Reina kept 28 clean sets. His immediate success endeared him to the Anfield faithful, his clownish off-the-field antics endeared him to his team mates.\n\nReina won the Premier League's Golden Glove award over three consecutive seasons between 2005 and 2008, and he was named Liverpool's Player of the Season in 2009/10.\n\nCurrently still contracted to Liverpool, Pepe Reina is spending the 2013/14 season on loan with Napoli.\n\nJohn Arne Riise\n\n2 of 12\n\nPosition: Full-back\n\nNationality: Norwegian\n\nAt Liverpool: 2001—2008\n\nGames played for Liverpool: 348\n\nArguably the finest left-back in the Premier League during the height of his skills, John Arne Riise was the epitome of the modern full-back.\n\nQuick, a good dribbler and the possessor of a devastating shot and cross, Riise scored 33 goals for Liverpool before moving to A.S. Roma in 2008.\n\nDuring Liverpool's victory in the UEFA Champions League final of 2005, it was Riise that provided the cross for Gerrard's goal—a goal that would act as the catalyst to that most famous of comebacks in recent football history.\n\nRiise's 348 games for Liverpool puts him in the top 50 in terms of all-time appearances.\n\nJohn Arne Riise is currently contracted to Fulham FC.\n\nJamie Carragher\n\n3 of 12\n\nPosition: Centre-back/Full-back\n\nNationality: English\n\nAt Liverpool: 1996—2013\n\nGames played for Liverpool: 737\n\nWith 737 appearances for Liverpool, only Ian Callaghan has played for the club on more occasions than Jamie Carragher.\n\nCarragher made his professional debut in 1996, but it wasn't until his second season that he would become a regular in the first team. Since then, Carragher has been an ever-present presence in a defence that has changed often around him.\n\nLike a number of players on this list, Carragher immortalised himself during the UEFA Champions League final of 2005—a typically gutsy display helping to keep AC Milan at bay throughout injury time.\n\nJamie Carragher has retired from professional football. The very model of loyalty, he only ever played for Liverpool.\n\nSami Hyypia\n\n4 of 12\n\nPosition: Centre-back\n\nNationality: Finnish\n\nAt Liverpool: 1999—2009\n\nGames played for Liverpool: 464\n\nOne of the finest central defenders in Liverpool history and the best of the Gerrard-era, Sami Hyypia commanded the back line for 10 years.\n\nSigned from Eredivisie side Willem II in 1999, Hyypia was virtually unknown in England before his arrival at Anfield. However, it didn't take long for the Finnish enforcer to cement his place in the team.\n\nWhile at Anfield, Hyypia won the FA Cup, League Cup and UEFA Super Cup twice, along with the UEFA Cup and UEFA Champions League.\n\nSami Hyypia is currently the manager of Bayer Leverkusen.\n\nSteve Finnan\n\n5 of 12\n\nPosition: Full-back\n\nNationality: Irish\n\nAt Liverpool: 2003—2008\n\nGames played for Liverpool: 217\n\nOften the forgotten man of Rafa Benitez's reign at Anfield, Steve Finnan started the UEFA Champions League finals of 2005 and 2007.\n\nHis 217 appearances for Liverpool makes the Irishman one of the 100 most capped players in the club's history. In that time, Finnan scored just a single goal for Liverpool but it was his ability to provide width and crosses that made him a key part of the team when in possession.\n\nSteve Finnan finished his career with Portsmouth, retiring in 2010.\n\nXabi Alonso\n\n6 of 12\n\nPosition: Midfield\n\nNationality: Spanish\n\nAt Liverpool: 2004—2009\n\nGames played for Liverpool: 210\n\nA player blessed with world-class passing, an uncanny ability to read the game and excellent teamwork skills, Xabi Alonso has proved to be the finest midfield partner Steven Gerrard has ever had.\n\nA tireless worker, Alonso was equally skilled in cutting open a defence as he was at defending—the kind of \"box-to-box\" midfielder that is so important in the majority of modern formations.\n\nBecause he is still one of the best central midfielders in the world today, Liverpool fans were left understandably worried when he was sold to Spanish giants Real Madrid in 2009 for a fee thought to be around £30 million.\n\nXabi Alonso currently plays for Real Madrid.\n\nSteven Gerrard\n\n7 of 12\n\nPosition: Midfield\n\nNationality: English\n\nAt Liverpool: 1998—Present\n\nGames played for Liverpool: 641 (at time of publishing)\n\nThe best player of the Steven Gerrard-era is, of course, Steven Gerrard.\n\nThrough UEFA Champions League victories, squad rebuilding, numerous managers and new owners, Steven Gerrard has been a stabilising force and the figurehead of the club.\n\nAn iconic figure for Liverpool FC, and world football as a whole, Gerrard has cemented his position as one of the greatest players ever to don the red jersey.\n\nGerrard currently sits seventh in terms of all-time Liverpool appearances and number of goals scored.\n\nThis season he joined the elite club of players with 100 or more Premier League goals.\n\nAt 33 years of age, Gerrard has managed to successfully adapt his game to suit his reducing speed and stamina levels. As a result the Liverpool captain remains a key player and leader at the club.\n\nBarring injury, Gerrard will captain England at World Cup 2014 in Brazil.\n\nLuis Garcia\n\n8 of 12\n\nPosition: Midfield\n\nNationality: Spanish\n\nAt Liverpool: 2004—2007\n\nGames played for Liverpool: 121\n\nWhile Luis Garcia did not stay at Liverpool for as long as the other players on this list, his impact is no less important.\n\nIn his first season, Garcia played a major role in getting Liverpool to the 2005 UEFA Champions League final, scoring winning goals against Juventus and Chelsea in the quarter-finals and semi-finals, respectively.\n\nAlthough, of course, the \"Ghost Goal\" against Chelsea was shown to have never actually crossed the line.\n\nInjury and a desire to return to his native Spain cut the rest of Luis Garcia's Liverpool career short, but his contributions to the most successful period of the club's history for over 20 years will not be forgotten.\n\nLuis Garcia is currently playing in Mexico for Club Universidad Nacional (UNAM).\n\nDirk Kuyt\n\n9 of 12\n\nPosition: Midfield\n\nNationality: Dutch\n\nAt Liverpool: 2006—2012\n\nGames played for Liverpool: 285\n\nDirk Kuyt arrived from Feyenoord as a striker with a reputation as a goal machine. In 101 Eredivisie appearances for the Dutch club, Kuyt bagged himself 71 goals.\n\nWith Liverpool, however, Kuyt was transformed and would go on to predominantly play on the right wing.\n\nA large part of Kuyt's effectiveness in midfield came from his incredible level of fitness. At the final whistle Kuyt would rarely seem any more fatigued than he was in the first minute.\n\nHis dedication to playing on the wing, having been so effective as a striker in Holland, stands as testament to Kuyt's professionalism and desire to do what is best for the team.\n\nOften overlooked and often disregarded by opposing fans, Kuyt is one of the finest players to have graced Anfield since the turn of the century.\n\nDirk Kuyt left Liverpool in 2012 and is currently playing for Fenerbahce in Turkey.\n\nLuis Suarez\n\n10 of 12\n\nFernando Torres\n\n11 of 12\n\nPosition: Forward\n\nNationality: Spanish\n\nAt Liverpool: 2007—2011\n\nGames played for Liverpool: 142\n\nSuarez's strike ratio of 0.56 goals per game is impressive, but Fernando Torres manages to do slightly better. With 81 goals in 142 appearances, Spain's greatest export of the time notched up a ratio of 0.57.\n\nTorres made an immediate impact at Anfield after signing from Atletico Madrid in 2007, becoming the first Liverpool player since Robbie Fowler to score 20 or more goals in a single season.\n\nDuring the summer of 2011, Torres signed for rivals Chelsea in a transfer worth £50 million—a move that did little to endear him further to The Kop.\n\nHowever, it was thought in some circles that the striker's best days were already behind him.\n\nFernando Torres is currently playing for Chelsea.\n\nThe Subs Bench\n\n12 of 12\n\nGoalkeeper: Jerzy Dudek\n\nDefenders: Markus Babbel, Daniel Agger\n\nMidfielders: Dietmar Hamann, Javier Mascherano\n\nForwards: Michael Owen, Robbie Fowler\n\nFollow me on Twitter: @robertson_john\n\nX"
