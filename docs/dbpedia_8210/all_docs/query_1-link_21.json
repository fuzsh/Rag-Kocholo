        "text": "“Liverpool FC has revealed its latest collaboration with Warrior, completing the 2013/14 range with its new third kit design.\n\n“Building on Liverpool FC’s history of iconic, statement-making kits, design inspiration stemmed from the Club’s 1995/96 away strip.\n\n“‘The third kit completes a strong and dynamic range of new season looks for LFC,’ says Richard Wright, head of Warrior Football. ‘The kit not only delivers a technical story, but also looks striking and unique on the pitch.’\n\n“Ian Ayre, Managing Director at Liverpool FC, agreed by saying: ‘The third strip completes our full kit for the 2013/14 campaign and we are delighted to share with fans a kit range that has a mix of historic and contemporary touches. The team will play in the third kit during appropriate domestic cup games and away Premier League fixtures.’\n\n“Set over a dominant black base with striking white and purple trim details, the paneling first seen on the 1995/96 away shirt has been reworked into three contemporary tiles and consists of the full colour palette.\n\n“Contrast panels on the shirt’s sleeves reflect detailing in the socks, while colour-blocked shorts work to balance the overall look.\n\n“In line with the home and away versions, an embroidered Liver Bird sits prominently as the Club crest, while two commemorative Eternal Flames and a 96 logo are positioned on the nape of the neck.\n\n“Constructed using War-Tech, Warrior’s revolutionary apparel technology system, the away kit is powered by breathable, moisture-wicking War-Tech fabric. Four-way stretch mesh paneling under the arms and across the back of the shirt facilitates optimum ventilation, allowing for added comfort and temperature control in core heat areas.”"
