        "text": "Two goalkeepers, Tomas Tomic and Michael Probst, were assigned numbers 22 and 23 respectively but neither featured in the yearbook.\n\nSamuel Kuffour spent the season on loan at Nürnberg in the 2.Bundesliga. When he returned for 1996-97, 13 had been given to new signing Mario Basler and so the centre-back wore number 15 – he would go on to switch to 4 in 1997.\n\nAlain Sutter, who had 15 in 1995-96 but didn’t know why, left the club for Freiburg during that campaign – he wore 25 at his new club but we don’t know his feelings about that.\n\nWhen paired up front with Klinsmann in Europe, Jean-Pierre Pain had to cede his favoured number 9 to the Germany international and wear 11 instead.\n\nThe other player with a 1-11 squad number who wore a different digit in Europe was Thomas Strunz. He was most often used as a wing-back and, with 8 given to a midfielder (most usually Ciriaco Sforza) in the Uefa Cup, Strunz wore 4 as Markus Babbel wore 2 at centre-back."
