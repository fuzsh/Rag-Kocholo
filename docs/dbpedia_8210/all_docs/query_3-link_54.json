        "text": "During Liverpool’s three pre-season friendlies on their tour of the United States, only one position had a different starter in all three matches: the No 6.\n\nWataru Endo, Dominik Szoboszlai and Ryan Gravenberch were all deployed at the start of matches in that role by new head coach Arne Slot. While the latter two impressed, Endo — Liverpool’s most natural prototypical No 6 — struggled and saw his role reduced as the tour continued.\n\nIt is no surprise then that after Slot assessing some of the squad he’s inherited at Anfield over the last month, it is the No 6 position Liverpool have decided to make their priority in the transfer market.\n\nReal Sociedad’s Martin Zubimendi — who has a €60million (£51.6m) release clause — is the main target and his club expect the Spain international midfielder to agree a move to Liverpool. The fact that Liverpool have targeted Zubimendi makes it clearer what they want in the position.\n\nIt used to be a case of: think No 6, think midfield destroyer. For so long, the stereotype for a holding midfielder was an aggressive, tough-tackling shield who allowed others to flourish when his team had possession, usually because he’d won it back.\n\nYet the description above is becoming more and more outdated and, especially for top sides, a No 6 needs to be just as good — if not better — in possession as they are out of it.\n\nYou don’t shout “Kill them with passes!” to your players during a training session if your style is anything other than possession-based. Those were the instructions from Slot and his coaching staff on the U.S. tour.\n\nFor that brand of football to be efficient and effective, every player needs to possess the technical quality to be comfortable and secure on the ball. Within that, it can’t be underestimated how vital Slot believes the No 6 position to be.\n\nLiverpool’s build-up play has begun from deep in their friendlies, aiming to bait opponents into pressing before playing through them. The midfielders the 45-year-old Dutchman has inherited from Jurgen Klopp have been tested, knowing they will be under pressure when receiving the ball facing their own goal.\n\nThe 4-2-4 build-up with a staggered pivot is not the only plan Slot has used during his coaching career to build out from the back, but consistent is the presence of a deep midfielder needed to knit everything together.\n\nSlot’s first idea in possession is to go through the centre. There, the No 6 must be technically skilled, capable of playing in small spaces and have the qualities to play forward at the right moments, speeding up the game and attacking space.\n\nEven when opponents force Slot sides wide, the aim is to bring the ball back into the centre, and the No 6 must be able to play between the lines and switch play.\n\nIt would be extreme to suggest that not having a No 6 with the technical proficiency to confidently execute passes and progress play would see Slot’s system fail, but for a team aiming to dominate possession, the importance of those attributes cannot be understated.\n\nAlexis Mac Allister, yet to feature for Slot after his extended involvement in Copa America this summer, provides another potential solution. On paper, the Argentina international ticks a lot of the boxes required and, when operating in the No 6 role last season, proved he could handle its defensive duties. However, many believe his best position is further up the pitch, and Liverpool’s transfer movement suggests Slot may feel similarly.\n\nZubimendi has spent his time in Spain at the base of a Real Sociedad midfield diamond dictating play as the focal point for their deep build-up. He is intelligent and calm. He is always creating space to be available for a pass, and isn’t scared to receive the ball under pressure or make the risky pass which could open up the game.\n\nHowever, he has strong loyalties to La Real, having graduated from their academy, which he joined aged 12, to become one of the San Sebastian club’s senior stars. He would need to be convinced to leave Spain, something other Premier League suitors have not managed to do.\n\n“(Next season) I’m going to be at Real Sociedad. I have a contract with Real Sociedad and that’s where I feel most comfortable,” Zubimendi told Spanish publication El Diario Vasco during the recent European Championship.\n\nDuring his time in La Real’s B team, Zubimendi briefly worked with former Liverpool and Spain midfielder Xabi Alonso, and he has credited the now Bayer Leverkusen manager for helping him understand the concepts of build-up play and recognising opposition pressing setups.\n\n“He has that ability to generate play, to make those around him better, always offering solutions; to improve the move,” Alonso said of Zubimendi in 2022. “He understands what the next step is before the ball gets to him. He has that ability to organise the axis. I loved working with him.”\n\nThere has been no bid from Liverpool yet and Real Sociedad are only prepared to consider a sale if the 25-year-old wants to go.\n\nIf a deal to sign Zubimendi does not happen, it does not necessarily mean Liverpool will move on to a different target. One of the reasons a bid from French club Marseille for Endo was rejected was because of the limited alternatives and difficult market.\n\nSlot admitted when quizzed on the No 6 positions that he has several options already – yet their interest in Zubimendi may have revealed that he hasn’t got his perfect one yet.\n\nGO DEEPER\n\nLiverpool target Martin Zubimendi is the Gen-Z Sergio Busquets at the heart of Real Sociedad's midfield\n\n(Top photo: Martin Zubimendi; Adrian Dennis/AFP via Getty Images)"
