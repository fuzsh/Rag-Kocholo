        "text": "With the Guardian’s unstoppable rise to global dominance** we at Guardian US thought we’d run a series of articles for fans wishing to improve their knowledge of the sports history and storylines, hopefully in a way that doesn’t patronise you to within an inch of your life. A warning: If you’re the kind of person that finds The Blizzard too populist this may not be the series for you.\n\n** Actual dominance may not be global. Or dominant\n\nThere hasn’t been a period of dominance like it. Between 1973 and 1990, Liverpool Football Club won 11 English league championships, three FA Cups, four League Cups, two Uefa Cups, one European Super Cup, and four European Cups. The 11th of those league titles was their 18th in total, twice the number of the joint-second most-successful clubs in terms of English championships, Everton and Arsenal. Behind those two, on seven titles apiece, were Aston Villa and Manchester United. Liverpool were totally dominant, in complete control.\n\nWell, they sure as hell let that one slip.\n\nOf course, everything’s all relative, and fans of Hull City and Plymouth Argyle and Leyton Orient and AFC Wimbledon will join together, with feeling, to perform a symphony on the world’s smallest violins. Since that 1990 championship, Liverpool have won three FA Cups, four League Cups, another Uefa Cup, another two European Super Cups, and most famously of all, a gloriously absurd Champions League. What most clubs in world football would give for a demise like this.\n\nBut there’s one prize Liverpool covet above all. The prize their legendary boss Bill Shankly referred to as the “bread and butter”. The league. And since 1990, they’ve notoriously – and painfully or hilariously, depending on your point of view – failed to add to their historic tally of 18 titles. After a Premier League era romp, Manchester United are now the most successful club in English league history, with 20 title wins to their name. Arsenal have slowly chipped away at Liverpool’s once-proud lead too, coming up on the rail with 13 titles. Everton and Villa … well, we probably shouldn’t have brought them into it; they’re still on nine and seven respectively. But you can see the overall picture.\n\nLiverpool’s demise – their relative demise – has some roots in off-field factors. Despite being at the forefront of shirt advertising in the late 1970s – Hitachi television sets, for the record – the club were woefully unprepared for the freewheeling capitalism of the Premier League, a bandwagon which set off in 1992 and left them choking on dust. More tragically, the club, its players and most of all its fanbase had to deal with the horrors of Heysel and Hillsborough.\n\nField Notes proposes to simply touch upon what happened on the pitch. The beginning of the end of Liverpool’s imperial phase is usually considered to be the resignation as manager of Kenny Dalglish, emotionally drained by Hillsborough, in February 1991, followed by the appointment of Graeme Souness. Though Souness was a former captain of the club – he lifted the 1984 European Cup and was unquestionably the club’s greatest ever midfielder (think Roy Keane only with a proper cob on) – he wasn’t steeped in the old-school values of the Boot Room, the cubby hole where, through the years, former managers Shankly, Bob Paisley, Joe Fagan and Dalglish (among others) had met to exchange ideas and formulate plans.\n\nSouness’s scorched-earth policy of selling most of the team’s established stars – Steve McMahon, Ray Houghton, Steve Staunton and, most ludicrously, Peter Beardsley – didn’t exactly fit in with the old Boot Room ethos of quietly but religiously keeping the team churning over with one or two fresh-faced upgrades each year. It certainly didn’t help. But then it didn’t help that he correctly identified the need to take some sort of drastic action in the first place. Dalglish had famously reinvigorated his team back in 1987 by signing Beardsley, John Barnes and John Aldridge, the result being one of the most free-flowing sides in English history. Only a shock FA Cup final defeat by Wimbledon (though they were a side grossly underrated both then and now) denied them a deserved league-and-cup Double. But he then rather strangely neglected to introduce any additional significant new talent. And by 1991, the team had grown old together.\n\nSouness admittedly went about the reboot in a cack-handed way – Dean Saunders, Paul Stewart, Julian Dicks and Nigel Clough were nowhere near title-standard players – though in truth something had to be done. Liverpool were still in the 1990-91 title race when Dalglish resigned, but by the time Souness took over the jig was up, and Arsenal had overtaken Liverpool’s tired and mentally shot squad. Souness won the FA Cup the following season, but his new-look team finished sixth, their worst league campaign since 1965. The team’s shirts symbolised Liverpool’s abrupt and shocking descent into mediocrity: an off-the-peg Adidas template, the company stripes draped asymmetrically over one shoulder, was also worn by several other clubs around Europe. For all intents and purposes, then, Liverpool were suddenly just another average team in the pack.\n\nThings would deteriorate further under Souness. The 1992-93 season soon saw Liverpool – who, pre-Souness, had finished out of the top two once in 18 seasons – initially floundering in 16th position in the new Premier League, a couple of points above the relegation places. They were held 4-4 by third-tier Chesterfield at Anfield in the League Cup, knocked out of the Cup Winners Cup 6-2 on aggregate by Spartak Moscow, sent packing in the FA Cup by third-tier Bolton Wanderers, and lost 5-1 in the league at Coventry City. They rallied to finish sixth again, but by now the bond between Souness and the fanbase was long broken, the manager having the previous season sold the story of his heart bypass to the Sun newspaper, a shower who had wantonly lied in their reporting of the Hillsborough disaster and were rightfully reviled on Merseyside.\n\nRoy Evans, who played for the club a few times during the 1960s but was fast-tracked into the Boot Room instead, was drafted in as Souness’s right-hand man. But Souness couldn’t be saved. Another lame FA Cup exit the following season, at home to yet another lower-division side in Bristol City, forced the manager’s resignation. Evans took over, promising prettier football and a return to boot-room basics.\n\nHe achieved this well enough. His team – built around the young goalscoring tyro Robbie Fowler and wispy aesthete Steve McManaman, and later magnificently bolstered by one of English football’s genuine lost talents, the one-season hit Stan Collymore – were on their day the most exciting in the country. They could have won the league in 1995-96; they should have won the league a year later. But they were prone to flakiness. Alex Ferguson’s Manchester United, meanwhile, had long worked out exactly how to get the job done – grafting attractive football to, well, graft – and deservedly won both of those titles, plus the 1996 FA Cup final between the clubs, a match so bad folk only remember Liverpool’s rather fetching (is it just Field Notes?) white Armani suits.\n\nEvans’ side were never quite the same after letting slip a two-goal lead at Chelsea in the 1996-97 FA Cup. They had also been top of the league at the time, but that 4-2 defeat knocked the stuffing out of the team – central defender Bjorn Tore Kvarme might still be spinning, Mark Hughes and Gianluca Vialli having run so many rings around him – and their form disintegrated.\n\nAnd so it was around this point in Liverpool’s history, with their first winnable titles since 1991 having gone begging, that a big club’s bog-standard wait for their next title became – like Manchester United all those years ago – A Thing. Of some considerable weight, as Gerard Houllier, Rafael Benitez and Brendan Rodgers, all of whom subsequently suffered near misses in second place, never quite keeping their heads long enough to haul themselves over the line, would attest. You’re up next, Jurgen.\n\nFerguson later talked of his glee at having knocked Liverpool “off their fucking perch”. He hadn’t actually done the deed himself, of course – George Graham’s Arsenal, by winning the title in 1989 with Michael Thomas’s famous last-gasp dink at Anfield, and again in 1991 in the wake of Dalglish’s resignation, were the team to do that. But then again, it was Fergie and his United side who made sure Liverpool permanently stayed off it. For had Evans’ side had been allowed to hop back on in 1996 or 1997, the landscape of English league football would be a whole lot different now.\n\nScott Murray is co-author, with Jonathan Wilson, of The Anatomy of Liverpool: A History in Ten Matches (Bloomsbury)"
