        "text": "Following Liverpool's establishment in 1892, Bill Shankly made the choice to change their strip colour to the renowned red, posing a 'threat' to rival teams. The colour scheme has a psychological impact, with red representing danger and strength, and Shankly was therefore in charge of shaping Liverpool's image.\n\nShankly left a successful legacy, having won three League Championships and the European Cup, setting the way for Bob Paisley and Joe Fagan to lead the reds and see many more victories in the future.\n\n1988/89\n\nThe 88/89 Adidas home kit is notable for being the first to feature Candy, the renowned sponsor of home appliances. The red jersey is sleek and vintage, with Adidas stripes on the shoulders providing a beautiful outline to the red-based shirt. The grey contrasts wonderfully with the red design on the away jersey, making it a fan favourite.\n\nThis season, renowned players John Barnes and Jan Molby were joined by player manager Kenny Dalglish to govern the red and white. The reds finished second in the league, which was a letdown after prior achievements.\n\nAlthough this season is iconic in its uniform and players, it was overshadowed by one of sports most tragic disasters. This season saw the Hillsborough disaster take place, involving a fatal human crush at Hillsborough stadium, resulting in the deaths of 97 Liverpool fans attending the FA Cup semi-final.\n\n1989/90\n\nThis year would be the last year Liverpool won a title for 30 years. John Barnes, one of Liverpool's finest ever players, dominated the season, scoring 28 goals. Kenny Dalglish, Liverpool's player manager, led the club to the league title and was on pace to win the FA Cup until falling 4-3 to Crystal Palace in the semi-finals.\n\nThe red home jersey is largely identical to the previous season's, with geometric motifs added to bring some flair and innovation to the Adidas top.\n\n1990/91\n\nDespite reproducing the shirt, they were unable to replicate in the rankings, finishing second and narrowly losing out on the championship. However, this was a momentous year for Dalglish, who suffered after Hillsborough and announced his retirement in April. Graeme Souness, an ex-Liverpool captain, took his position.\n\nFollowing his hiring, two young players arrived who would go on to dominate Liverpool for the following ten years – Steve McManaman and Jamie Redknapp. The 90s roster was certainly legendary, with some notable Liverpool players such as Ian Rush, Bruce Gobbelaar, and John Barnes among them.\n\n1991/92\n\nMost notably, this was Liverpool's 100th season in club history. Graeme Souness’s first full season as manager was a success. Despite having some personal health issues, he was able to attend the FA Cup final, which Liverpool won. Graeme made significant changes to the roster, bringing in Dean Saunders up attack, and Mark Wright in defence.\n\nThe 91/92 home jersey was one of the most distinctive and retro-looking Adidas has ever released, with the trademark three stripes hugging the shoulder and the away strip being similar in a solid green backdrop.\n\n1992/93\n\nThe 92/93 jersey looked a lot like the previous year's, except with a Carlsberg sponsor change.\n\nThis shirt was used by Liverpool players during their first year in the official Premier League. Liverpool finished sixth in the league in their first professional season, having won no trophies and so missing out on European competition the following season. Notably, David 'calamity' James was signed by Liverpool.\n\n1993/94\n\nGraeme Souness re-signed in January after Liverpool's previous terrible year. Roy Evans, a long-serving assistant coach who aided Bob Paisley, took over as the team's full-time manager.\n\nThis season witnessed the entrance of Robbie Fowler, affectionately known as 'God' by Liverpool fans. In his first 13 senior fixtures, Fowler scored 12 goals. This newcomer had a remarkable partnership with Liverpool's all-time top scorer, Ian Rush.\n\nThe famous three stripes were moved below the Carlsberg sponsor and detailed either side of Liverpool's 93/94 Adidas jersey. Subtle green detailing outlined the white and red perfectly on the collar.\n\n1994/95\n\nRobbie Fowler, a teenage star, played his first complete season, scoring 31 goals in all competitions. Liverpool ascended to fourth place in the Premier League after winning the League Cup for a record sixth time.\n\nThe home and away jerseys are identical to the 93/94 jerseys, except the goalkeeper jersey, which features a multi-color pattern, may be even more contentious than last season's.\n\n1995-96\n\nLiverpool improved in the 95/96 season, finishing third in the league and runners-up in the FA Cup. Liverpool contested the FA Cup final against Man United, losing to an Eric Cantona goal, with a youthful assault of Liverpool born and bred players – Steve McManaman and Robbie Fowler - with Robbie Fowler being the league's second highest scorer.\n\nThis season also marked the end of an era, with Ian Rush playing his final game for Liverpool, scoring in his final ever game, and scoring 346 goals for Liverpool overall.\n\nThe 95/96 jersey had a more basic design to it, with the Adidas emblem lying simply on the chest. Carlsberg and the thick-lined collar were carried over, but the away jersey had a checkered design, keeping the motif of \"the green spark.\"\n\n1996/97\n\nOn New Year's Day, Liverpool led the table for what looked like the whole season until they were passed by Manchester United, indicating that Liverpool squandered their opportunity.\n\nDespite Robbie Fowler scoring 31 goals, they finished fourth in the league. Michael Owen, one of Liverpool's younger players and potential stars, made his debut this season. This season is often regarded as Liverpool's missed opportunity; they undoubtedly had the greatest squad and forward line in the league and should have won the title.\n\nThe Liverpool crest was accentuated with a striking white oval on this season's first collared home shirt, making the design a standout on each home jersey. The away strip was distinctive and cream-coloured, with a round collar, and it was the first year that the Reebok branding was used.\n\n1997/98\n\nLiverpool was in contention for the Premier League title for the whole 97/98 season but were unable to defeat Arsenal.\n\nThey wore the same home jersey as the previous season, but with a bright yellow and red away jersey that deviated from the usual.\n\n1998/99\n\nLiverpool had a dismal season in 98/99. With the unusual choice to employ two coaches as joint coaches - Gerard Houllier and Roy Evans - Roy Evans opted to retire before November. The club gradually acclimated to the new coach, and after losing star Steve McManaman to Real Madrid, Liverpool finished seventh and failed to qualify for the UEFA Cup.\n\nThe Reebok-designed round collar for the 98/99 home jersey mimics the basic yet nostalgic style of the 96/97 away jersey.\n\n1999-00\n\nMichael Owen scored 12 goals in 30 appearances during the 99/00 season. Houllier sought to rebuild his team by bringing in seven new players, including Smicer, and forming a long-term central defence pairing with Henchoz and Sami Hyypia.\n\nLiverpool was contending for the league title, but the season concluded with some unfortunate events, leaving them in fourth place.\n\nLiverpool wore the same home strip as the previous season, but debuted a new green away strip with a familiar collar that recalled an iconic, nostalgic style.\n\n2000/01\n\nThis was a huge year for the reds, their most successful season in 11 years.\n\nLiverpool finished the year with three cups (FA Cup, League Cup, and UEFA Cup) won in a row, before finishing third in the league. Michael Owen scored two goals in the FA Cup final, one of which was a 'miracle' goal.\n\nThe home jersey for the 00/01 season was entirely red, with a collar and a white, narrow line around the neck.\n\n01/02\n\nThe reds had high expectations after finishing third in the league the previous season and earning a historic treble.\n\nLiverpool qualified for the UEFA Champions League for the first time in Premier League history this season but were eliminated in the quarter finals.\n\nFollowing a situation caused by Manager Houllier's illness during a game against Leeds United, assistant manager Phil Thompson was forced to step up and assume responsibility. After relinquishing their advantage in December, Liverpool finished second in the Premier League.\n\nThe home jersey for the 01/02 season was the same as the previous year's, but the yellow away kit was shifted into the third kit's position, replaced with a white away strip with black and yellow colouring.\n\n02/03\n\nLiverpool lost 0-1 at Middlesborough in November after starting the season on top of the standings after the first 12 games, four points ahead of Arsenal. Despite only dropping one point, Liverpool fell into a downward cycle of defeats that left them without a win for the following 13 games. Despite finishing fifth in the league, the reds were still able to win the League Cup.\n\nThe home jersey for the 02/03 season featured a modern Reebok design, with the crest and Carlsberg logo in the middle of the shirt, right below the white lining around the high neckline. The all-black away strip stands out, as does the red v-line around the collar and shaping the grey and black sleeves.\n\n03/04\n\nLiverpool ended the 03/04 Premier League season in fourth place, and this was Gerard Houlliers' final season in command of the club.\n\nThe home jersey remained the same as the previous season, while the away jersey had a white shirt with red and black lines down the shoulders and a green Carlsberg emblem in the centre.\n\n04/05\n\nDespite their lack of domestic success, Liverpool won the UEFA Champions League after placing fifth in the Premier League, beating Milan in the final.\n\nRafael Benitez took over as manager after Gerard Houllier stepped down at the end of last season. Along with this, numerous new players were added, notably Xabi Alonso and Luis Garcia.\n\nThe 04/05 home jersey is similar to the previous season’s, but without the white collar. The away jersey, on the other hand, is another traditional Liverpool appearance, with the light yellow, black, and dark green colours all working well together.\n\n05/06\n\nLiverpool concluded the 05/06 season in third place on the table, but they were still able to win the FA Cup for the seventh time by defeating West Ham United in the finals on penalties.\n\nTo no one's surprise, the all-time favourite, Steven Gerrard, finished the season as Liverpool's leading goal scorer, with 23 goals.\n\n06/07\n\nAdidas revived an iconic style this season, reintroducing the collar and three stripes down the sleeves. The reds finished third on the table, nine points behind winners Chelsea. Liverpool won the FA Cup for the eighth time on penalties, defeating West Ham United.\n\n07/08\n\nThis season was fairly successful, with the redmen using the same home strip as the previous season, securing a Champions League slot for next year after finishing fourth, and reaching the Champions League semi-finals this season. Fernando Torres was in top form this season, scoring 33 goals across all competitions.\n\n08/09\n\nLiverpool finished second in the league for the first time since the 01/02 season, and they won the double over Manchester United with two wins, which pleased Liverpool fans at home.\n\nLast year's jersey was repeated this season; however the collar was updated and the jersey was enhanced with checkers inside the back of the neck.\n\n09/10\n\nLiverpool finished eighth in the league in 09/10, a poor season. However, the players saw some light at the end of the tunnel after reaching the Europa League semi-finals.\n\nThe black, gold, and red hues of this season's away shirt complement renowned players like Steven Gerrard and Fernando Torres.\n\n10/11\n\nDespite a disappointing start to the season under Roy Hodgson, Liverpool's manager was eventually replaced by Kenny Dalglish, and the club finished in sixth position in the standings.\n\nThis season saw a switch from Carlsberg to Standard Chartered, polishing last season's Adidas home strip.\n\n11/12\n\nDespite the joint leadership of Dalglish and Gerrard, the club finished eighth in the league this season. Despite this, Luis Suarez managed to score 17 goals across all competitions.\n\nLiverpool's fondness for black away strips has continued this season, with the players sporting an iconic appearance.\n\n12/13\n\nFollowing the arrival of manager Brendan Rodgers, the redmen improved marginally this season, finishing sixth on the standings.\n\nThe Liverpool crest was changed to a simpler depiction of the 'Liver-bird' this season, and the Warrior brand replaced Adidas. The home shirt was red and gold, whereas the away jersey was unpopular with supporters.\n\n13/14\n\nLiverpool improved dramatically in the 13/14 season, and finished second in the league, qualifying for the Champions League for the first time since the 09/10 season. Despite narrowly missing out on their first league victory in 24 years, the men chose a sleek shirt to go out with a bang.\n\n14/15\n\nLiverpool finished sixth in the league this season, while appearing in the Champions League for the first time since 2009.\n\nThe 14/15 away strip was famous for its distinctive yellow colour scheme.\n\n15/16\n\nJordan Henderson took over as captain for the first time this season when Steven Gerrard left the club.\n\nThis year's shirt included a new sponsorship from New Balance, and it was worn by new recruits such as Roberto Firmino and Divock Origi.\n\n16/17\n\nJurgen Klopp's first full season in charge was the 16/17 season, and supporters witnessed an immediate difference after finishing fourth in the league. Sadio Mane and Philippe Coutinho both thrived under Klopp's management.\n\nThe redmen wore a home shirt with a buttoned collar and red and gold hues.\n\n17/18\n\nThis season saw the arrival of Mohamad Salah, who went on to score 44 goals in total. Despite placing fourth in the league once more, the boys finished second in the Champions League.\n\nThis season's jerseys were refined, with the white V-necked home jersey complementing the white and green checkered away strip quite nicely.\n\n18/19\n\nLiverpool came close to completing their 29-year wait to win the Premier League this season, finishing with a record-breaking 97 points. However, they won the Champions League for the sixth time, ending a seven-year trophy drought.\n\nJurgen Klopp's team did so in style, sporting a sleek New Balance shirt with a collar and buttons to emulate the vintage appearance.\n\n19/20\n\nThis season, Liverpool won the league title for the first time since 1990 after winning the Champions League last season, cruising to victory with seven games remaining. They also won the Super Cup and the Club World Cup.\n\nThe 19/20 home jersey varied from the previous season's in that it had a basic round collar that defined the red and gold.\n\n20/21\n\nThe reds began the season as English champions, having qualified for the Community Shield for the second year in a row.\n\nDespite placing third in the league, the reds donned a fresh, modern take on Liverpool by Nike, with the aqua blue away strip colours underlining the sleeves and collar of the home shirt.\n\n21/22\n\nThe reds finished second on the table this season despite winning the FA Cup and League Cup.\n\nThe 21/22 home jersey featured diagonal faint white stripes along the body and a vivid orange ring around the neck. The away strip was a signature style for the guys, with a white foundation and a green collar and buttoned vintage flair.\n\n22/23\n\nThe reds' most recent season was dismal, as they finished fifth and failed to qualify for the Champions League for the first time since the 15/16 season.\n\nThis frustrating season sore the players wear an all-red home shirt that was perfectly complemented with a swirled, marble pattern away jersey.\n\n23/24\n\nThe season 23/24 may be described as Klopp's season of re-building and re-instilling optimism in Liverpool fans.\n\nThe Liverpool 23/24 home jersey was recently manufactured in a retro-inspired Nike style to commemorate the 1973/74 FA Cup-winning side, which was Bill Shankly's 14th and last season as manager of Liverpool.\n\nThe basic design has a white round collar and cuffs, as well as all emblems in white. The jersey is comparable to the Reebok home jersey worn from 1998 to 2000.\n\nShare this:"
