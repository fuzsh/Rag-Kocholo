        "text": "Arriving as the second instalment in their 23/24 repertoire following the already launched home shirt, Liverpool get a homage-fuelled away shirt from Nike, updating the design from 1995/96 with a modernised take that presents the quartered white and green look in a modernised, pixelated execution. Of course, this is not the first homage to the adidas-produced original, with New Balance having produced a similar effort back in 2017/18.\n\nThis jersey features the green and white quarter pattern with black collar and cuff, updated with a digital effect treatment layering tonal greens – green spark, poison green and pine green – for a modern twist.\n\nThe men’s team will debut this kit against Leicester City during the pre-season tour in Singapore, while the women’s team will also debut it during their pre-season matches in late August.\n\nAs one of the iconic players to have worn the shirt in its original incarnation, club legend, Robbie Fowler said: “I have fond memories of the 1995-96 season because of the iconic white and green away strip and for scoring my most goals in one season. I’m a huge fan of the new fresh take on the white and green away kit.”"
