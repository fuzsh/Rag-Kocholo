        "text": "Another hugely successful #LFC preseason tour completed ‚úÖ Twelve days of intense, enjoyable and rewarding work from our whole travelling team to give the best experience for supporters, local communities, partners and media ‚Äì all while our players work hard to prepare for the season ahead. It‚Äôs truly amazing to see the work of the LFC Foundation coaches working every single day in the communities to deliver soccer camps for local children. The difference they make to young people‚Äôs lives all around the world is phenomenal. Thank you to Pittsburgh, Philadelphia and Columbia SC for having us and making our experience with you so special. Thank you also to all the local and travelling Liverpool media who were there every step of the way to help share our stories. Three wins out of three and almost ready for the start of a new and exciting season. ‚öΩÔ∏è\n\nThis is how we start our preseason tour. üá∫üá∏ First day in Pittsburgh and our legends Ian Rush, John Barnes, Gary Mc and Sami Hyypia head straight to the local children‚Äôs hospital with LFC Foundation to brighten the days of the young patients. Rushie then heads to CBS News to join their breakfast show to talk about all things Liverpool Football Club and preview our game on Friday against Real Betis Balompi√©. Our amazing coaches from LFC Foundation get straight on it too and support more local children in Pittsburgh creating a brilliant soccer camp. Billy Hogan, Ben Latty and Sami Hyypia join the session with Pittsburgh Riverhounds SC at their Highmark Stadium. After the session, Billy spends time speaking to the local and UK media who have travelled over to be with us throughout the tour. And it‚Äôs only day one! Eleven more days to go‚Ä¶üëç\n\nA special evening at Royal Troon last night meeting the Boston Common Golf team ‚Äì Rory McIlroy, Keegan Bradley, Adam Scott and Hideki Matsuyama. The team is one of six that will enter the TGL (Tomorrow‚Äôs Golf League) in January 2025, with players from the PGA TOUR competing in two-hour weekly competitions. Sounds amazing! It was a privilege to be there and get my hands on the claret jug ahead of the 152nd Open Championship! üèåÔ∏è‚ôÇÔ∏è\n\nAmazing to see Jurgen continuing with his commitment and support for our LFC Foundation. He said: ‚ÄúI look forward to seeing what we can do with that now that I have more time on my hands.‚Äù What. A. Man. üôå https://lnkd.in/e3v9u6Z6\n\nThank you to Tim Seamans for inviting me to speak at the University of Liverpool's annual conference. It was great to have a discussion on communications strategies and tactics with fellow comms professionals in the city. Some brilliant and challenging questions at the end of the session too! Also great to connect with fellow speaker Antonia Dixey."
