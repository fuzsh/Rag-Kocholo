        "text": "Goals are being written down and talked about. For each team in the area the slate is clean at the start of a new season for boys' soccer. When Aug. 16 rolls though, that hard work and sweat will be put to the test as each squad looks to start that chase to check off their goals and meet their own metrics on the pitch.\n\nThe Daily Record's Josh McWilliams highlights 10 of the area's best players, along with asking them them three questions as well to help fans get to know them: Who is their favorite professional player and their favorite team? What is the best part of school? How have they improved their game from last year to this year?\n\nZeke Bodiker (Hiland, forward)\n\nFlashy in the offensive third, this senior can smash a shot past a goalie or slip it inside the upper 90. He will be counted to supply some punch, help set the pace and provide leadership to this year's team that again has lofty goals.\n\n\"My favorite professional soccer player is Yunus Musah (AC Milan midfielder) and my favorite pro team is Aston Villa.\"\n\n\"The best part of school is spending time with my friends because I can learn and also have fun with my friends all at the same time.\"\n\n\"I think I have improved my game from last year by becoming more comfortable with the ball under pressure and my shooting from distance.\"\n\nSilas Coleman (Central Christian, midfielder)\n\nSolid with the ball at his feet, Coleman's understanding of the game is at a very high level and his patience within the game is tough to match. Add it all up and this Comet senior will be instrumental in accomplishing this year's team goals.\n\n\"My favorite professional soccer player is Jude Bellingham (Real Madrid midfielder), and my favorite soccer team is Manchester City.\"\n\n\"The best part of school is the support of my teachers. The relationships that are formed are very valuable.\"\n\n\"I have continued to work on improving the basics, as well as improving my knowledge of the game.\"\n\nLogan Hershberger (Hiland, forward)\n\nA senior forward who can play both in the midfield and on the attack, Hershberger will be a key element this fall to the Hawks success. He will be counted on to step into more of a leadership spot and help set the pace.\n\n\"My favorite soccer player is (Lionel) Messi because I can relate to his style of play, but definitely not his skill though. He’s the GOAT. My favorite pro team is Crystal Palace because they can beat the top teams in their league, but also lose to the worst, so it’s enjoyable to watch.\"\n\n\"Best part of school is seeing my friends every day because they always make me smile and make me feel bubbly.\"\n\n\"I improved my game from last year to this year by playing at my most competitive and highest level, being a leader on and off the field, and anticipating the game better and I get better with more experience.\"\n\nJon Graham (Norwayne, midfielder)\n\nThere isn't a player better at controlling the pace than this Bobcat senior, who has proven to be dynamite in the midfield and offensive third. He will be needed organize the offense, help ignite the attack and play with aggression if the program is to make a prolonged run in the playoffs.\n\n\"I like Christian Pulisic (AC Milan attacking midfielder) because he is a very good player representing the United States, and he posts Bible verses, which is something I definitely support. As far as my favorite team goes, I will go with the U.S. national team because they represent our country.\"\n\n\"I think the best part of school is study hall/lunch because you get time to try to finish homework so that you do not have to do it at home, and you get to relax a little bit.\"\n\n\"I think that from last year I have improved my speed of play, and I plan to shoot a little bit more.\n\nParker Metsker (Norwayne, defender)\n\nSenior defender who has been the heartbeat of the defense the past couple of seasons and may be looked upon to provide some fuel to the offense. With his ability to see the field and distribute accordingly, he will be valuable at both ends of the pitch.\n\n\"My favorite player is Virgil van Dijk (Liverpool FC defender) and favorite team is FC Barcelona because I play with them in FIFA.\"\n\n\"Study Hall because I can mess around with my friends and not actually do the work I’m supposed to do.\"\n\n\"My passing has improved because my vision on the field has improved.\"\n\nAaron Miedel (Central Christian, midfielder)\n\nA senior midfielder for the Comets, Miedel can virtually do anything he wants and working with Coleman in the midfield forms a tough 1-2 punch in the center. Possessing the ball and being able to move it with authority is the key to winning at high levels.\n\n\"I've been a Liverpool FC fan since I was nine, so Mo Salah (Liverpool FC forward) is definitely my favorite pro. A lot of the Central players watch the Premier League on the weekends, and that makes it fun to banter with guys who root for other clubs.\"\n\n\"I really enjoy choir. Mr. Shue is an excellent director, and it's great to sing alongside most of my teammates every day.\"\n\n\"Playing winter futsal has improved my vision and speed of play. Futsal has also allowed me to build relationships with underclassmen and Central alumni.\"\n\nNicholas Morse (Wooster, forward)\n\nThe Generals stream of top-notch attackers will not end this year as this senior forward is just as good as those who have come before him. With an ability to attack from the wings and at close quarters inside the box, Morse is about as lethal as they come.\n\n\"My favorite professional soccer player is Lionel Messi (Inter Miami forward) and my favorite team is FC Barcelona.\"\n\n\"The best part of school is during the fall season, because that's when I have the most fun with my friends and going to school on game days and representing the Wooster soccer team. \"\n\n\"I have improved on my technical understanding of the game, and I have also improved in being more confident.\"\n\nCalen Relle (Wooster, midfielder)\n\nThis junior midfielder has been shining on the pitch since the day he stepped onto it about two years ago and he hasn't stopped. He causes opposing coaches' headaches with his ability to control a game and will be counted to continue that this fall.\n\n\"My favorite player is (Cristiano) Ronaldo (retired European legend), my favorite team is the U.S. Men's National Team and my favorite club is Columbus Crew.\"\n\n\"The best part about school is getting a chance to create special relationships and bonds in the classroom and on the field while learning important life lessons and developing as a person.\"\n\n\"I have improved my game in a few vital ways. I trained with a very strong club team in Spire FC and I worked on my physical side of the game in the gym. I trained my technical skills with my coach Graham Ford and over the last year, my mental side of the has improved as well.\"\n\nDiego Vasquez (Smithville, forward)\n\nThe junior forward has grown in leaps and bounds over his first two years of prep soccer and will look to continue that growth this fall. He will be counted to provide some punch offensively and set the tone in the offensive third for the Smithies.\n\n\"My favorite player is Lionel Messi (Inter Miami forward) and my favorite team is FC Barcelona.\"\n\n\"Probably all the different classes you go to because there are so many different people, and you make new friends.\"\n\n\"Mostly just working on shooting especially with my right foot, so that way I’m more unpredictable on which way I’ll go.\"\n\nKaleb Wayt (Orrville, forward)\n\nOne of the state's top placekickers on the football field will be back and counted upon to lead the Red Riders on the pitch offensively. He has the power to get it past anyone and will be looking to lead his Red Riders as they contend for another PAC title.\n\n\"My favorite player is Mohamed Salah (Liverpool FC forward) and my favorite team is Leeds United.\"\n\n\"Being able to get involved in clubs, sports and activities\"\n\n\"Worked a lot on sprinting in the open field and my shots and passes are going to have more power.\"\n\nMore to watch: Luke Blaz (Chippewa), Neal Brewer (Waynedale), Xavier Brown (Orrville), Michael Buchholz (Wooster), Caleb Carter (Orrville), Mateo Dague (Northwestern), Luke Derodes (Smithville), Dominic Ebin (Wooster), Lyle Endsley (Central Christian), Wahied Fasihi (Northwestern), Quinn Maibach (Smithville), Edwin Martinez (Waynedale), Aaron Meech (Smithville), Grant Obrst (West Holmes), Conner Preattle (Norwayne), Jake Rickett (Wooster), Cooper Ringle (Norwayne), Alex Rodriguez (Chippewa), Ohlen Troyer (Hiland), Braden West (Norwayne)"
