        "text": "Liverpool had been going toe-to-toe with Manchester City and Arsenal in a gripping Premier League title race in 2023/24.\n\nJurgen Klopp's team started March this year at the top of the table but with the reigning champions and the Gunners breathing down their necks. They have also been attempting to juggle FA Cup and UEFA Europa League commitments — having already won this season's Carabao Cup — while managing a succession of injuries.\n\nAttempting to navigate a challenging remaining schedule, much of which has come after the March international break, could be a significant obstacle in the Reds' quest to win a second league title under Klopp before he leaves the club at the end of the season. Ultimately, it proved too much.\n\nThe Sporting News has a breakdown of Liverpool's remaining schedule, plus a points prediction for the games they have coming up, based on this season's form and the result in the same game in 2022/23.\n\nMORE: Why Jurgen Klopp is leaving Liverpool in 2024\n\nLiverpool Premier League schedule: Remaining fixtures for 2024\n\nLiverpool have got one game left in the 2023/24 Premier League season and it will be played at Anfield for Klopp's final match in charge.\n\nLiverpool Premier League schedule: Remaining fixtures in 2023/24\n\nDateTime (GMT / ET)OpponentHome/AwayResultMar. 103.45 p.m. / 11:45 a.m.Man CityH1-1 DMar. 312 p.m. / 9 a.m.BrightonH2-1 WApr. 47:30 p.m. / 2:30 p.m.Sheffield UnitedH3-1 WApr. 73:30 p.m. / 10:30 a.m.Man UnitedA2-2 DApr. 142 p.m. / 9 a.m.Crystal PalaceH1-0 LApr. 214:30 p.m. / 11:30 a.m.FulhamA3-1 WApr. 248 p.m. / 3 p.m.EvertonA2-0 LApr. 2712:30 p.m. / 7:30 a.m.West HamA2-2 DMay 54:30 p.m. / 11:30 a.m.TottenhamH4-2 WMay 138 p.m. / 3 p.m.Aston VillaA3-3 DMay 194 p.m. / 11 a.m.WolvesH—\n\nMORE: The Premier League table as things stand\n\nLiverpool prediction for run-in 2023/24: How many points will they get?\n\nLiverpool have a handful of difficult-looking matches remaining in the Premier League in 2023/24, but they produced a stirring performance in their 1-1 draw against Manchester City on March 10. Here's a run-down of those fixtures, and a prediction of how many points they might expect to get.\n\nBrighton (H): March 31\n\nBrighton scored after just two minutes through former Manchester United striker Danny Welbeck, but Liverpool responded to claim a 2-1 victory thanks to goals from Luis Diaz and Mohamed Salah.\n\nResult last season: Liverpool 3-3 Brighton\n\nPrediction this season: Liverpool 3-1 Brighton\n\nFinal score: Liverpool 2-1 Brighton\n\nSheffield United (H): April 4\n\nSheffield United put up more of a spirited resistance than many expected, but Alexis Mac Allister's brilliant goal was the important breakthrough as the Reds won 3-1.\n\nResult last season: N/A\n\nPrediction this season: Liverpool 5-0 Sheffield United\n\nFinal score: Liverpool 3-1 Sheffield United\n\nMan United (A): April 7\n\nPredicting matches between two of English football's fiercest rivals is always tricky. United had a better season than Liverpool in 2022/23, yet they lost a scarcely believable match 7-0 at Anfield. This season, when they were expected to be turned over once more, they became the only team to stop Liverpool scoring at home in 22 games.\n\nAnd, would you believe it? We got this prediction spot on after an undulating contest at Old Trafford, where Liverpool led and dominated but needed Mohamed Salah's late penalty to salvage a point. Don't expect us to nail too many more.\n\nResult last season: Man United 2-1 Liverpool\n\nPrediction this season: Man United 2-2 Liverpool\n\nFinal score: Man United 2-2 Liverpool\n\nCrystal Palace (H): April 14\n\nNot many people saw this coming. Palace, who held Liverpool to a 1-1 draw at Anfield last season, went one better this time by claiming a 1-0 victory through Eberechi Eze's goal. What did we say about nailing predictions?\n\nResult last season: Liverpool 1-1 Crystal Palace\n\nPrediction this season: Liverpool 4-1 Crystal Palace\n\nFinal score: Liverpool 0-1 Crystal Palace\n\nFulham (A): April 21\n\nFulham held Liverpool to a home draw last August and they remain a tricky opponent on their day, as they showed by beating Manchester United at Old Trafford. On home turf, they could caused the Reds some problems. Thomas Castagne cancelled out Trent Alexander-Arnold's sumptuous free-kick before a first Premier League striker for Ryan Gravenberch and a Diogo Jota goal saw a much-changed Liverpool power clear.\n\nResult last season: Fulham 2-2 Liverpool\n\nPrediction this season: Fulham 1-1 Liverpool\n\nFinal score: Fulham 1-3 Liverpool\n\nEverton (A): April 24\n\nThe next Merseyside derby was postponed when Liverpool reached the quarterfinals of the FA Cup, which takes place the weekend their trip to Everton was originally scheduled. While these games are always feisty affairs, it felt hard to see anything other than a win for the Reds. But Sean Dyche's relegation battlers turned in a throwback performance as Jarrad Braithwaite and Dominic Calvert-Lewin secured a stirring 2-0 victory. Is that the title challenge over?\n\nResult last season: Everton 0-0 Liverpool\n\nPrediction this season: Everton 0-3 Liverpool\n\nFinal score: Everton 2-0 Liverpool\n\nMORE: How many trophies has Jurgen Klopp won?\n\nWest Ham (A): April 27\n\nLiverpool won this game last season but, as has become a habit this term, they went behind once more. The Reds went 2-1 up but conceded an equaliser to Michail Antonio, with a disappointing result almost overshadowed by a touchline argument between Jurgen Klopp and Mohamed Salah.\n\nResult last season: West Ham 1-2 Liverpool\n\nPrediction this season: West Ham 0-4 Liverpool\n\nFinal score: West Ham 2-2 Liverpool\n\nTottenham (H): May 5\n\nThis was potentially a tough game for Liverpool, with Spurs chasing the Champions League places, but they ended up cruising into a 4-0 lead before the visitors produced something of a late fightback.\n\nResult last season: Liverpool 4-3 Tottenham\n\nPrediction this season: Liverpool 3-3 Tottenham\n\nFinal score: Liverpool 4-2 Tottenham\n\nAston Villa (A): May 13\n\nLiverpool have been the comeback kings this season but Villa decided to give them a taste of their own medicine as the Reds threw away a two-goal lead in three minutes.\n\nResult last season: Aston Villa 1-3 Liverpool\n\nPrediction this season: Aston Villa 2-2 Liverpool\n\nFinal score: Aston Villa 3-3 Liverpool\n\nWolves (H): May 19\n\nLiverpool finish their Premier League season at home to a Wolves side who have surprised many in 2023/24 and could potentially still be in a battle for a European place come May 19.\n\nResult last season: Liverpool 2-0 Wolves\n\nPrediction this season: Liverpool 3-0 Wolves\n\nLiverpool predicted final points tally in 2023/24: 82\n\nPredicted final Premier League table 2023/24\n\nBased on recent results and our predictions for the final few weeks, Manchester City look set to win the Premier League title by two points.\n\nWill there be a final twist on the last weekend?\n\nPosTeamPointsMatches\n\nPlayedGoals\n\nScoredGoal\n\nDifference1.Man City913893+612.Arsenal893893+613.Liverpool823886+46\n\nHow to watch Liverpool in Premier League 2023/24: TV channels, live streams\n\nRegionTVStreamingAustralia—Optus SportCanada—\n\nFubo Canada\n\nIndiaStar SportsDisney+, Hotstar,\n\nJioTVUKSky Sports, TNT SportsNOW TV, Sky Go,\n\nAmazon Prime, Discovery PlusUSAUSA Network,\n\nTelemundo, UniversoFubo, Peacock\n\nUK: Matches are carried across Sky Sports and TNT Sports' streaming and TV platforms, with select matches on Amazon Prime.
