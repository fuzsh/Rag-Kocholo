        "text": "Liverpool won a record-extending 10th Carabao Cup trophy in 2024, defeating Chelsea 1-0 in the final at Wembley Stadium.\n\nIt was the eighth trophy of manager Jurgen Klopp's tenure at Anfield and the first of what could be a quadruple in 2023/24. They are right in the hunt for the Premier League title and still competing in the FA Cup and UEFA Europa League.\n\nOnce the undisputed kings of English football, Liverpool found themselves in the wake of Manchester United, Arsenal, and later Chelsea and Manchester City for much of the past 32 years. Klopp's arrival in October 2015 heralded a new era of success on Merseyside, and he will be sorely missed by Reds fans when he leaves at the end of the season.\n\nAs Liverpool hope to clear space in the trophy cabinet once again, The Sporting News looks at how they have fared in major competitions throughout their history.\n\nMORE: How many trophies has Jurgen Klopp won?\n\nPremier League (First Division)\n\nTitles: 19\n\nYears won: 1900–01, 1905–06, 1921–22, 1922–23, 1946–47, 1963–64, 1965–66, 1972–73, 1975–76, 1976–77, 1978–79, 1979–80, 1981–82, 1982–83, 1983–84, 1985–86, 1987–88, 1989–90, 2019–20\n\nLiverpool are the second-most dominant side in English football in terms of total top-flight title wins, just one behind arch-rivals Manchester United on 20.\n\nThe Reds enjoyed an incredible run of glory through the latter half of last century, with 10 titles in 15 seasons between 1975 and 1990.\n\nKlopp finally helped end the club’s 30-year wait for a league title in 2020 as the Reds followed up their 2019 UEFA Champions League success with a long-awaited domestic league win. That season marked the first league title won by Liverpool in the Premier League era.\n\nEnglish Second Division\n\nTitles: 4 (1893–94, 1895–96, 1904–05, 1961–62)\n\nDespite its 19 top-flight title wins, Liverpool also spent time in the second division in previous years, with two Second Division titles either side of the start of the 20th Century.\n\nThe 1962 crown saw the club promoted to the English top flight, where the Reds have remained ever since.\n\nFA Cup\n\nTitles: 8\n\nYears won: 1965, 1974, 1986, 1989, 1992, 2001, 2006, 2022\n\nLiverpool is the joint-third most successful club in the history of the FA Cup after capturing their eighth trophy, ending a 16-year drought. The Reds beat Chelsea 6-5 on penalties after 120 minutes resulted in a 0-0 draw in the 2021-22 final.\n\nThe eight trophies put them on par with London sides Chelsea and Tottenham, and behind Arsenal and Manchester United.\n\nThe previous FA Cup win came in the 2006 final against West Ham – later dubbed the Steven Gerrard final – after the England star scored twice, including a brilliant long-range strike in the 90th minute to level the tie at 3-3, before Rafa Benitez’s side won on penalties.\n\nLeague Cup (EFL Cup, Carabao/Carling Cup)\n\nTitles: 10\n\nYears won: 1980–81, 1981–82, 1982–83, 1983–84, 1994–95, 2000–01, 2002–03, 2011–12, 2021-22, 2023-24\n\nLiverpool became the first team to reach double figures for League Cup trophies when they beat Chelsea 1-0 in the final in February 2024.\n\nTwo years earlier, their penalty shootout victory over Chelsea gave the Reds a ninth title, overtaking Manchester City as the competition's outright most successful club (see highlights below).\n\nA penalty shootout win also earned Liverpool the trophy in 2012, following a 2-2 draw with Cardiff City. Klopp did reach the 2016 final in his first season at Anfield but Liverpool lost on spot-kicks against Pep Guardiola's Man City.\n\nFA Community Shield (Charity Shield)\n\nTitles: 16\n\nYears won: 1964*, 1965*, 1966, 1974, 1976, 1977*, 1979, 1980, 1982, 1986*, 1988, 1989, 1990*, 2001, 2006, 2022 (* = shared)\n\nLiverpool have clinched the annual curtain raiser 16 times in its history, the third most successful club in the competition after United and Arsenal. Of course, reaching this competition requires earning a place, so that many Shields represents a seriously impressive achievement.\n\nKlopp lost out in his first appearance in the competition in 2020 as Arsenal sealed a penalty shootout win after a 1-1 draw at Wembley. Two years later, the Reds beat Manchester City 3-1.\n\nChampions League (European Cup)\n\nTitles: 6 (1977, 1978, 1981, 1984, 2005, 2019)\n\nLiverpool boast the proud record of being the most dominant English club in Europe’s top continental club competition with six titles, only bettered across Europe by AC Milan with seven and Real Madrid with 13.\n\nThe club's 2019 win in Madrid over Tottenham was Klopp’s first major title as Liverpool boss.\n\nEuropa League (UEFA Cup)\n\nTitles: 3 (1973, 1976, 2001)\n\nThe Reds have three triumphs in Europe’s secondary competition with their most recent win coming in 2001 after edging out Spain's Alaves in a 5-4 thriller.\n\nUEFA Super Cup\n\nTitles: 4 (1977, 2001, 2005, 2019)\n\nLiverpool have followed up European success with a subsequent Super Cup win on four separate occasions, with a 2019 final win over Chelsea on penalties the most recent, coming after a 2-2 draw in Istanbul.\n\nFIFA Club World Cup\n\nTitles: 1 (2019)\n\nLiverpool’s sole FIFA Club World Cup triumph came in 2019 as Roberto Firmino’s extra-time goal secured a 1-0 win over Brazilian side Flamengo in Doha."
