        "text": "The most successful English team in European soccer (association football) tournament history is Liverpool FC. Based in the city of Liverpool, the team has won six European Cup/Champions League trophies. It has also won the English top-division league title 19 times.\n\nEverton FC was the first football team to play in the Anfield stadium that is famous today as Liverpool FC’s historic home. A dispute between Everton and the site’s owner, John Houlding, resulted in Everton moving to Goodison Park and Houlding forming a new team that was eventually named Liverpool FC. The new club played its first game in 1892 and won its first league title in the 1900–01 season. In 1906 Anfield’s newly constructed terrace grandstand was labeled Spion Kop for its resemblance to a hill where a famous battle of the Boer War (1899–1902) had been fought. This led to the well-known nickname Kopites for Liverpool’s fans.\n\nTwo managers, Bill Shankly (1959–74) and Bob Paisley (1974–83), were responsible for much of Liverpool’s success. Shankly took Liverpool from the English second division to win three English top-division league titles (1963–64, 1965–66, and 1972–73), as well as a Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) Cup victory in 1973. Paisley added a second UEFA Cup in 1976, six English league titles, and three European Cup wins (1977, 1978, and 1981). A fourth European Cup victory came in 1984, and Liverpool reached the final the following year against Juventus at the Heysel Stadium in Belgium. The match was marred by tragedy as 39 fans were killed, primarily by the collapse of a stadium wall that was caused by Liverpool fans charging Juventus supporters. Liverpool was banned from European competition for six years—and all English clubs were banned for five years—after the incident. Another tragedy struck the club in 1989 when, during a Football Association (FA) Cup semifinal match at the Hillsborough stadium in Sheffield, 96 Liverpool fans were crushed to death by overcrowding in England’s deadliest sporting disaster."
