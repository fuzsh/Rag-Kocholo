        "text": "Thanks to Rob Stokes and Andrew Hoare for their assistance\n\nSee here for Simon Treanor’s major series on Liverpool’s numbering from 1985-93\n\nThe 2023-24 season will see Liverpool have at least three new occupants of their 1-11 shirts.\n\nWith James Milner, Naby Keita and Roberto Firmino departing, numbers 7-9 inclusive were up for grabs while 10 has lain empty since Sadio Mané joined Bayern Munich at the beginning of last season. Luis Díaz has traded down from 23 to 7 while new signings Dominik Szoboszlai and Alexis Mac Allister have taken 8 and 10 respectively (though some might feel they’d be better the other way around.\n\nThere seems to be an expectation that Darwin Núñez will move from number 27 to 9 to make it four different 1-11 occupants for the new season.\n\nTwenty-nine years ago, the Reds initially planned to do something similar but, for whatever reason, it didn’t happen.\n\nOn the eve of the 1994-95 season, Match magazine produced a booklet listing the squad numbers for each club – they had done the same for 1993-94, the inaugural campaign with fixed numbers, and obviously the second time around provided interest in terms of any changes made.\n\nFor instance, looking at Manchester City in the image on the left, Paul Walsh and Peter Beagrie were signed during 1993-94 and given numbers in the 30s but they were rewarded with numbers 8 and 11 respectively.\n\nLeicester City were a blank canvas as they had been using 1-11 in Division 1 of the Football League the previous year (squad numbers were optional for the 70 clubs below the top flight and not taken up to any great degree) while champions Manchester United had an unchanged 1-11.\n\nHowever, goalkeeper Gary Walsh took the 13 vacated by Les Sealey and young players like Graham Tomlinson and Simon Davies were also allocated teen numbers as the likes of Clayton Blackmore and Darren Ferguson had left. A lot of the blank numbers would go on to be filled by the Class of 92.\n\nAnd then there’s Liverpool.\n\nOf the 23 players listed, 11 had different numbers to what they wore in 1993-94. This was the 1-11 in the first season of the new system:\n\nOf course, there is no rule saying that the players given those numbers all have to be first choice but, with the change from the old system, most clubs did have a 1-11 that was fairly reflective of the manager’s thinking.\n\nFor Liverpool, the main outlier was the number 25 given to Neil Ruddock, newly signed from Tottenham Hotspur – apparently a nod to his fee of £2.5m – while David Burrows departed early in the season but in a swap deal that included West Ham United left-back Julian Dicks, who slotted into the number 3 jersey.\n\nOn the opening day of the season, Liverpool hosted Sheffield Wednesday and the new owner of the fabled number 7 shirt, Nigel Clough, scored twice in a 2-0 win. He was one of seven in the 1-11 bracket to start that game.\n\nNumber 15 Jamie Redknapp and number 17 Steve McManaman were the two outfield substitutes that day and, given that they had played quite a bit in 1992-93, they could perhaps be considered unlucky not to be given 1-11 numbers.\n\nBoth would feature prominently again in 1993-94 while it was also the season that saw the emergence of young striker Robbie Fowler, who was assigned number 23.\n\nThat trio and Ruddock were the most notable movers in the revised list for 1994-95 that appeared in Match – Ruddock taking 6 from Don Hutchison, Redknapp 8 instead of Paul Stewart, McManaman 11 rather than Mark Walters and Fowler in the 12 freed up by the departure of Ronnie Whelan (who was of course unhappy that he hadn’t been given 5 in the first place).\n\nAnd yet, come the opening day of the FA Carling Premiership season, a 6-1 win for Liverpool away to Crystal Palace, the changes hadn’t materialised – the only difference from 1993-94 was that David James now had the number 1 shirt with Bruce Grobbelaar’s time at Anfield having come to an end, with the new back-up goalkeeper, the Dane Michael Stensgaard, allocated 13.\n\nFriend of the site Andrew Hoare has a theory around the whole episode:\n\nCertainly very sound logic from Andrew – another factor might have been that the kits for 1994-95 were the same as in 1993-94 and they didn’t want to inconvenience fans with the previous numbers on their shirts.\n\nSome supporters did buy shirts and got them numbered according to the new list – according to a Liverpool Echo article of September 3, 1994, anyone inconvenienced in such a way would receive a replacement.\n\nAs Andrew mentions, Don Hutchison joined West Ham United in August, meaning that number 6 was free for Phil Babb to take when he joined in September. John Scales arrived at the same time as his fellow centre-back and it was he rather than Fowler who ended up wearing Whelan’s old 12.\n\nDicks returned to West Ham in October (Burrows had moved on to Everton by that point) while Steve Nicol’s long spell at Liverpool would come to an end in January 1995 as he joined Notts County. Jason McAteer was the next player to wear 4 while 3 would remain empty all through 1995-96 – it was assigned to Scales for 1996-97 but he only played seven games wearing it before joining Tottenham Hotspur.\n\nLater in the season, there was one further numbers oddity, albeit a cosmetic one. For the Coca-Cola Cup final in April – a 2-1 win over Bolton Wanderers with McManaman scoring both goals – the players had squad numbers but their shirts were devoid of names.\n\nThe big numbers reshuffle would finally happen in 1996 – something we shall look at at a later date."
