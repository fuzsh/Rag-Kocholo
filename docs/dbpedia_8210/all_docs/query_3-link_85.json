        "text": "Jürgen Klopp’s team are chasing a quadruple and may yet surpass the efforts of the Liverpool side of the 1983-84 season, but they are unlikely to have as much fun along the way. It was a season of 67 matches, shocks, thrashings, broken bones, beer, brawls, spaghetti legs, Scully and Chris Rea.\n\nUnusually for Liverpool at the time, it was also a season with a few doubts along the way, starting with the retirement of Bob Paisley in the summer of 1983. Joe Fagan, a member of the famous Boot Room who had been at the club since 1958, was hesitant about stepping up to replace Paisley but decided he was the right man for the job. “It would have been impossible for anyone else to follow Bob,” said Fagan. “I’m not being big headed. It’s just that I know the drill.” Arrogance was not an accusation you could throw at Fagan. The title of his biography – The Reluctant Champion – says it all.\n\nFagan had the players on his side but, even though the club had won the league and League Cup the season before, there were challenges ahead. The squad was short of defenders, needed cover for the Kenny Dalglish-Ian Rush partnership and, with Ronnie Whelan ruled out until November, looked slight in midfield. Gary Gillespie arrived from Coventry as a backup for the formidable centre-back pairing of Alan Hansen and Mark Lawrenson, with forward Michael Robinson joining from Brighton. Yet, at the start of the season, many pundits suggested Manchester United might finally knock Liverpool off their perch, even more so when Bryan Robson scored twice to give them a 2-0 win in the Charity Shield.\n\nA 1-1 draw at newly promoted Wolves was a less than encouraging start to the league campaign, but four wins in the next five helped. Fagan was not entirely comfortable with the performances though and his concerns were justified when the team lost back-to-back league matches to Manchester United and Sunderland.\n\nThere was little time to dwell on these setbacks. The defence of the League Cup started against third tier Brentford, the 8-1 aggregate win giving little indication of the slog that awaited for the holders. Three matches were required against second tier Fulham, who were finally seen off after 330 minutes. Another replay was needed to get past Birmingham before Christmas, setting up a quarter-final with Sheffield Wednesday.\n\nThe fixtures kept coming. After thrashing Danish champions Odense 6-0 on aggregate in the first round of the European Cup, Liverpool’s chances of progressing to the last eight looked shaky after a goalless draw at home to Athletic Bilbao in the first leg. But with skipper Graeme Souness once again demonstrating his worth, Liverpool silenced the boisterous crowd in Spain and sneaked a 1-0 win thanks to a header from Ian Rush.\n\nAfter their consecutive league losses, Liverpool cranked through the gears. Robinson struggled to settle initially, but his hat-trick at West Ham and a Steve Nicol winner on QPR’s plastic pitch secured vital wins over teams who would threaten to enter the title race. Rush then scored five against Luton, his 47 goals in all competitions understandably earning him both the players’ and football writers’ player of the year awards. The striker scored his customary derby goal in a 3-0 win over Everton in November. It was a dream day for the actor Andrew Schofield, who ran out with the Liverpool team before the match and scored a goal at the Kop end, all for a Channel 4 series called Scully.\n\nLiverpool put together an eight-match unbeaten run in autumn but it came to an end in dramatic circumstances. The champions resembled a pub team as they lost 4-0 to Coventry at Highfield Road. Fagan was furious at half-time, tearing into left-back Alan Kennedy, who unwisely answered back. Teacups and punches were thrown, as Souness and Dalglish tested their close friendship with some very frank exchanges.\n\nLiverpool responded well, winning three of their next four in the league before the visit of Manchester United on 2 January. It was a bruising day for the hosts. United snatched a late draw and Dalglish was ruled out for eight weeks after having his cheekbone fractured in a clash with Kevin Moran. Losing at home to a poor Wolves team was not the ideal response and, when Liverpool fell behind at Villa Park in their next game, they looked shaky. But a stunning Rush hat-trick steadied the ship and they would remain unbeaten in the league until Dalglish returned.\n\nAny hopes of an unprecedented quadruple disappeared on the south coast. With Souness injured, Liverpool were vulnerable to a shock in the fourth round of the FA Cup at Brighton. The Second Division side scored twice in a minute and, for the second year in a row, ended Liverpool’s run in the cup.\n\nAt least they progressed in the League Cup. Again they needed a replay to see off Sheffield Wednesday, and after drawing at Anfield in the first leg, a 2-0 win at third tier Walsall – the second goal resulting in scary scenes when a wall collapsed – set up a final against a rejuvenated Everton. The league campaign was back on track too; after the Wolves loss, the team went on another eight-match unbeaten run.\n\nLiverpool had an extremely busy run-in, playing 18 matches in the last three months of the season. Fagan won his first silverware as boss in March as Liverpool claimed their fourth consecutive League Cup. The final at Wembley was a disappointing affair, with many Evertonians adamant that Hansen had handled Adrian Heath’s goal-bound effort. Three days later, a long-range effort from Souness won the replay at Maine Road; for now the noisy neighbours were kept in their place.\n\nThe final came just four days after Liverpool had progressed to the last four of the European Cup, a stunning 4-1 win at Benfica setting up a feisty encounter with Dinamo Bucharest. Sammy Lee gave Liverpool a 1-0 win at Anfield, but that was only a small part of the story. In the 70th minute, Souness floored midfielder Lica Movila in an off-the-ball incident, breaking the jaw of the Romanian.\n\nUnderstandably, the Bucharest players were out for revenge in the second leg. The atmosphere was hostile, yet this was a situation that Souness simply lived for. Soaking up all that was thrown at him, Souness inspired his team to a 2-1 away win, with Rush scoring twice. A final against Roma in the Italians’ stadium awaited.\n\nAfter losing 2-0 at Southampton in another live Friday night match, a crucial win at Watford – with new signing John Wark scoring on his debut – and a 6-0 hammering of West Ham edged Liverpool two points clear of United with eight matches remaining. The two giants came out of their corners, hoping to land the knockout blow. But like two exhausted heavyweights at the start of the 15th round, both huffed and puffed. Luckily for Liverpool, every time they dropped points, United seemingly tried their best to match them.\n\nThe pivotal moment in the title race arrived in early May. Liverpool had their revenge over Coventry, Rush scoring four goals in a 5-0 win, as United lost at home to Ipswich, allowing Fagan’s team to wrap up the title with a goalless draw at Notts County. Liverpool only won two of their last eight games, hardly the stuff of champions, but they were persistent and resolute throughout, only losing six of their 42 league games. “By our own standards we didn’t deserve to win the title again,” Souness said. “But by everybody else’s standards, we did.” It was their third league title in a row, matching the achievement of Huddersfield in the 1920s and Arsenal in the 1930s.\n\nNow the team could concentrate on the European Cup final in Rome. They flew to Israel for a friendly against the national team, but in essence this was a lads’ week away. Fuelled by alcohol after a drinking game one evening, the players – minus Souness and Dalglish – became involved in a scrap in a bar. When club director Sydney Moss was informed that there had been violent scenes in the square, he assumed supporters had been involved. Arriving to see Kennedy with a black eye and Rush with a bloodied nose, Moss must have been as stunned as the Italian journalists covering the trip. But rather than disrupting team spirit, the trip bonded the players.\n\nOn the Israel break, the Liverpool forward and resident DJ Dave Hodgson played the Chris Rea song I Don’t Know What It Is But I Love It on the team bus. Quickly established as a team anthem, the song would play a role in landing a psychological blow in Rome. After Souness had purposely led his players in front of the Roma fans before the match, the team wandered back down the tunnel. Hodgson started singing Rea’s song, and gradually everyone joined in, apparently disrupting a team talk Roma coach Nils Liedholm was giving. When Roma’s players left Souness and his men waiting in the tunnel before the match, the tune started once more. As the confused Roma players emerged, the volume grew louder.\n\nNone of this would have mattered had Roma won on their own patch. But it is all part of the story of Liverpool’s marvellous night. Phil Neal opened the scoring in the 13th minute, only for Roberto Pruzzo to equalise before the break. The final drifted inevitably towards a shootout and, when Nicol missed Liverpool’s first penalty, it looked like the treble was slipping away. But Bruno Conti missed and, with Liverpool leading 3-2, Francesco Graziani walked towards the spot. Goalkeeper Bruce Grobbelaar was about to take centre stage.\n\nThere was rarely a dull moment with Grobbelaar, who walked on his hands before matches, dropped crosses and often came flying out of his area. Under strict instructions from Fagan to put off the penalty takers, Grobbelaar started wobbling his legs as Graziani prepared. When the penalty soared into the night sky, Grobbelaar ran off in delight. His spaghetti legs routine seemed to have made an impact.\n\nKennedy slotted home the winning penalty for Liverpool and the celebrations began. Souness lifted the European Cup – his last action as a Liverpool player before he joined Sampdoria. Fagan spoke to the press the following day, sitting by a swimming pool with the European Cup by his side. Things would never be better, but he was as modest as ever. “These trophies are not mine,” he said. “They belong to our fabulous team and supporters.” Maybe so, but the history books will forever show that Fagan was the first manager to lead an English club to three major trophies in the same season. Not bad for someone who was not convinced he was the right man for the job."
