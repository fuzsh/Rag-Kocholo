        "text": "Jurgen Klopp's transformation of Liverpool has been nothing short of spectacular.\n\nThe manager guided the Reds to a sixth Champions League when they beat Tottenham in 2019 and last season they won their first Premier League title in 30 years.\n\nExactly five years on from his first game in charge he will take his team into a highly-anticipated Merseyside derby with Everton - live on talkSPORT.\n\nThey may have had a humbling 7-2 defeat to Aston Villa last time out but it's just a blip for Klopp who has overseen a stunning revolution at Anfield.\n\nLast season Liverpool marched to the title with 99 points - 18 ahead of reigning champions Manchester City and 33 ahead of third place Manchester United.\n\nThis shows just how far they've come under Klopp. They were at their lowest ebb when Brendan Rodgers was sacked in October 2015. It came 18 months after their spectacular Premier League title collapse and the club had an alarming lack of direction.\n\nLuis Suarez, Raheem Sterling and Steven Gerrard had all left, while most of Rodgers' signings had also failed to gel.\n\nA draw at Everton proved to be the final straw and the Northern Irishman was sacked, with Klopp coming in to replace him.\n\nKlopp's first game in charge of Liverpool was a Premier League match on October 17, 2015 at Spurs' old White Hart Lane, which finished 0-0.\n\nThis was a decent result for the Reds, especially with Spurs emerging as title contenders as the 2015/16 season went on.\n\nSuffice to say, Liverpool are in a much better position as they look to retain their title.\n\nAnd talkSPORT.com has dug into the archives to show you what Klopp's first XI as Liverpool boss was - scroll down and prepare yourself for what you're about to see.\n\nOn the bench that day were Adam Bogdan, Kolo Toure, Jerome Sinclair, Joao Carlos Texiera and Connor Randall - no words.\n\nThey now boast a strikeforce as good as any in world football - with Sadio Mane, Roberto Firmino and Mo Salah combining to devastating effect.\n\nThey also have arguably the world's best central defender in Virgil van Dijk and two outstanding full-backs in Andrew Robertson and Trent Alexander-Arnold, while goalkeeper Alisson is the safest pair of hands in the Premier League.\n\nJordan Henderson, meanwhile, has developed into a terrific leader and better footballer in recent seasons, while Fabinho oozes class.\n\nIt's certainly been some transformation under Klopp..."
