        "text": "Heroes are important right now. It doesn't matter from what point in your life they come — or if they're real-life or fictional characters — they are the ones who remind us that nothing is impossible, or that life in many forms is built on us coming to rely on inspiration in some form. As we know when it comes to heroes, sport is never too far away.\n\nMy hero was always going to be a footballer of Liverpool Football Club. That's how the dynamics of my upbringing worked. And for this particular millennial there was only ever one player who I adored and who justified the almighty nickname bestowed on him on Merseyside. To me, Robbie Fowler was \"God\" in every way possible.\n\nFowler was a diminutive figure on a football pitch, but the manner in which he scored goals for Liverpool was gigantic. He had the skill, panache and self-belief which meant he could often sit the best goalkeepers in the game on their backsides in a manner which only ever meant you would love him more.\n\nWhen reciting just what Fowler’s left foot could do, relive his goal against Aston Villa at Anfield in the 1995/96 season to see exactly what he was about. The skill of a Brazilian coupled with an ability to arrow the ball better than any striker you had clapped eyes on. Liverpool were used to players coming through the ranks of scouse heritage, but a centre-forward up their with the most natural of talents to breakthrough was special.\n\nYet it was the fact that the Toxteth-terror was not without fault which served him best and adhered him so warmly to the Kop. His fight for Liverpool’s Dockers campaign, along with continued allegations and at times harassment into his private life often spilled over into acts on the pitch which were reprimanded.\n\nBut that’s what made him humble, what made him human to his people. As his career became injury-hit and personalities clashed with Phil Thompson and Gérard Houllier, Fowler left Liverpool but would return for a last tango under Rafael Benítez in 2006. Today, he is managing in Australia’s A League, forging a career as a boss and making big noises in the game.\n\nTo me he will always represent an aspiration. A Liverpool lad who pulled on the jersey, and who did so with the knowledge he was as good as the best, and he was. For that reason he will always be a hero, for that reason he will always be “God” to the red half of Liverpool. Happy birthday, Robbie Fowler."
