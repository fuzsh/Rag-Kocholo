        "text": "The annual question is being asked - can anybody stop Manchester City?\n\nFor the ninth season in a row Pep Guardiola's side have been installed as pre-season bookmakers' favourites to win the Premier League title.\n\nThey have won six of the past seven titles, including an unprecedented four in a row.\n\nBBC Sport takes a look at City's seven likeliest title rivals, sorted by last season's finishing positions.\n\nLast season's finish: Second (two points below City)\n\nArsenal have finished runners-up to City in the past two seasons and are only slightly longer odds than the champions this year - miles clear of any other team.\n\nThe Gunners have made just one major personnel change this summer, bringing in Italy defender Riccardo Calafiori from Bologna for a fee of up to Â£42m. He can play at left-back or centre-back.\n\nThey have also turned a loan deal into a permanent stay for Spain goalkeeper David Raya, who usurped Aaron Ramsdale as number one last season.\n\nArsenal's goals have been shared out - with winger Bukayo Saka their top scorer over the past two seasons. Could a proper striker be the difference between winning the title and not? They have been linked to Napoli frontman Victor Osimhen.\n\nBBC Sport senior football news reporter Alex Howell says: \"Arsenal have finished second for the last two seasons but the last campaign felt like a big change for all at the club.\n\n\"The Gunners finished just two points behind champions Manchester City and pushed them until the final day of the season.\n\n\"Captain Martin Odegaard said at the end of last season that they've changed the club and it does feel as though that Arsenal are going to be title contenders for a long time.\"\n\nLast season's finish: Third (nine points below City)\n\nLiverpool start a season without Jurgen Klopp as their manager for the first time since 2015-16.\n\nKlopp announced his end-of-season departure in the middle of the last campaign - and he was replaced by Arne Slot in May.\n\nThe Dutchman appears to be changing the Reds' playing style from a high-energy pressing game to more of a possession-based set-up.\n\nThe Reds, who are the only team other than City to win a Premier League title in the past seven years, have yet to sign anybody this season - but Slot hopes that will change.\n\nBBC Sport senior football news reporter Nizaar Kinsella, said: \"Liverpool will expect to challenge even in Slot's first season in charge after a glorious era under Jurgen Klopp left the club in a good place.\n\n\"They wonât be favourites, however, and there will also be a reasonable understanding if they fall short in what is his first season as he beds in his new approach.\"\n\nLast season's finish: Fourth (23 points below City)\n\nAston Villa qualified for the Champions League by achieving a hugely impressive fourth-place finish last season.\n\nUnai Emery has turned the club from relegation candidates to a team who were being talked about as title contenders for a while last season - and he has not even been in charge for two years yet.\n\nThe club have needed to sell players this summer to meet the Premier League's profit and sustainability rules.\n\nBut they have brought in plenty of new faces - including Everton midfielder Amadou Onana, Chelsea left-back Ian Maatsen, Luton midfielder Ross Barkley - and the return of academy products Jaden Philogene and Cameron Archer.\n\nBBC Sport senior football news reporter Nick Mashiter says: \"Since being appointed when they were three points above the relegation zone in October 2022, Unai Emery has overseen a drastic transformation, along with Monchi - Villa's president of football operations - and others.\n\n\"They were in the title conversation last season and were third at the end of the year, just a point off then leaders Arsenal, but two defeats by Manchester United and a home loss to Newcastle effectively ended any hopes by mid-February.\n\n\"Villa have undergone a mini-refresh with Douglas Luiz and Moussa Diaby the biggest departures - as Samuel Iling-Junior and Enzo Barrenechea join from Juventus - but still feel light on title-winning experience, despite the huge strides made.\"\n\nLast season's finish: Fifth (25 points below City)\n\nTottenham started brightly last season under Ange Postecoglou and were five points clear at the top after 10 games - but then tailed off and finished outside the Champions League places.\n\nTeenagers Archie Gray (Â£30m from Leeds), Lucas Bergvall (Â£8.5m from Djurgarden) and George Feeney (undisclosed from Glentoran - signed for the under-18 team) are their only summer arrivals to date. South Korean teenage winger Yang Min-hyuk will join the squad in January.\n\nMikey Moore, a 16-year-old academy striker, has impressed in pre-season friendlies.\n\nBBC Sport's Nizaar Kinsella said: \"Manager Postecoglou will be the force driving Tottenham to believe they can finally take that next step and win silverware for the first time since 2008.\n\n\"As ever, he won't want to limit Spurs' ambitions but qualification for the Champions League seems a more realistic target.\"\n\nLast season's finish: Seventh (31 points below City)\n\nNewcastle set the bar so high in 2022-23 with their surprise Champions League qualification that last season's seventh-place finish felt like an anti-climax.\n\nManchester United's win in the FA Cup final meant the Magpies, who finished the season strongly, missed out on Europe entirely.\n\nNow Newcastle will hope they can keep hold of manager Eddie Howe, who is considered one of the favourites to become England boss.\n\nBBC Sport's chief football news reporter Simon Stone said: \"I am getting a sense of frustration around Newcastle that they are being handicapped by financial rules, meaning they are having to sell players when they really want to buy.\n\n\"The good news is Alexander Isak, Bruno Guimaraes and Anthony Gordon are all still at the club. The bad news is there is another month before the transfer window closes. The uncertainty cannot be helping Eddie Howe in his planning.\"\n\nLast season's finish: Eighth (31 points below City)\n\nManchester United had their worst league finish since 1989-90 last season as they finished eighth - although they did end on a high by winning the FA Cup.\n\nManager Erik ten Hag had widely been expected to lose his job in Sir Jim Ratcliffe's overhaul of the club, but United decided to stick with the Dutchman who has won trophies in both his seasons at the club.\n\nManchester United have splashed cash for two youngsters this summer - Â£36.5m Bologna striker Joshua Zirkzee and Â£52m Lille centre-back Leny Yoro. Already, though, Yoro is injured and facing months out of action.\n\nSeveral players have left on free transfers including ex-France internationals Raphael Varane and Anthony Martial.\n\nBBC Sport's Simon Stone said: \"The sight of Â£52m new boy Leny Yoro in a protective boot sends a shudder down the spine of United's fans.\n\n\"Injuries began in the last pre-season and didn't stop. Erik ten Hag must avoid a repeat because he simply cannot afford to finish eighth again.\n\n\"That is likely to bring a renewed focus around further central defensive strengthening over the next couple of weeks.\""
