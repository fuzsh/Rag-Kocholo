        "text": "Egypt have the chance to win their first ever medal in the men’s Olympic soccer tournament today, as Rogério Micale’s men take on Morocco for the bronze at Paris 2024. As has been the case throughout the competition, however, the Egyptians won’t be able to call on their nation’s best player, Liverpool’s Mohamed Salah.\n\nYou’ll be able to stream Egypt vs Morocco live on the online platform fuboTV, which offers new users a free introductory trial.\n\nWhy isn’t Salah in Paris with Egypt?\n\nFans of the Reds are likely very pleased to see Salah participating in the club’s pre-season training, with the forward said to be in “phenomenal” shape. On the other hand, Egyptians will almost certainly be looking at the situation with bitter envy. Indeed, reports indicate that the country had every intention of taking the 32-year-old goal scorer as one of three over-age players to the Olympics in Paris. Incidentally, Japan had the same idea for Salah’s club teammate Wataru Endo but that didn’t materialize either, leaving the question ‘why?’\n\nThe answer, though disappointing for both nations, is simple. The football tournament in the Olympic Games is not a FIFA-sanctioned competition, meaning clubs are under no obligation to release their players for international games. According to reports, talks did occur with both players but ultimately the decision was taken to have them report for pre-season training. Incidentally, Salah was also set to be the flag-bearer of Egypt during the opening ceremony of the Summer Games, a move that would have cemented his legacy even further.\n\nIt’s also worth noting that this is not the first time that the talismanic Egyptian has been denied participation in the Olympics. Back in 2021, Egypt attempted to include him in its team for Tokyo but just as they did with this year’s edition of the global event, Liverpool shot down the plan. To that end, the Pharaohs will take on the Moroccans without their best player, while he himself will continue to prepare with his club for the coming 2024-25 English Premier League season, which begins with a game against Ipswich Town.\n\nEgypt vs Morocco: start time, how to watch"
