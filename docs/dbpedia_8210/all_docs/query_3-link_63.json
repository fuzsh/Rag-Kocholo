        "text": "Liverpool FC Women defender Lucy Parry has committed her long-term future to the club after agreeing to fresh terms this week.\n\nThe 20-year-old was a breakout star in Matt Beard's senior squad last season with 16 appearances in all competitions and helped the Reds to a fourth-place finish in the Women's Super League and the quarter-finals of the FA Cup.\n\nHaving been with the Reds since the age of seven, the lifelong Liverpool supporter is \"delighted\" to be able to pen a new deal with the club. Speaking to Liverpoolfc.com shortly after signing her new contract, Parry said: \"I'm delighted. I'm just really excited to keep pushing. This is where I want to be and I'm happy, so I think this is the best place for me to do it.\n\nREAD MORE: Liverpool has clear Champions League aim as 10-game spell offers exciting future glimpse\n\nREAD MORE: Liverpool has new benchmark for next season after Chelsea and Manchester United triumphs\n\n\"I've been here since I was seven, a shy little girl just wanting to express myself through football. I've been a Liverpool fan my whole life, growing up and watching my idols play. I had a season ticket, I remember watching the women's team play at Widnes and my family are all Reds.\n\n\"We are all excited and Reds through and through.\"\n\nIt's also been confirmed that Parry will adopt a new squad number for the 2024-25 campaign, switching from No.32 to No.2 following the summer departure of Finnish defender Emma Koivisto to AC Milan.\n\nThe Reds have also welcomed a fresh face to the setup, having confirmed the signing of Canada international Olivia Smith from Sporting CP, subject to international clearance, last month. The 19-year-old, who can play in midfield and attack, was named Best Young Player of the Campeonato Nacional Feminino last season.\n\nThe teenager produced an impressive return of 13 goals and nine assists in 18 league appearances to help her side secure Women's Champions League qualification by finishing runners-up to Benfica. On the international stage, Smith has 10 senior caps for Canada since becoming her country's youngest-ever player at 15 years and 94 days in November 2019."
