        "text": "Since the Premier League‘s inception in 1992, only 14 Liverpool players have started every league game in a single campaign – which is quite the feat!\n\nIn the 32 years since the First Division transitioned over to the Premier League, we have seen a 42-game campaign dwindle down to 38.\n\nAnd only a select few throughout this time period have managed to start every single game in a single season.\n\nThese everpresents are hard to come by, and Liverpool have had 14 since the Premier League was formed in 1992 – and this accounts only for starts, not appearances in every game.\n\nSo without further ado, here are the 14 Reds who have managed the feat – some even more than once!\n\nRobbie Fowler\n\nSeason: 1994/95\n\nMinutes: 3,731\n\nFowler scored 25 goals and notched eight assists in what was a 42-game season. Mightily impressive.\n\nDavid James\n\nSeason: 1994/95, 1995/96, 1996/97\n\nMinutes: 3,780, 3,420, 3,420\n\nThree successive seasons playing every minute of every Premier League game, the first of which was a 42-game campaign before the change to 38 came into effect from 1995/96.\n\nSteve McManaman\n\nSeason: 1995/96\n\nMinutes: 3,409\n\nSteve McManaman was subbed off just once in 1995/96, and his durability ensured he was able to contribute six goals and 15 assists.\n\nStig Inge Bjornebye\n\nSeason: 1996/97\n\nMinutes: 3,331\n\nStig Inge Bjornebye was another familiar face in 1996/97, it was the defender’s most prolific campaign in a Reds shirt when it came to total appearances.\n\nSami Hyypia\n\nSeason: 1999/00, 2003/04\n\nMinutes: 3,375, 3,420\n\nReliable in more ways than one, Sami Hyypia twice managed to start every single league game – notably, he did it in his first season with the club.\n\nSander Westerveld\n\nSeason: 2000/01\n\nMinutes: 3,420\n\nHe is second of five goalkeepers on this list and one of the few to play every single minute in each of his starts.\n\nMarkus Babbel\n\nSeason: 2000/01\n\nMinutes: 3,354\n\nIt was an impressive first season for Markus Babbel, with his 38 Premier League starts combined with his cup pursuits taking his total season outings to 60!\n\nJamie Carragher\n\nSeason: 2004/05, 2008/09\n\nMinutes: 3,420, 3,401\n\nIn 2004/05, Jamie Carragher played every minute of the campaign and came extremely close to replicating the feat in 2008/09, only to have been subbed off once with 19 minutes left in a game.\n\nPepe Reina\n\nSeason: 2007/08, 2008/09, 2009/10, 2010/11\n\nMinutes: 3,420 x 4\n\nPepe Reina was an everpresent not once, not twice, but four times! His run went from 2007 to 2011, talk about impressive!\n\nMartin Skrtel\n\nSeason: 2010/11\n\nMinutes: 3,420\n\nThankfully missing the threshold for a yellow card suspension, Martin Skrtel was able to make 38 successive starts at centre-back, scoring twice and assisting once.\n\nSimon Mignolet\n\nSeason: 2013/14\n\nMinutes: 3,420\n\nWasted no time slotting into the XI in his first season at the club, notably saving a penalty on debut in a campaign that saw the Reds come heartbreakingly close to the league title.\n\nVirgil van Dijk\n\nSeason: 2018/19, 2019/20\n\nMinutes: 3,385, 3,420\n\nHas been a consistent and colossus presence since his arrival, but in 2019/20, he played every minute of the campaign as Liverpool went on to lift the Premier League title.\n\nAlisson\n\nSeason: 2018/19\n\nMinutes: 3,420\n\nThere’s a theme with debut seasons returning maximum output, and it is no different for the final goalkeeper on the list. And what a first campaign it was, he conceded only 22 times and kept 21 clean sheets!\n\nAndy Robertson\n\nSeason: 2020/21\n\nMinutes: 3,386"
