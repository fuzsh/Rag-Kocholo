If it’s possible for a fifteen-year-old to be a fascist, Timbs was a fascist. Probably there’s a connection between that and what he ultimately did. I don’t know. Neither of us had many friends at the time. We didn’t play sports or do any extracurricular stuff. So for the next couple years we mostly hung out with each other. I remember the first night I went over to his house. His parents and his dad’s brother sat in the dining room drinking beer and talking loudly. It was impossible not to overhear their conversation, peppered with words like “nigger” and “spic” and “fag.” That was kind of a jolt. Timbs hardly ever talked about politics back then, but when he did it was from a hardright perspective, which I guess he got from his\n\nparents. They were always on about Democratic politicians and the liberal media and so on. The “left”—that abstract spatial entity—was taking away our freedoms and letting in immigrants and giving out welfare and just plain ruining the country. They almost never shut up about it. It’s probably impossible to say what kind of views Timbs would’ve adopted had his parents been apolitical, or just less militant about things. But there’s no doubt that his steady drift to the left was his way of showing defiance and self-determination and the rest of it. He hated his parents and, by all appearances, the feeling was mutual. While Timbs never showed up to school with black eyes or anything, I know for a fact that his father, Stan, roughed him up. When the abuse wasn’t physical it was verbal. I don’t think I can recall one moment of affection between the two of them, and I was over there a lot. His mother was nice enough as long as she wasn’t drinking, and I got the impression that her uglier traits had been picked up from her husband. Anyway, the abuse peaked and then came to a stop junior year, right around the time Timbs started pushing back against his father’s politics. They were going at it all the time. It got to the point where I refused to go over there anymore. Timbs would tell me the stories at school. One morning he walked up to me and said with a big smile on his face: “Knocked the bastard down.” “Stan?” “Yup. He got shitfaced again and came at me with his belt. But he’s so old and fat now, I hit him and shoved him back and he fell on his ass. He slept right there on the floor.” “Shit,” I said. “Well, I guess it was bound to happen.” “Sure was.” By the time we graduated high school, Timbs was calling himself a liberal and talking a lot about certain political issues. My own interest in politics was minimal—it still is—and this kind of drove a wedge between us. Nonetheless, we stayed close friends and both ended up going to college at MLU, where he studied communications and I studied business management. We lived close enough to campus to commute, but Timbs chose to dorm, probably to get away from his parents, who he still pretty much hated even though they had mellowed out some. I began seeing less and less of him after he found a group of politically active students to spend time with. One night during our second semester, I tagged along with Timbs and met up with his new friends at a coffee shop. “Who are these people again?” I asked as we walked down the sidewalk. “Just some friends of mine. We get together a few times a week. Some of them write for the school paper.” “Didn’t know we had a school paper.” He looked at me and flashed his old smile and said, “You should check it out.” Timbs told me we were going to be “engaging in discussion” that night, but all they seemed to do was complain about everything. A professor in one of the girls’ classes had assigned The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, which apparently has some like ugly racialized content in it, and they all talked for an hour about how that sort of thing should only be taught if everyone in the class consents to it. I don’t know much about books, but I tried saying that maybe the author was showing racism for a particular reason, and that the professor should be able to teach what he wants. Timbs and his friends didn’t like that, though, and it was like seven against one, so I decided to just shut up. It was pretty obvious they didn’t want me there, and furthermore that any opposing views weren’t welcome. A couple weeks later, Timbs invited me out again, same coffee shop with the same people. “I don’t know,” I told him. “I really don’t like talking about that stuff.” “Stuff?” “Yeah. You know, politics and stuff.” He sighed. “I don’t see how you can be so apathetic.” Then he paused and said with sort of a sneer, “Actually, I can. You’re white, and you’re male, so you don’t really have to worry about injustice or oppression.” I looked at him and frowned. It was the first time Timbs had ever said anything like that to me, and I’ll admit I was a little irritated by it. “Uh, so are you,” I said. “Which is why I’m being proactive and trying to change things.” “By doing what? Sitting around a coffee shop and agreeing with each other about everything?”\n\n“I write about issues.” He was getting defensive. “You wrote one article in the school paper,” I countered. “It was like two paragraphs long.” “More than you’ve done,” he snapped. “Why can’t you acknowledge that your privilege comes at the expense of other people?” “I don’t even know what the hell you’re talking about.” “My point exactly.” The smugness on his face made me want to clock him. “Whatever. I’m going to work out,” I said, turning away. “Have fun with your comrades.” Timbs and I didn’t speak much after that—mostly just text messages here and there—but he became more visible on campus, writing things in the school paper and attending politically-themed events and even taking part in protests. It seemed like he’d “found his calling,” and my thought was: whatever, good for him. A couple semesters after our falling out, MLU made headlines for its contribution to the debate about free speech on college campuses. Actually, there were two incidents that made the news (before the big one), and Timbs was involved in both of them. The first was when a few rogues went around distributing buttons and flyers with “Trump for President” written on them. They also chalked the slogan onto the sidewalk overnight. Well, shit hit the fan when a group of like forty students, including Timbs, responded by staging a demonstration in the student union. At first it was pretty uneventful, just a bunch of kids sitting there holding signs (“We Will Not be Intimidated,” “Hate Speech ≠ Free Speech,” etc.), but then a few students went over to them and began chanting “TRUMP, TRUMP, TRUMP.” People in the crowd started pelting the Trumpists with food and drinks. They came up with their own chant: “HEY HEY, HO HO, HATE SPEECH HAS GOT TO GO.” A few called for civil discussion in vain. One red-headed girl who was kind of fat tripped as she stepped forward and hit the deck, still waving her sign over her head and chanting her camp’s refrain from the floor. Onlookers, myself included, recorded the skirmish with their cell phones and uploaded the videos to Twitter. Campus security came over and defused the situation before any blood was shed, but Timbs and his cohorts, and particularly Timbs as it turned out, were just getting started. That same day, they sent out a mass email demanding the administration identify and expel whoever wrote “Trump for President” on the sidewalk. I happened to save a copy of the email on my laptop; here it is in full:\n\n“Prior to the commencement of pedagogy and learning on the very morning of Tuesday, March 3, one or more students presently enrolled in this very university thought it admissible to assault our campus grounds with vile and hateful pro-fascist rhetoric, using red, white and blue chalk to scrawl ‘Trump for President’ on the very tarmac each of us treks over on a daily basis in order that we may pursue unmolested our betterment as both college students and human beings (although we must on that note emphasize that we vehemently reject with passionate fury the patriarchal overtones of the noun ‘human,’ its last three letters constituting incontrovertible proof of the centralized position the male constituents of our species have, since time immemorial and at the horrifying expense of their female counterparts, enjoyed in this our profoundly phallogocentric society). While some radically privileged individuals have since sought to rationalize and legitimize the abovementioned hate speech via citation of so-called First Amendment rights, it is in fact the opinion of we the undersigned—henceforth known as the Student Assembly Against All Forms of Bigotry and Oppression Including But Not Limited to: Phallogocentrism, White Nationalism, Heteronormativity, Islamophobia, Cissexism, Ableism, Misogyny and Transphobia (SAAAFBOIBNLPWNHICAMT)— that such rhetorical violence as has been carried out by the anonymous and craven fascists in question cannot by any remotely reasonable standard of decorum or decency be judged mere ‘speech’ and thus cannot for one solitary moment be countenanced by any self-respecting institute of higher learning (a title to which this very university presumably lays claim), particularly given how many students have openly and bravely confessed to fearing for their very lives as a direct consequence of said violence. As such, on behalf of systemically marginalized voices everywhere, the SAAAFBOIBNLPWNHICAMT strenuously calls upon the very administration of this very institution to take swift and decisive action with the very exclusive aim of publicly identifying and subsequently expelling immutably the very perpetrators of this heinous and reprehensible act of extraordinary oppression. Reprisals are in order.”\n\nI’m pretty sure Timbs wrote that; his articles in the school paper\n\nwere just as confusing. Anyway, the administration responded saying that, while they appreciated and sympathized with the group’s concerns, they didn’t have the authority to expel whoever wrote the slogans. “As a public institution, we have a duty to uphold the right of our students to express themselves freely,” they wrote, if I remember right. This was met with calls for the dean of students to resign, and for campus safe spaces to be created in which Donald Trump’s name couldn’t be mentioned. By now the media was all over it, and MLU became like the epicenter of the whole free speech on campus controversy. It was impossible to avoid. One afternoon a reporter from The Daily Beast approached me and asked what I felt about everything. “I don’t know,” I told her. “I guess I don’t see what the big deal is.” She asked if I agreed that the students who wrote the chalk slogans should be expelled. “Not really. I mean, it’s a public college, right? I don’t really care what people write on the sidewalk.” Yeah, but did I make a distinction between free speech and hate speech? “I don’t know. I guess.” I’m not sure if she used my quotes in her article. Probably not. In response to all this, a group of conservative students called the Latter Day Lincolns invited some Fox News analyst—don’t remember his name—to speak on campus. Apparently he was known for saying a lot of tough things about immigrants, and this touched off the second incident, an extension of the first. Once the talk was scheduled, Timbs and his people took action to “de-platform” (their word) the speaker. They said his presence would create an environment of oppression and intimidation on campus, or something along those lines. A petition they wrote got a couple hundred signatures, and they lobbied the administration to cancel the speech. The LDL pushed back with talk of the First Amendment (at this point I actually went online and read the damn thing), and ultimately the talk went ahead as planned, although it was interrupted by protestors and had to be shut down prematurely. This was another big media story. Shortly before the semester ended I ran into Timbs outside the library. I hadn’t talked to him in months. He asked me how my classes went. “Not bad. As and Bs, I think. Finals will be hard though.” “Yeah.” He seemed distracted. “So did you help crash that speech?” He shook his head. “Nah. I didn’t want to dignify it.” “Right,” I said, confused. “I guess—” “It’s obvious that we can’t rely on the university to police this stuff. We have to do everything ourselves. Which is fine.” I paused. “Yeah, but you can’t just prevent people from speaking, can you? I mean, it’s unconstitutional.” “The Constitution is not absolute,” he shot back. “Things change, cultures evolve. If the Bill of Rights gets in the way of justice, we have a right to defy it. The free speech absolutists don’t have a leg to stand on. They won’t win this war.” “War?” “That’s right. Any alliance whose purpose is not the intention to wage war is senseless and useless.” There was silence for a few seconds as I mulled that over. I’d heard it somewhere before. “Anyway,” I said, “what else have you been up to?” “Not much. Listen, I have to get to work on a research paper. I’ll see you around.” And he turned and walked into the library. That was the last time I saw or spoke to Timbs. That said, I received a letter from him last month, which I guess is what made me reflect on all this. Here’s what he wrote:\n\n“You’re the only person I ever considered a true friend, so I really couldn’t have written this to anyone else. I’ve had a lot of time to think about everything. When you’re in here time seems to stand still. All you can do is sit and think, and I’ve done a lot of both. Needless to say, I regret what I became and what I did. But I have to stress: I refuse to shift all the blame onto my parents, despite what my ‘doctor’ here says. They were bad parents and bad people (Stan is dead, by the way—esophageal cancer). They manufactured an atmosphere of anger and hate. It infected everyone and everything close to them. He was worse than she was. He inflicted his self-hatred onto her. As long as he was miserable, no one else was allowed to be happy. That was his main principle in life. I wonder was he always like that? But it doesn’t matter. I’ve grown\n\ntired of hating them. There’s no use. We are all endowed by our Creator with free will, as is made plain in the book of Genesis. We all make our own choices, and we alone are responsible for them. That Eve was deceived by the serpent does not in God’s eyes extenuate her treachery. She betrayed His trust, and we all suffer from perpetual guilt as a result. The immediate consequences of what I did were horrid. Again, that goes without saying. But what bothers me more are the indirect consequences. I did irreparable damage to the cause I claimed to be fighting for. I wasn’t fighting for it. I was exploiting it. My motives were purely selfish. Now, opponents of equity and justice can point to me and my actions to fortify their position. And they have an undeniable point, and that’s entirely my fault, and I don’t think I’ll ever live it down, no matter how many times I repent. I’m still working to determine exactly what went wrong for me and where. Maybe one day I’ll figure it out. Maybe I’ll die trying. Self-pity is grotesque, and yet nobody chooses to indulge in it. Given the chance, I think I would go back and pull the trigger of Stan’s gun, the one I held in my mouth all those times as a teenager. If only I hadn’t been so afraid. I suppose I don’t have much else to say. I just wanted to get some of my thoughts down, and you’re the only person to whom I could think to address them. There’s really just nobody else. But—see?—now I’m starting on the self-pity again. Take care of yourself. JT”\n\nWhen it happened I was away at a different college, halfway across the country. I had transferred to be close to a girl I met over summer and started dating. Plus, they had a better business program, and I’m currently pursuing my MBA there. Anyway, by this time I had mostly forgotten about Timbs and his various antics. He was the furthest thing from my mind that fall, which made everything more jarring. It was a Friday night in November. My then-girlfriend Chrissy and I were getting ready to leave for dinner at this Thai place we both liked when I got a call from my mother. “Have you heard the news?” she said. “What news?” “Turn on the TV. Someone was killed.” “What?” I started for the living room. “Someone was killed at MLU.” “Really?” “Yes.” “Who was it?” And as I said this, CNN’s news bulletin took over the television screen. “I’ll call you back,” I said, turning up the volume. Chrissy walked over. “What is it?” “Just a minute,” I told her, giving all my attention to the TV. They were interviewing an MLU student. “It just sounded like this really loud popping sound,” the kid said, wide-eyed, breathing fast. “Like a— like a boxer hitting a punching bag with microphones in his gloves. Then all of a sudden everyone was screaming and hitting the floor. It was almost surreal. It’s like you don’t accept that it’s actually happening, you know?” Moments later, Anderson Cooper came on and gave a recap. “To repeat, for those of you who are just joining us,” he said, “controversial conservative activist Nemo Constantinides, known for taking an adversarial stance on issues of religion and gender, was shot and killed while delivering a speech to a large group of students at MLU earlier this evening. The suspect or suspects in the shooting have yet to be identified, though multiple reports indicate that one individual was apprehended at the scene and is now in police custody. MLU was the site of two major controversies earlier this year when liberal students…” His voice trailed off as I processed the news. Chrissy was still asking me questions. “I went to school there,” I said, staring at the floor and shaking my head. “Fuckin’ Timbs.” “What’s Timbs?” “Hm? Oh. Just an old friend. I’ll tell you more at dinner.” And as we walked out to catch our Uber, it suddenly struck me where Timbs had got that idea about alliances and war."
