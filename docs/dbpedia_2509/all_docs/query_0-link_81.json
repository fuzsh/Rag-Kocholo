However, this is probably incorrect, as it seems more likely that her birth was registered in the March Quarter of 1846 under the name Sanders.\n\nThis does not fit with her age in 1851 and 1861 censuses and the birth of an Elizabeth Saunders in the Dudley registration district in September quarter is more likely since Tipton is in this district and the year should have been 1847.
