Condition: Fair. No Jacket. 1st. THIS IS VOLUME 2 of 2 ONLY which is pages 433 to 871!!! I do NOT have Vol. I. COLLECTIBLE, engravings throughout, NOTE many of the engravings are laid in, in Reverse Mat format which is extremely time consuming and requires a highly skilled person to make it look like a solid page. The Plate facing page 441 was 2 engravings pieced together to form a full page. A Very Unique Volume. The Originally 3/4-leather, has bright gild page edges, lettering/decoration, Original Marbled boards with some tape residue on front leather, had 5-ribbed binding but the Spine cover is in pieces as shown in the pictures and is included, the Cover boards are detached, has Marbled End Papers/Pages, the front has duct tape on it and will require careful patient removal to not further damage the End paper, the rear ones are clean but separated, edge wear, damage to page 433/434 and the first engraving. The text block binding except for the first page, appears to be solid. Seller's image, know what you are getting! This has to be the 1855 edition as it ends on page 871 and the 1867 second edition ends on page 900. Pre-packing weight is 5 lb. 12.8 oz . ORIGINAL, NOT A REPRINT, REBIND OR PHOTOCOPY!! NO Dust Jacket. CLEAN TEXT! Owner bookplate on Front End Paper. See Picture! The Copyright date is Ca.1855 for this Printing. This volume was purchased through Local public auction. It is a shame that when the library people digitized the 1867 edition, that they did not include the plates (engravings). This leaves the reader with no appreciation for the structure or item being described. Text is important, but it is not the whole ballgame. Thank you for your purchase from Sunset Books!
