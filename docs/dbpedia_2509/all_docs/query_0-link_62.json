        "text": "Gaza and the West Bank: ancient semitic antipathies drive the bloodshed\n\nIt is estimated that from October 7, 2023 until May, 2024, close to 36,000 Palestinians and 1500 Israelis have lost their lives in the Hamas-Israel war. Thousands more Gazans have perished from malnutrition or disease or have disappeared under mountains of sand and rubble. Continue reading »\n\nPope fires warning shot to Church leaders who would defy Vatican II\n\nThe neo-traditionalists have been sent a clear message by Pope Francis that their dismissal of synodality, and their disruptive behaviour do violence to the very nature of the Church itself and thereby damage the Reign of God. Continue reading »\n\nAn unexpected Easter in Ukraine\n\nOn Easter night and for the entire season, Ukranians will greet one another with the faith affirmation: “Христос воскрес” (Khrystos voskres). воістину воскрес (vo-ee-stynu voskres)” and the Russians with their own: “Христос воскрес! (Kristos voskrjes!) Воистину воскрес! (Vaistinu voskrjes!)”. Christ is Risen, He is risen indeed. Continue reading »\n\nCatholicism must grow up\n\nCatholic reform leader, Sr Joan Chittister OSB, has told a large Australian audience that Catholicism “must grow up” and that Catholics want a reformed Church. Sr Joan boosted the calls for change in the Australian Catholic church in an inspiring address to a 3,000-strong audience. Continue reading »\n\nChrist is risen, He is risen indeed\n\nDuring his final week of his life, Jesus world was savagely ripped away from him. And it all happened so quickly. He was arrested by the Roman troops in a security sweep of Jerusalem during the Passover celebrations. He was charged with sedition, convicted and sentenced to death as a criminal. He suffered an utterly Continue reading »\n\nReflecting on the lead up to Jesus’ final week\n\nDuring Holy Week Christians will experience in their liturgies an intense symbolic overload. In the space of eight days, the unfolding drama of Jesus’ final days, the confronting brutality he endured and his death by crucifixion give way to the great surprise of the faith, the Resurrection. Continue reading »\n\nCatholic Bishops cannot govern their dioceses without pastoral councils\n\nOnly seven of the 28 Australian Catholic dioceses have pastoral councils. It seems that protecting the independence of ecclesiastical fiefdoms is more important than promoting the common good of the Church in this country. Continue reading »\n\nThe Polding House Push and The Catholic Weekly Bugle.\n\nOver the past year in particular, Australian Catholics have become convinced that their bishops, with some exceptions, are playing games with them in the lead up to the national Plenary Council which is now scheduled to start in October 2021. Some believe, not unreasonably, that important stages in the process have been closely micro managed Continue reading »\n\nBishops and branch stacking: the second oldest profession\n\nBranch stacking scandals are not new to Australian politics of whatever colour. Nor is the phenomenon new to the Catholic Church. In fact, the caper originated within Jesus’ inner circle and it hasn’t let up since. Continue reading »\n\nDAVID TIMBS. Archbishop Comensoli needs to cut the ecclesiastical umbilical cord.\n\nPeter A Comensoli has been the Catholic Archbishop of Melbourne for just on a year. So far he has demonstrated very little understanding of the disastrous situation he inherited. Nor has he shown any clear indication of the kind of vision and leadership needed to navigate a way though. Continue reading »\n\nDAVID TIMBS. Australia’s bishops are presently visiting the Pope. . What are they telling him and will Aus tralia’s ordinary Catholics ever find out?\n\nAustralia’s bishops are currently in Rome for their regular ‘ad limina’ visit to the tombs of Saints Peter and Paul . Their last visit was in 2011. While there they will meet Pope Francis, have meetings with many of the Vatican dicasteries (government departments), be briefed on Vatican policy, and in turn will background the Continue reading »\n\nDAVID TIMBS. The Pax Romana and the Gospel of Disturbance.\n\nThe first Roman Emperor, Augustus Caesar, is synonymous with a new age of optimism and hopefulness for the peoples of the Empire. This era of unprecedented peace, stability and prosperity came to be known as the Pax Romana. Jesus of Nazareth was born in to this world around 4 BCE. For his followers, Jesus’ birth Continue reading »\n\nDAVID TIMBS. The priest shortage and the elephant in the room.\n\nTwice in recent weeks, Fr James Clarke, Chair of the National Council of Priests (NCP), has stated that the majority of Australian priests and probably most laity support a comprehensive examination of all aspects of the Catholic priesthood and pastoral ministry in Australia including seminary formation of future priests. Clarke has also flagged that in Continue reading »\n\nDAVID TIMBS. The Catholic Church in Australia. Who has the Moral Authority?\n\nFor many of Australia’s Catholic bishops ‘business as usual’ meant denial that the culture, structures and processes of the Church were part of the problem. They had cut themselves off from the lived experience of ordinary Catholics and what they wanted their Church to be. If the planned Plenary (national) Council in 2020/2021 is to Continue reading »\n\nDavid Timbs. The Synod of Bishops.\n\nCatholic lay people face a very difficult task in attempting to influence the members of the 2015 Ordinary Synod of Bishops. Firstly, they will have a challenge in finding bishops to listen to them. Secondly, they will have a challenge in finding bishops ready to accept the risks associated with taking the Sensus Fidei Fidelium Continue reading »"
