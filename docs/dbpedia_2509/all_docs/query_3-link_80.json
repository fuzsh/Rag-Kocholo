        "text": "The latest dumping of snow has definitely brought out the winter gear, including Timberlands and long black bubble coats. Every where I go, I see guys wearing the tan, leather, rugged outdoor boots known as Timberlands, or Timbs. I see women wearing long black bubble coats. These are the latest trends, and while most people consider themselves individualists, as shown in the Lecture Tools activity on Tuesday, November 18, when the majority of college students dress alike, wearing Timbs and long black bubble coats, it actually classifies us as conformists.\n\nJohn Mill states in his book, On Liberty, in Chapter 3, a reason why students function in a conformist way according to society, “individual spontaneity is hardly recognised by the common modes of thinking”. Relating to college students, this sentence, implied by society, is saying that there is no benefit to being different. All guys should wear Timberlands all the time, and women need to wear black bubble coats every time we’re seen outside. If the majority highly regards this trend, it is surely terrific enough for everyone.\n\nBut, then, good ol’ Mill rallies back. He basically says that it’s important to question why people are doing the same things, buying the same Timbs, and purchasing the same coats. Does this mean that college students who wear Timbs are blue collar?…No.\n\nHe encourages people to ponder the functionality behind cultural trends with the statement, “He who does anything because it is the custom, makes no choice..” If a men and women make the decision to wear Timbs or black bubble coats, simply because everyone else is wearing them, they are dumbing down to society. Mill pushes society to seek the pros and cons of blending in with the crowd.\n\nThere are definite, plausible reasons for these trends in fashion. Timbs are waterproof, insulated, provide ankle support, feature heavy tread, and are nearly indestructible. The same could be said for black bubble long coats. They are cozy, fashionable, and provide warm for the lower half of the body, in addition to the upper half. The reason why these items are trending is because their functionality is through the roof. But, if a person does not complete their research before buying Timbs or a black bubble long coat, there could be something better out there."
