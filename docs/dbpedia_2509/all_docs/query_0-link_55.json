His published works amounted to around one hundred and fifty two volumes.\n\n(notes)\n\n-STRANGE HALLUCINATION.-\n\nOn the 25th of November, 1840, Mr. Pearce, the author of several medical works, was tried at the Central Criminal Court for shooting at his wife with intent to murder, and acquitted on the ground of insanity. He entertained the peculiar notion that his wife had attempted to destroy him in various ways, the principal of which was by keeping his bed constantly damped or wetted. This idea seems to have haunted him continually.\n\nHe was after taken to Bethlem Hospital. For some time he refused to go into the airing-ground in order, as it appeared, that he might watch his cell door to prevent anything “villainous” being done.\n\nIn a letter addressed to the Governors of the Hospital, Pearce solicited that a lock might be put upon his cell-door to protect him from this annoyance; and concluded his letter with this appeal: \" I, having been estimated by persons of some consideration in society, am now, by a wretched chain of circumstances, in a great prison hospital, doomed to herd with desperadoes against the State, and the mad.\"\n\n“Technically speaking, the matter of which I complain is not a delusion; it is an allegation—a positive charge, susceptible of proof, if proper evidence could be brought to bear upon the fact, and not warped by the man or men in whose power I hourly am. Have I declared that I am composed of straw? I have no such crotchets. I implore you to consider well the distinction between the things which cannot be and the things which can. It is a vital one in my sad case.\n\n“It may be told you I have charged persons elsewhere with this atrocity of damping my bed. I have done so. At the private madhouse, near Uxbridge, my bed was kept almost wet for three months, and I only saved my life by sleeping in a large trunk. \"\n\nMr. Pearce, in a very collected manner then stated that since his marriage-trip to Boulogne, he had been subjected to the greatest abuses from his wife. On one occasion, had been struck by her, plus insulted. He went on to state that when first brought to Bethlem Hospital, he had been “chummed” with Oxford, and objected, but had been compelled to associate with that ruffian. He eventually succeeded in teaching Oxford the French language. Oxford then conveyed to him some matter of importance relative to the great crime which he had committed, and which he (Mr. Pearce) thought of sufficient importance to be communicated to the Secretary of State in a letter written in Latin detailing the circumstances. It had, however, been taken from him, and he did not know whether it had ever been sent to Downing Street. He wished to show how Oxford boasted of having cajoled Sir A. Morrison and Dr. Monro into a belief that he was insane, and how he sent for such books as Jack the Giant-Killer in order to make the jury let him off on the ground of insanity. This was what he (Mr. Pearce) wished to tell the Secretary of State, and now the letter was used against him.\n\nAfter some further remarks, Mr. Pearce was questioned by the jury, and he persisted in the statements that his bed was damped, that deleterious drugs were applied to his clothes, and that a conspiracy existed against him. He produced from under his clothes a small packet, which he said contained portions of the shirt of which mention had been made, and a snuff-box, in which he stated he had kept parts of the shirt, and which he “ demanded” to have submitted to the tests of Professor Faraday. He announced himself to be grand-nephew of Zachariah Pearce, Bishop of Rochester, and translator of Longinus, and prayed, in conclusion, the jury to relieve him from the situation in which he was placed.\n\nThe jury returned a verdict to the effect that \"Mr. Pearce was not sane enough, and that he had not been so from about the 16th of October, 1840.\"\n\n•• •••• •• •• •••• ••• ••• ••• •••\n\n-HERMITS-\n\nIt is curious to find many instances of what are termed “Ornamental Hermits,\" set up by persons of fortune seeking to find men as eccentric as themselves, to represent, as it were, the eremitical life in hermitages provided for them upon their estates.\n\nArchibald Hamilton, afterwards Duke of Hamilton, advertised for “a hermit,\" as an ornament to his pleasure-grounds; and it was stipulated that the said hermit should have his beard shaved but once a year, and that only partially.\n\nGilbert White, in his poem, The Invitation to Selborne, has these lines :\n\n“Or where the Hermit hangs the straw-clad cell,\n\nEmerging gently from the leafy dell;\n\nBy fancy plann’d,” &c.\n\nIn Blackwood's Magazine for April, 1830, it is stated by Christopher North, in the Noctes Ambrosianæ, that the then editor of another magazine had been “for fourteen years hermit to Lord Hill's father, and sat in a cave in that worthy baronet's grounds with an hourglass in his hand, and a beard belonging to an old goat, from sunrise to sunset, with orders to accept no half crowns from visitors, but to behave like Giordano Bruno.\n\nIn 1810, a correspondent of Notes and Queries, visiting the grounds at Hawkestone, was shown the hermitage there, with a stuffed figure dressed like the hermits of pictures, seen by a dim light; and the visitors were told that it had been inhabited in the daytime by a poor man, to whom the eccentric but truly benevolent Sir Richard Hill gave a maintenance on that easy condition; but that the popular voice against such slavery had induced the worthy baronet to withdraw the reality and substitute the figure.\n\nA person advertised to be engaged as a hermit, in the Courier, January 11th, 1810: “A young man, who wishes to retire from the world and live as a hermit, in some convenient spot in England, is willing to engage with any nobleman or gentleman who may be desirous of having one. Any letter, mentioning what gratuity will be given, and all other particulars, will be duly attended.”\n\n“His food the fruits, his drink the crystal well” – our Surrey hermit subsisted almost entirely upon ferns, which abound in this neighbourhood. On January 11th, 1840, he was seen by two labourers, who described him as not having “two pounds of flesh on all his bones.” He was carried to the nearest cottage, placed in a warm bath, next wrapped in blankets, where he soon died; his last words being : “Do take me to the cave again.”\n\nA Correspondent of Notes and Queries describes a gentleman near Preston, Lancashire, as more successful in the above eccentricity. He advertised a reward of 501. a year for life to any man who would undertake to live seven years underground, without seeing anything human; and to let his toe and finger nails grow, with his hair and beard, during the whole time. Apartments were prepared underground and an occupier offered himself, and actually stayed in it, observing the required conditions, for four years.\n\nThe shapes of his 20 or so hats and the devices on them were each intended to symbolize some important fact or sentiment. One hat, which he named “Military,” had some resemblance to that worn by military commanders ; but, instead of the military plume, his hat had two horse's ears. This hat, which he asserted cost five pounds, he never wore but on important occasions.\n\nA mania for symbolization pervaded all his thoughts and doings. His garden was a complete collection of emblems. The trees-the walks—the squares—the beds--the flowers-the seats and arbours—were all symbolically arranged. In the passage leading into the garden were “the three seats of Self-Inquiry,\" each inscribed with one of these questions : “Am I vile ?” “Am I a Hypocrite?” “Am I a Christian ?” Among the emblems and mottoes which were marked by different coloured pebbles or flowers were these :-“The vessels of the Tabernacle;\" “The Christian's olive-branch baptismal-font\", \" the breastplate of righteousness\", &c. “Mount Pisgah;\" \"a circle enclosed motto\", “ Eternal Love has wed my Soul;” “A Bee-hive;\" \"A Church;” “Sacred Urn;\" “Universal Grave;\" \"Bed of Diamonds ;” “A Heart, enclosing the Rose of all the Implements used in Gardening\" “The two Hearts' Bowers ;\" “The Lovers' Prayer;” “Conjugal Bliss;” “The Hermit's Coat-of-Arms;\" with motto, “ Don't tell anybody!” “ The Kitchen-walk” \"Representations of Culinary Utensils\", \"Mottoes\". \"Square Venison Pasty;\" “ \"Round of Beef &c.\" “The Fellows' Square\" , “ The Hen-pecked Husband\" \"the put on\" \"Water-gruel.” “The\"Oratory mottoes\" “The Orchestry,\" etc.\n\nHe also raised a mock-gallows in his garden, and suspended on it an effigy of the Pope, whimsically dressed, with many books sticking out of his pockets, which, he said, contained the doctrines of Popery. However, these preachings proved very unprofitable; the hermit grew poor, and gladly accepted any assistance which did not require him to relinquish his eccentric mode of living. In his own words, his heart was in his garden."
