See you there! #EmployerHealthcare #AEHCStrategyForSuccess #AlabamaEmployers #AlabamaHealthcare #Benefits #JoinAEHC2024\n\nOn 30 August 2023, in the Q&A portion of a webinar for Meetings Today (which should be available soon for viewing on demand) on which I spoke about on #risk and #contingency planning for #meetings and #events, I was asked about #boycotts of cities after discussing, as part of the content, laws enacted that are causing groups to reconsider what cities to select. I said there are many reasons groups choose not to send RFPs or select cities. One example: long-ago, very high New York City #HotelTaxes as a reason many groups didn't select the city for meetings. The result? Lowering of those taxes. In the content was the consideration of available #MedicalCare when selecting a destination. Today, news of the closing of the only hospital in the third largest Oregon city made me wonder - in addition to the crisis for the residents - a) how the DMO (#CVB) will sell the city and what they will tell groups about care and b) if not selecting a city for lack of care is 'boycotting.'
