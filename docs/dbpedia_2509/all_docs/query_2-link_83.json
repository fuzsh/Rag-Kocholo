He is bald, except a lock on the forehead; hence Swift says: Time is painted with a lock before, and bald behind, signifying thereby that we must take him (as we say) by the forelock; for when it is once passed, there is no recalling it.\n\nThe scythe occurs in Shirley’s lines, written early in the seventeenth century:\n\nThe glories of our blood and state\n\nAre shadows, not substantial things;\n\nThere is no armour against fate;\n\nDeath lays his icy hand on kings.\n\nSceptre and crown\n\nMust tumble down,\n\nAnd in the dust be equal made\n\nWith the poor crooked scythe and spade.\n\nShakspeare prefers the scythe:\n\nTime doth transfix the flourish set on youth,\n\nAnd delves the parallels in beauty’s brow,\n\nFeeds on the rarities of nature’s truth,\n\nAnd nothing stands but for his scythe to mow.\n\nThe stealthiness of his flight is also told by Shakspeare:\n\nLet’s take the instant by the forward top;\n\nFor we are old, and our quick’st decrees\n\nThe inaudible and noiseless foot of Time\n\nSteals ere we can effect them.\n\nMayne thus quaintly describes his flight:\n\nTime is the feather’d thing,\n\nAnd whilst I praise\n\nThe sparklings of thy locks, and call them rays,\n\nTakes wing—\n\nLeaving behind him, as he flies,\n\nAn unperceived dimness in thine eyes.\n\nGascoigne also thus paints the flight:\n\nThe heavens on high perpetually do move;\n\nBy minutes’ meal the hour doth steal away,\n\nBy hours the days, by days the months remove,\n\nAnd then by months the years as fast decay;\n\nYea, Virgil’s verse and Tully’s truth do say,\n\nThat Time flieth, and never clasps her wings;\n\nBut rides on clouds, and forward still she flings.\n\nShakspeare pictures him as the fell destroyer:\n\nMisshapen time, copesmate of ugly night;\n\nSwift subtle post, carrier of grisly care;\n\nEater of youth, false slave to false delight,\n\nBase watch of woes, sin’s pack-horse, virtue’s snare:\n\nThou nursest all, and murderest all that are.\n\nAnd Spenser brands him as\n\nWicked Time, that all good thoughts doth waste,\n\nAnd workes of noblest wits to naught outweare.\n\nThe present section partakes much of the aphoristic character, which has its recommendatory advantages.—Bacon says: Aphorisms representing a knowledge broken do invite men to inquire further; whereas methods, carrying the show of a total, do secure men as if they were at farthest. Again: Nor do apophthegms only serve for ornament and delight, but also for action and civil use, as being the edge-tools of speech, which cut and penetrate the knots of business and affairs.\n\nColeridge is of opinion that, exclusively of the Abstract Sciences, the largest and worthiest portion of our knowledge consists of Aphorisms; and the greatest and best of men is but an Aphorism.\n\n\"Truths, of all others the most awful and interesting, are too often considered as so true, that they lose all the power of truth, and lie bedridden in the dormitory of the soul, side by side with the most despised and exploded errors.\n\nThere is one way of giving freshness and importance to the most commonplace maxims,—that of reflecting on them in direct reference to our own state and conduct, to our own past and future being.\n\nMature and sedate wisdom has been fond of summing up the results of its experience in weighty sentences. Solomon did so; the wise men of India and Greece did so; Bacon did so; Goethe in his old age took delight in doing so.\n\nLucretius has his philosophical view of Time, which Creech has thus Englished:\n\nTime of itself is nothing, but from Thought\n\nReceives its rise, by lab’ring fancy wrought\n\nFrom things consider’d, while we think on some\n\nAs present, some as past, or yet to come.\n\nNo thought can think on Time,\n\nBut thinks on things in motion or at rest.\n\nOvid has some illustrations, which Dryden has thus translated:\n\nNature knows\n\nNo steadfast motion, but or ebbs or flows.\n\nEver in motion, she destroys her old,\n\nAnd casts new figures in another mould.\n\nEven times are in perpetual flux, and run,\n\nLike rivers from their fountains rolling on.\n\nFor Time, no more than streams, is at a stay,—\n\nThe flying hour is ever on her way;\n\nAnd as the fountain still supplies her store,\n\nThe wave behind impels the wave before;\n\nThus in successive course the minutes run,\n\nAnd urge their predecessor minutes on,\n\nStill moving, ever anew; for former things\n\nAre set aside, like abdicated kings;\n\nAnd every moment alters what is done,\n\nAnd innovates some act till then unknown.\n\n****\n\nTime is th’ effect of motion, born a twin,\n\nAnd with the worlds did equally begin:\n\nTime, like a stream that hastens from the shore,\n\nFlies to an ocean where ’tis known no more:\n\nAll must be swallow’d in this endless deep,\n\nAnd motion rest in everlasting sleep.\n\n****\n\nTime glides along with undiscover’d haste,\n\nThe future but a length behind the past,\n\nSo swift are years.\n\n****\n\nThy teeth, devouring Time! thine, envious Age!\n\nOn things below still exercise your rage;\n\nWith venom’d grinders you corrupt your meat,\n\nAnd then, at ling’ring meals, the morsels eat.\n\nThe comparison to a river is more amply developed by a modern poet:\n\nThe lapse of time and rivers is the same:\n\nBoth speed their journey with a restless stream;\n\nThe silent pace with which they steal away,\n\nNo wealth can bribe, no prayers persuade to stay:\n\nAlike irrevocable both when past,\n\nAnd a wide ocean swallows both at last.\n\nThough each resembles each in every part,\n\nA difference strikes, at length, the musing heart:\n\nStreams never flow in vain; where streams abound,\n\nHow laughs the land with various plenty crown’d!\n\nBut time, that should enrich the nobler mind,\n\nNeglected, leaves a dreary waste behind.\n\nAn old playwright makes him a fisher by the stream:\n\nNay, dally not with time, the wise man’s treasure,\n\nThough fools are lavish on’t—the fatal fisher\n\nHooks souls, while we waste moments.\n\nHorace has some lines, thus paraphrased by Oldham:\n\nAlas! dear friend, alas! time hastes away,\n\nNor is it in your power to bribe its stay;\n\nThe rolling years with constant motion run,\n\nLo! while I speak, the present minute’s gone,\n\nAnd following hours still urge the foregoing on.\n\n’Tis not thy wealth, ’tis not thy power,\n\n’Tis not thy piety can thee secure;\n\nThey’re all too feeble to withstand\n\nGray hairs, approaching age, and thy avoidless end.\n\nWhen once thy glass is run,\n\nWhen once thy utmost thread is spun,\n\n‘Twill then be fruitless to expect reprieve;\n\nCould’st thou ten thousand kingdoms give\n\nIn purchase for each hour of longer life,\n\nThey would not buy one gasp of breath,\n\nNor move one jot inexorable death.\n\nPerhaps there is no illustration in our language more impressive than Young’s noble apostrophe, commencing:\n\nThe bell strikes one. We take no note of time\n\nBut from its loss: to give it, then, a tongue\n\nIs wise in man. As if an angel spoke,\n\nI feel the solemn sound. If heard aright,\n\nIt is the knell of my departed hours.\n\nWhere are they? With the years beyond the flood.\n\n****\n\nO time! than gold more sacred; more a load\n\nThan lead to fools, and fools reputed wise.\n\nWhat moment granted man without account?\n\nWhat years are squandered, wisdom’s debt unpaid!\n\nOur wealth in days all due to that discharge.\n\n****\n\nYouth, is not rich in time; it may be poor;\n\nPart with it as with money, sparing; pay\n\nNo moment, but in purchase of its worth;\n\nAnd what’s it worth, ask death-beds; they can tell.\n\nPart with it as with life, reluctant; big\n\nWith holy hope of nobler time to come.\n\n****\n\nBut why on time so lavish is my song?\n\nOn this great theme kind Nature keeps a school\n\nTo teach her sons herself. Each night we die—\n\nEach morn are born anew; each day a life;\n\nAnd shall we kill each day? If trifling kills,\n\nSure vice must butcher. Oh, what heaps of slain\n\nCry out for vengeance on us; time destroyed\n\nIs suicide, where more than blood is spilt.\n\nThrow years away!\n\nThrow empires, and be blameless: moments seize;\n\nHeaven’s on their wing: a moment we may wish,\n\nWhen worlds want wealth to buy. Bid day stand still,\n\nBid him drive back his car, and re-impart\n\nThe period past, regive the given hour.\n\nO for yesterdays to come!\n\nHow exquisite is this beguiling of time in Paradise Lost.\n\nWith thee conversing I forget all time;\n\nAll seasons, and their change, all please alike.\n\nHow beautifully has Burns alluded to these influences, in his Lines to Mary in Heaven:\n\nTime but the impression deeper makes,\n\nAs streams their channels deeper wear.\n\nThe Hon. W. R. H. Spencer has something akin to this in his Lines to Lady A. Hamilton:\n\nToo late I stay’d; forgive the crime;\n\nUnheeded flew the hours;\n\nHow noiseless falls the foot of Time\n\nThat only treads on flow’rs!\n\nEdward Moore, in one of his pleasing Songs, thus points to these charming influences:\n\nTime still, as he flies, adds increase to her truth,\n\nAnd gives to her mind what he steals from her youth.\n\nThe best lessons of life are to be learnt in his school:\n\nTaught by time, my heart has learn’d to glow\n\nFor others’ good, and melt at others’ woe.\n\nHow well has Shakspeare expressed this work of the great reconciler:\n\nTime’s glory is to calm contending kings,\n\nTo unmask falsehood, and bring truth to light,\n\nTo stamp its seal on aged things,\n\nTo wake the morn, and sentinel the night,\n\nTo wrong the wronger, till he render right.\n\nElsewhere Shakspeare paints him as the universal balm:\n\nCease to lament for that thou can’st not help,\n\nAnd study help for that which thou lament’st.\n\nTime is the nurse and breeder of all good.\n\nIt is notorious to philosophers, that joy and grief can hasten and delay time. Locke is of opinion that a man in great misery may so far lose his measure, as to think a minute an hour; or in joy make an hour a minute. Shakspeare’s divers paces of Time is too familiar for quotation here.\n\nTime’s Garland is one of the beauties of Drayton’s Elysium of the Muses:\n\nThe garland long ago was worn\n\nAs Time pleased to bestow it:\n\nThe Laurel only to adorn\n\nThe conqueror and the poet.\n\nThe Palm his due who, uncontroll’d,\n\nOn danger looking gravely,\n\nWhen fate had done the worst it could,\n\nWho bore his fortunes bravely.\n\nMost worthy of the Oaken wreath\n\nThe ancients him esteemed,\n\nWho in a battle had from death\n\nSome man of worth redeemed.\n\nAbout his temples grave they tie,\n\nHimself that so behaved,\n\nIn some strong siege by th’ enemy,\n\nA city that hath saved.\n\nA wreath of Vervains heralds wear,\n\nAmongst our garlands named,\n\nBeing sent that dreadful news to bear,\n\nOffensive war proclaimed.\n\nThe sign of peace who first displays,\n\nThe Olive wreath possesses;\n\nThe lover with the Myrtle sprays\n\nAdorns his crisped tresses.\n\nIn love the sad forsaken wight\n\nThe Willow garland weareth;\n\nThe funeral man, befitting night,\n\nThe baleful Cypress beareth.\n\nTo Pan we dedicate the Pine,\n\nWhose slips the shepherd graceth;\n\nAgain the Ivy and the Vine\n\nOn his front Bacchus placeth.\n\nThey who so stanchly oppose innovations, should remember Bacon’s words: Every medicine is an innovation, and he that will not apply new remedies must expect new evils; for time is the greatest innovator; and if time of course alter things to the worse, and wisdom and counsel shall not alter them to the better, what shall be the end?\n\nHow much time has to do with our successes is thus solemnly told by the Preacher: The race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, neither yet bread to the wise, nor yet riches to men of understanding, nor yet favour to men of skill; but time and chance happeneth to them all.—Ecclesiastes ix. 11.\n\nHow truthfully has Dr. Johnson said: So little do we accustom ourselves to consider the effects of time, that things necessary and certain often surprise us like unexpected contingencies. We leave the beauty in her bloom, and, after an absence of twenty years, wonder, at our return, to find her faded. We meet those whom we left children, and can scarcely persuade ourselves to treat them as men. The traveller visits in age those countries through which he rambled in his youth, and hopes for merriment in the old place. The man of business, wearied with unsatisfactory prosperity, retires to the town of his nativity, and expects to play away the last years with the companions of his childhood, and recover youth in the fields where he once was young.\n\nDr. Armstrong, the friend of Thomson, has left this solemn apostrophe on the Wrecks and Mutations of Time:\n\nWhat does not fade? the tower that long had stood\n\nThe crush of thunder and the warring winds,\n\nShook by the slow but sure destroyer Time,\n\nNow hangs in doubtful ruins o’er its base,\n\nAnd flinty pyramids and walls of brass\n\nDescend. The Babylonian spires are sunk;\n\nAchaia, Rome, and Egypt moulder down.\n\nTime shakes the stable tyranny of thrones,\n\nAnd tottering empires rush by their own weight.\n\nThis huge rotundity we tread grows old,\n\nAnd all these worlds that roll around the sun;\n\nThe sun himself shall die, and ancient night\n\nAgain involve the desolate abyss,\n\nTill the Great Father, through the lifeless gloom,\n\nExtend his arm to light another world,\n\nAnd bid new planets roll by other laws.\n\nWe remember a piece of stage sentiment, beginning\n\n\"Time! Time! Time! why ponder o’er thy glass,\n\nAnd count the dull sands as they pass?\" &c.\n\nIt was touchingly sung, but had too much of gloom and despondency for the theatre: possibly it may have reminded some of its hearers of their own delinquency.\n\nWith what solemnity has our great Dramatic Bard foreshadowed Time’s waning:\n\nTo-morrow, and to-morrow, and to-morrow,\n\nCreeps in this petty pace from day to day,\n\nTo the last syllable of recorded time;\n\nAnd all our yesterdays have lighted fools\n\nThe way to dusty death.\n\nHis departure is again sketched in Troilus and Cressida:\n\nTime is like a fashionable host,\n\nThat slightly shakes his parting guest by th’ hand,\n\nBut with his arms outstretch’d, as he would fly,\n\nGrasps the incomer.\n\nSir Walter Scott thus paints Time’s evanescence:\n\nTime rolls his ceaseless course.—The race of yore,\n\nWho danced our infancy upon their knee,\n\nAnd told our marvelling boyhood legends store\n\nOf their strange ’ventures happ’d by land or sea,\n\nHow are they blotted from the things that be!\n\nCowley has this significant couplet:\n\nTo things immortal Time can do no wrong,\n\nAnd that which never is to die for ever must be young.\n\nYet, what a treasure is this:\n\nMy inheritance! how wide and fair!\n\nTime is my estate; to Time I’m heir.\n\nWilhelm Meister: Carlyle.\n\nTime is almost a human word, and change entirely a human idea: in the system of nature we should rather say progress than change. The sun appears to sink in the ocean in darkness, but rises in another hemisphere; the ruins of a city fall, but they are often used to form more magnificent structures, as at Rome; but even when they are destroyed, so as to produce only dust, nature asserts her empire over them, and the vegetable world rises in constant youth, and in a period of annual successions, by the labours of man, providing food, vitality, and beauty upon the wreck of monuments which were once raised for purposes of glory, but which are now applied to objects of utility.\n\nAs this beautiful passage was written by Sir Humphry Davy nearly three-and-thirty years since, the above use of the word progress had nothing to do with the semi-political sense in which it is now commonly employed. Nevertheless, there occur in the writings of our great chemical philosopher occasional views of the advancement of the world in knowledge, and its real authors, with which the progressists of the present day fraternise.\n\nAt the above distance, Davy wrote in the following vein: In the common history of the world, as compiled by authors in general, almost all the great changes of nations are confounded with changes in their dynasties; and events are usually referred either to sovereigns, chiefs, heroes, or their armies, which do, in fact, originate entirely from different causes, either of an intellectual or moral nature. Governments depend far more than is generally supposed upon the opinion of the people and the spirit of the age and nation. It sometimes happens that a gigantic mind possesses supreme power, and rises superior to the age in which he is born: such was Alfred in England, and Peter in Russia. Such instances are, however, very rare; and in general it is neither amongst sovereigns nor the higher classes of society that the great improvers and benefactors of mankind are to be found.—Consolations in Travel, pp. 34, 35.\n\nBrilliant as was Davy’s own career, it had its life-struggles: his last days were embittered with sufferings, mental as well as physical; and in these moments he may have written these somewhat querulous remarks.\n\nTIME: PAST, PRESENT, AND FUTURE.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nHarris, in his Hermes, in his disquisition on Time, gives the distinction between the grammatical or conventional phrase, Present Time, and the more philosophical and abstract Now, or Instant. Quoting Nicephorus Blemmides, Harris would define the former as follows: Present Time is that which adjoins to the Real Now, or Instant, on either side being a limited time made up of Past and Future; and from its vicinity to that Real Now, said to be Now also itself. Whilst upon the latter term he remarks: As every Now or Instant always exists in Time, and without being Time is Time’s bound; the Bound of Completion to the Past, and the Bound of Commencement to the Future; and from hence we may conceive its nature or end, which is to be the medium of continuity between the Past and the Future, so as to render Time, through all its parts, one Intire and Perfect Whole.\n\nThus, logically, Time Present must be regarded as a mathematical point, having no parts or magnitude, being simply the end of the Past, and the beginning of the Future. Thus, perishing in action and eluding the grasp of thought, it is a nonentity, of which, at best, an intangible and shadowy existence can be predicated:\n\nDum loquimur fugerit invida\n\nÆtas.Hor.\n\nAnd we may ask of it, with its carpe diem, its manifold attributes, and imputed influences, as the poet Young does of the King of Terrors:\n\nWhy start at Death? Where is he? Death arrived\n\nIs past; not come, or gone, he’s never here.\n\nNight Thoughts, iv.\n\nIt is, however, in the more conventional sense that the phrase Present Time is generally made use of in writing and conversation. So Johnson, in his well-known passage: \"Whatever withdraws us from the power of our senses, whatever makes the past, the distant, or the future, predominate over the present, advances us in the dignity of thinking beings, &c. Here we have the Present\" invested with the dignity of individual existence, and compared with the Past and the Future, as having duration or extension with these; as if we should speak of a series of numbers, ascending on each side of nothing to infinity, as being divisible into negative, zero, and positive.\n\nAmong coincident forms of expression, on the part of writers who have spoken of the Present Time in its more precise and philosophical sense, is the following by Cowley, in a note to one of his Pindarique Odes: \"There are two sorts of Eternity; from the Present backwards to Eternity, and from the present forwards, called by the Schoolmen Æternitas à parte ante, and Æternitas à parte post. These two make up the whole circle of Eternity, which Present Time cuts like a Diameter.\"\n\nCarlyle, in his Essays (Signs of the Times), has this knowledgeful passage: \"We admit that the present is an important time; as all present time necessarily is. The poorest day that passes over us is the conflux of two Eternities, and is made up of currents that issue from the remotest Past, and flow onwards into the remotest Future. We were wise, indeed, could we discover truly the signs of our own times; and, by knowledge of its wants and advantages, wisely adjust our own position in it. Let us, then, instead of gazing idly into the obscure distance, look calmly around us for a little on the perplexed scene where we stand. Perhaps, on a more serious inspection, something of its perplexity may disappear, some of its distinctive characters and deeper tendencies more clearly reveal themselves; whereby our own relations to it, our own true aims and endeavours in it, may also become clearer.\"[1]\n\nLord Strangford has left these pathetic stanzas:\n\nTime was—when all was fresh, and fair, and bright,\n\nMy heart was bounding with delight,\n\nIt knew no pain, it felt no aching:\n\nBut o’er it all its airy woes\n\nAs lightly passed, or briefly staid,\n\nLike the fleet summer-cloud which throws\n\nOn sunny lands a moment’s shade,\n\nA momentary darkness making.\n\nTime is—when all is drear, and dim, and wild,\n\nAnd that gay sunny scene which smiled\n\nWith darkest clouds is gloomed and saddened;\n\nWhen tempest-toss’d on passion’s tide\n\nReason’s frail bark is madly driven,\n\nNor gleams one ray its course to guide\n\nFrom yon o’ercast and frowning heaven,\n\nTill peace is wreck’d and reason maddened.\n\nTime come—but will it e’er restore\n\nThe peace my bosom felt before,\n\nAnd soothe again my aching, tortured breast?\n\nIt will, for there is One above\n\nWho bends on all a Father’s eye;\n\nWho hears with all a Father’s love\n\nThe broken heart’s repentant sigh,\n\nCalms the vexed heart, and bids the spirit rest.\n\n1. Abridged from an excellent Communication, by William Bates, to Notes and Queries, 2d series, vol. x. p. 245.\n\nMEASUREMENT OF TIME.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nSir Thomas Browne, treating of Errors regarding Numbers, observes: \"True it is that God made all things in number, weight, and measure; yet nothing by them, or through the efficacy of either. Indeed, our days, actions, and motions being measured by time (which is but motion measured), whatever is observable in any, falls under the account of some number; which, notwithstanding, cannot be denominated the cause of these events. So do we unjustly assign the power of action even unto time itself; nor do they speak properly who say that time consumeth all things; for time is not effective, nor are bodies destroyed by it, but from the action and passion of their elements in it; whose account it only affordeth, and, measuring out their motion, informs us in the periods and terms of their duration, rather than effecteth or physically produceth the same.\"[2]\n\nTime can only be measured by motion: were all things inanimate or fixed, time could not be measured. A body cannot be in two places at the same instant; and if the motion of any body from one point to another were regular and equal, the divisions and subdivisions of the space thus marked over would mark portions of time.\n\nThe sun and the moon have served to divide portions of time in all ages. The rising and setting of the sun, the shortening and lengthening of the shadows of trees, and even the shadow of man himself, have marked the flight of time. The phases of the moon were used to indicate greater portions; and a certain number of full moons supplied us with the means of giving historical dates.\n\nFifteen geographical miles, east or west, make one minute of time. The earth turning on its axis produces the alternate succession of day and night, and in this revolution marks the smallest division of time by distances on its surface.\n\nIf each of the 360 degrees into which the circumference of the earth is divided, be subdivided into twenty-four hours, it will be found that 15 degrees pass under the sun during each hour, which proves that 15 degrees of longitude mark one hour of time: thus, as Berlin is nearly 15 degrees east of London, it is almost one o’clock when it is twelve at London.\n\nTime, like bodies, is divisible nearly ad infinitum. A second (a mere pulsation) is divided into four or five parts, marked by the vibrations of a watch-balance; and each of these divisions is frequently required to be lessened an exact 2880th part of its momentary duration. It is, however, impossible to see this; for Mr. Babbage, speaking of a piece of mechanism which indicated the 300th part of a second, tells us that both himself and friend endeavoured to stop it twenty times successively at the same point, but could not be confident of even the 20th part of a second.\n\nIt has been said that many simple operations would astonish us, did we but know enough to be so; and this remark may not be inapplicable to those who, having a watch losing half a minute per day, wish it corrected, though they may not reflect that as half a minute is the 2880th part of 24 hours, each vibration of the balance, which is only the fifth part of a second, must be accelerated the 2880th part of its instantaneous duration; while to make a watch, losing one minute per week, go correctly, each vibration must be accelerated the 1008th part of its duration, or the 50,400th part of a second.[3]"
