        "text": "Long Acre, WC2\n\nIn mediaeval times the forty acre patch of land we now know as Covent Garden formed the gardens of Westminster Abbey and Convent. Following the dissolution of the monasteries, in 1552 Edward VI gave this piece of prime London estate to John Russell, the then first Earl of Bedford, the family keeping title to the land until 1918. According to John Timbs in Curiosities of London, published in 1855, reported that the northern part of the area was known as the Elms and later Seven Acres. However, by the early 17th century Long Acre was used to describe the path running along the very northern perimeter of the estate. Today it still marks the northern perimeter of modern Covent Garden, linking Drury Lane in the east with St Martin’s Lane in the west.\n\nBeing the beneficiary of royal largesse didn’t come without its obligations. Charles I was offended by the state of the road and the houses along it and demanded that the Russells do something about it. They responded that they were stymied by the Proclamation concerning Buildings issued in 1625 which put restrictions on building in and around London. The king, always on the look-out for a few bob, granted Russell a licence for £2,000, empowering them to build as many new houses as he “shall thinke fit and convenient.”\n\nAnd so he did.\n\nThe rather impressive Italianate style building that occupies 30-31 Long Acre gives a clue to the principal industry of the area. The top of the building bears the legend “Carriage – Manufactory”. This particular building was not erected until 1878 but from the middle of the 18th century, if not before, the street was known for its carriage building. One of the principal coach makers was John Hatchett, whose family business operated from 1750 to 1850, from premises at No 121 – the strange numbering system of Long Acre with numbers 1 to 77 running along the south side and 78 to 144 on the north meant that his premises were directly opposite number 30.\n\nAccording to the Carriage Journal, the Hatchetts employed several hundred workers and they were known for high standards of workmanship and innovative designs, often copied by their rivals. By 1906 there were some 41 businesses on the street associated with transport. Competition was fierce and standards often slipped. An article in the Morning Post of February 1871 reported that many carriage accidents had occurred “in extremely dangerous transport made from hickory wood and steel tyres.” Carriage builders took pains in adverts to stress their experience and to warn the unwary against cheaper copies.\n\nThe death-knell for the carriage trade was the development of the motor car but Long Acre took this change in mode of transport in its stride. Austin Motors had a car showroom at No 134 from at least 1910 and they were soon joined by Mercedes (No 127-30), Daimler, and Fiat. Continuing the transport theme, a plaque on No 69 – 75, Acre House, alerts the passer-by to the fact that this was the site of the workshop of Denis Johnson who was trading therein 1819. His claim to fame was that he was the first to sell the hobby horse bicycle in the United Kingdom.\n\nAs a boy Long Acre first entered my consciousness as the postal address of Odhams Press in whose stable were such organs as the Daily Herald, Woman’s Own, Debretts, the Sporting Life, and for a time Britain’s most popular magazine, John Bull. Prior to Odhams occupation of the site between 1890 and 1970, it was the home of the iron-domed St Martin’s Hall, a music hall, from 1847 until it was burnt down by a fire in 1860 which had started in a nearby coach manufacturers. A splendid theatre, the Queen’s, was then built on the site with a seating capacity of 4,000 which made it the second largest in London. Actors treading the boards in its short life between 1867 and 1878 included Charles Wyndham, Henry Irving and Ellen Terry.\n\nAnd we should not forget No 132 which was the venue from which in 1929 John Logie Baird made the first British television broadcast. Today it is a busy, fairly non-descript thoroughfare full of shops and cafes. It is fascinating to think that if you had strolled down there 150 years ago, you would have heard the sound of sawing and hammering of nails.\n\nHow times change."
