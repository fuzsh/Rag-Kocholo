        "text": "over more than half a century. He\n\nwas of humble extraction, and was born\n\nin London on the 17 th of August, 1801.\n\nHe commenced authorship under the\n\nauspices of Sir Richard Phillips, and\n\nhis first publication, we believe, was a\n\nlittle guide hook to Dorking and its\n\nneighbournood, a locality with which\n\nhe was familiar as a boy. He subse-\n\nquently was editor, solely or conjointly,\n\nof the Mirror, one of the best and most\n\namusing of early cheap publications ;\n\nand for nearly twenty years after its\n\nestablishment by the late Mr Ingram,\n\nhe was the \"working editor\" of the\n\nIllustrated London News, to the columns\n\nof which he was also an extensive con-\n\ntributor on antiquarian subjects. He\n\nfirst made his name familiar to the pub-\n\nlic at large as the author of \" Things\n\nnot Generally Known,\" which be fol-\n\nlowed up with the \" Year Book of\n\nScience.\" \"Curiosities of History,\"\n\n\" Curiosities ofLondon,\" \"Schooldays\n\nof Eminent Men,\" \"Popular Errors\n\nExplained,\" \"Anecdote Biography,\"\n\n\"Tbe Clubs and Club Life of London,\"\n\n\"London and Westminster, City and\n\nSuburb; or Strange Events, Charac-\n\nteristics, and Changes of Metropolitan\n\nLife,\" \" Romance of London,\" \"Castles\n\nand Abbeys of Great Britain,\" \"Nota-\n\nbilia,\" \" Things to be Remembered in\n\nDaily Life,\" \"Knowledge for the\n\nTimes.\" Though not gifted with any\n\ngreat original powers he was one of the\n\nmost industrious of men, and there was\n\nscarcely a magazine of the last quarter\n\nof a century to which he was not at\n\nleast an occasional contributor. He\n\nwas an excellent collector of personal,\n\nlocal, and antiquarian gossip ; and he\n\ncould make up tbe most readable com-\n\nmon-place books on almost every sub-\n\nject of interest to lovers of old times,\n\nand to those who like good stories and\n\nquaint anecdotes. A few years ago,\n\nwhen about 70 years of age, he was\n\nnominated one of the \" Poor Brethren,\"\n\nor \" Pensioners\" of the Charterhouse ;\n\nbut he had resigned his gown and\n\nrooms some time before bis death."
