        "text": "“The Curiosities of Bees” is a vintage article on bee keeping, with sections on the queen bee, cell production, honey, and much more. This interesting and informative little volume offers the reader a broad introduction to the topic, exploring bee-society and natural history with handy tips and information that will be of utility to the bee keeper. Contents include: “The Commonwealth of Bees”, “The Sting of the Bee”, “A Strange Queen”, “Enemies of Bees”, “The Hum of Bees”, “Do Bees use Soot?”, “Bees and the Weather”, “Bees, and Death, and Funerals”, “Calls of Bees”, “The Calling of the Queen Bee”, etc. This volume will appeal to bee keepers new and old, and it would make for a handy addition to collections of allied literature. Many vintage books such as this are becoming increasingly scarce and expensive. We are republishing this book now in an affordable, modern, high-quality edition complete with a specially-commissioned new introduction on bee keeping."
