        "text": "Christmas - a time for giving? Well apparently not.... Having volunteered for charities for 42 years and worked for them for 26 years, this report today is quite depressing. If you can afford to give, please do, something is better than nothing. If you want to know who to give to, then please think about smaller, local charities - they are impacted the most. (The BUILD Charity www.buildcharity.co.uk will always be grateful for your support). I recently read that nationally charities with an income under ¬£100k have experienced a drop of 35% in grants and donations in the last year, and sadly many of them won't be here next Christmas to provide vital services to needy communities. The report published today says.....Due to the cost-of-living crisis, 25% of the public will give less to charity this Christmas, according to a recent poll. Match funding organisation Big Give polled 2,235 UK adults over three days in November to gather the findings. It found that 20% of respondents were not planning to donate to charity at all this Christmas. However, 38% of respondents planned to give the same as they usually do despite cost-of-living pressures. Some 7% said they would give more to charity this year, while 3% of those who do not usually donate, now plan to. - See more at: https://lnkd.in/e5WHujwN\n\nCan you afford NOT to give to charity in 2024? With the cost of living crisis, many people are having to rethink their charitable giving and this has led to a cost of giving crisis. Charities across the UK are struggling with juggling a higher demand for their services with a decline in income and increased costs. However, if this trend continues, 1 in 5 charities may be forced to shut their doors if they don‚Äôt get the support they need, according to research carried out by NCVO (National Council for Voluntary Organisations). In addition, 27% of charities say that they won‚Äôt be able to meet the demand for their services in 2024. The survey shows that only 35% of charities believe they can navigate the crisis through cost cutting, suggesting that many have already cut back as much as they can. And a quarter of charities are preparing to reduce the volume or variety of services they offer which means many people could lose the vital services they depend on. We never know when we are going to need the support of a charity; circumstances may mean that we need the services of a housing charity, a health charity, an advice line or a food bank. So, I ask again, can you afford NOT to give to charity in 2024?

One of the Guiding Principles at Brave is to be a force for good. We try to make the right decisions in the interests of our colleagues, our clients, our community, and the world around us. Part of this is our charitable giving of funding through donations and sponsorship, workshops, and volunteering our time. Today we would like to raise awareness for a few of the charities we support, should you be looking to support a charity with a donation - please consider supporting one of these incredible causes. Caring for Communities and People Exists to prevent the causes and reduce the effects of homelessness, family breakdown and exclusion. Midlands Air Ambulance Charity Saving lives by saving time, covering the largest air ambulance operating region in the UK. Parenting Mental Health Supporting parents with children suffering with mental health illness. Hope for Tomorrow Helps the NHS to bring cancer treatment closer to patients with mobile cancer care units, making their lives that much easier at a difficult time. And please do share your giving - you might inspire others to do the same. With charities in the UK facing significant financial deficits, and demand for their services and provisions increasing in response to the cost of living crisis, support has never been needed more. #givingtuesday #givingtuesday2023 #forceforgood\n\nInterested in people views on this, particularly those in the charity sector and those in hospitality. We are a drop in centre for vulnerable adults with a major focus on the homeless. We are lucky enough to lease a beautiful building which we can hire out as a venue for events at the weekend, from which we aim to raise 25% of our running costs. Like all venues a massive part of our clientele are charities. We are always being asked to do the hire for free. We do give a small charity discount but my strict policy is not to do 100% free. It is not my personal fiefdom, the venue is funded by our donors who choose to fund the work we do, not the work of others. By blocking space from a paying client, a charity event literally means our donors have supported that charity. How would I make the choices of who to let have for it free and who not without imposing my personal preferences on it? I feel that this is reasonable but regularly experience guilt trips and push back. Thoughts?\n\nYou help make a differenceCharities can carry out their crucial work thanks to the generosity of people like you. And when you donate to a cause you care about, you'll know that your decision to donate is making a tangible impact on the lives of those the charity helps.What are the benefits of charity?Charitable giving allows us to contribute to causes we care about deeply, providing a sense of purpose and fulfillment. Knowing our actions positively impact the lives of others can bring a profound sense of satisfaction, boosting overall well-being and happiness. Donors can attest to the benefits of giving.What are the advantages of helping the poor?Benefits of Helping the NeedyYou can make a difference. Making a difference doesn't necessarily mean taking huge steps like solving climate change or eradicating poverty. ...It improves society as a whole. ...It makes you happy. ...It helps you see life from a different https://lnkd.in/dak_Gt9f you help yourself by helping others?Evidence shows that helping others can also benefit our own mental health and wellbeing. For example, it can reduce stress as well as improve mood, self-esteem and happiness. There are so many ways to help others as part of our everyday lives. Good deeds needn't take much time or cost any https://lnkd.in/dqVCGNXt.\n\nToday's tip is about gifts to charity. Where possible you should ‚ÄúGift Aid‚Äù any payments to charity to provide a further benefit to the charity. If you are a higher rate taxpayers you can obtain additional tax relief on the grossed-up amount donated. For example, where an individual makes a ¬£20 cash donation to charity the charity is able to reclaim a further ¬£5 from HMRC making a gross gift of ¬£25. Where the individual is a 40% higher rate taxpayer he or she is able to claim a further ¬£5 tax relief under self-assessment, reducing the net cost of their donation to ¬£15. You are required to make a declaration that you are a UK taxpayer. Remember that Gift Aid does not just apply to gifts of cash. Many charity shops will now sell donated items on your behalf and are able to treat the sale proceeds as Gift Aided donations. #TipTuesday #taxadvice #charity #charitablegiving #giftaid\n\nIt's Friiiiiiiiiidddddaaaayyyyyyy This week, a head-hunter targets #ProcurementBert ......along with a hundred others. We have decided we specifically need YOU for this role, but despite this assessment, please complete hundreds of forms telling us about yourself. üòù ‚ùÑ Brrrr. Its freezing at the moment. And that's just inside. It must be literally unbearable for those living on the streets. ü•Ç So, thank you so much to everyone who has donated so far to our fundraiser for Shelter. We are up to a whopping ¬£1255 so far. I just can't convey how grateful I am to you all, you are the absolute BEST üïí However, we're doing this for another 11 months so we are not stopping yet Linked-Inmates. üôè I know money can be tight especially at this time of the year. But please, if you haven't yet donated please consider it, even if you can only spare the cost of a coffee. It really all helps to make a massive difference to those who need it most. You can donate here; https://lnkd.in/evJr-6Yd #Procurement #HeadHunting #SupportShelterUK AVAM Solutions Ltd --------------------------------------------------------------- #ProcurementBert is proudly sponsored by Simfoni, with 100% of the sponsorship money being donated to Shelter to help the fight against homelessness. In addition, we are trying to raise as much as we can for Shelter via donations. You can donate here; https://lnkd.in/evJr-6Yd Your money will make even more of a difference than you imagine, especially as Simfoni will match every single penny you donate. So...... donate ¬£1 and Shelter will get ¬£2. What a deal!\n\nThe charity Refuge now has a greatly increased demand for its vital services. Between March 2022 and February 2023 Helpline advisers took 48,885 calls from women experiencing domestic abuse, 65% of whom were survivors. This was an increase of 17% over the previous period. Even with Home Office funding, there is still a big shortfall, so your support is badly needed. Opening a Just Giving page to collect donations would be a most useful way of support. It is a better way to connect and encourage donations. To set this up go to: https:/https://lnkd.in/euJuw8pH and then click the orange 'Start Fundraising' button. For example, ¬£185 could help fund the running of the Helpline for an hour. ¬£500 could run a refuge for one day. See what you can do by helping us to support them. Michael Saunders Chancellor and Secretary secretariat@nobleorderofkingsolomon.org\n\nOne of the hardest parts of giving is picking a charity to support. Wise givers want to find a charity that is making a difference in alignment with their values, one that operates as an effective organization and has a low risk of unintended consequences. Because finding a good charity is so hard, many store money in donor-advised funds and are slow to deploy those funds. A recent report revealed that $228 billion is currently in DAFs. That‚Äôs like winning the Powerball jackpot 2,590 times. Imagine the difference that money could make if it was strategically deployed? We're excited to announce the launch of Simple Charity Advising to help wise people give to causes they love. If you have funds in a DAF, foundation, or IRA that you are ready to grant, or if you just want help giving from your income, we would love to make charity simple for you. Learn more at charityadvising.org and schedule a FREE discovery call with us today. Know someone who could benefit from our service? Share the link with them and encourage them to do a discovery call. By doing so, you could help them make the positive impact they feel called to make.\n\nGood webinar with NCVO today about improving the diversity of charities‚Äô boards of trustees. It‚Äôs an issue that the charity sector must be one of the leads on. It touched upon the recruitment process and things like considering obstacles such as childcare for trustees. Too often the devil is in the details. This brought to mind my own progress in the charity sector since I retired. I was chuffed when first approached by 4 quite large charities over the past 2 years, but really disappointed by how the recruitment process was poorly handled. In three of those four I withdrew my declaration of interest simply because they were so bloody awful in keeping me informed of what was happening. If they can‚Äôt treat volunteers with respect, I thought, then they‚Äôre sadly not the kind of charity I want to join if it‚Äôs likely that I‚Äôm going straight into an uphill struggle with such attitudes. To charities that want to recruit and strengthen their board of trustees, please make sure your recruitment processes are in good working order."
