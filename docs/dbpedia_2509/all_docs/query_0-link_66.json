There is a more copious reference to the original authorities, though this is still too frequently withheld, and the statements thus deprived of all scientific value; and the references are in general to more trustworthy sources. There is also a sensible diminution in the number of glaring errors of the press, which have been so conspicuous a feature in earlier volumes. The compilation shows, as does everything from the hand of the same editor, unwearied industry; but with all that a lack of the power of distinguishing the worthless from the really valuable. Many of the paragraphs belong unquestionably to the former category, and it is difficult to see what purpose they serve except that of “padding.” On the other hahd some really important discoveries or applications of the year are altogether unnoticed. Considerable further improvement will be necessary before “Timbs's Year-book” becomes either an adequate or a trustworthy record of the scientific events of the year. The portrait of Dr. Carpenter given by way of frontispiece is exceedingly good. The Year-Book of Facts in Science and Art: exhibiting the most important discoveries and improvements of the past year in mechanics and the useful arts, &amp;c. By John Timbs. (London: Lockwood and Co., 1873.)",
