After its giant leap to number 1 last week, Fairground Attraction’s ‘Perfect’ settled into the spot and enjoyed a second week as the nation’s favourite. Underground’s ‘Underneath The Radar’ launched a challenge for the top spot as it moved up from 3 to 2 while Robert Palmer’s ‘Simply Irresistible’ was also in with a shout as it climbed 2 from 5 to 3 and this gave him his highest placing in the charts going past the peak of 4 which his previous hit ‘Addicted To Love’ managed. At this point the peaks for his 3 hits so far read 5, 4, 3 as his first hit, ‘Johnny And Mary’ had peaked at 5.

The climber of the week was The Primitive’s ‘Crash’ which moved up 7 from 24 to 17. There were 3 other star rater climbs this week and they were Matt Bianco’s ‘Wap Bam Boogie’ (up 6 from 16 to 10), Mandy Smith’s ‘Boys And Girls’ (up 6 from 22 to 16) and Men Without Hats’ ‘Pop Goes The World’ (up 4 from 30 to 26). It was a 5th star rater climb for ‘Pop Goes The World’ and it was the 7th song to manage this many. The Staccato’s ‘Cry To Me’ was the only one of those 7 to go on to have a 6th star rater climb. ‘Wap Bam Boogie’ was the climber inside the top 20 and ‘Crash’ and ‘Boys And Girls’ were the only new entries into the top 20.

The Pet Shop Boys picked up their 4th biggest faller award as ‘Heart’ dropped 7 from 11 to 18 to be the faller both within the top 20 and the top 30. They were sitting on 107 weeks and this set a new record for an act seeing their 4th faller award, just edging past the previous record of 106 which Modern Talking had held. The Pet Shop Boys record would not be beaten.

Erasure’s ‘Ship Of Fools’ and Tiffany’s ‘Could’ve Been’ were the 2 songs leaving the top 20. This meant that Climie Fisher’s ‘Love Changes Everything’ was the oldest in the top 20 for a second week as it ticked over to 21 weeks in that part of the chart.

There was a slight change in the oldest in the overall chart as Men Without Hats’ ‘Pop Goes The World’ was now on its own as the oldest, moving on to 27 weeks. It had shared the oldest title with Billy Ocean’s ‘Get Outta My Dreams, Get Into My Car’ for the past 6 weeks but the Billy Ocean hit was 1 of 3 songs leaving the top 30 this week. It had seen a run of 26 weeks and had topped the charts for 2 of those weeks. This brought an end to his SA Chart career with 6 songs and 108 weeks to his name. He managed 3 number 1’s, the other 2 being ‘Loverboy’ (11 weeks) and ‘When The Going Gets Tough, The Tough Get Going’ (6 weeks). His total of 19 weeks at 1 was the tied 3rd highest we would see, equalling The Sweet and sitting 2 behind Abba who managed 21 and 10 behind The Bee Gees who led the way with 29 weeks.

Also going was Midnight Oil’s ‘Beds Are Burning’ which managed 22 weeks and spent 5 weeks at 1. This would be their only SA chart hit.

Last of the leavers was Wet Wet Wet’s ‘Temptation’. It has seen 2 runs in the charts, the first being just 1 week at 29, then it re-entered the charts 5 weeks later at 27 and climbed to 23 the following week (last week) and this week it was gone with a total run of 3 weeks and a best peak of 23. They still had ‘Angel Eyes (Home And Away)’ in the charts.

With ‘Get Outta My Dreams, Get Into My Car’ and ‘Beds Are Burning’ both leaving the charts, we had the 27th time we saw 2 previous number 1 hits leave the chart in the same week. We had never seen more than 2 leave in a week and this would be the last time we would lose 2 chart toppers.

Our first new entry was by the second member of The Go-Go’s to have a solo hit. Belinda Carlisle had already seen 3 SA chart hits (including a number 1 with ‘Heaven Is A Place On Earth’) and this week her ex-band mate, Jane Wiedlin, joined her in having an SA chart hit as ‘Rush Hour’ was the first of the new entries. Apart from her music career, Wiedlin had also starred in a number of films, including playing the part of Joan of Arc in ‘Bill & Ted’s Excellent Adventure’. She had already released an eponymously titled debut solo album in 1985 which produced the minor hit, ‘Blue Kiss’ which peaked at 77 in the US. ‘Rush Hour’ would give her her only solo top 10 hit in the US to date where it went to number 9. It would also fare well in Canada (#13) and Ireland (#8). Locally it would see a peak of 3 on the Capital 604 charts and get to 5 on Radio 5.

Eric Carmen saw his 4th SA chart hit this week with ‘Make Me Lose Control’. The track followed up his success with ‘Hungry Eyes’, a hit from the film ‘Dirty Dancing’, but interestingly ‘Make Me Lose Control’ did not appear on any of his studio albums. Carmen co-wrote the song with Dean Pitchford who had already seen SA chart success having been involved in writing Irene Cara’s ‘Fame’, Kenny Loggins’ ‘Footloose’ and Bonnie Tyler’s ‘Holding Out For A Hero’. ‘Make Me Lose Control’ would go to 3 in the US, 2 in Canada, 8 in Australia, 29 in New Zealand and scrape a peak of 93 in the UK. It would top the Radio 702 charts, peak at 2 on Capital 604 and get to 6 on Radio 5.

The final new entry was a song called ‘Reach’ by Martini Ranch. The band consisted of Andrew Todd Rosenthal and actor Bill Paxton who had appeared in films such as ‘The Terminator’, ‘Aliens’ and ‘Titanic’. They recorded just 1 album, ‘Holy Cow’, which included the single ‘Reach’. The video for the song was directed by James Cameron who also directed ‘The Terminator’. The actor Judge Reinhold apparently recorded the whistling that can be heard on the track. The song does not appear to have charted in any other countries, but it did get to the top of the Capital 604 charts.

Last week we saw the hit count for the British acts catch up with that for the Americans, however as all 3 of the new entries this week were by Americans, they once again had the outright lead with a total of 855 to the Brits 852. Their weeks count difference was down to 45 with the American’s on 9,368 and the Brits on 9,323. This was the first time the gap had been less than 50 for 710 weeks (last seen on 7 February 1975).

Richard Jon Smith moved on to 83 weeks and this put him tied 4th on the local weeks count list where he shared the spot with The Staccatos. Meanwhile the Pet Shop Boys set a new record for featuring in the charts for consecutive weeks as they had now been seen for 56 straight weeks which moved them 1 past the previous record that Jennifer Rush had held. Climie Fisher had seen 2 in the top 20 for 10 straight weeks now and they were the 19th act to manage this. Only 1 more act would manage this.
