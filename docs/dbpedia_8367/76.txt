Climie Fisher were a British pop duo formed by vocalist Simon Climie and former Naked Eyes keyboardist Rob Fisher. In 1987â€“88, they had two international hit singles: "Rise to the Occasion" and "Love Changes (Everything)".

Simon Climie and Rob Fisher met at Abbey Road Studio, where they were both performing as session musicians. The duo is best known for the 1987 hit single "Love Changes (Everything)" which won an Ivor Novello Award. It reached number 2 in the UK and, on re-release, number 12 in New Zealand, 7 in Germany, 8 in Switzerland, 15 in Austria and 23 in the US, all in 1988. The hip hop-styled remix of "Rise to the Occasion" had also previously reached number 10 in the UK Singles Chart, and later reached number 1 in South Africa, number 6 in Belgium, number 14 in Germany, number 17 in Sweden and number 19 in Austria. Their last major hit single was "Love Like a River" in 1989, which reached number 18 in Austria, number 22 in the UK and number 54 in Germany. They wrote most of their own material together with Dennis Morgan, who Climie had previously worked with; and hired Steve Lillywhite and Stephen Hague as producers. Although their first album Everything charted in both the UK (number 14) and US (number 120), their second album Coming In for the Kill (UK number 45) was less successful and they split up shortly after its release.
