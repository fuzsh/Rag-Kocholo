        "text": "New wave pop is a genre of popular music that emerged in the late 1970s and early 1980s, characterized by its use of synthesizers, electronic drums, and catchy melodies. It was a reaction to the more serious and introspective music of the previous decade, and embraced a more upbeat and optimistic tone. Artists like Madonna and Duran Duran were at the forefront of this movement, which went on to influence pop music for decades to come."
