        "text": "From time to time I will be reviewing a release from my childhood or musical past that made an influence on me. Some of these will be well known, and others may have been passed by under the radar. Most will not be in the hard rock/metal genre, but may be on occasion. You can see reviews in that genre written by me in the Retro Review section on the webpage Sleazeroxx.com, or see more my published work at my online portfolio at llumleyportfolio.wordpress.com\n\nAl Denson’s music was a major backdrop in my musical and Christian journey, starting first in early high school when I attended a youth conference with friends from my little youth group at church (I attended a few different youth groups at the time, and this group had around twenty people including the college level members) when I heard a staff member at the convention sing “Be The One” by Denson’s second major album (you can read my review of that and a few other of his releases by typing in the search engine archives). From that day on, my one friend from the church and I would play his music in his car, to attend several of Denson’s live shows. The song “Be The One” got me to get more serious about faith and not just be a person showing up for church to play drums or hang with friends.\n\nDenson’s third release on the Benson label, “The Extra Mile” came off of the success of Be The One, which had a number one single off of it. I remember waiting weeks after the release of the album to get it- our local Christian music store did not have the title in yet – this was before the days of Amazon and WalMart. Christian bookstores only would order one or two copies of an album due that the price being higher than a normal album, say a bigger outlet like National Record Mart, which rarely covered the Christian market until the artist was high on the charts like Michael W. Smith or Amy Grant.\n\nUnlike the last album, The Extra Mile’s opening track “I Still Believe In Forever” was guitar-heavy with powerful 1980s /early 1990s thunderous drums, which was a departure from the keyboard-heavy pop sound Denson was known for. This solid opening track gave me more of a liking due to listening to the glam hard rock of the day as well, with bands like Stryper, Kiss, and Warrant in my cassette catalog. The addition of the organ in the song rounds out a full production sound that grabs the listener’s attention.\n\nThe ballad “I Choose To Follow You” (along with a few others from this release) was one of many songs I would purchase the performance vocal track for the church’s concert nights, during which my buddy would sing the songs. I was the drummer in the praise band, so I had my part to perform. He always loved singing so he would borrow my cassettes when he wanted to do something besides his favorite CCM act Steven Curtis Chapman. This song fitted him because the acoustic flavor is in the style of Chapman’s earlier work, with a folk style to it as well. The longest song on the album at 5:38 could have been trimmed a bit at the end, but still is a good worship-formatted song.\n\nAfter the lackluster “River Of Light,” which has the pop sound Denson usually created but is not as good as his other songs, the title track “The Extra Mile,” recreates the format of “Be The One.” The strong drum fills by Steve Brewster, along with Mark Baldwin’s guitar solo, give a power ballad feel for Christians. This song lyrically discusses being there for friends in need, either by physically being there or praying late at night, and should have been a bigger hit than it was being held up there with Michael W. Smith’s “Friends” in terms of success. Why it wasn’t no one knows. The live drum sound adds to the song with the power ballad production, as opposed to the programming sounds Denson used on many songs, which also gave a plus for me as a drummer at the time.\n\nThe chorus catchy “If We Believe,” details living the Christian life, where more action than talk is needed in living their ministry like it is their last days. Denson focused a lot on teen ministry with his books and music, but many of his songs, like this one, appealed to adults as well and encourages hope for those who may be wondering what is it all for.\n\nAnother #1 song for Al was “To Forgive,” which lyrically deals with giving second chances to those who hurt you and letting the past stay in the past. The music video was played several times at another youth group I attended, which was neat for me being a Denson fan because his music and videos weren’t played much at that church. This was another performance track I loaned to my friend for concert nights at the other church, as the success gave Denson a third #1 single off of three separate albums. Having that success consecutively should have made him a more well-known name in the CCM music market but it didn’t seem to click where he was always the opening act for someone, and later on his Take Me To The Cross promotions (you can again read that review in the archives) where I saw him playing a parking lot outside a Pittsburgh Pirates game.\n\nTwo pop sounding “The Love We Know,” written by Wayne Kirkpatrick (known for his work with Grant and Smith), and “Call Me” stay in the style of Denson’s keyboard pop sound, with “The Love We Know” being my least favorite song off the record and usually skip. I like the 1980s sound on most songs, but this New Wave-like song seems out of place with the rest of the record.\n\nTwo of my favorites are “Stand Up,” with a catchy chorus and focusing on the teen ministry where the topic of conforming to the world’s ideas via the papers, magazines, and television versus living a life beyond that takes the central theme. Strong female backing vocals, along with a deep voice at the end of the chorus may normally be cheesy, but it works here to give a distinct creative sound to the song that still is a great listen today.\n\n“Shine Out The Light,” his second #1 off the album, is another wonderful strong power ballad. The song was the national song for “See Ya At The Pole” even when the album was released (the liner notes state that). At the time, I had no idea what that event was because none of the schools or churches in our area did such a thing. It has now become a national event even in some public schools today. Again, not just for the teen audience (although targeted to it), adults can enjoy this track. Denson shines vocally in his ballads.\n\nThe last track was always a skip for me. “That’s What My Father Would Do” is a slow song with piano and strings. Even back then I enjoyed a rocker song to end an album to make me want to either re-listen to the record or go get another one from the audience. End and start strong. Not many acts, even in my opinion today, can end well on a ballad or stripped-down song. It’s a mixed blessing for me; either end strong or should an average slower song be at the end so it can be skipped without killing the flow of the record? The double-edged sword always is debatable to me. However, after years later discovering more of the artistic side of acts like Barry Manilow (who I discovered in college) and Air Supply, and currently Michael Bublé, I can now appreciate a mellower ending to albums.\n\nThe Extra Mile continues at times with the flow of Be The One, while adding ties to a guitar development for Denson’s work. This is my third favorite album of his (Be The One and Take Me To The Cross are above it for the song for song quality) and has many memories for me of my youth in Columbiana, Ohio. There are still songs on here I still listen to, and some that I would skip. Denson was, and always will be my favorite Christian music artist who gives much to like for his fans on this release.\n\nTrack List: 1. I Still Believe In Forever 2. I Choose To Follow 3. River Of Light 4. Extra Mile 5. If We Believe 6. To Forgive 7. The Love We Know 8. Call Me 9. Stand Up 10. Shine Out The Light 11. That’s What My Father Would Do\n\nFrom time to time I will be reviewing a release from my childhood or musical past that made an influence on me. Some of these will be well known, and others may have been passed by under the radar. Most will not be in the hard rock/metal genre. You can see reviews in that genre written by me in the Retro Review section on the webpage Sleazeroxx.com, or see all my published work at my online portfolio at llumleyportfolio.wordpress.com\n\nThe Christian music scene was somewhat a mixed bag when it came to getting mainstream attention by 1991. The hard rock band Stryper had a short run on MTV and mainstream radio in 1986 with “Calling On You” and the smash ballad “Honestly,” along with 1988’s “Always There For You,” although it didn’t create the buzz that “Honestly” provided.\n\nIn the pop world, Amy Grant was starting to gain steam after her single “Find A Way” moved to the pop charts in 1985 hitting on the Adult Contemporary charts. Grant then appeared on the duet with ex-Chicago member Peter Cetera on the #1 hit “The Next Time I Fall” from 1986. Before this, the Christian acts were deemed too cheesy for some mainstream listeners, with the bible themed verses with acts like Petra and the late singer Carman.\n\nGrant’s Heart In Motion release broke down the barrier in putting Christian acts on the pop charts and on a more frequent mainstream radio rotation, which helped acts like Michael W. Smith, and harder rock bands like P.O.D and Skillet years later. Grant’s album set off seven singles in both the Christian and pop world (she at the time had both a Christian label in Word and the mainstream A&M Records in her deal)\n\nThe album starts off with the reggae/dance groove of “Good For Me, ” which hit both the top ten on the AC and Hot 100 charts. Lyrically the song describes how opposites attract can work out in a relationship, using comparisons like one likes to drive fast and the other likes to take their time, brings a nice pop opener with a catchy chorus.\n\n“Baby Baby” was the song no one could escape that year, whether the listener was a Christian or not. This smash single, co-written by Grant and Keith Thomas, made her the first Christian act to have a #1 pop hit. This song was played all over church functions and skating rinks that normally wouldn’t play Christian music. There was also a backlash among die hard Christian music listeners with the music video that showed Amy with a male model, which many conservatives ranted about it not being her husband in the video (the same debate happened years earlier in my area with the Stryper videos). Some pointed to Grant as a “sell out” for not mentioning Christian themes in the song, and claiming it was “lusting after a man”, when the lyrics were really inspired by her daughter. Regardless, I wore out this cassette single at the time, and later the cassette of the whole album, due to this song. To this day, it still holds up as a nice catchy radio friendly single.\n\n“Every Heartbeat” continues the hit singles and flow of the record, which also ended up towards the top of the pop and AC charts. This has more of the style of Grant’s earlier Christian pop style to it, which would please the die-hard fans of her work. The song is still played on retro radio stations and during normal pop rotations in my area, which shows its longevity, and that good songs can last. The lyrics have a more Christian based tone without coming out and blatantly saying it, as opposed to a few other songs on the record, which also would please the early fans, mixing a fun chorus to sing along to.\n\n“That’s What Love Is For” was another song that kept the hit focus on the record, and was unavoidable in my church setting world as a teenager. Again, played at not only youth groups and concert nights, but also at our high school dances and heard both at Christian and Non-Christian nights at the local roller skating rink where I spent most of my weekends. Lyrically dealing with fighting through struggles in a relationship and having a positive message that love can bring light to dark times, was universal in theme and giving hope, regardless of spiritual beliefs. There is a nice guitar solo from Don Kirkpatrick which helps build the ballad throughout the song, bringing to a crescendo at the end, which is something I like about good ballads; starting off slow and then build to the end. There was a music video made for the song, and after watching it, I do not remember seeing it before.\n\nMy favorite deep cut on the album is “Ask Me,” which is more upfront with the Christian message. The song was written about a friend of Grant’s who had a past of abuse and dealing with the issues as an adult. The darker themed lyric wasn’t radio friendly, but there is still a positive message by the end of the song. This has a Peter Cetera sound to it. Since she had a duet with him , as mentioned earlier, it isn’t that far-fetched going into that artist avenue. The religious music fans knew of the strength of her voice, but some were first exposed to it from the duet with Cetera. This song is one that showcases her singing talent; it isn’t intense in range like a Martina McBride, but it is still underrated when mentioning great female singers of the time.\n\nThe first five songs on the album flow nicely, and then one of the weaker songs comes on with “Galileo.” An album rarely has every track perfect, so one can’t fault it here. Some people love the song, and although lyrically adding historical figures like Ben Franklin and Christopher Columbus is nice, the verses run right into the chorus without a buildup, which falls flat for me, although towards the end of the song, the chorus gets somewhat stronger.\n\nThe next song, “You’re Not Alone” turns the album more into a rock format, escaping the keyboard heavy pop sound. The direction changes here not only because of Grant not having a songwriting credit on the song, but it is written by Dennis Morgan and the duo of Climie/Fisher, who had the underrated “Love Changes Everything” 1987 single, along with Fisher being a member of Naked Eyes. Morgan and Climie also wrote the hit “I Knew You Were Waiting For Me” for George Michael and Aretha Franklin. This has a more mid 1980s flavor to the song, and is more guitar heavy.\n\n“Hats” continues the rock format in ways, adding a funk groove to it , along with a Cyndi Lauper flavor added in. A song about a woman juggling all different roles throughout her day, is still relevant today in topic.\n\n“I Will Remember You” was a another song that hit the charts in the U.S. and is more of a darker mid tempo sound, almost like something heard in the later part of the decade with alternative pop music. Another music video which I did not remember until seeing it for researching, the lyrics deal with moving on from a relationship (relative, sibling, ex lover?) , and was co-written by Gary Chapman, a Christian artist who later was known as a TV host on The Nashville Network. It took me a moment to remember the song once it played because I did not remember the track , even though it hit the Top 20 on singles charts.\n\n“How Can We See That Far” is probably the song to skip. The overlapping vocals distracts the listener and doesn’t hold up as some of the other songs.\n\nThe closer “Hope Set High” goes back to the Christian format in a worship setting. I like most albums to end on a strong note, usually with an up-tempo song. Many acts can’t make ballads work as a closer, but it does work here, after having to skip over the previous song. Since Grant had two labels, this song wasn’t released to pop radio (not surprisingly because it mentions Jesus in the lyrics) but was a #1 hit on the Christian circuit. This was another song that was played all over my world in attending church functions, with the simple mixture of keyboards and her vocals. Some of the songs on the album mentions “father” or “God” in regards to the Christian reference, but this one blatantly states Jesus, which should have brought joy to the ones who accused Grant in “selling out” or “abandoning” her faith for mainstream success.\n\nHeart In Motion was just released in an anniversary format to celebrate its 30th year, bringing the long out of print record back to the audiences. It’s surprising to hear that it was out of print, considering how much of a smash the singles and album were commercially received (it is now a double disc with outtakes and demos on the second disc). This is a monumental record that broke down the walls for Smith and Steven Curtis Chapman (who had success on country and AC charts as well) in getting Christian musicians out to a mainstream audience without having either cheesy lyrics or restricting the artists’ creative attempt to grow a bigger fan base. It also set Grant up as a solid pop artist, with her follow up albums House Of Love and Behind The Eyes continuing the top 40 U.S. hits. The album as a whole still holds up with infectious pop , radio friendly, sing-able songs 30 years after the release with solid vocals and songwriting that paved the way for other Christian music. It’s hard to overstate that if it wasn’t for Heart In Motion, there would not be Smith’s pop run, along with acts like Skillet, Casting Crowns, Rebecca St. James, or Lauren Daigle ‘s run on the charts. Amy Grant broke down the walls for the other acts to follow in this historical album.\n\nTrack List: 1. Good For Me 2. Baby Baby 3. Every Heartbeat 4. That’s What Love Is For 5. Ask Me 6. Galileo 7. You’re Not Alone 8. Hats 9. I Will Remember You 10. How Can We See That Far 11.Hope Set High\n\nFrom time to time I will be reviewing a release from my childhood or musical past that made an influence on me. Some of these will be well known, and others may have been passed by under the radar. Most will not be in the hard rock/metal genre. You can see reviews in that genre written by me in the Retro Review section on the webpage Sleazeroxx.com, or see all my published work at online portfolio at llumleyportfolio.wordpress.com\n\nThe 1990s was the best era for Christian Music in my opinion. Maybe it was because most of the music wasn’t too cheesy , or the fact that it was my era of music (among the many other styles) which made it more special to me. Perhaps it was that several Christian acts were gracing the pop charts, like Amy Grant, Rebecca St. James, Steven Curtis Chapman, and Michael W. Smith.\n\nSmith’s Go West Young Man was one of the cassettes me and my high school buddy would listen to constantly, along with Al Denson’s Be The One. We were working on the school’s journalism staff, where we had our own entertainment page, reviewing films, music, and other subjects. Even though Smith was a Christian artist, we had this album on constant rotation, without the other students or staff members being offended that we were playing Christian music.\n\nThe opening song features an introduction with horse galloping while a musical interlude starts before the pop song kicks in. Not really knowing what the horse had to do with the song (this was pre-internet so just looking it up wasn’t as easy as one would think), now it’s clear since the phrase “go west young man” was an reference to the Western expansion in history. The chorus states a religious tone where if Satan (or evil) is coming one direction, the Christian is to go the other way. The second verse mentions “following the crowd,” a theme that was one of the groundwork to Smith’s music in appealing to teens. This title track is a nice pop sounding opener that set the tone for most of the album.\n\n“Love Crusade” was a favorite of mine, and my co-writer on the paper. He was also an illusionist , and used the song for one of his tricks. Even though I was never a fan of most Rap, the rap part in this actually fits in the song well.\n\nThe smash hit “Place in This World” became an anthem to the Christian market, especially the teens. In one of his books, Smith wrote that he tried too hard on his previous album to reach the masses, and focused on just his core audience when working on this album. The album, due to this song, became a pop hit and brought those that normally didn’t listen to Christian music to buy this record. The video was seen on many major outlets, and is still played today on retro pop radio stations. Even though some Christians (which happened with Grant and Stryper), claimed “sell out” on this record, by not using the names Jesus and God upfront in the lyrics, this song has enough references in it to prove them wrong. (“If there are millions down on their knees/among the many, but can he still hear me?”) Regardless of whether or not there is a Christian take to these songs, this is a wonderful pop hit written by Smith , Grant, and collaborator Wayne Kirkpatrick, which hit #6 on the pop charts.\n\n“For You” is another song that got some airplay, including Smith appearing on late night television to perform it. This has a reggae/pop mix to it. I remember my one friend used to make fun of the song when I would play it, due to the line “Got a hole in your boat,” which he used to call the song “The boat song” when it was played at the Christian nights at the roller skating rink or at youth events. During this time, at my church, every so often there would be a concert night, where the whole service was filled with singing, either from different singers, the choir and praise band. This was one of the songs I ran out to buy the vocal track cassette . Me and a friend at the church would always talk about what songs would be good to use at the concerts. Since I was the drummer in the choir and praise band, I was more of his musical consultant , where even though I would buy a few of the cassettes, I would let him sing them (I was not comfortable with my vocal abilities). This is another reason why this album has many memories for me, especially spending time with my friend who was also a mentor to me.\n\n“How Long Will Be Too Long” was another song I had the vocal cassette. Although a longer song on the album, this had a more Christian /gospel style to the song. Even though the songs had a strong keyboard sound to it, some of the songs sound dated, but this one does not. This song could still be play at praise services with its message still being relevant. The B3 Hammond organ adds to the song. The length of the song, with it’s over one minute of ad libs from the choir didn’t resonate concert wise , which we found out at the church, due to lengthy no vocal part, which would work with a lesser run time. But it is still one of the better songs on the album that I still play today.\n\nThe next two songs “Seed To Sow,” and “Cross My Heart” are very late 1980s / early 1990s pop songs. Every Christian act in the 1990s it seemed have a calling to put something African based on their records. The chanting at the opening of “Seed To Sow,” with the African Children’s Choir was no different on this release. The verses are filled with too much stuff in it, but the catchy chorus saves the track. These are two songs I usually skip over, even today.\n\n“Emily” is one of my favorite songs by Smith. It was written by Kirkpatrick and was originally about his brother, who was trying to find where he was heading in life, according to one of Smith’s books (most thought the song was written for Smith’s daughter who is named Emily). He states that the song is about “the process of becoming,” and the theme of that the person is going through something, not at the end means. Again, the target of reaching teens is relevant here. This is another song that is still relevant today, regardless of age target.\n\nThe last vocal song, “Agnus Dei” is a staple in the Christian market, still being played in churches everywhere. The final track , titled “1990” is just a small musical part with Smith using the Bible verse from Mark 8:36 as his lyrics in a quick one minute ender.\n\nThe album put Smith on the map in terms of being a pop singer, which gave him a series of hits from the next few albums after the success here. It has many memories for me, and most of the songs still hold up today, where a few sound dated. However, historically it was one of the major albums that brought Christian acts into the pop charts which set the groundwork for even some of today’s acts that hit the charts like Skillet, MercyMe, and The Newsboys. Go West Young Man is one of the albums that should be listed in the Christian Hall Of Fame when it comes to groundbreaking works.\n\nTrack List: 1. Go West Young Man 2. Love Crusade 3. Place In This World 4. For You 5. How Long Will Be Too Long 6. Seed To Sow 7. Cross My Heart 8. Emily 9.Agnus Dei 10. 1990.\n\nCCM artist Al Denson was having a pretty good run on the Christian charts by 1994. He had several #1 hit singles, toured the world, and his ministry was striving. In December 1994, he was in a plane crash that not only killed the other pilot, but left Denson with over 500 stitches in his face, and multiple surgeries.\n\nIn the liner notes of his 1995 release Do You Know This Man? he states that it was time to just be closer to God and put aside the long work hours and tours. This release was overall a more different album than his other pure pop work.\n\nThe recording starts off with a normal Denson pop sounding track, entitled “All Around The World.” This fun song, with its catchy chorus is a great opening song, which I always enjoyed the line “We can be so heavenly minded/we ain’t no earthly good.” This is the Al Denson up tempo style tracks I like- live drum sounds and catchy choruses (there are time he focuses too much on drum programming).\n\nA mellower R&B style track follows with “Soul To Soul,” which looks at the differences between teens and older people. Even though there are differences, from clothing styles to music tastes, both are encouraged to help each other in the church and communities. There is a nice saxophone solo on here as well. This is a track that I use to compare Denson in ways to Barry Manilow, with his mellower style of music (which he is best at, especially his ballads).\n\nAnother adult contemporary track is the ballad “Pledge To Purity.”This duet with Tina Vallejo is the third song in a row that keeps a great flow on the record, with a more soulful sounding (like a Luther Vandross song), which Denson stretches his musical boundaries a little, but not alienating his core audience.\n\n“Church Of Love” is a southern gospel song, which I always tried to get our youth band to do when I played drums for my local church. This is a feel good song, full of positivity in encouraging all to stand united in the church and welcome those that come in with open arms.\n\nA lot of Denson’s ministry was geared towards teens , but his songs still had the strength to attract the older audience as well. I always loved his style on his ballads- his unique voice (again) makes me think of Barry Manilow, another person who had hits and had a different style of voice. “See Him” continues the pleasant ballad work with the lyrics dealing with praying that a friend (or another person) will turn to God. This has a similar style to his song “Peace Be Still” from his 1989 self titled album (you can read that review in the archives here) , which was a #1 hit. Denson did not have much writing credits on this album, but the choices he made mostly worked that many would not have known the difference.\n\nThe rest of the album is where I have mixed feelings about. The album to me starts to get a little darker in tone than in his other work, and from the first half of the album. I always found it interesting when I would critique Christian acts (and later on when I started this page) that I stand by the fact that not all Christian music is good. It is a business like any other, and although this is just opinion based on this page, I do not believe in the fact that just because a band is Christian , or on a Christian label, it means it is well done music.\n\nWith that said, the single off the album “Do You Know This Man” is a darker toned song, as opposed to something like his other songs like ” Shine Out The Light” and “See Ya At The Party.” Not that there isn’t a time for serious issues, but the rest of this release goes away from the first part-a tale of two sides. This track is a little heavier style (not as much as “I Still Believe in Forever” from The Extra Mile release, which I think is his harder edge sounding songs with strong guitars). There is a heavy percussion throughout this track and not a pop -oriented.\n\n“Stand On Love” starts to go back to the standard pop feel, but “Life on The Edge,” the Battle Hymn of The Republic influenced “One Nation Under God,” and “More To Love Than Meets The Eye” fall flat to me. “More to Love..” is not one of his better slower songs, and I think very few artists can end a record on a ballad (He did succeed with “Peace Be Still” and “No Love Lost” from previous records).\n\nJudging this release now is somewhat hard. I am a huge fan of Denson’s work (he is probably my favorite Christian pop male artist of all time), as I have stated many times on this page. He did just have a fight with his life with the plane crash at the time, and this release helped form his vastly underrated 1997 Take Me To The Cross release. This release, along with From This Day On, are my least played CDs of his collection, and even when I first purchased this record, I felt it had a darker theme to it overall. The best work on this release is the first half of the record, where the second part doesn’t hold up as well.\n\nTrack List: 1. All Around The World 2. Soul To Soul 3. Pledge To Purity 4. Church Of Love 5. See Him 6. Do You Know This Man? 7. Stand On Love 8. Life On The Edge 9. One Nation Under God 10. More To Love Than Meets The Eye\n\nAt one time I had most of Michael W. Smith’s releases and books (in fact I still have kept his books). Although some of his music became hit and miss for me after Go West Young Man, he still had a decent release on 1995’s I’ll Lead You Home.\n\nThis release was played many times at my church functions , in my hometown and in college. When I taught at a Christian school and worked at a Christian television channel, this CD was played all the time during my work days.\n\nThe first two tracks, “Cry For Love,” and “Breakdown” are not the best opening tracks, but was giving the listener the idea that Smith was heading into not only a more mature songwriting approach, but more vocal on social issues of the day, as opposed to the Go West Young Man and Change Your World releases, which stayed closely to the pop genre focused on teens and up lifting topics. His vocal style was more rap or talking with longer lines crammed into the verses, and “Breakdown” is filled with so much stuff, from a 3rd grade class reciting the Pledge of Allegiance to a Martin Luther King Jr. speech played throughout the song , that it is almost a collection of different recordings than of Smith’s original work.\n\nAfter the first two songs, the album really gets good with slower tracks ” As It Is In Heaven,” a remaking of The Lord’s Prayer (but builds throughout to a powerful ending) , and “Straight To The Heart,” a song dedicated to kids and staff at a camp. “Straight To The Heart” has the theme of togetherness and friendship, which has been a staple of Smith’s work in the past , with his keyboard heavy orchestrated ballads. Lines like “Over the years/I’ve learned one important thing/it’s that real friends/shall never truly be apart” may be simple but still strong in meaning. “Straight To The Heart” is one of his underrated songs in his catalog, and one of the best tracks on the album.\n\nThe middle section of this album is the strongest, with track after track being wonderfully done. Another one of my all time favorites by Smith is ” Someday,” with its country style guitar playing throughout, talking about social issues of the time, which even references the O.J. Simpson trial. Even though there is a few comments about events of the day, the song is not dated and still is relevant today, talking about harassment, rising taxes, gang wars, and questionable politicians. However, with all the bombardment that is attacking him in the song (tabloids and TV media as another example), he gives hope for waiting until he gets to Heaven where “peace will make a stand” and the “anger will fall away.”\n\n“I’ll Be Around” has an island feel to the song, again, discussing the theme of friendship and being there for one another. The song details a guy and girl who go off into the world, making mistakes but encouraged to come back, much like the Prodigal Son story in the Bible. The track isn’t preachy though, and even Non-Christians can like the song as that of friendship or someone close to them being there when times get rough, and forgiveness.\n\n“I’ll Lead You Home” is another ballad, with more of a throwback to his earlier all Christian work, without being dated or overtly preachy. This is the second song on the album with the “crying out” theme in the lyrics (“Cry For Love” being the first), which tends be odd at first, wondering why both songs are on the album. This one is the better track of the two with that theme.\n\nThe next section of songs, which is a trilogy, is where the album starts to slide. “The Other Side Of Me” starts off with strong orchestration and continues throughout the track, which ends with a longer instrumental part which would fit on a movie soundtrack. This first song is the best of the trilogy , with the lyrics about friendship or a relationship (wife etc) of two being one and one being lost without the other.\n\nPart Two, “Breathe In Me,” is not pop at all and emphasizes the experimental part of the release, full of orchestration. The song could have ended around the two and a half minute mark, but continues for another two plus minutes, which made me lose interest.\n\n“Angels Unaware” close the three part section, and is more of a Gospel song, where drums actually come in, as opposed to the other two songs. Like the earlier tracks on the album, the lyrics get run together and wordy, using words like “mental purgatory.” The ending is the nice part when his daughter Whitney sings a part, while Smith sings another, with Smith singing about “leading you home,” that makes the listener almost think this is a concept album at times.\n\nIf the album ended with the trilogy (although not a major fan of the trilogy), the album would be alright. However, There are four more songs, which makes a lengthy 14 tracks. “Calling Heaven” (a song that gets back to an up tempo feel), “A Little Stronger Everyday” (another 90s country style format), “Crown Him With Many Crowns” (with guest vocalists Anointed) and “I’m Waiting For You” could all have been left off the album and can easily (and for me quite often) skipped.\n\nThe overall album is a mix of pop, country, and movie soundtrack, which starts a turn of Smith to a more mature, adult contemporary artist than his past work, especially coming off of two albums with songs that had crossover appeal. At a lengthy run time of almost an hour, and the last several songs being weaker than the middle section which is really strong, the album is average at times, but when it shines, it really glows. This can be one of the albums that Smith starts to focus more on deeper social issues and an early path to the many worship albums he has produced in the past years. The middle is still the best part of this album.\n\nTrack List: 1. Cry For Love 2. Breakdown 3. As It Is In Heaven 4. Straight To The Heart 5. Someday 6. I’ll Be Around 7. I’ll Lead You Home Trilogy: 8. The Other Side Of Me 9.Breathe In Me 10. Angels Unaware 11.Calling Heaven 12. A Little Stronger Everyday 13.Crown Him With Many Crowns 14. Waiting For You\n\nFrom time to time I will be reviewing a release from my childhood or musical past that made an influence on me. Some of these will be well known, and others may have been passed by under the radar. Most will not be in the hard rock/metal genre. You can see reviews in that genre written by me in the Retro Review section on the webpage Sleazeroxx.com, or see all my published work at online portfolio at llumleyportfolio.wordpress.com\n\nIf you grew up listening to Christian music during the late 1980s into the mid 1990s, it was somewhat exciting musically. The success of Stryper, Amy Grant, and Michael W. Smith helped Christian artists reach the pop charts (along with Steven Curtis Chapman who branched out onto Country radio and video stations as well). Even though many in the church frowned on these acts branching their audiences, sometimes calling them “sell outs,” Christian music was getting recognized.\n\nOne of my favorite artists from any Christian era was Al Denson. I first heard his song “Be The One” at a church youth convention my buddy convinced me to go to, along with taking me to see him in concert, where he opened for Petra. Al came out with his keyboard and sang to his tracks, and in my opinion blew Petra off the stage, as opposed to the headliners who had a fancy light show and an arena rock stage format that didn’t impress me (although I like a good stage show). I also saw Denson years later after a baseball game in concert, and got to spend some time talking to him. I also collected the books he wrote throughout the years. Denson had a TBN show geared for youth when I worked for a branch of the Christian channel. His ministry was geared toward youth and teens, but it wasn’t too corny for adults. Denson didn’t look out of place with the youth, unlike acts like Carman, yet still found the right songs to record (or write) to resonate with many ages.\n\nTo me, Denson was similar to Barry Manilow in which he would have some pop songs with heavy keyboards, but then sang on wonderful ballads (where he really shined) with just him and a piano. Another great memory I have about Denson’s music is when I was in high school, I worked on the school newspaper. My best friend and I had our own entertainment page where we covered reviews of films, music, and other pop culture events. We were actually allowed to do reviews on Denson’s music (along with Michael W. Smith’s Go West Young Man) where looking back at it now, it says something that we were allowed to mention Christian music in a day when schools would shy away from that (even today).\n\n“I’ve Got Something To Say” is a great opener to the album, with its arena-like production, full of power and a sing along chorus. Throughout this album especially (and most of his work), Denson has strong keyboards throughout the track, including the nice solo here. This is a song that will get the listener in a great mood to start.\n\n“It’s One Thing To Say It” is a track lyrically encouraging people that actions speak louder than words. This is a faster song than the mid tempo opening track, and has more guitar on it. This is more of a song that would have appeared on his last album, his self titled release and his first for Benson (you can find that review by searching in the archives here).\n\nAlso at the time of this music craze, at least in my area churches, my friend and I were not only buying CDs, but getting the vocal cassettes to sing at concerts. The church I attended at this time, held concert nights every several months. My buddy (who took me to the shows) and I would go to the local Christian bookstore and browse through the tracks, trying to find something for him to sing (I was playing drums at the events, so my nights were already full without having to think of songs to sing, although I did do a few now and then).\n\n“Nothing Can Separate Us” is one of the tracks that I had the vocal cassette for. Even today when I read the Bible verses Romans 8:38 (which the song is taken from) I think of this song. Lyrically stating that nothing can separate man and God, this slower song is a pop great. The guitar fills towards the end of the track add flavor to the song, bringing a build to the end , along with Denson’s underrated vocals during the bridge of the song. This song, like a lot of the tracks, was in constant rotation on my cassette player, and my friend’s CD player.\n\n“Be The One,” as mentioned before, had a massive influence on my life. The song wonders who is going to the person to stand up and spread the message to the world-either friends, classmates, or other opportunities – in a world when people are confused about what’s right and wrong. This is one of the songs that has the Manilow ballad style to it (or in the Christian world, the Michael W. Smith songs of the decade). Denson has such a unique voice (much like Manilow, which is why I compare the two), and he really shows it on ballads and mid tempo tracks. This song became an anthem to many, hitting #1 on the Christian charts (Denson would go on to have many more #1 hits). The chorus changes at the end from asking “Who will be the one,” to “I will be the one,” which gives an added emphasis. Personally speaking, I used the track to audition for my high school musical ( via a dare, and was the only time I ever did tried out for a musical in a school setting), and got a singing part.\n\n“Tested By Fire” is a song more geared towards the teens lyrically, wondering if they are going to take what they learn in church and apply it to everyday life, like being back at school Monday mornings. This is a mellow ballad, without the strong production, and the drums sound better on this track, than the programmed drums that the other songs have.\n\nSide two kicks in with “Higher Call,” a song that is one of the weak ones on the album, although it’s not bad enough that one must skip. This has the 90s sounding heavy keyboard pop style. The verses are better than the chorus, which falls flat compared to his other work on the album.\n\n“Fall Into Place” is a fast moving song, with heavy drum programming throughout, and is a mix of pop and dance. The song gets you moving, and I am reminded of the track whenever I hear the story about Peter trying to walk on water, which the second verse details. The theme of hope is throughout this one, stating everything will fall into place if you keep going.\n\n“See Ya At The Party” was a track my friend and I would always debate over. He loved the song, and I thought it came off better live than on the album. My other complaint was the song has a bunch of people talking at the beginning of the track (they are at a party, so it fits), but the similar thing happens at the beginning of “Higher Call.” To me, one song had to go, instead of having two songs with similar openings. Denson co-wrote the song, along with a few others on the release. The theme of people (this track geared for the youth) inviting their pals and friends to the party in Heaven that will last forever, and encouraging them not to miss it. The song also showed that Christians who are usually labeled as lame can be cool, within the confines of their Biblical principles.\n\nThe last two songs on the album are slower songs. The ballad “No Love Lost” was another song I had the vocal track too. Backing vocals by Michele Wagner helps the song add an extra flavor throughout. This song is less pop and more like a Soul /R&B style and is one of Denson’s best song on the album. “Never Out Of His Love” is another singing track I had as well. This ender is almost six minutes long, which could have been shorter. The song ends with an one and a half minute musical section at the end, which drags on. Again, this shows the similarities of Manilow in his style of ballads.\n\nAfter all the years, this album is still worth the listen, although a few songs may sound dated. Let’s face it, some albums just show the time frame of when it was recorded. However, this pop gem is one of the best Christian albums in the genre, and still has greatness in it which shot Denson to becoming a Hall of Famer in his field. It is also one of albums in any music that had a major influence on me then and now.\n\nTrack list: 1. I’ve Got Something To Say 2. It’s One Thing To Say It 3. Nothing Can Separate Us 4. Be The One 5. Tested By Fire 6. Higher Call 7. Fall Into Place 8.See Ya At The Party 9. No Love Lost 10. Never Out Of His Love\n\nMany of my posts I write about music that influenced me as a child growing up. As a drummer in local bands in the Youngstown, Ohio area, I was exposed to many different types of music. I played jazz, country, rock, blues, and even some polkas. I listened to oldies and country when I got my first drum set, along with the Top 40 hits of the time. I have seen on Facebook recently challenges to list albums that influenced the person that they still have on rotation. Although there are many albums that have influenced me that are not one this list, such as Garth Brooks’ “No Fences,” Andy Gibb’s “Greatest Hits,” Huey Lewis and The News’ “Sports”, and Rick Nelson’s “Live At The Troubadour,” these are my top influential albums in my life that I still listen to today.\n\nRick Springfield ” Working Class Dog” (1981). This was the album that most people fell in love with Rick’s music, although it was his 5th album. I was introduced to him when my next door neighbors (all girls) and I would hang out after school at their house listening to their records. They were the first people I knew that got MTV, along with cable TV. They had a bunch of records, and I remember the first time hearing Foreigner’s “Waiting For A Girl Like You” over there. They would watch the TV Show “General Hospital” and be in awe of Dr. Noah Drake (Springfield’s character on the show). When Springfield broke out with “Jessie’s Girl,” everyone knew who he was. This album influenced me not only because he was an actor that put out great music (this will be a common theme throughout this post), but there is not a bad song on the whole album. I remember listening to the CD way into college, especially deeper songs such as “Daddy’s Pearl,” which was played constantly in my elementary days at school (I had a crush on one girl who was madly in love with him and just to play this song at school), but I always thought “Inside Silvia” was such a great written song. This album also introduced me to Sammy Hagar’s music with Rick’s cover of “I’ve Done Everything For You.” The album was one of my earliest introduction to an actor who could also rock out. To this day, I love this album especially with the great songwriting and catchy tunes.\n\nThe Oak Ridge Boys “Greatest Hits” (1980). It’s hard to pick one Oaks album that influenced me, more less choosing a “Greatest Hits” one, but this was the first record I got that was all mine, and not shared with my brother. It was also the first album I received (as a Christmas gift) along with my first drum set. I remember my parents putting the needle on the record and walking into the kitchen to get their breakfast tea, and by the time they walked back into the room, I was playing beat to beat along with the record, without hearing most of the songs before (I was around 7years old- call it “A God Thing”). I’m not sure how I wanted the album, maybe seeing the band on TV, but this album not only introduced me to the band, and my first memories of drumming, but it is still one of my go to albums to listen to orchestration and production on songs, along with studying vocals. I can’t say how many hours I spent in my childhood playing drums along to this album. To this day, The Oaks are one of my all time favorite music acts, and even though I upgraded it to CD, I still have the worn out record with the ripped cover, just for memories.\n\n“Grease The Original Soundtrack From The Motion Picture.” (1978) Once again, my childhood neighbors are the ones that introduced me to this album. I remember staring at the double album intensely when they showed it to me, and I fell in love with the music. “Grease” is also my all time favorite movies of all time, so much that I refused to even see it on stage or the remade “live” version on television from a few years ago. To me “Grease” is Olivia -Newton John, John Travolta, and Sha Na Na. Loving the 1950s music, especially in my early years, this album combined the early rock era songs with a Broadway play. I remember playing along with my neighbors, singing Danny’s parts as they took turns singing the female parts on the album. This influenced me as not only exposing me to vocal ranges, but also into (once again) actors being able to sing (and vice versa). The record, along with the hit “Islands In The Stream,” made me discover the Bee Gees, and Barry Gibb’s songwriting, who wrote the theme to the movie.\n\nAl Denson “Be The One” (1990) and Michael W. Smith “Go West Young Man” (1990) – TIE.\n\nChristian music was considered mainly cheesy growing up, with the exception of the Gospel sounds of The Oaks. It wasn’t until bands like Stryper came along that showed that Christians could rock out. I did not enjoy Stryper until later on, even though my buddies were huge fans. In 1990, two acts really inspired me with their albums.\n\nI saw Al Denson in concert opening for the band Petra, and in my opinion, he blew Petra off the stage and he only had a keyboard. After going to a church retreat that summer, I became more of an Al Denson fan with this album, with my buddy playing it constantly in the car all the way to and from the retreat, along with the theme of the retreat being “Be The One.” I even used the title track “Be The One” as my audition song when I tried out for my senior musical as a dare from one of my friends (I got a part in it). The same friend and I wrote for the school paper, covering the entertainment page, and we constantly raved about the songs on this album. Denson’s work helped me get serious about my religious views, and saw him several times in concert.\n\nMichael W. Smith’s “Go West” album gave him exposure to the pop world with his single “Place In This World.” To this day, it is one of the albums that doesn’t seem too dated to me from this era. Just like Denson’s release, songs from this album helped shaped me spiritually, including singing several of the songs on cassette soundtracks on church concert nights (back when vocal track cassettes were the rage, along with the Al Denson tracks). Songs like “Love Crusade” and “How Long Will Be Too Long” were also mentioned by my friend and I in the newspaper, and he even used the song during his magic act at one time. It’s hard to pick just one of these albums so that is why it’s a tie for helping me on my journey.\n\nBarry Manilow” Greatest Hits” (1978). My earliest exposure to Barry Manilow was listening to a couple 45s that my parents owned; one was “Memory/Heart of Steel” and the other was ” The Old Songs”/Don’t Fall In Love With Me.” When I was in college, I joined the BMG Music Club, and one of the first cassettes I got was this greatest hits package. I would listen to this album walking to and from classes, and once I got to actually see Manilow in concert, I proudly wore my T shirt as well on campus afterwards (most people didn’t know who he was, and thought it was Rod Stewart-college kids!!). Just like The Oak Ridge Boys, it’s hard to put in words the influence Manilow has had on me as a musician and a person. Most of my relatives like his music, so it ties us together, which is rare among parents, grandparents, and children. This release helped me through days in college when I was struggling with life, and his music also combines hope, good feelings, and reminiscing of younger days. This was the first full album I got of his, and made me want more and more of his catalog.\n\n6.The Bay City Rollers “Rock N’ Roll Love Letter” (1976) . Growing up in the 1970s-1980s, before cable television, kids would spend Saturday Mornings watching cartoons. One of the big shows in my youth was the “Sid and Marty Kroft” show, which due to the popularity of this band, was renamed “The Bay City Rollers Show.” The show featured childhood favorites like H.R. Pufnstuf, “Horror Hotel,” and footage of the band performing. The show was one of the first memories I remember of seeing a show with pyro, a huge lighted stage, and screaming girls throughout the songs. Singer Les McKeown was an underrated front man, and the production of the concert parts of the show was well done. This album in the U.S. combined two of their UK releases into one package. Even though they were teen idols, the music (to this day) is still good pop music. They wrote their own songs, and played their own instruments. I remember drumming and singing along to this album, and it influenced me not only drumming, but vocals as well. It also introduced me to different types of instruments, including acoustic work on the song “Eagles Fly” and the use of a voice box on “Wouldn’t You Like It” (I was not exposed to the use of it by artists Joe Walsh and Peter Frampton until decades later). This band was one of my early heroes in music, along with the Oaks, Andy Gibb, and David Cassidy. Although many think they were One Hit Wonders (which they weren’t), the band was a major influence on me, to the fact that years ago I purchased the two UK releases so I could combine them so I had all the songs from that U.S. release.\n\nKiss “Destroyer” (1976). There are many Kiss recordings that have influenced me. My early experiences with the band was when my cousin would play their music while we would visit them, and had Kiss posters all over his wall. I never got their music until the late 1980s when I became a huge fan of drummer Eric Carr. The first cassette I got of the band was “Destroyer,” which I found in a bargain bin at the local Fishers Big Wheel (which was like a K-Mart)in my hometown of Columbiana, Ohio. My friend and I would walk across town and browse the bin of cassettes. He would buy Rush tapes and I started collecting the Kiss ones. Although this is not my all time favorite release of the band, it was still my first purchase, which I drummed along with for many hours. The band was a major influence on me , especially since each member sang, played, and had an individual identity.\n\nJohn Schneider “Now Or Never” (1981). Another actor turned singer, John Schneider’s album was filled with Pop, Adult Contemporary, and Country songs. I actually like his cover of Elvis Presley’s “Now Or Never” more than other acts’ covers of Presley’s songs. The album also had songs written by Eric Carmen and Lionel Richie, which introduced me to those artists. Being a huge fan of the TV show “The Dukes of Hazzard” growing up, when I saw his record in the stores, I begged my parents to get it for me. I would sing and play along with the album many many times, and throughout the years, still listen to it. There are many good songs on it, and one of my favorites (to this day is) “No. 34 In Atlanta,” about the singer’s record isn’t charting well in the major markets, but he’s proud to play music his way.This was another early childhood memory for me, buying albums and spending my summers practicing my drumming.\n\nThe Blues Brothers “Briefcase Full Of Blues” (1978). Being a fan of acting and music growing up, I always watched comedy acts like Johnny Carson, Jackie Gleason, and “Saturday Night Live” (back when it was actually funny). One of my favorite acts on the show was The Blues Brothers. This album introduced me to blues music before I played in my first blues band in 1992. The great thing about this album was that not only did it have two of my favorite comedy actors in John Belushi and Dan Akroyd, but they took the act seriously that they went out and got some of the best blues players to be in the band. In my junior high years, I would wear a Blues Brothers T Shirt, and I played this cassette while playing drums. I also was a big fan of the movie, along with my brother and our friends. During school recess I would imitate Akroyd’s Elwood Blues by singing my version of the album’s cover of “Rubber Biscuit.” This was my earliest memory of blues music. Guitarist Matt “Guitar” Murphy recently passed away who plays on this album. This record is one of the all time best selling blues albums ever, and it is never mentioned when people discuss great blues records for some reason. This was the album that later helped my playing in later years playing in blues bands.\n\nThe Beach Boys “The Beach Boys” (1985). This, as mentioned many times on this page, was one of my favorite albums of the 1980s. I knew of the Beach Boys growing up, hearing their songs on the oldies radio channels, but this was the cassette that really got me into the band, thanks to the single “Getcha Back.” I remember seeing the band perform it on the TV show “Solid Gold,” which was a staple must watch show for me on Saturday Nights every week. The album was the first release after the death of drummer Dennis Wilson, but this album made me go back and re-discover their work, going to the Fisher’s Big Wheel and buying bargain bin cassettes of the band, from the many Capitol Records compilations that were put out (like “Your Summer Dreams,” and “Surf’s Up”). Even though the album driven by drum programming, there is still the big sound that made the songs fun to play along with. My summer days were filled with practicing my drum playing in the morning, then hanging out with my friends at the local pool, then riding bikes until dusk. This was an introduction to the band for me in the era where many of us were listening to Duran Duran and other pop acts.\n\n“Sha Na Na” Sha Na Na (1971). This act got their start as a comedy act at Columbia University and grew in popularity, that they ended up with their own television show that lasted from 1977-1981. The act opened for acts like The Grateful Dead, John Lennon, and Frank Zappa. They were also the act before Jimi Hendrix at Woodstock. The act was mainly remembered for the singer Jon “Bowzer” Bauman who had a deep voice and dressed like a greaser. However, one of the original guitar players was Henry Gross, who had the hit “Shannon” in 1976.\n\nThe reason this album influenced me was not only was I a huge fan of the television show, this album was another one of my very first albums. Side 1 was a live set recorded in 1971, and Side 2 was original work in the studio. This was the first record that I remember having a live side and recorded side (and this came out before Kiss “Alive 2” who used the concept as well). Side 1 had a great version of the hit “Tell Laura I Love Her,” which is my favorite version of the song (even better than the original). Side 2 had some great original songs mostly written by “Screamin’ “Scott Simon. The songs “Only One Song” (which is a Beatles like song) and “Canadian Money” are still songs I play often off the record. Years ago, I was excited to get a copy of this on CD ( a double album pack). The album , made me love the band and the cover arrangements,, while combining original work, which lead me to loving the “Grease” soundtrack and movie (they play Johnny Casino and The Gamblers in the movie and provide most of the second side of the album soundtrack, in fact Simon co wrote the song “Sandy” in the film). This band may have been seen as a novelty act in the 1970s, but the music was very underrated, and I still enjoy watching their work on YouTube from the past, including the TV show. This was a major album from my childhood, from enjoying oldies music with an updated feel to it.\n\nThere are many albums that I like, and have special memories of, but these are some of the major albums that influenced me as a person, drummer, and learning music in general. From childhood memories to practicing the artist’s on the albums, these are just a few of the ones that I remember. One great aspect of music is that it not only provides the listener with great songs, but lasting memories.\n\nIt wasn’t really until the 1990s when Christian Music was hitting the Mainstream Charts and selling millions of copies. Yes there were a few charted albums or songs in the 1980’s or before, but in my opinion, Christian Music was starting to be accepted by the music community in the 1990s. “Accepted” may not be the best of terms, because even during this time, several people in the Christian community denounced artists for “selling out” or were “on their way to Hell” because they were on the Pop Charts, which seems unheard of now, because churches cover Matt Redman, Chris Tomlin, and Mercy Me in their Praise Music on any Sunday Morning and they are on Billboard Charts.\n\nThe reason I mention this is because I decided to rank the Top Christian Albums, and most of mine choices came from the 1990s. In ranking these choices, I based it on a few qualifications: 1. The artist must be on a Christian Label (for example, someone may be a Christian, like Alice Cooper , The Oak Ridge Boys, or the last few W.A.S.P. CDs, but they are not on a Christian Label, ), 2. The choice is the full album throughout, not just having a few good songs (I like “Love, Liberty, Disco” by The Newsboys song, but not a fan of the whole album), 3. I am not using Greatest Hits, Live, or Movie Soundtracks, just full studio recordings 4. My personal preference, which may be based on music, or songwriting, or where I was personally when the album was released (not necessarily a major qualification, but hey, it’s my blog!!) Even though they are numbered, it does not mean that is the order. Any could be interchangeable.\n\nNow, here are my picks for Best Christian Albums:\n\n6. Guardian- “ Swing, Swang, Swung” ( 1994). This record was coming off one of the band’s popular albums, “Miracle Mile,” and had rotation on MTV at one time. The band toured with Styper and was known for their Metal and Hard Rock, until this album, which was a stripped down, acoustic album. Even though the album lost many die- hard fans, I enjoy this one the best of their CDs (I did not care for “Miracle Mile” or the later “Bottle Rocket.”) In the era where Unplugged Albums were starting to break in the mid to late 1990s, this is the Christian version of Unplugged. My favorites on the album are “See You in Heaven,” “Like The Sun,” which reminds me of The Beatles “Here Comes The Sun,” and “Come On Everyone.”\n\n5. Steven Curtis Chapman “Speechless” (1999). It is hard to have a Christian list without probably the top selling Artists in the genre. Chapman, Amy Grant, and Michael W. Smith dominated the Christian market in the late 1980s-1990s, and all three are still recording. There are many choices in Chapman’s catalog, but I think Speechless is the most solid throughout the whole album (His “Heaven in the Real World” is my second favorite, but there are a few weak songs on it). “Speechless” was probably his best album, with 7 of the 13 tracks went to #1 on the Christian Charts, and won a Grammy. I got to see Chapman in concert in Akron, Ohio, on my Birthday for this tour in 1999, and it is one of my favorite concert memories ever. My favorites include “Fingerprints of God,” “The Invitation,” “Whatever” and “Dive.” I would choose this CD as the starting point in introducing someone to Chapman’s music, even more so than his “Great Adventure” album.\n\n4. Rebecca St. James- “Transform” (2000). Even though many fans of St. James like her earlier albums “God” or “Pray,” this is her most solid work (Although her Self-Titled CD is just as solid as “Transform.”) This album has her signature song “Wait For Me,” which turned her into a spokeswoman and author for the female Christian voice. I enjoy the songs “Stand,” “Don’t Worry,” and the catchy “One,” which is similar to a Britney Spears type beat. This has the Pop and Ballad mix that flows through the album. I remember listening to this CD many times when I worked in Christian TV. Rebecca St. James became one of my top favorite Christian Artists, from her music, her books, her acting, and her concerts, which I saw her twice in 2004.\n\n3. Michael W. Smith -“Go West Young Man” (1990). Even Non-Christian Music fans, and those that never stepped into a church, was jamming to this album, which feature the pop hit “Place In This World,” which made Smith into a Pop singer, due to it hitting #6 on the Pop Charts. Another song, “For You,” was popular, but did not chart on the Pop Charts. Even though there was backlash from the Christian Community in regards to his popularity, Smith’s album brought more people to his shows and to following his work (His “I Will Be Here For You”, co-written by Diane Warren on his next album, gave him another Pop Hit). Personally, I remember playing this album all the time, and even was allowed to play it in my High School Journalism class, where my writing partner and I for the Entertainment Section of our school paper would praise the album constantly. Songs like “Love Crusade,” “Emily,” and “How Long Will Be Too Long” are some of my favorites on the album. It was this album, and Amy Grant’s “Heart in Motion,” brought more masses to have a respect for Christian Pop Music.\n\n2. Styper -“To Hell with the Devil” (1986). One of the first Christian Bands to ever to have their music video to have steady MTV rotation (at one time MTV showed music folks), Stryper was inescapable in the 1980s. With the Pop hit “Honestly” reaching on the Pop Charts, this album was popular and was seen in the record stores next to bands like Van Halen, Bon Jovi, and Poison. The band is still releasing great albums, and many choose earlier works like “Soldiers Under Command,” or “The Yellow and Black Attack,” over this album, but this is still my favorite. I was not a major fan of the band when they were popular, but I picked up ‘In God We Trust” (their next release after this one) in college when the band was split up, and went back into their works. Like Cinderella said “You Don’t Know What You’ve Got Til It’s Gone,” I became more of a fan of the band when I was tired of the music coming out in the Grunge era. I think this album flows the best of their work, with “Calling On You,” “Holding On,” and “Free.” This album was released in 1986, and became the top selling Christian Hard Rock/Metal album of all time until 2001, when P.O.D. beat it. That should say something about this album.\n\n1.Al Denson -“Be The One” ( 1990). This choice was not a tough one for me. There has not been a Christian Album that has made a bigger impact on my life than this one. A friend of mine took me to see the band Petra on their “Beyond Belief” tour in 1991 at the Akron Civic Theater. We were both blown away by the opening act (more than the headliners, who I was not impressed with at all), which was a guy and his keyboard. His name was Al Denson, and he had great songs, and kept the audience cheering the whole set. When the show was over, my friend ran to the merchandise table and had to buy this album. This album was also played a ton with my writing partner in high school journalism class, just like Michael W. Smith. Denson’s Title Song “Be The One” was sung at my first youth convention that I went to, played all through that weekend, was the song played when I became a Christian, and was the song I used to sing when auditioning for my first ever high school musical (my senior year, and I got the part). I still own the cassette tape of this album (and his others). Denson, years later, would be in my life when I worked in Christian Television when we played his TV Show. I have seen him in concert twice, in 1991, and again in 1998 when he played after a Pittsburgh Pirates game at Three Rivers Stadium, and own his books. The whole album flows with great Pop and Ballads, with songs like “Nothing Can Separate Us,” “Tested By Fire,” and “Never Out Of His Love.” It still amazes me that many people did not know of him in my circle of friends in the church at the time, and his still not as well known, even though he has 19 Top Ten and 11 #1 Hits in the Christian Charts, and was inducted into the Christian Music Hall of Fame in 2009. His 1995 “Take Me To The Cross” is another solid album, but “Be The One” is still my favorite.\n\nRegardless of your religious views, there is still some great Christian Music out there today. Artists like David Crowder, Chris Rice, Natalie Grant, and others are putting out music, along with established acts like The Oak Ridge Boys are putting out Gospel Records. Even though some may think my picks are dated, there are acts out there that are quality musicians. Maybe you will check out some of my picks. Feel free to contact me and give me your choices."
