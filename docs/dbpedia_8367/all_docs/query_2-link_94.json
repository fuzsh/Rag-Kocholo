        "text": "Today’s Pop Rescue from a fate unknown, is the 1992 debut solo album Soul Inspiration by singer, songwriter, producer, and one half of Climie Fisher duo, Simon Climie. Will this album soothe your soul, or will it simply lack Inspiration? Read on…\n\nThis 10 track CD opens gently with the percussion of titular track Soul Inspiration. Here, we’re swiftly met by Simon Climie and his soft and occasionally croaky vocals. He’s joined by tinkling piano which dances around his lyrics, as backing vocals help to add further warmth and layers to the song. The track was released as a single, but unfortunately it wasn’t a success, and fell at #60 on the UK singles chart. It’s a nice gentle opening to the album, and at times the vocals remind me of what Bros might have sounded like if they’d sung on a collaboration with 1990s Pet Shop Boys.\n\nThe tempo leaps up for Does Your Heart Still Break, which also stood as a single. Once again, Simon’s vocals are warm and gentle, and they fit perfectly alongside his backing singers. The track is loaded with guitars, which occasionally throw some well placed riffs in, as they brood on the songwriter’s leash. The single did not chart, which is unfortunately considering that it’s actually quite a nice up-beat pop song. The track is also the first of two tracks here co-produced with Stephen Hague (Dubstar, Climie Fisher, Banderas, Mel C).\n\nLove In The Right Hands is next, and this mellow track plays to the rich warmth of Simon’s vocals. The shuffling beat suits the more downbeat sound of this heartfelt song. The backing singers once again work perfectly alongside Simon’s voice, which again sounds a bit Matt Goss, but with tinges of Rod Stewart too. It’s a nice little track.\n\nSynth pads lead us into Dream With Me, and almost immediately a beat drops in, giving us a more up-tempo sound, which perhaps seems odd given that the song is about dreaming. Still, Simon’s vocals make light work of the track, and it flows perfectly as the synths and guitars duel in the background.\n\nThen it’s time for a reflective ballad in Oh How The Years Go By. A piano leads us in, lulling us into the thin ice of an X-Factor finalist debut single, but whilst it does stick around, Simon is underwritten by some nice synthpads and beats, which gives the track a bit more interest. The track builds nicely, and takes on a Christmas-feel to it at times. Present again, are the Matt Goss-isms at their strongest, with an occasionally growled vocal. The track does give Simon some bigger notes though in the mid-section, as the backing vocals and keyboards throw in an orchestral meets country music element. However, the track failed to chart when it was released as a single in the UK.\n\nSome piano chords drop us in to Don’t Give Up So Easy, almost teasing us with some Italio House vibes, but they fail to fully materialise and instead we get a nice bright song, laden with percussion and bass. Simon’s vocals flitter above them with great ease, giving a playful performance with some nice points to show off his vocal range. This may have been a stronger choice for single.\n\nWe’re on to Spell next, and the track is aptly brooding, with a bit of menace in Simon’s voice. It’s playfully delivered, giving him sone nice vocal moments, whilst flanked again by the lovely backing singers. The track also gives us a level of harder beats and bass, and some synths keep a feeling of foreboding going too – it works a treat.\n\nA burst of brass, and an almost dance track drops in for next track Don’t Waste Time (Make Your Move). This is a welcome sound, giving Simon a faster track and wider potential for showing off his vocals. There’s a really nice simple little synth riff too, which alongside the bass and piano work well. Simon’s vocals are flawless here, and it gives us what is probably the strongest track on the album so far. Why it wasn’t a single, is a mystery.\n\nLosing You is next, opening with almost a swaggering beach-side guitar sound. The track is a clear foot-tapper from early on, and the vocal harmonies are a joy to hear, as well as the soft backing vocals and plunging guitar chords. I’m left thinking a little of Sade at times, but Simon’s vocals own it perfectly.\n\nThe album closes with Life Goes On, which gives us another warm but uplifting track to close the album. Again, Simon gets to show off his vocal range, as well as the vocal harmonies alongside backing vocals and funky guitars. It’s a wonderful closing song, and a perfect choice to drift off with at the end of the album.\n\nVerdict\n\nOver all, this album is more than 50% of Climie Fisher, it is a fully fledged solo album from Simon that definitely deserves to have fared better.\n\nSimon’s soft vocals bring warmth on these expertly crafted tracks. Occasionally there’s some similarities between songs, and definitely with the mood, but amongst these are some really strong tracks too.\n\nHighlights for me were Losing You, Don’t Waste Time (Your Move), Does Your Heart Still Break, and Soul Inspiration, all of which deserved to be a single, and a successful one at that. The remainder of the tracks are really nice, but some lack a stand-out moment.\n\nOnce you’ve heard the Matt Goss style vocal, it’s hard to un-hear it, even though Simon was likely there first, but over all, this is a wonderful ‘soul inspired’ choice for your collection. Give it a spin!"
