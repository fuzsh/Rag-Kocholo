        "text": "Simon Climie was born in Fulham, England on 9 April 1960. By the time he was 17, he had played with a number of bands. After moving to London, he began playing sessions as a guitarist and keyboardist. Eventually, this evolved into singing and writing only, which led to a publishing deal with Chrysalis. In the mid-80s, his songs began to be covered by artists as diverse as Smokey Robinson, Jeff Beck, Roger Daltrey, Roberta Flack, Nick Lowe, Aretha Franklin, George Michael, Pat Benatar, and Rod Stewart. Simon has also worked with Kim Boyce, Tia Carrere, David Cassidy, Clay Crosse and Fiona. He enjoyed a period of chart success as one-half of the duo, Climie-Fisher.\n\nA chance meeting with Eric Clapton led to a discussion of writing together and ultimately, their collaboration on TDF / Retail Therapy. Simon has worked with Eric on Pilgrim, Riding With The King, Reptile, Me and Mr. Johnson, Back Home, The Road To Escondido and produced One More Car, One More Rider. Simon also produced the audio for the Cream reunion CD and DVDs."
