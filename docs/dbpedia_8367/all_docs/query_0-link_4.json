        "text": "London has contributed much to the history and development of popular music, from the British Rock revolution of the 1960s to the punk rock explosion of the 1970s to the underground electronic and dance sounds of recent years. The city is often cited as the birthplace of classic rock and the popular music industry. Several genres of rock and pop originated in London throughout the 1960s to the 1990s including British blues, psychedelia, mod, prog, glam, hard rock, punk rock, New Romantic and Britpop.[1] This page includes bands formed and based in London.[2] Below is a list of music artists and bands from London.
