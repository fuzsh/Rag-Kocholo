Augusto\n\nPromoted by Avalon. Bands: Darling Buds: Andrea Lewis, Harley Farr, Matt Gray, Chris McDonough, Jimmy Hughes; Failure: Ken Andrews, Greg Edwards, Robert Gauss. Reviewed Dec. 21, 1992.\n\nPale-tressed Andrea Lewis led the five-piece Darling Buds through an energetic and satisfying hourlong set of razor-sharp, guitar-driven rock that managed to bridge the gap between sweet pop melodies and angst-filled, punk-rooted shouts.\n\nThe Welsh band ended its U.S. tour with the Roxy at only half-capacity, but filled the room with wave after wave of tales of all that love is--finding it, keeping it, losing it.\n\nIn Madonna's world, erotica means something cold, calculated and emotionless. But on \"Erotica,\" the third album from Chaos/Columbia and Darling Buds, listeners learn, much to their relief, that eroticism is rooted in love, sadness, commitment, isolation and desire. Not so much blind ambition as blonde affection.\n\nThe punky \"Isolation,\" the obsessive \"Long Day in the Universe\" and \"Please Yourself,\" which sounded like British group Ride, were examples of the Darling Buds at their best. The dual fuzzy guitar attack of Harley Farr and new member Matt Gray kept most of the songs from being too syrupy.\n\nLewis' vocals weren't always perfect, but she does have stage flair and relates well to her audience.\n\nThe biggest weakness of the band is that, even in a short set, many of the songs begin to sound much too similar. Lewis, with all of her stage buoyancy, sometimes fails to deliver the heavy emotion required of the songs she sings.\n\nOpening act Failure certainly didn't live up to its name, instead offering a modestly engaging L.A. style of grunge (the band apparently prefers the term \"sludge\"), with \"Princess\" and \"Muffled Snaps\" being the best tunes played. The trio's Slash/Warner Bros. debut, \"Comfort,\" is a promising effort, as is the group's minimalist, Nirvana-inspired stage show. Musically, the sound and songwriting are very one-track and lack variety.\n\nBut given time -- and the continued popularity of the group's sound -- they could very well find themselves on a future Lollapalooza bill.\n\nDarling Buds rise to the occasion, bury Mary's Danish - The Boston Globe November 27, 1992 by Jim Sullivan, Globe Staff\n\nMARY'S DANISH and DARLING BUDS At: The Paradise, with Failure, Wednesday night.\n\nAt the risk of sowing the seeds of terminal discontent during just the second week of this joint Darling Buds/Mary's Danish venture - which stopped at the Paradise for a soldout show Wednesday night - we're going to declare Wales' Darling Buds one of the coolest noise/pop-rock bands of 1992 and Los Angeles' Mary's Danish one of the most predictable and pedantic.\n\nLet the chips fall where they may.\n\nThe night-closing Mary's Danish has scored the bigger alternative-rock hit with \"Leave It Alone,\" a bratty, punkish song that ranks in the A-1 realm of kiss-off punk/love songs via its terse intro: \"Don't care what you say/Don't care what you do/Don't care what you love/Don't care care where you go/Don't care where you live,\" and its subsequent reiteration and angry, wrenching guitar skronk follow-up hook. Killer stuff. But the Darling Buds have roamed a more consistently inclusive, expansive, and catchy turf - one that it is as melodically inviting and psychedelically invigorating as it is lyrically agitated.\n\nSo: The Buds soared and the Mary's downed.\n\nSo it goes.\n\nThere was a great couplet sung by the Buds' Andrea Lewis in \"Please Yourself:\" \"Once I wished I was a boy/Very soon, I changed my mind . . . I don't mind.\" This was set to a gliding, bittersweet melodic line. The effervescent Lewis - looking like a mid-'60s \"Blowup\" girl, or Valerie Perrine - later sang about a knife sinking into her heart, but delivered the tragic line with post-punk panache, coming back with a smile.\n\nThe Darling Buds lovingly plundered guitar riffs from Tommy James & the Shondells (\"Crimson & Clover\") and Neil Young (\"Cinnamon Girl\"), while still appearing fresh and raw with \"It Makes No Difference,\" \"If I Said,\" \"Please Yourself\" and others. Their Wednesday set proved to be a near-perfect meeting ground of the Jesus & Mary Chain and ABBA, a place where sweet and sour cannily collided, making peace.\n\nFor the Buds, it was a far better showing than they delivered in 1990 at Nightstage: The passion, pop and punch all joined hands and rocked out in 1992. \"We're not the flavor of the month,\" said the Buds' Lewis, backstage, after their set, and about their third album, the one that's titled \"Erotica,\" the same as Madonna's. \"We're into Erotica as much as when we started. We just think music is really sensual. It's not just a picture, or a vice, or a positive thing. You should see our pictures.\"\n\nMary's Danish, a sextet fronted by singer-songwriter-guitarists Julie Ritter and Gretchen Seager, fell short of Wednesday night's apotheosis, stumbling into generic Led Zep mannerisms - a lumbering sound cut with country-rock maneuverings. Their late-set rendition of \"Leave It Alone\" boasted a flourish of fiery punk anger; yet it was overwhelmed by a surfeit of slow-moving, hard-rock riffing.\n\nAnd that's the way the hour-plus set, with most songs drawn from the Danish's third \"American Standard\" album, evolved: Slow-crawling, bluesy, hard, punk rockers imbued with lyrical introspection and decent, countryish, female-fronted vocal leads and harmonies. Good enough, generically, to sustain a buzz, but not great enough to rise above that fray.\n\nFailure, a Nirvanaesque trio, opened the night by mashing together heavy bass lines, damaged vocals and fragmented guitar lines into a way-too familiar sound and style.\n\nDarling Buds of Mayhem - Lime Lizard Magazine September, 1992 Interview by Mark Sutherland\n\nNo video with the flexi we're afraid but here's a few mental images to be going on with: Paul Schofield and a sheep, Harley breast tweaking fat naked ladies and Mark Sutherland engaged in under water coitus with Vanessa Paradis. Yes, The Darling Buds are back.\n\nIf ever there was a band perfect for a time it was The Darling Buds. In happy days of the late 80s their music fizzed like a fresh bottle of Tizer, the nation swooned and they appeared everywhere from the cover of Melody Maker to Saturday morning TV. They symbolised the first days of the indie crossover, when entering the charts was a novelty not a necessity and seeing the Buds on Ghost Train was more shocking than plugging yourself into the national grid. And a lot more fun. Days long before crass commercialism mugged the independent aesthetic, when just hearing 'Burst' of 'Shame On You' on the radio could make your whole day.\n\nAfter the glorious debut, the Buds' second album was the sound of a particularly excellent party being gatecrashed by a gang of surly Mancunians and turning rather sour. The odd song like 'Crystal Clear' was still so heartrendingly magnificent I had to bite my lip to stop my head from spinning but the times had changed and nothing would ever be quite the same. If anyone should be yesterday's papers it's The Darling Buds.\n\nSo how come at least half their new album makes me want to skip like a ten year old let out of school early? How come 'Sure Thing' and 'If' make me grin like a Cheshire cat on Ecstasy? How come 'Wave' and 'Isolation' are more fun than underwater sex with Vanessa Paradis? How come 'Erotica' as a whole makes me want to shin up Nelson's Column and proclaim loudly to the world that I think The Darling Buds are pretty darn marvellous?\n\nThe world won't listen, of course. No, the world will spit and snipe and snigger and slouch off to listen to Pearl Jam or Iron Maiden or whatever old toss is being served up as cool this week. The world's like that sometimes. It can be a right bastard.\n\nMention you're interviewing The Darling Buds and people will ask you two things \"Are they still going?\" and \"What label are they on now?\" and I'll say \"Yes\" and \"Still on Epic\" and reserved for harmless but bewildering eccentrics.\n\nBut I arrive in Newport to find Andrea (vocals) and Harley (guitars) in fine spirits and getting the beers in and willing to talk about anything from Catherine Zeta Jones to those glory days.\n\n\"We never really realised we were famous at the time cos it goes by so fast. We were gigging all the time, going places and doing things before you know it two years have gone by,\" says Harley.\n\n\"I'm just glad my mum and dad have got it all on video,\" adds Andrea.\n\nSo, did it all go horribly wrong?\n\n\"To a certain extend, yes it did.\"\n\nIn 1992 there's a lot more to the Buds than the hop, skip and jump of 'Pop Said'. Andrea's voice is much stronger now and a tougher, more abrasive guitar sound runs riot over 'Erotica'. Almost the Darling Buds of Mayhem, in fact.\n\n\"I think we've always been like that really. We were left alone for this album so we did what we wanted. We're much harder live, we're still quite poppy but there's lots of rough edges. We were never just a pop group,\" says Andrea.\n\n\"Well, pop means popular so we're definitely not one now!\" laughs Harley.\n\nDoubtless there will be those who cry Noisy Guitar Bandwagon when they hear some of the Bud's new stuff, but today's groups have reason to be grateful to the DBs.\n\n\"I think we did change things in a way. We did get in the charts, on telly, on kids' programmes when no one else could. Lots of bands do that now and it's no big deal,\" says Andrea.\n\n\"We'd go on these programmes and the boys would be so rude and jump around and then it would be 'Camera on' and we'd go back to licking lollipops.\"\n\n\"I told Philip Schofield that shagging a sheep over the edge of a cliff was better because they push back. He was quite amused I think,\" claims Harley.\n\nBut the 'benefits' of fame don't seem to mean much to the Buds; it's the music that matters.\n\n\"In a band you don't know what's going to happen, you're taking a risk. When I gave up my job for the band everyone told me I was an idiot but it was in me, I had to do it. One guy was leaving the same day to play professional cricket and they said to him 'Great, if you ever need to come back we'll find a place for you.' He's selling cars now, finding life difficult. I don't find life difficult cos I'm still making that decision, making my life turn around. I'm still here drinking,\" says Harley.\n\nGood point. The lager's flowing and things are getting frivolous, a process that will end in missed trains, Bryan Adams covers and hangovers. But that's another story. Instead, let's explore the Buds' idea of erotica.\n\n\"People always have their own perception on it. Matt, our new guitarist, sees it as a medical term, but I think of it as classical Rubenesque paintings,\" says Andrea.\n\n\"Fat naked ladies, that's what it was in those days. With small breasts and someone always tweaking them,\" smirks Harley.\n\nAndrea regards her cohort disparagingly. \"Now I know what job you'd have gone for in the 17th century; breast tweaker at the back.\"\n\n\"No, music is erotic though. Do you get songs that are so good they make you shiver?\" asks Harley.\n\nOh God yes. Why else would I be writing about music?\n\n\"Exactly, I mean, how many times has sex made your back tingle? Never for me. Music does it all the time.\"\n\nHas the tingle gone out of pop? There's a PhD thesis in there somewhere, but in the meantime The Darling Buds are trying their damndest to put it back. In full bloom.\n\nSure Thing review - Melody Maker August 29, 1992 by Mark and Derry from EMF\n\nMark: Nice song. Predictable chord changes, but nice.\n\nDerry: I was never really into these blonde bands. The Primitives were a bit more thrashy, though. But this isn't really going to stick its head up, not with what's going on in music at the moment. It's not going to get anyone's attention.\n\nMark: But I don't think they should necessarily give up.\n\nDerry: That's what you want us to say, isn't it? Andrea Darling Buds should go and work in a bank. But we're not going to.\n\nDarling Buds from Wales are coming into bloom - The Associated Press, February 8, 1991 by Mary Campbell\n\nWhen the Darling Buds got together in Wales, what similar pop bands were around?\n\nNone, say the Darling Buds.\n\nSinger Andrea Lewis and guitarist Harley Farr had started writing songs together. She saw a newspaper ad for musicians to play local gigs; she phoned, and bassist Chris McDonagh answered. It was the only call he had.\n\nThe quartet, which has released its second Columbia Records album, \"Crawdaddy,\" is from Caerleon, near Newport in the south of Wales. Jimmy Hughes, who replaced the original drummer, is from Liverpool.\n\nLewis says that soon after playing a few times in Newport, \"I moved to London, and Harley went abroad with a different band. At Christmas time we all got back. Chris got in touch: Would we do a gig again? We rehearsed a couple of days, did the gig.\n\n\"Harley was right into it. He decided a little recording we had done should be released on vinyl. We did that. We sent it to John Peel, a radio person on BBC Radio One. He loved it and played it right away.\"\n\nPeel invited them to play something well known in Britain as a \"Peel session.\" Lewis says, \"You go in and perform and they broadcast it.\" Farr says, \"It was all go from there.\"\n\nWhen they started, says Farr, \"We had hundreds of gigs. We played all the time, all over the country, traveling places to play, losing money.\"\n\nThose dues-paying, fan-building days are recent enough to be strong in memory.\n\nThe street band Farr had been with had a van. He bought it from them for the Darling Buds. \"It was permanently breaking down,\" Farr says. \"We had to push it several times.\"\n\n\"It broke down on our way to Newcastle,\" Lewis says. \"We sat in a service station. We knew the band we were playing with was called Culture Shock. We didn't know them.\n\n\"We were feeling miserably sorry for ourselves. A group of people walked in. It was Culture Shock. We said, 'We're supporting you.' They said, 'You can all get in our van.' We actually made the gig. We thought we'd miss it.\"\n\nAfter the second Peel session in September 1987, Native Records signed the Darling Buds.\n\n\"Just before Christmas, we went into the studio,\" Lewis says. \"We recorded six songs in four days. About March 1988, the first single of that session came out, 'Shame on You.' It got into the Top 5 of independent charts in Britain and started to do very well on some European radio stations as well. We released the second single then, 'It's All Up to You.' That got to No. 1 in a few charts, Sweden and Spain. Melody Maker put us on the front cover.\n\n\"It was like our second single busted everything for us. John Peel carried on playing us. We did an all-night festival in Spain, went on at 5 in the morning. It was still packed. They were going for it. We walked off stage and it's like dawn.\"\n\nWhen they got back to England, they found their record distribution company was out of business. \"A lot of independent bands had unreleased material,\" Lewis says. \"We were in the fortunate position there were major companies interested in us. We wanted to stay independent at the time, to keep more control. We probably wouldn't have released anything for months.\n\n\"We finally decided to go with Columbia in the summer of 1988 and went straight into the studio to start our first album.\" Everything on that album, \"Pop Said,\" was new except \"Shame on You.\"\n\nThey feel that their music now is of higher quality than \"pop\" implies and that it's still improving.\n\nAt that time, Farr says, \"We were all skint, penniless. Because we enjoyed doing it, we carried on doing it.\"\n\n\"We were borrowing money,\" says Lewis. \"We would prefer to do the gig and lose money. We'd drive, get 50 quid for petrol somehow.\"\n\n\"We had lots of T-shirts done,\" says Farr. \"Andrea used to go around with a box with T-shirts, records and badges, like ice cream ladies in movie theaters, to get our money home.\"\n\nIt was fun, Lewis says. \"It was hard work,\" declares Farr. \"Even now, I could get more money with a 9-to-5 job somewhere.\"\n\nMcDonagh, who has a degree in applied statistics, was earning more before, as a computer programmer.\n\nFarr's parents were schoolteachers. \"They thought education was the most important thing in the world,\" he says. \"They weren't too keen to start with.\"\n\n\"They're dead keen now,\" Lewis adds.\n\nThe band's idea when they started was that a guitar should sound like a guitar, Farr says. They did the songs that he and Lewis wrote, with only one non-Buds song a night. \"Love Me Tender\" was a favorite of the fans, Lewis says.\n\nTheir name comes from \"darling buds of May,\" which they later learned is in a Shakespeare sonnet. They knew it was the title of a book. \"The book is about a family enjoying everything in life,\" Farr says. \"I thought it summed up what we were doing. The music was happy and bouncy, enjoying everything.\"\n\nFarr says they listened to a lot of 1960s music. Lewis adds: \"I think we modernized it. It doesn't sound like it stepped out of the '60s. It's got our own label on it.\" Farr adds that he started buying records in the punk rock era and was inspired by that, too. \"We just plug our guitars in and play.\" Farr says. \"We don't sit and analyze it.\"\n\nCrawdaddy: The Darling Buds on Columbia Records, The Tech, MIT, January 23, 1991 by Sande Chen\n\nALTHOUGH THEY HAVE had little impact in England, the darling buds have caused quite a stir here in the States. Their second album, Crawdaddy, with singles \"Crystal Clear,\" \"Tiny Machine\" and \"It Makes No Difference,\" has garnered considerable success, showcasing their particular brand of cloying light pop music.\n\nThe young band attributes their newfound success to past experiences. Guitarist Harley Farr explained in a recent interview on a New York radio station, \"After recording the first album, we sort of saw the mistakes that we'd made. We knew what we wanted to do. With the first album, it was all drum machine. The drums were put down, and then Chris would put the bass down, and then I'd go in and I'd record my guitar through a Walkman and all the guitar sounds were exactly the same, and then Andrea would sing the vocals, so everything was sort of too det det det det det det....\n\n\"There was no feeling, no emotion. It was all done very quickly, and we thought when we come to record the next album, we'd try to take a better time out. For start, we'd play it live, because we're basically a live band, and we'd try to get more emotion, we'll use some more variation on the instruments, and things like that. In a way, it was a progression. I wouldn't call it maturity, just a progression. I suppose, yeah, if we did the second album exactly the same, we would have died.\"\n\nIndeed, from the beginning guitar riffs of \"it makes no difference \" to the last verse of \"the end of the beginning,\" this is a well-executed album. It is complete in the sense that the band succeeded in what they set out to do. However, there could have been more exploration. They sound like the Primitives.\n\n\"Crystal Clear,\" \"It Makes No Difference,\" and \"Honeysuckle\" deserve attention. \"So Close\" carefully avoids the seraphic birdsong arias that have plagued other female vocalists (witness Lush); instead, it is tender and touching, full of emotion. The only slight disappointment is \"You Won't Make Me Die,\" which begins to waver in the direction of inspiring drivel a la Tiffany, but even that isn't so frightful. The other songs on the album are also worth noting.\n\nWith such a welcome start, no doubt the darling buds will continue to progress to bigger and brighter avenues.\n\nCopyright 1991 by The Tech.

They exhibited more than a few common traits of numerous, so-called \"baby bands\" - in sum, they're not quite there.\n\nThe Darling Buds' hour-long set was often tentative (from presentation to between-song chat), and while their pure pop pleasures were in evidence, they were muted. That is, what was full of defiance and verve, bursting with sparkling hooks in the studio - aided ably on \"Crawdaddy\" by producer Stephen Street - was just partially there in concert. The Buds still had the defiance, some of the verve and all of the hooks - but their attack had little of the body, edge, expansiveness and psychedelic splashiness of their recorded work. It seemed tame and overly formal, yet perhaps not entirely their fault.\n\nLewis' voice was, to borrow a title from one of their better songs, crystal clear, but the quintet's volume was toned down. Moreover, the Buds were faced with the dilemma of how to compensate for the alluring, lush, high vocal harmonies rendered in the studio - courtesy of a multi-tracked Lewis - in a live setting. Guitarist Harley Farr tried at times, but the whole thing couldn't help sound thin. Their concert recalled the old Deborah Harry-and-Blondie conundrum, though Lewis was on-key much more than Harry usually was. Both Harry and Lewis need backing vocals in concert.\n\nThis set wasn't dreadful, just disappointing in comparison to their recorded music. An attractive blonde in black, Lewis spins an entrancing weave: part come-on, part kiss-off. She'll \"Catch You When You Fall\"; she'll wonder why you keep breaking her heart; she'll be \"falling and laughing . . . till I hit the ground\"; she'll declare that \"You Won't Make Me Die\"; and, ultimately, decide \"It Makes No Difference,\" sighing over and over that she \"feels nothing.\" This, mind you, was all within the context of wondrous pop songcraft and rendered during the first half of the set. But the romantic-smart stance wasn't matched by the musical muscle.\n\nThe semi-breakthrough came near the end when New Order's \"Temptation\" flowed out of the Buds' \"Take My Breath Away.\" Here, Lewis let rip with the delayed chorus - \"Up, down, turn around/Please don't let me hit the ground/Tonight I think I'll walk alone/I'll find my soul as I go home!\" - and the introspective musicians found a grungier groove and wilder mode. They carried that a bit further on their own, but exited and left you wanting more. Not more songs, exactly, but a more realized concept of flesh-and-blood passion.\n\nThe New York band 9 Ways to Sunday opened with a mixed bag of low-key tricks. They, too, were soft and muted, but their languid, gently buzzing, Eno-esque guitar lines were more suited to the sound. They covered Roxy Music's \"Mother of Pearl,\" and endured a catcall of \"How dare you?!\" from one punk. They dared and succeeded, stripping the song of Bryan Ferry's cabaret attitude, scrambling verses, and building on the nervousness and the rhythmic groove. The band tailed off toward the end, but their subtle, hypnotic sound had promise.\n\nThe Darling Buds blossom in their second album - The Boston Globe December 1, 1990 by Jim Sullivan, Globe Staff\n\nDon't pity the Darling Buds. They've got a stunning second album out now called \"Crawdaddy,\" and it's a delightful slab of punk-pop-psychedelia that pushes all the right buttons. They're on the eve of their first American tour, which touches down at Nightstage in Cambridge Monday night. Their producer, Stephen Street (also the producer of the Smiths and Morrissey) makes noises about them like this: \"They manage to be dirty but sexy and sleek at the same time. Singer Andrea Lewis and guitarist Harley Farr are destined to become the Chris Stein and Debbie Harry of the '90s!\"\n\nNice.\n\nBut the Darling Buds almost got lost in the dirty old pop shuffle. Back in 1988, the Buds made \"Pop Said . . .,\" one of the most acclaimed debut albums of the year - at least in their native England - and were readying to embark upon an American tour. Then . . . disaster . . .fallout.\n\n\"We meant to come over quite a few times in the past,\" says Lewis, on the phone from San Francisco, \"but we had a different management company that was really dreadful. And every time they came over to America to set up a tour they just got drunk all the time and didn't organize anything for us, even though we had people on the phone saying 'Oh do what you can - we just want to see the band!'\"\n\nInstead, the band did nothing and the album, in America anyway, died on the vine. Their drummer left, exasperated. It could have been the end of a very short story.\n\nRather, this story has a second chapter (as well as a new drummer, Jimmy Hughes) and it reveals a tougher, denser, more hard-hitting Darling Buds. Some credit for that goes to producer Street. The strong, mid-'60s-derived pop instincts are still there - Lewis lists the Beatles and Rolling Stones of that era as primary sources - but the band has a harder edge. \"It Makes No Difference,\" the leadoff track, is a blistering, if blase, kiss-off to a lover; \"Do You Have to Break My Heart\" asks that steely question as it is accompanied by a bouncy melodic arrangement; \"You Won't Make Me Die\" is a strong declarative statement about surviving a breakup. The exuberant joy of earlier tracks such as \"Spin\" and \"Let's Go Round There\" is somewhat muted.\n\n\"I got fed up with writing about nicey-nice things all the time,\" says Lewis. \"My life wasn't a lot of nicey-nice because of what was happening with our management. Things weren't running smoothly and I had some bitter, nasty things to say. I was writing how I was feeling. At this point, I'm definitely more streetwise to the music industry. You don't trust half as many people as you did when you started.\"\n\nLewis says she transferred those negative feelings about the industry into the context of love songs. Harley, influenced by first-generation pop-punk bands like the Undertones and the Stranglers, wrote the bulk of the music. Now, Lewis stresses, the songs are not all true tales of her own offstage life. \"All our songs are about love,\" she says, \"and if all my songs were about my own experience I'd be in a mental home, a really screwed-up woman.\"\n\nThe Darling Buds surfaced as part of England's \"blonde wave\" that includes the Primitives, Transmission Vamp and the Heart Throbs, among others. Naturally, the English press extolled them, and then pitted them against one another. \"When it started happening,\" Lewis says, \"it was nice to be written about, but we knew we weren't just another band like the Primitives or Blondie. We're all very different bands. I can't say I dislike the Primitives because that would be a lie. It's everyone else that tries to make it look like we're all at each other's throats.\"\n\nLive review at The Waterfront Norwich (supported by the Bardots) - Melody Maker December 1, 1990 by Iam McGregor\n\nThen it's the turn of The Darling Buds, and the question is, \"Do they know what time it is ?\". The first song leaves the living dead unmoved. But after a sly cuss from Andrea, they wake up and get on down, all spectacles on Andrea. Spinning reds, yellows and blues reflect off the ceiling ducting and the area fizzes with sparkly pop brightness.\n\nThe new songs seem to have a looser beat and a tighter guitar. Andrea looks radiant, Harley looks seriously worth considering and the bass player looks like a Macc Lad. A cover of New Orders \"Temptation\", \"Burst\" and much indie shake and thrash fizz along before tonight folds in on itself. It's 11.00.\n\nThe Darling Buds - Spiral Scratch Magazine November 1990 by Tim Eames\n\nHow do you judge a great pop group? Some people would say a band who gradually build up support and then go on to reel off a string of successful albums over a number of years, like say the Rolling Stones or U2. Other s may cite a band like the Beatles, whose records are arguably as popular today as they were when first released. I tend to prefer bands who are maybe only around for a few years and only manage a couple of albums and a handful of singles but for that short time have that certain something that makes them shine brighter than the competition. And that's how I'd like to remember the Darling Buds in the years to come. Live their roots were so obviously set in Punk, but they managed to exude such a joyous enthusiasm for their music that was second to none.\n\nI first came across them one evening in 1987 whilst listening to Radio One. Janice Long was preparing to interview the band of the moment, the Beastie Boys and preceded them with the debut single by a band I'd never heard of before. 'If I Said' blaring out of a little mono speaker sounded wonderful and from then on I was in love. Looking back, I'd rate that song alongside the likes of the Jesus & Mary Chain's 'Never Understand' and Primal Scream's 'Velocity Girl' as the best of the decade. That was the start of the Darling Buds proper, but as is often the case, they nearly didn't even get that far!\n\nLike many successful songwriting partnerships, that of the Darling Buds grew out of a previously long standing friendship. Andrea Lewis and Gerrait Farr more commonly known as Harley Davidson (on account of having a father who was a former Hell's Angel!), both attended the same school in Caerleon, South Wales. Though it was to be several years before the two of them began writing songs together. Both left school not really knowing what they wanted to do. Harley got a job in a factory and Andrea worked briefly as a nanny.\n\nBored with his job as an apprentice engineer, Harley jumped at the chance of a job in a local recording studio. Though the nature of his work made him a general dogsbody or teaboy, it did have the perk of cheap use of the studio. At this time, Harley played bass in a band who were rather unimaginatively named The Party. They had a dark, moody image, dressed in black clothes and played Joy Division and Velvet Underground covers. Unfortunately they weren't interested in Harley's self penned songs, regarding them as too pop orientated, so his songwriting career was put on hold for the time being. That is, until a chance meeting with Andrea some weeks later, when she agreed to sing on a demo tape he had recorded on his portastudio. The results were pleasing, so much so that they decided to form a band. First a name was needed and this time a more imaginative one than The Party was looked for. Harley's parents' bookshelf was used for inspiration and a book by H E Bates came to the attention. The book was called The Darling Buds Of May and the band now had a name they liked: The Darling Buds.\n\nDEMO\n\nStudio time was booked in order to record the three songs Andrea and Harley had written and in two sessions in May and June 1986, 'If I Said', 'Just To Be Seen' and 'Mary's Got To Go' were recorded. Also around this time, Andrea saw an advert in a local newspaper looking for bands who were wanting to play in Newport. Having contacted the organisers (one of whom was Chris, later to play bass for the Buds), a gig was arranged for the following week. This took Harley somewhat by surprise, as they only had three songs, no bass player and a temperamental drum machine! Thankfully, Harley's best friend Simon, who had played on the studio session, agreed to play live dates for them as well. The Darling Buds' first public performance took place at El Seico's in Newport on 24th June, 1986. Six songs were played - the three already recorded ones, a new song 'I Couldn't Remember' (written by Harley and Andrea in the week prior to the gig), plus cover versions of the Cramps' 'Human Fly' and 'Femme Fatale' by the Velvet Underground. Although the drum machine behaved as though it had a mind of it's own, the audience reaction was favourable enough to give them the incentive to play again.\n\nFurther local gigs were arranged and from the second one onwards the band had a permanent drummer; Bloss had played in one of the other bands on the bill at the Buds first gig and was persuaded to replace the out of favour drum machine. Bloss also being cheaper than his battery heavy computer counterpart.\n\nDuring the summer of '86 the band was put on hold while Harley and Bloss went busking abroad. At the turn of the year though the Darling Buds reformed and set about their plans for world domination.\n\nDue to the ominous mountain of demo tapes the average DJ or record company receives, they reckoned on having more chance of getting heard and noticed if they put two songs from the demo tape out as a self financed single instead. 'Just To Be Seen' and 'If I Said' were chosen and the master tapes sent off (ironically to CBS, who the Buds would later sign a major label deal through) to be pressed into a 7\" single, with a run of 2000 copies. The possibility of an ultimate Darling Buds collectors item were dashed when Andrea left the only test pressing on the back seat of a car and the sun melted it beyond recognition. The single was issued as a double A-side on the bands' own Darling Label (the label's only release) and officially released on Friday 13th (!) March 1987. A distribution real with Revolver of Bristol ensured that the record was relatively easily available nationwide. Copies were sent to night time Radio One DJs John Peel and Janice Long and to the music press. The decision to release a record rather than send out demo tapes paid off, with John Peel playing the flip side. So a decision to make it a double A-side seemed a good one as well. The music weeklies were similarly impressed. Melody Maker's Mick Mercer describing 'If I Said' as \"Brilliant! Tullulah Gosh on meths\", while Rodger Holland of Sounds perfectly summed up the record's appeal with his review: \"'Just To Be Seen' is standard John Peel fare circa the 1981 girl group boom boom, but 'If I Said' is slower, better arranged and perfectly, precisely wonderful.\" Many fanzine writers also rushed headlong into praising the band to the hilt, but the Buds popularity as yet remained on a small level, with the single eventually selling out more than a year later. Impressed by the debut single, John Peel invited the Darling Buds to record a session for his radio programme. This was recorded on the 1st of April 1987 and broadcast later on the same month. The session is of special interest, as it includes the track 'I Couldn't Remember', which has not subsequently been released on vinyl. The John Peel session helped introduce the Buds to a wider audience, bringing with it the offer of various gigs up and down the country. Constant gigging and the willingness to play anywhere and everywhere that would have them, played an important part in building up support for the band. Early concerts in the far North of England may have only been attended by a handful of people, but the numbers would increase substantially each time they went back to play there again. Sometimes the enthusiastic demand was such that the encores would consist of five or six songs which had already been played in the main set!\n\nSPIN\n\nAlso around this time 'Spin' was recorded and released on a flexi disc given free with Norwich based So Naive fanzine. It was backed with the track 'If Only' by Bubblegum Splash, a band who were at the time in a similar position to the Buds, having released one single for an independent label. As the number of gigs the band were asked to play increased, this brought a problem for Simon, who was finding it increasingly hard to get time off work. As he needed a regular income to pay off a newly acquired mortgage, he was reluctantly forced to leave the band. A replacement was found fairly easily. Chris had played guitar for a number of local hardcore bands around Newport and had helped to organise the Darling Buds first gig. He readily agreed to be the band's new bass player and played his first gig with them in Port Talbot two days later.\n\nAutumn 1987 brought another Radio One session for the heavily converted John Peel, who commented at the time: \"There are a lot of bands around at the moment making a similar sound, but the Darling Buds I prefer to most of them.\"\n\nIn September the Buds signed their first record deal, to South Yorkshire based Native records. It was a deal that would lead to large record sales and a high showing in the independent chart, eventually leading to a major label deal, but also a contract that in the long run would prove difficult to get out of.\n\nThe first half of 1988 saw the Buds playing mainly pub and club venues up and down the country at regular intervals, averaging around two gigs per week. In between times Andrea and Harley found time to write a few new songs and used some of Native's money in the studio, eventually recording six tracks. These were released on two singles in March and May, with three songs coming out on each 12\".\n\n'Shame On You' was chosen as the first single and sold fairly well, getting the Buds into the independent chart for the first time. It also sold well in Europe, even though it was available only on import. In Spain it even reached number fifteen in the national chart, which by the Spanish by radio system meant it got played every hour!\n\nIN THE PAPERS\n\nAcclaim in the UK however, remained on a smaller scale. Coverage in the national music press was shortly to change. Towards the end of March the Darling Buds played at Kennington Cricketers in London and witnessed by Melody Maker's Chris Roberts (who had been largely responsible for breaking the Primitives a few months earlier). He proceeded to give them a rave review and within a month the Buds were given a Melody Maker front cover and a full two page article. A second front cover followed in June, by which time the other music weeklies had started to give the band similar attention.\n\nThe second single for Native, 'It's All Up To You' was backed with a low budget, but none the less imaginative promotional video, directed by former Slits' member Viv Alberine. It enabled the Buds to be given their first airing on British national television when it was shown on ITV's The Chart Show. There was also a limited edition numbered gatefold 7\" issued, which included the version of 'Spin' from the So Naive flexi as an additional track.\n\nAs audiences grew and their two Native singles scaled the indie charts, major labels began to take notice. The Darling Buds eventually signing to CBS subsidiary Epic in June 1988. It was a deal whereby they were still signed to Native, but the records would be marketed by Epic. Thus, a larger budget would be available would be available for recording and promotion, whilst artistic control was kept, due to Native having the final say over what was released.\n\nOn June 17th the Darling Buds played their first overseas concert, at Valencia Barraca Club in Spain. Billed as a festival titled The Conjuring Of Dances, the whole event was bizarre to say the least. Also featuring the Corn Dollies, the Waltones and The Man From Delmonte, the 2000 capacity event was sold out weeks in advance. The whole show, including band interviews, Spanish dancing and trapeze acts between sets, was broadcast live on Spanish radio and television. The Buds finally went on stage at 4 AM, after having consumed the mountain of free drink provided by the promoter.\n\nBURST\n\nOn returning to Britain the band then undertook a short five date tour supporting the Wonderstuff, before preparing for their first major tour which was to coincide with the release of their next single.\n\nTheir first release on Epic, 'Burst', though being on a major label brought with it a multitude of limited editions and special formats and also opened up the foreign market for collectors. 'Burst' was the first Darling Buds record to be released overseas, as well as in the UK. European pressings of the various Epic singles are fairly easily available from countries such as Spain, Holland and Germany, These can be picked up for around £4 for 7\" and £7 for 12\" issues.\n\n'Burst' was by any measure a great pop song. Bouncy enough for daytime radio and with a killer chorus sure to get all but the most lifeless soul singing along. Aided by a plethora of promotion in terms of music press adverts and interviews, a video to go with the single and the Buds first appearance (on Saturday morning children's programme The Wide Awake Club!) it just failed to dent the Top 40, peaking just a few places outside it. A limited gatefold sleeved 7\" was issued with a much altered \"Slightlydelic\" version of 'Shame On You' as an extra track.\n\n'Hit The Ground' was released as an immediate follow up and this time the Buds entered the national charts at number 33. An appearance on Top Of The Pops ensued, a nice gesture to those who were ready to write the band off as no hopers in the early stages. The Darling Buds were now at the forefront of the resurgence of British guitar based rock music, along with bands like The Wedding Present, The Wonderstuff and The House Of Love. Readers of NME voted them third best new band in their end of year poll and 'Shame On you' featured in John Peel's Festive Fifty listeners chart.\n\nAn official fan club was set up early on in 1989, under the name of Perfick. All new members received a flexi disc containing live versions of 'Valentine' and 'That's The Reason', recorded at Bournmouth Academy the previous year.\n\nPOP SAID POP SAID\n\nIn February 1989 the Buds long awaited debut LP was finally released. The album was originally to have been called Pop Art, but this idea was dashed when Transvision Vamp used the same name for their debut album. The retitled Pop Said contained twelve tracks, including the last two singles, plus another previous single 'Shame On You'. Pop Said was a cover to cover collection of timeless pop songs and as ever with The Darling Buds, had not a filler in sight. The music press were by now unanimously converted and the album was branded a classic by more than one writer. In fact, the only real criticism that could be argued is that of over production. In a few cases this gave the new songs a feel of too much polish and not enough spit, whereas a more basic, rougher live sound would have suited the songs better.\n\n'Let's Go Round There' was lifted from the LP as a single the following month and as has been The Darling Buds policy, was backed with unreleased material on the B-side. Whilst the A-side was slower and something of a departure from previous singles, 'Turn You On' and 'Different Daze' were yet more examples of effortlessly fine sparkling pop which could have quite easily passed as A-sides themselves. As usual, several limited edition versions of the single were issued. There was a yellow vinyl version on 7\" and a laser etched 12\" with the three tracks on one side and a flower etched into the vinyl on the other side. Perhaps the most interesting though was a gatefold 7\" which included a \"flip flop\" version (ie slower and over a hip hop type drum beat) of 'It's All Up To You'.\n\nAfter a rare couple of months break, in June the band set off on a short tour of Europe, taking in Holland, Germany, France and Spain. A further LP track was released as a single in July, 'You've Got to Choose' being the song chosen. The B-side saw the long overdue release of the excellent live favourite 'Mary's Got To Go', whilst the 12\" boasted an additional new track 'I'll Never Stop'. A short five date UK club tour accompanied the single's release, before the Buds played to their largest ever audience - at Cardiff Arms Park as support to Simple Minds!\n\nHEY GRINGO\n\nA larger tour followed in October where several new songs were aired, even though there was no new vinyl released to coincide. A feature of the live shows at this time was the addition of a rhythm guitarist, introduced as Gringo from Barcelona. Apparently he had persuaded the band to let him play with them whilst in Spain and they hadn't been able to get rid of him afterwards! The turn of the year was spent in the studio, recording a new single and material for a second LP. During these sessions the band underwent a change in line up when Bloss vacated the drum stool in order to become the band's new manager. A replacement was readily found in Jimmy Hughes, who had previously drummed for Black, the Christians and the Icicle Works. The first fruits of the recording sessions surfaced in May 1990. 'Tiny Machine' was chosen as the new single and backed by more experimental tracks which were generally not as strong as previous material. Perhaps a somewhat surprising choice as single, considering last year's live shows had included several seemingly more obvious choices. It was not much of a surprise therefore when it failed to chart.\n\nThe second album 'Crawdaddy' has just been released to the expected acclaim and the Buds next moves are eagerly awaited.\n\nLive review at Leicester University - New Musical Express November 10, 1990 by Stephen Dalton\n\nPop stars who smile and mean it are a highly cherishable, dying breed. Andrea Bud chats to the crowd, reads out birthday requests and generally comes over all chummy and sincere for the Leicester fans. Which might explain why these former chart guests and indie pop figureheads are back playing draughty student halls and poxy little clubs instead of arenas.\n\nThe Darling Buds' recent dip in popularity has nothing to do with and lots to do with fashion. Early in tonight's set they hammer out favourites from their hysterically praised first album, still sounding stiff and stodgy. Then they flow into the dance informed fluidity of their cruelly under rated and vastly superior new LP, complete with psychedelic light and film backdrop and it all makes perfect (pop) sense.\n\nTheir main problem, of course, is not being very rock'n'roll, which is fine by me - we've got more than enough clueless young men trying on phoney attitudes and accents, thank you very much. You just know Harley's revved up riffing on 'Burst' and 'Hit The Ground' comes from riding a moped around Newport and Andrea's arms akimbo dancing has been perfected at her local rugby club disco instead of during wild crack orgies with NWA.\n\nConsequently these rock poses seem mannered and unnecessary, especially when the recent tunes like 'So Close' and 'A Little Piece Of Heaven' display an elastic momentum and dreamy sultriness missing from the early hits.\n\nPowered by these gushing grooves and daringly raunchy lyrics, the Buds steam into late evening with renewed confidence and shimmering grandeur. Even old B-sides like 'Turn You On' get the funky Midas touch, but their most inspired move is transplanting a huge chunk of New Order's 'Temptation' into 'It's All Up To You'.\n\nAnd yes, the kids are dancing.\n\nLive review at Liverpool Polytechnic - Record Mirror October 20 1990 by Melissa Blease\n\nMale first year students visibly swoon as Andrea Darling bounces onstage flaunting her trademark swishy blondness and chucking flowers at the crowd. The light show kicks into trippy psychedelic action and three guitars roll happily into the noisy jingle-jangle that is essential Bud.\n\nIn these days of baggy pants, boring anoraks and thumping dancefloor mayhem, there are still some bands who believe pop rules and guitars are fun. And by gum, this is one of them.\n\nThe Darling Buds are a painless experience: pretty to watch and sweet on the ears. Uncomplicated, they're fresh and innocent, quirky, danceable and popping. New material from the album 'Crawdaddy' provides a blast of maturity amongst all the early dreamier stuff. 'It Makes No Difference' and 'Do You Have To Break My Heart' make the album a must have and the live show groovy. But old faves are real highlights even 'It's All Up To You' sounds fresh as a full bloom daisy and 'Hit The Ground' encourages some insane stage diving stunts, appropriately.\n\nAll in all, it's a bouncy night, with any occasional verges on the bland forgivable purely because it's admirable to see a band who aren't just giving into current trends and are playing by their own swirly rules. Pop rules - OK?\n\nLive review at The Bierkeller Bristol - Melody Maker October 13, 1990 by Chris Roberts\n\nAndrea Lewis' earliest memory is of being told to sing \"Little Donkey\" in the school play at the age of five, while wearing a dress with red camels on it and banging two halves of a coconut together to make clip clop noises. Another little girl, thus relegated to playing Joseph or a wise man or something, grumbled, \"You're not very good, you're not\". Andrea turned on her ferociously \"Listen you, if it wasn't for me you wouldn't even be on this stage\". Born pop star, or what?\n\nStrange how the bold brave men of the music press queue up to kick little girls when it's fashionable. I especially respect the ones who breathlessly stuttered that the Darling Buds' first album was a pop classic but now twist themselves into knots so as not to appear faithfully unbaggy in front of their equally trendy sheep like colleagues. Probably something to do with diminutive genitals, subsequent insecurity.\n\nAnyway the Buds seem to be as hip as harikiri right now, which of course, sends those of genuine artistic temperament such as myself racing off to defend them, there being no invitations to a Spanish civil war in the postbox. Little is quite so glamorous as a defiant lost course. In Bristol, backs against the wall, the Buds burn with such a simple clarity of vision and purpose that I am compelled to compare them to Ernest Hemingway. Ernie would say \"Write the best you can and write it as straight as you can\". Andrea sings \"If it's real, really real, you say that it's real\". You see my indisputable point.\n\nThe honest and seamless matching of intention to execution would be clinical were it not for priceless vulnerability. As their song writing and sense of dynamics improve (the guitar crazy \"Crawdaddy\" album has as much to do as Mancdance as tigresses have to do with water buffalo), the overall buzz that is the Buds live keeps its essential rough exuberance and persuasive conviction.\n\nThe light show may be the most psychedelic in christendom (I spend half the gig squinting and Harley has trouble locating his hands on the guitar) but the seductive hums of \"Fall\" and \"Tiny machine\" and razorblade rotations of \"Lets Go Round There\" still fizz ingenuously. \"Makes No Difference\" is a jagged jewel the Pixies would relish. \"So Close\" is a warm cleansing wave of yearning and rapture. Anyone claiming otherwise is placing sheaves of sixth form theories over their ears.\n\nAgain like Hemingway, and I've never been more serious, The Darling Buds emit great shooting star moments from the solid slender splendour. Tonight these are several, and as customary to the Buds as falling off a log. The one that puts napalm in your heart is surely the second when you realise \"If I Said\" ( their first and most skeletal single) has mutated into New Orders \"Temptation\", and they can't! They can! \"Oh you've got grey eyes, oh you've got blue eyes.\" This is more of a spine kidnapper than I can possibly convey. Suddenly Andrea has forgotten to be all jolly and friendly and self effacing and this band is a very serious and venomous proposition. They're are chewing up the flak and spitting fire.\n\nGreat blondes don't die, they just unnerve academics. This was. dauntless. Earth may be full of dumb schmucks but Heaven loves The Darling Buds.\n\nCrystal Clear review - New Musical Express October 6, 1990 by Jack Barron\n\nThinking about it, didn't we go through some silly moments in the '80s? One of the silliest had to be the glut of bands fronted by women who all had a severe dose of Blondie in their formative years but had neither the charisma not the voice to match. Did Andrea Bud fall from this branch? Who knows? Mind you, the catalogue number for this record is blond 6, which is perhaps more interesting than the music.\n\nCrawdaddy review - New Musical Express October 6, 1990 by Steve Lamacq\n\nThe Darling Buds' long overdue second LP starts with the gorgeously tense 'It Makes No Difference', a surprisingly Pixies-esque fuse-wire spite song that fizzes its way into your consciousness. Sadly, that's also where the surprises end. 'Crawdaddy' is disappointing, wandering record, born out of the Buds' year in the wilderness.\n\nIt's an example of how fast pop has moved in the past two years that The Darling Buds, 18 months (but who's counting?) after their last LP, return sounding so out of time. That's not a crime itself, but this record feels like a halfway album: a mix of their old shiny Blonde simplicity and '60s influenced crossover pop.\n\n'Crawdaddy', which isn't half as mean and grungey as the title suggests, is a weird collection of psychedelic influences, pop tit-bits and half good ideas. Where their debut 'Pop Said' was a bittersweet, simplistic, punchy record, this is the dazed follow-up. It sounds like it's trying to make up for lost time.\n\nIf you imagine their 'Let's Go Round There' single a year and a half on, this is where you end up. Strangely off beam. The Buds have tried very hard on 'Crawdaddy', paying a lot of attention to detail which was missing on their 'Pop Said' debut. But really that's not the problem - no matter how much Mr. Sheen you apply to tracks like 'Fall' and 'A Little Bit Of Heaven' they'd still be bits of old tat.\n\nAmid all this, though, there are some flashes of beauty, including 'Honeysuckle', the spacey 'So Close' and the bursting, berating 'Do You Have To Break My Heart'. But in the end it's a too incomplete, too pedestrian record - despite Andrea's lyrical efforts - to denote a great album. Grown up yes, but dazzling no.\n\nCrawdaddy review - Sounds October 6, 1990 by Paul Mardles\n\n'Pop Said', you won't watch me growing old and hairy.\n\nThe Darling buds have always embodied the imprudent antics of adolescence - the perennial thrill of the chase and the mind numbing chill of the rebuff. Hitherto, however, The Buds perfectly commendable stance has been severely tarnished by their feverish, flimsy fumblings, which, more often that not, dangle perilously close to disintegration.\n\n'Crawdaddy', though, portrays The Buds in an entirely different light. The innate chirpiness of yesteryear has been bolstered by a charming, intoxicating undertow that suggests The Buds have always owned a respectable set of sinews but were previously forbidden from flexing them.\n\nWhich is a crying shame. Because aside from a couple of cheap, nauseating efforts ('Do You Have Top Break My Heart?' and 'A Little Bit Of Heaven'), The Buds decision to flaunt their full blooded frothy side generally plays dividends. 'It Makes No Difference', the opening track, starts like a long lost blood brother of The Roses' 'I Wanna Be Adored', before breaking out in a rash of juicy riffs and lusty vocals, while 'Fall' and 'So Close' ache with a potent combination of lust and dread, careering down a path The Buds would previously have gawped at.\n\nWho cares what pop said? The Darling Buds have started shaving. This is no bad thing.\n\nCrystal Clear review - Melody Maker October 6 1990 by Ian Gittins\n\nSo this is what all the fuss has been about! Personally, I can't see why folk need to get outraged about Andrea mugging a dance beat. The Darling Buds have always been no more (no less) than a pop band, and \"Crystal Clear\" strikes me as a fine pop song. I dunno, maybe I'm missing the point, or something. It's a large advance on the punkier jabs of \"Pop Said\".\n\nCrawdaddy review - Melody Maker September 29, 1990 by Andrew Mueller\n\nThis album was always going to be on a hiding to nothing. \"Pop Said\", as far as debuts go, was a pretty definitive effort, an admirably executed flashbomb of gleeful derivation. After that, the Buds could have done the same thing again, and we'd have accused them of only having one idea, which wasn't really theirs in the first place (though that was never the point). Or they could have attempted to progress, to move on, to explore vistas anew. And we'd have dumped on that because they were better at what they were doing before. It occurs to me that this argument is getting somewhat tangled.\n\nAnyway, as it happens, they've done neither. \"Crawdaddy\" is the sound of a band going \"Er, um\".\n\nFrom the cover (a close up shot of a flower possibly inspired by Swans' \"Burning World\", very probably not) to the insidious guitars and breathy vocals of \"It makes no difference\", which sounds alarmingly like The Heart Throbs, The Darling Buds want us to know that they've changed.\n\nAnd guess how they've changed boys and girls.\n\nAs you might expect, the result makes roughly as much sense as Happy Mondays attempting a collection of starry eyed Blondie pastiches. \"Tiny Machine\" and \"Crystal Clear\", the singles, are sadly indicative. They have wah-wah guitars and shuffling drums and they are delivered with all the conviction of a band who think this is probably the right thing to be doing but they're not sure. At least the Soup Dragons have the gumption to be wholeheartedly opportunist.\n\nElsewhere, even the which more evoke the Buds of yore (\"Do You Have To Break My Heart\" and \"\"Honeysuckle\") suffer from the no guts, no glory syndrome. The epic ballad \"So Close\", it of The Sundays-ish guitars, is redeeming because it's surprising and the record totters (where once they skipped) to a close with \"The End Of The Beginning\", all staccato sub Hendrix guitars and a chorus pinched from the verse of The Adult Net's \"Take Me\", thief stealing from forger or what?\n\nThis is a hopelessly misplaced each way bet. \"Crawdaddy\" has one foot in each of two graves.\n\nCrawdaddy review - Record Mirror September 29, 1990 by Liam Wraith\n\nThis is not the one. After 'Pop Said''s promise and the romping singles 'Burst' and 'Hit The Ground', the Buds have moved sideways rather than upwards with 'Crawdaddy'. The sound is stroppy and full - probably thanks to Morrissey's former producer Stephen Street - and quite clearly aimed to set arms a whirling and bums a wagging on the dancefloor. Not that they are set to fail, either.\n\nApart from the embarrassingly limp early single 'Tiny Machine', the Buds have now fully mastered the whirling dance guitar and thumping drum machine. It works on 'A Little Bit Of Heaven' where Andrea stops pissing around being all fey and girly and is forced to fight her way to the top of the mix.\n\nNor does she really sound as good as she once did; her voice unfortunately beginning to grate on my fickle palate. At times, like on 'Do You Have To Break My Heart', which is so wet you could do your washing in it, she seems to think that cuteness alone will get her through. Being so closely shadowed by Harley's guitar doesn't help either; anger is what she needs, not mollycoddling.\n\nStill, despite such harsh criticisms, there's enough here - 'Fall', 'Heaven', the growling guitar on 'It Makes No Difference' - to suggest the Darlings will fight again.\n\nThe Darling Buds: Groove Over Darling - Record Mirror September 15, 1990 interview by Gary Crossing\n\nThe latest one time indie popsters to take a bold step onto the dance floor are The Darling Buds, who've returned with guitars and grooves a blasting, and a monster of a new single. Two years ago, before this once proud nation had danced itself completely and utterly dizzy, Wales' own Darling Buds basked in the spotlight's warm and nourishing rays, with their light footed and charming indie rock creations.\n\nEnding an almost 20 month long fallow period since their debut LP 'Pop Said' and singles such as 'Burst' and 'Hit The Ground', the Buds have returned to pop's sweet and fragrant garden with their new album 'Crawdaddy' - a name taken from the legendary Sixties club frequented by The Beatles and The Rolling Stones.\n\nProduced by Stephen Street - of Morrissey fame - it has already spawned the monster singles 'Tiny Machine' and the current 'Crystal Clear', the latter being a drum machined, brash guitared and flower powered dance record which more than adequately leeks up with the Ivor Joneses. It's also seen the Buds join the legion of indie dancefloor crossover artists with a blistering club remix courtesy of Hercules, aka John Schroeder, whose previous work includes a stint as engineer for The Stone Roses.\n\nSinger Andrea Lewis and guitarists Harley Davidson, full time Buds and one off models for New York photographer Annie Liebowitz's Gap clothing store pictures, sit in the British Museum cafâ in leafy Bloomsbury. In a single fruitless bid to be topical, we have wandered mummified and Roman jewelled corridors in search of a crystal room in which to chat. A nifty and original idea which, alas, was doomed to perish. So instead it's \"milk and two sugars please\".\n\nSo, what are we to expect from pop's favourite sprouts this time around?\n\n\" 'Crawdaddy's' definitely got a harder edge to it and a better live vibe,\" says Andrea. \" 'Pop said' didn't flow very well. It wasn't like our live shows at all, so we wanted to capture the live sound this time.\n\n\"With the first album we used a drum machine which I programmed myself,\" joins in Harley. \"But with this one we used real drums provided courtesy of former Black sticksman and our new Darling Bud member, Jimi Hughes.\"\n\n\"Our style of writing has changed,\" continues Andrea. \" 'Pop Said', like almost every band's first album, was a collection of old personal and live favourites which were probably written three years before they were recorded. 'Crawdaddy is a lot more relevant to how we're feeling now.\"\n\nFans and doubting Dylan Thomases alike will be pleasantly surprised by a newly found rich, raw edged, vinyl maturity which Andrea and Harley put down to the fact that they took their time and adopted a more considered approach. Stephen Street's guiding hand was also much appreciated.\n\n\"Stephen's very enthusiastic and involved,\" says Harley. \"He believes there's too much attention drawn to producers these days; he thinks it should all come from the band. So, from the time you're in the studio with him, he basically becomes another band member.\"\n\nRenowned for their live shows, The Darling Buds haven't toured for over a year. They take to the road in October. A prospect which Andrea finds thrilling, yet daunting.\n\n\"We've been having tour withdrawal symptoms for about six months. I'm a bit scared because when you haven't done something for a long time it's all new again. You don't know how the audience are going to react, or what people are going to think. I'm a bit nervous, but it's a challenge and we're going to get back out there and do it all again like when we first started. Only this time we'll try even harder.\"\n\nThis will no doubt please the Slullf**k Crew, the Bud's staunch supporters. Despite the Darlings' disc drought of late, they still keep in touch, occasionally popping in for elevenses.\n\n\"A lot of them have gone off to see other bands while we've been away,\" says Andrea. \"But when those bands play in Cardiff, the fans find out where we are and come in for a cup of tea.\"\n\nHardly typical pop star behaviour from hardly typical pop stars, The Darling Buds are probably the most friendly band in the world.\n\n\"I pride myself on being a very down to earth person,\" says Andrea. \"I couldn't ever be stand offish.\"\n\n\"Basically, what you have to do is organise your time so that you can fit everyone in. We like meeting and talking to people. We're not going to snub anyone really. I think that would be stupid. It's bad attitude that rock'n'roll has had for a long time.\"\n\nEqually ardent is the band's refusal to leave Wales. They live in Newport, where Harley, Andrea, their friend Dave and newly acquired puppy, Holly the Collie, share a flat.\n\n\"I'm in danger of becoming a dog bore,\" barks Andrea. \"I can't wait to go out to the pub and tell everyone what Holly's been up to.\"\n\nAndera's other current obsession is shopping. \"I just like spending money on anything from Tuppperware to eyeliner,\" she says. \"I'm a junk freak, I buy loads of it.\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" complains Harley. \"She'll only pop out to post a letter and all these strange things are brought into the house.\"\n\n\"I like cherubs at the moment,\" says Andrea. \"I've just put a huge gold one on top of the TV.\"\n\nIn response, Harley's strategy is a shrewd one. \"We just put up with it. After a while Andrea forgets about them so we put them in the cupboard.\"\n\nModest mites that they are, do Andrea and Harley ever get embarrassed by the attention they receive?\n\n\"If you're in a club or walk into a record shop and people say 'Look there's The Darling Buds let's put their single on', it's dreadful, we have to walk out.\n\n\"It is embarrassing,\" Andrea continues. \"It's just like your mother getting out pictures of you in the bath when you were two. You may have a really cute bottom, but you don't want people to see it.\"\n\nHaving originally arrived on the crest of the blonde pop wave alongside The Primitives and Transvision Vamp, The Buds are constantly dogged by the inevitable comparisons which tend to annoy them.\n\n\"The trouble is, because I'm a girl singer with blonde hair who fronts the band, we get pigeonholed with the other,\" explains Andrea. \"People don't think about the songs we write or their structure, they just see a band with a girl singer. Bands fronted by boys are allowed individuality. Why aren't we?\"\n\n\"What I find annoying,\" interrupts Harley, \"is the fact that various bands like The Primitives and ourselves were very much talked about, maybe a year ago and were a big part of a lot of people's lives for a long time. Now though, a lot of press don't have much time for them. Dance has taken over to such a great extent that a lot of other bands are forgotten.\"\n\nAndrea doesn't see this as the end of the traditional four piece though. \"There'll always be people who want to go to gigs and see a real band on stage; one that actually has songs and melodies and banter in between.\"\n\nWill The Darling Buds still be blossoming 20 years from now?\n\n\"I don't know, I could get bored with it pretty soon,\" says Harley.\n\n\"It's not a very nice business for an artist to be in. You have to have a 50 per cent business head on you at all times,\" adds Andrea. \"It's kind of like the sixth form really. It's good fun but you've got exams all the time.\"\n\nThe Darling Buds: Buds-U-Like - Sky Magazine, August 1990 interview by Paul Lester\n\nBehind their pop outlaw image - which recently earned them a modelling assignment for The Gap - The Darling Buds have a crowd of hardcore fans who jump on stage to hug singer Andrea Lewis. Now back with a new album, Crawdaddy, they dispense with punk pop in favour of a more complex, hard edged sound.\n\nIn 1988, when mots everyone was converting to acid house and disowning their rock heritage, a trio of groups emerged who flaunted their punk roots and pop record collections.\n\nBy sheer coincidence all three outfits were fronted by diminutive, pretty, blonde, females and were backed by the male rock trinity of guitar, bass and drums. From Coventry came The Primitives (whose Tracy Tracey is now brunette), Wendy James's Transvision Vamp sprang from London, while Wales offered The Darling Buds.\n\nLike their peers, The Darling Buds played basic guitar-pop ditties that, even though the band had signed to a major label, Epic, were little more than quick indie rock thrills. Today, after a couple of hits and a brief dip in the mainstream, The Darling Buds have a tougher, more sophisticated sound, while their media profile looks set to be raised by a recent modelling session involving potential pin-ups, guitarist Harley Davidson and singer Andrea Lewis.\n\nHarley and Andrea are old schoolmates who share a flat, remain cagey about the extent to which they are \"involved\", yet speak about each other in the most glowing terms. \"Andrea's a very strong person, I live with her, see her every day, but it's still quite hard to describe her. She's a beautiful person, really,\" Harley says, without the slightest hint of condescension.\n\n\"Cheers Harley,\" she responds, obviously touched, before slipping into an American soap opera accent and adding \"I think you're a beautiful person, too!\"\n\n\"Well,\" says the guitarist, \"you know where my bedroom is baby! No, honestly, Andrea's great. She knows what she wants: and she'll go out and get it. She looks after us, takes on a lot of responsibility for the band and she does it very well.\"\n\nAfter seeing them in the flesh, Andrea and Harley's recent modelling assignment for The Gap with celebrated New York photographer to the stars, Annie Liebowitz, would seem to make some sense. In the footsteps (or rather, cheekbones) of such dignitaries as Neneh Cherry, Roland Gift, footballer John Barnes and John Lennon and Yoko Ono follow the two most photogenic Buds (bassist Chris McDonagh and drummer Jimi Huhes are not in the photos), Harley sporting a leather biker's jacket and white Gap T-shirt and Andrea a short sleeved, black Gap polo neck.\n\n\"We had a call from Annie Liebowitz, saying she'd seen pictures of us in our record company's New York offices,\" says Andrea. \"It's not like, 'The Darling Buds go modelling'. It's a one off. The adverts have already been in The Times' Sunday Supplement, Elle magazine, obviously in The Gap's shop windows and they're also going to appear on London buses.\n\n\"How much did we get for doing them? Well, about five million for the nude shots.\" Ask a nosey question, get a stupid answer. \"We got a pretty tidy sum,\" she says. \"Let's just say there were quite a few noughts involved.\"\n\nIn their press shots The Darling Buds have a traditional rock'n'roll outlaw image, drawing on a lineage that can be traced back to Elvis Presley through to The Rolling Stones, Velvet Underground and punk forefathers, The Clash. While the rest of the country clamours for all things baggy and pastel coloured, The DB's are sticking to their jeans, T-shirts and black leather jackets.\n\n\"I love that whole look,\" says Harley. \"The Velvets and The Stones were permanently cool and Elvis Presley - he was outrageous, the first real punk! Over the last few years, bands have started to look good again: My Bloody Valentine, Ride, Jesus And Mary Chain.\n\nAs far as coolness goes, you've either got it or you haven't. Some people can look cool and sexy in their underwear, whereas others say Jesus Jones will never be cool, they just try too hard.\"\n\nTo what extent does The Darling Buds behaviour coincide with this rock image? Have they ever lived out the rock'n'roll fantasy experiences implied by the way they look? \"I like to get drunk occasionally, but we're hardly wild rock'n'rollers,\" says Andrea, sipping from her bottle of cider.\n\nWe keep ourselves to ourselves to ourselves most of the time,\" Harley goes on. \"I'm too tranquil to go over the top. We have actually tried to trash hotel rooms in the past, but you just can't do it now - they nail everything down in hotels these days!\"\n\n\"It's true\", says Andrea, \"we once put a shoe cleaner in the lift, but it kept finding its way back into the room!\"\n\n\"Mind you, I have stripped off a few times on tour,\" Harley quickly adds. \"A couple of years ago, after a gig in Houston, they refused to serve alcohol in our hotel 'cos it was too late, so I got down to my boxer shorts - and they gave me a drink!\"\n\n\"Groups do seem tamer today, there's none of the wildness of the sixties. That's what the Stone Roses are trying to go back to, all that stuff about throwing paint over someone's car [referring to the infamous Wolverhampton incident, for which the Roses have been taken to court] - it's hardly wild rock'n'roll, is it?\"\n\nWhat The Darling Buds do have in common with Ian Brown and co is a ferociously loyal herd of supporters. Their most ardent disciples remain The Skullfuck crew, a small but vociferous bunch hailing from Walthamstow and Watford who regularly sell T-shirts at DBs gigs, place stickers all over the Budmobile (a blue Ford Transit van driven by Andrea because the others have yet to pass their tests), graffiti the group's name all over the toilet walls at gigs and shower the stage with confetti whenever the mood takes them.\n\n\"They're great,\" says Harley. \"Once, in Brussels, one of them - Gilbert - got drunk, had his clothes chucked over the hotel balcony by some other Skullfuckers, so he climbed over these gates and pissed onto some major monument or other in the local park. Then he had to run naked through the town square to get his clothes back!\"\n\nThe Darling Buds pride themselves on their approachability, on the refusal to drift away from their Welsh routes (Harley, Andrea and Chris all live in Caerleon, near Newport) and the fans who are such an integral part of their success.\n\n\"Lots of fans jump on stage and give me hugs,\" says Andrea. \"The roadies get all worried and treat them a bit rough 'cos they think they could have a knife on them.\"\n\n\"Half the time, though, people are afraid to come up to us,\" counters Harley. \"They think we're different 'cos we're in a band who's been on Top Of The Pops and they start shaking with nerves. But we're just the same as them. I've got spots and we all wipe our bottoms like everyone else - c'mon, even Paul McCartney does that!\"\n\nAfter Andrea finishes cringing at her flatmate's colourful language she goes on to offer her opinions on Tracy Tracy, Wendy James and the two bands who enjoyed chart action and TOTP appearances at the same time as The Darling Buds.\n\n\"I like The Primitives, they've got good songs and melodies. But I don't like everything they do. As for Transvision Vamp, well.\"\n\n\"They make power pop singles,\" Harley says. \"But there's no feeling in the music. The main difference is that whereas Tracy and Wendy don't write a lot of their stuff....\"\n\n\"... I actually do,\" says Andrea, finishing the sentence to prod the point home. \"I'm really mouthy in the studio, y'know, 'cos it's me that writes the songs and I want them to sound a certain way. I feel very strongly about our music and I don't see how, if you haven't contributed to the writing, you should have a say.\"\n\nAndrea is determined to set the record straight, eager for people to realise that her role in The Darling Buds amounts to rather more than being the alluring visual icing on the musical cake. The singles, If I Said, Shame On You, It's All Up To You, Burst, Hit The Ground (which reached number 26) and You've Got To Choose (their biggest seller to date), as well as the tracks on the 1989 debut LP, Pop Said (60,000 copies sold so far), were all joint Lewis-Davidson compositions.\n\n\"I come up with the melody lines and the lyrics,\" she says. \"I don't just go into the studio for five minutes, sing a bit, then come away to make sure my hair still looks all right. I'm part of the whole process - that hasn't come across before.\"\n\nWriting credits for Crawdaddy are also shared between Andrea and Harley. The new material, produced by Stephen Street, is harder edged and more hook laden than before. The Buds are dispensing with the punk pop buzzsaw tinniness of old in favour of a more complex, textured sound.\n\n\"The new songs are harder,\" says Andrea, \"but they could all be singles.\" Tiny Machine, the recent single, was the first DBs product for a year, while Crawdaddy comes nearly 20 months after Pop Said. Is Andrea nervous about returning to pop's centre stage?\n\n\"I don't want to think about how well we'll do this time. You can't predict these things, you just have to let them happen. But look at Sinead - she went away for ages, then came back bigger and better than ever. Personally, I don't like looking too far ahead.\"\n\n\"We didn't think we'd ever get this far,\" Harley recalls. \"I remember watching Top Of The Pops, thinking, 'look at all this crap, we could be on that' and a year later we were!\"\n\nThe Darling Buds: Petal Music Machine - Melody Maker, May 26, 1990 interview by Everett True\n\nPretty much written off in their recent absence, the Darling Buds are back with a new single, \"Tiny Machine\", and an album called \"Crawdaddy\". These are the records that will finally put paid to their previously wimpish image, argues an impressed Everett True. Pics Joe Dilworth.\n\nPop said \"Because we're in Newport and because we're in love and because the sun is shining and everyone has disappeared, lost among the flowers, along old railway tracks and deserted woods and because we have PG Wodehouse book for company and because it feels to me like we're very close to tears, it must be time for another interview with the Darling Buds.\n\nDarling Buds is an anagram of \"darlings bud\". I like that idea: it's been proven true.\n\nHarley pours a third cup of tea and talks about his parents. \"I've learnt from them, definitely, my tidiness, for one\", he remarks \"It was from them I got my habit of looking up words in the dictionary if I don't know their meaning. They were very strict and I rebelled against a certain part of that, but they did teach me to respect others.\"\n\nDid you find that attitude at odds with the environment you encountered as a musician?\n\n\"Oh yeah, it didn't fit at all\", he agrees, reaching for a chocolate cookie. \"In my situation, I can do whatever I want, pretty much. I don't have to respect anyone, but I do because of the way I was brought up. I've been conditioned. So I'm quite a pleasant person, really.\"\n\nIs there anything you wouldn't like to do?\n\n\"I wouldn't kill,\" he replies, although he thinks he could. Is that because it'd be too messy? \"No, it because I'd be caught and I don't want to go to prison,\" he responds. (Which amounts to the same thing anyhow.) \"Punk made me feel I could do anything,\" Harley continues. \"I could spit and I could kill, but it was wrong. I couldn't because I was too young and my parents were still head of the household\".\n\nSo when were your wild years?\n\n\"I'm still living them now, I suppose. I don't think I'll ever grow up. It depends what you mean by wild\".\n\nWhat do you mean by wild?\n\n\"Like an animal, not to care for anything, to have no respect\", he replies, and I reflect how this notion must fascinate and repulse this disarmingly honest guitarist.\n\nPop said \"I am something intangible, something bright and bewitched. I am something to lift into your arms and stroke until you purr, something to hold against your face and squeeze until you bleed. I am a cat, with grooves for claws, a sleeve for my arched back and a stylus for milk. I am something terrible and apart, a puppy growing up to be a doberman. I am the culmination of mankind's hopes and fears and the racing tips from last week's meeting at Newmarket. \"I am pop am pop am pop am pop goes pop am pcp. \"I am the idea that three minutes of transient pleasure could change your life. I can even cause you to smile\".\n\nI smiled recently. Last Thursday, I heard a new tape by the Darling Buds and became strangely moved by a song called \"Makes No Difference,\" particularly Andrea's exquisite vocal and the way she delivers the title line. It's the toughest thing the Buds have done - a biting reply to those critics who've sniped at the group since they first appeared and have always been eager to write them off as insubstantial, merely lightweight pop fodder.\n\nIt turned out, however, the song was merely a taster for their forthcoming second album, \"Crawdaddy\", and not this week's new single on Epic at all - that honour went to the second track on the tape (which is a damn funny way of making up a demo tape, if you ask me). The single's called \"Tiny Machine\" and, sure enough, spirals and glows and tumbles and does everything pop singles should do, but...\n\nIt isn't \"Makes No Difference\". And neither does it have a vocal to compare to Harriet Sunday (which \"Difference\" does).\n\nSo, here I am, in Newport, feeling frail. Next to me is Jimmy Hughes, the Buds' new drummer who used to be in Black and the early Christians. Jimmy is a Scouser, tanned and affable.\n\n\"The three most influential people in my life\", he says, for my question don't tend to vary too much when I'm in this frame of mind, \"are Blakey of \"On The Buses\", me grandmother and Gene Krupa\".\n\n\"Blakey because I haven't got a clue, me grandmother because she brought me me first trumpet when I was five and Gena Krupa because he was the first drummer I ever got into... He was like the world's greatest drummer in the Forties.\"\n\nHow did Jimmy come to join The Darling Buds?\n\nWe were recommended two people and we picked him cos he was the cheapest,\" remarks Harley with pride.\n\n\"That's true,\" says Chris, the so far silent bassist.\n\nWe all laugh.\n\n\"It's okay playing with the Buds,\" Jimmy remarks. \"With Black, it was really complicated stuff, but with the Buds it's more straightforward rock'n'roll. It makes a change form having about 10,000 things all going on in my head at once.\"\n\nI can imagine, Jimmy, who travels down from Liverpool for rehearsals and listens to Forties jazz replaced Bloss, the Buds' old drummer, at the start of this year.\n\nPop said: \"Give me your hearts and I'll see what I can do.\" Not having any choice, we did precisely this and she (pop is always a she) promptly lost them.\n\nHere's the moment all the boys are waiting for (I suppose).\n\nAndrea seems slightly flustered. \"Oh god, what was the question again?\" she asks, embarrassed at being in the spotlight. I've just asked her what I'd earlier asked Harley and Jimmy - to name the three most influential people in her life. \"Well, I don't think I have three anyway, just my mum and that's because when I was little I spent lots of time with her and she was the one who guided me into whatever I'm doing now.\"\n\n\"My mum is quite young, and she was really in touch with what was going on. She didn't tell me not to do this or that, she'd just go, \"I hope you don't take drugs\". She never rammed it down my throat and that's good, you know, because if you start putting up barriers then there's that little forbidden fruit and you'll want it all the more. I was quite bad and naughty and the same as everyone else, but I was never like that.\n\n\"Also, my friends, especially the people next door who were like my brothers and sisters, and, like Harley said The Beatles - because I listened to their stuff from an early age, and only started to listen to punk when I was about 16.\"\n\nPop said: \"F*** this for a game of soldiers, I'm off to listen to the new Lemonheads single. Pop always was the most flighty of companions.\n\nHow about you, Chris? Who are the three most influential people or things in your life?\n\n\"I can only think of two things,\" the tall thoughtful bassist replies. \"My parents who pushed me through the education system, and punk which influenced me to pick up the guitar.\"\n\nWe seem to be straying into abstracts here, but never mind. \"If punk hadn't happened I probably would have just been an academic and ended up with a PhD is statistics or computing.\"\n\nChris used to be quite a leading light on the Newport thrash scene, and it was through this that he first met Harley and Andrea. The talk turns to why Chris wanted to be in a band.\n\n\"When I was at school,\" he continues, \"I played trombone in the orchestra. We would go on tours and play in front of lots of people - we even did a tour of the east coast of America. It just came from there, the big buzz which occurs when you step up on stage. Everything else I've ever done just doesn't match that buzz.\"\n\n\"The most memorable experience I've ever had playing live would be Cardiff Arms park, supporting Simple Minds, walking on and seeing 50,000 people in front of me, absolutely crapping myself.\"\n\n\"It was terrible,\" Harley recalls, \"I stood on stage and on the very first note, a can hit my guitar. I thought, \"Ah, this is going to be good\". They kept coming through the rest of our set. But that's what you're in it for: the challenge.\"\n\nChris: \"It's always an achievement when you walk off stage, knowing you've just been on stage and you've done something. There's a tremendous feeling of satisfaction, and knowing that those people out front want to be where you are. Not that we are above anyone else, just that you're up there doing it.\"\n\nDuring their absence from the public eye, the inevitable rumours started flying around about the Buds' future - whether, indeed they ever had one.\n\nAndrea, \"We opened up the papers one day and it was like, \"Oh, we've split up!\", and \"You've left, Chris!\" Melody Maker had our next single down as \"Tiny Miracle\" and the album as \"Belladonna\". Bloss was called Mike something and his name's Richard - it just goes to show.\" [see Melody Maker, March 17, 1990]\n\nHarley: \"I don't believe half of what I read, otherwise I would've been worried!\"\n\nThe new single, \"Tiny Machine\" sounds, I'm assured by a close photographer friend, as if it's travelling along the path the Buds should have followed after their first single (i.e. it's not too over produced, it has bite and it melts even the iciest of hearts at 50 paces).\n\n\"Yeah, our songs aren't so frantic now, they have more feeling to them,\" Andrea agrees. \"This time around I'd be embarrassed if I came up with a bad lyric, because I had to sing it to Stephen (Street, the producer of the new album).\"\n\n\"We had Pat Collier for the first album, and that was right for the time,\" Harley says, diplomatically. \"But when we started recording the second album with him, we realised we needed a change. Stephen was really good for us: he'd tell us we weren't doing what we're capable of, he wanted us to come out more.\"\n\nAndrea: \"It's not that you're not trying to be yourself, it's just that sometimes you don't have any confidence to bring yourself out, especially with singing and playing music. If you're in a studio and there isn't someone going \"Yeah, that's really good, make it more like that\", then it's very difficult. That's why Stephen was so good, he brought us out of ourselves.\"\n\nWould you say that the praise you got affected you more than the criticism?\n\nAndrea: \"Yeah, because with criticism you just look at and think, \"Oh, that's right let's carry on\". A good album can sometimes cripple a band in that respect.\"\n\n\"More tea, vicar?\"\n\nAndrea pours out another cup, too milky for my taste.\n\nLet's be momentarily blunt, What's the new single about?\n\n\"It's horrible when people ask you what a song is about. It's about people putting you down,\" Andrea says. \"It makes no difference to me. You can twist me as much as you like, but I feel nothing. I've taken so much, I'm not listening anymore. Go ahead!\"\n\nThat's not the single though.\n\n\"No, we just want it to be,\" Harley explains. I can't think of a higher accolade awarded to a journalist in eons, than to have such a magnificently tempestuous pop song inspired by their negativity.\n\nAndrea: \"Our songs are never actual events - like my little dog died last year - but about feelings. \"Tiny Machine\" is about these tiny machines inside me, every organ inside me - how small we really are, how life doesn't really make sense, but how I'm still important to some people.\"\n\nLike Pop once said: life is as important as you choose to make it.\n\nHarley: \"The album's title (\"Crawdaddy\") is the name of the nightclub which was the site for a famous meeting between The Beatles and the Stones in 1963. It's also the title of the US underground magazine, named after the club, while craw is the crop of an insect or bird.\"\n\n\"You can see Harley's done his research, \"Andrea notes, teasingly.\n\n\"We were going to call the album \"Belladonna\",\" she reveals, \"but the first thing everyone thinks of is 'Beautiful woman'.\" \"Beautiful woman? Why? Surely belladonna is deadly nightshade or somesuch?\n\nAndrea: \"Exactly: that's why we liked it.\"\n\nHarley: \"Belladonna is Spanish for beautiful woman. So people might have thought we were putting Andrea on a pedestal, rather than under a pedestal.\"\n\nWhat's your most memorable experience as a Bud?\n\n\"Our first john Peel session,\" Andrea replies instantly. \"it was my birthday, and Harley rang me to tell me, and I just burst out crying. Harley had paid to have all these singles pressed (with the pension he'd earned from jacking in his engineering apprenticeship) and he'd sent them out to everyone, and it was Peel who first picked up on it. I was just so excited doing that: it was only the second studio we'd ever been in.\"\n\n\"But that was with the band,\" Harley reminds her. \"Apart from that, it was losing my virginity. I'm not going to tell you about it. I've told far too many people and it's become smutty now.\"\n\nHarley, as had been previously noted, has a predilection for talking about matters like these and the size (or lack of) his penis. We'll try to keep a lid on it, this time round.\n\n\"Also seeing the record for the first time on vinyl,\" Andrea adds. \"You don't care about anything else for weeks on end. You want to frame it. All these mad things people do with first singles - like making clocks of them - you can see why. It's a bit of history.\"\n\nWhen the Buds are on tour, their drinks rider is one of the biggest I've ever encountered. A casual inspection of their drinks cabinet reveals four bottles of Martini, a bottle of Southern Comfort, passport scotch, a few litres of wine and various sundry items. Yet they still have a reputation for being - oh, I dunno - fey?!\n\n\"When we played The Marquee the last time, we were so totally pissed, it was frightening,\" Andrea reveals \"I know how bad it was, bit I can't remember being on stage. I was singing verses in choruses, and I dropped the radio mike and couldn't find it cos there was so much confetti on the floor. People were blaming other people for us, because we didn't eat anything and all we could do was drink. And to cap it all, Epic brought along four bottles of champagne!\"\n\nHarley: \"All I remember is Kevin pushing me back on stage telling me I had to play another song and giving me hell for not being able to play all the others. Now, how was I supposed to play another one when I couldn't play all the others? CBS America came over to see us and walked out, while our merchandise guy thought it was the best thing we'd ever done.\"\n\nAndrea: \"I hardly ever drink at home because I drive all the time (she's the only member of the Buds who can drive), so that's why it affects me so much when I go away. One sniff of a wine gum and that's it.\"\n\nWhat advice would you give your kids about appearing on a pop show?\n\nAndrea (adopting patronising tone): \"Don't swear because there's about 40 million people watching you!\"\n\n\"Every time we appear on TV,\" she continues, \"we're always told that. It's okay miming, but when you're asked questions, it makes you feel like a dummy. If you're talking to Sarah Greene, you can't exactly go (leaning forward), Well, f*** me, Sarah, that's a really good question!\"\n\n\"So they ask you things about touring, and you just go (looks delightfully dumb), Yeah.\"\n\nHarley: \"Once we were asked to lick lollipops down by the dock, so we do (Harley imitates licking in a particularly gross manner) and somebody comes and hits us round the head, and tells us we're not going to be on TV again if we do that. What can you do?\"\n\nAndrea: \"The best thing was when we were on \"Wackaday\" and they asked us where our name came from. We said \"Shakespeare\", and then we all started going \"rough winds do shake\" and all this. So our interviewer asked us what a rough wind was, and we'd be going \"Oh yeah, Harley's a rough wind\" and the whole conversation turned to farting. He was trying to steer it away the whole time, but he couldn't.\"\n\nPop said: \"Stick with me and I'll make you a star. Oh, even if I don't, we'll have a few memorable moments along the way.\" So, we did.\n\nTiny Machine review -Melody Maker, May 26, 1990 by David Stubbs\n\nI thought the winter of a discerning public's discontent had long since nipped this lot in the Bud. They're back however, with a song that may well be far and away their best effort, but is still piss weak. Andrea Bud's vocals are still very prissy, polished, just so and prim, as if she's telling on the boys for chewing gum in class. Musically, they've got a bit of a production job in, but it scarcely enhances their tentative, unadventurous sound - it's a case of the suit wearing them, rather than them wearing the suit. What's most annoying is how utterly un-blonde it all is - about as blonde as lump of treacle, in fact.\n\nTiny Machine release announcement - Melody Maker, May 19, 1990\n\nThe Darling Buds release a new single \"Tiny Machine\", through Epic on May 21. Written by vocalist Andrea and guitarist Harley, it come from the new album, which is due out in the summer. The B-side is \"Me? Satisfied?\", while the 12-inch and CD additionally feature a remix of the A-side and another new track, \"Sugar City\".\n\nBoth the single and album were produced by Stephen Street, who also co-wrote \"Me? Satisfied?\". The single features new drummer Jimmy Hughes, from Liverpool, who has previously worked with Black.\n\nAndrea said this week \"When Bloss left the band, we were in the studio recording the album, and we needed a new drummer, Ian McNabb of the Icicle Works suggested Jimmy to us. We tried him out and after his session, we decided to use him for the rest of the LP. And now, like all Scousers, we can't get rid of him.\"\n\nNews release - Melody Maker, March 17, 1990\n\nThe Darling Buds, currently in Milton Keynes recording their new album, \"Belladonna\", have confirmed that Mike Bloss has vacated the drum stool to become manager of the band.\n\nAndrea Bud told the Maker: \"The decision was taken after we recently pulled out of our management deal. We'd been having a lot of problems with the management and when they left and Bloss expressed his interest in the job, we thought, Why not? He knows us better than anybody else.\"\n\nThe band have found a new drummer, Jimmy Hughes who's played with Pete Wylie, Black and The Icicle Works.\n\nCommenting on the LP title, Andrea said \"If you look in the dictionary, Belladonna means deadly nightshade but in Spa"
