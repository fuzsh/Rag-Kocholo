Climie Fisher’s other hit, ‘Love Changes Everything’ regained some lost ground as it had fallen from 2 to 4 last week, but this week it moved back up 1 to sit at 3.\n\nThe climber of the week was Richard Jon Smith’s ‘(My Hometown) Meadowlands’ which moved up 7 from 29 to 22. It was Smith’s 7th time with the award. [Spoiler alert] Sadly, this would be the last time we saw a local song pick up the award. In total we had seen 212 times a local song was the climber of the week and Barbara Ray had been the artist who had managed the most as she had picked up the award 10 times. Billy Forrest was second with 8 and Richard Jon Smith shared 3rd place with Bobby Angel, both having managed 7.\n\nThe other star raters this week were Robert Palmer’s ‘Simply Irresistible’ (up 4 from 10 to 6) and Kylie Minogue’s ‘Got To be Certain’ (up 5 from 19 to 14 and the climber within the top 20). Midnight Oil’s ‘Beds Are Burning’ was the faller both within the top 20 and the top 30 as it dropped 5 from 13 to 18.\n\nThere was no movement on or off the top 20 so Billy Ocean’s ‘Get Outta My Dreams, Get Into My Car’ ticked over to 6 weeks as the oldest in that part of the chart having spent 22 weeks there. It was also the oldest in the top 30, sharing that honour with Men Without Hats’ ‘Pop Goes The World’ with both songs having been in the charts for 24 weeks.\n\nFor a 6th time in 1988 and a 40th time overall we saw no movement on or off the charts. The 6 in a calendar year equalled the record we had seen back in 1984.\n\nBoth Climie Fisher and Cinema reached 30 weeks in the charts and they had both managed this without ever seeing a biggest faller award. They were the 49th and 50th acts to manage this. Belinda Carlisle was one of those 50 acts, but she was now celebrating 40 weeks with no biggest faller. Only 17 acts had managed this.\n\nMidnight Oil’s ‘Beds Are Burning’ became the 4th song by an Aussie act to reach 20 weeks in the charts. Also reaching this milestone was Climie Fisher’s ‘Love Changes Everything’.\n\nRichard Jon Smith reached the 80 weeks in the chart milestone. He was the 52nd act overall to get there and the 5th local one. He sat now 3 behind The Staccatos who were in 4th place on the local weeks count list.\n\nClimie Fisher had now had 2 in the charts for 10 straight weeks and they were the 16th act to manage such a run. Jennifer Rush was the only one of the 16 to have manged 2 such runs. The record run had been 26 weeks which Modern Talking had managed, so Climie still had a lot of work to do if they wanted to break that record.\n\nThe Pet Shop Boys saw their top 20 weeks total move on to 80 and they were the 39th act to reach this milestone. Meanwhile Tiffany celebrated 30 straight weeks of featuring in the top 20. Her run had consisted of 18 weeks with ‘I Think We’re Alone Now’ followed by 4 weeks where it was joined by ‘Could’ve Been’ and then a further 8 weeks with just ‘Could’ve Been’. She was the 23rd act to manage such a run and there would only be 1 further act who would manage this.\n\nYoutube playlist:"
