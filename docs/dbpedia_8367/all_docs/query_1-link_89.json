        "text": "Naked Eyes was an Eighties synthpop duo, best known for their first single, a cover of the Burt Bacharach / Hal David standard \"(There's) Always Something There to Remind Me\" (Bacharach himself has cited the cover as a personal favourite). The song reached number one in the UK in 1964 for Sandie Shaw. Some versions of this song (including that of Naked Eyes) have the word \"(There's)\" dropped from the title.\n\nThe group consisted of childhood friends from Bath, England, Pete Byrne on vocals and Rob Fisher on keyboards. The two had formerly played in a band called Neon with future members of Tears for Fears and stayed together as a duo after the group broke up.\n\nTheir second and third singles, \"Promises, Promises\" and \"When the Lights Go Out\", were also hit singles. However, their second album, Fuel for the Fire and the single \"(What) In the Name of Love\", were not as well-received and the group broke up soon after its release. Byrne ended up doing session work (he is heard on Stevie Wonder's \"Part-Time Lover\" and wrote and produced \"I Am the Cute One\" for Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen in 1992) while Fisher joined the group Climie Fisher.\n\nFisher died August 25, 1999 from complications following stomach surgery.\n\nByrne continues to use the group name and will soon be releasing Fumbling Under the Covers, which consists of covers of Bob Dylan, The Beatles, David Bowie, and others; many of them acoustic. It will be released independently on the PJB label. Byrne released a solo album, The Real Illusion in 2001, which featured some of the last tracks he wrote with Fisher for a proposed third Naked Eyes album.\n\n(from Wikipedia - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naked_Eyes)\n\n\"The Naked Eyes\" is also a solo artist from Perth Scotland, mixing electronic and acoustic music.\n\nShow More"
