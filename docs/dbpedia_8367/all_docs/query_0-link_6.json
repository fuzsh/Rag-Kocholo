        "text": "Level 42 are an English jazz-funk band formed on the Isle of Wight in 1979. They had a number of UK and worldwide hits during the 1980s and 1990s.\n\nTheir highest-charting single in the UK was \"Lessons in Love\", which reached number three on the UK Singles Chart, and number 12 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart, upon its release in 1986. An earlier single, \"Something About You\", was their most successful chart-wise in the United States, reaching number 7 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.\n\nAfter much success as a live and studio band in the 1980s, Level 42's commercial profile diminished during the early 1990s following a series of personnel changes and musical shifts. Disbanding in 1994, the band reformed in 2001."
