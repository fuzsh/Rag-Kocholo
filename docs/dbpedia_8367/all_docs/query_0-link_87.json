        "text": "The eighties was a period of time when music was at an all time high, It was very creative and had striking melodies and rhythms. For me this music stays in my mind I know the lyrics and the song but compared to today's music the 80's was in another league. I appreciate all good music and there was some great bands in the 80's. But I want to focus on the electronic side of the 80's, The sounds were produced by synthezisers and there were no real instruments as such.These musical master pieces stand out from much music, Listening to the sound just brings back that time and feeling for me. The tracks were created in my mind perfect, some tracks just have that impossible chord that surprise first chord that stimulates your senses. These tracks in my mind all have that electronic vibe and feel to them. Nostalgia No, Genius maybe.\n\nHeaven 17 are an English new wave and synth pop band that formed in Sheffield in 1980. The band were a trio for most of their career, composed of Martyn Ware (Keyboards) Ian Craig Marsh (Keyboards) and Glenn Gregory (Vocals). Most of the bands music was recorded in the 1980s, This track called \"Let Me Go\" was taken from and released several months before their second album was released called The Luxury Gap, Even though I consider this an excellent song it only managed to reacha peak position of 41 just outside the top 40. But it did do significantly better on the American dance chart in 1983 spending five weeks at the no #4 position. Allmusic cites the track as a club hit that features Glenn Gregory's moody dramatic lead above a percolating vocal and synth arrangement, The track received considerable airplay on such radio stations as CKGM-AM 980 in Montreal at the time of it's release.For many years, dance-formatted WPOW-FM \"Power 96\" in Miami would play the track. Similarly, Modern Rock radio stations including KROQ-FM in Los Angeles, XETRA (91X) in San Diego-Tijuana, and WLIR-FM in Nassau-Suffolk, N.Y., would regularly play the track. It was one of the first commercial releases to feature the Roland TB-303 a bass synthesizer which later played a pivotal role in the later acid house movement.\n\nOnce there was a day\n\nWe were together all the way\n\nAn endless path unbroken\n\nBut now there is a time\n\nA torture less sublime\n\nOur souls are locked and frozen\n\nOnce we were years ahead, but now those thoughts are dead\n\nLet me go (Let me go)\n\nAll hopeless fantasies are making fools of me\n\nLet me go\n\nI walk alone, and yet never say goodbye\n\nLet me go (Let me go)\n\nChange of heart, a change of mind, and heaven fell that night\n\nLet me go\n\nI tried but could not bring\n\nThe best of everything\n\nToo breathless then to wonder\n\nI died a thousand times\n\nFound guilty of no crime\n\nNow everything is thunder\n\nDaytime, all I want is\n\nNighttime, I don't need the\n\nDaytime, all I want is\n\nNighttime, I don't need the\n\nDaytime, all I want is\n\nNighttime, I don't need the\n\nDaytime, all I want is\n\nNighttime, I don't need the\n\nGot to, got to, got to, got to let me go\n\nBa-da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da\n\nBa-da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da\n\nBa-da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da\n\nBa-da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da\n\nBa-da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da\n\nBa-da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da\n\nOoh\n\n(Repeat 2nd verse)\n\nThe best years of our lives\n\nThe hope of it survives\n\nThe facts of life unspoken\n\nThe only game in town\n\nI'll turn the last card down\n\nAnd now the bank is broken\n\nBroken\n\nThough guilty of no crime (crime)\n\nThey were the best years of our lives\n\n(Broken)\n\nTurned the last job down\n\nBa-da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da\n\nBa-da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da\n\nBa-da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da\n\nBa-da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da\n\nBa-da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da\n\nBa-da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da\n\nOoh\n\nFrom Left To Right, Martyn Ware Born 19 May 1956, Glenn Gregory Born 16 May 1958 Lead Singer, Ian Craig Marsh, Born 11 November 1956.\n\nThe Cars were an American rock band that emerged from the new wave scene in the late 1970's, The band originated in Boston Massachusetts in 1976 with singer rhythm guitarist and songwriter Ric Ocasek, Singer somgwriter and bassist Benjamin Orr, lead guitarist Elliot Easton, Keyboardist Greg Hawkes and drummer David Robertson. The Cars were at the forefront in merging 1970's guitar oriented rock with the new synthesizer oriented pop that was then becoming popular and which flourished in the early 1980's. The Cars were named \"Best New Artist\" in the 1978 Rolling Stone Readers poll and won \"Video of the year\" for \"You Might Think\" at the first MTV Video Awards in 1984. Their debut album, \"The Cars\" sold six million copies and appeared on the Billboard 200 album chart for 139 weeks. The band broke up in 1988 and Ocasek later discouraged talk of a reunion. Sadly Orr died in 2000 from Pancreatic cancer.\n\nHeartbeat City is the fifth studio album by American rock band The Cars, Released in 1984, it was produced by Robert John \"Mutt\" Lange, Picking up a positive commercial response the Cars had many tracks getting airplay and singles \"Drive\" and \"You Might Think\" in particular both became Top 10 hits. When the Cars performed at \"Live Aid\" they played Four songs from the album (\"You Might Think\") \"Drive\" plus the albums title track, and fan favorite \"Just What I Needed\".\n\nThe cover art work for the Album is from a 1972 piece by Peter Phillips called Art-O-Matic Lopp di Loop. An image of a Plymouth Duster 340 from 1971 is also visible. The original Plymouth Duster is a semi fastback two door coupe version of the compact sized Plymouth Valiant automobile that was marketed by Plymouth in the U.S. from 1970 to 1976 model years. The Duster had a sporty body style and $15 million was invested into the upgrade for the 1970 model, The Duster was built on the Valiant platform and shared the same front end sheet metal, but featured a different design from the cowl back.\n\nHeartbeat City is the closing track on the album and was also performed at Live Aid in 1985. The song is in the key of A minor with a verse progression of A Minor, D minor and E Minor. The synthesizer theme emphasizes the sevenths and ninths of the chords, There is a prechorus of repeating D minor and E Minor leading to the chorus. The chorus is a two chord sequence of F major seventh and a slash chord G/G. There is an instrumental break which begins with a bass solo by Benjamin Orr over a Dsus2 chord, followed by a guitar synthesizer solo by Elliot Easton over the verse progression. The third verse is not followed by a chorus, it repeats as the song fades.\n\nHeartbeat City has been described retrospectively as \"Ethereal\" and as a \"highlight\" by ALLMusic critic Greg Prato. Donald Guarisco also of AllMusic said the track was a memorable effort in the vein of atmospheric moodpieces. A hypnotic bit of new wave that mixed impressionistic lyrics with an entrancing electronic soundscape, The track managed to peak at 75 on the Music charts for the UK AND 75 IN Australia..\n\nHeartbeat is an interactive sculpture\n\nA heart shaped sculpture installation that glows to the rhythm of a heartbeat and encourages visitors to bang out there own ballads was unveiled at Father Duffy Square Times Square New York. The sculpture named Heartbeat is described by it's creators as an \"Urban Drum\" it incorporates six instruments including a xylophone and a South American drum called a tumbadora on which visitors can interact and create their own melodies. Rather fittingly for a name Artist's Sara Valente and her husband Marcelo Ertorteguy created the sculpture, Valente also has a Brooklyn based art company Stereotank. The 9 by 6 foot interactive heart naturally produces a deep heartbeat sound, But as soon as visitors start playing the beat stops so that people can here the melody they produce. Described as a melting pot of heartbeat sounds, just like New York City.\n\nThe Cars - Heartbeat City - Side 2 Track no 10.

The duo formed in 1981 after Clarke responded to an advertisement placed in a UK music magazine. The pair already knew each other vaguely from there school years. Over the next 18 months the duo created two albums (Upstairs at Eric's) and (You and Me Both). Both albums received critical acclaim for their production particularly the blending of Clarke's synthesizer melodies with Moyet's blue and soul influenced vocals.\n\nYazoo enjoyed worldwide success and three of there singles reached the top three of the UK Singles Chart and both albums made the top two of the albums chart. In North America they are best known for the song \"Situation\" originally only a B Side in the UK, This track became a club and radio hit in the US and Canada before being released as the band's debut single in North America.\n\nDespite there success the band split acrimoniously in May of 1983 due to a combination of Clarke's reluctance to make more records under the Yazoo name, A clash of personalities and a lack of communication between the pair. Clarke went on to form Erasure which was another successful synthpop duo, Moyet embarked on a solo career which was also successful.\n\nYazoo as a band was brief but it's combination of electronic instrumentation and soulful female vocals has been cited as an influence on the house music scene that emerged in the mid 1980's. In 2008, 25 years after splitting up Clarke and Moyet reconciled and reformed Yazoo to play a successful tour of the UK,Europe and North America in support of the reissue of Yazoo's two studio albums and a box set of their material. Moyet had spent her teens singing in various punk and blues bands in her home town of Basildon.\n\nHouse music is a genre of Electronic dance music created by DJs and music producers in Chicago. Early house music was generally characterized by repetitive 4/4 beats, Rhythms were mainly produced by drum machines that included off-beat hi-hat cymbals and synthesized bass lines. House music is more electronic and mimimalistic even though it displays some characteristics to the Disco sound. The Disco and soul sound has definitely influenced House music, It's mechanical and repetitive sound was one of its main components and many tracks were instrumental with none or virtually no vocals, Many famous artists have incorporated house music into there work including Paula Abdul, Madonna CeCe Peniston, Kylie Minogue and Janet Jackson to name a few. They started to use this style of sound and implementation from the 1990's and beyond. House moved onto greater success with progressive house from 1999-2001. The house style has also fused into other popular subgenres notably, ghetto house, deep house, future house and tech house. House music remains popular today and retains a foothold on the underground scene worldwide. Popular drumkits used at the time were the Roland TR-808 AND tr-909.\n\nRoland TR-808 was released in 1980 by Roland Corporation but was discontinued in 1983. This model attracted a cult status among underground musicians due to it's affordability ease of use and idiosyncratic sounds and Particularly it's deep booming bass drum. A cornerstone of the emerging electronic dance and hip hop genres.It has been used on more hit records than any other drum machine. Marvin Gaye's track Sexual Healing used the machines sound and Afrika Bambaataa used it also with the track Planet Rock.\n\nWhen Alison Moyet placed an advert in the UK weekly music magazine \"Melody Maker\" in late 1981 she was surprised to of only received a single reply who was Vince Clarke. Clarke had stunned the music press when he suddenly quit \"Depeche Mode\" after their debut album and three hit singles. Clarke had wrote most of the songs for the album and it was released on 5th October 1981. This album was heavily influenced by Clarke and as a result the sound is much lighter in tone and melody compared to Depeche Modes later albums. Martin Gore took over the writing for Depeche Mode writing almost all the bands material, Later albums written by him would explore darker subjects and melodies.\n\nMelody Maker front cover published on 28th Novenber 1981.\n\nClarke and Moyet grew up in the same town and attended the same Saturday music school when they were eleven years old but did not know each other well and had never spoken to each other before. Moyet had attended classes with Martin Gore and Andy Fletcher but had little contact with Clarke. Clarke was worried that he might lose his record deal with Mute Records because of his leaving Depeche Mode, He had wrote the song \"Only You\" but needed someone to demo it, Thats when Clarke spotted the advert from Moyet and contacted her.\n\nThe name Yazzo was taken from the specialist blues record label, Yazoo Records according to Moyet. Unfortunately this created a $3.5 million lawsuit threat by the label over the bands name, The name Yazoo was also in use by a small American rock band, The band eventually changed the name of Yazoo to Yaz for the North American market. \"Only You\" was released in the UK in March of 1982 and rose to number two on the UK singles chart.\n\nThe duo recorded their debut album at Blackwig Studios in south east London the same studio where Depeche Mode had recorded Speak & Spell the previous year. Most of the album was recorded during the early mornings as the studio had already been booked out during the day by fellow mute artist Fad Gadget.\n\nGadget was a British avant garde electronic musician and vocalist. He was a proponent of both New wave and early industrial music, Fusing together a unique blend of pop structured records mixed with mechanised experimentation. As Fad Gadget, his music was characterised by the use of synthesizers in conjunction with sounds of found objects, including Drills, and electric razors. hHis bleak sarcastic and darkly humorous lyrics were filled with biting social commentary towards subjects as machinery, industrialisation, consumerism, human sexuality, mass media, religion, domestic violence, and dehumanization while often being sung in a deadpan voice. He was the first artist to sign to Mute Records\n\nFad Gadget born Francis John Tovey was born on 8th September 1956 and died 3rd April 2002. Sadly Fad passed away of a heart attack.\n\nIndustrialization example of a Steel Works NE England.\n\nArtist Fad Gadget, Album Incontinent, Released in 1981, This is his second album, Track 9 - Plain Clothes 4.40s\n\nClarke had expected that Daniel Miller would produce the album, but discovered that Miller was already otherwise occupied, So Blackwig studio owner Eric Radcliffe ended up carrying out production duties with Clarke and Moyet, Thus the name \"Upstairs at Eric's\" is in recognition of Radcliffe's input. Only You was released as Yazoo's second single in North America and reached number 67. \"Upstairs at Eric's\" was released in August 1982 peaking at number two on the UK album chart. It went on to sales of 300,000 and achieved platinum status. In the US initial sales were more modest and the album peaked at no 92 on the Billboard 200 album chart. But by 1989 seven years after it's release word of mouth had helped to push the album to platinum status and achieved over 1 million sales.\n\nClarke formed the British synthpop project in 1983 called The Assembly, after leaving Yazoo, He teamed up with Eric Radcliffe who was provided song scripts and production methods. The Assembly never became a full fledged band and resulted in only one single release, The UK hit \"Never Never\" Former undertones frontman Feargal Sharkey was hired to sing on the track. In May 2011 Sharkey appeared on stage during the Erasure set at Mute Records Short Circuit music festival for a one off performance of \"Never Never\" with Clarke.\n\nThe Assembly - Never Never (Extended 12\" Version)\n\nOriginally released in 1983, The Assembly featured Vince Clarke, E.C Radcliffe and guest vocals in the form of Feargal Sharkey.\n\nFeargal Sharkey was Born on 13th August 1958 and is from Norther Ireland. He is most widely known as the lead vocalist of the pop punk band \"The Undertones\" from the 1970's and 1980's. His smash hit \"A Good Heart\" was an international success and released in 1985. This being Sharkeys only number one single. Written by Maria Mckee about her relationship with Tom petty and the Heartbreakers keyboardist \"Benmont Tench\" and was produced by Eurythmics front man David A Stewart.\n\nSide two Track 3 Zoolockologie,released 3oth November 1984. Zoolock is the seventh studio album by French electronic musician and composer Jean Michel Jarrr, Released on the Disques Dreyfus label in 1984. It makes extensive use of digital recording techniques and sampling. Much of the music is built up from singing and speech in 25 different languages along with synthesizers such as the (Fairlight CMI) as well as more traditional instruments. Born on 24th August 1948 Jarre is a pioneer in the electronic ambient and new age genres. He is known for organising outdoor spectacles featuring his music with huge laser displays and fireworks.\n\nYazoo, \"Only You\", Written by Vince Clarke while with Depeche Mode, Released as Yazoo's first single on 15th March 1982 in the United Kingdom.

Created by Ralf Dorper who is a also a member of the German industrial band \"Die Krupps). As a trio the band consisted of Andreas Thein and Vocalist Susanne Freytag, The initial recordings were made in Germany but were destined for a UK release later on.\n\n\"Nobody felt the need to sing. It was only slogans we’d shout out. For us, everything went without saying, everything felt natural. It was all about attitude. ...\n\nCo-founder of Propaganda Andreas Thein died while battling with Cancer, He was 59 years old. Thursday 30th May 2013\n\nRadio DJ John Peel and Journalist Chris Bohn gave critical acclaim to Ralf Dorpers early experimental recordings. Classically trained musician and composer Michael Mertens and singer Claudia Brucken were also involved in the creative output, Brucken had worked with Freytag previously in another musical group called \"The Topolinos\", It was music journalist Paul Morley who signed Propaganda to the newly formed music label ZTT Records.\n\nClaudia Brucken, Photo taken by Gilbert Blecken in 2001. Claudia was born on 7 December 1963 in Berching Bavaria, She fronted the group Propaganda.\n\nPaul Morley Born 26 March 1957 Farnham, Surrey, England, UK, He signed Propaganda to ZTT\n\nPropaganda eventually relocated to the United Kingdom and released there first mainstream single called \"Dr Mabuse\" which faired very well reaching a UK chart position of 27. Dr Mabuse was named after a fictional character made famous by filmmaker Fritz Lang. The group also appeared on Channel 4's \"The Tube\" and Top Of The Pops and other various TV shows in the UK.\n\nDoctor Mabuse is a fictional character created by Norbert Jacques in the novel Dr .Mabuse der Spieler,translation (Dr. Mabuse The Gambler), First appearing in 1921 and was made famous by the three movies director Fritz Lang made about the character. Dr Mabuse is a master of disguise and telepathic hypnosis known to employ body transference, most often through demonic possession but sometimes utilizing object technologies such as television and phonograph machines to build a society of crime. Mabuse rarely commits his crimes in person, instead operating primarily through a network of agents enacting his schemes. Mabuse will have career criminals working for him, Also innocent people blackmailed people and he would also hypnotise victims. He also used dupes who would have no idea they were being manipulated and carry out tasks not intended. Mabuse can change identity also, If he is defeated and sent to a jail asylum or the grave he will appear later on as a new Dr Mabuse as depicted in The Testament of Dr Mabuse. The replacement invariably has the same powers methods of hypnosis and the same criminal genius. Some suggestions from some of Mabuse's adventures indicate that the real Mabuse is some sort of a spirit that possesses a series of hosts.\n\nDr .Mabuse first appeared in 1921.\n\nBecause of some musical indifference \"Andreas Thein\" was asked to leave the group and this brought Michael Mertens to the forefront filling the gap that Thein had left. The band now musically stable forged ahead with there creative follow up single and debut album. Unfortunately things got more difficult for the group as the label they had signed to ZTT had just signed up \"Frankie Goes To Hollywood\" a hugely successful band. As the label was still in it's infancy they ploughed all there money time and hard work into promoting FGTH so that they could get the well needed push into the music scene.\n\nFrankie Goes To Hollywood were a British band formed in Liverpool England in 1980. The group was fronted by Holly Johnson (Vocals) Paul Rutherford (Vocals) Peter Gills (Drums & Percussion) Mark O'Toole (Bass Guitar) and Brian Nash (Guitar). The bands first single was controversially banned by the BBC in 1984 while at number 6 in the UK charts because of it's obscene lyrical content. Radio one disc jockey Mike Reid expressed his distaste on air for both the records suggestive sleeve which was designed by (Anne Yvonne Gilbert) and it's lyrics. After announcing his refusal to play he was still oblivious to the fact that the BBC had already decided the track was not to be played. Regardless of the BBC's intentions not to play the single the song finally reached the no 1 spot in the UK on 22nd January 1984. The song became one of the most controversial and commercially successful records of the decade and eventually went on to sales of 2 million copies in the UK alone making it the seventh best selling single in the UK singles chart. Incredibly after FGTH released their second single \"Two Tribes\" Relax started to climb back up the charts after a declining position to rest at NO 2 behind Two tribes, this musical feat represented simultaneous chart success by a single act, unprecedented since the early 1960's. The song also won Best British Single at the 1985 Brit Awards. The song has also featured on the soundtrack to T2 Trainspotting and also in the game \"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories on the victional in game radio station called \"Wave 103\" Horn dominated the recording of Relax in his effort for perfectionism. The band were overawed and intimidated by Horn's reputation and thus were too nervous to make suggestions. Horn constructed a more electronic based version of the song with keyboards by session musician Andy Richards and with rhythm programming assistance from J.J. Jeczalik of Art Of Noise, Horn developed this version of the recording in his West London studio while the band remained in their hometown of Liverpool. Lead vocalist Johnson was the only member to perform on the record, The only contribution by the other members was a sample crafted from the sound of the rest of the band jumping into a swimming pool,\n\nMichael David Kenneth Read was born on 1st March 1947, He is an English DJ, Writer, Journalist, and television presenter, On 11th January 1984 on the Radio 1 Breakfast Show which Mike had just took over he suddenly interrupted broadcasting of the track \"Relax\" half way through and refused to play it again because of its immoral and obscene lyrics.\n\nFrankie Goes To Hollywood - Relax (1984) HD\n\nThis hiatus caused delays with Propaganda's work cycle and there debut album did not get released until 1985 titled \" A secret Wish that was released in June of that year. Trevor Horn would of helped to produce the album but was tied up with FGTH and thus did not contribute to the album but did supervise over the production. Stephen Lipson who was one of Horn's established studio engineers and Andy Richards a keyboardist took Horn's place instead.\n\nThis complicated rescheduling delaying the groups second single titled \"Duel\" until April 1985. This track is perhaps the groups most recognizable track and it was also their highest charting single in the UK charts reaching no 21. The track was also used by the World Rally Championship (WRC) in 2005 as the theme music and the alternative version \"Jewel\" was used by the BBC for Top Gear RAC Rally Report programmes in the late 1980's.\n\nPHOTO: 2005 WRC RALLYE MONTE CARLO, ROMAN KRESTA - JAN TOMANEK - FORD FOCUS (MK1) RS 04\n\nA Secret Wish is Propagandas debut album that was released by ZTT Records in 1985. Duel is placed at track 4 on the A Side called WITHIN, Length 4.43s, The album contained 9 tracks, 4 on side A and 5 on Side B.\n\nIn may 1985 the band had the opportunity to headline The Value of Entertainment\" which was a series of showcase gigs of ZTT Signings held at Ambassadors Theatre in London. The shows also featured \"Art of Noise\" Anne Pigalle, Andrew Poppy and Instinct. Propaganda were joined on stage by Simple Minds bassist Derek Forbes and ex Japan drummer Steve Jansen. Duel is the second single from Propaganda that was included on their first album called \"A Secret Wish\" Jewel (Rough Cut) is the alternative version and was on the B side of the record. This version delivered the same lyrics but in a more aggressive manner mainly by Susanne Freytag over a backing track of heavy beats and industrial sound effects. The song is often played at the stadium of Heart of Midlothian Football Club during home games. Ch4 used the track for it's American football coverage in the late 1980's and also by Granada TV for it's regional Granada Extra programme in the early 1990's. In August of 2007 Sophie Ellis Bextor recorded and released a cover of \"Duel\" as the B side to her single \"Today the Sun's on Us\" British singer Mandy Smith also recorded a cover version for her debut album \"Mandy\" in 1988. In 2009 UK girl group \"Dolly Rockers\" sampled the bridge and melody from \"Duel\" to form the basis for their song, \"How Did I End Up With You\"\n\nPropaganda - Duel\n\nHeart Of Midlothian Football Club regularly play the track for Home Games.

In 1985 Koto released \"Visitors\" and in an interview Maiola admitted it was his favourite song. The track contains a sample from Michael Jacksons 1984 hit \"Thriller\". The following year another track was released called \"Jabdah\" this track also had a music video which helped it to become a big hit in Germany the Netherlands and Switzerland.\n\nKoto is an Italian synthpop group that originally consisted of Anfrando Maiola and Stefano Cundari and later on with the Dutch composer Michiel van der Kuy. In 1982, Italian musician Anfrando Maiola teamed up with Stefano Cundari and Alessandro Zanni and released their first single \"Chinese Revenge\" on Cellophane Records, (Studio Veronica's label). The following year, Cundari and Zanni formed Memory Records and re-released \"Chinese Revenge\", The single proved to be very popular in Italy, sellimg over 10,000 copies. It also proved to be a minor hit in Germany and the Netherlands.\n\nKoto - Chinese Revenge\n\nBaby's Gang - Happy Song (Super Remix (1983))\n\nHappy song was also covered by Boney M the following year, Confusion may arise as both songs are similar in melody beat and vocals. Boney M was a Euro Caribbean vocal group created by German record producer Frank Farian. Originally based in West Germany, the four original members fo the group's official line up were, Liz Mitchell and Marcia Barrett from Jamaica, And Maizie Williams from Montserrat and Bobby Farrell from Aruba. The group was formed in 1976 and achieved popularity during the Disco era of the late 1970's. The band has sold more than 80 million records and is known for huge international hits such as \"Daddy Cool\" \"Ma Baker\" \"Rasputin\" Mary's Boy Child-Oh My Lord\" and \"Rivers of Babylon\".\n\nIntro\n\nMary's boy child Jesus Christ\n\nWas born on Christmas Day\n\nAnd man will live for evermore\n\nBecause of Christmas Day\n\nVerse 1\n\nLong time ago in Bethlehem\n\nSo the Holy Bible said\n\nMary's boy child Jesus Christ\n\nWas born on Christmas Day\n\nChorusTempo Change\n\nHark, now hear the angels sing\n\nA king was born today\n\nAnd man will live for evermore\n\nBecause of Christmas Day\n\nMary's boy child Jesus Christ\n\nWas born on Christmas Day\n\nVerse 2\n\nWhile shepherds watch their flocks by night\n\nThey see a bright new shining star\n\nThey hear a choir sing a song\n\nThe music seemed to come from afar\n\nChorusTempo Change\n\nHark, now hear the angels sing\n\nA king was born today\n\nAnd man will live for evermore\n\nBecause of Christmas Day\n\nMary's boy child Jesus Christ\n\nWas born on Christmas Day\n\nBobby Farrell Main Vocal Lead\n\nFor a moment the world was aglow\n\nAll the bells rang out\n\nThere were tears of joy and laughter\n\nPeople shouted \"let everyone know,\n\nthere is hope for all to find peace\"\n\nVerse 3\n\nNow Joseph and his wife, Mary\n\nCame to Bethlehem that night\n\nThey found no place to bear her child\n\nNot a single room was in sight\n\nChorusTempo Change\n\nHark, now hear the angels sing\n\nA king was born today\n\nAnd man will live for evermore\n\nBecause of Christmas Day\n\nMary's boy child Jesus Christ\n\nWas born on Christmas Day\n\nBobby Farrell's voice is the Lead Vocal.\n\nFor a moment the world was aglow\n\nAll the bells rang out\n\nThere were tears of joy and laughter\n\nPeople shouted \"let everyone know,there is hope for all to find peace\"\n\nBobby Farrell Lead Vocal\n\nOh my Lord, when in the crib they found Him\n\nOh my Lord, a golden halo crowned Him\n\nOh my Lord, they gathered all around Him\n\nTo see Him and adore\n\nFull Band are Singing\n\nOh my Lord, they had become to doubt You\n\nOh my Lord, what did they know about You\n\nOh my Lord, But they were lost without You\n\nThey needed You so bad\n\nOh my Lord, \"Farrell\" (Oh My Lord) with the child's adoration\n\nOh my lord, \"Farrell\" (Oh My Lord) there came great jubilation\n\nOh my Lord, and full of admiration\n\nThey realized what they had\n\n(until the sun falls from the sky)\n\n​\n\n​\n\nOh my Lord, \"Farrell\" (Oh My Lord) You sent your son to save us\n\nOh My Lord, \"Farrell\" (Oh My Lord)\n\n​\n\nEnd\n\n​\n\n​\n\nFrom Left to Right, Bobby Farrell, Liz Mitchell, Marcia Barrett,and Maizie Williams.\n\nBoney M. - Mary's Boy Child (Officical Video)\n\nKoto - Pulstar\n\nAround the time critics coined the term \"Spacesynth\" which combines elements of Italo disco and Space Disco. \"Visitors\" and \"Jabdah\" are considered part of the genre. Spacesynth could be an excellent title for a track created with those instruments and elements. By now house and Techno music were becoming popular and Italo house began to decline in popularity. Nethertheless Koto released another single called \"Dragons Legend\" this track contained samples from the 1983 video laser arcade game that was created by Don bluth. This track proved to be a minor hit also in the Netherlands peaking at no 20.\n\nKOTO Dragon's Legend Unofficial HIGH, Released in 1988, it was their second and final single that charted, reaching No. 20 in the Netherlands.\n\nBy now Memory Records began running into financial problems. In 1989 Memory Records began releasing New Beat and House music unfortunately this was not a success on the financial front and the record company went bust. ZYX bought the rights to Memory Records, they asked a Dutch composer called Michiel van der Kuy who was a member of the spacesynth band \"Laserdance\" if he would follow the steps of Maiola and Cundari. Laserdance already had a hit under there belt with \"Humanoid Invasion\".\n\nDutch composer - Michiel van der Kuy\n\nLASERDANCE - MARS INVADERS ( Virtual Concert)\n\nLaserdance is a Dutch italo disco studio project that consisted of Erik van Vliet and Michael van der Kuy. The studio project has been categorized as part of subgenre known as \"Spacesynth\" and has been generally considered as a major influence for the subgenre and has remained popular in Europe in the mid 80's. All of the created material has basic analog synthesizers, drum machines and vocoder sounds and effects. In October 2017 Erik van Vliet posted an image to his Facebook account on which he proclaimed a new Laserdance album was being worked on, with the preliminatry release date being given as April 2018.\n\nLASERDANCE - Dead Star\n\nIn 1989 Kuy presented the first full length Koto album called \"Masterpieces\" that contained remakes of previous Koto songs. He provided and created compositions including \"Time\" Minoan War\" and \"Plain\". In the following years he released more singles including \"Acknowledge\" (1990) \"Mechanic Sense\" (1992) and \"Mind Machine\" also in 1992. The main melody was inspired and clearly audible from the song \"Disco Maniac\" by Baby's Gang.\n\nKoto - Time - 1989\n\nIn 1992 Michiel van der Kuy published another Koto album, This second outing was called \"From The Dawn Of Time\" which was composed entirely by himself. He also released two cover albums in 1990 and 1993. After this injection of new and freshly remixed material Koto fell silent and nothing else was released. It was revealed that Stefano Cundari had died from cancer in 1990 sadly. In 2001, Maiola bought back the rights to the Koto name and has released three more singles under the Koto name. He is also working with Roberto Bisca and Alex Cundari to compose new material.\n\nStefano Cundari is far right wearing a yellow top, Sadley Stefano died from Cancer in 1990.\n\nFiction Factory was a Scottish new wave band from Perth in Scotland and formed in 1983. The band are widely known to mainstream audiences for their debut single \"Feels like Heaven\", This song peaked at No 6 in the UK singles chart spending 9 weeks solid in the top 40. Written by Eddie Jordan and Kevin Patterson. Before Fiction factory was in it's intimacy Kevin Patterson (Vocals), Eddie Jordan (Keyboards), Grant Taylor (Trumpet) and Chic Medley (Guitar) played in a skinhead ska band called \"The Rude Boys\" It was later shortened to RB'S.\n\nCBS asked the musicians to create a concert playing band, for this they enlisted Graham McGregor (Bass) and Mike Ogletree (Drums and Percussion) Ogletree was a former member of \"Simple Minds\" and \"Cafe Jacques\". The track \"Feels Like Heaven\" was produced and reached top 10 status in Germany and Switzerland. Unfortunately \"Fiction Factory\" disbanded in 1987 after the release of their second album \"Another Story\" which was released in 1985 on the Virgin label. Keith Patterson left the music industry soon afterwards and now works in an IT department of the university of Dundee. In 2011, Paterson, Medley, McGregor and Jordan reformed the band for the first time since 1987 for their performance at the 2011 Rewind Festival.\n\nFiction Factory members, Paterson, Medley, McGregor and Jordan performing \"Feels (Like Heaven\") at the 2011 Rewind Festival at the Scotland at Scone Palace in Perthshire Scotland on Sunday 31st July 2011. Fiction Factory also played at Temple Island Meadows, Remenham, Berkshire near Henley-on Thames, Capesthorne Hall, Chesire England on 20th August 2011 Main stage.\n\nThe line up for the 1983 album was Kevin Patterson (Vocals)(1983–1987, 2011)\n\nChic (Charles) Medley: guitars (1983–1987, 2011)\n\nGraham McGregor: bass (1983–1987, 2011)\n\nEddie (Edward) Jordan: keyboards (1983, 2011)\n\nMike Oglewood, (Drums and Percussion) (1983–1987)\n\nGrant Taylor: trumpet (1983–1984) (played on first album)\n\nLeslie Hunter guitar and drums (1983-1987)\n\nDario G - Feels Like Heaven\n\nThe second album included, Paul Wishart: keyboards (1985–1987) (played on second album)\n\nGraham Weir: trumpet (1985) (played on second album)\n\nJames Locke: drums and percussions (1985–1987) (played on second album)\n\nPim Jones: guitar (1985) (played on second album)\n\nMarwenna Laidlaw (1985) (backing vocalist on second album)\n\nGary O'Brien: bass (1985) (played on second album)\n\nThe track \"Feels Like Heaven\" appeared on their first album called \" Throw the Warped Wheel Out\" The track was a huge hit in Switzerland hitting the no2 spot on the Swiss singles chart. Fiction Factory had no notable successes beyond \"(Feels Like) Heaven which rendered the band and put them in the category of a \"One Hit Wonder\"\n\nThe song was recorded by dance act Dario G in 2003 reaching number 38 in the UK singles Chart. In 2008, the song was covered by Sylwania, a German dance project from the label Beatbox-Recordz. In February 2012, the song was covered by Matt Consola featuring Ben Holder & LFB on Swishcraft Records.This release includes remixes by Joel Dickinson, Sean Mac, Christian Poow, SpekrFreks, Chubby Fingers and Swishcraft (aka Matt Consola & LFB). In 2016 the song was performed live by Manic Street Preachers during their, Everything Must Go 20th anniversary tour. A studio recording was included on the compilation album BBC Radio 2's Sounds of the 80s, Vol. 2. Slow Moving Millie covered the song on her 2011 album \"Renditions\". In April 2008, The Hershey Company used the song in a Reese's Peanut Better Cup Commercial. In 2008, the song was covered and released as a bonus track on the album \"Werk 80 II\" By the German gothic metal band \"Atrocity\".\n\nIn April 2008, The Hershey Company used the song in a Reese's Peanut Better Cup Commercial.\n\nThe band underwent major changes to the bands members after their first album had been released. Keyboardist and writer Eddie Jordan, drummer Mike Ogletree and Bassist Graham McGregor all left the band, These departures left lead vocalist Kevin Patterson and Guitarist Chic Medley as the two remaining members. They hired guest musicians for the recording of the second album. Medley produced the album with Patterson as assistant producer, Both wrote the entire album's worth of material either together or solely, (Except) \"Lose Your Heart in Nature\" which was credited also to Wishart. The album was recorded at The Planet, Castle Sound and Amazon Studios, Liverpool, while it was mixed at Castle Sound and Amazon Studios and mastered at Ham Audio, The album spawned three singles \"Not the Only One\", \"No Time\" and \"Standing on Top of the World\". The closing track \"Victoria Victorious\" featured Fiona Carlin on lead vocals, though she has never featured on any other recording or release before or since. The entire album received very little promotion neither was there any music videos made. To make matters worse there was no TV appearances featuring the band performing any of the songs. There was an exception when the band performed \"Not the Only Me\" on the German show Musik Convoy in May 1985. The band did perform a small number of UK concerts to promote the release of the album. The album was a commercial failure as Mtv was a must for bands music to be shown and it should of been expected. The band felt they were hard pushed to produce songs that were as good as \"(Feels Like Heaven\") and there material was not producing that feel and melody of Feels Like Heaven. They may of tried \"to hard\" to produce another hit song but could'nt rely on the music itself to make it a success but they did. Patterson years later in an interview said he wanted to record \"Another Story\" as an end to the band as he had had enough of music, living in constant stress and constantly writing songs, so he disbanded the group. Maybe he should of tried for another album and put \"Feels (Like Heaven) to one side and not try and improve on that sound but to focus on new and fresh material eventually something good will come out. In recent years the album track \"Time is Right\" has grown in popularity, despite not being a single. On YouTube, it has gained 70,000 views over two videos both uploaded in 2008. The album was released in Europe only and did not feature an American release. In Europe, the album was released through Foundry Recordings/Virgin Records, however in Germany the album was issued via Instant Records. For some versions of the album, marketing was handled by RCA Records (RCA Schallplatten GmbH), others both marketing and distribution was handled by Line Music GmbH. The album soon became out of print. Another Story was only released as a vinyl LP, except in Germany where Instant Records gave a limited pressing on CD. The CD release also became out of print and today is a collectors item, often selling for prices up to £500. The CD version of Another Story featured two bonus tracks; \"Not the Only One (Long Version)\", which was the \"Extended Mix\" found on the 12\" vinyl version of the \"Not the Only One\" single and \"Let Me Be a Part\", which was the \"Not the Only One\" b-side. Although both bonus tracks aren't listed on the album's back insert, they are listed on the disc.\n\nFiction Factory taken from there second album \"Another Story\" released in 1985 titled \"Time is Right\" Track 9 , Kevin Patterson and Chic Medley. 4.05s\n\n\"Ghost of Love\" taken from the first album, Track 7 Written solely by K Patterson, 3,36s\n\nFeels (Like Heaven) taken from their first album called, \"Throw the Warped Wheel Out\" Track 1, Written by, E Jordan and K.Patterson. 3.32s\n\nInside Amazon Studios Liverpool with a SSL 4000E Series 40 loaded (48 frame) console in 1984.

Photography is by David Mcintyre who was also responsible for the bands first album. Sleeve was designed by myIDEA, The picture was taken in Mcintyre's apartment in London. Patterson had asked Mcintyre to come up with an interesting and suitable picture for the album and he did from his flat. The band never gave Mcintyre any ideas and did not want to see either. After recording was finished the band were presented with the image.\n\nPerth legends Fiction Factory are counting down to their first gig in 27 years for the Rewind Festival.\n\nThe band have specially reformed for this special event and will perform there smash hit Feels (Like Heaven) in front of a live audience of 20,000 fans.\n\nThe band's frontman Kevin Patterson can't wait to bring back the day's gone by, Especially when Human League, Nik Kershaw and Kim Wilde will also be performing some of there hit songs.\n\nPatterson was very taken back and surprised when the Rewind organizers tracked him down to ask if he could play at there festival. Patterson was 50 years old when they found him and it created a flood of memories for the 80's star. Patterson is not one for hoarding memorabilia or anything that might suggest he was a fan or had been part of the group.\n\nPatterson eventually decided he would accept the organizers proposal and with a bit of luck he thought, He just might persuade a couple of the other band members to join the festival too, Amazingly everyone agreed as they thought it would be great to get back together again a reminiscent return to the good old days. So to Pattersons delight the original Fiction Factory lineup would be playing at the festival. The guys have had quite a few rehearsals to prepare for the trip to Scotland. The songs have been reworked and Patterson admits he thinks they are better than when they did them at the time. Some of the songs have had been reworked and the arrangements have been changed, Feels Like Heaven has been left untouched as the legacy of that track can't be broken or dared to be broken by the band,\n\nPiano solo with accompanying Instruments takes the lead and intro.\n\nVerse, Heaven is closer now today\n\nThe sound is in my ears\n\nI can't believe the things you say\n\nThey echo what I fear\n\nTwisting the bones until they snap\n\nI scream but no one knows\n\nYou say I'm familiar, cold to touch\n\nAnd then you turn and go\n\nChorus, Feels like heaven, (Piano chord) Deep Base Notes (Guitar) Synthesizer tone)\n\nFeels like heaven, (Piano Chord) Deep Base notes (Guitar) Synthesizer tone)\n\nVerse 2\n\nSee how we planned for saddened eyes\n\nAnd tears to pave the way\n\nI fought the fever as I knew\n\nMy hair returned to gray\n\nStudy your face and fade the frame\n\nToo close for comfort now\n\nWe can recall the harmony\n\nThat lingered but turned sour\n\nChorus\n\nFeels like heaven\n\nFeels like heaven\n\nTempo Change\n\nYou wanted all I had to give\n\nSee me, I feel, see me, I live, Woho\n\n(Piano Lead no Singing)\n\nRapid drum beat to lead into outro\n\nFeels like heaven (Patterson Lead) (heaven is closer, heaven is closer)(Rest of Band)\n\nFeels like heaven Patterson Lead (heaven is closer, heaven is closer) (Rest of Band)\n\nFeels like heaven (Patterson Lead) (heaven is closer, heaven is closer) (Rest of Band)\n\nFeels like heaven Patterson Lead(heaven is closer, heaven is closer) (Rest of Band)\n\nFeels like heaven (Patterson Lead) (heaven is closer, heaven is closer) (Rest of Band)\n\nSongwriters: Edward Alexander Jordan / Kevin Patterson\n\n(Feels Like) Heaven lyrics © Warner/Chappell Music, Inc, Carlin America Inc\n\nA more recent image of Kevin Patterson standing outside the University of Dundee. Patterson was the lead vocalist.\n\nFrom all the original members only Mike Oglewood is still making a living from music and flew in from America where he lives now for the rehearsals. The rest of the band have gone in different directions in life after the split in 1987. Bass player Graeme McGregor a former Perth High school pupil now works as a designer of logos used on racing cars, while fellow guitarist Chic Medley has a sailing business near Edinburgh.\n\nEddie Jordan works at a hotel in Highland Perthshire.\n\nThe five piece will be joined by original backing Singer Stuart Clark.\n\nPatterson say's working with his old friends and band members has made him think that he might just get back into music again, Who knows he might write a well deserved hit single. Patterson still receives royalties for the smash hit Feels like heaven and he say's I won't be retiring on the money but it has bought me some double glazing and a conversion to my house. Feels like heaven is a particular favourite with BBC Radio 2 listeners.Patterson admits he can't believe the song has lived and stayed popular for so long, The track was written in about a day and a half shortly after he formed Fiction Factory with Jordan and Medley. The verses and the chorus were written in Eddie’s kitchen in just a couple of hours.But it came together quite quickly. We used two ghetto blasters with one playing a simple drum machine and recorded the bass line into a cassette deck and then played it back into the other ghetto blaster.Patterson say's the lyrics are similar to an anti love song, The song describes another person who is singing about someone they don't particularly like anymore. The song indicates that when your in the company of this person you feel awful, but as soon as they go you Feel Like Heaven, But the song does have a different meaning for whoever listens and they will interpret a different scenario and meaning. Patterson has no regrets about his life changes and his leaving the spotlight. He say's it would of been nice to have continued a wee bit longer but on the other hand I might not have met my wife and the people I made friends with he honestly declares.\n\nAs for the song being a one hit wonder, He say's well its better than a no hit wonder I guess!\n\nArticle taken from the Daily Record on 26th July 2011.\n\nA Flock of Seagulls\n\nA Flock of Seagulls are an English new wave and synth pop band originally formed in 1980 in Liverpool by Michael \"Mike\" Score who played (Keyboards and sang Vocals and his brother Alistar \"Ali\" James Score who played (Drums) with their most famous line -up consisting of the Score brothers along with Francis Lee \"Frank\" Maudsley who played Bass and Paul Reynolds (Guitar).\n\nPaul Reynolds from \"A Flock of Seagulls\" plays guitar.\n\nThe group had a string of international hit singles including \"I Ran (So Far Away)\" released in 1982, \"Space Age Love Song also released in 1982, \"Wishing (If I Had A Photograph of you)\" also 1982 and another notable release \"The More you Live, the More You Love\" released in 1984. The band won a Grammy Award in 1983 for their instrumental \"D.N.A\" released in 1982.\n\nA Flock Of Seagulls - The More You Live, The More You Love\n\nA Flock of Seagulls took there name from a Stranglers song titled \"Toiler on the Sea\" and also the book by Jonathan Livingston Seagull. Willie Woo was added to the bands line up to play Guitar but Alistar \"Ali\" James had a falling out with the Score brothers and was replaced by Mark Edmondson to replace him on Drums. Somehow this formation did not work either and James returned to the bands line up after Edmonsons short span as he decided to leave too. Then Woo left and was replaced by teenager Paul Reynolds, who was previously playing in a band \"Cindysbeentrippin), Reynolds was a good friend of Edmonson at the decision of Maudsley, Hopefully this swap and changing of members will create and mature the sound that the band worked hard for and to distinguish itself away from other competing bands and soundscapes.\n\nThe Stranglers - Toiler on the Sea. From the Black & White Album\n\nThe Stranglers are an English rock band who emerged via the punk rock scene, The Stranglers are one of the longest surviving and most \"Continuosly successful\" bands to have originated in the UK punk scene. Formed in Guildford in Surrey on 11th September 1974, they were originally called \"The Guildford Stranglers, there aggressive no-compromise attitude identified them as one of the instigators of the UK punk scene that followed, their idiosyncratic approach rarely followed any single musical genre and the group went on to explore a variety of musical styles fron \"New wave\" art rock,and Gothic rock through the sophisticated pop of some of their 1980s output.\n\nGothic rock is a style of rock music that emerged from the post punk in the late 1970's, The first post-punk bands which shifted towards dark music with gothic overtones include, Siouxsie and the Banshees, Joy Division, Bauhaus, and the Cure. The genre itself was defined as a separate movement from post-punk due to its darker music accompanied by introspective and romantic lyrics. Gothic rock then gave rise to a broader subculture that included clubs, fashion and publications in the 1980's.\n\nMike Scores lead vocalist for \"A Flock of Seagulls\" Mike was a hairdresser before his success and his hairdo helped to define the groups image.\n\nThe band practiced above Mike scores hair salon as Mike was a hairdresser and this makes complete sense from the creative and unique hairstyles the band embraced. The band started to play in clubs to break the ice and eventually they were offered a recording contract.\n\n1980 was a period in time when new wave sound was starting to explode on to the music scene, The band had a unique style including haircuts, Paul Reynolds guitar sound was powerfully submersive and also airy with a touch of subliminal velocity and speed, Like a few bands in the 80's a dangerous situation was to fall into the one hit wonder hole and disappear for eternity only to make a comeback 25 years later not something many bands would find appealing.\n\nA more modern Image of \"Mike Score as he looks today. Choosing a sleeker bolder look the retro and incredibly famous hair doo is long gone.\n\nScore was a talented keyboardist and he realized the opportunity to break in to the new wave bubble. The bands first single called \"It's Not Me) Talking\" through Cocteau Records was a breaking out song that ultimately lead to a major record deal with Jive Records in 1981. Before the song had been absorbed fully into mainstream listening behaviour another track was released titled \"Telecommunication\" this track being their second single to date. The track proved to be a success and found it's way on to the Billboard Dance Charts hitting number 19 before the year was out. The band released an EP titled \"Modern Love\" the following year that levitated them into a new wave dimension and stratosphere. The balloons were starting to pop when they released \"I Ran\" a fast paced song that proved to carry a special synthesizer and guitar sound all the way to the top of the charts. This song became one of the biggest hit's of 1982 reaching no 9 of the Hot 100 chart and becoming the driving force behind there self titled debut LP reaching number 10 on the billboard 200 and pushing it's vinyl grooves all the way to going Gold in the United States and was backed up by a solid Silver in their native UK.\n\nA Flock Of Seagulls - Wishing (If I Had a Photograph of You)\n\nAlbum cover for the bands very first self titled album.\n\nA Flock Of Seagulls-Telecommunication(Lyrics)\n\nMTV was also a great pressure oven which provided the band with a heavy rotational showing of the video which ultimately gave the track additional and a much more preserved shelf life. 1982 proved to be a spectacular result for the band with an iconic track and hit album, phasing into 1983 did not allow much more creative success other than there track \"Wishing (If I Had a Photograph of You\". This track carries a middle paced drum rhythm and melodic synth sound, Mike Scores vocal blends effortlessly into the sound, He sings a more saddened but opportunistic tone a vocal of critical assumption. The song could identify with someone who has lost a partner, someone who still has feelings for someone. They feel lonely and hurt they want to remember the past and a photo is something that they never did get around to taking. With a video that echoes a scene from Blake Seven and a Thing on a Spring that exemplifies that year in time. Mike's face is turned away as he sings the first verse of the song and only turns around to provide the chorus, this type of video is unique as the majority of stars want to be seen on the face for as many seconds as possible these days.\n\nAfter the Score brothers had a falling out that led to the dissolution of the band, older brother Mike re-formed the band with a brand new lineup in 1988 and even released a fifth LP, entitled \"The Light at the End of the World\" but this would prove to be unsuccessful in sales anyway but would of pleased the fans no end. The band continues to perform to this very day on the oldies circuit, but in 2013, Mike Score announced that, in addition to performing with the Seagulls, he would be launching a solo career, releasing his debut LP, Zeebratta, in 2014.\n\nIn 2017 the classic band line up announced they were reforming for a new album called \"Ascension\" The album is about to be released, and it is the first time since 1984’s The Story Of A Young Heart, to feature all four members. The Story Of A Young Heart is a brilliant album, and one that many fans list as their favourite. “I wanted that album to be a concept album. It was about my friend, who had killed himself. At the time, I kept it quiet.”\n\nThe Prague Philharmonic Orchestra are joining the band as the band are reworking some of there older songs into a orchestral format of sound.\n\nThe Prague Philharmonic Orchestra Performing in Athens. Photograph by: Sigfried Baumann, courtesy of WE Promotion\n\nThe band has been separated for over 30 years now and Mike expresses the strangeness the weird feeling he felt when playing through the old songs again. Mike say's my favourite song is \"Electrics\" from the 1983 album (Listen) and the reason is because I have not played that track for years but it still feels very strange almost as if another band had produced the song back in the early 80's.\n\nAlong with the new album is a new video for the first single from Ascension, “Space Age Love Song”. For the video, three of the members were in one room together. With technology today not everyone is essentially needed to complete a video or even an album, Streaming and other digital delivery formats are used to make things possible.\n\nScore say's rerecording the new songs is different than performing them live. “Because it was songs we knew, since we recorded them in the past, our recording went very quickly. And being in different places made it quicker too. You know there was never a time like when we are together in the same studio, and just say, ‘let’s go to the chippy’, and then record. We saved a lot of time.\n\n\"Electrics\" - A Flock Of Seagulls - Listen (1983)- Listen is the second album released in 1983. Track 5, Time 3.36s\n\nScore admits that because of the time difference and ageing of songs he has disliked some of the older tracks but when he plays live to an audience all of that goes out of the window and because the audience is enjoying the sound so much it all becomes nonsense. Someone heard Score say he disliked I Ran (So Far Away) but it was just for the moment he hated that song on a rare moment but really he loves the song and all of the other songs too.\n\nScore emphasizes the difficulties some bands experience trying to break out on to the scene, He advises artists to play live and as many as possible in many varying places, Trying to sign a major deal is harder today than it was. Score does not have a record deal he much prefers to play live and put out a record that he justifiably thinks deserved to be put out. Playing live embodies the sound that was A Flock of Seagulls, and and new listeners will appreciate a live set and sound. So much has changed, even DJ's nowadays record there sets at home and then simply feed the sound into the sound amplifier once they arrive. I did an interview recently at a radio station, huge building, but when I got in there it was practically empty.”\n\nA Flock Of Seagulls always wrote and recorded very leodic music, but with the orchestral treatment the melodies soar. Recording their older songs with the Prague Philharmonic Orchestra does make one think of beauty, as it is a beautiful album. “We were discussing the title and we wanted something uplifting. We wanted to bring to mind ascending to heaven, something heavenly. The sleeve of the album has a UFO taking off, disturbing seagulls. The cover artwork is strongly suggesting a similarity with the very first album and this link of creative nostalgia lays firmly flat to the cover of \"Ascension\". There are no immediate plans for an original band line up, Score is happy with the members he has now and has no wishes to tour or regroup at this stage.\n\nA Flock of Seagulls are sometimes referred to with ironic appreciation. The New Musical Express wrote: \"Of course, everyone remembers this group now for singer Mike Score's ridiculous back-combed haircut and the fact that they are mentioned in Pulp Fiction. So now they're kind of cool, but in the early '80s it was a different story.\n\nThe band's lyrics have been noted to have allusions to both dystopian environments as well as dragons.\n\nTouring Members\n\nMike Score – lead vocals, keyboards, guitar (1980–1986, 1988–present)\n\nPando – bass guitar (2004–present)\n\nKevin Rankin – drums (2016–present)\n\nGord Deppe – lead guitar (2017–present)\n\nStorm of Shadows - Image taken 05 March 2008\n\nA Flock Of Seagulls - Space Age Love Song\n\nThe Fallout Club was a British synthpop and new wave band formed by Irish singer Trevor Herion and Paul Simon in 1981, The band included the experimental drummer Paul Simon, future successful Thomas Dolby played keyboards, and bassist Matthew Seligman. Herion and Simon formed the band shortly after the demise of their previous group, \"The Civilians\", while Dolby was in Bruce Woolley and The Camera Club. Seligman was a member from the band \"The Soft Boys\". The Soft Boys was a rock band led by Robyn Hitchcock primarily during the 1970's. \"The Fallout Club only released a handful of tracks before it's demise, These were, Falling Years/The Beat Boys, Dream Soldiers, Pedestrian Walkway, Wonderlust/Desert Song, These tracks were released on the (Happy Birthday Records label in 1981 respectively.\n\nFallout Club - Dream soldier\n\nAfter the split, Dolby went solo, Simon went to work with Glen Matlock, Seligman joined \"The Thompson Twins\" and Herion also went solo, Trevor Herion born, John Trevor Herion in April of 1959, Died October 1, 1988, He was an Irish singer born in Cork who formed part of the punk and new wave movement in the 1970's leading up to the 80's. He later on tried to become successful as a solo artist but failed and died shortly afterwards.\n\nThomas Dolby\n\nDuring the late 1970's, he was a lead singer in a locally successful band called \"The B-52's\" who later changed their name to \"The Puritans\" on discovering the existence of the similarly named US band. Failure to land a recording contract meant the band’s dissolution but shortly after he was called to join as singer in a new wave band called \"The Civilians\" comprised by Paul Simon on drums, Mark Scholfield on guitar and Michael French on bass. The band only released two singles \"Made For Television/I See My Friends (Arista, November 1979) produced by Andy Arthurs. This band also split with Schofield and French forming yet another band called \"Academy One\".\n\nJohn Trevor Herion\n\nThe Fallout Club - Pedestrian Walkway\n\nAfter Fallout Club had broken up, Herion went solo and released a handful of singles but his album \"Beauty Life\" 1983 proved to be a failure, The album was produced by Steve Levine. Nevertheless, an argument over the unauthorized remixing of a 7\" version resulted in Levine taking his name off the album and refusing to promote it.\n\nDuring the 1980s Trevor began to suffer from severe depression which eventually overcame him, leading to his tragic suicide on 1 October 1988.\n\nRobert Gaul\n\nFritz \"Freddie\" Brocksieper (born August 24, 1912 in Istanbul, Turkey; died January 17, 1990) was a German jazz-musician, drummer, and bandleader.\n\nRobert Gorl was born in Munich on June 15th 1955 and is a German musician. He is best known for his work with Deutsch Amerikanische Freundschaft (D.A.F.) and for his solo recordings, particularly Night Full Of Tension and \"Darling Don't Leave Me\" (together with Annie Lennox) Gorl started his life in an orphanage, at the age of 18 Gorl got drum lessons from the Jazz musician \"Freddie Brocksieper. In 1974 he started a classical music education at the Leopold Mozart Conservatory in Augsburg and in 1976 at the music - University of Graz concentrating on Jazz. In 1978 he decided to break from his studies and went to London and became interested in punk rock, In the same year he met Gabriel \"Gabi\" Delgado-Lopez in Die Ratinger Hof in Dusseldorf and formed DAF, Gorl also played in other bands such as Der Plan. Görl began a solo career with the cult favourite ‘Mit Dir’ in 1983.\n\nDAF’s punky ethos became fully realised thanks to the availability of newly affordable synthesizer technology from Japan. Attaching the powerful sound to heavy rhythms and Teutonic expression, the energetic aggression of the music reflected their militaristic aesthetic, as exemplified by songs like ‘Der Mussolini’ and’ Kebabträume’.\n\nRobert Görl recorded seven albums with DAF from 1979 - 2003 In 1982 DAF received the \"Deutscher Schallplatten Preis\" (German Music Award) for their album Alles ist Gut.\n\nRobert Görl • Mit Dir (1983)\n\nThe first DAF break was in 1983 at their musical peak.\n\nIn 1984, Robert Görl recorded his first solo album Night Full of Tension (Mute Rec), working with Annie Lennox of the \"Eurythmics\" Gorl also played drums on the 1981 Eurythmics album \"In The Garden\".\n\nDAF reformed in 1985 to record 1st Step to Heaven (Dean/Ariola Rec)\n\nIn 1989 Gorl suffered a serious car accident, became a Buddhist and travelled for three years studying in Asia, Afetr his return he recorded several albums and singles on the Munich techno label Disko B.\n\nDAF reformed again in 2000 and recorded Fünfzehn neue D.A.F-Lieder (15 New D.A.F-Songs) in early 2003. They split again in 2005. In 2008 they reformed for their 30th-anniversary tour, 30 Jahre DAF (Der 30-jährige Krieg), and recorded the single \"Du bist DAF\" (\"You are DAF\") in 2010.\n\nRobert Görl - Wind in Hair\n\nNaked Eyes is a British new wave band that rose to prominence in the early 1980's, Originally a duo, the band is known largely for it's four US top 40 singles.\n\nThe first was a cover of the \"Burt Bacharach-Hal David standard \"There'a Always Something There To Remind Me\". The band has subsequent hits with their own compositions, \"Promises, Promises\" (Not to be confused with the Bacharach-David musical number). \"When the Lights Go Out,\" and \"(What) In the Name of Love.\"\n\nNaked Eyes - No Flowers Please\n\nNaked Eyes was formed by two college friends from Bath, England. The band features Pete Byrne on vocals and Rob Fisher on keyboards. The two had formerly played in a band called \"Neon\" which also featured future members of \"Tears for Fears\".\n\nNaked eyes was one of the first bands to make significant use of the Fairlight CMI sampling synthesizer on a recording. Peter Gabriel and Kate Bush had used the instrument on prior effects but the usage had been far less than what Naked Eyes would employ on their effort.\n\nThe debut album \"Burning Bridges\" was produced by Tony Mansfield, along with the follow up album \"Fuel for the Fire\" which also featured two titles produced by Arthur Baker. Their second single and third singles \"Promises Promisese\" (the 12\" mix of which features vocals from Madonna) and \"When the Lights Go Out\" were also hit singles.\n\nNaked Eyes - When The Lights Go Out\n\nFollowing the release of the band's second album, Byrne moved to California and immersed himself in session work. He performed on Stevie Wonders \"Part Time Lover\" sang backgrounds with Rita Coolidge and Princess Stephanie among others, and wrote and produced for the Olsen twins. Fisher also explored other projects, doing sessions in London and forming Climie Fisher with Simon Climie. The group never toured because in the early 1980s technology was not advanced enough to reproduce their multi-layered, multi-synthesizer sound in concert. According to Denis McNamara, who was the program director at New Music station WLIR during the band's heyday, this has led to a \"curiosity\" about the group over the years. Rob Fisher died on 25 August 1999, aged 42, following surgery for bowel cancer.\n\nRob Fisher founding member of - Naked Eyes\n\nNaked Eyes - Always Something There To Remind Me (Official Video)\n\nByrne released a solo album The Real Illusion in 2001, which featured some of the last tracks he wrote with Fisher for a proposed third Naked Eyes album. In 2005, Byrne put a band together to play some Naked Eyes shows and has been touring regularly since. In 2007, Naked Eyes released Fumbling with the Covers, an acoustic album which consisted of covers of Bob Dylan, The Beatles and Elvis Costello, among others, along with the \"Naked Eyes\" hits.\n\nIn the summer of 2008, Naked Eyes completed a US tour along with, Belinda Carlisle, ABC, and The Human League. In the summer of 2014, Naked Eyes did a US tour with The Go-Go's, Scandal, and The Motels.\n\nTil Tuesday was an American new wave and alternative rock band formed in Boston, Massachusetts. The band, consisting of Aimee Mann (Lead Vocals, bass) Robert Holmes (Guitar) Joey Pesce (Keyboards) and Michael Hausman (Drums) was active from 1982 to 1989. They are best known for their 1985 hit single \"Voices Carry\".\n\nTil Tuesday first gained fame six months after it's formation when it won Boston's WBCN Rock & Roll Rumble in 1983.\n\n'Til Tuesday - Voices Carry\n\nTheir original composition \"Love in a Vacuum\" (credited to all members of the group) received a fair amount of airplay on the station, and the group was eventually signed to Epic Records.\n\n\"Love in a Vacuum\" was re-recorded for the Epic debut album, 1985's \"Voices Carry\", however, the breakthrough song turned out to be the title track. The \"Voices Carry\" single peaked at number eight on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100, and is said to have been inspired by an argument between Mann and Hausman, who had broken off a relationship before the album's release. According to producer Mike Thorne on his Stereo Society web site, \"The title track was originally written and sung by Aimee as if to a woman.... The record company was predictably unhappy with such lyrics. Rolling Stone magazine would later report that Epic Records labelmate Cyndi Lauper was interested in recording \"Voices Carry\" with the original lyric, but only if the band didn't put it on their own release, The band declined.\n\n'Til Tuesday - What About Love\n\nThe band became an early MTV staple with the \"Voices Carry\" video which depicts an oppressive boyfriend trying to convert Mann to his upper-class lifestyle; she finally lashes out at him during a concert at Carnegie Hall, though filmed at the Strand Theatre in Dorchesterm Massachusetts. standing up from her seat in the audience and belting the lyrics, \"He said, shut up! He said, shut up! Oh God, can't you keep it down...?\" as she removes her cap to reveal her signature spiky, rat-tailed hair. As a result, the group won that year's MTV Video Music Award for Best New Artist. By the 1986 follow up \"Welcome Home\" Mann Mann was beginning to write more of the songs herself and the band was moving away from the slick new wave sound of their debut. But while critical reaction was generally strong, the #26 placing for the lead single, \"What About Love\", was a commercial disappointment, especially after the top-ten success of \"Voices Carry\". Even more problematic, the album just barely sneaked into the U.S. top 50, also a letdown after the #19 placing for their debut.\n\nAfter the albums release Pesceleft left the band and was replaced by Michael Montes, Guitarist Jon Brion and Clayton Scoble also joined the group. although not as permanent members.\n\nAt about the same time, Mann's two-year relationship with singer-songwriter Jules Shear, who she had been dating since the release of the Voices Carry album, came to an end. This breakup somewhat informed the band's final album, 1988's \"Everything's different Now, particularly in the song \"J for Jules\" though Mann insisted that not every song on the LP was about the relationship. Shear collaborated with Matthew Sweet on the album's title track, it also featured \"The Other End (of the Telescope)\", a collaboration between Mann and Elvis Costello on which Costello provides a guest vocal.\n\nWhile critical praise continued to flow, Everything's Different Now was not a commercial success. The album peaked at No. 124, while the lead single \"(Believed You Were) Lucky\" (co-written with Shear) reached number 95.\n\n'Til Tuesday essentially broke up after the release of Everything's Different Now. However, Mann toured under the 'Til Tuesday name with various session players, while legal problems with the band's label Epic prevented her from beginning work on a solo record for several years. (Mann's solo career officially began in 1992. Hausman, meanwhile, became Mann's manager, a position he holds to this day.\n\nTil Tuesday - Long Gone Buddy\n\nCocteau Twins were a Scottish rock band active from 1979 until 1997, They formed in Grangemouth by Elizabeth Fraser (Vocals), Robin Guthrie (Guitar, drum machine) and Will Heggie (Bass), Will Heggie was replaced by multi-instrumentalist \"Simon Raymonde\" in 1983.\n\nThe group has earned much critical praise for it's distinctive ethereal sound and the soprano vocals of Fraser, which often abandoned recognizable language altogether. They have been recognized as pioneering the 1980's subgenres of etthereal goth and dream pop and were associated with the UK label 4AD for much of their career.\n\nGuthrie and Heggie both from Grangemouth in Scotland formed the band in 1979. They frequently attended a local disco called \"Nash\" where they met Elizabeth Fraser also from Grangemouth, She would eventually provide the dreamy vocals for the bands music. The band were heavilly influenced by other musicians like so many bands for there styles and ideals, They listened to \"The Birthday Party\", Sex Pistols\" Kate Bush, and Siouxsie and the Banshees for inspiration, Fraser had Siouxsie tattoos on her arms for several years.\n\nKelpies, Grangemouth, Scotland - Massive statues of horse heads in The Helix, Falkirk\n\nThe band was named after the song \"The Cocteau Twins\" by fellow scotsmen \"Johnny and the Self Abusers\" this title did not last as it was changed to \"Simple Minds\". The song \"The Cockteau Twins\" was also re-penned and had it's title changed to \"No Cure\". The bands debut album \"Garlands\" which was released in 1982 on the 4AD label was an instant success as was the subsequent \"Lullabies EP. In 1993, the band released a second EP, \"Peppermint Pig\".\n\nCocteau Twins - 5.\"Pandora (for Cindy)\", Taken from the third studio album \"Treasure\" It was released on 1 November 1984 and is considered by fans to be their finest album.\n\nFraser's voice distinguishes itself as ethereal and operatic, Guthrie plays with increasingly guitar ladled effects who has admitted he is far more interested in the way the guitar is recorded than in the actual notes being played, though he later admitted that his reliance on effects and layering was initially due to his own technical limitations).\n\n\"The Cocteau Twins\"-Lazy Calm\n\nCocteau Twins' sound on their first three recordings relied on the combination of Heggie's rhythmic basslines, Guthrie's minimalist guitar melodies, and Fraser's voice. The band's next full-length LP Record, was called Head over Heels, Tears for Fears released an album on 25th February 1985 titled \"Songs from the big chair\" and the track Head over Heels, can be found located on the B side track 7, Not to be confused with the Cocteau twins album of course.\n\nElizabeth Fraser of Cocteau Twins (Charcoal) by Inglewood65\n\n“The Cocteau Twins are still the best by far at the 4AD ethereal dreamscape, thanks largely to the extraordinary voice of Liz Fraser. Somehow she's found a voice that falls completely outside 'Rock' or 'Pop'.” Simon Reynolds, New Statesman, 1987.\n\nIn 1983, the band participated in 4AD's \"This Mortal Coil\" project, which spawned a cover version of Tim Buckley's \"Song to the Siren\" performed by Guthrie and Fraser. Despite appearing under the This Mortal Coil name, the cover has subsequently become one of the best-known Cocteau Twins tracks: in 2012, Dawn French selected \"Song to the Siren\" on Desert Island Discs as, in her own words, \"The song that made me fall in love again\" During the TMC sessions, Guthrie and Fraser became acquainted with another project contributor, multi-instrumentalist Simon Raymonde (formerly a member of \"Drowning Craze\", who joined Cocteau Twins later that year.\n\nSimon Reynolds\n\nSimon Raymonde\n\nWith Raymonde, the band released a series of critically acclaimed albums and EPs that explored their new style. These included \"The Spangle Maker\" 1984, Treasure 1984, Aikea-Guinea (1985), Tiny Dynamite and Echoes in a Shallow Bay (1985) and \"Love's Easy Tears (1986). Raymonde, Raymonde, who was called in to work on the second album by This Mortal Coil, did not participate in the recording of the fourth Cocteau Twins LP, Victorialand (1986), a predominantly acoustic record which featured only Guthrie and Fraser. Raymonde returned to the group for \"The Moon and the Melodies (1986), a collaboration with ambient composer Harold Budd, which was not released under the Cocteau Twins name.\n\nCocteau Twins - Crushed, Lonely Is an Eyesore is a compilation of music by artists on the 4AD label released in June 1987. Crushed can be found at track 6 of the 9 track album. Engineered by John Fryer and produced by Ivo Watts-Russel who is the joint founder of 4AD, and was recorded at Blackwig Studios in London.\n\nThe video for \"Crushed,\" though visually quite interpretive of the music in some ways, suffered from unstable 8-millimeter footage and the occasional problem with synchronization (at one point the viewer is hearing Liz sing one thing while her mouth is moving to something else entirely). But it nevertheless comes close to capturing the visual aspect of the music. The colors are bright and vibrant, and appear to move in and out of the shadows, along with the band members. We even catch a glimpse of Simon playing piano at one point, as well. The video ends with the camera panning to Liz, who bursts into laughter.\n\nLonely is an Eyesore compilation album.\n\nIn 1985, 4AD signed an agreement with Relativity Records for distribution of Cocteau Twins releases in the U.S. and other territories. To commemorate the event, the compilation \"The Pink Opaque\" 1985, was released as a way of introducing the new, broader audience to the band's back catalogue.\n\nWhile remaining a 4AD band internationally, Cocteau Twins finally signed a major label contract with Capitol Records in 1988 for distribution in the U.S. and released their fifth LP \"Blue Bell Knoll\" in October of that year.\n\nThe albums that the band have released over the years,\n\nGarlands - 1982\n\nHead Over Heels - 1983\n\nTreasure - 1984\n\nVictorialand - 1986\n\nThe Moon and the Melodies - 1986\n\nBlue Bell Knoll - 1988\n\nHeaven or Las Vegas - 1990\n\nFour Calendar Cafe - 1993\n\nMilk & Kisses - 1996\n\nCocteau Twins, Fluffy Tufts, from the Album Victorialand released in 1986.\n\nThe former members of Cocteau Twins have remained active musically in the years since the band's demise. In addition to forming Bella Union, Guthrie and Raymonde have produced releases from new bands signed to that label.\n\nGRANGEMOUTH, SCOTLAND - NOVEMBER 1: BP's Huge oil refinery complex continues it's 24 hour production of petroleum and gas, November 1, 2004 at Grangemouth in central Scotland.\n\nPop was always Fraser's escape. Back in Grangemouth, a \"horrendous\" petrochemical town in Stirlingshire, she had seemed destined to follow her mother into the local rag trade until she realised that having \"boxing gloves for hands\" meant she could barely operate the machines. She would go dancing at a local club, the Nash, which is where she met Guthrie: he spotted the 17-year-old Fraser on the dancefloor one night in 1980 and asked her to join the band he'd started with his friend Will Heggie. By saying yes, Fraser acquired a soulmate and an enabler. \"I looked up to him. I could never have done it without him.\" The distinctive sound they developed \"flowed from the chemistry between us\", particularly once Raymonde, a Londoner, replaced Heggie.\n\nCocteau Twins - Pearly Dewdrops' Drops (Official Video) The fourth single / EP, released in 1984.\n\nFraser never realized at the beginning that the sound she and the other band members were generating would be musically acclaimed, She never considered the music experimental or even original at the time, She felt the band was getting away with it somehow, Bands in the 80's could normally do what they wanted and still have a career, It felt like it was feted.\" But, she says, \"It couldn't be sustained.\"\n\nCocteau Twins Reflext Magazine September 1988\n\nShe and Guthrie were lovers for 13 years, during which time the difficulties any relationship faces were compounded by being in a band together. \"We were so close, but certain responsibilities were too much for us,\" Fraser says. The birth of their daughter Lucy-Belle in 1989 \"didn't impact as positively\" as she'd hoped.\n\nFraser was becoming increasingly unhappy in the band and she felt he and her were outgrowing each other, She resented what people wanted her to do all the time and began to break free. Guthrie also had an alcohol and drugs dependency problem which he freely admitted to after the band had split up. She feels her own unhappiness was not being noticed by the other members and felt isolated.\n\nFraser endured a nervous breakdown and underwent a course of psychotherapy. Today, she remains irked by the suggestion Guthrie made after completing rehab, that he'd needed the drugs to make the music.\n\nBut Fraser doesn't truly believe what Guthrie said was true she believes he never believed in that at the beginning. She say's On drugs I just shut down. I just thought they'd get fed up with it, and get into something … healthy.\" She allows herself a chuckle. \"But it never worked out.\" Fraser was extremely upset after staying on with the band for an additional two years due to over contracted issues, and I wasn't strong enough to stop it\". The resulting tensions, she says, caused the greatest lasting damage. \"Periodically, my mind is blown,\" she says, \"and I'm swamped in feelings I can't deny.\"\n\nFraser subsequently had an intense relationship with Jeff Buckley after becoming infatuated with each others voices.Buckley born November 17 1966 was an American singer, songwriter and guitarist. Again, emotion and creativity produces music, A sublime duet they recorded called All Flowers in Time Bend Towards the Sun was produced.Buckley died in 1997, by which time they had lost touch – Fraser had grown frustrated with his constant touring, a reaction that weighs heavily on her. \"I just wish I'd been more of a friend,\" she says, softly. \"His career was everything to him, and I wish I had been more understanding – happy with a different kind of relationship. I missed out on something there, and it was my fault.\"\n\nJeff Buckley\n\nCocteau Twins-Blue Bell Knoll\n\nBuckley sadly had drowned while swimming in the Wolf river in Memphis. Fraser was recording \"Teardrop\" with \"Massive Attack\" at the time she received the news. Eventually just before the Cockteau twins split Fraser met Damon Reece who is an English drummer born on 16th February 1967. He has been a member of \"Spiritualized, Echo and the Bunnymen and Lupine Howl. He grew up in Croydon but moved to Liverpool when he was 18 years old where he played in various local bands. He has also worked with Goldfrapp, and Massive Attack.\n\nA remembrance sign near the location Buckley drowned. Wolf River Memphis.\n\nWhen Reece and Fraser moved to Bristol, Drake-Brockman helped fix up the house, and taught Lily (Frasers daughter) to swim. Reece is still in shock after the accident that killed his friend. \"He wore a tweed jacket and rode a 1938 machine,\" he says. \"He was going to be the old man on the motorcycle when he was 80.\" Fraser admits another reason for her demise from public life was her having a second child.\n\nAfter the birth of Lucy-Belle, she'd kept on working, but she made sure she was able to watch her second child grow up. \"I was so angry with myself,\" she sighs. \"I realized what I'd missed out on. But that's me, angry, angry!\"\n\nCocteau Twins - The Thinner the Air\n\nphoto by Fid , the last ever made. At Sulby, Isle of Man last Sunday.

James Ralph \"Jake\" Drake-Brockman (18 November 1955 – 1 September 2009)\n\nJames Ralph \"Jake\" Drake-Brockman (18 November 1955 – 1 September 2009) was a Bristol based English musician and sound recordist, Drake-Brockman was known to fans as \"the fifth Bunnyman\", as he had been associated with the Liverpool group \"Echo and the Bunnymen\" since the 1980s and became a full-time member, as keyboardist, in 1989, using the professional name Jake Brockman. Sadly Brockman died on the Isle of Man on 1st September 2009 while visiting the island for the Manx Grand Prix when the BSA motorcycle he was riding was in collision with a converted ambulance. The inquest into his death was opened and adjourned on 10 September; the full inquest has been delayed until police enquiries into the accident are completed. In a sad coincidence, he is the second member of Echo and the Bunnymen to die as a result of a motorcycle accident (the band's original live drummer, Pete de Freitas had died under similar circumstances 20 years prior.\n\nIn November 2009 \"The Cockteau Twins\" singer Elizabeth Fraser released her first solo single \"Moses\" as a tribute to Drake-Brockman, who had been a close friend.\n\nHowever, the scars of the past are healing. Despite the burdens she carries she is happy, and now her closeness to Reece has produced her first new music for more than a decade. The couple have even made \"what might become an album\", music that – untypically – she says she is very proud of. But she insists that – just like the duet with Buckley – the music isn't finished, and isn't ready for public consumption. \"I'm very perfectionist,\" she explains. \"I'm getting stronger as a person, but sometimes I just need to\" – she's laughing now – \"get over myself!\"\n\nReece understands the process required that will help put her back as a singer as an ongoing process.\n\nDamon Reece recording drums in Massive Attacks studio\n\nFraser sees making music as inseparable from her emotions. She has always struggled to write lyrics, she says, but suddenly something will click and she \"goes with the sound and the joy\"\n\nShe sings sounds and words that have no meaning, of which she can only make sense later. As she puts it, \"I can't act. I can't lie.\" She has been labelled as \"The voice from another world\" The Voice of God\"\n\nCocteau Twins- Love's Easy Tears Restored\n\nMylène Jeanne Gautier was born on the 12th September 1961, she is known professionally as Mylene Farmer and is of Canadian descent but is French born.\n\nMylene specializes in singing, songwriting, writing, she is also an occasional actress which shows in her sometimes very dynamic and large scaled music videos (Almost like a play turned film script). She was born in Pierrefonds, Quebec to a French family but was brought up in France (Hence her fluent french speaking attributes). Mylene has been very successful in her career and has sold more than 30 million records in France alone. She is considered one of the most successful French recording artists of all time.\n\nI find it slightly unusual that I like Mylene Farmers music considering I don't speak or understand French very well. I just feel her melodies and her dramatic video scores are truly outstanding and really blend with her dynamic but also incredibly subtle sound. MTV endorsed Farmers music and played it occasionally in the late 80's, This was the first time I heard Mylene farmer's (Mylène Farmer - Sans logique) and had already made up my mind that I liked her music.\n\nMylene also holds a record for the most consistent number one hits in the French charts, not surprising really as the French adore Mylene, She has achieved 18 to date and amazingly 8 tracks were consecutive, Twelve of her albums have also reached number one in France.\n\nA poster promoting Mylene Farmer. Her staged productions, both on clip and in concert, Mylène Farmer is accustomed to spectacular concerts with a very studied choreography.\n\nHer father is called (Max Gutier) who is originally from Marseille, Mylene's mother was born in (Lennon) which is in Brittany called Marguerite. In the late 1950's the family decided to move away from France as her father was offered an engineering contract on a dam which was too good to turn down. When Mylene had reached the age of Eight the family moved back to France settling in the Parisan suburb of Ville-d'Avray. Mylene was interested in singing from a young age and when she first arrived in France in 1969 she took speech classes after her school declared her Québécois accent to be \"improper\", This explains why she now speaks with the accent of metropolitan France. As Mylene grew into her teenage adolescence she became passionate about horse riding, She qualified as a riding instructor at the equestrian centre in Saumar. At the age of 17 Mylene discovered acting and she left the stables to undertake a three year course at the Cours Florent, a drama school in Paris.\n\nEcuyers rehearsing for an equestrian event, Pays de la Loire - Black Frame of Saumur\n\nMylène Farmer Maman a tort (C'est assez chaud ) 10 octobre 1984\n\nMaman a tort (C'est assez chaud )\n\nOne, mom is wrong\n\nTwo, it's beautiful love\n\nThree, the nurse cries\n\nFour, I love him\n\nFive, it's my right\n\nSix, to touch everything\n\nSeven, I do not stop there\n\nEight, I'm having fun\n\nOne, whatever mom says\n\nTwo, she will forget me\n\nThree, wet eyes\n\nFour, I'm in pain\n\nFive, I say what I want\n\nSix, I'm unhappy\n\nSeven, I do not think often\n\nEight, what about you?\n\nI like what I'm banned\n\nRude pleasures\n\nI like when she smiles at me\n\nI like the nurse mom\n\nOne, I'm very serene\n\nTwo, and I did well\n\nThree, to tell you about it\n\nFour, I'm having fun\n\nFive, whatever mom says\n\nSix, she was beautiful\n\nSeven, this nurse\n\nEight, I love him\n\nOne, the nurse sings\n\nTwo, it makes me things\n\nThree, like the lark\n\nFour, I'm scared\n\nFive, it's hard life\n\nSix, for a smile\n\nSeven, I cry at night\n\nEight, what about you?\n\nI like what I'm banned\n\nRude pleasures\n\nI like when she smiles at me\n\nI like the nurse mom\n\nOne, mom is wrong\n\nTwo, it's beautiful love\n\nThree, the nurse cries\n\nFour, I love him\n\nFive, mom is wrong\n\nSix, it's beautiful love\n\nSeven in the hospital\n\nEight, I hurt\n\nShe then changed her name to Mylene Farmer as a tribute to her idol, 1930's Hollywood actress Frances Farmer. She began to earn a living as a model acting in several TV adverts such as Fiskars, Caisse d'Epargne.\n\nIn 1994 Mylene met Laurant Boutonnat, a young film student after answering a newspaper advert for an actress for a small film he was working on. This lead to Mylene and Laurent becoming firm friends and forged a creative partnership, writing and producing the music for the short films score. This lead to Boutonnat, whose ambition was to become a film director, became the creative force behind Farmer's videos.\n\nFrancis Farmer, Frances Elena Farmer (September 19, 1913 – August 1, 1970) was an American actress and television host. She is perhaps better known for sensationalized accounts of her life, especially her involuntary commitment to mental hospital.\n\nMylene gained fame with songs featuring controversial yet poetic, lyrics and explicit videos. \"Maman a tort\" was about a young girl's love for her female nurse. \"Pourvu qu'elies soient douces\" contains hints of sodomy, and caning having the set produced to an 18th century setting. \"Libertine is another explicit video which shows naked female bodies and also depicts violent and bloody scenes of lust and jealousy. This track proved to be the first song to feature such images by a singer on a major music video. \"Que mon coeur lache\" was about love in the AIDS era quite controversial for the time, the video features a scene in which God tells Jesus he will not be sent to Earth again because the last time \"was a disaster\". This might cause offence with deeply religious Christians Catholic and other flavours of religion.\n\nThese artistic creations continued but did start to make a dent on the theme and topic, The videos for \"Beyond my Control\" and \"Je te rends ton amour\" were banned because of their sexual and violent content. Later on however \"Je te rends ton amour\" was released as a video single and became the biggest selling video single in France.\n\nJe te rends ton amour... by SandraVogel ...\n\nIn spite of her drama courses, Farmer found it difficult to overcome shyness when facing an audience. She hesitantly agreed to tour in 1989. After test-singing in a small venue in Saint-Etienne, the singer went to Paris to perform at the Palais des Sports for a week in May. Following the positive response of the audience, she agreed to a full-scale 52-date tour throughout francophone Europe. A live album documenting the tour was released at the end of that year, titled En Concert, It featured a new song, \"A quoi je sers\" (What Am I Good For) in which she questioned the future of her career. The tour costumes were created by the famous French designer Thierry Mugler.It was also during this period that it was noticed that Farmer rarely gave interviews or appeared in public, though she is now even less inclined to public exposure than at the time.\n\nMylène Farmer - We'Ll Never Die (Techno Remix)\n\nAt the age of 20, Thierry Mugler left his hometown of Strasbourg. His destination: Paris. There, his allure and style were on display for all to see. Mugler would often wear his own creations and a freelance career as a designer soon opened up to him. He began by working with major fashion houses, then created his first collection in 1973 called «Café de Paris». Going against folkloric, unstructured fashion, the collection had an urban, sexy, flirty vibe, confident in itself. It exuded avant-garde ultra-femininity, a dramatization of the everyday unveiling of a woman. It was the same Thierry Mugler style that debuted with the creation of his house in 1974. Four years later, he was named «Designer of the Year» by both the press and the public. His success story had begun. Throughout the 1980s, the Thierry Mugler brand shone brightly with acclaimed collections, ingenious fashion shows that he conceived and directed, painting-like photos that he created himself, short films, video clips and films.\n\nMylène Farmer - Greta -\n\nGreta\n\nDivine\n\nDelightful and woeful\n\nOf life, she's orphan\n\nChildlike\n\nQueen and ruin\n\nCursed be those who took you\n\nGreta smiles, and I blush\n\nGreta shivers, death looks like her\n\nGreta dies, I can hear God crying\n\nGreta loves, divine unfaithful\n\nKisses cold like her\n\nI love her\n\nDivine\n\nTo run away is not easy\n\nWhen night has won over you\n\nEverything is empty\n\nYou are not anymore\n\nIt's my life, you lost it\n\nGreta smiles, and I blush\n\nGreta shivers, death looks like her\n\nGreta dies, I can hear God crying\n\nGreta loves, divine unfaithful\n\nKisses cold like her\n\nI love her...\n\nGreta Garbo\n\nThis song is a tribute to Greta Garbo, called \"Divine\" in the lyrics. Several allusions to the actress' life - the death of her parents, her distance from her fans - are mentioned in the couplets and slogans accompanying the release of some of her films are used in the refrain. Original statements by Garbo from several films are sampled at the beginning, in the middle and at the end of the song. The song is the B-side of the vinyl for \"Libertine\".\n\nIt has never been performed on tour, but one time on television: C'est encore mieux l'après-midi (22 January 1987, Antenne 2)\n\nGreta Garbo born Greta Lovisa Gustafsson on 18th September 1905 until 15th April 1990 was a Swedish film actress during the 1920's and 1930's.

She directed her friends in make believe games and performances and dreamed of becoming an actress. Later, she would participate in amateur theatre with her friends and frequent the Mosebacke Theatre. At the age of 13 Garbo graduated from school and typical of a Swedish working class girl at that time she did not continue her schooling at high school, She later acknowledged a resulting inferiority complex.\n\nKarl Alfred was the second of seven children and the eldest son of Johan Agathon Gustafsson and Lovisa Andersdotter.

Three younger brothers and a sister died before they turned five, two within a day of each other.\n\nIn the winter of 1919, the Spanish flu spread throughout Stockholm, and Garbo's father, to whom she was very close, became ill. He began missing work and eventually lost his job. Garbo stayed at home looking after him and taking him to the hospital for weekly treatments. He died in 1920 when she was 14 years old.\n\nGarbo first worked as a soap-lather girl in a barber's shop but eventually, on the advice of her friends, applied for, and accepted, a position in the PUB department store, Pub was a major department store in Stockholm Sweden.
