        "text": "Whereas a new decade has just dawned in the here and now with the move into 2020, in TOTP land we are still only approaching the end of a decade with the BBC4 repeat schedule having moved into 1989. What were you doing back then? Me, I was in my third and final year of being a student at Sunderland Polytechnic and living in a house with three other males with all the associated lads antics you would have expected. Stupid house rules? Check! Silly house nicknames? Check! General house scuzziness and a discernible lack of cleanliness? Big check!\n\nAs if by some sort of astral karma, 1989 started with the house getting burgled. Poor Dave who had the ground floor front room was unfortunate enough to enter the house whilst the burglars were still in there – he was studying biology and had come back early to look after an experiment he had set going before the Xmas break. His timely intervention scared the burglars off and meant that very little was stolen. For a while Dave was hero of the house until we all resorted to our pre-burglary behaviour of taking the piss out of each other constantly. We were an odd mix – Ian was on my course and very high profile but his music taste was very mainstream as I recall. Dave was quite into his soft rock and Gouch was a bit of a mystery floating in and out of the house. The only music I ever heard coming out of his room was “Dream To Sleep” by H2O which was very unexpected but welcomed as I really liked that song and hadn’t heard it in ages – there was no play on demand streaming services in those days of course. I wonder if any of the songs on the first TOTP of the new year would have been well received in the house…\n\nTOTP was undergoing some changes around this time – the usual suspects on the presenting rota were being weeded out and replaced by hip new BBC presenters. The likes of Radio 1 old timers Mike Read, Peter Powell and Simon Bates were gone and in their place were people like Andy Crane who were what passed for ‘hip’ back then! Crane is joined tonight by Mark Goodier representing the younger end of the Radio 1 spectrum and in the space of the show’s first minute he’s already given us a ‘My Goodness’and a ridiculously over the top ‘ooh’ as first act Erasure are introduced. Also, he was always over dressed in a stuffy suit and tie combo which never looked right for presenting TOTP to me.\n\nAnyway, back to Vince and Andy and they are up to No 2 after some very solid Xmas sales but they were unfortunate to be up against a hugely successful Xmas song in Cliff’s “Mistletoe And Wine” and the Neighbours phenomenon in the shape of Kylie and Jason and as such would never quite get the “Crackers International EP” to No 1. In spite of this, the lead track from the EP “Stop” remains one of their most memorable and played tracks. This particular performance is pretty standard Erasure fare with minimal movement from Vince and some routine gyrating from Andy. However there is nothing standard about the latter’s choice of waistcoat.\n\nAs we are in the post rush lull, there’s not a lot of movement in the charts so there’s a fair few songs we’ve seen before on the show just repeated beginning with “Four Letter Word” by Kim Wilde. Unless I’m very much mistaken, this is literally just a re-showing of a previous studio performance – you can tell as Kim has the same posh frock on. Unless of course she was (gasp!) wearing the same outfit twice! I think Kim would have shown a bit more respect to TOTP than that – in a Smash Hits interview she was asked to name her ten favourite four letter words (see what they did there?) and one of the was TOTP. Technically not a word of course but acronyms were allowed apparently. Why TOTP? Because Kim liked being on the show of course! She also revealed in the same interview that she was named Kim after the actress Kim Novak but was very nearly Doris after Doris Day. Hmm…Doris Wilde…not sure that would have worked quite as well.\n\n“Four Letter Word’ would peak at No 6.\n\nAnd another song we’ve seen before – this time “You Are The One” by A-ha. This would be the last we would see of the trio in ’89 and indeed the rest of the decade before they returned in 1990 with the “East of the Sun, West of the Moon” album. Three years on from their first hit “Take On Me” and yes I still wanted Morten’s hair. Incidentally, I checked out his band mate Mags’ Xmas album “Xmas White Lies” as part of my festive listening and it was pretty good if you like your Xmas tunes a bit darker than the usual likes of Slade, Wizzard and the rest.\n\n“You Are The One” peaked at No 13.\n\nDespite the stagnant charts, there are still some Breakers and indeed they seem to be preying on Andy Crane’s mind as he cocks up the segue from A-ha into them by announcing “A-ha at No 15 with All She Wants Is” which is of course the title of the first Breaker by Duran Duran. If I’ve said it once in this blog etc….you had one job Crane!\n\nOK so onto Duran Duran who are benefiting from that post Xmas lull where it takes less sales to get a hit by releasing “All She Wants Is” which will end up making No 9 albeit also becoming the band’s last Top 10 entry of the decade. Still trying to remain relevant in a fast changing pop landscape at this point, you could argue that this was a cynically timed release to do just that. However, for a Duran Duran release , I always thought it was pretty out there. I always found it a bit too experimental sounding for my tastes and wasn’t a fan but I’ve mellowed to it over time.\n\nApparently the video won an MTV award for innovation and to be fair, the flitting lighting effects and the a spooky band member mannequins do make for an unsettling watch. They took the concept even further with the video for 90s single “Electric Barbarella” which features a robot sex doll and is a decidedly uncomfortable watch. At the time of “All She Wants Is” though , all I could see was the length of Simon Le Bon’s hair. What was he doing? Having wanted my own hair to look just like his back in ’83, this was surely a look that nobody wanted to recreate. Compared to the aforementioned and immaculate Morten Harket barnet, Le Bon was seemingly intent on resembling Worzel Gummidge. I was clearly still very affected by male pop stars’ hairstyles at this point in my life.\n\nNext a song that despite being a sizeable but not mega hit (No 9), still receives extensive airplay to this day. Boy Meets Girl were songwriting and real life married couple George Merrill and Shannon Rubicam who had already tasted success though not as performers themselves as they had written the No 1 songs “How Will I Know” and “I Wanna Dance with Somebody (Who Loves Me)” for Whitney Houston. However, when “Waiting For A Star To Fall” was rejected by Houston’s label they decided to put it out themselves and scored themselves a hit both sides of the Atlantic.\n\nI always found it far too mawkish and cloying with its relentlessly upbeat feel and chorus that almost springs forward right out of the radio before suffocating you in its saccharine grip. And just look at them in the video in all their lovey dovey smugness. Two things of note though. Firstly, they seem to have invented selfies with the scene on the bed when they photo themselves using a…is that a polaroid instamatic? Secondly, is he, in fact, actually Michael Bolton?\n\nThe final Breaker is Gloria Estefan and the Miami Sound Machine with “Rhythm Is Gonna Get You”. Gloria’s release timeline starts to get a bit confusing at this point. This particular track was originally released back in ’87 as the lead single from the album “Let Loose” but failed to chart in the UK. It was re-released in early ’88 on the back of it being used in the film Stakeout but still didn’t chart. However, following the success of the “Anything For You” and “1-2-3” singles, it was shoved out for a third time when it was finally a hit peaking at No 16. Just to add to the confusion, the parent album was re-titled “Anything For You” for the European market. Still following? Look, I’m not sure I knew any of this back in the day. All I knew was that it was a fast one in a Latin style as opposed to a big, plush, overblown ballad which it seems to me are the only types of songs that Gloria does. Did I like it? Not really. Her next single would be “Don’t Wanna Lose You” which was a big, plush overblown ballad. Of course it was.\n\nNext a fine example of flogging a dead horse. Just a short eight months on from riding high in the charts with their No 2 hit “Love Changes Everything”, it was all starting to look decidedly iffy for Climie Fisher. Subsequent singles had failed to match that chart achievement of what was clearly their best song and yet they were still desperately trying to recapture those heady days. As far as I can tell, “Love Like A River” was a stand alone single (although it was included as an extra track on a 2009 re-release of their first album) so presumably was a marketing ploy by their label to maintain the band’s flagging profile in between albums.\n\nYou can imagine the conversation…\n\nLabel: We need something to release so that the public don’t forget about you. Got anything we could use?\n\nClimie (or possibly Fisher): Well, we’ve got this song “Love Like A River” but really it’s just a filler track. B-side at best.\n\nLabel: That’ll do\n\nHarsh? Maybe but you could imagine it featuring in a straight to TV movie over the end credits when the guy finally gets the girl. It’s that lightweight. Fair play to them though as they do their best to sell this lame donkey of a song with leather jackets, hand claps and fist clenches a plenty. It clearly worked on Mark Goodier who declares at the song’s end “Climie Fisher – just a brilliant band”. A comment that hasn’t aged well and I say that as someone who bought “Love Changes Everything”.\n\nEver wondered what happened to Climie Fisher? Here’s Half Man Half Biscuit with the answer (probably)…\n\nAnother song that’s been on at least twice before next. I’ve very little left to say about “Good Life” by Inner City so I’m resorting to a Smash Hits interview in which the duo of Paris Grey and Kevin Saunderson state that for the record they are not purveyors of house music but are in fact the world’s first techno pop group. And there was me thinking that was 2 Unlimited!\n\nHere’s fast rising star Neneh Cherry with her debut hit “Buffalo Stance”.\n\nNow I had no idea at the time but Neneh had actually been knocking around in the pop game for quite some time before this so wasn’t the newbie that I thought she was. No, she’d been in post punk band Rip Rig & Panic who had released three albums and six singles between 1980 and 1983. They had also of course been one of the musical artists on the first series of The Young Ones and this was the song they played…\n\nI couldn’t remember them from the original broadcast (the actual clip seems to be blocked on YouTube by the BBC) but playing it back it sounds kind of interesting. Fast forward seven or so years and Neneh is on the brink of solo superstardom. How did that happen? It’s an interesting story involving the likes of Ari Up, Poly Styrene and Massive Attack but I haven’t go the time to go into all that now. I’m sure Neneh will be on many of these 1989 TOTP repeats so plenty of time for looking into her back story.\n\nRight then, Top 10 time…\n\n10. Bros – “Cat Among The Pigeons / Silent Night”\n\n9. Kim Wilde – “Four Letter Word”\n\n8. Status Quo – “Burning Bridges (On & Off & On Again)”\n\n7. The Four Tops – “Loco In Acapulco”\n\n6. Neneh Cherry – “Buffalo Stance”\n\n5. Cliff Richard – “Mistletoe And Wine”\n\n4. Inner City – “Good Life”\n\n3. Angry Anderson – “Suddenly”\n\n2. Erasure – “Crackers International EP”\n\n1. Kylie Minogue and Jason Donovan – “Especially For You”: Xmas has been and gone and so thank fuck has Cliff as “Mistletoe And Wine” is finally dethroned by the nation’s favourite Aussie sweethearts Kylie and Jason. This is just a repeat of the duo’s pre Xmas studio performance. The ‘are they aren’t they’ saga was in full flow at this point but Jason would eventually be replaced in Kylie’s affections by wild man of rock Michael Hutchence. Her relationship with the INXS front man is covered in the documentary Mystify: Michael Hutchence which is a very worthwhile watch if you can catch it on iPlayer. From this point on, 1989 would pretty much belong to Kylie and Jason with the former scoring a further No 1 solo single and album with her sophomore release “Enjoy Yourself” whilst the latter would go even better with two No 1 solo singles and the biggest selling album of the year in”Ten Good Reasons”. So that’s something to look forward to then…ahem.\n\nThe play out video is “Loco In Acapulco” by The Four Tops which seems to have been in the charts for ages now. Consequently I’ve got nothing else to say about this one so I’m going to use it as an excuse to post this great tune named after The Four Tops lead singer..\n\nSorted.\n\nOrder of appearance Artist Song Did I Buy it?\n\n1\n\nErasure Crackers International EP Not the EP but “Stop” is on their first Greatest Hits collection CD which I have\n\n2\n\nKim Wilde Four Letter Word Nope\n\n3\n\nA-ha You Are The One No but it’s on their Greatest Hits CD which I have\n\n4\n\nDuran Duran All She Wants Is No but it was on their Decade compilation album which I had\n\n5\n\nBoy Meets Girl Waiting For A Star To Fall And no\n\n6\n\nGloria Estefan and Miami Sound Machine Rhythm Is Gonna Get You Not a chance\n\n7\n\nClimie Fisher Love Like A River A big fat no\n\n8\n\nInner City Good Life Not my thing at all\n\n9\n\nNeneh Cherry Buffalo Stance No but my wife had the album\n\n10\n\nKylie Minogue & Jason Donovan Especially For You Of course not\n\n11\n\nThe Four Tops Loco in Acapulco Nah\n\nDisclaimer\n\nOK – here’s the thing – the TOTP episodes are only available on iPlayer for a limited amount of time so the link to the programme below only works for about another month so you’ll have to work fast if you want to catch the whole show.\n\nhttps://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/m000d26k/top-of-the-pops-05011989\n\nI make no claim to the rights of this show and all ownership and contents including logos and graphics belongs totally to the BBC or copyright holder(s).\n\nAll opinions on the music and artists featured are my own. Sorry if you don’t agree.\n\nSome bed time reading?\n\nhttp://likepunkneverhappened.blogspot.com/2018/12/december-28-1988-january-10-1989.html\n\nSo after closer inspection, was 1988 the seismic year in pop music that I remembered? Well, yes and no probably. Yes, we saw the emergence of the acid house dance craze and the domination of the charts by all things with enough bpm to qualify them as a dance tune. It was the beginning of chart acts that included the word ‘featuring’ in their name – something that applies to nearly every single chart hit today it seems to this admittedly middle aged and curmudgeonly blogger. We also saw the demonisation of that movement by the tabloid press as a drug fuelled cult, encouraging the nation’s youngsters to get off their faces at illegal warehouse raves whilst wearing a smiley face T-shirt. It wasn’t just music that had changed irreversibly but the whole of youth culture we were led to believe. It was punk all over again ’88 style we were told by frantic preservers of the country’s moral well being (well, probably Mary Whitehouse at least).\n\nAnd yet it many ways it was just more of the same. There were plenty of some of the purest (and most sickly) pop acts that the decade had ever witnessed. I mean, Glenn Medeiros…really?! It was hardly threatening was it or though it could be argued he was the stuff of nightmares I guess. The Stock, Aitken and Waterman bandwagon rolled on at a pace with new acts Kylie Minogue and Jason Donovan capitalising on the emergence of Neighbours as the country’s favourite TV programme. And there were some very big hits for some very familiar faces. Check out the list of No 1 singles below. Phil Collins, U2, Whitney Houston and even Cliff Richard all topped the charts in ’88. Yes, there were some new names like Fairground Attraction, Yazz, S’Express and… err…Robin Beck but none of them really sustained.\n\nWe did see some even greater success for fairly new acts consolidating their positions at the top table of pop like Wet Wet Wet and Pet Shop Boys plus a revelation of female solo artists all making claims for a reserved seat at that same table. Belinda Carlisle, Tiffany, Debbie Gibson, Kylie and Yazz were all breakthrough artists in this year but of those I would suggest only Belinda and Ms Minogue forged lasting careers.\n\nOf the list of No 1s, that leaves a novelty record (The Timelords), a new boy band sensation (Bros) and err…. almost inexplicably Aswad. I bought precisely none of them and liked a handful. Not exactly a vintage year for No 1s for me (yet again) then.\n\nChart date\n\n(week ending) Song Artist(s) Weeks 2 January “Always on My Mind“ Pet Shop Boys 2 9 January 16 January “Heaven Is a Place on Earth“ Belinda Carlisle 2 23 January 30 January “I Think We’re Alone Now“ Tiffany 3 6 February 13 February 20 February “I Should Be So Lucky“ Kylie Minogue 5 27 February 5 March 12 March 19 March 26 March “Don’t Turn Around“ Aswad 2 2 April 9 April “Heart“ Pet Shop Boys 3 16 April 23 April 30 April “Theme from S-Express“ S’Express 2 7 May 14 May “Perfect“ Fairground Attraction 1 21 May “With a Little Help from My Friends” /\n\n“She’s Leaving Home“ Wet Wet Wet /\n\nBilly Bragg 4 28 May 4 June 11 June 18 June “Doctorin’ the Tardis“ The Timelords 1 25 June “I Owe You Nothing“ Bros 2 2 July 9 July “Nothing’s Gonna Change My Love For You“ Glenn Medeiros 4 16 July 23 July 30 July 6 August “The Only Way Is Up“ Yazz and the Plastic Population 5 13 August 20 August 27 August 3 September 10 September “A Groovy Kind of Love“ Phil Collins 2 17 September 24 September “He Ain’t Heavy, He’s My Brother“ The Hollies 2 1 October 8 October “Desire“ U2 1 15 October “One Moment in Time“ Whitney Houston 2 22 October 29 October “Orinoco Flow (Sail Away)“ Enya 3 5 November 12 November 19 November “First Time“ Robin Beck 3 26 November 3 December 10 December “Mistletoe and Wine“ Cliff Richard 4 17 December 24 December 31 December\n\nHits We Missed\n\nUnlike with previous years, there weren’t that many shows that were not repeated by BBC4. The now disgraced presenters of yesteryear had all disappeared and the issue over Mike Smith’s not having signed the waiver before his death to allow his TOTP appearances to be re-broadcast didn’t come into play much as his presenting duties were very much curtailed in ’88 by his leaving Radio 1 in this year.\n\nConsequently, there weren’t that many hits that we missed but I’ve dredged up a few…\n\nThe Screaming Blue Messiahs – “I Want To Be A Flintstone”\n\nI saw this lot live once but rather by default. They were the opening act on the bill for the David Bowie gig at Roker Park, Sunderland in 1987 which I went to. I can’t remember much about them but I was blown away by the other support act on the bill that day who were Big Country so I’m guessing that their set was kind of underwhelming in comparison. Now my mate Robin, who said he only attending the Bowie concert to see The Screaming Blue Messiahs, won’t like this but watching this performance back I am put in mind of that dreadful 90s song “Barbie Girl” by Aqua. Why? Well there’s a big bald headed man to the fore just like Aqua. The song name checks a cultural icon in The Flintstones just like Aqua do with Barbie. And…OK – that’s it. Maybe the comparison doesn’t hold up to much scrutiny after all and I infinitely prefer The Screaming Blue Messiahs to Aqua.\n\nPeak UK chart position: No 28\n\nUB40 featuring Chrissie Hynde – “Breakfast In Bed”\n\nWhat to do if your chart fortunes have taken a turn for the worse and you need a reputation restoring big hit? Do what you’ve done before of course! By 1988 it had been nearly two years since UB40’s last visit to the Top 10 so to correct this, they did another duet cover version with Chrissie Hyde as they had done in ’85 when covering “I Got You Babe” which had been a No 1 record for them. Look, nobody needs anything other than the Dusty Springfield version of this song which is absolutely definitive so UB40’s decision to cover it with the same duet partner as before reeked of cynicism. It restored them to the Top 10 though so what do I know?\n\nPeak UK chart position: No 6\n\nJohnny Hates Jazz – “Heart Of Gold”\n\nThe final of four Top 40 hits for this lot. I wonder if they had any inkling at the time that this would be pretty much it for them as contemporary pop stars? “Heart Of Gold” was very much concocted from the same formula as their previous hits in that it was perky, shinily produced pop that was ultimately insubstantial. Or was it? If you take a look at the lyrics, it was clearly a song about a prostitute so maybe there was more gravitas to them than was immediately apparent. See?\n\nFaceless men pay for the pleasure\n\nAnd the nights go on and on\n\nWalking in the street\n\nFor a handful of money\n\nLove don’t come cheap\n\nWith a heart of gold\n\nJohnny Hates Jazz are still a functioning touring band on the retro festival circuit.\n\nPeak UK chart position: No 19\n\nHits That Never Were\n\nSo – “Are You Sure”\n\nI didn’t know much about this lot at the time and I still don’t now but I knew that I liked this single that was a Simple Minds rip off but a good one. I think it got a lot of airplay on my local commercial radio station at the time (North East’s finest Metro Radio) which must have been how I heard of it. Yes it was bombastic and formulaic but the driving drums and simple recurring keyboard riff gave it a great hook I thought and when the female singer’s counterpoint vocals kicked in at the rousing finale I was definitely all in. I was going through a ‘I don’t buy Top 40 hits’ phase at the time so this lowly peaking single allowed me to continue that pattern and I duly purchased the cassette single (or was it a cassingle?).\n\nPeak UK chart position: No 62\n\nBlack – “You’re A Big Girl Now”\n\nA friend once described this next song as A-ha doing Scott Walker and he has a point. Colin Vearncombe (aka Black) was struggling to follow up on the success of “Wonderful Life” but his “Comedy” album included a couple of humdinger singles neither of which received the commercial success they deserved. Lead single “Big One” stalled at No 54 whilst follow up “You’re A Big Girl Now” faired even worse.\n\nIt’s a grandiose song with Vearncombe’s soaring vocals steering it in an almost epic direction. I can only imagine he must have thought what else do I have to do when it failed to chart. I never tire of hearing this song. Those musical dimwits Brother Beyond reviewed it in Smash Hits magazine as ‘unbelievably crap’ and retitled it “I’m A Big Girl’s Blouse’. You know what? I’m glad they hated it as this sort of quality music wasn’t for the likes of them with their cheesy SAW produced pap. Tossers.\n\nPeak UK chart position: No 86\n\nSpandau Ballet – “Raw”\n\nOh dear. How far had the once mighty Spandau Ballet fallen by 1988? I’ll tell you how far. To the depths that a single heralding an album of brand new material wouldn’t even crack the Top 40. That’s how far. “Raw” was the lead single from their “Heart Like A Sky” album and wasn’t a hit which must have been perceived as an unmitigated disaster by the band and their record company. By 1988, the band seemed pretty much an anachronism – a completely displaced dinosaur with no relevant place in the brand new music scene of house and rave culture. The heady days of the all conquering “True” were just five years previous but it felt like fifty.\n\nThe album was recorded under trying circumstances. Internal tensions within the band and the impending focus-shifting The Krays film project keeping the Kemp brothers otherwise engaged meant that Spandau seemed an irrelevance even to the the protagonists themselves. “Raw” wasn’t terrible, it just wasn’t that great. The beefed up, punchier sound was, I think, an attempt to redefine themselves but not enough people were listening. I bought it but only because it was something like 10p from the bargain bins of one of Sunderland’s independent record shops. The end (the first time around anyway) was very nigh.\n\nPeak UK chart position: No 47\n\nJulia Fordham – “The Comfort Of Strangers”\n\nThe first single from her eponymous debut album, this is really quite a strange song in that it really shouldn’t work but it somehow does. For a start there seem to be too many words in the lyrics to scan properly. The song itself seems to make reference to it on more than one occasion. Witness:\n\nIt’s like a snippet of a song that no longer belongs\n\nAnd:\n\nIt’s noisy and disjointed in this tangled mess\n\nThen there’s the way that the song seems to flow with minimal structure (where does the chorus start and end?) but in fact the structure is actually there all along and somehow Julia makes it all hang together. Despite its lowly chart placing, it would get recognition as part of Julia’s gold certified album which is how I knew of it as my wife had it on cassette. I think it was a limited edition version with extra live tracks actually. Ooh get her!\n\nPeak UK chart position: No 89\n\nVoice Of The Beehive – “I Walk The Earth”\n\nFor all that 1988 was a great year of success for Voice Of The Beehive, there was one song in their repertoire that the band just couldn’t get to be a hit and for me it was the best one of the lot. They even tried releasing it twice in that calendar year, once pre-breakthrough and once post Top 40 chart stardom and both attempts fell tantalisingly short.\n\nYes it plagiarises some guitar riffs – I’m pretty sure there are variations of both “You Really Got Me” by The Kinks and The Sex Pistols’ “Pretty Vacant” in there – but the overall effect makes for a pretty darn joyful pop song. Their harmonies in the intro are especially effective. Truly one of the decade’s great lost singles.\n\nPeak UK chart position: No 42 and No 46\n\n‘Til Tuesday – “(Believed You Were) Lucky”\n\nI’m not sure how I got to know of this next track. It certainly didn’t get much airplay in the UK but somehow it resonated with me and stayed with me throughout the years until I was able to revisit it in the digital age via the likes of Spotify and YouTube.\n\n‘Til Tuesday were an American New Wave outfit who were best known for their Top 10 Billboard Hot 100 hit “Voices Carry” from 1985. I didn’t know anything about them at that point and it seems I was (ahem) lucky to have heard “(Believed You Were) Lucky” as it only made No 95 in the US and didn’t register at all in the UK. It’s a pretty cool track though, melodic but with enough of an edge to make it stand out. Not that the band could ever have not stood out due to the astonishing looks of the quite brilliant Aimee Mann. She is mesmerising in this video.\n\nAfter the band split, Mann went solo releasing a number of semi-successful albums and contributing songs to the soundtrack for the film Magnolia including the Grammy nominated “Save Me”. She also wrote one of my favourite Christmas songs ever in “Jacob Marley’s Chain”.\n\nPeak UK chart position: Did not chart\n\nMartin Stephenson and the Daintees – “Wholly Humble Heart”\n\nHow the fuck did this guy not become a massive star?! How did he not even have a Top 40 hit?! Ever?! It just doesn’t compute. I already knew a bit about Martin from early single “Trouble Town” (promoted as just being by The Daintees) plus his “Boat To Bolivia” album. “Wholly Humble Heart” was taken from second album “Gladsome, Humour & Blue” and was an anti-Clause 28 protest song. He was still on the Kitchenware label at this point (as referenced on the intro to this clip) whose offices I visited as part of my research for my third year dissertation. I didn’t see Martin though. I remember a lot of my female friends at Poly having a thing about Martin’s Daintees band mate Anth Dunn – can’t work out which one he is in this performance though.\n\nMartin is still a prolific recording artist and one of the best live performers I’ve ever seen period.\n\nPeak UK chart position: No 81\n\nIt Bites – “Kiss Like Judas”\n\nDismissed as a failed pop/prog rock experiment by some, I always loved It Bites. Their only hit “Calling All The Heroes” was perfect daytime playlist material for Radio 1 and I throughly expected then to become chart stalwarts for the rest of the decade but somehow they forever seemed to just miss the mark.\n\n“Kiss Like Judas” was taken from second album “Once Around the World” and it sounded great to me. Fresh and powerful with a killer chorus, it couldn’t fail could it? Yes, miserably. It stalled outside the Top 40 and follow up single “Midnight” (which I also bought) didn’t chart at all. What was the matter with the record buying public? The screams for the band on this Wogan show appearance seem wildly at odds with their commercial fortunes. Maybe they were members of the band’s fan club shipped in to the studio audience to create a buzz. It didn’t work more’s the pity.\n\nPeak UK chart position: No 76\n\nThe Mighty Lemon Drops – “Inside Out”\n\nHailing from Wolverhampton, these post-punk popsters could have been huge but their West Midlands contemporaries The Wonder Stuff beat them to it. Active from 1985 to 1992, they released a string of singles that failed to crack the Top 40 with one of them (“Out Of Hand”) even having a video produced for it by none other than Derek Jarman. “Inside Out” however was my favourite.\n\nPeak UK chart position: No 74\n\nJoan Jett and the Blackhearts – “I Hate Myself For Loving You”\n\nAlthough basically a rehash of “I Love Rock ‘N’ Roll” put through a 70s glam rock filter, there was something about this piece of dumb ass rock that appealed to me. Maybe it was the cunning juxtaposition of the words ‘hate’ and ‘loving’ in the song title. Apparently the song’s original working title was “I Hate Myself Because I Can’t Get Laid” but in a strange twist of fate, Joan found herself rejecting the advances of a stark bollock naked Steven Tyler when the Aerosmith frontman knocked on her hotel room door while the two were touring together and tried to woo her with the line ‘I Hate Myself For Loving You’. Tyler was rejected in the same way that the song’s original title was binned off. Quite right too. A top 10 hit on the US but it failed to make the Top 40 over here.\n\nPeak UK chart position: No 46\n\n1988 – their year in the sun\n\nAll About Eve:\n\nAlthough they were active as a band for two periods between the years 1984 – 1993 and 1999 – 2004, surely 1988 was their biggest year in terms of commercial success? They racked up four Top 40 singles and a Top 10 album in those 12 months. But the real reason that people will always associate All About Eve with this year? That TOTP appearance of course.\n\nBros:\n\nFame wise, it’s probably not fair or correct to place Bros in this category, not with the after effects of that documentary from 2018. Commercially speaking though, they were never bigger than in ’88. A four times platinum selling album, a No 1 single plus three No 2 singles a No 4 and a sell out tour. And yes, strictly speaking the hits did continue into ’89 and the 90s plus they had that Wembley gig but Brosmania was never as big again as it was in those first 12 months. Maybe Craig ‘Ken’ Logan was more important to the magic formula than we ever realised. Who knows what lies in store for them this second time around….\n\nBomb The Bass:\n\nPioneering the new house craze with some very sample heavy records, Tim Simenon would fall foul of the curse of bad timing when his second album release in 1991 coincided with the Gulf War meaning that radio stations were reluctant to play records by an artist with the word ‘bomb’ in their name. However, it didn’t stop him from having a musical career as a producer of the likes of Depeche Mode and Bjork and doing remixing for such legends as David Bowie for the next 25 years before he fell out of love with music and opened up a meatballs restaurant in Prague. No really.\n\nBrother Beyond:\n\nDespite a couple more hits in the early months of ’89, this lot of chancers who were briefly seen as genuine rivals to Bros were almost completely done by the end of the decade. Their biggest success – the Stock, Aitken and Waterman produced “The Harder I Try” – came in ’88 but thankfully even their cult of fans the Yondies would see through them soon enough. An ill judged and desperate cover version of The Three Degrees “When Will I See You Again” was the final nail in their coffin.\n\nBreathe:\n\nThe unacceptable face of sophisto-pop. This bunch were so bland that they had as much life about them as a CPR training mannequin – breathe indeed. Despite “Hands To Heaven” being a huge smash in the US as well as over here, they were unable to follow it up and after a second album in 1990 sank without trace, they disbanded in 1992\n\nClimie Fisher:\n\nVery much in the same vein as Breathe but with one important difference – they had at least one killer tune in “Love Changes Everything” that for a while gave them the pretence of being an act that would be around for a while. Sadly, none of the rest of their catalogue was anywhere near as good and they split not long after the failure of their second album. Forever immortalised in the Half Man Half Biscuit song “The Ballad Of Climie Fisher”, it somehow seems a little cruel that this would be their legacy.\n\nDebbie Gibson:\n\nThe classic American girl next door scored four hit singles on our charts this year and the fact that she wrote her own material convinced some that she would be around for years to come. True, she did have more success in ’89 but it was mainly in the US whereas in the UK we went much cooler on her very quickly. A brief return to our charts in ’93 with a Grease megamix single (she was playing Sandy in a stage version of the show at the time) was the extent of her UK chart success before she drifted into acting and a Playboy nude feature in 2005.\n\nEighth Wonder:\n\nFinally scored some chart hits in ’88 after literally years of trying. Took a Pet Shop Boys written and produced tune to make the breakthrough but hey – in the cool producers stakes, Chris and Neil were surely a better name to have associated with your band than Stock, Aitken and Waterman who were responsible for Brother Beyond’s big break.\n\nDespite this belated success, the band couldn’t withstand Patsy Kensit’s acting ambitions and spilt soon after.\n\nFairground Attraction:\n\nVery much seen as a breath of fresh air when they burst into the charts with their No 1 single “Perfect”. Despite a twice platinum selling album, the band barely made it into the next decade before splitting. Thankfully it wasn’t the last that we saw of the marvellous Eddi Reader whose solo career includes some brilliant highlights.\n\nJane Wiedlin:\n\nMade one of the most completely joyful pop songs of all time in “Rush Hour” and then promptly disappeared from the world of pop to do some acting until she resurfaced for a number of Go-Gos reunions throughout the 90s. The band finally released some new material in 2001, their first for 17 years. She is now an ordained minister of the Universal Life Church specialising in officiating at weddings as “Reverend Sister Go-Go”.\n\nS’Express:\n\nBringing commercialised acid house to the masses, Mark Moore and his associates were the hottest thing in music at one point with a No 1 hit club anthem and Top 5 follow up single. Two more hits followed in ’89 but by the turn of the decade nobody was interested as we had all moved onto Madchester and baggy.\n\nTanita Tikaram:\n\nThis 18 year old seemed fair set for superstardom in the same way that Tracy Chapman was catapulted to fame in this year, but despite some very tuneful, melodic and unusual songs (“Twist In My Sobriety”), she never quite achieved the same level of success again. Now 50, Tanita is still a recording artist with her last album released in 2016.\n\nThe Adventures:\n\nCriminally underrated band who had been at the pop game since ’84 before they finally had a hit in ’88 with the excellent “Broken Land”. It should have been the springboard to a prolonged period of chart stardom but they never made it back to the Top 40 despite a string of great releases extending into the 90s before splitting.\n\nTiffany:\n\nDebbie Gibson’s nemesis or so the press would have us believe. She racked up three Top 10 hits in the calendar year and was briefly a pop sensation before the world moved on and she was left to scrape a living by acting in such renowned films as Mega Shark Versus Giant Octopus with, get this, Debbie Gibson!\n\nYazz:\n\nUndoubtedly one of the year’s biggest breakout stars, Yasmin Evans scored a huge hit with “The Only Way Is Up” (the second biggest selling single of the year) and followed it up with No 2 hit “Stand Up For Your Love Rights” and double platinum album “Wanted”. It couldn’t and didn’t last though and by the mid 90s she was reduced to recording dodgy cover versions of “Good Thing Going”, “How Long” and “Everybody’s Got to Learn Sometime” the titles of which are a pretty good description of the arc of her pop career.\n\nLast Words\n\nWell, that was the Second Summer of Love. The year when we all went dance crazy (I didn’t) and started taking drugs (again, I didn’t). I still think 1988 stands out as a year of significance within not just the decade but in musical history as a whole but it didn’t feel as seminal as I remembered judging by the content of these TOTP repeats. See you for the final year of the 80s …err..in 2020?\n\nIt’s Thursday night and time for TOTP again then. The presenters on this particular show are Steve Wright (groan) and relative new boy Mark Goodier. Now there’s something odd going on from the very beginning here. Firstly, and this caused quite a reaction on Twitter, why the Hell is Steve Wright wearing marigolds? My favourite Twitter suggestion was from @jamesthedog2001….\n\nHe keeps them on for the entire show as well without referring to them! Dickhead. Secondly, why have they separated him from Goodier in the programme’s beginning. Wright is there (in his rubber gloves) on his own doing his little bit before they cut away to a different camera where Goodier introduces the first act. I can’t recall them doing this before. Maybe @jamesthedog2001’s really was on to something with his reducing infection theory. Of course, neither is strictly on their own as they have the TOTP studio audience gurning behind them and the guy to Wright’s left looks very much like my old mate and Howard Jones fan Rob but it isn’t him. Had to do a double take though.\n\nSo to that first act and it is all American girl next door Debbie Gibson with her latest single “Out Of The Blue”. Given her image, it’s no surprise that in a Smash Hits interview around this time, she declared ‘I love bubblegum music’ and that one of her favourite bands were Wham! In 2005, she took her image in a completely different direction by posing nude for Playboy magazine to help promote the release of her then latest single “Naked”. Blimey!\n\nIn a previous post I wondered who it was that she reminded me of and decided it was Michaela Strachan but on watching this particular performance could it be retired American tennis player Chris Evert? Just me again?\n\nAnother bandwagon jumping dance track next. I can’t say I remember LA Mix‘s “Check This Out” much at all but then it was just a mash up of every single sample and beat that had been flogged to death already by this point so maybe it all just blurred into one a bit. There’s lots of references to ‘jacking the house’ or something and is that Max Bygraves doing the ‘yeaah’ bit. They do show a bit of self knowledge by including a clip of M/A/R/R/S “Pump Up The Volume” (and is that “Beat Dis” by Bomb The Bass as well?) but they discard it immediately with a ‘Oh not again…get off!” line.\n\nThe ‘You know how to whistle’ dialogue is stolen from the Lauren Bacall movie To Have And To Note but LA Mix had already been beaten to it by Nik Kershaw on his track “Bogart” from his ‘Human Racing ” album…\n\n“Check This Out” peaked at No 6 on the UK Top 40.\n\nSo you get a huge international artist over to the UK to appear on your music programme and then intercut her performance with clips of the official promo video. Why would you do that? Ofra Haza‘s performance of “Im Nin’Alu” is perfectly watchable with her exotic Eastern attire and even a sprightly little dance thrown in for good measure so why the need for it to be interrupted by the video? Did the record label spend so much money on it that they insisted it be used? Well, the clips shown include a woman going down a hill on a donkey and a close up of a millipede (?) so I don’t think they were really worth their screen time to be honest. Odd.\n\nI hadn’t realised until I looked it up that Ofra had worked with many other artists including some very unlikely ones like gods of goth The Sisters Of Mercy, synth pop wizard and eccentric Thomas Dolby and err…Paula Abdul.\n\nSadly, Ofra died in 2000 but her legacy lives on with a public park in her home of Tel Aviv named after her.\n\nSome Breakers then starting with Climie Fisher as we witness the moment that their brief chart career began to fall apart almost as soon as it had begun. “This Is Me” was such a weak song to release as a follow up to the great pop tune that was “Love Changes (Everything)”. Bland doesn’t really cover it. Drab? Dreary? Just plain old shit? There really is nothing to the song at all other than the repeated stabs of synth refrain that jars throughout. They were in real Go West B-side territory with this one. The dreadfully laboured lyrics such as ‘I will not compromise, I don’t like living lies, what I say is what I mean’ sound like something I may have written aged 14.\n\nLike Love Changes (Everything)”, “This Is Me” was actually a re-release and somehow scrambled to a No 22 peak but it was the start of an inevitable decline into a trough of diminishing returns for the duo and they would release a series of under-performing singles before splitting in 1989.\n\nSimon Climie would carve out a career in the music industry as both songwriter for the likes of Amy Grant and as a producer mainly for Eric Clapton. Rob Fisher wrote Rick Astley’s early ’90s comeback single “Cry For Help” before sadly dying in surgery for bowel cancer in 1999.\n\nNow then, after selling out completely to finally secure mainstream chart success with “Don’t Turn Around”, Aswad weren’t adverse to repeating the trick for another tilt at the Top 40 when they released the follow up single “Give A Little Love”. This almost identical sounding song was once again from the pens of the prolific songwriters Albert Hammond and Diane Warren and scored the Aswad lads a respectable No 11 hit. I thought it was pretty puny sounding though and thoroughly lame. I mean, there’s very little to it at all. A few ‘whoa -a-whoas’ and a a tiny steel drum sound does not a great record make. Just awful.\n\nA sad moment next as we witness the death rattle of a once vibrant and respected act. In a way, it’s hard to believe that The Style Council were still a going concern in 1988 when the nation had gone house music crazy and the second summer of love was upon us. Even the diehard Paul Weller fans rejected this particular era of the band. “Life At A Top People’s Health Farm” was the lead single from the worst selling album of Weller’s career. “Confessions Of A Pop Group” was a sprawling work clocking in at 57 and a half minutes in length and comprising two completely different sides (or suites) with the first all jazz and classical music stylings while side two was the more usual soul funk work outs Weller had been peddling for a while. It garnered mixed reviews at the time but has since been rather more favourably revisited.\n\nI’m not sure if even my Weller disciple older brother was still on board by this point but the Thatcher bashing “Life At A Top People’s Health Farm” did very little for me musically and bombed out at a very disappointing No 28.\n\nI can’t find the official video shown on TOTP but I did find this bizarre performance from an unknown TV show with one of the oddest intros ever. If you’re going to try and be ‘wacky’ (as he liked to describe himself) Steve Wright, then this is how to do it (note rubber gloves not required).\n\nTwo days after this TOTP aired, my beloved Chelsea FC were relegated to the old second division after losing to Middlesborough in a two -legged play off final which saw the Teesiders promoted to the top flight. Some awful scenes of hooliganism by the home support made a dreadful day even worse. I needed something to cheer my spirits that night and I got it in the form a gig by Hothouse Flowers.\n\nRiding high in the Top 40 with “Don’t Go”, their appearance at Sunderland Polytechnic meant that we were getting to witness some bona fide charts starts for once. I went along with my mate Pete who had the room next to me in my hall of residence the previous year. We managed to get ourselves a spot near to the front of the stage and were in prime position to witness a great gig with the band on fine form.\n\nAt the end of the gig, as we left, we came across the band loading up their gear onto their van. Pete, being from Belfast, couldn’t resist going over and shaking their hands and saying how great it was to see a bunch of Irish blokes doing well. As co-editor of the music section of the Poly newspaper, I should have had the wherewithal to try and conduct an impromptu on the spot interview with them but I just stood back in the shadows and let my gregarious Irish mate do all the talking. I had taken along my camera and got a few snaps of the band in action for a review which my other mate Robin said he would write. Fast forward to 2019 and I am writing this blog. Unbelievably, my mate Robin (who I am still in touch with), texted me over a photo of his review which he had kept all these years!\n\nHang on though, the date of that review says 6th November 1987, a good six months before I reckoned I had seen them. What gives? Did they play Sunderland Poly twice? Unlikely. A quick internet search revealed that they had been on tour in May 1988 and although not listing the Sunderland gig specifically, showed that the previous night they had played in Leeds so it wouldn’t have been beyond the realms of possibility that the next gig could have been in the North East. My mate Robin says he only saw them once though and he went to every gig going. His comment in the article about the Bee Bees being at No 1 would certainly place the gig around the back end of 1987. Has my memory misled me again? Has it shifted and re-edited the truth to suit my own personal narrative? As Robin pointed out to me, memory is a cruel temptress.\n\nMica Paris launched her career with this debut single “My One Temptation” and it is a career that has extended into the present day although the hits dropped off completely back in the 90s. It’s an accomplished track (and that’s coming from me who doesn’t really get R ‘n’ B) with a lush production and unhurried tempo allied to Mica’s sweet vocals.\n\nTaken from the album “So Good” which would yield a further three hit singles, it made the Top 10 peaking at No 7 and remains Mica’s biggest hit to this day. She diversified in later life beyond music into theatre, TV presenting and writing and surely only Ruby Turner and Beverly Knight rival her as one of the UK’s most well known and enduring soul singers. The least said about losing out to Carol Decker on TV show Hit Me, Baby, One More Time back in 2005 the better though.\n\nIf ever there was an example of an artist sticking to a formula to write a follow up to a very successful album then surely Scritti Politti’s third album “Provision” is it. The musical landscape had shifted a bit in the three years since the release of the majorly successful “Cupid & Psyche 85” so the decision to record a very similar sounding album was maybe not the correct one in retrospect. Lead single “Oh Patti (Don’t Feel Sorry for Loverboy)” is a perfectly pretty pop tune but it’s so lightweight it almost disappears into the ether. A respectable No 13 peak didn’t foretell the impending commercial slide that was about to happen. Two subsequent singles “Boom! There She Was” and “First Boy in This Town (Lovesick)” – Green Gartside liked his titles to have brackets a bit too much – failed to make the Top 40 at all and the album, despite going Top 10 and being certified Gold, was critically received as ‘meh’ by most reviewers.\n\nI can’t find the TOTP performance clip online so here’s the official promo video. In both versions, Green’s clothing choices were surely the inspiration for Jason Donovan’s wardrobe advisor when he followed then girlfriend Kylie into the charts the following year.\n\nOh and one more thing, check out this bizarre piece of pop trivia out courtesy of @TOTPFacts:\n\nThe Top 10:\n\n10. S’Express – “Theme From S’Express”\n\n9. Narada Michael Walden – “Divine Emotion”\n\n8. Aztec Camera – “Somewhere In My Heart”\n\n7. Prefab Sprout – “The King Of Rock ‘N’ Roll”\n\n6. Belinda Carlisle – “Circle In The Sand”\n\n5. New Order – “Blue Monday ’88”\n\n4. Liverpool FC – “Anfield Rap”\n\n3. Fairground Attraction – “Perfect”\n\n2. Kylie Minogue – “Got To Be Certain”\n\n1. Wet Wet Wet / Billy Bragg – “With A Little Help From My Friends” / “She’s Leaving Home”: The Billy Bragg appearance from the other week has been consigned to the archives and the Wets are back to ensure that what we remember most about this set of Beatles cover is Marti Pellow’s inane grinning.\n\nYes I typed that correctly…a set of Beatles covers. Largely forgotten over the course of the intervening 31 years is the fact that as well as Wet Wet Wet and Billy Bragg, there were a whole load of other musicians who contributed Fab Four cover versions to an album called “Sgt. Pepper Knew My Father”. So who else was on the album? I didn’t know but a quick search of the internet provided the answer. Whilst there were a couple of more mainstream names to go alongside Clydebank’s finest (Hue And Cry, The Christians), there were some really left field names on there as well such as Sonic Youth, The Fall and…well, Timperley’s finest….\n\n…and tonight Mr Kite is topping the bill……you know he is, he really is.\n\nOK, well anything coming after Frank Sidebottom was going to be a disappointment and Heart were, (they really were). “What About Love” was the latest instalment of their re-issue campaign in the wake of their breakthrough hit in the UK “Alone” the previous year.\n\nApparently the video was directed by David Mallet whose previous work included David Bowie’s “Ashes To Ashes” and “Radio Ga Ga” by Queen but you wouldn’t know it from this load of garbage which comes over likes a scene from a poor man’s Flashdance.\n\n“What About Love” peaked at No 14 on its re-release in the UK.\n\nOrder of appearance Artist Song Did I Buy it?\n\n1\n\nDebbie Gibson Out OF The Blue No but I think my wife had the album\n\n2\n\nLA mix Check This Out Of course not\n\n3\n\nOfra Haza Im Nin Alu I did not\n\n4\n\nClimie Fisher This Is Me Really weak effort – no\n\n5\n\nAswad Give A Little Love Just terrible – another no\n\n6\n\nThe Style Council Life At A Top People’s Health Farm I don’t think even my Weller disciple brother bought this one – no\n\n7\n\nHothouse Flowers Don’t Go No but my wife had the album it was taken from (“People”) on cassette\n\n8\n\nMica Paris My One Temptation Nah\n\n9\n\nScritti Politti Oh Patti (Don’t Feel Sorry For Loverboy) Pretty tune but not purchase worthy\n\n10\n\nWet Wet Wet With A Little Help From My Friends Nope\n\n11\n\nHeart What About Love No\n\nDisclaimer\n\nOK – here’s the thing – the TOTP episodes are only available on iPlayer for a limited amount of time so the link to the programme below only works for about another month so you’ll have to work fast if you want to catch the whole show as I can’t find the full programme on YouTube.\n\nhttps://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/m0007zd3/top-of-the-pops-26051988\n\nI make no claim to the rights of this show and all ownership and contents including logos and graphics belongs totally to the BBC or copyright holder(s).\n\nAll opinions on the music and artists featured are my own. Sorry if you don’t agree.\n\nSome bed time reading?\n\nhttp://likepunkneverhappened.blogspot.com/2018/05/may-18-31-1988_18.html\n\nThis is my 200th TOTP Rewind post! 200! I have written 427,224 words exactly in the previous 199 posts since the first one in February 2017 and I have covered over five years worth of TOTP repeats starting in Jan 1983 up to April 1988 so far. A big thank you to anyone who has ever looked at my blog and read any of my TOTP reviews! I try to include my recollections of the songs and artists featured as I consumed them at the time. Alongside that I have been known to throw in some of the personal stuff that I can remember. During the years covered in this blog, I have gone from the age of 14 to 19 so quite a lot has changed for me. I started out as a wet behind the ears school kid whose social contact with anyone female outside of my family was zero to a second year Polytechnic student with a girlfriend who would become my wife. I plan to carry on with the blog and see out the decade seeing as I’ve come this far and am not that far away from the end now.\n\nSo who are the lucky acts to feature in my milestone post? It’s a curious assortment for sure. Cheesy pop, synth pop, rock, sample heavy dance, boy band, the poppier end of R’N’B and… T’Pau (not sure how to categorise them). Tonight’s presenters are …oh shit….Steve Wright and Bruno Brookes -two massive egos squeezing into our screens then.\n\nFirst on tonight are Bananarama...or is it? Well yes and no. It is but not the version that we have grown up with. This is Bananarama 2.0 (not that anybody would have used that term back then). Siobhan has gone and been replaced by Jacquie O’Sullivan who was described at the time in Smash Hits magazine as looking ‘a mite spooky’ by which I think they meant a bit of a goth. Having known Jacquie for a number of years before this monumental happening (O’Sullivan had been in rockabilly punksters The Shillelagh Sisters in the early 80s) she was the unanimous choice as a replacement for Siobhan Indeed. Fahey herself even endorsed her. So a couple of questions at this point…why did Siobhan leave and why did they feel they needed a replacement for her at all? Apparently the Stock, Aitken and Waterman studios with whom the girls had thrown their lot in was not the most politically correct work environment and Fahey had grown tired of the constant sexist remarks from the SAW producers and split. As for why they still needed to remain a trio, I’m not sure especially given that they operated as a duo from 1992 to the present day (bar the reunion tour with Fahey of last year).\n\nInitially the change appeared flawless with Jacquie taking up the baton seamlessly as her first single with the ‘nanas – “I Want You Back” – which was re-recorded to include Jacquie’s vocals instead of Siobhan’s – peaking at No 5. However, behind the scenes, it wasn’t so harmonious. In a Guardian interview earlier this year O’Sullivan said:\n\n“I was a feral young girl, I’d come from a band with a punk mentality (girl group the Shillelagh Sisters) and literally didn’t wash, I was so wild, and when I joined this band that felt like a machine, I didn’t deal with it very well. I was self-medicating, not turning up for interviews, and at the end it got so bad that Hillary [Shaw], our manager, would be ringing round hotels to see if I was there, cos we were supposed to be flying off to do a show.”\n\nThere were rumours coming out of said machine that O’Sullivan felt like she had never been accepted as a fully fledged member of the group by Keren and Sarah and was more of an employee and, after paying her band dues for three years and still being referred to as the new girl, she left.\n\nPop music fans seem more accepting of change these days though – look at the case of The Sugababes and their endless revolving door recruitment policy. Times certainly changed for Jacquie who is now a yoga teacher and massage therapist.\n\nIn this TOTP performance, they seem a lot more choreographed and rehearsed than ever before which may have been a deliberate move to show a united front and certainly O’Sullivan doesn’t seem phased up there as a part of the 80s biggest UK all girl act. Wonder if she would have taken part in a show in that reunion tour if asked?\n\nStill cruising on up the charts is Natalie Cole with “Pink Cadillac”. I’ve been thinking what Natalie’s version of the song reminds me of and I’ve finally got there. It could be a companion piece to Aretha Franklin’s 1985 US hit “Freeway Of Love”. No really, listen…\n\nSee? Anyway, Natalie would see out the decade with two almost identical big slushy ballads in “I Live For Your Love” and “Miss You Like Crazy” before paying tribute to her father Nat with her “Unforgettable… with Love” covers album in 1991. Sadly she died in 2015 from heart failure following a kidney transplant .\n\nHere’s Climie Fisher next riding the crest of their own particular wave with “Love Changes Everything”. Simon Climie goes a bit creepy right at the start of the song where he kneels down and sings directly to some random member of the TOTP audience and then tousles her hair at the end.\n\nIt put me in mind of a scene from the greatest rock movie ever made (in my opinion) Stardust when Paul Nicholas’s character Johnny breaks rank from the band to do a similar thing. Sorry about the gratuitous ‘do you two fancy a grind?’ stuff in the preamble.\n\nDespite that ill advised move, Climie looks a lot more comfortable in his role as lead singer than he did when he first appeared on the show earlier in the year. Also, has the guitarist pinched that silver guitar off Erasure’s Vince Clarke. It looks just like the one he had in the “Sometimes” video.\n\nThis week’s Breakers start with Def Leppard who, having finally achieved success in the home country, are milking it for all its worth. “Armageddon It” was the fourth single (of six) taken from their album “Hysteria” and was a creditable No 11 hit over here. Their US fans remained even more infatuated with the band though and they made the song a No 3 smash.\n\nThe single’s dumb play on words title is excruciating but they would continue in this vein into the next decade. Early ’90s single “Let’s Get Rocked” with its lyrics about being chastised by a father for not taking out ‘the trash’ nor tidying their room was lame beyond belief – singer Joe Elliot was 32 at the time of recording those lyrics! Follow up “Make Love Like A Man”…well…let’s not even go there.\n\nWe arrive at one of the records of the year. S’Express was essentially producer and DJ Mark Moore and he used that vehicle to ride the wave of the UK acid house explosion. We’d already seen a number of dance tracks in the charts even at this early stage in the year many of which plundered heavily the sample culture but Mark Moore was the first I think to take such a track to No 1 in the mainstream national chart.\n\nRelying heavily on samples as diverse as Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry, Debbie Harry and Rose Royce (there’s even a bit of Yazoo in there apparently), “Theme from S-Express” was a chart sensation. Now I was still very unsure about all this dance music being in the Top 40 but my God this was an irresistible tune and no mistake. I think I even strutted my stuff to it more than once down at some of Sunderland’s nighteries. I distinctly remember being in the queue for one such nightclub (Ku Club I think) and hearing the DJ playing this track and some card singing ‘I caught the pox off you’ to the “I Got the Hots for You” sample. How we laughed!\n\nAn odd release from a band trying to consolidate their recent runaway success next. “Sex Talk (Live)” by T’Pau was the fourth single to be taken from their “Bridge Of Spies” album. So was it a brave or foolhardy decision to promote a song called “Sex Talk”? The stuffy BBC may have banned it – they had a history of doing so with Frankie’s “Relax” and George Michael’s “I Want Your Sex” – but then that controversy may have raised their profile even more. And why was a live version released as a single? The album version isn’t live. Apparently it was released to give fans a taste of what the band were like live and to stimulate sales of tour tickets. In the end nothing much happened – it wasn’t banned and it was only a very moderate hit and peaked at number 23.\n\nI guess it was an attempt by the band to show that as well as doing epic ballads (“China In Your Hand”) and frothy pop (“Heart And Soul”) they could rock as well. It’s a decent effort and they had similar songs on the album like “Monkey House” but were they in danger of spreading themselves too thin? I come back to my question at the top of the post – how do you categorise T’Pau?\n\nI really never realised how many hits Jermaine Stewart had! Sure, we could all reel off “We Don’t Have to Take Our Clothes Off”. Some of us could maybe even dredge up “Say It Again” from our memory banks but “Get Lucky”?! Surely even the most ardent 80s pop aficionados would struggle with that one?! And what’s he done with his hair?! In an interview with Smash Hits magazine he said that he achieved this new look by the use of lots of hair clips and lots of blow drying. He also admitted that he’d only just started shaving in the last two weeks and that he had to ask his mate Jeffrey Daniels from Shalamar to show him how! That can’t be right surely? He was 30 at the time! I’m pretty sure I started shaving by the time I was at least 16 if not before.\n\nNot quite as startling a revelation as the shaving story but “Get Lucky” was co-written by Simon Climie of Climie Fisher fame whom we saw earlier. What are the chances?!\n\nHave we ever had a studio performance by Jellybean before? I’m thinking they were all videos previously. He’s here with his latest female vocalist Adele Bertei for the single “Just A Mirage”.Now I’ve got to be honest, I’m not sure I ever knew what Adele Bertei looked like but whatever I was expecting it wasn’t this. She looks a bit like Suzanne Vega doesn’t she? Pretty cool actually in her timeless leather jacket. Jellybean, on the other hand, looks like a proper knacker. Apparently it wasn’t just his clothes that were objectionable though. Here’s @TOTPFacts:\n\nWhy am I not surprised?!\n\nAnother American act whose made the trip across the pond to our shores is Pebbles. Although her profile in this country is that of an 80s one hit wonder, in the US she was much more of a big deal. Not only did she have three Top 5 hits over there (including “Girlfriend”) but in the 90s she went onto manage R’N’B super group TLC.\n\nI guess Pebbles’s image here was more what I was expecting Adele Bertei to be sporting. Sort of Sheila E’s younger sister. Anyway, listening back to it now, the section of the song with the ‘To believe or not to believe ,that is the question” lyrics and the pronunciation of the word ‘question’ as “kwest-ee-on’ is all a bit shouty and unnecessary it seems to me but then I am 51 now and I was 19 then so maybe that explains that.\n\nThe Top 10:\n\n10. Aswad – “Don’t Turn Around”\n\n9. Hazell Dean – “Who’s Leaving Who”\n\n8. Taylor Dayne – “Prove Your Love”\n\n7. Eighth Wonder – “I’m Not Scared”\n\n6. Sinitta – “Cross My Broken Heart”\n\n5. Fleetwood Mac – “Everywhere”\n\n4. Tiffany -“Could’ve Been”\n\n3. Climie Fisher – “Love Changes Everything”\n\n2. Bros – “Drop The Boy”\n\n1. Pet Shop Boys – “Heart”: Like many of their songs that were hits around this time, this one was originally demoed for their first album “Please” but eventually made it onto second album “Actually”. I never liked it that much and I’m not alone in that. Chris Lowe himself is on record as saying “It just shows that chart positions aren’t the be all and end all. ‘Heart’ isn’t in the same league as ‘Being Boring’. Talking of being boring, isn’t it about time Chris ditched that sailor’s outfit look? How long had he been persisting with that?!\n\nGod is this still near the top of the charts? In a Smash Hits interview where they reviewed their own debut album “Push”, Bros described “Drop The Boy” as being “a song about our generation” and that “we’re the only group that write songs about our generation”. Blimey! Don’t tell The Who!\n\nOrder of appearance Artist Song Did I Buy it?\n\n1\n\nBananarama I Want You Back Hideously catchy but hideously uncool at the same time – no\n\n2\n\nNatalie Cole Pink Cadillac Nope\n\n3\n\nClimie Fisher Love Changes Everything Yes, yes I did.

Sorry if you don’t agree.\n\nSome bed time reading?\n\nhttp://likepunkneverhappened.blogspot.com/2018/04/april-6-19-1988.html\n\nThese TOTP repeats are coming thick and fast now that the Women’s World Cup is over and back in 1988 we are nearing Easter. Tonight’s presenters are two old hands in Simon Bates and Peter Powell and to quote Spitting Image’s “Chicken Song”, check out Simon’s ‘girly curly hair’! He promises us the new A-ha video in his very first words to screen – hmm. More of that later but first up is Sinitta with “Cross My Broken Heart” and she’s wearing (just about!) the exact same outfit from the promo video we saw last week. We’ve been here before I think but exactly how old is Sinitta? Her Wikipedia page says she is 50 but other sources have her as 55. In a Smash Hits interview she said her date of birth was 19/10/66 which would have made her 21 at the time and 52 today. Simon Cowell threw her a 50th birthday party but she claimed it was her 45th. Apparently The Sun printed her birth certificate in 2013 and at that time she was 49 so by my maths she is 55. The mystery of how old she is get s even weirder as according to OK magazine she has to keep updating her age online as someone keeps changing it! However old she is, she looks amazingly well on it and has aged considerably better than this song which is written on the back of a fag packet Stock, Aitken and Waterman codswallop.\n\nNow then, this A-ha video that Simon Bates promised us is up next. Except, what we get isn’t a video is it Simon? No – it’s just the band performing “Stay On These Roads” in the studio of another pop music show that is probably not TOTP. I guess technically it is a video that TOTP are showing but come on Bates – it’s not the new A-ha video that you promised! No – because this is the official promo video….\n\nIt’s not hard this presenting lark is it? Do a few links in between songs, don’t get the names wrong and look a like your’e at the best party ever but Simes can’t even do that properly.\n\nAnyway, back to A-ha. This was the lead single from their new album also called “Stay On These Roads” (although they did shove their James Bond theme “The Living Daylights” on the album as well so technically that was the first single from it). I recall the band being interviewed on Going Live by Sarah Greene about the album title and her saying she was surprised they didn’t call it “Stay On These Pathways” or something like that and the band just looking at her completely non-plussed. I digress though. Nobody could have known it at the time but it would prove to be the band’s last ever Top 5 hit in the UK and their last Top 10 hit for 18 years! I thought it sounded great – all moody, towering and magnificent. Not everybody liked it though- Andy Bell of Erasure reviewed it in Smash Hits magazine and said of it:\n\n“It’s much more bland than anything else they’ve written….Perhaps they realise they’ve had their heyday and are going downhill so they’ve decided to try and be serious and credible all of a sudden. It’s a real shame”.\n\nPerhaps I was wrong that nobody could’ve known this would be their last Top 5 hit – Andy must have had a crystal ball. As for his accusation of trying to be serious, conversely the subsequent singles lifted from the album were some of the poppiest songs the band ever did.\n\nIt’s time for another dance anthem having to somehow be performed in the TOTP studio without everyone involved looking like complete chumps. This particular example comes from Simon Harris with “Bass (How Low Can You Go)”. I presume that’s Simon behind the decks in the red puffer jacket but he’s also brought some mates up on stage with him to ensure the embarrassment is distributed evenly. There’s some people in obligatory shades and rapper medallions swaggering about and mouthing the sampled spoken word bits of course but nothing can save it from being the excruciating shambles that it is. T’other Simon confirms Harris’s identity at the song’s end and says he’s looking good too. Only compared to you Bates, only compared to you.\n\nThe Breakers begin with Wet Wet Wet‘s fourth single and indeed fourth hit “Temptation”. My wife had the “Popped In Souled Out” album and I always thought this was the best track on it. It’s a sprawling epic of a song compared to say “Sweet Little Mystery” with some great instrumentation thrown into the mix from the organ sustains to a headlining guitar solo. It almost sounds like it’s too big a song to be a four minute pop single somehow. And then of course there’s that line. “Won’t waste my fucking spirit” was deemed far too profane for daytime airplay and was re-recorded as “Won’t waste my angry spirit” for the single edit.\n\n“Temptation” should have been a massive hit in my book but its No 12 peak probably reflected the fact that the album had been out for six months (including the Xmas period) so getting fans to buy a fourth track from it might have been pushing it. Also, who wanted the sanitised version anyway?\n\nDebbie Gibson‘s debut single was her second hit in the UK after it failed to set the charts alight in 1987 on initial release. After “Shake Your Love” was a hit and established her in this country, record label Atlantic wisely did the math and came up with the answer that “Only In My Dreams” should be given another shot. Their sums added up as it became a No 11 hit at the second time of asking.\n\nPure bubblegum pop (well what did we expect from a 16 year old?) it’s well crafted with lots of oohs and aahs included to make it extra palatable for the teenybop market and to my ears was more radio friendly than ‘Shake Your Love”.\n\nThe video is shot partly in b/w and partly in colour to demarcate dream sequences from reality. All pretty obvious stuff and guess what? Her ideal guy only exists in her dreams! Never!\n\nThe song that duo Climie Fisher are best known for is next. As with previous Breaker Debbie Gibson, the single “Love Changes Everything” bombed on its initial release in 1987 (not that I was aware of it then) but was re-issued following the success of “Rise To The Occasion”. This time, thanks to their raised profile and a lot of airplay, it raced all the way to No 2 in the charts helped in a very small way by my purchase of the cassette single (or cassingle as they were sometimes called). I thought this was a great pop record – tremendously catchy chorus, and a nice feel to it. Oh God, I’m only one step away from going into full on Dad mode and saying ‘It’s got a good beat and you can dance to it’! I’m not going to apologise for liking this song though.\n\nThat chorus had the odd little idiosyncrasy of the word ‘changes’ being repeated twice (presumably to make it scan) and curiously, just a year later, another song called “Love Changes Everything” was in the charts using a similar trick. Michael Ball’s treatment of the Andrew Lloyd Webber song from the musical Aspects Of Love repeated the word ‘love’ rather than ‘changes’ though. Suffice to say, I infinitely preferred Climie Fisher’s song to Michael Ball’s.\n\nThe video seems to have a Wizard Of Oz theme in that it reminds me of the windswept Midwestern USA setting for the first part of the film. Maybe it’s the b/w effect. “Love Changes Everything” was a hit around Europe as well as the UK and even a reasonable sized one in America where it peaked at No 23.\n\nSimon Bates goes all incredulous for the next song which is “Can I Play With Madness” by Iron Maiden. Simes just can’t believe that it’s the highest new entry at No 4! Not sure why he can’t get his head around it – by this point in their career the band had already amassed 14 Top 40 singles so it wasn’t as if they weren’t regular visitors to the charts.\n\nWhat was it about? Here’s songfacts.com again:\n\n‘This song is about a young man who seeks answers to the supernatural and goes to an old prophet with a magical crystal ball. The prophet looks at his crystal ball, but the young man sees nothing there (hence the line “There’s no vision there at all!”). The prophet laughs at the man, because the man is “too blind to see” the vision. But the fact is he is too blind to see the real truth which is that there really is no vision and he is being cheated by the prophet’.\n\nEverybody got that? Good. The young man in question should have gone to see Andy Bell of Erasure – he was good at seeing into the future. Well, A-ha’s at least.\n\nMy mate Robin did his dissertation on representations of madness in the media. Wonder if he referenced Iron Maiden?\n\nFor those under the impression that Tiffany was a one hit wonder, think again. Here she is with her follow up to “I Think We’re Alone Now” which is a ‘real tear -jerker’ according to Peter Powell. “Could’ve Been” is indeed a big weepy ballad and listening back to it now it sounds much more country & western than I remembered. In a 2017 interview with songfacts.com Tiffany explained:\n\n‘I also was raised listening to country music, which is the king and the queen of heartbreak songs. So, there was always love gone wrong or something like that, and I started singing those songs when I was about six years old.’\n\nThere you go then… the song’s writer Lois Blaisch told songfacts that:\n\n‘They didn’t make a video and there was a reason why: because she was 14 years old and people felt that she was too young, especially if they looked at her, to really convince them that she had been through that. And she had not been through that – she was 14 years old. She hadn’t yet had a heartbreak that severe. So she never did make a video on that song.’\n\nExcept it is a video isn’t it? Admittedly it’s just Tiffany performing in concert with a few extra shots of her posing with some good old fashioned British bobbies and fans queueing to meet her in a shop PA but a video all the same. Oh God it’s like Simon Bates and A-ha all over again!\n\n“Could’ve Been” reached No 4 over here and was Tiffany’s second No 1 record in the US.\n\nThe Top 10…\n\n10. Belinda Carlisle – “I Get Weak”\n\n9. Erasure – “Ship Of Fools”\n\n8. Heart – “These Dreams / Never”\n\n7. Primitives – “Crash”\n\n6. Vanessa Paradis -“Joe Le Taxi”\n\n5. Tiffany – “Could’ve Been”\n\n4. Iron Maiden – “Can I Play With Madness”\n\n3. Kylie Minogue – “I Should Be So Lucky”\n\n2. Bros – “Drop The Boy”\n\n1. Aswad – “Don’t Turn Around”: They’re No 1 and Peter Powell is doing that whole sixth form thing of ‘I always liked them, even before they were successful’. To be fair, I think I heard “54-46 Was My Number” for the first time on his radio show so maybe he has a point. “Don’t Turn Around” however is, was and forever will be shite.\n\nContinuing her run of uptempo numbers followed by a ballad comes Whitney Houston with “Where Do Broken Hearts Go”. This was the fourth of five singles taken from her “Whitney” album and was yet again a No 1 for her in the US. It was a different story in the UK though where it only made No 14. According to Wikipedia, her performance in the the video’s train station scene convinced Kevin Costner of her acting abilities for The Bodyguard film. Somebody else who could give a good performance of this song was my friend Susan at Poly who could sing it word perfect including the key change where Whitney leaves a slight pause between ‘broken’ and ‘hearts’.\n\nWe finish where we started with Sinitta who professed her love of Whitney in Smash Hits as follows:\n\n‘She’s it isn’t she? She’s tall – she’s 5’10’ – she’s gorgeous, she’s successful, she’s happy, she’s got perfect teeth’\n\nDidn’t she almost have it all? Sadly for Whitney, Sinitta’s belief that she did would not prove to be true.\n\nOrder of appearance Artist Song Did I Buy it?\n\n1\n\nSinitta Cross My Broken Heart As if\n\n2\n\nA-ha Stay On These Roads No but I have it on their greatest hits CD\n\n3\n\nSimon Harris Bass (How Low Can You Go) Too low for me – no\n\n4\n\nWet Wet Wet Temptation No but my wife had the album\n\n5\n\nDebbie Gibson Only In My Dreams Ditto\n\n6\n\nClimie Fisher Love Changes Everything Yes, yes I did.

Sorry if you don’t agree.\n\nSome bed time reading?\n\nhttp://likepunkneverhappened.blogspot.com/2018/03/march-23-april-5-1988.html\n\nWe’re only into the second TOTP show of 1988 and already we are seeing the same songs being repeated from just the other week. Of the nine acts on tonight’s broadcast, we have already seen six of them before. What a swizz as Smash Hits magazine might have said! Anyway, let’s make the best of it. Tonight’s presenters are Simon Mayo and …hell’s teeth! check out Gary Davies’s jumper! Even in the 80s that must have been considered loud! It’s fucking atrocious! Let’s hope for better from the musical turns…\n\nClimie Fisher are first up tonight and they’re doing the hip-hop remix version of their hit “Rise To The Occasion” again. I guess it’s more aligned with the party atmosphere of the TOTP studio than the ballad version. Or maybe they just wanted to get in first with the “I know you gonna dig this” line before their adversary in this particular peculiar competition Krush are on later. Simon Climie doesn’t look any more comfortable out there at the front than he did the other week and struggles to get his jerky and awkward dance moves in time with his backing singers. He does however have magnificently towering 80s hair. I may have been going for that look myself at this time.\n\nThe instrumental interlude in the middle of the song enables a truly cringeworthy interaction between Climie and Rob Fisher (on keyboards) where they act out the spoken word samples…\n\nSC: Come on Buddy get with the beat\n\nRF: I don’t know what you mean\n\nSC: Get with the beat\n\nRF: I’m a little rusty on it. Don’t touch that *brushes SC off his keyboard*\n\nDear oh dear….what were they thinking?!\n\nListening back to it now, Simon Climie’s voice is really quite unusual. Sort of strained and raspy but it kind of worked anyway. “Rise To The Occasion” would rise no further than this week’s peak of No 10.\n\nOh blimey! This may well have been the UK’s first ever glimpse of Tiffany. The 16 year old singing sensation from out of Norwalk, California was briefly a megastar with a No 1 record in both the US and the UK. Firstly though, a point of order. It was not a shopping centre tour Simon Mayo, it was a shopping mall tour. OK – he was probably just anglicising it for the UK audience but even so. Anyway, back to Tiffany Renee Darwish to quote her full name for her take on all this in a recent Classic Pop magazine interview:\n\n“The first couple of weekends weren’t successful at all,” she remembers. “We had like two people show up. We had people yelling at me because I was too loud, and business owners were not too happy with me being outside their stores. But as radio stations started to play the single and say that I was appearing at the local mall, it started to catch fire. We went from people sitting in the chairs just because they were there, to the point where you couldn’t move. It was overwhelming”.\n\nInterestingly some 30 years later and the idea of musical acts playing in shopping centres (OK Mayo you win) finally took fire in this country with the likes of The Pigeon Detectives and Black Grape playing in North Point Shopping Centre in Bransholme, Hull in the last couple of years.\n\nBack to 1988 though and I had no idea that “I Think We’re Alone Now” was a cover version – the original being done by Tommy James and the Shondells in 1967 – but it was difficult to ignore the catchiness of Tiffany’s version. It was perfect Radio 1 playlist fodder and it was at No 1 within two weeks of its No 13 entry here. We’ll be seeing more of her in these repeats I’m sure.\n\nNot to be outdone in the “I know you gonna dig this” stakes, here come Krush with “House Arrest”. For some reason, the studio audience behind them have been kitted out with flashlights. Was this a house music thing? Never having been to a rave, my knowledge is limited. I know about the fluorescent glowsticks thing but were there flashlights being waved about as well?\n\nKrush didn’t release a follow up single immediately (one eventually appeared in 1992) while vocalist Ruth Joy committed to an ultimately unsuccessful solo career. Her 1992 long player “Pride And Joy” was critically well received but bombed commercially. Never mind. She can sleep at night safe in the knowledge that “House Arrest’ was considered a bangin’ tune in the nightclubs of Sunderland when I was a student there back in the day. Not that I danced to it. Obviously.\n\nAnother song we’ve seen before (I think it’s even just the same performance clip recycled). Ever wondered who the majors of Morris Minor And The Majors were? No I haven’t either but I’ve got to fill this bit of the post up with something and I used all my other ‘Morris Minor’ material up the last time they were on so….they were Rusty Wing and Phil Errup (as in ‘Fill ‘Er Up’). OK – not really that funny or interesting…\n\n…how about this then…ever wondered what the B-side to “Stutter Rap” was? Well it was this…\n\n…jeez..this is setting some new kind of low even for this blog (and I’ve posted some right shite on here). Enough!\n\nHere’s the Breakers to provide some relief. Woah, woah woah woah! Did Simon Mayo just describe these as ‘happening records’?! Hang your head in shame sir!\n\nNow I would have said that “Ideal World” by The Christians was a hit around Christmas ’87 rather than early in ’88 but seems I was wrong. My housemate Roy really liked this one and I distinctly recall jibing him about this being their Xmas single with it being a more gentle ballad than their previous output – maybe that’s the cause of my memory defect. Roy was right about the song though – easily their best in my opinion. As was the case with their earlier hits, “Ideal World” carried social commentary within its lyrics, this time about apartheid in South Africa and the divisions caused by the Berlin Wall. Listening back to it today depressingly it sounds just as relevant to the world’s problems as it did 31 years ago. I thought much the same when I saw the song’s writer Henry Priestman perform it live at the Beverly Folk festival in 2010.\n\n“Ideal World” would make No 14 on the UK Top 40 and was the most successful of the five singles taken from their self titled debut album.\n\nOh bollocks! In the year of the house music explosion and the dawning of rave culture, this sort of shit was still in the charts?! Sorry but I just didn’t/don’t get AC/DC. At the risk of sounding like my Dad when pronouncing judgement on the musical choices of my youth, it all sounds the same to me. “Heatseeker” was jet another of their interminable songs that follows exactly the same formula as all the rest. Look, I know this is heresy of the highest order to rock fans but it just bores me senseless.\n\n“Heatseeker” was the band’s biggest UK hit of the decade peaking at No 12.\n\nRight, that’s all the new songs dealt with but into the Top 10 crashes Terence Trent D’Arby with “Sign Your Name”. This week he’s in the studio and he’s still got his all male backing singers with him. This still looks ever so slightly incongruous to me not least because of the height difference between them. Despite a double bass, bongos and a xylophone player up there on stage with him, it all seems a little bit lacklustre to me . Maybe he would have been better off just sending the overly sensual video in again instead.\n\nThis week’s Top 10…\n\n10. Climie Fisher- “Rise To The Occasion”\n\n9. Joyce Sims – “Come into My Life”\n\n8. Terence Trent D’Arby – “Sign Your Name”\n\n7. The Stranglers – “All Day And All Of The Night”\n\n6. Wet Wet Wet – “Angel Eyes”\n\n5. Cher – “I Found Someone”\n\n4. Morris Minor and the Majors – “Stutter Rap”\n\n3. Krush – “House Arrest”\n\n2. Pet Shop Boys – “Always On My Mind”\n\n1. Belinda Carlisle – “Heaven Is A Place On Earth”: She’s made it! Ex Go-Go Belinda has usurped all other pretenders to the No 1 crown in the post Xmas lull and knocked Pet Shop Boys off their perch. I’m not sure why now but it seemed quite significant to me at the time that a soft rock number (albeit a catchy one) would be the country’s best selling single. Perhaps the most significant factor in this was that Belinda was a woman. Yes we’d had recent No 1s by solo female artists by the likes of Madonna and Whitney Houston but singing soft rock? Maybe I’d always associated this genre of music with US male musos with poodle rock hair hence my perception that this was something different. Of course this was the unenlightened 80s so there was lots of discussion around Belinda’s looks being the main driving force behind her success but the song has stood the test of time and is still played regularly on today’s airwaves.\n\nThe play out video is “Father Figure” by George Michael which we saw as a breaker in last weeks show. Now I’ve never given this song that much thought. Yep it’s “Father Figure” by George Michael from his “Faith” album was as far as my dissection of it went but if you look it up online…holy shit there’s a whole lot of traffic about this track most of it around the line ‘put your tiny hand in mine’. I’m not going to go any further own that line of enquiry but suffice to say I choose not to believe any of those conspiracy theories.\n\nOrder of appearance Artist Song Did I Buy it?\n\n1\n\nClimie Fisher Rise To The Occasion The hip hop remix was on my cassette single of their next release\n\n2\n\nTiffany I Think We’re Alone Now Not alone enough to be potentially caught paying for this record though – no\n\n3\n\nKrush House Arrest No – bloody new fangled music!\n\n4\n\nMorris Minor And The Majors Stutter Rap Nah\n\n5\n\nThe Christians Ideal World No but I have the album\n\n6\n\nAC/DC Heatseeker A big fat NO!\n\n7\n\nTerence Trent D’Arby Sign Your Name Nope\n\n8\n\nBelinda Carlisle Heaven Is A Place On Earth No but its on my iTunes\n\n9\n\nGeorge Michael Father Figure No but my sister had the album and played it constantly in the Summer of 1988\n\nDisclaimer\n\nOK – here’s the thing – the TOTP episodes are only available on iPlayer for a limited amount of time so the link to the programme below only works for about another month so you’ll have to work fast if you want to catch the whole show as I can’t find the full programme on YouTube.\n\nhttps://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/m00062g5/top-of-the-pops-14011988\n\nI make no claim to the rights of this show and all ownership and contents including logos and graphics belongs totally to the BBC or copyright holder(s).\n\nAll opinions on the music and artists featured are my own. Sorry if you don’t agree.\n\nSome bed time reading?\n\nhttp://likepunkneverhappened.blogspot.com/2018/01/january-13-26-1988.html\n\nAll of a sudden it’s New Year’s Eve! We missed the Xmas TOTP show due to the Mike Smith issue so here we are at the very end of 1987 with a sprinkling of new tunes and predictably at this time of the year, a few we’ve already seen before. So let’s say goodbye to ’87 (and possibly good riddance) with the help of presenters Gary Davies in one of the most 80s looking suits you could ever imagine and Peter Powell who has gone a much more casual route….\n\nUshering in the show and also pointing the way as to how 1988 would pan out are Krush with “House Arrest”. The “I know you gonna dig this ” sample at the start of the song would become almost ubiquitous for a while – in fact it features in another completely different song on this very show! As for Krush, I seem to remember that they were very much seen as cutting edge at the time leading the new revolution of British House music that would dominate the tail end of the decade. It’s hard to believe looking at the state of them here – the vocalist looks like she could be one of Kevin & Perry’s mates with her baseball style hat, rapper medallion and hackneyed crossed arms gestures – but their sound was being lauded as the future of music by those in the know. “One of the biggest dance records of the moment” says Peter Powell (I think he must have been one of those ‘in the know’ types). Did I like it? No, of course not. I thought it was awful and wasn’t into this new fangled house music at all as I had prematurely turned into my Dad it seems.\n\nAs was the case with a lot of house hits, Krush would be a one hit wonder act albeit a big one as “House Arrest” peaked at No 3.\n\nHere’s the Nat ‘King’ Cole video again for “When I Fall In Love”. Unlike with other artists from a bygone era who had enjoyed posthumous success when an old track was thrust back into the charts (Jackie Wilson for example), there didn’t appear to be any appetite for a re-releases project of Nat’s back catalogue. Indeed, we didn’t see him in our charts again until 1991 when his daughter Natalie took a version of “Unforgettable” to No 19 with a virtual duet with her father. Talking of Natalie, we may well be seeing some more of her in future TOTP repeats as she embarked on a run of five UK Top 40 hits (including two Top 5) over the next two years.\n\nThat second song making use of the “I know you gonna dig this ” sample is up next. Climie Fisher were Simon Climie who was a songwriter who had helped pen a No 1 record for George Michael and Aretha Franklin in “I Knew You Were Waiting (For Me)” and Rob Fisher a keyboardist who had tasted success in the US as part of another duo Naked Eyes in 1983 with a cover of “Always Something There to Remind Me” (which I’d actually bought). Despite this history, they always seemed unlikely pop stars to me though. Fisher was obviously the Chris Lowe of the two whilst Climie never seemed totally at ease with being the front man despite looking a bit like actor heart throb Richard Gere. Unlike Neil Tennant who turned being deadpan into an art form, Simon doesn’t seem to quite know how to play it up there on stage whilst performing their debut hit “Rise To The Occasion”. He’s gone for a vest and jeans look which is something Go West were pedalling nearly three years before. He’s also got a denim jacket that he’s holding as a prop – not quite sure why. Maybe it was his security blanket.\n\n“Rise To The Occasion” was on odd little footnote in the story of 80s pop music. The version performed on TOTP was the hip-hop mix version but the original version that I had heard first on the radio was a gently lilting ballad. The hip hop remix was quite a shock to the ears the first time I heard it. Completely different in style and sound, it was probably a canny marketing ploy to basically release two different versions of the same song. Essentially what the record label did was to plug into two potentially very disparate record buying markets. The ballad version would appeal to the teen crowd whilst the hip -hop remix hoped to ride the new ‘house music’ wave and pick up some sales there too. It worked as well with “Rise To The Occasion” making No 10 in the UK charts.\n\nI have to admit I quite liked both versions in the end although on reflection the ballad sounds a bit like the Lighthouse Family which is no recommendation at all. Peter Powell calls it perfectly at the song’s end when he advocates for a re-release of their earlier single “Love Changes Everything” which would follow “Rise To The Occasion” into the charts and all the way to No 2. I bought the cassette single of that one and I think it had the hip -hop version of “Rise” on there as an added track. Blimey – I had three songs featuring Rob Fisher (if you include Naked Eyes)?! Makes me sound like some sort of superfan!\n\nInto the Top 5 and No 1 bound is Belinda Carlisle with “Heaven Is A Place On Earth”. After the US TOTP performance recently we get the official promo video this time which, in an unlikely turn of events, was directed by actress Diane Keaton. The children running on the spot with the lit up globes has a feel of the video for New Order’s “True Faith” but really it was just a blatant advert to say how attractive Belinda was. In a year when another female solo artist by the name of Kylie would inspire a host of babies to be christened with the same name, I’m betting that there weren’t many children named Belinda in 1988. The power of Neighbours back in the day eh?\n\nDespite a career that brought her hits well into the 90s and one that is still going to this day, “Heaven Is A Place On Earth” would prove to be Belinda’s only No 1 record in the UK or the US, In 2017, a free weekly London publication described the song has having “one of the greatest key changes in musical history”. If you think that sounds like crap then catch it about 3.25 into the video…\n\nA novelty record next which I thought was mildly entertaining at the time but which would probably be seen as totally un-PC by today’s standards. Morris Minor and the Majors was essentially a vehicle for comic Tony Hawks and “Stutter Rap” was deemed funny enough by UK record buyers to make it a No 4 hit. Parodying the Beastie Boys music (specifically their song “No Sleep Till Brooklyn”) and fashion style of the time, it also referenced Paul Hardcastle’s “19” and Chaka Khan’s “I Feel For You” to enable the stutter joke. I don’t remember any outrage about the song’s making fun of the condition of stuttering. My mate at Poly Pete had a stutter but I don’t recall having any conversations with him about this record. I could be wrong of course – it is 32 years ago so my memory may have failed me.\n\nThere was a follow up single which lampooned the Stock, Aitken and Waterman sound that was eating the singles charts in 1988 called “This Is The Chorus” but it flopped in the UK. It did however feature the lyrics:\n\n“This is the key change, this is the key change\n\nIt’s a standard device to stop us sounding mundane\n\nThis is the key change, a fabulous key change\n\nBut we’ve done it the once, so we won’t do it again”\n\nI’m not sure it was any where near to rivalling the key change in “Heaven Is A Place On Earth” though.\n\nTony Hawks is still knocking about as a contributor to radio and TV panel games and wrote a series of books about his idiosyncratic adventures such as Round Ireland with a Fridge and Playing the Moldovans at Tennis both of which I read and enjoyed. He even did one called One Hit Wonderland where he attempted to get another Top 40 hit a decade or so after “Stutter Rap” somewhere in the world to win a dinner party bet. He ended up doing so in Albania with a song featuring Norman Wisdom. I’ve no idea if Mr Grimsdale was part of the collaboration.\n\nThe 80s had seen the next act prioritising their film career over music but now she was back. Cher‘s only 80s appearance in the UK charts had been on Meatloaf’s “Dead Ringer For Love” hit back in ’81 and even then she was uncredited. We’d seen far more of her on the sliver screen where she had appeared in four films in the last three years. Having signed with a new label though, her return to the music charts was plotted carefully and tracks for her self titled album were written by the likes of Jon Bon Jovi, Richie Sambora and Michael Bolton and it was the last of these that supplied her comeback song “I Found Someone”.\n\nNow I never knew this at the time but it was originally written for Laura Branigan of “Gloria” fame and she did record a version if it. Want to hear it? Here you go…\n\nYeah it’s nothing to write home about is it. Except….what’s that weird noise that punctuates the chorus? The boiiiing noise? It reminds me of that bit in the old theme tune to Grandstand. You know…\n\nAnyway, Cher’s version was a much more beefed up rock sound and it seemed that she had found the genre to put her back into the frame as a credible recording artist. with “I Found Someone” going Top 10 in the US and Top 5 over here. And that video that Peter Powell talks up in his intro? I’m guessing the fuss is all about Cher’s outfit (or lack of one). She would repeat the outfit and musical style trick two years later with the single and video for her song “If I Could Turn Back Time” but that’s all for another day and another post.\n\nWet Wet Wet were becoming TOTP regulars by this point. “Angel Eyes (Home And Away)” had given their third consecutive Top 10 hit. Still touring in 2019, the band now have a new lead singer – Liberty X’s Kevin Simm. I wonder if audiences catching their current shows feel as it they have actually seen the real Wet Wet Wet. It’s a similar story with Spandau Ballet who replaced Tony Hadley recently with Ross William Wild but he has subsequently left the band so where does that leave them? It’s a hard trick to pull off to continue to have success when a band changes singer. For every Manfred Mann, there’s a Haircut One Hundred. Also, I am fascinated by the story of how The Beatles drafted in Jimmy Nicol to replace Ringo when he had tonsillitis. Did the crowds that saw the shows with Jimmy on the drums actually see The Beatles?\n\nWith some nice synchronicity, 1988 would see Wet Wet Wet score their first No 1 with a version of The Beatles’ “With A Little Help From My Friends”.\n\nThe Top 10:\n\n10. Wet Wet Wet – “Angel Eyes (Home And Away)”\n\n9. T’Pau – “China In Your Hand”\n\n8. Michael Jackson – “The Way You Make Me Feel”\n\n7. Rick Astley – “When I Fall In Love”\n\n6. Alison Moyet – “Love Letters”\n\n5. Belinda Carlisle – “Heaven Is A Place On Earth”\n\n4. Nat ‘King’ Cole – “When I Fall In Love”\n\n3. Mel and Kim – “Rockin’ Around The Christmas Tree”\n\n2. The Pogues / Kirsty MacColl – “Fairytale Of New York”\n\n1. Pet Shop Boys – “Always On My Mind”: The Xmas No 1 of 1987 enters the New Year as the top selling single also. We get the video for this show featuring a cameo by actor Joss Ackland. It’s all very dreamlike and in keeping with the duo’s arty pretensions especially when you consider it was a part of their “It Couldn’t H"
