        "text": "Grace Chatto, cellist in the chart-topping band Clean Bandit, chooses the Tracks of My Years. Together with fellow members, brothers Jack and Luke Patterson, she won a Grammy Award for Best Dance Recording in 2015 for 'Rather Be' with Jess Glynne on lead vocals and was nominated for two Brit Awards in 2015 and 2017. The classically trained musician directed the video for 'Rockabye' in 2016 featuring rapper Sean Paul and singer Anne-Marie which went on to become the Christmas number one of that year. Grace also directed the video for the single 'Symphony' the following year which contained an entire orchestra and featured Zara Larsson on vocals. The band's recent single 'Higher' with rapper Iann Dior was released in February, and there's more new music to come later on in the year. As of 2016 Clean Bandit have sold over 13 million singles and 1.6 million albums worldwide.\n\nLast November, Grace performed on 'Stop Crying Your Heart Out' as part of Radio 2's All Stars' Children in Need charity single. The song debuted at number seven on the Official UK Singles Chart and number one on both the Official UK Singles Sales Chart and the Official UK Singles Download Chart.\n\nGrace is also on the renowned PRS For Music List which includes a hundred of the most influential female songwriters and composers in the UK. The 100 Women Changing Music chart, which is made up of PRS members, features the likes of Adele, Lily Allen, Dua Lipa, Jorja Smith and Annie Lennox. Nearly two thousand women registered to become members last year and almost two thirds of those who joined were under the age of 30.\n\nThe next two tracks Grace has chosen come from No Doubt and Puff Daddy featuring Faith Evans. Ken also has the love song and PopMaster. To get in touch email Ken.Bruce@bbc.co.uk"
