Green\n\nTenor Sax, Flute, Vocals\n\nLegendary Jazz saxophonist Dr. Herman Washington Green was born in Memphis, TN on May 27, 1930. His father, Herman Washington, played saxophone with W.C. Handy’s band back in the 1920s, and Herman continued the tradition by playing his first professional shows on Beale Street with Phineas Newborn, Sr.’s big band in 1945, with his childhood friends Phineas, Jr. and Calvin Newborn.\n\nHerman was playing on Beale Street in 1947 when his friend, a then unknown B.B. King, asked him to help him put his first band together. Another friend and mentor, Rufus Thomas, asked Herman to join him for a session at Sun Records in 1953. From that session came the song “Bearcat”, the answer song to Big Mama Thornton’s “Hound Dog,” which many believe to be the very first Rock n’ Roll recording.\n\nDr. Green’s been around jazz and blues circles for decades, and earned his chops working with such legends as John Coltrane, Miles Davis and Dinah Washington, not to mention being a major part of Lionel Hampton’s big band for eight years.\n\nDr. Green has stepped forward into more unexplored areas of music than almost any other musician, helping to originate the experimental jazz movement founded in San Francisco known as West Coast Jazz.\n\nHere’s an excerpt from his upcoming book:\n\n“In 1955, when Herman was twenty-five years old, he was returning from overseas military duty and was on his way home to Memphis, TN. When his plane stopped in San Francisco for an unknown amount of layover time, he decided to visit a bar near the airport for a drink.\n\nA three-piece jazz combo began to play and Herman heard some of the same sounds that he had been playing in Memphis, but he also heard some new sounds, something that was not known in Memphis. He decided to stay in the Bay area for a while, and as he got to know some of the musicians that played in the local clubs, he discovered that they were just as fascinated by his stories of Beale Street as he was by their stories of playing with artists like Miles Davis and Dave Brubeck.\n\nIn a short time, Herman found himself in the house band of the “Blackhawk”, a famous San Francisco Jazz Club that many believe helped to found the sound that would later be known as West Coast Jazz. From 1955 to 1957, he played with artists such as Cannonball Adderly, Miles Davis, Dave Brubeck, the Modern Jazz Quartet and many others. He was there when the experiments with Jazz were first starting, and when Jazz become more than a few instruments improvising on “old standards”.\n\nIn 1958, Herman became the leader of the House Band at a new place called “Box City” in San Francisco. This was a late night club set up just for the musicians who played other places in town to go to and relax after they got off work. (Box City did not even open until 1:00am!) Herman had with him a young lady vocalist, a then unknown Dinah Washington. In Herman’s own words,\n\n“I worked Box City, Say When, and the Jazz Workshop. These had to be the most amazing clubs I have ever played in. They were where you went after a night on the town or after you had been working. Frank Sinatra dropped in and sat in with the Band whenever he was in town – and this was quite often. It’s also where I also got to know Sammy Davis, Jr. Many of what we would call the “Great Artists of Jazz” would show up and sit in with the Band – for no pay – just for the fun, the company, and the relaxation. At the Jazz Workshop, we opened the place with Cannonball Adderly and it only went uphill from there.”\n\nHerman met a lot of people in places like Box City and the Jazz Workshop in San Francisco, and this is where he was brought to the attention of Lionel Hampton, who was widely considered to be the “King of Jazz Music” at that time. Lionel offered Herman a job playing with his big band, and when Herman accepted he quickly found himself in New York, playing with a band that he would stay with, on and off, for eight years. One of the other band members, who would become one of Herman’s best friends, was John Coltrane. In Herman’s own words, “New York was a blur in my memory for three years. It all happened so fast, and it was such a great time. We were musicians doing what we wanted to do and getting paid good money for it. Also, we use to jam – just for the fun of it – in my apartment in New York. There would be Miles Davis, Clark Terry, John Coltrane, Art Davis; all just sitting around my apartment playing what we wanted, how we wanted to play it, and all because we were having a good time. I might add that everybody wanted to experiment and everybody wanted to try something new, but there was no one that had that innovation of music like ‘Trane. Even today when I do a sax break and I get way out into outer space, I still turn to the others in the band and say, ‘Hey, I’m doing my John Coltrane thing!'”\n\nLike all Memphis Musicians, Herman thought from time to time about returning home to Memphis, but the jobs were good and he was with Lionel Hampton, the most recognized name in Jazz Music. Herman said, “We were playing the Riviera in Las Vegas and Sammy Davis, Jr. was there. I was walking in the lobby with him and I said, ‘I’m worried. I invited my Mother out here to visit, and I don’t know what to show her or how to entertain her.’ Sammy said, “Why don’t you let me worry about that? When she gets here, just bring her down to my concert and we’ll think of something.” When Herman’s mother arrived he took her down to the show and right on the front row was a table reserved for Sammy Davis, Jr. and Herman Green. Herman’s Mother got to watch the show sitting with Sammy Davis, Jr. – except when it was Sammy’s turn to be on stage. And when Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin dropped by to sit at the table for a while, Herman’s mother never complained about not being “entertained”.\n\nA few weeks later, Herman and some of his fellow band members were having afternoon drinks in the lounge at the Riviera when a rumor began to circulate that President John F. Kennedy had been shot in Dallas, TX. All over America, things were never the same for most people, and musicians were no different. Herman thought long and hard about what he was doing, what he wanted to do, and where he had come from, and after taking care of all of his obligations to Lionel Hampton and the other musicians he had gotten to know, Herman was on his way back to Memphis.”\n\nOver the next several decades, Herman played and recorded with many of the greatest legends of the Memphis Music scene (such as Isaac Hayes among many others), and also began a second career as a music educator, teaching & mentoring many of the best and brightest Memphis musicians from the next generation of jazz greats (such as James Williams, Donald Brown and Mulgrew Miller) while serving as the Head of Jazz Studies at Lemoyne-Owen College in Memphis for many years.\n\nHe also found the time to form the “Herman Green & the Green Machine” jazz quintet, and compose and record his own solo CDs, such as “Who IS Herman Green?” and “Inspiration: Family and Friends”. He also founded the jazz/rock/jam/fusion group “FreeWorld” in 1987 – a local Memphis music institution which is still going strong today after 22 years and 5 CD releases.\n\nFeaturing 83-year-old jazz saxophone legend Dr. Herman Green (who has performed &/or recorded with the likes of Miles Davis, John Coltrane, B.B. King, Lionel Hampton, Clark Terry, Phineas & Calvin Newborn, Bob Weir, Rob Wasserman, Stephen Perkins, Norwood Fisher and a host of others during his 63 year professional music career), FreeWorld is literally ‘new school meets old school’, and has been variously described as “The best of Memphis, New Orleans, & San Francisco – all rolled into one fresh & excitingly unique musical experience!”\n\nSo the next time you’re walking down Beale Street, keep your eyes peeled for the brass musical note in front of Blues City Café, which honors 80-year-old Dr. Herman W. Green – the indefatigable Jazz saxophone legend – who cut his teeth on Beale Street in the ’40s, went on to conquer the Jazz world in the ’50s and ’60s, and then brought it all back home to Memphis where he continues to amaze and astonish music aficionados from all over the world on Beale Street each and every week, while actively passing on his deep musical knowledge & a lifetime of musical experience to the next generation of Memphis musicians.\n\nGeorge R. Lawrence\n\nDrums, Percussion\n\nHailing from Jackson Mississippi, George has lived and worked in the major music cities of Los Angeles, Nashville, and Muscle Shoals Alabama, recording and touring around the world with some of the best musicians and major recording artists. He is known for his “deep pocket groove” and his ability to inspire other musicians to play their best. During the nineties he built a reputation as one of the top sub drummers in the Nashville music scene and nation wide. Able to fill in with national recording artists on a moment’s notice with no rehearsal, George has been working constantly as a “ringer” or “pinch hitter”. He subbed a couple of gigs with POCO in 1999 which led to his becoming a member of that band from 2004 to 2015.\n\nA truly versatile jack of all trades and “master of some”, he has played funk, R&B, soul music, blues, country, classic rock, pop, big band jazz, be-bop jazz and jazz-rock fusion music. He has spent many years as a recording studio “session cat” and reads standard transcription and Nashville number charts flawlessly. He has played drum set in every imaginable setting including concert arenas, videos, TV, clubs, churches, symphony orchestras, and clinics.\n\nA professional sideman, George is available to work anywhere in the world for gigs large and small. “Sometimes people are hesitant to call me because they think I only play for Poco or that I might charge too much to play. I am a working drummer and never have too many opportunities. My only criteria for accepting jobs are great music and great people. The money is secondary. I play recording studios, coliseums AND honky tonks”. To contact George about playing a gig or tour or playing on your recordings, email him at george@notsomoderndrummer.com or call him at 330 338 6035.\n\nGeorge is very active in the drumming community both locally and nationally, attending drum festivals and conventions around the country as a performer and clinician. He produced the Nashville Drum Shows in 2009, 2012 and 2014. He is one of the administrators for the Nashville Drummers Facebook Group and has organized and hosted the monthly Nashville Drummer’s Lunch. He has taught hundreds and hundreds of students, many who have gone on to become professional drummers and some who have become famous drummers. Of special note is student Keith Carlock, also from their mutual hometown of Jackson Mississippi, who is now recognized as one of the top drummers in the world working with the likes of Steely Dan, Sting, John Mayer, James Taylor and Toto. Pro and aspiring pro drummers from around the country seek out George for the highest level of instruction.. George owned and operated George’s Drum Shop from 1985 through 2010. George now teaches at Memphis Drum Shop. In 2006 George and Joe Partridge started the Famous Drum Company which manufacturers pro level snare drums and drum sets. In 2008 George bought Not So Modern Drummer magazine from Bill Ludwig III and works as editor, publisher and photographer. IN 2018 he started DrumSellers.com which is an online peer to peer sales site for drummers (think Ebay for drums).\n\nGeorge’s work resume\n\nQ. Who are you and what have you done that is so dang wonderful?\n\nA. “Nothing all that important really. I consider myself just a journeyman working drummer who graduated from the school of hard knocks. I went to SMU, U. of North Texas and a bunch of junior colleges, but my real schooling was the gigs. I spent thousands of week long gigs in night clubs during the seventies and eighties learning how to function in a rhythm section and create drum parts for bands’ and writers’ songs. Fortunately I found my niche with some people who like my “Big Mississippi Beat” groove and the funny little fast notes I paint the holes with. I’ve recorded thousands of publishing and songwriter demos, hundreds of custom label and independent albums, lots of major label albums, and dozens of great band album projects that never saw the light of day.
