        "text": "Two St. Clair County Community College instructors were recently selected to receive the newly-launched 2019 President’s Faculty Excellence Awards, recognizing their dedicated contributions to student success at the college. Student nominations were used to determine the recipients.\n\nProfessor of Biology Carrie Dollar received the Full-Time Faculty Award, and Adjunct Mathematics Instructor Angela Heiden, the Adjunct Faculty Award.\n\nBoth faculty members were honored for their excellence in the classroom, ability to inspire students, and service to the college and community.\n\n“These faculty members bring extraordinary dedication and innovation into their classrooms every day, making a positive impact on students that exemplifies the unique value of an SC4 education,” said President Dr. Deborah A. Snyder. “We are grateful for all they do on behalf of the college and our students.”\n\nThe St. Clair County Community College radiologic technology program has continued for a sixth year its impressive 100 percent first-time passage rate on the American Registry of Radiologic Technologists (ARRT Exam), a national registry exam that grants certification in radiologic technology.\n\nEleven SC4 graduates passed the 2019 exam, bringing the total number of SC4 graduates passing on their first try to 61 since the program began at the college in 2012.\n\nAccording to SC4 Dean of Health Sciences Jenny Giles-Voss, the excellent training and preparation provided to students is thanks to the expertise and dedication of Professor of Radiologic Technology Sandra Geliske and Program Director Monica Rowling.\n\n“A perfect record like this is incredibly rare,” Giles-Voss said. “It illustrates the high level of commitment we have to our students in ensuring they are ready to thrive in this career path upon graduation.\n\n“Specifically, Monica has had a remarkable record of preparing skilled radiographers in our region. We are fortunate to have her and our amazing team of faculty experts teaching future generations of health care professionals.”\n\nPrior to launching the program at SC4, Rowling worked as the hospital-based radiography program director at Port Huron Hospital, now McLaren Port Huron, for 24 years where all her students there also passed the exam on their first attempt.\n\n“I continue to be impressed by the commitment and perseverance of our Blue Water Area students,” Rowling said. “They make me so proud every year and make a positive difference in the lives of patients here in Port Huron and far beyond.”\n\nSC4 radiologic technology graduates work at Beaumont hospitals, Children’s Hospital of Michigan, DMC Detroit Receiving Hospital, McKenzie Health System, McLaren Port Huron, Lake Huron Medical Center, Concentra clinics, Henry Ford Macomb Health Center, Orthopedic Associates, Advanced Orthopedics and Ascension Crittenton Hospital, among others.\n\nSC4’s radiologic technology associate degree program – which received an impressive maximum eight-year accreditation award from the Joint Review Committee on Education in Radiologic Technology (JRCERT) in 2016 – prepares students to become radiologic technologists by combining imaging technology with patient care skills to create quality radiography images. The program has a 24-month, competency-based curriculum that includes practical experiences in hospitals and imaging centers.\n\nThere are 22 other radiologic technology programs in Michigan, including 16 associate degree programs, two bachelor’s degree programs and four hospital-based programs.\n\nThe mayors of St. Clair County’s largest city and one of its smallest towns both say St. Clair County Community College was there when they needed it.\n\nPauline Repp of Port Huron and Bill Cedar of St. Clair are both the longest-serving mayors in their respective towns.\n\nRepp, 68, is serving her 10th year as mayor of Port Huron. She retired in 1989 after 20 years as the city clerk.\n\nBorn in England, Repp grew up in Canada and St. Clair and became a U.S. citizen in 1987. Repp began working in advertising at The Times Herald but left to take care of her young family. She then began working at the City of Port Huron as executive secretary to the city manager before being promoted to city clerk.\n\nRepp said she couldn’t finish her classes at SC4 at the time but was fortunate enough to be able to return years later to take the remaining classes she needed.\n\n“I started attending SC4 in the late 1960s while working but did not complete (my degree) at that time,” she said. “In the late 1980s, I re-enrolled and completed my associate degree in business administration.”\n\nShe said being able to obtain a quality education close to home is a blessing.\n\n“When I decided to complete my associate degree, I had just been appointed as city clerk, and I felt that this additional education would be an enhancement to my career,” Repp continued.\n\n“Attending classes at a local institution while working and being, at the time, a single mother was a necessary advantage,” she said. “The fact that you can get a quality education locally is the ideal opportunity, and I feel that I have definitely utilized what I learned in the SC4 environment.”\n\nBill Cedar, 62, has been mayor of St. Clair for the past 19 years after previously serving as a council member for eight years. He taught government, U.S. history, world history and physical education at East China Community Schools for 30 years.\n\nHe received an associate degree from SC4 and went on to earn a bachelor’s from Central Michigan University and master’s from Wayne State University.\n\nCedar said he was able to get a good start on his education at SC4.\n\n“I was able to avoid student loans and do part-time work close to home,” he said. “I feel the smaller class sizes allowed me to get to know my professors better.”\n\nCedar added the college’s professors were both encouraging and compassionate.\n\n“The thing about SC4 that I think helped me was the professors who took a genuine interest in my education,” Cedar added. “They treated me with kindness and care.”\n\nThroughout the summer months, St. Clair County Community College will hold free information sessions on main campus for a number of its in-demand health sciences programs.\n\nAttending an info session is the first step for anyone interested in earning a health sciences degree from SC4.
