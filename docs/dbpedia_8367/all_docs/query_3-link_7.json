        "text": "We’re only into the second TOTP show of 1988 and already we are seeing the same songs being repeated from just the other week. Of the nine acts on tonight’s broadcast, we have already seen six of them before. What a swizz as Smash Hits magazine might have said! Anyway, let’s make the best of it. Tonight’s presenters are Simon Mayo and …hell’s teeth! check out Gary Davies’s jumper! Even in the 80s that must have been considered loud! It’s fucking atrocious! Let’s hope for better from the musical turns…\n\nClimie Fisher are first up tonight and they’re doing the hip-hop remix version of their hit “Rise To The Occasion” again. I guess it’s more aligned with the party atmosphere of the TOTP studio than the ballad version. Or maybe they just wanted to get in first with the “I know you gonna dig this” line before their adversary in this particular peculiar competition Krush are on later. Simon Climie doesn’t look any more comfortable out there at the front than he did the other week and struggles to get his jerky and awkward dance moves in time with his backing singers. He does however have magnificently towering 80s hair. I may have been going for that look myself at this time.\n\nThe instrumental interlude in the middle of the song enables a truly cringeworthy interaction between Climie and Rob Fisher (on keyboards) where they act out the spoken word samples…\n\nSC: Come on Buddy get with the beat\n\nRF: I don’t know what you mean\n\nSC: Get with the beat\n\nRF: I’m a little rusty on it. Don’t touch that *brushes SC off his keyboard*\n\nDear oh dear….what were they thinking?!\n\nListening back to it now, Simon Climie’s voice is really quite unusual. Sort of strained and raspy but it kind of worked anyway. “Rise To The Occasion” would rise no further than this week’s peak of No 10.\n\nOh blimey! This may well have been the UK’s first ever glimpse of Tiffany. The 16 year old singing sensation from out of Norwalk, California was briefly a megastar with a No 1 record in both the US and the UK. Firstly though, a point of order. It was not a shopping centre tour Simon Mayo, it was a shopping mall tour. OK – he was probably just anglicising it for the UK audience but even so. Anyway, back to Tiffany Renee Darwish to quote her full name for her take on all this in a recent Classic Pop magazine interview:\n\n“The first couple of weekends weren’t successful at all,” she remembers. “We had like two people show up. We had people yelling at me because I was too loud, and business owners were not too happy with me being outside their stores. But as radio stations started to play the single and say that I was appearing at the local mall, it started to catch fire. We went from people sitting in the chairs just because they were there, to the point where you couldn’t move. It was overwhelming”.\n\nInterestingly some 30 years later and the idea of musical acts playing in shopping centres (OK Mayo you win) finally took fire in this country with the likes of The Pigeon Detectives and Black Grape playing in North Point Shopping Centre in Bransholme, Hull in the last couple of years.\n\nBack to 1988 though and I had no idea that “I Think We’re Alone Now” was a cover version – the original being done by Tommy James and the Shondells in 1967 – but it was difficult to ignore the catchiness of Tiffany’s version. It was perfect Radio 1 playlist fodder and it was at No 1 within two weeks of its No 13 entry here. We’ll be seeing more of her in these repeats I’m sure.\n\nNot to be outdone in the “I know you gonna dig this” stakes, here come Krush with “House Arrest”. For some reason, the studio audience behind them have been kitted out with flashlights. Was this a house music thing? Never having been to a rave, my knowledge is limited. I know about the fluorescent glowsticks thing but were there flashlights being waved about as well?\n\nKrush didn’t release a follow up single immediately (one eventually appeared in 1992) while vocalist Ruth Joy committed to an ultimately unsuccessful solo career. Her 1992 long player “Pride And Joy” was critically well received but bombed commercially. Never mind. She can sleep at night safe in the knowledge that “House Arrest’ was considered a bangin’ tune in the nightclubs of Sunderland when I was a student there back in the day. Not that I danced to it. Obviously.\n\nAnother song we’ve seen before (I think it’s even just the same performance clip recycled). Ever wondered who the majors of Morris Minor And The Majors were? No I haven’t either but I’ve got to fill this bit of the post up with something and I used all my other ‘Morris Minor’ material up the last time they were on so….they were Rusty Wing and Phil Errup (as in ‘Fill ‘Er Up’). OK – not really that funny or interesting…\n\n…how about this then…ever wondered what the B-side to “Stutter Rap” was? Well it was this…\n\n…jeez..this is setting some new kind of low even for this blog (and I’ve posted some right shite on here). Enough!\n\nHere’s the Breakers to provide some relief. Woah, woah woah woah! Did Simon Mayo just describe these as ‘happening records’?! Hang your head in shame sir!\n\nNow I would have said that “Ideal World” by The Christians was a hit around Christmas ’87 rather than early in ’88 but seems I was wrong. My housemate Roy really liked this one and I distinctly recall jibing him about this being their Xmas single with it being a more gentle ballad than their previous output – maybe that’s the cause of my memory defect. Roy was right about the song though – easily their best in my opinion. As was the case with their earlier hits, “Ideal World” carried social commentary within its lyrics, this time about apartheid in South Africa and the divisions caused by the Berlin Wall. Listening back to it today depressingly it sounds just as relevant to the world’s problems as it did 31 years ago. I thought much the same when I saw the song’s writer Henry Priestman perform it live at the Beverly Folk festival in 2010.\n\n“Ideal World” would make No 14 on the UK Top 40 and was the most successful of the five singles taken from their self titled debut album.\n\nOh bollocks! In the year of the house music explosion and the dawning of rave culture, this sort of shit was still in the charts?! Sorry but I just didn’t/don’t get AC/DC. At the risk of sounding like my Dad when pronouncing judgement on the musical choices of my youth, it all sounds the same to me. “Heatseeker” was jet another of their interminable songs that follows exactly the same formula as all the rest. Look, I know this is heresy of the highest order to rock fans but it just bores me senseless.\n\n“Heatseeker” was the band’s biggest UK hit of the decade peaking at No 12.\n\nRight, that’s all the new songs dealt with but into the Top 10 crashes Terence Trent D’Arby with “Sign Your Name”. This week he’s in the studio and he’s still got his all male backing singers with him. This still looks ever so slightly incongruous to me not least because of the height difference between them. Despite a double bass, bongos and a xylophone player up there on stage with him, it all seems a little bit lacklustre to me . Maybe he would have been better off just sending the overly sensual video in again instead.\n\nThis week’s Top 10…\n\n10. Climie Fisher- “Rise To The Occasion”\n\n9. Joyce Sims – “Come into My Life”\n\n8. Terence Trent D’Arby – “Sign Your Name”\n\n7. The Stranglers – “All Day And All Of The Night”\n\n6. Wet Wet Wet – “Angel Eyes”\n\n5. Cher – “I Found Someone”\n\n4. Morris Minor and the Majors – “Stutter Rap”\n\n3. Krush – “House Arrest”\n\n2. Pet Shop Boys – “Always On My Mind”\n\n1. Belinda Carlisle – “Heaven Is A Place On Earth”: She’s made it! Ex Go-Go Belinda has usurped all other pretenders to the No 1 crown in the post Xmas lull and knocked Pet Shop Boys off their perch. I’m not sure why now but it seemed quite significant to me at the time that a soft rock number (albeit a catchy one) would be the country’s best selling single. Perhaps the most significant factor in this was that Belinda was a woman. Yes we’d had recent No 1s by solo female artists by the likes of Madonna and Whitney Houston but singing soft rock? Maybe I’d always associated this genre of music with US male musos with poodle rock hair hence my perception that this was something different. Of course this was the unenlightened 80s so there was lots of discussion around Belinda’s looks being the main driving force behind her success but the song has stood the test of time and is still played regularly on today’s airwaves.\n\nThe play out video is “Father Figure” by George Michael which we saw as a breaker in last weeks show. Now I’ve never given this song that much thought. Yep it’s “Father Figure” by George Michael from his “Faith” album was as far as my dissection of it went but if you look it up online…holy shit there’s a whole lot of traffic about this track most of it around the line ‘put your tiny hand in mine’. I’m not going to go any further own that line of enquiry but suffice to say I choose not to believe any of those conspiracy theories.\n\nOrder of appearance Artist Song Did I Buy it?\n\n1\n\nClimie Fisher Rise To The Occasion The hip hop remix was on my cassette single of their next release\n\n2\n\nTiffany I Think We’re Alone Now Not alone enough to be potentially caught paying for this record though – no\n\n3\n\nKrush House Arrest No – bloody new fangled music!\n\n4\n\nMorris Minor And The Majors Stutter Rap Nah\n\n5\n\nThe Christians Ideal World No but I have the album\n\n6\n\nAC/DC Heatseeker A big fat NO!\n\n7\n\nTerence Trent D’Arby Sign Your Name Nope\n\n8\n\nBelinda Carlisle Heaven Is A Place On Earth No but its on my iTunes\n\n9\n\nGeorge Michael Father Figure No but my sister had the album and played it constantly in the Summer of 1988\n\nDisclaimer\n\nOK – here’s the thing – the TOTP episodes are only available on iPlayer for a limited amount of time so the link to the programme below only works for about another month so you’ll have to work fast if you want to catch the whole show as I can’t find the full programme on YouTube.\n\nhttps://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/m00062g5/top-of-the-pops-14011988\n\nI make no claim to the rights of this show and all ownership and contents including logos and graphics belongs totally to the BBC or copyright holder(s).\n\nAll opinions on the music and artists featured are my own. Sorry if you don’t agree.\n\nSome bed time reading?\n\nhttp://likepunkneverhappened.blogspot.com/2018/01/january-13-26-1988.html\n\nIt’s very early January in 1988. Xmas has come and gone and despite there being two overtly Xmas themed songs in the Top 10, UK pop fans are eagerly awaiting the next big thing to hit them right between the eyes. Well, of the nine songs on the show tonight, eight are making their debut so spirits are high. Let’ see what wonders await us…\n\nOh Christ! A new year doesn’t necessarily mean a changing of the guard as tonight’s presenters are Mike Read and Simon Bates who couldn’t be more establishment if they tried. There’s a suitably safe song to start them off as Sinitta bursts onto our screens with her latest SAW penned effort “GTO”. OK – let’s get this straight from the start (as Kevin Rowland once sang) – this is absolute, never to be disputed, 100% shite. As blatant a formula led follow up single as you’re ever likely to hear – it’s basically previous hit “Toy Boy” but instead of focussing on age, the theme to this one is cars – or more specifically a Ferrari 250 GTO. Does Sinitta’s fella love his car or his girl more? God almighty! That we have come to this so early in the year. It didn’t bode well.\n\nThis No 15 hit would prove to be one of the lesser PWL efforts in a year when they would dominate the Top 40 more tightly than Juventus and their grip on the Serie A title. Fair play to Sinitta who has just recycled her “Toy Boy” look into something eminently workable for a post Xmas crowd looking to buy anything that is not festively inclined. She would return to the Top 10 twice before the decade was out but for now, she’s just ticking over.\n\nJohn ‘Jellybean’ Benitez was on a hot streak around this time. Not only did he have a hit at No 16 with Elisa Fiorillo in “Who Found Who” but he was right up his own arse with a follow up hit already with “Jingo” at No 17. My abiding memory of this record is that I knew a guy called Jon who was a housemate of someone on my course. John was quite the alpha male but he was ever so slightly belittled by the rest of his housemates who used to sing “Jongo” at him to the tune of “Jingo”. Look, I never said it was a good story just my memory of the song! That’s pretty much all I’ve got on this one other than it peaked at No 12.\n\nAs Mike Read notes in his intro, it had been seven years since the next band’s first appearance on the show and by 1988 Depeche Mode were well into their journey from fluffy little pop puppets to serious purveyors of doom laden synth rock. “Behind The Wheel” was the third single from their “Music For The Masses” album and yes, it was another very heavy release. I’d pretty much lost interest in them by this point I must admit. That sound they were exploring didn’t do a lot for me. Was I missing something? Let me listen again….\n\n…no – it still just leaves me cold. Sorry. Interesting to note in this performance though that Martin Gore is welding a guitar. Was this a thing by this point in their career?\n\n“Behind The Wheel” made No 21 in the UK charts which must have been starting to feel a pretty familiar tale for the band. In the nine releases since their last Top 10 hit (“Master And Servant”) in 1984, the peak positions achieved were:\n\n16-18-18-15-28-17-16-22-21\n\nThis suggests that they had a very loyal fan base but were starting to lose the casual follower (like me). Still, they were probably unconcerned. Six months on from this they would play to 60,000 people at the Pasadena Rose Bowl.\n\nAs with the Depeche boys, next act The Stranglers hadn’t been anywhere near the Top 10 for nigh on five whole years when “European Female” made No 9 back in 1983. A procession of single releases after that were either minor hits or missed the charts altogether so they were in need of a big hit as they entered their 15th year in existence. So what to do? Yes of course, you release a cover version. I have lost count of the amount of times that old record company trick has been pulled during the course of the past 189 posts in this blog but here it is once more. The cover version chosen to deliver the goods this time was “All Day And All Of The Night” by The Kinks. Ironic really as you could make a case that The Kinks essentially covered themselves for this one. “All Day And All Of The Night” is basically “You Really Got Me” isn’t it?\n\nAnyway, the record company (CBS in this case) knew their stuff as The Stranglers took their version all the way to No 7. It was to be their last ever Top 10 appearance. If I’d been pressed, I would have said that this had been a hit a couple of year later but I think I’m getting confused with “96 Tears” which they also covered and it was indeed a hit in 1990.\n\nHere come the Breakers…and first up is some prime “Faith” era George Michael. Despite having already released two singles from the album (three in the US), George (or maybe record label Columbia) was nowhere near done as “Father Figure” would be followed by another two singles all pulled from “Faith”. This track was a much fuller and rich sound than the stripped back rockabilly stylings of the album’s title track and always sounded to me like a logical extension to “A Different Corner”. The fact that he chose not to follow what would have been a safe route but instead unleashed “I Want Your Sex’ on his fan base was quite a risk looking back.\n\nFor the record, I didn’t mind it. “Father Figure” peaked at No 11 thereby becoming the first record George Michael was involved in to not make the UK Top 10.\n\nBy 1988 it had been over three years since Band Aid and we had all grown very accustomed to charity songs being in the charts. In fact, barely a month went by without another one being released. From USA For Africa to Ferry Aid via Comic Relief, Sport Aid and Artists Against Apartheid – the charity single was no longer a one-off. Indeed, before the decade was out we would have another three charity singles that made it all the way to No 1. 1988’s first addition to this particular genre though was from G.O.S.H. and “The Wishing Well” which was raising money for the redevelopment of the Great Ormond Street Hospital via its (GOSH) Wishing Well appeal. A noble endeavour and worthy cause that nobody could disagree with. The song however was horrible! As with the previous year’s Ferry Aid record, Boy George was once again one of the lead vocalists but many of the other participants were definitely second rate. Dollar?! Seriously?! What?! It gets worse?! Oh yes….how about Andy Crane (he has no brain) or Roland Rat?! Bonnie Langford?! I shit you not!\n\n“The Wishing Well” reached No 22 in the UK singles chart.\n\nYou know those songs that you used to like but have heard so many times down the years that they are now completely unlistenable? This is one of mine. “Sign Your Name” was the fourth single from Terence Trent D’Arby and at the time I thought it was easily his best. Smooth and classy, it was as if it was a calling card for his sound and style and a marker for a guy who people assumed was going to be a major part of the musical landscape for quite some time to come. How wrong we all were. For now though, Terence was certainly a figure of desire for many a young woman. I knew a guy called Dipesh whose girlfriend would come over all unnecessary at the very first few bars of “Sign Your Name”.\n\nOver the years though I have heard this song so many times that I cringe every time it comes on the Absolute 80s playlist which is almost a daily occurrence (or at least it feels like it). As such, the revelation to me that there was a cover version of “Sign Your Name” by Sheryl Crow comes as some much needed relief. Right see you in about four minutes….\n\n…hmm. Well, it’s not bad – a much more funky take on it with a snake like back beat giving it some extra edge. Yeah. Pretty good.\n\nThe Terence Trent D’Arby original was a No 2 hit in the UK and a No 4 in the US.\n\nTop 10\n\n10. Mel & Kim – “Rocking Around The Christmas Tree”\n\n9. Cher – “I Found Someone”\n\n8. Morris Minor and the Majors – “Stutter Rap”\n\n7. Krush – “House Arrest”\n\n6. Alison Moyet – “Love Letters”\n\n5. Wet Wet Wet – “Angel Eyes”\n\n4. The Pogues and Kirsty MacColl – “Fairytale Of New York”\n\n3. Michael Jackson – “The Way You Make Me Feel”\n\n2. Belinda Carlisle – Heaven Is A Place On Earth”\n\n1. Pet Shop Boys – “Always On My Mind”: The Xmas No 1 is still there on the top of the heap but won’t be for much longer.\n\nThe song was recycled for inclusion on their third album “Introspective” which was released in October of 1988. It was remixed with a dance track and came out of the machine as “Always On My Mind / In My House” which never really did anything for me but if it did for you or you don’t know and it and are intrigued by the thought of such a thing, fill your boots…\n\nSome R&B to close the show from Joyce Sims. Having already had a hit on our shores with “All And All” in 1986, she was back with new track “Come Into My Life”. I hated both of them. Sorry Joyce.\n\nOrder of appearance Artist Song Did I Buy it?\n\n1\n\nSinitta GTO Big, red pile of shit more like.

A lot has happened in those four weeks. For a start, I’m back at Sunderland Poly for my second year of being a full time student having finished my Summer job at the porcelain factory. I even managed to sneak in my first ever holiday with my wife (girlfriend back then) as we decided to go on a boating holiday to the Norfolk Broads. We had a small portable TV on the boat and I distinctly remember watching the following one lunchtime….\n\nYep, the UK’s introduction to Charlene on Aussie soap Neighbours. And that’s how we all referred to her back then…’Charlene from Neighbours’. I’m pretty sure the name Kylie Minogue didn’t mean much to anyone at this point. Little did we know what an impact she would have on the UK charts just six months on from this entrance and that some 32 years, 14 albums and 74 singles later, she would be so globally famous that people would know her just by her first name.\n\nBut I’m getting ahead of myself. Back to October ’87 and we have eleven songs that we haven’t seen on these repeats before. What we have seen before though is Gary Davies’s questionable 80s fashion choices and he’s at it again tonight with a horrible shirt that resembles pyjamas.\n\nFirst act tonight are UB40 with a song that I kind of remember but I couldn’t have told you which year it was a hit in. It turns out, and I didn’t know this until researching this post, that “Maybe Tomorrow” is a actually a 1971 Jackson 5 song. I had no idea. Now I know UB40 turned many a cover version into a massive hit but this choice does seem quite an unlikely one. It was the only previously unreleased material on their very first Best Of album the snappily titled “The Best of UB40 – Volume One” which pulled together all their biggest hits from 1980 – 87. Although not absolutely definitive, it had all the tunes you would expect on it and went six times platinum in the UK (I’ve even got a copy). “Maybe Tomorrow” is one I could have done without though. I mean, it’s not a terrible record but for me it doesn’t work as well as some of their other covers like “Many Rivers To Cross” or even the much maligned “Can’t Help Falling In Love With You”. Nice to see a bit of banjo action on TOTP though.\n\nOf course this performance was in the days before the big family rift which resulted in essentially there being two different versions of the band currently – the remaining members of the original line up (UB40) and UB40 featuring Ali Campbell and Astro. It’s sad to think that Ali and his brother Robin no longer speak to each other let alone share the same stage as they do here. I recall Smash Hits doing a pop stars lookalikes feature one issue when they decided that Robin was a dead ringer for footballer Bryan Robson. He looks more like Jools Holland here to me.\n\nOh my God! Even at this point, Five Star are still having hits! “Strong As Steel” was penned for the band by legendary soft rock ballad songwriter Diane Warren and you can tell. Whereas their only previous attempt at a ballad “Rain Or Shine” was all tweeness and whimsical lyrics, “Strong As Steel” was much more… well….American sounding. After the very English references in “Rain Or Shine” (Robin Hood and Major Tom), this latest effort sounded like it was specifically aimed at breaking the US market. I mean it’s a decent attempt at that type of genre but nothing was going to halt their slide into commercial oblivion. Their discography shows they only have three Top 40 singles left in them (and only one of them makes the Top 20). The writing was on the wall….in 10 foot tall letters.\n\nA welcome return for a band we haven’t seen for a while next. It’s been 18 months as Gary Davies tell us since they were last on the show. After their first hit “68 Guns” way back in 1983, The Alarm had released a string of singles that had not matched the peak of that first hit. Indeed, they had not been back to the Top 20 since. “Rain In The Summertime” would change all that. The lead single from their third album “Eye Of The Hurricane” was a No 18 hit. It always sounded to me like the band had taken a far more pop -orientated direction than ever before which wasn’t necessarily a bad thing. The production is very glossy and there was a definite opinion at the time that the band were trying to jump on the U2 bandwagon – having already copied The Clash said some cynics! Not me though. It’s a strong single in my opinion and it glides along slickly with a rousing chorus. I liked the other singles taken from the album as well, neither of which made the Top 40 – “Rescue Me” (No 48) and “Presence Of Love” (No 44).\n\nThe band’s hair had toned down a bit over the years with the towering peaks replaced with a more softened look. Guitarist Dave Sharp looks like a Nicky Wire prototype with his ruffled shirt in this performance…and that’s pretty cool in my book.\n\nThe band would return to the Top 40 just once more in the very last year of the decade with “A New South Wales” before lead singer Mike Peters dramatically left the band in 1991 without warning making the announcement live on stage at a Brixton Academy gig. A brief reunion for the VH1 show Bands Reunited took place in 2005 with all four original band members taking part but Peters now leads The Alarm as the only founding member. He was awarded an MBE this year for his services to cancer care.\n\nThere’s a man with a mohican haircut on TOTP! In 1987! Check him out behind Peter Powell as he introduces the next act. Blimey! A third hit on the trot for Terence Trent D’Arby is what’s up next. “Dance Little Sister” was the least successful of the four singles that were released from his debut album peaking at No 20 and I was never much of a fan of it at the time but listening back to it now it sounds just as strong as any of those other hits. The “Get up ‘outta’ your rockin’ chair, grandma! Or rather would you care to dance, grandmother?” spoken intro was an intriguing invitation to tempt the listener in and then Terence is off into a tight funky number. It strikes me now that he’s channelling his inner James Brown with this one, both in the sound of it and his dance moves especially where he does the splits. Indeed, in a Smash Hits article at this time, Terence goes on a shopping spree to a Virgin megastore where he buys a whole stack of CDs including the Godfather of Soul. The all male backing singers make a striking contrast to the usual female version and the whole thing hangs together pretty well I think.\n\nWhat?! The Breakers are back?! Why were they missing for the last two repeats then? Weird. They’ve really shoe horned them in as well. Four songs in 1 min and 30 seconds! Los Lobos are the first of them with their interpretation of the Richie Valens song “Come On Let’s Go”. As with their recent No 1 “La Bamba”, it was taken from the soundtrack of the film of the same name and I actually preferred this one to its predecessor which lost its appeal very quickly for me. “Come On Let’s Go” was much more in the Eddie Cochran vein and maybe that’s why I liked it more as my Dad had a Eddie Cochran greatest hits LP which I heard many a time growing up.\n\nApparently there’s a version by The Ramones with The Paley Brothers which I have never heard. Wait there for 2.06…\n\n….yep that was worth 2 minutes and six seconds of my time. Very good. The Los Lobos version peaked at No 18 in the UK Top 40.\n\nHere come Bananarama with arguably one of their most well known songs in “Love In The First Degree”. Carrying on where ” I Heard A Rumour” left off, this Stock, Aitken and Waterman production is utterly and unashamedly pure pop. Upbeat doesn’t really do it justice. Supposedly the idea for the song’s title came from Siobhan Fahey who insisted that whatever the hit-making trio came up with, it had to have that title. Even with that concession met, “Love In The First Degree” was one of the songs that convinced Fahey that this all out commercial direction was not where she wanted to go and hastened her departure from the group.\n\nSongfacts.com tells me that Sara Dallin sang lead and played bass guitar on the track. Really?! Did any of their songs feature a lead vocal? Surely they were just a blend of all three voices?\n\n“Love In The First Degree” was a No 3 hit thereby becoming the group’s joint biggest single ever alongside “Robert De Niro’s Waiting” and their version of “Help” with Lananeeneenoonoo for Comic Relief.\n\nContinuing their bizarre run of hit – miss – hit run of singles pulled from the “Tango In The Night” album are Fleetwood Mac with “Little Lies”. Now I don’t often blow my own trumpet but when I first heard this song when Steve (the guy across the corridor from me in halls) played his “Tango In The Night” cassette a little bit too loudly one day, I thought “That’s a hit”. This was well before it was released as a single and so I was waiting all year for it to come out. Sure enough, when it did it went Top 5. Not that I think I was destined to be an A&R man with amazing musical foresight. Anybody that heard it for the first time would surely have come to the same conclusion. It was so catchy and radio -friendly. And that bizarre run of singles chart placings? It went:\n\n9 – 56 – 5 – 54 – 4 – 60\n\nExplain that!\n\nThe improbably named Was (Not Was) with “Walk The Dinosaur” are the final Breaker. All I knew of David and Don Was (not actually siblings) at this point was “Out Come The Freaks” from 1983 and the Wham! version of their song “Where Did Your Heart Go” on their final single the “Edge Of Heaven ” E.P. “Walk The Dinosaur” would end up being one of only two Top 10 hits in the UK for them. The “Boom, boom, acka lacka boom boom” chant was insanely catchy and the whole thing had a kind of “Walk Like An Egyptian” feel to it (check out the cavewomen moves in the video) which had obviously worked well for The Bangles. And what did “Walk The Dinosaur” mean? One poster on songmeanings.com was pretty sure it meant choking the chicken…ahem.\n\nWell this was a rum do and no mistake. Anyone remember the “I Found Lovin” chart battle? I’m struggling to remember how the song went let alone any controversy about it. The version on tonight’s show is by US funksters The Fatback Band who’d had some minor hits back in the 70s before releasing “I Found Lovin” initially in 1984 when it bombed. It was re-issued in 1986 and still failed to make the Top 40. The song was seemingly dead in the water until a guy called Steve Walsh got involved. Walsh was a Radio London soul DJ and he’d asked to remix The Fatback Band’s version of the song with some of his own rapping added over the top. Their record label MD washed his hands of the whole thing and so Walsh put out his own version which went into the charts. Suddenly, presumably because of the renewed interest in the song, the Fatback original was re-released and that’s when it all got really heated and silly.\n\nApparently an invitation to The Fatback Band to appear on TOTP was withdrawn at the last minute and they were replaced by…yep, Steve Walsh amid accusations that he’d contacted Equity and demanded that he should take precedent over his US rivals as a British act on a British TV show. Walsh denied it saying someone “went on his behalf” to Equity. Are you keeping up? It was probably all baloney anyway as both acts benefitted from the press coverage with both of their respective versions making the Top 10 (Walsh at No 9 and The Fatback Band at No 7).\n\nWhat did I think? I don’t really remember all the fuss about the chart battle. It was hardly Oasis Vs Blur was it? And I hated both versions of the song to boot anyway. It was all put into harsh perspective when Steve Walsh died less than a year later from heart failure after surgery following a car crash in Ibiza.\n\nOne of the more unusual Top 10s of the year with one act saying they need love sandwiched by two acts saying that they had already found lovin’…\n\n10. Rick Astley – “Never Gonna Give You Up”\n\n9. Steve Walsh – “I Found Lovin”\n\n8. LL Cool J – “I Need Love”\n\n7. The Fatback Band – “I Found Lovin”\n\n6. Michael Jackson – “Bad”\n\n5. Kiss – “Crazy Crazy Nights”\n\n4. Jan Hammer – “Crockett’s Theme”\n\n3. M/A/R/R/S – “Pump Up The Volume”\n\n2. Abigail Mead and Nigel Goulding – “Full Metal Jacket”\n\n1. Bee Gees – “You Win Again”: One of the most unlikely comebacks of the decade next. The Bee Gees hadn’t been anywhere near the charts for the whole of the 80s. They were yesterday’s news, a disco anachronism. They were done. “You Win Again” came from nowhere and delivered them right back to the top of the summit. As well as being No 1 in the UK, it went to the top of the charts in five other countries and was the biggest selling single in the whole of Europe for 1987. How did they do it? I really don’t know. The stars must have aligned or something. It didn’t seem to fit into the charts at all to me but as with so many of the No 1 singles of the 80, it always seemed destined to be top of the heap because the media told us it would be. It puts me in mind of “Baby Jane” by Rod Stewart. Not the sound of it but that inevitability that it would be No 1 because of Rod’s past glories and the media push. It felt the same with The Bee Gees.\n\nThe follow up single “E.S.P.” was one of the least commercially successful follow ups to a No 1 song in the whole of the decade when it peaked at No 51. I guess they lost again.\n\nBefore the play out video, we get an awkward plug for a new radio show co-hosted by Liz Kershaw who looks sooo 80s and Ro Newton who looks like she must have been the cool one of the duo. One of the forthcoming highlights of this new series was an interview with Sam Fox’s sister. Wow! I’m glad I never caught it but if that did prick your ears then the final show can be found on Mixcloud below. I wont be listening.\n\nSaid play out video is Billy Idol with “Mony Mony (Live)”. After the revitalisation of his career with hits like “Rebel Yell”, “White Wedding” and a reasonably well received recent album in “Whiplash Smile”, his record label Chrysalis realised that there was money to be made from their boy Billy and started to ransack his back catalogue. The result of this was the “Vital Idol” project which was a compilation comprising remixed songs from his first two albums. A live version of “Mony Mony” was picked to spearhead the campaign and it did a pretty good job. Originally a hit in the 60s for Tommy James and the Shondells, Billy’s version was a No 1 hit in the US and a Top Tenner over here. Bizarrely, “Mony Mony” replaced another Tommy James and the Shondells cover at the top of the US charts when it toppled Tiffany’s version of “I Think We’re Alone Now”.\n\nThe video is a obviously just a live run through of the song with Billy in full on sneering mode and testifying on stage (as Smash Hits would have described it). Nothing much to see here although the mulitple close ups of his face reveal that he did have very nice teeth you’d have to say\n\nDisclaimer\n\nOK – here’s the thing – the TOTP episodes are only available on iPlayer for a limited amount of time so the link to the programme below only works for about another month so you’ll have to work fast if you want to catch the whole show as I can’t find the full programme on YouTube.\n\nhttps://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/m0004nrq/top-of-the-pops-15101987\n\nI make no claim to the rights of this show and all ownership and contents including logos and graphics belongs totally to the BBC or copyright holder(s).\n\nAll opinions on the music and artists featured are my own. Sorry if you don’t agree.\n\nSome bed time reading?\n\nhttp://likepunkneverhappened.blogspot.com/2017/10/october-7-20-1987.html\n\nWant a break from Brexit? I have the perfect distraction. Join me here at TOTP Rewind for a trip back in time to July 1987 when nobody had heard of Jacob Rees-Mogg, Theresa May wasn’t even an MP and Dominic Raab had yet to start shaving.\n\nAnd if you thought you had witnessed the ultimate depths of madness with Brexit, think again. What the actual fuck is this all about?! Shakin’ Stevens with some half naked, oiled up male dancers?! This redefines lunacy. Yes, 50s throwback Shaky decided that to still be relevant in 1987 he should take to the stage with four guys who look like they had clearly failed the audition to perform on that “Male Stripper” record. Instead they find themselves in some bizarre parallel universe where Shaky is the ringmaster of risqué. I can’t have seen this particular TOTP as this came as a total and unwanted surprise to me and there’s no way once seen this can be forgotten.\n\n“A Little Boogie Woogie (In The Back Of My Mind)” is the song that he’s performing but that is rendered completely incidental by the shenanigans on screen. Are those dancers wearing codpieces?! I’m not sure which is worse, their routine or when Shaky decides to join in with some lassoing action, a few seconds of running man and that awful trademark move of his when he stands on his insteps together with feet pointed inwards. Oh God – I can’t un-see this!\n\nSomehow this god awful shit reached no 12 on the charts. What’s more, we haven’t even got to the end of his 80s hits yet. There’s another five Top 40 singles to come. And you thought Brexit was the worst never ending nightmare imaginable.\n\nAnother outing for the latest Bond theme next. Apparently A-ha did not have a great working relationship with Bond score composer John Barry when they collaborated on “The Living Daylights”. Barry had previous with the the last Bond theme incumbents Duran Duran and it was they whom he slagged off to A-ha in an attempt to befriend them. Some derogatory comments about women followed and it it didn’t sit well with those nice Norwegian boys at all. With the “A View To A Kill” theme having pulled in some big numbers sales wise, it was felt that A-ha could do a similar job and they were offered the gig. By this time, Duran were on a downward trajectory commercially. I wonder what they made of A-ha not only stealing their position as the No 1 pop group in the world but also their Bond theme mantle?\n\nCheck this out! A live vocal from Colin Vearncombe aka Black on “Sweetest Smile”! Given the emotive quality of his voice, it’s no surprise that he chose to make records that sounded so haunting, hypnotic and earnest. It’s a classy performance and nice to see a double bass on display probably for the first time since….Carmel four years ago (maybe)? By the end of the song it seems like you can’t remember anything before Vearncombe started singing and makes Shaky’s greased up nonsense seem like forever ago even though it was actually only about seven minutes previously that we had to endure it.\n\nA whole stack of Breakers this week and first up are Genesis who, after last week’s excruciating little chat with Simon Bates, have wisely decided not to venture anywhere near the TOTP studio again so we get the video for “Throwing It All Away”. It’s just live concert footage from their “Invisible Touch” tour mixed in with some backstage and soundcheck larking about. All pretty dull stuff much like the song itself. This was the fifth single to be released from “Invisible Touch” and as such was predictably the lowest charting of those singles. It was a different story in the US where it was the second single released from the album and reached No 4.\n\nTo me it always sounded not only like a bog standard Phil Collins solo ballad but also very similar to the other slowie pulled from the album “In Too Deep”. We wouldn’t see Genesis in the charts for another four years when they returned with the “We Can’t Dance” album but Collins would release his No 1 everywhere album “…But Seriously” in between to keep us all entertained. Thanks for that Phil.\n\n*blogger bites his knuckles*\n\nThe Jackie Wilson re-release bandwagon rolls on at a pace with the third of his posthumous singles to make the UK charts in little over 6 months. “(Your Love Keeps Lifting Me) Higher and Higher“ is a great song no doubt but I was 19 and wanted to hear some groovy new sounds not recycled hits of the 60s by dead people. This was 1987 after all. Give us.. err…Living In A Box? Curiosity Killed the Cat?\n\nMel & Kim next proving there was more to them than just “Respectable” and “Showing Out” although to be fair, “F.L.M” was pretty much more of the same. The title track for their album, it doesn’t stray too far away from the formula that made them stars but seeing as it was written and produced by Stock Aitken and Waterman again, why would it? Supposedly standing for ‘Fun, Love, Money’, “F.L.M.” made a respectable (ahem) No 7 on the charts. Fuckin’ lovely mate.\n\nDespite having originated as far back as the 60s, I wasn’t that familiar with Heart in 1987 and certainly not their “Barracuda” era success. I was faintly aware that they had released some soft rock power ballads back in ’85 that had been big hits for them in the US but had met with indifference over here but not much else. “Alone” changed all of that though. The UK audiences took this overwrought, beseeching rock anthem all the way to No 3 (unsurprisingly it was a No 1 in America).\n\nAround this time, the ITV regional stations would fill their late night schedules with some odd programming but one show that I used to watch was Casey Kasem’s America’s Top 10 and seeing “Alone” on there is one of my abiding memories of the song. As well as being a well known DJ, presenter and music historian, Casey was also of course the voice of Shaggy in Scooby Doo. What was not to love about Casey Kasem?!\n\nBack to Heart though and I think the reason that “Alone’ stood out was the stripped back piano intro and bridge before it wanders into that familiar territory of the huge AOR chorus. To be fair, it could easily have been sung by Cher or even Bonnie Tyler at a push. Apparently it was actually covered by Celine Dion about 20 years after Heart had a hit with it but it’s their version that we all know.\n\nOff the back of the success of the single in the UK, a rush of Heart singles were re-released the following year which made strides into the UK Top 40 meaning we’ll be seeing much more of them in future TOTP repeats.\n\nHere come The Christians with the second of four hit singles for them in ’87 “Hooverville (And They Promised Us The World)” was an anti-Thatcher diatribe comparing 80s Britain with the shanty towns built in America during the depression of the ’30s under the presidency of Herbert Hoover. My US history knowledge wasn’t all that it should be at that time so that reference may have been lost on me. Hopefully I didn’t think it was about dissatisfied vacuum cleaner customers.\n\nAs for the sound of the single, I thought it was more melodic than the strident and bold “Forgotten Town”. It was a good, solid proper record. Garry Christian’s vocals are damned smooth and very underrated in my book.\n\n“Hooverville (And They Promised Us The World)” peaked at No 21 in the charts and I’m pretty sure my course mate Roy bought this one on cassette single no less.\n\nHere’s the Top 10…\n\n10. Curiosity Killed The Cat – “Misfit”\n\n9. John Farnham – “You’re The Voice”\n\n8. Whitney Houston – “I Wanna Dance With Somebody (Who Loves Me)”\n\n7. Atlantic Starr – “Always”\n\n6. Cliff Richard – “My Pretty One”\n\n5. A-ha – “The Living Daylights”\n\n4. Terrence Trent D’Arby – “Wishing Well”\n\n3. The Firm – “Star Trekkin”\n\n2. Bruce Willis – “Under The Boardwalk”\n\n1. Pet Shop Boys – “It’s A Sin”: Still riding high in top spot, for me there will always be a tie -in between this record and the film Name Of The Rose which was on circulation in UK cinemas around this time I think. Starring Sean Connery and a very young Christian Slater, it was the cinematic representation of the 1980 Umberto Eco novel, an historical murder mystery set in an Italian monastery in 1327. For me it associated with “It’s A Sin” on a very basic level in that Slater’s character (the young novice monk Adso) shags a peasant girl but I’m sure it was much more involved than that but not having watched it since 1987, I can only comment on my memories of 32 years ago.\n\nI doubt the song shares the same associations for Neil Tennant or Chris Lowe.\n\nThe play out video is Terrence Trent D’Arby with “Wishing Well”. I commented on this song in a recent post that it was unusual for its lack of a chorus. Here’s @TOTPFacts with some more on that:\n\nFor me, one of the song’s hooks is the idiosyncratic way that TTD annunciates “Underneath a sycamore tree” as “Underneath a sycamore tray“. I never really got on board with “Wishing Well” to be honest but what did I know? It went all the way to No 4 in the UK and was a No 1 in the US.\n\nOrder of appearance Artist Song Did I Buy it?\n\n1\n\nShakin’ Stevens A Little Boogie Woogie (In The Back Of My Mind) For the love of God NO!\n\n2\n\nA-ha The Living Daylights No but my sister had it.

Sorry if you don’t agree.\n\nSome bed time reading?\n\nhttp://likepunkneverhappened.blogspot.com/2017/07/july-1-14-1987.html\n\nIt’s 25th June 1987 and it’s been two days since I saw David Bowie play live at Roker Park in Sunderland. It wasn’t a life changing event for me. It wasn’t even a great gig but it’s one of those stories in my life that I will always remember. I’ll come back to Bowie later on as, although this is a blog based around TOTP, it’s also about my memories of 80s music and on that basis, it certainly warrants inclusion.\n\nThe reliability of TOTP being on TV on a Thursday night is, at this point, still an absolute constant. Over the years, FA Cup final replays and even a general election a couple of weeks prior to this broadcast haven’t been able to remove it from its position at the heart of the nation’s habits and routines. It cared not a jot that I had seen a true musical icon performing live a couple of days earlier. TOTP didn’t flinch at this monumental happening. No, it couldn’t give a stuff and nothing was going to make it deviate from dishing me up Cliff Richard, a novelty No 1 and that bloke off Moonlighting (again).\n\nTonight’s presenters are that unlikely pairing of Simon Bates and Peter Powell again and the latter is on very odd form tonight. More of that later. First act tonight is Chris Rea and as seems appropriate in this Bowie themed post that he’s doing a song called “Let’s Dance”. Obviously its not a cover of David’s No 1 from 1983 but Chris’s own song and the performance here is all a bit strange. Chris shuffles about the stage looking like the whole thing is a real bind and he would rather be anywhere else than on TOTP. His backing band include the unusual sight of an accordion player (complete with 80s style moustache) and some other guys who look like they’ve come straight from performing in their covers band’s regular slot down their local boozer. And that’s all before we get onto Rea’s Fletcher Christian style pony tail! None of this can distract me from my opinion that “Lets’ Dance” is not only not one of Chris’s best songs, it’s just not a good song full stop.\n\nThe song was recycled 10 years after this to become the FA Cup final song for his home town team Middlesborough with added contributions from Bob Mortimer. My beloved Chelsea were Boro’s opponents in the final that day and as well as the match winning 2-0 we also had the better cup final song courtesy of Suggs and “Blue Day”. Yes we did!\n\nHere’s that Bruce Willis video again for his version of “Under The Boardwalk”. It was written by one Artie Resnick whose name reminds me of Artie Fufkin one of my favourite characters in the brilliant This Is Spinal Tap film. Artie’s most quotable lines were:\n\nArtie: [after nobody turns up, at an album-signing promotion] You know what I want you to do? Will you do something for me?\n\nDavid St Hubbins: What?\n\nArtie: Do me a favour. Just kick my ass, okay? Kick this ass for a man, that’s all. Kick my ass. Enjoy. Come on. I’m not asking, I’m telling with this. Kick my ass.\n\nOh and if you must listen to a cover of this Drifters classic, how about John Mellencamp’s rather than Bruce bloody Willis…\n\nStand well back! Imperial phase coming through! Yes it can only be Pet Shop Boys who, after a misfiring start, a huge No 1 in “West End Girls” followed by some fine tunes that achieved commercially average chart placings, are set to embark upon a run of unparalleled success. Over the next nine months they released five singles starting with “It’s A Sin” that achieved the numbers 1, 2, 8, 1 and 1 of which the fourth was the Xmas No 1. They also released a three times platinum LP (“Actually”). This was unbelievable success which I think sometimes goes under the radar with more made of the likes of Westlife and Take That in the 90s and One Direction and Little Mix more recently.\n\nThe first time I heard “It’s A Sin”, I was staggered by its huge production. Talk about the kitchen sink! There’s everything in there. Obviously huge synthesizers and orchestra sound effects but also a NASA countdown, a thunder clap, passages of Latin, a choir singing ‘Amen’ and of course, running throughout it, Neil Tennant’s deadpan vocals. It was absolutely epic! Drenched in references to Catholic guilt, it had its origin as as far back as 1982 but Neil and Chris decided to omit it from their first album “Please” and to keep it back for their second album. Imagine the confidence to hold back a song like “It’s A Sin” when you are trying to break into the fickle world of pop. Only Noel Gallagher comes to mind as having done a similar thing when he kept back “All Around The World” for Oasis’s third album despite having written it a the same time as the material for their debut LP “Definitely Maybe”.\n\n“It’s A Sin” went straight into the Top 40 at No 5 which was a feat in itself back then. it would be No 1 soon enough.\n\nThe Top 40 countdown is next and as fortune would have it, who’s that in at No 40 but David Bowie which seems a reasonable place to return to the story of his gig that I attended. Actually the word ‘gig’ doesn’t even begin to cover it. This was a fully monumental theatrical show complete with a 60 ft high spider with protruding legs, 3-story high mobile scaffolding, clips of film and projected images. Bowie also had what was then cutting edge wireless microphone technology at his disposal for the first time and he employed it extensively to allow him to move about the stage freely and interact with the dancers and musicians and to perform pre planned set pieces.\n\nBefore all of that though were the support acts. For this leg of the tour we got Screaming Blue Messiahs and Big Country. The latter were brilliant and if I’m honest the most enjoyable part of the evening. The former? Well, my mate Robin said he was only going just to see them and wasn’t bothered about Bowie and I don’t think he was kidding. You may recall their only ever hit “I Wanna Be a Flintstone”. You may not.\n\nFinally it was time for the great man himself and after keeping us waiting and waiting, he finally arrived on stage over an hour late. And what did he say to the crowd once he’d finally arrived?…\n\nMy Glass Spider tour programme which is currently 32 years old…”Good evening Newcastle!”. To a crowd of Mackems in the Sunderland football club stadium! It didn’t go down well at all.\n\nFinally though the show was happening and to be honest I can’t recall too much about it. Wikipedia tells me the set list included classics like “Heroes”, “Let’s Dance”, “Fame” and “Fashion” as well as nearly every song from his underwhelming “Never Let Me Down” album. I do remember the song “Glass Spider” which gave the tour its name with its pretentious dialogue intro and Bowie being lowered from the spider structure onto the stage. I also remember the long walk back to my student halls at the end of the night. There’s a film of one of the shows from the tour on Sky Arts which I should probably watch to refresh my memory. I am super pleased that I went though and can say that I saw one of the world’s greatest ever musical icons live.\n\nBack to TOTP after that Bowie interlude and this is the time in the show that Peter Powell starts to lose it. Check out his intro to “Wishing Well” by Terence Trent D’Arby:\n\n“This is Terence Trent D’Arby and ‘Wishing…long pause….\n\n*don’t say “I was Lucky”…don’t say “I Was lucky”*\n\n…WELL!”\n\nI always though this was a curious song not least because it doesn’t seem to have a proper chorus. Instead you get that instrumental break that sounds like a jingle for an advert. I hadn’t realised before I did some research that this had been huge in the US. I always thought that TTD had been a bigger deal over here than in the States but although “If You Let Me Stay” had under performed over the pond, “Wishing Well” had been an actual No 1 record. It was a smash over here too peaking at No 4.\n\nHis two male backing singers in this performance are quite hard to take seriously. The height difference and the jaunty baseball cap make them look like some awful 80s comedy duo.\n\nJust the two Breakers this week which is the cue for more peculiar pronouncements from Peter Powell. The Simple Minds? Really Pete?!\n\nComing off the back of the hugely influential track “Sign O’ The Times”, I guess the next Prince release was always going to struggle to make its mark but I really didn’t get “If I Was Your Girlfriend”. Maybe I wasn’t emotionally mature enough to understand what Prince was trying to do lyrically which was to sing the song from the perspective of being his lover’s platonic girlfriend. Or maybe it was just that I wasn’t musically mature enough and found the song’s sound quite ponderous without much in the way of melody. Either way, it wasn’t for me then and still isn’t now.\n\n“If I Was Your Girlfriend” made No 20 in the UK but was a relative failure in the US topping out at No 67.\n\nTime for The Simple Minds then (you had one job Powell, one job!). Why was a live version of “Promised You A Miracle” in the charts? Well, much like Bruce Springsteen the other week with his live version of “Born To Run”, they had a live album to promote. “Live In The City Of Light” was a double LP that documented the band’s Once Upon A Time world tour and was a No 1 for them. The only song picked from it to promote the project was their debut hit from 1982. I always though it was not the most obvious choice given that they were into their stadium rock phase and songs like “Don’t You (Forget About Me)” and “Alive And Kicking” had been huge global hits showcasing that sound.\n\nJim Kerr couldn’t look more 80s than he does in the clip here with his big shouldered jacket and massive mullet. “Promised You A Miracle” the live version got to No 19 which was six places lower than the original studio version.\n\nAlready into the fourth decade of his recording career by this point, Cliff Richard was nowhere near finished with us by 1987. In truth, his 80s output had been a bit sketchy. Huge hits early on like “Carrie” and “Wired For Sound” led to some medium sized hits like “She Means Nothing To Me” and “Never Say Die (Give a Little Bit More)” and by the mid point of the decade he was having more misses than hits. Some collaborations turned his fortunes around. A No 1 for Comic Relief with The Young Ones in 1986 was followed by the duet with Sarah Brightman “All I Ask Of You”. Teaming up with another artist didn’t always work for him though. “Two Rivers” that he recorded with Elton John no less stalled at No 44.\n\n“My Pretty One” would give him his first Top Tenner completely on his on for four years though. As Simon Bates tells us, it was written by Alan Tarney who had composed the aforementioned “Wired For Sound” for Sir Cliff but he hadn’t been the first singer to have a go at the song. Anyone remember Jamie Rae? I’m guessing not and that’s no surprise. He was a here today gone tomorrow Scottish wannabe pop heart throb who released two singles in the mid 80s one of which was the original version of “My Pretty One”. Play Jamie’s version and see if you can hear any difference from Cliff’s (apart from the vocals obviously). I’ll wait…\n\nExactly the same right? Jamie disappeared from the pop world before he had a chance to make it big but the story of why is a moving one:\n\nJamie Rae 30 years on: The former teenage heart-throb back on stage at Pleasure Beach\n\nI guess if Peter Powell’s weird intonations were ever going to sound in context then this week’s Top 10 rundown would be it as we get “Nothing’s Gonna Stop Us Now” from Starship and “Nothing’s Gonna Stop Me Now” from Sam Fox. Why does he continue to refuse to say the word ‘sex’ though when announcing George Michael at No 4. Simon Mayo was allowed to say it the other week.\n\n10. Starship – “Nothing’s Gonna Stop Us Now”\n\n9. Curiosity KIlled The Cat – Misfit\n\n8. Sam Fox – “Nothing’s Gonna Stop Me Now”\n\n7. John Farnham – “You’re The Voice”\n\n6. Johnny Logan – “Hold Me Now”\n\n5. Pet Shop Boys – “It’s A Sin”\n\n4. George Michael – “I Want Your Sex”\n\n4. Bruce Willis – “Under The Boardwalk”\n\n2. Whitney Houston – ” I Wanna Dance With Somebody (Who Loves Me)”\n\n1. The Firm – “Star Trekkin”: The second and final week at No 1. I’ve not been able to get this out of my head since hearing again for the first time in 32 years! As awful as it is, you have to admit it’s catchy. Also, full marks to whoever was responsible for the Dr McCoy impersonation. The ‘It’s worse than that he’s dead Jim’ line is spot on.\n\nGod the TOTP producers loved this didn’t they?! How many times has John Farnham been on the show with “You’re The Voice”? To be fair, the single did hang around the charts for what seemed like an eternity so I guess he was guaranteed to pick up a few appearances. The song spent 18 weeks in the Top 100 and 12 of them in the Top 40 including seven week on week rises.\n\nOrder of appearance Artist Song Did I Buy it?\n\n1\n\nChris Rea Let’s Dance Nah\n\n2\n\nBruce Willis Up On The Boardwalk A resounding NO!\n\n3\n\nPet Shop Boys It’s A Sin Not the 7” but I ‘m sure I had the album on tape at one time.\n\n4\n\nTerence Trent D’Arby Wishing Well Nope but I think my wife had the album\n\n5\n\nPrince If I Was Your Girlfriend No – didn’t get it at all.\n\n6\n\nSimple Minds Promised You A Miracle (live) Didn’t feel the need to acquire this one either\n\n7\n\nCliff Richard My Pretty One Let me see….NO!\n\n8\n\nThe Firm Star Trekkin’ The very idea!\n\n9\n\nJohn Farnham You’re The Voice A guilty pleasure but I never bought it\n\nDisclaimer\n\nOK – here’s the thing – the TOTP episodes are only available on iPlayer for a limited amount of time so the link to the programme below only works for about another month so you’ll have to work fast if you want to catch the whole show as I can’t find the full programme on YouTube.\n\nhttps://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/m00038ls/top-of-the-pops-25061987\n\nI make no claim to the rights of this show and all ownership and contents including logos and graphics belongs totally to the BBC or copyright holder(s).\n\nAll opinions on the music and artists featured are my own. Sorry if you don’t agree.\n\nSome bed time reading?\n\nhttp://likepunkneverhappened.blogspot.com/2017/06/june-17-30-1987.html\n\nThis particular TOTP was one of those ‘live’ shows which the BBC liked to hype – how many times does presenter Gary Davies mention that it’s a live broadcast in the space of 30 minutes?! I never understood why we should be excited about this concept though given that the acts were all miming anyway.\n\nDefinitely falling into this category are opening act Five Star (for the love of God! Not again!) who are more concerned about jumping and leaping about the stage in perfect synchronisation than the illusion that they are singing live. In a Smash Hits interview it transpired that it only took them one and a half hours to get the routine for “Slightest Touch” down pat. I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again. They weren’t really a proper pop group were they? Just one half decent vocalist and a bunch of backing dancers. Bah!\n\nNow here’s a proper band! The Smiths were absolutely prolific at releasing singles and here’s another one in “Sheila Take A Bow”. This was the last of a run of four consecutive non -album singles and would be the band’s last Top 10 hit (not including post break-up re-releases).\n\nInterestingly this TOTP performance became the official video for the song after the planned recording at Brixton Academy didn’t happen when Morrissey failed to turn up at the venue. To say that they were months away from splitting, Morrissey seems care free enough doing his best Kenneth Williams impression whilst Johnny Marr’s outfit suggests he’s eyeing a spot in Fairground Attraction post The Smiths. Coincidentally, Mark Nevin, who wrote the No 1 “Perfect”, did work with Morrissey after Fairground Attraction were no more.\n\nThe titular Sheila was supposedly the playwright Shelagh Delaney who wrote Morrissey favourite A Taste Of Honey. I had no idea of this at the time of course. I thought Morrissey had been watching a lot of Aussie soap Neighbours and picked up an Antipodean colloquialism.\n\nNext, a man who can barely believe his luck that he is back on the TOTP stage once more. Junior Giscombe was last seen on the nation’s No 1 pop programme some five years previously. Nobody really expected to see him back on prime time TV ever again. Never underestimate the appeal of Kim Wilde though. Her duetting with Junior on “Another Step” gave his career an enormous shot in the arm and he was ready to take the opportunity with both hands. He’s donned his best leather trousers and shades to make him feel every inch the pop star. Kim, on the other hand, is taking this latest successful phase in her stride and gone all dress down Friday in her outfit choice with just a plain white shirt and jeans.\n\nWhilst Kim would spend the next 18 months having a string of big hits and supporting Michael Jackson on his “Bad” tour, Junior would retreat back into the ‘where are they now?’ cupboard only resurfacing briefly for a No 32 hit in 1992 with “Then Came You”.\n\nPossibly one of the most boring songs of the whole decade next. Who remembers Judy Boucher? She was a reggae singer from St Vincent in the Caribbean who rather unbelievably became a huge star in 1987 thanks to her single “Can’t Be With You Tonight”. Supposedly broken in the UK by its inclusion as the backing track for a fitness workout routine with 80s TV star Mad Lizzie on Good Morning Britain, Judy went on to become a huge success around the world especially in Belgium and South Africa. How did this happen? Your guess is as good as mine. I mean the song is undeniably soporific. Supposedly Judy was asked to tour in Swaziland and people literally lost their minds over her, offering her gifts of gold and animals wherever she went! That’s according to Wikipedia anyway.\n\nObviously I hated this. Nothing personal Judy it was just that your song was shite.\n\nIt’s the Breakers and first up an AOR colossus. In fact, you’d have to say that Starship are most well known for two massive AOR hits. “We Built This City” is still played to death on retro radio stations to this day but two years after that, Grace Slick and co followed it up with “Nothing’s Gonna Stop Us Now” from the soundtrack to the film Mannequin which would be an even bigger hit reaching No 1 in both the UK and US singles charts.\n\nUnquestionably cheesy, the song does have a undeniable feel good factor which almost reeled me in back in the day (almost!). The video is heavily based on Mannequin and for years afterwards during my Our Price days and before the age of Spotify, iTunes and the like, you could guarantee that if the film was aired on terrestrial TV then the next day, someone would come in and ask for “Nothing’s Gonna Stop Us Now”. Invariably we would not have it in as it was a years old 7″ that had long since been deleted.\n\nAsk someone to name a Tom Jones song and I’m guessing that hardly anybody would come up with “A Boy From Nowhere” as their first answer. The song was part of a concept album called “Matador” which would ultimately mutate into a musical in the early 90s starring John Barrowman. For Tom Jones though, it was the song that gave him his first UK hit for 15 long years.\n\nMy memory of this single is that it was on the jukebox in my student union bar of choice at the time and due to some programming error, the B-side to it would often be played instead of the punter’s actual choice. This went on for weeks as I remember or maybe it was just one very drunken night that drove me to distraction. I can’t be sure now. Either way, Tom took “A Boy From Nowhere” all the way to No 2 which prompted the inevitable back catalogue reissue programme by his record label. There’ll be more Tom Jones before the decade is out….\n\nThe next act is just beyond words. Quite how did it come to pass that Spurs footballers Glenn Hoddle and Chris Waddle came to be on TOTP?! This was no cup final sing -a- long nonsense nor was it a Gazza style tongue in cheek effort à la “Fog On The Tyne” which he released off the back of Italia 90 fever. This was a serious attempt at being pop stars! Its unconscionable. The legend goes that Glenn and Chris got drunk at some awards ceremony and got up on stage for a bit of karaoke. Some friend (whoever they are deserve to be named and shamed – your time will come) thought they sounded good and put them in touch with a songwriter and suddenly “Diamond Lights” was born. It goes without saying that the song is just dreadful. All brooding and angst ridden, it just looks and sounds ridiculous delivered by Hoddle and Waddle. Ah! Was that the real reasoning behind pairing these two together? That their surnames rhymed?! Bloody Hell! Early 90s Crystal Palace strike force Ian Wright and Mark Bright missed a trick didn’t they?!\n\nGlenn looks like he’s been preparing for this moment his whole life in this performance whereas Chris looks like he’d rather be eating his own arm. I notice Glenn has a white belt on. That couldn’t have been the inspiration for my fashion choice at this time surely?! I do feel sorry for the backing band though. They must have been thinking “Bollocks! How did it all come to this?!”\n\n“Diamond Lights” made No 12 on the UK singles chart – there must be a load of copies stashed away in a lock up somewhere in London registered to one G. Hoddle.\n\nTop 10…\n\n10. Fine Young Cannibals – “Ever Fallen In Love”\n\n9. Janet Jackson – “Let’s Wait A While”\n\n8. Five Star – “The Slightest Touch”\n\n7. Terence Trent D’Arby – “If You Let Me Stay”\n\n6. Living In A Box – “Living In A Box”\n\n5. Mel & Kim – “Respectable”\n\n4. Ferry Aid – “Let It Be”\n\n3. Club Nouveau – “Lean On Me”\n\n2. Judy Boucher – “Can’t Be With You Tonight”\n\n1. Madonna – “La Isla Bonita” – I’m pretty sure I was bored by this by now. For me, 1987 was not a golden year for Madonna. She followed this up by releasing three singles from the soundtrack to her film Who’s That Girl none of which were any good in my opinion. After a year away, she would come back in 1989 with the “Like A Prayer” album which was much more of a return to form but that’s all for another day/ year…\n\nOne of the stories of 1987 is upon us. Terence Trent D’Arby cut an unlikely figure as a bona fide pop star. Coming to fame after time as a teenage boxer and as a soldier in the US Army stationed in Germany, Terence burst into our pop lives as if fully formed with his debut single “If You Let Me Stay”. Pulling off the memorable trick of delivering a retro soul sounding record that came across as completely fresh and new, it went Top 10 and set the tone for a stratospheric year for the man now known as Sananda Maitreya. Described in the press as a cross between Sam Cooke and Michael Jackson the media attention he generated was intense. This was fuelled partly by his own bravado whereby he would never flinch at declaring his own genius. He described his debut album as the most important album since the Beatles’ “Sgt. Pepper”.\n\nAh yes, that debut album. Just about everyone had a copy of “Introducing the Hardline According to Terence Trent D’Arby”. Except my friend Rachel. She did buy it but unfortunately she took a trip to Hull Marina on the way home and dropped it between the slats of a jetty walkway and it drifted out to sea never to be seen again. 32 years later, I’m not sure if she ever replaced it.\n\nOrder of appearance Artist Song Did I Buy it?\n\n1\n\nFive Star The Slightest Touch NO!\n\n2\n\nThe Smiths Sheila Take A Bow No I didn’t but I haven’t been able to get it out of my head all this week\n\n3\n\nKim Wilde / Junior Another Step (Closer To You) Nah\n\n4\n\nJudy Boucher Can’t Be With You Tonight I wasn’t suffering from insomnia at the time so no\n\n5\n\nStarship Nothing’s Gonna Stop Us Now Nope\n\n6\n\nTom Jones A Boy From Nowhere Heavens no!\n\n7\n\nGlenn And Chris Diamond Lights How did anyone fall for this?\n\n8\n\nMadonna La Isla Bonita No but it’s on my Immaculate Collection CD\n\n9\n\nTerence Trent D’Arby If You Let Me Stay No but I think my wife had the album.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nOK – here’s the thing – the TOTP episodes are only available on iPlayer for a limited amount of time so the link to the programme below only works for about another month so you’ll have to work fast if you want to catch the whole show as I can’t find the full programme on YouTube.\n\nhttps://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/m0002pfn/top-of-the-pops-23041987\n\nI make no claim to the rights of this show and all ownership and contents including logos and graphics belongs totally to the BBC or copyright holder(s).\n\nAll opinions on the music and artists featured are my own.
