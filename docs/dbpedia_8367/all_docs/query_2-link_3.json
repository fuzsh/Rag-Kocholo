        "text": "Who were Climie Fisher?\n\nClimie Fisher featured singer Simon Climie and former Naked Eyes keyboardist Rob Fisher.\n\nThe duo met at the iconic Abbey Road Studios, where they were booked into the same demo session.\n\nAfter quickly hitting it off, including bonding over their love of The Beatles, they decided to form a group together.\n\nWhat were their biggest hits?\n\nClimie Fisher - Love Changes Everything\n\nTheir first album, titled Everything, was charted at number 14 in the UK.\n\nIt contained the singles 'Love Changes Everything' (#2 UK) and 'Rise to the Occasion' (#10).\n\nHowever their second, Coming In For The Kill, wasn't as successful and stalled at a disappointing number 45.\n\nTheir last top 40 hit was 1988's 'Love Like a River' (#22).\n\nWhat happened next?\n\nThe band split up soon after the release of their second album.\n\nFisher later co-wrote Rick Astley's song 'Cry for Help'. He also contributed as a songwriter to Astley's albums Free and Body & Soul (1993).\n\nFisher sadly died on August 25, 1999, during surgery for bowel cancer, aged just 42.\n\nBefore the band, Simon Climie had co-written the George Michael and Aretha Franklin hit 'I Knew You Were Waiting (For Me)' in 1986.\n\nHe also worked as a producer for artists such as Louise, MN8 and Five Star, and as a songwriter and musician for Eric Clapton.\n\nHe has also worked with Michael McDonald on his Motown albums, and produced the 2009 album by American Idol winner Taylor Hicks."
