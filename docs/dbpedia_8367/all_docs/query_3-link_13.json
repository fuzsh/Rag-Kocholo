        "text": "English new wave duo\n\nNot to be confused with Naked eye.\n\nNaked Eyes are an English new wave duo[1] that rose to prominence in the early 1980s. The band had four US top 40 singles.\n\nThe group's first hit, \"Always Something There to Remind Me\", is a cover of the Burt Bacharach/Hal David standard. The band had subsequent hits with more of their own compositions: \"Promises, Promises\", \"When the Lights Go Out\", and \"(What) In the Name of Love\".\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nNaked Eyes was formed by Pete Byrne and Rob Fisher. The two had formerly been part of a band called Neon, with future members of Tears for Fears.[2]\n\nThe debut album Burning Bridges was produced by Tony Mansfield, along with the follow-up album Fuel for the Fire, which also featured two titles produced by Arthur Baker. Their second and third singles, \"Promises, Promises\" (the 12\" mix of which features vocals from Madonna) and \"When the Lights Go Out\", were also hit singles in the United States.\n\nFollowing the release of the band's second album, Byrne moved to California. He performed on Stevie Wonder's \"Part-Time Lover\", sang backgrounds with Rita Coolidge and Princess Stephanie, and wrote and produced for the Olsen twins.[3] Fisher also explored other projects, doing sessions in London and forming Climie Fisher with Simon Climie.\n\nThe group never toured due to the technical difficulties of recreating their studio sound in concert.[1]\n\nRob Fisher died on 25 August 1999, age 42, following surgery for bowel cancer.[4]\n\nByrne released a solo album The Real Illusion in 2001, which featured some of the last tracks he wrote with Fisher for a proposed third Naked Eyes album. In 2005, Byrne put a band together to play Naked Eyes shows, and has been touring regularly since. In 2007, Naked Eyes released Fumbling with the Covers, an acoustic album which consisted of covers of Bob Dylan, The Beatles and Elvis Costello, among others, along with the Naked Eyes hits.\n\nIn the summer of 2008, Naked Eyes completed a US tour along with Belinda Carlisle, ABC and the Human League. Naked Eyes did a US tour with the Go-Go's, Scandal and the Motels in 2014 and has been touring each summer since; Naked Eyes' 2020 tour was postponed to 2021 due to COVID-19 related restrictions.[5]\n\nOn 8 June 2021, Naked Eyes released its latest album, Disguise the Limit.[6]\n\nIn 2024, Naked Eyes toured as part of the Abducted by the 80's tour across the US and Canada with fellow 80's acts Wang Chung, Men Without Hats, and The Motels.[7]\n\nDiscography\n\n[edit]\n\nStudio albums\n\n[edit]\n\nBurning Bridges (1983) US #32,[8] AUS #88[9] (self-titled in the US & Canada, with modified track listing and different cover artwork)\n\nFuel for the Fire (1984) US #83[8]\n\nFumbling with the Covers (2007)\n\nDisguise the Limit (2021)[10]\n\nCompilation albums\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Best of Naked Eyes (1991)\n\nPromises, Promises (The Very Best of Naked Eyes) (1994)\n\nNaked Eyes / Spandau Ballet – Back 2 Back Hits (1998)\n\nEverything and More (2002)\n\nSingles\n\n[edit]\n\nList of singles, with selected chart positions Title Year Peak chart positions Album UK\n\n[11] AUS\n\n[9] CAN NZ\n\n[12] US US\n\nAC US\n\nDance \"Always Something There to Remind Me\" 1983 59 7 9 2 8 31 37 Burning Bridges/Naked Eyes \"Voices in My Head\" — — — — — — — \"Promises, Promises\" 95 — 13 15 11 19 32 \"When the Lights Go Out\" — — — — 37 — — \"(What) In the Name of Love\" 1984 — — 77 — 39 — 35 Fuel for the Fire \"—\" denotes a recording that did not chart or was not released in that territory.\n\nMusic videos\n\n[edit]\n\n\"Always Something There to Remind Me\" (1982)\n\n\"Promises, Promises\" (1983)\n\n\"Voices in My Head\" (1983)\n\n\"When the Lights Go Out\" (1983)\n\n\"(What) In the Name of Love\" (1984)\n\n\"Cry Baby Cry\" (2007)\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
