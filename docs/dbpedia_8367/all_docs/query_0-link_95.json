I will do none of these things.\n\nEveryone knows about 76, Punk!! It was also the year Chris persuaded me to buy a guitar. Naturally I did because he was in the brainy class and he must have had a good reason for asking me to do this.\n\nThe reason for having a guitar was to turn an amp up loud and pretend you were Hendrix and oddly enough for that time Ted Nugent. That's when I knew I would have to learn to write songs. What also inspired me was seeing this kid called Damon from school playing in a punk group called The Pigs. With a click of the fingers this non-descript lad from 4S was transformed into a god! And I wanted some of that! Bristol bands that meant something to me then were The Media and The Cortinas. By 78 Chris and myself and a 13 year old called Jimmy were in a band called The Hybrids. We were unashamedly Jam copyists with a bit of Kinks, Clash and Stones thrown in for good measure. There was this great little pub called The Stonehouse where Bristol's handful of mod/skin/punks hung out to watch their mate's bands. We had no mates but because I would always smash my amp up people liked us. We began to play the place on a regular basis and to my surprise became quite popular. We used to play with a band called Thin Air who really were like the Jam, many years later Thin Airs singer Paul Sandrone would play in the last line up of The Brilliant Corners. Fitting in a strange way.\n\nAnother band I remember back then was Concrete Contraption, now they could play proper but they were crap! Interesting to note that Si John of Reprazent fame started life in this band. You could see an interesting band every other day at The Stone house. Today it's an office block.\n\nI can't remember exactly when or even if this is totally right but Jimmy who played drums left because his mum was either fed up of taking us to gigs, me and Chris throwing up in the van (Jimmy couldn't get drunk while his mum was around) or us buying a Doctor Rhythm drum machine.\n\nWhen you're sixteen and playing live every other week you develop fast. In the space of a few years The Hybrids had become two boys and a drum machine not too surprisingly we sounded like Echo and the Bunnymen meets Joy Division. We played places called Mistys Nite Club and the Ace of Spades where I snogged my first fan. She was very drunk and threw up in my mouth while we were wriggling tongues. We went to a gig every night. I don't know where the money came from; well I do actually, um, stolen goods. We discovered amyl nitrate, speed, dope, and sometimes sex.\n\nWhen I left school I got a job as a lab technician. It was while doing this I met a lad called Dan who played in a band called The Glaxo Babies, they had a record out and had been played on John Peel. I was awe struck! Dan would bring his guitar into work and at lunch times he would show me things called dis-chords which totally blew me away. He also told me to check out Captain Beefheart which I did not get at all. Around this time I saw The Pop Group play which I did get, and Essential Bop and Art Objects and all those Fried Egg bands that people referred to as the Clifton Scene. At that time I had a real problem relating to the so-called Clifton Scene. The people in those bands made me feel dumb me and Chris had working class chips on our shoulders. I would see these people in the Dugout but I had nothing in common with them. I never got invited to parties or happenings. This lot were educated and pretentious and boy were we jealous!\n\nThere were loads of bands hanging out at the Dugout but I think The Hybrids were the only ones that danced to soul at The Turntable Club and slid on our jackets at Romeo and Juliet's to James Brown, but that's another story.\n\nDavey Woodward.\n\n(HYBRIDS, BRILLIANT CORNERS, EXPERIMENTAL POP BAND)\n\n» back to top\n\nTHE CORTINAS\n\n» THE CORTINAS DISCOGRAPHY\n\nJeremy Valentine\n\nDexter Dalwood\n\nNick Sheppard\n\nMike Fewins\n\nDaniel Swan\n\n» back to top\n\nTHE CRAZY TRAINS\n\n» THE CRAZY TRAINS DISCOGRAPHY\n\nJohn McLean\n\nPaul Grudzinski\n\nJon Chilcott\n\nBarry Cooper\n\nNeil Mackie\n\nLater to be\n\n(The Crazy Bones)\n\nJohn McLean\n\nPaul Grudzinski\n\nMike Crawford\n\nChris Gregory\n\nJim Drakett\n\nManaged by Mike Tobin who also managed Stackridge.

I had been let into the house by Rachel, who was setting about clearing up some of the debris in the kitchen - the result of five ravenous souls returning in the early hours after a recording session in London. But of the five Guitars there was as yet no sign, Rachel informing me that Andy was tucked up in bed in his flat somewhere in Clifton, Matthew was out jogging - well drummers must keep fit! - and the others were away in the Land of Nod.\n\nAfter a couple of cups of tea my patience was finally rewarded by the appearance of a haggard and drawn Richard staggering into the kitchen, followed shortly afterwards by an equally worse for wear Dick. An adequate reflection of the perils of trying to become rock stars, I take pity on their condition and wait a few minutes more before plunging into that time-honoured journalistic ritual of discussion of developments and problems. Fortunately once life-giving fluids and the first cigarette of the day had been consumed the grey matter made a brave attempt at re-assembling themselves and some form of coherence asserted itself.\n\nElectric Guitars were formed two years ago and made their recorded debut on the first volume of the innovative and imaginative 'Bristol Recorder' disc/magazine. The four Guitars contributions were, as with the other, recorded 'live' and display a more jagged and XTC-style attack than the more sophisticated and varied angle they use now. (As a point of interest the record is due to be re-released this year due to the Guitars popularity). 'Magic Surfaces' and 'Dumb Words' rarely feature on current outings, but the inimitable hassle in 'Le Camping' is still a stage favorite and 'Continental Shelf' appeared on the flip-side of their first single for local label Fried Egg - now sadly somewhat hard-boiled and dealing more with Shoes for Industry output. 'Health' is a wicked dissection of the calorie and cholestorol conscious fads of the jogging and fitness freaks and was an over-looked gem from last year and one of the reasons for its poor showing was a lack of effective promotion and distribution.\n\nThe follow-up 'Work' has of course faired far better having figured in the lower reaches of the indie singles chart and has received a respectable volume of radio exposure - a fact that can largely go down to the efforts of Recreational Records, run from the back office in Revolver Records. In spite of its instant appeal 'Work' did create some confusion in the mind of one reviewer - yes.Barney Hoskyns - due to the split recording credits, and behind its production lies a tale of amusement and frustration.\n\nDick: \"The single was initially recorded with Denis Bovell. He was fun to work with but wasn't the right sort of producer for our kind of music really. For one thing the bass and bass drum sound were all wrong. Things weren't helped by the studio being flooded after we'd done our first session! That delayed further recording by a couple of weeks and after that Denis seemed to lose his enthusiasm, and certainly his normal spontaneity in the studio.\n\nIt seemed to us that his energy and interest only extended to a limited period, and with the way he works it's more a question of bursts of inspiration rather than a consistent application. It was a shame, so in the end we had to finish off the single in Steve Street's SAM Studio which is where we rehearse, and the single sounds as good as it can be given the circumstances but isn't completely what we wanted.\"\n\nThere are several parties interested in the Guitars distinct brand of mutated reverberations, and this has led to several visits to London to record demos. Fortunately with the groups finances being in a perilous state the money to do this has been put up by the companies concerned, such as EMI and Pre. But in spite of this Richard wasn't altogether satisfied with the arrangements and the results. \"It was ridiculous,\" he said \"in the EMI studio we were given just enough time to enable us to finish putting down the music and vocals, and in the end we were left with just half an hour to mix down each track. Still we didn't pay for it and the experience won't all be to waste.\"\n\nWhile Richard was speaking a breathless Matthew came in and quietly sat down on a chair in the corner of the room. Even though his Feelies-style coiffure was extremely out-of-sorts he was suitably refreshed by his exertions, his mind was alert and he quickly picked up on the conversation. \"Do you want to know about one of the songs we recorded?\" he asked me. \"It's called Ja-Ja and has Andy and Neil reading extracts from The Empire Strikes Back over a lot of 'star-track' voices. It really came out well and I think it's one of the best things we've done.\" So what were the other songs you've recorded then? Matthew continued: \"Well if my memory serves me right we did several of the newer songs like 'Lovely Statues', 'Beat me Hollow', 'Language Problems' and 'Voice of Sound'.\" (These songs were also done for the Kid Jensen programme and broadcast on December 15th last year)\n\nThe Radio One session will be the culmination of processes which have enables the Guitars to reach a wider audience than has been the experience of other talented Bristol bands in the past. One of the most significant break-throughs for them last year was supporting the Thompson Twins on their twenty-date British tour last year. This came about through Neil and Dick meeting the band at the Granary and when the Twins commented that they were pissed off with the standard of the local support acts they were getting lumbered with Neil suggested the Guitars would be interested and would be a sympathetic foil to the Thompson Twins equally energetic stage act. This tour in its aftermath led to some flak being aimed at the Guitars, the accusers saying that they ripped off the Twins. Dick strongly disagreed and pointed out that although one or two features may have rubbed off it was a reciprocal process, and that was an inevitability considering the two bands were on the road together for three weeks. For example in a more physical form clothes and instruments were swopped round freely, and at some gigs so were the musicians! These jibes are really total non-starters and best treated with the scorn they deserve.\n\n\"What we do tends to be an anti-response; for example a lot of bands are very static on stage, so we decided to be very active. It was very difficult to break down our inhibitions at first. What you say about Neil seeming to be aggressive isn't strictly accurate. He had less of a problem because he was a martial arts instructor at one time, and he's into throwing himself around on stage. Also he's not hampered or restricted by having to hold and play an instrument. It's good fun for Neil as he likes revving up an audience anyway, particularly if their reactions to us are too sluggish!\"\n\nMatthew laughed and commented on how different the content and approaches of the two groups are, admitting there were some similarities but highlighting the emphasis the Guitars put on vocal arrangements:\n\n\"It's not so much a question of what we sing, as some of the lyrics are in a deeper sense quite banal, but it's more down to how they're sung. A similar point was made by Elvis Costello on that Southbank programme and it's an important disitinction to make.\n\nDick: \"I think we will be using Jo and Wendy a lot more too, especially on the older songs as having them singing gives the songs a new lease of life. We tried them out on stage first of all at a gig at the Venue which worked quite well and since then as long as we get the sound balance right its been sounding better and better.\"\n\nIn fact the Electric Guitars are by now as familiar to London gig-goers as they are in Bristol, having spent many evenings in the capital, supporting the likes of U2 and Our Daughters Wedding, as well as headlining in their own right. The 'Wedding' gig took place at the Venue and is an evening they would sooner forget as they came up against the narcissic and hyped aspects of the biz which disgusts anyone with integrity.\n\nRichard: \"ODW were this hip synthesiser group from the States who took five hours over their sound-check, and during most of that time were sitting around eating McDonalds and generally pratting around. We were getting so fed up with hanging around that we almost decided to push off and forget about the gig. Fortunately we didn't as although we weren't able to do a proper sound-check we played well and were told afterwards that we'd blown them off stage!\"\n\nPerhaps not a surprising result considering the fact that the Guitars 'live' are a powerful combination of an invigorating instrumental capability mixed with an action packed physical presence. It's a busyness which has spilled over into the business and right now the band are being checked out by prospective managers and involved with the never ending battle with the bank manager. But they are keeping cheerful and patient, certain that the right offer will come along. Dick wryly commented, mindful of how many other bands in the past in their position have said the same thing:\n\n\"We've not been hasty and taken the first offer that came our way. We did come very close to signing something a few weeks back and we're very glad we didn't as now we're in more of a position to take the highest bidder with the least strings attached. ! hope.\"\n\nInterview by Dave Massey (Taken from his Future Days Fanzine)\n\n» back to top\n\nESSENTIAL BOP\n\n» THE ESSENTIAL BOP DISCOGRAPHY\n\nSteve Bush\n\nSimon Tyler\n\nDanny Cotterill\n\nDave Robinson\n\nPhil Howard\n\nMike Fewins\n\n» See Album Releases\n\nEssential Bop was one of those 'post-punk' bands that flourished everywhere in the immediate aftermath of the tidal wave that had not long before engulfed things like facial hair, lengthy solos, baggy trousers and Tender Expressions of Love. Castigated at the time for 1) being students (well, a few of us were) 2) using keyboards (we certainly did) 3) being 'arty' (if only they knew); and 4) for not hanging out enough with the avante-garde brigade (where are they now ?) we endured the taunts and eventually managed to garner quite a following - more by accident than design.\n\nAt the time (1979) the local competition was pretty fierce. The Pop Group were busy working on their 'We're weird, us' act, which was going down jolly well, The Art Objects were starting to motor along nicely, and bands like the Exploding Seagulls, The Spics and The Glaxo Babies were packing 'em in. In such company we were very much 'pigeons in the outfield', but by hanging in gamely we sort-of flourished. In those days Bristol had plenty of places to play, and a DJ was a person who played a few records before (and after) the Real Thing, not someone whose name appeared on the masthead above those of the people who'd actually created the music.\n\nIn the years that followed all manner of low-rent Spinal Tapisms transpired as we slithered up and down the greasy pole that is/was popular music. Sometimes we played great, other times we sounded like an explosion in a roadie's underpants. We wrote and recorded songs that were by turns pathetic, pretentious, presentable and - occasionally - perfect.\n\nOur singles featured in the independent charts and the great Paul Morley trekked down to the sticks to interview us. Suddenly our butts were kissable within the BS postal area, and possibly elsewhere. Cor!\n\nA US tour was offered, and we arrived in New York in August of 1981 just as everyone else was leaving to escape the heat and humidity. Still, we had a laugh (when we weren't fighting with each other) and the Yanks dug us. In the end the fighting overcame the music and we bowed out at the Peppermint Lounge, NYC, never to play live again. The return to Bristol was so depressing that I can recall the horror to this day. Coming back to the same old grind in Thatcher's grey Britain was too much to take, and we knocked it on the head.\n\nAround this time virtually every rock musician in Bristol decamped to London because bands from Bristol just couldn't get arrested, whilst those from cities like Manchester and Liverpool seemed to get signed on the strength of their vowel sounds. We, too, had a crack in the Smoke - rehearsed, did some recording. But the thought of climbing that hill again was just too much, and we let it die for good.\n\nNow the world has caught up with that unique Bristol combination of angst and irony, and hails it as some kind of miracle. Truth is, it was there all along. Whilst Essential Bop embodied much that was indulgent in that so-called 'New wave' era, we did 'give it plenty' and swam against the tide, using a wide variety of strokes. If you were there, all I can say is \"sorry\", but If you weren't you certainly missed something, and if you can remember what it was, please let me know.\n\n(Steve Bush April 2000)\n\n» back to top\n\nEUROPEANS\n\n» EUROPEANS DISCOGRAPHY\n\nJonathan Cole\n\nJon Klein\n\nStephen Street\n\nJames Cole\n\n» See Album Releases\n\nThe biggest selling indie band from Bristol in their time?

You see, I work in this big CD distributor warehouse and just about all I hear all day is death metal and techno. Now I have nothing against either genre per se, but they're just not what I want to hear: they simply don't connect with me. They communicate nothing. As my parents would say, it's just a bunch of noise.\n\nSo I'm driving home from work, wind blowing in my face, blasting out the Pop Group's awesome Y LP when it hits me: I've always loved this record, it's got such a creepy, angry yet liberating vibe. I'm feeling better now, almost inspired. Hell, I'd have to say it's one of the greatest albums ever! Why has practically no-one ever even heard of it? Why do my work colleagues scream in terror when I put it on the stereo in the warehouse?\n\nThe Pop Group are admittedly an acquired taste, yet for those of whom they're the right flavour, they're one of the greatest bands of all time. I first bought Y when I was 20, after years of hearing it being name-dropped incessantly by everyone from the Minutemen to the Birthday Party to Jello Biafra, and it went under my skin instantly like a nasty rash. I mean that as a compliment. I was going through one of my classic uni-student/art-dada/music-terrorist phases at the time (I mean, surely you've experienced that yourself?!), an embarrassing confession, for sure, but the Pop Group was the right music for the right time. They yelled and screamed of injustice and frustration, they spat on the world in disgust, they ranted and raved about Cambodia and The Bomb, and their music was an ungodly, falling-apart mix of dub, Funkadelic, Beefheart and some sort of barely contained dada-esque noise. I was hooked, soon to be obsessed, and whaddya know, here I am 6 years later to tell you about them. So, who were they?\n\nReady information on the Pop Group is scarce, to say the least. I've not once read a comprehensive article on them so I'll just fill in the gaps and tell you what I know. Featuring five youngsters (we're talking high-school kids here) from Bristol, England, they formed in 1978 and fairly quickly rose to semi-fame, to the point where they supported Pere Ubu that very year on their summer tour. Inspired by everything from Rimbaud and Burroughs to Yoko Ono, Ornette, Last Poets, James Brown, Can and John Cage, The Pop Group's main intention was to go beyond the boring stalemate that most British punk at that point had become, to exceed the musical, lyrical and aesthetic cliches of the genre. You could say they were a classic example of a band that was both inspired by, yet in open contempt of, punk rock, or at least what had become of it.\n\nSigning to Radarscope Records in 1979, a fly-by-night label linked up to Warner Brothers, they released their debut 7\", \"She Is Beyond Good and Evil.\" Not the classic it should've been, my advice is to skip the A-side, a dubby, scratchy ode to Nietzsche that sounds a touch too \"new wave\" to these ears and head straight for the flipside, the aptly-titled \"3:38\" (it goes for that long), an excellent Can-ish instrumental that's part aggro-dub and part screaming, belching keyboard effects. Somewhat comparable to This Heat's first LP, it still sounds totally ahead of its time. A tough record to find, but well worth it.\n\nOK, now we're onto their debut LP, Y, once again released on Radarscope and one that was finally given a shamefully belated re-release on CD in 1997. If you can find the original vinyl, which ain't easy, snap it up quick because it comes with an awesome, and mighty huge, collage poster with their lyrics and various chilling images of the time (Cambodians, Vietnam Vets, various UK/Irish atrocities) and the curious front cover featuring an African tribesman with the band name messily scrawled to the side of him is frame-worthy. Before I say anything of this LP, I should say that I hope it's the intention of every band that makes a record that they should make a record like this. By that I don't mean it should sound anything like it, but rather that any truly great album should stand up against the test of time, be capable of being picked up years later by a curious potential fan and bowl them over in the process. Y sounds like a late '70's post-punk record, but it doesn't sound dated; its themes, its rhythms, its sense of anger, despair and frustration are timeless. And no, it's not \"depressing\"; on the contrary the ultimate statement it makes is of a desire to lift its head above the misery it speaks of. From \"Savage Sea\", a creepy violin/piano opus on side A: \"Why should heroes always die in battle. Take the violin, we're exiles\".\n\nI must have listened to this record nearly a thousand times (I've gotta get that CD reissue one day) and I can still say that it sounds unique, no other record possesses such a bizarre sense of paranoia and loathing. What were these young British teenagers thinking when they made it? There are some obvious sonic comparisons, certainly Pere Ubu's Dub Housing LP of the same period comes to mind, as well as the Birthday Party and the Minutemen (two bands very heavily influenced by Y), yet The Pop Group were all over the place: songs stop half-way through like the band made a mistake, then start again, recording levels go up and down, and instruments fade in and out like a musical collage. At times it sounds amateurish, sloppy, like the Shaggs attempting post-punk, but then everything comes together so tightly on classic moments likes the phenomenal \"We Are Time,\" a song which truly rates as the stand-out of the album, a seven-minute anthem of biblical proportions, that you're left wondering why other parts of the record are such a mess. But it works: from the avant-funk of the opening \"Thief of Fire\" to the tribal dub of \"Blood Money\" to the ending coda \"Don't Sell You Dreams\", a Birthday Party-ish scrape'n'drone featuring a very sparse guitar and drum accompanied by singer Mark Stewart's wailing of the title over and over.\n\nYet it's also undoubtedly the lyrics to the record that give it such an edge, an edge that was perhaps lost on their subsequent recordings where their sense of outrage became more literal and straightforward in its sloganeering. There's no clear messages given here, no references to anyone in particular and no real finger-pointing; everything is spoken in riddles like they've arisen from the subconscious. Check \"Thief of Fire\": \"When you're stealing from a nation of killers / Do I trust myself? / I'm like a tramp in a cage / Flowers in Moscow / Losers take all / All lovers betray\". I'm tempted to rip out the \"rock poet\" line of baloney here but I shall refrain. However, if I was to use such a line, this'd be the place. Y is a record few know about. One of the most influential records you've probably never heard in your life.\n\nIf my sense of chronology is correct, I believe the band then moved to Rough Trade and released the classic \"We Are All Prostitutes\" 7\", undoubtedly their finest single moment. I have a few hundred 7\" singles; they're tucked away in a dusty old box and every once in a blue moon I'll have one of those \"singles frenzy\" days where I'll play a whole bunch of them in succession. A lot of those records are real good, of course, but fer chrissakes, who can be bothered with the things and now that I think of it, when was the last time I actually bought a 7\"?! Anyway, not only is this very 7\" the one that I ALWAYS spin on a single-frenzy day, but it also gets the occasional spin just for the hell of it. In fact, I'd say it's the best damn 7\" I own.\n\nBeefing up their sound considerably - and propping up their political mouthpieces even further in the lyrical department - this is three minutes of pure urban angst channelled through a unique blend of punk, jazz, funk and noise. Starting with a wolloping, distorted guitar for the opening verse, it then evolves into a bizarre funk-disco rant before finally falling apart and collapsing into a chaotic stew of yelling, violin and saxophone. The lyrics? Try this on for size:\n\nWe are all prostitutes\n\nEveryone has their price\n\nAnd you too will learn to live the lie\n\nAggression\n\nCompetition\n\nAmbition\n\nConsumer Fascism\n\nCapitalism is the most barbaric of all religions\n\nEtc., etc., you get the idea. Subtle it isn't, but then again it never fails to get me fisting the air like a fool come play time, so the job is done. Once again produced by reggae \"legend\" Dennis Bovell (who also did Y, after an aborted session with John Cale), this li'l sucker clears rooms for all the right reasons. The B-side? Try this for a title: \"Amnesty International Report on British Army Torture of Irish Prisoners\", which of course is about... well, one guess only. Essentially a bong-hit jazz-noise mess with Mark Stewart quoting the very report in question over the top, it annoys yet soothes, though a far superior \"song\" version appears on the We Are Time out-takes LP, and for a bit of trivia, the one and only Mike Watt covered this on some Animal Rights benefit record a coupla years back. Sleeve, lyrics, music, content, effort: all a resounding A+.\n\nUp next for perusal is the For How Much Longer Do We Tolerate Mass Murder? LP in 1980. Many people like this period of the band better. Myself, I like it all, and this era of the band is, I guess, more \"listenable\", as their musicianship tightened up to the point of becoming a fairly white-hot avant-funk-punk outfit sounding a bit like a speed-freak version of Ornette Coleman's Prime Time or James \"Blood\" Ulmer's LP's from the period. The cover denotes a fairly radical change in direction for the band that follows through to their lyrics as well: this time they're pissed off. No more subtleties, no more \"poetry\", the message is direct. If possible, get the limited-edition LP version of this, which comes wrapped in a huge newspaper featuring various clippings on the atrocities of the day. Also available is a non-limited version with only a basic album sleeve (much easier to find, and much cheaper), or if you're lucky you'll stumble across a Japanese CD that also contains their follow-up LP, We Are Time, though I believe that particular item was deleted a few years back.\n\nYou could say this record has a groove; in fact, you could quite easily dance to it. That's my theory. To demonstrate this theory, I once played this at a party at my house a few years ago. Within a couple of songs my brother walked up to me and said, \"What the hell is this? People don't want to hear someone whinging about Cambodia and Third World starvation... put on the Ramones!!\" Point taken. I still say you can dance to it, though lyrically and thematically this is about as \"heavy\" as a record gets. Look at those song titles: \"Forces of Oppression\", \"Feed the Hungry\", \"Justice\", \"Rob a Bank\". Now before you start thinking this is all a little heavy handed and been-there/done-that, think more along the lines of, say, the lyrical populism of the Minutemen or the, dare I say, \"Situationist\"-inspired lyricism of the Gang of Four than the dour humourlessness of Crass and their ilk (no disrespect to Crass, but you know what I mean). For my two cents, it's the music that matters here, and this is definitely their strong point. Gone is the sloppiness and rampant experimentalism of Y to reveal a tight, disciplined unit that punches out their funk like a punked-up James Brown circa 1970 meets Yoko Ono of the same year.\n\nThe musical potpourri contains a mixture of spacious dub (\"There Are No Spectators\"- now what was I saying about Situationism...), collaged tribalism (\"One Out of Many,\" actually an old Last Poets vocal dubbed over a funky mess), raucous Ornette-ish free jazz (\"Communicate\"), anthemic agit-punk (\"Rob a Bank\") and seriously righteous near-disco chant (\"Justice,\" my fave). By this stage the band were playing CND (Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament) rallies and generally heeding the call for revolution in no uncertain terms, and whilst this is all respectable behaviour and their music suffered not one bit (like I said, many people prefer this LP over the first) in the meantime, it's the sense of surrealism of the first LP that I miss. Still, for the record, this may be the best place for newcomers to start as it's the most accessible, song-based collection of tunes they released.\n\nUp next is their split 7\" with the Slits, \"Where There's A Will\", that's right, also from 1980. The Slits you know about: the late '70s all-female punk-dub outfit with John Lydon's stepdaughter (strange but true!) Ari Up on vocals, and their contribution is pretty OK, but let's talk about the Pop Group. By this time Mark Stewart and a few others in the band had hooked up with the Sugarhill Gang in New York, the seminal proto-rap ensemble that would later feature on many an On-U Sound record (as would Stewart), their enthusiasm for what was then considered this strange new transatlantic music shines through with a near hip-hop flavour to the proceedings, though all played on real-time instruments of the bass/gtr/drums variety. Actually, a friend of mine claims that the basic riff from this is taken from an old Grandmaster Flash/Sugarhill Gang song, but whatever the hell, it moves along to a very satisfying beat - anti-conscription words and all - and let's not forget how influential The Pop Group were in incorporating this element into their music, especially in 1980. Only years later with the whole trip-hop phenomanon has the world given The Pop Group their due credit as such innovators. Graced with a nice, and yet again, overtly political sleeve (\"Fight Conscription,\" photos of Middle Eastern terrorists), this Rough Trade-r is a pain in the ass to find, but again, well worth it.\n\nThis is where things get sticky. Exactly when did The Pop Group split up? I've read 1980, 1981 and 1982. I'm pretty sure it was 1981. 1982 seems a bit late: post-Pop Group happenings were going on by then, and since I've read of gigs by the band throughout the year 1981, I'll assume they certainly hadn't split by 1980. All that said, their last effort, their We Are Time LP, from 1981, is considered a posthumous effort and is indeed a grab-bag effort of assorted demo songs and live tracks. Whilst such a description may lend the assumption of unwanted-dogthrowaway material that isn't worth the time of day, such is not the case here.\n\nWe Are Time features various live versions of songs from Y, such as \"Thief of Fire\" and \"We Are Time\" - both of which sound excellent and powerful, especially the latter, which emphasises their most obvious Beefheart/free jazz leanings with sax going mad - several never-released live tracks (\"Genius or Lunatic,\" \"Spanish Inquisition\"), and numerous previously unreleased studio efforts (\"Kiss the Book,\" \"Sense of Purpose,\" \"Trap,\" a different version of \"Amnesty Report,\" all of which are exceptional and worthy in their own right of being released as \"official product\"). Curiously, many of these tracks were recorded in 1978, though they sound vastly different to the sort of material that wound up on their debut LP. Musically, everything moves along in the same direction set by the For How Much Longer... LP: a tight, angular unit steeped in punk, dub, free jazz, funk and Beefheart. Musically, such references have almost become a cliche in this day and age, as every band and their mother go on about their deep love for Miles Davis and Stockhausen and Lee Perry and whoever else, but context is the point here.\n\nThe Pop Group were not following a well-trodden blueprint, they were helping to create it. Sure, there were contemporaries like The Fall and Pere Ubu who were mining similar territory, or obvious roots in their sound like the Last Poets, Ornette Coleman and Red Crayola, but it was their unique synthesis of these influences, coupled with their sense of naivety, commitment and passion that makes The Pop Group still stand out today. There were other exceptional bands of the day that combined radical politics with inventive music, whether it was done in a surreal manner like the Swell Maps or in an overt manner like the Minutemen, and brilliant as both of those bands may've been, there's a certain undecipherable angle to The Pop Group's work. Their lyrics, their sounds, are presented in riddles not merely for the sake of being \"artistic.\" Rather, they beg you to decode them.\n\nDon't call me pain\n\nMy name is mystery\n\nDon't call me pain\n\nThis is the age of chance\n\nDon't call me pain\n\nBeing afraid is power\n\nT-O-R-T-U-R-E\n\n- \"Don't Call Me Pain\" (off the Y LP)\n\nI'm not here to dissect their discography and give a blow-by-blow description of their \"career\". All that is interesting, but it doesn't compare to the unique power that their recordings possess. Some music has a truly mystifying quality, like it was borne from another planet, and no matter how many times you listen to it, whilst it may instantly CONNECT, you still can't sort out the puzzles it presents. What do the cryptic lyrics on the Pop Group's debut LP mean? Why the amateurish cover, huge collaged poster and awesome mess that is the music contained within? I'm no closer to \"figuring out\" The Pop Group than I was when I first heard them. But what is there to resolve? I feel like one of those thousands of kids who'd sit around for hours trying to decipher what Dylan was saying on Highway 61 or Bringing It All Back home back in the '60's.\n\nI saw Dylan play live here earlier this year and he made perfect sense, so maybe if I'd seen The Pop Group live back in 1980, like many others did, on one of those classic post-punk bills featuring the likes of Pere Ubu and Nico, would they make perfect sense to me now? Would they actually hold any fascination for me? Wouldn't I just consider them another one of those cool post-'78 agit-punk bands that was one out of many? Sometimes mystery can be one of the best qualities about a band. Mystery surrounding The Pop Group is becoming less so: now it's been widely written on what a huge influence they were on the \"trip-hop\" scene of Bristol; how guitarist Gareth Sager had a child with Neneh Cherry and his subsequent success with Rip, Rig and Panic; we read of drummer Bruce Smith's long tenure with Public Image Limited; and then we hear of singer Mark Stewart's seminal solo records and his long-time involvement with the On-U stable of artists.\n\nI'm glad they're finally getting some well-earned respect; posthumous noteriety can't \"take them away from me,\" as we often feel when our of our favourite bands gains a wider audience, because their music will always mean so much to me. It's not just the sense of anguish and intensity of their records that's appealing - after all, such feelings are most often the last thing I want to experience when listening to music. I'll leave the constant desire for overwhelmingly \"intense\" sounds up to the death metal/noise crowd; rather, it's the feeling of connecting with other minds. It's literally exactly that: communicating. Maybe I just heard their records at the right time in my life - that's often the case with one's favourite music - but I can honestly say that The Pop Group's music is now permanently implanted in my mind: I can't rid myself of what I've heard. Their music is scorching, unrepeatable, timeless and essential.\n\nDave Lang 1977\n\n» back to top\n\nPRIVATE DICKS\n\nGavin King\n\nPaul Guiver\n\nHuw Davies\n\nMark Seabright\n\nReleased one single and a track on the Avon Calling LP for Heartbeat Records.\n\n» back to top\n\nTHE TRAITORS\n\nMike Carvalho - guitar and vocals\n\nGary Worgan - bass\n\nGary Wintle - drums\n\nThe Traitors from the Gloucester area played fast new wave music and the ska sound of 'Mexico' on 'Bristol Beat - The Stonehouse Tapes 1980' was not representative of the band but perhaps reflected the times, hence its inclusion.

To be fair, this statement isn't entirely untrue, but it is a little misleading. Our singer Beki certainly did form a band called The Contingent long before Vice Squad, but it never got past the rehearsal stage, while the TV Brakes, the first band formed by myself (on drums) and guitarist Dave Bateman, played a lot of local gigs and wrote many of the songs that were later used by Vice Squad.\n\nJust to be contrary, the first Vice Squad recording (with the erstwhile Mark Hambly on bass) is the last track on this CD, \"Nothing\", which appeared on the Heartbeat Records \"Avon Calling\" compilation (Heartbeat HB 1) in 1979.\n\nAfter the success of the Brighton compilation \"Vaultage '78\", regional collections were in vogue, and \"Avon Calling\" sold well, but the best part was that John Peel took a shine to our track and played it to death on his Radio 1 show.\n\nWe had two other strokes of luck in 1979, playing our debut gig as last minute additions to a Rock Against Racism bill at the Bristol University Anson Rooms on 12 April (where Heartbeat boss Simon Edwards spotted us), then supporting The Damned and The Ruts at the Bristol Locarno. These events were a staggering contrast to the TV Brakes days, when we considered ourselves lucky to secure gigs at the local Railway Preservation Society, and even the local Borstal, and meant that we soon picked up a sizeable local following.\n\nThe problem, though, was that most of our new friends verged on the psychopathic, and we were quickly banned from playing most venues in the South West of England. In 1980 we managed just 6 gigs, but at the last of these, another Socialist Workers Party benefit (this time \"Rock Against Thatcher\") Simon Edwards suggested that we join forces and form a new label for our debut single. Dave came up with the name Riot City (after the violent scenes occurring in the St Pauls area of our city, and others around the country), and early 1981 saw the release of \"Last Rockers\" (Riot 1).\n\nI tracked down Sounds journalist Garry Bushell, in a pub near the paper's offices, and he championed the record in its pages, while John Peel again gave us his support, opening his show with it several nights in a row, though he always moaned about Dave's \"irritating\" guitar bit at the end. To our amazement, the initial pressing of 1,500 (which we had thought foolhardy on Simon's part, reckoning 1,000 would have been pushing it) sold out straight away, and \"Last Rockers\" went on to sell over 22,000 copies, reaching No. 7 on the Indie Chart. I don't suppose Rod Stewart was quaking in his snakeskin boots, but that's a lot of records, however you look at it.\n\nEmboldened, we went back to Cave Studios (where \"Last Rockers\" was also recorded) with a new song, \"Resurrection\", which became our second single (Riot 2). This sold roughly the same number of copies as its predecessor, and bettered it on the Indie Chart, reaching the No. 4 spot after entering the chart on 30 May.\n\nThe success of the two singles upped our profile considerably (as today's marketing people would no doubt put it), and resulted in some choice live shows, like a support slot with The Damned at The Lyceum and a short tour with the UK Subs.\n\nSomewhat reluctantly, the other music papers began to take notice of us, and though their coverage was often disparaging, we quickly realised that it didn't really matter what they said, as long as they let people know we were out there. Add to all this a John Peel session, which he repeated several times on his show, and it's not surprising that other record labels were soon sniffing around.\n\nIn the Punk Credibility Stakes, choosing to sign to EMI was a bit of a risk, and we certainly came in for a bit of flak from the Punk purists, but as the Angelic Upstarts and Cockney Rejects were already signed to the label (like us, on the Regal Zonophone imprint), we felt in good company.\n\nOur first recording for EMI was the debut Vice Squad album \"No Cause For Concern\", and it was an unmitigated disaster. Foolishly, under the guidance of our then manager, Ian, we went into a studio whose only merit was that it was cheaper than Cave. The album (ZEM 103) was actually quite successful, reaching No. 32 on the national album chart in October, but the fact that I can't bring myself to include one track from it in this collection should give some indication as to how woeful the finished result actually was.\n\nMore than a little ashamed of ourselves, when EMI suggested that we try their Manchester Square studio for our next recording, the single \"Out Of Reach\", we felt in no position to argue, but if anything, the results of that session were even worse.\n\nFor that reason, the version of \"Out Of Reach\" included here is the one that was recorded for our second album \"Stand Strong Stand Proud\", rather the single version (Z 26) which, ironically, was our only national single chart \"hit\" reaching No. 68 in February 1982.\n\nThe b-side tracks were \"(So) What For The Eighties?\", which is represented here by a far superior four-track demo version recorded just before the Manchester Square session, and \"Sterile\", which is taken from the single as the peculiar mix, which was very heavy on vocals and drums but light on guitar and bass, by a happy accident seemed to suit that song rather well.\n\nTracks 9 - 13 are my favourites from the aforementioned \"Stand Strong Stand Proud\" album (ZEM 104), produced by our new co-manager Sooty, which was slightly preceded by the \"Stand Strong Stand Proud EP\". The EP (Z 30) failed to chart, despite a gushing Single Of The Week review by Steve Keaton in Sounds (the fact that we included four tracks, reducing the volume level to such an extent that it couldn't be played on the radio probably didn't help), but the album entered the national chart on 22 May and rose to No. 47.\n\nWe spent the summer touring Europe, the USA and Canada, before returning to the UK for a month-long tour to promote the \"State Of The Nation EP\" (Z 34) in October. I've included the a-side track \"Citizen\" here, plus one of the b-sides, \"Scarred For Life\".\n\n\"State Of The Nation\" turned out to be our last release with Beki on vocals. She announced her intention to leave the band early in 1983, when preparations for our third album were already well underway, and we were immediately dropped by EMI. They kept Beki on their books for a short while, releasing the first single by her new band Ligotage, then she too was shown the door.\n\nAs you can imagine, these were difficult times for Vice Squad, but we recruited a new vocalist, Lia, Sooty joined the band as second guitarist, and we signed a one-off single deal with Anagram. \"Black Sheep\" (ANA 16) was only really intended to announce the fact that we were still among those present, but to our surprise it sold very well, (helped in no small part by heavy airplay on Radio 1 by DJ David Jensen, and a session on his show) entering the Indie Chart in December and climbing to No. 13.\n\nThis success led to a more long-term deal with Anagram, who released the follow-up single \"You'll Never Know\" (ANA 22) in 1984, not to mention heavy touring around the UK and a memorable trip to Lisbon, Portugal, for a brace of gigs at the newly opened Rock Rendezvous club.\n\nHowever, most of that year was spent recording, at last, our third album, \"Shot Away\" (GRAM 14).\n\nWorking with a small budget, using \"down-time\" at SAM Studios, the album was a long time in the making, but the finished result was everything we had hoped for: a Punk album with a Rock feel that showed we had progressed musically but not lost track of our roots. Well, I think so anyway.\n\nMark left the band roughly halfway through the recording of \"Shot Away\", and was replaced by our friend Jon Chilcott, formerly bassist with The Crazy Trains, who played on the remaining tracks. This led to a little confusion as a track from the album, a cover of The Sweet's \"Teenage Rampage\", was issued as a single (ANA 26) shortly before the album appeared, and Jon's photo was on the cover, though Mark actually played on the song. The single entered the Indie chart in January 1985, and reached the No. 44 slot. To our chagrin, \"Shot Away\" failed to chart, though Spike Sommer awarded it five stars in the 2 February issue of Sounds, concluding his review with the pleasing, if ungrammatical words, \"Five stars is not enough\". It made little difference, though, as by then Vice Squad were no more, and Dave, Jon & I had already launched a new band, Sweet Revenge. But that's another story.\n\nTracks 16-24 on this CD include all the Vice Squad #2 singles, plus the best b-sides and my (admittedly biased) favourites from \"Shot Away\".\n\nTo conclude: It was hardly a bed of roses, being in Vice Squad, but I wouldn't have missed it for the world, and I think we knocked out some pretty good stuff along the way.\n\n(Shane Baldwin April 2000)\n\n» back to top\n\nVIOLENT BLUE\n\nNeil Taylor\n\nCharlie Jones\n\nPhil Andrews\n\nTony Heyes\n\nNeil and Charlie were signed to Magnet Records, released one single and faded.

But luck has been one of the ingredients in their recipe as they have been aided by the more solid pre-requisites of good material, instrumental competence, hard work and diligent management, the latter now provided by Recreational Records supremo, Chris Parker.\n\nTalisman have moved on to that crucial stage where finally day-jobs have been given up and a professional status attained - the step forwards where there can be no looking back. It's taken them two years to come to this situation and it's not always been a smooth journey. Progress was interrupted by Bill Bartlett's decision to leave the band, and his replacement on keyboards, Chris Potter, is an interesting example of the YOP scheme ultimately finding an unemployed young person a full-time job. Chris was previously involved in the 'Freedom City' production, which was funded by the Manpower Services Commission and has toured all over the country. His recruitment retains the one-third white two-thirds black balance of personnel, a feature which created some eye-brow raising from some quarters in Talisman's earlier days.\n\nBassist Dennis explained that: 'When the band first started and we had Brendan and Bill, people in St Pauls were saying 'why have you got white guys in the band?' and between us in the band there was a period of non-communication. We would just play without trying to come together, but as we got to know each other the magic worked through.'\n\nBrendan: 'Now the black and white thing doesn't come into it. We just think of each other as being in the situation where we HAVE to work together - as musicians and as people. We have a good time together and it seems to flow quite well.'\n\nWithin the potent hubbub of Talisman's music they mix a range of styles. I hear a Carlos Santana feel to Leroy's liquid lead licks, complementing the wailing sound of Brendan's sax and harmonica punctuations, and a fluid jazzy inflection to some of the bass/rhythm unison phrasing. The basis of the music is very firmly in a reggae mould, but with lots of flexibility and space between the instruments. The rhythms are varied, broken down and reassembled, with the drums and guitars weaving in and out of each other, and the keyboards and sax providing the richer tone of colours. This approach is accentuated by the visual aspect of the set; Brendan and Chris flanking the three front men, while Donald stays hidden behind his drums driving the music ever FORWARD. When we were discussing how the groups direction developed there was some disagreement between Desmond and Dennis about this process.\n\n'There was a lot of conflict at first about what we were doing,' said Desmond, 'and whether it was right and I don't know how we overcame that.' But as far as Dennis was concerned 'it just happened that we wanted to play something different. We didn't strive to play JA reggae and I'm glad we didn't because I think now we're in the forefront of what we are doing in England.' In terms of the 'new wave' of Brit-reggae? Dennis again: 'Yes. We didn't know if black people would accept it as it was up-tempo, and then there was also the way we play our music, with the voices jumping in and out and the bass and drums doing the things they do.'\n\nBrendan took up the point: 'We didn't know how well it was going to be received or what was going to happen, but now we find ourselves going off to festivals and gigs and people have heard us on the radio and come and see us. We're now strong enough and mature enough in the band to make an impression the first time we play somewhere. People don't realise of course the background work that's gone into putting us where we are now.'\n\nTalisman have managed to overcome the perennial problem for Bristol bands: getting some attention from record company and music press personnel, in the right places, especially of course London. Matters have not moved as quickly as perhaps they would have liked but the group are quite happy for the moment with their relation with Recreational. 'It's possible that our first single 'Dole Age' would have sold more if we had been with somebody bigger,' said Brendan, 'as it would have got wider promotion. As it was it sold 5000 copies so we're pleased with that all things considered. But the fact that Chris Parker has been involved with us from the start, and is WITH us, is very important. In spite of the problems we've been getting nation-wide publicity through TV and we've played all round the country supporting some big names.' (It might be added too that another useful aid will be Talisman's appearance on HTV's new 'Jangles' show starting in February, where the band will be performing 'Nitty Gritty')\n\nInterest has certainly been stirring in the A & R departments, but another factor urging caution and patience from the band is the way in which British reggae bands have tended to be treated by record companies. Dennis is quite emphatic about where Talisman stand on this question and what they are looking for.\n\n'They (companies) are waiting to see what kind of deal they can get. For us it can't be something like Steel Pulse or The Regulars got because in the end they got nothing. They were just taken on, signed up and nothing was done for reggae music. We actually want something done for the MUSIC, and we're not just in it for the money. We want reggae pushed out and say: yeah! The black music in this country has got a standing now. None of the guys in the business is willing to stand up and be the first person to put some bread behind that. That's why I think public demand will bring us up as we're the first kind of band who are generating that kind of wider feed-back, considering the music we play, unlike say Steel Pulse, Black Slate or even Aswad.\n\nIt's this forthright and determined attitude which spills over into the content of the songs, and has caused some misinterpretations from the likes of the BBC. Brendan explained that they considered 'Wicked Dem' to be unsuitable for radio broadcasting, when they were about to record their session for the Richard Skinner programme. 'They'd checked it out and told us that it was anti-police, which was wrong as it's against authority when exercised arbitrarily for the sake of it.' Perhaps the Beeb were being sensitive in the light of the summer riots but happily the song was recorded for a Peel session. More likely they were put off by the 'live' presentation of the song when the noose that Dennis wears on stage is used to illustrate the injustices which 'Wicked Dem' highlights. But then they might understand better.\n\nMany of Talisman's songs do convey strong feelings, like 'Dole Age' and 'Free Speech', or personal emotions in 'I A'int', and Desmond, as chief lyricist, pointed out in the recent repeat of the BBC West documentary on the band, 'I have a message and the only way I can get it out is to write. Society isn't free and although we're told it is, the reality is different. We're governed by laws telling us what we can and cannot do, can or cannot say and I want real free speech. You have to keep making compromises. You can never go out and say exactly what you feel. That's what 'Free Speech' is all about, without pointing any fingers or calling any names. It's telling people what you feel about what's going on but in a SUBTLE way.'\n\nI quite like too the positive maxims which Dennis mentioned were his by-words. He regards his role as 'trying to communicate, while others try to exterminate', and his message for politicians, and the Home Secretary, in the light of Brixton, Toxteth and Scarman is crystal-clear:\n\n'Hey Mr Whitelaw, tell us your plan,\n\nDo you see a future for the black man?\n\nI see politicians playing a dangerous game\n\nSo put your house in order and we'll do the same.'\n\nIt's been precisely that kind of 'problem' area, like St Pauls, that Des and Denn have lived in or near. They are well aware of the problems that community face and also the progressively harder struggle for black musicians in particular, to establish, build up and maintain a band: the lack of rehearsal space, and equally important, the lack of a focus of the sort of clubs like Bamboo and Blue Lagoon, closed down in the last few years, used to provide. But in spite of the odds stacked against them, it's encouraging that Talisman (and Black Roots) have been able to become significant forces in the current reggae outfits pushing out.\n\nOf the two it's probably Talisman who have the greater commercial potential; certainly they have an easier field for 'cross-over' both in terms of content and stance. Their audience is as mixed as their line-up and it's a rare occasion that those at their gigs can stay rooted in their chairs. The maxim which Brendan applies invariably comes true: everyone leaves a Talisman gig with a smile on their face. And Denn's experience of reaction is even more graphic. 'One girl came up to me after a gig and said - you know, you make me sweat!'\n\nInterview by Dave Massey (Taken from his Future Days Fanzine)\n\n» back to top\n\nGLAXO BABIES\n\nGeoff Alsopp\n\nDan Katsis\n\nRob Chapman\n\nTom Nichols\n\nTony Wrafter\n\nDREAMS INTERRUPTED.\n\nIn the Autumn of 1977 both Sounds and NME ran free Musicians Wanted ads. I placed an ad in both which read 'Musicans wanted to take over where the Velvet Underground left off.' It wasn't meant to be presumptuous. If I'd placed the same ad six or seven years later it would have attracted a bunch of Jesus & Mary Chain copyists. If I placed the same ad now, god knows who it would attract. People who want to make music for car ads perhaps. But in 1977 it was a way of attracting like minded individuals from those select few who knew, and cared, who the Velvet Underground were.\n\nThe Glaxobabies with Simon Edwards (Head of Heartbeat Records).\n\nAnd it worked. A handwritten letter from Tom Nichols arrived in the post, inviting me down to the Dockland Settlement in City Road, St Pauls to check out his band. The Docklands was only five minutes walk from where I lived in Montpelier. It was a youth club during the week and on saturday nights they had bands on and a reggae disco. I'd seen the Stranglers there a couple of years earlier when they all had long hair. I'd danced to Uptown Top Ranking there six months before it was in the charts. The Docklands was a cool place.\n\nThey had a rehearsal room for hire upstairs and on a cold November night in 1977 I walked in and there in one corner of this vast unheated room stood Tom Nichols and Dan Catsis, a bass amp and a guitar amp. 'We've got one that goes like this' they said. 'And one that goes like this' And so on, as they proceeded to play these angular little sketches to me. Some lasted three or four minutes. Some no more than 30 seconds.\n\nThe Glaxobabies with Simon Edwards\n\n(Head of Heartbeat Records).\n\nThey seemed a bit reserved and self conscious as they ran through the material. Dan, intense and hunched and fresh out of art school. Tom, tall and aloof and fresh out of school. I thought they were fucking magnificent. Half of it sounded like Trout Mask Replica and I knew straight away that I'd found my Magic Band.\n\nThey didn't even ask me to sing. With my suedehead crop and my long leather Superfly/Shaft coat (or my SS coat as Dan interpreted it) they thought I looked the part. I asked where the drummer was. 'He hasn't turned up' they said. Drummers and time keeping, eh?\n\nDownstairs in the bar they weren't half as intense as first impressions had suggested. Ice was broken. Drinks were drunk. We spent half an hour pissing ourselves as we recalled old Monty Python sketches and agreed that the series they made without John Cleese was brilliant.\n\nDan explained that the band name came from these ads he'd xeroxed while at art college. Gl*xo made baby milk powder, the stuff you're weaned onto after mothers milk, or sometimes the stuff you were on instead of mothers milk. The caption under the photo of a smiling child said 'smiling one year old Gl*xo baby'. When you xerox a xerox of a xeroxed xerox you end up with a very distorted image and after a while he'd created this grotesque facsimile of a child, but underneath it still said 'smiling one year old Gl*xo Baby. The juxtaposition appealed to me immediately.\n\nThree weeks later we had our first gig, someones Christmas party at, appropriately enough, the Docklands. This was a bit of a bummer as The Hamsters (aka the Sex Pistols) were supposed to be playing at the Bamboo Club in St Pauls that same night as part of their secret tour, and I'd fancied seeing that. But as chance would have it the club mysteriously burned down the night before the gig, as clubs often mysteriously do.\n\nFor the Docklands gig we hastily assembled a rudimentary set of eight songs, including a couple of Beatles and Stones covers. Toms Mum had rather fetchingly sewn the name of the band into the back of his jacket, Rubettes stylee. It was all very homespun and raw. Afterwards, me and Dan went back to my flat and stayed up all night on amphetamine sulphate talking about how great we were.\n\nWe continued to rehearse at the Docklands and played our second gig at this notoriously hardcore punk venue called the BQ club. About 50 safety pinned clone-punks stood and watched us in grudgeful silence. Hardly anyone clapped. Some surly anthropoid at the side of the stage kept unplugging us, so the sound went off every five minutes. We were just glad to get out of there without getting our heads kicked in - or electrocuted. A year later people started coming up to us at gigs, saying 'saw you at the BQ club. You were great.' Half of them added 'we thought you were really heavy. Really intense.'\n\nI suppose we were. We were fairly isolated from the 'scene' at first. We didn't really know anybody. Tom knew some of the Clifton crowd, an amiable Cortina or two, and later on when we got more 'accepted' it was nice to go round their houses after we got back from the pub. They all had trendy middle class parents, that Clifton lot, none of whom minded you skinning up in their pine kitchens. But initially we were outcasts and that was our strength. A rumour went round in the early days about all the warring and bitchy factions in the Bristol music scene. You know the sort of thing. 'What about band A?' 'Oh, they hate band B?' 'What about band C?' 'They hate band D'. 'What about the Gl*xo Babies' 'Oh, they hate everybody.' We didn't, we just didn't know anyone, but we were happy to indulge the myth. We weren't part of any clique. That's why we didn't sound like anybody else.\n\nGlaxos at Ashton Court\n\nIn March 1978 we played our third gig at Redland Teacher Training College, supporting The Only Ones. It was our most prestigious gig to date and the place was packed. The Only Ones guitarist John Perry came up to us afterwards and said he thought we were really good. That gave us a kind of validation and confidence. We didn't really know if we were any good or not. We knew we were different though. When we played that night, half the room immediately drifted off to the bar and half the room came straight down to the front. That tended to happen a lot when we played.\n\nAround this time Tom found us this amazing rehearsal space in a cave cut deep into the Avon gorge. You reached it through a series of headbumping kneegrazing unlit tunnels with water dripping down and stalactites and shit. Ok I made the bit up about the stalactites, but it was a truly unique environment to work in, warm and womb like and soundproofed to the nth. We started rehearsing there three nights a week. That's when we started to get really fucking good.\n\nIn the entire time we were together we only played about half a dozen gigs outside Bristol, and only twice in London. One of these was at the Rock Garden in Covent Garden in the summer of 1978 supporting a group called Resistance, a nice bunch of lads with a sharp pushy manager. We were terrible. Three of us took too much sulphate before we went on. Me and Tom spent most of the set rigid with speed blam, with our backs to the audience. Dan, being the only together one that night, was deeply embarrassed cos loads of his old art school mates had turned up to see us and we sucked big time.\n\nWe slouched off back to Bristol with our tails - and our half chewed lips - between our legs. Initially there had been talk of us doing two gigs at the Rock Garden with Resistance, but we assumed that they wouldn't want us back for the return date. A couple of months later we get a phone call from the band. 'Er, where were you last night? Did you forget the gig?' They thought we were great and wondered why we hadn't shown up. That was us all over. Still riddled with doubt. We knew we were different but we still weren't sure if we were any good.\n\nWe also played the Ashton Court Free Festival that summer. We were first on the bill, saturday lunchtime. Our performance that day seems to have gone down in Bristol punk legend. All I can remember though was gazing out through my blue tinted mirror shades at a field full of disinterested hippies. That evening, however, we played one of the most bizarre gigs of our lives.\n\nOur drumer Geoff Alsopp had got us a gig in a pub out in the badlands of Kingswood where he lived. The hours between our lunchtime performance at Ashton Court and the evening gig were filled with hedonistic excess of monumental proportion. You know that Dennis Leary sketch? 'Lets get an eightball. It'll last all weekend. An hour later. Same four guys. Letsgetanothereightball. Letsgetanothereightball'. That was us that saturday. I think three seperate trips were made from the outskirts of Bristol back to drug central in Ashley Road to satisfy our fighter pilot cravings. Now, throw a room full of Bristol Rovers football thugs and an aggrieved pub landlord into the mix and you have the makings of something very combustible. Altamont on cider. We got our heads down and played our avant-weird music for 45 minutes while some increasingly volatile football hoolies harrassed our girlfriends and threw bottle tops and beer at us. Relieved to have got through the set we headed for the bar, where the landlord told us in no uncertain terms that we were 'contracted' to play for 90 minutes. Reluctantly returning to the stage the Rovers fans resumed their beligerent touching up of our girlfriends while snarling 'eer, play some Pistols, play some Clash' at us.\n\nSo that's what we did. We bluffed our jittery amphetamined way through approximations of White Riot, Pretty Vacant, Janie Jones, and anything else that we could half remember from the Pistols-Clash songbook. And they fucking loved it! A truce was declared the moment we went into White Riot. Mass pogoing broke out. Some of them even bought us drink afterwards. I can't be sure but they may even have stopped trying to tit up our girlfriends.\n\nWe played several gigs like that. Gigs that are about as far from the official punk blueprint as you can get. On another of the few occasions we ventured out of Bristol we played the annual barn dance in a Gloucestershire village called Iron Acton. The stage was on a 12ft high raised platform in a huge shed that smelt of stale cows milk and sileage. The clientile seemed to consist of everyone who lived within a 20 mile radius. Local dignitaries, well dressed ladies trailing their best evening gowns through the farmyard mud, rural bikers, children. A very English scene.\n\nThe promoter, I kid you not, thought that 'new wave' was country music and had booked us and a clutch of other spikey haired malcontents on that very premise. No one seemed to mind. The bands were just a sideshow anyway, no more or less important than the hog-roast or the draw for the raffle. I remember about half an hour before we played we were sitting in a quiet adjacent meadow, discretely enjoying a pre-gig spliff or two, when Tom said 'it feels strange to be sitting here like this, when in half an hour we'll all be going (approximates gl*xo style noise) nah-nah-nah-nah-nah.' And as we gazed at the idyllic splendour of the rolling Gloucestershire hills it did sum up the incongruity of the situation. But Toms opposite observation still couldn't match the surrealism of the gig itself. The TV show Tiswas was very big at the time, and about halfway through our performance I gazed down from the raised stage to see an entire chapter of rural bikers doing the 'Dying Fly' on the floor below. For the unacquainted, the dying fly was a dance popularised by Tiswas where you basically lay on your back and waved your arms and legs in an approximation of the actions of, er, a dying fly.\n\nI don't know if you were expecting lots more stories by this stage about us hanging about backstage with Pere Ubu, or sitting around deciphering Wire lyrics, but believe me you have not lived until you have played your music in a cow shed full of rural bikers who are all doing the dying fly!\n\nWhen our modicum of success came it came very quickly. We went from zeroes to ones in a matter of months. We'd heard on the grapevine that one local promoter had dismissed us with the words 'who'd want to write a song about a **** like Bruce Lee?', so it came as a welcome surprise when in December 1978 Simon Edwards asked us to demo some tracks for him. We ran through the four songs that eventually appeared on the This Is Your Life EP, plus Avoiding The Issue. Dan was a tad detached and uninspired that night and I had an excrutiating stomach bug which necessitated crouching in foetal agony between every number, but Simon still liked what he heard anyway. Within a couple of months we were recording our first EP at Crescent Studios in Bath. I remember Geoff pointing out the exact spot where Eddie Cochran had been killed on the way there. By March 1979 we had an indie chart number one (although this was in the days before there was proper documentation of such things so you won't find verification of that fact in any punk encyclopedia or chart file. How very Gl*xo!)\n\nWithin weeks we'd done a Peel session, played the John Peel roadshow at Bristol Polytechnic (possibly our best ever gig) and wiped the floor with the Human League at The Anson Rooms and Adam and The Ants at Salisbury Art College. Although still a couple of years away from his warpainted pop-star prime Adam was already a star in his own head. I recall that he had his own dressing room even then and his band spent so long preening their way through the soundcheck that we were deprived of one. We were also ordered to play for 20 minutes maximum! By then it had become a bit of a speciality of ours to wipe the floor with headlining acts who had pulled rank or pissed us off mightily and that night we played the angriest most intense 20 minutes of music we'd ever come up with. We returned to our dressing room to find a couple of members of The Ants entourage' sniffing glue out of crisp packets. How terribly punk.\n\nAlthough we'd formed during the punk era, and were all partial to the odd bit of new wave noise, none of us were that enamoured with its overall agenda. We were of that scene but not in it. We didn't sound particularly punky, the reference points in our song lyrics were not in the least bit punky. And I'm pretty sure that no other band had a guitarist who was prone to playing the guitar with a vibrator! The posters and flyers that Dan individually designed for our gigs, and which we discretely pasted around Clifton, St Pauls and Montpelier in the dead of night, didn't look like anyone elses. We all despised the orthodoxy and aparthied that punk rapidly engendeared. A couple of memory flashbacks to illustrate the point; one day early in 1978 I went round to Dans flat and as I walked up the stairs I could hear music playing. You could usually hear music playing when you went round to Dans flat. One day it might be Chrome or Throbbing Gristle. Another day it might be some Vietnamese folk anthology he had borrowed from Central Library. On this occasion though I was assaulted by the unmistakeable strains of The Edgar Broughton Bands' Wasa Wasa, a record I probably hadn't heard for 7 or 8 years. 'Far out' I exclaimed sincerely and unironically as I walked in the room. (We didn't have irony in those days, at least not the corrosive last-refuge-of-the-intellectually-bankrupt irony you get now. We meant everything we said, maaaan!) It wasn't the done thing to be be listening to The Edgar Broughton Band in 1978, and it certainly wasn't the done thing to be saying 'Far Out.' Not in public anyway.\n\nSimilarly a few months later we were in the pub after a Cave rehearsal when Chic's Le Freak came on the jukebox. I spotted Toms foot tapping under the table and we began this hushed almost surreptitious conversation about the virtues of Rogers and Edwards immaculate stripped down funk. 'I didn't like that yowsah yowsah one but this is great.' 'Yeah, listen to that bass.' It seemed absurd that we should be having this clandestine whispered conversation in case some mohair-clad twat might overhear us and use it as evidence as crimes against the new wave, but that's how things were a bit.\n\nIn the early days we had a seige mentality that shored us up against those kind of people and that kind of thinking. That all started to change once we had a record out. People who wouldn't deign to speak to us before now wanted to make our acquaintance and be on our guest lists. Indeed a 1980 compilation of those early Heartbeat demo's and other Gl*xo miscellany was called Put Me On The Guest List, after a gig at Tiffany's in Bristol where, disgusted by the room full of freeloaders and liggers who seemed to make up half the audience, I'd changed the lyrics of Who Killed Bruce Lee from'put me in the picture' to 'put me on the guest list'.\n\nFor a while after the EP release we carried on in our own sweet isolated way. Sounds sent a local hack called Rab to interview us (our one and only encounter with the national music press.) Airey Neave had been blown up in the House of Commons Car Park by the IRA that very afternoon and me and Dan spent most of the interview discussing that instead of answering Rab's questions. Meanwhile Tom spent much of the interview cross-questioning me on the meaning of my lyrics. In one respect this was typical of our self-analytical approach. On the other hand it was a portent of things to come. Within a matter of month the original incarnation of the band was dead and buried.\n\nFirst of all our original drummer, Geoff Alsopp was sacked. Not so much for musical differences as personal ones. Geoff was a bit of a veteran on the Bristol music scene - god, thinking back on it he must have been at least 28 years old! - he wore a defiantly un new-wave beard, had played in everything from pub bands to country bands and had a telepathic understanding with Tom. That's why our rythmn section was so shit hot. He could also roll a very quick and potent joint, especially when using someone elses stash! Unfortunately some of his friends were nobheads. The nadir was reached during a seemingly endless van journey back to Bristol after a gig at Dingwalls, when we had to keep stopping the van every 20 minutes to let one of his beer monster mates puke out of the window. It sounds trivial from a distance but when you've been in close creative proximity for the best part of 16 months these things start to stack up.\n\nTom's Dad had opened a record shop by this time, the snappily named Geoff Nichols Music, and we'd started hanging out in there all day. Tom helping out behind the counter. Me and Dan scouring the second hand racks and depriving legitimate customers from using the turntable. After a long prolonged 'you do it' 'no, you do it' conversation it was left to me to do the dirty deed and pick up the phone to tell our drummer his services were no longer required. 'I'd been sort of expecting it' was Geoff's sanguine reply. Within a month I'd be on the recieving end of a similar phone call.\n\nFrom hereon in it get personal and I'd better prefix the rest of this story with a huge 'the following account does not necessarily reflect of the views of the rest of the band' disclaimer, scrawled in 36 point lettering. In blood. The demise of the original Gl*xo's was largely a result of a massive ideological rift that developed between me and Tom. He was becoming increasingly disenchanted with what he percieved as the nihilistic content of some of my songs. For my part I perceived a certain 'sniff of the barmaids apron' approach to jazz developing within the unit. I was and still am vehemently opposed to this tendency, and detested the way it spread like a rash through post-punk music in the late seventies and early eighties. Jazz is a life long apprenticeship, not a stylistic indulgence and I thought our strengths as a band lay elsewhere. My days were clearly numbered.\n\nThe widening rift between me and Tom culminated with me walking out on the band after the first recording session of what should have been our debut LP. The circumstances of this have been a huge source of regret and hair shirt donning over the years, particularly between me and Dan, who both came to realise rather late in the day that neither of us had ever subsequently found such a satisfying working relationship. The amount of times I'd say 'I've got this lyric that goes like this' and Dan would say 'I've got this tune that goes like this' - and they'd fit! - was uncanny.\n\nThe whole situation seems doubly regrettable with hindsight, because during those early summer months of 1979 we were really starting to cook as a band. Our new drummer Charlie Llewellyn, who had previously been in Gardez Darkx, pleased us immensely when, at his first rehearsal, we asked him to 'play like Neu' and he locked effortlessly into that primitive motorik pulse that was one of our guiding principles.\n\nWe also acquired the services of a sax player around this time. Tony Wrafter had previously been in a band called Peru. Indeed, as Tony himself sheepishly recalled, they were one of those bands who had pissed us off by pulling rank when we were accidentally double booked for a gig at the Stonehouse pub. 'We've played Bath' they said, settling matters once and for all as to who should headline. We touched our forelocks and dutifully blew them off stage. Again, this gig seems to have gone down in Gl*xo folklore, partly because I smashed a wine glass while we were performing and finished the set covered in blood. It wasn't intentional self-laceration of the Iggy Pop or Julian Cope variety. I was just so intensely wrapped up in the performance, and numbed with Totterdown bikers bathtub speed, that I forgot I was clenching the glass in the first place. Didn't feel a thing\n\n'Have you noticed' observed Dan, at some point during this period, 'how most groups start off with a small set and add more and more songs as they go along? We seem to have less and less.' And it was true. In the early days we had anything up to 17 songs in the set. Now we had it down to about six, all of which lasted 8 to 10 minutes. We were turning into Can!\n\nGeoff Alsopps last session with us had been in May 1979 when we appeared on a local BBC West TV show called RPM. We were asked to perform the four songs off our EP and in order to accomplish this complex task we were required to 'rehearse' all morning, and then ponce around all afternoon in front of a stage set straight out of The Lulu Show, circa 1969, while a hairy chested producer in an open denim shirt impressed us with his fake sincerity, a floor manager fed us really naff stage instructions, and bored and jaded technicians halted proceeding every two minutes because camera five had zoomed when it should have panned, or whatever. We got word that up in the control room they were hating us. The feeling was mutual. In fact such was the dispiriting effect of having to play our entire bloody EP a dozen times in one day that we immediately dropped it from our set. By the summer of 1979 our live set consisted of Burning, Flesh, (which had both been there in one form or another since the very first gig) an increasingly dub reggaefied version of Bruce Lee, It's Irrational, She Went To Pieces, and a new song called Christine Keeler (which had made its first spontaneous appearance in entirely ad-libbed form as our third encore at the John Peel Roadshow gig.)\n\nHanging out in Geoff Nichols Music one day, I answered the phone. It was some agent guy. 'God, you people are hard to get hold of. I've been trying to track you down for ages' said this exasperated voice. 'Would you like to play some gigs with the bands I represent?' 'Maybe. Who you got?' I replied.\n\n'The Leighton Buzzards?'\n\n'Er, no thanks.'\n\n'The Cure?'\n\nCups phone.\n\n'What do we think about the Cure?'\n\nAgreeable nods all round. Killing An Arab had just come out. We were partial to a bit of rock and roll Camus.\n\n'Yeah, we'll play with the Cure'.\n\nSo we played with the Cure in Cheltenham. It turned out to be our penultimate gig. Me and Tom argued in the back of the van all the way there. We played a stonker of a set though and as we sat in our dressing room afterwards two unassuming young guys dressed in black hesitantly hung around the door and told us they thought we were great before nervously melting away into the throng. We assumed they were fans.\n\nHaving never seen the Cure we went out to watch the main act. The two unassuming guys in black were Robert Smith and Lol Tolhurst.\n\nOn June 25th 1979 we went into Crescent Studios to begin recording our debut LP with the ideological differences between me and Tom still unresolved. It was as depressing an occasion as I can ever remember. The band improvised away happily while I sat around like a spare part, waiting to sing some of our songs. During a break in proceedings me and Tom were sitting in the lobby and started arguing again about the bands musical direction. I clearly remember seeing Tony out of the corner of my eye, scurrying off up the stairs to tell the rest of the band that it had all kicked off again.\n\nSomehow in the middle of all this we managed to fit in a version of Christine Keeler. It was nothing more than a token run through to appease me, and I cocked up my diction in a couple of places ('hopening and closing the same old doors' indeed!) Tony played some blinding sax on it though and a few months later it was Record Mirrors Single Of The Week. But by then there wasn't a band to promote it.\n\nThe day after the session I phoned Tom in vaguely conciliatory mood to see if there was anything we could do to patch things up. I had the early Pink Floyd in mind and cited it as an example. Syds songs coupled with long exploratory improvisations. 'We're not compromising' said Tom. And that was that.\n\nA few months later I picked up a fanzine in Rough Trade called Allied Propaganda and was walking along Portobello Road reading it. The Gl*xo's album Nine Months To The Disco had just come out and there was an interview with the band. 'Rob was a good guy' Tom said. 'but he was into songs and we werent'\n\nThey'd put inverted comma's around songs'.\n\nI hope you enjoy these songs. I hope you enjoy all of it. We all did. For a while.\n\nRob Chapman January 2006\n\n(Text is taken from the sleeve notes of the Glaxobabies album 'DREAMS INTERRUPTED' - www.heartbeat-productions.co.uk)\n\n» back to top\n\nTHE DIRECTORS\n\nDave Masters\n\nRichard Jacobs\n\nMark Roberts\n\nJohn Simpson\n\nRecorded one track for the Avon Calling LP.\n\n» back to top\n\nSNEAK PREVIEW\n\n» SNEAK PREVIEW DISCOGRAPHY\n\nNeil Taylor\n\nJimmer\n\nEmbrain\n\nLyndon Parry\n\nRecorded one track for the Avon Calling LP.

When they played with us (which they often did at venues as diverse as The Stonehouse and Trinity Church) I usually enjoyed their set more than ours. They were - I suppose - a bit like Bristol's equivalent of The Ramones. A rockin' unit with an advanced sense of irony. Such qualities probably made them unfashionable with Bristol's 'rocknoscenti' of the day, most of whom were trying to sound like bad copies of Albert Ayler (and - unfortunately - succeeding), but this only made me like them more. Listen to the guitar solo in 'Countdown' - wowee! It lifts my wig to this day.

The band Graduate formed in 1979 in Bath. Early on in its existence the line up consisted of guitarist and keyboardist Roland Orzabal, guitarist and singer John Baker, flautist and keyboardist Steve Buck, drummer Andy Marsden, and Curt Smith on the synthesizers and bass. These artists actually picked the name for their group from a film by the same name. It seemed a fitting choice seeing as how they opened each ach with a cover song from the movie.\n\nThe Graduate members did the normal local club circuit gigs, growing a fan base and improving as they went. Soon the band moved on from the club scene to national touring, opening for other acts. In 1980, only a year after joining forces, the guys recorded a debut album, Acting my Age, under the Precision Records label. There were more tours after the album, giving the band a chance to make new fans in a number of countries, but real success and popularity stayed just out of reach.\n\nThe members went back to work in the recording studio in 1981. A number of demo tracks were recorded for a sophomore album that was to be titled Ambition, but the finish product never came to be. Two decades later the debut album was released again, with the bounce added of those demos, including \"Oh U Boys,\"'' \"I See Through You,\" \"Premature Baby,\" \"Happens So Fast,\" \"Christ Look Upon Us,\" \"Think Of Me,\" and \"Only The Best.\"\n\nA short two years after the birth of the Graduate, things came to a sudden end. The guys moved on to other musical endeavors though. Smith and Orzabal started a new group, the above mentioned Tears for Fears, and landed a contract with Mercury Records.\n\nGraduate 'Ever Met A Day'\n\nGraduate 'Live Shots for RPM'\n\n» back to top\n\nCREATURE BEAT\n\n» CREATURE BEAT DISCOGRAPHY\n\nMathew James\n\nSimon James\n\nAndrew Andrews\n\nJim Winstone\n\nNigel Harrison\n\nNew Wave band who released one single on their own label.\n\n» back to top\n\nTHE TOYS\n\nTony Curtis\n\nChris Hawkins\n\nReg\n\nRichard Dawson\n\nNew Wave band who released one single on their own label.\n\n» back to top\n\nChaos UK\n\nChaos UK are an English hardcore punk band formed in 1979 in Portishead,near Bristol. They played fast sloppy hardcore punk rock initially. Consisting of Simon on vocals Andy on guitar Kaos on bass and Potts on drums (although they have been through many different line ups over the years with Kaos and Gabba as the only consistent members). Their lyrics deal with topics such as unemployment, economic recession, drinking, killing babies, distrust of government, the police, and authority in general.\n\nIn their 20 year career Chaos UK toured the world (including a Japanese tour which produced the Live in Japan album) played with bands such as Napalm Death, Corrupted Ideals, Final Conflict, Extreme Noise Terror, Oi Polloi, The Exploited, Swinging Utters, Misery, and many others. They also released over 20 LPs, EPs, Singles, Splits, and live albums.\n\nReleases\n\n• Demo (1981)\n\n• Burning Britain E.P. 7\" (Riot City.
