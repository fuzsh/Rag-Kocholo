The pair renewed their friendship several years later, bumping into Jagger who was holding several blues records which revealed a mutual interest in the blues.\n\nThey named The Rolling Stones after a Muddy Waters song, and began playing covers of their favourite blues tracks.\n\nWhat are the Rolling Stones biggest songs?\n\n- '(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction'\n\n- 'Jumpin' Jack Flash'\n\n- 'Paint It Black'\n\n- 'You Can't Always Get What You Want'\n\n- 'Sympathy For The Devil'\n\n- 'It's Only Rock 'n' Roll (But I Like It)'\n\n- 'Start Me Up'\n\n- 'Gimme Shelter'\n\n- 'Miss You'\n\n- 'Brown Sugar'\n\nIs Keith Richards married?\n\nKeith Richards is married to former model and actress Patti Hansen. They were married in 1983 on Richards' 40th birthday, and remain married to this day.\n\nIt was the only time Richards has been married, despite being in a relationship with style icon and 'It Girl' Anita Pallenberg between 1967 and 1979.\n\nDoes Keith Richards have any children?\n\nKeith Richards had two children, Marlon Leon Sundeep Richards and Dandelion Angela Richards, with Anita Pallenberg. He also has two daughters with Hansen, Theodora Dupree Richards and Alexandra Nicole Richards.\n\nWhen Richards was in a relationship with Anita Pallenberg, they sadly lost their son Tara Jo Jo Gunne after two months to sudden infant death syndrome.\n\nRichards also has five grandchildren, three from his son Marlon including Ella Richards (picture above) and two from his daughter Angela.\n\nHow much is Keith Richards worth?\n\nKeith Richard's net worth is an estimated $340 million.\n\nWhat else should we know about Keith Richards?\n\nTogether with Johnny Depp, Richards attempted to persuade Mick Jagger to also star in the Pirates Of The Caribbean series to which he declined.\n\nHaving been arrested for drug-related crimes five times in his life, and being both open and frank about his drug use, this helped cultivate Richards' now-iconic 'hellraiser' image.\n\nRead more: Watch The Trailer For Keith Richards Documentary\n\nKeith Richards played a one-off show as The Dirty Mac with John Lennon, Eric Clapton, and Jimi Hendrix's drummer Mitch Mitchell for The Rolling Stones Rock 'n' Roll Circus in 1968, the only time he would appear on stage with Lennon.\n\nIn November 2016, perhaps customarily, Richards declared \"I'd like to croak magnificently, onstage\" when asked about retirement."
