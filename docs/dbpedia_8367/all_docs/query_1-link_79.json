Really?\n\nGeneral knowledge brain:\n\nI was right about Marconi though.\n\nLogical brain:\n\nAnd it probably makes more sense if you factor in the time period of the song’s narrative.\n\nMusic lover brain:\n\nI’m…I’m kind of attached to Mark Coney now. Whoever he is. And besides, I like ‘La Bamba’.\n\nEvidence-obsessive brain:\n\nBut…but…but it’s wrong! Those are the wrong words!\n\nCreative brain:\n\nNothing’s ever stopped me from making up my own words to songs before. I can name at least three songs where it’s always my own version of the lyrics that gets in our head rather than the official version.\n\nEvidence-obsessive brain:\n\nBut there’s a difference between deliberately inventing alternative lyrics and getting them wrong because you’ve misheard them. The latter is wrong. And we’re never wrong, are we? We strive to be…not wrong.\n\nMusic lover brain:\n\n…I suppose so.\n\nCreative brain:\n\nI’ll sit down and write a full set of alternative lyrics, then. Except…no, I can’t, because LadBaby literally just did that, and so it would be unoriginal.\n\nEvidence-obsessive brain:\n\nGood! So we’re all agreed, then. It’s going to be the correct version of the lyrics that gets in our head from now on.\n\n<five minutes later>\n\nEarworm brain:"
