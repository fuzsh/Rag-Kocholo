        "text": "Salisbury Cathedral June 2020\n\n30th August 2020\n\nIt’s back in at 1 for a 4th week on top for Kendrick Lamar & SZA after 3 weeks on top in 2018, following the tragic death of Chadwick Boseman, who was great in Black Panther. The track has an added layer of pathos now on what was already one of the greatest tracks of last decade. That means Miley Cyrus and the entire top 5 all drop a place for now, but Bright Light Bright Light sneaks into the 10 with his second top 10 hit 4 years on from All In The Name.\n\nBORNS also returns with the stomping Electric Love in at 14, 4 years on from peaking at 24, as it’s selling itunes for some reason or other. Tame Impala grab a 7th or 8th top 20, and a host of tracks climb between 41 and 100, with just a few new entries: Calvin Harris & The Weeknd join forces for the highest new track of the week – it’s at least an 18th for The weeknd, and 25th for Calvin, but that’s not including guest spots for the most part. Erasure get a quick second of 2020, ditto Bon Jovi, Georgia Lines debuts, while news of the week is the return of Dubstar 22 years since they last charted, and that was a top 10 I Will Be Your Girlfriend. They didn’t have many hits but they mostly had top 10’s when they did.\n\n1 NEW 1 1 ALL THE STARS Kendrick Lamar, SZA 170000\n\n2 1 1 3 MIDNIGHT SKY Miley Cyrus 302600\n\n3 2 2 3 GHOSTKEEPER Klangkarussell & GIVVEN 285000\n\n4 3 1 4 FREAK Doja Cat featuring Paul Anka 370000\n\n5 4 1 6 SAY SOMETHING Kylie Minogue 640000\n\n6 5 5 8 AND IT BREAKS MY HEART LEON 306700\n\n7 9 7 5 ONE AND ONE MAKE FIVE Pet Shop Boys 159450\n\n8 6 4 5 SUGAR MAN (THE GOLDFISH MIX) Rodriguez 278000\n\n9 12 9 9 I USED TO BE COOL Bright Light Bright Light 200500\n\n10 10 10 5 MY FUTURE Billie Eilish 136250\n\n11 7 7 5 GRAND ILLUSION (LE FLEX POOLSIDE MIX) Donna Summer 164000\n\n12 13 12 6 DANGEROUS LOVE Tiwa Savage 144300\n\n13 8 1 5 RIGHT BACK WHERE WE STARTED FROM Maxine Nightingale 425000\n\n14 NEW 14 1 ELECTRIC LOVE BORNS 29000\n\n15 28 15 3 BREATHE DEEPER Tame Impala 50500\n\n16 11 3 11 HALLUCINOGENICS (SEEB REMIX) Matt Maeson 349900\n\n17 19 17 5 MARRIED IN VEGAS The Vamps 80800\n\n18 22 18 7 WHAT’S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT Kygo & Tina Turner 117900\n\n19 20 19 7 THIS FEELING Faithless featuring Suli Breaks and Nathan Ball 103700\n\n20 21 20 6 BLACK DOG Arlo Parks 100700\n\n21 14 10 7 SUN IS SHINING Bob Marley Featuring Robin Schulz 185300\n\n22 15 4 8 SALAMANDER STREET Callum Beattie 316250\n\n23 24 23 5 TO SPEAK IS A SIN Pet Shop Boys 76350\n\n24 29 24 4 AIR I BREATHE Sub Focus featuring Wilkinson 55700\n\n25 31 25 3 TO BE YOUNG Anne-Marie featuring Doja Cat 40650\n\n26 18 18 8 FOOLED AROUND AND FELL IN LOVE Miranda Lambert featuring Maren Morris, Elle King, Ashley McBride, Tenille Townes, and Caylee Hammack 128250\n\n27 32 27 5 HAPPINESS McFly 67300\n\n28 17 1 8 HOW LONG Ace featuring Paul Carrack 558300\n\n29 57 29 2 TICK TOCK Clean Bandit & Mabel 28600\n\n30 30 30 13 GOODBYE STRANGER Supertramp 163550\n\n31 16 10 11 MY OWN SOUL’S WARNING The Killers 175500\n\n32 33 32 3 BACK AT WRONG Lola Lennox 46300\n\n33 34 33 5 IN AND OUT OF LOVE Melanie C 61400\n\n34 39 34 4 DELUDED Kate Miller-Heidke 48100\n\n35 35 35 4 A LITTLE RESPECT Erasure 69400\n\n36 40 36 4 SUPERMAN Keith Urban 47800\n\n37 44 37 3 BLUEBIRD Miranda Lambert 37350\n\n38 38 38 9 ORDINARY WORLD Duran Duran 117700\n\n39 23 1 10 WATERMELON SUGAR Harry Styles 590850\n\n40 45 40 4 REAL LOVE SONG Nothing But Thieves 46100\n\n41 25 3 9 HALLUCINATE Dua Lipa 336550\n\n42 42 42 5 SUNDOWN Gordon Lightfoot 64550\n\n43 27 27 6 THE ONE THAT YOU LOVE LP 91900\n\n44 26 14 6 EXILE Taylor Swift featuring Bon Iver 123150\n\n45 37 1 11 SPINNING OVER YOU REYKO 874800\n\n46 93 46 2 CHINA SHOP St. Lucia 14450\n\n47 36 15 7 SMILE Katy Perry 133350\n\n48 63 48 2 BEND THE KNEE Bruno Martini, IZA & Timbaland 19500\n\n49 54 49 5 LIGHTER Nathan Dawe featuring KSI 45000\n\n50 84 50 2 TRAVEL BACK IN TIME Little Jinder’s Unreleased Romance & Little Jinder 15200\n\n51 46 1 23 LEVITATING/ (THE BLESSED MADONNA REMIX) Dua Lipa/ Dua Lipa featuring Madonna & Missy Elliott 1306600\n\n52 43 1 16 IN YOUR EYES Robin Schulz featuring Alida 944050\n\n53 58 53 2 SPAGHETTI City Of The Sun 21450\n\n54 41 18 7 DANCING IN THE MOONLIGHT Jubel featuring NEIMY 109350\n\n55 94 55 2 BABY IT’S YOU London Grammar 12400\n\n56 47 6 10 SHOULD I GIVE IT ALL UP (DEMO) James Blunt 289000\n\n57 51 37 6 21ST CENTURY SCHIZOID MAN Toyah & The Humans featuring Jessica Gallo 80650\n\n58 59 58 4 IN HELL I’LL BE IN GOOD COMPANY The Dead South 33300\n\n59 60 59 4 OUT OF SIGHT Yello 27500\n\n60 66 60 3 WILL YOU RETURN/WHEN YOU COME DOWN The Flaming Lips featuring Particle Kid 21200\n\n61 61 61 6 OH WELL PART 2 Fleetwood Mac 35800\n\n62 68 62 2 WHO’S LAUGHING NOW Ava Max 13800\n\n63 65 63 5 TOUGH PILL Izzy Bizu 24900\n\n64 80 64 3 MY WAY Aloe Blacc 12900\n\n65 53 53 6 WORRY ABOUT ME Ellie Goulding & blackbear 46150\n\n66 67 66 4 GIRLFRIEND Charlie Puth 21200\n\n67 74 67 2 TAKE YOU DANCING Jason Derulo 11800\n\n68 71 68 3 LOVE AND AFFECTION Joan Armatrading 13900\n\n69 69 69 5 WHAT YOU GONNA DO???

That’s her 7th top 10 in 12 years, not bad for a Hannah Montana. Ghostkeeper was so very nearly on top, there wasn’t much in it, both are fab.\n\nPet Shop Boys get yet another album track into the top 10, albeit 27 years late thanks to my stupid policy of not allowing album tracks to chart from 1976 through to the download era. This track was nearly a single from Very, and is their 100th top 10, give or take a few, depending on whether I choose to include alternate versions of previously charted songs, songs/production they gave away to other acts, and collaborations with or on other acts tracks. The only way they can be beaten as a career total is if I do the same for Paul McCartney and include all The Beatles stuff. And I’m still not sure he’s got over 100 (but probably has).\n\nBillie Eilish gets her 4th top 10, The Vamps get a 2nd top 20, and Faithless get a first top 20 in 18 years. Biggest climbers are Tame Impala and Anne-Marie/Doja Cat, leaping up into the 40, giving Doja a 3rd top 40, and Tame Impala a 10th. Highest new entry is Clean Bandit back after a bit of a chart holiday, Tick Tock is an 11th chart entry, and they previously charted with Anne-Marie to boot. This time it’s Mabel grabbing a 4th chart credit.\n\nTimbaland hasn’t had a lead chart credit since 2011, following a busy few years in the noughties, but he’s back in support on a debut from Bruno Martini. Ava Max notches up another new entry, Jason Derulo makes it a decade of chart activity as his latest single gives him a first mention for 2 years, London Grammar, SYML and Gallant all add to their growing list of chart entries, and some oldies appear lower down, notably The Sutherland Brothers following the belated news of the death of Iain Sutherland, including their most famous song Sailing, as crooned by Rod Stewart to lesser effect.\n\nFrom the same period as Sailing, 1972, I take the opportunity to belatedly chart Thing by Edwina Biglet & The Miglets as I entered it into an Indie song competition. Amusing, and an early experiment with synths, the song never charted (and I only charted songs in the UK singles top 30 in 1972) but was played by Alan Freeman at the time. Finally, Marty Wilde gets his first-ever solo entry at the age of 81, with a new song that echoes a lot of 60’s sounds and styles, ably assisted by daughter Kim. That makes it sound like a chart debut age record, but it’s not quite true. He also charted 7 years back along with Kim on one of her Christmas tracks, and co-wrote (along with son Ricky) a lot of Kim’s early hits. What’s more, although his 50’s and 60’s chart career predated my personal charts, he only just got pipped by weeks to chart Abergavenny, a song I was mad on in 1968, while his song Jesamine topped my chart later that year for The Casuals. So, 52 years and long overdue a solo hit as lead act!\n\n1 34 1 2 MIDNIGHT SKY Miley Cyrus 187600\n\n2 3 2 2 GHOSTKEEPER Klangkarussell & GIVVEN 200000\n\n3 1 1 3 FREAK Doja Cat featuring Paul Anka 305000\n\n4 2 1 5 SAY SOMETHING Kylie Minogue 580000\n\n5 7 5 7 AND IT BREAKS MY HEART LEON 251700\n\n6 4 4 4 SUGAR MAN (THE GOLDFISH MIX) Rodriguez 230000\n\n7 8 7 4 GRAND ILLUSION (LE FLEX POOLSIDE MIX) Donna Summer 127000\n\n8 5 1 4 RIGHT BACK WHERE WE STARTED FROM Maxine Nightingale 393000\n\n9 15 9 4 ONE AND ONE MAKE FIVE Pet Shop Boys 109450\n\n10 18 10 4 MY FUTURE Billie Eilish 94250\n\n11 6 3 10 HALLUCINOGENICS (SEEB REMIX) Matt Maeson 324900\n\n12 17 12 8 I USED TO BE COOL Bright Light Bright Light 155500\n\n13 13 13 5 DANGEROUS LOVE Tiwa Savage 109300\n\n14 12 10 6 SUN IS SHINING Bob Marley Featuring Robin Schulz 165550\n\n15 9 4 7 SALAMANDER STREET Callum Beattie 296750\n\n16 10 10 10 MY OWN SOUL’S WARNING The Killers 157600\n\n17 11 1 7 HOW LONG Ace featuring Paul Carrack 540000\n\n18 19 18 7 FOOLED AROUND AND FELL IN LOVE Miranda Lambert featuring Maren Morris, Elle King, Ashley McBride, Tenille Townes, and Caylee Hammack 109750\n\n19 31 19 4 MARRIED IN VEGAS The Vamps 57800\n\n20 28 20 6 THIS FEELING Faithless featuring Suli Breaks and Nathan Ball 82700\n\n21 25 21 5 BLACK DOG Arlo Parks 80700\n\n22 24 22 6 WHAT’S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT Kygo & Tina Turner 95900\n\n23 16 1 9 WATERMELON SUGAR Harry Styles 573750\n\n24 30 24 4 TO SPEAK IS A SIN Pet Shop Boys 57100\n\n25 20 3 8 HALLUCINATE Dua Lipa 322550\n\n26 14 14 5 EXILE Taylor Swift featuring Bon Iver 109900\n\n27 29 27 5 THE ONE THAT YOU LOVE LP 78400\n\n28 74 28 2 BREATHE DEEPER Tame Impala 23500\n\n29 47 29 3 AIR I BREATHE Sub Focus featuring Wilkinson 36700\n\n30 32 30 12 GOODBYE STRANGER Supertramp 145550\n\n31 80 31 2 TO BE YOUNG Anne-Marie featuring Doja Cat 21900\n\n32 46 32 4 HAPPINESS McFly 48900\n\n33 55 33 2 BACK AT WRONG Lola Lennox 28500\n\n34 48 34 4 IN AND OUT OF LOVE Melanie C 43700\n\n35 38 35 3 A LITTLE RESPECT Erasure 51900\n\n36 23 15 6 SMILE Katy Perry 120850\n\n37 22 1 10 SPINNING OVER YOU REYKO 861800\n\n38 40 38 8 ORDINARY WORLD Duran Duran 100500\n\n39 54 39 3 DELUDED Kate Miller-Heidke 30500\n\n40 52 40 3 SUPERMAN Keith Urban 30400\n\n41 27 18 6 DANCING IN THE MOONLIGHT Jubel featuring NEIMY 98350\n\n42 42 42 4 SUNDOWN Gordon Lightfoot 50800\n\n43 26 1 15 IN YOUR EYES Robin Schulz featuring Alida 932550\n\n44 66 44 2 BLUEBIRD Miranda Lambert 20050\n\n45 49 45 3 REAL LOVE SONG Nothing But Thieves 29100\n\n46 44 1 22 LEVITATING/ (THE BLESSED MADONNA REMIX) Dua Lipa/ Dua Lipa featuring Madonna & Missy Elliott 1294850\n\n47 35 6 9 SHOULD I GIVE IT ALL UP (DEMO) James Blunt 278400\n\n48 33 8 10 SAVIOUR (EXTENDED MIX) Dimension & Sharlene Hector 281500\n\n49 36 3 9 MALIBU Kim Petras 375900\n\n50 37 5 10 FADED Izzy Bizu 276750\n\n51 39 37 5 21ST CENTURY SCHIZOID MAN Toyah & The Humans featuring Jessica Gallo 70250\n\n52 21 11 15 BIG LOG Robert Plant 200600\n\n53 59 53 5 WORRY ABOUT ME Ellie Goulding & blackbear 39150\n\n54 60 54 4 LIGHTER Nathan Dawe featuring KSI 32900\n\n55 58 55 4 HEAD & HEART Joel Corry featuring MNEK 35200\n\n56 41 8 9 HUSAVIK (MY HOMETOWN) Will Ferrell & My Marianne 185750\n\n57 NEW 57 1 TICK TOCK Clean Bandit & Mabel 10400\n\n58 NEW 58 1 SPAGHETTI City Of The Sun 10200\n\n59 62 59 3 IN HELL I’LL BE IN GOOD COMPANY The Dead South 23100\n\n60 72 60 3 OUT OF SIGHT Yello 17400\n\n61 63 61 5 OH WELL PART 2 Fleetwood Mac 28300\n\n62 67 62 4 CHARLIE PATTON HIGHWAY (TURN IT UP, PT 1.)

It’s her second chart-topper of 2020, and it’s Paul’s first-ever top 10, let alone chart-topper. He made my charts with (You’re) Having My Baby in 1974, a record that doesn’t work these days, but was nice enough at the time, so a patient wait of 46 years to to grab a number one, albeit with a 50’s track he wrote as a teenager as the backbone of an improved (if naughty) re-write.\n\nHighest new entry is Austrian electronic duo Klangkarussell and a great dance track Ghostkeeper in at 3, with a co-credit from Canadian GIVVEN, while Donna Summer gets a remix of a 1980 album track into the top 10, her first top 10 with a previously uncharted track since err 1989! Extends the top 10 run to 43 years though. The Killers make it 2 top 10’s in 2020, Pet Shop Boys make it 2 top 40 this week, both tracks from 1993, and the best new song this week is Miley Cyrus in at 34 with the fab Midnight Sky. 12 years of chart entries, and 7 top 10’s – none of them The Climb or Wrecking Ball. She’s getting better as she gets older, after starting well, dipping a bit, and then getting interesting.\n\nNew at 55 it’s Lola Lennox, not only a great name but the daughter of Annie, and sounding not unlike her mum, Miranda Lambert charts a second oldie in my chart that I’d missed when new, Tame Impala return with another track off the album for a 5th year of chart entries without getting an actual UK or US singles hit, such is the lack of variety in the charts. First Aid Kit also return 6 years on since Emmylou and My Silver Lining went top 10. The Flaming Lips are back! It’s been 21 years since Race For The Prize hit my top 20, and 17 years since Yoshimi went top 10, and 14 years since they last charted (The Yeah Yeah Yeah song went top 10 in 2006), so it’s lovely to have them back. Not content with number one, Doja Cat also sneaks in with Anne-Marie and a new goodie, two Joans return to the my chart (Armatrading with her awesome 1976 debut, and Baez with her uncharted goodie, Diamonds And Rust being only her second charting track – she debuted in 1971, so a bit of a 49-year-wait then! Weezer also return, from feeling like a 90’s Buddy Holly in Happy Days through to finally getting a chart-topper in 2017 with Feels Like Summer – and then failing to follow-up till now!\n\n1 7 1 2 FREAK Doja Cat featuring Paul Anka 220000\n\n2 1 1 4 SAY SOMETHING Kylie Minogue 515000\n\n3 NEW 3 1 GHOSTKEEPER Klangkarussel & GIVVEN 85000\n\n4 5 4 3 SUGAR MAN (THE GOLDFISH MIX) Rodriguez 175000\n\n5 2 1 3 RIGHT BACK WHERE WE STARTED FROM Maxine Nightingale 345000\n\n6 3 3 9 HALLUCINOGENICS (SEEB REMIX) Matt Maeson 287900\n\n7 8 7 6 AND IT BREAKS MY HEART LEON 191700\n\n8 18 8 3 GRAND ILLUSION (LE FLEX POOLSIDE MIX) Donna Summer 77000\n\n9 4 4 6 SALAMANDER STREET Callum Beattie 269750\n\n10 26 10 9 MY OWN SOUL’S WARNING The Killers 132600\n\n11 6 1 6 HOW LONG Ace featuring Paul Carrack 517000\n\n12 10 10 5 SUN IS SHINING Bob Marley Featuring Robin Schulz 136550\n\n13 19 13 4 DANGEROUS LOVE Tiwa Savage 77300\n\n14 14 14 4 EXILE Taylor Swift featuring Bon Iver 91400\n\n15 21 15 3 ONE AND ONE MAKE FIVE Pet Shop Boys 64450\n\n16 9 1 8 WATERMELON SUGAR Harry Styles 554500\n\n17 17 17 7 I USED TO BE COOL Bright Light Bright Light 120500\n\n18 24 18 3 MY FUTURE Billie Eilish 52250\n\n19 20 19 6 FOOLED AROUND AND FELL IN LOVE Miranda Lambert featuring Maren Morris, Elle King, Ashley McBride, Tenille Townes, and Caylee Hammack 87750\n\n20 12 3 7 HALLUCINATE Dua Lipa 303800\n\n21 11 11 14 BIG LOG Robert Plant 189100\n\n22 13 1 9 SPINNING OVER YOU REYKO 844500\n\n23 15 15 5 SMILE Katy Perry 103450\n\n24 30 24 5 WHAT’S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT Kygo & Tina Turner 76400\n\n25 32 25 4 BLACK DOG Arlo Parks 60950\n\n26 23 1 14 IN YOUR EYES Robin Schulz featuring Alida 919050\n\n27 22 18 5 DANCING IN THE MOONLIGHT Jubel featuring NEIMY 84350\n\n28 33 28 5 THIS FEELING Faithless featuring Suli Breaks and Nathan Ball 62700\n\n29 36 29 4 THE ONE THAT YOU LOVE LP 60000\n\n30 43 30 3 TO SPEAK IS A SIN Pet Shop Boys 38100\n\n31 40 31 3 MARRIED IN VEGAS The Vamps 36800\n\n32 35 32 11 GOODBYE STRANGER Supertramp 127550\n\n33 25 8 9 SAVIOUR (EXTENDED MIX) Dimension & Sharlene Hector 269200\n\n34 NEW 34 1 MIDNIGHT SKY Miley Cyrus 17600\n\n35 29 6 8 SHOULD I GIVE IT ALL UP (DEMO) James Blunt 265900\n\n36 27 3 8 MALIBU Kim Petras 363800\n\n37 28 5 9 FADED Izzy Bizu 264750\n\n38 38 38 2 A LITTLE RESPECT Erasure 34400\n\n39 37 37 4 21ST CENTURY SCHIZOID MAN Toyah & The Humans featuring Jessica Gallo 58500\n\n40 45 40 7 ORDINARY WORLD Duran Duran 83300\n\n41 39 8 8 HUSAVIK Will Ferrell & My Marianne 175150\n\n42 48 42 3 SUNDOWN Gordon Lightfoot 37050\n\n43 16 16 10 THE SIX-TEENS The Sweet 149750\n\n44 44 1 21 LEVITATING/ (THE BLESSED MADONNA REMIX) Dua Lipa/ featuring Madonna & Missy Elliott 1282100\n\n45 41 18 8 OH WHAT A FEELING Walk Off The Earth 140950\n\n46 46 46 3 HAPPINESS McFly 31100\n\n47 70 47 2 AIR I BREATHE Sub Focus featuring Wilkinson 18500\n\n48 49 48 3 IN AND OUT OF LOVE Melanie C 26100\n\n49 80 49 2 REAL LOVE SONG Nothing But Thieves 16100\n\n50 31 10 6 THE THINGS WE DO Foster The People 139900\n\n51 34 7 13 I FLY Galantis featuring Faouzia 290350\n\n52 91 52 2 SUPERMAN Keith Urban 13400\n\n53 47 39 6 NATALIE DON’T RAYE 66650\n\n54 88 54 2 DELUDED Kate Miller-Heidke 13400\n\n55 NEW 55 1 BACK AT WRONG Lola Lennox 10800\n\n56 56 56 6 MAKE YOU DANCE Meghan Trainor 46000\n\n57 50 50 10 BREAKING ME Topic & A7S 67400\n\n58 60 58 3 HEAD & HEART Joel Corry featuring MNEK 24400\n\n59 65 59 4 WORRY ABOUT ME Ellie Goulding & blackbear 27900\n\n60 61 60 3 LIGHTER Nathan Dawe featuring KSI 21900\n\n61 55 55 4 WHEN I’M WITH YOU Sparks 39200\n\n62 72 62 2 IN HELL I’LL BE IN GOOD COMPANY The Dead South 13000\n\n63 75 63 4 OH WELL PART 2 Fleetwood Mac 20800\n\n64 58 52 3 CRAZY Daniela Andrade 28800\n\n65 62 2 17 THE LAKE Galantis & Wrabel 699400\n\n66 NEW 66 1 BLUEBIRD Miranda Lambert 6800\n\n67 68 67 3 CHARLIE PATTON HIGHWAY (TURN IT UP, PT 1.)

No act has ever done 5 decades – but Madonna and Pet Shop Boys only need one more unbeatable track to take that crown. Kylie has now had 13 chart-toppers, not bad considering I took 5 years into her career to be totally convinced.\n\nHighest new entry at 7 if a second top 10 for Doja Cat, hot on the heels of her chart-topper Say So, Freak being a naughty song lying on a bed of Paul Anka 50’s doo-wops backing (and a bit of Paul Anka at the end, Put Your Head On My Shoulder being a huge hit when I was one-year old in 1959, and Paul was only 18 when he wrote it. Paul hasn’t troubled my charts for 45 years, though his songs have popped up in the interim in cover versions. My Way is one nobody has ever heard of, sung by the obscure Frank Sinatra and The Sex Pistols. Not together, obviously. That would be insane.\n\nDonna Summer has a massive leap into the 20 with her remixed Grand Illusion, the 1980 track being her first previously-uncharted track since 1994 and her first top 20 since I Feel Love charted for the 4th time, following her death in 2012. Big top 40 leapers for Billie Eilish, her 5th, The Killers rebounding to a new peak after the Springsteen-esque climax made it fresh again, Faithless getting a first with new material since 2004, and The Vamps getting only a 2nd in their chart career, the first in two years.\n\nErasure are back 32 years on with A Little Respect doing better than the new grat track which I couldnt get to hear on youtube, Sub Focus get a 4th chart entry in 8 years, dragging along Wilkinson, who has guested before elsewhere, Charlie Puth brings his Girlfriend along, while he’s still having Summer Feelings with another. How rude! Aussie Eurovision Kate gets a rather good quirky follow-up, Johnny Hates Jazz get a first chart entry in 7 years and extend their run to 33 years, Keith Urban cracks another one off in rapid succession, truly a Superman, and it’s a big welcome back to 80’s electronic duo Yello who have been absent for about 30 years or so, but now have a span of 34 years. Deep Purple make it two 2020 chart hits, that’s a first for them. Had hits in 1970, 1971, 1972, 1977, 1980 – but never 2 in a year.\n\n1 2 1 3 SAY SOMETHING Kylie Minogue 400000\n\n2 1 1 2 RIGHT BACK WHERE WE STARTED FROM Maxine Nightingale 285000\n\n3 10 3 8 HALLUCINOGENICS (SEEB REMIX) Matt Maeson 232900\n\n4 4 4 5 SALAMANDER STREET Callum Beattie 224750\n\n5 7 5 2 SUGAR MAN (THE GOLDFISH MIX) Rodriguez 110000\n\n6 3 1 5 HOW LONG Ace featuring Paul Carrack 480000\n\n7 NEW 7 1 FREAK Doja Cat featuring Paul Anka 50000\n\n8 9 8 5 AND IT BREAKS MY HEART LEON 141700\n\n9 6 1 7 WATERMELON SUGAR Harry Styles 529500\n\n10 11 10 4 SUN IS SHINING Bob Marley Featuring Robin Schulz 101550\n\n11 24 11 13 BIG LOG Robert Plant 169350\n\n12 5 3 6 HALLUCINATE Dua Lipa 283800\n\n13 8 1 8 SPINNING OVER YOU REYKO 825000\n\n14 17 14 3 EXILE Taylor Swift featuring Bon Iver 62400\n\n15 15 15 4 SMILE Katy Perry 84200\n\n16 27 16 9 THE SIX-TEENS The Sweet 136250\n\n17 22 17 6 I USED TO BE COOL Bright Light Bright Light 97500\n\n18 65 18 2 GRAND ILLUSION (LE FLEX POOLSIDE MIX) Donna Summer 29000\n\n19 36 19 3 DANGEROUS LOVE Tiwa Savage 45300\n\n20 25 20 5 FOOLED AROUND AND FELL IN LOVE Miranda Lambert featuring Maren Morris, Elle King, Ashley McBride, Tenille Townes, and Caylee Hammack 66750\n\n21 33 21 2 ONE AND ONE MAKE FIVE Pet Shop Boys 37450\n\n22 18 18 4 DANCING IN THE MOONLIGHT Jubel featuring NEIMY 65950\n\n23 12 1 13 IN YOUR EYES Robin Schulz featuring Alida 900550\n\n24 53 24 2 MY FUTURE Billie Eilish 30250\n\n25 13 8 8 SAVIOUR (EXTENDED MIX) Dimension & Sharlene Hector 251500\n\n26 90 26 8 MY OWN SOUL’S WARNING The Killers 90600\n\n27 16 3 7 MALIBU Kim Petras 346400\n\n28 21 5 8 FADED Izzy Bizu 247450\n\n29 20 6 7 SHOULD I GIVE IT ALL UP (DEMO) James Blunt 248400\n\n30 32 30 4 WHAT’S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT Kygo & Tina Turner 57400\n\n31 19 10 5 THE THINGS WE DO Foster The People 127900\n\n32 40 32 3 BLACK DOG Arlo Parks 42200\n\n33 43 33 4 THIS FEELING Faithless featuring Suli Breaks and Nathan Ball 44400\n\n34 14 7 12 I FLY Galantis featuring Faouzia 278600\n\n35 39 35 10 GOODBYE STRANGER Supertramp 109750\n\n36 38 36 3 THE ONE THAT YOU LOVE LP 41800\n\n37 37 37 3 21ST CENTURY SCHIZOID MAN Toyah & The Humans featuring Jessica Gallo 41400\n\n38 NEW 38 1 A LITTLE RESPECT Erasure 17200\n\n39 23 8 7 HUSAVIK Will Ferrell & My Marianne 161150\n\n40 91 40 2 MARRIED IN VEGAS The Vamps 18900\n\n41 26 18 7 OH WHAT A FEELING Walk Off The Earth 127950\n\n42 29 29 13 FOR WHAT IT’S WORTH Buffalo Springfield 141950\n\n43 67 43 2 TO SPEAK IS A SIN Pet Shop Boys 20100\n\n44 30 1 20 LEVITATING Dua Lipa 1268850\n\n45 45 45 6 ORDINARY WORLD Duran Duran 66300\n\n46 72 46 2 HAPPINESS McFly 18350\n\n47 47 39 5 NATALIE DON’T RAYE 55400\n\n48 54 48 2 SUNDOWN Gordon Lightfoot 23300\n\n49 93 49 2 IN AND OUT OF LOVE Melanie C 13800\n\n50 57 50 9 BREAKING ME Topic & A7S 57000\n\n51 34 7 13 WHILE WE’RE YOUNG Huey Lewis & The News 408000\n\n52 28 5 12 SUMMER FEELINGS Lennon Stella featuring Charlie Puth 277150\n\n53 69 53 5 CHI MAI Ennio Morricone 27650\n\n54 31 9 10 ((TRANCE)) The S.L.P. 212900\n\n55 55 55 3 WHEN I’M WITH YOU Sparks 31700\n\n56 56 56 5 MAKE YOU DANCE Meghan Trainor 35400\n\n57 35 35 7 MARCH MARCH The Chicks 73900\n\n58 52 52 2 CRAZY Daniela Andrade 21700\n\n59 42 1 13 VIOLENT THING Ben Dolic 952000\n\n60 79 60 2 HEAD & HEART Joel Corry featuring MNEK 14200\n\n61 78 61 2 LIGHTER Nathan Dawe featuring KSI 11900\n\n62 49 2 16 THE LAKE Galantis & Wrabel 692400\n\n63 58 7 16 SECRETS Regard & Raye 351650\n\n64 59 1 24 SAY SO Doja Cat 1070850\n\n65 71 65 3 WORRY ABOUT ME Ellie Goulding & blackbear 17800\n\n66 66 66 5 PURE The Lightning Seeds 28400\n\n67 41 1 10 A CHANGE IS GONNA COME Sam Cooke 646600\n\n68 74 68 2 CHARLIE PATTON HIGHWAY (TURN IT UP, PT 1.)

Just as Ace’s How Long took American sounds and gave a British act a big US hit, Maxine also beat the US dance acts with a fab sound that also crossed-over into the US charts, as featured this week in the amazing intro scenes to Umbrella Academy – I mean they literally start off with the world ending to the sound of Maxine singing, giving me the excuse to finally get it on top after peaking at 2 first time round. But that’s not all, that first episode also has a haunting ballad version of Gnarls Barkley’s Crazy, while the series also contains 2 flop tracks I entered in the Buzzjack Song Contest, Peter Schilling’s Major Tom, and In Hell I’ll Be In Good Company from The Dead South. The creator in that show has fab taste!\n\nThat means Kylie is stuck at 2 for now, while at 7 there’s another oldie, this one debuting though: US singer Rodriguez released two albums in 1970/71 with no success or airplay anywhere in the world, but oddly got a hit in South Africa in the late 70’s with the fab Sugar Man, and became something of a cult act, one of those never-known quality acts who somehow gain recognition late in life – in this case via a documentary about 10 years back, which I missed. I’d never heard of him until 3 weeks ago, but love the original recording now, and also this 2014 goldfish remix which you can’t buy or stream.\n\nLEON has had 5 charting tracks in 5 years, and finally gets a top 10 this week, Taylor Swift grabs a 15th top 20 in 11 years as she hooks up with Bon Iver to great effect, love the new moody Tay Tay, and the Candelight version of Cardigan also pops in. Pet Shop Boys belatedly chart two tracks from Very as I finally get round to playing the remastered CD I bought that recharted a year or so ago. Album tracks were excluded from my chart in 1993, so they qualify now if they make the UK charts again. It’s only fair if new albums have album tracks in my charts now! Toyah, meanwhile gets a first top 40 since 1985, LP gets a 3rd, and Billie Eilish continues to be varied in her tracks as her new one enters at 53.\n\nGordon Lightfoot joins Ace and The Sweet as 1974 tracks that are back, but Sundown never charted for me despite being a US number one (I only had a top 30 and it was quite volatile to fit in as many tracks as I could each week) but I did like it and it’s about time it charted, his 4th in 49 years, thanks to briefly popping into the itunes chart during the week, albeit low down at 180-something. Talking of album tracks, a 1980 Donna Summer oddity, her vocals utterly unlike Donna Summer, enters – Grand Illusion was unusual-sounding, then, and is more laid-back tropical-sounding in the remix, but still quirky. I like it! That extends Donna’s chart run to 44 years, and her first non-reissue to chart since 1994, albeit with a vocal that’s 40-years-old.\n\nIt’s been 7 years since McFly buzzed around my charts, 16 years since they debuted, and they return with Happiness, a new sound for them, sort of laid-back jazzpop, and it’s their 18th chart entry – bizarrely they’ve only ever had one top 10, 3 top 20’s, and 7 top 40’s. So not as big as in the UK charts then! Robert Plant has a new retro-sounding track joining his summer of 83 anthem Big Log in my rundown, his first new stuff since a brace of tracks in 2010, so unusually the Led Zep man his first chart hit and his current both in the chart.\n\nIf you’d said The vamps first charted in 2013 I would have been surprised! It’s true tho, really that long ago, and the fab new single Married In Vegas gives them a 9th; Little Mix make it a 14th in 9 years – again seems more like 4 years – as Mel C gets her 2020 hat-trick 22 years after first solo-hitting, 17 chart entries, 7 top 10’s including a chart-topper – she’s closing in on Spice Girl territory success in my charts. Finally Bastille are back, bringing along Graham Coxon for a Blur-whoop-it mood, that’s the first chart credit for GC outside Blur for 14 years, and Bastille’s chart-run of 7 years is quite long if you don’t compare to Coxon’s 30 years or so with Blur.\n\n1 NEW 1 1 RIGHT BACK WHERE WE STARTED FROM Maxine Nightingale 170000\n\n2 2 2 2 SAY SOMETHING Kylie Minogue 230000\n\n3 1 1 4 HOW LONG Ace featuring Paul Carrack 420000\n\n4 5 4 4 SALAMANDER STREET Callum Beattie 159750\n\n5 3 3 5 HALLUCINATE Dua Lipa 248800\n\n6 4 1 6 WATERMELON SUGAR Harry Styles 484500\n\n7 NEW 7 1 SUGAR MAN (THE GOLDFISH MIX) Rodriguez 50000\n\n8 6 1 7 SPINNING OVER YOU REYKO 793000\n\n9 20 9 4 AND IT BREAKS MY HEART LEON 93700\n\n10 14 10 7 HALLUCINOGENICS (SEEB REMIX) Matt Maeson 147900\n\n11 21 11 3 SUN IS SHINING Bob Marley Featuring Robin Schulz 59550\n\n12 12 1 12 IN YOUR EYES Robin Schulz featuring Alida 881300\n\n13 8 8 7 SAVIOUR (EXTENDED MIX) Dimension & Sharlene Hector 232750\n\n14 7 7 11 I FLY Galantis featuring Faouzia 261000\n\n15 17 15 3 SMILE Katy Perry 57200\n\n16 9 3 6 MALIBU Kim Petras 328000\n\n17 57 17 2 EXILE Taylor Swift featuring Bon Iver 33400\n\n18 26 18 3 DANCING IN THE MOONLIGHT Jubel featuring NEIMY 44700\n\n19 10 10 4 THE THINGS WE DO Foster The People 110000\n\n20 13 6 6 SHOULD I GIVE IT ALL UP (DEMO) James Blunt 230200\n\n21 11 5 7 FADED Izzy Bizu 229150\n\n22 18 18 5 I USED TO BE COOL Bright Light Bright Light 74500\n\n23 16 8 6 HUSAVIK Will Ferrell & My Marianne 144050\n\n24 29 24 12 BIG LOG Robert Plant 132350\n\n25 36 25 4 FOOLED AROUND AND FELL IN LOVE Miranda Lambert featuring Maren Morris, Elle King, Ashley McBride, Tenille Townes, and Caylee Hammack 46750\n\n26 30 18 6 OH WHAT A FEELING Walk Off The Earth 113950\n\n27 33 27 8 THE SIX-TEENS The Sweet 111250\n\n28 15 5 11 SUMMER FEELINGS Lennon Stella featuring Charlie Puth 265650\n\n29 38 29 12 FOR WHAT IT’S WORTH Buffalo Springfield 128200\n\n30 22 1 19 LEVITATING Dua Lipa 1255600\n\n31 19 9 9 ((TRANCE)) The S.L.P. 201900\n\n32 32 32 3 WHAT’S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT Kygo & Tina Turner 39400\n\n33 NEW 33 1 ONE AND ONE MAKE FIVE Pet Shop Boys 17700\n\n34 23 7 12 WHILE WE’RE YOUNG Huey Lewis & The News 396250\n\n35 37 35 6 MARCH MARCH The Chicks 63500\n\n36 65 36 2 DANGEROUS LOVE Tiwa Savage 24400\n\n37 66 37 2 21ST CENTURY SCHIZOID MAN Toyah & The Humans featuring Jessica Gallo 24100\n\n38 63 38 2 THE ONE THAT YOU LOVE LP 24400\n\n39 44 39 9 GOODBYE STRANGER Supertramp 92250\n\n40 62 40 2 BLACK DOG Arlo Parks 24400\n\n41 24 1 9 A CHANGE IS GONNA COME Sam Cooke 640000\n\n42 27 1 12 VIOLENT THING Ben Dolic 941900\n\n43 55 43 3 THIS FEELING Faithless featuring Suli Breaks and Nathan Ball 26700\n\n44 25 19 9 A GHOST Travis 121100\n\n45 53 45 5 ORDINARY WORLD Duran Duran 53300\n\n46 28 28 6 RIDE (EDIT) Lenny Kravitz 89450\n\n47 39 39 4 NATALIE DON’T RAYE 42900\n\n48 31 23 6 DIDN’T WANT TO BE THIS LONELY Pretenders 89450\n\n49 35 2 15 THE LAKE Galantis & Wrabel 685000\n\n50 34 3 12 TEARS GETTING SOBER VICTORIA 546600\n\n51 41 17 11 WELCOME TO THE NEIGHBOURHOOD (LEBROCK REMIX) Boston Manor featuring LeBrock 175850\n\n52 NEW 52 1 CRAZY Daniela Andrade 11500\n\n53 NEW 53 1 MY FUTURE Billie Eilish 11250\n\n54 NEW 54 1 SUNDOWN Gordon Lightfoot 11000\n\n55 59 55 2 WHEN I’M WITH YOU Sparks 20900\n\n56 72 56 4 MAKE YOU DANCE Meghan Trainor 24800\n\n57 67 57 8 BREAKING ME Topic & A7S 45000\n\n58 43 7 15 SECRETS Regard & Raye 344450\n\n59 52 1 23 SAY SO Doja Cat 1063750\n\n60 60 60 6 KARAOKE BooDaBash & Alessandra Omaroso 38200\n\n61 40 40 7 THE WRITER Four Of Diamonds & Mr Eazi 81700\n\n62 46 46 6 OLD ME 5 Seconds Of Summer 54900\n\n63 45 45 7 FIRE AND FURY Overcoats 70850\n\n64 56 56 6 MY HURRICANE Jamie Scott 46300\n\n65 NEW 65 1 GRAND ILLUSION (LE FLEX POOLSIDE MIX) Donna Summer 7000\n\n66 73 66 4 PURE The Lightning Seeds 21600\n\n67 NEW 67 1 TO SPEAK IS A SIN Pet Shop Boys 6600\n\n68 68 68 5 THOUSAND FACES Don Diablo & Andy Grammer 25300\n\n69 78 69 4 CHI MAI Ennio Morricone 16400\n\n70 42 10 12 ALL THAT Sparks 275750\n\n71 75 71 2 WORRY ABOUT ME Ellie Goulding & blackbear 10800\n\n72 NEW 72 1 HAPPINESS McFly 5600\n\n73 47 3 12 MOVE The Mamas 498950\n\n74 NEW 74 1 CHARLIE PATTON HIGHWAY (TURN IT UP, PT 1.)

So only 46 years waiting! That holds off Kylie’s new pop banger, right on the form she found with Golden but with a more traditional pop sound, new at 2, I’ve lost count how many top 10’s, but it’s at least her 4th number 2 and will be hoping for a 12th chart-topper in her 32-year career.\n\nGalantis gets a 2nd top 10 of 2020, his 4th in total, and Faouzia also a 2nd. Foster The People get a 3rd, and Callum Beattie a first top 10. Katy Perry bounds into the top 20 for the first time since 2017, she’s Smile-ing, as Bob Marley’s 1999 chart-topper remixes it’s way up to 21, and Kygo remixes Tina Turner’s 1984 top 10 up to 32. Jubel does what Toploader did on two occasions with Dancing In The Moonlight, going top 40, while Miranda Lambert gets a first top 40 aided and abetted by a host of female singing acts, Maren Morris and Elle King having been there before, the others not.\n\nTaylor Swift is unexpectedly back with an album of Lockdown ballads, and bounces into my chart at 57 with Bon Iver and Exile, a cool track, as Arlo Parks debuts at 62 with Black Dog. Anyone who’s lost a loved one to mental illness and suicide will identify with the touching lyrics. Meanwhile, as if a mini-invasion of a Steady Drip Drip album tracks and singles wasn’t enough, Sparks also chart a fab oldie When I’m With You which got no airplay and failed to chart in the UK first-time-round in the 80’s. LP is back, having recently topped my chart with Morrissey, Ellie Goulding has a new album out and one track took my fancy, her first appearance on my chart for 5 years.\n\nToyah, meanwhile, has been absent for knocking on 30 years from my chart, though not my concert-viewing (seen her twice in the last few years), but she finally returns with the fellow member of her band The Humans as a tribute to late drummer and King Crimson latter member (and REM) Bill Reiflin. The band are experimental prog-rock-ish, and 21st Century Schizoid Man is a King Crimson song (Toyah’s hubby Robert Fripp has been in King Crimson since the 60’s). That’s a 39-year span of hits for the ageless Toyah. Talking of tributes, 2 Fleetwood Mac oldies return as we lose Peter Green. Alabtross has made my charts many times, so have opted for the unknown Oh Well part 2 instrumental, which is nothing like part 1 at all.

Such a great record, and it’s rare these days that it takes that long to top my charts from debut (excluding obviously oldies years later), a few that have managed it in the past being A Girl Like You (Edwyn Collins) in 1995 and I’ll Never Be (Maria Magdalena) from Sandra in 1986.\n\nDua Lipa meanwhile makes it a 6th top 10 from the same album as Hallucinate do a leaper to 3, and only Physical has fallen short of the top 3, that’s how on fire she is in 2020 – it’s a veritable Greatest Hits already. It’s also her 11th top 10 in total. The S.L.P. gets a 2nd top 10, as Kasabian lose their singer – the solution seems Sergio, I mean obvious… Meanwhile Foster The People grab a 3rd top 20 with a huge climb to 12, and Callum Beattie a first with a slightly-less big climb. Bright Light Bright Light grabs a 3rd top 40, and LEON a 4th.\n\nHighest new entry is Katy Perry, who is smiling at making it close to 30 chart entries in 12 years, a good hit ratio, while Jubel chart the former 1999 chart-topper for Toploader, Dancing In The Moonlight, with the original 1973 hit version by King Harvest getting a chart run when I re-do my original charts in 2023 to compensate for all those non-UK-top-30 tracks that were excluded due to stupid chart rules I had at the time. Kygo is back, bringing Tina Turner with him as his 11th collaboration charts – a remix of Tina’s 1984 other signature song, bringing her back into my charts after a decade away. What’s Love Got To Do With It made my top 10 first time round.\n\nThe Big Band Collective looks like a Lockdown collab, and is to support struggling musicians I think, but it features new vocals from Rick Astley, still back in vogue 32 years on, and also Jimmy Somerville who’s been away since his last track in 2015 – a chart-topper with Some Wonder after a 20-year-gap followed by another 5-year gap, and it extends his chart run to 36 years since Bronski Beat debuted. Faithless are also back after a 5-year break, and the first new material since 2007 excluding versions of Insomnia in the interim, but extends their chart run to a quarter of a century give or take.\n\nTalking of 90’s remixes, Sun Is Shining is back again in remix form from Robin Schulz (recent chart-topper still in the top 10), and Bob Marley is back 4 years since his last remix, while the 1999 chart-topping mix of Sun Is Shining is itself a remix of a track that appeared on 3 Marley albums and dates from 1971, a jaw-dropping 50 years old now give or take. Bob popped his clogs 39 years ago, and still seems relevant. Not least, the new entry is adjacent to his old band’s new track which features his daughter and grandson, so you can say a 45-year-span for Bob Marley & The Wailers in my charts since No Woman No Cry went top 10.\n\n1 2 1 4 WATERMELON SUGAR Harry Styles 364500\n\n2 7 2 2 HOW LONG Ace featuring Paul Carrack 165000\n\n3 38 3 3 HALLUCINATE Dua Lipa 103800\n\n4 1 1 5 SPINNING OVER YOU REYKO

35 8 X Jonas Brothers featuring KAROL G 99300\n\n12th July 2020\n\nIt’s 3 weeks on top for Spinning Over You as REYKO holds off Watermelon Sugar at 2, which reaches a new peak on it’s 2nd chart run – giving Harry Styles the rare accolade of reaching the top 3 twice inside a 12-month period with the same track. That hardly-ever happens in my charts, as records tend to drop out of my charts naturally once I’ve heard them enough. Getting a second-wind is rare until a suitable length of time has passed. I still love Watermelon Sugar, though, my current karaoke song (at home, natch).\n\nIzzy Bizu goes top 5 with faded, and highest new entry is actually a 1974 top 30 track for me returning after selling well on itunes (an advert probably) – How Long was the only UK hit for the UK band Ace, but they had a bigger US hit with it (perfect-sounding for US radio), while lead-singer Paul Carrack went on to have a still-going career as a solo singer, and guest vocalist for bands such as Squeeze and Mike + The Mechanics, including covering his own song in the 90’s – How Long? 46 years it’s taken to break into my top 20, top 10, and well-deserved too as I love it way more than I did at the time, it sounds fab.\n\nMy Marianne & Will Ferrell grab radio 2 Playlisting as everyone agrees Husavik is actually more than a parody Eurovision song – it’s a bloody-good song as good as many a Eurovision winner – and it leaps up to 8 here. Travis grab another top 20 for 2020, making A Ghost their 11th in 23 years, Dua Lipa rockets into the 40 as she Hallucinates her 11th top 40, the previous 10 all going top 10, the only one to fall short being IDGAF. Appropriately, no doubt. Foster The People get a 6th track into my charts, not so many for a 9-year-run, but they include debuting with a chart-topper and a number 2 in 2018.\n\nCallum Beattie debuts with Salamander Street. The only other song featuring that reptile in it that I know of is Salamander Palagander, from Tyrannosaurus Rex way back when. Leon is back again in 2020 for the second time, The Lightning Seeds bring Pure back into my charts 30 years or so on, a gem of a track, and an under-rated 90’s band (again, selling on itunes, must be an advert), The Cult also drop back in after 35 years away with She Sells Sanctuary returning, as does Chi Mai for the late Ennio Morricone after a 39-year absence – I could have charted many more from the 60’s, but as I have been creating brand new weekly charts for the late 60’s contrasting what I liked then with what I like now that I’m older and know way more tracks than I did at the time, I’ve kind of given the Spaghetti Western stuff a good run in those charts recently.\n\nThe Guardians Of The Galaxy featured a fab 70’s track from Elvin Bishop, covered about a year ago by a who’s who of female-country acts and missed by me for some reason – but they join the revived (Dixie) Chicks (former) Country female acts on my list with Fooled Around And Fell In Love, headed by Miranda Lambert who gets a second chart entry 6 years on from Automatic. Meghan Trainor also returns again, Raye joins herself on the chart (albeit solo this time), 2 years since Friends went top 20, and I manage to drop the chart length to 90 by chucking out 15 tracks.\n\n1 1 1 4 SPINNING OVER YOU REYKO 625000\n\n2 5 2 3 WATERMELON SUGAR Harry Styles 194500\n\n3 4 3 3 MALIBU Kim Petras 198000\n\n4 2 1 9 IN YOUR EYES Robin Schulz featuring Alida 763300\n\n5

Kim Petras gets a first top 5 with Malibu and Harry Styles leaps up to 5 having peaked at 3 at the end of 2019 with Watermelon Sugar, still sounding fab 6 months later. James Blunt also leaps up to 6 with Should I Give It All Up, the latest track off his (extended) album to go top 10 – 6 have charted, 4 gone top 10, and one peaked at 2 (Halfway with ward Thomas). Sparks also return to the top 10 with all that as the new album gets critical acclaim and a physical release this week.\n\nBiggest climber is Pretenders’ Didn’t Want To Be This Lonely, that Bo Diddley rhythm giving them a first top 40 for 3 years, and Eurovision (the film) gives Iceland another top 40 track in 2020, the feel-good rom-com taking Will Ferrell into the top 40 as he interrupts the fab vocals of Rachel McAdams & Molly Sanden. Marilyn meanwhile gets a first top 40 since 1984, Travis a second of the year, and Lenny Kravitz a first for 2 years.\n\nAs I manage to chop my chart down to 95, there are only 5 new entries, the highest being 3rd time round for 1993 chart=topper classic Ordinary World from Duran Duran, selling in itunes again. The other 4 occupy the lowest births, Bob Sinclar returning after his top in 2019 with Robbie Williams, and extending his chart run to 17 years since debuting with The Beat Goes On in 2003, Andt Grammer gets his first for 2 years and a 9-year chart-span as guest this time on a Don Diablo track, Dua Lipa’s 5th entry from her current album pops in as a new single, and Bright Light Bright Light is back for a 4th chart entry in 6 years.\n\n1 1 1 3 SPINNING OVER YOU REYKO 455000\n\n2 2 1 8 IN YOUR EYES Robin Schulz featuring Alida 698300\n\n3 3 1 5 A CHANGE IS GONNA COME Sam Cooke 540000\n\n4

Ariana Grande & Justin Bieber 95100\n\n29th June 2020\n\nIt’s a new chart-topper for REYKO after entering at 2 last week, just edging out the still-fab Robin Schulz track, while a largely static top 10 is enlivened by Kim Petras in at 8 with Malibu, not the place, the drink. Your kisses are like Malibu, she sings – presumably too many and you feel sickly before throwing up. It’s not entirely unlike The Jacksons Shake Your Body rhythmically, and gives Kim a second top 20 2 years on from Heart To Break.\n\nHarry Styles is back with Watermelon Sugar, after going top 5 with it on a lengthy run at the end of 2019. Yes, that’s right, pre-coronavirus days. Seems positively nostalgic now! Still a career high though, and his solo career already beats the crap out of everything One Direction did. James Blunt is doing an extended edition with a fab track addition bizarrely missed off the album, in at 29, I think in the long run this stage of his career will turn out to be my fave James Blunt period. Walk Off The Earth are also back, 8 years into lots of chart entries in my charts, without ever bothering the UK charts. Not necessarily a bad thing considering what streaming companies plug into the charts these days.\n\nThe Killers replace themselves in the 40, Lenny Kravitz is back again for a 30-year-run with new material, and I’ve had to extend my charts again to 100 as the sheer volume of good tracks entering and going up overwhelms my ability to chop it down to 75, which is what I want to do! Jamie Scott had some hits back in the mid-noughties, and a had a monster with his alter-ego Graffiti 6 before that, and has popped in occasionally since as songwriter for One Direction, or guest vocals, but I’d missed his 2014 track My Hurricane which popped up when I let his new track on youtube drift on while I was distracted. It’s better than the new one.\n\nThe Dixie Chicks return after a very brief absence, minus the Dixie. Not that it’ll lose them any right-wing fans, they all buggered off 20 years ago when they slagged off Bush as the poor dears couldn’t cope with the concept of someone holding a different political point of view. Probably the same ones refusing to wear face masks and voting Trump. Chrissie Hynde & the boys are also back for a second 2020 track, 41 years since Stop Your Sobbin’ debuted Pretenders, the becky Hill & Sigala production-line of entries rolls on, Raleigh Ritchie charts 2 new album tracks in the wake of his brilliant chart-topper (also on the album) Time In A Tree and his surviving to the very end of Game Of Thrones. There’s also a new Eurovision hit – sort of. Will Ferrell’s new comedy film ‘representing’ Iceland who were actually cruelly denied a win in 2020 (guaranteed!) due to Coronavirus cancellation.\n\n1 2 1 1 SPINNING OVER YOU REYKO 285000\n\n2 1 1 7

What planet are we on, eh?! Different universe… Meanwhile REYKO are in at 2 with the brilliant Spinning Over You, SO catchy from the London-based synthpop duo, leaving Lennon Stella to grab her first top 10 with a bit of assist from Charlie Puth who had a previous best of 12 with Marvin Gaye. The song Marvin Gaye that is.\n\nIn at 25, a rousing club anthem from Dimension who gives Sharlene Hector a credit, unlike her previous grouchy mate Duke Dumont on the brilliant Therapy. Sharlene back in the day worked with Basement Jaxx and can be seen in Ronnie Scotts when it’s open next, presumably. US band Overcoats enter with Fire and Fury, girl band delight, Four Of Diamonds return, another Seeb remix pops in, and The Killers follow-up lower down.\n\nIn veterans corner we lost Vera Lynn this week aged 103, so it’s about time I charted the 80-odd-year-old We’ll Meet Again in tribute, possibly the oldest record ever to debut in my charts in terms of time taken to chart, although not in recording age. It was never one I loved as I was growing up, it was always on The Good Old Days and other oldtime variety shows and didn’t fit in with my current chart interests, but time mellows one, and it’s rather endearing these days. Marilyn is also back, a bit battered and bruised emotionally & financially of late, and needing a record deal, but Mazza’s posted some tracks lately including this lovely ballad with the late Miss Claudia back on support vocals, and a best-ever vocal performance from them both, Breathe is in at 67. That’s a chart gap of 35 years since Baby U Left Me, but now a chart span of 36 years, hooray!\n\nFinally we have Dion back with a blues album with oodles of featured famous music buddies, and I’ve cherry-picked two tracks, one with Jeff Beck, who’s guitar always gives added class and who gets a chart-span of 48 years, and another track with Paul Simon, who’s chart career expands to a whopping 51 years and 6 months with new material, a new record. It’s possible Tom Jones, or Lulu, or another act still with us who first charted in 1968 could grab the title from him but it seems unlikely for a while. Paul was charting earlier than that of course, back in 1966 in the UK, and Dion was even longer ago with classics like The Wanderer (which charted for me in 1976 as an oldie) and Runaround Sue, so technically he has to make do with a chart span of 44 years rather than 60, but Can’t Start Over Again and Song For Sam Cooke (at 3 in my chart with his Civil Rights song recorded a few months before he was shot and killed in 1964, and someone who toured with Dion in the early 60’s) are Dion’s first appearance with new material since 1990 – when he also got an assist from Paul Simon.\n\n1 3 1 6 IN YOUR EYES Robin Schulz featuring Alida 468300\n\n2 NEW 2 1 SPINNING OVER YOU REYKO 115000\n\n3 2 1 3 A CHANGE IS GONNA COME Sam Cooke 370000\n\n4 1 1 2 THE BALLROOM BLITZ The Sweet 235000\n\n5 4 1 6 VIOLENT THING Ben Dolic 750000\n\n6 7 3 6 TEARS GETTING SOBER VICTORIA 375000\n\n7 8 7 6 WHILE WE’RE YOUNG Huey Lewis & The News 213400\n\n8 15 8 5 SUMMER FEELINGS Lennon Stella featuring Charlie Puth 128350\n\n9 5 2 6 ALL OF MY LOVE Destiny & B.O.K. 515000\n\n10 6 3 6 MOVE The Mamas 375000\n\n11 11 1 13 LEVITATING Dua Lipa 1107100\n\n12 10 10 6 ALL THAT Sparks 140800\n\n13 9 9 7 PEOPLE ON THE HIGH LINE (RICHARD X RADIO EDIT) New Order 184100\n\n14 14 2 9 THE LAKE Galantis & Wrabel 570000\n\n15 13 10 6 LEFT OUT IN THE COLD Sparks 190000\n\n16 17 16 4 BLAME IT ON ME Melanie C 69500\n\n17 12 7 6 UNIVERSO Blas Canto 226000\n\n18 25 18 5 I FLY Galantis featuring Faouzia 77000\n\n19 23 19 7 NO MORE HEROES The Stranglers 108950\n\n20 22 20 5 WELCOME TO THE NEIGHBOURHOOD (LEBROCK REMIX) Boston Manor featuring LeBrock 67600\n\n21 16 7 9 SECRETS Regard & Raye 249350\n\n22 18 18 7 CHIQUITITA (SPANISH VERSION) Cher 122100\n\n23 26 23 5 FET HOUSE MODE Rebecca & Fiona 59250\n\n24 27 24 7 AUTOBAHN Kraftwerk 107150\n\n25 NEW 25 1 SAVIOUR (EXTENDED MIX) Dimension & Sharlene Hector 18750\n\n26 33 26 3 ((TRANCE)) The S.L.P. 42000\n\n27 21 1 17 SAY SO Doja Cat 979750\n\n28 19 12 6 FAI RUMORE Diodato 146300\n\n29 46 29 3 DREAM GIRL Anna Of The North 35950\n\n30 31 30 4 ALICE Lady Gaga 50800\n\n31 20 20 6 VOICES Hurts 103300\n\n32 32 32 5 NHS70 Only Sun 74000\n\n33 24 18 6 LAWNMOWER Sparks 118400\n\n34 29 29 6 BE KIND Marshmello & Halsey 84150\n\n35 39 35 5 FINGERTIPS Tom Gregory 56000\n\n36 37 36 5 ONE WORLD, ONE PRAYER The Wailers featuring Skip Marley, Farruko, Shaggy & Cedella Marley 66900\n\n37 38 37 5 X Jonas Brothers featuring KAROL G 68400\n\n38 30 5 15 CAUTION The Killers 516500\n\n39 44 39 9 DIAGNOSIS Alanis Morrissette 100850\n\n40 47 40 3 HEY NOW (THINK I GOT A FEELING) Erasure 40100\n\n41 36 36 5 RAIN ON ME Lady Gaga & Ariana Grande 70900\n\n42 45 42 3 LITTLE BIT OF LOVE JP Cooper 38000\n\n43 28 28 7 STUCK WITH U Ariana Grande & Justin Bieber 94000\n\n44 48 44 5 POLAROID Keith Urban 46950\n\n45 49 45 3 WOMAN Andreya Triana 35200\n\n46 42 1 7 THE MODEL Kraftwerk 352750\n\n47 40 2 13 BREAK MY HEART Dua Lipa 580950\n\n48 51 48 5 HURT BY YOU Donna Missal 36750\n\n49 59 49 2 LOVE IS LIKE OXYGEN The Sweet 22200\n\n50 50 50 5 EL TEJANO Lauv featuring Sofia Reyes 40600\n\n51 34 20 8 IN A ROCKET Beoga & Lissie 117050\n\n52 53 52 3 SAVE A KISS Jessie Ware 27950\n\n53 55 53 3 POMEGRANATE deadmau5 & The Neptunes 24250\n\n54 60 54 6 ISN’T SHE LOVELY Stevie Wonder 41000\n\n55 56 55 6 FOR WHAT IT’S WORTH Buffalo Springfield 43800\n\n56 35 17 6 YES Ben Tan featuring B-OK 112500\n\n57 62 57 6 BIG LOG Robert Plant 35400\n\n58 68 58 2 THE SIX-TEENS The Sweet 16600\n\n59 63 59 3 DREAMING OF YOU (IN ISOLATION) The Coral & Blossoms 22100\n\n60 74 60 3 A GHOST Travis 19400\n\n61 NEW 61 1 FIRE AND FURY Overcoats 7500\n\n62 NEW 62 1 FADED Izzy Bizu 7400\n\n63 66 63 3 GOODBYE STRANGER Supertramp 17400\n\n64 64 64 3 LOOK FOR THE GOOD Jason Mraz 18600\n\n65 81 65 2 LEARN TO FLY Surfaces & Elton John 10800\n\n66 67 66 4 NO LOVE Skip Marley 18200\n\n67 NEW 67 1 BREATHE Marilyn 6600\n\n68 76 68 3 CANDY TOWN Brand New Heavies featuring Candy Dulfer 14200\n\n69 NEW 69 1 HALLUCINOGENICS (SEEB REMIX) Matt Maeson 6200\n\n70 75 70 2 CO-CO The Sweet 11000\n\n71 73 71 4 SINE FROM ABOVE Lady Gaga & Elton John 16800\n\n72 NEW 72 1 THE WRITER Four Of Diamonds & Mr Eazi 5600\n\n73 NEW 73 1 CAN’T START OVER AGAIN Dion featuring Jeff Beck 5400\n\n74 NEW 74 1 MY OWN SOUL’S WARNING The Killers 5200\n\n75 65 65 5 CAN’T BE LIFE Mary J.

I loved The Sweet, and this week saw the third member of the original line-up pass away, Steve Priest. They were often described a rock band of roadie-types decked out in glitter and mascara, but the one who camped-it-up to the limit was Steve in his outrageous outfits and blowin’ kisses. His voice was the one with the short catchy noticeable bits. Still an exciting record, and a few other Sweet tracks pop back in – those needing a “sales” boost, as opposed to bigger tracks that already are well into my “million’sellers” territory.\n\nNew Order go top 10 for the first time in 15 years, Sparks get a 3rd top 10 in 6 months as they replace themselves with All That, track 1 on the new album, and Mel C gets a big climb for a 2nd top 20 of the year. Lady Gaga leapfrogs herself with Alice, The S.L.P. rocket in for a second top 40, who needs Kasabian?! Actual new tracks are thin on the ground giving me an opportunity to chop the chart down in size to 85, but there’s Topic, Surfaces & Elton John, giving him 2 actual new tracks in the chart for the first time in yonks and yonks, Ella Henderson extending her run and ditto Sigma and John Newman.\n\n1 NEW 1 1 THE BALLROOM BLITZ The Sweet 170000\n\n2 1 1 2 A CHANGE IS GONNA COME Sam Cooke 285000\n\n3 3 3 5 IN YOUR EYES Robin Schulz featuring Alida 298300\n\n4 2 1 5 VIOLENT THING Ben Dolic 690000\n\n5 4 2 5 ALL OF MY LOVE Destiny & B.O.K. 470000\n\n6 5 3 5 MOVE The Mamas 333000\n\n7 6 3 5 TEARS GETTING SOBER VICTORIA 320000\n\n8 7 7 5 WHILE WE’RE YOUNG Huey Lewis & The News 163400\n\n9 12 9 6 PEOPLE ON THE HIGH LINE (RICHARD X RADIO EDIT) New Order 152100\n\n10 17 10 5 ALL THAT Sparks 105800\n\n11 8 1 12 LEVITATING Dua Lipa 1070100\n\n12 9 7 5 UNIVERSO Blas Canto 203000\n\n13 10 10 5 LEFT OUT IN THE COLD Sparks 163000\n\n14 11 2 8 THE LAKE Galantis & Wrabel 541000\n\n15 15 15 4 SUMMER FEELINGS Lennon Stella featuring Charlie Puth 80350\n\n16 13 7 8 SECRETS Regard & Raye 229600\n\n17 37 17 3 BLAME IT ON ME Melanie C 44500\n\n18 19 18 6 CHIQUITITA (SPANISH VERSION) Cher 102600\n\n19 14 12 5 FAI RUMORE Diodato 128000\n\n20 24 20 5 VOICES Hurts 85400\n\n21 16 1 16 SAY SO Doja Cat 961350\n\n22 35 22 4 WELCOME TO THE NEIGHBOURHOOD (LEBROCK REMIX) Boston Manor featuring LeBrock 47600\n\n23 29 23 6 NO MORE HEROES The Stranglers 87950\n\n24 18 18 5 LAWNMOWER Sparks 100700\n\n25 25 25 4 I FLY Galantis featuring Faouzia 55000\n\n26 47 26 4 FET HOUSE MODE Rebecca & Fiona 40000\n\n27 30 27 6 AUTOBAHN Kraftwerk 88150\n\n28 31 28 6 STUCK WITH U Ariana Grande & Justin Bieber 80500\n\n29 32 29 5 BE KIND Marshmello & Halsey 66550\n\n30 21 5 14 CAUTION The Killers 499300\n\n31 52 31 3 ALICE Lady Gaga 32800\n\n32 33 32 4 NHS70 Only Sun 56200\n\n33 71 33 2 ((TRANCE)) The S.L.P. 23500\n\n34 22 20 7 IN A ROCKET Beoga & Lissie 105300\n\n35 27 17 5 YES Ben Tan featuring B-OK 101900\n\n36 36 36 4 RAIN ON ME Lady Gaga & Ariana Grande 56900\n\n37 38 37 4 ONE WORLD, ONE PRAYER The Wailers featuring Skip Marley, Farruko, Shaggy & Cedella Marley 49500\n\n38 39 38 4 X Jonas Brothers featuring KAROL G 51100\n\n39 55 39 4 FINGERTIPS Tom Gregory 38500\n\n40 28 2 12 BREAK MY HEART Dua Lipa 568450\n\n41 26 26 8 IF YOU’RE TOO SHY (LET ME KNOW) The 1975 108500\n\n42 23 1 6 THE MODEL Kraftwerk 340000\n\n43 20 20 6 NICE ‘N’ SLEAZY The Stranglers 100000\n\n44 45 44 8 DIAGNOSIS Alanis Morrissette 83750\n\n45 53 45 2 LITTLE BIT OF LOVE JP Cooper 24250\n\n46 75 46 2 DREAM GIRL Anna Of The North 17750\n\n47 56 47 2 HEY NOW (THINK I GOT A FEELING) Erasure 23100\n\n48 58 48 4 POLAROID Keith Urban 33700\n\n49 59 49 2 WOMAN Andreya Triana 22200\n\n50 60 50 4 EL TEJANO Lauv featuring Sofia Reyes 28600\n\n51 64 51 4 HURT BY YOU Donna Missal 24450\n\n52 54 52 6 BRAZIL Doves 51500\n\n53 74 53 2 SAVE A KISS Jessie Ware 16450\n\n54 34 22 9 LEAN ON ME UB40 featuring Ali Campbell & Astro 131250\n\n55 89 55 2 POMEGRANATE deadmau5 & The Neptunes 13000\n\n56 62 56 5 FOR WHAT IT’S WORTH Buffalo Springfield 33000\n\n57 40 10 14 HARVEST MOON Neil Young 238350\n\n58 42 2 18 NO TIME TO DIE Billie Eilish 837700\n\n59 NEW 59 1 LOVE IS LIKE OXYGEN The Sweet 10100\n\n60 65 60 5 ISN’T SHE LOVELY Stevie Wonder 30000\n\n61 50 1 19 TEARS OF GOLD Faouzia 1082250\n\n62 70 62 5 BIG LOG Robert Plant 25000\n\n63 76 63 2 DREAMING OF YOU (IN ISOLATION) The Coral & Blossoms 12000\n\n64 78 64 2 LOOK FOR THE GOOD Jason Mraz 11500\n\n65 80 65 4 CAN’T BE LIFE Mary J.

Andreya Triana returns belatedly with a 2-year-old track I missed but which is selling on itunes, as is Sam Cooke, The S.L.P. finally follows-up his chart-topper, Jessie Ware replaces herself in the chart, Anna Of The North get a 4th entry in 5 years.\n\nThe Coral return after a 13-year absence, thanks to a Lockdown Blossoms cover of their 2002 top 10 Dreaming Of You, Jason Mraz is back after an 8-year gap, Travis extend their run to 23 years of chart entries, Deadmau5 to 9 years, and Candy Dulfer to 30 years after keeping her sax absent for almost 30 years, but now she’s on a track from the returning Brand New Heavies who grab 2 this week after a gap of 22 years, having had quite a run from 1991 through 1998.
