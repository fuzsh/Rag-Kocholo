        "text": "BEATS & PIECES\n\nARTHUR BAKER first concocted an un-released hip hop treatment of John Coltrane’s ‘A Love Supreme’ back in the early Eighties, in partnership with Jellybean, after whose then current Funhouse club residency the group would have been named… I actually once saw the late John Coltrane, playing at New York’s legendary though long defunct Birdland — fact, back then I saw and/or met most of the jazz greats (Miles Davis, Thelonious Monk, Charlie Mingus, you name ’em), because jazz clubs were just about all there was… Cash Money (who says, “I try to make my turntables talk — too many DJs just scratch”) is having a worldwide tour set up by the Disco Mix Club now that he’s World champ, following what he clams was the toughest contest he’s ever won… Lightning Rich and 14-year-old girl DJ Sporty Shorty are the hometown Philadelphia mixers Mr Money himself admires… Technics Mixing finalists in the future should seriously consider getting their own name recorded on acetate, so that they can scratch it into their mix… Radio London’s hip hop presenter Dave Pearce has a new day job as head of black A&R at Urban… Vendetta Records is A&M’s new US dance label, although to our ears it’ll be rather more pop-orientated than its Breakout UK equivalent… Gravesend DJ Eddie Gordon seems to be taking over from Paul Bunting as club plugger at MCA… Julian Jonah’s muttering and bubbling 119½bpm ‘Jealousy & Lies‘ is now on Cooltempo promo — it being the flip’s 123½bpm Alternative Dance Mix that you’ll find (at 123¼bpm) on this week’s free ‘Cool Cuts 2’ seven incher, along with the 87½bpm Derek B ‘Def Beat Boy‘ and 121¼bpm Jellybean ‘Jingo‘ remixes… ‘On The Edge‘, a sax squealed pleasant jiggly rolling 99⅔bpm reading of Kenny G’s instrumental, is the only tune so far to get dance-floor attention on Walter Beasley’s self-titled album (Urban URBLP 6)… Natalie Cole is about on creatively marketed limited white label in two Motorway Mixes by South London DJ Perry Daniels, the 123¼-123bpm ‘Jump Start/Pink Cadillac’ M1 scratch mix being done live in one take and the 122¾-122½-0bpm ‘Pink Cadillac’ M4 remix flip being created without benefit of master tapes… T-Cut-F’s new 124½-0bpm Union Jack Mix of ‘House Reaction’ is due on 10 Records just after Easter… Biz Markie ‘Biz Is Goin’ Off’ 12 inch, reviewed last week on import, is already out here (Cold Chillin’ W7930T)… CityBeat’s UK pressing of Rob Base & DJ E-Z Rock ‘It Takes Two’, promoed now but due April 4, is (typically for the label) slower at (0-)111⅙bpm, while Kechia Jenkins ‘I Need Somebody’, due next week (minus the Blaze mix) is similarly 114⅓bpm… Champion have promoed Richard Valentine ‘Come Back Lover’, only in its here 112¼bpm Hard Club Version, 112⅔bpm Percapella, 112½bpm Apache Beats, and 112bpm Club Version — although, to complicate matters (as the seven track import has three differently defined ‘Club’ Versions), this latter is actually the import’s Done Properly Dub!… Virgin have disguised the not entirely “street cred” Well Red’s newie on white label promo as being by DJ D-Zire, but as usual rm blows the whistle!… Teena Marie’s review last week was jumbled with Kashif’s… Mark Farren (Guildford) finds when mixing Kylie Minogue ‘I Should Be So Lucky (Bicentennial Mix)‘ with Rick Astley ‘Together Forever (Lover’s Leap Remix)‘ that their drum patterns are so identical they actually phase (yeah, and Dolly Parton played at 33⅓rpm sounds like Elvis Presley!)… Terry Billy visits Steve Jason’s moveable Rendezvous night this Thursday (24) at Peterborough’s Videotek, while Total Contrast join Mark Purdy this Friday (25) at Kings Lynn’s Manhattans… Saturday (26), Martin Collins, Steve ‘Jammin’ Jason, Jamie Trundle, Chris ‘Charlie’ Brown and Danny Smith all soul Gt Yarmouth’s Scruples beside the seaside… Dave Woodcock and Steve Aspey soul and funk a Sunday (27) extravaganza at Witney’s Palace… Terry Billy is with Jeff Thomas at Swansea’s heaving Martha’s Vineyard on Monday (28)… Rodney Saulsberry will be appearing around the country for 10 days over Easter… Jim Cotter (01-358 0809), an experienced mixing/talking jock and studio engineer, recently of L’Equipe Anglaise, is after ideally a pub-type residency within the M25… Mark Hughes (Worthing 691047), also a mixing talker, was at Bubbles and is after ideally an upfront gig… New York’s New Music Seminar this year is July 16-20, details here from Philip Rambow on 01-960 0154, should the 1988 International DJ Convention have made you a glutton for punishment!… I seemed to meet more Irish DJs than anyone else at the DJ convention’s opening Sunday party, a large and welcome contingent being over from both Northern Ireland and Eire, avid rm readers all, their most frequent comment being that this column is a lifeline for them… Chris Carey — one time pirate ship DJ Spangles Muldoon but now an Irish radio tycoon, currently of Nova Satellite Radio Network – contentiously joked at the radio seminar that “A speech impediment is an absolute must for DJs on ILR!”… GET OFF!\n\nARTHUR BAKER, the New York based producer behind Wally Jump Jr and other studio creations, has now signed in his own right as a solo artiste with A&M, and is both recording and house hunting here in London. What’s more, he’ll be accompanied on some tracks by James Brown’s legendary sideman, Maceo Parker, whom he located in North Carolina. In case you’re used to Arthur with a goatee beard, it started to fall out so he shaved it off!\n\nHOT VINYL\n\nRICK CLARKE ‘I’ll Meet You Along The Way’ (WA Records WAT-1, via Jet Star)\n\nNo longer on RCA, Rick’s gorgeous newie (self-prod/penned with Peter Hinds) is a gently jogging relaxed 88⅔bpm swayer with some jazzy vibes and chimes behind his scatting and teasing superbly expressive soulful singing —the best to come out of Britain so far this year. Only on white label at the moment, the B-side appears to be a long version. How could a supposedly major label let something this good get away?\n\nWILL DOWNING ‘A Love Supreme (Jazz In The House Remix)’ (Fourth & Broadway 12BRW 90)\n\nIn a “pshta pshta” hi-hat hissed more purposefully pulsing 0-119½bpm Arthur Baker remix, this glorious breathily Vandross-ish vocal version of the late John Coltrane’s inspirational jazz classic is still perhaps more satisfying in the flip’s Stanley Turrentine-saxed 0-120⅓bpm Album Mix (afro percussion flavoured 120-0bpm Dub In The House Remix, too).\n\nERIC B & RAKIM ‘I Know You Got Soul (The Derek On Eric Remix)’ (Cooltempo COOLXR 146)\n\nGetting right away from other “Jackson 5” treatments, Derek B’s jiggly jumpy shuffling 103⅔bpm remix — as exclusively revealed last week — Includes ‘Superstition’-like clavinet notes without quoting the actual tune, flipped by the controversial current Norman C & DJ D Remix and the Original Version to make what must be the best value 12 inch.\n\nDOUG E FRESH & THE GET FRESH CREW ‘Keep Risin’ To The Top’ (US Reality D-3101)\n\nSlinkily jogging (0-)95½-95⅙-94bpm wordy rap based ultra strongly on Keni Burke’s ‘Risin’ To The Top’ and a bit of Heatwave’s ‘Ain’t No Half-Steppin’’ (instrumental too), flipped by the ‘Woody Woodpecker’ theme-introed funky drummered though oddly frantic 0-114½bpm ‘Guess? Who?‘ (in four mixes). Him? Hot?\n\n3-D ‘From Da Giddy-Up’ (US Hilltop Hustlers HTH-004)\n\nSteady B co-produced jiggly James Brown groove-based 109bpm fast talking Philly rap (108⅚bpm Instrumental), coupled just as strongly with the differently JB-based but similar 112⅙bpm ‘Once More You Hear The Dope Stuff‘, a denser variation on the 112⅓bpm ‘Chuck Chillout (Dope Mix)’ and its 111⅚bpm Instrumental, all with rebellious intensity to get you on the good foot. Is the credited DJ Tat Money really Cash?\n\nTHE SHE ROCKERS ‘Give It A Rest’ (Music Of Life NOTE 14)\n\nDrily “bass” juddering 102⅓bpm young females’ rap jitterer produced by Professor Gnff of Public Enemy and scratched by Streets Ahead (in four mixes), so its street credentials couldn’t be better… even if the track could!\n\nANTONIO VALESQUEZ & WOLFGANG PRINZ ’15 Minutes’ (Casa, via 01-393 4944)\n\nCredited to its producers although the actual act could be called Casa, this synth weazled simple nagging good lively Bam Bam-ish 124½bpm acid house instrumental has a girl periodically intoning “fifteen minutes” (and “your time is up”) on one side, not on the other!\n\nCLICK (featuring DJ Gold and Tony T) ‘Freq. Jam/Straight To The Phreek’ (Pure Records PURE T12)\n\nThere’s no knowing the actual title on unhelpful white label although both these have been quoted for this rather good jaunty (0-)122bpm house bubbler overlaid by resonant organ chords, muttering, and some tinkling piano in two mixes, with a less danceable acid synth twittered 122⅓bpm flip (also two mixes).\n\nMANTRONIX ‘In Full Effect’ (US Capitol CI-48336)\n\nAn initially disappointing album although its good points grow on one, this has the fast talking (to the tune of Chuck Berry’s ‘Maybelline’) jiggly 96⅔bpm ‘Gangster Boogie’, frenetically jittery juddering 95½bpm ‘In Full Effect‘, juddery scratching instrumental 0-99⅙bpm ‘Do You Like…Mantronik (?)‘, scratch technique crammed (0-)99-101⅔-97-99⅓-97⅓-100½-95bpm ‘Mega-Mix (’88)‘, crowd noises accompanied wriggly jogging 95-0bpm ‘Join Me Please (Home Boys-Make Some Noise)‘, bass boomed strolling 0-87bpm ‘Get Stupid (Part III)‘, romantically talking piano tinkled lurching slow 76bpm ‘Love Letter (Dear Tracy)’, guitar splurged jittery thudding 100bpm ‘Simple Simon (You Gotta Regard)’, and violently scratched urgently lurching (0-)98⅔-0bpm ‘Sing A Song (Break It Down)’ (sounding stronger now than it did in isolation on 12 inch).\n\nCHIC ‘Good Times (Extended Version)’ (Atlantic A9107T)\n\nBrand new chugging 113⅔bpm remix by the Jolley Harris Jolley production team, with over-dubbed fluttery rhythm and tinkling piano, flipped by both 1979’s original mix (irritatingly still the speeded up 117-117½bpm version that for some reason was put on UK 12 inch back then, far faster than the better US, and LP, tempo on which everything like ‘Rappers Delight’ became based), and by the gentle dreamy 64-68¼bpm ‘A Warm Summer Night’.\n\nBB&Q BAND ‘On The Beat (87 Bronx Mix)’ (German Streetheat STH 529 MEGA)\n\nPresumably out on the continent last year, this very Sister Sledge/Chic-ish jiggly smacking cleanly striding 119bpm remix is well worth finding now (less resonantly rounded 119bpm Original Mix, and datedly wriggling staccato 120bpm ‘Starlette’, too).\n\nPOP DANCE\n\nCEEJAY ‘A Little Love (What’s Going On)’ (US Next Plateau NP50074), very bright double Dutch (The Limit-created/Ben Liebrand-remixed) friskily tumbling Bananarama/Mel & Kim-like canterer;\n\nBUNKER KRU ‘Set It Off (Bunker ’88 Mix — Pink Ink Mix)’ (Champion CHAMP R12-64), now retaining just the Harlequin Fours female vocal, this busily cluttered bass bombing (0-)110bpm remake turns out to be a vehicle for the PWL Studios crew of Phil Harding, Ian Curnow and the Extra Beat Boys (Yo Yo & Jamie), with a thudding instrumental 110¾-111bpm Grey Ink Mix flip;\n\nThe DTI ‘Keep This Frequency Clear’ (Premiere UK ERET-501, via PRT), piano jangled datedly clichéd 0-114⅓bpm UK “jack-jack” track lifting a line from ‘Beat Dis’;\n\nCAPPELLA ‘Push The Beat’ (Fastglobe Records 12FGL 1, via PRT), another M|A|R|R|S-copying (0-)117¼-0bpm bounder (called ‘Bauhaus’ in its original European mix);\n\nELLERT ‘Love Lies’ (RCA PT 41788), Phil Harding-produced Johnny Hates Jazz-ish 0-117bpm muddled canterer, originally promoed in its far stronger totally different Mel & Kim-ish B-side’s House On The Hill mixes;\n\nJERMAINE STEWART ‘Get Lucky (Extended Remix)’ (Siren SRNT 82), Phil Harding again adds his bouncy ‘Casanova’ beat to a cheerful 104⅔bpm chugger, actually co-penned (with Errol Brown) by Simon Climie – whose own ‘Rise To The Occasion’ of course was helped no end by the same beat!;\n\nTHE FUNKREW ‘Bad Bad Boy’ (Arista 609 756), strolling bass rolled ultra-bouncy 90⅚bpm emphatically chanted jiggler, produced by Steve Levine though more like Phil Harding’s Climie Fisher style, with a completely slowed down lovely old fashioned bluesy 0-85/42½bpm Sophisticated Version too, worth hearing;\n\nJODY WATLEY ‘Some Kind Of Lover’ (MCA Records MCAT 1236), Madonna-pitched catchy chugging 118¾bpm jitterer;\n\nDEBBIE GIBSON ‘Only In My Dreams’ (Atlantic A9322T), wriggly 125bpm leaper, now likely at last to be as big here as it has been everywhere else;\n\nTAYLOR DAYNE ‘Prove Your Love (Extended Remix)’ (Arista 609830), electronically chording routine dated jittery 119¼bpm Miami disco judderer with rock guitar;\n\nTHE COVER GIRLS ‘Because Of You’ (Ton Son Ton SONL 2, via PRT), Cole & Clivilles co-created jittery shrill 0-119⅓-0bpm Miami-style squawker;\n\nTHE ART OF NOISE ‘Dragnet (Art Of Noise ’88 12” Mix)’ (China CHINAX 4), percussively thudding (0-1119½-0bpm jittery churning instrumental with ‘White Lines’ bass and stuttery soundtrack samples, flipped by a piano jangled looser (0-)120¾-0bpm Arthur Baker House Mix.\n\nREMIXES\n\nWEE PAPA GIRL RAPPERS ‘Faith’ (Jive JIVE R 164) is in a political speech and philosophy overlaid beefily bouncy 0-105⅙bpm Streets Ahead remix flipped by Cutmaster Swift’s also 0-105⅙bpm scratch mix (in a mad surfeit of creative marketing, a Simon Harris remix will also be a seven inch-only B-side and a Jon Williams remix in a limited edition of 500);\n\nGLEN GOLDSMITH ‘Dreaming (Up All Night Mix)’ (RCA PT41712R), as forecast, is a far better more densely throbbing jittery 104⅙bpm dance mix with punchier bass, saxist Mike Stevens’ piano propelling the flip’s previously promo-only slinkily jiggling, by coincidence, also 104⅙bpm instrumental ‘I Won’t Cry (Back Yardie Mix)’;\n\nTONGUE IN CHEEK ‘Nobody (Can Love Me) (Live In Little Venice)’ (Criminal Records BUSTR6) is a Total Contrast created crowd surrounded and James Brown-cutting 107½bpm still wriggly remix;\n\nPEBBLES ‘Girlfriend (Dance Remix)’ (MCA Records MCAX 1233, as omitted last week, is a much less catchy – if “harder” – over gimmicky staccato jerky 118½bpm dubwise version;\n\nSOHO ‘Piece Of You (Extended Arcade Remix)’ (Hedd Records HEDD1 13) is still (0-)128bpm with yowling guitar;\n\nROBE ‘Turn On The Moon (Moonmix)’ (2000 AD Records ROBETR1), if anyone cares, is more percussively chugging at (0-)113-0bpm.\n\nTHE CLUB
