Atlantic Records holds a 40th Anniversary concert at Madison Square Garden with many past and present label artists including a reunited Led Zeppelin. Acid house music takes off in the UK. Motown Records is sold to MCA. Two fans are crushed to death during the Guns n' Roses set at the UK Monsters of Rock Festival. Rap/hip hop and alternative music continue their growth.",
