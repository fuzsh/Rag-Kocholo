        "text": "Bros – Push (30th Anniversary Celebration)\n\nImage | Posted on\n\nNicki French – Steal The Crown\n\nPosted on\n\nDon’t steal Steal The Crown! Buy it here (Energise Records)!\n\nSomeone pass me a kleenex because I am weeping teardrops (of joy) on the disco floor that such a magnificent song exists. Yes, subjects of her majesty Nicki French. She has returned and her dazzling new single, Steal The Crown, is worthy of a whole new bank holiday in its honour. The disco drenched extravaganza is a sumptuous mix of cascading beats, swirling synth sounds and decadent grooves. It is the perfect setting for Nicki to sing her royal proclamation amd take her rightful place on the throne. Written by lovely Charlie Mason and Mark Smith, the lyrics tell a tale as old as time about a usurper toying with a man’s affections just because he is wealthy / powerful. Nicki ain’t gonna take this lying down and the result is a delicious, empowered denouement as chic as anything you would hear in Studio 54. With eminently quotable lyrics, Nicki gives nothing less than fierce warrior princess with each word. Her disdain for the pretender to the throne is so exquisitely tangible that it positively radiates from each word she so beautifully sings. With a melody that dances with vibrant passion and a refrain that any Disney Princess would kill for, you’ll be shimmying along and screaming ‘YAAAS QUEEN’ before your first listen is over. Add to this inventive and exciting remixes from ace knob twizzlers, Matt Pop and Ricardo Autobahn, and you have a lush slice of contemporary 70s disco so vivid you can almost see Donna Summer doing poppers with Elton John. All bow down, the king has lost his crown. Hail Queen Nicki.\n\nHazell Dean – In The Name Of (2013 album revisited)\n\nPosted on\n\nBuy the Hazell Dean 4 disc box set here (Energise records)\n\nI like to think that whatever I do, wherever I go, the resplendent music of grand dame of pop Hazell Dean will be there to accompany me on my journey. It may be her glorious songs from the 80s that had me fall in love with her powerful pipes, but her more recent releases through the Energise label have me searching through my mp3 player for her contemporary fare on a regular basis. To remind folks of these noughties projects, Energise are releasing a sumptuous four disc set of Hazel’s past few albums with a whole host of extra songs and bonus remixes. It is a veritable treasure trove of riches (much like the triumphant Matt Pop set). As it includes the 2013 album, In The Name Of… (which was released five years ago), it seems like a great opportunity to extol the virtues of some of the highlights it contains…\n\nIn The Name of Love ~ the almost-title track to the album is as exhilarating now as it was five years ago. While the prominent beat and decadent synth riffs lure you into the song (alongside evocative piano chords), it is when Hazell starts singing that you feel the same thrill you got the first time you ever heard her voice. With lyrics all about the irresistible allure of falling in love (despite bad experiences in the past), the instrumental gives you a whirling vortex of disco majesty for Hazell to wrap her passionate, fiery vocal in. Whether her own song or other people’s music, this is a stark reminder that whatever Hazell sings, she always makes it sound like it was meant for her all along.\n\nThis Is My Life (Matt Pop Edit) ~ what an absolutely exhilarating blast the exquisite partnership of Hazell and Matt Pop make this empowering anthem. With percolating grooves and cascading rhythms, Hazell is far from going through the motions here. It feels like she is channelling every personal experience into the lyrics and this makes the chorus an explosive, cathartic joyous refrain. If you are not waving your hands in the air in emphatic agreement by the intoxicating middle 8 then you may want to check your pulse. Play whenever you need a little endorphin rush to boost your day. Absolutely magnificent.\n\nWe Belong (Matt Pop Mix) ~ I have a real soft spot for this song so am super protective of it. Luckily, Hazell and Matt don’t let us down with this arm-swaying, rousing call for unity. Whether you need it to soundtrack a plea for one more chance in a relationship, or finding your own family in this crazy mixed up world, the alluring beats will have you shimmying on the dancefloor. Hazell’s voice is like a hug from an old friend – she sounds absolutely liberated and full of optimism and hope. It is a sentiment that is entirely contagious, washing your fears away and giving you hope for a better tomorrow. What a woman.\n\nTrade Him For A Newer Model (Klub Kidz Mix) ~ Like a night on the town with your pals, this song is the wake up call needed for anyone who isn’t being treated like the rather splendid person they deserve to be treated like in a relationship. Hazell isn’t taking any nonsense and delivers the sage advice as if delivering a sermon from the pulpit. Ms Dean knows how to testify and if you accidentally scream out “AMEN” when she urges you to ‘kick him out and go searching’, you won’t be alone. Perfect for dancing away your frustrations (or memories of such frustrations) at 1am amidst the flashing lights and writhing bodies on the dancefloor of your local club.\n\nLove Pains (Klub Kidz Mix) ~ This song may be coming up to forty years of age, but it still sounds as fresh as a daisy. Hazell initially released this song as a single in 1989 – and that it didn’t make the top forty remains a pop crime. Imagine if she and Liza had gone head to head with versions battling for the top ten! Smash Hits would have imploded from the wonder of it all. Klub Kidz keep the intensity from the original mix but jazz it up with contemporary electronica and modern-day disco effects that make you fall in love with the song all over again.\n\nTop 25 songs of the week:\n\n25 ~ Linda Martin, Up In A Puff of Smoke\n\n24 ~ DNCE, Dance\n\n23 ~ Maroon 5, Wait\n\n22 ~ Erasure, Still It’s Not Over\n\n21 ~ Jukebox The Ghost, Everybody’s Lonely\n\n20 ~ Ben Davidson, Fallin’ In (NE)\n\n19 ~ Kim Wilde, Kandy Krush (NE)\n\n18 ~ Donkeyboy, It’ll Be Alright\n\n17 ~ Debbie Gibson, Pop Circus\n\n16 ~ Kelly Clarkson, I Don’t Think About You\n\n15 ~ The Fizz, Up For The Fight\n\n14 ~ Kim Wilde, Pop Don’t Stop\n\n13 ~ Debbie Gibson, Dance Dance\n\n12 ~ Shania Twain, We Got Something They Don’t\n\n11 ~ Smith & Thell, Dumb\n\n10 ~ Tove Styrke, Changed My Mind\n\n09 ~ Saara Alto, Monsters\n\n08 ~ Kylie, Dancing\n\n07 ~ Bleachers, Alfie’s Song\n\n06 ~ Swayday, State of Undress\n\n05 ~ Sound of Arrows, Stay Free\n\n04 ~ Alcazar, In The Name of Love\n\n03 ~ Steps, Dancing With A Broken Heart\n\n02 ~ Felix Sandman, Every Single Day\n\n01 ~ Kylie, Stop Me From Falling (1 week)\n\nClimie Fisher – Everything (30th Anniversary Celebration)\n\nPosted on\n\nBuy Everything here (Amazon UK)\n\nBack in 1988, the charts were actually quite diverse and catered to the tastes of many (rather than the Spotify playlist recommendation-soundalikes of the few). Soulful-pop duo, Climie Fisher, were part of a new renaissance of pop not only nestling in the top ten in the UK but spear-heading a new type of Brit-invasion in the States. Whilst acts like Bananarama and Dead or Alive had the hi-nrg pop market sewn up and Erasure and Depeche Mode cornered the electronica niche, Climie Fisher, with acts like Johnny Hates Jazz and Breathe, were at the forefront of the new sophisti-pop movement. Lush, heartfelt odes that felt timeless from the very first moment you heard them – and Climie Fisher’s debut album, Everything, was full of them.. Simon Climie and Rob Fisher (who sadly passed away in 1999) knew how to craft songs which gave the listener an emotional connection with the words and music – its no wonder their debut album scored four UK top thirty hits (as well as a top thirty US hit which lingered on radio playlists for months). Diving back into the album for this retrospective has been a real treat – and a testament to how well these gorgeous compositions have aged.\n\nRather bravely, their first big hit came at the most competitive time of year. Christmas 1987 saw the release of shimmering ballad, Rise To The Occasion. Now, in England the Christmas chart is like the superbowl of pop. Acts bring out the big guns to compete for the coveted Christmas number one (and drive album sales accordingly). That a relatively unknown act could get into the top ten during this maelstrom of releases was pretty impressive. But, then again, Rise… is a pretty impressive song and a great introduction to the duo. Lyrics tell the tale of two broken people coming together to mend each other’s hearts, whilst the instrumental gave a gently shuffling groove which provided a lilting backdrop for Simon’s emotive vocal. It was a charming and evocative combination so, in retrospect, no wonder that the British public fell for it (and fell hard). Its steady climb up the charts represents what a grower this song had – once you heard it, you couldn’t get enough. That was equally true of the follow up, the resplendent Love Changes Everything. Rarely has the devastating agony of unrequited love (something, as a dramatic teen, I was well acquainted with) sounded so glorious. The intensity and pathos in Simon’s voice gave this song real personality, whilst (once again) a mesmerising score enhanced the emotions through mellifluous keyboard melodies and compelling percussion. That chorus was manna from the pop gods – the type you wanted to sing all the live long day. Amidst a chart dominated by Kylie, Tiffany and Debbie Gibson it effortlessly became a number two hit (and solid smash in the States). Worth noting a few things here – the backing vocals were wonderful, really accentuating the melancholy of the number. Also, this song was massive in South Africa (where Rise To The Occasion had given the guys a number one smash). It may have originally stalled at 67 back in August 1987, but this was proof that a great song will always find its audience…\n\nThe success of Love… revived the fortunes of its parent album, Everything, which steadily rose from the debut position of 35 to settling comfortably in the UK top twenty. Keeping it there was single number three, This Is Me. Bold drums and piano that danced like sunshine on the water ensconced a vibrant vocal performance that was a liberating as the message of the song. Years after it was released, I would play this to give myself courage to more openly be the person I was – never easy to come out, but certainly not when growing up in a super religious family. The lyrics to this song were as empowering as I Am What I Am and (dare I say it) felt a little more real and organic to me, thanks to the little growl in Simon’s voice. I belatedly felt the song deserved a much higher chart position than 22 in the UK, but perhaps it was always destined to be one of those songs which accompanies people on their life journey, ready to nudge at their memory when they need it the most. The final single from the album was to be I Won’t Bleed For You. Despite the driving rock-influenced instrumental, this is actually quite the poignant number (perhaps the precursor to the heart ache he’s trying to heal on Rise To The Occasion). While it may not have been their biggest hit, it cemented the fact that this was a talented duo whose songs would linger long after the music finished playing. Everything on Everything is a musical gift to be treasured and revisited over and again. These four singles are just the icing on the cake.\n\nSwayday – Time Of Our Lives\n\nPosted on\n\nStream / buy Time Of Our Lives EP here (external link)\n\nI am a sucker for a top notch boy band so when one comes along with a debut EP that is truly exhilarating, I’m super happy. Swedish five piece, Swayday, are building on the success of their first two singles (Curious and State of Undress) with a five track EP, Time Of Our Lives, and it is an absolute doozy. The project throws the boy band genre expectations up in the air, spins them around and reconstructs them into something that is pure earworm. It takes inspirations from the world of funk, disco, pop and rock and fuses them all together to make a cohesive collection of tunes which will have you shimmying the night away.\n\nCurious ~ Curious is a song about the allure of undeniable attraction and chemistry between two people that seems to consume your entire being when it happens. The lyrics detail the longing to know and experience more about that person, while the insistent beat accentuates the intensity and ferocity these emotions can have. By focusing on the word ‘curious’, the lads make this more of an intellectual pursuit where the possibilities of a relationship are not just body, but mind and soul in equal measures. It is sung with just the right amount of magnetism, ensuring each word delivered is in symbiotic partnership with the buoyant rhythm that accompanies it. Decadent guitar riffs dance eloquently alongside thumping bass, whilst the hand-clap style percussion draws the listener into the song; whilst the chorus is manna from the pop heavens; a joyous refrain that lingers in your head long after the song has finished.\n\nLifeline ~ This song demonstrates how you can balance a contemporary sound with the vibrant timeless refrains the boy-band genre has been so well-known for over the years. Echoing synths and icy cool finger click groove underscore the aching, yearning vocal of the verses gives the song an aura of a person seeking something real in their life; adding the beat drop to the riveting chorus gives the song a depth and texture which takes you to church (with the Swayday boys as your animated preachers). It is just the right amount of suave without taking itself too seriously, meaning that the listener is effortlessly drawn into their irrepressible tale of wanting love and devotion against the odds. Oh, and that stripped back middle eight provides a real kick of emotion before the pop majesty of the chorus dazzles one last time.\n\nState of Undress ~ the lads second single presents yet another facet of the five piece through compelling rhythms, solid vocals and a chorus that simply soars. From the funk driven bass which propels the song into existence, the lads are full on soulful seduction which, alongside that addictive hand clap rhythms, makes their alluring statement of intent pretty hard to resist. The layered wall of sound that drops in the chorus is a heady treat that makes you giddy with glee. They have, rather smartly, been inspired by the modern day stylings of acts like Bruno Mars and Olly Murs. It is a melange of music that feels like they inject their own personality and passion into to make the genre seem totally Swayday. You are soon tapping your toes and shimmying to the dancefloor to express your delight through cathartic dance.\n\nGravity ~ Shades of Prince dance around on this evocative charmer, all about the intense desire that unrequited love can elicit when you are stuck in the friend zone. Collectively, they really shine in the mid-tempo setting, their individual and harmonised vocals glittering like lights radiating from a twirling disco ball. The melody and vibe burrow under your skin and it is easy to imagine this being played across radio stations all the live long summer months. I love a song that can so exquisitely conjure up images of what they sing, with the percolating instrumental accentuating the narrative. Music like this is what the word dreamy was meant for. Also, worth noting that all the songs clock in at a little over 3 minutes. That is all these chaps need to make a definitive impression.\n\nTime Of Our Lives ~ the EP comes to an all too soon close with the frenetic and marvellous title track. They really demonstrate the power of electric youth, giving a liberating anthem about seizing the moment and living it up – a message that resonates no matter what age you are. Convivial chants and a chorus which feels like the best Backstreet Boys song never recorded, and it all adds up to an intoxicating proposition which leaves you gasping and ready for more. It has been such a satisfying journey that your only option is to return to Curious and start all over again. Pay attention now, folks, because these guys are gonna be huge.\n\nKim Wilde – Here Come The Aliens\n\nPosted on\n\nBuy Here Come The Aliens here (Amazon UK)\n\nPop is not a dirty word. Lather, rinse, repeat. Pop is not a dirty word. Kim Wilde knows this. She has built her rather successful career on tunes that dazzle, delight and devastate (Four Letter Word still gets me after all these years). Following on from her excellent Wilde Winter Songbook collection, Kim is back with her highly anticipated new album, Here Come The Aliens. It is a collection of songs which infuses elements of pop, rock, theatre, glam and electronica; all influenced by stages of Kim’s own discography and knitted together with a narrative about the mysteries of what is out there in this great big universe of ours. Every track is worthy of being a single, meaning this is all killer-no filler thrills from the first Pac-Man dying sound effect to the very last beat. Strap yourself in and enjoy this exhilarating ride…\n\n1969 ~ Don’t change your frequency. You’ve tuned in for a blistering opening track which sets the standard for the rest of the album with impeccable precision. Bold thrusting guitars thrash seamlessly next to a compelling drum beat, whilst keyboard riffs put you right in the heart of the action, as if in the best sci-fi film from the early eighties yet to be made. Kim’s vocal accentuates the story she sings (that “here come the aliens” refrain is irrepressible and mesmerising), up there for delivering on point emotion and high drama with songs like Abba’s The Visitors.\n\nPop Don’t Stop ~ everything about this song is designed to bolster your spirits and leave you with a galaxy-sized endorphin rush of epic proportions. Swathed in a sumptuous score, driven by dramatic synths, beguiling beats and percolating percussion, Kim guides the mesmerising melody with enthusiastic elegance, injecting the narrative with a euphoric ebullience. Ricky’s vocal contribution adds to the texture of the song, making this a thoroughly enjoyable vibrant romp which lingers in your head long after the song has finished. It manages to be both timely and timeless, meaning this sounds great either played next to, say, You Came, played today or played in twenty years time\n\nKandy Krush ~ such is the fast paced world of pop that this song is already single number two from the album. It is easy to see why. From glam rock verses so vivid that Kim’s hair must be morphing into a poodle perm just from singing it, to the wall of sound that drops in the beautifully textured chorus, everything titillates and tantalises the listener. The ferocious guitar licks are there to create an off-kilter atmosphere which juxtaposes nicely with the sweet-as-sweets chorus. It is fair to say Kim seems in her absolute element singing this and that liberated feeling oozes from every second of this riveting composition.\n\nStereo Shot ~ “oh my God, its system overload” sings Kim during the fuzzy synth sounds that usher this song into existence. She’s not wrong. We’re only at song four of the album and already I’m giddy from the treats she has delivered. This is outrageous, audacious pop and thus, is utterly satisfying. This ode to excess and distraction is as loaded instrumentally as it is lyrically (a real benefit to this whole album is how the music serves as a symbiotic partner to Kim’s words). There’s something rather sensuous about the “pleasure/pressure” pre-chorus refrain; that Stereo Shot laden chorus with the octave apart synth sounds is the orgasmic icing on the cake.\n\nYours ‘Til The End ~ The album’s first mid-tempo track gives the listener a chance for a breather, whilst luxuriating in the lush arrangements that ensconce Kim’s soaring, glorious vocals. It is a song about succumbing to the unknown by taking a chance. The tingling anticipation and frisson of excitement of the lyrics is tangible in Kim’s vocal, so much so that you feel you can reach and touch it. The four-and-a-half minute running time really gives the music time to breathe, adding to the sense of time and space Kim’s voice so eloquently swirls around in.\n\nSolstice ~ the slowed down tempo continues on this exquisite, organic number. Gorgeous piano chords serve as the sole accompaniment to Kim’s singing during the verses, adding luxurious percussion and layered harmonies as the song crescendos and progresses. About a real-life teenage suicide pact, Kim’s heartfelt performance shines a light on a subject many find difficult to discuss or imagine until its too late. It is a timely and timeless production with an evocative middle 8 which proves no words are needed to convey your inner most thoughts and fears.\n\nAddicted To You ~ I’m addicted to Addicted To You. That scintillating groove is a compulsive as the obsession Kim sings of. It is easy to relate to the track – whether unrequited or reciprocated, everyone has had that passion for another person burning inside them. Kim makes the whirling vortex of intensity musical manna from heaven, a cathartic release for emotions you didn’t know how to express. She keeps you hanging on for every beat of this intoxicating number, a wild rush from start to finish.\n\nBirthday ~ Nu-wave realness and a pogo-groove are just two of things to fall in love with this song. All about leaving your inhibitions at the door and seizing the moment as it presents itself, this is a wave-your-hands-in-the-air-like-you-just-don’t-care anthem that you need whenever you are feeling a little bit blue. Certainly a cure for what ails you, an extended instrumental in the middle of the song has you kicking your heels with unfettered joy. Absolutely essential listening for any day of the year, not just the day you get to have cards and cake.\n\nCyber.Nation.War ~ The state of the world today is not a great one. Whilst advances in technology have bought us numerous benefits, there have also been significant downsides. The spread of false information across the internet is one of them. Having people attack you for having an opinion is another – and the central concept of this song. The pointed way Kim delivers each word, combined with the religious experience of the gospel infused backing vocals makes this a devastating denouement of those who bully on line. It is also an electrifying pop track with an indelible hook which deserves all the attention lavished upon it. Should be prescribed listening for anyone who thinks it is OK to denigrate and threaten people from their computer…\n\nA Different Story ~ Is there anything more infuriating than someone peddling falsehoods about you? This is the musical manifestation of that sentiment. Kim ain’t putting up with any crap and with guitar riffs that Bon Jovi would kill for, she is empowered magnificence delivering a fiery oration that would have anyone quivering at the other end of her wrath. It is positively crackling with attitude and energy – ensuring that, whether you need this song for closure on past events or it encapsulates what you are going through now, this is one jam that is gonna feel oh so good belted out at the top of your lungs.\n\nRock The Paradiso ~ An almost otherworldy intro precedes a Fuzzbox-esque track which continues the energy and atmosphere of the preceding song. All about leaving a legacy, Kim has proved time and again (and not just on this album) that she’s more than capable of doing that with each successive project. The song gallops along, sweeping you up in its peppy pace and deliriously delicious rock-opera instrumental. It is devil-horn fingers in the air as you embrace your inner Kiss and rock out with gay abandon. One of the joys of this album is Kim’s ability to take the unexpected and make it entirely brilliant. This is a prime example of this.\n\nRosetta (ft. Frida Sundemo) ~ The album comes to a close with this languorous, lilting duet. Both vocalists send you flying to the stars, wrapping their inspired voices around a graceful, hypnotic score. Shades of Kate Bush abound as this song brings the album full circle – not exactly a concept album, but a thread through each composition that makes this a wholly realised, sonic experience. Wallow in this last track, it’s a wonderful experience. Then, head back to 1969 to begin the adventure all over again.\n\nStitch – Champagne\n\nPosted on\n\nStream / buy Champagne here (external link)\n\nSometimes you are lucky enough to find a song that just stands out from the current herd of cookie-cutter pop. Today, that song comes courtesy of future superstars Stitch. This London based trio have crafted a real gem with their new single, Champagne. It is classic enough that it feels exactly like the song that would have provided the soundtrack to a pre-danger moment at The Bronze on Buffy, The Vampire Slayer. Conversely, it is contemporary enough to provide atmosphere to a scene where Archie ponders doing something morally dubious on Riverdale. It is exactly the type of music that you take a sip of and instantly want more. The lyrics detail a timely narrative of losing inhibitions whilst under the influence of alcohol, then refusing to take any personal responsibility for actions taken. It is a bold and provocative narrative that is delivered with beguiling mystery by the singers; the verses see vocals loaded with foreboding whilst the performance of the chorus is like bubbles rising to the top of the glass; an actual vocal representation of how seductive your drug of choice can be. The instrumental works in beautiful symmetry with the song to accentuate these themes. Stark percussion provides the heartbeat of the song whilst synths and electronica add a dark, haunting depth to this mesmerising composition. Add to this a video as daring and thought-provoking as the song, and the whole package proves this is one group who are forging their own path in today’s musical landscape. It. Is. Breathtaking.\n\nMarco Griesi – Back\n\nPosted on\n\nFollow Marco on social media here (Twitter)\n\nPop icon, Debbie Gibson, has long been an advocate for Electric Youth. Not only did this ethos spawn a 1989 hit single, she has gone beyond musical platitudes by working with other youthful artists (including The Party, Ana, Chris Cuevas) throughout her career. This dedication to the voice of the young continues through to this day – and bought to my attention the earnest, organic songwriting prowess of Marco Griesi. His single, Back, is a compelling composition which sees him tackle the emotions of owning up to a relationship mistake and desperately wanting to put it write. Marco penned the song himself and his yearning and fervent longing is evident in every personal lyric he sings. There is an intensity to both his songwriting and performance that gives him a wisdom beyond his years – and a universal appeal, for who among us hasn’t felt guilt and the burning desire to put it right? Produced by Debbie with Don Chaffin has ensured that each second of the instrumental feels like an extension of the narrative. During the verses, there is a feisty, strumming guitar which is accompanied by a propulsive beat – both adding to the energy of the song. It makes the drop into the chorus that much more satisfying, when a full band kicks in (and can I hear strings in the background?) delivering an intoxicating wall of sound. Marco’s voice remains the central point of the music but his symbiotic link with the musicians gives the song more texture and depth. In a world where hits are conjured up with studio wizardry, it is actually refreshing to listen to music that feels like it would sound enormous on a live stage.

Too much like the debut single that thrust them into the spotlight and people wonder if they are a one trick pony; too far away from the sound that bought in their burgeoning fan base and they risk alienating folk who bought into their initial vision. Luckily, new Energise recording artist, Ben Davidson, manages this transition beautifully on his lush, second single Fallin’ In. Like Steps (5-6-7-8/Last Thing On My Mind), The Killers (Mr Brightside/Somebody Told Me) and Mariah Carey (Vision of Love/Love Takes Time) before him, Ben has poured his heart and soul into a song that takes all the best elements of the still-lovely The Chain and reconstructs them for this Noel Cohen, Joey Auch & Gail Vareilles penned insta-classic. Produced by the insanely talented Daniel Volpe, Ben takes the narrative about opening up your heart to the possibility of love and infuses it with an optimistic yearning so vibrant that it surely must come from a place of personal experience. With an intro that launches straight into the first verse, Ben’s voice is the focus of the track – reminding people that this guy really can sing. A prominent beat drives the song and emotions, with additional layers of instrumental being added through the song. This adds to the sense of intensity, with glorious piano, delicious guitar and elegant strings all swirling around each other and swathing Ben’s voice with a tangible energy. There are some really beautiful touches in the song – the stripped back moments after the middle 8 have these three elegiac piano notes which underscore Ben’s aching singing with a poignant melancholy; the listener, however, is lifted back up with a rousing finale of that indelible chorus and a reminder that “I know you’re gonna come for me”. In an era when music seems designed to replicate whatever is currently getting the most spotify streams, it is refreshing to have a solidly crafted song that lingers in your brain long after the music has finished.\n\n(Do check out the digital release for some stellar remixes. The FNK’D Up remixes add a deliriously addictive tribal-esque beat to the proceedings alongside increased tempo percussive grooves. It conjures up images of Ben in a nightclub, realising he wants a deeper connection than the fleeting flirtations the crowded dance floor can offer. It makes you want to grab the one you love and shimmy. HARD. Alternatively, the Handbag House Club Mix amplifies the midnight beat drop feel to the song that has you raising your hands to the sky in emphatic testimony. If FNK’D Up gets you blissfully chilled in the early hours of the morning, then this mix elevates your heart rate and gives you all the anticipation of the potential of finding someone in your nocturnal pursuits. Both excellent interpretations).\n\nStine Bramsen – You’re Not Giving Up\n\nPosted on\n\nStream / download You’re Not Giving Up here (external link)\n\nThe evolution of Alphabeat alumni, Stine Bramsen, continues. Her solo career continues to offer listeners evocative new compositions that show her continued growth and development as an artist. Follow up to the still satisfying L.A.C.K. is the devastating yet hopeful song, You’re Not Giving Up. Stine herself describes this new single as “a song about the psychological burden of trying to break free from a destructive relation. Whether you’re in a dysfunctional relationship or caught in an uneven friendship that is only bringing you down – getting out can be a long and emotional process when they’re just not giving up on you. Some people just keep luring you in… if you know that feeling, this song could creep under your skin.” She’s not wrong. Thanks to a beguiling infusion of electronic synths and beats, she crafts a musical atmosphere that swathes her emotive vocal in a persistent, addictive groove which mirrors the ethos of the narrative. The wall of sounds add texture as each chorus progresses – and it is this crescendo of blended pop perfection that gives the listener the impression that Stine sings to give herself the strength to extricate herself from this situation. The backing “ooo” combined with her increasingly ferocious vocal provides a glorious juxtaposition to the aching vulnerability in the verses. She tells a whole story with a nuanced performance where she says as much with how she sings as she does with what she sings. Utterly essential listening – and an empowering rallying cry for anyone going through a similar situation."
