        "text": "Hadleigh had been hoping to build on their promising displays in the league cup.\n\nBut they were bowled out for just 118 when chasing 210 to win to leave Soilleux a frustrated figure at the close of play.\n\n“After the good start to the season with back-to-back wins in the league cup Saturday was disappointing,” said Soilleux.\n\n“Things didn't quite go our way on the day but having said that we weren't at our best with the ball, in the field or with the bat so cannot apportion much blame anywhere but ourselves.\n\n“On the positive side it was only the first game so we have plenty of time to put things right, starting at Upminster on Saturday.\n\n“Judging by the other division one results it's clear that the league is going to be tight this year and that anyone can beat anyone.\n\n“Therefore although Saturday was disappointing, we'll put it behind us and focus on bettering our performance this weekend.”\n\nFives made 209/9 after batting first with Owen Lynch (3-36) and Sam Handley (3-45) the pick of Hadleigh’s bowlers.\n\nHowever, Hadleigh could only make 118 in reply, with Paul Tibbenham (42) the only player to score more than 30 runs"
