' LETTERS OF DENIZATION AND ACTS OF NATURALIZATION FOR ALIENS IN ENGLAND AND IRELAND 1701 — 1800 EDITED BY WILLIAM A. SHAW, Litt.D. Editor of ‘‘The Calendar of Treasury Papers ” ; Author of “ The History of Currency,” “The History of the Commonwealth Church,” “The Knights of England,” etc. % MANCHESTER 1923 MANCHESTER Only four hundred and fifty copies privately printed for the Huguenot Society of London by Sherratt & Hughes. 1417132 Prefatory Note. In the preceding volume to the present publication (viz., Denizations and Naturalizations, 1600 — 1700, Vol. XVIII of the publications of the Huguenot Society) I gave an introductory outline of the history of Naturalization Law so far as relates to England, Ireland and the Plantations from mediaeval times to the present. To that introduction Mr. Giuseppi has contributed additional material as far as concerns the Plantations in the eighteenth century in his introduction to his separately edited volume (“ Naturalization of Foreign Protestants IN THE American Colonies,” Vol. XXIV of the publications of the Huguenot Society, 1921.) For the present these two introductions carry the sketch of the history of the law of naturalization as far as it can be carried until further documentary material is available. It was my intention (and was so announced in the introduction to the earlier volume of this work, Vol. XVIII) to follow up the above introduction by a second one which was intended to take its place in the present volume and which was to deal with the religious history of France from the point of view of the influence of that history upon the ebb and flow of the various streams of waves of migration evidenced in the lists of naturalized persons. But that promise was made in 1911, and since 1911 the great war has happened and personal bereavement has come to me, and I am no longer able to carry out my promise. It would have entailed unremitting- study of sources in France and that is now precluded. I therefore send this volume forth shorn of such introduction, but it is probably none the worse for that. All that is necessary further to state here is that on pp. 7.2 — 77 will be found a full explanatory note on the episode of Oath Roll Naturalizations in the time of Queen Anne. The index to the present volume has been compiled by my sister-in-law, Miss Catherine Goldsbrough, to whom my warmest thanks are due. It has been a task of forbidding difficulty. Quite frequently one and the same person applied, firstly, for denization, and then, secondly, at a subsequent period for naturalization. In the first case his name is usually given in a Latin form on the privy seal or on the patent roll. In the second place, his name is invariably given in an English form in the private Act preserved in the House of Lords. Between the two forms there may be, and frequently is, the greatest variety. The problem of the index has been not merely to bring these variant forms together under one and the same heading so as to preserve identity but also to guide the modern searcher to the most probable equivalent modern form by an elaborate system of cross references. In such a procedure perfection is unattainable. But a really earnest attempt has been made to make the index really serviceable by such grouping and such cross references. With regard to my own editorial method, it is perhaps necessary to draw -attention to the fact that to each Naturalization Act I have prefixed, in square brackets, a legislative history of the Act, the preparatory petitions, the procedure in Committees, the successive votes in both Houses and the PREFATORY NOTE final assent. The toil involved in such editorial work has been heartbreaking. But it has not been resultless. Quite apart from the number of cases of private Acts introduced and not proceeded upon (and which are therefore not included in the House of Lords collection of private Acts, but which are rescued and preserved in the present volume), the Committee proceedings frequently furnish names which were put forward at certain stages and subsequently dropped, either for want of sacramental certificate or for want of payment of fees, or even because of positive hostility on the part of the Committee or of either House. I hese omitted names are all preserved ambulando in the introductions or in the footnotes to each successive Naturalization Act throughout the present volume. William A. Shaw. NATURALIZATIONS NATURALIZATION ACT. 13 Wm. III., No. 37. [Petition read 1 700-1 Mar. 22 for the bill.
