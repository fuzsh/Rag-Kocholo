We are proud that we work on the edge of what is possible and bring theoretical research to life. We are confident that our technology will become the worldwide standard for automated object inspections. Our team is at the forefront of the artificial intelligence revolution. If you're seeking to work with experienced professionals who are excited to create impact in multiple industries and if you like Deeptech, hardware and pushing some serious boundaries, then you're ready to join our team. What we do, really makes a difference. Amazing opportunities like joining AutoFill just don't come around every day. Be part of something big, from the early days.\n\nAt AutoFill, we have developed an automated object inspection system that automatically captures large, high quality multimodal scans from a vehicle in only a few seconds. We use Computer Vision and Machine Learning to optimise the quality and efficiency of the data collected, as well as to process the data into valuable information for our customers. With our multi-sensor solution, we are able to fuse the data from different types of sensors and from different viewing angles. With our systems deployed at customer locations, and our own test setup at our AutoFill Research Lab, we continuously generate large representative datasets that are used for the development and training of new AI models and algorithms.\n\nWith our automated vehicle inspection systems, located at customer locations in Europe, we collect thousands of datasets, containing images of vehicles, captured from multiple angles, using the RGB and polarization sensors. According to recent studies the polarization modality provides a very rich description of the abnormalities in very challenging conditions such as poor illumination and strong reflection (Blin et al.). We built our in-house data annotation team which ensures consistent high standard annotations. However, the process of data annotation in the world of AI applications needs a large amount of labour work. Your main contribution as a researcher is to investigate whether self-supervised learning in the domain of vehicle damage detection on the multimodal data can reduce the cost of annotation while still performing as well as fully-supervised models. The literature review of self-supervised learning proved model distillation opened a new way of learning which provides a decent representation using labelled and un-labelled data. In a very recent work (Koohpayegani et al.), a self-supervised AlexNet has outperformed the supervised one on ImageNet classification.\n\nWith this research project, you have the opportunity to work in a high-tech company active in building automated machine vision solutions for vehicle fleets and rail in close collaboration with AutoFill Technologies AI experts. You will also have access to large datasets of RGB and polarization images from different vehicles captured by AutoFill Technologies. Last but not least, you will have access to the Google Cloud environment for developing and testing of AI solutions.\n\nOutline of planned activities:\n\nTo perform a literature study on existing methods and computational models for self-supervised learning;\n\nTo select two methods and implement them in a software environment, using the datasets that are generated by the automated vehicle inspection systems of AutoFill;\n\nTo validate and benchmark the performance of the newly developed computational models, using the test setup at the AutoFill Research Lab\n\nTo write your report and/or publications.\n\nYou'll have to have affinity with programming and familiarity with python. A strong background and interest in image processing and machine learning is a must.

We built our in-house data annotation team which ensures consistent high standard annotations. In a very recent work Xiang et al. presented an Efficient Attention-bridged Fusion Network to exploit complementary information coming from different optical sensors. Specifically, they incorporate polarization sensing to obtain supplementary information, considering its optical characteristics for robust representation of diverse materials. Further, Ouali et al. proposed a cross-consistency training, where an invariance of the predictions is enforced over different perturbations applied to the outputs of the encoder. Such approaches help greatly to have highly accurate yet compact models for complex visual recognition tasks.\n\nYour main contribution as a researcher will be implementing a semi-supervised learning approach by leveraging various perturbations along with exploiting the supplementary information such as polarization data for a semantic segmentation task.

Experience with deep learning libraries (Pytorch or Tensorflow) is preferred.\n\nThe analogy between Deep Neural Networks (DNN) and human brains is traditionally evoked through the identification of artificial neurons in the DNN with neurons in the human brain. A Deeply Interacting Learning Systems (DILS) [1] develops this analogy further. Using Interaction Diagrams (ID) ([2]) as a common framework for both DNNs and Interacting Dynamical Systems (IDS), a DILS is defined as an ID with the dynamic re-wiring of a DNN and the non-trivial internal wiring of an IDS. In the broadest sense, a DILS proposes to move away from the discrete phases of learning, testing, and inference in DNNs towards a system which is continuously online. It also supports a more collaborative approach towards learning than a \"shouting\" match between weights and biases. In this way, we should be more able to understand the relationships between data as it flows through the learning system. Suppose that we have a supervised learning problem for image classification, where the problem is to classify images of lung tissue as either showing cancerous tissue or not. A basic example of the DILS framework would be to train a DNN with the added structure of OR gates to support classification in this problem. The inclusion of the OR gates in this case already furnishes the learning system with the knowledge that it is solving a classification problem, coming closer to how a human brain would approach this task.\n\nThis project will bring these ideas above to life, with the overarching goal to make more explicit and precise the definition of DILS. Along the way, the student should develop an understanding of the limitations and advantages of this novel approach over conventional methods for supervised learning, in their application to real-world problems. The ideas underpinning this proposed approach build on the foundations established in [2] and [3]. The project will start from a literature review. This will involve experimentation with the Python package [4] implemented as part of the work in [3]. Following this, several directions could be taken depending on the interests of the student undertaking this project. This might encompass a more detailed analysis and comparison of the framework in [3] against conventional neural networks and on a wider range of examples to better understand its advantages and limitations. It could also involve generating explicit descriptions of the simple examples of neural networks which are the basis of experiments in [3] and [4] in the language of Interaction Diagrams. At the conclusion of the project, the student should understand how to formulate examples of neural networks in these novel Category Theoretic frameworks, and be able to implement and experiment with these examples, with a focus on comparison against conventional implementations.\n\nThis project will investigate the optimal modelling methods to evaluate the effects of congestion control systems on 2 simple traffic scenarios; one macroscopic traffic flow fluid dynamics analogy, and one microscopic 4-way junction model. In the former, a student will examine a basic traffic density model representing a motorway section. A set of rules for traffic control will be implemented to understand the impact on various congestion metrics. In this case study the traffic density will be controlled using adaptive speed limits to suppress the average traffic speed to optimal levels. The objective is to maximise the outflow of traffic over the simulation's duration using minimal rules. The latter model involves the implementation of individual cars on a 4-way junction, with traffic lights controlling the flow of traffic in any direction. Cars will enter the junction from one of 4 directions and join a queue. Each will have a destination in one of the remaining 3 lanes, determined at random. The control system will have the goal of minimising the traffic build-up, in queues adjacent to traffic lights, by governing the durations with which red lights are held.\n\nThis project requires game theoretic experimentation to understand the effect on results when modifying the control system's behaviour. Students will be encouraged to decide on suitable congestion and wait-time cost metrics in order to evaluate the control system's performance. This project will most appeal to students interested in control theory, applied fluid dynamics, applied game theory, programming, and experimentation through mathematical modelling."
