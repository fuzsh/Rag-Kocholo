        "text": "Adbusters’ poster, design by Pedro Inoue, 2008\n\nRecently, I received a poster on a topic I care about, issued by an organization I respect. It’s a call-for-entries for a flag design competition being hosted by Adbusters, on the topic of global\n\ncitizenship. The jury consists of 7 judges, 4 of whom are contributors to Design Observer, and all of whom are capable critics, respected in the field.\n\nThe seven person jury, however, consists entirely of white men.\n\nNearly a decade into a new century, I believe it is unacceptable for a design organization, foundation, board of directors, magazine or other enterprise, to mount an initiative with an all male panel of judges — or, put another way, “white, native English-speaking men from the\n\nU.S., British Isles or Australia.” Such behavior is no longer acceptable and should not be tolerated by a community of designers (or any other community).\n\nDesigners around the world should just say no.\n\nThis is a competition for a flag to represent global citizenship — in this, the year of Barack Obama; the year of the 45th anniversary celebration of Martin Luther King, Jr.’s “I Have A Dream” speech; and the year we celebrate the 88th anniversary of the U.S. 19th Amendment,\n\nwhich gave women the right to vote. While the examples are rooted in American cultural experience, the principle — and the conclusion — remains the same: this is not the time for such limited vision. What winner would be proud of such an achievement, cast in these harsh terms?\n\nIn researching this story, my fact-checking led me to emails from jurors proposing a more diverse selection — some even willing to resign to open slots for others. Adbusters in fact published a letter in Issue #79 (graciously supplied to me by Adbusters‘s editor, Kalle Lasn) from Jan Olof Nygren,\n\nthat read in part: “Is there a reason for not having a more diverse and international panel of judges? I find it unfortunate when the competition is about embodying the idea of global citizenship.” One juror noted the entire episode is “a case of bad judgment, not maliciousness.”\n\nAnd, finally today, after a flurry of correspondence this week, I was\n\ncopied on an email from Adbusters which promised,\n\n“I’m making sure this happens. It’s our priority right now in the One Flag competition.” Adbusters is going to expand the jury, hopefully in more\n\nethnically and internationally representative directions. (If they need help, there is Jen Bekman’s list of hundreds of women for juries and conferences.)\n\nAdbusters has championed many amazing challenges in creative\n\nways. So I want to encourage Kalle Lasn and the team there for\n\nseeing the light. But how did we get to the point where a jury was\n\nformed with no representation from a larger, more diverse community?\n\nThis has happened too many times in recent years. One is reminded of “The Graphic Glass Ceiling,” as recounted by Michael Bierut; or the first year of the National Design Awards, when\n\n19 winners and finalists recognized 18 men; or Jason Kottke’s analysis of the lack of women speakers at Web conferences; or Tokion being called “one big steaming pile of misogyny” after previously having booked a conference with 28 male speakers.\n\nI’m writing this here not to further abuse Adbusters, but to forcefully argue that this\n\nshould not happen again. It is time for organizations to encourage\n\ndiversity as a part of developing new ideas, excellence and a richness in\n\nthe future of design — an increased focus on multiculturalism, gender equality\n\nand globalism is more than appropriate in these times.\n\nDesigners should take a personal pledge that they will not participate\n\nin events or initiatives that do not include participation by others, whether of\n\nsex, color or language. It’s a simple step, but it’s time."
