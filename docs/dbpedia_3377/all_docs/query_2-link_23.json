        "text": "According to the records of the\n\nProtector of Aborigines Department, at\n\nthe local Police Station, Jupiter was\n\nborn about 1861 which would make\n\nhim 84 years of age. He was one of\n\nthe only two men remaining alive\n\nwho were on Charters Towers in its\n\nbeginnings, the other being Sir Thomas\n\nBuckland, who was then an assayer\n\nat Millchester, and is now in his 96th\n\nyear.\n\nOn recent years Jupiter Mossman\n\nhas resided at Eventide Home, this\n\nprivilege being accorded him by the\n\ngovernment because of his historic\n\nassociation with the Towers. It is\n\npleasing to think that the last years\n\nof this fine old man were spent in\n\nsuch comfortable surroundings, and\n\nthat he had been so well cared for.\n\nCestas\"( the late E. G. Barry\n\nmore) wrote of Jupiter Mossman\n\non August 25, 1927:\n\nBorn in the centre of North Western\n\nQueensland, Jupiter; came as a small\n\nboy into Kynuna Station. That was\n\nover seventy years ago but even then\n\nwhite men were pushing out into the\n\nWest and the blacks were \"coming\n\nin.\"\n\nIn the late sixties, Hugh Mosman,\n\nhis brother Adam, and Mr Fraser,\n\neither took up orowned, Tarbrax, and\n\nwhile on a visit to Kynuna, Mr.\n\nMosman, taking a fancy to the dark\n\neyed, smart little stripling, \"acquired\"\n\nhim and took the boy back, to Tar\n\nbrax.\n\nGold was being won at Ravenswood\n\nat that time, there was gold, too, at\n\nthe Broughton, the Cape, and other\n\nplaces.\n\nFired with adventure, Tarbrax was\n\nsold toMr McIntyre of Dalgonafly,\n\nand, accompanied by the little black\n\nboy the party made for the Cape\n\nDiggings. The black boy was strapped\n\nbehind Hugh Mosman. No one knew\n\nor bothered about the boy's tribal\n\nname, but as his eyes were large, lum\n\ninous, and as limpid as a planet, he\n\nwas christened, or dubbed \"Jupiter,\"\n\nand as he ''belonged\" to Hugh Mos\n\nman, that surname, of course, fal\n\nlowed.\n\nEventually the party arrived at\n\nRavenswood, and while there, Mr.\n\nMosman grew to know George Clarke,\n\nthe intrepid prospector, and with\n\nhim and Fraser, decided on a pro\n\nspecting tour. Jupiter, of course ac\n\ncompanied them. So it came to pass,\n\nthat the little black boy, a child of\n\nthe stone axe period, the euphony of\n\nwhose soft syllabled name had been\n\nlost in the centre of Australia, he\n\ncame one of a band which made the\n\nhistoric find of Charters Towers, one\n\nof the premier goldfields of Australia,\n\na field from which was won over\n\n£23,000.000 worth of gold, the first\n\nauriferous stone thereon was found by\n\nJupiter.\n\nThat was in 1871. The small party,\n\nIn leaving Ravenswood, headed to\n\nwards the Seventy Mile Pinnacle at\n\n, Mount Leyshon, working wide of\n\nwhat is now Charters Towers; but\n\neventually it was decided to swing\n\nback, the high bluff, now known as\n\nTowers Hill, being selected as a land\n\nmark. It was easily seen, and the\n\nparty made its leisurely way towards\n\nit, naturally deviating towards the\n\nvalley, which separated the hills. Casual\n\nally they rode through the \"Gap.\"\n\ncamping on a creek on what is now\n\nthe town side of the hill. The little\n\nblack boy, who was never allowed out\n\nof sight of his master, while crossing\n\naround, was attracted by a stone, in\n\nwhich his microscopic eyes had seen\n\n\"color\". Picking up the stone, he\n\nbrought it to the prospectors. No doubt\n\nabout it, and what was more, there\n\nwere tons of gold bearing brownstone\n\nquartz covering the surface. A claim\n\nwas immediately pegged out and\n\nnamed \"The North Australian,\" and\n\nso rich was the quartz on top, that;\n\nover £6000 was won from stone picked\n\nup on the surface of that claim.\n\nThe prospectors were excited, but\n\nthey stayed on, and worked the show\n\nuntil January of the next year. Rid\n\ning into Ravenswood eventually, they\n\nreported the find, which was regis\n\ntered on January 2nd, 1872. \"the find\n\ncaused a rush, and, for once, the rush\n\nwas justified. Leases were pegged and\n\nworked and the field grew in impor\n\ntance, until it was a loadstone to min\n\ning men from the four corners of the\n\nworld.\n\nHugh Mosman and his mates made\n\nmuch money, but Clarke, once the\n\nquest was over, was not happy. He\n\nhad the wanderlust, the insatiable de\n\nsire of the old time prospector, to\n\nkeep searching. He was killed by the\n\nnatives in New Guinea, where this\n\ndesire had drawn him. Fraser retired,\n\nand lived in Sydney, but he did not\n\nlive long. Hugh Mosman stayed on,\n\nbut, having lost his arm while using\n\nexplosives, departed to Sydney. He\n\nTook Jupiter with him. He was then\n\na lad about nine or ten years old.\n\nThe boy was sent to school New\n\ntown, and afterwards to Lyndhurst\n\nCollege, Sydney, where he was bap\n\ntised as Roman Catholic and chris\n\ntened John Joseph.\n\nI do not know how he progressed\n\nas a scholar, but he learnt to play\n\ngood cricket, and football, and to run\n\nwell, but these accomplishments came\n\nnaturally to our blacks. They have\n\nsplendid eyes,'are quick to move, very\n\nactive and, for their weight, strong.\n\nJupiter became a sound to medium\n\nfast bowler, a good field, and quite\n\na sound bat. He had length, fine\n\nreach and was well-balanced ath-\n\nletic youngster. When he returned to\n\nCharters Towers he used to play\n\ncricket with \"The Queens,\" under the\n\ncaptaincy of Jimmy Carroll, and he\n\nplayed footfall with \"The Imps\" Ju\n\npiter could run, top, but was not a\n\nCharlie Samuels. He could run 100\n\nyards in 11secs, which was about his\n\nbest. Naturally, as a pupil of Hugh\n\nMosman's, he became a horseman,\n\nMost of his early youth was spent\n\non horseback, and as Mr. Mosman was\n\none of the old school, who liked to\n\nown steeplechase horses and ride them\n\nhimself, Jupiter learnt much, about\n\nracehorses and good class hack in\n\nthe old days. Mr. Mosman seldom\n\nopened a gate into his paddock but,\n\njumped his horses in and out, and\n\neven when he lost his arm, he would\n\nstill ride a horse at a fence, and Ju\n\npiter followed the lead. He had to.\n\nOn completion of his schooling\n\nJupiter was brought back to Char-\n\nters Towers. He was happy in that,\n\nfor there there is no stronger urge in\n\nlife, than that which calls a black\n\nback to his own country. When Mr.\n\nMosman decided to leave Charters\n\nTowers, Jupiter took to the bush, go\n\ning with cattle from Beaudesert near\n\nKynuna, to Wodonga (Vic.). The cattle\n\nwere owned by Messrs Collins and\n\nWhite, and a nephew of Mr. Mosman\n\nwas in charge. They took six months\n\nand five days on that trip, and never\n\nlost a hoof. Then Jupiter worked o\n\nLolworth, on Dotswood, in Rourke\n\nand Monroe's time, and used to rid\n\nthe fine big chestnut horses sired by\n\nold Collector. He worked on Wom\n\nbiana, and other places, prospecting\n\nwhenever opportunity, and the money,\n\npermitted. For some time he worked\n\nat Stockyard Creek with Soilleux and\n\nRoberts. His heart was always in\n\nsearch for gold, for like Mr. Clark\n\nhe had been infected with the pros-\n\npecting fever. He has \"run over\" all\n\nthe Peninsula fields, and is credited\n\nwith being the discoverer of several\n\nauriferous areas there.\n\nTime with its whitening hand, was\n\novertaking Jupiter. He was growing\n\nold too old to stand up to the rough\n\nwork of stockman, or the exposure of\n\nprospector's life. In his extrimis he\n\nfound friends in Charters Towers. A\n\nhouse was set aside for the old black\n\nat Eventide Home, among the old\n\npeople who are cared for there. Ju-\n\npiter is happy and content. \"I have no\n\ncomplaints.\" he said. \"It is beyond my\n\ndreams.\"\n\nAlthough 78 years of age, Jupiter\n\nis still a man of parts. Tall long\n\nlimbed, well set up, clear minded and\n\nsensible. Like most old aborigines, he\n\nhas natural courtesy and good man\n\nners. He is a person, a man who walks\n\nwith the ease and grace of his race.\n\nHe reads a lot, and without spectacles.\n\nHis eyes still have snap, and humor,\n\nand his laughter is ready and happy,"
