When used as noun, אָדָם means \"man\" or \"humanity\".[1][2] Its Biblical and Quranic uses have ensured that it is a common name in countries which draw on these traditions, and it is particularly common in Christian and Muslim majority countries. In most languages, its spelling is the same, although the pronunciation varies. Adán and Adão are the Spanish and Portuguese forms, respectively.\n\nAdam is also a surname in many countries, although it is not as common in English as its derivative Adams (sometimes spelt Addams). In other languages, there are similar surnames derived from Adam, such as Adamo, Adamov, Adamowicz, Adamski, McAdam, etc.\n\nIn Arabic, Adam (آدم) means \"made from earth's mud\".[3][4]\n\nTranslations\n\n[edit]\n\nAlbanian: Adam, Adham, Adem\n\nArabic: آدم (Adam)\n\nArmenian: Ադամ (Adam)\n\nBelarusian: Адам (Adam)\n\nBosnian: Adem\n\nBulgarian: Адам (Adam)\n\nChinese
