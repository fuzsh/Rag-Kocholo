        "text": "ONCE again, Malteenoes Sports Club all-rounder Kellon Carmichael churned out a good performance for his adopted Hadleigh and Thundersley Cricket Club (HTCC) in England last weekend, guiding them to a five-wicket victory over Wickford Cricket Club (WCC).\n\nPlaying at the John Burrows Park last Saturday, HTCC won the toss and asked WCC to take first strike, following which they were bowled out for 94 off 36.4 overs, with D. Etchells 26 and G. Jerome 21 being the principal\n\nscorers.\n\nAdam Soilleux took 5 for 17 and got support from Carmichael and David Williams who took 2 for 30 and 39 respectively, with Williams starting the breakthrough for HTCC when he sent back M. Nobes in the second over, while Carmichael knocked back the off-stump of Zimbabwe Test opener Tino Mawoyo (11) four overs later.\n\nWilliams removed L. Rouse without scoring at 29 for 3, before Etchells, who struck three fours and a six in his topscore, added 26 for the fourth wicket with D. Rouse (13) who became the first of five successive victims for Soilleux, after Carmichael dismissed Etchells.\n\nFollowing D. Rouse’s dismissal, Soilleux removed Jerome, D. Pryke (1), C. Desai (4) and A. Barker (0) in quick succession to wrap up the visitors’ innings, before J. Stead stroked an unbeaten 49 off 76 balls with eight fours and one six, backed by Carmichael’s 19 (26 balls, 2×4) to steer HTCC to 95 for 5 off 24.4 overs.\n\nCarmichael and Stead added 41 for the third wicket to guide their team from the precarious position of 12 for 2 off 4.1 overs to 53 for 3, 9.2 overs later, before Carmichael was caught by Nobes off Etchells. Despite the quick loss of Soilleux (0) and A. Holmes (8), HTCC got home with lots of overs to spare, as J. Went took 2 for 28 for WCC.\n\n(Calvin Roberts)"
