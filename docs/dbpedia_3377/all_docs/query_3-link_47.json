They regulate self-/non-self- discrimination, are key elements of cellular communication, cancer, infection and inflammation, and determine protein folding, function and life-times. Moreover, they are integral to the cellular envelope for microorganisms and participate in biofilm formation. These diverse functions of carbohydrates are mediated by carbohydrate-binding proteins, lectins, and the more the knowledge about the biology of these proteins is advancing, the more interfering with carbohydrate recognition becomes a viable option for the development of novel therapeutics. In this respect, small molecules mimicking this recognition process become more and more available either as tools for fostering our basic understanding of glycobiology or as therapeutics. In this review, we outline the general design principles of glycomimetic inhibitors (Section 2). This section is then followed by highlighting three approaches to interfere with lectin function, i.e. with carbohydrate-derived glycomimetics (Section 3.1), novel glycomimetic scaffolds (Section 3.2) and allosteric modulators (Section 3.3). We summarize recent advances in design and application of glycomimetics for various classes of lectins of mammalian, viral and bacterial origin. Besides highlighting design principles in general, we showcase defined cases in which glycomimetics have been advanced to clinical trials or marketed. Additionally, emerging applications of glycomimetics for targeted protein degradation and targeted delivery purposes are reviewed in Section 4.\n\n1. Introduction\n\nCarbohydrates are a class of natural products with wide-ranging functions in nature. As a central energy source they empower life and serve as an integral constituent of bacterial, fungal & plant cell walls and of exoskeletons in insects and crustaceans. Additionally, recognition of carbohydrates plays an important role in a diverse set of intra- and intercellular processes in health and disease.1\n\nThe main characteristic of carbohydrates, especially oligosaccharides, is their three-dimensional complexity. Monomers vary in ring size and stereochemistry and the synthesis of oligosaccharides leads to linear or branched products as the glycosidic linkage can occur at one or multiple hydroxy groups of a monomer. The coding spatial information of carbohydrates is further complicated by two possible isomers at the glycosidic linkage (anomers) and possible additional modifications such as sulfation, methylation or acetylation. Cumulatively, a staggering structural diversity can be achieved despite only a limited number of monomers being employed.2\n\nAll living cells are decorated with a matrix of glycoproteins and glycolipids collectively referred to as the ‘glycocalyx‘, that differs between tissue and cell types in multicellular organisms.3,4 Glycoproteins and glycolipids are conjugation products of carbohydrates and proteins or lipids, which can be further divided based on their linkage. N- and O-glycoproteins are most common, in which the carbohydrate is linked to the asparagine side chain and hydroxy groups of serine/threonine, respectively. On the other hand, phosphate-linked glycans or C-mannosides belong to the rare glycosylation types.5,6 As a further form of glycosylation glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors are used for extracellular presentation of proteins.7,8 A GPI anchor consists of an inositol phospholipid linked to a glucosamine, followed by a trisaccharide and an ethanolamine phosphate, to which the C-terminus of the protein is bound via an amide bond. After transport, the modified protein is presented extracellularly, being anchored to the cell via the phospholipid of the GPI. Apart from the role of carbohydrates as recognition motif, glycosylation of macromolecules is involved in protein folding, stability and activity regulation.9,10\n\nAs glycosylation, and therefore composition of the glycocalyx, is a complex, non-templated process sensitive to changes in the metabolic and biosynthetic microenvironment of cells, diseases are frequently associated with an altered glycocalyx.11 While the resulting aberration may aggravate or contribute to the progression of the disease, it also presents an opportunity for diagnosis and therapy at the same time. A prominent example is cancer, in which abnormal expression of glycans, especially O-glycans, serves as prognostic marker and plays a role in tumour growth and metastasis.12–14\n\nThe recognition of glycans by carbohydrate-binding proteins, the so-called lectins, is a key mechanism in biology. Due to the abundance of lectins, different classification systems based on ligand specificity, protein structure and localisation have been established.15 In mammals, inter alia calcium-dependent C-type lectins (CTLs), calcium-independent I-type lectins, named based on their homology to the immunoglobulin superfamily, and galectins represent lectin families with significant importance in the context of disease and therapy.\n\nA vital intercellular system that strongly relies on lectin-mediated processes is the immune system. Of significant importance in the innate immune response and early stages of an adaptive immune response is the CTL DC-SIGN (dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing non-integrin, CD209).16 DC-SIGN is involved in antigen uptake and presentation in dendritic cells (DCs), as well as regulation of toll-like receptors in a subpopulation of macrophages.17 Another calcium-dependent lectin with similar function of pathogen recognition and antigen presentation is langerin, found in a subset of epidermal DCs in skin Langerhans cells.18 Once an immune response has been triggered, another class of CTLs, the selectins (CD62-E, CD62-L, CD62-P) assist migration of immune cells to the site of infection19 and they are also crucial for inflammatory processes and cancer metastasis.20 Furthermore, the CTLs langerin and the asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR), an uptake receptor for glycoproteins expressed on hepatocytes, have attracted growing interest as targets for drug delivery in recent years.21\n\nOf outstanding interest among the I-type lectins is the family of Siglecs (sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-type lectins), which mediate regulation of the immune response. Consequently, Siglec-1 (CD169), Siglec-2 (CD22), Siglec-3 (CD33), Siglec-4 (myelin associated glycoprotein/MAG), Siglec-8, and Siglec-15 have been in the focus of glycomimetic drug development.\n\nThe family of the galectins differs from the previously mentioned membrane-bound lectins with respect to localization and function. Besides membrane-bound galectins, there are also soluble galectins found in the nucleus, cytosol or extracellular space. Diverse functions such as regulation of the immune system, pre-mRNA splicing, cell signalling, apoptosis, cell adhesion, wound healing as well as cancer progression and metastasis have been reported for members of the galectin family.22 Clinically relevant targets include Gal-1, -3, -8, and -9.\n\nEqually important, the recognition of glycans is also exploited by pathogens for infection. For example, viruses such as HIV,23 hepatitis C,24 SARS-CoV-225 or Ebola26 possess heavily glycosylated capsids and rely on recognition by host lectins, e.g. DC-SIGN, to facilitate host cell entry. The clinical relevance of lectins as drug targets is, however, not limited to mammalian lectins. Bacteria and viruses frequently employ own lectins for adhesion to host cells, determining their host cell tropism.27 Binding to host cell glycans and subsequent cell entry allows the pathogens to evade the immune system while providing the machinery or a nutrient rich environment for replication. Additionally, bacterial lectins are often involved in biofilm formation, a resistance mechanism shielding bacteria against the immune response and antibiotics.28 Consequently, these lectins significantly contribute to the virulence of pathogens and their inhibition with drugs is a promising approach to anti-infective drug research.29 The progress of drug development against the bacterial lectins FimH and FmlH of pathogenic Escherichia coli, LecA and LecB from Pseudomonas aeruginosa, BambL, BC2L-A and BC2L-C of Burkholderia species, as well as recent advances for inhibitors of Influenza A and C hemagglutinins are covered in this review.\n\nAdditionally, many bacterial and plant toxins (including ricin, cholera toxin, Shiga toxin as well as tetanus and botulinum neurotoxins) rely on lectin subunits to enter cells, where they exert their detrimental effects.30–32 Therefore, some of these lectin-containing toxins have also served as drug targets, e.g. Shiga toxin.33–36\n\nTargeting lectins is therefore a highly promising, yet underexplored strategy to develop new therapies against a wide array of pathophysiological conditions ranging from autoimmune diseases and cancer to infections and neutralization of toxins. Additional therapeutic value can be gained by exploiting lectins for targeted delivery of imaging agents, drugs or vaccines.\n\nWhile there is an undoubted importance of carbohydrate–lectin interactions in disease, only a limited number of drugs targeting these processes have been approved so far. One reason for this are the challenges during drug design posed by lectins themselves and their native ligands (Fig. 1). In general, lectins show a low affinity for carbohydrates in a micromolar to millimolar range.37–39 A major setback to high-affinity binding are the often shallow and solvent-exposed carbohydrate-binding sites (CBSs), as well as the hydrophilic natural ligands requiring costly desolvation upon binding. Cabani et al. estimated that desolvation of a single ligand hydroxy group requires 26 kJ mol−1, although carbohydrates may profit from a reduced desolvation penalty of vicinal hydroxy groups due to a shared hydrogen bond network (17 kJ mol−1).40 This cost of free energy is only partially compensated for by the formation of a single new hydrogen bond, which yields approximately 18 kJ mol−1 of free Gibbs energy.41,42 Consequently, each hydroxy group of carbohydrates must engage in more than one H bond with the protein to contribute positively to binding. Considering the high directionality of hydroxy groups and their interactions, as well as the close proximity of several OH groups in carbohydrates, these requirements for high-affinity binding are rarely met. However, the defined steric requirements for favourable interactions of the numerous OH groups also grant selectivity.\n\nAn additional feature of CBSs is an increased prevalence of aromatic amino acids, especially a 9-fold increased presence of tryptophan.43 Furthermore, it was shown that more electropositive C–H bonds of pyranosides engage more frequently in CH–π interactions. Because the electronic properties of specific CH bonds depend on the general stereochemistry of the monosaccharide, CH–π interactions may also contribute to selectivity of lectins. Nevertheless, the desolvation penalty associated with the high polarity of carbohydrate ligands offsets the gain of binding strength by hydrophobic interactions. High-affinity binding of carbohydrates is further hampered by an entropic penalty originating from a reduction of conformational freedom upon binding. Overall, lectins are generally considered challenging targets with a low druggability index.44\n\nA further problem of targeting carbohydrate-binding proteins is selectivity. As many different lectins recognize the same minimal binding motif, e.g. mannose,44 a poorly designed carbohydrate-based drug may bind not only to the intended target, but also to off-targets. To prevent adverse drug reactions from the off-target effect, generation of specific lectin–ligand interactions is key and special attention should be paid to target selectivity during drug development.\n\nThe targeting of lectins is not only demanding because of the low affinity interactions of lectins and native ligands, but also due to the binding kinetics and global pharmacokinetic properties of native ligands. In general, carbohydrate–lectin interactions suffer from slow association (kon) and fast dissociation (koff) kinetics. While optimisation of kon is necessary to improve binding affinity, optimisation of koff should not be ignored. High off rates equal to reduced residence times at the target, contributing to limitation of the effective drug duration and may result in adverse drug effects due to lower selectivity.45 A 2018 study by Fernández-Montalván showed a significant discrepancy in the residence time of drugs under development and FDA-approved drugs with longer residence times for approved drugs, highlighting the importance of koff for drug development.46 Additionally, the unfavourable pharmacokinetic properties of native carbohydrates are a major obstacle for carbohydrate-based drugs.44 In accordance with Lipinski's ‘rule of 5′,47 they often lack oral bioavailability by passive diffusion across membranes due to their polarity and active uptake in the small intestine is not guaranteed. Once systemic availability is achieved via parenteral routes of administration, degradation by glycosidases or fast renal elimination can severely limit the circulation half-life of native carbohydrates.44\n\nIn Nature, multivalency is frequently used to overcome the challenges of low affinity.48–50 Spatial clustering of receptors or expression of oligomeric lectins allows the simultaneous binding of multivalent ligands. In particular, the apparent binding affinity to each single binding site is increased via statistical rebinding or chelate effects.51 A striking example for the benefit of multivalency is represented by the human lectin DC-SIGN. While mannose as one of its monomeric ligands binds monomeric DC-SIGN in the millimolar range (KD = 3.5 mM),52 multivalent binding of the viral glycoprotein gp120 of HIV to DC-SIGN-expressing cells occurs with nanomolar affinity.53 Binding of oligo- and polysaccharides may also profit from interactions with sites adjacent to the carbohydrate-recognition domain (CRD), leading to improved affinity and specificity, as demonstrated by a 130-fold affinity increase of the oligosaccharide Man9GlcNAc2 for DC-SIGN compared to monomeric mannose.54\n\nDespite the mentioned drawbacks of native carbohydrates as pharmaceutical agents, a growing number of carbohydrate-based drugs is receiving approval.55Fig. 2 shows selected examples of carbohydrate-based drugs in clinical use. On the one hand, carbohydrates are common constituents of natural products. In these, carbohydrates may be encountered as modification of a large aglycon, e.g. in cardiac glycosides such as digoxin (1),56 or represent the major component, for example in aminoglycoside antibiotics, such as tobramycin (2).57 On the other hand, modification of native carbohydrates during drug design allows the development of novel carbohydrate-based drugs. The resulting compounds, referred to as ‘glycomimetics’, generally show improved drug-like properties such as affinity, selectivity or bioavailability. A class of glycomimetics with great importance are nucleoside/nucleotide analogues used in treatment of cancer and viral infections (gemcitabine (3)58 and remdesivir (4)59 as examples). The diagnostic potential of glycomimetics is exemplified by [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose (5) frequently used as probe in positron emission tomography (PET).60 In some glycomimetics, systemic distribution is not required, such as in acarbose61 (6) and zanamivir62 (7) due to a desired local effect. In others, a sufficient therapeutic effect is achieved after parenteral administration due to improved metabolic stability, for which the heparin glycomimetic fondaparinux (8) serves as example.63 However, even oral bioavailability can be achieved for glycomimetics, as proven by oseltamivir (9),64 topiramate (10),65 miglitol (11),66 and the class of gliflozine antidiabetic drugs (e.g., dapagliflozin (12)).67 Although not lectin-binders, these compounds seeing widespread use in therapy nicely illustrate that carbohydrates are suitable starting points for drug development. In this review, we focus on the progress of the development of glycomimetics targeting lectins in the last 20 years.\n\n2. Design principles for glycomimetics\n\nGlycomimetics are structural and functional mimics of carbohydrates that can replace native carbohydrates in their interactions with target proteins. They are designed to show enhanced chemical and enzymatic stability, improved drug-like properties (bioavailability) and the same or possibly better affinity and selectivity for the target. The most efficient lectin antagonists reported to date typically contain a natural carbohydrate or carbohydrate-like scaffold, which serves as an anchor to direct the ligand to the lectin CRD. One common modification of the carbohydrate scaffold is deoxygenation, in which the oxygen atom or hydroxy groups not essential for binding are removed or replaced by a different atom or group. These modifications often lead to changes in polarity, stability, conformation, ring flexibility and hydrogen bond patterns. Importantly, deoxygenation leads to a reduction of polar surface area, which may in turn enhance binding affinity by generation of new hydrophobic interactions with the protein and reduction of the enthalpic cost of ligand desolvation. The carbohydrate or carbohydrate-like scaffold is very often further decorated with other non-carbohydrate moieties that contribute to additional interactions with the target, thus enhancing the ligand's binding affinity and specificity for the target lectin. Furthermore, these additional scaffolds also decrease ligand polarity, and thus improve its drug-like properties. Another concept frequently used in the design of glycomimetics is conformational preorganization of a molecule, which has been shown to significantly reduce entropic penalty associated with ligand binding.68,69\n\nIn this section, we will classify glycomimetics according to their structural features and briefly mention their general characteristics. Some approaches to the design and synthesis of glycomimetics have been reviewed recently by Bernardi,70,71 Janetka,72 Hevey,73,74 Vidal,75 and others. While these reviews focus on selected lectin targets only, in the following sections, we aim at providing a comprehensive overview of the design and application of glycomimetics for most known clinically relevant lectin targets.\n\n2.1 Modification of the O-glycosidic linkage\n\nSince native O-glycosides are prone to chemical and enzymatic hydrolysis in vivo, a commonly used strategy to improve pharmacokinetic properties such as bioavailability and serum half-life is replacement of oxygen by an atom, which would form a more stable linkage, such as nitrogen, carbon, sulfur or selenium (Fig. 3A). Acylated N-glycosides are extensively used in the glycosylation of peptides, both natural and synthetic.76–78 In contrast, N-glycosidic bonds as an N,O-aminal between two carbohydrate units are relatively labile and therefore only scarcely described.79 While C-glycosides80 and C-acylglycosides (reviewed in ref. 70) are hydrolytically stable glycoside mimics, the introduction of the carbon atom leads to a loss of the exo-anomeric effect and can induce undesirable conformational changes. Thioglycosides serve as more stable analogues of O-glycosides owing to the fact that sulfur is less basic than oxygen and thus, an S-glycosidic bond is more resistant towards hydrolysis. Apart from showing various biological activities,81–83 selenoglycosides have been used as tools for the crystallographic investigation of carbohydrate–protein interactions.84–88 In addition, both seleno- and thioglycosides are used as glycosyl donors in the synthesis of oligosaccharides.89–92\n\n2.2 Endocyclic oxygen replacement\n\nReplacement of the endocyclic oxygen atom with nitrogen, carbon, sulfur, and phosphorus leads to imino-, carba-, thio-, and phosphorous-based glycomimetics, respectively (Fig. 3B).\n\nIminosugars are the largest group of monosaccharide mimics reported so far,93,94 they occur in nature and can be found in different plants and microorganisms.95,96 Iminosugars can be divided into two groups: monocyclic (pyrrolidines, piperidines, azepanes) and bicyclic (pyrrolizidines, indolizidines, nortropanes). At physiological pH, the endocyclic nitrogen atom is positively charged; iminosugars can hence mimic the charged oxocarbenium transition state of processing enzymes and have found clinical use as glycosylhydrolase and -transferase inhibitors.97\n\nCarbasugars (cyclitols) lack the typical anomeric reactivity, which leads to their increased metabolic stability towards glycosidases and glycosyltransferases.98,99 Moreover, replacement of the endocyclic oxygen with carbon prevents the anomeric effect and changes the hydrogen-bond pattern, flexibility and conformation of the ring.100 Thiosugars101,102 are more hydrophobic in nature than their oxo-counterparts and can sometimes show enhanced affinity through hydrophobic interactions with the protein.103 Phosphorus-based glycomimetics contain a phosphorus atom in place of the anomeric carbon or in place of the endocyclic oxygen.104,105 Three main classes of such compounds can be distinguished: phospha-, phosphono- (phostones), and phosphino-sugars (phostines, 1,2-oxaphosphinanes). The phosphinolactone group (O–P O) in phostones and phostines serves as a bioisostere of hemiacetals (O–C–OH) with phosphorus replacing the anomeric carbon. Fluorinated glycomimetics are also attracting ever increasing attention. Recently, it has been shown that replacing the endocyclic oxygen with a CF2 group can imitate the anomeric effect.106,107\n\n2.3 Replacement of OH functional groups\n\nDeoxygenation, i.e. OH to H transformation, leads to a reduction of polar surface area and thus, favours desolvation and may establish new hydrophobic contacts with the protein. Additionally, the removal of an electron-withdrawing group increases electron density of the scaffold and may make other OH groups more nucleophilic, and even strengthen interactions such as metal coordination or hydrogen bonding.108\n\nThe OH group can be replaced by its bioisosteres, such as F, OCH3, SH, SeH, and NH2. The high electronegativity of fluorine results in a high polarization of the C–F bond. The presence of a fluorine atom can increase lipophilicity,109 decrease pKa values of neighbouring OH groups, and modulate the hydrogen-bond donor/acceptor properties.70 Additionally, fluorine atoms as electronegative substituents destabilize the oxocarbenium transition state, which is present in enzymatic glycosidic bond hydrolysis.74,110 Etherification of an OH group is widely used to assess the binding requirements for ligand interactions and can sometimes even be a requirement for recognition by the lectin.111 Since sulfur and selenium are larger and more polarizable than oxygen, their introduction leads to enhanced lipophilicity, weaker H-bond donor properties and better π-interactions. However, thiol or selenol replacement is rare due to their challenging synthesis and redox instability. Finally, the amino group becomes positively charged at physiological pH, and therefore poorly mimics the neutral OH group.\n\n2.4 Addition of lipophilic fragments\n\nWhen designing glycomimetics, targeting peripheral regions of the binding site with lipophilic fragments has been often successfully exploited to generate new hydrophobic interactions with the protein surface. Representative examples are FimH antagonists targeting a tyrosine gate (e.g.13),112–114 Siglec-2 inhibitors binding a hydrophobic area through modification at C-9 (e.g.15),115 and Gal-3 inhibitors (e.g.14) interacting with arginine residues in the binding site (Fig. 3C)116,117 and will be discussed in detail below.\n\nTo this end, biphenyl moieties have become a popular scaffold in many glycomimetics following the anticipation that the biphenyl motif is a replacement for a disaccharide. However, the biphenyl substituent is frequently deeply buried in a hydrophobic cleft (e.g. Siglec-1, -2, DC-SIGN and FimH), being engaged in π-stacking and hydrophobic interactions that increase binding affinity. Nevertheless, in the case of FimH the biphenyl residue indeed occupies a binding site in the tyrosine gate that is normally occupied by mannose residues, although in a slightly different conformation.112,114 The biphenyl residue has also found application in FmlH glycomimetics, where it extends interactions within the binding pocket, thereby increasing potency.118,119 Furthermore, biphenyls have been introduced into MAG antagonists as scaffolds to position two Neu5Ac residues in their bioactive conformation.120\n\n2.5 Other approaches\n\nNon-carbohydrate functional glycomimetics are an interesting alternative to traditional glycomimetics. These are compounds that do not contain a carbohydrate scaffold, but still bind to the carbohydrate binding site and functionally mimic carbohydrates. Representative examples include catechols (e.g.16, 17) and hydroxamic acids as LecA inhibitors,121,122 and shikimic acid derivatives as DC-SIGN inhibitors (e.g.18, Fig. 3D).123\n\nAnother strategy to circumvent the drawbacks of carbohydrate-based drugs is targeting allosteric sites with higher druggability using a better suited chemical scaffold. Upon binding, these allosteric ligands modify the CBS, thereby affecting carbohydrate recognition. Recent experimental data suggest existence of such druggable secondary sites, especially in mammalian C-type lectins and galectins.124–128 Examples of allosteric inhibitors include 4-quinolones129 as DC-SIGN inhibitors (e.g.19), thiazolopyrimidines (e.g.20)126 as murine langerin inhibitors and pyridinylbenzoxazols (e.g.21) as stabilizers of the prefusion state of hemagglutinin from Influenza A130 (Fig. 3E).\n\nA further strategy frequently used, especially in targeting of bacterial and viral lectins, is multivalency, although mostly terminal native mono- or oligosaccharides are employed. Multivalent glycosides (e.g., glycodendrimers, glycoclusters, glycopolymers, glyconanoparticles) contain multiple sugar moieties and are designed to bind either one lectin at multiple binding sites or several lectins of the same type, promoting receptor clustering or aggregation. While these compounds usually show high affinity,51,131,132 they can also suffer from pharmacokinetic drawbacks due to their large size, high polarity, lack of oral bioavailability, and high likelihood of off-target effects and eliciting an unwanted immune response.133 Consequently, in this review we focus mainly on monovalent glycomimetics and only highlight those multivalent ligands that are of interest for our subjective focus. For details on multivalency, the reader is further referred to other reviews in this issue and elsewhere.51,131,132\n\n3. Inhibitors of lectin function\n\nLectins are attractive targets for chemical biology and medicinal chemistry and consequently a large number of approaches for the inhibition and modulation of various animal, bacterial and viral lectins have been pursued during the last 40 years. The most common approach is the development of glycomimetics based on the native carbohydrate ligand of the targeted lectin, and the more recent advances of the last two decades will be reviewed in Section 3.1. However, recent research has also led to the discovery of novel glycomimetic scaffolds devoid of a carbohydrate motif as direct binders of the carbohydrate recognition site and these are described in Section 3.2. Finally, allosteric modulators have now also been reported for lectins and their development is summarized in Section 3.3.\n\nThe various lectins of interest from animal, bacterial and viral sources will be introduced in the following sections when they are first described. Not surprisingly, a number of lectins are addressed by multiple approaches. For example, carbohydrate-derived glycomimetics and novel glycomimetic scaffolds have been developed for bacterial lectins, and C-type lectin receptors proved suitable for allosteric modulators in addition to carbohydrate-derived glycomimetics.\n\n3.1 Progress towards carbohydrate-derived glycomimetic drugs over the last 20 years\n\n3.2 Novel glycomimetic scaffolds for Ca2+-dependent lectins\n\nIn the early 2000s, the Kiessling group designed one of the first non-carbohydrate glycomimetics for DC-SIGN. The aim was to mimic the canonical carbohydrate recognition mediated by a central Ca2+ ion using a shikimic acid-derived scaffold.524–527 This core structure was supposed to provide a collection of diverse ligands for targeting a range of C-type lectin receptors. Interestingly, the shikimic acid-derived scaffold targeted the carbohydrate-binding site of DC-SIGN through the hydroxy groups at positions 3 and 4 similarly to mannose. Thus, it has been considered as a good mimetic of mannose for Ca2+-dependent lectins. Additionally, the carboxylic acid and thiols offer two potential points of diversification, which were exploited to introduce different substituents and to synthesize a library of 192 compounds. Their ability to compete with immobilized mannan for binding to the fluorophore-labelled extracellular domain of DC-SIGN was tested in a fluorescence-based competition assay. The best shikimic acid–based glycomimetic of the library showed only weak affinity for DC-SIGN (18, Table 4, IC50 = 3.2 mM525). However, the potency of the glycomimetic was later enhanced by three orders of magnitude following multivalent presentation (IC50 = 2.9 μM527).\n\nAnother class of glycomimetics was discovered for P-selectin by Revotar.528 A rational design approach led to the development of non-carbohydrate P-selectin antagonists mimicking sLeX. These glycomimetics contain the hydroxy groups in positions 4, 3 and 2 of an attached pyrogallol, intended to mimic the hydroxy groups of fucose. A comprehensive structure–activity relationship study provided the upper range nM inhibitor of P-selectin 161 (Table 4, IC50 = 0.57 μM), which showed high inhibition values up to 83% in the HL-60 cell attachment assay.\n\nA further example of targeting a Ca2+ dependent lectin using non-carbohydrate small molecules has been recently reported for LecA from P. aeruginosa.121In silico screening of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Diversity IV database and validation of hits by several biophysical assays identified catechols as ligands taking the canonical coordination of the central Ca2+ ion in this lectin. Notably, this compound class is also known as part of the pan-assay interference substances (PAINS529), which are prone to undergo unspecific interaction with proteins.530 Despite the fact that catechols can be oxidized to reactive quinones, Imberty, Titz and co-workers proved that electron-deficient catechols are stable under the conditions tested and in their interaction with LecA. Thus, catechols are not necessarily ‘bad actors’. A crystal structure in complex with LecA confirms the catechol 16 as a mimic of carbohydrates in Ca2+-binding. Similar to the LecA–galactose complex (Fig. 31A), the catechol coordinates the Ca2+ ion through two vicinal hydroxy groups, which mimic the 3 and 4 hydroxy groups of galactose (Fig. 31B). In particular, this catechol derivative forms H-bonds with Asn107 and Asp100 and the backbone oxygen of Tyr36. Even though this exemplifies that small molecules can coordinate the ions in the carbohydrate-binding site of a lectin, the Ca2+ coordination alone is not responsible for the binding. The nitrile group in catechol 16 plays a crucial role and mimics the hydroxy group of galactose in position 6. It uses a conserved water molecule (WAT1) to form a H-bond bridge between the nitrogen atom of the nitrile group in catechol and the oxygen atom of the carbonyl group of Pro51 in LecA. Its removal or shifting to the neighbouring carbon atom abrogated or decreased the binding efficiency measured by SPR and the inhibition in a fluorescence polarization (FP) assay, respectively. Despite the millimolar range binding affinities of catechols (16, Table 4), they bind tightly enough relative to their size (MW of 135–155 g mol−1) and number of heavy atoms (HA).531 Given the fact that catechols show ligand efficiency (LE) values of 0.4, they provide a good basis for future compound growing to increase their binding potency for LecA. Moreover, it was shown that catechols may target the carbohydrate-binding site of other Ca2+-dependent lectins, such as langerin. However, the mechanism of action remains to be confirmed for CTLs. Overall, electron poor catechols challenge the paradigm of ‘undruggable’ lectins as non-carbohydrate glycomimetics and show the potential of the structure-based design studies with the aim to improve their potency and drug-like properties as potential antimicrobial agents.\n\nIn another attempt to identify non-carbohydrate pharmacophores for Ca2+-dependent lectins by Rademacher et al., an NMR-based screening of a chemically diverse library of 1000 fragments identified a compound with a hydroxamic acid moiety that coordinates the Ca2+ ion in the carbohydrate binding site of LecA (160, Table 4).532 The structure–activity relationship (SAR) study revealed a sterically optimal presentation of the hydroxamic acid group as demonstrated by a crystal structure of LecA in complex with 160 (Fig. 31C). Similar to galactose and catechols, the hydroxamic acid moiety coordinates to the Ca2+ ion. In particular, the nitrogen and the two oxygen atoms form H-bonds with His50, Gln53, Pro51 via a water molecule (WAT2) and Asn107, Asp100 mimicking the hydroxy groups of galactose in positions 6, 4 and 3, respectively. Notably, the phenyl moiety of the hydroxamic acid compound 160 forms CH–π interaction with Pro38 that is not present in catechols.\n\nInspired by the novel scaffolds, Rademacher and co-workers explored the application of a metal-binding pharmacophore (MBP) library aiming to improve the targeting of Ca2+-dependent lectins.122 A 19F NMR screening was performed to compare the hit rates of three fragment libraries against four Ca2+-dependent lectins (LecA, LecB, langerin and DC-SIGN). Notably, the MBP library showed superior hit rates compared to previous screening attempts against these targets. In particular, 1D and 2D NMR studies demonstrated the potential of a malonic acid scaffold in targeting the carbohydrate-binding sites of LecA, LecB and DC-SIGN (162, KD = 1.2 mM for LecB and DC-SIGN, Table 4). Even though the group has demonstrated the Ca2+-dependency of these interactions, the binding mechanism remains to be confirmed by crystallography studies.\n\nAltogether, three non-carbohydrate glycomimetic scaffolds and an MBP library have been proposed to improve the targeting of the ‘undruggable’ site of the Ca2+-dependent lectins. Since these molecules are small (MW < 300 Da) and coordinate the Ca2+ ion, they are promising starting structures for the design of drug-like non-carbohydrate glycomimetics of lectins.\n\n3.3 Allosteric modulation of lectins\n\nAllosteric modulators have gained increasing interest in the development of selective and potent agonists and antagonists of protein function. While many drug targets share a common architecture of the primary active site with other members in their protein family, allosteric sites are less conserved between members of the same protein family and hence likely offer a better starting point for the reduction of off-target effects. Additionally, allosteric drugs can provide novel ways of action, such as changing protein levels, localization within the cell or even target activation.533–535 In this interplay between distal target sites, the mechanism by which orthosteric and allosteric site are coupled can be diverse ranging from larger protein rearrangements to alteration of vibrational modes of amino acid side chains that promote reciprocal interaction of the two sites.536 The concept of allostery in drug design has been widely and successfully explored for GPCRs and other intrinsically dynamic, allosteric drug targets and is more and more applied to other targets such as kinases, phosphatases and other protein classes with low selectivity.537,538 For carbohydrate-binding proteins, the concept of allostery in the design of non-carbohydrate glycomimetics has been investigated only sparsely, giving rise to new opportunities for the future. Allosteric sites can offer favourable properties for the development of functional glycomimetics, such as better physicochemical properties and the absence of competition with endogenous ligands, as highlighted for Siglecs (see Section 3.1.3). Here, we summarize information on allosteric mechanisms, how they were identified and how, if at all, they were put into the design process.\n\n3.3.4 Siglecs. For the Siglecs no functional non-carbohydrate glycomimetics have been reported, likely because no screening of larger libraries of drug-like molecules has been reported. The only exception is the peptide PV3 that binds CD22 and since this binding site is not occupied by cis-ligands the threshold for biological activity to target CD22 on the cell surface is lower.370 Consequently, a serendipitous discovery of secondary sites is lacking and allosteric modulation of Siglecs is not reported. However, flexible structural elements such as the CC′ loop exist, and their role has only recently been investigated in more depth and molecules fixing their position have the potential to serve as allosteric modulators. For Siglec-7, a second sialic acid binding site was identified, potentially allosterically coupled to the canonical site. Further studies will be necessary to elucidate structural details of the proposed allosteric mechanism and whether the site is druggable or not.594\n\n4. Novel applications of glycomimetics: receptor targeting\n\n4.1 The asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR) as target for drug delivery\n\nThe asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR), also known as the Ashwell–Morell receptor, was the first mammalian lectin to be discovered.602 As a C-type lectin, it requires Ca2+ ions for the interaction with carbohydrate ligands. It recognizes galactose and N-acetylgalactosamine and clears desialylated glycoproteins with exposed Gal or GalNAc as non-reducing end groups. The mammalian ASGPR is composed of two homologous subunits, major subunit H1 and minor subunit H2, that are encoded by two distinct genes. In humans, the subunits form homo- and hetero-oligomers with different receptor configurations, among which a trimer with two H1 and one H2 is the most abundant.602–604 ASGPR is primarily expressed on hepatocytes and minimally on extra-hepatic cells. It belongs to the recycling receptors and is endocytosed and recycled constitutively every ca. 15 min, with or without the ligands.605,606 Thanks to its unique localization and high expression of up to 500 000 ASGPRs per hepatocyte,607 it is an attractive target for receptor-mediated drug delivery to the liver.21,608,609 Diseases such as hepatocellular carcinoma,610 hepatitis B611 and C,612 and malaria613 are all associated with hepatocytes. Indeed, infection with HBV or HCV may lead to chronic hepatitis, which can cause cirrhosis and liver cancer. Therefore, targeting hepatocytes through the interaction with ASGPR is a viable strategy to treat these diseases.\n\nTwo approaches are currently being used: ligand-anchored nanocarriers and drug–ligand conjugates. In addition, RNA interference (RNAi) is becoming increasingly popular to treat a number of liver-related diseases. Four commercially available drugs are currently on the market: givosiran to treat acute hepatic porphyria, lumasiran for severe primary hyperoxaluria type 1, inclisiran for hypercholesterolemia, and vutrisiran for transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis. Targeting these drugs to hepatocytes exploits a trivalent monosaccharide ligand. This application paved the way for least 25 other drug candidates currently in clinical development, and most importantly, it opened the door for novel strategies based on monovalent ligands.\n\nSynthetic ASGPR ligands. A large amount of SAR data has been published for ASGPR ligands.21,614,622 As mentioned above, binding occurs through the interaction with 3- and 4-OH groups and the remaining positions are available for modification. It was proved that the anomeric configuration does not play any significant role in ligand binding.626 A trifluoroacetamido group in position 2 increases the binding affinity 3- to 20-fold compared to the acetamido group (178vs.179).614 C6 azido- and triazolo-derivatives were also stronger binders than the parent 6-OH compounds (180, 181).614 In 2017, Finn and Mascitti (Pfizer)627,628 published the bridged ketal structure 182 (substituted 6,8-dioxabicyclo[3.2.1]octane-2,3-diol) which was proposed based on the published crystal structure of the ASGPR binding domain (PDB code 1DV8).629,630 Its locked conformation allows for the interaction between the hydrophobic α-face of the pyranose and the tryptophan residue Trp243. The compound showed almost 6-fold better affinity than GalNAc (KD = 7.2 vs. 40 μM) and an excellent LE of 0.45.628 The binding mode was confirmed by crystal structure analysis with ASGPR (PDB code 5JQ1). In line with previous studies, the introduction of the trifluoroacetamido group at C2 (183) improved binding affinity fourfold. However, the non-fluorinated derivative 182 was used for in vivo studies because of an uncertain long-term metabolic stability of the trifluoroacetamido group. A trivalent ligand derivative of 182 labelled with the fluorophore AlexaFluor647 showed an impressive affinity with a KD of 30 pM. Internalization of the cargo attached to such a triantennary ligand was also confirmed.\n\nDrug delivery strategies. Galactosylation of polymers and lipids allows for the design of drug-loaded carriers for hepatocyte-specific targeting. A detailed review on Gal-modified polymers and lipids was published in 2015.21 In recent years, polymer–drug conjugates have been studied for the delivery of anticancer drugs to hepatocytes to treat hepatocellular carcinoma (for a detailed review on doxorubicin-based nanotherapeutics, see ref. 631). Polymers with a positive charge, such as poly-L-lysine (PLL) are delivered to hepatocytes thanks to the interaction with the anionic groups of the ASGPR binding site.632–634\n\nPK2 (FCE28069) is a copolymer based on N-(2-hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide (HPMA) with N-linked galactosamine and doxorubicin (DOX). In a preclinical study, the copolymer displayed a 5-fold reduction in cardiotoxicity relative to free DOX.635 A Phase I clinical trial study in patients with primary or metastatic liver cancer proved that liver-specific doxorubicin delivery utilizing a galactosamine-modified polymer is achievable.636,637 A biodistribution study showed that 24 h after administration, 17% of the administered dose of doxorubicin targeted to the liver while a doxorubicin–polymer conjugate without galactosamine showed no targeting. Although the dosage for Phase II trials was recommended, to the best of our knowledge, there was no further development of PK2.\n\nTargeted nanoparticles take advantage of receptor-mediated endocytosis to deliver a high payload of a drug to the liver. In addition, they protect the drug from degradation and enable the transport of both hydrophobic and hydrophilic drugs. Biodegradability of nanocarriers to non-toxic components is important to preclude toxicity. Hydrophobic nanoparticles are readily cleared off by reticuloendothelial system (RES), and therefore, hydrophilic or stealth particles are preferentially used, with PEG being the most popular stealth agent. While liposomes638 are the most widely tested type of nanoparticles, other types are tested, too, e.g. micelles,639,640 or dendrimers.641,642 Another strategy is the direct synthesis of covalent drug–ligand conjugates. This strategy is studied for example for the delivery of radiopharmaceuticals to the liver (for a review, see ref. 21).\n\nDelivery of therapeutic nucleic acids to the liver. A hot topic in clinical application of ASGPR-mediated targeting is gene silencing. The aim is to inhibit mRNA translation with short complementary RNA fragments. Antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs), which are single stranded RNA fragments, and small-interfering RNAs (siRNAs), composed of two short RNA fragments assembled in a double strand, are used to apply this concept. While ASOs bind to the complementary RNA directly and target its degradation by RNase, siRNA fragments are loaded into the RNA-induced silencing complex which then targets the mRNA for degradation. Ultimately, both approaches interrupt the production of the corresponding protein by triggering the degradation of the targeted mRNA.643 This approach has become very popular in the last decade since virtually any gene can be targeted by RNAi.\n\n4.2 Targeted protein degradation\n\nTargeted protein degradation (TPD) has opened many avenues for the treatment of various diseases and provided multiple routes to study fundamental biology.670,671 Proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs) are amongst the best understood applications of TPD, now on their way through clinical trials.672 Briefly, the approach is based on the application of a heterobifunctional small molecule comprising a ligand for an E3 ligase of the ubiquitin proteasome system and a ligand for the protein of interest, connected by a linker modality. Cross-linking the two proteins then induces covalent tagging of the protein of interest with ubiquitin and consequently leads to its degradation in the proteasome. One major advantage of this technology is the catalytic elimination of the target, compared to blocking the target occupancy. However, this approach is limited to cytosolic proteins while omitting about 40% of the proteome being extracellular or membrane-associated targets. Lysosome-targeting chimeras (LYTACs) make use of lysosome shuttling receptors taking over the E3 ligase function and set the protein of interest en route to the lysosome for degradation. It is not surprising to find carbohydrate-binding receptors to be the first to be explored for such an application: the 300 kDa multidomain cation-independent mannose-6-phosphate receptor (CI-M6PR, Fig. 45A and B)673,674 and the 100 kDa heterotrivalent C-type lectin ASGPR.675,676\n\nThe first-generation LYTACs, developed by Bertozzi, targeted the CI-M6PR to exploit receptor-mediated endocytosis of extracellular proteins into the lysosome (Fig. 45C).673 The CI-M6PR is a P-type lectin that recognizes mannose-6-phosphate (M6P) residue caps on N-glycans of endogenous proteins with a micromolar affinity to transport them from the extracellular space into the lysosome, a system that has been used for treatment of lysosomal storage diseases for a long time.677,678 At lower pH in the endosomal compartment prior to the arrival in the lysosome, the cargo is released and CI-M6PR recycles back to the surface resembling an efficient system for cargo uptake. Mimicking the multivalent display of M6P on a glycoprotein cargo for the CI-M6PR, Bertozzi and colleagues used a known multivalent, biocompatible, phosphatase-inert mannose-6-phosphonate (M6Pn) to showcase efficient and constant uptake via CI-M6PR in absence of receptor degradation.673 These polymers were conjugated to antibodies specific for soluble components of the extracellular space as well as for membrane bound receptors and led to their targeted degradation. The CI-M6PR is amongst a number of potential lysosome trafficking receptors that could potentially be used for the LYTAC approach. Other receptors might provide tissue specificity.\n\nIn 2021, the research groups of Bertozzi, Spiegel and Tang independently reported chimeric molecules with triantennary GalNAc for targeted protein degradation in the liver via the ASGPR (Fig. 45C).675,676,679 This CTL is not ubiquitously expressed as the CI-M6PR and is found primarily on hepatocytes with minimal expression on other cells (see Section 4.1). As a proof of concept, Bertozzi introduced a second-generation LYTAC consisting of a 3.4 kDa peptide binder linked to a trivalent GalNAc ligand that degraded integrins and reduced cancer cell proliferation.676 Spiegel, in contrast, focused on small molecule-based lysosome-targeting degraders. He called the heterobifunctional molecules MoDE-As (molecular degraders of extracellular proteins through the asialoglycoprotein receptor, Fig. 45C) and proved the concept by inducing depletion of an antibody and a proinflammatory cytokine.680 Tang further confirmed that lysosomal degradation of protein targets through ASGPR is possible by both small molecule- and antibody-based lysosome-targeting degraders. In addition, he showed that molecular size plays an important role and that internalization through ASGPR is more efficient for smaller degrader–target protein complexes.679\n\nAvilar Therapeutics focused on extracellular protein degradation and recently introduced the ATAC platform, designed to target diverse pathological proteins and exploit the natural ASGPR protein degradation pathway. ATACs (ASGPR-targeting chimeras) are bifunctional molecules composed of a ligand that binds to ASGPR, linked to a second ligand which binds to a disease-causing extracellular protein. The chemical nature of the ASGPR ligand used in ATACs has not been disclosed, and the company has synthesized hundreds of monosaccharide-based ASGPR ligands, out of which over 100 had a KD ≤ 1000 nM and around 40 had a KD ≤ 100 nM. In addition, they have over 20 X-ray structures of ASGPR–ligand complexes.681 The chosen ASGPR ligand has approximately 2000-fold higher affinity than GalNAc and >60-fold increase in affinity over bicyclic bridged 182. Compared to the previous generation of compounds682 which contained trivalent GalNAc ligands attached to an antibody, ATACs are based on bi- and mono-dentate ligands attached to a peptide or small molecule.683 For initial proof-of-concept studies, ATACs were designed to target two extracellular proteins with different concentration and kinetic properties: IgG (high plasma concentration and long half-life) and TNF-α (low plasma concentration and short half-life). The in vitro studies demonstrated ligand binding, ternary complex formation, cellular uptake, and degradation of the target proteins, IgG and TNF-α.\n\nTaken together, glycomimetics with a proper design to take advantage of specific receptor recognition, but also excellent endosomal release properties to allow receptor recycling and cargo release, will certainly be opening the way for many other lysosome shuttling receptors to be explored.\n\n4.3 CD22 targeting – Siglec-engaging tolerance-inducing antigenic liposomes (STALs)\n\nThe limited expression of CD22 on B cells and its role as an inhibitory receptor for B cell receptor (BCR) signalling made this Siglec an attractive target for the treatment of various B cell-associated diseases. The carbohydrate-based glycomimetics 6′-MBP-5F-Neu5Ac (15) and 9-BPA-NeuGcα(2-6)Galβ(1-4)GlcNAcβ-spacer (74) developed for human and murine CD22, respectively, were the door openers.115,685 As a first application, 9-BPA-NeuGcα(2-6)Galβ(1-4)GlcNAcβ-spacer (74) co-presented with nitrophenol as a model antigen on a polymer backbone was used to enforce colocalization of the BCR and CD22 leading not only to shutdown of BCR signalling and reduced anti-nitrophenol antibody secretion, but also to B cell apoptosis.685 In the next step, 9-BPC-NeuAcα(2-6)Galβ(1-4)GlcNAcβ-spacer (75), a ligand still lacking sufficient specificity for human CD22, was successfully applied to kill human B cell lymphoma cells in a mouse; however, still suffering from the unwanted Siglec-1 off-target effect in the animals.686 Conceptually, this work was key, since the delivery of doxorubicin encapsulated in liposomes allowed to draw important conclusions about the endocytic properties, alternative particles to overcome cis-ligands and the general principle of B cell killing through toxin delivery.\n\nThese findings were brought to a new level by implementing Siglec-engaging tolerance-inducing antigenic liposomes (STALs): co-display of an antigen with the 9-BPA-NeuGcα(2-6)Galβ(1-4)GlcNAcβ-spacer (74) ligand for murine CD22 induced B cells apoptosis in mice (Fig. 46A).367 Using a haemophilia model in which autoantibody production against factor VII would lead to severe bleeding in mice, Paulson and co-workers showed significantly reduced phenotype by antigen specific B cell ablation.367 Similarly efficient, the application of STALs showed great utility of this approach to reduce citrulline-specific B cells in vivo. Anti-citrulline autoantibodies are a hallmark of rheumatoid arthritis, an autoimmune disease for which the glycomimetic-based STALs showed applicability.687\n\nIn a recent follow-up, Macauley and colleagues have shown that changing the carrier from a liposome to red blood cells by direct insertion of the glycomimetic lipid conjugate, similar effects on B cells could be induced. Inhibition of cellular activation, reduction of cytokine secretion and cellular proliferation were achieved.688 To even further enhance the peripheral tolerance induction, STALs were co-formulated with rapamycin and using the model antigen ovalbumin it was shown that the anti-OVA antibody production was even more reduced compared to the common STAL formulation.689 To expand the application to human disease, the glycomimetic 6′-MBP-5F-Neu5Ac (15) was applied in a human CD22 transgenic mouse in a peanut allergy oral sensitization model.690 Together with previous data supporting the coformulation of rapamycin,689 the co-administration of STALs with poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid)–rapamycin nanoparticles (PLGA-R) induced robust peripheral tolerance compared to PLGA-R particles alone in a model of spontaneous autoimmune arthritis to the self-antigen glucose-6-phosphate-isomerase (GPI).691\n\nOverall, CD22 glycomimetics have been successfully applied in vivo in various systems to showcase utility and applicability for the delivery of various cargo to B cells, not limited to toxins,686,692 model antigens,685,689 immunosuppressants,689,691 antibodies,693 and RNA therapeutics (Fig. 46B and C).694 These molecules gave important insights into the role of B cells and the potential treatment of haemophilia,367 B cell lymphoma,686,688 rheumatoid arthritis,687 and allergies,368,690,691,695 lately also their application for cellular reengineering to allow natural killer cells to achieve tumour-specific CD22 targeting.696\n\n4.4 Langerin targeting\n\nLangerin (CD207) is a CTL expressed on Langerhans cells (LCs), the major antigen presenting cells in the epidermis of the human skin. LCs are sentinels in the skin, protecting us against incoming threats,697 and central for the induction of an appropriate immune response.698 As an innate immune cell receptor, langerin is uniquely expressed by LCs and is involved in pathogen recognition promoting the uptake of several viruses such as HIV,699 measles,700 and influenza virus701 as well as fungi702 and mycobacteria.703 Langerin is very efficient in pathogen uptake since it is a fast recycling receptor, similar to the ASGPR and hence holds promise to be of similar utility for cell-specific delivery of therapeutics.152,704 The utility of langerin-based delivery has been explored previously using antibodies and has revealed that langerin mediated cargo uptake leads to cross-presentation of exogenous antigens, important for anti-viral and anti-cancer therapeutics.705–710 In this respect, the recent development of the carbohydrate-based glycomimetic 189 for human langerin was reported.711 The N-tosylated glucosamine 189 makes use of the Ca2+-mediated canonical hydroxy group coordination of the 3- and 4-OH groups. It was suggested that the tosyl group is involved in a T-stack interaction with Phe315 in the langerin binding site, resulting in an overall affinity of 230 μM including additional effects coming from the linker at the anomeric position (Fig. 47).711 Overall, these interactions add up to an overall 100-fold affinity gain over the parent glucose (Ki = 21 ± 4 mM). Remarkable affinity gains of the N-tosylated glucosamine could already be achieved by bivalent display on a DNA/PNA backbone with optimized ligand spacing712 and multivalent display on liposomes or proteins leading to highly specific delivery to LCs.711,713,714 When a protein antigen was directly conjugated to multiple glycomimetic ligands, LC specific delivery could also be shown ex vivo in intact human skin samples, unlocking new potentials for therapeutical exploring LC targeting and modulating the immune system.715\n\n4.5 Selectin-targeting\n\nFollowing the success of glycomimetics in various indications, they have consequently also found use as delivery agents. Besides the clinically used ASGPR ligands, the use of carbohydrates as targeting ligands has been widely studied in numerous applications using nanoparticles, e.g. for the imaging of inflammation in the brain via sialyl LewisX-decorated MRI active nanoparticles716 or galactosides as mono- or oligosaccharides for the targeting of galectins.717 Using the above-mentioned advantages of glycomimetics over natural glycosides, this concept has also been implemented for the targeting of the selectins.\n\nSialyl LewisX glycomimetics have been developed for the production of E-selectin targeting liposomes.718 To this end, 33 (Fig. 6) bearing an N-acetyl group in position 2 of the galactose residue was modified at its carboxylic acid and coupled to the lipid 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DSPE). Then, liposomes have been produced and were analysed for their E-selectin binding and targeting efficacy in vitro and in vivo. Targeted liposomes were shown to bind to E-selectin in an SPR experiment while untargeted liposomes were devoid of binding. Similar results were observed when fluorescent liposomes were assessed by FACS for binding to TNF-α-activated HUVEC cells where specificity was obtained upon E-selectin expression, further demonstrating the targeting efficacy in a cellular context. Last, the imaging of subcutaneously implanted non small cell lung carcinoma tumours in mice was successfully achieved with those glycomimetic liposomes, suggesting future applications for the delivery of loaded drug cargo.\n\n4.6 Delivery of antibiotics via lectin targeting for P. aeruginosa\n\nBacterial infections are increasingly difficult to treat due rising antimicrobial resistance of the infectious agents and their additional defense within biofilms, e.g. for P. aeruginosa.439 Simply increasing the antibiotic concentration to break resistance and achieve effective antibacterial affinity is, however, not a tractable approach in the patient due to the toxicity of the drugs. Thus, one way to overcome this drawback is to conjugate antibiotics to targeting moieties for the selective enrichment at the pathogen inside the patient, either via siderophore-mediated uptake into the bacteria719,720 or through binding to their surface via antibodies721 and thereby increase the drug's local concentration for efficient killing. As a proof-of-concept, it was demonstrated that the LecA-targeted glycomimetic 116 conjugated to a fluorescent probe can bind and image P. aeruginosa biofilms.473 To implement the targeting, glycomimetics developed for the inhibition of P. aeruginosa lectins have been exploited as targeting units in three approaches (Fig. 48).\n\nFirst, the conjugation of LecA- and LecB-targeting moieties to the clinically used antibiotic ciprofloxacin, that suffers from rare but severe side effects, was reported.722 In this work, the targeting units were covalently attached to ciprofloxacin through a triazole ring and varying linker lengths resulting in conjugates 190 and 191. While the lectin binding of these conjugates was effective in the low μM range, the antimicrobial efficacy of the conjugates was reduced probably due to a reduced uptake to reach their intrabacterial targets, topoisomerase and gyrase. However, an enrichment of the conjugates at the P. aeruginosa biofilm and a reduced cytotoxicity of the conjugates compared to the free drug was achieved.\n\nIn a follow-up report, the linker was varied and the tetrapeptide sequence Gly-Ala-Leu-Ala was implemented as a scission motif for pathogen-specific activation by the secreted bacterial protease LasB to liberate the free drug at the infection site.723 The resulting conjugates 192–195 have been analysed for their degradation kinetics in various matrices and their antimicrobial activity. While all conjugates were stable in human blood plasma in vitro, they were rapidly cleaved in the presence of a P. aeruginosa culture supernatant containing the activating enzyme LasB. The degradation products from initial LasB scission were the lectin targeting moiety, available for blocking the respective lectin to weaken the biofilm, and a dipeptidyl antibiotic, which was further processed by plasma peptidases to liberate the free drug. Interestingly, the ciprofloxacin conjugates 192 and 193 were not fully cleaved into the free drug as a result of the tertiary amide at its piperazine moiety, resulting in reduced antimicrobial activity of the cleavage product. To overcome this drawback, fluoroquinolone derivatives with primary amides were used instead and a full proteolytic processing of conjugates 194 and 195 was observed and active drugs were liberated.\n\nIn a third approach by Titz and co-workers,724 the same LecA- and LecB-targeting ligands were attached to diacyl glycerol lipids (196 and 197) for incorporation into liposomes aiming at the delivery of unmodified antibiotics loaded into the nanoparticles. In an artificial biofilm model where the lectins LecA or LecB have been immobilized on an abiotic surface, it was shown that the targeted liposomes are specifically retained under flow conditions in a carbohydrate-dependent manner. Importantly, the binding was very tight as a result of the liposomes' multivalency which was demonstrated by the facts that for the LecA-targeted liposomes, 100 mM galactose in the buffer was required for displacement from the LecA surface, while for the LecB-targeted liposomes, even 250 mM fucose only partially displaced the glycomimetic liposomes and required the addition of EDTA to remove the calcium ions from LecB for full dissociation of the liposome from the lectin surface. Furthermore, it was demonstrated by SPR that the LecA-targeted liposome binding affinity is so strong due to the multivalency within the liposome that the dissociation of the liposomes from immobilised lectin is virtually absent. Thus, these glycomimetic liposomes constitute a promising delivery device for the targeting of antibiotics, which requires further research.\n\n5. Conclusions and outlook\n\nThe more we learn about the biology of lectins, the more this exciting target class will move into the focus of drug discovery. As of now, lectins have slowly emerged as targets for pharmaceutical treatment of a number of diseases, either validated by the use of therapeutic antibodies or the persistent work of the community to develop small-molecule mimetics of their natural carbohydrate substrates.\n\nCarbohydrates as natural ligands themselves have been challenging to promote into a pharmaceutical active ingredient. However, they are stereochemically rich starting structures with good ligand efficiencies, relating the low molecular weight of a monosaccharide and the affinity resulting from the high number of directed interactions. These often enthalpy-driven interactions provide specificity with respect to the many off-targets other than lectins themselves. Glycomimetics are not reported to have significant unwanted targets other than lectins. Still, within the lectins as a target group, specificity can be generated through the monosaccharide, by modification of the original scaffold only. Advancements in carbohydrate chemistry have made this compound class more accessible while still being challenging compared to other scaffolds. Additionally, while a growing number of glycomimetics has been developed into orally available drug candidates, several applications of glycomimetics are independent of oral application routes, similar to the treatment with therapeutic antibodies.\n\nTo overcome the limitations of maintaining the original carbohydrate scaffold, alternative approaches have emerged by replacing the sugar core by keeping only the most relevant pharmacophores to establish affinity and specificity leading to non-carbohydrate based, functional glycomimetics. Another approach that might lead to a modulation of lectins for therapeutic intervention are allosteric modulators as functional glycomimetics. These molecules might serve as antagonists or even agonists, via binding to allosteric sites, remote from the carbohydrate recognition site, rendering the necessity to resemble a carbohydrate obsolete. Our enthusiasm over this promising route to tackle lectins is fuelled by the advancement it brought to other challenging drug target classes such as kinases and phosphatases.\n\nInfection processes are inherently linked to carbohydrate–lectin interactions. This fact therefore provides a valuable starting point for the development of new antiinfectives. To this end, the rich field of glycomimetics in the discovery phase has already led to numerous compounds in (pre-)clinical development, especially for bacterial infections by E. coli in urinary tract infections and inflammatory bowel disease.\n\nBesides the intriguing biological functions of lectins in inflammation, cancer and infection, mammalian lectins are typically limited in their expression profile for defined cells, which makes them attractive targets for targeted delivery purposes. The ASGPR as an accessible hepatic receptor has spearheaded this development. The trivalent GalNAc ligand 22 has assisted to bring four drugs onto the market and led to numerous new therapeutics in clinical trials. Similarly, the CI-M6PR has been proposed as target protein for the development of LYTACs, based on simple mannose-6-phosphonate polymers that allow targeted degradation of extracellular proteins. For the future clinical application of this concept it will be helpful to identify more tissue specific, endocytic receptors with high expression profiles. These will be key towards the specific degradation of targeted membrane receptors.\n\nTaken together, we anticipate a prosperous future for glycomimetics to modulate biological processes in chemical biology research but also as drugs in a large diversity of indications.\n\nConflicts of interest\n\nC.
