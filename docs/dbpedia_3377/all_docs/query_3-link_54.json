        "text": "Eni x #CSDDD Only companies committed to the principles and values of \"Responsible Business Conduct\" have the courage to sign a document like this. Evidently, this corporate stance would never be adopted by the Italian oil giant. In these more than 22 long years, Eni has never done ‚Äúdue diligence‚Äù on my case. Even participating in the ‚ÄúGood Offices‚Äù ‚Äì from 2020 to 2022, offered by NCP Brazil, with the support of NCP Italy ‚Äì the company refused to carry out this procedure, neglecting and disregarding the ‚ÄúOECD Due Diligence Guidance for Business Conduct Responsible‚Äù. In the documents below present the facts, fully proven, about Eni's attacks against my name, honor and reputation, directly violating Eni's corporate commitments (such as the Code of Ethics) as well as the international commitments on human rights that the company affirms to the market that it ‚Äúaccepts‚Äù and ‚Äúfollows‚Äù, including the ‚ÄúOECD - OCDE Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises‚Äù, the ‚ÄúUnited Nations Global Compact‚Äù and the ‚ÄúUNGP31‚Äù. If you still have doubts about my case, I suggest you talk to the former director of the Eni Board, Mr. Luigi Zingales, professor at the University of Chicago. He knows me personally and knows that I speak the truth! Read more: 1) \"Fully proven facts known to the Board of Directors of Eni\": https://lnkd.in/eNuHg9cT 2) \"Chronology of Facts\" (2001 to 2022): https://lnkd.in/dsWhCMED 3) www.enisway.com\n\nThis a is a lovely and very short (30 second) article. Written from a Belgian legal perspective but still applicable and I think this line is king: ‚û° [C]ompanies not covered by the CSDDD as such may still be affected as a subsidiary or supply chain business partner of an in-scope company ‚¨Ö That's my big warning to all companies with a presence in Europe over the coming years, expect to be affected (read PLAN FOR) by CSDDD regardless of if you're IN SCOPE or NOT. https://lnkd.in/d4krMdYH\n\nOne year after the introduction of the German Act on Corporate Due Diligence Obligations in Supply Chains (LkSG), we can draw a positive balance. The law marks a significant step towards sustainable supply chains and responsible corporate governance in Germany. As of January 1, 2024, it applies to companies with more than 1,000 employees and a site in Germany. In our latest article, we analyse the progress made, reflect on successes and challenges and take a look at the future of these affected companies. (Link to the article in the comments) #supplychain #lksg #corporateresponsibility #ESG #sustainability #duediligence\n\nGiven the European Commission‚Äôs revised Guidelines on Horizontal Cooperation Agreements entered into force on 1 July 2023, our Golden Partner Crowell & Moring Brussels‚Äô antitrust lawyers have set out practical advice for conducting an antitrust assessment of different types of agreements between competitors. In this first alert in a series, Karel Bourgeois, Karl Stas, and Benjamin Geisel take a closer look at sustainability agreements between competitors, covering issues such as: ‚óæÔ∏è According to the European Commission, what are sustainability agreements? ‚óæÔ∏è When does a sustainability agreement fall within the scope of the cartel prohibition? ‚óæÔ∏è What considerations should companies make when assessing their sustainability agreements? üì¢ Stay tuned for further alerts in the series, which will delve into joint ventures, purchasing agreements, and the antitrust risks related to information exchange. #antitrust #horizontalcooperationagreements #europeancommision\n\n‚ùá * WE SUPPORT THE #CSDDD* The EU's Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD) has generated broad support from a wide range of stakeholders, including large companies, SMEs, civil society organizations, trade unions and many more. The fact that it's been hard to keep track of the different pro-CSDDD statements is telling of people's desire to hold companies accountable for wrongdoings in their value chain. üîî I can therefore highly recommend this newly launched website hosting different expressions of support by academics, businesses, unions, experts in the field, etc.: https://lnkd.in/dguEHeGb üîé Please have an extra look-out for the political statement by the Swedish parliament's business committee, which signals that the Swedish government stands behind the latest compromise text, despite initially abstaining in COREPER. Notwithstanding the gaps and weaknesses in the latest agreement, Sweden's support shows that even the most obstructive Member States can be convinced that this is what is needed to advance responsible business conduct. ‚úè Tomorrow, 24 April, MEPs are voting in plenary on the latest compromise. If adopted, the file will go once again to COREPER on 15 May and finally to the Council of Ministers on 24 May. As always, to be continued..."
