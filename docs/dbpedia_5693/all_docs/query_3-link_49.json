        "text": "Please tell us a bit about yourself (e.g. hometown, current locale, course of study).\n\nI am a graduate of Bellarmine University in Louisville, KY, where I studied Philosophy. I also completed the coursework for a Master’s Degree in Philosophy at Saint Louis University in St. Louis, MO. I am currently the Director of Production for Atla.\n\nDescribe some of your current responsibilities, and what type of organization you belong to.\n\nAtla is a non-profit membership association of librarians and information professionals, and a producer of research tools, committed to advancing the scholarly study of religion and theology. In my role, I am a member of Atla’s executive leadership team with strategic responsibility for Atla’s suite of bibliographic offerings and for new product initiatives. I also present at various international meetings and conferences.\n\nWithin the industry, I am Vice-Chair of NISO’s Board of Directors for 2021-2022. I am also on the conference programming planning committee for NASIG.\n\nWhat was your first scholarly publishing role? How did you get that job? What path led to your current position?\n\nMy first role was as an metadata specialist at ProQuest. I was curious about the industry and I routinely volunteered to work on special projects. I explored many different roles in my early career, including field sales and onsite product training. I found through these experiences that my skills aligned best with product development and production.\n\nPrior to joining Atla, I was the Vice President of Production at Alexander Street Press, where I was on the leadership team and directly responsible for the delivery of ASP’s products. Prior to ASP, I was the Senior Director of Content Operations and a member of the leadership team at Serials Solutions. My career also includes various product and project management positions at Gale, ProQuest, and Wolters Kluwer.\n\nIf there was a pivotal moment or key person in your career development, please describe briefly.\n\nInstead of focusing on one key achievement, I would say that the most rewarding and meaningful contributions I have supported were the result of true teamwork and collaboration. In most recent cases, I have been in a leadership role responsible for establishing the teams and promoting a culture of openness and teamwork."
