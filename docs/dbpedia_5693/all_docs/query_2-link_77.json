        "text": "This Progress Report…is later than usual. But this year…is unusual. With a pandemic affecting every major studio, network, and workspace in the USA and beyond, the dust is only now settling when it comes to what made it to a new season and what did not.\n\nTo that end, Couch Potatoes Unite! delayed all of our annual Progress Reports to make sure we are understanding the TV landscape in such a way that we would be able to effectively communicate it to you, gentle reader and listener. We think we’re almost there. There is quite a lot still unsorted, but the main five networks are trying to resume their traditional rhythms, and some of the other content outlets are attempting to follow suit.\n\nThus, we now present Progress Report 2 of 2021, the final progress report for the new pilots of the 2020-2021 season! Where are the new shows (that are left), and how are they doing nowadays? Read below to find out! Thanks as always to TVLine and to other sources for helping a girl out.\n\n*Note: with the expansion of CPU!, these initial thoughts are based upon the CPU! Chief’s assessments. As with last season, a growing number of CPU! members may find shows initially passed by the CPU! Chief and choose to review them. CPU! readers will be informed if the show’s status changes regarding coverage as the season progresses through the handy CPU! Progress Reports, and all written reviews will be published!\n\n**Second Note: If you haven’t already figured it out, we measure the TV year from June 1st to May 31st.\n\n***Third Note: Given the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the TV industry, the concept of “ratings weeks” was kind of moot this year. Also, given the glut of TV entertainment, we are hereby suspending progress reports for anything other than start of season, mid-season, and end of season. If this makes you sad, please let us know. We aim to please!\n\nB POSITIVE, CBS\n\nWHO: Thomas Middleditch (Silicon Valley), Annaleigh Ashford (Masters of Sex), Sara Rue (Impastor), Kether Donohue (You’re the Worst), Kamryn Kunody\n\nWHAT: A multi-cam comedy about a therapist and newly divorced dad who is faced with finding a kidney donor when he runs into a rough-around-the-edges woman from his past who volunteers her own. Together they form an unlikely bond and begin a journey that will change both of their lives.\n\n__\n\nPICK UP OR PASS?\n\nVERDICT: Pass. Welcome to the 2020-2021 CPU! network pilot review, always full of snark and real talk about upcoming TV from your friendly neighborhood TV podcast, whose business is otherwise unaffected by global pandemics, as we’re too afraid to leave our houses and, therefore, spend an even more inordinate time watching TV! Unite with us (and wear a mask)!\n\nWe start off with a pass because, as earnestly as we support humanity’s giving natures and organ donation when needed, the subject and the slapstick cut of this teaser trailer render us feeling like the topic and the tone of this series don’t quite match, despite a fairly fresh premise to start this situation comedy off reasonably right. Another way of looking at this snap judgment comes down to the idea that if this the best thirty seconds the Eye can provide to sell this sitcom, the humor falls flat quickly, even if spontaneous organ donation is intended to elicit at least a few smiles. We want to “b” into it, positively, but we’re not quite there.\n\nAnd to get this bit of annual flavor out of the way, if buzz and steam and starvation for new network sitcoms in these, our COVID times – or your more direct contact with us via comment on any post, a visit to our guestbook or our social media, or an email to couchpotatoesunitepodcast@gmail.com – convince us to change our minds, which is very easy to do with the right amount of minimal persuasion, we most certainly will! I’m positive!\n\n__\n\nSTATUS: Officially renewed for Season 2! In May 2021, CBS renewed this sitcom for a second season. The Season 1 finale aired on May 13, 2021, after a total of 18 episodes. Season 2 is set to premiere on October 14, 2021.\n\nCPU! STATUS: Reviews and reception from critics are (B?) positive. Plus, it was CBS’ only new comedy entry during this, our era of COVID, which might be bolstering its survival chances somewhat. Unfortunately, no one is talking to us about it yet, so we’ll stay pretty positive that passing is our best option. We have to prioritize the sheer volume of television entertainment somehow!\n\n__\n\nBIG SKY, ABC\n\nWHO: Kylie Bunbury (Pitch), Katheryn Winnick (Vikings), Ryan Phillippe (Shooter), Brian Geraghty (Chicago P.D.), John Carroll Lynch (American Horror Story), Dedee Pfeiffer (Cybill), Natalie Alyn Lind (The Gifted), Jade Pettyjohn (Little Fires Everywhere), Jesse James Keitel\n\nWHAT: In this procedural thriller, private detective Cassie Dewell (Bunbury) partners with ex-cop Jenny Hoyt (Winnick) on a search for two sisters who have been kidnapped by a truck driver on a remote highway in Montana, but when they discover that these are not the only girls who have disappeared in the area, they must race against the clock to stop the killer before another woman is taken.\n\n__\n\nPICK UP OR PASS?\n\nVERDICT: Pass. Without a trailer to help steer us toward this procedural thriller, I am afraid that we’ll have to steer away. Procedural TV is a genre not typically requested by our resident Couch Potatoes unless the procedural overlay is set off by a gimmick or a quirk that renders it somewhat different from the typical fare. Various vehicles featuring murder and detective work have come and gone in recent seasons; some have been canceled quickly, and though the lead actress is named Kylie (which this Kylie can get behind), we don’t have enough information about either this series premise or its cast to feel motivated to add it to our already as-large-as-the-sky lists of recommended TV. Big facts.\n\n__\n\nSTATUS: Officially renewed for Season 2! In May 2021, the Alphabet network renewed this Ryan Phillippe thriller for a second season. The Season 1 finale aired on May 18, 2021, after a total of 16 episodes. Season 2 is due to premiere on September 30, 2021.\n\nCPU! STATUS: After viewing the trailer for this series, your friendly neighborhood Chief Couch Potato was not motivated to watch this seemingly run-of-the-mill crime-solving thriller. Also, no one is talking about it in CPU!’s increasingly widespread circles of Couch Potatoes and Couch Potatoes Adjacent, and this past season, of all times, has been the time for hunkering in and watching things. The premise is not pie in the big sky, but this particular Alphabet entry feeling new and different from other ilk in its genre seems like a pretty tall order; or, perhaps, the trailer was not well cut (of course, usually, that means there’s not a lot from which to cut). Anyway, we remain in the passing line on the TV highway until we hear requests, same as it ever was, same as it ever was.\n\n__\n\nCALL ME KAT, Fox\n\nWHO: Mayim Bialik (The Big Bang Theory), Swoosie Kurtz (Mike & Molly), Cheyenne Jackson (American Horror Story), Kyla Pratt (One on One) and Leslie Jordan (Will & Grace). Bialik and Jim Parsons serve as EPs.\n\nWHAT: Based on the BBC sitcom Miranda, the multi-cam follows a 39-year-old woman (Bialik) who struggles every day against society (and her mother) to prove that you can not have everything you want and still be happy. That’s why she spent the money her parents set aside for her wedding to open a cat café in Louisville.\n\n__\n\nPICK UP OR PASS?\n\nVERDICT: Hesitantly Pick Up. The hesitancy comes from the lack of a trailer, but there are three reasons why we are motivated to give this one a look-see: it’s based on an established British comedy, so if it can be Americanized in a way that lands with the audiences on this side of the pond, we’re all for giving it a nod; it features Mayim Bialik, a Big Bang Blossom if there ever was one; and who doesn’t want to see a comedy about an owner of a cat cafe? Imagine all the feline hi-jinks! On the other hand, this sitcom could be incredibly stupid, but with Mayim and Jim Parsons, both capable of intelligence and warmth when it comes to comedy, at the helm, we’re thinking this one at least deserves a chance, though you can call me “krazy” if you want.\n\nPANDEMIC EDIT: The trailer has been reviewed. The premise is a little shaky, but the cast is the reason to watch this one, and by cast, I mean those supporting Ms. Bialik. As much as Mayim will bring the sass and apparently a few songs via a karaoke set-up (because why not?), those to watch include Swoosie Kurtz and Leslie Jordan doing what they do best. We are still evaluating Cheyenne Jackson beyond his appearances on American Horror Story and so will need to tune in to get the full sense of the coalescing of this particularly cat-crazy ensemble – but we do not regret our Pick Up decision (yet).\n\n__\n\nSTATUS: Officially renewed for Season 2! In May 2021, Fox renewed this Mayim Bialik kitty-littered sitcom for a second season. The Season 1 finale aired on March 25, 2021, after a total of 13 episodes.\n\nCPU! STATUS: We have had two requests already to cover this show on the podcast, so this Pick Up has become much less hesitant. Though the series seems critically panned, we have two discerning CP’s who advocate otherwise. To be continued!\n\n__\n\nCALL YOUR MOTHER, ABC\n\nWHO: Kyra Sedgwick (The Closer), Rachel Sennott (High Maintenance), Joey Bragg (Liv and Maddie), Emma Caymares (Fosse/Verdon), Austin Crute (Daybreak), Patrick Brammall (Evil, No Activity)\n\nWHAT: In this multi-cam, an “empty nester” mom wonders how she ended up alone while her children live their best lives thousands of miles away. She decides her place is with her family and as she re-inserts herself into their lives, her kids realize they might actually need her more than they thought.\n\n__\n\nPICK UP OR PASS?\n\nVERDICT: Pass. I am sure that Kyra Sedgwick will play a wonderful helicopter mom, but without a trailer or teaser to help seal the deal (likely a scarcity in these COVID circumstances), this new sitcom feels as by rote as most. If buzz or steam picks up when this premieres mid-season, if the TV production schedule remotely stays on track, we could be convinced to reassess, but in the meantime, we’ll just call our mothers.\n\nPANDEMIC EDIT: The trailer has been reviewed – and it plays like it reads: as by rote as more than most. Kyra Sedgwick seems potentially winning, but thirty seconds of teasing promotional clips left this CP comfortable with our initial pass. In the end, Kyra’s fans might be most readily drawn into this empty nest sitcom; otherwise, it’s just another family comedy to add to the Alphabet’s already packed schedule full of them.\n\n__\n\nSTATUS: Officially canceled! In May 2021, ABC canceled Kyra Sedgwick’s comedic maternal TV run. The series finale aired on May 19, 2021, after a total of 13 episodes.\n\nCPU! STATUS: This sitcom boasted decent ratings to start, but the drop-off was steep over the course of the show’s mid-season run, and it was critically panned – it has a 0% score on Rotten Tomatoes. These are about the two sharpest nails in any TV program’s coffin: no critic support and sharply waning viewing interest. Thus, it’s no surprise that the series was canceled, and it should also come as no surprise that CPU! will keep our pass firmly passed. Call your mothers if you think we’re being mean; then, she can call us and convince us to do a Canceled Corner…but that’s quite a few steps and too much work to protest the end of such a short-lived and relatively quietly ended one-and-done comedy.\n\n__\n\nCLARICE, CBS\n\nWHO: Rebecca Breeds (The Originals), Kal Penn (Designated Survivor, House), Michael Cudlitz (The Walking Dead, Southland), Nick Sandow (Orange Is the New Black), Lucca De Oliveira (The Punisher), Devyn A. Tyler (Out of Blue)\n\nWHAT: A deep dive into the untold personal story of brilliant and vulnerable FBI Agent Clarice Starling as she returns to the field in 1993, six months after the events of The Silence of the Lambs.\n\n__\n\nPICK UP OR PASS?\n\nVERDICT: Hesitantly Pick Up. Hesitancy, again, derives from a lack of sneak peek, but we have a few super-fans of the The Silence of the Lambs franchise that hang out on our united couch Around the Water Cooler, including of the erstwhile Hannibal. Plus, it will be interesting to see if Rebecca Breeds can evoke memories of the incomparable Jodie Foster, and if Clarice Starling’s back story can be as compelling as Hannibal Lecter’s. Also, the morbid curiosity of seeing how far the makers of this series can plumb the depths of this mythology comes to play here as well. All in all, we feel motivated to say, “Hello, Clarice.”\n\nPANDEMIC EDIT: The trailer has been reviewed – there wasn’t much in the vague teaser to clarify our feelings of hesitancy about Clarice. In fact, it only served to validate our initial hesitancy, but this drama shall remain a Pick Up. After all, we might do a Silence of the Lambs TV Series focused group of podcast episodes, including coverage of Hannibal. We’re always thinking around here! No fava beans or chianti of which to speak, either.\n\n__\n\nSTATUS: The Season 1 finale aired on June 24, 2021, after a total of 13 episodes. No announcement regarding renewal or cancellation has yet been made; this show was heavily rumored to be moving to Paramount+ (formerly CBS All Access), but now several TV pundits are estimating that renewal of any type is unlikely.\n\nCPU! STATUS: Not yet viewed.\n\n__\n\nDEBRIS, NBC\n\nWHO: Jonathan Tucker (Kingdom), Riann Steele (NCIS: New Orleans), Norbert Leo Butz (Fosse/Verdon, Bloodline)\n\nWHAT: Two agents from two different continents, and two different mindsets, must work together to investigate when wreckage from a destroyed alien spacecraft has mysterious effects on humankind.\n\n__\n\nPICK UP OR PASS?\n\nVERDICT: Pick Up. This time, there is less hesitancy because aliens, wreckage, mysterious effects, and a global scope, even if the premise is admittedly thin without further trailer evaluation to guide us. We love our science fiction around here, though, and while a trailer would be helpful, sometimes, you just have to go with what works, even if it could all implode in the end and litter our TV-loving hearts with debris from what was once our trust.\n\nPANDEMIC EDIT: The trailer has been reviewed – and it was very intriguing in all of the glorious science fiction senses that tend to titillate our TV watching tubers. From the trailer, the premise strikes this viewer as both familiar and different, so of course we’ll have to check it out to see which quality this new series displays more. I really should learn to trust my snap judgments, eh?\n\n__\n\nSTATUS: Officially canceled! On May 27, 2021, NBC canceled this extraterrestrial one-and-done series. The series finale aired on May 24, 2021, after a total of 13 episodes.\n\nCPU! STATUS: This science fiction vehicle, which apparently ended on something of a cliffhanger featuring Fringe alum John Noble, had steady but a lower share of ratings (10th, apparently, of NBC’s 14 dramas for the season). On the one hand, such demos shouldn’t doom a genre vehicle, but, on the other hand, this is NBC, which does not, as a network, fare well with genre vehicles generally, given the litter of canceled examples of previous seasons on the proverbial Peacock floor. Because we have a sci-fi soft spot around here, we might check it out eventually (though, notably, no one has discussed it as a potential panel) for a possible Canceled Corner entry. For now, we can only mourn the debris left by the ax-swinging at this series.\n\n__\n\nTHE EQUALIZER, CBS\n\nWHO: Queen Latifah (Star), Lorraine Toussaint (Orange Is the New Black), Chris Noth (Law & Order, Sex and the City), Liza Lapira (9JKL), Tory Kittles (Colony), Laya DeLeon Hayes (Raven’s Home)\n\nWHAT: The re-imagining of the classic series follows an enigmatic woman with a mysterious background who uses her extensive skills to help those with nowhere else to turn.\n\n__\n\nPICK UP OR PASS?\n\nVERDICT: Pick Up. Color me dubiously intrigued. Yours truly, the Chief CP, never watched the original Equalizer but not for lack of wanting. Plus, Queen Latifah is always fun to watch; she is a capable actress who can convincingly provide comedy, drama, a catchy tune, or a few slick bars of the rap that started her career. This is an experiment that could pay off in dividends…or, it could not work spectacularly, since the show is a remake of one with a potentially different tone. I’d say the odds of the potential for success and viewer enjoyment are approximately equalized… I’ll see myself out.\n\n__\n\nSTATUS: Officially renewed for Season 2! On March 9, 2021, Fox renewed this Queen Latifah starring remake for a second season. The Season 1 finale aired on May 23, 2021, after a total of ten episodes. Season 2 is set to premiere on October 10, 2021.\n\nCPU! STATUS: Not yet viewed.\n\n__\n\nFILTHY RICH, Fox\n\nWHO: Kim Cattrall (Sex and the City), Gerald McRaney (This Is Us), Aubrey Dollar (Battle Creek), Corey Cott (The Good Fight), Mark L. Young (The Comeback), Aaron Lazar (Quantico)\n\nWHAT: When the patriarch of a mega-rich Southern family (famed for creating a wildly successful Christian television network) dies in a plane crash, his wife and family are stunned to learn that he fathered three illegitimate children, all of whom are written into his will.\n\n__\n\nPICK UP OR PASS?\n\nVERDICT: Pass. In the grand tradition of fare like Dallas and Dynasty (the original, to be sure), Fox offers this new sudsy soap with rich people at the forefront mixed with all the scandal and guilty-pleasure inducing backdrop of televangelism and the antebellum lilts of the South, including the requisite homage to Gone with the Wind. Hilariously, the show is created/produced by the makers of Empire and The Help, so there is a small iota of curiosity to entice here. Plus, the presence of an older but no less fabulous Kim Cattrall, the erstwhile Samantha that oozed Sex in her City, leads this pack. Still, the premise sounds very similar to Fox’s Almost Family, also being introduced this season (see above), with the soap angle to propel it forward into Desperate Housewives and the aforementioned Dallas/Dynasty territories, and so it seems like Fox is throwing the idea of illegitimate children around every chance it can get. We passed on the other one and feel it only fair to pass on this one also, but if you think we need to cover more suds and find this candidate suitable to that purpose, drop us a line.\n\nThis was delayed from the 2019-2020 TV season, and our initial review was written in fall 2019.\n\n__\n\nSTATUS: Officially canceled! On October 30, 2020, Fox canceled this delayed drama citing rising production costs due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The series finale aired on November 30, 2020, after a total of 10 episodes.\n\nCPU! STATUS: Clearly, this production seemed somewhat doomed from the start, but adding together the individual variables of slightly above average critical reviews, declining ratings over its short run, not to mention a sizable cast with an oft-played premise, there is little wonder that this show did not survive after everything that appeared to plague its path to airing. Plus, CPU! remains uninterested; not even those with the filthiest, guiltiest penchants for this kind of TV mentioned this series once. We can’t say that’s very rich.\n\n__\n\nTHE GREAT NORTH, Fox\n\nWHO: The voices of Nick Offerman, Jenny Slate, Megan Mullally, Paul Rust, Aparna Nancherla, Will Forte, Dulcé Sloan\n\nWHAT: The animated comedy follows the Alaskan adventures of the Tobin family, as single dad Beef does his best to keep his weird bunch of kids close, especially as the artistic dreams of his only daughter, Judy, lead her away from the family fishing boat and into the glamorous world of the local mall.\n\n__\n\nPICK UP OR PASS?\n\nVERDICT: Hesitantly Pick Up. Fox is also going hog-wild this year with upping its animation game. Still, this animated entry shows more possibility than other new selections, even without a trailer to more fully and thoroughly evaluate it. First, the voice cast contains one of the funniest married couples on the planet in Nick Offerman and Megan Mullaly, who people might know from shows like Parks & Recreation and Will & Grace, respectively. On top of that, the setting is Alaska, and the premise feels a bit more original and fresh, even as it could also be the cartoon version of Northern Exposure. All of the above is enough to warrant a tiny look-see but no promises from the not-so-great north.\n\nThis was delayed from the 2019-2020 TV season, and our initial review was written in fall 2019.\n\n__\n\nSTATUS: Officially renewed for Seasons 2 and 3! Ahead of its premiere, on June 22, 2020, Fox renewed this animated sitcom for a second and third season season. The Season 1 finale aired on May 16, 2021, after a total of eleven episodes. Season 2 premiered on September 26, 2021.\n\nCPU! STATUS: The teaser trailer has been reviewed, but the thirty available seconds were inconclusive. Still, I think it’s a safe bet to say that fans of Bob’s Burgers will probably find something to like about this one. And the stellar voice cast is really why we’re enticed to give The Great North a gander more than a goose, eh?\n\n__\n\nHOUSEBROKEN, Fox\n\nWHO: The voices of Lisa Kudrow, Clea Duvall, Nat Faxon, Sharon Horgan, Will Forte, Tony Hale, Jason Mantzoukas, Sam Richardson, Bresha Webb, Greta Lee\n\nWHAT: The animated comedy explores human dysfunction and neurosis through a group of neighborhood animals who live in the suburbs.\n\n__\n\nPICK UP OR PASS?\n\nVERDICT: Hesitantly Pick Up. Fox can’t help itself when producing all of its adult animation; I think the network is more addicted to it than the viewing public, or maybe they are beginning to shop around for the next The Simpsons, since we all know that the clock eventually has to run out for our yellow, Springfield-bound family at some point. Still, in a world besieged by a global pandemic that requires social distancing, animation might become a booming industry in this current TV landscape, since drawing/animating and voice acting can be done in a fairly isolated manner. Either way, the only hesitancy here comes from the fact that it’s a show about anthropomorphic animals being neurotic. Yet, the voice cast listed is stellar; I feel confident that the erstwhile Phoebe from Friends, Madame Kudrow herself, could achieve peak-level neurosis, whatever animal she ends up voicing. Also, several of our resident Couch Potatoes, your Chief among them, follow the Friends when we can. Two thumbs partway up in careful anticipation!\n\n__\n\nSTATUS: Officially renewed for Season 2! In August 2021, Fox renewed this new entry into their much ballyhooed animation lineup for a second season. The Season 1 finale aired on August 30, 2021, after a total of eleven episodes.\n\nCPU! STATUS: Not yet viewed.\n\n__\n\nTHE KENAN SHOW, KENAN, NBC\n\nWHO: Kenan Thompson (Saturday Night Live), Andy Garcia (Ocean’s Eleven), Punam Patel (Special)\n\nWHAT: The single-camera comedy follows a newly widowed dad determined to be everything for his kids while begrudgingly letting his persistent father-in-law become more involved in their lives.\n\n__\n\nPICK UP OR PASS?\n\nVERDICT: Pass. While it is about time that Kenan Thompson returns to scripted TV from his long tenure as sketch comedian on Saturday Night Live, and while he is more than deserving of an eponymous comedy, we are not sure that this is the eponymous comedy that is going to keep his career going, unless his biggest fans are the generators of decent ratings to keep this sitcom afloat. This thin premise rings bells echoing My Wife & Kids, or, depending upon Kenan’s delivery, The Bernie Mac Show, but with a Xennial approach to the parental side of this equation. No trailer makes the selling difficult, but if you’re a Kenan Thompson fan and want us to reconsider, send us the messages.\n\nThis was delayed from the 2019-2020 TV season, and our initial review was written in fall 2019.\n\n__\n\nSTATUS: Officially renewed for Season 2! In April 2021, the Peacock renewed Kenan Thompson’s eponymous sitcom for a second season. The Season 1 finale aired on April 27, 2021, after a total of 10 episodes.\n\nCPU! STATUS: We have yet to hear any percolations from our loyal CP’s about Kenan’s jump into star vehicle sitcom territory. Until we do, we’ll just stay quietly and less eponymously passed for now. We have so much TV to watch!\n\n__\n\nKUNG FU, The CW\n\nWHO: Olivia Liang (Legacies), Jon Prasida (Hiding), Shannon Dang (Sorry for Your Loss), Eddie Liu (Silicon Valley), Tzi Ma (Wu Assassins, The Man In the High Castle), Kheng Hua Tan (Marco Polo), Gavin Stenhouse (9-1-1, Allegiance), Gwendoline Yeo (American Crime)\n\nWHAT: A quarter-life crisis causes a young Chinese-American woman to drop out of college and go on a life-changing journey to an isolated monastery in China. But when she returns to find her hometown overrun with crime and corruption, she uses her martial arts skills and Shaolin values to protect her community and bring criminals to justice… all while searching for the assassin who killed her Shaolin mentor and is now targeting her. Inspired by the original series created by Ed Spielman.\n\n__\n\nPICK UP OR PASS?\n\nVERDICT: Very Hesitantly Pick Up. The uniqueness and originality of bringing martial arts and associated cultural principles to the small screen inspires this hesitant pick-up, even though a few properties of similar ilk have been popping up here and there on streamers in recent years. This new drama could be riveting, or it could be hokey, but the question, I think, that we really have to seek an answer for here is how many of our Couch Potatoes, Couch Potatoes adjacent, and Couch Potatoes Unite! listeners need a martial arts show in their lives? It is a serialized drama, so the success will probably ride upon how well the cast and the production team can execute everything (as it usually does). A trailer would be helpful, but a slightly fresh twist on an old premise certainly appeals.\n\n__\n\nSTATUS: Officially renewed for Season 2! In May 2021, the CW renewed this martial arts-themed drama for a second season. The Season 1 finale aired on July 21, 2021, after a total of 13 episodes.\n\nCPU! STATUS: Not yet viewed.\n\n__\n\nLAW & ORDER: ORGANIZED CRIME, NBC\n\nWHO: Christopher Meloni (Law & Order: SVU)\n\nWHAT: Elliot Stabler returns to the NYPD to battle organized crime after a devastating personal loss. However, the city and police department have changed dramatically in the decade he’s been away, and he must adapt to a criminal justice system in the midst of its own moment of reckoning. Throughout the series, we will follow Stabler’s journey to find absolution and rebuild his life, while leading a new elite task force that is taking apart the city’s most powerful criminal syndicates one by one.\n\n__\n\nPICK UP OR PASS?\n\nVERDICT: Pass For Now. The Law & Order franchise has been suggested for podcast dissection via the CPU! request line, so the return of Elliott Stabler (even this non-procedural loving, non-Law & Order watching viewer knows who he is!) only inspires us to wonder just how many spin-offs our potential L&O panel would want to cover. Given the popularity of SVU, I am guessing all of them. Still, this panel is deep in the planning stages and will require a moderator team. If you want us to get to it faster – or to be a moderator – drop us a line!\n\n__\n\nSTATUS: Officially renewed for Season 2! In May 2021, the Peacock renewed this latest spin-off to enter the massive Law & Order universe. The Season 1 finale aired on June 3, 2021, after a total of 8 episodes.\n\nCPU! STATUS: We still have to talk about all the other Law & Order(s) first! Until we do, we will just continue to pass for now. (I can’t even imagine the sheer amount of hours required for this sort of multi-part discussion…).\n\n__\n\nMR. MAYOR, NBC\n\nWHO: Ted Danson (The Good Place), Bobby Moynihan (SNL), Holly Hunter (Top of the Lake, Saving Grace)\n\nWHAT: A single-cam comedy centering around a wealthy businessman (Danson) who runs for mayor of Los Angeles for all the wrong reasons. Once he wins, he has to figure out what he stands for, gain the respect of his staff, and connect with his teenage daughter — all while controlling the coyote population.\n\n__\n\nPICK UP OR PASS?\n\nVERDICT: Hesitantly Pick Up. Look. Ted Danson has at least earned a “check it out” sort of watch for his string of good TV, including Cheers and, most recently, The Good Place. And, frankly, I really need more information about these coyotes. A trailer would be so helpful here, but the coyote factor intrigues just about as much as the presence of the erstwhile Sam Malone aka Michael Goodman. This premise could very well flop faster than a fish out of its bowl, but a coyote out of its natural habitat and a smooth-talking Mr. Danson? Keeping an open mind seems wise.\n\nPANDEMIC EDIT: The trailer has been reviewed. The trailer produces much less hesitancy, owing to the presence of Vella Lovell from Crazy Ex-Girlfriend, Ted Danson doing his best Ted Danson (somewhere between Sam Malone and Michael the Ex-Demon), and Holly Hunter playing someone seemingly unhinged and totally hilarious with some great potential chemistry with Mr. Mayor Danson. Paired with Tina Fey and Robert Carlock’s eye for quick and zany wit (see also: 30 Rock, Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt), and this CP is more excitedly veering toward a solid Pick Up rather than a Hesitant(ly) Pick Up. Like LeVar Burton says, though, you don’t have to take my word for that, Mr. Mayor. Watch the trailer; see for yourself!\n\n__\n\nSTATUS: Officially renewed for Season 2! In March 2021, NBC renewed this Ted Danson-helmed sitcom for a second season. A thirteen-episode season was ordered, but only nine episodes were produced and aired due to effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Season 1 finale aired on February 25, 2021.\n\nCPU! STATUS: Not yet viewed.\n\n__\n\nNEXT, Fox\n\nWHO: John Slattery (Mad Men), Eve Harlow (Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.), Michael Mosley (Sirens), Jason Butler Harner (Ozark), Elizabeth Cappuccino (Jessica Jones), Fernanda Andrade, Aaron Moten, Gerardo Celasco, Evan Whitten\n\nWHAT: A Silicon Valley pioneer discovers that one of his own creations — a powerful A.I. — might spell global catastrophe, and teams up with a cybercrime agent to fight a villain unlike anything we’ve ever seen — one whose greatest weapon against us is ourselves.\n\n__\n\nPICK UP OR PASS?\n\nVERDICT: Pick Up. Oh sure, science fiction revolving around sentient artificial intelligence has been done before and has been arguably done to death. From The Terminator to Person of Interest, from 2001: A Space Odyssey (and its sequel, 2010) to Westworld, the world will never want for the fear that robots will someday turn against us, as humans attempt to play God by creating them in the first place. What makes this upcoming series potentially compelling TV is that, first, it is being billed as an event (read: limited) series, giving it a theoretically tight number of episodes within which to tell its story. Second, the culprit AI is a clear homage to Amazon’s Alexa product, which should add an element of real-world suspension of disbelief to this science fiction sub-genre. Plus, John Slattery is always a fun guy to watch on the small screen. Amazon’s already taking over the world – why shouldn’t its calming AI Alexa, named Iliza in this series, do the same and then turn on us all? What would happen if it did? Nothing good can come of this, that’s what we know from stories like it, but the premise and devices used here definitely intrigue the mind around this oft-employed story concept, so much so that we want to know what’s neXt.\n\nThis was delayed from the 2019-2020 TV season, and our initial review was written in fall 2019.\n\n__\n\nSTATUS: Officially canceled! On October 30, 2020, Fox canceled this delayed drama citing rising production costs due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The series finale aired on December 22, 2020, after a total of 10 episodes.\n\nCPU! STATUS: Critical reception was above average for this one and done series, but it never found an audience. It’s too bad, really, but this CP can’t help but wonder if being cooped up at home for months on end due to a global pandemic, where technology is getting smarter and better, and where one would hope it wouldn’t turn on the people operating it, probably influenced non-interest in this series; after all, sometimes timing is everything in the TV biz. Hoping that it did not end on a cliffhanger, I think CPU! will still take a look someday, if not anytime soon. If you want us to take a look at it faster and voice some feelings, email us at couchpotatoesunitepodcast@gmailcom or get at us on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram. It’s the “NEXT” logical course of action, naturally.\n\n__\n\nTHE REPUBLIC OF SARAH, The CW\n\nWHO: Stella Baker (Tell Me Your Secrets), Luke Mitchell (Blindspot), Megan Follows (Reign), Izabella Alvarez (Westworld), Nia Holloway (Hawaii Five-0), Hope Lauren (Awkward, Supergirl), Landry Bender (Fuller House, Looking for Alaska), Ian Duff (New Amsterdam), Forrest Goodluck (The Miseducation of Cameron Post)\n\nWHAT: Faced with the destruction of her town at the hands of a greedy mining company, rebellious high school teacher Sarah Cooper utilizes an obscure cartographical loophole to declare independence. Now Sarah must lead a young group of misfits as they attempt to start their own country from scratch.\n\n__\n\nPICK UP OR PASS?\n\nVERDICT: Pass. This reviewer needs a trailer for this one. Though the CW motivates many of our Couch Potatoes’ personal TV-watching choices with the network’s attempts at giving all types of fare a chance, this premise feels a bit hollow and possibly precariously played for farce or pedantically played for social commentary. Without a way to further vet the concept visually, and with a cast that doesn’t, by itself, excite, we are going to leave this one aside, regardless of whatever republic for which it stands. As always, if buzz or steam generates around this new drama (is it a drama?), we will reconsider our position, but for now, we pledge allegiance to other TV.\n\n__\n\nSTATUS: Officially canceled! On September 2, 2021, the CW canceled this late-premiering spring drama. The series finale aired on September 6, 2021, after a total of 13 episodes.\n\nCPU! STATUS: Critical reception was middling to low for this one and done series; plus, it never found an audience, carrying only a 0.1 ratings share for the entire duration of its run, and none of our Couch Potatoes, incumbent, adjacent, or otherwise, mentioned this show. We initially passed without a trailer to rely upon, and it seems as if this was the right call to make, as the CW does not often cancel shows so early. To that end, we shall firmly continue to bypass this republic that was, unless someone convinces us that it is worth it to do otherwise (which would be for a Canceled Corner, so we’re not holding our breaths…or planting our flags).\n\n__\n\nSMALL FORTUNE, NBC\n\nWHO: Host Lil Rel Howery\n\nWHAT: Based on the U.K. format, the unscripted series features teams of three friends who compete in the tiniest of challenges for a chance to win big money. From a shrunk down Oval Office (“The Waste Wing”) to a mini Arc de Triomphe (“Arc de Wee-Omph”), each team must prove their skills on playing fields that have been squeezed down to the size of a dollhouse. Challenges will require considerable dexterity and intense focus because with games this small, there’s no room for error as the slightest miscalculation or tremble may result in elimination.\n\n__\n\nPICK UP OR PASS?\n\nVERDICT: Pass. CPU! does not cover game shows in any of our formats, but as this show is new this year, we’ll keep an eye on it for the duration of the season. I would guess our coverage ranks as far less than even a small fortune, but we like scripted TV better here at CPU!\n\n__\n\nSTATUS: Six episodes have aired as of the publication of this pilot review, most recently on July 19, 2021. No announcement regarding renewal or cancellation has yet been made.\n\nCPU! STATUS: At last check…this is still a game show. Right?\n\n__\n\nSUPERMAN & LOIS, The CW\n\nWHO: Tyler Hoechlin (Supergirl), Elizabeth Tulloch (Supergirl), Dylan Walsh (Nip/Tuck), Emmanuelle Chriqui (The Passage, Entourage), Erik Valdez (General Hospital), Jordan Elsass (Little Fires Everywhere), Alexander Garfin, Wolé Parks (All American, The Vampire Diaries), Inde Navarrette (13 Reasons Why)\n\nWHAT: The Arrowverse spin-off follows the world’d most famous superhero and comic books’ most famous journalist as they deal with all the stress, pressures and complexities that come with being working parents in today’s society.\n\n__\n\nPICK UP OR PASS?\n\nVERDICT: Enthusiastically Pick Up. As an Arrowverse spin-off, this is an automatic Pick Up for our CPU! “DCTU Series” panel. Considering that our panel has expressed consistent excitement and appreciation, as well as glowing praise, for each appearance of Tyler Hoechlin and Elizabeth Tulloch in recent Arrowverse mid-season crossovers, I would say that this latest incarnation in the “Superman” annals will probably be at least somewhat popular with our panel of DC enthusiasts, with or without an available trailer. To this we say, up, up, and away!\n\nPANDEMIC EDIT: The trailer has been reviewed. IT CHANGES NOTHING! MORE ENTHUSIASM!\n\n__\n\nSTATUS: Officially renewed for Season 2! The CW renewed this and many of its flagship properties on March 2, 2021 for a second season. The Season 1 finale aired on August 17, 2021, after 15 episodes.\n\nCPU! STATUS: Our DCTU Series will cover Season 1 of this new “Arrowverse” or “CWVerse” (blah) drama later this year. Early reviews by constituent members of the panel who are up on their CW superhero viewing are largely positive.\n\n__\n\nSUPERMARKET SWEEP, ABC\n\nWHO: Host Leslie Jones (SNL)\n\nWHAT: The competition show revival follows three teams of two as they battle it out using their grocery shopping skills and knowledge of merchandise to win big cash prizes.\n\n__\n\nPICK UP OR PASS?\n\nVERDICT: Pass. See the above note about game shows and new TV. (We don’t cover them, except their renewal/cancellation prospects in their first year. Oh wait, I gave it away. Rats).\n\n__\n\nSTATUS: Officially renewed for Season 2! The Season 1 finale aired on January 3, 2021, after a total of ten episodes. Season 2 premiered on September 26, 2021.\n\nCPU!

We also don’t cover variety shows or shows featuring celebrity competition (see also: The Masked Singer). That isn’t to say we won’t be watching. We just won’t be talking about the fact that we’re watching. Though Daniel Radcliffe should get himself a slot on this show. His rendition of “Alphabet Rap” was pretty dope.\n\n__\n\nTRUE STORY, NBC, PEACOCK\n\nPREMIERE DATE: TBA\n\nWHO: Hosts Ed Helms (The Office) and Randall Park (Fresh Off the Boat)\n\nWHAT: In the hybrid alternative-scripted series, based on the Australian hit, everyday Americans sit down with Helms and Park to share their most extraordinary and unbelievably true stories for the first time. As the stories unfold, events are humorously brought to life by a star-studded cast of comedians and actors in heightened, dramatized re-enactments of cinematic proportions.\n\n__\n\nPICK UP OR PASS?\n\nVERDICT: Pass. What is “alternative-scripted?” This sounds like an experiment requiring a review by our resident TV lovers and Couch Potatoes, but I am not sure how we would make it work on our podcast. Change my mind, though, if you disagree. I think it’s got potential, but it also sounds like Whose Line Is It Anyway? crossed with This Is Your Life, so I am on the struggle bus. If you think we should assemble a panel to podcast about it, contact us!\n\n__\n\nWALKER, The CW\n\nWHO: Jared Padalecki (Supernatural), Lindsey Morgan (The 100), Keegan Allen (Pretty Little Liars), Mitch Pileggi (Supernatural, The X-Files), Molly Hagan (iZombie, Jane the Virgin), Coby Bell (The Gifted), Jeff Pierre (Once Upon a Time, Beyond)\n\nWHAT: The Walker, Texas Ranger reboot follows Cordell Walker (Padalecki), a widower and father of two with his own moral code, who returns to Austin after being undercover for two years, only to discover there’s harder work to be done at home. He’ll attempt to reconnect with his children, navigate clashes with his family, and find unexpected common ground with his new partner (one of the first women in Texas Rangers history), while growing increasingly suspicious about the circumstances surrounding his wife’s death.\n\n__\n\nPICK UP OR PASS?\n\nVERDICT: Very Hesitantly Pick Up. I am not sure how many of our viewers and listeners, i.e. our resident Couch Potatoes and Couch Potatoes-adjacent, watched the original Walker, Texas Ranger, starring Chuck Norris. If you did, please comment below. The Chief Couch Potato and author of these annual progress reports never did; westerns aren’t quite in the wheelhouse, and I was never a fan of Master Norris beyond a bemused appreciation of his existence. Yet, Jared Padalecki is/was Sam Winchester, and he’s earned the trust of at least six of us for 15 years. I think it’s worth seeing what he does with the role – he could just elevate it. Or, he could make Chuck Norris cry. Wait, does Chuck Norris cry? Let’s just hope it doesn’t come to tears, or we’ll walk(er) right out the door.\n\nWhat? No? That doesn’t work either? I’ll see myself out again.\n\nPANDEMIC EDIT: The teaser has been reviewed. Meh. It does not provide much in the way of any kind of information that could not be gleaned from a simple knowledge of anything having to do with “Walker” and “Texas Ranger.” Still, JarPad is in it, and after years of stellar reliability on Supernatural and Gilmore Girls, he deserves at least one watch for fair chance’s and judgment’s sake (and in this CP’s opinion, he’s far more easy on the eyes than Chuck Norris, but to each their own).\n\n__\n\nSTATUS: Officially renewed for Season 2! In February 2021, the CW gave JarPad’s Walker remake a second season. The Season 1 finale aired on August 12, 2021, after a total of 18 episodes. Season 2 will premiere on October 28, 2021.\n\nCPU! STATUS: Not yet viewed.\n\n__\n\nWEAKEST LINK, NBC\n\nWHAT: The reboot “will deliver the fast-paced and quick-witted pillars of the original British format created by the BBC with a few modern twists,” per the network. “The hybrid game show sees contestants answer general knowledge questions to bank prize money across multiple rounds. At the end of each round, the contestants vote out who they perceive to be the Weakest Link remaining.”\n\n__\n\nPICK UP OR PASS?\n\nVERDICT: Pass. This reboot is the weakest link. Goodbye.\n\n(Look, we love Jane Lynch as much as the next person, but she can’t possibly be nearly as withering as Anne Robinson without sounding like Sue Sylvester. Also, it’s another game show….which is probably the en vogue way to fill empty airing slots when TV production has been shut down for months by a pandemic. You know I’m right.)\n\n__\n\nSTATUS: Officially renewed for Season 2! In January 2021, the Peacock announced renewal for a second season for this Jane Lynch-headed game show. The Season 1 finale aired on February 1, 2021, after a total of 13 episodes.\n\nCPU! STATUS: It’s still a game show, right? We’ve covered it as long as we’re going to cover it. Goodbye!\n\n__\n\nYOUNG ROCK, NBC\n\nWHO: Dwayne Johnson\n\nWHAT: The single-cam comedy chronicles the formative childhood years of Dwayne Johnson, aka The Rock.\n\n__\n\nPICK UP OR PASS?\n\nVERDICT: Pass. The audience for this show is going to have to *really* love the Rock. The Rock is fine. The Rock is nice. The Rock is the voice of Maui in Moana. Do we need a sitcom about his life story? Without a trailer, I’m thinking that the answer is no, but if you think we’re not giving due deference to Mr. Johnson, ring that bell (or, just send us an email, or comment down below).\n\n__\n\nSTATUS: Officially renewed for Season 2! In April 2021, the Peacock renewed this Dwayne Johnson biopic sitcom for a second season. The Season 1 finale aired on May 4, 2021, after a total of 11 episodes.\n\nCPU! STATUS: Given his popularity, I am surprised that we don’t have any secret “Rock” fans in our CP midst. No one is talking to this Chief CP about the Rock and his younger years, though. We have to prioritize this stuff somehow! We are still passing at this time.\n\n__\n\nCONNECTING, NBC\n\nWHO: Parvesh Cheena, Keith Powell\n\nWHAT: Set against the backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, the series follows the lives of a group of friends who try to stay connected via videotelephony as they navigate through the various nuances of life in a lockdown.\n\n__\n\nPICK UP OR PASS?\n\nVERDICT: Pass. This “COVID era” series was announced late and canceled too quickly to be enticing; plus, Toofer from 30 Rock is the only familiar presence, as delightful a presence as he might be. It’s not even worth the look, given how quickly NBC tossed it from the main network lineup to its streaming outlets.\n\n__\n\nSTATUS: Officially canceled! In November 2020, NBC canceled this new entry and burned off remaining episodes on Peacock and the NBC streaming apps. The series finale aired on November 16, 2020, after a total of eight episodes.\n\nCPU! STATUS: The reviews were generally favorable, but the audience was decidedly anemic, and it’s fairly obvious as to why. In a pandemic-driven quarantine/isolation/shutdown/slowed world order due to a contagious virus, people want to go to there, i.e. TV, for escape, not to watch a Zoom or equivalent conversation play out on their television screens. THAT’S WHAT WE’VE BEEN DOING RIGHT NOW EVERYDAY – those who work in offices, education, and similar, anyway. Too soon, Peacock Party, too soon.\n\n__\n\nTRICKSTER, CW\n\nWHO: Joel Oulette\n\nWHAT: A Canadian series adaptation of Eden Robinson’s supernatural novel Son of a Trickster.\n\n__\n\nPICK UP OR PASS?\n\nVERDICT: Hesitantly Pick Up. A preview of a trailer shows a somewhat solid supernatural premise situated within Canadian indigenous cultures. The series is short and is being given American network treatment in a time of COVID, so we’re always happy to dip into horror/fantasy waters, even if it’s just a test.\n\n__\n\nSTATUS: Officially canceled! In January 2021, the CW by way of the CBC, on which this series originally aired, canceled this supernatural novel adaptation, potentially due to questions surrounding the cultural standing of one of the show’s head writers and directors. The series finale aired on November 11, 2020, after a total of six episodes.\n\nCPU! STATUS: Due to the brief run of this series, CPU! will switch our initial verdict to “pass” in favor of the plethora of genre-specific content out there (though, sadly, so few of them feature casts of largely indigenous peoples). Still, it’s hard to be in favor of sticking with such a show, when there is so little of it to cover. If someone requests otherwise, we will, of course, be happy to discuss this show in a “Canceled Corner” episode. You let us know, gentle reader, if we should.\n\n__\n\nHOME ECONOMICS, ABC\n\nWHO: Topher Grace (That 70’s Show); Caitlin McGee (Bluff City Law)\n\nWHAT: A situation comedy inspired by the life of co-creator Michael Colton, Home Economics takes a look at the heartwarming yet super-uncomfortable and sometimes frustrating relationship among three adult siblings: one in the one percent, one middle-class, and one barely holding on.\n\n__\n\nPICK UP OR PASS?\n\nVERDICT: Pass. As much of a fan as the Chief CP is of Topher Grace (because Eric Forman forever), the trailer for this show suggests a fairly by rote premise of sibling rivalry turned union in a largely milquetoast comedy drama premise. This show might find an audience in certain generations of adults who are just embarking upon life after high school or college in these, our modern times, but the sibling dynamic that is supposed to be the draw feels largely shallow in the preview we reviewed.\n\n__\n\nSTATUS: Officially renewed for Season 2! In May 2021, the Alphabet renewed this late entry into the TV season for a second go, which premiere on September 22, 2021. The Season 1 finale aired on May 19, 2021, after a total of seven episodes.\n\nCPU! STATUS: Since we just reviewed this trailer, our pass is fresh. If you think we are being harsh, it makes good home economic sense for you to encourage our podcast discussion of this show by requesting it. So far, we’ve heard nothing in the way of buzz or steam about it, Topher Grace or no.\n\n__\n\nREBEL, ABC\n\nWHO: Katey Sagal (Married…With Children; Futurama; 8 Simple Rules; Sons of Anarchy); John Corbett (Northern Exposure; Sex and the City; United States of Tara; Parenthood)\n\nWHAT: A legal comedy-drama television series inspired by the life of Erin Brockovich.\n\n__\n\nPICK UP OR PASS?\n\nVERDICT: Pass. a) We know this was canceled within a short space of time. b) A comedy-drama inspired by the life of Erin Brockovich is probably not well-timed with the current global crises overshadowing the sorts of David v. Goliath situations in which the real life inspiration quite frequently finds herself. It’s hard to see how it would be worth watching whatever is out there now.\n\n__\n\nSTATUS: Officially canceled! In May 2021, ABC canceled this series shortly after it premiered, which caused a bit of a stir for a minute and produced some vocal outcry from star Katey Sagal, who tried to stir network shopping and fan petitions, all of which ultimately did nothing to reverse the fate of the cancellation. The series finale aired on June 10, 2021, after a total of ten episodes.\n\nCPU! STATUS: What else can be said? If the only ten episodes of this show are worth the watch, let us know via the usual ways and means. It would certainly be a sort of rebellion for us to take up a show with so little life to it (though the trailer was not convincing enough on its own to suggest otherwise, so…).\n\n__\n\nUNITED STATES OF AL, CBS\n\nWHO: Adhir Kalyan (Rules of Engagement); Parker Young (Suburgatory)\n\nWHAT: A situation comedy following the life of an interpreter from Afghanistan as he moves to Columbus, Ohio, with his friend Riley, a veteran of the United States Marine Corps that he helped during his service.\n\n__\n\nPICK UP OR PASS?\n\nVERDICT: Pass. This sitcom from Chuck Lorre, purveyor of other comedies containing at least two men, has brought back his buddy cop/odd couple formula of tried and true buddy cops and odd couples to provide this latest entry, featuring a war veteran and the ongoing relationship he has with his interpreter from his tour in Afghanistan. It’s a thin premise with an even thinner veneer of the same old Chuck Lorre stamp, which tends to turn away our most ardent Couch Potatoes, none of whom have requested to discuss any member of this family of comedies from a producer who favors them so.\n\n__\n\nSTATUS: Officially renewed for Season 2! In May 2021, the Eye renewed this comedy (as it typically does for Chuck) for a second season, which is set to premiere on October 7, 2021. The Season 1 finale aired on June 24, 2021, after a total of 13 episodes.\n\nCPU! STATUS: We stand by our position, unless you really think we should reconsider it (we will cave to the peer pressure in all of the unitedness we offer).\n\n__\n\nTRANSPLANT, NBC\n\nWHO: Hamza Haq; Laurence Leboeuf; John Hannah (Spartacus, Agents of SHIELD)\n\nWHAT: A Canadian medical drama television series created by Joseph Kay, which centers on Bashir “Bash” Hamed, a doctor from Syria who comes to Canada as a refugee during the Syrian Civil War and is rebuilding his career as a medical resident in the emergency department at the fictional York Memorial Hospital in Toronto.\n\n__\n\nPICK UP OR PASS?\n\nVERDICT: Pass. It’s a medical drama with a cultural twist, but it’s still a medical drama. We have some Couch Potatoes who gravitate toward the genre, but none have yet mentioned this show. Until they do, we will leave this one be. It was such a late entry to the network lineup, it’s probably best to leave it for a catch-up, if people desire to do so.\n\n__\n\nSTATUS: Officially renewed for Season 2! In December 2020, NBC by way of the CBC, on which this series originally aired, renewed this drama for a second season. Season 1 consists of 13 episodes.\n\nCPU!

The film’s star (and titular Simon), Nick Robinson, will narrate the series, and the cast also includes Sophia Bush, James Martinez, and Ana Ortiz.\n\n__\n\nSTATUS: Officially renewed for Seasons 2 AND 3! Hulu renewed this drama in August 2020. The first season consisting of ten episodes was released on June 17, 2020. The second season consisting of ten episodes was released in June 11, 2021.\n\nCPU! STATUS: As above, this series was requested for podcast coverage shortly after its release and may feature as part of a future Pride month series.\n\n__\n\nPerry Mason (HBO): This reboot is critically acclaimed, and though initially billed as a miniseries, it has been renewed for a second season. (Premiered June 21, 2020)\n\nMatthew Rhys (The Americans) stars as the titular criminal defense attorney in this remake of the classic TV drama that aired in various forms, most famously as an Emmy-winning series on CBS from 1957-66 (with Raymond Burr in the title role). HBO’s version is also based on the Los Angeles-set novels and stories by author Erle Stanley Gardner, though the time period is now 1931, when Mason is trying to eke out a living as a private investigator and gets drawn into a case involving a child kidnapping. John Lithgow, Tatiana Maslany, Shea Whigham, Stephen Root, Nate Corddry, Lili Taylor, Robert Patrick, and Juliet Rylance also star.\n\n__\n\nSTATUS: Officially renewed for Season 2!

The book is a must-read (along with “1984”). (Released July 15, 2020)\n\nAfter a lengthy journey to the small screen that saw the property change networks twice (it was previously intended for Syfy and then USA), this series adaptation of Aldous Huxley’s classic 1932 novel set in a theoretically utopian (but in actuality more dystopian) future London is the highest-profile original show available on the public launch day for Comcast’s new streaming service. (As with other Peacock originals, you’ll need to be a “Premium” member to watch it, though Comcast and Cox cable subscribers will get a free premium subscription.) Harry Lloyd, Jessica Brown Findlay, and Alden Ehrenreich head a cast that also includes Demi Moore, Kylie Bunbury, and Hannah John-Kamen. The adaptation, a co-production with the UK’s Sky, comes from David Wiener, who previously wrote for Homecoming and The Killing.\n\n__\n\nSTATUS: Officially canceled! NBC canceled this adaptation in October 2020. The entire series was released on July 15, 2020, with a total of nine episodes.\n\nCPU! STATUS: Critical reception was middling to below average for this one and done series; audience reception is difficult to gauge, since it appeared on Peacock. I believe that this series suffered from the same general barriers as Fox’s NEXT: the globe is already cooped up at home for months on end due to a global pandemic, where technology is getting smarter and better, and where everything feels modestly apocalyptic and somewhat totalitarian in a socio-political context. The book is important, however, despite some of its problematic contextual themes arising from the time period in which it was written; hoping that it did not end on a cliffhanger, and knowing the end of the novel, I think CPU! will still take a look someday, if not anytime soon.
