        "text": "‘2 Dope Queens’\n\nComedians and besties Jessica Williams and Phoebe Robinson are bringing their comedy podcast to life over the course of a handful of episodes for HBO on Friday, February 2, 2018. The two women have four seasons of 2 Dope Queens podcasts under the belts and are ready to take their comedy to a bigger level — live TV.\n\nOn their hit podcast, each episode is essentially the audio version of a live night of stand-up. Williams and Robinson typically open the show with some playful banter about what’s going on in their lives or bees that are messing around in their bonnets before they give the stage over to three talented comedians, from rising stars to seasoned pros. It’s a hoot to listen to (check out their podcast here) so there’s no doubt their HBO specials will be just as amazing.\n\n‘Lore’\n\nLore will be released on Amazon on Oct. 13. The anthology series will follow a similar format as the podcast in that each episode will highlight a different legend from folklore in a documentary-style narrative. Walking Dead producer Gale Anne Hurd serves as the series’ showrunner.\n\nThe podcast was created by Aaron Mahnke in 2015 and was a pretty immediate success with its origin stories of werewolves, witches and vampires.\n\n‘Serial’\n\nPretty much the OG of podcast true crime, Serial Season 1 investigated the case of Adnan Syed, a high school student who was convicted of killing his ex-girlfriend. Sarah Koenig serves as a host for the series.\n\n20th Century Fox inked a deal back in 2015 to develop the show into a series, but the details are still in development. What we do know is that the show will be based more on the behind-the-scenes aspects of developing the podcast rather than the Syed case itself.\n\n‘Tanis’\n\nTanis is a mystery-horror fiction podcast that follows narrator Nic Silver as he attempts to unravel the mysteries of Tanis. What and where is it?\n\nAccording to The Hollywood Reporter, as of July 2017, the television rights for Tanis had been acquired by Universal Cable Productions, and the series was in development. No word yet when we can expect the series to air.\n\n‘The Bright Sessions’\n\nThe Bright Sessions has achieved wild popularity with over 6 million downloads. The fiction podcast tells the tales of a therapist and her supernatural patients.\n\nLike Tanis, the television rights for The Bright Sessions have also been acquired by Universal Cable Productions. The Hollywood Reporter said podcast creator Lauren Shippen, with the help of Grey’s Anatomy writer Gabrielle G. Stanton, is penning the script.\n\n‘Limetown’\n\nThis fiction podcast tells the story of journalist Lia Haddock as she details the disappearance of over 300 people at a neuroscience research facility in Tennessee. Limetown became the No. 1 podcast on iTunes within two months of its July 29, 2015, release.\n\nIn April 2016, Limetown writer and director Zack Akers wrote an email to fans about the plans to write a television script based on the show. “We have to convince a studio to pay for it, actors to be in it, and then networks to air it. All of these steps are very hard, and there’s a good chance it all falls apart pretty quickly. BUT there’s also the chance this happens, and then we’re making a TV show.”\n\n‘Homecoming’\n\nHomecoming already seems poised for television as it employs the voice talents of A-listers like Oscar Isaac, Catherine Keener and David Schwimmer. The podcast is a political thriller that tells the story of a caseworker at a secret government facility.\n\nJulia Roberts is in talks to star in the series, which is set to air on Amazon.\n\n‘Sword and Scale’\n\nOne of my personal favorite podcasts, Sword and Scale tells the true stories of some of the worst human acts in history. Each episode, the show tackles a different case or topic in the true-crime arena.\n\nOn Episode 91 of Sword and Scale, show host and creator Mike Boudet announced he was in talks to make the podcast into a television show with Propagate Content. He added on the show’s website, “We have some big names onboard which we’ll be announcing soon, but we’re very excited about how it’s all coming together.”\n\n‘Alice Isn’t Dead’\n\nAlice Isn’t Dead is the story of one woman’s search for her missing wife, Alice. Not only does she join up with a trucking company in the investigation, but the supernatural also has an eery role to play.\n\nThe Washington Post reported USA has acquired the rights to make the podcast into a show slated for a 2018 premiere.\n\n‘StartUp’\n\nABC picked up a pilot order back in 2016 for a show starring Zach Braff about the popular first season of the podcast. The comedy, called Alex, Inc., will follow the story of a man who decides to quit his job and start his own business. The series has since been picked up for a full season.\n\nBraff is also set to direct the first episode."
