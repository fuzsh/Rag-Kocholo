        "text": "Dark Horse Entertainment and Universal Cable Productions are sticking together.\n\nThe comic book company has renewed its first-look deal with the studio on the heels of Umbrella Academy‘s recent series order at Netflix.\n\nUnder the re-upped pact, the two will continue to develop and produce scripted programming based on Dark Horse’s vast library of comic books, in addition to working on new material.\n\nIn addition to the recent series order for Umbrella Academy, UCP is currently developing TV adaptations of Dark Horse properties Mind MGMT and Flutter, as well as adaptations of podcasts Tanis and The Bright Sessions.\n\n“Dark Horse Entertainment is a comic mastermind with deep knowledge of the genre and an expertise in developing content,” UCP exec vp development Dawn Olmstead said Monday in a statement. “We’re excited to continue to partner with Mike Richardson and Keith Goldberg as we kick off our series Umbrella Academy on Netflix and shepherd the many adaptations we have set up around town.”\n\nBased on the popular graphic novel by Matt Kindt, Mind MGMT follows a true crime writer searching for the truth behind a mysterious airline flight who discovers a secret government agency of spies with psychic abilities. Henry Lyme, the former top agent, has gone rogue and is working to investigate and dismantle the organization. Dan Cerone (The Blacklist) will adapt Mind MGMT for TV.\n\nFlutter is based on the critically acclaimed, award-winning LGBTQ graphic novel series created and written by Jennie Wood with art by Jeff McComsey about a teenage shapeshifter who turns herself into a boy to get the straight girl that she has a crush on. Katherine Lindberg and Marc Rosen (Sense8) are writing the television adaptation.\n\nBased on the serialized, bi-weekly podcast, Tanis follows Nic Silver on his search to unravel what he thinks might be the last great mystery of the internet age. “Tanis” is what happens when the lines of science and fiction start to blur. Lee Shipman (The Son) is attached to adapt with podcast creator Terry Miles. Sam Raimi (Evil Dead) and Debbie Liebling (South Park) will produce through their POD 3 banner, along with Dark Horse.\n\nThe Bright Sessions is described as a sci-fi drama that follows a mysterious therapist and her unique set of patients, each struggling with a supernatural ability. Created and written by Lauren Shippen, the acclaimed podcast has been downloaded over 6 million times. Gabrielle G. Stanton (Grey’s Anatomy, The Flash) and Shippen are penning the adaptation.\n\nIn addition to Umbrella Academy, Dark Horse and UCP’s previously announced projects include an adaptation of the comic book Harrow County. Syfy is also home to the Canadian co-production Dark Matter, which is based on the Dark Horse comic book of the same name. A TV adaptation of Dark Horse’s famed Sin City property, previously adapted for the big screen, is also in development at Weinstein Television.\n\n“Dark Horse is proud to continue its partnership with Universal Cable Productions. Our companies have worked together closely with great success. We have some exciting projects in the works and couldn’t be happier about continuing the relationship,” said Dark Horse Entertainment president Mike Richardson.\n\nUCP’s renewal deal comes as the rise of comic book TV adaptations show no signs of slowing down. Marvel has several new series premiering in the coming months with Hulu’s Runaways, Freeform’s Cloak and Dagger and New Warriors and ABC’s Inhumans, and the DC universe will expand again on The CW with the midseason addition of Black Lightning.\n\nThe renewal deal also comes as Comic-Con International 2017 prepares to kickoff on Wednesday."
