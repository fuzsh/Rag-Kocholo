        "text": "Designed as a responsive ecosystem, this interdisciplinary exhibition extends the ideas behind the video game, offering all visitors an opportunity to play it and step inside the world of its concepts, emotions and mechanics, while seated in Massan’s sculptural playstations. The exhibition is also a space to encounter the broader practices of a network of artists and thinkers – including Castiel Vitorino Brasileiro, Novíssimo Edgar, LYZZA, Jota Mombaça and Ventura Profana – with contributed works combining installation, textile, sound and poetry. These expand our capacity to imagine otherwise, embracing ancestral knowledge, ecological awareness, and an openness to transmutation and reverberation.\n\nInviting visitors to navigate through the lenses of decoloniality, queerness and decentralisation – technological, social, economic, and ideological – Third World is an experience that challenges us to rethink the ways in which we understand and orient ourselves in the world. As Massan says, “I want to create the experience of walking through possibilities and memories of life and narrative.”\n\nTaking cues from work developed for the game, Castiel Vitorino Brasileiro exercises a space of freedom with an earth installation. Novíssimo Edgar explores the construction of social fabric through character play, textile work and ceramics that reflects their in-game level design. LYZZA creates an immersive surround sound environment influenced by real-time gameplay that invites us to consider symbiosis and adaptive behaviour. Jota Mombaça‘s text-based wall intervention announces an architectural breach within the gallery space and offers an eye to possibility. Ventura Profana brings a digital collage and sculptural installation that lays the foundations for new infrastructures.\n\nweb3 Tokens\n\nThird World: The Bottom Dimension emerges from Massan’s interest in technological, social and economic decentralisation, and includes participatory digital tokens built on the Tezos blockchain. Players can record ‘memories’ of their own actions as they play the game, and by minting this record (or snapshot) on the blockchain, build a public archive of multiple perspectives and actions. In addition, a collection of limited editions will bring together Massan, their collaborators and a wider community of web3 artists.\n\nThe exhibition is an evolving project that presents new and experimental approaches for our visitors to experience web3 by minting memories of their gameplay on the Tezos blockchain.\n\nHow to mint a token at the exhibition: When you play the game you can use the in-game camera function (known as ‘Capture Power’) to take pictures or record short videos of gameplay. Once you finish playing you will be able to mint one of these pictures or short videos as a token, also known as an Non Fungible Token or NFT, on the energy-efficient Tezos blockchain. If you would like to mint a token of your game play during your visit, we advise you to open a Kukai wallet in advance here.\n\n”The exhibition makes spaces available for communities to be started. Players can record memories of their own actions as they play the game and by minting this record or snapshot with Tezos, build a public archive of multiple perspectives and actions.” Gabriel Massan\n\nView public archive of minted tokens here The Bottom Dimension Agents Report | Collection (objkt.com)\n\nFind out more about our wider work with Blockchain: The web3 element of Third World: The Bottom Dimension was developed with the artist following a period of R&D with consultants from Tezos and the wider Blockchain community, and Serpentine Arts Technologies Legal Lab.\n\nRadical Friends\n\nBlockchain Lab – Serpentine Galleries\n\nFuture Art Ecosystems – FAE3: Art x Decentralised Technologies\n\nTo keep updated about future web3 developments with Third World: The Bottom Dimension keep checking this page and watch out for announcements in the Arts Technologies newsletter – Sign up here"
