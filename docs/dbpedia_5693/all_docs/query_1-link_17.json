Wolfe, MD\n\nInstructors: Marco Rizzo, MD; Eric R. Wagner, MD; Steven J. Lee, MD; Heather Duyck, CHT\n\nThe gamut of treatment for wrist arthritis ranges from motion preserving techniques to complete arthrodesis. Current opinions and reviews of recent literature will be discussed to gain broader perspective on expected outcomes, with emphasis on optimizing the long term outcomes through proper patient selection and implantation technique. When to consider revision arthroplasty and salvage procedures, including use of current techniques, will also be demonstrated using specific cases.\n\nObjectives: Following this session, the participant will be able to:\n\nIndications for arthroplasty or other salvage techniques for wrist arthritis.\n\nIndications for arthrodesis for wrist arthritis.\n\nReview selection criteria to optimize outcomes.\n\nIdentify causes for early complications and late implant loosening.\n\nConsider options for revision and salvage of failures.\n\n118\n\nInnovations in Hand Fracture Management\n\nChair: R. Glenn Gaston, MD\n\nInstructors: Carlos Eduardo Torres Fuentes, MD; Chelsea Boe MD; Aviram M. Giladi, MD, MS; Gary Solomon, MSOT, MBA, CHT\n\nThis course will discuss expert tips and tricks for avoiding complications and achieving good outcomes in phalangeal and metacarpal fractures. Both common fracture patterns as well as complex injury patterns will be discussed. Techniques such as percutaneous pinning, plate fixation, and intramedullary screw fixation will be described, as well as external fixation and cerclage techniques. A case-based format will highlight keys for success and failure and cutting edge surgical techniques will be highlighted.\n\nObjectives: Following this session, the participant will be able to:\n\nDifferentiate stable fractures best served with nonoperative care from unstable fractures better suited for operative intervention.\n\nIdentify how to avoid complications by using improved surgical techniques and tips.\n\nAchieve improved results in the management of phalangeal fractures treated both operatively and nonoperatively.\n\n119\n\nManagement Of Bone Gaps In The Upper Extremity\n\nChair: Duretti T. Fufa, MD\n\nInstructors: David R. Steinberg, MD; Helen G. Hui-Chou, MD, FACS; Andrew Watt, MD; Kimberly G. Kraft, PT, DPT, CHT\n\nTrauma, infection, and extirpative oncologic surgery can result in skeletal defects of the upper extremity. These represent a reconstructive challenge with a spectrum of solutions available for management of these conditions. This session will employ an expert panel to describe solutions for various skeletal defects. Topics discussed will include: nonvascularized bone graft, Masquelet technique, vascularized bone graft, and engineered osteoconductive scaffolds.\n\nObjectives: Following this session, the participant will be able to:\n\nIdentify indications for each of the various techniques for bone gap reconstruction.\n\nBecome familiar with technical pearls and pitfalls in application of each of these techniques.\n\nDiscuss outcomes associated with each of these techniques.\n\n120\n\nThe Midnight Mangled Extremity\n\nChair: Bauback Safa, MD\n\nInstructors: Rudolf F. Buntic, MD; Aida Garcia Gomez, MD; Carlos Augusto Arroyo Sanchez, MD; Nora Barrett, OTR/L, CHT\n\nMangling hand injuries are challenging for hand and upper extremity surgeons. Decision-making for these injuries is complex, and it can be challenging to determine when a limb should be salvaged, and when the patient would be better off with prosthetic reconstruction. This session is designed to discuss decision-making, technical strategies, and outcomes for these injuries.\n\nObjectives: Following this session, the participant will be able to:\n\nIdentify injury factors that are predictive of successful limb salvage vs. amputation.\n\nPlan staged surgical intervention to optimize outcomes of biologic reconstruction.\n\nDiscuss the important aspects of prosthetic reconstruction and how to optimize utilization and function with upper extremity prosthetics.\n\n121\n\nAdvances in Small Joint Arthroplasty\n\nChair: A. Lee Osterman, MD\n\nInstructors: David A. Kulber, MD; Nina Suh, MD; Micheal Hayton, MD; Sheri B. Feldscher, OT, CHT\n\nMCP and PIP joint arthroplasty have gone through an evolution of materials and designs. There is also some debate, as well as surgeon preference, to surgical approaches for placing these implants; especially when it comes to PIP joint arthroplasty. Outcomes for these patients can be challenging and the primary outcome of pain relief has been fairly reliable with range of motion being much more unpredictable. This course will review the indications and surgical techniques of MCP, PIP and DIP joint arthroplasty, as well as how to optimize outcomes in the small joint arthroplasty patient. Consideration of surface replacement implants, silicone implants and meniscus allograph will be presented. The course will also discuss potential pitfalls and complications, and try to provide pearls for avoiding such situations. The final part of this instructional course lecture will then review what to do when you do run into complications and what salvage options are available. We will discuss the gamut of revision arthroplasty all the way to fusion. Appropriate rehabilitation based on approach and implant will be highlighted.\n\nObjectives: Following this session, the participant will be able to:\n\nIdentify surgical indications for small joint arthroplasty.\n\nDiscuss the volar versus dorsal approaches for implant placement.\n\nRecognize the advantages and disadvantages of various implant types.\n\nIdentify splint and rehab patients following surgery.\n\n122\n\nCrash Course in Nerve Evaluation: What's New in the Diagnosis of Nerve Injuries?\n\nChair: Christopher Dy, MD\n\nInstructors: Matthew Elrick, MD; Darryl Sneag, MD; David M. Brogan, MD\n\nMultiple modalities are used in the diagnosis of nerve injury and recovery including electrodiagnostic tests, MRI and ultrasound. This case-based course will review the utility of these different modalities, updates on novel applications, and tips on how to incorporate these into your practice.\n\nObjectives: Following this session, the participant will be able to:\n\nDiscuss the current modalities available to the nerve surgeon to image peripheral nerves.\n\nIdentify the benefits and limitations of current imaging techniques for nerve surgery.\n\nDiscuss the role of point-of-care ultrasound in the clinic and emergency setting.\n\nUtilize electrodiagnostic studies beyond the routine nerve compressions.\n\n123\n\nShow Me The Evidence: Dogma vs Science In Nerve Surgery\n\nChair: Catherine Curtin, MD\n\nInstructors: Andres Maldonado, MD; Jana Dengler, MD; Matthew Curran, MD; Kyle Y. Xu, MD\n\nAlthough our understanding of nerve injury, repair and recovery has evolved substantially over the past several decades, elements of our daily practice as nerve surgeons continues to be founded in dogma. This case-based session will explore approaches to common nerve injury scenarios and attempt to separate the science from dogma.\n\nObjectives: Following this session, participants will be able to:\n\nThe evidence for surgical techniques of nerve repair and managing a nerve gap including method of repair and type of nerve graft.\n\nThe evidence for surgical techniques of neuroma management.\n\nThe evidence for nerve regeneration including the speed of regeneration and factors contributing to recovery.\n\nThe evidence for post-operative management including duration of splinting, rehabilitation protocols, and interventions to optimize recovery\n\n124\n\nTendon versus Nerve Transfers for Reanimating the Intrinsic Hand\n\nChair: Harvey Chim, MD\n\nInstructors: Heather L. Baltzer, MD; Ryan W. Schmucker, MD; Rebecca J. Saunders, BS, PT/CHT\n\nMany new nerve transfers have emerged to restore intrinsic hand function. Tendon transfers, however, remain the standard of care for most hand surgeons. This course will provide a review of the nerve and tendon transfers for restoration of intrinsic function with special focus on indications, patient selection, comparative outcomes, and surgical techniques for intrinsic nerve transfers.\n\nObjectives: Following this session, participants will be able to:\n\nThe indications, patient selection, and anticipated outcomes with nerve and tendon transfers for the intrinsic hand.\n\nDiscuss the surgical technique to perform these nerve transfers.\n\nDevelop a treatment algorithm for choosing one treatment over the other.\n\n8:00 am - 8:05 am\n\nASPN President and Program Chair Welcome (Not for Credit)\n\nMichael W.
