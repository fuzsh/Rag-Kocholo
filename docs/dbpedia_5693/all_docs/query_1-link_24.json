        "meta_description": "Grey's Anatomy is a hospital drama that focuses on Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo), one of several third year residents at a Seattle Grace hospital. Along with her colleagues, Meredith struggles to maintain relationships while staying sharp at work.\r\n\r\nThe professional roles and real lives of a diverse group of surgeons collide unexpectedly in this Golden Globe-winning ABC television drama. As a third-year resident at Seattle Grace Hospital, Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo) tries hard to live up to the reputation of her legendary surgeon mother while hiding the fact that her mom now suffers from Alzheimer's disease. As if life weren't complicated enough, Meredith also marries boss, Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey). Meredith's friend and rival Cristina Yang (Sandra Oh) finds herself in a romance with 'army man' Owen Hunt (Kevin McKidd) how came to Seattle Grace from Afghanistan were he worked as a doctor. As for Meredith and Cristina's fellow residents (some not so much)-- Isobel \"Izzie\" Stevens (Katherine Heigl) and Alex Karev (Justin Chambers) -- they've got problems of their own. Izzie does not want to be judged by her underwear-model past and works hard but when she gets cancer, she gets fired and leaves her husband Alex. Alex is still better at bedding the ladies than bedside manner after his wife leaves and is trying to get over the grief. When Merediths little sister 'little grey' or Lexie Grey (Chyler Leigh) joined the picture in season 4 and is dating 'McSteamy' Mark Sloan (Eric Dane) who was married to Addison Montgomery (Kate Walsh [who now stars in the show Private Practice]). Arizona Robbins (Jessica Capshaw) turns out to be gay and now Callie Torres (Sara Ramirez) is now her partner. All eight residents still answer to the roar of senior resident Miranda Bailey (Chandra Wilson), affectionately known as \"the Nazi.\" But even Dr. Bailey jumps to it when Chief of Surgery Richard Webber (James Pickens Jr.) is on the scene. But there is one thing you must remember \"Medicine nor relationships can be defined in black and white. Real life only comes in shades of grey.\"",
