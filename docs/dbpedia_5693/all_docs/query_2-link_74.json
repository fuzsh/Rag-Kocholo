To discuss the best (and most disappointing) examples of powerful women in pop culture, Action Flick Chick Katrina Hill (Action Movie Freak) has assembled a team of women and men dangerous in their own right: Lesley Aletter (professional stuntwoman), Jenna Busch (Legion of Leia founder), Adrienne Curry (host/model/Tolkien enthusiast), Jane Espenson (Husbands), Alan Sizzler Kistler (TheMarySue.com), Bryan Q. Miller ( Batgirl), and Jennifer K. Stuller (Ink-Stained Amazon). Room 7AB\n\n3:00-4:00 When Magic & Myth Meet Main Street—When stories mix modern cities like Paris, L.A., and New York with magic, myth, and demon spawn, they are collectively known as Urban Fantasy, and many of today's popular authors are adding their otherworldly ingredients to the melting pots of modern (and not-so-modern) society. Jim Butcher (Skin Game), Seanan McGuire (Sparrow Hill Road), Richard Kadrey (The Getaway God), Thomas Sniegoski (The Remy Chandler Series), Amber Benson (Calliope Reaper-Jones series), and Greg van Eekhout (California Bones) discuss why something old with something new equals gold.

Petco Park\n\nYes, I still love Linkin Park, shut up.\n\nFRIDAY\n\nSo Friday is basically the fucking worst.

Exhibit Hall, Booth #5002\n\n10:00-11:00 Gender in Comics—Panelists explore both the role of gender in mainstream and independent comics, as well as the impact of gender politics on the business side of the industry and in the media.

Never fear, fans, Cartoon Network is bringing back the most mathematical show on TV to Comic-Con. You know what time it is!

Now stuck somewhere between half-alive and undead, Liv loses all traces of her former drive and ambition. She transfers her medical residency to the city morgue in order to reluctantly access the only real form of sustenance left available to her-and the only thing that allows her to maintain her humanity-human brains. But there are side effects to Liv's new diet: With each brain she consumes, Liv experiences \"visions\"-flashes of the corpse's memories-including, in some cases, clues as to how they were killed. iZombie makes its Comic-Con debut with a screening of the complete pilot episode, followed by a Q&A with series stars Rose McIver (Once Upon a Time), Malcolm Goodwin (Breakout Kings), Rahul Kohli (newcomer from the UK), and Robert Buckley (One Tree Hill), as well as executive producers Rob Thomas (Veronica Mars) and Diane Ruggiero-Wright (Veronica Mars).
