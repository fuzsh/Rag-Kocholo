Evaluating these statistics can aid in forming a more informed perspective on the safety of Horicon as a potential place to call home.\n\nHas Crime in Horicon Increased Since Last Year?\n\nYear-over-year crime data allows residents and potential residents to assess the crime in Horicon. A decrease in crime rates may indicate improving safety, while an increase could raise concerns. The year-over-year crime rate in Horicon has decreased by 4%. Violent crimes have increased by 250%, while property crimes have decreased by 26.1%. By comparing crime rates from one year to the next, authorities and communities can identify trends and patterns in criminal activity. This helps in understanding whether crime is increasing, decreasing, or remaining stable over time.\n\nPotential Causes for Crime in Horicon\n\nIn areas where employment options are limited or where a significant proportion of jobs offer meager wages, the likelihood of heightened unemployment and homelessness increases. Regions facing challenges related to unemployment or inadequate income may become more vulnerable to a surge in crime stemming from economic instability. While low unemployment rates tend to lead to reduced crime in most areas. Horicon currently has an unemployment rate of 2.6%, contrasting with the national average of 4.7%. This could be one of many factors that could contribute to a higher or lower crime rate.\n\nIn Horicon, the cost of living is 8.09% lower than the national average. A high cost of living can induce economic stress for locals, especially those with limited financial resources. When people grapple with soaring housing expenses, utility bills, healthcare costs, and other essential necessities, they may be driven towards criminal activities, including theft or fraud, as a means of financial survival. Conversely, cities boasting a lower cost of living may mitigate economic pressures and potentially result in reduced crime rates.\n\nIn cities grappling with housing affordability challenges, crime can emerge as a prominent issue. Certain individuals and families may find themselves needing to reside in cramped or subpar housing conditions, elevating stress levels and potentially fueling domestic conflicts and associated criminal incidents. Horicon has a median home price of $137,000, deviating from the national average of $184,700. Large disparities in housing costs can significantly impact the well-being of residents and the prevalence of crime within the community."
