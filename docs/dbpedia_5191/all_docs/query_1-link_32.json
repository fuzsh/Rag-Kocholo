        "text": "About The Area\n\nThe County of Warren, located in upstate New York, includes the magnificent Lake George Area, in addition to the cultural hub of the City of Glens Falls and the hometown flair of surrounding Southern Adirondack towns and villages. With more than 20 beautiful lakes, countless outdoor activities and dozens of exciting attractions, the Lake George Area offers the perfect opportunity for couples, families and group road-trippers to experience everything from outdoor adventure to peaceful solitude in the Southern Adirondack Mountains.\n\nA Destination Rich In History\n\nThe Lake George Area in the Adirondacks is brimming with history and culture. For instance, Cooper's Cave in Glens Falls is a major site first made well known in James Fenimore Cooper's novel, The Last of the Mohicans, also an award winning film. The Hyde Collection, a world renowned museum in Glens Falls, has works from daVinci, El Greco, Degas, Botticelli, Renoir, Cezanne, van Gogh, Picasso, and more. The Barton Garnet Mine in North Creek is home to the largest concentrations and formations of January's birthstone and New York State's gemstone. And then there's the history of local folklore—the famed “Lake George Monster”—which was admittedly created as a practical joke in 1904. Nevertheless, the original monster, fittingly named “Georgie,” is on display at the Clifton F. West Historical Museum in Hague and a replica can be found at the Lake George Historical Museum. Most every town in the county has a museum dedicated to its local history, including The Fort William Henry Museum in Lake George. Additionally, there are numerous historic sites and monuments located throughout the area.\n\nHistoric Figures\n\nFrom well-known art collectors and world-famous artists, to entrepreneurs, discoverers and Revolutionary War heroes—the Lake George Area in the Adirondacks has been host to many fascinating historical figures that helped shape the history of the Southern Adirondack Region. Warren County is named after General Joseph Warren, the Major-General of the Battle of Bunker Hill. Charles R. Wood, the Father of Theme Parks, founded Story Town, USA in 1954, later renaming it The Great Escape and Splashwater Kingdom. The world-famous artistic couple, Georgia O'Keeffe and Alfred Stieglitz, spent many summers in Lake George (many of O'Keeffe's paintings were of Lake George). And, it was at the Saratoga & North Creek Railway in the town of North Creek, that Vice President Theodore Roosevelt was handed a telegram informing him that President McKinley had died only three hours earlier. Later that day, Theodore Roosevelt was sworn in as the 26th President of the United States."
