        "text": "Situated on the far western edge of Horicon, the property features direct access to State Highway 33, over 66 shovel-ready acres of developable land and potential rail connectivity.\n\nThe Horicon City Council approved the creation of a new industrial park in July 2016.\n\nThe city purchased a 40-acre plot from Cynthia Wrucke, located at W5326 Highway 33, for the purpose of creating a new industrial park. The Horicon Community Development Corporation purchased three separate 40-acre plots from Wrucke in December 2015.\n\nAt that time, City Clerk/Treasurer Kristen Jacobson said Horicon couldn’t attract new industrial business because of a lack of available space.\n\n“The city is currently out of vacant land in our industrial park except for a three-acre plot,” she said.\n\nThe land was annexed by the city of Horicon from the town of Oak Grove and rezoned to limited industrial and heavy industrial land from prime agricultural land.\n\nThe property was also added into the Tax Increment District No. 5, which was created in 2015 to help with the John Deere expansion on East Lake Street."
