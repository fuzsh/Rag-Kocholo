        "text": "Matt Simpson, Supervisor of the Warren County Town of Horicon in the Adirondacks, is running for New York state Assembly. The Republican is running to replace Assemblyman Dan Stec in the 114th District. Simpson faces Democrat Claudia Braymer and Evelyn Wood on the SAM party line.\n\nMatt Simpson says it’s his experience in local government and business that sets him apart.\n\n“I’ve been supervisor in the Town of Horicon for seven years. Prior to that I was a town board member. And early on I focused on those priorities: our environment, our infrastructure, and also passing budgets that were below the tax cap while still meeting our needs,” said Simpson.\n\nSimpson faces two other candidates with local government experience, too: Claudia Braymer also sits on the Warren County Board of Supervisors representing Glens Falls, and Evelyn Wood is a former supervisor in the small Town of Thurman.\n\nSimpson says, though, it’s important to have different viewpoints in a state capitol controlled by Democrats.\n\n“Any power and control without accountability or the ability to take into all concerns doesn’t end up very well,” said Simpson.\n\nSimpson points to New York’s bail reform law that took effect at the start of the year and was partially amended months later – accusing Democrats of rushing the law through before it was “ready” to be passed.\n\nOn the response to COVID-19, Simpson praised Democratic Governor Andrew Cuomo for making hard choices to take steps to slow the spread of the disease earlier this year, but adds...\n\n“I believe now we’re at a point where we really need to take the information that we’ve learned and keep moving in the direction of getting back to normal,” said Simpson.\n\nSimpson objects to the governor’s threat of across-the-board spending cuts if a federal COVID-19 relief bill does not provide funding to state and local governments. Simpson says state money for education – which faces a 20 percent cut – needs to be preserved as officials look for ways to shore up a multi-billion-dollar budget gap exacerbated by the pandemic.\n\n“That is an essential priority of any elected representative. I think we need to look at ways that we can to encourage small businesses to grow and that means cutting the red tape and burdensome regulations and the cost of doing business in New York,” said Simpson.\n\nSimpson also laid out other spending priorities for the Adirondack district.\n\n“We need to focus on the infrastructure, cellular, broadband, and have that infrastructure that’s going to support a thriving business economy,” said Simpson.\n\nWhile some candidates have limited their face-to-face interaction with voters, Simpson says he’s continued to go door-to-door in the march to Election Day and hopes to meet with as many constituents as he can.\n\n“And I encourage everyone to go out and vote and ensure their voice is heard. It’s a very important responsibility we have in the United States,” said Simpson."
