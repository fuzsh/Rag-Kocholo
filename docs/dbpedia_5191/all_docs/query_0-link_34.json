R if the Republican Party candidate won, D if the Democratic Party candidate won and I if the Independent Party candidate won. The six elections (2000, 2004, 2008, 2012, 2016, 2020) would be expressed as six-letter word (R R D R R).\n\nThen we went a little further and added the dimension of magnitude. If the difference of victory was greater than 10 percent, the letter is upper case, and lower case if the difference was less than 10 percent. This allows us to see interesting voting patterns at just a glance.\n\nHere's the VoteWord for Iowa d r d d r. In the last six elections the state has been closely contested, voting narrowly for the Republican Party candidate in 2016 and 2020 after voting for the Democratic Party in 2008 and 2012. Virginia (r r d d d D) has voted for the Democratic Party in the last three elections.\n\nIndividual Campaign Contributions in Horicon, NY\n\nIn the last 4 years (2018-2021), there were 368 contributions totaling $20,720 to the Democratic Party and liberal campaigns, averaging $56 per contribution.\n\nIn the last 4 years, there were 28 contributions totaling $4,795 to the Republican Party and conservative campaigns, averaging $171 per contribution.\n\n(source: Federal Election Commission)"
