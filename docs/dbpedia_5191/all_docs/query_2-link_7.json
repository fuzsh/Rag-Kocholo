        "text": "I was raised in this area. Overall, the people I serve at work tend to be friendly and the scenery is beautiful due to the nearby marsh. There are a handful of small, locally owned businesses that I frequent, and the owners are all very kind people whom I greatly respect. However, I would definitely say that the community is not perfect. Especially at school, I often tend to feel disconnected from my classmates due to my appearance, beliefs, neurodivergence, and general identity, and I am not alone in this. Many people do not like to see those with differences, and will frequently use derogatory words. Although my time here was a valuable experience, I am excited to discover what more is out there for me."
