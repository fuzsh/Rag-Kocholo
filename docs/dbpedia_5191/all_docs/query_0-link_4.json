Public boat launches and winding country roads allow access to Brant Lake, Schroon Lake, Schroon River and numerous ponds. The impeccable views of the lakes and ponds are sure to appeal to everyone, and are greatly appreciated by locals and visitors alike.\n\nHoricon features many great outdoor Adirondack activities, like hiking on a vast network of trails, camping, canoeing, kayaking, and swimming. The fun and activities don't stop in the wintertime! Enjoy some of the best ice fishing, cross-country and downhill skiing, snowshoeing, and snowmobiling that the Adirondacks has to offer in and around Horicon."
