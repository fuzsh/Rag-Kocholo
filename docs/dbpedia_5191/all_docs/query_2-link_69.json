We promote a growth mindset in which learning is continuous and believe that all students can attain mastery of academic targets.\n\nThe Mayville community has shown its outstanding support for our schools through the recent completion of a $24.5 million construction and renovation project including the renovation of Mayville High School, the construction of a new state of the art fitness center, new technology education spaces, new agricultural science spaces, and capital maintenance/safety & security improvements at all three of our schools.\n\nMayville School District works collaboratively with local child care providers and preschools to offer 4K: St. Mary’s, St. John’s, Jaime’s Clubhouse and Parkview Primary. Each site has a highly-qualified, DPI-certified teacher who receives professional development and curriculum resources from the district.
