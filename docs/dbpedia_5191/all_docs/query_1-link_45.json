        "text": "WELCOME TO\n\nGREENWICH\n\nLocated just east of Saratoga Springs among rolling green hills, the charming town of Greenwich offers many fun things to do! Come enjoy easy access to many great restaurants, interesting shops & leisure activities, with some of New York & Vermont’s best recreation a short drive away.\n\nThe Horicon tribe is believed to be part of the early native population of Greenwich, with families settling in the area around 1763. Likewise, early European settlers were attracted by the advantages of water power. Grist mills and sawmills were followed by woolen, cotton, flax and land plaster mills. Later,paper mills and farming became the backbone of the town’s economy.\n\nThe Town of Greenwich was part of five different land patents until it was set off as a separate Town in 1803. The Village of Greenwich was first known as Whipple City, named for Job Whiple, its first successful industrialist. The village was the incorporated and renamed Union Village, but the name was again changed in 1867 to Greenwich.\n\nThe movement for the abolition of slavery was guided by Dr. Hiram Corliss in Greenwich. As such, the town was an important “station” of the Underground Railroad. In 1895, the Greenwich and Schuylerville Electric Railroad was established, providing\n\ntrolley transportation from the Capital District to Warrensburg until it was later absorbed by the Hudson Valley Railroad.\n\nThe village remains a trading center for the local area, with several locally-owned retail stores, car dealerships, restaurants, craft beverage taprooms and business services dotted along the main streets. You can take a self-guided walking tour of historic locations and of the buildings involved in the Underground Railroad."
