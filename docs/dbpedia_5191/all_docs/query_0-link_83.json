        "text": "HORICON, Wis., Smack in front of Horicon's pub lic library is a neat red wood sign pointing eastward and stating: “Our Sister City, Senonches, France, 4,494 miles.”\n\nActually, there aren't that many residents of this tiny central Wisconsin town who need such exact directions. But the sign is a constant re minder of Horicon's enthusi astic participation in the sister city program, a grow ing element in the visionary “people‐to‐people” effort be gun back in 1956 by Presi dent Eisenhower to encourage nonofficial communication between Americans and plain people in other parts of the world.\n\nHoricon is one of 400 vil lages, towns, and cities throughout the United States that are linked today with 449 similar communities in 60 foreign countries.\n\nThirty of these affiliations have been effected since January, proof, according to the Town Affiliation Associa tion, that fears of a new, post‐Vietnam isolationism in America are greatly exagger ated.\n\nThe association, a private organization funded partly by a State Department grant and partly by grants from private foundations, serves as the broker in organizing sister city committees and arrang ing the affiliations.\n\nSome Cases of Urgent Aid\n\nFor the most part, these joinings have been on the level of cultural and educa tional exchanges, with no thought that either of the “sisters” would provide aid or charity to the other.\n\nBut there have been in stances when one community has been involved in an emergency or a natural dis aster and the other has mobilized to provide the things it needed to survive.\n\nLast Thanksgiving, for ex ample, officials in Hialeah, Fla., received a frantic call from Managua, Nicaragua, its sister city, asking for help in combating a polio epidemic. Within 10 days Hialeah had sent six iron kings and nearly $100,000 worth of medical supplies to Managua.\n\nPensacola, Fla., raised more that $10,000 for Chimbote, Peru, after an earthquake devastated the area.\n\nModesto, Calif., sent more that $250,000 worth of medi cal supplies, many of them donated by local drug concents to Barranquilla, Colom bia, to help fight a flu epi demic that had caused the deaths of 3,500 children.\n\nNot all of the aid has been from wealthy United States communities to underdevel oped areas. In Seattle last winter, prolonged unemploy ment was causing hunger and Kobe, Japan, which had received relief supplies from Seattle after World War II, sent several tons of rice to its sister city.\n\nFinanced by Citizens\n\nHoricon, one of the newest participants in the program, established its sister city link with Senonches in 1970.\n\nThe Horicon program, like those in most other communi ties, is financed almost en tirely by private energies. The town gives the sister city committee $150 for stamps, and the rest is up to them.\n\nSenonches, whose popula tion of about 3,400 is almost exactly the same as Horicon's, is, like Horicon, a tidy, prosper ous farming and small manu facturing center about the same distance west of Chartes as Horicon is north of Milwaukee.\n\nThe two communities also have another important link: In each the John Deere Com pany has a small assembly plant producing garden and small farm implements. In deed, it was the company's initiative that led to the sister city arrangement.\n\nSuch common interests have often been the determining factor in pairing other sister cities. Dayton, Ohio, and its two sister cities, Augsburg, Germany, and Oiso, Japan, all have plants of the National Cash Register Company. As pen, Colo., and Garmish‐Par tenkirken, Germany, are both winter sports areas and sum mer resorts.\n\nThe expansion of commu nity horizons beyond strictly local interests is, in almost all participating communities, furthered by exchanges of official delegations and stu dent groups, some of whom come to live a full year in sister city homes.\n\nEvery other year, Omaha raises funds to send a dele gation of Nebraskans to visit Shizuoka, Japan, its sister city, and the Japanese regu larly return the compliment. Officials and citizens of Hagerstown, Md., have for more than a decade been ex changing visits with their counterparts in Wesel, Ger many.\n\nThe heights of romantic sister city visiting may well have been achieved there with the marriage of Sally Burns, daughter of Hagers town's former Mayor Wins low Burns, to Karl Heinz Buschmann, son of a promi nent Wesel family.\n\n“We've started slowly here, but already several Horicon families have stopped over in Senonches to visit and the Mayor of Senonches has been here,” said Art Learman, a Horicon interior decorator and furniture dealer who heads the town's sister city committee.\n\n“Neither Horicon nor Senonches is the kind of place a foreign tourist would head for naturally,” he added. “But being a sister city gives some of our traveling people here the feeling that they have some place like home to go to in Senonbhes when they are in Europe.”\n\nBesides the library sign there are other reminders in Horicon's of its tie with Senonches. One of the new streets opened recently in Horicon is called Rue de Se nonches.\n\n‘France Day’ Proclaimed\n\nLast Dec. 21, by prear rangement between the sister city committees in Horicon and Senonches, virtually every house in each town turned on its Christmas lights.\n\nThis spring, April 24 was proclaimed “France Day” in Horicon. The town's bakeries produced French pastries that day, the main street was decked with the French Tri color, and that night 120 per sons, quite a respectable num ber for Horicon, came out to a town meeting to view slides of Senonches.\n\nThis week, art students from Horicon High School were shipping paintings to Senonches where they will be displayed and offered for sale. This spring, Senonches High School students sent Horicon High a display of French dolls and an exhibit of photographs of Senonches.\n\n“We're working toward a student exchange program next year,” Mr. Learman said. “Then we're pointing for the highlight, a trip to Senonches in 1974 by the 50‐member Horicon High School Band. We'll raise the money here for the visit and we're expect ing the Senonches town band to come here in 1976.”\n\nHow aware a community is of its sister city activities probably depends on its size. In a town as small as Horicon, Mr. Learman said, everybody knows about Senonches.\n\n“Horicon believes we've never had really good public relations abroad,” he said. “It's too often too stiff, too official and self‐serving. The good will we're getting, the knowledge we're getting about another community whose problems are surprisingly like hours, is the cheapest foreign relations you could ask for.”"
