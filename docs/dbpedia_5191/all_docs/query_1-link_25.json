        "text": "Horicon Town Court\n\nPO Box 31\n\n6604 State Route 8\n\nBrant Lake, NY 12185\n\nTown Court Justice is held in the Horicon Community Center, at the address above.\n\nAnalysis and Commentary: The Town of Horicon has a population of 1,389 according to the U.S. Census (2010), and covers 71.8 square miles of land, located in northern Warren County, New York. The town is located within Adirondack State Park, and includes 5.7 square miles of water in the form of Brant Lake and Schroon Lake. New York State Route 8 passes through town in an easterly direction.\n\nHoricon is the site of the Curtis Read Scout Reservation, a Boy Scout camp, in Brant Lake, and was established in the 1920s.\n\nCourt is in session on the 2nd and 4th Wednesday of each month from 10:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m., and again from 2:00 p.m. until completion.\n\nAre you looking for a New York Traffic Ticket Defense Lawyer and want to determine who is the best attorney for you? You’ve come to the right place. While there are many lawyers who claim to be super lawyers, not every lawyer’s skill set may be best suited for your fact specific case. Some lawyers handle only divorce cases while others handle only small claims cases. As you can imagine, not every legal skill set may be transferable to your case. As such, they may not have the necessary experience or skill to give you the best defense possible.\n\nWe recommend you consider these Top 5 factors before retaining an attorney:\n\n1. Is the attorney’s practice limited to or significantly dedicated to speeding ticket defense or traffic ticket defense?\n\nThere are thousands of solo practitioners that claim to be proficient in 10 or more areas of law. While many of them can do a good job in certain practice areas, there is a good chance that they are not proficient in Vehicle Traffic Law or they may not be able to dedicate the time necessary to defend what they will call a “simple traffic” matter thereby hurting your defense.\n\nAt our law firm, we recognize your “simple traffic” matter is not so simple. In so doing, we handle your case with the proper attention it deserves. We know many things are at stake including hundreds if not thousands of dollars in fines, penalties, insurance increases, and time lost. Not to mention, we also know what very few lawyers know—a conviction to a simple speeding ticket can carry a 15 or more days in jail.\n\n2. Does the attorney have a track record?\n\nAlthough no attorney can attest that their prior success can guarantee a similar outcome in future cases, its important that you have some knowledge of their past performance. For example, is your ticket their first ticket defense case? Is the attorney you’re speaking to experienced in the court where you received the ticket? Are they familiar with the Judge, prosecutor, police officer, and court staff?\n\nAt our law firm, we have represented thousands of individuals throughout New York State. We are pleased to discuss our more than 30 years of legal experience with any potential client. Read our ticket defense testimonials.\n\n3. Has the attorney kept up to date with the changing landscape of the law?\n\nHave they participated in any relevant continuing legal education programs? Every area of law can change significantly and rather frequently. Every change in the law can have a significant impact on your case.\n\nAt our firm, we stay on top of the law and complete a minimum of 12 hours of continuing legal education a year. We also lecture of on variety of topics to bar associations, professionals, and community groups.\n\n4. Does the attorney have any peer recognition?\n\nIn other words, do other lawyers in the field respect your lawyer? How do other attorneys, adversaries, clients, and judges perceive this lawyer?\n\nAt our firm, we are recognized by our clients and peers as being some of the best lawyers in New York State. You may want to check out an independent website such as avvo.com.\n\n5. Is the attorney accessible?\n\nOnce you retain a lawyer, will they return your call or respond to your emails? Obviously, you will want to maintain contact with your lawyer. Some lawyers will only have their assistants speak to you.\n\nAt our firm, it is our goal to respond to our clients within one hour of being contacted.\n\nAbout us: our attorneys have significant experience practicing traffic ticket defense law. We are lead by a former prosecutor and our experience spans over three decades. We have been recognized by our peers as some of the best lawyers in New York. Give us a call at 800-893-9645."
