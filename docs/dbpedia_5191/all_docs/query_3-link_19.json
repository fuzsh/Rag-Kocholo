        "meta_description": "Welcome to Horicon Marsh! At more than 33,000 acres, Horicon Marsh is one of the largest freshwater marshes in the United States and is a critical rest stop for thousands of migrating ducks and Canada geese. It is recognized as a Wetland of International Importance, as both Globally and State Important Bird Areas and is also a unit of the Ice Age Scientific Reserve. Located in Dodge and Fond du Lac counties, Horicon Marsh is fed by the Rock River which flows through the refuge following a course through southern Wisconsin and eventually ending in the Mississippi River at Rock Island, Illinois.",
