        "text": "Horicon, New York\n\nHoricon is a large and rural town in Warren County, New York. Horicon is a Native American word for \"pure waterâ or \"clear.â The town is roughly thirty-five miles north of the small city of Glen Falls. Schroon Lake and the Schroon River form the western town line. Horicon also encompasses Brant Lake and several other smaller lakes. The town is considered part of New Yorkâs âNorth Countryâ region. Horicon covers seventy-two square miles, most of it being forestland of the Adirondack Park. , the town had an estimated population of 1,500. The townâs hamlets are Adirondack, Brant Lake, Pottersville, South Horicon, and Starbuckville. The town is also home to the Curtis S. Read Scout Reservation (also known as Camp Read), one of the oldest Boy Scout camps, in operation since the 1920âs.\n\nTraffic Tickets in Horicon\n\nHoriconâs main road is New York State Route 8. It runs north-east and southwest through the center of town. As it crosses town it passes by the largest lake, Brant Lake. Taking NYS-8 south brings you to the Hamlet of Brant Lake. Continuing southbound will bring you to the neighboring town of Bolton and the passing interstate, I-87 (Adirondack Northway). Along the western town line runs County Route 64 (East Schroon River Road). Taking it north brings you to the hamlet of Pottersville in Chester. Taking it south will bring you to Starbuckville.\n\nThe town does not have a police department. All tickets issued in Horicon are written by the New York State Police and the Warren County Sheriffâs Office. Most traffic stops occur on the NYS-8. Most victims of traffic stops are summer visitors that are not familiar with the roads. The most common charge issued on NYS-8 is speeding. Other common charges include driving with a suspended license, tailgating, and leaving the scene of an accident. The Horicon Town Court (Horicon Justice Court) will adjudicate any violation written in town. The court is located at the Town of Horicon Community Center on NY-8.
