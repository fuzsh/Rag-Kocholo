        "meta_description": "HORICON Horicon is a hidden treasure comprised of two hamlets, Brant Lake and Adirondack, and situated a bit off the beaten path. Horicon, once a sleepy country town, is being discovered as one of natureâ€™s little gems. Brant Lake, Schroon Lake, Schroon River and a myriad of quiet ponds and creeks are accessible by public boat launches and winding country roads. A quaint general store in Adirondack and a public beach on Schroon Lake await you. The picturesque Mill Pond in Brant Lake is the perfect spot for a stroll, picnic or swim at the beach. Fishing from a boat, bridge, shoreline or in the middle of a stream should satisfy any angler. Hike trails into quiet ponds or the Pharaoh Lake Wilderness to camp, canoe, kayak or just commune with the wonders of nature. Winter brings ice fishing, cross-country skiing, snowshoeing or snowmobiling on well-groomed trails.",
