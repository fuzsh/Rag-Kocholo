London: Granada, 1983. First Edition. First printing (paperback original). Inscribed on title page to Minnesota science fiction author and poet John Calvin Rezmerski, "with best wishes," signed, undated but apparently contemporary with publication. Mass market paperback; 317pp. Slight external rubbing, but still a tight, Near Fine copy with minimal tanning to the text margins.

Sequel to "Roderick" (1980). Sladek (1937-2000), a Minnesota author perhaps best remembered for his surrealistic science fiction collaborations with Thomas Disch.

Price: $45.00
