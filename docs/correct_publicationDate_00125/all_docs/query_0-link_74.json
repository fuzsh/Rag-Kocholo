        "text": "John Sladek (1937-2000), Midwestern ambassador to the British New Wave science fiction movement, purveyor of antic satire, occasional collaborator with Thomas M. Disch. Now sadly obscure in the US.\n\nScience fiction, it seems to me, constitutes the right brain hemisphere of contemporary fiction (the dreaming part). My work ... is probably somewhere near the lobotomy scars.[1]\n\nNotes are here for these books:\n\nRoderick\n\nTik-Tok (under construction)\n\nI recommend reading anything you can find by him, but my other favorite is probably The Reproductive System.\n\nOther reading"
