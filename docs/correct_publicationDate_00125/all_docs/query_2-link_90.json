It was a minor one with no damage to my heart but I did have an angiogram and a stent in one artery that was mostly blocked. I spent two days in the hospital mostly waiting for a spot to have the angiogram and being bumped by people who needed it much worse than I did (there were two “code blue” cardiac arrests while I was there). I’m in fine shape right now but we’re looking into ways I can mitigate future risks. I missed my annual trip to Los Angeles but I’m now preparing for MiniCon (here in town) and then the Windy City Pulp & Paper Show (in Chicago). So I’m staying busy and trying to change my diet a bit and exercise more (slinging boxes of books apparently hasn’t been enough).\n\nThanks for all your support and Remember to “buy independent”.\n\nCHEERS,\n\nGREG\n\nNEW SCIENCE FICTION, FANTASY, AND HORROR\n\nTomi Adeyemi – Children of Blood and Bone HC (Henry Holt 2018) YA Fantasy. Zélie Adebola remembers when the soil of Orïsha hummed with magic. Burners ignited flames, Tiders beckoned waves, and Zelie’s Reaper mother summoned forth souls. But everything changed the night magic disappeared. Under the orders of a ruthless king, maji were targeted and killed, leaving Zélie without a mother and her people without hope. Now, Zélie has one chance to bring back magic and strike against the monarchy. With the help of a rogue princess, Zélie must outwit and outrun the crown prince, who is hell-bent on eradicating magic for good. Danger lurks in Orïsha, where snow leoponaires prowl and vengeful spirits wait in the waters. Yet the greatest danger may be Zélie herself as she struggles to control her powers—and her growing feelings for the enemy. $18.99\n\nPaolo Bacigalupi / Tobias Buckell – The Tangled Lands 1st Ed. HC (Saga Press 2018) Fantasy novel. Khaim, The Blue City, is the last remaining city in a crumbled empire that overly relied upon magic until it became toxic.

HC (Tor 2018) Donovan was shot by a cop. For jaywalking, supposedly. Actually, for arguing with a cop while black. Four of the nine shots were lethal–or would have been, if their target had been anybody else. The Foundation picked him up, brought him back, and trained him further. “Lethal” turns out to be a relative term when magic is involved. When Marci was fifteen, she levitated a paperweight and threw it at a guy she didn’t like. The Foundation scooped her up for training too. “Hippie chick” Susan got well into her Foundation training before they told her about the magic, but she’s as powerful as Donovan and Marci now. They can teleport themselves thousands of miles, conjure shields that will stop bullets, and read information from the remnants of spells cast by others days before. They all work for the secretive Foundation…for minimum wage.\n\nWhich is okay, because the Foundation are the good guys. Aren’t they? $25.99\n\nLois McMaster Bujold – Penric’s Fox 1st Ed.
