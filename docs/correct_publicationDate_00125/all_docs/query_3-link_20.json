        "text": "To what extent did slavery and other racial issues enter into Smollett's fictional world? How much would Smollett, born and educated in 1720s and 1730s Britain, have been aware of slavery? How, apart from his experiences in the Caribbean in the early 1740s, would he have become aware? How did his Caribbean experience figure, both personally and fictionally? What charge would the slavery issue carry in his fiction and how would that compare with its treatment in other contexts such as his nonfictional writings? In seeking answers to these questions, I have begun to get a sense of the complexity of Smollett's racial consciousness in Roderick Random, a complexity of which this essay offers a very preliminary and provisional account.\n\nRoderick Random goes from rags to riches in a series of unexpected events. He travels from Scotland to London, becomes a surgeon on board a war ship, takes part in the most violent battles of the 1740s, visits Bath and discovers the London underworlds. He is, thus, constantly in motion. As he moves from a social level to another, he encounters more than a hundred other funny characters, odd caricatures which compose altogether a scathing satire of Smollett’s contemporary society. Roderick Random is a provocative novel. It plays with the political, economic and moral ideas of the time, and portrays the abuse of institutional authority. It overturns classical representations of the body, and explores the general instability of identities. This book offers an interpretation of the novel in its eighteenth-century context, giving the necessary historical background information to help a twenty-first century reader. It also features a great number of close-readings, scanning the poetics of Smollett’s prose in which language is both a tool and a pleasurable end.\n\nThis inability to understand randomness in our daily lives has prompted many authors to explore this rather delightfully mysterious world of chance events. Leonard Mlodinow is a star physicist (Caltech, Max Plank Institute for Physics and Astrophysics), a bestselling author and a deft enabler of otherwise puzzling things . Annoyed by the inadequacy of randomness to penetrate the popular psyche, L. Mlodinow sets out on a quest to redress this knowledge gap.\n\n4 documents accessible via the Issue 10.2 webpage: A critically annotated transcription of Robert Duncan's reading list for his H.D. class at New College, San Francisco in 1982.
