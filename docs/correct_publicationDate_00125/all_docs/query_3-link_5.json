        "text": "The most creative period of the author John Sladek, who has died aged 62 of hereditary lung disease, coincided with his time in England from the mid-1960s to 1986. A London vantage point seemed to offer new perspectives on his midwestern origin; repeatedly he used the metaphors of science fiction to create black satire and blacker farce about the United States, especially the midwest. In 1982 he mentioned plans to set a book in Albania but ruefully admitted: \"It'll probably come out looking exactly like the American midwest.\"\n\nSladek entered Britain's SF scene during the New Wave upheaval, when Michael Moorcock gleefully outraged traditionalists by encouraging avant-garde experiments in New Worlds magazine. This was a good home for an author whose influences were William Gaddis and Joseph Heller rather than Isaac Asimov and Robert Heinlein; who loved wordplay, ciphers and surrealism (one collection is titled Keep The Giraffe Burning); and who endured repeated comparisons with Kurt Vonnegut. What he shared with Vonnegut was extravagant humour overlaying a sometimes cheerful, sometimes chilly pessimism: Sladek was funnier, though, and arguably more grown-up.\n\nHis favourite mirrors of fallible humanity were robots and artificial intelligences, often more sympathetic than his absurdly tic-ridden, trend-obsessed, culture-programmed human characters. The Reproductive System (1968) overruns America with little grey boxes that eat technology and spawn more boxes. The hapless hero of The MÃ¼ller-Fokker Effect (1970) is converted to computer tape and put to bizarre uses; this novel's embarrassing-to-say title was a deliberate perversity. Sladek's finest work, Roderick, Or The Education Of A Young Machine (1980-83) offers an extended, Candide-like exploration of our follies as seen by a robot innocent.\n\nConversely, the antihero of Tik-Tok (1983) is an engagingly amoral mechanism whose defective \"Asimov circuits\" allow him to murder his way to the top, eventually becoming US vice-president. Tik-Tok won the British SF Association Award. By the time of Bugs (1989), Sladek was back in Minnesota, earning his living as a technical writer. Although the inevitable robot appears, Bugs focuses - surely autobiographically - on the disori entation and anomie of an English immigrant writer working for a cybernetics firm in yet another comic-inferno refraction of America.\n\nSerial killers stalk, prime-time TV is filled with the presidential sanity hearings, and menus offer Spaghetti Pinocchio: \"A meld of robust pesto that segues with a quietly poshified generosity of pine nuts webbed in a spunky cloudlet of homely pasta that does not noble it up unduly...\"\n\nBesides SF, Sladek restlessly explored other genres. He collaborated with his friend Thomas M Disch on the thriller Black Alice (1968), darkly satirising US race issues, and on a spoof Gothic novel by-lined Cassandra Knye; Sladek also wrote a solo \"Knye\" Gothic. His enthusiasm for conscious artificiality of plot resulted in two polished impossible-crime novels in the \"Golden Age\" detective mode, Black Aura (1974) and Invisible Green (1977).\n\nUrged by Moorcock to document the irrational byways of modern thought, Sladek produced the useful and funny The New Apocrypha: A Guide to Strange Sciences and Occult Beliefs (1973). The realisation that pseudoscience could be highly profitable was all too tempting: as James Vogh he published Arachne Rising (1977), laboriously justifying a \"long suppressed\" 13th zodiac sign, Arachne the Spider. One of the invented case studies is of Cassandra Knye. Eventually he summarised this project as \"a gigantic waste of time\".\n\nSladek was a brilliant maverick author who claimed to read very little SF - Disch and Philip K Dick excepted - but nevertheless parodied it with wicked skill, and found his melancholy comedies best appreciated by the broad-church SF audience. He deserved a far wider readership.\n\nThough cheerful and conversationally hilarious to the end, he knew that death was coming sooner rather than later. He also knew he was not forgotten: five Sladek books are scheduled for British re-issue in the near future.\n\nHe is survived by his first wife Pamela Sladek (divorced 1986) and their daughter, and by his second wife Sandra Gunter (married 1994)."
