It was about his career.\n\n\n\nJust to clarify, Matthew, I did not write the obit on the SFWA Web\n\nsite; I only write (when necessary) the obits for the SFWA Online\n\nUpdate, an e-mail newsletter. I don't enjoy the job, but it comes with\n\nbeing the editor.\n\nIn this case, I drew heavily on John Clute's very flattering (and, I\n\nthink, respectably complete) profile of Sladek in THE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF\n\nSCIENCE FICTION. As it happens, Clute does mention all four\n\ncollections of short fiction, though in practically the same breath he\n\nalludes to \"the oddly uncommercial course of [Sladek's] career.\"\n\nI wouldn't be surprised to learn that Sladek had a higher profile in\n\nthe UK than in the US. The New Wave was 30+ years ago, and the\n\nhalf-life of reader awareness nowadays seems to be about six months.\n\nNotwithstanding the passion of Sladek's fans and admirers, I think\n\nSladek was probably not even on the radar of most American SF readers.\n\n(Which raises the question, just how big is the natural audience for\n\nexperimental literary fiction, whatever the genre?) The closest he\n\ncame to a mass-market presence was probably the DAW edition of\n\nTIK-TOK, and that was 15 years ago. Clute seems to imply that it was\n\nnever any different, closing Sladek's profile with what sounds like a\n\nplea: \"We need his attention; he deserves ours.\"\n\n\n\nOn Sun, 12 Mar 2000 18:57:22 -0000, \"Michael Davis\"\n\n<mic...@michaelscycles.freeserve.co.uk> carefully left the following\n\nthoughtprints where they could be seen:\n\n> Or that he could not get his later\n\n>work published.\n\nThat, sadly, is becoming a fact of life in a business which has fewer\n\n\"book people\" and more computerized sales reports influencing what\n\ngets published. A lot of writers who have an audience--just not a big\n\nenough one--have been hitting the wall.\n\nPerhaps print-on-demand and digital publishing will eventually offer\n\nan alternative that will allow writers who do not have the broader\n\nappeal demanded by the mass-market publishing equation to continue\n\ntheir careers.

Once the name is\n\n>well-known it tends to stick in peoples' heads.\n\nHi, Steve.\n\nFWIW, I was speaking primarily of the much larger number of midlist\n\nwriters rather than toplist people like Larry Niven. Because books go\n\nout of print so quickly now, and because backlist is so rarely\n\nreissued, most writers have little to no presence in the racks when\n\nthey're \"between books.\" That situation favors those who write more\n\nquickly, two or three novels a year, over those who write more slowly,\n\na novel every year or two or three. The former stay in the\n\nconsciousness of the readers and booksellers; the latter fade from\n\nconsciousness. In extreme cases, they can even find themselves cast as\n\na \"first novelist\" again and again. And even writers of substantial\n\nreputation are affected by this dynamic when they stop writing or die.\n\nI actually had an editor for a major imprint take a pass on a cover\n\nblurb from Fred Pohl for one of my novels, explaining in response to\n\nmy stunned protestations that Pohl \"wasn't a big enough name.\"\n\n>Perhaps this is why series are so popular with publishers -- you don't\n\n>have to remember author names and associate a new book with his previous\n\n>books.

Maybe even more than\n\n\"comfortable with\"--maybe \"fond of.\" A successful series becomes a\n\nBrand Name, with all the attendant marketing advantages.
