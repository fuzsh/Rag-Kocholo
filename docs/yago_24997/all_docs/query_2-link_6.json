        "text": "FRANCIS JOSEPH I OF AUSTRIA (1830 – 1916) AND HIS WIFE EMPRESS ELISABETH OF AUSTRIA (SISSI,1837 – 1898) :THE MOST BELOVED EMPEROR AND EMPRESS OF HABSBURG MONARCHY. FRANCIS JOSEPH WAS TROUBLED BY NATIONALISM DURING HIS ENTIRE REIGN.HE CONCLUDED THE ASTRO - HUNGARIAN COMPROMISE OF 1867,WHICH TRANSFORMED THE AUSTRIAN EMPIRE INTO THE ASTRO - HUNGARIAN EMPIRE,UNDER HIS DUAL MONARCHY.\n\nFranz Joseph and Elisabeth, the ‘perfect couple’ of the Austrian monarchy, have gone down more in the annals of popular literature than in history. The emperor falls in love with a beautiful young princess Sissi and takes her back to his palace, such is the stuff of fairytales.This did not sit well with Franz Joseph’s most powerful advisor,his mother. Franz Joseph I,the third longest reigning European monarch (67 years).\n\nFranz Joseph Karl was born on August 18, 1830 at Schönbrunn Palace in Vienna, Austria. He was the eldest of the four children of Archduke Franz Karl of Austria (son of Emperor Franz I of Austria and his second wife Maria Theresa of Naples and Sicily) and Princess Sophia of Bavaria (daughter of King Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria and Princess Caroline of Baden).\n\nAt the age of eighteen he became Emperor of Austria Dec. 2, 1848, and King of Hungary June 8, 1867. Having endured innumerable crises in his 48 year reign, he realized that everything he had striven for was at risk as he lay dying in 1916\n\n1854: The Wedding of Emperor Francis Joseph and Empress Sissi.On this day, Austrian Emperor Francis Joseph I and Bavarian princess Elisabeth, known by the nickname Sissi, were married in Vienna. The two of them met the year before. It is interesting that Elizabeth was Francis Joseph’s first cousin (their mothers were sisters).The mother of Francis Joseph wanted her son to marry Elizabeth’s older sister Helene, so she arranged an appointment in Bad Ischl, a famous summer resort in the Austrian Alps. Helene traveled with her mother and younger sister, 15-year-old Elizabeth.Francis Joseph was 23 years old at the time, and he instantly fell in love when he saw Elizabeth. He neglected to propose Helene and defiantly told his mother that he would either marry Elizabeth or remain single.Five days later, the engagement of Elizabeth and Emperor were announced. They were married on this day in 1854, when she was only 16 years old, in St. Augustine’s Church in Vienna.Imperial weddings were traditionally held in that church near the Viennese imperial court. Empress Maria Theresa and Maria Luisa (Napoleon’s second wife) were also married at that church.This dynastic church holds urns containing the hearts of as many as 54 former Habsburg rulers and archdukes.Helene (Nene), and Elizabeth (Sisi) are sisters; both are Duchesses of Bavaria. The elder sister, quiet and withdrawn, is the opposite of her younger sister who is a free spirit, independent and precocious. While one would like to enter a nunnery, the other has dreams of a bright and exciting future. Therefore, when Helene, 18, was summoned by her Aunt Sophie, The Archduchess of Austria, to marry her son Franz Joseph, 23, she was horrified and disappointed. Her sister, only 15, was exuberant and joyous. She could not wait to leave and go to Austria to be her sister’s confidante. When they arrived there, it was Sisi who suddenly felt herself attracted to one of the soldiers while Nene held back, joyless and filled with gloom and trepidation. When the soldier beheld Sisi, he too felt himself drawn to her. It turned out, it was not Sisi he was meant to be attracted to, but Nene. Unbeknownst to the women, the soldier was their cousin, 23 year old Franz Joseph, the Emperor himself.Although separated by several years, the two fell deeply in love, and although he was betrothed to her sister, they defied protocol and married. The author presents a picture of an Empress at once glorious and blissful and then an Empress who falls into a state of despair because she is shut out from the affairs of state and from the care and nurturing of her own children. Her husband and his mother have an unnatural affinity towards each other and an unbreakable bond of loyalty. She rarely sees him as there is war in the air, and she is desperately lonely. At 15, she thought she met the love of her life. At 16, she married him, and by the age of 17, she already had a child, a daughter soon to be followed by another. While it may in fact be true, that Sisi was too young to bear the burden of an empire and a family, she was never given the opportunity to even try. The Archduchess had never taken a liking to her and she immediately took each child and reared them. Sisi was powerless to defy her because Franz Joseph was in complete agreement with her.Feeling like an outsider, Sisi withdrew from court life whenever she could. Although she loved Franz Joseph completely, she felt neglected and alone. She was not Austrian. When, Princess Sophie, her eldest daughter succumbed to illness, she sank into a state of deep depression from which she did not recover for several years. She, too, became ill. She relinquished control of her younger daughter and removed herself from the family, returning to her home in Bavaria, to the Possenhofen Castle where she hoped to recover from her illness and depression. She remained away for an extended period of time, traveling and gaining strength, dreading her return to the place in Vienna where she felt she did not belong. When she did return to the Castle, she was soon pregnant once again, and this time she delivered a healthy boy, the Crown Prince Rudolph. Swiftly, with the birth of a son, the future Emperor, Sophie swept in and took over his care and education. Sisi had fulfilled her duty and had lost control of another child. She had given birth to the future monarch of the Habsburg Empire, an Empire that was swiftly diminishing in size due to misguided judgment and arrogance, leading to its defeat in war.During the not quite decade and a half that the book covers, from 1853 to 1867, the Empress met Count Andrassy, the beloved leader of Hungary. In her loneliness, she found him attractive, as he did her, and soon the two became smitten with each other, although they were often separated. Complicating matters further was the fact that Hungary was at odds with the Empire. The Hungarians wanted to detach themselves from Austrian rule and become a sovereign nation. When the differences were worked out, Elizabeth became the darling of the Hungarians. Since the Empress and the Count had a strong affinity for each other, tongues may have wagged about their relationship, including about her private efforts to achieve Hungarian independence from Austria. It was due to her work behind the scenes that war was avoided and Hungary remained a part of the Austrian Empire, albeit an independent part.\n\nIn 1853 Archduchess Sophie, the mother of Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria decided that he should be married to his nice, Duchess Helene in Bavaria, the older sister of Sisi. Emperor Franz Joseph defied his dominant mother for the first time in his life and choose Sisi over Helene. Sisi was 15 years old at time of their engagement, which was announced five days after they met! Eight months later they were married in Vienna and Sisi became Kaiserin Elisabeth of Austria.\n\nThis short happy period resulted in the birth of Archduchess Marie Valerie (22 April 1868). Sissi referred to her youngest daughter as the Hungarian child and had a solid relationship with her unlike with her other children.\n\nThe Habsburgs of central Europe, in this respect, were just one among many rulers. Where they differed from their counterparts was in the longevity of their presence in the political affairs of the continent roughly 600 years reason enough to warrant a brief, but closer look at their approach to speaking for and developing policy for their lands.Habsburgs were serene in their belief that they were unique among their peoples and never modified that conviction. Such exclusivity, however, did not exempt them from concern about the quality of their government and their reputations as legitimate rulers. Beginning with the latter decades of the fifteenth century, they slowly established an array of offices and advisory positions to manage their expanding imperium and advise them on how to do it. The most successful of their rulers were on constant watch for men qualified to help them formulate policy, at first chiefly for foreign, military, and fiscal affairs, later in larger domestic concerns such as education and economic development. They readily criticized other members of the house for behaviors that threatened to compromise the hiring of good councilors. In 1547, Emperor Ferdinand I defined such people as men who were not liars and whose only advice was what pleased their employers. He chided his eldest son, the future Emperor Maximilian II for drinking and frivolousness, lapses that could decrease the young man’s reputation and the likelihood that good councilors would work for him. Without such persons to serve them, all rulers would be lost. Princes themselves had to practice truthfulness and moral stability if they hoped to find people with the same qualities. The eighteenth-century Empress Maria Theresa, who combined political smarts with a visceral sense of Habsburg greatness, believed that finding better ministers than those of her father, Emperor Charles VI, was the key to a productive and worthy reign.Indeed, so concerned were the Habsburgs with retaining successful ministers, that they often gave their advisors and military commanders as much credit for accomplishments as themselves. They preferred to turn leadership of their armies over to others and sometimes were absent from notable victories of their forces. Ferdinand I was soliciting last minute out in his Austrian provinces when the Ottoman armies were turned back from Vienna in 1529. The city’s fortified walls, along with its citizen militia, got the credit for the job. The seventeenth century Emperor Leopold I, whose watch oversaw a European coalition that drove the army of the Turkish sultan from Vienna in 1683, was not in the city when the enemy retreated. He and his pregnant empress had left for safer quarters. Though public celebrations acclaimed Leopold at first, it was one of his generals, Prince Eugene of Savoy, whose name would be became most enduringly associated with the victorious anti-Ottoman campaigns in the Balkans. It was through the diplomacy of Prince Klemens von Metternich at the Congress of Vienna in 1815 that the Habsburg reconstituted itself again following the Napoleonic Wars and not the negotiating talents of his employer, Emperor Francis I. In the peace that followed, Francis did become more assertive in domestic affairs which he ran as a quasi-police state. Nevertheless, though he never quite forgave Metternich’s promotion of the marriage of the upstart adventurer Napoleon I to the Habsburg emperor’s daughter, Archduchess Marie Louise, he had the good sense to leave foreign affairs to Metternich.Conversely, it was when the Habsburg rulers identified themselves too prominently with the causes of their state that their regimes and their house itself got into trouble. The reign of Emperor Joseph II (1780–1790) is a sad case in point. His cautious mother, Empress Maria Theresa chided him again and again for his reckless self-confidence and contempt for those who did not have his intellectual gifts and imagination, but to no avail. Afire with ambition to make his empire more efficient while freeing his peoples from medieval impediments such as church- promoted superstition, urban guild restraints on trade, and serfdom, he set up a workplace in a corridor of the Vienna Hofburg where people from all walks of life could see him pursuing their well-being. But long established traditional institutions of his empire, chiefly the church and noble estates blocked him at every turn. Indeed, at his death, very few of his most important initiatives had taken hold. Worse yet parts of the Habsburg realms were in open revolt against him.Joseph’s most lasting achievement was the establishment of a government bureaucracy that appointed and promoted members on the basis of quality of service and level of education. Nevertheless, while generally free of corruption, it had become increasingly lethargic by the end of the nineteenth century. Joseph Redlich, one of the empire’s closest students, once said that the civil service ruled the monarchy, and not the emperor. While the situation was generally recognized, neither Franz Joseph nor his various ministers had the political will and imagination to remedy it. Archduke Franz Ferdinand, assassinated in Sarajevo on 28 June, railed against the cumbersomeness of the system and promised to reform it once he became emperor. That toes might be trod upon did not trouble him in the least.His conviction that decisive personal action was required to keep the monarchy viable had a willing champion in Archduke Charles, who succeeded Franz Joseph as the last Emperor of Austria and King of Hungary in 1916. He visibly chafed against routine and the formalities of the Habsburg court and regularly developed policies and tactics without systematic input from his ministers.Charles consistently and publicly presented himself as the leader of his lands, only to bring himself, his house, and his lands much grief. In the midst of World War I, he foolishly allowed Habsburg war propagandists to present him as a benevolent father of his peoples. His public was not persuaded. Real patriarchs provided food and fuel for their children, rather than redirecting it to an unpopular war in far-away places."
