        "text": "Ferdinand Karl Viktor (July 20 1821 – December 15 1849), was Archduke of Austria-Este and Duke of Modena.\n\nBorn in Modena, he was the second son of Francis IV of Modena and his wife Maria Beatrice of Savoy. His mother was heiress to the Duchy of Modena, because her father Ercole III d'Este had no sons.\n\nFerdinand married on december 4 1846 in the Schönbrunn Palace in Vienna with Archduchess Elisabeth Franziska of Austria, daughter of Archduke Josef Anton of Austria and his third wife Duchess Maria Dorothea of Württemberg.\n\nElisabeth and Ferdinand had one daughter, Maria Theresia of Austria-Este (1849–1919), who became the last Queen of Bavaria.\n\nFerdinand, who was a Field Marshal Lieutenant, died at Brno a few months later at the age of 28 from typhus. His widow remarried with Archduke Karl Ferdinand of Austria.\n\nFerdinand is the link in the Jacobite succession between his brother Francis I and his daughter Mary IV and III.\n\nAncestry\n\nahnentafel-compact5\n\nstyle=font-size: 90%; line-height: 110%;\n\nborder=1\n\nboxstyle=padding-top: 0; padding-bottom: 0;\n\nboxstyle_1=background-color: #fcc;\n\nboxstyle_2=background-color: #fb9;\n\nboxstyle_3=background-color: #ffc;\n\nboxstyle_4=background-color: #bfc;\n\nboxstyle_5=background-color: #9fe;\n\n1= 1.
