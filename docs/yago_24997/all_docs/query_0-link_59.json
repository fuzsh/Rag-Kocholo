        "text": "Archduchess Maria-Theresa of Austria-Este (Maria Theresa Henriette Dorothee; July 2, 1849 – February 3, 1919) was the last Queen of Bavaria. She was the daughter and only child of Archduke Ferdinand of Austria-Este and his wife, Archduchess Elisabeth of Austria, the daughter of Palatine Joseph of Hungary (1776–1847) and his third wife Maria Dorothea of Württemberg (1797–1855).\n\nArchduchess Maria-Theresa of Austria-Este\n\nHer father Archduke Ferdinand of Austria-Este was the second son of Francesco IV Duke of Modena and his niece-consort Maria-Beatrice of Savoy. His paternal grandmother had been heiress to the Duchy of Modena, because her father Ercole III d’Este had no sons.\n\nOn February 20, 1868 she married Prince Ludwig of Bavaria eldest son of Bavaria’s Prince Regent Luitpold, in the Augustinerkirche in Vienna. Ludwig III (Ludwig Luitpold Josef Maria Aloys Alfried; 1845-1921) was the last king of Bavaria, reigning from 1913 to 1918. He served as regent and de facto head of state from 1912 to 1913, ruling for his cousin, Otto.\n\nHe was the son of Prince Luitpold of Bavaria and of his wife, Archduchess Augusta of Austria (daughter of Grand Duke Leopold II of Tuscany). He was a descendant of both Louis XIV of France and William the Conqueror. Hailing from Florence, Augusta always spoke in Italian to her four children. Ludwig was named after his grandfather, King Ludwig I of Bavaria.\n\nThe couple had fallen in love during a visit of Ludwig at Pfingsten in Austria to attend the burial of Archduchess Mathilda and their decision to marry initially angered the Emperor Franz-Joseph, who had wished for her to marry Ferdinand IV, Grand Duke of Tuscany. The chief witness was Count Antonius Schaffgotsch.\n\nLeopold III, King of Bavaria\n\nThe family mostly lived on their farms at Leutstetten south of Munich, where Maria-Theresa cultivated rose gardens.\n\nMaria-Theresa became queen consort of Bavaria in 1913 when her husband the reigning Prince Regent proclaimed himself king as King Ludwig III in place of his living but insane cousin King Otto.\n\nShe became the first Catholic Queen in Bavaria since Bavaria was made a kingdom 1806. She spoke German, Hungarian, Czech, French, and Italian.\n\nIn 1914, she hosted festivities during the royal Bavarian jubilee. She appeared with her husband when war was announced. During World War I, she visited wounded soldiers and encouraged the women of Bavaria to support the troops by providing food and clothes, including with the donations references to legendary heroines.\n\nOn November 7, 1918 Ludwig III was forced to abdicate the Bavarian throne, and Maria-Theresa fled Munich with her family to Wildenwart Castle near Frasdorf, in order to escape from the Bolsheviks. The health of the Queen soon declined and she died there on February 3, 1919, being buried at the local chapel. On November 5, 1921 her remains were transferred to the cathedral of Munich along with those of her husband, who died less than a month before.\n\nThe Jacobite succession\n\nUpon the extinction of the Royal Stuart line with the death of Henry, Cardinal of York, and applying male-preference primogeniture unaltered by the Act of Settlement 1701, the succession would have passed to the individuals named in the table below. However, unlike the Stuart pretenders, none of them has claimed the British throne (or the thrones of England, Scotland or Ireland) or incorporated the arms of these countries in their coats-of-arms. Nevertheless, since the 19th century, there have been small groups advocating the restoration of the Jacobite succession to the throne.\n\nAs a granddaughter of Maria Beatrice of Savoy who was known as Queen Mary III-II to the Jacobite supporters and niece of Francesco V, Duke of Modena (King Francis I. to the Jacobites) she was recognised by the Jacobites as “Princess of England, Scotland, France, and Ireland”.\n\nSince Maria-Theresa was the niece and heir of the childless Francesco V, Duke of Modena who had been, at the time of his death, the Jacobite heir-general to the thrones of England, Scotland and Ireland; as such, she became the heir after his death in 1875. Neither she, nor any of her Jacobite forebears since 1807, ever seriously pursued this claim. To Jacobites Maria-Theresa was Queen Mary IV-III England, Scotland, France, and Ireland.\n\nMaria-Theresa was the first Jacobite heir-general since James Francis Edward Stuart (1688-1766) who could (but for her religion) also have claimed to be a natural-born citizen of Great Britain. While she was not born on British soil, as James had been, Maria-Theresa was a descendant of the Electress Sophia of Hanover.\n\nUnder the terms of the Sophia Naturalization Act 1705, the Electress Sophia and all “issue of her body” were declared to be natural-born British subjects, regardless of the actual place of their birth, unless they were Roman Catholics. The 1705 Act was not repealed until 1948 and, consequently, Maria-Theresa would have been covered by its provisions.\n\nFollowing her death in 1919, Maria-Theresa’s son Rupprecht, Crown Prince of Bavaria inherited the Jacobite claim. Like his mother, he and his descendants have not pursued a claim to the British thrones.\n\nLudwig III (Ludwig Luitpold Josef Maria Aloys Alfried; January 7, 1845 – October 18, 1921) was the last king of Bavaria, reigning from 1913 to 1918.\n\nLudwig was born in Munich, the eldest son of Prince Luitpold of Bavaria and his wife, Archduchess Augusta of Austria (daughter of Grand Duke Leopold II of Tuscany and Princess Maria Anna of Saxony). He was a descendant of both King Louis XIV of France and Navarre and King William I “the Conqueror” of England. King Ludwig III was named after his grandfather, King Ludwig I of Bavaria. Because his mother was raised in Florence, Archduchess Augusta always spoke in Italian to Leopold and his three siblings.\n\nLudwig III, King of Bavaria\n\nIn June 1867, Ludwig visited Vienna to attend the funeral of his cousin, Archduchess Mathilde of Austria (daughter of his father’s sister Princess Hildegarde of Bavaria, the seventh child and fourth daughter of Ludwig I of Bavaria and Therese of Saxe-Hildburghausen). While there, Ludwig met Mathilde’s eighteen-year-old step-cousin Maria Theresia, Archduchess of Austria-Este, the only daughter of the late Archduke Ferdinand Karl Viktor of Austria-Este (1821–1849) and of his wife Archduchess Elisabeth Franziska of Austria (1831–1903).\n\nMaria Theresia, Archduchess of Austria-Este\n\nThe couple had fallen in love during this visit and their decision to marry initially angered Emperor Franz Joseph of Austria-Hungry who had wished for her to marry Ferdinand IV, Grand Duke of Tuscany. Once permission to wed was obtained Ludwig married Maria Theresa on February 20, 1868, at St. Augustine’s Church in Vienna.\n\nMaria Theresia, Archduchess of Austria-Este\n\nThe couple shared common descent from Holy Roman Emperor Franz I and Empress Maria Theresa of Austria (daughter of Holy Roman Emperor Karl VI and Elisabeth Christine of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel). Leopold III and Maria Theresa had thirteen children. The family mostly lived on their farms at Leutstetten south of Munich, where Maria Theresa cultivated rose gardens.\n\nSuccession\n\nTo begin the story of how Ludwig became the King of Bavaria we must begin with the deposition and death of his kinsman, King Ludwig II of Bavaria. Ludwig II was heavily in debt due to his extravagant spending on the construction of two lavish palaces, Linderhof and Herrenchiemsee, along with the resplendent Neuschwanstein Castle.\n\nLudwig II, King of Bavaria\n\nLudwig was also a devoted patron of the composer Richard Wagner. Ludwig spent all his royal revenues (although not state funds as is commonly thought) on these projects, borrowed extensively, and defied all attempts by his ministers to restrain him. This extravagance was used against him to declare him insane, an accusation which has since come under scrutiny.\n\nFeeling harassed and irritated by his ministers, Ludwig considered dismissing the entire cabinet and replacing them with fresh faces. The cabinet decided to act first. Seeking a cause to depose Ludwig by constitutional means, the rebelling ministers decided on the rationale that he was mentally ill, and unable to rule. They asked Ludwig’s uncle, Prince Luitpold, to step into the royal vacancy once Ludwig was deposed. Luitpold agreed, on condition the conspirators produced reliable proof that the king was in fact helplessly insane.\n\nA team of doctors had Ludwig had and his only brother and successor, Prince Otto, declared insane, providing a convenient basis for the claim of hereditary insanity. At 4 a.m. on June 10, 1886, a government commission including Drs Holnstein and Gudden arrived at Neuschwanstein to deliver the document of deposition to the king formally and to place him in custody. That same day, the Government under Minister-President Johann von Lutz publicly proclaimed Luitpold as Prince Regent.\n\nOn the afternoon of June 23, 1886, Dr. Gudden accompanied Ludwig on a stroll in the grounds of Berg Castle. They were escorted by two attendants. The two men were last seen at about 6:30 PM; they were due back at 8 PM but never returned. After searches were made for more than two hours by the entire castle staff in a gale with heavy rain, at 10:30 PM that night, the bodies of both the King and von Gudden were found, head and shoulders above the shallow water near the shore. (I will be doing a blog entry on the mysterious death of Ludwig II in the near future).\n\nThe King was succeeded by his brother Otto, but since Otto was considered incapacitated by mental illness due to a diagnosis by Dr. Gudden, the king’s uncle Luitpold remained regent. Luitpold maintained the regency until his own death in 1912 at the age of 91. He was succeeded as regent by his eldest son, Ludwig.\n\nKing of Bavaria\n\nAlmost immediately after becoming Regent, certain elements in the press and other groups in society called for Ludwig to take the throne himself. The Bavarian Legislature was not, however, currently in session, and did not meet until September 29, 1913. On November 4, 1913, the Legislature amended the constitution of Bavaria to include a clause specifying that if a regency for reasons of incapacity had lasted for ten years with no prospect of the king ever being able to reign, the regent could proclaim the end of the regency and assume the crown himself, with such action to be ratified by the Legislature.\n\nThe amendment received broad party support in the Lower Chamber where it was carried by a vote of 122 in favour, and 27 against. In the Senate there were only six votes against the amendment. The next day, November 5, 1913, Ludwig proclaimed the end of the regency, deposed his cousin and proclaimed his own reign as Ludwig III. The Legislature duly ratified this action, and Ludwig took his oath on November 8.\n\nMore on Ludwig III of Bavaria this Thursday."
