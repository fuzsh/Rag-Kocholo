Austerlitz first pursued a commercial career, but in 1887 he turned to journalism, joining the staff of the Vienna Arbeitzeitung, then still a weekly. In the early 1890s he undertook social work for the employees’ union. In 1895 he was made editor of the political section of the Arbeitzeitung, which now became a daily newspaper, and in 1906 he was appointed its editor in chief. Austerlitz held his post for twenty-five years, during which period the paper gained the reputation of being the best organ of the Socialist Internationale.\n\nHis total devotion to his journalistic activities made him to refuse, time and again, to become a candidate for the Reichstag. Only in 1919 did he become a member of the National Constitutional Assembly of Austria. In 1920 he was elected to the National Assembly, where he took part in the drafting of the Austrian Press Law.\n\nAusterlitz consistently refrained from participation in all Jewish topics, particularly national Jewish problems. As a Marxist, he altogether opposed national tendency in Judaism, and his attitude in this regard definitely influenced that of the Austrian Social Democrats.\n\nHe is author of Wer ist Waahler (Vienna, 1897); Ein Militerurteil in Oesterreich (Vienna, 1901); Presse und Pressefreiheit (Vienna, 1902); Das neue Wahlerecht (Vienna, 1907).\n\notologist\n\nBorn and educated in Vienna, he graduated from the University of Vienna in 1900. During the following five years he did research in hospitals at Frankfurt am Main, Heidelberg and Freiburg, Germany. He returned to Vienna in 1905 and became privatdozent and assistant in the clinic of Politzer. By 1914 his research encompassed all aspects of the physiology and pathology of the inner ear. His greatest discovery was a method that enables the examination of each of the two labyrinths, separately, by using cold and hot water. He was also the first to describe a practical operative procedure for otosclerosis cases. Robert Barany discovered the connection between the functions of the labyrinth and cerebellum (little brain) that are essential for maintaining the balance of the body and in this way he also laid the basis for diagnosis of diseases of the little brain. Barany was the first to employ new methods of surgery to enable acoustic waves to reach the inner ear.\n\nDuring World War I, Dr. Barany served as a surgeon in the Austrian-Hungarian army. In 1915 he was taken prisoner of war on the Russian front, where he later found out that he had been awarded the Nobel Prize for Medicine in 1914. The Russians, on hearing about the prize, released Dr. Barany in 1916 in the course of a prisoner exchange.\n\nDr. Barany, being a Jew, was never made a full professor at the University of Vienna. However, in 1917, he was appointed professor of otology at the University of Upsala, Sweden. Barany’s scientific works concentrate on labyrinth-pathology and physiology. His major works include Der primaere Wundnaht bei Schussverletzungen des Gehirns, which appeared in the weekly magazine Wiener klinische Wochenschrift (1916,) and Die Radicaloperation des Ohres ohne Gehoergangplastik bei chronischen Mittel-phreiterungen (1923).\n\nOnly towards the end of his life, when the Nazis came to power, did Barany begin to show any interest in Judaism and Jewish questions. In his will he left his valuable library to the National Library in Jerusalem.\n\nOtto Bauer was a Socialist leader and the first foreign minister of the Austrian Republic (1918-1919). He was the son of an industrialist who joined the socialist movement. Together with others he founded the socialist monthly Der Kampf (1907), which became a forum of socialist ideas. As an intellectual he studied, and wrote about socialist problems, like nationality. He suggested a new definition for nation: “the totality of men united through a community of fate into a community of character”. Bauer advocated granting cultural autonomy to various national groups of people in the Austria-Hungary Empire (including the Jews who fullfilled a very important role in history but could not be a separate nation). His ideas about assimilation were unacceptable by the Zionist, who criticized him sharply. After WWI Bauer became foreign ministerof the new republic, but resigned after a year when his ideas of merger with Germany failed to materialize.\n\nAfter Dolfuss took power (1934), Bauer was instrumental in the struggle of the Viennese workers against the government, and after its collapse he fled to Czechoslovakia. In May 1938 he fled to Paris from where he published in the News Chronicle of London “an appeal to world conscience in rescueing three hundred Jews from the Germans in Austria”. Otto Bauer died on the very his appeal was published. He was an intensive writer and published different books on Socialist topics.\n\nSiegmund Baum was born in Vienna as Siegmund Teutelbaum in 1920. He changed his family name to Baum in 1946. From 1930 to 1938 he attended the Realgymnasium, but due to the implementation of the discriminating Nuerenberg laws in Austria, in 1938, he was unable to obtain the Matura. In July 1938, he emigrated to Italy, where he was denied permission either to study or to work.\n\nIn 1939 Baum immigrated to the USA, where he started working in a factory. During WW2 he served in the US Army, from 1942 to 1945. In 1947, Baum was admitted as Associate in Arts at Los Angeles City College. From 1946 to 1950 he also attended UCLA (University of California, Los Angeles.) earning his BA in physiology in 1949, and his MA in 1950. From 1950 to 1960 he was physiologist at the US Naval Radiological Defense Laboratory, San Francisco. Concurrently, from 1954 to 1959, he attended the University of California at Berkley, where he received his Ph.D. From 1960 to1962 he was group leader of physiologists and radiologists at Douglas Missile and Space Systems. From 1962 Baum was a member of staff at the Armed Forces Radiobiological Research Institute, Bethesda, Maryland. From 1962 to 1964 he was head of the cellular radiobiological division, from 1964 to 1947 chairman of the experimental pathological department, and from 1976 chairman of experimental hematology department.\n\nConcomitantly, he was professor at Uniformed Services at the University School of Medicine where he specialized in bio-medical productive research.\n\nBaum was a member of the American Physiological Society; Radiation Research Society; Transplantation Society; International Society of Experimental Hematology; and Sigma Xi. Siegmund Baum received the 1st Annual Scientists Award from the US Naval Radiobiological Defense Laboratory (1960); and the Exceptional Civilian Service Award from the Defense Nuclear Agency (1973). Baum contributed many articles to professional scientific publications.\n\nRichard Beer-Hoffman was born in Vienna, the son of Hermann Beer, a Jewish Moravian lawyer. His mother died while giving him birth. Later, his maternal uncle, Herman Hofmann, a Viennese industrialist, adopted him. In 1884, Beer added his foster-father’s family name to his own.\n\nAs a young man he served as a lieutenant in the Austro-Hungarian Army. Beer-Hofmann graduated as Doctor of Jurisprudence at the University of Vienna in 1890, but never practiced the legal profession. Occasionally he directed a few plays: in 1928 Goethe’s ‘Iphigenia’ at the Theater an der Josefstadt, Vienna, at the Salzburg Festival in 1930 and at Deutsche Theater, Berlin. In the same year he staged his own one-night version of Goethe’s ‘Faust’ I and II at the Burgtheater, Vienna.\n\nBeer-Hoffmann joined the Young Vienna literary circle. He and his friends: Arthur Schnitzler, Peter Altenberg, Felix Dormann, Felix Salten, Hugo von Hofmannstahl and other artists frequented the Cafe Grienstadl, where they discussed art, religion and politics. He was also on friendly terms with Theodor Herzl.\n\nBeer-Hofmann published his first short story in 1891. More significant was his novelette Das Kind (1893). His most famous lyric Schlaflied fuer Miriam, was written for his first-born daughter, Miriam. Beer-Hoffman disliked his colleagues’ egocentric, pleasure and fame-seeking motives and he sought after meaning in his Judaism. An example of his feelings is his only novel Der Tod Georgs, published in 1900. In the novel the hero, an Epicurean, decides to abandon his self-centered existence, discovers himself as a Jew, and joins his people’s struggle for justice. His first play Der Graf von Charlois (1904) and his poem Altern (1907) also reflect his emphasis on unity of tradition, which binds the individual to his ancestral past. His trilogy of plays: Jaakobs Traum (1918), Der Junge David (1918), and Vorspiel auf dem ‘Theater zu Konig David’ (1936), of which only a small part was ever completed, are based on biblical themes. In his plays Beer-Hofmann expounds his belief that the individual, and people in general, are important only to the extent that their welfare confers with that of humanity at large.\n\nBeer-Hofmann received: the Volks-Schillerpreis, Goethe Bund, Berlin (1905), and the Raimund Preis, Vienna (1921). In 1936 he visited the Palestine. He resumed his work on his trilogy when he returned to Vienna. In August 1939 he fled from the Nazi regime to Switzerland, where he lost his wife, Paula. In November 1939 he emigrated to the U.S.A., and lived in New York with his daughters and son in-law, Ernest Lens. Harvard, Yale, and Columbia Universities and Smith College invited him to join their faculty. His Verse (1941) contains all the poems that he wished preserved. In his posthumous fragment Paula (1949), a tribute to his wife, having also some autobiographical elements, reflects the autumnal mood of Austria, as it influenced his life and shaped his personality.\n\nAfter World War II, the Burgtheater of Vienna restored Jaakobs Traum to its repertoire. The American Academy of Arts and Letters conferred a distinguished award upon him. He also gained appreciation from Jewish institutions. Within Jewish circles he was considered as a symbol of Jewish dignity, for while still in Austria he placed a Shield of David over the entrance of his house, thus signifying to all that the Jewish fate was his fate. The Jewish National Fund issued a Beer-Hofmann memorial stamp. The Jewish Publication Society of America published an English translation of Jaakobs Traum. In Hebrew it has been played on stage by Habima in Moscow, Tel Aviv and New York.\n\nBeer-Hofmann died in New York in 1945.\n\nBorn in Kolomea, Galicia, then part of the Austrian-Hungarian Empire.

Charlotte Buehler, with her husband, Karl Buehler, succeeded in establishing a far reaching network of scientific communications based on behaviorism. While in Vienna, Charlotte focused her research on the cognitive and personality development of children from infancy through adolescence. The goal of this research was to create a unified theory of psychology development of childhood. The Institute was directed by Charlotte Buehler as a modern social, scientific research institution.\n\nIn 1924 Buhler received a grant from the Laura Spellman-Rockefeller Memorial Fund for a study visit to the United States of America. She spent some time at the Teachers College of Columbia University, New York and at the Clinic of Child Development at Yale University, New Haven.\n\nStudents of the faculty of psychology, under the guidance of Charlotte Buehler, conducted individual research and follow-up of infants and children’s’ behavior. At the famous ‘Wednesdays colloquy’, doctoral students and collaborators continuously reported on their ongoing investigations, upon which the research plans were decided. The results of the research on children’s psychology were published by her in Kindheit und Jugend (“Childhood and Youth”) in 1928.\n\nThe Institute of Psychology was also involved in the welfare policies of ‘Red Vienna’ by observing the behavior of small children at a Reception Center for Children, who had been put into public care.

She was a member of the the American Psychologists Association and the American Association for Humanistic Psychology serving as president from 1965 till 1966.\n\nCharlottes Buhler’s research and writings concentrated on study of the purpose of human existence. She stressed the concept of personal fulfillment and believed that humans could find personal fulfillment by fully using one’s potential, living constructively, setting goals and periodically assessing progress, and establishing a personal system of values.\n\nIn 1971 she returned to the Federal Republic of Germany, and settled in Stuttgart, where she worked in her private clinic, in order to spend the last years of her life with Rolf, her son.

Victor Conrad served as head of the department of cosmic physics at the University of Czernowitz (1910), Bukovina, until the World War I. In 1918 he returned to the University of Vienna, to the Institute of Meteorology, where he started a seismographic station for the observation of geophysical problems (earthquakes).

Eisenbach was born in Krakow, Poland where his father was a wealthy Jewish merchant. Like most Jews in Poland at that time, Yiddish, in addition to Polish, was an integral part of the language. This became valuable to Eisenbach when he expanded his theatrical career into the Yiddish theatre movement that grew rapidly in Vienna Eisenbach started in the theatrical world in Budapest as a clown and later incorporated his musical talents to become a comic singer. In 1894, he joined the Budapester Orpheumgesellschaft, a small theater group in the Jewish section of Vienna, founded in 1889 by Joseph Modl, the Ladies Württemberg and Kovats, Max Rott, Armin Springer, Hans Moser, Rolf Wagner and others. This group later became the Jewish cabaret of the city. Eisenbach at first performed short comic songs and danced duets with his wife, Anna. His theatrical talent became more dynamic and he performed every day in the Budapester. When he came on stage the audience, primarily “working class” Jews, greeted him with enthusiastic applause. He personified men who have an unbreakable and unbendable will to live. In his anecdotes, he turned the sad fate of his people into self-mocking, cynical jokes, using a jargon filled Yiddish which was called Jidien. None of this went well with the more educated bourgeoisie Jews of Vienna who looked upon Yiddish as a language of the lower class.\n\nPerformances at the Budapester usually started with a march followed by humorous songs and a one-act play written by one of the members of the group. The highlight of the evening came after the intermission with a one-person performance by Eisenbach or his close friend and colleague, Max Rott. Eisenbach’s excellent performance in Die Klabriaspartie, a one-act play by Adolf Bergmann, depicting the struggle of Jewish peddlers and beggars, brought him to the position of leading actor. Later he became the playwright and director of the Budapester. In 1907, Eisenbach founded his own company and performed in the Hotel Stephanie, but a year later moved back to the Budapester, where he continued acting, writing and directing.\n\nIn 1911, the writer, publisher Karl Kraus claimed that the real theatrical entertainment goes on in the Budapester and not in the prestigious Hofburgtheatre of Vienna.\n\nHeinrich Eisenbach died in Vienna in 1923.\n\nGeneral in the Austrian Army\n\nEmil von Sommer was born in Bukovina.

Feigl were based upon the use of reagent-impregnated filter papers, using for the first time catalytic and induced reactions which provided for the low concentrations of test materials needed for the specificity of agents. He developed the use of organic reagents for inorganic analysis and a new system of organic analysis. He also devised hundreds of tests for chemical identification.\n\nFeigl was a member of: Federation of Jewish Societies of Rio de Janeiro; Friends of Hebrew University (1946); the board of governors of the Hebrew University (1950); Conference of Jewish Federations of Brazil (1951); executive of W.J.C. (World Jewish Congress – 1951-1971); Chaim Weizmann Institute (1954); Zionist Organisation of Brazil of B’nai B’rith. He was honorary member of the British Society of Analytical Chemistry; Japan Society of Analytical Chemistry; Verein Osterreichischer, Chemiker; and of the Osterreichische Geselschaft fuer Mikrochemie (that confers a ‘Feigl Prize’ for outstanding work by young Austrian microchemists).\n\nF. Feigl received a Dr. honoris causa from the Technische Hochschule, Vienna (1947); the Emil Medal, Oesterreichische Geselschaft fuer Mikrochemie (1951); Weizmann Prize, City of Tel Aviv (1952); the title of honorary professor at the University of Brazil (1952); Exenar Medal N. Australian Trade Union Association (1957). In the same year he has been elected to the Brazil Academy of Science, and received the Einstein Medal (1957).\n\nFeigl publications include: Analitative Analyse mit Hilfe von Tupfelreakcionen (Leipzig, 1931; 4 editions, translated into Russian, French, and English, 1935-60); Spot Tests, published in two parts, Inorganic Applications, and Organic Applications (1937-72, 6 and 7 editions); Chemistry of Specific, Selective and Sensitive Reactions (New York, 1949); and pharmaceutical patents. Feigl authored over 350 publications.\n\nJosef Frank was born in Baden, near Vienna, Austria. In 1910 he received his diploma as an engineer at the Technologische Hochschule, in Vienna. He operated there as a freelance architect until the early 1930s. He often worked with architect Oskar Wlach, and occasionally with Oskar Strand, on buildings in Vienna and Pernitz, Lower Austria. Among his many projects he designed building interiors including the Museum of East Asian Art, Koeln, Germany (1912). From 1914 to 1925, he was professor at the School of Art and Crafts, Vienna. Frank also collaborated with the ‘Wiener Kreis’ group (Otto Neurath and others,) and Adolf Loos.\n\nIn 1925 he worked in partnership with Josef Hoffmann, Peter Behrons, Oskar Strand and Carl Witzmann on the Austrian pavilion at the International Exhibition of Art and Crafts, Paris. From 1924 to 1932 he built a number of municipal housing units, one family house, and other buildings in Vienna including the Karl-Marx-Hof (1930). Concurrently in 1925 he, with Oskar Wlach, founded the interior decoration store in Vienna Haus und Garten. Frank also designed furniture, wallpaper and other items for the home. He was a member of the O.W.B (Oesterreichisch Werkbund, and its vice President in 1929), and organized its 1927 exhibition in Vienna representing Austria at the International Werkbundsiedlung Weissenhof, Stuttgart, with a two-family house. In 1929 he founded the C.I.A.M. ‘Congres Internationaux d’Architecture Moderne,’ and participated in C.I.A.M. conventions. he edited the Internationale Werkbundsiedlung from 1932 to 1934. Frank was a member of the S.P.D. (Socialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands – the German Social Democrat).\n\nIn 1932, he started his first projects for the interior decoration store Svenskt Tenn, Stockholm, Sweden and iIn 1934 he immigrated to Sweden and settled in Stockholm where he worked as a designer at Svenskt Tenn leaving in 1941. He also received public and private commissions (embassies, banks, buildings and private homes) for furniture, decorative objects, wallpaper, textiles etc. His architectural works included Villa Wehtje Falsterbo (1936). In 1937 he participated in World’s Fair, Paris.\n\nJosef Frank moved to the U.S.A in 1941 where he was professor of architecture at the New York School for Research, New York through 1946. He lived temporarily in London, where he was a member of the architect’s organization ‘The Circle’ (in 1964 honorary member) and in 1952 returned to Stockholm.\n\nFrank received the Grand Prize of Austria in 1965 and an exhibition was sponsored by the Austrian Society for Architects. In 1968 a retrospective exhibition took place at the National Museum of Stockholm, entitled ‘Josef Frank 20 ar i Svenskt Tenn’, another large retrospective exhibition was held in his honor at the Austrian Museum for Applied Art in 1975.\n\nHead of the Vienna banking firm of Koenigswarter\n\nVon Koenigswarter was born into the wealthy Koenigswarter family involved in banking and philanthropy. The founder of the family was Jonas Hirsch Koenigswarter (d. 1805). He was born in Moravia and lived in Germany, where he opened a successful bank. His third son Moritz (1780-1829), went to Vienna where he established a bank. He also received special rights from the government and was active in Jewish life. He died at age of 49. Jonas Freiherr, his nephew, was the son of Marcus, founder of the Frankfurt branch of the family bank, and second son of Jonas Hirsch. He moved to Vienna, married his cousin Josephine (Moritz’s daughter), and succeeded his father in law and uncle’s bank. Jonas Freiherr established the Koenigswarter and Todasco bank and became head of the Austrian National Bank (1850). He helped the Rothschild family establish the largest Austrian bank, Creditanstalt (1855) and assisted them in building the railway system. Freiherr had many projects in the Jewish community and was elected president in 1868, a position he held until his death. He was ennobled by the emperor and promoted to the Upper House (1870).\n\nJonas Freiherr took on the name von Koenigswarter. The eldest of two sons was Moritz Baron von Koenigswarter (1837-1893). He was one of the most important figures in the financial world of Vienna during the second half of the 19th century. He continued expanding his father’s business including the railroad system. He was active in politics and was nominated as a liberal to the Austrian upper Legislative House. (1879). With his involvement in Jewish matters he represented the united Jewish community in negotiations to secure the community’s external relations by law in the upper legislative house. (1890). He founded different Jewish institutions, among them the aid for Jewish blind and the Theologische Lehranstalt.\n\nThe second son was Hermann Freiherr von Koenigswarter (d.1915). He converted to Christianity. With the wealth he inherited he maintained racing stables, and donated a million gulden to charity. This was due, primarily, to a clause in his father’s will which said that every male descendant of his who converts should donate a million gulden to charity.\n\nSigmund Freud was born on May 6, 1856, in Freiberg, Moravia (now Pribor, in the Czech Republic) as the third son of Jakob Freud, a Jewish wool merchant, and the first child of his second wife, Amalie Nathansohn. In 1859, the Freud family moved to Leipzig, in Germany, but a year after, they settled in Vienna, the city where Sigmund Freud was to live for the next 78 years.\n\nFreud graduated from the Sperl Gymnasium in 1873 and turned to medicine as a career studying at the University of Vienna. There he was in contact with Ernst von Brucke (1819-1892), a leading physiologist of his time. In 1882, Freud entered the General Hospital in Vienna as a clinical assistant and three years later was appointed lectur"
