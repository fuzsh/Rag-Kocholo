        "text": "Hm, well IMO I think we'd see Louis XVI move to strengthen French ties with the other Bourbon branches. OTL France had very few marriage ties with her fellow Bourbons, so it would definitely be in his best interest to do so. I can also see renewed ties with Bavaria (France's oldest German ally)\n\nFirst off, Madame Royale, as the only daughter of the King (hell the only female of the Royal family) is VERY unlikely to remain in France married to Angoulême (MA can through as bit a fit as she likes, it would be a waste of an alliance). The most likely candidates are Francesco I of the Two Sicilies (as the only crowned Bourbon close to her age)\n\nand possibly Emperor Franz II (as his second wife, if his remarriage can be pushed back); Archduke Karl of Teschen had no chance of inheriting the throne so little dice there, and Gustav IV was Protestant, a nonstarter.\n\nSecond, Louis XVII. As MT is likely to marry into Naples, the Dauphin is likely to have a Spanish bride, Infanta María Isabel as the closest in age. Otherwise, I can see a match to Princess Augusta of Bavaria (the OTL bride of Eugené de Beauharnais). The other traditional royal houses (the Wettins, and the Savoys) didn't have any princesses in his generation, so no dice there.\n\nThird, Angoulême. As the future Primier Prince du Sang (he was supposed to become First Prince of the Blood at Louis-Philippe II's death I believe), and third in line to the throne, he'd likely get a second tier bride, related to a reigning house but not of the reigning branch. Perhaps Duchess Maria Elisabeth Amalie Franziska in Bavaria (5 May 1784)? She was of the ducal Bavarian branch, and the niece of Elector Maximilian IV, so she'd be ranking enough. Or possibly Archduchess Maria Leopoldine of Austria-Este, the granddaughter of the reigning Duke of Modena and a niece of Marie Antoinette? Either should work.\n\nFourth, Berri. As the youngest petit fils de France, he has the worst prospects for a foreign bride. So maybe Adélaïde d'Orléans? She was never matched with anyone before the revolution, so Bourbon-Orléans marriage could help reconcile the two branches.\n\nFinally, Engien. I don't have any opinion or suggestions there, so a Badenese Princess is fine to me.\n\nFrance usually do not used its princesses in that way (as many were allowed to remain unmarried). Also existed already established engagements who made clear what were Louis XVI’s intentions: Madame Royale would marry Chartres (he is more likely than Angouleme for her), the Dauphin one of his cousins from Naples. Angouleme can marry Adelaide d’Orléans for her dowry or a foreign junior princess, leaving the match with Adelaide to Berry. About Enghien, looks to me who he was pretty decided to marry Charlotte de Rohan and while Condé‘ strongly opposed to that match, his motivation was Charlotte’s kinship to the infamous Cardinal de Rohan so if we can butterfly the scandal of the necklace, Conde is unlikely to oppose to the match...\n\nFrance usually do not used its princesses in that way (as many were allowed to remain unmarried).

The Rohan girl's aunt (I think) had been trying for a match with some Portuguese aristocrat at the time. Condé packed his grandson off on a tour in the hopes he'd \"forget her\" but Enghien didn't, instead he wrote her letters which he sent to her in secret. The Portuguese match fell through, and Condé begged Louis XVIII to refuse permission for it.\n\nFrom a convo with @Emperor Constantine\n\nThe two sources I found are this: https://en.calameo.com/read/005147390b46c445f9086 and this: https://books.google.com/books?id=6ys-AAAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=La+Princesse+Charlotte+de+Rohan+et+le+Duc+d'Enghien&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjM9bya1pvhAhUCi6wKHbkoDY4Q6AEILTAA#v=onepage&q&f=false\n\nAnd yeah I know that whether or not they were actually married is highly contentious, but for the sake of my TL the wedding will be accepted as something that happened due to .....events.\n\nWhat I can make out from the calameo book is that Charlotte met the prince de Condé at Worms in 1791, it seems in the company of her uncle. Thereafter she was attached to the retinue of the pious Louise de Condé, Abbess de Remiremont, and aunt of the duc d'Enghien. In 1793 Enghien obtains from the Cardinal de Rohan (of Diamond Necklace Affair fame) permission to establish an \"ambulance\"(?) at Ettersheim. This [Enghien's presence?] was a \"rainbow in a dark sky\" for Charlotte. In 1797 it seems as though the prince de Condé, Enghien's grandpa, forced Enghien to do the 1797 equivalent of a \"dear john\" letter to Charlotte, breaking off any contact they had. Enghien joins up with Louis XVIII's court at Blankenburg, then gets tempted to St. Petersburg and winds up in Volhynia. In 1799 he writes begging his father to allow him to wed Charlotte (so clearly the pair were in love).\n\nIn summer of 1799 she's in Hungary at an estate of her uncle, then in the winter she meets up with Enghien in Linz again - at a party thrown for his granddad by the Austrian nobility. Then something about a she [not sure if this is Charlotte, Enghien or Louise de Condé since they talk about a brother named Henri. It would seem funny if they suddenly started referring to the duc de Bourbon by his second name. And Charlotte had no brother called Henri] going to Venice for a benediction of sorts. Mention of the pope. Enghien at Grenoble (apparently) and then his mention of his Tirolean adventure.\n\nThen a return and \"simbiose\" at Gratz over the winter of 1800-1801.\n\nCharlotte goes back to Ettenheim, prepares it for the arrival of Enghien which happens in September 1801. Then it skips to after the cardinal de Rohan's death in 1803.\n\nHope this helps. Will look for more, do further translation when I get chance.\n\nPS: BTW, if would expect a pregnancy after being shacked up together for a winter in Austria\n\nThe first eighteen chapters of Sardent's book is devoted to the build-up to the events of the marriage. Little details like how Madame de Monaco was supposedly in favour of the marriage - she's described as playing mediator between Enghien and his grandpa on several occasions - or if not in favour (outright), not against the idea of it. An illness that Enghien suffered (by it's placement in the book I'd say at some point between 1797 and 1800) where Charlotte nursed him back to health. etc etc etc.\n\nThen 19 chapters in we finally get to the marriage itself. Now, Sardent states how these are formerly undiscovered notes.\n\nThis marriage is undeniable today, thanks to the discovery, in an old family home, among the heaps of paper covered with dust never lifted of notes left by Baron Roesch, one of the men who lived most in the intimacy of the Duke d'Enghien during the last years of his life, this he who will play such a beautiful role in this tragedy, started at the banks of the Rhine and completed in the shade sinister dungeon of Vincennes.\n\nAccording to these notes (1), the religious consecration was given to this exquisite love page, blooming pain of exile, by the former grand vicar general\n\nof Strasbourg, Father Weinborn. She had as witnesses: the Marquis de Thumery, the old brother-in-arms of the Prince de Condé, who became the guest and friend of his grandson, and Baron de Grûnstein, who had replaced by of the Duc d'Enghien M. de Cheffontaine, when the senatus-consultation of 1801 had forced the emigrants to return in France, on pain of being forever deprived of amnesty (2).\n\nWhen, kneeling next to each other, the hand in hand, Louis -Antoine -Henri de Bourbon and Charlotte de Rohan-Rochefort swore an eternal fidelity, they laughed did not see death hovering over of their secret nuptials, ready to fall on their happiness, like a bird of prey on the sweet nest trout in a ruined wall.\n\nDespite the constant apprehensions that tortured her for the last few weeks, the young woman did not think in what tragic occurrence, the Duke of Enghien would remove with his finger this ring of gold, symbol of the indissolubility of their love, which had just been blessed by old proscribed priest, and that, all pale and trembling of emotion, she gave him then, in the shadow of a little chapel, with no other witnesses than his father and two exiled soldiers.\n\nThis marriage, wrapped in so many mysteries, was blessed at the end of the year 1803.\n\n(1) We owe the communication of these notes to the kind kindness of Baron de Roesch 's great - grandchildren, Madame de Menil and M. Max de Marande\n\n(2) Baron de Grunstein was a major at Royal-Liégeois before the Revolution. In the army of Condé, he served first in the hussars of Salm; in 1798 he was incorporated into the dragons Enghien. Despite German knowledge, Grûn's family Stein appears to be French from the beginning of the sixteenth century. because she owned at that time in Poitou, as fief, the lordship of Chaillé, near Melle (Deux-Sèvres) [Intermédiaire des Chercheurs et des Curieux, 20 septembre 1904.]\n\nNow, I haven't checked on the identities of the witnesses, but the fact that they are essentially mentioned by name (or rather title), rather than simply just said that \"there were witnesses, okay! Trust me!\" could perhaps mean that Roesch's \"notes\" have legs.\n\nShe then goes on to say that it was the discovery of General Moreau's treachery that spurred Bonaparte to action.\n\nHe [Enghien] sends the story [of his marriage?] to the Duke of Bourbon, asking pardon for not having written to him of all the carnival \".\"You'll excuse me,\" he told him in that light tone he often with his very young father, when you know that hunting, dancing and eating took the three quarter and a half of my time. We must leave well the other half-quarter for love; you see that he does nothing remains empty.\n\n\"Lent brings abstinence from pleasure noisy; so there's still time for more pleasures secret and more solid; I take this opportunity to tell you about my tenderness... \"\n\nThese happy distractions do not make him lose seen his soldier dreams, and, again, he begs his parents to \"get it used to something in the during the year, \"saying,\" I do not live: I vegetate in the meantime... \"\n\nInterestingly, it describes that one of Enghien's hobbies at Etterheim was gardening.\n\nThe little castle inhabited by the Duke of Enghien at Ettenheim, true cottage in comparison to this wonderful Chantilly where the first years of his life, was touching a garden that he had who he worked for himself, helped by a few friends. \"He liked,\" says Count de Choulot, \"the culture of flowers; in the absence of rich draperies, he covered the walls and the vestibule of his house, which was so transformed into a delicious cradle of greenery \"» Under these\n\ncradles embalmed by clematis, goats leaves and roses, the prince does not regret the sumptuous paneling of the Palais-Bourbon and Chantilly, because they harbor this unspeakable happiness of two souls throbbing in unison, of two hearts living one for the other. Princess Charlotte shared this love of flowers, as she shared all the tastes of the Duke d'Enghien. When everything is veiled for a funeral crepe, she will have a memory for the gardener of Ettenheim\n\n\"Who cared for our flowers so well\""
