        "text": "Austrian Royalty: Archduchess Elizabeth Franziska (1892-1930)\n\nArchduchess Elisabeth Franziska was the royal couple's first child. She was born in Vienna (1892). Within the family she was known as 'Ella'. We note her in a portrait with her brother Franz wearing Austrian folk dress. We see Elizabeth and her sisters in identical dresses as well as a variety of costumes. We do not know how commonly the children dressed like this or for what occassions. She married Georg Graf von Waldburg zu Zeil und Hohenems (1878Â–1955) at Niederwallsee (1912). The marriage was by all accounts a romance and not for political reasons. Graf (Count) Von Waldburg had no money or property. They met because he had been employed to tutor her brothers. They had children. Elizabeth died very young (1930).\n\nHBRC\n\nNavigate the Boys' Historical Clothing Web Site royal pages:\n\n[Return to the Archduchess Marie Valerie'schildren page]\n\n[Return to the Archduchess Marie Valerie's page]\n\n[Austria] [Baden] [Bavaria] [Belgium] [France] [German states] [German Empire] [Italy]\n\n[Monaco] [Netherlands] [Norway] [Romania] [Russia] [Spain] [United Kingdom]\n\n[Main royal pages]\n\nCreated: 12:24 AM 7/23/2011\n\nLast updated: 12:24 AM 7/23/2011"
