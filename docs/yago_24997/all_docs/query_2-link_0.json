        "text": "Queen of Bavaria from 1913 to 1918\n\nFor other people named Maria Theresa of Austria, see Maria Theresa of Austria (disambiguation).\n\nMaria Theresa Henriette Dorothea of Austria-Este (also Marie Therese; 2 July 1849 – 3 February 1919) was the last Queen of Bavaria. She was the only child of Archduke Ferdinand Karl Viktor of Austria-Este and Archduchess Elisabeth Franziska of Austria.\n\nOn 20 February 1868, she married Prince Ludwig, eldest son of Bavaria's Prince Regent Luitpold, in the Augustinerkirche in Vienna. The couple had fallen in love during a visit of Ludwig to Austria to attend the burial of Archduchess Mathilda. Their decision to marry initially angered the Emperor, who had wished for her to marry Ferdinand IV, Grand Duke of Tuscany. The chief witness was Count Antonius Schaffgotsch.\n\nThe family mostly lived on their farms at Leutstetten south of Munich, where Maria Theresa cultivated rose gardens.\n\nMaria Theresa became queen consort of Bavaria in 1913 when her husband the ruling Prince Regent proclaimed himself king as Ludwig III in place of his living but insane cousin King Otto. She became the first Catholic queen in Bavaria since Bavaria was made a kingdom 1806. She spoke German, Hungarian, Czech, French, and Italian.\n\nIn 1914, she hosted festivities during the royal Bavarian jubilee. She appeared with her husband when war was announced. During World War I, she visited wounded soldiers and encouraged the women of Bavaria to support the troops by providing food and clothes, including with the donations references to legendary heroines.\n\nOn 7 November 1918, Ludwig III was forced to abdicate the Bavarian throne, and Maria Theresa fled Munich with her family to Wildenwart Castle near Frasdorf, in order to escape from the Bolsheviks. The health of the Queen soon declined and she died there on 3 February 1919, being buried at the local chapel. On 5 November 1921 her remains were transferred to the cathedral of Munich along with those of her husband, who died less than a month before.\n\nMaria Theresa was the niece and heir of the childless Francis V, Duke of Modena who had been, at the time of his death, the Jacobite heir-general to the thrones of England, Scotland and Ireland; as such, she became the heiress after his death in 1875. Neither she, nor any of her Jacobite forebears since 1807, ever seriously pursued this claim. Following her death in 1919, Maria Theresa's son Rupprecht, Crown Prince of Bavaria inherited the Jacobite claim. Like his mother, he and his descendants have not pursued a claim to the British thrones.\n\nOn 20 February 1868, at the Augustinian Church, Vienna, Maria Theresa married the future Ludwig III, last king of Bavaria.\n\nThe couple had thirteen children:\n\nRupprecht, Crown Prince of Bavaria (18 May 1869 – 2 August 1955).\n\nPrincess Adelgunde (17 October 1870 – 4 January 1958), married on 20 January 1915 to Prince Wilhelm of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen.\n\nPrincess Maria (6 July 1872 – 10 June 1954), married on 31 May 1897 to Prince Ferdinando Pius, Duke of Calabria.\n\nPrince Karl (1 April 1874 – 9 May 1927).\n\nPrince Franz (10 October 1875 – 25 January 1957), married on 8 July 1912 to Princess Isabella Antonie of Croÿ. Had issue.\n\nPrincess Mathilde (17 August 1877 – 6 August 1906), married on 1 May 1900 to Prince Ludwig of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha.\n\nPrince Wolfgang Maria Leopold (2 July 1879 – 31 January 1895).\n\nPrincess Hildegarde (5 March 1881 – 2 February 1948).\n\nPrincess Notburga (19 March 1883 – 24 March 1883).\n\nPrincess Wiltrud (10 November 1884 – 28 March 1975), married on 26 November 1924 to Wilhelm, Duke of Urach.\n\nPrincess Helmtrud (22 March 1886 – 23 June 1977).\n\nPrincess Dietlinde (2 January 1888 – 14 February 1889), lived 13 months.\n\nPrincess Gundelinde (26 August 1891 – 16 August 1983), married on 23 February 1919 to Johann Georg, Count von Preysing-Lichtenegg-Moos.\n\nKingdom of Bavaria : Grand Mistress of the Order of Saint Elizabeth and Order of Theresa (19 October 1872), the Order of Merit of the Bavarian Crown, the Cross of Merit for the Year 1870/71, the Cross of Merit for Voluntary Nursing\n\nSpain: Dame of the Order of Queen Maria Luisa\n\nAustrian Empire: Dame of the Order of the Starry Cross (10 January 1865) and Order of Elizabeth, 1st Class\n\nPrussia: Red Cross Medal, 1st Class (27 January 1899)[1]\n\nSchad, Martha.
