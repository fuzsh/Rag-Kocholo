Apparently negotiations for the proposed marriage went on for eighteen months. There were religious problems with Russia being Orthodox and Austria being Catholic, with Emperor Nicholas supposedly consenting to the marriage of his daughter embracing the Catholic religion.\n\nRegardless of these newspaper articles Archduke Stephen didn't get married, Grand Duchess Olga however on 13 July 1846 married Prince Karl of Württemberg (later King of Württemberg). 21.3 Archduchess Hermine Amalie of Austria (Hungarian Line) 1817 1842 21.4 Archduchess Franziska Marie Elisabeth of Austria (Hungarian Line) 1820 1820 21.5 Archduke Alexander of Austria (Hungarian Line) 1825 1837 21.6 Archduchess Elisabeth of Austria (Hungarian Line) 1831 1903 Archduke Ferdinand of Austria-Este (Modena Line) 1821 1849 See 47.53 -\n\nIt was reported that Ferdinand died of typhus (article is on page 4) which he caught whilst visiting sick and wounded in hospital.

Her parents were King Friedrich Augustus III of Saxony and his unconventional wife Archduchess Luisa Antoinette of Tuscany.\n\nLuise didn't follow the etiquette at the Saxony court which resulted in arguments with her father in law King Georg of Saxony.\n\nOn 9 (or possibly 11/12) December 1902 Luisa with the assistance of her brother Archduke Leopold left Saxony without her children but pregnant (with Anna Monika) to meet up with the teacher of her children, André Giron. She was divorced on 11 February 1903 and created Countess of Montignoso on 13 July 1903. Luise married the Musician Enrico Toselli in London on 25 September 1907.\n\nAnna Monika Pia was born on 4 May 1903 in Lindau, Bavaria and despite the efforts of the Court of Saxony who's representatives were present for the birth it was a number of years before her mother handed her over to her father.
