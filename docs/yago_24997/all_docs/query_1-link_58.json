        "text": "-FAMILY THEME-\n\nMarie Valerie Mathilde Amalie, called just Valerie by her family, the last child of the Imperial pair was born on 22 April, 1868 in Buda. Her birth was 10 months after the coronation. She was the first baby of a reigning monarch who was born in Buda after 328 years.\n\nShe was born in the Hungarian capital, because her mother wanted to give a present to her beloved Hungarians, and then she got a nickname like “The Hungarian Child”. She got it because the rude gossips about Sisi’ and Count Gyula Andrássy’s realationship told that the new Archduchess was the daughter of the Count. Of course, these rumors were not true.\n\nBecause her mother had a few milk, Valerie had a “milksister” in Gödöllő, called Lídia Juhász.\n\nAccording to Brigitte Hamann, if the baby have been a boy, than he would inherit the throne of Hungary, and the Monarchy would fall to two parts, because Rudolf have inherited Austria and the other lands, and the new boy Hungary. If that have happend, the new Archduke have named like Stephan, or István, the Hungarian form of the name.\n\nJust a few time after her births, her grandma, Archduchess Sophie wrote this in a letter to Valerie’s other grandmother, Duchess Ludovika: “Sisi is completely absorbed by her love and care for this irresistible little angel.”.\n\nShe was raised by her Imperial mother, and she was the Empress’s favourite child, and because of that she got the nickname “Die Einzige” (“The Only Child”). Sisi wanted to raise Valerie to be a Hungarian person, and she spoke with her daughter just in this language. Later Valerie disliked everything in connection with Hungary, and she felt herself as a German person.\n\nWith her mother, Valerie spent a lot of time in Gödöllő and she escorted Sisi to several journeys throughout Europe. She inherited the love of travelling from the Empress, but in other things she mostly resembled her father, Emperor Franz Joseph.\n\nValerie and her cousin, Duchess Amelie in Bavaria were lifelong friends.\n\nValerie was a talented painter and she also liked to write poems, just like Sisi. Plus she was keen on acting. Sometimes she took part in dramas, which was for her close family’s entertainment in Gödöllő, Hofburg or Wartholz. She was fluent in five languages.\n\nOn 31 July, 1890 in Bad Ischl Valerie got married to her love, Archduke Franz Salvator of Austria-Tuscany. The spouses loved each other (but later this changed a littlebit), and ten children were born from this marriage: Elisabeth Franziska, Franz Karl Salvator, Hubert Salvator, Hedwig, Theodor Salvator, Gertrud, Marie Elisabeth, Clemens Salvator, Mathilde and Agnes.\n\nAfter their wedding, the family lived in Schloss Lichtenegg, and in 1897, they moved to Schloss Wallsee.\n\nValerie was famous for her charitable lifestyle. She loved to lend a hand to people in need. For example she helped the casualties after the burning of Ringtheater in 1881. She established a hospital in their palace in Wallsee during WWI. Because of that she get the nickname “Angel of Wallsee”.After WWI she signed documents renouncing all rights for the throne of Austria-Hungary in her and the name of her descendants, so she could stay in Austria.\n\nAfter her last daughter’s birth her health became worse and worse. She died on 6 September, 1924 because of lymphoma in Schloss Wallsee, and was buried in Sindelburg.\n\nFrom the family of six (Franz Joseph, Sisi and the four children) just her sister, Gisela lived over her."
