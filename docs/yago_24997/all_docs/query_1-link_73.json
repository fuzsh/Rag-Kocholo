        "text": "She was called the “Hungarian child” and was her mother’s favorite. Yet she has remained fairly unknown. With this blog I introduce her to you: Marie Valerie …\n\nYouth\n\nArchduchess Marie Valerie, born on April 22, 1868, was the fourth and youngest child of Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria and Empress Elisabeth (Sisi). Grandmother Sophie had been very involved in the education of the first three children. This was not the case this time. Marie Valerie was born in Budapest, a year after the coronation of her parents. There were rumors that she was not the daughter of Frans Jozef, but of Count Gyula Andrássyde. Unfairly, especially when you see how much she resembled her father.\n\nMarie Valerie was Sisi’s favorite child. She spent a large part of her childhood with her mother in Hungary, giving her the nickname “the Hungarian child” in Austria. When she grew older, she increasingly distanced herself from everything that was Hungarian.\n\nWedding\n\nAs a daughter of the emperor, she received many marriage requests. Eventually Marie Valerie got to know Archduke Franz Salvator of Austria on a ball in 1886, and fell in love. People had hoped better for her, but she chose love. They became engaged in 1888 and the marriage took place on 31 July 1890 in the village church of Ischl.\n\nThe couple settled bought Schloss Wallsee, on the Danube, in 1895. After a thorough renovation, the family of Marie Valerie moved into the castle\n\nin 1897. Unfortunately, the marriage did not appear to be happy. Over the years, French Salvator increasingly had extramarital relationships, to the great sorrow of Marie Valerie.\n\nChildren\n\nMarie Valerie and FranzSalvator had ten children together:\n\nElisabeth Franziska (1892-1930)\n\nmarried Count Georg of Waldburg-Zeil-Trauchburg\n\nFranz Karl Salvator (1893-1918)\n\nHubert Salvator (1894-1971)\n\nmarried Princess Rosemary of Salm-Salm\n\nHedwig (1896-1970)\n\nmarried Count Bernard of Stolberg-Stolberg\n\nTheodor Salvator (1899-1978)\n\nmarried Countess Maria Theresa of Waldburg-Zeil-Trauchburg\n\nGertrud (1900-1962)\n\nmarried Count Georg of Waldburg-Zeil-Trauchburg, widower of her sister Elisabeth\n\nMaria Elisabeth (1901-1936)\n\ndied unmarried\n\nClemens Salvator (1904-1974)\n\nmarried Countess Elisabeth Rességuier de Miremont\n\nMathilde (1906-1991)\n\nmarried Ernst Hefel\n\nAgnes (1911, died after her birth)\n\nDramas\n\nIn 1889, Marie Valerie lost her brother Rudolf, who committed suicide in Mayerling and in 1898 her mother was murdered. In 1916 Frans Joseph finally died.\n\nIn 1924, lymphoma, a specific type of cancer, was found in her. The doctors could no longer help her and on 6 September of that year she died in Wallsee-Sindelburg. She was buried in a grave behind the main altar of the local parish church.\n\nREADING TIPS\n\nDo you want to read more about Marie Valerie and her mother?
