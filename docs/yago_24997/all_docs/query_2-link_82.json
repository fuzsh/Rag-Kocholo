        "text": "Let's unpack this (and try to ignore the Protestant matches)\n\nThis is the continuation of my thread, in this one we will be interested in the descendants of the Dauphin and Dauphine of France (in the period that covers the entire 19th century until 1900.)\n\nDauphin Louis Joseph of France (1781-1804) married Alexandra Pavlovna of Russia (1783-1866) on 30 March 1798.\n\nKing Louis XVII of France (1799-1889) married Princess Wilhelmine Marie of Denmark and Norway (1808-1888) on 1 November 1823.\n\nPrincess Marie-Zéphyrine of France ‘Madame Royale’ (b.1824) married King Otto of Greece (1815-1867) on 22 December 1836.\n\nNo. Madame Royale will marry Maximilian II, not Otto. Why Otto would want a French bride if he becomes king of Greece is beyond me to start with.\n\nStillborn girl\n\nStillborn girl\n\nMiscarriage\n\nPrincess Amalia of Greece (1849-1852)\n\nStillborn son\n\nDiadoque Ludwig of Greece (1854-1862)\n\nPrincess Maria Christina of Greece (b.1858) married King Alfonso XII of Spain (1857-1885) on 29 November 1879.\n\nAgain, no. Alfonso XII marrying an Orthodox princess is just...weird. Him having identikit kids to OTL is even weirder.\n\nPrincess Marie-Constance of France ´Madame Constance’ (1826-1900) married Prince August of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha (1818-1881) on 20 April 1843.\n\nWhat? Why? He's a landless second son of a second son. He's a wealthy Hungarian landowner at best, so more likely to get a minor archduchess than a French princess. In all likelihood, Victor Emanuele II of Savoy is a better match for her\n\nPrince Philipp of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha (b.1844) married Princess Louise of Belgium (b.1858) on 4 May 1875.\n\nUh, what? Who did Leopold of Coburg marry so that we could get OTL Louise? With the French succession standing as you have it, Nemours is likelier to get Belgium (if) it erupts in 1830 as OTL, being a lot further from the throne.\n\nPrincess Clotilde of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha (b.1846) married Archduke Joseph Karl of Austria (b.1833) on 12 May 1864.\n\nNope. Joseph wouldn't exist here. An analogue, sure, but not the OTL character. You know why? Joseph Karl's dad was Alexandra Pavlovna's husband. His marriage to her was only because she wouldn't convert to Catholicism (otherwise she'd have got the archduke of Teschen), which means the chances of him marrying the exact same second and third wives becomes laughably ASB. Especially since he married both for their resemblance to Alexandra IIRC.\n\nArchduchess Elisabeth of Austria (1865-66)\n\nArchduchess Maria Dorothea of Austria (b.1867) married Grand Duke Michael Mikhailovich of Russia (b.1861) on 26 February 1891.\n\nNope\n\nArchduchess Margarethe Klementine of Austria (b.1870) married Prince Albert of Thurn and Taxis (b.1867) on 15 July 1890.\n\nPrince Franz Joseph of Thurn and Taxis (b.1893)\n\nPrince Joseph Albert of Thurn and Taxis (1895)\n\nPrince Karl August of Thurn and Taxis (b.1898)\n\nArchduke Joseph August of Austria (b.1872) married Princess Auguste of Bavaria (b.1875) on 15 November 1893.\n\nArchduke Joseph Francis of Austria (b.1875)\n\nArchduchess Gisela Auguste of Austria (b.1897)\n\nArchduchess Sophie Klementine of Austria (b.1899)\n\nThe chances that Auguste of Bavaria is going to exist - or even that Sisi and her siblings (hence Albert and Auguste above) will exist is maddeningly small. Why? Because originally D. Miguel wanted to marry Ludovika of Bavaria (Sisi's mom), because her dad (Maximilian I) was desperate for her to marry his nephew, he withheld the news of the proposal from her until she'd agreed to marry Sisi's dad. The only reason she had to marry Sisi's dad was because her youngest sister died. This isn't even taking into the account the amount of butterfly herding for Sisi to still marry Franz Josef (when there's a far more impressive French princess available), still have her OTL kids and her OTL kids to make their OTL marriages.\n\nCzar Ferdinand I of Bulgaria (b.1861) married Princess Marie Louise of Bourbon-Parma (1870-1899) on 20 April 1893.\n\nAgain, Marie Louise wouldn't exist because in all likelihood her dad wouldn't exist, because his mom (Louise d'Artois) wouldn't exist, because the duc de Berri would likely never marry in this scenario.\n\nKing Louis XVIII of France (1829-1899) married Duchess Elisabeth in Bavaria (1837-1898) on 26 February 1856.\n\nSo, if Sisi is marrying Louis XVIII how do we still have Auguste of Bavaria?\n\nKing Louis XIX of France (b.1856) married Princess Beatrice of the United Kingdom (b.1857) on 22 July 1883.\n\nDauphin Charles Albert of France (b.1884)\n\nPrincess Eugénie Victoria of France ‘Madame Eugénie’ (b.1886)\n\nPrince Leopold Arthur of France ‘Duke of Anjou’ (b.1889)\n\nPrince Maurice Robert of France ‘Count of Provence’ (b.1891)\n\nOh wonderful, since Beatrice is a hemophilia carrier can we have a French Rasputin too? Also, her daughter will not be called Eugenie, since she only got that name in honour of the Empress Eugènie, who, would never marry Napoléon III here (that was all Maria Manuela Kirkpatrick - Eugènie's mom's scheming) and so never become friends with Victoria and so would never be invited to stand godmother to Beatrice's daughter. Of course, the argument could be made for naming her after Saint Eugene, but since Saint Eugene is (IIRC) usually invoked against childlessness and these kids seem to have reasonably short spacings between them, I don't see it.\n\nPrincess Adélaïde-Françoise of France ‘Madame Adélaïde’ (b.1860) married Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn (b.1850) on 13 March 1879.\n\nPrincess Margaret of Connaught (b.1882)\n\nPrince Arthur of Connaught (b.1883)\n\nPrincess Patricia of Connaught (b.1886)\n\nAnd Arthur can say buh-bye to his succession rights for marrying a Catholic\n\nPrince Philippe Hélie of France ‘Count of Artois’ (b.1870)\n\nStillborn son\n\nKing consort Louis-Antoine of France (b.1831) married Queen Isabella II of Spain (b.1830) 10 October 1846.\n\nInfanta Isabel of Spain (b.1851) married Prince Gaetan of the Two Sicilies (1846-1871) on 13 May 1868.\n\nKing Alfonso XII of Spain (1857-1885) (see above)\n\nInfanta María del Pilar of Spain (1861-1879)\n\nInfanta María de la Paz of Spain (b.1862) married Duke Friedrich Ferdinand of Schleswig-Holstein (b.1855) on 19 March 1885.\n\nWhy? Paz was married to her Bavarian cousins for a reason\n\nInfanta María Eulalia of Spain (b.1864) married Prince George, Duke of York (b.1865) on 6 July 1893.\n\nPrince Edward of York (b.1894)\n\nPrince Albert of York (b.1895)\n\nPrincess Mary of York (b.1897)\n\nPrince Henry of York (b.1900)\n\nAnd another British prince bites the dust since he's out of the British succession. Hope Eddy (aka Jack the Ripper) survived.\n\nMiscarriage\n\nMiscarriage\n\nPrincess Marie-Elisabeth of France ‘Madame Élisabeth’ (b.1839) married Archduke Karl Ludwig of Austria (1833-1896) on 21 October 1862.\n\nMadame Elisabeth will be marrying Franz Josef or marrying elsewhere. Not some third brother of his.\n\nMiscarriage\n\nStillborn girl\n\nPrincess Marie-Victoire of France ‘Madame Victoire’ (b.1849) married King Amadeo I of Spain (1845-1890) on 30 May 1867.\n\nAgain, Victoire will marry the heir, not the spare.\n\nPrincess Louise-Marie Thérèse of France (1804-1879) married King Oscar I of Sweden (1799-1859) on 19 June 1823.\n\nNope. A Bourbon marrying a Bernadotte? Maybe Gustaf IV's son but certainly not the son of one of France's own traitors (how Bernadotte was described at the Restauration court). And certainly not with her brother marrying a Danish princess. Again, it comes down to you simply giving these people their OTL kids without considering the names (Eugenie of Sweden, for instance, was named after Josephine de Leuchtenberg's dad, Eugene de Beauharnais, so here, she wouldn't have that name).\n\nScenario: Mary of Burgundy survives. I know I've done this one before but this is an updated version.\n\nMaximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor (b. 1459, d. 1521) m.
