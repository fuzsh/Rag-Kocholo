Mollösund - from the history of an old fishing village. by Lars Thornblad. Gothenburg School of Art and Design. 1971. 229 pp. Linen binding. 16.5 x 26cm. Printed in 1000 copies.. + Building in Bohuslän. by Finn Werne Sara Östnäs. 1983. 160 pages.

"Bohuslän occupies a unique position in Sweden and this is reflected in the buildings there and the way of building is markedly different from the rest of the country. Here we get a history and a picture of the development in the last 200 years, what is typical and how the building forms have arisen. A lot about building methods, from the foundation to the consequences of the lack of wood, various additions over time and the buildings needed to run traditional fishing".
