        "text": "Skerries, city or skiing in Sweden?\n\nExperience the unique Swedish skerries. Rent a canoe or kayak and paddle among the thousands of small islands with raw and naked rocks or the bigger, forest-clad islands that are easy to reach from the main land.\n\nIf you are looking for a bit more adventure then take a trip to Gothenburg with the amusement park Liseberg with fun for the entire family. Stockholm is the place to go, if you love a city with beautiful nature, lots of history, culture and beautiful, world class design. If you are looking for an active winter holiday in Sweden you will find both cross-country and alpine skiing in the Swedish mountains.\n\nHoliday home in the Swedish nature\n\nAll of our holiday homes in Sweden are surrounded by the scenic Swedish nature. DanCenter has numerous options across Sweden from Skåne, Småland, near Stockholm and in the Swedish skerries north of Gothenburg. Sweden is a country full of oppositions and therefore also full of opportunities for a holiday suited just right for you and your family.\n\nDo you want to experience Sweden through the eyes of the children's author Astrid Lindgren? We can offer you the classic Swedish holiday home experience. Book an authentic, cosy, small, red wooden cabin on the edges of a pine forest along a beautiful lake in open country side. Your holiday in a traditional cabin in Sweden can help you reduce stress and forget all your troubles.\n\nGo on a luxury holiday in Sweden\n\nAs a contrast to the idyllic cabin in Sweden you can also book a lovely, big holiday home. DanCenter offers different luxury holiday homes with room for the entire family. In Sweden we have big holiday homes fitting the entire family or groups up to 20 people. These include houses with swimming pool and whirlpool that you can enjoy both during summer or winter. Take a dip and cool off with your family on holiday in Sweden and the sun shines from a clear sky. You can also enjoy the warm water and a glass of champagne in the outdoor whirlpool on a cold winter's night. Or during the autumn break when the children splash in the pool and you enjoy the beautiful views of the colourful leaves falling from the trees.\n\nSweden is water, water and water\n\nSweden has been admitted to UNESCO's list of world heritage for its unique coastline. Middle and north of Sweden have countless rivers, lakes and streams criss-crossing the country. Sometimes you get the feeling that the country is swimming with only forests and fields acting as links between rivers and lakes. This is particular noticeable for the middle part of Sweden where the ice age left plain tracks. Thousands of lakes fill the gorges created when the ice retracted to the North.\n\nAt the exact place where the river Mälaren with fresh water meets the salt water from the Baltic you will find Stockholm spread across 14 islands and islets. But there is more: The Stockholm skerries just a few minutes sailing from the capital is comprised by a total of 24.000 islands and islets.\n\nThe Siljan lake is located in the middle part of Sweden called Dalarna. The lake and the surrounding towns are regarded as the historical centre of the country. From here, Sweden gradually becomes more raw and deserted. In Norrland, the only sound you hear in the enormous forests is from the roaring rivers.\n\nFor centuries, the rivers have been used for transporting logs to the coast. And where the rivers flow into the ocean is where the first settlements were founded several thousands of years ago. Höga Kusten in the north-eastern Sweden is permitted on UNESCO's list of world heritage for its unique coastline.\n\nSweden is a hit with the active family\n\nSweden has countless activities for children, young people and old people. It all starts when you book a holiday home or a cottage in Sweden, so the entire family has a god basis. Afterwards you have lots of room for social intercourse, fun and games as well as instructive activities for the entire family. The Swedish mountains provide plenty of opportunities for skiing during the winter. Sweden has lots of family-minded ski resorts. If you have booked a holiday home near the cities Stockholm, Malmø and Gothenburg, you will find plenty of activities. Bring your family to the zoos, amusement parks, museums and more.\n\nExperience Sweden's mighty forests\n\nSweden has beautiful forests from north to south. To the south, in Skåne and Småland, where DanCenter can offer you a big selection of holiday homes and cabins, you will find the hardwood forests. This area is also known for its moose-safaris, a unique nature experience. Such an experience is a guarantee for talks when you return to the holiday home or cabin. Småland is also perfect for bike rides, horseback riding, canoeing and fishing.\n\nIf you have booked a holiday home in the middle or northern part of Sweden, you will find the landscape dominated by deep valleys, plateaus and vast fir and pine forests. Here you can bring your family berry and mushroom picking, enjoying the beautiful flowers in the spring or the may different colours of the leaves in the autumn. Take a refreshing dip in the forest lake and catch a fish for dinner. While the children play in these beautiful settings, mum and dad can prepare the freshly-caught fish in the open-concept kitchen and the grandparents can relax with a glass of wine on the sofa. If you have plans of going to Sweden, book a holiday home with DanCenter Holiday Rentals.\n\nMidsummer in Sweden\n\nThe midsummer party in Sweden is truly unique. To many it is a symbol of the lightness, the light and the life force symbolic of the Nordic summer. Midsummer in Sweden is the biggest celebration of solstice in Scandinavia.\n\nWhen the most Swedish of Swedish parties approach, the whole country is exited. Midsummer is traditionally a feast celebrated with family and friends, but if you are a tourist you are welcome to join the festivities. It is celebrated all over the country - by the coast, in the skerries, by idyllic lakes, in the mountains or one of the islands. All is good, as long as there is plenty of pristine and diverse nature around."
