I think this is my seventh visit to this part of Sweden, quite remarkable as I hardly ever revisit a place! I often squeeze in some all-time favourites during these visits, but I also try to discover new places.\n\nFor now this page will be a sort of photo collage, but hopefully some day soon I will have some time to write a bit more in depth about my visit to Mollösund."
