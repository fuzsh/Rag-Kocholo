        "text": "ABOUT US\n\nWe are the Franklin family, consisting of Åsa, Rickard, and our two children Elvira and Harry. We usually live in Gothenburg but love to spend our free time on the beautiful Swedish west coast. Over the years, Mollösund has become our watering hole where we recharge with energy, joy, and wonderful memories.\n\nIn the spring of 2021, we had the opportunity to buy our own house in Tången. The idea is to use the house ourselves as much as we can, but to supplement our household budget, we will also rent it out when we are not using it.\n\nFor inspiration: A short vacation film from our summer in Mollösund 2023 can be found HERE\n\nABOUT MOLLÖSUND\n\nMollösund is located on the southwest tip of Orust and was first settled in the 16th century. Fishing for lingcod and herring was the main livelihood for the residents for several centuries. The old community is well-preserved, and taking a stroll along the ”street” feels like a journey back in time. Nowadays, the community is primarily a vacation destination with only about a hundred year-round residents. Down in the harbor area, you’ll find restaurants such as Brygghuset, Movitz Magasin, Sillfabriken, Kvarnen, Gatuköket, and the inn Wärds. There is also a football field, mini-golf course, tennis court, outdoor gym, two paddle courts, and a playground. ”Morgans Fisk” sells the best ”havets wallenbergare” (seafood burgers) and high-quality fish and seafood on the west coast. For updated information, you can check the Facebook group ”Det händer på Mollösund” (What’s happening in Mollösund).\n\nABOUT TÅNGEN\n\nTången is situated a couple of hundred meters east of Mollösund’s old community towards the island of Lyr. The area was built about 17 years ago and is primarily inhabited by summer guests. Tången is constructed in a uniform style with white classical wooden houses of various types.\n\nThe area also has its own harbor facility where there is high activity during the peak summer months, with swimming, water skiing, and boat activities. There is also a private beach and a communal facility with a large wooden deck for sunbathing. In the vicinity, you’ll find a football field, a boules court, and a playground. Parking is, of course, free.\n\nABOUT ORUST\n\nOrust is Sweden’s third-largest island (fourth if you count Södertörn, which West Coast residents, of course, do not). Over the years, Orust has become known for its shipyards that primarily manufacture leisure boats of renowned Orust quality. Many shipyards are still active.\n\nOn and around Orust, there are plenty of destinations worth visiting. The nearest community is Hälleviksstrand, which has the restaurants Strana and Erwings Junkfood. 15 minutes away by car is Tuvesvik, where ferries go to Gullholmen and Käringön. Peterson’s restaurant on Käringön offers top-class gastronomy. Our favorite restaurant, Bryggvingen, is located on the island Lyr, accessible by car ferry.\n\nIn the middle of the island is Orust’s own low fare shopping paradise Göksäter. In addition to Sweden’s cheapest shrimp sandwiches, you can find bargains of all kinds. There are also numerous hiking trails on the island.\n\nABOUT BOHUSLÄN\n\nBouhuslän is Sweden´s westernmost province, stretching from Gothenburg in the south to the Norwegian border. Bohuslän boasts a fantastic archipelago with thousands of beautiful islands to visit. The communities along the coast are small to medium-sized, each offering something beautiful.\n\nThe ice age has left its mark on the Bohuslän red granite, shaping the rocks into beautiful smooth formations. You will not find this kind of nature anywhere else on the planet.\n\nThe name Bohuslän comes from Bohus fortress, located in Kungälv. During the middle ages, this marked the border between Sweden, Norway, and Denmark. Historically, Bohuslän has belonged to all three nations during diffrent periods.\n\nMollösund is located perfectly in the middle of Bohuslän (orange dot). It is a great starting point if you want to experience the Swedish West Coast. Gothenburg is an hour and 15 minutes drive away if you want to experience city pulse,\n\nBATHING SPOTS IN MOLLÖSUND\n\nKattevik is located north of the guest harbor and is the largest bathing spot in Mollösund. Here, you’ll find a diving tower, a trampoline, and piers suitable for all ages. Swimming lessons are available during peak summer weeks (check the Facebook group for details).\n\nTornevik is situated in the southern part of Mollösund (Sörlejet) and is slightly smaller. There are a couple of piers with ladders and a shallow area for the youngest children.\n\nThe Lighthouse is located in the strait and requires swimming ability. Here, there is a trampoline and a ladder, but otherwise, it’s cliffs that are offered. This spot provides a front-row seat to the E6 along the West Coast."
