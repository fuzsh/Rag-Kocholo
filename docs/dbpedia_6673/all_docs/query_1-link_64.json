        "text": "Specific conditions:\n\nScan is, if nothing else is mentioned in the description, of the actual item, so please look for condition.\n\nIf you have any questions, or if you would like to see a missing scan of the back, please ask me.\n\nSince Delcampe charges me a fee of 0.29€ + more than 8% of the total for each sold item, the prices will be relatively high for cheap items, but if you are interested in many cheaper items, you can ask me if I have the time to make an auction with selected catalogue numbers for you.\n\nI can maybe also sell cards listed as sets, as single cards, please ask if interested.\n\nPostage is extremely expensive from Denmark, so I gladly wait for other items, and combine shipping.\n\nI send an invoice when I think you are finished buying, but please ask for an invoice, when you are finished buying.\n\nNB : I am sorry, but there is a slight possibility of mistakes regarding the listings. I do my best, but I have experienced double listings ( probably my fault ), sorry.\n\nWhen I list items at auction, I normally scan both sides, and I try to notice if the item has some faults, and describe it in the description. I do what I can to put what I think is fair prices on the items, and if they have faults or wear, price them accordingly, but I also make mistakes, and if there are any items you are not satisfied with, you can return them and I will refund you. If it is because of faults that can be seen on the scans, or is described, you must pay the return postage, but if it is my mistake, I will also refund your postage.\n\nThe above mentioned, regarding the importance of looking at the scans is especially important with the coins, where I am not that experienced in grading these."
