Known for “No Motor Cars”, only motor vehicle on this island is an ambulance…Rest of the vehicles are either bicycles or mopeds fitted with side carts. Known for unique architecture..each house is stunning!A ring road encircles the entire island, the central road leads to the Church. Has many camping sites, popular with Goteborg`s youth for overnight stays. Life for most youth of the island revolves around fishing activity, mostly for export."
