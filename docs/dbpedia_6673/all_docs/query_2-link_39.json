        "text": "In summer, Swedes from around the country descend upon the islands to stay in their cottages for the season. There is delicious fresh seafood, boat rides, good walks and people making the most of these long summer days.\n\nOn the island of Orust lies the pretty little village of Mollösund, one of the oldest fishing villages in Sweden. It is brimming with sweet summer houses and sailboats. We rented an adorable little cottage covered in roses with delicious strawberries growing in the garden.\n\nThe lovely island of Tjörn is comprised of wooded hills, nature reserves fishing villages and a dreamy rugged coastline. This is a great place to visit for nature and art enthusiasts.\n\nAt the Pilane Sculpture Park on Tjörn, sheep graze alongside the interesting and unusual works of sculpture as you follow the path among the rolling green hills. It is quite fascinating and a bit surreal to view these contemporary sculptures as they sit in juxtaposition upon an ancient settlement where you can still see stones and gravesites from 2000 years ago! The gigantic white head of a woman, titled Anna, by Spanish artist Jaume Plensa, sits at the highest point of the park and can be seen from miles around.\n\nMy daughter and I loved touring the Nordic Watercolor Museum, located in the very pretty fishing village of Skärhamn. It contains an interesting collection of contemporary watercolor paintings, as well as rotating exhibits.\n\nHamburgö is a tiny island accessible by what seems to be the shortest ferry ride on the planet and spent a night but wish we’d stayed longer… what a sweet place to relax, ride bikes and just enjoy. We stayed at the most darling little place, one of a few cottages built by a couple from Stockholm… Magnus, a photographer and Nina, a costume designer. Nina is truly an artist as she pieces together bits of cloth, both new and vintage, to make all the bedding, curtains and decor. Simple, peaceful and CHARMING! Book here."
