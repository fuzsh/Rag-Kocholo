Living in the United States for a year as an exchange student, while in high school, was an experience of a lifetime that created many fond memories and lifelong friendships.

Let me take you on a nice walk through the historical village centre of the isle of Marstrand with its mysterious Fortress Carlsten. Founded in the 13th century, Marstrand has become the most popular sailing resort of Sweden during the summer months. Nature freak, coast local or self-confessed city dweller, I’ll be pleased to discover with you by foot the charming old town of Gothenburg and the hidden secrets of Sweden’s second largest city as much as by bus the interesting Greater Gothenburg. My mother tongue is Swiss German, but I can guide on different places in different languages.
