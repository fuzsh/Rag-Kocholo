        "text": "If Anita went to the Gotland island this summer, I would like to take your attention back to a nice town on the west coast (which Anita went earlier in the spring). I ship the west coast as a summer destination. Last year, I went to Mollösund, located in the Västra Götaland County. This summer, I accidentally went to another town in Västra Götaland County, which was known as a lively summer town in Sweden, Smögen.\n\nmore\n\nBy accidentally, I mean a spontaneous trip. I was planning to dwell on my thesis from last week until the whole of July, but then my new friend from Bali came and invited me for this trip. As you can guess already, I took the chances. These chance of smelling the sea, listening to the seagull while sunbathing, and watching the sunset on the coast – had I not joined her on this trip, I would not be able to have such a good spirit in the start of writing my master thesis. Well, I did some writing already but it was not…done. Enough about the thesis, that is going to be for another post, right now I want to share the pictures that I took on the trip.\n\nSince this trip is not planned in advance, we got a little trouble during the search for accommodation. There are variations of accommodation from hotel, bed & breakfast type, and Airbnb. The funny thing was, we thought that we already booked a hotel the night before but on the bus ride from Torp terminal to Hallinden, I realized that the hotel was 35 km from the town and we did not have our own car. So, during 30 minutes of waiting for the next bus to Smögen, we looked through many websites for booking a hotel and everything was booked. It made sense because we went there on the weekend in the summer.\n\nGladly, we were able to book the last available Airbnb place in Smögen. I like how it was cosy and the Swedish touch was very strong in the interior, however, there was a downside which was the lack of shower. Please do not tell my mom but I did not take a shower for two days at that time. There is a public shower in the town but it takes more effort, and I am not a devoted shower-taker (sorry, mom). Even though I only spent a night at this town, it was splendid.\n\nWhen I saw the lights that fell on the rocks and how it created a blush of pink in the air, it worths the long trip with the bus. The flower picture above and all the pictures below have no filter. It breathes new life into me – no kidding. However, do not ask me to choose between Mollösund or Smögen because I will choose both. You cannot make me choose, period.\n\nIf you have the chance to spend summer in Sweden, take it – embrace it. Go to the west coast, where the sea and the good life will greet you. 13/10 I will go to Smögen again."
