Known as Bohus granite, the rock ranges in color from earthy brown to dusky grey, though the rock bears a distinctly pink hue. At sunset, the combination of the golden yellow of the sky, the aquamarine of the sea, and the pink of the granite is a Bohuslän and West Sweden classic. Bohuslän is also known for its succulent seafood. Mussels, oysters, lobsters, langoustines, crabs and prawns all thrive in the deep, cold and exceptionally clear waters off the Bohuslän coast. The colds waters cause the crustaceans to grow more slowly, which produces an exceptional taste.\n\n​\n\nWe have spent a few weeks hiking across the entire Bohuslän coast from Gotenburg in south to Strömstad in north along Marstand, Åstol, Klädesholmen, Tjörn, Orust, Käringön, Gullholmen, Fiskebäckskil, Lysekil, Smögen, Väderöarna, Fjällbacka, Tanumshede, and Kosteröarna. The summer months from June to August are always the best time to visit with long, sunny days and white nights, but our trip took place in October where the weather is not always playing along. This however was not too bad for nature and outdoor-gear enthusiasts.\n\n​\n\nSelected pics:\n\n​"
