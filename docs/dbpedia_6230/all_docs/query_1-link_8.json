        "text": "header2 Key Developments in 2019\n\nLocal elections and elections to the European Parliament were held in March and May, respectively. In both polls, opposition parties—the Homeland Union–Lithuanian Christian Democrats (TS–LKD) and the Lithuanian Social Democratic Party (LSDP)—outperformed the governing Farmers and Greens Union (LVŽS). In the capital and other major cities, most voters supported nonpartisan mayoral candidates.\n\nGitanas Nausėda, a centrist nonpartisan candidate who ran on calls for an inclusive welfare state, won May’s presidential election. The year’s polls were all considered free and fair.\n\nAfter the presidential election, the LVŽS initiated negotiations to expand its shrinking coalition with the Lithuanian Social Democratic Labor Party (LSDLP). Eventually, in June, two other parties—Order and Justice (TT) and the Lithuanian Poles Electoral Action (LLRA)—joined the coalition, with a final agreement signed in July. That month, Saulius Skvernelis was reappointed as prime minister. The parliamentary majority, however, remained shaky due to internal disputes and splits.\n\nIn February, 26 people were detained and charged with bribery and abuse of public duties. Among them were eight senior judges, including a member of the Supreme Court, and five lawyers. While the judicial process is ongoing, five of the eight judges were dismissed."
