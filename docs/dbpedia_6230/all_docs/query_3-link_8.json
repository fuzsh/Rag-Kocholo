        "text": "In a world where travel often means checking off the same iconic landmarks, there’s a hidden luxury in slowing down and immersing yourself in the authentic rhythm of a city.

Check out the article in the comments 👇 Photo courtesy Martynas Plepys.\n\nDid you know that Kaunas is not just a beautiful city but also a favorite shooting location for filmmakers? The latest addition to its impressive filmography is the American mini-series Truth and Conviction. 📽️✨ Set in the turbulent times of WWII, this four-part series tells the gripping story of a young resistance fighter against Hitler and the Gestapo agent on his trail. Directed and written by Matt Whitaker, the series highlights the moral complexities of their struggle. Kaunas's authentic interwar architecture provided the perfect backdrop for this historical drama. Locations like the Lithuanian Bank palace, the Nemunas river embankment, and the Ninth Fort of Kaunas Fortress brought the 20th-century story to life. Stay tuned for more behind-the-scenes insights and immerse yourself in the cinematic charm of Kaunas! 👉 Read more about the filming and discover why Kaunas is a top choice for filmmakers in the comments below!

Ed Sheeran's two concerts not only brought incredible music and joy but also delivered significant benefits to our city. They offered a wonderful chance for the people of Kaunas to enjoy their favourite spots and have a great night out, while many visitors from abroad discovered the city’s unique charms. While our neighbours in Latvia, Estonia, and Poland already know Kaunas is a fantastic city break destination, we’re confident that those who came to Kaunas driven by their love of music will return to explore it further. A big thank you to Ed Sheeran for the unforgettable performances, to the entire crew and organisers who made it all possible, and to everyone who visited the concerts! Looking forward to more musical feasts in Kaunas! 🎶✨ Photo courtesy Rokas Snarskis and Darius and Girėnas Stadium.\n\nKAUNAS IN TOURISM Kaunas as a Sense. Slow Tourism Ideas The more advanced travellers have long stopped measuring their achievements by the number of tourist attractions visited. Kilometres walked or cycled, hours spent learning traditional crafts, local culinary experiences, appreciation of art, and the search for the spirit of a place are some of the components of the slow tourism movement. This movement (a state of mind, really) can be followed anywhere in the world—in Kaunas, too! Are you ready for a conscious journey that will help you discover new sensations? Read full article in the comments.

Of course, your agenda is to see Ed Sheeran in the Darius and Girėnas Stadium, but we have put together a few other things to make the weekend truly memorable. Read the full article in the comments.

For some, meeting your date at the fountain on Laisvės Alėja is essential, or visiting a Žalgiris game. Others consider it vital to eat a doughnut at Spurginė, get lost in Oak Grove and see a tiger at the Lithuanian Zoo. We’ve compiled a list of must-dos in Kaunas – how many of these can you squeeze into one long weekend? Read the full article in the comments.

So, instead of a casual meetup, we’re throwing a community party just for you! Bring your entire team and fellow co-founders. We love first-timers and will make sure everyone feels included! 🎉 This time, there are no speakers (unless they’re really, really fun!). Just pure, unfiltered community fun on an open-air terrace, and plenty of networking! Let's celebrate all the hard work and innovation that make our community so special.\n\nKAUNAS IN Praėjusį penktadienį Kauno turizmo informacijos centre įvyko naujojo Kaunas IN įvaizdžio pristatymas, kurio metu dienos šviesą išvydo ir naujasis logotipas bei komunikacijos kryptis. „Save kuriantis miestas“ (ang. Self-made city) – taip galime ir norime kalbėti apie Kauną – miestą, kuriame bendros pastangos, drąsa ir ambicijos virsta apčiuopiamais rezultatais. Prisidėti prie naujojo vizualinio identiteto sukūrimo prieš daugiau nei tris mėnesius kvietėme kiekvieną miestietį. Užrašai tapo pagrindu visam mūsų vizualiniam identitetui, o universaliausias ir geriausiai visas organizacijos sritis atspindintis parašas atsidūrė ir pagrindinėje mūsų logotipo versijoje. Apie bendradarbiavimą ir savikūrą kalbėjome ir renginyje, kartu kviesdami prisijungti prie bendro meninio projekto įgyvendinimo, kurį esamuoju laiku kūrė menininkė Kornelija Žalpytė. Ačiū visiems, buvusiems kartu! Nuotraukos Gražvydo Jovaišos. Last Friday, the presentation of the new image of Kaunas IN took place at the Kaunas Tourism Information Centre, during which the new logo and communication direction were also revealed. \"Self-made city\" - this is how we can and want to describe Kaunas - a city where joint efforts, courage, and ambition turn into tangible results. More than three months ago, we invited every citizen to contribute to the creation of the new visual identity. The lettering became the basis for our entire visual identity, and the most versatile and best-representing signature across all areas of the organization has been incorporated into the main version of our logo. We also discussed collaboration and self-creation at the event, inviting people to join us in a joint artistic project created by the artist Kornelija Žalpytė. Thank you to everyone who attended! Photos by Gražvydas Jovaiša.\n\nKAUNAS IN | Mes atsinaujiname! Skaičiuodami aštuntus organizacijos veiklos metus, supratome, kad atėjo laikas pokyčiui, todėl šiandien pristatome savo naują vizualinį identitetą! Pasak agentūros vadovo Tadas Stankevičius, per daugelį metų Kaunas išgyveno daugybę skirtingų raidos etapų – nuo trūkumų taisymo ir bandymų pasivyti kitus miestus iki tapimo vienu iš didžiausią potencialą turinčių miestų, todėl ir agentūros poreikis atsinaujinti – savalaikis ir labai natūralus. „Senasis mūsų ženklas „Kaunastic“ savo versijų gausa dažnai įnešdavo sumaišties ir ne visada atspindėdavo daugiasluoksnę ir įvairiakryptę mūsų agentūros veiklą: kai kas galvojo, kad po „Kaunastic“ slepiasi tik turizmo sritis, kiti – atvirkščiai, manydavo, kad „Kaunastic“ – tai tik verslo ir plėtros agentūra, – sakė T. Stankevičius. – Šiandien „Kaunas IN“ atstovaujant miestą, tenka daugybės skirtingų vaidmenų ir prisitaikymo prie skirtingų auditorijų atsakomybė – nuo turistų iki verslininkų ir investuotojų. Norime būti matomi ir aiškiai suprantami visiems – tiek vietos gyventojams, tiek užsieniečiams.“ Daugiau apie pokyčius – pranešime. https://lnkd.in/d-e7Kd6e KAUNAS IN | We are Renewing! As we enter the eighth year of our organization's existence, we realized that it was time for a change. Today, we are introducing our new visual identity! According to Tadas Stankevičius, the agency's CEO, Kaunas has undergone many stages of development over the years—from addressing its shortcomings and trying to catch up with other cities, to becoming one of the cities with the highest potential. The agency's need for renewal is timely and very natural. \"Our old brand 'Kaunastic' was often confusing in its many versions and did not always reflect the multi-layered and diverse activities of our agency. Some people thought 'Kaunastic' was solely about tourism, while others believed it was just a business and development agency,\" said T. Stankevičius. \"Today, representing the city, Kaunas IN is responsible for many different roles and adapting to different audiences—from tourists to businesspeople and investors. We want to be visible and clearly understood by everyone—locals and foreigners alike.\"\n\nKAUNAS IN | BUSINESS Two years ago, the Kaunas Free Economic Zone (FEZ) announced that it attracted its first billion of investments. Currently, the amount of investments is approaching the second billion, amounting to €1.56 billion. This investment will create almost 10,000 high-skilled jobs in the near future. Vytautas Petružis, CEO of the Kaunas FEZ, says that the FEZ is as successful as the businesses operating here, and Aušrinė Armonaitė, the Minister of Economy and Innovation, notes the importance of the development conditions created for businesses.
