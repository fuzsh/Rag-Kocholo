The Socialist People's Front (SPF; Lithuanian: Socialistinis liaudies frontas) is a left-wing political association (formerly a party) in Lithuania formed in December 19, 2009, from a merger of the Front Party and Lithuanian Socialist Party. Held at Vilnius University, the party's foundation featured 102 delegates. The merger was approved by an affirmative vote of 96 delegates, with three against and one abstaining. The leader of the Lithuanian Socialist Party, Giedrius Petru≈æis, refused candidacy for chairperson of the merged party, claiming a desire to return to academic life. The leader of the Front Party, Algirdas Paleckis, was unanimously chosen as the leader of the SPF.[2]
