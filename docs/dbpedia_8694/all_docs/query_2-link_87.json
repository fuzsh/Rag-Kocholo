        "text": "I watched this film for the second time recently. Afaia, it did not inspire the Bob Seger song of the same title.\n\nGene Hackman plays a private detective with marriage issues who is assigned to locate an heiress by her stepmother. He uncovers a complex criminal network while attempting to resolve his personal problems.\n\nActually, the plot is very much secondary to character development, as this is very much an actor-led film. Hackman is quite superb (was he ever anything else?) in the central role of the detective who still mourns his aborted footballing career and struggles manfully with his feelings of lust for a nubile Melanie Griffith (in her screen debut). Great support from Susan Clark and Jennifer Warren as the two other women in his life.\n\nAnyone else seen this one?\n\nsaw it in the theater. Fantastic film. A young James Woods as Melanie's boyfriend.\n\nDialogue is so perfect. My favorite is the scene about Kennedys. It's so natural. Something two people would talk about late at night (in the 70's)\n\nThe violence of the end really freaked out the girl who was with me back then.\n\nMy wife didn't get the ending when I showed it to her a few years ago. I do wish the ending was different, and I don't say that very much.\n\nmusic note: The theme was recorded with vocals by Michael Franks on his first album. Lyrics don't have anything to do with the film\n\nLove this film, first saw it on TCM a good while back, at least 10 years ago. I have the dvd, and I think there's a Blu-ray out in Europe. This movie reminds me of \"Charley Varrick\" for some reason, another film I really like a lot. Man, I love me some 70's movies - good era for film, imho.\n\nI've seen it a few times, excellent noir, very dark with a bunch of unreliable characters. I don't remember the reaction it got when it was first released, but Hackman was on a creative role at this point. This one and \"The Conversation\" (genius movie) are my fave Hackman films..\n\nSeen it when it came out.\n\n3 Hackman's films stand out for me in the seventies, French Connection, The Conversation, and the dark\n\nNight Moves."
