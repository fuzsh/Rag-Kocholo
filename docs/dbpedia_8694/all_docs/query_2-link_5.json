        "text": "Considered one of the greatest actors of all time, Gene Hackman has received hundreds of awards and accolades over the years, including two Academy Awards, two BAFTA Awards, a Screen Actor's Guild Award, and four Golden Globe Awards.\n\nGene Hackman has remained relatively quiet about his personal life, preferring to be perceived as a \"common man,\" but fans are still curious to learn more about his relationships and children.\n\nWho are Gene Hackman's children?\n\nAfter more than six decades in Hollywood, Eugene \"Gene\" Allen Hackman retired from acting in 2008.\n\nHe admits that it must have been tough for his children, now all adults, to grow up with a famous father, especially one who wasn't always there for them, physically or emotionally.\n\n“I couldn't always be home with them when they were growing up and then, living in California, they've had my success always hanging over their heads,\" he said, in an August 2000 interview with The Irish Independent.\n\nHackman has three children, all from his first marriage to Faye Maltese.\n\nHackman's children include his son, Christopher Allen, and his two daughters, Leslie Anne and Elizabeth Jean.\n\nChristopher\n\nChristopher Allen Hackman is Gene Hackman's first child and only son.\n\nChristopher was born in January 1960.\n\nIn a January 2020 interview with Empire magazine, Hackman shared that his son, at one point, did dream of being an actor.\n\n“My son thought he wanted to be an actor at one time and was in New York and I wrote him a couple of little monologues,” he said.\n\n“I guess that’s where I started. I really enjoyed it. Ideas would just pop into my head and I would write them down,\" he said, reflecting on his passion for writing.\n\nHackman often spent time away from his children, shooting films on location, which he admits in a 2011 GQ interview.\n\n\"I lost touch with my son in terms of advice early on,\" he replied when asked about what advice he would give his son.\n\n\"Maybe it had to do with being gone so much, doing location films when he was at an age where he needed support and guidance.\"\n\n\"It was very tough for me to be gone for three months and then come home and start bossing him around,\" he added.\n\nChristopher has previously worked as a camera assistant and camera operator.\n\nHe was also reportedly a computer programmer, writing software programs.\n\nChristopher is married to Marian Ann Hackman, and while the duo reportedly have children, their names and ages are unknown.\n\nElizabeth\n\nElizabeth Jean Hackman is Gene Hackman's second child and oldest daughter.\n\nElizabeth was born in August 1962.\n\nShe was often photographed attending events with her famous father in her youth, including a December 1978 screening of Superman, where Hackman played Lex Luthor.\n\nIn 1996, she was also spotted attending a movie premiere for Hackman's film, The Chamber, alongside her stepmother and little sister.\n\nLittle is known about Elizabeth's career, relationships, and private life, as she tends to stay away from the spotlight.\n\nShe has reportedly dabbled in broadcast journalism and screenwriting.\n\nLeslie\n\nLeslie Anne is Gene Hackman's third and youngest child, and also his second daughter.\n\nLeslie was born in October 1966.\n\nIn an interview with Cigar Aficionado, Hackman recalls a troubled time in his life, when he was deep in debt, and even forced to rely on his children for help.\n\n\"I used to have to borrow my daughter's car to go to interviews in Hollywood,\" he said.\n\n\"Just a piece-of-shit Toyota and I'd have to park it a couple of blocks [away] and walk so I wouldn't be seen as being that needy.\"\n\n\"Yeah, I was in trouble in those days...I was six, seven million bucks in debt; I had spent too much and I had a lot of tax shelters that didn't work.\"\n\n\"I owed the government four million dollars. I was just barely hanging in, taking pretty much anything that was offered to me and trying to make it work.\"\n\nLike her older sister, Leslie has also been spotted attending movie premieres with her father in the 1980s and 1990s.\n\nShe attended the 41st annual Golden Globe Awards with Hackman in 1984 and accompanied him to a screening of The Godfather Part III in December 1990.\n\nIn line with her siblings, Leslie shies away from the spotlight, preferring to keep her life private.\n\nWhen did Gene and Faye Maltese divorce?\n\nGene Hackman has been married twice in his life.\n\nHis three children, Leslie, Elizabeth, and Christopher are from his first marriage, to Faye Maltese.\n\nHackman married Maltese on January 1, 1956, just one year after the duo met at a YMCA dance in New York City.\n\nMaltese was a bank secretary at the time, while Hackman was renting a room at the YMCA, trying to make a name for himself as an actor in the entertainment industry.\n\nHackman and Maltese were both relatively young when they married, as they were each just 25 and 26 years old, respectively.\n\nLittle is known about their relationship, though Hackman himself has admitted he spent a considerable time away from his wife, children, and the couple's home due to his career.\n\nIn 1972, Hackman won an Academy Award for Best Actor for his role as the New York City detective, Jimmy \"Popeye\" Doyle in the 1971 film, The French Connection.\n\nHe thanked Maltese – and only Maltese – in his speech, saying: “I want to thank Faye Maltese for bringing me uptown.”\n\nStill, despite having a lot of love for each other, the duo ultimately separated.\n\nHackman and Maltese divorced in 1986, after three decades of marriage.\n\nMaltese, born in 1929, passed away on April 26, 2017, at 88 years old.\n\nIn 1991, Hackman remarried, tying the knot with classical pianist Betsy Arakawa, who was 32 years his junior.\n\nHe began dating Arakawa in 1984, while still married to Maltese.\n\nThe duo reportedly met at a fitness center in Los Angeles.\n\nThe couple have kept a relatively low profile over the years, and live in Santa Fe, New Mexico.\n\nThey've been married for 33 years and counting.\n\nOn March 28, 2024, the happy couple was even spotted grabbing dinner at Pappadeaux’s Seafood Kitchen, their first (photographed) public outing in decades."
