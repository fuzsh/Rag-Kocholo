        "text": "WASHINGTON, D.C. Actor Gene Hackman considers himself \"somewhat politically active.\"\n\nWhen the big civil rights movement was in full swing, back in the '60s, Hackman was in his mid-to-late 30s.\n\nSo, did he march with Martin Luther King? Did he sing protest songs?\n\nDid he tune in, turn on and drop out?\n\nNaw.\n\n\"I have to confess that I was involved in my own career in the '60s,\" Hackman says. \"I had a family I was just starting. I was very much comfortable. Comfortable is a relative term, of course. I lived in a kind of a ghetto in New York.\n\n\"I was doing my own selfish thing at the time. The whole civil rights thing was an arm's length deal for me, I'm somewhat ashamed to say.\"\n\nToday, nearly 25 years after the fact, Hackman is playing in a movie about an FBI agent who investigated the disappearance of three civil rights workers in Mississippi.\n\nIn \"Mississippi Burning,\" which opens in Oklahoma City on Jan. 13, Hackman is no longer \"an arm's length\" away from the civil rights movement.\n\n\"I'm somewhat politically involved, but I'm not what you would call a real activist,\" Hackman says. \"I would hope that this would redeem me somewhat.\n\n\"In regards to the whole civil rights things and the black question... You would think that that would have been primary in what we were doing. I know it was maybe the hardest film I've ever done emotionally, but it had very little to do with the kind of work we were doing, in terms of subject matter. It had to do with the work atmosphere.\n\n\"(Director) Alan (Parker) is a very concentrated, very tough kind of taskmaster, and I think that's why the film is as good as it is, too. He just demands total concentration, and I, as an actor, concentrate pretty well. I was really finished when this was done.\"\n\nTo build on his role as Rupert Anderson, Hackman used his vast experience and knowledge in films. And...\n\n\"I had known a couple of guys from Yazoo City, Miss., who I had been in the Marine Corps with,\" he says.\n\n\"My recollection of them were that they were good ol' boys. I don't know what their politics were; I don't recall that, but that kind of thing was what I patterned, what I did. A seemingly benign character with something going on inside.\"\n\nAnd working with Willem Dafoe, who plays special agent Alan Ward, was a joy, says Hackman.\n\n\"It was interesting because he is very different,\" he says. \"He approaches things totally different(ly), and I think because he does, we got along great.\n\n\"We really worked well together. He's much more thoughtful as an actor. He kind of thinks things out. I'm more instinctive. If I walk into a room, I don't want to learn the lines. I want to walk in and feel like I want to do it. I eventually get to the lines, and hopefully I don't change them that much. But that's my impulse about acting. I don't recommend that.\"\n\nIn several scenes in \"Mississippi Burning,\" Hackman is called on to \"play the heavy.\"\n\nEven though he has been in his share of violent movies, that doesn't mean that it comes easy to him.\n\n\"I find it difficult to be cruel,\" he says. \"It takes a lot out of you, regardless of how easy it looks. So it was very tough for me to be as brutal as the character had to be in some sequences.\n\n\"And not only while you're doing it, but you know you have to do it. A month down the line you have to do this scene, you have to trash somebody in the barber shop, whatever else I did there in the bar.\n\n\"I asked to be replaced on \"The French Connection.' I'm not trying to make myself out as this big, sensitive guy. Certain people can do certain things.\n\n\"But the second or third day in \"The French Connection,' I had to punch this black pusher that we had captured in the street at the very top of the film. I just didn't do it very well, and the director (William Friedkin) said we were going to have to reshoot it.\n\n\"I asked him to replace me. Thank goodness we got through it, but it's tough sometimes. If you're trained as an actor, that kind of thing doesn't necessarily come easy.\"\n\nHackman won an Academy Award for his role in \"The French Connection,\" one of five that film captured.\n\nThere already is considerable talk that Hackman may be bringing home another statuette for his work in \"Mississippi Burning.\"\n\nThe buzz around Hollywood is that Hackman, in particular, and the film, in general, will be vying for top Oscars.\n\n\"Having won an Oscar already, it's probably a little different than if I hadn't,\" Hackman says, of the Oscar talk. \"It would be nice to be recognized. But really... and I know this sounds like when they interview the basketball players and football players and they say it was all a team effort and all this... what happens with the awards is it makes the film that much more interesting for the mass audience, and they then want to see that.\n\n\"They recognize this film. If the film is recognized, it'll be seen.\"\n\nThe trend in Hollywood today seems to be toward \"personal\" movies.\n\nDirectors go for movies they want to make not necessarily the ones that will make the most money. Issues are big.\n\n\"It's a sign of the times,\" Hackman says. \"The movie industry follows trends. If something starts to work, everybody kind of jumps in and says, \"Let's do that.' \"It seems valid. I don't see anything wrong with that. It's the kind of thing that happens to us every day with the news. We become interested in Iran-Contra. We become interested in Gorbachev, and that is interesting for a while, and then we drift off to something else.\n\n\"I'm not trying to be pretentious and pretend that I am a great activist in terms of that I have to do films with messages.\n\n\"For me, it's more important to be known as a craftsman and a good actor. It would be pretentious of me to claim anything different.\" BIOG: NAME:\n\nArchive ID: 371284"
