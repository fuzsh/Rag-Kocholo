He started his career along with Dean but only a supporting player\n\nYeah exactly - he's hard to classify too - he's in movies with Dean, I think he's a lead actor with a name in Night Tide (1961) and Hackman maybe in Lilith (1964) - those two guys seem way closer to me than Dean/Hackman for some reason.........but it might just \"seem\" that way, it isn't a science.\n\nPost by Good God on\n\nTo me, two actors are from the same generation (regardless of when they started or ended) if they're within 5 years of each other. Perhaps more than 5, depending on the circumstances, but 5 years is close enough for me. Of course, transitive property doesn't apply, because that would fuck everything up.\n\nPost by countjohn on\n\n@raygittes07 said:\n\nYeah exactly - he's hard to classify too - he's in movies with Dean, I think he's a lead actor with a name in Night Tide (1961) and Hackman maybe in Lilith (1964) - those two guys seem way closer to me than Dean/Hackman for some reason.........but it might just \"seem\" that way, it isn't a science.\n\nSounds reasonable,\n\nAnd whaaaat about Msmoviestar? She's very hard to classy, is she the same generation with Drew Barrymore or Lionel Barrymore?\n\nLike all great stars MsMovieStar is shrouded in an aura of mystery. No one even knows her real age.\n\nPost by stephen on\n\nIn terms of their age, yeah.\n\nIn terms of career, no. Dean was dead six years before Hackman got his start in film and television, and I think that Hackman (along with Robert Duvall) are the bleeding edge of the De Niro/Pacino/Hoffman/Nicholson generation, whereas Dean is kind of in the no-man's-land between the Brando/Clift generation and the '70s gang. Even though Dean and Dennis Hopper were the same age or even younger than Hackman/Duvall, they had gotten their start earlier and had defined themselves as rising young stars, whereas Hackman/Duvall kind of showed up fully formed.\n\nIt'd be like comparing Jacob Tremblay to an actor who is his same age, but who doesn't get his real start until he's in his twenties. Hard to really compare them because of the headstart Tremblay would have.\n\nPost by cherry68 on\n\n@raygittes07 said:\n\nYeah exactly - he's hard to classify too - he's in movies with Dean, I think he's a lead actor with a name in Night Tide (1961) and Hackman maybe in Lilith (1964) - those two guys seem way closer to me than Dean/Hackman for some reason.........but it might just \"seem\" that way, it isn't a science.\n\nSounds reasonable,\n\nAnd whaaaat about Msmoviestar?
