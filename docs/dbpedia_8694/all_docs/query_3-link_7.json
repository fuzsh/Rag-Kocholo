        "text": "Eugene Alden Hackman (born January 30, 1930) is an American retired actor and novelist. Hackman was born in San Bernardino, California. His parents divorced while he was a child, and he moved from one place to another until he settled finally in Danville, Illinois, where he lived with his English-born grandmother. At the age of 16 he left home to join the Marines, where he served 3 years as a radio operator. Having finished his service, he moved to New York, where he worked in several minor jobs. He then studied television production and journalism at the University of Illinois.\n\nAlready over 30 years old, Hackman decided to become an actor, and joined the Pasadena Playhouse in California. It was in that school that Hackman became friends with another person who wanted to be an actor named Dustin Hoffman.\n\nAfter working hard in many roles he became a well-respected actor. He has won two Academy Awards, and has played many well-known roles.\n\nWelcome to Mooseport (2004)\n\nRunaway Jury (2003)\n\nBehind Enemy Lines (2001)\n\nThe Royal Tenenbaums (2001)\n\nHeist (2001)\n\nHeartbreakers (2001)\n\nThe Mexican (2001)\n\nThe Replacements (2000)\n\nUnder Suspicion (2000)\n\nEnemy of the State (1998)\n\nTwilight (1998)\n\nAbsolute Power (1997)\n\nThe Chamber (1996)\n\nExtreme Measures (1996)\n\nThe Birdcage (1996)\n\nGet Shorty (1995)\n\nCrimson Tide (1995)\n\nThe Quick and the Dead (1995)\n\nWyatt Earp (1994)\n\nGeronimo: An American Legend (1993)\n\nThe Firm (1993)\n\nUnforgiven (1992)\n\nCompany Business (1991)\n\nClass Action (1991)\n\nLoose Cannons (1990)\n\nPostcards from the Edge (1990)\n\nNarrow Margin (1990)\n\nThe Package (1988)\n\nBat*21 (1988)\n\nMississippi Burning (1988)\n\nNo Way Out (1987)\n\nAnother Woman (1987)\n\nSuperman IV: The Quest for Peace (1987)\n\nHoosiers (1986)\n\nPower (1986)\n\nTarget (1985)\n\nTwice In A Lifetime (1985)\n\nEureka (1984)\n\nMisunderstood (1984)\n\nUncommon Valor (1983)\n\nUnder Fire (1983)\n\nReds (1981)\n\nSuperman II (19810)\n\nAll Night Long (1981)\n\nSuperman (1978)\n\nThe Domino Principle (1978)\n\nA Bridge Too Far (1977)\n\nMarch Or Die (1977)\n\nFrench Connection II (1975)\n\nLucky Lady (1975)\n\nNight Moves (1975)\n\nThe Conversation (1974)\n\nBite the Bullet (1974)\n\nYoung Frankenstein (1974)\n\nScarecrow (1973)\n\nThe Poseidon Adventure (1972)\n\nPrime Cut (1972)\n\nThe Hunting Party (1971)\n\nThe French Connection (1971)\n\nI Never Sang for My Father (1970)\n\nDownhill Racer (1969)\n\nMarooned (1969)\n\nThe Gypsy Moths (1969)\n\nBonnie and Clyde (1967)\n\nHawaii (1966)\n\nLilith (1964)"
