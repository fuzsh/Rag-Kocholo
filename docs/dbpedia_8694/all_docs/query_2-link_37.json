        "text": "From No Way Out to his portrayal of Lex Luthor in Superman, Gene Hackman has created indelible characters that resonate with audiences. Weâre counting down some of his best roles including Hackmanâs lesser-known spy movies and thrillers you may want to stream right now.Â\n\nâ\n\n10. Bat*21 (1998)\n\nLt. Col. Hambleton (Gene Hackman) is 54 and out of his element when he is shot down behind enemy lines in the Vietnam War. Capt. Bartholomew âBird-Dogâ Clark (Danny Glover) is his only connection to the world through radio transmission but can the two of them come up with an escape plan in time to save Hambletonâs life? (Apple TV, Prime Video)\n\nâ\n\n9. Absolute Power (1997)\n\nLuther Whitney (Clint Eastwood) is robbing the home of a billionaire when he is interrupted by an amorous couple.

(Prime Video, Apple TV, Sky Store, Chili, Microsoft Store, Rakuten TV, Google Play Movies, YouTube)\n\nâ\n\n8. Under Fire (1983)\n\nâUnder Fire is a gripping political thriller set against the backdrop of a war-torn Central America. Hackman portrays an American photojournalist, Russell Price, who finds himself embroiled in a dangerous web of political intrigue. Alongside his journalist colleague, played by Nick Nolte, and a local woman (Joanna Cassidy), Price uncovers a covert plot involving a corrupt dictator and American involvement in the country's civil war.

Hackman portrays Agent Rupert Anderson, a determined investigator who, alongside his partner Alan Ward (Willem Dafoe), embarks on a journey to Mississippi to uncover the truth.

(MGM, Apple TV, Prime Video, Sky Store, Chili)\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\n5. The Package (1989)\n\nDirected by Andrew Davis, this 1989 film showcases Hackman's incredible range as he portrays Sergeant Johnny Gallagher, a seasoned military veteran assigned to transport a mysterious prisoner. As the plot unfolds, Gallagher finds himself entangled in a treacherous conspiracy that goes far beyond a simple delivery mission. Hackman's portrayal is marked by his trademark intensity, bringing a sense of gravitas to the character. The Package reaffirmed Hackmanâs status as one of Hollywood's finest actors. (YouTube, Google Play, Apple TV)\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\n4. No Way Out (1998)\n\nIn the captivating spy thriller No Way Out, Hackman delivers a compelling performance as Defense Secretary David Brice, entangled in a web of love, lies, and murder. Directed by Roger Donaldson, the film revolves around Navy Lt. Tom Farrell (Kevin Costner), who engages in a passionate affair with Susan Atwell (Sean Young). Their whirlwind romance takes a sinister turn when Farrell discovers that his superior, Defense Secretary Brice, is also romantically involved with Susan. (Peacock, MGM, Apple TV)\n\nâ\n\n3. The Conversation (1974)\n\nFrancis Ford Coppolaâs tense, paranoid thriller The Conversation sees Hackman in the role of Harry Caul, a shy surveillance expert hired by a mysterious client to track a young couple, Mark (Frederic Forrest) and Ann (Cindy Williams). Caul and his associate Stan (John Cazale) record a cryptic conversation between them and Caul becomes obsessed, trying to determine if the couple is in danger. In another actorâs hands, Caul could be astonishingly bleak but in Hackmanâs hands, the character is superbly played. Less well known than The Conversation, but just as impressive, Night Moves is one of the great thrillers of the 1970s with Hackman as a private detective. (Prime Video)\n\nâ\n\n2. Enemy of the State (1998)â\n\nIn this gripping thriller, Hackman delivers a stellar performance as Edward âBrillâ Lyle, an ex-intelligence agent entangled in a high-stakes game of deception and survival. Directed by Tony Scott, Enemy of the State revolves around the life of Robert Clayton Dean (Will Smith), an unsuspecting labor lawyer. When corrupt NSA official Thomas Reynolds (Jon Voight) orchestrates a congressman's assassination, Dean becomes an unwitting pawn in a sinister plot. Enemy of the State is as thrilling as it is memorable. (Disney+, Google Play, Prime Video, YouTube, Apple TV)\n\nâ\n\n1. The French Connection (1971)\n\nBased on real-life detective Eddie Egan, the character of Popeye Doyle shows Hackman's remarkable ability to immerse himself in complex and morally ambiguous roles. It took the persistent prodding of French Connection director William Friedkin to fully realize the character's abrasive nature. Nevertheless, Hackman's Oscar-winning performance is undeniably captivating, commanding the screen in gripping and violent sequences. Once you've enjoyed this masterpiece, check out the 1975 sequel. (BBC iPlayer, YouTube, Apple TV, Disney+, Google Play, Amazon Prime)\n\nâ\n\nHonorable Mention\n\nâ\n\nUnforgiven (1992)\n\nHackman finally won his second gong portraying Little Bill, the sheriff in Clint Eastwoodâs farewell to the western Unforgiven. Little Bill is a deeply unpleasant man but Hackmanâs layered and subtle performance makes him a dreamer as well as a sadist, a killer who is building a house to fulfill a vision of sitting on his porch as the sun goes down. The actorâs ability to combine geniality with menace is well used, particularly in the scene where he violently punishes Richard Harrisâs English Bob for having the temerity to carry a gun in his town. (Prime Video)\n\nâ\n\nBonnie and Clyde (1967)\n\nIn a pivotal turn that propelled Gene Hackman's career, he embodied Buck Barrow in Arthur Penn's electrifying action-adventure period drama Bonnie and Clyde. He shone alongside Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway in their title roles. Buck bursts onto the screen as an uncontainable force, a swaggering showman who loves to regale others with his questionable jokes, but there's an underlying innocence that makes him impossible to outright despise. Hackman's extraordinary performance earned him a coveted Oscar nomination. (Prime Video, Apple TV)"
