        "text": "#1970s #1980s #AllPosts\n\nOnce upon a time before Hollywood…\n\nOn Gene Hackman’s career as a Marine and with an entertainment connection.\n\nMany of you will know I usually only have War Movies on my review list if a spy is involved, the film has an all-star cast or it’s a recommendation from my Darlin Husband. This explains the presence of Where Eagles Dare (1968), The Eagle Has Landed (1978) and My Boy Jack (2007) on my blog. But saying that I’ve never been one to refuse a Cold War movie.\n\nAfter Jonathan from Dubsism invited me to be a co-host for the US Marines blogathon – nattily titled the Send in the Marine’s blogathon – my first choice was naturally A Few Good Men (1992), as I’m a huge Jack Nicholson fan. However, after Dubs added that films from actors who were US Marines could be included in this blogathon, I was torn (as usual).\n\nThis was after reading about the wealth of acting talent who used to be marines. These big names include everyone from George C Scott to Bea Arthur and Brian Keith to Adam Driver. I finally settled on Gene Hackman, as my marine of choice.\n\nSo my final choice was returning to a previous decision (from my well-known dithering stage) of Gene Hackman. Hackman was a Marine Corporal before he hit the wee and big screen in 1961. A 16-year-old Hackman lied about his age on signing up as a Marine. He first worked as a radio operator in China and then later he was employed as a DJ and newscaster.\n\nHe served as a Marine for five years between 1946-51 and was promoted as far as Corporal. However, he was demoted three times for leaving his post. Gene Hackman himself says HERE of his experiences,\n\n“I have trouble with direction, because I have trouble with authority. I was not a good Marine.”\n\nSuperman (1978)…\n\nLex Luthor first appearance | Superman (1978), Flashback FM\n\nWhen it comes to Superman films, most 1970s and 1980s kids will argue that we got the best cast even if the films themselves weren’t as good. The lineup of Christopher Reeve as the titular superhero, Superman (and Clark Kent), Margot Kidder as Lois Lane and Hackman as Lex Luthor is simply the most remembered for all the right reasons.\n\nBe it Hackman’s dastardly villain’s on-screen sparring with Reeve’s Superman, which is worth a watch. Or those comic moments where Hackman delivered an abundance of fantastic one-liners. In the first film, these included him saying to his hapless assistant, Otis;\n\n“Do you know why the number two hundred is so vitally descriptive to both you and me? It’s your weight and my I.Q.”.\n\nNo Way Out (1987)…\n\nNo Way Out Official Trailer #1 – Gene Hackman Movie (1987) HD, Movieclips Classic Trailers\n\nThis was one of my fave suspense ridden Cold War movies as a kid, and it’s still just as good today. Possibly a favourite back then due to the intricate plot. But it’s more likely due to having a wee bit of a crush (like most of my peers) on his co-star, Kevin Costner back then. Starring Costner as Tom Farrell, a Navy Lieutenant and Hackman as David Brice, the American Secretary of Defense. Both these men had a bit of a fling with Sean Young as Susan.\n\nFarrell is transferred to work in Intelligence with Brice after a heroic act. After Farrell resumes his affair with Susan, she tells him about her relationship with a married man. She tells him that the other man in her life is… (you guessed it) Brice. While Farrell’s with Susan one day, she notes Brice is on his way to visit her. Brice notices Farrell leave her home as he exits the scene. Brice doesn’t recognise him from a distance, he asks Susan about her other man.\n\nHowever as Susan tries to end things with him, she’s accidentally killed. In a panic, Brice visits a colleague Pritchard, who covers up Brice’s murder by pinning the blame on her other lover claiming he was a “KGB sleeper agent”, called “Yuri”. The hunt is on to find this “culprit” with Farrell investigating. Later Farrell is believed to be a possible suspect…\n\nLike Roger Ebert, I found this film an interesting one and one that has you on the edge of your seat with the many twists and turns in the story. Ebert describes it perfectly as\n\n“like a terrifying jigsaw puzzle. And because the story is so tightly wound and the performances are so good, I found myself really caring about the characters.”\n\nThe Poseidon Adventure (1972)…\n\nThe Poseidon Adventure (1972) Trailer, SPARTEN2\n\nI’ve reviewed this film HERE recently in a tribute to the late Carol Lynley. However, this is like Superman a film that most British kids in the seventies would remember him from in the Christmas telly lineup. This time, however, Hackman is cast as a hero rather than a villain.\n\nHackman here as the Rev. Scott – in a 70s James Garner inspired polo neck – heading a fabulous all-star cast with everyone from Shelley Winters to Pamela Sue Martin, and Red Buttons to Ernest Borgnine. The plot from a review I wrote earlier tells how\n\n“After meeting those very important passengers, we hit a storm and then an underwater earthquake causes a large wave on the stroke of midnight. This wave turning the luxury cruise ship, the SS Poseidon over with the passengers trapped inside.”\n\nThis film is well known for those actors carrying out their own stunts and a gem from Irwin Allen. The man behind The Swarm and known to many of us as The Master of Disaster. This disaster film was followed by a sequel with Michael Caine and Telly Savalas.\n\nMisunderstood (1984)…\n\nGene Hackman in Misunderstood 1984 TV trailer, robatsea2009\n\nThis has to be my favourite of Hackman’s movies. It’s one I’d easily rewatch, and he’s convincing in this tearjerker. Here Hackman is seen playing an ex-pat American widower, Ned Rawley. Rawley has difficulties communicating with his young sons after their mother’s death. It’s a lovely tender role for Hackman, as the boys’ father and his performance is a heartwrenching yet credible one.\n\nThe contrast in his relationships with his kids is seen in flashbacks which show that he was closer to his sons, while his wife was alive. However now with her death, it’s clear that Rawley has still had much to learn about his children and how they need his support now.\n\nHis sons are played by 11-year-old Henry Thomas and 7-year-old Huckleberry Fox. With the late Rip Torn as his brother in law. There seems to be a lack of understanding between Hackman and his older son, Andrew who he believes is old enough to cope with this news. Andrew is also asked to keep this news of his mother’s death from his wee brother.\n\nNeedless to say, the young boy struggles with this burden. Rawley may sound quite villainous in this description but his character appears to have thrown himself into his work as he too can’t deal with his grief. In time through talking with his brother in law he learns how to support his son and there are some lovely scenes with the pair.\n\nThere are of course many many more great performances from Gene Hackman. Be it as a patriarch in The Royal Tenenbaums (2001), Clyde Barrow’s brother in the biopic of Bonnie and Clyde (1967) or as a policeman in The French Connection (1971), Hackman always gives a sterling performance.\n\nMy Send in The Marines Blogathon 2019\n\nThis post was added to the Send in the Marines blogathon. Other reviews with Gene Hackman include Superman, Misunderstood, Bonnie and Clyde and Best Actor Oscar Winners in Superhero Movies. With those films’ casts, more on Margot Kidder’s role can be read in her tribute HERE. Christopher Reeve starred in Somewhere in Time and Deathtrap. No Way Out also stars Sean Young as seen in Blade Runner and Kevin Costner in The Big Chill. Stars from The Poseidon Adventure are reviewed in the film HERE and include Escape from New York (Ernest Borgnine), The Devil’s Daughter (Shelley Winters), Cruise into Terror (Stella Stevens) and Dynasty (Pamela Sue Martin). Misunderstood starred Huckleberry Fox from Terms of Endearment and Henry Thomas in ET The Extra Terrestrial."
