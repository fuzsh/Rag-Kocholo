        "text": "Eugene Allen Hackman (born January 30, 1930) is an American retired actor. In a career that spanned more than six decades, he received two Academy Awards, two BAFTA Awards, four Golden Globes, a Screen Actors Guild Award, and the Silver Bear. Hackman's two Academy Award wins included one for Best Actor for his role as Jimmy \"Popeye\" Doyle in William Friedkin's acclaimed thriller The French Connection (1971) and the other for Best Supporting Actor for his role as \"Little\" Bill Daggett in Clint Eastwood's Western film Unforgiven (1992). His other Oscar-nominated roles were in Bonnie and Clyde (1967), I Never Sang for My Father (1970), and Mississippi Burning (1988).\n\nHackman gained further fame for his portrayal of Lex Luthor in Superman (1978) and its sequels Superman II (1980) and Superman IV: The Quest for Peace (1987). He also acted in The Poseidon Adventure (1972), The Conversation (1974), Reds (1981), Hoosiers (1986), No Way Out (1987), The Firm (1993), Get Shorty (1995), Crimson Tide (1995), The Birdcage (1996), Absolute Power (1997), and The Royal Tenenbaums (2001).\n\nEarly life and education\n\nHackman was born in San Bernardino, California, the son of Eugene Ezra Hackman and Anna Lyda Elizabeth (née Gray). He has one brother, Richard. He has Pennsylvania Dutch, English, and Scottish ancestry; his mother was Canadian, and was born in Lambton, Ontario. His family moved frequently, finally settling in Danville, Illinois, where they lived in the house of his English-born maternal grandmother, Beatrice. Hackman's father operated the printing press for the Commercial-News, a local paper. His parents divorced when he was 13 and his father subsequently left the family. Hackman decided that he wanted to become an actor when he was ten years old.\n\nHackman lived briefly in Storm Lake, Iowa, and spent his sophomore year at Storm Lake High School. He left home at age 16 and lied about his age to enlist in the United States Marine Corps. He served four and a half years as a field radio operator. He was stationed in China (Qingdao and later in Shanghai). When the Communist Revolution conquered the mainland in 1949, Hackman was assigned to Hawaii and Japan. Following his discharge in 1951, he moved to New York City and had several jobs. His mother died in 1962 as a result of a fire she accidentally started while smoking. He began a study of journalism and television production at the University of Illinois under the G.I. Bill, but left and moved back to California.\n\nCareer\n\nBeginnings to the 1960s\n\nIn 1956, Hackman began pursuing an acting career. He joined the Pasadena Playhouse in California, where he befriended another aspiring actor, Dustin Hoffman. Already seen as outsiders by their classmates, Hackman and Hoffman were voted \"The Least Likely To Succeed\", and Hackman got the lowest score the Pasadena Playhouse had yet given. Determined to prove them wrong, Hackman moved to New York City. A 2004 article in Vanity Fair described Hackman, Hoffman, and Robert Duvall as struggling California-born actors and close friends, sharing NYC apartments in various two-person combinations in the 1960s. To support himself between acting jobs, Hackman was working at a Howard Johnson's restaurant when he encountered an instructor from the Pasadena Playhouse, who said that his job proved that Hackman \"wouldn't amount to anything\". ..... Rejection motivated Hackman, who said, .....\n\nHackman got various bit roles, for example on the TV series Route 66 in 1963, and began performing in several Off-Broadway plays. In 1964 he had an offer to co-star in the play Any Wednesday with actress Sandy Dennis. This opened the door to film work. His first role was in Lilith, with Jean Seberg and Warren Beatty in the leading roles. In 1966 he played a small part as Dr. John Whipple in the epic film Hawaii. In 1967 he appeared in an episode of the television series The Invaders entitled \"The Spores\". Another supporting role, Buck Barrow in 1967's Bonnie and Clyde, earned him an Academy Award nomination as Best Supporting Actor. In 1968 he appeared in an episode of I Spy, in the role of \"Hunter\", in the episode \"Happy Birthday... Everybody\". That same year he starred in the CBS Playhouse episode \"My Father and My Mother\" and the dystopian television film Shadow on the Land. In 1969 he played a ski coach in Downhill Racer and an astronaut in Marooned. Also that year, he played a member of a barnstorming skydiving team that entertained mostly at county fairs, a movie which also inspired many to pursue skydiving and has a cult-like status amongst skydivers as a result: The Gypsy Moths. He nearly accepted the role of Mike Brady for the TV series The Brady Bunch, but his agent advised that he decline it in exchange for a more promising role, which he did.\n\n1970s and stardom\n\nHackman was nominated for a second Best Supporting Actor Academy Award for his role in I Never Sang for My Father (1970). He starred in Doctors' Wives (1971), The Hunting Party (1971) then won the Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance as New York City Detective Jimmy \"Popeye\" Doyle in The French Connection (1971), marking his graduation to stardom.\n\nAfter The French Connection, Hackman starred in ten films (not including his cameo in Young Frankenstein) over the next three years, making him the most prolific actor in Hollywood during that time frame. He followed The French Connection with leading roles in Cisco Pike (1972), and Prime Cut (1972) then was in the disaster film The Poseidon Adventure (1972) and Francis Ford Coppola's The Conversation (1974), which was nominated for several Oscars, and won the Palme d'Or in Cannes. That same year, Hackman appeared in what would become one of his most famous comedic roles, as Harold the Blind Man in Young Frankenstein. Hackman also appeared in Scarecrow (1973) alongside Al Pacino, Zandy's Bride (1974) and Night Moves (1975) for director Arthur Penn.\n\nHackman played one of Teddy Roosevelt's former Rough Riders in the Western horse-race saga Bite the Bullet (1975). He reprised his Oscar-winning role as Doyle in the sequel French Connection II (1975), and co-starred with Burt Reynolds and Liza Minnelli in Lucky Lady (1975), a notorious flop. After making The Domino Principle (1977) for Stanley Kramer, Hackman was part of an all-star cast in the war film A Bridge Too Far (1977), playing Polish General Stanisław Sosabowski, and was an officer in the French Foreign Legion in March or Die (1977.)\n\nHackman showed a talent for both comedy and the \"slow burn\" as criminal mastermind Lex Luthor in Superman: The Movie (1978), a role he would reprise in its 1980 and 1987 sequels.\n\n1980s\n\nHackman alternated between leading and supporting roles during the 1980s, with prominent roles in Reds (1981)—directed by and starring Warren Beatty—Under Fire (1983), Hoosiers (1986) (which an American Film Institute poll in 2008 voted the fourth-greatest film of all time in the sports genre), No Way Out (1987) and Mississippi Burning (1988), where he was nominated for a second Best Actor Oscar. Between 1985 and 1988, he starred in nine films, making him the busiest actor, alongside Steve Guttenberg.\n\n1990s\n\nHackman appeared with Anne Archer in Narrow Margin (1990), a remake of the 1952 film The Narrow Margin. ..... Hackman had pledged to avoid violent roles, but Eastwood convinced him to take the part, which earned him a second Oscar, this time for Best Supporting Actor. The film also won Best Picture.\n\nIn 1993, he appeared in Geronimo: An American Legend as Brigadier General George Crook, and co-starred with Tom Cruise as a corrupt lawyer in The Firm, a legal thriller based on the John Grisham novel of the same name. Hackman would appear in two other films based on John Grisham novels, playing convict Sam Cayhall on death row in The Chamber (1996), and jury consultant Rankin Fitch in Runaway Jury (2003).\n\nOther notable films Hackman appeared in during the 1990s include Wyatt Earp (1994) (as Nicholas Porter Earp, Wyatt Earp's father), The Quick and the Dead (1995) opposite Sharon Stone, Leonardo DiCaprio and Russell Crowe, and as submarine Captain Frank Ramsey alongside Denzel Washington in Crimson Tide (1995). Hackman played movie director Harry Zimm with John Travolta in the comedy-drama Get Shorty (1995). He reunited with Clint Eastwood in Absolute Power (1997), and co-starred with Will Smith in Enemy of the State (1998), his character reminiscent of the one he had portrayed in The Conversation.\n\nIn 1996, he took a comedic turn as conservative Senator Kevin Keeley in The Birdcage with Robin Williams and Nathan Lane.\n\n2000s\n\nHackman co-starred with Owen Wilson in Behind Enemy Lines (2001), and appeared in the David Mamet crime thriller Heist (2001), as an aging professional thief of considerable skill who is forced into one final job. He also gained much critical acclaim playing against type as the head of an eccentric family in Wes Anderson's comedy film The Royal Tenenbaums (2001), for which he received the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Motion Picture Musical or Comedy. In 2003, he also starred in another John Grisham legal drama, Runaway Jury, at long last getting to make a picture with his long-time friend Dustin Hoffman. In 2004, Hackman appeared alongside Ray Romano in the comedy Welcome to Mooseport, his final film acting role to date.\n\nHackman was honored with the Cecil B. DeMille Award from the Golden Globe Awards for his \"outstanding contribution to the entertainment field\" in 2003.\n\nRetirement from acting\n\nOn July 7, 2004, Hackman gave a rare interview to Larry King, where he announced that he had no future film projects lined up and believed his acting career was over. In 2008, while promoting his third novel, he confirmed that he had retired from acting. When asked during a GQ interview in 2011 if he would ever come out of retirement to do one more film, he said he might consider it \"if I could do it in my own house, maybe, without them disturbing anything and just one or two people.\" He briefly came out of retirement to narrate two documentaries related to the Marine Corps: The Unknown Flag Raiser of Iwo Jima (2016)' and We, The Marines (2017).\n\nWriting\n\nTogether with undersea archaeologist Daniel Lenihan, Hackman has written three historical fiction novels: Wake of the Perdido Star (1999), a sea adventure of the 19th century; Justice for None (2004), a Depression-era tale of murder; and Escape from Andersonville (2008) about a prison escape during the American Civil War. His first solo effort, a story of love and revenge set in the Old West titled Payback at Morning Peak, was released in 2011. His most recent novel Pursuit, a police thriller, followed in 2013.\n\nIn 2011, Hackman appeared on the Fox Sports Radio show The Loose Cannons, where he discussed his career and his novels with Pat O'Brien, Steve Hartman, and Vic \"The Brick\" Jacobs.\n\nPersonal life\n\nMarriages and family\n\nHackman has been married twice. He has three children from his first marriage.\n\nIn 1956, Hackman married Faye Maltese (1929–2017), with whom he had one son and two daughters: Christopher Allen, Elizabeth Jean, and Leslie Anne Hackman. He was often out on location making films while the children were growing up. The couple divorced in 1986, after three decades of marriage.\n\nIn 1991, he married classical pianist Betsy Arakawa (b. 1961). They share a Santa Fe, New Mexico home, which Architectural Digest featured in 1990. At the time, the home blended Southwestern styles and crested a twelve-acre hilltop, with a 360-degree view that stretched to the Colorado mountains. As of 2022 , Hackman continues to attend Santa Fe cultural events.\n\nPolitical views\n\nHackman is a supporter of the Democratic Party, and was \"proud\" to be included on Nixon's Enemies List. However, he has spoken fondly of Republican president Ronald Reagan.\n\nInterests\n\nIn the late 1970s, Hackman competed in Sports Car Club of America races, driving an open-wheeled Formula Ford. In 1983, he drove a Dan Gurney Team Toyota in the 24 Hours of Daytona Endurance Race. He also won the Long Beach Grand Prix Celebrity Race.\n\nHackman is a fan of the Jacksonville Jaguars and regularly attended Jaguars games as a guest of then head coach Jack Del Rio. Their friendship goes back to Del Rio's playing days at the University of Southern California.\n\nArchitecture and design are another of Hackman’s interests. As of 1990 he had created ten homes, two of which were featured in Architectural Digest. After a period of time, he moves onto another house restoration. “I don't know what's wrong with me,” he remarked, “I guess I like the process, and when it's over, it's over.”\n\nHackman is an active cyclist as of 2018 when he was 88-years old. This is after a 2012 accident, when the then 81-year old Hackman, bicycling in the Florida Keys, was struck by a pickup truck. He made a full recovery.\n\nHealth\n\nIn 1990, Hackman underwent an angioplasty. In 2012, 82-year-old Hackman was struck by a pickup truck while bicycling in the Florida Keys. Although it was initially reported that he had suffered serious head trauma, his publicist stated that his injury was nothing more than \"bumps and bruises\".\n\nFilmography\n\nFilm\n\nYear Title Role Notes 1961 Mad Dog Coll Policeman Uncredited 1964 Lilith Norman 1966 Hawaii John Whipple 1967 Banning Tommy Del Gaddo Community Shelter Planning Donald Ross, Regional Civil Defense Officer Short film Covenant with Death, A Alfred Harmsworth First to Fight Sergeant Tweed Bonnie and Clyde Buck Barrow 1968 Split, The Lieutenant Walter Brill 1969 Riot 'Red' Fraker Gypsy Moths, The Joe Browdy Downhill Racer Eugene Claire Marooned 'Buzz' Lloyd 1970 I Never Sang for My Father Gene Garrison 1971 Doctors' Wives Dave Randolph Hunting Party, The Brandt Ruger French Connection, The NYPD Detective Jimmy 'Popeye' Doyle 1972 Prime Cut Mary Ann Poseidon Adventure, The Reverend Frank Scott Cisco Pike Sergeant Leo Holland 1973 Scarecrow Max Millan 1974 Conversation, The Harry Caul Young Frankenstein Harold, The Blind Man Zandy's Bride Zandy Allan 1975 French Connection II NYPD Detective Jimmy 'Popeye' Doyle Lucky Lady Kibby Womack Night Moves Harry Moseby Bite the Bullet Sam Clayton 1977 Domino Principle, The Roy Tucker Bridge Too Far, A Major General Stanisław Sosabowski March or Die Major William Sherman Foster 1978 Superman Lex Luthor 1980 Superman II 1981 All Night Long George Dupler Reds Pete Van Wherry 1983 Under Fire Alex Grazier Two of a Kind God Voice, uncredited Uncommon Valor Colonel Jason Rhodes, USMC (Ret.)
