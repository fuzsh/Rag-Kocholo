        "text": "AKA Eugene Allen Hackman\n\nBorn: 30-Jan-1930\n\nBirthplace: San Bernardino, CA\n\nGender: Male\n\nRace or Ethnicity: White\n\nSexual orientation: Straight\n\nOccupation: Actor\n\nNationality: United States\n\nExecutive summary: The Conversation\n\nMilitary service: US Marine Corps (1946-49)\n\nGene Hackman made his name playing tough guys, spies, and smooth villains, and won Oscars playing the drug warrior Popeye Doyle in The French Connection and the sadistic, smiling sheriff in Unforgiven with Clint Eastwood.\n\nHackman's father abandoned the family when he was 12, and his mother was an alcoholic, leaving their son to be raised mostly by his maternal grandmother. He was briefly jailed as a juvenile for shoplifting, then dropped out of school, ran away at 16 and, lying about his age, joined the Marines. After his tour of duty, he used the GI Bill to study journalism and TV production, and worked as a radio announcer, shoe salesman, and truck driver until, reassessing his life as his 30th birthday approached, he decided to try becoming an actor.\n\nHe enrolled for acting classes, became fast friends and eventually roomed with classmate Dustin Hoffman, and soon found a few stage and television roles. In his first, brief screen appearance, he played a policeman in 1961's Mad Dog Coll with Jerry Orbach. He made his Broadway debut opposite Peggy Cass in Children From Their Games, which closed two days after it opened, but by the mid-1960s he was working steadily in a succession of Broadway plays. His first substantial film role was in the drama of mental illness Lilith with Jean Seberg and Warren Beatty, and his first critical acclaim came with his Oscar-nominated role as Beatty's brother in Bonnie and Clyde.\n\nAmong his other famous roles, he played the bug-master in The Conversation with John Cazale, the ordinary hero of the cheesy Poseidon Adventure with Shelley Winters, a campy Lex Luthor in Superman with Christopher Reeve, the perfect high school basketball coach in Hoosiers with Barbara Hershey, the sly Secretary of Defense in No Way Out with Kevin Costner, an untalented filmmaker in Get Shorty with John Travolta, a rogue spy in Enemy of the State with Will Smith, and the patriarch of a wildly dysfunctional family in The Royal Tenenbaums with Owen Wilson. Now semi-retired, Hackman's last film was the rather embarrassing Welcome to Mooseport with Ray Romano. Working with archeologist Daniel Lenihan, Hackman has co-written a few novels.\n\nIn 2001, Hackman was involved in a very minor fender-bender in Los Angeles. Witnesses said that when the two drivers emerged from their cars to exchange information, the driver of the other vehicle was belligerent, and became more and more angry over several minutes, finally shoving the 71-year-old Hackman. According to the police report, Hackman responded by pummeling the other driver with a half-dozen blows before the two men were restrained. No charges were filed.\n\nHis mother burned to death in 1962 when, drunk and smoking in bed, she fell asleep and her cigarette ignited the mattress.\n\nFather: Eugene Ezra Hackman (newspaper pressman)\n\nMother: Lyda Gray\n\nBrother: Richard Hackman (b. 1942)\n\nWife: Fay Maltese (bank clerk, dated 1953-56, m. 1-Jan-1956, sep. 1982, div. 1986, two daughters, one son)\n\nDaughter: Elizabeth Hackman\n\nSon: Christopher Hackman (b. 1960)\n\nDaughter: Leslie Hackman\n\nWife: Betsy Arakawa (health club worker, cohabited 1984-91, m. Dec-1991)\n\nUniversity: Journalism, University of Illinois\n\nConservatory: Art Students League of New York\n\nHoward Johnson Times Square\n\nOscar for Best Actor 1972 for The French Connection\n\nOscar for Best Supporting Actor 1993 for Unforgiven\n\nGolden Globe 1972 for The French Connection\n\nGolden Globe 1993 for Unforgiven\n\nGolden Globe 2002 for The Royal Tenenbaums\n\nHeart Attack 1990\n\nAngioplasty 1990\n\nFILMOGRAPHY AS ACTOR\n\nBirth of the Living Dead (18-Oct-2013) · Himself\n\nI Knew It Was You: Rediscovering John Cazale (16-Jan-2009) · Himself\n\nWelcome to Mooseport (20-Feb-2004) · Monroe\n\nRunaway Jury (9-Oct-2003) · Rankin Fitch\n\nBehind Enemy Lines (17-Nov-2001)\n\nThe Royal Tenenbaums (5-Oct-2001)\n\nHeist (10-Sep-2001) · Joe Moore\n\nHeartbreakers (23-Mar-2001)\n\nThe Replacements (7-Aug-2000)\n\nUnder Suspicion (11-May-2000) · Henry Hearst\n\nHitchcock, Selznick and the End of Hollywood (Jan-1999) · Himself [VOICE]\n\nEnemy of the State (16-Nov-1998) · Edward \"Brill\" Lyle\n\nAntz (19-Sep-1998) · Mandible [VOICE]\n\nTwilight (6-Mar-1998) · Jack Ames\n\nAbsolute Power (14-Feb-1997) · President Richmond\n\nExtreme Measures (27-Sep-1996) · Dr. Lawrence Myrick\n\nThe Birdcage (8-Mar-1996) · Sen.
