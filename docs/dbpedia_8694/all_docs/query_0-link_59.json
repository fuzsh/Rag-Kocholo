        "text": "The fame that comes with being in movies is not something that all actors are able to cope with in the same way.\n\nThis is especially true when they reach a certain age and their public appearances become increasingly rare.\n\nOne of the most important and recognizable actors of the last 50 years on the big screen is Gene Hackman.\n\nAt the age of 93, the actor has not been seen in public since 2004, when he presented the film 'Welcome to Mooseport', his last film appearance to date.\n\nUnexpected appearance\n\nHackman, who has not been heard from for nearly two decades, is living quietly and out of the public eye.\n\nHis hard-earned retirement, thanks to a multitude of successful films such as 'Unforgiven', 'The French Connection' and the Oscar-winning 'Mississippi Burning' saw him refuse to appear in any public media.\n\nEven fewer people knew where the actor lived. However, during the week of the Oscars and when his name has come up as one of the possible actors to take the stage to present a statuette in place of Will Smith, he has been photographed by the New York Post.\n\nThe actor was pictured in his vehicle while filling up at a gas station in Santa Fe, New Mexico, the city where he lives.\n\nIn the same sequence of photos, you can see how, after filling up his car, he then decided to purchase some food.\n\nThe legendary actor went to a Wendy's restaurant to enjoy a chicken sandwich.\n\nSince Gene Hackman was last seen, his only public appearance was in 2008.\n\nAt that time, the actor announced that he was stepping down from the stage and from any kind of film or television appearances in order to focus, at full capacity, on his literary career.\n\nSuccess came to him in film at a very early age with numerous appearances in a multitude of films (the first was 'Mad Dog Coll' in 1961), although the real accolades from the American film Academy came when he won his two Oscars.\n\nThe first came in 1971 for his work in 'The French Connection' and the second when he was awarded the statuette for his role as best supporting actor in Clint Eastwood's 1993 Best Picture, 'Unforgiven'."
