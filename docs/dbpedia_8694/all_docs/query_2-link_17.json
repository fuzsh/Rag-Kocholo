        "text": "Legendary actor Gene Hackman, known for his iconic roles in films like The French Connection and Unforgiven, was recently spotted out and about in Santa Fe, New Mexico. The 93-year-old actor, who has not starred in a film for nearly two decades, was seen doing yard work at his ranch with a shovel in hand, looking healthy and in great shape.\n\nAfter his yard work, the movie legend was spotted at a Wendy's drive-thru in his white truck, enjoying a fast food lunch in the parking lot. This rare sighting of the star has fans reminiscing about his incredible career in Hollywood.\n\nHackman began his acting career almost 70 years ago, joining the Pasadena Playhouse in 1956. It was there where he befriended fellow aspiring actor Dustin Hoffman. Hackman moved to New York in 1963 and began performing in several Off-Broadway plays and smaller TV roles.\n\nHe eventually made his name in the 1970s, with his Oscar-nominated performance in the film I Never Sang For My Father and his Academy Award-winning role in The French Connection. Hackman went on to have consistent work throughout the 1970s and 1980s, starring in iconic films like The Poseidon Adventure, The Conversation, Superman: The Movie, Reds, and Mississippi Burning.\n\nIn the 1990s, he won his second Oscar for Best Supporting Actor in Unforgiven, and continued to star in notable films like The Firm, Wyatt Earp, The Birdcage, and Enemy Of The State.\n\nHe retired from acting in 2008\n\nDespite his incredible success, Hackman retired from acting in 2008 after promoting his third novel, Escape From Andersonville. In a rare interview with Larry King in 2004, he announced that he had no new film projects lined up and believed his acting career was over.\n\nHowever, when asked by GQ in 2011 if he would ever come out of retirement for one more film, Hackman responded, \"If I could do it in my own house, maybe, without them disturbing anything and just one or two people.\"\n\nHackman's contributions to Hollywood and the film industry have made him a legend in his own right, with over 100 credits to his name. He is one of the last living Hollywood legends and his recent sighting has brought him back to the spotlight, reminding fans of his incredible acting career."
