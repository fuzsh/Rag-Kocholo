        "text": "Stax here with a special birthday tribute to Gene Hackman! The two-time Academy Award-winning actor turns 73 years old today. In honor of this occasion, I'd like to spotlight some of my favorite performances by Gene Hackman:\n\nSuperman: The Movie, 1978, dir. Richard Donner; and Superman II, 1980, dir. Richard Lester. These two movies from my childhood are the films that introduced me to Gene Hackman. Along with Marlon Brando, Hackman was the other \"big name\" in Warner Brothers' first big-screen take on the Man of Steel (Christopher Reeve). As Superman's diabolical yet droll nemesis, evil genius Lex Luthor, Hackman sneered, smirked and schemed his way through what would eventually be three Superman films (the less said about Superman IV: The Quest for Peace, though, the better). Purists may still be peeved that Hackman's Luthor wasn't quite like his comic book counterpart but for a generation of filmgoers Hackman IS Lex Luthor.\n\nUnforgiven, 1992, dir. Clint Eastwood. Unforgiven is Clint's Oscar-winning Western ponders the consequences of violence and is a somber reflection on his own bloodsoaked cinematic legacy. William Munny (Eastwood) was a murderous outlaw until his (now deceased) wife cured him \"of drink and wickedness.\" Now an unsuccessful farmer caring for two children, Will reluctantly agrees to pick up his guns again in order to collect a bounty on a pair of cowpokes who disfigured a prostitute in the town of Big Whiskey. Will is accompanied on his mission by his old saddlepal Ned (Morgan Freeman) and the cocky 'Schofield Kid' (Jaimz Woolvett).\n\nWill returns to his former ultra-violent ways after the sheriff of Big Whiskey, Little Bill Daggett (Hackman, in his second Oscar-winning role), kills Ned and beats the hell out of Will. Needless to say, William Munny shows Big Whiskey why he was once such a feared man when he finally confronts Little Bill and his goons. Richard Harris shines as foppish hired gun \"English Bob\" who happens to be an old foe of Little Bill's. English Bob, like Will, is beaten to a pulp by Bill (who snidely calls him \"The Duck of Death\" rather than \"The Duke of Death\").\n\nPrime Cut, 1972, dir. Michael Ritchie. The indomitable Lee Marvin plays Nick, an enforcer for the Irish mob in Chicago. Nick's sent down to the boonies of Kansas to investigate the disappearance of one of his associates. This gangster had been sent to Kansas City to deal with a mobbed-up farmer named \"Mary Ann\" (Hackman). Mary Ann runs a slaughterhouse and, well, that missing associate ended up being ground into sausage! (And you wondered what those ballpark franks were made of.)\n\nMary Ann and his equally nasty brother also run a sex slave/prostitution ring out of this slaughterhouse, pimping out drugged-up runaways like Sissy Spacek (in her film debut). Naturally, Nick ends up in a violent conflict with Mary Ann and his rednecks, and tries to save Sissy Spacek's character along the way.\n\nThe French Connection, 1971, dir. William Friedkin. It's been thirty years since this seminal police procedural was released but its influence remains strong (watch this to see where TV series like NYPD Blue and Law & Order derive their visual sensibilities from). This fact-based tale follows NYPD narcs \"Popeye\" Doyle (Hackman's first Oscar-winning role) and Buddy Russo (Roy Scheider) as they methodically hunt down a French crimelord (Fernando Rey) and his stateside Mafia accomplices (including movie mobster-for-life Tony Lo Bianco). This Best Picture-winner boasts compelling characters, an engrossing story, and still-exciting action sequences (including a legendary car chase). This film remains a tribute to the hard-living street cops and their often lonely war against crime.\n\nThe Royal Tenenbaums, 2001, wr/dir. Wes Anderson. This clever and witty tale is about how a family of geniuses, the Tenenbaums, are reunited in order to deal with the return of their patriarch, the obnoxious (disbarred) attorney Royal Tenenbaum (Hackman). Having long been shunned by his family for his callous and patronizing manner, Royal returns home with tragic news: he's been diagnosed with stomach cancer and has only six weeks to live. With his time running out, Royal tries atoning for his past failings as a husband and father and hopes to forge new friendships with his family. But will the other Tenenbaums bury the hatchet? And is there more to Royal's return than just his illness? The cast includes Gwyneth Paltrow, Ben Stiller, Anjelica Huston, Danny Glover, Luke and Owen Wilson, and Bill Murray.\n\nUnder Fire, 1983, dir. Roger Spottiswoode. This hard-hitting drama covers war-torn Central America in the late 1970s/early 1980s. Photographer Russell Price (Nick Nolte) compromises his ethics when he photographs a dead Nicaraguan rebel leader in a ruse to make the world think that he's still alive. At first, Price is almost as mercenary as Oates (Ed Harris), an American soldier of fortune whose path has crossed Russell's before. He eventually takes sides in the conflict and carries on an affair with fellow journalist Claire (Joanna Cassidy), who is also the ex-lover of hotshot network newsman Alex Grazier (Hackman). Russell and Claire must evade the military after their neutrality becomes questionable.\n\nGeronimo, 1993, dir. Walter Hill. This lavishly produced, well-intentioned biopic of the fierce Apache leader was co-written by John Milius and Larry Gross. Its biggest mistake was to make its title character a supporting player. Instead, Geronimo follows U.S. cavalry officers Charles Gatewood (Jason Patric) and Britton Davis (Matt Damon) and, quite frankly, they're just not as compelling as the renegade Apache (Wes Studi). Gene Hackman plays General Crook who struggles to understand Geronimo even as he tries to conquer him. Robert Duvall is famed scout Al Sieber who employs Apaches to hunt down other Apaches. Despite its shortcomings, Geronimo tells an important story from a dark chapter in American history.\n\nNo Way Out, 1987, dir. Roger Donaldson. Kevin Costner, Gene Hackman, and Sean Young star in this loose remake of the Noir classic, The Big Clock. Costner, a Navy hero assigned to the Pentagon, is having a fling with an amorous D.C. socialite (Young). When she's killed by her other lover, who happens to be the Secretary of Defense (Hackman), Costner realizes he'll become the prime suspect in her murder if their affair is uncovered. Hackman and his insanely devoted aide (Will Patton) concoct an alibi that blames Young's murder on a near mythic Soviet mole allegedly operating within the Pentagon.\n\nWhat they set in motion, however, proves that this Soviet mole actually exists and that he's much closer to them than they realize. Costner's character investigates Young's death while also shielding himself from suspicion. The film's ending is still shocking and memorable.\n\nCrimson Tide, 1995, dir. Tony Scott. Essentially Mutiny on the Bounty set onboard a nuclear sub, I thought this entertaining thriller was crassly sold as a blatant rip-off of The Hunt for Red October. Denzel Washington plays Lt. Commander Hunter, the stalwart first officer of the USS Alabama, which is commanded by the stern Capt. Ramsey (Hackman). Needless to say, their relationship deteriorates to the point where Hunter is forced to try and take over the vessel from Ramsey after it appears that Russian rebels are preparing to nuke the U.S. There was so much that I enjoyed about this intense military thriller that I couldn't help but be disappointed by two very unnerving elements.\n\nThe first is the all too obvious script doctoring performed by Quentin Tarantino; the glib dialogue about comic books draws far too much attention to itself. My other grievance is when Capt. Ramsey uses the \"N word\" during the climax. The film suddenly introduces racism into the mix, transforming Ramsey from a seasoned but unyielding military man into a bigoted nutcase. I liked Crimson Tide better when it was the procedural and attitude differences that put Hunter and Ramsey at odds. Viggo Mortensen and James Gandolfini co-star.\n\nNight Moves, 1975, dir. Arthur Penn. Gene Hackman plays Harry Moseby, a private eye who accepts the task of locating an aging Hollywood starlet's (Janet Ward) spoiled daughter (Melanie Griffith) who has run away. Harry takes this seemingly easy gig in order to escape marital strife (wife Susan Clark is two-timing him). Harry's investigation leads him to the Florida Keys and to the realization that there's far more going on here than some little rich girl who flew the coop. Harry soon finds himself ensnared in a web of murder and corruption. Night Moves, one of the most unappreciated films of the 1970s, helped re-define the detective genre along with Chinatown and The Long Goodbye. Hackman recently appeared in Twilight, which borrowed many elements from this film.\n\nMississippi Burning, 1988, dir. Alan Parker. This still-controversial Oscar-nominated film stars Gene Hackman as a no-nonsense Southern career FBI agent and Willem Dafoe as his by-the-book partner. They're investigating the disappearance (and murder) of three civil rights activists in a brutally racist Mississippi town. Their investigation leads them to the KKK and to the town sheriff's wife (Frances McDormand) who knows more than she can reveal.\n\nCritics slammed Mississippi Burning for altering history and for making white FBI agents the heroes of the story when it is well known that J. Edgar Hoover despised blacks (and Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., in particular). Critics also fault the film for portraying black people as too scared and helpless to defend themselves, and for casting white Southerners in a stereotypical light. Admirers of the film credit the performances of its cast and its visceral depiction of one of America's worst times.\n\nThe Conversation, 1974, dir. Francis Ford Coppola. This \"lost classic\" features what is arguably Gene Hackman's best screen performance to date. Hackman brilliantly underplays his role as withdrawn, paranoid surveillance expert Harry Caul who is hired to tape a conversation between a seemingly benign couple (Cindy Williams and Frederic Forrest) that soon sounds like a murder plot. Fearing that his enigmatic corporate benefactor, \"The Director\" (Robert Duvall), will kill this young couple, Caul becomes conflicted and refuses to hand over his tapes to the Director. The truth, however, is not quite what it seems. Hackman would reprise this role (sort of) in Enemy of the State.\n\nTell me what your favorite Gene Hackman films are. – STAX\n\nSEND ME YOUR FEEDBACK!\n\nMore Stax Reports"
