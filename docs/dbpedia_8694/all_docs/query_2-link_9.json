        "text": "During an acting career spanning six decades, Gene Hackman played an astonishing range of movie roles, from a renegade preacher in \"The Poseidon Adventure\" to a privacy-obsessed surveillance expert in \"The Conversation\" to a blind hermit in \"Young Frankenstein\" to supervillain Lex Luthor in \"Superman: The Movie.\"\n\nHe was nominated for five Oscars and won two — for his portrayals of rough-hewn police Detective Jimmy “Popeye” Doyle in 1971’s \"The French Connection\" and Little Bill Daggett, the sadistic sheriff and main antagonist in Clint Eastwood’s 1992 western \"Unforgiven.\"\n\nHackman’s acceptance speech for the latter was brief, and he concluded it by saying, “I’d like to dedicate my part of this evening to my uncle Orin Hackman. He was a wonderful guy.”\n\nHis full name was William Orin Hackman, and he was known as William O. Hackman to readers of the Democrat and Chronicle, where he worked as a reporter and editor from the early-1950s to 1970.\n\nBackstage at the 1993 Oscars, an emotional Gene Hackman spoke further about his uncle, who died at age 88 the evening before the ceremony.\n\n“He died last night … and I just found out,” the actor said, according to Variety. “He was an interesting newspaperman out of Rochester, New York. Also a painter, sculptor. He did have some influence on me early on.”\n\nOriginally from Rossville, Illinois, William O. Hackman was a resident of Bradenton, Florida, at the time of his death. He wasn’t the only newsman in the Hackman family. Gene Hackman’s grandfather was a reporter, and his father was a pressman. Hackman himself, who grew up in Danville, Illinois, studied journalism at the University of Illinois before leaving it to pursue acting in Los Angeles and New York City.\n\nA search of the Democrat and Chronicle archives reveals that during his career here, William O. Hackman covered a variety of topics, from religion to finance, and oversaw election-night vote tabulations. He even did some spot news, reporting on a 1965 house fire in Dansville, Livingston County, a few miles from his home in neighboring Sparta.\n\nThe archives also include accounts of his artistic pursuits. A May 9, 1953, feature about the prestigious Rochester-Finger Lakes Exhibition at the Memorial Art Gallery reported that Hackman, then 47, won the Pike Stained Glass Studio prize for an outstanding work of art having religious content, a “sensitively carved piece of sculpture” titled \"Applewood Madonna.\"\n\n“Hackman before last year had not tried anything in the arts, suddenly discovered latent talent, enrolled in the Memorial’s classes, and had his first work accepted for last year’s show,” the story stated.\n\nAt one point, the late-blooming amateur artist wondered whether his creatively driven nephew would be able to make a go of it in show business. Indeed, Gene Hackman’s big break did not come until he was 37 and cast as Buck, brother of Clyde Barrow (Warren Beatty), in 1967’s \"Bonnie and Clyde.\"\n\n“I remember one time he met me in New York when I was still struggling,” Hackman told reporters at the ’93 Oscars, recalling a conversation with his uncle, “and he said, ‘You know, you should have something else’ — like a regular job.”"
