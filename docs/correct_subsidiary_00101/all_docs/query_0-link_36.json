As a result, we are mailing to our stockholders a notice instead of a paper copy of this proxy statement and our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2007 (Annual Report). The notice contains instructions on how to access those documents over the Internet. The notice also contains instructions on how each stockholder can receive a paper copy of our proxy materials, including this notice and proxy statement, our Annual Report and a form of proxy card or voting instruction card. We believe that this new process will conserve natural resources and reduce the costs of printing and distributing our proxy materials.\n\nIt is important that you use this opportunity to take part in the affairs of VeriSign by voting on the business to come before this meeting. WHETHER OR NOT YOU EXPECT TO ATTEND THE MEETING, PLEASE COMPLETE, DATE, SIGN AND PROMPTLY RETURN THE ACCOMPANYING PROXY IN THE ENCLOSED POSTAGE-PAID ENVELOPE SO THAT YOUR SHARES MAY BE REPRESENTED AT THE MEETING.

Only holders of record of our common stock at the close of business on March 31, 2008, which is the record date, will be entitled to vote at the Meeting. At the close of business on the record date, we had 194,428,020 shares of common stock outstanding and entitled to vote. This proxy statement and the accompanying form of proxy (collectively, the Proxy Statement) were first made available to stockholders on or about April 15, 2008. Our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2007 (the Annual Report) is enclosed with this Proxy Statement.\n\nAll proxies will be voted in accordance with the instructions contained therein. Unless contrary instructions are specified, if the accompanying proxy is executed and returned (and not revoked) prior to the Meeting, the shares of VeriSign common stock represented by the proxy will be voted: (1) FOR the election of each of the six director candidates nominated by the Board; (2) FOR the ratification of the selection of KPMG LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2008 (fiscal 2008); and (3) in accordance with the best judgment of the named proxies on any other matters properly brought before the Meeting.\n\nAdoption of Majority Vote Standard in Uncontested Director Elections\n\nOn February 20, 2008, our Board approved amendments to VeriSigns Second Amended and Restated Bylaws to change the vote standard for the election of directors from a plurality of votes cast to a majority of votes cast in uncontested elections. A majority of the votes cast means that the number of shares voted for a director must exceed the number of votes cast withheld for that director. In contested elections where the number of nominees exceeds the number of directors to be elected, the vote standard will continue to be a plurality of votes cast. In addition, if a nominee who already serves as a director is not elected, the director shall tender his or her resignation, subject to acceptance by the Board. The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee will make a recommendation to the Board on whether to accept or reject the resignation, or whether other action should be taken. The Board will act on the Committees recommendation and publicly disclose its decision and the rationale behind it within 90 days from the date of the certification of the election results. The director who tenders his or her resignation will not participate in the Boards decision. If the failure of a nominee to be elected at the annual meeting results in a vacancy on the Board, that vacancy can be filled by action of the Board.\n\nVoting Rights\n\nHolders of our common stock are entitled to one vote for each share held as of the record date.\n\n1\n\nTable of Contents\n\nQuorum, Effect of Abstentions and Broker Non-Votes, Vote Required to Approve the Proposals\n\nA majority of the outstanding shares of common stock must be present or represented by proxy at the Meeting in order to have a quorum. Abstentions and broker non-votes will be treated as shares present for the purpose of determining the presence of a quorum for the transaction of business at the Meeting. A broker non-vote occurs when a bank, broker or other stockholder of record holding shares for a beneficial owner submits a proxy for the meeting, but does not vote on a particular proposal because that holder does not have discretionary voting power with respect to that proposal and has not received instructions from the beneficial owner.\n\nIf a quorum is present, a nominee for election to a position on the Board will be elected as a director if the votes cast for the election of the nominee exceed the votes cast as withheld for that nominee. The following will not be votes cast and will have no effect on the election of any director nominee: (i) a share whose ballot is marked as abstain; (ii) a share otherwise present at the meeting but for which there is an abstention; and (iii) a share otherwise present at the meeting as to which a shareholder gives no authority or direction. Stockholders may not cumulate votes in the election of directors.\n\nIf a quorum is present, approvals of the proposal to ratify the selection of KPMG LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for fiscal 2008 and all other matters that properly come before the Meeting require that the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of common stock present or represented by proxy and entitled to vote on the subject matter. Abstentions and broker non-votes could prevent approval of such proposals if the number of affirmative votes, though a majority of the votes represented and cast, does not constitute a majority of the shares of common stock present or represented by proxy and entitled to vote on the subject matter. The inspector of elections appointed for the Meeting will separately tabulate affirmative and withheld votes, abstentions and broker non-votes.\n\nAdjournment of Meeting\n\nIn the event that sufficient votes in favor of the proposals are not received by the date of the Meeting, the persons named as proxies may propose one or more adjournments of the Meeting to permit further solicitations of proxies. Any such adjournment would require the affirmative vote of the majority of the outstanding shares present in person or represented by proxy at the Meeting.\n\nExpenses of Soliciting Proxies\n\nVeriSign will pay the expenses of soliciting proxies to be voted at the Meeting. Following the original mailing of the proxies and other soliciting materials, we and/or our agents may also solicit proxies by mail, telephone, telegraph, or in person. Following the original mailing of the proxies and other soliciting materials, we will request that brokers, custodians, nominees and other record holders of our shares forward copies of the proxy and other soliciting materials to persons for whom they hold shares and request authority for the exercise of proxies. In such cases, we will reimburse the record holders for their reasonable expenses if they ask us to do so.\n\nRevocability of Proxies\n\nAny person signing a proxy in the form accompanying this Proxy Statement has the power to revoke it prior to the Meeting or at the Meeting prior to the vote pursuant to the proxy. A proxy may be revoked by any of the following methods:\n\n2\n\nTable of Contents\n\nPlease note, however, that if a stockholders shares are held of record by a broker, bank or other nominee, and that stockholder wishes to vote at the Meeting, the stockholder must bring to the Meeting a letter from the broker, bank or other nominee confirming that stockholders beneficial ownership of the shares.\n\nInternet and Telephone Voting\n\nIf you hold shares of record as a registered shareholder, you can simplify your voting process and save the company expense by voting your shares by telephone at 1-800-690-6903 or on the Internet at www.proxyvote.com twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week. Telephone and Internet voting are available through 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time the day prior to the Meeting. More information regarding telephone and Internet voting is given on the proxy card. If you hold shares through a bank or brokerage firm, the bank or brokerage firm will provide you with separate instructions on a form you will receive from them. Many such firms make telephone or Internet voting available, but the specific processes available will depend on those firms individual arrangements.\n\nHouseholding\n\nVeriSign has adopted a procedure called householding, which has been approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC). Under this procedure, VeriSign is delivering only one copy of the Annual Report and Proxy Statement to multiple stockholders who share the same address and have the same last name, unless VeriSign has received contrary instructions from an affected stockholder. This procedure reduces VeriSigns printing costs, mailing costs and fees. Stockholders who participate in householding will continue to receive separate proxy cards.\n\nVeriSign will deliver promptly upon written or oral request a separate copy of the Annual Report and the Proxy Statement to any stockholder at a shared address to which a single copy of either of those documents was delivered. To receive a separate copy of the Annual Report or Proxy Statement, you may write or call VeriSigns Investor Relations Department at VeriSign, Inc., 487 East Middlefield Road, Mountain View, California 94043-4047, Attention: Investor Relations, telephone (866) 447-8776 (4IR-VRSN). You may also access VeriSigns Annual Report and Proxy Statement on the Investor Relations section of VeriSigns Website at http://investor.verisign.com.\n\nIf you are a holder of record and would like to revoke your householding consent and receive a separate copy of the Annual Report or Proxy Statement in the future, please contact Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. (Broadridge), either by calling toll free at (800) 542-1061 or by writing to Broadridge, Householding Department, 51 Mercedes Way, Edgewood, New York 11717. You will be removed from the householding program within thirty (30) days of receipt of the revocation of your consent.\n\nAny stockholders of record who share the same address and currently receive multiple copies of VeriSigns Annual Report and Proxy Statement who wish to receive only one copy of these materials per household in the future, please contact VeriSigns Investor Relations Department at the address or telephone number listed above to participate in the householding program.\n\nA number of brokerage firms have instituted householding. If you hold your shares in street name, please contact your bank, broker or other holder of record to request information about householding.\n\n3\n\nTable of Contents\n\nPROPOSAL NO. 1\n\nELECTION OF DIRECTORS\n\nOur Third Amended and Restated Bylaws authorize eleven directors; there are currently nine directors.

William A. Roper, Jr., a director, was appointed President and Chief Executive Officer of VeriSign on May 27, 2007. As an employee of the Company, Mr. Roper no longer participates in the compensation program for non-employee directors. Mr. Roper has been compensated as an executive officer of the Company since May 27, 2007 and his compensation both as a non-employee director and an employee is described in Executive Compensation elsewhere in this proxy statement.\n\nNon-Employee Director Meeting Fees and Retainer Information\n\nDuring 2007, cash fees earned by non-employee directors were as follows:\n\nNon-employee directors are reimbursed for their expenses in attending meetings.\n\nOn August 7, 2007, the Compensation Committee met to consider the cash and equity-based compensation to be paid to non-employee directors. The Compensation Committee reviewed competitive market data prepared by Frederick W. Cook & Co. (FW Cook) for the same comparator group used to benchmark executive compensation and certain available information for other boards and reviewed the board compensation practices of these companies. Following this review and consideration of the recommendations made by FW Cook, the Compensation Committee determined that grants equal to $200,000 worth of annual equity awards split evenly between stock options and restricted stock units (RSUs) were in the best interest of VeriSign and its shareholders. With input from FW Cook, members of the Companys management and other directors of the Company, the Compensation Committee also approved an increase in the amount of the annual retainer payable to non-employee directors from $37,500 to $40,000. In addition, after consideration of materials and recommendations from FW Cook, the Compensation Committee approved effective as of May 27, 2007, an additional annual retainer of $100,000 for the non-executive Chairman of the Board.

The Board consults with our legal counsel to ensure that the Boards determinations are consistent with all relevant securities and other laws and regulations regarding the definition of independent, including those set forth in pertinent listing standards of the NASDAQ Stock Market.\n\nConsistent with these considerations, after review of all relevant transactions and relationships between each director, or any of his or her family members, and VeriSign, our executive officers and our independent registered public accounting firm, the Board affirmatively determined on February 20, 2008 that the majority of our Board is comprised of independent directors. Our independent directors are: Mr. Bidzos, Mr. Chenevich, Ms. Cote, Mr. Kriens, Mr. Roach, Mr. Simpson, and Mr. Tomlinson. Each director who serves on the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee and the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee is an independent director. The Board is currently reviewing Mr. Bidzoss independent director status following his election as representative director of one of our majority-owned subsidiaries, VeriSign Japan K.K. on March 21, 2008. Mr. Bidzos will not be compensated in this interim role, though he may perform executive functions while he assists the Company in transitioning to new management. Edward A. Mueller served as Chairman of the Board until his resignation on August 15, 2007. Stratton D. Sclavos served as a director until his resignation on May 27, 2007. Michelle Guthrie served as a director until her resignation on February 20, 2008.\n\nBoard and Committee Meetings\n\nThe Board met nine times and its committees collectively met twenty-seven times during 2007. No director during the last fiscal year attended fewer than 75% of the aggregate of (i) the total number of meetings held by the Board and (ii) the total number of meetings held by all committees on which he or she served during 2007.\n\nBoard Members Attendance at the Annual Meeting\n\nAlthough we do not have a formal policy regarding attendance by members of the Board at our annual meeting of the stockholders, we encourage directors to attend. Two members of the Board attended our 2007 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.\n\nCorporate Governance and Nominating Committee\n\nThe Board has established a Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee to recruit, evaluate, and nominate candidates for appointment or election to serve as members of the Board, recommend nominees for committees of the Board, recommend corporate governance policies and periodically review and assess the adequacy of these policies, and review annually the performance of the Board. The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee is currently composed of Messrs. Bidzos and Kriens, each of whom, pending the Boards review in the case of Mr. Bidzos, has been determined by the Board to be an independent director under the rules of The NASDAQ Stock Market. The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee operates pursuant to a written charter. The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committees charter is located on our Website at http://investor.verisign.com/documentdisplay.cfm?DocumentID=547. The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee met four times during 2007.\n\nIn carrying out its function to nominate candidates for election to the Board, the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee considers the performance and qualifications of each potential nominee or candidate, not only for his or her individual strengths but also for his or her contribution to the Board as a group.\n\n9\n\nTable of Contents\n\nThe Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee considers candidates for director nominees proposed by directors, the chief executive officer and stockholders. The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee may also from time to time retain one or more third-party search firms to identify suitable candidates.\n\nIf you would like the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee to consider a prospective candidate, in accordance with our Bylaws, please submit the candidates name and qualifications to: Richard H. Goshorn, Secretary, VeriSign, Inc., 21351 Ridgetop Circle, Dulles, Virginia 20166.\n\nThe Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee will consider all candidates identified through the processes described above, and will evaluate each of them, including incumbents and candidates nominated by stockholders, based on the same criteria.\n\nAudit Committee\n\nThe Board has established an Audit Committee that oversees the accounting and financial reporting processes at the Company, internal control over financial reporting, audits of the Companys financial statements, the qualifications of the Companys independent auditor, and the performance of the Companys internal audit department and the independent auditor. The independent auditor reports directly to the Audit Committee and the Audit Committee is responsible for the appointment (subject to shareholder ratification), compensation and retention of the independent auditor. The Audit Committee also oversees the Companys processes to manage business and financial risk, and compliance with significant applicable legal and regulatory requirements, and oversees the Companys ethics and compliance programs. The Audit Committee is currently composed of Messrs. Chenevich and Roach and Ms. Cote. Each member of the Audit Committee meets the independence criteria of The NASDAQ Stock Market and the SEC. Each Audit Committee member meets The NASDAQ Stock Markets financial knowledge requirements, and the Board has determined that Mr. Roach is financially sophisticated, as such term is defined in Rule 4350(d)(2)(A) of The NASDAQ Stock Market. The Audit Committee operates pursuant to a written charter, which complies with the applicable provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and related rules of the SEC and The NASDAQ Stock Market. A copy of the Audit Committee charter is set forth as Appendix A to this Proxy Statement and is located on our Website at http://investor.verisign.com/documentdisplay.cfm?DocumentID=544. The Audit Committee met twelve times during 2007.\n\nAudit Committee Financial Expert\n\nOur Board has determined that John D. Roach is an audit committee financial expert as such term is defined in Item 407(d)(5) of Regulation S-K of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act). Mr. Roach meets the independence requirements for audit committee members as defined in the applicable listing standards of the NASDAQ Stock Market.\n\nReport of the Audit Committee\n\nThe information contained in this report shall not be deemed to be soliciting material or filed with the SEC or subject to the liabilities of Section 18 of the Exchange Act, except to the extent that VeriSign specifically incorporates it by reference into a document filed under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act) or the Exchange Act.\n\nThe Audit Committee is composed of three non-management directors who meet the independence and experience requirements of The NASDAQ Stock Market. The Audit Committee operates under a written charter adopted by the Board. The members of the Audit Committee are Messrs. Chenevich (Chairperson) and Roach and Ms. Cote.\n\nManagement is responsible for the preparation, presentation and integrity of VeriSigns financial statements, accounting and financial reporting principles and internal controls and procedures designed to assure compliance with accounting standards and applicable laws and regulations. The independent registered public accounting\n\n10\n\nTable of Contents\n\nfirm, KPMG LLP, is responsible for performing an independent audit of VeriSigns consolidated financial statements in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America and for issuing a report thereon. The Audit Committee is responsible for oversight of our financial, accounting and reporting processes and our compliance with legal and regulatory requirements. The Audit Committee is also responsible for the appointment, compensation and oversight of our independent registered public accounting firm, which includes reviewing the independent registered public accounting firms independence, reviewing and approving the planned scope of the annual audit, overseeing the independent auditors audit work, reviewing and pre-approving any non-audit services that may be performed by the independent auditors, reviewing with management and the independent auditors the adequacy of our internal financial controls, and reviewing our critical accounting policies and the application of accounting principles.\n\nWe have adopted a policy regarding rotation of the audit partners responsible for the audit of VeriSigns financial statements. No audit partner (as defined under SEC rules) of the public accounting firm providing audit services to VeriSign shall have served as the lead or coordinating audit partner (having primary responsibility for the audit) or as the audit partner responsible for reviewing the audit for more than five consecutive fiscal years.\n\nDuring 2007, at each of our meetings, we met with the senior members of VeriSigns financial management team and our independent registered public accounting firm. We recommended to the Board that KPMG LLP be engaged as VeriSigns independent registered public accounting firm and we reviewed with KPMG LLP the overall audit scope and plans. We met privately with KPMG LLP to discuss the results of the audit, evaluations by the auditors of VeriSigns accounting and internal controls and quality of VeriSigns financial reporting. The Audit Committee met twelve times during 2007.\n\nOur review of the audited financial statements contained in VeriSigns Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2007 included a discussion of the accounting principles, reasonableness of significant judgments, and clarity of disclosures in the financial statements. Management represented to us that VeriSigns consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and we have reviewed and discussed the consolidated financial statements with management and KPMG LLP.\n\nWe discussed with KPMG LLP matters required to be discussed by Statement on Auditing Standards No. 61, Communication with Audit Committees. We also discussed with KPMG LLP their annual written disclosures and letter on their independence from VeriSign and its management, as required by Independent Standards Board Standard No. 1, Independence Discussions with Audit Committees. The Audit Committee has also considered whether the non-audit services provided by KPMG LLP to VeriSign during 2007 are compatible with maintaining the auditors independence.\n\nBased upon our discussions with management and KPMG LLP and our review of the representations of management, and the report of KPMG LLP to the Audit Committee, we recommended to the Board that the audited consolidated financial statements be included in VeriSigns Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2007, for filing with the SEC.\n\nThis report is submitted by the Audit Committee\n\nWilliam L. Chenevich (Chairperson)\n\nKathleen A. Cote\n\nJohn D. Roach\n\nCompensation Committee\n\nThe Board has established a Compensation Committee to discharge the Boards responsibilities with respect to all forms of compensation of the Companys executive officers, to administer the Companys equity incentive plans, and to produce an annual report on executive compensation for use in the Companys proxy statement. The\n\n11\n\nTable of Contents\n\nCompensation Committee is also responsible for approving and evaluating executive officer compensation arrangements, plans, policies and programs of the Company, and for administering the Companys equity incentive plans for employees. The Compensation Committee operates pursuant to a written charter. The Compensation Committees charter is set forth as Appendix B to this Proxy Statement and is located on our Website at http://investor.verisign.com/documentdisplay.cfm?DocumentID=546. The Compensation Committee is currently composed of Messrs. Simpson and Tomlinson, each of whom is an independent director under the rules of The NASDAQ Stock Market, and an outside director pursuant to Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code). The Compensation Committee met eleven times during 2007.

Alternatively, a stockholder may contact the Board by writing to: Board of Directors, VeriSign, Inc., 487 East Middlefield Road, Mountain View, California 94043-4047, Attention: Secretary. Communications received electronically or in writing are distributed to the Chairman of the Board or other members of the Board, as appropriate, depending on the facts and circumstances outlined in the communication received.\n\nLegal Proceedings\n\nOn July 6, 2006, a stockholder derivative complaint (Parnes v. Bidzos, et al., and VeriSign) was filed against the Company, as a nominal defendant, and certain of its current and former directors and executive officers related to certain historical stock option grants. The complaint seeks unspecified damages on behalf of VeriSign, constructive trust and other equitable relief. Two other derivative actions were filed, one in United States District Court for the Northern District of California (Port Authority v. Bidzos, et al., and VeriSign), and one in state court (Port Authority v. Bidzos, et al., and VeriSign) on August 14, 2006. We are named as a nominal defendant in these actions. The federal actions have been consolidated and plaintiffs filed a consolidated complaint on November 20, 2006. Motions to dismiss the consolidated federal court complaint were heard on May 23, 2007. Those motions were granted on September 14, 2007. Motions to stay the state court action are pending. On May 15, 2007, a putative class action (Mykityshyn v. Bidzos, et al., and VeriSign) was filed in Superior Court for the State of California, Santa Clara County naming the Company and certain current and former officers and directors, alleging false representations and disclosure failures regarding certain historical stock option grants. The plaintiff purports to represent all individuals who owned our common stock between April 3, 2002, and August 9, 2006. The complaint seeks rescission of amendments to the 1998 and 2006 Option Plans and the cancellation of shares added to the 1998 Option Plan. The complaint also seeks to enjoin defendants from granting any stock options and from allowing the exercise of any currently outstanding options granted under the 1998 and 2006 Option Plans. The complaint seeks an unspecified amount of compensatory damages, costs and attorneys fees. The identical case was filed in state court under a separate name (Pace. v. Bidzos, et al., and VeriSign) on June 19, 2007, and on October 3, 2007 (Mehdian v. Bidzos, et al.). On December 3, 2007, a consolidated complaint was filed in Superior Court for the State of California, Santa Clara County. VeriSign and the individual defendants dispute all of these claims.\n\nCode of Ethics\n\nWe have adopted a code of ethics that applies to our principal executive officer, principal financial officer and other senior accounting officers. The Code of Ethics for the Chief Executive Officer and Senior Financial Officers is located on our Website at http://investor.verisign.com/documents2.cfm. We intend to satisfy the disclosure requirement under Item 5.05 of Form 8-K regarding any amendment to, or waiver from, a provision of this code of ethics by posting such information on our Website, at the address and location specified above.\n\n12\n\nTable of Contents\n\nSECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT\n\nThe following table sets forth certain information with respect to the beneficial ownership of our common stock as of March 31, 2008 by:\n\n\n\neach current director;\n\nThe percentage ownership is based on 194,428,020 shares of common stock outstanding at March 31, 2008.

We are in the process of implementing a new business strategy that will allow us to focus on expanding our core businesses, such as web certificates and the Internet naming registry, and developing closely aligned growth opportunities, such as identity protection services. At the same time, we will be divesting a number of peripheral businesses in our portfolio such as communications, billing and commerce. We experienced significant turnover in our executive ranks in 2007, including in our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer positions. In connection with this transition, our executive compensation program went through a number of changes in 2007, including refinement of the performance metrics we use to measure our annual performance as a Company and a change in the mix of long-term equity awards granted.\n\nThe ultimate goal of our executive compensation program remains to create long-term value for our stockholders. Toward this goal, we have designed our compensation programs for our executives to reward them for sustained financial and operating performance and leadership excellence, to align their interests with those of our stockholders and to encourage them to remain with us into the future.\n\nIn the sections below, we describe our executive compensation program for 2007, including:\n\nFor 2007, our Named Executive Officers were:\n\n1. William A. Roper, Jr., President, Chief Executive Officer and Director\n\n2. Albert E. Clement, former Chief Financial Officer\n\n3. John M. Donovan, former Executive Vice President, Sales, Operations, Customer Care and Product Development\n\n4. Aristotle N. Balogh, former Executive Vice President and Chief Technology Officer\n\n5. Robert J. Korzeniewski, former Executive Vice President, Corporate Development\n\nMr. Clements employment with the Company ended on April 4, 2008. On April 4, 2008, the Companys Board of Directors appointed Brian G. Robins as acting Chief Financial Officer of VeriSign. Mr. Robins, 38, has served as Senior Vice President, Finance, for the Company since August 2007 and as Vice President from January 2007 to August 2007. Prior to joining VeriSign in January 2007, Mr. Robins was employed by NeuStar, a provider of clearinghouse services for communication service providers and enterprises, in a number of capacities since 2001, including as Vice President of Finance and Treasurer. Mr. Robins holds a B.A degree in Finance from Lipscomb University and an M.B.A. from Vanderbilt University. The Compensation Committee will consider changes to Mr. Robins current compensation, if any, at a future date.\n\nMessrs. Korzeniewski, Balogh and Donovan terminated their employment on December 31, 2007, January 8, 2008, and March 31, 2008, respectively. In addition, a number of our senior executives left the Company during 2007, including the following, who are also considered to be Named Executive Officers for 2007:\n\n1. Stratton D. Sclavos, former Chairman of the Board, President, and Chief Executive Officer\n\n16\n\nTable of Contents\n\n2. Dana L. Evan, former Executive Vice President, Finance and Administration and Chief Financial Officer\n\n3. Mark D. McLaughlin, former Executive Vice President, Products and Marketing\n\nExecutive Compensation\n\nCompensation Goals and Philosophy\n\nAs stated above, the goal of our executive compensation program is to create long-term value for our stockholders. In order to achieve this goal, our executive compensation program seeks to attract and retain highly talented executives, motivate them to achieve our business objectives and contribute to our long-term success.\n\nOur executive officer compensation program is designed with the following principles in mind:\n\nThe Process for Setting Compensation\n\nRole of the Compensation Committee: The Compensation Committee of our Board (the Compensation Committee) is ultimately responsible for the oversight of our compensation and benefit programs, and sets the policies governing compensation of our executive officers and our other employees. As part of this process, the Compensation Committee annually reviews and approves all elements of our executive compensation program, including the annual incentive bonus program and long-term incentive compensation programs for our non-officer employees.\n\nCompensation decisions are made by the Compensation Committee after reviewing the performance of the Company and each executives performance during the year against established goals, current compensation arrangements, market trends, and the compensation history of the executive officer relative to the other executives.\n\nRole of Management: The CEO annually reviews the performance of each executive officer (other than the CEO whose performance is reviewed by the Chairman and the Compensation Committee) and makes a recommendation regarding the salary, incentive bonus and long-term incentive compensation for each executive officer (other than himself) based on his assessment of the performance of each individual. The CEO also takes an active part in the discussions at Compensation Committee meetings at which the compensation of executives who report to him directly, including the Named Executive Officers is discussed. All decisions regarding the CEOs compensation are made by the Compensation Committee in executive session, without the CEO present.\n\nRole of Compensation Consultant: Compensia Inc., a recognized, management consulting firm (Compensia) served as independent consultant to the Compensation Committee during the first half of 2007 to assist it in evaluating and analyzing the Companys executive compensation program, principles and objectives, as well as the specific compensation and benefit design recommendations presented by the Companys executive management.\n\nIn May 2007, the Compensation Committee engaged Frederick W. Cook & Co. (FW Cook) to serve as its independent compensation consultant. FW Cook reports directly to the Compensation Committee and assists in evaluating and analyzing our executive compensation program, principles and objectives, as well as the specific\n\n17\n\nTable of Contents\n\ncompensation and benefit design recommendations presented by our executive management. FW Cook does not perform any other services for us other than its consulting services to the Compensation Committee.\n\nBenchmarking: We use a benchmarking process to help determine base salary, annual incentive bonus and long-term incentive compensation targets for our executive officers. We undertake an annual study of competitive compensation practices for executive officers at certain high technology companies that we view as our peers or as competitors for talent.\n\nThe Compensation Committee targets total cash compensation (base salary and annual incentive bonus) for each Named Executive Officer at a percentile between the 50th and 75th percentile of the compensation peer group. Long-term incentive compensation is targeted at the 75th percentile of the compensation peer group. Adjustments to total compensation are made based on the executives individual performance in the prior year relative to his peers, the executives future potential with us, and the scope of the executives responsibilities and experience. The Compensation Committee believes that setting base salary, bonus and long-term incentive compensation targets at these levels is necessary in order to effectively attract, retain and motivate talented executives. Other elements of compensation, including health and welfare benefits, and severance and change in control payments and benefits are reviewed periodically by the Compensation Committee to ensure that our total compensation is competitive based on data obtained from various sources at the time of the review.\n\nOur compensation peer group is principally made up of publicly-traded companies in the high technology sector that are either business competitors and/or with which we compete for executive talent. The peer group is comparable to us with regard to labor market competition, market capitalization, revenue and number of employees. The peer group is reviewed annually and adjustments are made as necessary to ensure the group continues to appropriately reflect the competitive market for key talent and includes companies similar to us in scope and complexity.\n\nThe Compensation Committee determined that the compensation peer group for 2007 would consist of the following fifteen companies: Adobe Systems Inc., Akamai Technologies Inc., Autodesk, BEA Systems Inc., BMC Software, Inc., Business Objects S.A., Cadence Design Systems Inc., Citrix Systems Inc., Convergys Corporation, Electronic Arts Inc., Intuit Inc., Juniper Networks Inc., McAfee, Inc., Network Appliance Inc., and Symantec Corp.\n\nRange of Revenues and Market Cap for 2007 Peer Group\n\n2007\n\nRevenue\n\n(in millions) 12/31/2007\n\nMarket Cap\n\n(in millions)\n\n75th Percentile\n\n$ 2,997.1 $ 12,743.7\n\nMedian\n\n$ 2,070.2 $ 7,210.7\n\n25th Percentile\n\n$ 1,498.6 $ 5,985.8\n\nVeriSign\n\n$ 1,496.3 $ 8,480.5\n\nEquity Award Practices: Except for equity awards made in connection with new hires and promotions, equity awards to executive officers and other employees are generally made annually on the date of the Compensation Committee meeting held in August each year. The Compensation Committee must approve all new hire and promotion grants to Section 16 executive officers.\n\nElements of Compensation Program\n\nBase Salary: Base salary is the primary fixed component of our compensation program, and is intended to provide a guaranteed level of annual income to our executives. We believe that offering a competitive annual base salary that is not subject to risk for performance is vital in attracting and retaining our executives.\n\n18\n\nTable of Contents\n\nBase salaries of our executive officers are determined annually. Actual base salary levels are established based upon each executive officers job responsibilities and experience, individual contributions and future potential, with reference to base salary levels of executives at other high technology companies we view as our peers. As described above, we target a percentile above the median as determined by a benchmarking analysis in setting the total cash compensation (base salary and annual incentive bonus) for each executive officer. However, the Compensation Committee is mindful of the effects that any changes to base salary can have on other elements of our compensation program such as target bonus amounts and potential severance payments, and carefully considers these factors when setting or changing executive base salaries.\n\nDuring the course of 2007, the Compensation Committee approved base salary adjustments for several of our senior executive officers, including some of the Named Executive Officers. The adjustments were made after the Compensation Committee reviewed competitive benchmark data provided by Compensia and by FW Cook and recommendations from the CEO regarding each executives individual performance. The Compensation Committee determined that the resulting salary levels were between the competitive median and 75th percentile.\n\nName\n\nTitle\n\n1/1/07 Salary Rate 12/31/07 Salary Rate\n\nWilliam A. Roper, Jr.\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer and Director\n\nn/a $ 750,000\n\nAlbert E. Clement\n\nformer Chief Financial Officer\n\n$ 290,000 $ 375,000\n\nJohn M. Donovan\n\nformer EVP, Sales, Operations, Customer Care and Product Development\n\n$ 450,000 $ 450,000\n\nAristotle N. Balogh\n\nformer EVP and Chief Technology Officer\n\n$ 336,000 $ 360,000\n\nRobert J. Korzeniewski\n\nformer EVP, Corporate Development\n\n$ 367,500 $ 375,000\n\nThe salary rate for Mr. Roper reflects his base salary when he was hired as VeriSigns President, Chief Executive Officer and Director on May 27, 2007. Mr. Clement received a base salary increase on January 27, 2007 bringing his salary from $290,000 to $305,000. On July 12, 2007, Mr. Clement was appointed to the position of Chief Financial Officer and his salary was increased upon his promotion to $375,000. Messrs. Balogh and Korzeniewski received increases to their base salaries effective May 1, 2007. Mr. Donovans base salary reflects his salary rate when he was hired on December 1, 2006 and there were no other increases to his salary in 2007.\n\nAnnual Incentive Bonus: We have established the VeriSign Performance Plan (VPP), an annual cash bonus plan that is designed to reward members of the executive team and other employees for their contributions in helping us achieve financial, operating, and other goals. The plan provides participants with the opportunity to earn an annual cash bonus based on our performance compared against pre-established financial, individual, or strategic goals. Target bonus levels for our executive officers are established in part by reference to bonus levels of executives at other high technology companies we view as our peers as determined by our benchmarking analysis.\n\nIn 2007, the performance measures for the VPP were consolidated Company operating income and operating cash flow, as adjusted, with each goal being equally weighted. The adjusted measures exclude the following items which are included under GAAP operating income: amortization of intangible assets, impairment of goodwill, acquired in-process research and development, stock-based compensation, former CEO severance, non-recurring costs and settlements, restructuring, impairments and other charges (reversals), net gain or loss on the sale or impairment of investments, gain or loss on the sale of a subsidiary, unrealized gain on Jamba JV call option, realized and unrealized gains and losses on embedded derivative, and stock option investigation costs. These goals represented a change from the previous year, when revenues and as adjusted operating income were\n\n19\n\nTable of Contents\n\nused. The Compensation Committee changed the goals for 2007 because of the changes in our strategic plan in 2007, as the Compensation Committee believed that changing the revenue goal to operating cash flow goal, as adjusted, would be a more appropriate performance measure for the Company. The goals for 2007 were reviewed by the Compensation Committee in February and May of 2007. However, due to a strategic review of business operations, the Compensation Committee deferred final approval of the metrics and goals for 2007 until approved in November 2007.\n\nFor the 2007 VPP bonuses, the Compensation Committee established target levels of performance for each metric, equal to $450 million for operating cash flow and $354 million for operating income. Actual funding for payouts was determined by the Companys average achievement as a percent of target for the two goals. No payments would be provided for achievement at or below 80% of target, while achievement at or above 120% of the target goals could result in payment of 150% of each executives target bonus. For 2007, the Compensation Committee determined that the Company achieved 103% of the operating cash flow target and 93% of the operating income target for a combined average result of 98% of target. This achievement of 98% of the targeted performance resulted in the bonus funded at 90% of targeted dollars, based on the schedule, approved by the Compensation Committee.\n\nBonus targets for the Named Executive Officers are set at 60% of base salary except for Mr. Roper whose bonus target is set at 100% of base salary. Bonuses to executives are pro-rated from date of hire or from assignment to executive officer position, or as in the case of former executives, per their severance arrangement. At the Compensation Committee meeting held on February 19, 2008, the Compensation Committee approved VPP bonus payments to Named Executive Officers for the following amounts: Mr. Roper, $405,000; Mr. Clement, $134,000; Mr. Donovan, $243,000; Mr. Balogh, $116,640; Mr. Korzeniewski, $121,500; Ms. Evan, $117,936; and Mr. McLaughlin, $145,800. In determining the final payments, the Compensation Committee took into account the performance results of the VPP and assessment of the individual performance of each of the executives.\n\nDiscretionary Bonus: In 2007, a special discretionary bonus plan was implemented to reward certain employees for work in connection with the Companys restatement of its financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 which was completed in July 2007. Payments under the special discretionary bonus plan were made in two parts, based on successful completion of project milestones. Mr. Clement participated in this special discretionary bonus plan and received bonus payments of $60,444 and $40,206 on May 25, 2007 and July 20, 2007, respectively.\n\nLong-term Incentive Compensation: Equity-based grants are an important element of our total compensation program and are designed to support our pay-for-performance philosophy by providing a direct link between employee rewards and increased stockholder value. Long-term incentive award amounts are established based upon each executive officers job responsibilities and experience, individual contributions and future potential, with reference to long-term incentive award levels of executives at our peers as determined by our benchmarking analysis.\n\nFor 2007, long-term incentive compensation was targeted at the 75th percentile of the compensation peer group; however, a number of other factors were also considered including the individuals expected contribution to our future success, the individuals past performance, and the number of unvested stock options and RSUs held by the individual.\n\nThe Compensation Committee approved a change in award value mix for equity awards granted to Vice Presidents and executives, including the Named Executive Officers in 2007. 50% of the total award value was granted in the form of non-qualified stock options and 50% of the total award value was granted in the form of Performance Restricted Stock Units (Performance RSUs). In prior years, the mix was 75% stock options and 25% time-vesting RSUs. This change to emphasize Performance RSUs over stock options was made to provide additional retention value for senior leaders due to the changes occurring in the Company during 2007.\n\n20\n\nTable of Contents\n\nStock options were granted with an exercise price equal to fair market value at the date of grant and typically vest over a four-year period with 25% of the option shares vesting on the first anniversary of the grant and the remaining option shares vesting ratably each quarter thereafter until fully vested.\n\nThe Compensation Committee awarded Performance RSUs to certain senior officers in 2007, including the Named Executive Officers. 100% of the target number of Performance RSUs awarded to each executive will vest on the third anniversary of grant if during any sixty (60) consecutive trading days prior to the third anniversary of the date of grant the average closing price of the Companys common stock equals or exceeds a stock price target of $39.78, as reported by the NASDAQ Global Select Market. If we do not achieve the stock price target by the third anniversary of grant, 50% of the target number of Performance RSUs will vest on the fourth anniversary of the date of grant, and the remaining 50% of Performance RSUs will be forfeited. Vesting in all cases is subject to the recipients continued employment with the Company.\n\nStock options and Performance RSUs were granted on August 7, 2007 at the regularly scheduled Compensation Committee meeting. The grant price for stock options was $29.63 which was the closing sale price per share of VeriSigns common stock on the NASDAQ Global Select Market on August 7, 2007. The below table details the equity grants awarded to Named Executive Officers, excluding Mr. Roper whose equity grants are discussed in the section titled CEO Compensation.\n\nName\n\nTitle\n\nNumber of Stock\n\nOptions Granted\n\nAugust 7, 2007 Number of\n\nPerformance RSUs\n\nGranted\n\nAugust 7, 2007\n\nAlbert E.

McLaughlin\n\nformer Executive Vice President, Products and Marketing\n\n88,118 61,882\n\nAt its meeting held on February 19, 2008, the Compensation Committee approved a grant of 10,000 Performance RSUs to Mr. Clement. This was a discretionary retentive grant award acknowledging Mr. Clements role in the transformation of the Company in 2008 and beyond. One-third of this grant will vest two years from the first anniversary from date of grant, one-third will vest on the third anniversary from date of grant and one-third will vest on the fourth anniversary from date of grant.\n\nThe Compensation Committee believes that both stock options and Performance RSUs accomplish our goal of linking executive compensation to increases in stockholder value. Stock options only have value to the recipient if the Companys share price increases from the date of grant. In addition, the Performance RSUs provide immediate retention value to our executives while still maintaining a strong incentive to increase the Companys share price.\n\nCEO Compensation: Mr. Roper was hired as the Companys new Chief Executive Officer on May 27, 2007. His new-hire base salary was established at $750,000 per year. For 2007, Mr. Roper was eligible for the\n\n21\n\nTable of Contents\n\nVPP bonus at a target of 100% of his base salary, pro-rated from his date of hire. His maximum bonus potential is no greater than 200% of his base salary. Mr. Ropers base salary and bonus target were positioned at the median of our competitive peer group.\n\nThe long-term incentive component of Mr. Ropers new-hire compensation package consisted of both stock options and Performance RSUs. He received a new-hire sign-on non-qualified stock option to acquire 158,227 shares of VeriSigns common stock. This sign-on option vests in equal installments on each quarterly anniversary from the date of grant of the sign-on option over the three years from the date of grant, provided that Mr. Roper remains continually employed by VeriSign at all times during the relevant quarter. Mr. Roper also received a new-hire sign-on RSU award with respect to 110,375 shares of VeriSigns common stock. The sign-on RSU award vests in equal installments on each quarterly anniversary of the date of grant of the sign-on RSU award over three years from date of grant provided he remain continuously employed by VeriSign at all times during the relevant quarter.\n\nMr. Roper also received a non-qualified stock option award to acquire 210,970 shares of VeriSigns common stock. The option vests in equal installments on each quarterly anniversary of the date of grant of the first-year option over the three years from the date of grant.\n\nA Performance RSU award with respect to 88,300 shares was also granted to Mr. Roper. This Performance RSU shall vest upon meeting the terms described above for Performance RSUs.\n\nMr. Ropers sign-on and equity awards were granted on August 7, 2007. His stock option awards were granted at an exercise price of $29.63 per share, which represents the closing sale price per share of VeriSigns common stock on the NASDAQ Global Select Market on the grant date. The sign-on grant amounts were established as a buy-out of previously forfeited equity compensation from Mr. Ropers prior employer. His other equity grants were established at the market median of our peer group.\n\nBenefits: Executive officers, like other employees, participate in a number of benefit programs designed to enable us to attract and retain employees in a competitive marketplace. We provide executive officers the same health and welfare benefits provided generally to all other employees, at the same general premium rates charged to such employees, with the exception of the Group Voluntary Universal Life insurance benefit. The benefits include medical, dental and vision insurance and other health benefits, fitness club reimbursement up to $390 per year, paid time off, an employee stock purchase plan, and a qualified 401(k) salary deferral plan. The Group Voluntary Universal Life insurance benefit is open to all U.S.-based employees with an annual salary of $110,000 or greater, and provides two times salary in basic life insurance as well as the opportunity to purchase additional life insurance.\n\nOther than those benefits described above, we provide no additional or supplemental benefits, such as a company automobile, club memberships, deferred compensation programs, or retirement benefits, to our executive officers.\n\nTotal Compensation: We believe we are fulfilling our compensation objectives and rewarding executive officers in a manner that is consistent with our pay-for-performance philosophy. Executive compensation is tied directly to our performance and is structured to ensure that there is an appropriate balance between our long-term and short-term performance, and also provides a balance between our operational performance and stockholder return. For the Named Executive Officers as of the end of 2007, the aggregate total compensation mix represented 10% base salaries, 5% bonus and 85% long-term incentives.\n\n22\n\nTable of Contents\n\nShare Ownership Guidelines\n\nIn addition to aligning interests between executives and stockholders through stock options and RSUs, the Board adopted a stock ownership policy that requires executive officers to own shares of VeriSign common stock. Executive officers are required to own VeriSign common stock in an amount not less than three times their annual base salary (calculated using the executives 2005 base salary for individuals who were executive officers at the time of the policys adoption or, for officers appointed after the policys adoption, the executives initial base salary at the time the individual was appointed as an executive officer). Company stock that counts toward satisfaction of these stock ownership guidelines includes: shares owned outright by the officer and his or her immediate family members who share the same household, whether held individually or jointly; restricted stock where restrictions have lapsed; shares acquired and held upon stock option exercises; and shares obtained through open market purchases. Shares held in trust may also be included, subject to the approval of the Chairman of the Board. Each executive officer has five years from the later of the date of the adoption of the requirement or of becoming an executive officer, to attain the minimum level of ownership. The stock ownership policy is included in VeriSigns Corporate Governance Principles which can be found on our Website at http://investor.verisign.com/governance.cfm.\n\nBecause we grant stock-based incentives in order to align the interests of our employees with those of our stockholders, our Securities Trading Policy forbids executive officers and other employees from buying or selling derivative securities related to VeriSign common stock, such as puts or calls on VeriSign common stock, since derivative securities may diminish the alignment that we are trying to foster. Company-issued stock options and RSUs are not transferable during the executive officers life, other than certain gifts to family members (or trusts, partnerships, etc., that benefit family members).\n\nSeverance Agreements\n\nWe do not have a formal severance program for our executive officers, all of whom are at-will employees. We generally do not enter into employment agreements with our executive officers and employment offers generally do not provide for severance or other benefits following termination.\n\nChange-in-Control and Retention Agreements\n\nIn August 2007, we entered into Change-in-Control and Retention Agreements with our executive officers and chief executive officer, including the Named Executive Officers. The agreements provide for certain severance benefits in the event an executives employment is terminated in connection with a change in control of the Company. All of the agreements are double trigger agreements meaning that executives will only be eligible for benefits under the agreements if both (i) a change in control of the Company occurs and (ii) within twenty-four months of the change-in-control the executives employment is terminated by the Company without cause (or by the executive for good reason) in connection with the change-in-control. The Compensation Committee believes that the Change-in-Control and Retention Agreements are necessary to attract and retain highly qualified executives and to neutralize the personal interests of our executives in light of any potential beneficial corporate transaction. The Compensation Committee determined the Change-in-Control and Retention Agreements were reasonable when compared to competitive peer group practice.\n\nSeparation Agreements with Former Executives\n\nThe employment of several of our senior executives was terminated in 2007, and we entered into separation agreements with some of these executives. The separation agreements generally provide for severance payments and in some cases, equity award vesting acceleration and extension of post-termination exercise periods. Detailed descriptions of these separation agreements and related severance payments can be found in the narrative that follows and in the section titled Grants of Plan-Based Awards for Fiscal 2007.\n\n23\n\nTable of Contents\n\nRetirement of Former Executive\n\nOn December 31, 2007, Mr. Korzeniewski retired from the Company. At its meeting on February 19, 2008 the Compensation Committee approved a bonus of $121,500 for Mr. Korzeniewski based on individual performance and the performance of the Company in fiscal year 2007, pursuant to the terms of the 2007 VPP.\n\nTax Treatment of Executive Compensation\n\nIn determining the amount and form of compensation paid each year to its executive officers, we take into account the tax treatment of such compensation.\n\nSection 162(m) of the Code limits the federal income tax deduction for compensation paid to each Named Executive Officer, other than the Companys chief financial officer, to $1,000,000 per year for public companies, unless the compensation is performance-based. Our executive compensation is structured to maximize the amount of compensation expense that is deductible by the Company when, in its judgment, it is appropriate and in the interest of the Company and its stockholders. The deductibility of an executive officers compensation can depend upon the timing of the executive officers vesting or exercise of previously granted rights, as well as other factors beyond the Companys control. Therefore an executive officers compensation is not necessarily limited to that which is deductible under Section 162(m). The Compensation Committee may approve payment of compensation that exceeds the deductibility limitation under Section 162(m) in order to meet compensation objectives or if it determines that doing so is otherwise in the interest of our stockholders. Certain RSUs awarded in 2007 are not performance based and therefore not exempt from the limitation of deductibility under 162(m).\n\nReport of the Compensation Committee\n\nThe information contained in this report shall not be deemed to be soliciting material or filed with the SEC or subject to the liabilities of Section 18 of the Exchange Act, except to the extent that we specifically incorporate it by reference into a document filed under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act.\n\nThe Compensation Committee has reviewed and discussed with management the Compensation Discussion and Analysis included in this Proxy Statement. Based on the review and discussions, the Compensation Committee recommended to the Board, and the Board has approved, that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in this Proxy Statement.\n\nThis report is submitted by the Compensation Committee\n\nLouis A. Simpson (Chairperson)\n\nTimothy Tomlinson\n\nCompensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation\n\nThe members of the Compensation Committee are Louis A. Simpson and Timothy Tomlinson. During fiscal 2007, D. James Bidzos, Michelle Guthrie and Edward A. Mueller also served on the Compensation Committee. All of the members of the Compensation Committee during 2007 were independent directors, and none of the members of the Compensation Committee during 2007 were employees or officers or former officers of VeriSign, with the exception of Mr. Bidzos who served as Chief Executive Officer of the Company from April 1995 until July 1995 and resigned from the Compensation Committee on February 19, 2008. Edward A. Mueller served on the Compensation Committee until his resignation from the Board on August 15, 2007. Michelle Guthrie served on the Compensation Committee until her resignation from the Compensation Committee on January 30, 2008. No executive officer of VeriSign has served on the compensation committee (or other board committee performing equivalent functions or, in the absence of any such committee, the entire board of directors) or the board of directors of another entity, one of whose executive officers served as a member of the\n\n24\n\nTable of Contents\n\nCompensation Committee of VeriSign during fiscal 2007; no executive officer of VeriSign has served on the compensation committee (or other board committee performing equivalent functions or, in the absence of any such committee, the entire board of directors) of another entity, one of whose executive officers served as a member of the Board of VeriSign during fiscal 2007.\n\nSummary Compensation Table\n\nThe following table sets forth certain summary information concerning the compensation received by our chief executive officer and chief financial officer as of the end of fiscal 2007, the three other most highly compensated executive officers as of the end of fiscal 2007, our former principal executive officer and former principal financial officer who served the Company for a portion of fiscal 2007, as well as one individual who would have been among the three most highly compensated executive officers for fiscal 2007 but for the fact that the individual was not serving as an executive officer at the end of fiscal 2007. We refer to these executive officers and former executive officers as our Named Executive Officers.\n\nSUMMARY COMPENSATION TABLE\n\nNamed Executive Officer\n\nand Principal Position\n\nYear Salary\n\n(1) Bonus\n\n(2) Stock\n\nAwards\n\n(3) Option\n\nAwards\n\n(3) Non-Equity\n\nIncentive Plan\n\nCompensation\n\n(4) All Other\n\nCompensation\n\n(5) Total\n\nWilliam A.
