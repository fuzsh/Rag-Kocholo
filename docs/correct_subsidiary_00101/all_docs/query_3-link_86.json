        "text": "Each year, over 1.6 million new domain names are registered online. If you want to maintain a unique online identity, you need a registered domain name.\n\nHaving assisted numerous clients in securing registered domain names, I have amassed considerable expertise in this area.\n\nIn this guide, I will do my best to explain to you all the essential aspects you should know about domain name registrars and why you need one for your domain registration.\n\nWhat Is A Domain Name Registrar?\n\nA domain name registrar is an organization or company accredited by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) or a national country code top-level domain (ccTLD) authority. Their primary function is to manage the reservation and registration of domain names on the internet.\n\nWhen you build a website, you have to assign it a domain name. All websites on the internet have unique IP addresses and domain names.\n\nFor example, Wikipedia’s domain name is Wikipedia.com. Its IP address is 208.80.154.232.\n\nYou can use either to visit the site, by entering the IP address into your browser’s address bar, but clearly, using the name is much easier.\n\nIf you want to make it easier for your clients/audience to find your website, you need to buy and register a unique domain name.\n\nThis job is handled by domain name registrars or DNS registrars for short. You can buy your preferred domain name from a registrar. They will then register the domain name, linking it to your website’s IP address.\n\nYou can think of them as car dealers – they sell you the product and handle the paperwork. But a dealership does not make the cars – that supply comes from elsewhere. And in the domain business, that role is fulfilled by domain registries.\n\nWhat Is The Difference Between A Registrar And A Registry?\n\nThe difference between a registrar and a registry lies in their distinctive responsibilities. We can use the car dealership analogy to understand the relationship between domain registrars and registries.\n\nA registrar acts as a middleman between the customer and the actual supplier of the product, in some ways like a car dealer.\n\nIn the case of domain names, a registry is like a car manufacturer. It maintains and manages the actual database containing all domain names. In the DNS hierarchy, a domain registry sits above domain registrars.\n\nThere are multiple domain registries out there, each managing a particular top-level domain (TLD). In a website address, the top-level domain is the small sequence of letters at the end – like .com, org, and .edu.\n\nFor example, the databases for all websites using the .com and .net TLDs are handled by a company called Verisign. The databases for .org sites are handled by a non-profit organization called Public Interest Registry.\n\nThese registries outsource the customer-side business to domain registrars. When you buy a domain name from a DNS registrar, the registrar has to notify the concerned registry and also pay them their share of the fees.\n\nThis system allows registries to focus on core activities like general administration, setting rules, security and stability, and settling disputes between entities about ownership of specific domain names.\n\nAll registries and registrars operate under the central authority of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, or ICANN.\n\nFormed in 1998, ICANN is a not-for-profit organization involving IT and communications industry bodies, government representatives, and other global organizations.\n\nICANN coordinates everything related to the domain name/IP address system of the internet through a department called the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA).\n\nExpert Quote: 52.8% of all websites use the .com top-level domain. If you plan to run a business website, you can use .com for maximum credibility. However, the TLD does not make a difference in SEO performance.\n\nHow Does A Domain Registrar Work?\n\nThe domain registrar works like a pyramid structure with ICANN at the top. Under its authority, individual organizations like Verisign manage registry services for specific top-level domains like .com, .net, .uk, .ru, etc.\n\nTo become a domain name registrar, a company has to deal with both ICANN and the registry organization. Only ICANN-accredited businesses are allowed to sell domain names to consumers.\n\nInterested business organizations have to prove that they have the required financial and technical capabilities to operate a domain registrar business.\n\nIf the ICANN is satisfied with the credentials, it will provide accreditation to the registrar and also inform all registry operators. After getting accreditation, the domain registrar has to sign agreements with the registry operators.\n\nFor instance, if a company wants to sell .com domains, it has to enter into a contract with Verisign. If it is a Canadian company interested in selling .ca domains, it has to sign a contract with the Canadian Internet Registration Authority (CIRA).\n\nOnce a domain registrar acquires both an ICANN accreditation and a domain registry contract agreement, it can start selling domain names to customers.\n\nMany modern domain registrars also offer other value-added services like domain hosting and domain transfers.\n\nHere is the basic process of buying a .com domain:\n\nWhat Is Private Domain Name Registration?\n\nWhen you buy a domain name from a registrar, you have to provide certain contact details including your name, address, email, and phone number. This information is linked to your domain name.\n\nThe registrar is contractually obliged to share this information with ICANN. The information is held across registries across the world in a database system called WHOIS.\n\nAnybody can check this contact information online using the WHOIS search function.\n\nThe WHOIS database exists for perfectly legitimate reasons – to verify a site’s legitimacy or contact a domain owner for buying the domain name, etc.\n\nUnfortunately, in this era of growing cybercrime, personal contact details can be easily misused for spamming, phishing, etc. This is why many domain registrars offer the option of private domain name registration.\n\nInstead of posting your contact information to the ICANN WHOIS database, the registrar will provide alternate contact details. Usually, the contact information provided is that of the registrar or a proxy service owner by the registrar.\n\nDomain registrars usually charge extra fees for private domain name registration. Using this feature makes sense if you are an individual concerned about privacy.\n\nFor businesses, which usually have public contact details anyway, private registration is only beneficial in certain specific situations where it makes sense to hide ownership of specific domains.\n\nThe main problem with private domain registration is ownership – in most instances, ownership is based on the information available in ICANN databases.\n\nIf your domain name is registered with contact details from a proxy, it basically means that the registrar owns the domain.\n\nWhile this is not problematic in most situations, it is still a factor worth considering. You don’t have to worry about registrars stealing your domain name – they rely on repeat business and would not want to alienate customers in any way.\n\nWhat Is A Domain Name Server?\n\nA Domain Name Server (DNS) is a fundamental component of the internet infrastructure that translates human-readable domain names into IP addresses used by computers and other devices to identify and communicate with one another.\n\nComputers don’t need domain names to locate websites. They can do that using the unique IP address assigned to a website or server located on a network.\n\nWhen you register a domain name for your website, it is linked to the IP address of your website. The information connecting your domain name to the correct IP address is stored on a domain name server.\n\nWhen any user enters the domain name in a browser, the system will send a query to the domain name server. It provides the computer with the right IP address allowing the system to display the correct website to the user.\n\nDomain name servers are a vital cog in internet machinery. It acts as a connecting link between domain names (used by humans) and IP addresses (used by computers).\n\nHow Do Domain Name Registrars Protect User Privacy?\n\nDomain name registrars protect user privacy with private domain name system registration as the main process.\n\nWith private registration, the registrar will act as a proxy for the user and keep user data away from WHOIS databases.\n\nBased on this, the domain name registrar will still main client records on their databases.\n\nIf someone gains unauthorized access to the registrar databases, they can find useful data. Registrars may also share user data with governments or law enforcement agencies.\n\nWhat Role Do Registrars Play In DNS Security?\n\nDomain name registrars play a significant role in DNS security by offering various services and features that help protect domain names and the associated DNS infrastructure.\n\nA major concern in DNS security is domain hijacking. Also called domain theft, it involves changing the registration details of a domain name without the permission of the original owner.\n\nCriminals can do it in several ways:\n\nICANN guidelines mention several steps that registrars can take to prevent domain hijacking and improve DNS security. These include:\n\nHow Do I Find My Current Domain Name Registrar?\n\nYou can find your current domain name registrar in two ways.\n\nIf you are the owner of the domain name, you can usually find the registrar information in your email inbox – search for any invoices related to your domain name.\n\nAnother way is by using any publicly available WHOIS search tool. Many online sites provide this service for free. Do a Google search for WHOIS to find one in your region. In the search tool, enter your domain name – the search results will usually have registrar information.\n\nHow Do I Register A New Domain Name?\n\nYou can register a new domain fairly easily. Pick a highly rated domain registrar that offers domain names using your preferred TLD (.com, .org, etc.). Check the official lists to ensure that the registrar is accredited with ICANN.\n\nMost registrars give you easy methods to search for available domain names using a domain name search tool. Pick an available name that fits your purpose, and proceed with the purchase process.\n\nYou will have to provide your name and contact details. After that, pay the stated fees to get your newly registered domain name! For a\n\nHow Does Domain Name Transfer Work\n\nDomain registration does not come with any long-term contractual obligations. You don’t have to stick with your original domain registrar forever.\n\nICANN security policy to prevent domain hijacking only says that you have to stick with a domain registrar for 60 days.\n\nAfter that waiting period, you can transfer your domain name to a different service provider, using the following basic steps:\n\nWhat To Look For In A Domain Registrar?\n\nWe reviewed top 10 largest domain registrars in 2023 and these are the features you should keep an eye out for:\n\nExpert Quote: Keep in mind that most domain registrars offer introductory discounts. Look at the normal long-term pricing when comparing different services.\n\nWhat Is A Top-level Domain?\n\nA top-level domain is the portion of a domain name that comes after the period, such as.com or.net. The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) used to be somewhat stringent about allowing new TLDs. Initially, the majority of specialty TLDs were associated with a particular industry, website type, or geographic region. For example .com was reserved for commercial enterprises.gov for government websites, and.org for non-profit organizations.\n\nAs the Internet has expanded, however, the demand for more accessible domain names has prompted ICANN to remove constraints on the number of TLDs and who may use them.\n\nAs a result, when you do a domain name search on the website of your preferred registrar, you will find a variety of TLD alternatives at various pricing ranges. If the desired domain name is not available as a.com, you may be able to purchase it for less at a.us or.site TLD.\n\nWhy Having a Registered Domain Name Matters?\n\nWhether you are an individual blogger or business owner, having your own unique domain name can be highly beneficial.\n\nIt can boost your brand value, increase your online visibility and bring more targeted traffic to your website. It’s also important l to pick a trusted provider for domain registration.\n\nWe hope you found our guide on domain registrars helpful."
