        "text": "Complementing recent security investments, the acquisition of iDefense augments Accenture Security’s existing Cyber Defense Services with targeted threat intelligence that Accenture will embed into services it manages for clients’ security operations. iDefense has amassed vast amounts of proprietary threat intelligence data over the past 18 years – data that powers its application program interfaces (APIs) and its distinctive analysis platform, IntelGraph. In addition to directly providing threat intelligence to Fortune 500 customers, Accenture will fuel its cybersecurity platform with these capabilities to enhance its ability to inform clients where threats are forming and coming from, and what actions to take – much earlier than other providers who leverage public data feeds.\n\niDefense’s capabilities will also become an integral component of Accenture’s adversary simulation, threat hunting and incident response services. Accenture’s Global Delivery Network of security professionals will further enhance iDefense’s offerings through new telemetry sources and innovative threat intelligence services designed to help organizations achieve maximum value from security technologies.\n\n“There simply isn’t enough time, budget or human resources to defend against every imaginable attack scenario or adversary without intelligent systems and automation. That’s why having the best available threat intelligence is critical to helping us protect our clients’ entire value chains, allowing them to focus on innovation and growth,” said Kelly Bissell, managing director of Accenture Security. “We are confident that the collective capabilities of Accenture Security and iDefense can help organizations better understand where threats are coming from and adjust protections before damage is done.”\n\nRecent research by Accenture reveals that companies often lack strategic threat intelligence and proper tools to identify as well as monitor threats. Fewer than two in five organizations report they are competent at monitoring and evaluating business relevant threats.\n\n“iDefense has always been recognized for our differentiated and innovative approach to security intelligence and vulnerability management. Our contextual cyber intelligence is delivered to clients in a highly consumable way, so they can confidently use it to enhance a security control, drive a course of action or mitigate risk effectively in their business,” said Josh Ray, Vice President, iDefense Security Intelligence Services. “We are very excited by this opportunity to bring our unparalleled threat intelligence services to Accenture Security’s extensive portfolio of end-to-end security and technology services.\n\nFounded in 1998 and headquartered in Northern Virginia, iDefense serves top-tier organizations across a range of industries – including banking, communications, media, technology and products.\n\nThe acquisition of iDefense builds on Accenture Security’s commitment to investing in and innovating advanced threat intelligence and cybersecurity solutions. Recent acquisitions include US-based Defense Point Security (supports the U.S. federal government and provides advanced cyber defense and response services), US-based FusionX, (simulates attacks of advanced adversaries), Israeli-based Maglan (provides vulnerability countermeasures, cyber forensics and malware defenses, and Accenture recently entered into an agreement to acquire US-based Endgame Federal Services Business (specializes in proactive cybersecurity defensive operations).\n\nAbout Accenture\n\nAccenture is a leading global professional services company, providing a broad range of services and solutions in strategy, consulting, digital, technology and operations. Combining unmatched experience and specialized skills across more than 40 industries and all business functions – underpinned by the world’s largest delivery network – Accenture works at the intersection of business and technology to help clients improve their performance and create sustainable value for their stakeholders.
