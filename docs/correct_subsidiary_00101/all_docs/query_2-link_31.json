It’s what you see to the right of the dot.\n\nBut different categories of TLDs also exist, such as a ccTLD, which stands for country code top level domain. This two-letter classification is generally reserved and used within a specific country or dependent territory, such as Japan (.jp), Germany (.de), France (.fr), Indonesia (.id) or the United Kingdom (.uk)\n\nThe ccTLD for Cocos (Keeling) Islands, an Australian territory with less than 600 in population1, is .cc. But this country code’s purpose has evolved, and extends beyond this tiny island in the Indian Ocean.\n\nToday, a .cc is globally known as an ideal domain for anyone who wants to establish an online presence.
