When considering the price list for Verisign SSL certificates, it’s important to understand the different types of certificates and their associated costs.\n\nHere’s a detailed discussion of the steps involved in understanding the Verisign SSL certificate price list:\n\nUnderstanding SSL Certificates\n\nAn SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) certificate is a digital certificate that authenticates the identity of a website and encrypts information sent to the server. Verisign offers a range of SSL certificates with varying features and prices.\n\nTypes of SSL Certificates\n\nVerisign provides different types of SSL certificates, such as Domain Validation (DV), Organization Validation (OV), and Extended Validation (EV) certificates.\n\nThe level of validation and the features offered determine the price of each certificate.\n\nVerisign SSL Certificate Price List (Norton Secured Seals)\n\nVerisign, now known as Norton Secured Seals, offers a range of SSL certificates with varying prices depending on features and validation levels. Here’s a breakdown of their main options:\n\nDomain Validation (DV) Certificates:\n\nSecure Site: Starting at $399/year. Basic encryption for single domain.\n\nWildcard: Starting at $1,999/year. Secures multiple subdomains under a single domain.\n\nOrganization Validation (OV) Certificates:\n\nPro: Starting at $995/year. Enhances validation with business verification. Green address bar and company information display.\n\nEV Pro: Starting at $1,499/year. Highest level of validation with extensive checks. Green address bar with padlock, company information, and dynamic site seal.\n\nAdditional factors that may affect price:\n\nNumber of years purchased: Multi-year plans typically offer discounts per year.\n\nAdd-ons: Additional features like malware scanning or vulnerability assessments can increase the cost.\n\nTips for choosing the right Verisign SSL certificate:\n\nConsider your website’s needs: Do you need basic encryption or enhanced validation with business verification?\n\nThink about your budget: How much can you afford to spend on an SSL certificate?\n\nCompare features: Different certificates offer different features, so choose one that meets your specific needs.\n\nFactors Affecting the Cost\n\nThe price of a Verisign SSL certificate, or any other brand for that matter, can be influenced by several factors. Here’s a breakdown of the key elements that can impact the cost:\n\nType of SSL Certificate:\n\nDomain Validation (DV): These are the most basic and affordable, verifying domain ownership through email or DNS.\n\nOrganization Validation (OV): More thorough, requiring company documentation and phone verification.\n\nExtended Validation (EV): The most rigorous, with in-depth identity verification displayed in a green address bar and company name.\n\nNumber of Domains Secured:\n\nSingle Domain: Covers only one domain name.\n\nMulti-Domain: Secures multiple subdomains or additional domain names at a higher cost.\n\nWildcard: Protects an entire domain and all its subdomains, typically pricier than a single domain.\n\nValidity Period:\n\nLonger validity periods (3 years) usually cost more than shorter ones (1 year).\n\nAdditional Features:\n\nSite seals, malware scanning, vulnerability assessments, PCI compliance checks can push the price up.\n\nProvider and Brand:\n\nVerisign, as a premium brand, generally has higher prices compared to budget-friendly providers.\n\nSpecial offers and discounts can affect cost significantly, so compare different providers.\n\nOther Considerations:\n\nSupport & Installation: Some providers offer managed services for installation and configuration, impacting the cost.\n\nRenewal Fees: Check renewal fees, as some vendors increase them after the initial purchase.\n\nUnderstanding these factors and make an informed decision when choosing a Verisign SSL certificate or any other brand, finding the best value for your security needs and budget.\n\nConsiderations for Purchase\n\nWhen deciding on a Verisign SSL certificate, it’s essential to consider the specific security needs of your website.\n\nFor example, e-commerce sites handling sensitive customer data may require the additional validation and trust indicators provided by EV certificates, while personal blogs or small business websites may find DV certificates sufficient.\n\nWhen purchasing a Verisign SSL certificate, choosing the right one amidst diverse options can be overwhelming. Here are some key considerations to navigate the process smoothly:\n\nYour Website Needs:\n\nSecurity Level: Assess your website’s sensitivity and data handling. Do you need basic encryption (DV) or advanced authentication (OV/EV)?\n\nNumber of Domains: Decide if you need a single domain certificate, multi-domain for subdomains, or a wildcard for an entire domain with subdomains.\n\nFeatures: Consider additional features like malware scanning, website vulnerability assessments, or PCI compliance for specific industries.\n\nBudget and Value:\n\nCompare Prices: Don’t stick solely to Verisign, explore offerings from reputable, budget-friendly providers. Compare prices for different validation levels, domains, and validity periods.\n\nMulti-Year Plans: Consider multi-year plans for significant discounts compared to annual renewals.\n\nRenewal Costs: Look into renewal fees, some providers significantly increase them after the initial purchase.\n\nEase of Use and Support:\n\nUser Interface: Choose a provider with a user-friendly interface for certificate management, installation, and renewal.\n\nCustomer Support: Ensure the provider offers reliable customer support if you encounter any issues with your certificate.\n\nVerisign Specific Considerations:\n\nReputation and Trust: Verisign boasts a high reputation with trusted certificates, but consider if the premium cost aligns with your website’s needs.\n\nGreen Address Bar: EV certificates from Verisign display a green address bar and company name, enhancing trust but at a higher price.\n\nAdditional Tips:\n\nRead Reviews: Look for independent reviews of different providers and their SSL certificate offerings.\n\nCheck for Discounts and Promotions: Many providers offer seasonal or special discounts, keep an eye out for best deals.\n\nUnderstand the Validation Process: Ensure you can provide necessary documentation for the chosen validation level (OV/EV).\n\nVerisign 3-Pro Advantage\n\nThe VeriSign 3-Pro Advantage is a 3-in-1 security product that offers various features to enhance website security and credibility.\n\nIt includes the Daily Malware Scanner (DMS) to protect websites from blacklisting, Seal-in-Search for promoting credibility, and a browser add-on that populates on over 70 million desktops.\n\nThe product also aims to propel interactivity and revenue.\n\nAt the same time, the HP Pico Neo 3 Pro VR Headset is a virtual reality headset that offers improved accuracy and latency experience with the introduction of two new 6DoF controllers, room-scale tracking, ergonomic design, high-fidelity FOV, and built-in eye tracking.\n\nThe future of Verisign Inc.’s tech strategy may be influenced by various factors, including government mandates and the professional world.\n\nHow to get verisign certificate free\n\nTo obtain a free SSL certificate, you can use services such as ZeroSSL, which provides SSL certificates for free and allows for automated renewal.\n\nZeroSSL offers a quick verification process and a user-friendly dashboard for certificate management.\n\nAnd some websites, such as Verisign, may offer free SSL trials, as mentioned in a Zimbra Tech Center article.\n\nNote that the availability of free SSL certificates may be subject to change, so it’s advisable to check the latest information from the respective certificate providers.\n\nBest Verisign SSL certificate Alternatives\n\nAs you’ve seen, Verisign is definitely a well-established name in the SSL certificate world, but there are plenty of excellent alternatives that might be a better fit for your needs and budget.\n\nHere are some top contenders:\n\nPremium Alternatives:\n\nDigiCert: Arguably the new Verisign, DigiCert boasts a strong reputation for security, reliability, and excellent customer support.
