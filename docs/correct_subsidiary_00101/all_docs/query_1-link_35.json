This data privacy statement (“statement”) describes the way we process your personal information when you visit our website or when you use our services.\n\nBy using GlobalProtec services, you are agreeing with the Privacy Statement and approve of our processing of your personal data, taking into consideration the applicable data protection laws and the following stipulations.\n\n1. Processing personal data\n\nPersonal data constitutes all statements and information relating to an identified or identifiable person. In addition to contact information such as your name, telephone number, address, e-mail address (or other information you give us as part of an order or participation in a contest or survey, for example), your IP address, which we log when you visit our site, and other information like the pages you looked at and your reactions to offers displayed on our site are also part of the personal data that we collect.\n\n2. Special considerations for our customers\n\nWithin their GlobalProtec account customers can manage products and services, as well as personal data and use other GlobalProtec online services.\n\nAfter registering and signing in with your login information, we are able to link your online usage data (e.g. how you use our Internet sites and services in the customer account, or data that you give us via the Internet sites and the customer account) with other customer data that we capture and process in conjunction with your usage of our products and services. We can then use that information to offer services and functions in the customer account, for marketing purposes and for the evaluation, improvement and new development of services and functions.\n\nYour online usage data is linked with other customer data after you have logged out of your online session.\n\nIf you would like to prevent this information from being compiled while you are logged into GlobalProtec, follow the instructions under Section 5 of this privacy statement.\n\n3. Cookies\n\n3.1 What are cookies?\n\nOn our websites we use so-called cookies. Cookies are small files that are saved on your computer or mobile device when you visit or use our websites. Cookies save certain settings via your browser as well as data regarding the exchange of information with the site via your browser. When cookies are activated, a cookie ID is assigned that is used to identify your browser and to use the information collected in the cookie.\n\nMost of the cookies we use are temporary and are automatically deleted from your computer or mobile device after your browser session has been ended. We also use permanent cookies too. These remain saved on your computer or mobile device after you end your browser session. Depending on the type of permanent cookies they remain on your computer or device for between one month and 10 years and are then automatically deactivated after the programmed period has expired.\n\n3.2 Why do we use cookies?\n\nCookies help us to make a number of functions on our websites available. For example, cookies can save your country and language settings as well as store your shopping basket even if you visit different pages in one Internet session.\n\nBy using cookies we can also capture and analyse the usage behaviour of users who visit our websites. That in turn enables us to create more user-friendly and effective sites and make your visits as enjoyable as possible. We can also display information that is specifically customised for you interests.\n\nWe use cookies in order to optimise advertising as well. Cookies allow us to show you advertising and/or products and services that are relevant to you based on the usage information we have collected from your visits to our sites. Our goal here is to make our Internet offering as attractive as possible for you and to display advertising that presumably relates to your areas of interests.\n\n3.3 Which data is captured?\n\nCookies capture usage information such as the date and time of your visit, the name of the site you visited, the IP address of your device and the operating system you use. Cookies provide information such as our sites you visit and which sites you came from before you arrived on our site.

Depending on the provider, these servers are sometimes in other countries.\n\nThe transfer of information is done by using shortened IP addresses, which prevents the identification of individual end-user devices. Your IP address is not linked with other data from these third parties. Any onward transfer by third parties will only be based on legal regulations or as part of a data processing service agreement.\n\n5.

For more information about the purpose and scope of the data capture, the further processing and use of the data by the third party, and the related rights and settings options to protect your privacy, please look at the data privacy statements of the third parties themselves.\n\nIf you would like to prevent social networks from linking your personal information captured on our websites with the social networks in question, you need to log out of that social network before visiting our website.
