        "text": "Symantec VIP Access helps protect your online accounts and transactions by using a strong authentication process when you sign in to your VIP-enabled accounts.\n\nâ¢ Strong authentication: Provides strong, two-factor authentication when logging into your VIP-enabled accounts.\n\nâ¢ QR/App Code: Scan a QR Code to generate site-specific security codes for strong two-factor authentication to your favorite websites.\n\nUse VIP Access at participating organizations such as eBay, PayPal, E*TRADE, Facebook, Google, or any one of the hundreds of sites within the VIP Network: :\n\nhttps://vip.symantec.com\n\nFeatures\n\nStrong Authentication\n\nVIP Access adds strong authentication to your normal login in one of the following ways:\n\nâ¢ Dynamically generate a one-time use security code on your mobile device. Use that code along with your username and password.\n\nâ¢ Receive a push notification on your mobile device that you approve as authentication. If your organization requires you to define an additional device authentication mechanism to meet the security requirements, you will be prompted for the additional local authentication such as passphrases or biometrics.\n\nâ¢ Enter a challenge number on your mobile device that you receive during authentication. The challenge number proves that you are physical present during authentication.\n\nâ¢ Use Touch ID, Face ID, or Passcode in a push notification to authenticate yourself on your mobile device.\n\nNote: Touch ID or Face ID authentication requires that your mobile device is Touch ID or Face ID capable and that you have registered a fingerprint or facial recognition authentication on the device.\n\nThe strong authentication method you use depends on the method implemented by your participating organization.\n\nYou can generate a security code even if you do not have a network or mobile connection.\n\nQR/App Codes\n\nScan a QR Code at participating organizations such as Google, Facebook, Amazon, and more to generate a security code every 30 seconds to securely sign in. Enter this security code along with your password to add strong authentication to your favorite websites.\n\nBe sure to read the VIP End User Agreement after downloading VIP Access: https://docs.broadcom.com/doc/end-user-agreement-english\n\nNorthern Frustration ,\n\nYour Choice\n\nI was going on my second year of service with Norton. Didnât have any issues until I changed my phone number. I couldnât access my account. Contacted customer service and they said I would have to set up a new account because of the two factor authentication (?). Anyway, I asked why canât they just change it to my new phone number. They said they canât do that. Never received an answer as to why. Iâm very frustrated. Asked them for a phone number. After a few tries of asking for a phone number to talk to someone, they finally gave it to me and said the answer would remain the same, no refund and I would have to set up a new account. As a customer, I am supposed to trust these guys? Absolutely NOT! I will take my business elsewhere. If I could give negative stars, it would. Never seen a customer service like this. I would caution people before using this company. Ultimately, itâs your decision."
