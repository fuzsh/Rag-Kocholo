        "text": "Important information about SSL and steps to edit SSL settings to meet your security needs.\n\nAll domains correctly pointing to your Squarespace site are automatically protected with free SSL certificates to improve security. SSL secures connections and prevents hackers from impersonating you or stealing visitors' information.\n\nThis guide explains how to select SSL settings based on what you need and other important information to know about your SSL certificate. If a warning about your site's security appears, try these troubleshooting steps.\n\nWatch a video\n\nWhat you'll need\n\nSSL certificates are automatically included for:\n\nSquarespace domains (registered or transferred to Squarespace)\n\nConnected third-party domains\n\nSubdomains\n\nBuilt-in domains\n\nIf there's something wrong with your domain connection, SSL certificates won't work. To ensure your domain is eligible for an SSL certificate:\n\nIf you’re using a third-party domain, it needs to be connected correctly. To check if there's an issue preventing SSL for your domain, review your DNS records in Squarespace.\n\nIf you're using a Squarespace domain, it must point to a Squarespace site. If your domain or subdomain is pointing away from Squarespace, contact your website host about an SSL certificate instead.\n\nDomain names must be 63 characters or less to receive an SSL certificate.\n\nChecking your SSL certificate status\n\nSSL is automatically enabled. You don't need to do anything to set it up. To ensure your SSL certificate is active, do one of the following:\n\nOpen your domains dashboard, then click the domain and ensure your SSL certificate status is Issued\n\nOpen the SSL panel and ensure your certificate status is Active\n\nCheck your site’s SSL certificate by visiting your site\n\nChoose SSL settings\n\nIf you have more complex security needs, you may need to change other settings.\n\nTo choose an SSL setting:\n\nOpen the SSL panel.\n\nUnder Security preference, choose your settings. Usually, we recommend checking Secure and HSTS secure. Some special situations might need the Insecure option. For help, see SSL settings explained.\n\nClick Save.\n\nIt can take up to 72 hours for the update to complete. For third-party domains that aren't connected yet, it may take a bit longer.\n\nWhile the certificate is processing, you may find an error message in your domain settings. This is normal. If it's been more than 72 hours, follow these troubleshooting steps.\n\nSSL settings explained\n\nSecure (Preferred)\n\nSecure (Preferred) is the default setting that most sites need, along with HSTS enabled. Some domain providers and TLDs require it.\n\nSecure means:\n\nVisitors are always redirected to HTTPS after the certificate is issued, even if they entered HTTP in their browser.\n\nSitemaps include HTTPS links.\n\nSearch engines index the HTTPS version, which is good for SEO.\n\nYour site won't load in browsers that don't support SSL.\n\nHSTS Secure\n\nIf you’re using the Secure setting, we recommend keeping HSTS Secure enabled. HSTS Secure encrypts the connection and prevents potential attackers from accessing or impersonating your site. We recommend having your site Secure with HSTS Secure enabled on your site because it ensures your site loads securely. Having an HSTS Secure site also prevents error messages from loading, such as “Your connection is not private”.\n\nInsecure\n\nDomains registered or connected before October 2016 are set to Insecure. If you decide to keep your site Insecure, ensure the domain’s SSL certificate is valid. Insecure means:\n\nVisitors can access your site over both HTTP and HTTPS.\n\nSitemaps include HTTP links.\n\nSearch engines index the HTTP version.\n\nDisabling HSTS or switching to the Insecure setting can temporarily prevent access to your site. Anyone who visited while HSTS was enabled will be blocked from your site until their HSTS policy for the site expires, which can take up to 72 hours.\n\nSSL and commerce checkout\n\nYour checkout page is protected by SSL to protect credit card information. Checkout pages are also Level 1 PCI compliant and use 128 bit SSL encryption. The checkout page is always secure, even if your site is using the Insecure SSL setting.\n\nIf your site is on the Commerce Basic or Advanced plan and Secure is checked, visitors will see your custom domain in the checkout URL.\n\nCustom code and SSL warnings (mixed content)\n\nSome pages on your site may have mixed content, meaning the page loads over a secure HTTPS connection, but some content loads over an insecure HTTP connection. Insecure content can come from mixed content such as:\n\nIntegrations\n\nCode-based customizations\n\nCustom code\n\nIf you choose the Secure setting, visitors may find browser warnings when they load mixed content from your site. To avoid this, edit your mixed content to fix error messages and loading issues.\n\nNote: Custom code and mixed content modifications fall outside the scope of our support. This means that we’re unable to help further with setup or troubleshooting. Additionally, with a code-based solution, we can’t guarantee its functionality or full compatibility with Squarespace. This includes how it functions with our responsive design, particularly its appearance on mobile devices, and if it functions on all templates. Custom code can also cause display issues with future updates to our platform. While we can't help further, there are many resources that can point you in the right direction:\n\nLearn best practices for adding custom code.\n\nRead our general guide on third-party customizations.\n\nVisit Squarespace Forum, our customer and developer community.\n\nHire a Squarespace Expert to help build custom code for your site.\n\nCheck a site's SSL certificate\n\nTo check if SSL is protecting a page, look for a URL beginning with https:// and a closed padlock icon next to it.\n\nYou can view a domain's SSL details in most browsers, which can include information like the issuing certificate authority and how long the certificate is valid. To learn how to check if a site's connection is secure, visit your browser's documentation:\n\nGoogle Chrome\n\nFirefox\n\nTechnical details\n\nHere are some technical details about our SSL certificates:\n\nLet's Encrypt is our certificate authority partner for providing DV (Domain-Validated) SSL certificates that refresh every 90 days.\n\n2048-bit SSL encryption on all pages except checkout.\n\nTLS version 1.2 for all HTTPS connections.\n\nHTTP Public Key Pinning (HPKP) isn't currently supported.\n\nYou don't need a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) to get an SSL certificate. We issue certificates automatically.\n\nThird-party SSL providers\n\nWe don't support installing third-party SSL certificates. If you use another SSL provider, like CloudFlare, you can switch to Squarespace's certificate.\n\nTo use Squarespace's SSL, disconnect your domain from your SSL provider and connect it from your domain provider or transfer it to Squarespace. After the domain is fully connected and using Squarespace DNS records, we'll generate a certificate.\n\nYour site’s existing HTTPS traffic will be unavailable while your DNS changes process and we generate the certificate. During this time, you may see a certificate error in your SSL panel.\n\nFAQ\n\nWhat is SSL?\n\nSSL (Secure Sockets Layer), is a technology that secures the connection between your browser and the website you’re visiting. All modern computer and mobile browsers support SSL. Websites using SSL will have URLs beginning with https://.\n\nWhat are the benefits of SSL?\n\nSSL protection has many benefits, including:\n\nCreates trust with visitors by showing their information is secure and encrypted on your site.\n\nPrevents hackers from stealing data visitors submit through your site's forms and checkout page, including personal information.\n\nMay help your site load faster.\n\nHelps with SEO.\n\nCan I disable SSL?\n\nIt’s not possible to remove SSL certificates because they keep your site secure and ensure the best experience for your visitors. However, you can choose the Insecure setting so visitors can still use the HTTP version, even with SSL enabled.\n\nDoes SSL slow down my site?\n\nIt can take a few extra seconds to authenticate a certificate and validate a site using the Secure setting. If you notice a big difference in load time, use our troubleshooting steps to check for other reasons your site might be loading slowly.\n\nDoes SSL work for subdomains?\n\nYes. Squarespace generates a certificate for each custom domain and subdomain connected to your website. This is also true for the \"www\" version of your domain, if you're using it separately from your naked domain.\n\nIf you're using your subdomain as your site's primary domain, uncheck Use WWW Prefix to prevent certificate errors.\n\nIf you have a third-party domain, ensure that it’s connected in your site’s Domains panel and not forwarded or pointed to another location.\n\nDo I need to set my SSL to \"Secure\" to keep my account details private?\n\nNo. With any SSL setting, your site login password is always encrypted, and you're automatically redirected to a secure session to modify sensitive account information.\n\nDoes Squarespace 5 include SSL?\n\nSSL is included in Squarespace 5.
