        "text": "Verisign Wants Your Misspellings\n\n16 Sep 2003 by Scott Upton\n\nSlashdot and many others are reporting that Verisign is now redirecting misspelled domain names to its new “Site Finder” service. According to their implementation overview (PDF) Verisign’s rationale can be summed up accordingly:\n\nVerisign’s Site Finder service improves the user web browsing experience when the user has submitted a query for a non-existent second-level domain in the .com and .net top-level domains. Before this service was implemented, when a user entered a URL containing a non-existent (e.g. unregistered) domain name ending in .com or .net, his or her web browser returned an error message that contained no useful information. With the rollout of Site Finder, in the same situation users now receive a helpful web page offering links to possible intended destinations and allowing an internet search.\n\nNow, I’m all for giving users a chance to get back on track efficiently, but this stinks of marketing opportunism. Whereas before you could use IE if you wanted such assistance or Mozilla/Safari if you did not, Verisign is taking this “help” up the food chain and out of your hands. Additionally, your FTP, SSH, Ping, and Traceroute queries to incorrect domains will now all register that you connected to the host you asked for rather than returning “host unknown.” Thanks for complicating our troubleshooting, Verisign!"
