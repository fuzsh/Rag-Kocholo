        "text": "Choose the A/R account you want selected by default on receivables transactions.\n\nYou can set a default A/R account on customer records by editing the record, clicking the Financial subtab, and selecting an A/R account in the Default Receivables Account field.\n\nWhen the Use Item Cost as Transfer Cost preference is disabled, the transfer price on a transfer order is used as the item cost on the item receipt. Any difference between the actual cost and the transfer price posts to a Gain/Loss account when the item is shipped.\n\nIn this field, select the default Gain/Loss account to use for posting transfer cost discrepancies. This account autofills the Gain/Loss Account field on item records you create.\n\nThe account you select must be different from the Asset or Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) account for the item.\n\nYou can choose an Income account, Other Income account, Expense account, or Other Expense account.\n\nNote:\n\nIf you have enabled the Expand Account Lists preference, you can choose any account in this field.\n\nIf you leave this field blank or select Use Income Account, the income account for the item is used.\n\nSelect the default account for posting variances in billing quantities associated with this item. These variances occur when there is a difference in the quantity of an item showing on the receipt and the quantity of an item showing on the bill. The account you select defaults to show in the Bill Quantity Variance Account field on item records you create.\n\nNote:\n\nAfter you select a variance account in this field, you can select another account at a later date if a change is necessary. Account changes are noted on the System Notes subtab of the History subtab of item records.\n\nSelect the default account for posting variances in billing prices associated with this item. These variances occur when there is a difference in the price of an item showing on the purchase order and the price of an item showing on the bill. The account you select defaults to show in the Bill Price Variance Account field on item records you create.\n\nNote:\n\nAfter you select a variance account in this field, you can select another account at a later date if a change is necessary. Account changes are noted on the System Notes subtab of the History subtab of item records.\n\nSelect the default account for posting variances in exchange rates associated with this item. These variances occur when there are exchange rate differences between the receipt and the bill for an item. The account you select defaults to show in the Bill Price Variance Account field on item records you create.\n\nNote:\n\nAfter you select a variance account in this field, you can select another account at a later date if a change is necessary. Account changes are noted on the System Notes subtab of the History subtab of item records.\n\nSelect a default account for posting variances that result from unbuilding an assembly item. The account you select shows by default in the Unbuild Variance Account field on item records.\n\nIf the Unbuild Variance Account field is left blank on item record, variance amounts for the item post to the Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) account.\n\nNote:\n\nIn NetSuite OneWorld, even when a default is set, this account defaults to be blank if the default account is not available to the subsidiary on the form.\n\nSelect the default stage for fixed date charge rules. Charges created in the Ready stage are ready to be billed. Charges created in the Hold stage will not be billed until they are moved to the Ready stage. Select Hold if you have an approval process in place for new charges.\n\nSelect the default stage for milestone charge rules. Charges created in the Ready stage are ready to be billed. Charges created in the Hold stage will not be billed until they are moved to the Ready stage. Select Hold if you have an approval process in place for new charges.\n\nSelect the default stage for project progress charge rules. Charges created in the Ready stage are ready to be billed. Charges created in the Hold stage will not be billed until they are moved to the Ready stage. Select Hold if you have an approval process in place for new charges.\n\nSelect the default stage for time-based charge rules. Charges created in the Ready stage are ready to be billed. Charges created in the Hold stage will not be billed until they are moved to the Ready stage. Select Hold if you have an approval process in place for new charges.\n\nCheck this box to consolidate inventory purchasing into one location, if you handle inventory in several locations. When this preference is enabled, you can order and receive all inventory in only one location and then transfer it to your other locations.\n\nFor information about creating purchase orders, see Purchase Order Management. For information about moving inventory to different locations after receipt, see Distributing Inventory.\n\nWhen enabled, any created transaction that changes inventory levels and includes an item that uses bins requires you to select a bin for the item to save the transaction. If there is no bin field on a transaction such as sales orders and purchase orders, bins are not required. Note that Item Receipts do not require a bin selection, even with this preference enabled.\n\nDisable this preference to permit transactions to be created that include items with no bin selected. Note that even with this preference disabled, NetSuite always requires bins on transactions where an item quantity is reduced such as on cash sales, item fulfillments, or negative inventory adjustments. Bins are not required on transactions where an item quantity is increased such as purchases and positive inventory adjustments.\n\nCheck this box to configure labels to be printed by quantity. For example, consider an item receipt that has a line for Lot Item A, with a quantity of 12. By default, with the Print Lot Item Labels From Transactions By Quantity box cleared, one item label is printed for Lot Item A. If you check the box, 12 item labels are printed for Lot Item A.\n\nIf you use the Supply Allocation and Material Requirements Planning features, you can select a planning rule group that provides the default lead time for transfer orders, including intercompany transfer orders. This lead time is used to calculate the Expected Receipt Date for items replenished through either of the following methods only: Material Requirements Planning or Master Production Schedule.\n\nFor more information, see Creating Planning Rule Groups.\n\nIf you use the Inventory Count feature, you can check this box to take a new inventory snapshot when you reject a count. Based on the new snapshot, NetSuite recalculates the adjustment quantity and variance.\n\nThe new snapshot replaces the initial one that is taken when you start a count. If you process transactions during a count, NetSuite considers any on-hand quantity updates when you approve the rejected count. For more information, see Setting Up Inventory Count.\n\nChoose your inventory costing from Average, Group Average, First In First Out (FIFO), or Last In First Out (LIFO). The costing method you choose determines how you manage the costs associated with buying the same items at different purchase prices over a specified time period.\n\nFor details about costing methods, read Costing Methods.\n\nWhen you use the Multi-Location Inventory feature with the Group Average Costing feature, you can choose to include the account values for group average cost items that are in transit between locations. This allows in-transit inventory accounts to be balanced during the bulk process.\n\nEnabling this preference helps produce more accurate costing calculations and financial statement reporting by ensuring the group average cost reflects the assets of both on-hand and in-transit inventory accounts.\n\nClear this box to exclude the asset values of in-transit inventory accounts during the Balance Location Costing\n\nCheck this box to include the asset values of in-transit inventory accounts during the Balance Location Costing Group Accounts bulk process.\n\nNote the following when this preference is enabled:\n\nWhen this preference is enabled, the Create and Edit Inventory Transactions Dated in Closed Periods preference must be disabled.\n\nTransfer Orders and Intercompany Transfer Orders are required to enable the Use Item Cost as Transfer Cost preference. For details about this preference, read Transfer Order Preferences.\n\nItems set to use the Group Average costing method are not allowed to be added to intercompany purchases or sales. To transfer items between subsidiaries, they must be moved using an intercompany transfer order.\n\nTransfer Orders and Intercompany Transfer Orders cannot include both items that use Standard costing and items that use Group Average costing.\n\nNote:\n\nNetSuite recommends that if you plan to enable the Include In-Transit in Group Average Cost Calculations preference, you should do so immediately after enabling the Group Average Costing feature. The setting for this preference cannot be changed after any item with a Group Average costing method has had costing calculations run.\n\nCheck this box to require authorization for customers' credit cards on sales orders placed by Customer Center users logged in to NetSuite. To use this feature, you must have an Internet Merchant Solutions (IMS) account and you must set up a credit card processing profile at Setup > Accounting > Payment Processing Profiles. When customers order from your Customer Center, IMS automatically processes their credit cards and Verisign validates the payments. Authorization numbers automatically appear on the appropriate sales orders. For information about setting up customer credit card processing, see Setting Up Customer Credit Card Processing.\n\nThe option here is different from the Process an online payment with sales order creation option at Commerce > Websites > Website List. For more information about requiring authorization on credit card transactions, see Require Authorization for Credit Card Transactions.\n\nThe Get Authorization on Customer Center Sales Order option applies to sales orders placed by Customer Center users logged in to the NetSuite application.\n\nThe Require Authorization on Credit Card Transactions option Web site preference applies to sales orders placed by customers logged in to your Web site.\n\nYou can enable one of these options at a time or both of them together.\n\nChoose to add a field for your customers' Card Security Code (CSC) numbers on sales transactions. It also requires your customers to enter CSC numbers during the checkout process in your Customer Center or Web site. This feature can help prevent fraudulent orders.\n\nNote:\n\nTo verify CSC numbers on your Web site, you must enable Require Authorization on Credit Card Transactions at Commerce > Websites > Website List. To verify CSV numbers for orders placed by Customer Center users logged in to NetSuite, you must enable the Get Authorization on Customer Center Sales Orders option. These options are available only after you add a credit card processing profile at Setup > Accounting > Payment Processing Profiles.\n\nClear this box if you do not want payments to be marked as recurring on the following transactions:\n\nsales orders that use the Sales Order - Cash Sale form and have billing schedules\n\nmemorized cash sale sales orders\n\nNote:\n\nSome credit card processing profiles do not support recurring payment authorization requests.\n\nIf this box is checked, whenever a credit card authorization request is declined due to expired credit card, a second request is sent with the expiration date updated to ensure that recurring payments are not interrupted. For more information, see Maintaining Recurring Credit Card Payments.\n\nCheck this box to enable using payment processing profiles that do not support authorization and instead support the sales request. When you check this box and use this type of profiles on sales orders, funds are immediately captured from the shopper's account and associated with the sales order as a customer deposit. For more information, see Alternative Non-Credit Card Payment Methods for Web Store Orders.\n\nTo use this feature, you must have a merchant account provided by the gateway or the payment service provider.\n\nCheck this box to display only payment processing profiles that support all of the following requirements:\n\nThe selected payment method\n\nThe customerâs currency\n\nThe customerâs subsidiary (NetSuite OneWorld only)\n\nIf this preference is enabled, and there is no payment method supported by the shopperâs currency, no credit card payment method shows on the Payment Information page of your website.\n\nThis preference takes precedence over the Restrict Payment Methods by Customer Currency preference on the Shopping subtab at Commerce > Websites > Website List. For more information, see Restricting Payment Processing Profiles by Customer Data.\n\nChoose to receive duplicate number warnings when transactions are submitted with the same numbers.\n\nIf you import transactions and use the Advanced Numbering feature, NetSuite responds to duplicates according to these settings. When you import a transaction, NetSuite determines which advanced numbering rule applies to it using your rules' criteria. It then checks if a transaction with the same document numbers already exist for the same rule. If a duplicate is detected, NetSuite uses your Duplicate Number Warnings preference as described below.\n\nChoose between the following:\n\nNo Warnings â Users are not warned when the transaction they are saving will create a duplicate document number.\n\nIf you import transactions and use Advanced Numbering, NetSuite does not warn you when the imported transactions use duplicate document numbers and imports all transactions.\n\nWarn (UI only) â Users receive a message when attempting to save a transaction record with the same document number as another record of the same type. When the warning is displayed, a user can enter a different number before attempting to save again.\n\nIf you import transactions and use Advanced Numbering, NetSuite does not warn you when the imported transactions use duplicate document numbers and imports all transactions.\n\nWarn and Block - Users receive a message when attempting to save a transaction record with the same number as another record of the same type. When the warning is displayed, the user must click Cancel and change the document number in the record.\n\nIf you import transactions and use Advanced Numbering, NetSuite warns you when imported transactions create duplicate document numbers, and does not import these transactions.\n\nCheck this box to indicate that items can be returned only if the quantity returned is equal to or greater than the minimum quantity attribute on the item record. For example, to save a return authorization for an item that has a minimum quantity of five, you must enter a return quantity of five or more.\n\nSee Sales Information for Items for more information about item minimum quantity."
