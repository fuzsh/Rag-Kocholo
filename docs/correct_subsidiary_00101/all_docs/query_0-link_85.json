Please see the section, Other Information.\n\nBulletin Information\n\nExecutive Summaries\n\nThe following table summarizes the security bulletins for this month in order of severity.\n\nFor details on affected software, see the next section, Affected Software and Download Locations.\n\nBulletin ID Bulletin Title and Executive Summary Maximum Severity Rating and Vulnerability Impact Restart Requirement Affected Software MS09-018 Vulnerabilities in Active Directory Could Allow Remote Code Execution (971055)\\ \\ This security update resolves two privately reported vulnerabilities in implementations of Active Directory on Microsoft Windows 2000 Server and Windows Server 2003, and Active Directory Application Mode (ADAM) when installed on Windows XP Professional and Windows Server 2003. The more severe vulnerability could allow remote code execution. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system remotely. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Firewall best practices and standard default firewall configurations can help protect networks from attacks that originate outside the enterprise perimeter. Best practices recommend that systems that are connected to the Internet have a minimal number of ports exposed. Critical \\ Remote Code Execution Requires restart Microsoft Windows MS09-022 Vulnerabilities in Windows Print Spooler Could Allow Remote Code Execution (961501)\\ \\ This security update resolves three privately reported vulnerabilities in Windows Print Spooler. The most severe vulnerability could allow remote code execution if an affected server received a specially crafted RPC request. Firewall best practices and standard default firewall configurations can help protect networks from attacks that originate outside the enterprise perimeter. Best practices recommend that systems that are connected to the Internet have a minimal number of ports exposed. Critical \\ Remote Code Execution Requires restart Microsoft Windows MS09-019 Cumulative Security Update for Internet Explorer (969897)\\ \\ This security update resolves seven privately reported vulnerabilities and one publicly disclosed vulnerability in Internet Explorer. The more severe of the vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution if a user views a specially crafted Web page using Internet Explorer. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights. Critical \\ Remote Code Execution Requires restart Microsoft Windows, Internet Explorer MS09-027 Vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office Word Could Allow Remote Code Execution (969514)\\ \\ This security update resolves two privately reported vulnerabilities that could allow remote code execution if a user opens a specially crafted Word file. An attacker who successfully exploited either vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Critical \\ Remote Code Execution May require restart Microsoft Office MS09-021 Vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office Excel Could Allow Remote Code Execution (969462)\\ \\ This security update resolves several privately reported vulnerabilities that could allow remote code execution if a user opens a specially crafted Excel file that includes a malformed record object. An attacker who successfully exploited any of these vulnerabilities could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Critical \\ Remote Code Execution May require restart Microsoft Office MS09-024 Vulnerability in Microsoft Works Converters Could Allow Remote Code Execution (957632)\\ \\ This security update resolves a privately reported vulnerability in the Microsoft Works converters. The vulnerability could allow remote code execution if a user opens a specially crafted Works file. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights. Critical \\ Remote Code Execution May require restart Microsoft Office MS09-026 Vulnerability in RPC Could Allow Elevation of Privilege (970238)\\ \\ This security update resolves a publicly disclosed vulnerability in the Windows remote procedure call (RPC) facility where the RPC Marshalling Engine does not update its internal state appropriately. The vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code and take complete control of an affected system. Supported editions of Microsoft Windows are not delivered with any RPC servers or clients that are subject to exploitation of this vulnerability. In a default configuration, users could not be attacked by exploitation of this vulnerability. However, the vulnerability is present in the Microsoft Windows RPC runtime and could affect third-party RPC applications. Important \\ Elevation of Privilege Requires restart Microsoft Windows MS09-025 Vulnerabilities in Windows Kernel Could Allow Elevation of Privilege (968537)\\ \\ This security update resolves two publicly disclosed and two privately reported vulnerabilities in the Windows kernel that could allow elevation of privilege. An attacker who successfully exploited any of these vulnerabilities could execute arbitrary code and take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. An attacker must have valid logon credentials and be able to log on locally to exploit these vulnerabilities. The vulnerabilities could not be exploited remotely or by anonymous users. Important \\ Elevation of Privilege Requires restart Microsoft Windows MS09-020 Vulnerabilities in Internet Information Services (IIS) Could Allow Elevation of Privilege (970483)\\ \\ This security update resolves one publicly disclosed vulnerability and one privately reported vulnerability in Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS). The vulnerabilities could allow elevation of privilege if an attacker sent a specially crafted HTTP request to a Web site that requires authentication. These vulnerabilities allow an attacker to bypass the IIS configuration that specifies which type of authentication is allowed, but not the file system-based access control list (ACL) check that verifies whether a file is accessible by a given user. Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities would still restrict the attacker to the permissions granted to the anonymous user account by the file system ACLs. Important \\ Elevation of Privilege Requires restart Microsoft Windows MS09-023 Vulnerability in Windows Search Could Allow Information Disclosure (963093)\\ \\ This security update resolves a privately reported vulnerability in Windows Search. The vulnerability could allow information disclosure if a user performs a search that returns a specially crafted file as the first result or if the user previews a specially crafted file from the search results. By default, the Windows Search component is not preinstalled on Microsoft Windows XP and Windows Server 2003. It is an optional component available for download. Windows Search installed on supported editions of Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008 is not affected by this vulnerability. Moderate \\ Information Disclosure Requires restart Microsoft Windows\n\nExploitability Index\n\nThe following table provides an exploitability assessment of each of the vulnerabilities addressed this month.

For more information about the Microsoft Update Catalog, see the Microsoft Update Catalog FAQ.\n\nDetection and Deployment Guidance\n\nMicrosoft has provided detection and deployment guidance for this monthâs security updates. This guidance will also help IT professionals understand how they can use various tools to help deploy the security update, such as Windows Update, Microsoft Update, Office Update, the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA), the Office Detection Tool, Microsoft Systems Management Server (SMS), and the Extended Security Update Inventory Tool (ESUIT). For more information, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 910723.\n\nMicrosoft Baseline Security Analyzer\n\nThe Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) allows administrators to scan local and remote systems for missing security updates as well as common security misconfigurations. For more information about MBSA, visit Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer.\n\nWindows Server Update Services\n\nBy using Windows Server Update Services (WSUS), administrators can quickly and reliably deploy the latest critical updates and security updates for Windows 2000 operating systems and later, Office XP and later, Exchange Server 2003, and SQL Server 2000 to Windows 2000 and later operating systems.\n\nFor more information about how to deploy this security update using Windows Server Update Services, visit Windows Server Update Services.\n\nSystems Management Server\n\nMicrosoft Systems Management Server (SMS) delivers a highly-configurable enterprise solution for managing updates. By using SMS, administrators can identify Windows-based systems that require security updates and to perform controlled deployment of these updates throughout the enterprise with minimal disruption to end users. The next release of SMS, System Center Configuration Manager 2007, is now available; see also System Center Configuration Manager 2007. For more information about how administrators can use SMS 2003 to deploy security updates, see SMS 2003 Security Patch Management. SMS 2.0 users can also use the Software Updates Services Feature Pack to help deploy security updates. For information about SMS, visit Microsoft Systems Management Server.\n\nNote SMS uses the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer and the Microsoft Office Detection Tool to provide broad support for security bulletin update detection and deployment. Some software updates may not be detected by these tools. Administrators can use the inventory capabilities of the SMS in these cases to target updates to specific systems. For more information about this procedure, see Deploying Software Updates Using the SMS Software Distribution Feature. Some security updates require administrative rights following a restart of the system. Administrators can use the Elevated Rights Deployment Tool (available in the SMS 2003 Administration Feature Pack and in the SMS 2.0 Administration Feature Pack) to install these updates.\n\nUpdate Compatibility Evaluator and Application Compatibility Toolkit\n\nUpdates often write to the same files and registry settings required for your applications to run. This can trigger incompatibilities and increase the time it takes to deploy security updates. You can streamline testing and validating Windows updates against installed applications with the Update Compatibility Evaluator components included with Application Compatibility Toolkit 5.0.\n\nThe Application Compatibility Toolkit (ACT) contains the necessary tools and documentation to evaluate and mitigate application compatibility issues before deploying Microsoft Windows Vista, a Windows Update, a Microsoft Security Update, or a new version of Windows Internet Explorer in your environment.\n\nOther Information\n\nMicrosoft Windows Malicious Software Removal Tool\n\nMicrosoft has released an updated version of the Microsoft Windows Malicious Software Removal Tool on Windows Update, Microsoft Update, Windows Server Update Services, and the Download Center.\n\nFor information about non-security releases on Windows Update and Microsoft Update, please see:\n\nMicrosoft Knowledge Base Article 894199: Description of Software Update Services and Windows Server Update Services changes in content. Includes all Windows content.\n\nNew, Revised, and Released Updates for Microsoft Products Other Than Microsoft Windows.\n\nMicrosoft Active Protections Program (MAPP)\n\nTo improve security protections for customers, Microsoft provides vulnerability information to major security software providers in advance of each monthly security update release. Security software providers can then use this vulnerability information to provide updated protections to customers via their security software or devices, such as antivirus, network-based intrusion detection systems, or host-based intrusion prevention systems. To determine whether active protections are available from security software providers, please visit the active protections Web sites provided by program partners, listed in Microsoft Active Protections Program (MAPP) Partners.\n\nSecurity Strategies and Community\n\nUpdate Management Strategies\n\nSecurity Guidance for Update Management provides additional information about Microsoftâs best-practice recommendations for applying security updates.\n\nObtaining Other Security Updates\n\nUpdates for other security issues are available from the following locations:\n\nSecurity updates are available from Microsoft Download Center. You can find them most easily by doing a keyword search for \"security update\".\n\nUpdates for consumer platforms are available from Microsoft Update.\n\nYou can obtain the security updates offered this month on Windows Update, from Download Center on Security and Critical Releases ISO CD Image files.
