        "text": "March 30th, 2019\n\nphoto courtesy of technologyreview.com\n\nThe King has Left the Building\n\nJeremy King, Walmart’s Chief Technology Officer for the past 8 years is leaving the company. Mr. King is taking his talents from Bentonville, Arkansas to Silicon Valley. Specifically, to pre-IPO unicorn Pinterest, where he will serve as the company’s Chief Engineering Officer reporting directly to the CEO. CNBC reports that he will be accountable for Pinterest’s “visual discovery engine” that recommends posts and images to Pinterest users. Pinterest had Mr. King pinned on their board as he represents a splashy technical hire that is strategically happening before the company files for an IPO.\n\nKing will be replacing Pinterest’s outgoing head of engineering Li Fan who is scooting to become the head of engineering for Lime.\n\nAs the head of Walmart Labs, King was instrumental in revamping the company’s e-commerce technology and bringing cutting edge innovations to stores such as automated shelf scanning robots, in-store pickup and grocery delivery. He led the company through more than 10 acquisitions and spearheaded the organization’s transition to the cloud (although not the Amazon Cloud for obvious competitive reasons).\n\nHe also championed open source development at Walmart due to the company’s “build rather than buy” philosophy. The organization has historically held the belief that their information systems provide a competitive advantage over other industry players. Additionally, a third party developing custom systems for an organization the size of Walmart would encounter a Herculean task. The Wall Street Journal quoted King as stating, “You would be surprised at the list of companies that have completely choked on Walmart’s scale, because no one really builds products for Fortune One,”.\n\nKing’s last day with Walmart is March 29th 2019.\n\nJetBlack\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported on Walmart’s upscale, member’s only, text to order service that is targeted to wealthy NYC moms. For $50 a month, a small beta group in Manhattan will have access to personal shoppers/couriers that will white-glove deliver any non-food item on the same day as the order. The service, named “JetBlack”, is being helmed by Jenny Fleiss of Rent the Runway fame.\n\nThe items are wrapped in black (the “Black” in JetBlack) and the idea is a pet project of Jet.com co-founder Marc Lore (the “Jet” in JetBlack). Currently, the initiative is not profitable but its larger aim is to train AI powered systems that could one day “..power an automated personal-shopping service, preparing Walmart for a time when the search bar disappears and more shopping is done through voice-activated devices,” per Jenny Fleiss. JetBlack is essentially a research initiative on AI.\n\nSurprisingly, the service does not restrict users to items only available through Walmart properties and subsidiaries. If a customer wants an Amazon product, then JetBlack will complete the request. Why the customer wouldn’t just order off Amazon themselves is anyone’s guess.\n\nWalmart will be able to inventory the products that their members use after an initial in home visit and the company is building up a trove of data on the products that their wealthy clients order. In this age of data as power, Walmart is taking steps to gather valuable data on upscale clientele which could prove useful in its ongoing battle with Amazon.\n\nWalmart Games?\n\nA number of established tech players have announced or not officially announced their intentions to bring video game streaming to the masses; “Netflix for gaming” is the metaphor. Removing expensive hardware from the gamer equation and running games from giant data centers enables gamers to game with nothing more than a browser, tablet or smart phone.\n\nGoogle made a big splash recently when it unveiled its cloud based gaming platform named Stadia at the 2019 Game Developers Conference. Microsoft has xCLoud, Amazon has a yet unnamed gaming platform and even Verizon is testing a gaming app on Nvidia Shield.\n\nWalmart, yes Walmart is also rumored to be in on the action with the development of their own streaming game platform. Before we dismiss this as a flight of fancy, consider that Walmart already owns streaming video platform Vudu, where it can leverage existing technology and resources.\n\nIt is not known how far along Walmart is in the development process but I would suspect that this initiative is once again driven by the need to keep pace with Amazon.\n\nFor more Walmart technology coverage please check out Part 1, Part 2 and Part 3 of my series on Walmart’s overall technology strategy.\n\nAdditional Walmart technology coverage can be found here\n\nThe Definitive Walmart Technology Review\n\nThe Definitive Walmart E-Commerce and Digital Strategy Post\n\nIf you’re interested in Business Intelligence & Tableau check out my videos here: Anthony B.

I put together a relatively simple dashboard to help illustrate a few intermediate level concepts. In this first video I take a look at the number of total assists by NBA players during the 2017-2018 season. In case you were wondering, Russell Westbrook led the league in assists during that season. If you don’t know who Russell Westbrook is, then skip this Tableau stuff and watch the last video immediately (and then come back to the Tableau stuff).\n\nIn the first Tableau dashboard video, you’ll learn two concepts:\n\nHow to make rounded bar charts;\n\nHow to filter the number of bar chart marks via use of a parameter;\n\nPart 2: Apply Custom Sorting in Tableau\n\nIn the second video I build upon the dashboard built in the first video by showing you how to add a custom sort. The custom sort relies upon the creation of a parameter and a calculated field. The parameter and calculated field enable the user to select either a dimension (e.g., Player Name) or a measure (e.g., sum of assists) from a drop down box and the visualization will sort ascending or descending as requested.\n\nThe calculated field relies upon the RANK_UNIQUE function.\n\nIn this context, RANK_UNIQUE returns the unique rank of each player’s assist total. The key with RANK_UNIQUE is that identical values are assigned different ranks. As an example, the set of values (6, 9, 9, 14) would be ranked (4, 2, 3, 1), as no tied rankings are allowed.\n\nPart 3: Interact with the Dashboard\n\nBonus: Russell Westbrook on the Attack\n\nFor those of you who do not know who Russell Westbrook is, I’ve got you covered. These aren’t assists but in these situations, he didn’t need to pass!\n\nReferences:\n\nThanks to both the Tableau Magic blog for outlining the concept of rounded bar charts and the VizJockey blog for the custom sort methodology. Check out and support these blogs!\n\nAs always, do great things with your data!\n\nIf you find this type of instruction valuable make sure to subscribe to my YouTube channel.\n\nAll views and opinions are solely my own and do NOT necessarily reflect those of my employer.\n\nIn this video I tackle the subject of slope graphs also known as slope charts. I had some fun putting together this dashboard that illustrates the changes in wins for NBA teams during the 2016-2017 and 2017-2018 seasons. From the video you’ll discover that Chicago, Atlanta and Memphis are on a Hindenburg-like trajectory, while trusting the process in Philadelphia led to huge season gains in overall wins.\n\nHere’s what you will learn from this video:\n\nHow to create a parameter that enables a user to select which win statistic measure to visualize;\n\nHow to use Table calculations like, LOOKUP(), FIRST() and LAST() to calculate period over period change;\n\nHow the impact of Mike Conley’s injury affected the Memphis Grizzlies last season;\n\nClick the pic to interact with the Tableau Public visualization, also download the workbook and data to dissect as needed.\n\nFor your convenience the calculated fields that I used to create the measures are listed here. Note that [Selected Measure] is a parameter that you need to create that lists all of the measures.\n\nCalc Select Measure\n\nCASE [Selected Measure]\n\nWHEN “Home Losses” Then [Home Losses]\n\nWHEN “Home Wins” Then [Home Wins]\n\nWHEN “Overall Losses” Then [Overall Losses]\n\nWHEN “Overall Wins” Then [Overall Wins]\n\nWHEN “Road Losses” Then [Road Losses]\n\nWHEN “Road Wins” Then [Road Wins]\n\nWHEN “vs East Conf Losses” Then [vs East Conf Losses]\n\nWHEN “vs East Conf Wins” Then [vs East Conf Wins]\n\nWHEN “vs West Conf Losses” Then [vs West Conf Losses]\n\nWHEN “vs West Conf Wins” Then [vs West Conf Wins]\n\nEND\n\nBetter or Worse\n\nIF [Selected Measure] = “Home Wins” OR\n\n[Selected Measure] = “Overall Wins” OR\n\n[Selected Measure] = “Road Wins” OR\n\n[Selected Measure] = “vs East Conf Wins” OR\n\n[Selected Measure] = “vs West Conf Wins”\n\nTHEN\n\n//WIN MEASURES: Negative delta treated as “WORSE”, Positive delta treated as “BETTER”\n\n(IF [Delta] < 0 THEN “WORSE” ELSEIF [Delta] = 0 THEN “SAME” ELSE “BETTER” END)\n\nELSE\n\n//LOSS MEASURES: Positive delta treated as “WORSE” (more losses are worse), Negative delta treated as “BETTER”\n\n(IF [Delta] > 0 THEN “WORSE” ELSEIF [Delta] = 0 THEN “SAME” ELSE “BETTER” END)\n\nEND\n\nDelta\n\nLOOKUP(SUM([Calc Select Measure]),LAST()) – LOOKUP(SUM([Calc Select Measure]),FIRST())\n\nDelta ABS Value\n\nABS(LOOKUP(SUM([Calc Select Measure]),LAST()) – LOOKUP(SUM([Calc Select Measure]),FIRST()))\n\nToolTip\n\n<Team> Trend: <AGG(Better or Worse)> by <AGG(Delta ABS Value)>\n\nDuring the <Season> Season, the <Team> had <SUM(Calc Select Measure)> <Parameters.Selected Measure>.\n\nI have to give thanks to Ben Jones at the Data Remixed blog for the inspiration!\n\nAs always, If you find this type of instruction valuable make sure to subscribe to my YouTube channel.\n\nAll views and opinions are solely my own and do NOT necessarily reflect those of my employer.\n\nIn this video I’ll demonstrate how to use the forecasting analytics option in Power BI. Although Power BI’s forecast algorithm is a black box, it’s more than likely using exponential smoothing to generate results. At a very high level, exponential smoothing is an algorithm that looks for patterns in data and extrapolates that pattern into the future. To help exponential smoothing perform at an optimal level, it is very important to pick an accurate seasonality estimation, as this will have an outsized effect on the time series forecast.\n\nIf your data points are at the daily grain, then you’d use 365 as your seasonality value. If your data points are at a monthly grain, then you’d use 12 as your seasonality value. Generally, the more seasonality cycles (e.g., years) that you provide Power BI, the more predictive your forecast will be.\n\nWithout giving away the whole video, here is a pro and a con of using forecasting in Power BI.\n\nCon: As I stated earlier the exact algorithm is a black box. Although based upon a Power View blog post, we can reasonably assume exponential smoothing is involved. Furthermore, the results cannot be exported into a spreadsheet and analyzed.\n\nPro: The ability to “hindcast” allows you to observe if the forecasted values match your actual values. This ability allows you to judge whether the forecast is performing well.\n\nCheck out the video; I predict you’ll learn something new.\n\nAs always, If you find this type of instruction valuable make sure to subscribe to my Youtube channel.\n\nTwo thousand eighteen was the third year in which I’ve been actively blogging here on AnthonySmoak.com. It’s interesting to look back on my first full year of activity in 2016 and compare the blog’s growth in views and visitors. For my first year of posting back in 2016, I had a little under a 1,000 visitors for the whole year, as compared to 2018 where I had about 28.5 thousand visitors. The past year was also momentous for my Youtube channel as I hit the milestone 1,000 subscribers mark.\n\nI thoroughly enjoy sharing what I learn with people and that’s what keeps me coming back to share more. The positive feedback and the comments I receive from readers and followers make this pastime of mine worth carrying on.\n\nSince I finally have a good sample size of views to draw from, I wanted to share a year in review of the most popular articles here on AnthonySmoak.com for 2018. Although I have a number of Tableau video posts, my most popular posts are related to companies and/or strategy. To my surprise, there seems to be a sizable audience for technology related strategy at Wal-Mart.\n\nI want business intelligence practitioners to come here for their Tableau fix, but I also want business school, management information systems students and anyone else occupying the dual spaces of business and technology (like I’ve done throughout my industry and consulting career) to read my posts on various companies and their uses of technology.\n\nWithout further ado, here are my 10 most popular blog posts over the past year.\n\n1. More Than You Want to Know About Wal-Mart’s Technology Strategy Part 1\n\nPopularity Index Score = 100\n\nBy far this was my most read blog article of the year and the most popular of all time. It is the first part of a three part series that I wrote that takes a look at a few different areas related to Wal-Mart’s use of technology. This post specifically relates to technology infrastructure and IT staffing.\n\n2. Michael Porter’s Generic Cost Leadership Strategy Explained\n\nPopularity Index Score = 90\n\nThis is the first of two posts where I cover the famous business professor’s generic strategies. In this specific post I describe the cost leadership strategy and its advantages and disadvantages. The cost leadership strategy is employed when a company aims to be the lowest cost producer in the market. It enables a business to reap higher than average profitability.\n\n3. Michael Porter’s Generic Differentiation Strategy Explained\n\nPopularity Index Score = 84\n\nAt the opposite side of the generic cost leadership strategy is the differentiation strategy. A differentiation strategy advocates that a business must offer products or services that are valuable and unique to buyers above and beyond a low price.\n\n4. How to Conditionally Format Text Cell Color in Tableau\n\nPopularity Index Score = 82\n\nOf all of my Tableau related videos, this is my personal favorite. I spent many hours researching how to perform this trick for a thoroughly ungrateful party I should add (but I won’t get into that). Tableau is not Excel and table data should be used sparingly in Tableau, but if you have to display table data then do it with style. The upside of my struggle to solve this problem is that I was left with a great video to share with my followers. This video is the 2nd most viewed video on my Youtube channel.\n\n5. How to Fix an Import Specification Error in Microsoft Access\n\nPopularity Index Score = 75\n\nThis post hearkens back to my days as a data analyst for General Motors where I heavily used Microsoft Access. I have a love/hate relationship with Access in that it can be an effective tool for light data work but it has the ability to frustrate you with seemingly nonsensical errors. In this post I share my findings regarding how to overcome an Import Specification Error (Run-Time error ‘3625’). One would think that “import steps” and an import specification can be referenced and used the same way in code, but that is not the case.\n\nArticles 6 -10\n\n6. Strategic Analysis of ADP (Popularity Index: 69)\n\n7. Costco’s Underinvestment in Technology Leaves it Vulnerable to Disruption (Popularity Index: 68)\n\n8. More Than You Want to Know About Wal-Mart’s Technology Strategy Part 2 (Popularity Index: 63)\n\n9. The Definitive Walmart E-Commerce and Digital Strategy Post (Popularity Index: 45)\n\n10. More Than You Want to Know About State Street Bank’s Technology Strategy Part 3\n\n(Popularity Index: 40)\n\nI want to thank everyone who follows AnthonySmoak.com and who also subscribes to me on youtube for their visualization fix. May you have a prosperous year in the making!\n\nSince I’m writing this post on the Martin Luther King holiday I’ll have to close with a quote from Dr. King.\n\n“Life’s most persistent and urgent question is, ‘What are you doing for others?” – Dr. MLK\n\nI repost some of my articles on Medium\n\nAnd of course you can subscribe to my Youtube channel"
