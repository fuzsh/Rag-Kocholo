        "text": "Entered into Contract with US Verisign for Number Access on Wireless Devices.\n\n米ベリサイン社とワイヤレス端末におけるナンバーアクセスについて契約\n\nVeriSign Simplifies Internet Navigationfor Japan s 55 Million Mobile Internet Users\n\nJapanese Partner J-Data Begins Sales of WebNumTM Shortcuts\n\nto Allow Users to Browse Internet Content Quickly and Easily\n\nMountain View, CA and Kyoto, Japan, December 11, 2001 VeriSign, Inc.\n\n(NASDAQ: VRSN), the leading provider of digital trust services, today announced\n\nan agreement with J-Data to enable mobile Internet users in Japan to navigate\n\nthe Internet by entering short, memorable numbers into the keypad of mobile\n\ndevices such as cellular phones and personal digital assistants (PDAs).\n\nJ-Data Co. Ltd. will serve as VeriSign s International Gateway Partner to\n\npromote VeriSign s WebNumTM services to Japan s 55 million mobile Internet\n\nusers. VeriSign s WebNum services enable businesses to register one- to\n\nseven-digit numbers linked to their domain names. These “shortcuts” allow\n\nmobile users to reach Internet sites with speed and efficiency. For example, a\n\nuser who wants to check airfares might type in “1-2-3” to reach an airline site\n\nrather than entering an alphanumeric domain name on a handset s keypad an\n\nexercise that can often entail 50 or more keystrokes. Without WebNum, the user\n\nsimply might not bother.\n\nWe can make it even easier for people to access the Internet using mobile\n\ndevices, and we believe VeriSign’s WebNum service will drive usage of the mobile\n\nInternet in new ways,” said Koji Sasaki, CEO of J-Data. “The mobile Internet\n\nmarket is already strong in Japan and poised to grow with new users and\n\napplications beyond the most popular one, which is messaging.”\n\nAs part of the agreement, J-Data will immediately begin selling the full range of\n\nWebNum services to Japanese content providers. These services and features\n\ninclude: Local Logo Numbers (LLNs), which are numeric names or vanity numbers\n\nthat act as localized domain names by resolving to Internet sites in Japan; Global\n\nLogo Numbers (GLNs), which can connect mobile users to any Web site globally;\n\nand Every Telephone Numbers (ETNs), which match individual phone numbers to\n\nthe e-mail or Web address of the owner s choice to leverage present investments\n\nusers have made in publicizing their telephone numbers to customers.\n\nMore than 60 percent of Japan s population is currently subscribing to mobile\n\nphone service, and our goal is to improve the mobile Internet experience for these\n\nusers,” said Tim Griswold, managing director-WebNum Services, VeriSign.\n\n“Japan is a prime focus for our WebNum services, and we are pleased to offer\n\nin-country sales and support through our agreement with J-Data.”\n\nAccording to Forrester Research, more than half of all consumers in Japan use\n\nmobile phones. The research firm asserts that in Japan messaging is the top data\n\napplication, ring tones and picture downloads come next, followed by news,\n\nweather, and sports information. Accessing specialty content and mobile\n\ncommerce services is currently more difficult. VeriSign is aiming to resolve this\n\nwith its WebNum service. If consumers can type in a short numeric code to reach\n\ntheir favorite news source or delivery service, they ll likely do so, which in turn\n\nmeans increased user airtime and revenue for carriers.\n\nWebNum Services combine VeriSign s digital trust services and Internet identity\n\nexpertise, offering conveniences for Internet users and branding opportunities for\n\nenterprises. WebNum services also provide revenue opportunities for\n\ntelecommunications carriers and do not require any changes to existing\n\ntelecommunications infrastructures. As the demand for WebNum services grows,\n\ncarriers can increase their Average Revenue Per User, realize the potential for\n\nincreased up-take and usage of mobile data devices and decrease churn rates.\n\nInterested content providers may visit www.webnum.com to check the availability\n\nof potential WebNum Logo NumberTM shortcuts. To inquire about registering a\n\n“shortcut” in Japan, companies should contact Atsushi Ito, mobile solution\n\nmanager of J-Data, at ito@j-data.co.jp, (Tel. +81-75-325-3343)\n\nAbout J-Data\n\nJ-Data, founded in 1996, offers Internet navigation solutions to the Japanese\n\nmarket. J-Data published the “Home Page Guide,” a comprehensive directory of\n\nJapanese language Web sites beginning in 1996. These sites were accessible\n\nthrough short numeric codes entered on J-Data’s Web site or through bar code\n\nentry into Set Top Boxes provided by J-Data.
