        "text": "SSL Certificates are a hot topic right now. With more people than ever choosing to secure their websites, you don’t want to be left behind. Today, getting an SSL Certificate is easy, but finding the best SSL Certificate providers may be trickier than expected.\n\nWith so many Certificate Authorities on the market offering different types of certificates, it’s easy to get overwhelmed by the huge choice. That’s why we’ve compiled a list of the top SSL certificate providers you can fully trust when it comes to data encryption.\n\nBest SSL Certificate Providers in 2024\n\nTop certificate authorities offer advanced encryption algorithms, reliable certificate issuance processes, and robust technical support. Additionally, they have a trusted reputation and provide competitive pricing options. Let’s take a closer look at the most popular SSL certificate providers:\n\n1. Sectigo\n\nSectigo (formerly Comodo) tops our list of SSL certification companies, but also the market share of commercial certificate authorities. The reason why so many users consider Sectigo the best SSL provider is their unbeatable prices and wide range of products.\n\nMost web owners search for affordable SSL bargains or specific certificates to satisfy a more complex need. The latter usually don’t fall into the cheap category, but with Sectigo, price is never an issue. Their exclusive Positive SSL line of certs caters to the tightest budgets while offering premium and top-of-the-line solutions like Extended Validation and Multi-Domain Wildcard certificates.\n\nFor over 15 years, Sectigo has been actively issuing SSL certificates to companies and individuals, making the web safer.

Sectigo’s product versatility and price flexibility are the reasons it leads our certificate providers’ rankings.\n\n2. DigiCert\n\nDigiCert is synonymous with high-assurance certificates, reliability, scalability, and streamlined SSL management. Specializing in securing top-level websites, DigiCert provides full-fledged encryption and malware prevention solutions to businesses and enterprises.\n\nAll their certificates include multi-million dollar warranties, a dynamic site seal, and fast Business or Extended Validation. Most Fortune 100 companies and the banking sector use DigiCert certificates to secure high volumes of sensitive data.\n\nEven the cheapest DigiCert certificate costs several hundred dollars per year. But the price fully justifies the value it brings. Besides securing your website, DigiCert certificates come with daily vulnerability and malware scanning, further protecting users’ data and critical website infrastructure.\n\nBrand-wise, DigiCert is a premium CA and one of the best, if not the best, SSL providers. It comes second behind Sectigo in the commercial CA market share rankings but is the leader in the OV and EV segments. The most-trusted global provider of high-assurance TLS/SSL, PKI, IoT, and signing solutions is also the successor of legacy VeriSign and Symantec certificates after Symantec’s PKI business acquisition in 2017.\n\nIf you’re a large enterprise dealing in finance, e-commerce, healthcare, or any other critical industry sector, DigiCert will take care of all your encryption and data protection needs.\n\n3. Thawte\n\nComing third in our rankings is Thawte, an international SSL provider and the first Certificate Authority to issue SSL certificates to companies with domain names registered outside the United States.

Check our SSL brands or use our helping tools to find the perfect SSL certificate for your website.\n\nThings to Consider When Choosing the Best SSL Provider\n\nChoosing the best SSL certificate provider is crucial for ensuring the security and trustworthiness of your online presence. With numerous options available, it’s essential to consider several key factors before making your decision. Below, we outline ten critical elements to help you choose the best SSL provider that aligns with your specific requirements.\n\nEncryption Strength: Novice users wonder which SSL provider offers robust encryption algorithms such as 256-bit key encryption and 2048-bit certificate encryption. Strong encryption protects sensitive data transmitted between your website and users. But, since all commercial CAs follow the same cryptographic algorithms, the encryption strength should be the least of your concerns.\n\nCertificate Validation Types: Consider the validation types offered by the SSL provider. Domain Validation (DV) certificates are ideal for basic websites, while Business (BV) and Extended Validation (EV) certificates verify legal identity and offer higher customer trust, making them the perfect option for e-commerce, nonprofits, and larger enterprises.\n\nCertificate Types: Evaluate the range of SSL certificate types provided. Ensure the SSL provider offers options like Wildcard SSL for securing multiple subdomains, Multi-Domain SSL for protecting several domains under one certificate, and Unified Communications Certificates (UCC) for securing Microsoft Exchange and Office Communications servers.\n\nBrowser and Device Compatibility: Verify that the SSL provider’s certificates are compatible with most web browsers and devices. It is crucial to ensure seamless functionality across major browsers, including both desktop and mobile platforms, to provide a consistent and secure user experience.\n\nWarranty and Insurance: Consider the SSL provider’s warranty and insurance offerings. A reliable CA will include warranties that protect you and your customers against potential financial losses resulting from a certificate breach or security failure.\n\nCustomer Support: Consider the level of customer support. Look for providers that offer responsive and knowledgeable support channels, including live chat, email, or phone support, to assist you promptly in case of any issues or queries.\n\nValidation Speed: Consider the SSL provider’s validation policies. A streamlined and efficient validation process ensures the quick issuance of certificates, allowing you to secure your website promptly. Look for providers that offer automated validation procedures to expedite the process.\n\nReputation and Trustworthiness: Research the SSL provider’s reputation and trustworthiness in the industry. Read customer reviews, check their track record, and consider their partnerships or accreditations. A reputable SSL provider with a strong industry presence adds credibility to your website.\n\nPricing and Value: Compare the pricing structures of different SSL brands and evaluate the value they offer. Look for providers that offer competitive pricing while ensuring reliable security features and additional perks like site seals or vulnerability assessments.\n\nRenewal and Certificate Management: Research the SSL provider’s renewal and certificate management processes. Simplified SSL renewal procedures and user-friendly certificate management tools will save you time and effort, allowing for smooth and hassle-free management of your SSL certificates.\n\nConclusion\n\nNow that you know the Top 5 Certificate Authorities, picking the best SSL certificate for your website should be straightforward. Remember, your website and niche determine the SSL type you need. Add to this your budget, and you can easily choose a suitable cert from our list of top SSL certificate providers. To recap:\n\nSectigo stands out for its unbeatable prices and wide range of products, catering to various budgets and needs.\n\nDigiCert, a leader in high-assurance certificates, provides robust encryption, malware prevention, and daily vulnerability scanning, making it ideal for large enterprises.\n\nThawte, part of the DigiCert Group, offers premium security at a more affordable price – a cost-efficient alternative for businesses that can’t afford the higher-priced certificates.\n\nGeoTrust, also owned by DigiCert, covers the entire range of SSL certificates and is trusted by major browsers and server platforms.\n\nGoGetSSL, a relatively new player, offers affordable options with diverse security requirements and excellent SSL warranties.\n\nRegardless of what provider you choose, the best Certificate Authority is, first and foremost, the brand that suits your website specifications and budget.
