        "text": "The Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC) is a feature of the Domain Name System (DNS) that authenticates responses to domain name lookups. It does not provide privacy protections for those lookups, but prevents attackers from manipulating or poisoning the responses to DNS requests.\n\nTo protect domains from spoofing and poisoning attacks, enable and configure DNSSEC in the following places:\n\nThe DNS zone. If you enable DNSSEC for a zone, Cloud DNS automatically manages the creation and rotation of DNSSEC keys (DNSKEY records) and the signing of zone data with resource record digital signature (RRSIG) records.\n\nThe top-level domain (TLD) registry (for example.com, this would be .com). In your TLD registry, you must have a DS record that authenticates a DNSKEY record in your zone. Do this by activating DNSSEC at your domain registrar.\n\nThe DNS resolver. For full DNSSEC protection, you must use a DNS resolver that validates signatures for DNSSEC-signed domains. You can enable validation for individual systems or your local caching resolvers if you administer your network's DNS services.\n\nFor more information about DNSSEC validation, see the following resources:\n\nDo you have DNSSEC validation enabled?\n\nDeploying DNSSEC with BIND and Ubuntu Server (Part 1)\n\nDNSSEC Guide: Chapter 3. Validation\n\nDNSSEC\n\nYou can also configure systems to use public resolvers that validate DNSSEC, notably Google Public DNS and Verisign Public DNS.\n\nThe second point limits the domain names where DNSSEC can work. Both the registrar and registry must support DNSSEC for the TLD that you are using. If you cannot add a DS record through your domain registrar to activate DNSSEC, enabling DNSSEC in Cloud DNS has no effect.\n\nBefore enabling DNSSEC, check the following resources:\n\nThe DNSSEC documentation for both your domain registrar and TLD registry\n\nThe Google Cloud community tutorial's domain registrar-specific instructions\n\nThe ICANN list of domain registrar DNSSEC support to confirm DNSSEC support for your domain.\n\nIf the TLD registry supports DNSSEC, but your registrar does not (or does not support it for that TLD), you might be able to transfer your domains to a different registrar that does. After you have completed that process, you can activate DNSSEC for the domain.\n\nManagement operations\n\nFor step-by-step instructions for managing DNSSEC, see the following resources:\n\nTo change the DNSSEC state of the zone from Transfer to On, see Leaving DNSSEC transfer state.\n\nTo enable DNSSEC for delegated subdomains, see Delegating DNSSEC-signed subdomains.\n\nRecord set types enhanced by DNSSEC\n\nFor more information about record set types and other record types, see the following resources:\n\nTo control which public certificate authorities (CAs) can generate TLS or other certificates for your domain, see CAA records.\n\nTo enable opportunistic encryption through IPsec tunnels, see IPSECKEY records.\n\nDNS record types with DNSSEC-secured zones\n\nFor more information about DNS record types and other record types, see the following resource:\n\nTo enable SSH client applications to validate SSH servers, see SSHFP records.\n\nMigration or transfer of DNSSEC-enabled zones\n\nCloud DNS supports migrating DNSSEC-enabled zones where DNSSEC has been activated at the domain registry without breaking the chain of trust. You can migrate zones to or from other DNS operators that also support migration.\n\nTo migrate a DNSSEC-signed zone to Cloud DNS, see Migrate DNSSEC-signed zones to Cloud DNS.\n\nTo migrate a DNSSEC-signed zone to another DNS operator, see Migrate DNSSEC-signed zones from Cloud DNS.\n\nIf your existing domain is hosted by your registrar, we recommend migrating the name servers to Cloud DNS before transferring to another registrar.\n\nWhat's next"
