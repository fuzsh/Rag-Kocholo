        "text": "The authenticode digital certificate I bought back in 2019 expired recently, so I had to get a new certificate (you can’t renew a certificate, as such, you just need to buy a new one). A few months before the expiry I emailed KSoftware.net, who I had bought previous digital certificates from and with whom I had always had a good experience in the past. No reply. I tried a couple more times, including the personal email of Mitchell, the founder. Nothing. Someone else told me they had had similar experiences. Their recent trustpilot ratings are a horror show. And the copyright date on their website is ‘2003 – 2021’. But they were still advertising on Google Adwords. I have no idea what is happening here. If you are reading this Mitchell, I hope you are ok.\n\nWith KSoftware out of the picture I looked elsewhere. Eventually I ended up buying a new Sectigo certificate from signmycode.com. I partly chose them because they offered a 5 year certficate and the less often I have to go through the ball ache of a getting a new certificate, the better. The experience was decidely mixed.\n\nThe good:\n\nThe prices seem reasonable, compared to other options.\n\nSupport was responsive. English didn’t appear to be their first language, but it was good enough.\n\nI got my new certificate within a few days and have had no issues with it so far. The change in certificate seems to be set off a few customer’s anti-virus software, but that was to be expected.\n\nThe mediocre:\n\nThe online guidance and documentation on the process was mediocre, at best.\n\nI was a bit confused about whether I had to click ‘Buy now’ or ‘Renew now’. It seems this is more marketing/SEO purposes and it doesn’t matter which you click.\n\nI had to send them a photo of me holding a government ID. This felt pretty uncomfortable, but might be something mandated by the certificate companies.\n\nThe bad:\n\nAfter I got my certificate I checked the expiry date and it was only 3 years. When I queried this I was rold that the ‘5 year certificate’ I thought I had bought is not a 5 year certificate. It is a 3 year certificate, then I have to apply for a new pre-paid 2 year certificate in 3 years time.\n\nThis is what you see when you click on ‘Buy now’:\n\nWhen you see this, wouldn’t you expect to get a single 5 year certificate? If there was anything explaining that this was 2 separate certificates, I didn’t notice it. It certainly didn’t mention it on their home page. This feels deceptive to me.\n\nWho knows if this company will still be there in 3 years time? I emailed them and told them I wanted to keep the new 3 year certificate and for them to refund the 2 year certificate. They said they would only refund the entire order and then I would have to start the whole process all over again. They also claimed:\n\n“renewal validation is much more easy then buying a new certificate as most of the validation part is getting carry forward.”\n\nWe’ll see. Buyer beware.\n\nSee also: The great digital certificate ripoff?\n\n** Update 08-Mar-2023 **\n\nMichell of KSoftware has contact me to say that he is alive and kicking. Read the comments below for more details.\n\nTL;DR : If you digitally sign your software you need to make sure you have an SHA2 certificate and use it to dual sign your software with both SHA1 and SHA2 digests.\n\nDigital certificates are used to prove who authored a piece of software and that it hasn’t subsequently been tampered with. Starting with Windows XP SP2 you get a warning message if you download software that that isn’t signed with an appropriate digital certificate. So most commercial software vendors digitally sign their software. We grumble about price gouging by the certificate vendors and the hoops we have to jump through to get a certificate. But, apart from that, the system seems to work tolerably well. However Microsoft have thrown a spanner into the works by deprecating digital certificates using the SHA1 algorithm. I only found out about this a few weeks ago from a fellow vendor’s blog. Thanks for nothing Microsoft. If you are using a digital certificate you purchased more than a year ago, it is probably SHA1. This post explains what this means for software vendors, based on my research so far. I am not an expert on this topic and things seem to be changing fast, so please let me know if there are any mistakes or omissions.\n\nI don’t digitally sign Windows software, does this affect me?\n\nNo. But perhaps treat Windows unsigned software warning with some skepticism until Windows software vendors sort this mess out. If you only develop for Mac OS X you can feel a bit smug (at least until the next time Apple nukes your development ecosystem from orbit).\n\nWhat is SHA1?\n\nSHA1 (Secure Hash Algorithm 1) is a cryptographic hash function that was used in digital certificates issued until recently. SHA1 was known to have weaknesses as far back as 2005. Microsoft (and Google) have finally decided that SHA1 is too vulnerable and SHA2 digital certificates should be used instead.\n\nWhat happens if my certificate is SHA1?\n\nIf you signed your software with a timestamp before 01-Jan-2016:\n\nIt will be treated by Windows XP SP2/XP SP3/Vista as signed.\n\nIt will be treated by Windows 7/8/10 as signed only until 01-Jan-2017.\n\nIf you signed your software with a timestamp on or after 01-Jan-2016:\n\nIt will be treated by Windows XP SP2/XP SP3/Vista as signed.\n\nOn Windows 7/8/10 and you will get an ugly “The signature of <file> is corrupt or invalid” or “The signature of this program is corrupt or invalid” error when downloading. If you don’t see this, it might be because you haven’t done a Windows Update recently (shame on you).\n\nWindows seems to treat software that has been downloaded from the web (with ‘mark of the web’) differently. So make sure you test a version of your software you have downloaded from the web. I carried out some tests on 01-Mar-2016 using an SHA1 certificate to sign an executable and then dowload it. It worked ok when downloaded using Firefox or Chrome, but was shown as corrupt when downloaded using IE.\n\nHow do I know if my current certificate is SHA1?\n\nRight click on your most recently signed installer and select Properties.\n\nClick on the Digital Signatures tab.\n\nSelect the signature and click on the Details button.\n\nClick the View Certificate button.\n\nClick the Details tab.\n\nLook at the Signature hash algorithm.\n\nWhat should I do if my certificate is SHA1?\n\nIf you certificate hasn’t expired you should ask the company you purchased it from to issue you a new SHA2 certificate. They should do this free of charge. In the process they will revoke your SHA1 certificate, so you can no longer use it for signing. You should then use your new SHA2 certificate to double sign new releases (see below).\n\nI have an SHA2 certificate, now what?\n\nIf you want a new release to be treated as signed on both Windows XP SP3/Vista and Windows 7/8/10 then you need to double sign the file for SHA1 and SHA2:\n\nsigntool.exe sign /f <pfx file> /p <pfx password> /t <sha1 timestamp server> /v <installer>\n\nsigntool.exe sign /f <pfx file> /p <pfx password> /tr <sha2 timestamp server> /fd sha256 /td sha256 /as /v <installer>\n\nNote the the order of the above is important (SHA1 first).\n\nThe Comodo SHA1 and SHA2 timestamp server is:\n\nhttp://timestamp.comodoca.com\n\nYou can add a /debug flag for verbose output.\n\nIf you only want to support Windows 7/8/10, then you can omit the first line (but why would you?).\n\nYou can use chktrust.exe to check the signature:\n\nchktrust.exe <installer>\n\nNote that only version 6.3 and later of signtool.exe (which comes with Windows 8.1 SDK and is also available here) supports the /as flag.\n\nI always sign the program, as well as the installer.\n\nCan I double sign .msi files?\n\nI have seen reports that .msi installers don’t support double signing. But I don’t use .msi installers, so I haven’t investigated further.\n\nWhat happens to software I signed with my SHA1 certificate after the certificate is revoked?\n\nSoftware you signed previously will not be affected, e.g. it will be treated as signed by Windows 7/8/10 until 01-Jan-2017\n\nHow do I sign Windows XP SP1/XP SP2 software?\n\nWindows XP SP1 doesn’t warn you if there is no signature, so you can ignore XP SP1. SHA2 signatures are not supported in Windows XP SP2. So you will need to have both valid SHA1 and SHA2 certificates to support XP SP2 and all the later versions of Windows. Its not clear that certificate vendors will allow this. Also, how many people with Windows XP SP2 (an unsupported OS) are out there buying software? I won’t be bothering to support signing for XP SP2.\n\nDoes this affect SSL certificates as well as code signing (Authenticode) certificates?\n\nI believe so. But I don’t have any SSL certificates, so I haven’t investigated further.\n\nHow does this affect signing of device drivers?\n\nI understand there are some differences for device drivers. But I don’t create device drivers, so I haven’t investigated further.\n\nWhat is the difference between SHA2 and SHA256?\n\nSHA2 is a family of two similar hash functions known as SHA256 and SHA512. SHA256 uses 32-bit words where SHA512 uses 64-bit words.\n\nHow secure is SHA2?\n\nEr, it was designed by the NSA. Supply your own joke.\n\nI don’t have a digital certificate, where can I get one?\n\nI got my Comodo code signing certificate from reseller ksoftware.net. They have a good reputation, and are significantly cheaper than Comodo. I don’t have any business relationship with them beyond being a happy customer.\n\nUpdate: See renewing my authenticode digital certificate .\n\nAnything else I should know?\n\nMicrosoft has reserved the right to move the SHA1 deprecation date forward from 01-Jan-2017.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nThanks to Nikos Bozinis for first alerting me to this issue and to Mitchell Vincent of ksoftware.net for fact checking this article.\n\nFurther reading\n\nhttp://zabkat.com/blog/code-signing-sha1-armageddon.htm\n\nhttp://support.ksoftware.net/support/solutions/articles/215805-the-truth-about-sha1-sha256-and-code-signing-certificates-\n\nhttp://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/32288.windows-enforcement-of-authenticode-code-signing-and-timestamping.aspx\n\nUpdates\n\n02-Mar-2016: Added missing link and minor update.\n\n03-Mar-2016: Minor update.\n\n25-Feb-2023: Added link to https://successfulsoftware.net/2023/02/25/renewing-my-authenticode-digital-certificate/.\n\nRipoff: A ripoff (or rip-off) is a bad deal. Usually it refers to an incident in which a person pays too much for something. A ripoff is distinguished from a scam in that a scam involves wrongdoing such as fraud. From Wikipedia.\n\nDigitally signing your software allows you to show that you are the author of the software and that the application hasn’t been tampered with. If your software isn’t signed, Windows displays scary looking warnings when customers download it. So it makes a lot of sense to digitally sign your software if you are distributing it on Windows. So far so good.\n\nAnyone can create their own digital signature, but Windows only ‘trusts’ signatures that have been created by certain third parties. While there are quite a few Microsoft root certificate program members, I am only aware of 3 that sell code signing (‘authenticode’) certificates. This is where it starts to get ugly. Here are their published prices per year:\n\nVerisign: $499.00\n\nThawte: $299.00\n\nComodo: $119.95\n\nThat seems an awful lot considering that all they appear to do is check a document (e.g. a scan of your certificate of incorporation), check your whois record, multiply a couple of large prime numbers and then send you a certificate file. Much of this process is (or should be) automated. No wonder the founder of Thawte could afford to be one of the first space tourists.\n\nGiven that authenticode certificates from these three companies are functionally identical[1], as far as I can tell, why the price difference? It seems even more bizarre when you consider that Verisign now own Thawte. If you had the misfortune to sign up for the Microsoft ‘works with Vista’ program you could get a 1-year Verisign code signing certificate for $99. I doubt they were doing this at a loss, so how can they justify selling the exact same certificate for $499? I would guess that at least 99% of customers will never check who issued a certificate, so it can hardly be due to the power of the brand.\n\nSo why doesn’t someone just set up their own certificating authority, get approved by Microsoft, and undercut these 3 companies? Because their root certificate wouldn’t be installed on all the millions of PCs currently out there. It would be worthless until the vast majority of PCs had the new root certificate. What a fantastic lock-in!\n\nThe good news is that you can buy Comodo certificates for much more reasonable prices from these resellers:\n\nTucows: $75 [2]\n\nKSoftware: $85 ($75 for ASP members)\n\nWhich rather begs the question – if resellers can make a profit at $75, why are Comodo charging $119? Because they can, I suppose. I emailed Verisign, Thawte and Comodo to ask about the disparities in price. I only received a reply from Comodo:\n\nThis [difference between their price and the reseller price] is simply due to Retail Vs Wholesale solutions we offer. Our Resellers commit to a specific program which enables discounted prices allowing them to make margins on the product as they see fit. Whether that be reduced prices, or make a cash profit from the sale.\n\nAll 3 companies have had major price hikes in the last few years. With so little competition, why wouldn’t they? So what is Microsoft’s role is in all of this? One would have thought that they would want to keep certificate prices low to encourage their wider adoption. I emailed Microsoft’s PR people to ask about pricing and whether they had any financial interest in Verisign. Here is the response:\n\n1) Why does Microsoft “insist” on VeriSign certificates?\n\nMicrosoft Windows Quality Labs only recognizes files that are signed with a Verisign Class 3 Certificate of Authority (COA). Windows Quality Labs is evaluating recognizing other COA’s. There is a USD $399 offer for Class 3 COAs for those partners (IHVs, OEMS, ISVs) – who plan to submit solutions for Microsoft certification. More details are available at http://www.verisign.com/code-signing/msft-organizational-certificates/.\n\n2) Does Microsoft have any comment to make on the disparity in price?\n\nVeriSign also offers a USD $99 Organizational ID certificate. This provides authentication for organizations to Microsoft Windows Quality Labs, providing access to various services, such as creating submission IDs for products to undergo Microsoft testing. This certificate is not valid for signing drivers or executable files.\n\nInformation pertaining to Microsoft Investments can be located at the MSFT Investor Relations site, under Investments/Acquisitions: http://www.microsoft.com/msft/default.mspx.\n\nSteve Bell, Senior Product Manager – Server Certification Programs, Windows Server\n\nAfter a bit of surfing I found this page which says that Microsoft invested in Verisign in 1996. I don’t know how much they invested, but it certainly puts things in a rather different light. So Windows authenticode certificates are effectively controlled by just 2 companies, at least one of whom is part-owned by Microsoft[3]. Companies are in business to make profits, but it seems to me that these companies are using their effective monopoly to take advantage of the situation. I only see the situation getting worse as Windows displays ever more scary warnings for unsigned software. Perhaps this is something government regulators should be investigating. Let’s hope that Verisign don’t buy Comodo as well.\n\n[1] Only Verisign certificates are recognised for some of the Microsoft certification programs, for example x64 Vista driver signing.\n\n[2] You need to register with Tucows to login.\n\n[3] Assuming they haven’t sold their Verisign stock. I am not aware that Microsoft owns any Comodo stock. I haven’t been able to find any further details by Googling."
