        "text": "According to GlobalData’s company profile on VeriSign, EMV tokenization was a key innovation area identified from patents. VeriSign's grant share as of September 2023 was 53%. Grant share is based on the ratio of number of grants to total number of patents.\n\nAssociating top level domain names with blockchain addresses\n\nA recently granted patent (Publication Number: US11750401B2) describes a method and system for associating a top-level domain name or network identifier with a blockchain address on a blockchain. The method involves obtaining information from a Domain Name System (DNS) root zone file or a root network segment file, including an identification of the domain name or network identifier and a signature on the identification. Based on this information, an association between the domain name or network identifier and the blockchain address is obtained.\n\nTo validate the trust chain, information is obtained that extends from a trusted authority to the association. This information includes signatures for the association. The association and the information necessary to validate the trust chain are then sent to an executable program on the blockchain. The trust chain can be validated by the executable program, and the association can be stored on the blockchain.\n\nThe patent also describes resolving conflicts between different blockchain addresses associated with the same top-level network identifier. This is achieved by obtaining information from a second server that stores network infrastructure records and obtaining a second association of the top-level network identifier with a second blockchain address. The conflict between the addresses is then resolved.\n\nThe system for associating a top-level domain name or network identifier with a blockchain address includes a memory containing instructions and a processor that executes these instructions. The system performs operations such as obtaining information from a DNS root zone file or a root network segment file, obtaining the association between the domain name or network identifier and the blockchain address, obtaining information to validate the trust chain, and sending the association and trust chain information to an executable program on the blockchain.\n\nOverall, this patent presents a method and system for securely associating top-level domain names or network identifiers with blockchain addresses. By leveraging DNS and network infrastructure records, the trust chain can be validated, and the association can be stored on the blockchain. This technology has the potential to enhance the security and integrity of blockchain-based systems and applications.\n\nTo know more about GlobalData’s detailed insights on VeriSign, buy the report here."
