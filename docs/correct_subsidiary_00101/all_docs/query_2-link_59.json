        "text": "General FAQs\n\nWhat is the .edu domain?\n\nThe .edu domain is one of the seven original top-level subdivisions of the Internet Domain Name System (DNS). The .edu domain is intended for accredited U.S. postsecondary institutions. It is managed under the authority of the United States Department of Commerce.\n\nHow does an institution apply for a name in the .edu domain?\n\nEligible institutions may apply for a name in the .edu domain by follow the procedures on the Request a New Domain page. Eligibility criteria are available on the eligibility page.\n\nNOTE: If you already have a .edu domain name and wish to apply for a second one, please log into your registrant account and submit an application using the menu option for second domain name registration. DO NOT submit an application via the \"Request a New Domain\" page - since you already have a registrant account, the second domain name you register must be associated with that account.\n\nWhat is the role of the U.S. Department of Commerce and iCANN have in the management of the .edu domain?\n\nThe Department of Commerce retains final authority over the membership and operations of the .edu domain. EDUCAUSE administers the .edu domain under a cooperative agreement with Commerce that requires the approval of both parties in order for substantive changes in domain policies and procedures to take effect. Please see the .edu policy page for more information.\n\nAs specified in the .edu Cooperative Agreement, the .edu Policy Board reviews domain policies and recommends changes as needed to Commerce for approval. Please contact EDUCAUSE ([email protected]) if you have suggestions.\n\nUnlike top-level domains that are subject to ICANN governance, administration of the .edu domain falls solely under the oversight of the U.S. Department of Commerce. The domain's policies derive from the .edu Cooperative Agreement between Commerce and EDUCAUSE, as amended.\n\nI understand that some ICANN rules may make it easier for someone to \"hijack\" my .edu domain name. Is this true?\n\nNo. The ICANN transfer policy does not affect the .edu domain. The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) implemented its transfer policy to make it easier for a domain name holder to transfer its domain name from one internet registrar to another. In the case of .edu names, though, there is only one registrar, EDUCAUSE, and the .edu domain is not subject to ICANN regulations.\n\nThe policies and procedures of the .edu domain prevent unauthorized updates to .edu registrations.\n\n.edu Billing FAQs\n\nIs there a cost to have a name in the .edu domain?\n\nUnder the terms of Amendment 11 of the .edu Cooperative Agreement with the U.S. Department of Commerce, EDUCAUSE is authorized to assess a $77.00 per year registration fee to recoup the expenses of managing the domain. Please note that paying the registration fee is just one step of a two-step process. All registrants are also required to accept the EDUCAUSE Customer Service Agreement when they register or renew the registration of a .edu domain name. Registrants can register or renew their registrations for a one-year or three-year term at their discretion.\n\nDo I have to sign an agreement?\n\nYes, along with payment for your domain, you will be required to agree to and sign the EDUCAUSE Customer Service Agreement.\n\nHow and when do I renew my domain?\n\nThe billing contact will receive an initial invoice and renewal instructions via email 60 days before the domain expires. Please make sure the contact information is up to date by having the administrative or technical contact log in and update the Whois contact information.\n\nWhich credit cards can I use to pay the registration fee for a .edu domain name?\n\nEDUCAUSE accepts the following credit cards for payment of .edu domain name registration fees: Visa, MasterCard, American Express, and Discover Card.\n\nCan we prepay for several years?\n\nEDUCAUSE's agreement with the Department of Commerce allows us to collect payment for either a one-year or three-year term. You can make this selection when you register or renew the registration of your domain name, which includes making the appropriate payment online via a credit card.\n\nCan I change the billing and renewal dates?\n\nEDUCAUSE's agreement with the Department of Commerce does not allow for any change in the initial billing date. Renewal dates are based on the initial domain registration date.\n\nWho is the billing contact?\n\nThe billing contact is the individual at your institution who should receive the .edu domain name invoice. You will be asked to name a billing contact when you register your domain name, but you may access your registrant account later to provide one as necessary. The billing contact will not appear in the public Whois information for your .edu domain. To view your billing contact, log in to your account.\n\nHow do I change the billing contact?\n\nThe administrative or technical contact must log in to the registrant account and update the billing contact information.\n\nCan I purchase additional .edu domains?\n\nEDUCAUSE's agreement with the Department of Commerce allows institutions or organizations that meet the eligibility requirements to register as many as two (2) .edu domain names. The same registration process and requirements apply.\n\nWhat is the CVV2 number?\n\nFor Visa, Mastercard, and Discover Card Holders:\n\nIn the signature field on the back of your credit card, there is a three-digit number following some of the digits from your actual credit card number. The CVV2 value is the three-digit number at the end.\n\nFor American Express Card Holders:\n\nThere is a four-digit number located on the front of your credit card to the right side and above the actual card number. The CVV2 value is that four-digit number.\n\nIf I release my domain before it expires, will I receive a refund?\n\nNo, EDUCAUSE does not issue refunds or credits for names deleted prior to the end of a paid registration/renewal period. Registrants may change a domain name during a registration/renewal period, however, and the registration fee for the prior name will be applied to cover the new name for the period in question.\n\nI neglected to pay my registration fee on time and my domain name was deleted. Can I get it back?\n\nPer U.S. Department of Commerce guidance, once a registrant loses its .edu domain name consistent with domain policies and procedures, the registrant may reapply for that or any other .EDU name, but only as a new applicant under the current eligibility requirements. If it does not meet the current eligibility requirements, its registration application will be declined. In particular, a previously \"grandfathered\" registrant that lost its .edu domain name would no longer be grandfathered; it would therefore need to meet the current .edu eligibility requirements to secure a new registration.\n\nHow can I view the invoice for my domain name?\n\nYou can view your invoices with the billing section of your account.\n\nLog in to your account\n\nGo to the \"My Account\" area [located in the \"Welcome\" drop down menu].\n\nIn the \"Billing\" section, click the \"Invoice History\" link.\n\nAll of your invoices will be displayed on the screen; click on any of the invoices to view the details.\n\nNote: You can download any invoice from the invoice details screen, by clicking the download / print icon located on the top right-hand side.\n\nCurrent Holders of .edu Domain Names FAQs\n\nMy organization already holds a .edu domain name. Can I change it to something else?\n\nYes. All current holders of .edu domain names will be allowed to change their name to a different name that is available at the time of the request. Names issued must meet the conditions of Amendment 6 of the .edu Cooperative Agreement between EDUCAUSE and the Department of Commerce. In particular, they must reasonably represent the name of the registrant, may not be deployed to identify any organization other than the registrant, and may not be \"generic names.\"\n\n(Please note that, per the terms of the .edu Cooperative Agreement, holders of grandfathered domain names may renew those names regardless of the current .edu eligibility requirements. If a grandfathered domain holder wishes to change to a new name, though, the requested name will need to comply with the Amendment 6 naming requirements—the new name will need to reasonably represent the name of the registrant institution or organization; it may not be deployed for any organization other than the registrant; and it may not be generic.)\n\nIf you are changing the domain name due to a change in the registrant (organization) name, the EDUCAUSE Whois Lookup database must first be updated to reflect the new organization name. Log in to your domain and submit a support ticket to request this change.\n\nEDUCAUSE must approve this type of request and might ask for documentation showing that the organization has changed or will change its name officially. Please check the EDUCAUSE Whois Lookup database regularly to verify that this change has been processed. Once the Whois Lookup database has been updated, you may submit a domain name change request.\n\nTo submit a domain name change request, log in to your account and click on \"Domain Names\" in the upper navigation. Click on the \"Actions\" arrow, select \"change domain name\", and follow the prompts. This domain request must be approved before it becomes active and ready for use. Your old domain name can remain active for up to six months to assist in the transition to your new domain name. If you find you need more time, EDUCAUSE will automatically grant an additional six-month extension on request. Should you become concerned about your institution or organization’s capacity to complete your domain name transition within this timeframe, please contact EDUCAUSE at [email protected]. EDUCAUSE works with registrants on a case-by-case basis to manage transition process timeframes as necessary to facilitate completion with a minimum of disruption.\n\nEDUCAUSE also asks registrants to use [email protected] to keep the association informed as they near completion of their domain name change so that EDUCAUSE can coordinate with them on the release of their previous domain name. Once the old domain is released and after the redemption period, it will become available for selection on a first-come, first-served basis by an eligible institution.\n\nWhen I change or release a name, can I transfer the old name to another institution?\n\nNo. You do not own the name and therefore may not give, sell, or in any other way transfer it to another institution or organization. When you release a name, it becomes available for any eligible registrant to select on a first-come, first-served basis.\n\nIs there a cost to have a name in the .edu domain?\n\nUnder the terms of Amendment 11 of the Cooperative Agreement with the Department of Commerce, EDUCAUSE is authorized to assess an annual $77.00 administration fee to recoup the expenses of managing the domain.\n\nMy institution already has a name in the .us domain. Can we still request and use a name in the .edu domain? Do we have to give up our existing name?\n\nYour eligibility for a name in the .edu domain is completely unrelated to any name(s) you might have or acquire in any other top-level domain(s), such as .us, .com, or .org. You are limited to two names in the .edu domain, but you may hold names in other domains without affecting your eligibility for .edu registration.\n\nMay I request more than one .edu domain name?\n\nYes, institutions or organizations eligible to register a .edu domain name may register as many as two (2) .edu domain names. (Please note that the terms of the .edu Cooperative Agreement allow grandfathered registrants to renew the grandfathered domain names they had registered prior to the current eligibility requirements, regardless of number. As a result, a grandfathered registrant may hold more than two .edu domain names.)\n\nDo I have to change the registered host names in my old domain?\n\nYes. If there are registered host names in your old domain, they must be changed or deleted before you can release your old domain.\n\nWhat if the information in the Whois Lookup database is wrong?\n\nEDUCAUSE manages the .edu domain under the authority of the U.S. Department of Commerce. Both EDUCAUSE and the Department of Commerce are committed to maintaining the accuracy of the Whois Lookup database, which records the administrative details of each .edu name. We therefore ask all registrants of .edu names to login to their domain account, review their entries, and correct any inaccuracies. See the EDUCAUSE Customer Service Agreement for further information.\n\nHow do I update the EDUCAUSE Whois information if it is incorrect?\n\nYou will have to submit any registrant information changes, such as a change in the institution’s name, address, or contact information, via a support ticket. EDUCAUSE must review and approve changes to registrant information, and it will require appropriate documentation to support such a decision. For example, a registrant seeking to revise the institutional name in its Whois listing will have to provide documentation establishing that the institution’s name has officially changed.\n\nWhen is a deleted domain name available again?\n\nFollowing the deletion of a domain name for any reason, it remains under redemption status for 45 days. After this period, the domain is available for an eligible institution or organization to register.\n\nHow long can I retain registration of a .edu name under the \"grandfathered domain name\" provisions of the Cooperative Agreement?\n\nInstitutions and organizations with .edu domains that were registered prior to October 2001 may retain those domains so long as they renew their registrations, which they can do annually or on a multiyear basis, and maintain proper administrative control. See the EDUCAUSE Customer Service Agreement for further information.\n\nBased on Amendment 6 of the .edu Cooperative Agreement, under what circumstances might I be notified that I have violated .edu domain policy?\n\nIf you are the registrant of a .edu name and have transferred that name to any other entity, regardless of when the .edu name was assigned to you, you are in violation of domain policy. (\"Transferring\" includes selling, trading, leasing, assigning, or any other means of transferring.)\n\nPolicy requires that a .edu domain name must reasonably represent the name of the registrant, may not be deployed to identify any organization other than the registrant, and may not be a \"generic name.\" (Grandfathered domain names are not required to reasonably align with the institutional or organizational name of the registrant or to be non-generic in nature, but they may not be deployed to identify an organization other than the registrant. Holders of grandfathered domain names may seek to change their registered domain name just like any other .edu domain name holder. The new name they seek to register, however, must then comply with the conditions discussed previously—it must reasonably represent the name of the registrant institution or organization, it may not be deployed to identify any organization other than the registrant, and it may not be generic.)\n\nInstitutions that registered .edu domain names under the current, post–October 2001 eligibility requirements must also continue to meet those requirements to renew their registrations. That includes maintaining institutional accreditation from a U.S. Department of Education–recognized accreditor. If EDUCAUSE believes that a registrant institution no longer holds the accreditation necessary for .edu eligibility, EDUCAUSE will contact the registrant to determine where the institution stands in relation to reestablishing appropriate accreditation. If EDUCAUSE determines that the institution does not have the necessary accreditation and cannot or will not work toward restoring it, the association will find that the institution is in violation of domain policy and seek to enforce compliance as discussed below. EDUCAUSE will work with institutions that are no longer eligible for .edu registration to allow for an orderly transition of their web sites to a new domain name outside the .edu domain so long as an institution is working with EDUCAUSE in good faith to migrate out of the .edu top-level domain.\n\nIf I am found to be violating .edu domain policy, what will happen?\n\nUnder the terms of Amendment 6 of the .edu Cooperative Agreement, effective July 25, 2003: \"If EDUCAUSE becomes aware of a violation of these Policies, EDUCAUSE will notify the Registrant in writing and, if the violation is not corrected within 45 days, will remove the registration of the such [sic] .edu name, taking the necessary technical steps to return the name to the pool of available names as soon as practicable.\" Please see Amendment 11 for a more detailed review of the steps that EDUCAUSE will take to address a violation of .edu domain policy.\n\nNew Applicants to the .edu Domain FAQ\n\nHow does an institution apply for a name in the .edu domain?\n\nEligible institutions may apply for a name in the .edu domain by visiting the Request a New Domain section of our website. Eligibility criteria, advice for avoiding duplicate domain name requests, related policies, timelines, and other information are available on the EDUCAUSE .edu domain web site.\n\nMay I request more than one .edu domain name?\n\nYes, institutions or organizations that meet the current eligibility requirements for .edu domain name registration may apply for as many as two (2) names in the .edu domain.\n\nIs there a cost to have a name in the .edu domain?\n\nUnder the terms of Amendment 11 of the .edu Cooperative Agreement with the Department of Commerce, EDUCAUSE is authorized to assess an annual $77 registration fee per domain name to recoup the expenses of managing the domain.\n\nMust an institution join EDUCAUSE to apply for or obtain a name in the .edu domain?\n\nNo.\n\nMy institution has applied for accreditation and we have been assured it will be awarded. Can we apply for a .edu domain?\n\nYour eligibility for a name in the .edu domain will begin as soon as your accreditation is final. Current .edu policy does not recognize pre-accredited status for eligibility.\n\nMy institution already has a name in the .us domain. Can we still request and use a name in the .edu domain? Do we have to give up our existing name?\n\nYour eligibility for a name in the .edu domain is completely unrelated to any name(s) you might have or acquire in any other top-level domain(s), such as .us, .com, or .org. You are limited to two (2) names in the .edu domain, but you may hold names in other domains without affecting your eligibility for .edu registration.\n\nWhen is a deleted domain name available again?\n\nFollowing the deletion of a domain name for any reason, it remains under redemption status for 45 days. After this period, the domain is available for an eligible institution or organization to register.\n\nAre there any restrictions on what name I choose or what use I make of that name?\n\nUnder the terms of Amendment 6 of the .edu Cooperative Agreement, a .edu domain name must reasonably represent the name of the registrant, may not be deployed to identify any organization other than the registrant, and may not be a \"generic name.\" (A grandfathered name does not have to reasonably represent the name of the grandfathered registrant, and it may be generic in nature.) No .edu registrant may transfer a .edu name to any other entity for any reason. \"Transferring\" includes selling, trading, leasing, assigning, or any other means of transferring.\n\nIf I am found to be violating .edu domain policy, what will happen?\n\nUnder the terms of Amendment 6 of the .edu Cooperative Agreement, effective July 25, 2003: \"If EDUCAUSE becomes aware of a violation of these Policies, EDUCAUSE will notify the Registrant in writing and, if the violation is not corrected within 45 days, will remove the registration of the such .edu name, taking the necessary technical steps to return the name to the pool of available names as soon as practicable.\" Please see Amendment 11 of the .edu Cooperative Agreement for a more detailed explanation of the policy enforcement process.\n\nWhen might I be notified of a policy violation?\n\nUnder the terms of Amendment 6 of the .edu Cooperative Agreement, effective July 25, 2003: \"Violations will be noted and dealt with regardless of how long such violations were in place prior to notification.\"\n\nAccount FAQs\n\nHow do I log in to my account?\n\nTo log in to your account please follow these instructions:\n\nClick on the \"Login\" link located in the main site navigation.\n\nEnter your username and password.\n\nClick the login button.\n\nI cannot remember my password. How do I reset it?\n\nClick on the \"Forgot your username or password?\" link in the \"Login\" area.\n\nEnter the email address associated with your account. A reset password email will be sent to the email address(es) associated with your account, which could include the Administrative, Billing, and Technical contacts.\n\nFollow the instructions in the email to reset your password.\n\nHow do I change my password?\n\nThere are two ways to change your password:\n\nClick on the \"Forgot your username or password?\" link in the \"Login\" area.\n\nIf you are already logged in to your account, you can change your password by clicking the \"Change Password\" link in the \"MY ACCOUNT\" area of your account, which is located under the \"Welcome\" drop-down menu [located on the top right of your account].\n\nHow do I reset my password when I am unsure of the contact email(s) for my account, or the contact email(s) are no longer valid?\n\nPlease call Customer Support at 1-858-295-4628.\n\nYou will need to provide the domain name that is in your account.\n\nYou will be asked to submit the following documentation for your organization:\n\nA signed Letter of Authorization on organization letterhead that states the reason for requesting account access and provides your contact details and username for the account.\n\nA copy of your government-issued photo ID, such as your driver's license, or your passport.\n\nDocumentation showing your position within the organization, including either your business card or your work ID badge.\n\nUpon verification we will send an email with your username and a temporary password.\n\nHow do I add / change email contacts to my account?\n\nYou can add three additional email addresses to your account. To add an email address to your account information [such as your billing, administrative, and technical contact email addresses], follow the steps below:\n\nLog in to your account.\n\nGo to the \"My Account\" area [located in the \"Welcome\" drop-down menu].\n\nIn the \"Account\" section, click the \"Change Address\" link.\n\nAdd the email addresses in the \"Alternative Email 1, 2 and 3\" fields.\n\nClick the \"Okay\" button to save your changes.\n\nNote: Additional addresses will be cc'd on all emails sent to the primary email address.\n\nHow do I setup two-factor authentication for my account?\n\nYou will need a mobile device in order to setup two-factor authentication. Note: If you have multiple contacts associated with the domain, it is suggested that all users setup two-factor authentication at the same time as all contacts will be required to enter a unique code each time they want to log in to the account. Contacts who do not have it setup will be unable to log in to the account without the unique authorization code. The authentication code is a one-time use code that you must get from the authenticator app you download as part of the two-factor authentication setup.\n\nFollow these steps to setup two-factor authentication:\n\nLog in to your account.\n\nGo to the \"My Account\" area [located in the \"Welcome\" drop-down menu].\n\nIn the \"Security\" section, click the \"Two-factor Authentication\" link.\n\nFollow the detailed instructions on the screen.\n\nI do not have an authentication code and cannot log in to my account?\n\nThis means that another user on the account has setup two-factor authentication for the account. Contact the other contacts on the account and ask then for the authentication code. Perform a Whois lookup to see who the other contacts are for your domain name. Enter the authentication code with your username and password to log in to your account. Once you log in, you need to setup two-factor authentication on your own mobile device. For instructions, please view the \"How do I setup two-factor authentication for my account?\" FAQ.\n\nHow can I restrict access to my account / domain name?\n\nYou can restrict your account so it can only be accessed from IP addresses that you define. You can specify up to three (3) static IP addresses that may access your account. This works at the account level to let you determine which computers or computer networks are able to access your account.\n\nLog in to your account.\n\nGo to the \"My Account\" area [located in the \"Welcome\" drop-down menu].\n\nIn the \"Security\" section, click the \"IP Account Lock\" link.\n\nFollow the instructions displayed on the \"IP Account Lock\" screen.\n\nClick the \"Add Address\" button to save your settings.\n\nNote: To avoid locking yourself out of your account, do not use this feature if you are unsure of what you are doing!\n\nWhat is a One-Time Verification code?\n\nThe One-Time Verification code adds an extra layer of security to your EDUCAUSE account beyond just a username and password to verify your identity. You can use this code for single authentication within a short time frame.\n\nWhere is the code sent?\n\nPrimary Account Holders: The One-Time Verification code will be sent to the primary email address associated with your EDUCAUSE account.\n\nSubusers: The One-Time Verification code will be sent to the subuser email address if the account was accessed with the subuser username and password.\n\nHow long will it take for the code to arrive?\n\nThe One-Time Verification code will be sent within 1-2 minutes, usually faster after the username and password are entered.\n\nHow long is the code valid for?\n\nThe One-Time Verification code is valid for 5 minutes.\n\nCan I request another code? If so, after how long?\n\nYes, you can request another code 2 minutes after the first code. Please note that when a new code is sent, the first or prior code will no longer be valid.\n\nWhat if I do not have access to a primary email address?\n\nIf you do not have access to the primary email associated with your account, please contact our Support Team for further assistance.\n\nWill the email also be sent to alternative email addresses?\n\nNo, the One-Time Verification code only goes to the primary account email.\n\nI am a Subuser and I do not have access to my email. What should I do?\n\nYou will need to contact the primary account holder for further assistance. The primary account holder will be able to change the subuser email address by accessing EDUCAUSE account.\n\nWhat are the security questions for?\n\nSecurity questions are a way to verify your identity when accessing an account.\n\nPlease ensure the security questions and answers are entered correctly. This is extremely important as these details will be requested for various actions on your account.\n\nHow do I change my security questions and answers?\n\nYou may update your security questions and answers by following the steps below:\n\nLog in to your account\n\nGo to the \"My Account\" area [located in the \"Welcome\" drop-down menu].\n\nIn the \"Security\" section, click the \"Security Questions\" link.\n\nFollow the detailed instructions on the screen.\n\nWhere can I view my invoices?\n\nLog in to your account\n\nGo to the \"My Account\" area [located in the \"Welcome\" drop-down menu].\n\nIn the \"Billing\" section, click the \"Invoice History\" link.\n\nAll of your invoices will be displayed on the screen; click on any of the invoices to view the details.\n\nNote: You can download any invoice from the invoice details screen by clicking the download / print icon located on the top right-hand side.\n\nWhere can I view my payments?\n\nLog in to your account.\n\nGo to the \"My Account\" area [located in the \"Welcome\" drop-down menu].\n\nIn the \"Billing\" section, click the \"Payments and Refunds\" link.\n\nAll of your payments, including links to your invoices, will be displayed on the screen.\n\nTechnical FAQs\n\nWhy don't IP addresses show up in the EDUCAUSE Whois server for nameservers that don't end in .edu?\n\nIP addresses for nameservers not ending in .edu are not collected by EDUCAUSE and are therefore not displayed. To find the IP address of a nameserver that doesn't end in .edu, visit the VeriSign Whois server or the Whois server of the registrar of the nameserver.\n\nHow do I make nameserver address changes?\n\nTo makes changes to the nameservers associated with your domain name, follow these instructions:\n\nLog in to your account.\n\nClick on \"View All Domains.\"\n\nClick on the domain name you want to modify.\n\nClick on \"Edit Nameservers\" and make the necessary changes.\n\nConfirm your changes to nameserver information for your .edu domain name(s).\n\nThere may be a delay between when you submit the nameserver changes and when the registry processes these changes. Until then, the old nameservers will still be handling your domain name(s).\n\nWhen will changes to domains and hosts be made live on the Internet?\n\nOnce your domain name has been verified, it will become active in the registry and your domain will appear in the Whois. If you have requested changes to your organization name and/or registrant address, then these will be updated in the Whois once they have been verified and approved by EDUCAUSE.\n\nHow do I know if my domain and host changes have been made?\n\nThey will be reflected in the Whois.\n\nHow do I configure my DNS?\n\nWe do not host your DNS. Please contact your DNS provider (i.e., whoever provides you with your nameservers) for instructions on how to configure your DNS.\n\nWhat are autonomous system numbers?\n\nAn autonomous system number (ASN) is a unique number that is available globally to identify an autonomous system; the system’s ASN enables it to exchange exterior routing information with other neighboring autonomous systems.\n\nWhat is an IN-ADDR.ARPA domain?\n\nAcross the Internet, the in-addr.arpa (inverse address) domain is used for reverse mapping of IPv4 numbers, which allows one to determine the hostname associated with a given IP address.\n\nHow do I register an IN-ADDR.ARPA domain?\n\nYou should ask your upstream provider about registering your in-addr.arpa domain. If you are working directly with a regional registry, visit its website.\n\nHow do I get a Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) server certificate for my website?\n\nEDUCAUSE does not issue SSL certificates. You can obtain an SSL certificate through VeriSign.\n\nDNSSEC FAQs\n\nWhat is DNSSEC?\n\nDNSSEC is a technique for improving Internet security. The Domain Name System (DNS) is the part of the Internet that translates names such as \"example.edu\" into numeric addresses (for example, 198.59.61.90). All Internet applications — from electronic mail to online banking — depend on the accuracy and integrity of this translation. Over the years, Internet security experts have discovered a variety of ways that DNS translation may be compromised. The DNSSEC security system limits the problem by allowing owners of domain names to provide a digital signature that adds an extra level of authentication to the translation process.\n\nWhen will .edu be signed?\n\nOn August 2, 2010, EDUCAUSE and VeriSign announced the completion of a project to deploy DNSSEC within the .edu portion of the Internet. Institutions whose domain names end in .edu will be able to utilize digital signatures to mitigate certain DNS security vulnerabilities, such as cache poisoning and man-in-the-middle attacks. The .edu namespace is signed, and .edu domain names can also be signed at this time.\n\nHow do I implement DNSSEC for my domain?\n\nEDUCAUSE does not manage your DNS; we recommend consulting your DNS service provider for its procedures on implementing DNSSEC.\n\nOnce you have obtained your key from your DNS provider, you can sync it with the registry in the domain settings area of your account by taking the following steps:\n\nLog in to your account.\n\nClick on \"My Domains.\"\n\nClick on the domain name you want to sync.\n\nIn the \"DNSSEC\" section, click \"Configure DS Records\" link.\n\nOn the \"Configure DS Records\" screen, enter the information provided by your DNS provider and click \"Update.\"\n\nI've signed my domain - how do I know it is validating?\n\nA service run by Verisign is one of the online services that will check to ensure the registry is synced with your DNS provider. This tool is not run by EDUCAUSE, so the association cannot guarantee the accuracy of the results. Please consult your DNS provider for its recommended tool if you have concerns.\n\nOnce I sign my domain and publish my DS records with EDUCAUSE, will I be required to roll the keys annually?\n\nWhile it is considered a generally accepted best practice to roll your DNSSEC key at least annually, please consult your DNS provider for its best practices as EDUCAUSE does not manage your DNS.\n\nDo I have to implement DNSSEC for my domain?\n\nNo, you do not have to implement DNSSEC. DNSSEC addresses an identified security risk, however, and helps to prevent malicious activities like cache poisoning, pharming, and man-in-the-middle attacks. It uses a digital signature to create a chain of authority. It then uses the chain to verify that the source domain name, which the DNS resolver returns, matches the DNS record stored at the authoritative DNS. If it cannot validate the source, it discards the response.\n\nWill DNSSEC increase fees for .edu domain names?\n\nNo, DNSSEC does not add to the cost of .edu domain names."
