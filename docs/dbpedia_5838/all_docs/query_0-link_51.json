Both the total and partial cross sections are reported for the collision of C6+ ions with atomic and molecular hydrogen. A comparison with other theoretical and experimental results shows, in general good agreement except at very low energy, considered here. For H2, the one- and two-electron charge exchange cross sections are calculated and compared with other theoretical and experimental results. Small but non-negligible isotope effects are found at the lowest energy studied in the charge transfer of C6+ with H. In low energy region, it is observed that H2 has larger isotope effects than H atom due to the polarizability effect which is larger than the mass effect.\n\nCharge exchange in slow collisions of Si3+ with H\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nJoseph, D.

The charge exchange process reported here, Si^3+ + H -- Si^2+ + H^+ is an important destruction mechanism of Si^3+ in photo-ionized gas. The soft X-ray emission from comets has been explained by charge transfer of solar wind ions, among them Si^3+, with neutrals in the cometary gas vapor. The state selective cross sections are evaluated using the semi-classical molecular orbital close coupling (MOCC) [1] methods. Adiabatic potentials and wave functions for a number of low-lying singlet and triplet states are calculated using the MRD-CI package [2]. Details will be presented at the conference. [1] M.

S.; Mullen, P. D.; Lyons, D.; Shelton, R. L.; Fogle, M.; Schultz, D. R.; Stancil, P. C.\n\n2018-01-01\n\nThe fundamental collisional process of charge exchange (CX) has been established as a primary source of X-ray emission from the heliosphere, planetary exospheres, and supernova remnants. In this process, X-ray emission results from the capture of an electron by a highly charged ion from a neutral atom or molecule, to form a highly excited, high-charge state ion. As the captured electron cascades down to the lowest energy level, photons are emitted, including X-rays. To provide reliable CX-induced X-ray spectral models to realistically simulate these environments, line ratios and spectra are computed using theoretical CX cross sections obtained with the multi-channel Landau-Zener, atomic-orbital close-coupling, molecular-orbital close-coupling, and classical trajectory Monte Carlo methods for various collisional velocities relevant to astrophysics. X-ray spectra were computed for collisions of bare and H-like C to Al ions with H, He, and H2 with results compared to available experimental data. Using these line ratios, XSPEC models of CX emission in the northeast rim of the Cygnus Loop supernova remnant and the heliosphere are shown as examples with ion velocity dependence.\n\nHigh efficiency laser-assisted H - charge exchange for microsecond duration beams\n\nDOE PAGES\n\nCousineau, Sarah; Rakhman, Abdurahim; Kay, Martin; ...\n\n2017-12-26\n\nLaser-assisted stripping is a novel approach to H - charge exchange that overcomes long-standing limitations associated with the traditional, foil-based method of producing high-intensity, time-structured beams of protons.

V.; Karkatoua, D.; Kelley, R. L.; Kilbourne, C. A.; Lautenagger, M.\n\n2010-01-01\n\nCurrently, the only measurements of cosmological charge exchange have been made using low resolution, non-dispersive spectrometers like the PSPC on ROSAT and the CCD instruments on Chandra and XMM/Newton. However, upcoming cryogenic spectrometers on Astro-H and IXO will add vast new capabilities to investigate charge exchange in local objects such as comets and planetary atmospheres. They may also allow us to observe charge exchange in extra-solar objects such as galactic supernova remnants. With low spectral resolution instruments such as CCDs, x-ray emission due to charge exchange recombination really only provides information on the acceptor species, such as the solar wind. With the new breed of x-ray calorimeter instruments, emission from charge exchange becomes highly diagnostic allowing one to uniquely determine the acceptor species, ionization state, donor species and ionization state, and the relative velocity of the interaction. We will describe x-ray calorimeter instrumentation and its potential for charge exchange measurements in the near term. We will also touch on the instrumentation behind a decade of high resolution measurements of charge exchange using an x-ray calorimeter at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.\n\nCharge exchange molecular ion source\n\nDOEpatents\n\nVella, Michael C.\n\n2003-06-03\n\nIons, particularly molecular ions with multiple dopant nucleons per ion, are produced by charge exchange. An ion source contains a minimum of two regions separated by a physical barrier and utilizes charge exchange to enhance production of a desired ion species. The essential elements are a plasma chamber for production of ions of a first species, a physical separator, and a charge transfer chamber where ions of the first species from the plasma chamber undergo charge exchange or transfer with the reactant atom or molecules to produce ions of a second species. Molecular ions may be produced which are useful for ion implantation.\n\nCharge and Exchange\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\n2008-01-01\n\nEven though comets are basically giant dirty snowballs, a few years ago they surprised astronomers by emitting X-radiation. These X-rays are not produced by multi-million degree gas (as is often the case) but rather by a process called 'charge exchange'. In this process, ionized atoms (which have lost one or more electrons) which are carried within the solar wind collide with neutral atoms in the comet's coma. The solar wind ion can collide with and capture an electron from the neutral comet atom, and in doing so some of the energy of the collision is observed in the form of X-rays. This produces a glow of X-rays on the sunward side of the comet's atmosphere. Charge exchange can occur in a variety of astrophysical settings, and cometary charge exchange provides astronomers a means to study this process up close. The image above is a pretty picture of comet 73P/Schwassmann-Wachmann 3 passing by the Ring Nebula. This image was obtained by the ultraviolet and optical telescope (UVOT) on the Swift gamma-ray burst hunter. The UVOT observations help astronomers to study the structure and chemistry of the comet, while Swift's X-ray Telescope (XRT) simultaneously monitors the charge exchange process. Comet 73P/Schwassmann-Wachmann 3 is currently in the process of breaking up, and the UVOT observations show important details of how this breakup is occurring.\n\nIon-ion charge exchange processes.

One particular reaction, singly charged helium charge exchange, was investigated in detail. General trend of the singly charged heavy-ion charge exchange reaction can be inferred from the present study. Some of our results were presented at Proceedings of the Heavy-Ion Fusion Workshop, Argonne National Laboratory (September 1978) as a paper entitled Charge Exchange Between Singly Ionized Helium Ions, by B.H.

J. J.; Shah, Chintan; Kaastra, Jelle S.\n\n2018-03-01\n\nContext. Though theoretically expected, the charge exchange emission from galaxy clusters has never been confidently detected. Accumulating hints were reported recently, including a rather marginal detection with the Hitomi data of the Perseus cluster. As previously suggested, a detection of charge exchange line emission from galaxy clusters would not only impact the interpretation of the newly discovered 3.5 keV line, but also open up a new research topic on the interaction between hot and cold matter in clusters. Aim. We aim to perform the most systematic search for the O VIII charge exchange line in cluster spectra using the RGS on board XMM-Newton. Methods: We introduce a sample of 21 clusters observed with the RGS. In order to search for O VIII charge exchange, the sample selection criterion is a >35Ï detection of the O VIII LyÎ± line in the archival RGS spectra. The dominating thermal plasma emission is modeled and subtracted with a two-temperature thermal component, and the residuals are stacked for the line search. The systematic uncertainties in the fits are quantified by refitting the spectra with a varying continuum and line broadening. Results: By the residual stacking, we do find a hint of a line-like feature at 14.82 Ã , the characteristic wavelength expected for oxygen charge exchange. This feature has a marginal significance of 2.8Ï, and the average equivalent width is 2.5 Ã 10-4 keV. We further demonstrate that the putative feature can be barely affected by the systematic errors from continuum modeling and instrumental effects, or the atomic uncertainties of the neighboring thermal lines. Conclusions: Assuming a realistic temperature and abundance pattern, the physical model implied by the possible oxygen line agrees well with the theoretical model proposed previously to explain the reported 3.5 keV line. If the charge exchange source indeed exists, we expect that the oxygen abundance could have been overestimated by 8-22% in previous X\n\nSolar Wind Charge Exchange Studies Of Highly Charged Ions On Atomic Hydrogen\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDraganiÄ, I. N.; Seely, D. G.; McCammon, D.; Havener, C. C.\n\n2011-06-01\n\nAccurate studies of low-energy charge exchange (CX) are critical to understanding underlying soft X-ray radiation processes in the interaction of highly charged ions from the solar wind with the neutral atoms and molecules in the heliosphere, cometary comas, planetary atmospheres, interstellar winds, etc.. Particularly important are the CX cross sections for bare, H-like, and He-like ions of C, N, O and Ne, which are the dominant charge states for these heavier elements in the solar wind. Absolute total cross sections for single electron capture by H-like ions of C, N, O and fully-stripped O ions from atomic hydrogen have been measured in an expanded range of relative collision energies (5 eV/u-20 keV/u) and compared to previous H-oven measurements. The present measurements are performed using a merged-beams technique with intense highly charged ion beams extracted from a 14.5 GHz ECR ion source installed on a high voltage platform at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. For the collision energy range of 0.3 keV/u-3.3 keV/u, which corresponds to typical ion velocities in the solar wind, the new measurements are in good agreement with previous H-oven measurements. The experimental results are discussed in detail and compared with theoretical calculations where available.\n\nAstrophysical Applications for Charge-Exchange with H, He, and H2 Targets\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCumbee, Renata S.; Mullen, Patrick D.; Shelton, Robin L.; Schultz, David R.; Stancil, Phillip C.\n\n2018-01-01\n\nWhen a hot plasma collides with a cold neutral gas, interactions occur between the constituents at the interface of the collision, including charge exchange (CX). CX is a process in which an electron can be transferred from a neutral atom or molecule into an excited energy level of an ion. Following this transfer, the excited electron relaxes to lower energy levels, emitting X-rays. This process has been established as a primary source of X-ray emission within our solar system, such as when the solar wind interacts with cometary and planetary atmospheres, and outside of our solar system, such as in the hot outflows of starburst galaxies.As the CX X-ray emission spectrum varies greatly with collision velocity, it is critical that realistic CX data are included in X-ray spectral models in regions in which CX might be significant so that the ion abundance and plasma velocities can be estimated most accurately. Here, a set of CX X-ray line ratios and spectra will be shown for a variety of collision velocities for C-Cl ions colliding with H, He, and H2. An X-ray emission model including these line ratios performed in XSPEC will be presented for a region of the Cygnus Loop supernova remnant and the starburst galaxy M82 in order to highlight the variation in CX spectral models with collision energy and neutral target species.R.

W.\n\n1977-01-01\n\nThe theory for a spherical collisionless planetary corona is extended to include charge-exchange collisions between H(+) and H, which are assumed to constitute intermingled gases with different kinetic temperatures. The treatment is based on the conventional concept of a critical level (or exobase) above which the only collisions considered in the Boltzmann equation are those that resonantly exchange charge. Although the geometry treated is an oversimplification for a real planet, numerical examples are given for an idealized earth and Venus. For earth, an ion temperature of 4 times the neutral temperature, an ion density at the exobase of 14,000 per cu cm, and a plasmapause at 1.5 earth radii will raise the escape flux of H by a factor of 6. The total H above the exobase is changed by less than 1%. For Venus, conditions are examined that would account for the peculiar H distribution observed from Mariner 5. The plasma conditions required are not obviously outrageous by terrestrial standards, but the Mariner 5 ionosphere measurements did not show a high plasmapause at, say, 1.25 or 1.5 planetary radii, a fact that might argue against a charge-exchange model.\n\nCharge Exchange: Velocity Dependent X-ray Emission Modeling\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCumbee, Renata\n\n2017-06-01\n\nAtomic collisions play a fundamental role in astrophysics, plasma physics, and fusion physics. Here, we focus on charge exchange (CX) between hot ions and neutral atoms and molecules. Even though charge exchange calculations can provide vital information, including neutral and ion density distributions, ion temperatures, elemental abundances, and ion charge state distributions in the environments considered, both theoretical calculations and laboratory studies of these processes lack the necessary reliability and/or coverage. In order to better understand the spectra we observe in astrophysical environments in which both hot plasma and neutral gas are present, including comets, the heliosphere, supernova remnants, galaxy clusters, star forming galaxies, the outflows of starburst galaxies, and cooling flows of hot gas in the intracluster medium, a thorough CX X-ray model is needed. Included in this model should be a complete set of X-ray line ratios for relevant ion and neutral interactions for a range of energies.In this work, theoretical charge exchange emission spectra are produced using cross sections calculated with widely applied approaches including the quantum mechanical molecular orbital close coupling (QMOCC), atomic orbital close coupling (AOCC), classical trajectory Monte Carlo (CTMC), and the multichannel Landau-Zener (MCLZ) methods. When possible, theoretical data are benchmarked to experiments. Using a comprehensive, but still far from complete, CX database, new models are performed for a variety of X-ray emitting environments. In an attempt to describe the excess emission in X-rays of the starburst galaxy M82, Ne X CX line ratios are compared to line ratios observed in the region. A more complete XSPEC X-ray emission model is produced for H-like and He-like C-Al ions colliding with H and He for a range of energies; 200 to 5000 eV/u. This model is applied to the northeast rim of the Cygnus Loop supernova remnant in an attempt to determine the\n\nCharge exchange, ENAs and the loss of planetary ions at Mars\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKallio, E.; Janhunen, P.; SÃ¤les, T.\n\nNeither Mars nor Venus has a strong global intrinsic magnetic field and therefore the solar wind can flow close to the planets in high neutral density regions. Because of the formed direct interaction between the atmosphere/exosphere and the solar wind, the ionized atmospheric neutrals can be picked up by the solar wind. Charge exchange between solar wind protons and planetary neutrals, instead, produce energetic neutral hydrogen atoms (H-ENA) which are the manifestation of the direct interaction between the solar wind and planetary neutrals. Picked-up planetary O+ ions in turn form energetic neutral oxygen atoms (O-ENA) via charge exchange process. The ion escape, H-ENAs, O-ENAs and electrons will be investigated at Mars and Venus by two identical instruments: ASPERA-3 on MarsExpress (measurements started in Jan. 2004) and ASPERA-4 on VenusExpress (2006). We present a self-consistent, three-dimensional quasi-neutral hybrid (ions are particles, electrons a fluid) simulation to study Mars/Venus-solar wind interaction in general and ASPERA-3/4 measurements in particular. Our model includes three ion species (H+, O+, O2+), and contains charge exchange, ion-neutral and chemical reactions. We show results of quasi-neutral hybrid model runs that we have used to study the escape of planetary ions, the effects of planetary ions on the Martian plasma environment and the production and properties of fast hydrogen(H) and oxygen(O) ENAs near Mars. We also compare these hydrogen ENA images with the hydrogen ENA images that has been derived from an empirical flow model by line-of-sight integration. The advantage of the analytical gas dynamic like flow model is that it is computationally so fast that it provides a possibility to perform an ENA inversion, that is, to derive global plasma parameters from the measured ENA image.\n\nLaboratory Measurements of Solar-Wind/Comet X-Ray Emission and Charge Exchange Cross Sections\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nChutjian, A.; Cadez, I.; Greenwood, J. B.; Mawhorter, R. J.; Smith, S. J.; Lozano, J.\n\n2002-01-01\n\nThe detection of X-rays from comets such as Hyakutake, Hale-Bopp, d Arrest, and Linear as they approach the Sun has been unexpected and exciting. This phenomenon, moreover, should be quite general, occurring wherever a fast solar or stellar wind interacts with neutrals in a comet, a planetary atmosphere, or a circumstellar cloud. The process is, O(+8) + H2O --> O(+7*) + H2O(+), where the excited O(+7*) ions are the source of the X-ray emissions. Detailed modeling has been carried out of X-ray emissions in charge-transfer collisions of heavy solar-wind Highly Charged Ions (HCIs) and interstellar/interplanetary neutral clouds. In the interplanetary medium the solar wind ions, including protons, can charge exchange with interstellar H and He. This can give rise to a soft X-ray background that could be correlated with the long-term enhancements seen in the low-energy X-ray spectrum of ROSAT. Approximately 40% of the soft X-ray background detected by Exosat, ROSAT, Chandra, etc. is due to Charge Exchange (CXE): our whole heliosphere is glowing in the soft X-ray due to CXE.\n\nHigh Resolution X-ray Measurements Following Charge Exchange with Atomic H: Data for a New Observational Window on Diffuse Astrophysical Sources\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHavener, Charles\n\nIt is rapidly being realized that many X-ray astronomical investigations are being affected in one way or another by charge exchange emission. Metal abundance measurements in supernova remnants and in outflows from star-forming galaxies need to be corrected for this additional process, and all X-ray observations of low surface brightness objects, such as the outskirts of clusters, galactic halos, the intergalactic medium, and plasma emission from hot interstellar gas are seriously compromised by a highly variable and largely unpredictable foreground from the exchange of solar wind ions on interstellar neutrals within the Solar system. At the same time, charge exchange provides a new sensitivity to mixing at interfaces between hot and cold gas, including direct measurements of relative velocities. The new generation of facilities with microcalorimeter detectors, starting with Astro-H in 2015, will provide the energy resolution and throughput for extended sources required to take advantage of this process. But analysis requires accurate partial cross sections for the production of individual lines, and even the most sophisticated of current charge exchange models do not do this with adequate precision. We propose an inexpensive modification of the Wisconsin high-throughput XQC microcalorimeter instrument so that it can be used on the merged beam facility at Oak Ridge to make direct measurement of lines of interest from collisions between an assortment of heavy ions with neutral atomic hydrogen. In this beam-beam system, the entire range of astrophysically interesting relative velocities can be investigated. We will work closely with modelers to use these results to tune their models to give accurate results for additional ions.\n\nExcited State Atom-Ion Charge-Exchange\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLi, Ming; Makrides, Constantinos; Petrov, Alexander; Kotochigova, Svetlana\n\n2017-04-01\n\nWe theoretically investigate the exothermic charge-exchange reaction between an excited atom and a ground-state positive ion. In particular, we focus on MOT-excited Ca*(4s4p 1P) atoms colliding with ground-state Yb+ ions, which are under active study by the experimental group of E. Hudson at UCLA. Collisions between an excited atom and an ion are guided by two major contributions to the long-range interaction potentials, the induction C4 /R4 and charge-quadrupole C3 /R3 potentials, and their coupling by the electron-exchange interaction. Our model of these forces leads to close-coupling equations for multiple reaction channels. We find several avoided crossings between the potentials that couple to the nearby asymptotic limits of Yb*+Ca+, some of which can possibly provide large charge exchange rate coefficients above 10-10 cm3 / s.

D.; Cumbee, R. S.; Lyons, D.\n\nCharge exchange (CX) has emerged in X-ray emission modeling as a significant process that must be considered in many astrophysical environmentsâparticularly comets. Comets host an interaction between solar wind ions and cometary neutrals to promote solar wind charge exchange (SWCX). X-ray observatories provide astronomers and astrophysicists with data for many X-ray emitting comets that are impossible to accurately model without reliable CX data. Here, we utilize a streamlined set of computer programs that incorporate the multi-channel LandauâZener theory and a cascade model for X-ray emission to generate cross sections and X-ray line ratios for a variety of bare and non-baremoreÂ Â» ion single electron capture (SEC) collisions. Namely, we consider collisions between the solar wind constituent bare and H-like ions of C, N, O, Ne, Na, Mg, Al, and Si and the cometary neutrals H{sub 2}O, CO, CO{sub 2}, OH, and O. To exemplify the application of this data, we model the X-ray emission of Comet C/2000 WM1 (linear) using the CX package in SPEX and find excellent agreement with observations made with the XMM-Newton RGS detector. Our analyses show that the X-ray intensity is dominated by SWCX with H, while H{sub 2}O plays a secondary role. This is the first time, to our knowledge, that CX cross sections have been implemented into a X-ray spectral fitting package to determine the H to H{sub 2}O ratio in cometary atmospheres. The CX data sets are incorporated into the modeling packages SPEX and Kronos .Â«Â less\n\nCharge Exchange of Highly Charged Ne and Mg Ions with H and He\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLyons, D.; Cumbee, R. S.; Stancil, P. C.\n\n2017-10-01\n\nCross sections for single electron capture (SEC), or charge exchange (CX), in collisions of Ne(8-10)+ and Mg(8-12)+ with H and He, are computed using an approximate multichannel Landau-Zener (MCLZ) formalism. Final-state-resolved cross sections for the principal (n), orbital angular momentum (â), and where appropriate, total spin angular momentum (S) quantum numbers are explicitly computed, except for the incident bare ions Ne10+ and Mg12+. In the latter two cases, n{\\\\ell }-resolution is obtained from analytical â-distribution functions applied to n-resolved MCLZ cross sections. In all cases, the cross sections are computed over the collision energy range 1 meV/u to 50 keV/u with LZ parameters estimated from atomic energies obtained from experiment, theory, or, in the case of high-lying Rydberg levels, estimated with a quantum defect approach. Errors in the energy differences in the adiabatic potentials at the avoided crossing distances give the largest contribution to the uncertainties in the cross sections, which are expected to increase with decreasing cross section magnitude. The energy differences are deduced here with the Olson-Salop-Tauljberg radial coupling model. Proper selection of an â-distribution function for bare ion collisions introduces another level of uncertainty into the results. Comparison is made to existing experimental or theoretical results when available, but such data are absent for most considered collision systems. The n{\\\\ell }S-resolved SEC cross sections are used in an optically thin cascade simulation to predict X-ray spectra and line ratios that will aid in modeling the X-ray emission in environments where CX is an important mechanism. Details on a MCLZ computational package, Stueckelberg, are also provided.\n\nA comparison of empirical and experimental O7+, O8+, and O/H values, with applications to terrestrial solar wind charge exchange\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWhittaker, Ian C.; Sembay, Steve\n\n2016-07-01\n\nSolar wind charge exchange occurs at Earth between the neutral planetary exosphere and highly charged ions of the solar wind. The main challenge in predicting the resultant photon flux in the X-ray energy bands is due to the interaction efficiency, known as the Î± value. This study produces experimental Î± values at the Earth, for oxygen emission in the range of 0.5-0.7 keV. Thirteen years of data from the Advanced Composition Explorer are examined, comparing O7+ and O8+ abundances, as well as O/H to other solar wind parameters allowing all parameters in the Î±O7,8+ calculation to be estimated based on solar wind velocity. Finally, a table is produced for a range of solar wind speeds giving average O7+ and O8+ abundances, O/H, and Î±O7,8+ values.\n\nCharge exchange in cometary coma: Discovery of H- ions in the solar wind close to comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko.\n\nPubMed\n\nBurch, J L; Cravens, T E; Llera, K; Goldstein, R; Mokashi, P; Tzou, C-Y; Broiles, T\n\n2015-07-16\n\nAs Rosetta was orbiting comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, the Ion and Electron Sensor detected negative particles with angular distributions like those of the concurrently measured solar wind protons but with fluxes of only about 10% of the proton fluxes and energies of about 90% of the proton energies. Using well-known cross sections and energy-loss data, it is determined that the fluxes and energies of the negative particles are consistent with the production of H - ions in the solar wind by double charge exchange with molecules in the coma.\n\nIon temperatures in HIP-1 and SUMMA from charge-exchange neutral optical emission spectra\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nPatch, R. W.; Lauver, M. R.\n\n1976-01-01\n\nIon temperatures were obtained from observations of the H sub alpha, D sub alpha, and He 587.6 nm lines emitted from hydrogen, deuterium, and helium plasmas in the SUMMA and HIP-1 mirror devices at Lewis Research Center. Steady state discharges were formed by applying a radially inward dc electric field between cylindrical or annular anodes and hollow cathodes located at the peaks of the mirrors. The ion temperatures were found from the Doppler broadening of the charge-exchange components of spectral lines. A statistical method was developed for obtaining scaling relations of ion temperature as a function of current, voltage, and magnetic flux density. Derivations are given that take into account triangular monochromator slit functions, loss cones, and superimposed charge-exchange processes. In addition, the Doppler broadening was found to be sensitive to the influence of drift on charge-exchange cross section. The effects of finite ion-cyclotron radius, cascading, and delayed emission are reviewed.\n\nAnatomy of charge-exchange straggling\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSigmund, P.; Osmani, O.; Schinner, A.\n\n2014-11-01\n\nWe have studied charge-exchange straggling theoretically for swift krypton and silicon ions and five target gases in the MeV/u energy regime. We find a pronounced two-peak structure for all ion-target combinations. The peak at the highest energy appears around the velocity where the bare ion and the one-electron ion are equally abundant in the equilibrium charge distribution. Correspondingly, the low-energy peak appears near the cross-over between the charge fractions of the two- and the three-electron ion. The possibility of further peaks at lower energies is discussed. Our findings are compared with recent experimental results on straggling of krypton beams.\n\nCarbon charge exchange analysis in the ITER-like wall environment.\n\nPubMed\n\nMenmuir, S; Giroud, C; Biewer, T M; Coffey, I H; Delabie, E; Hawkes, N C; Sertoli, M\n\n2014-11-01\n\nCharge exchange spectroscopy has long been a key diagnostic tool for fusion plasmas and is well developed in devices with Carbon Plasma-Facing Components. Operation with the ITER-like wall at JET has resulted in changes to the spectrum in the region of the Carbon charge exchange line at 529.06 nm and demonstrates the need to revise the core charge exchange analysis for this line. An investigation has been made of this spectral region in different plasma conditions and the revised description of the spectral lines to be included in the analysis is presented.\n\nStatus of Charge Exchange Cross Section Measurements for Highly Charged Ions on Atomic Hydrogen\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDraganic, I. N.; Havener, C. C.; Schultz, D. R.; Seely, D. G.; Schultz, P. C.\n\n2011-05-01\n\nTotal cross sections of charge exchange (CX) for C5+, N6+, and O7+ ions on ground state atomic hydrogen are measured in an extended collision energy range of 1 - 20,000 eV/u. Absolute CX measurements are performed using an improved merged-beams technique with intense highly charged ion beams extracted from a 14.5 GHz ECR ion source mounted on a high voltage platform. In order to improve the problematic H+ signal collection for these exoergic CX collisions at low relative energies, a new double focusing electrostatic analyzer was installed. Experimental CX data are in good agreement with all previous H-oven relative measurements at higher collision energies. We compare our results with the most recent molecular orbital close-coupling (MOCC) and atomic orbital close-coupling (AOCC) theoretical calculations.

R.\n\n1977-01-01\n\nThe charge exchange plasma generated by an ion thruster was investigated experimentally using both 5 cm and 15 cm thrusters. Results are shown for wide ranges of radial distance from the thruster and angle from the beam direction. Considerations of test environment, as well as distance from the thruster, indicate that a valid simulation of a thruster on a spacecraft was obtained. A calculation procedure and a sample calculation of charge exchange plasma density and saturation electron current density are included.\n\nRing current proton decay by charge exchange\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nSmith, P. H.; Hoffman, R. A.; Fritz, T.\n\n1975-01-01\n\nExplorer 45 measurements during the recovery phase of a moderate magnetic storm have confirmed that the charge exchange decay mechanism can account for the decay of the storm-time proton ring current. Data from the moderate magnetic storm of 24 February 1972 was selected for study since a symmetrical ring current had developed and effects due to asymmetric ring current losses could be eliminated. It was found that after the initial rapid decay of the proton flux, the equatorially mirroring protons in the energy range 5 to 30 keV decayed throughout the L-value range of 3.5 to 5.0 at the charge exchange decay rate calculated by Liemohn. After several days of decay, the proton fluxes reached a lower limit where an apparent equilibrium was maintained, between weak particle source mechanisms and the loss mechanisms, until fresh protons were injected into the ring current region during substorms. While other proton loss mechanisms may also be operating, the results indicate that charge exchange can entirely account for the storm-time proton ring current decay, and that this mechanism must be considered in all studies involving the loss of proton ring current particles.\n\nH- and He-like Charge-Exchange Induced X-ray Emission due to Ion Collisions with H, He, and H2\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCumbee, Renata; Mullen, Patrick; Miller, Ansley; Lyons, David; Shelton, Robin L.; Schultz, David R.; Stancil, Phillip C.; Leutenegger, Maurice A.\n\n2017-08-01\n\nWhen a hot plasma collides with a cold neutral gas interactions occur between the microscopic constituents including charge exchange (CX). CX is a process in which an electron can be transferred from a neutral atom or molecule into an excited energy level of an ion. Following this transfer, the excited electron relaxes to lower energy levels, emitting X-rays. This process has been established as a primary source of X-ray emission within our solar system, such as when the solar wind interacts with cometary and planetary atmospheres, and outside of our solar system, such as in the hot outflows of starburst galaxies.Since the CX X-ray emission spectrum varies greatly with collision velocity, it is critical that realistic CX data are included in X-ray spectral models of astrophysical environments in which CX might be significant in order to correctly estimate the ion abundance and plasma velocities. Here, line ratios and spectra are computed using theoretical CX cross sections obtained with the multi-channel Landau-Zener, atomic-orbital close-coupling, and classical-trajectory Monte Carlo methods for a variety of collision energies relevant to various astrophysical environments. Collisions of bare and H-like C, N, O, Ne, Mg, Al, Si, P, S, and Cl ions are shown with H, He, and H2 as the neutral collision targets. An X-ray model using line ratios for C-Si ions is then performed within XSPEC for a region of the Cygnus Loop supernova remnant for 8 collision energies in order to highlight the variation in CX spectral models with collision energy.R.

Calculations for (p,n) and (He-3,H-3) reactions are made and compared with experimental results for C-12, O-16, and Al-27 targets. Coherent effects are shown to lead to an important role for inelastic multiple scattering terms when light projectiles are considered.\n\nSuzaku Observations of Charge Exchange Emission from Solar System Objects\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nEzoe, Y.; Fujimoto, R.; Yamasaki, N.

M.; Vaeck, N.\n\n2018-04-01\n\nThe charge transfer process in collisions of excited (n = 2, 3) hydrogen atoms with He+ and in collisions of excited helium atoms with H+ is studied theoretically. A combination of a fully quantum-mechanical method and a semi-classical approach is employed to calculate the charge-exchange cross sections at collision energies from 0.1 eV uâ1 up to 1 keV uâ1. These methods are based on accurate ab initio potential energy curves and non-adiabatic couplings for the molecular ion HeH+. Charge transfer can occur either in singlet or in triplet states, and the differences between the singlet and triplet spin manifolds are discussed. The dependence of the cross section on the quantum numbers n and l of the initial state is demonstrated. The isotope effect on the charge transfer cross sections, arising at low collision energy when H is substituted by D or T, is investigated. Rate coefficients are calculated for all isotopes up to 106 K. Finally, the impact of the present calculations on models of laboratory plasmas is discussed.\n\nA review of studies on ion thruster beam and charge-exchange plasmas\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nCarruth, M.

The history of plasma beam research is recounted, emphasizing experiments on beam neutralization, expansion of the beam, and determination of beam parameters such as electron temperature, plasma density, and plasma potential. The development of modern electron bombardment ion thrusters is treated, detailing experimental results. Studies on charge-exchange plasma are discussed, showing results such as the relationship between neutralizer emission current and plasma beam potential, ion energies as a function of neutralizer bias, charge-exchange ion current collected by an axially moving Faraday cup-RPA for 8-cm and 30-cm ion thrusters, beam density and potential data from a 15-cm ion thruster, and charge-exchange ion flow around a 30-cm thruster. A 20-cm thruster electrical configuration is depicted and facility effects are discussed. Finally, plasma modeling is covered in detail for plasma beam and charge-exchange plasma.\n\nEvidence of charge exchange pumping in calcium-xenon system\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nChubb, D. L.\n\n1973-01-01\n\nCharge exchange between xenon ions and calcium atoms may produce an inversion between the 5s or 4d and 4p energy levels of the calcium ions. A low power flowing xenon plasma seeded with calcium was utilized to determine if charge exchange or electron collisions populate the 5s and 4d levels Ca(+). Line intensity ratios proportional to the density ratios n5s/n4p and n4d/n4p were measured. From the dependence of these intensity ratios on power input to the xenon plasma it was concluded that charge exchange pumping of the 5s and 4d levels predominates over electron collisional pumping of these levels. Also, by comparing intensity ratios obtained using argon and krypton in place of xenon with those obtained in xenon the same conclusion was made.\n\nSystematics of heavy-ion charge-exchange straggling\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSigmund, P.; Schinner, A.\n\n2016-10-01\n\nThe dependence of heavy-ion charge-exchange straggling on the beam energy has been studied theoretically for several ion-target combinations. Our previous work addressed ions up to krypton, while the present study focuses on heavier ions, especially uranium. Particular attention has been paid to a multiple-peak structure which has been predicted theoretically in our previous work. For high-Z1 and high-Z2 systems, exemplified by U in Au, we identify three maxima in the energy dependence of charge-exchange straggling, while the overall magnitude is comparable with that of collisional straggling. Conversely, for U in C, charge-exchange straggling dominates, but only two peaks lie in the energy range where we presently are able to produce credible predictions. For U-Al we find good agreement with experiment in the energy range around the high-energy maximum. The position of the high-energy peak - which is related to processes in the projectile K shell - is found to scale as Z12, in contrast to the semi-empirical Z13/2 dependence proposed by Yang et al. Measurements for heavy ions in heavy targets are suggested in order to reconcile a major discrepancy between the present calculations and the frequently-used formula by Yang et al.\n\nCharacterization of an atomic hydrogen source for charge exchange experiments\n\nDOE PAGES\n\nLeutenegger, M.

We exploit the fact that the charge exchange state-selective capture cross sections are very different for atomic and molecular hydrogen incident on the same ions, enabling a clear spectroscopic diagnostic of the neutral species.\n\nPion single and double charge exchange in the resonance region: Dynamical corrections\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nJohnson, Mikkel B.; Siciliano, E. R.\n\n1983-04-01\n\nWe consider pion-nucleus elastic scattering and single- and double-charge-exchange scattering to isobaric analog states near the (3,3) resonance within an isospin invariant framework. We extend previous theories by introducing terms into the optical potential U that are quadratic in density and consistent with isospin invariance of the strong interaction. We study the sensitivity of single and double charge exchange angular distributions to parameters of the second-order potential both numerically, by integrating the Klein-Gordon equation, and analytically, by using semiclassical approximations that explicate the dependence of the exact numerical results to the parameters of U. The magnitude and shape of double charge exchange angular distributions are more sensitive to the isotensor term in U than has been hitherto appreciated. An examination of recent experimental data shows that puzzles in the shape of the 18O(Ï+, Ï-)18Ne angular distribution at 164 MeV and in the A dependence of the forward double charge exchange scattering on 18O, 26Mg, 42Ca, and 48Ca at the same energy may be resolved by adding an isotensor term in U.

E.\n\n1980-01-01\n\nMotivated by recent observations of highly variable hot plasma composition in the magnetosphere, control of the ionospheric escape flux composition by low-altitude particle dynamics and ion chemistry has been investigated for an e(-), H(+), O(+) ionosphere. It is found that the fraction of the steady state escape flux which is O(+) can be controlled very sensitively by the occurrence of parallel or transverse ion acceleration at altitudes below the altitude where the neutral oxygen density falls rapidly below the neutral hydrogen density and the ionospheric source of O(+) tends to be rapidly converted by charge exchange to H(+). The acceleration is required both to overcome the gravitational confinement of O(+) and to violate charge exchange equilibrium so that the neutral hydrogen atmosphere appears 'optically' thin to escaping O(+). Constraints are placed on the acceleration processes, and it is shown that O(+) escape is facilitated by observed ionospheric responses to magnetic activity.\n\nMeasurement of deuterium density profiles in the H-mode steep gradient region using charge exchange recombination spectroscopy on DIII-D\n\nDOE PAGES\n\nHaskey, S.

I.; Biedermann, C.; Radtke, R.; Fussmann, G.\n\n2007-03-01\n\nX-ray emission of highly charged argon ions following charge exchange collisions with argon atoms has been measured as a function of projectile energy. The ions are extracted from the Electron Beam Ion Trap (EBIT) in Berlin and selected according to their massto-charge ratios. Experiments focussed on hydrogen-like and bare argon ions which were decelerated from 125q eV/amu to below 0.25q eV/amu prior to interaction with an argon gas target. The x-ray spectra recorded probe the cascading transitions resulting from electron capture into Rydberg states and are found to vary significantly with collision velocity. This indicates a shift in the orbital angular momentum of the capture state. Hardness ratios are observed to increase with decreasing projectile energy though at a rate which differs from the results of simulations. For comparison, measurements of the x-ray emission following charge exchange within the trap were carried out and are in agreement with the findings of the EBIT group at LLNL. Both of these in situ measurements, however, are in discrepancy with the results of the experiments using extracted ions.\n\nLaboratory simulation of charge exchange-produced X-ray emission from comets.\n\nPubMed\n\nBeiersdorfer, P; Boyce, K R; Brown, G V; Chen, H; Kahn, S M; Kelley, R L; May, M; Olson, R E; Porter, F S; Stahle, C K; Tillotson, W A\n\n2003-06-06\n\nIn laboratory experiments using the engineering spare microcalorimeter detector from the ASTRO-E satellite mission, we recorded the x-ray emission of highly charged ions of carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen, which simulates charge exchange reactions between heavy ions in the solar wind and neutral gases in cometary comae.

Photodiodes (XUV detectors) measure photonic radiated power from about 10eV to 10keV, while pyrobolometers (thermal detectors) measure both photonic radiated power and power carried by charge-exchange neutrals. Compared to other thermal detectors, pyrobolometers have very good time resolution. To accurately calibrate the individual detectors, an electron gun producing a modulated square wave output has been set up to carefully calibrate each new pyrobolometer to be placed on MST. When viewing the MST plasma, subtraction of the data from the photodiode-pyrobolometer pairs allows one to determine the net power loss due to charge-exchange neutrals. These measurements are important in the calculation of ion energy balance, and it is potentially important in understanding the difference in the temperatures reached by majority and impurity ions during magnetic-reconnection ion-heating events. Since toroidal and poloidal asymmetries in charge exchange are possible, a distributed array of detector pairs will facilitate a better estimate of global power loss.

An analytic solution of the governing equations describing the radial distribution of the neutral and ion densities is found. The new solution is compared to the well-known solution of the equations containing only ionization terms. Neglecting recombination causes a significant overestimate of the ion density in the vicinity of the comet. An axisymmetric model of the solar wind-cometary interaction is considered, taking into account the loss of solar wind ions due to charge exchange. The calculations predict that for active comets, solar wind absorption due to charge exchange becomes important at a few thousand kilometers from the nucleus, and a surface separating the shocked solar wind from the cometary ionosphere develops in this region. These calculations are in reasonable agreement with the few observations available for the ionopause location at comets.\n\nCharge-Neutral Constant pH Molecular Dynamics Simulations Using a Parsimonious Proton Buffer.\n\nPubMed\n\nDonnini, Serena; Ullmann, R Thomas; Groenhof, Gerrit; GrubmÃ¼ller, Helmut\n\n2016-03-08\n\nIn constant pH molecular dynamics simulations, the protonation states of titratable sites can respond to changes of the pH and of their electrostatic environment. Consequently, the number of protons bound to the biomolecule, and therefore the overall charge of the system, fluctuates during the simulation. To avoid artifacts associated with a non-neutral simulation system, we introduce an approach to maintain neutrality of the simulation box in constant pH molecular dynamics simulations, while maintaining an accurate description of all protonation fluctuations. Specifically, we introduce a proton buffer that, like a buffer in experiment, can exchange protons with the biomolecule enabling its charge to fluctuate. To keep the total charge of the system constant, the uptake and release of protons by the buffer are coupled to the titration of the biomolecule with a constraint. We find that, because the fluctuation of the total charge (number of protons) of a typical biomolecule is much smaller than the number of titratable sites of the biomolecule, the number of buffer sites required to maintain overall charge neutrality without compromising the charge fluctuations of the biomolecule, is typically much smaller than the number of titratable sites, implying markedly enhanced simulation and sampling efficiency.\n\nCharge exchange avalanche at the cometopause\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGombosi, T. I.\n\n1987-11-01\n\nA sharp transition from a solar wind proton dominated flow to a plasma population primarily consisting of relatively cold cometary heavy ions has been observed at a cometocentric distance of about 160,000 km by the VEGA and GIOTTO missions. This boundary (the cometopause) was thought to be related to charge transfer processes, but its location and thickness are inconsistent with conventionally estimated ion - neutral coupling boundaries. In this paper a two-fluid model is used to investigate the major physical processes at the cometopause. By adopting observed comet Halley parameters the model is able to reproduce the location and the thickness of this charge exchange boundary.\n\nNumerical calculation of charge exchange cross sections for plasma diagnostics\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMendez, Luis\n\n2016-09-01\n\nThe diagnostics of impurity density and temperature in the plasma core in tokamak plasmas is carried out by applying the charge exchange recombination spectroscopy (CXRS) technique, where a fast beam of H atoms collides with the plasma particles leading to electron capture reactions with the impurity ions. The diagnostics is based on the emission of the excited ions formed in the electron capture. The application of the CXRS requires the knowledge of accurate state-selective cross sections, which in general are not accessible experimentally, and the calculation of cross sections for the high n capture levels, required for the diagnostics in the intermediate energy domain of the probe beam, is particularly difficult. In this work, we present a lattice numerical method to solve the time dependent SchrÃ¶dinger equation. The method is based on the GridTDSE package, it is applicable in the wide energy range 1 - 500 keV/u and can be used to assess the accuracy of previous calculations. The application of the method will be illustrated with calculations for collisions of multiply charged ions with H.

D.\n\n2012-01-01\n\nOn March 31st. 2001, a coronal mass ejection pushed the subsolar magnetopause to the vicinity of geosynchronous orbit at 6.6 RE. The NASA/GSFC Community Coordinated Modeling Center (CCMe) employed a global magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model to simulate the solar wind-magnetosphere interaction during the peak of this geomagnetic storm. Robertson et aL then modeled the expected 50ft X-ray emission due to solar wind charge exchange with geocoronal neutrals in the dayside cusp and magnetosheath. The locations of the bow shock, magnetopause and cusps were clearly evident in their simulations. Another geomagnetic storm took place on July 14, 2000 (Bastille Day). We again modeled X-ray emission due to solar wind charge exchange, but this time as observed from a moving spacecraft. This paper discusses the impact of spacecraft location on observed X-ray emission and the degree to which the locations of the bow shock and magnetopause can be detected in images.\n\nApplication of linear pH gradients for the modeling of ion exchange chromatography: Separation of monoclonal antibody monomer from aggregates.\n\nPubMed\n\nKluters, Simon; Wittkopp, Felix; JÃ¶hnck, Matthias; Frech, Christian\n\n2016-02-01\n\nThe mobile phase pH is a key parameter of every ion exchange chromatography process. However, mechanistic insights into the pH influence on the ion exchange chromatography equilibrium are rare. This work describes a mechanistic model capturing salt and pH influence in ion exchange chromatography. The pH dependence of the characteristic protein charge and the equilibrium constant is introduced to the steric mass action model based on a protein net charge model considering the number of amino acids interacting with the stationary phase. This allows the description of the adsorption equilibrium of the chromatographed proteins as a function of pH. The model parameters were determined for a monoclonal antibody monomer, dimer, and a higher aggregated species based on a manageable set of pH gradient experiments. Without further modification of the model parameters the transfer to salt gradient elution at fixed pH is demonstrated. A lumped rate model was used to predict the separation of the monoclonal antibody monomer/aggregate mixture in pH gradient elution and for a pH step elution procedure-also at increased protein loadings up to 48 g/L packed resin. The presented model combines both salt and pH influence and may be useful for the development and deeper understanding of an ion exchange chromatography separation.

John W.;\n\n2011-01-01\n\nX-ray spectroscopic measurements of the Cygnus Loop supernova remnant indicate that metal abundances throughout most of the remnant s rim are depleted to approx.0.2 times the solar value. However, recent X-ray studies have revealed in some narrow regions along the outermost rim anomalously \"enhanced\" abundances (up to approx. 1 solar). The reason for these anomalous abundances is not understood. Here, we examine X-ray spectra in annular sectors covering nearly the entire rim of the Cygnus Loop using Suzaku (21 pointings) and XMM-Newton (1 pointing). We find that spectra in the \"enhanced\" abundance regions commonly show a strong emission feature at approx.0.7 keV. This feature is likely a complex of He-like O K(gamma + delta + epsilon), although other possibilities cannot be fully excluded. The intensity of this emission relative to He-like O K(alpha) appears to be too high to be explained as thermal emission. This fact, as well as the spatial concentration of the anomalous abundances in the outermost rim, leads us to propose an origin from charge-exchange processes between neutrals and H-like O. We show that the presence of charge-exchange emission could lead to the inference of apparently \"enhanced\" metal abundances using pure thermal emission models. Accounting for charge-exchange emission, the actual abundances could be uniformly low throughout the rim. The overall abundance depletion remains an open question.

L., E-mail: Valery.Lyuboshitz@jinr.ru; Lyuboshitz, V. V.\n\n2011-02-15\n\nThe structure of the nucleon charge-exchange process n + p {yields} p + n is investigated basing on the isotopic invariance of the nucleon-nucleon scattering. Using the operator of permutation of the spin projections of the neutron and proton, the connection between the spin matrices, describing the amplitude of the nucleon charge-exchange process at zero angle and the amplitude of the elastic scattering of the neutron on the proton in the 'backward' direction, has been considered. Due to the optical theorem, the spin-independent part of the differential cross section of the process n + p {yields} p + n atmoreÂ Â» zero angle for unpolarized particles is expressed through the difference of total cross sections of unpolarized proton-proton and neutron-proton scattering. Meantime, the spin-dependent part of this cross section is proportional to the differential cross section of the deuteron charge-exchange breakup d + p {yields} (pp) + n at zero angle at the deuteron momentum k{sub d} = 2 k{sub n} (k{sub n} is the initial neutron momentum). Analysis shows that, assuming the real part of the spin-independent term of the 'forward' amplitude of the process n + p {yields} p + n to be smaller or of the same order as compared with the imaginary part, in the wide range of neutron laboratory momenta k{sub n} > 700 MeV/c the main contribution into the differential cross section of the process n + p {yields} p + n at zero angle is provided namely by the spin-dependent term.Â«Â less\n\nPopulation inversion calculations using near resonant charge exchange as a pumping mechanism\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nChubb, D. L.; Rose, J. R.\n\n1972-01-01\n\nNear resonance charge exchange between ions of a large ionization potential gas such as helium or neon and vapors of metals such as zinc, cadmium, selenium, or tellurium has produced laser action in the metal ion gas. The possibility of obtaining population inversions in near resonant charge exchange systems (Xe-Ca, Xe-Mg, Xe-Sr, Xe-Ba, Ar-Mg, N-Ca) was investigated. The analysis is an initial value problem that utilizes rate equations for the densities of relevant levels of the laser gas (Ca, Ba, Mg, or Sr) and an electron energy equation. Electron excitation rates are calculated using the Bohr-Thomson approximation for the cross section. Approximations to experimental values of the electron ionization cross section and the ion-atom charge exchange cross section are used. Preliminary results have been obtained for the Ca-Xe system and show that it is possible to obtain gains greater than 10 to the 14th power/m with inversion times up to 8x10 to the minus 7th power second. A possible charge exchange laser system using a MPD arc plasma accelerator is also described.\n\nThe formation of excited atoms during charge exchange between hydrogen ions and alkali atoms. Ph.D. Thesis\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nNieman, R. A.\n\n1971-01-01\n\nThe charge exchange cross sections for protons and various alkali atoms are calculated using the classical approximation of Gryzinski. It is assumed that the hydrogen atoms resulting from charge exchange exist in all possible excited states. Charge transfer collisions between protons and potassium as well as protons and sodium atoms are studied. The energy range investigated is between 4 and 30 keV. The theoretical calculations of the capture cross section and the cross section for the creation of metastable 2S hydrogen are compared to experimental values. Good quantitative agreement is found for the capture cross section but only qualitative agreement for the metastable cross section. Analysis of the Lyman alpha window in molecular oxygen suggests that measured values of the metastable cross section may be in error. Thick alkali target data are also presented. This allows the determination of the total electron loss cross section. Finally, some work was done with H2(+).\n\nCharge exchange cooling in the tandem mirror plasma confinement apparatus\n\nDOEpatents\n\nLogan, B.

Ions are extracted from an external helicon plasma source and subsequently accelerated radially into an electrostatic potential well set up by a semi-transparent cathode grid inside the HELIOS spherical chamber. Analysis of fast neutrals produced by charge exchange between energetic ions and background gas yields information on primary ion energy spectra, as well as a quantitative measure of charge exchange as an energy loss mechanism in IEC devices. Preliminary data with helium is used to benchmark the two-charge-state helium formalism of VICTER, a numerical code on spherically convergent ion flow, as it relates to IEC operation with helium-3 fuel.

Tugarinov et al., Rev. Sci. Instrum. 74, 2075 (2003)]. To this purpose such an instrument has been developed consisting of three separate wavelength channels (to measure simultaneously He/Be, C/Ne, and H/D/T together with the Doppler shifted direct emission of the diagnostic neutral beam, the beam emission (BES) signal), combining high dispersion (0.02 nm/pixel), sufficient resolution (0.2 nm), high efficiency (55%), and extended wavelength range (14 nm) at high etendue. The combined measurement of the BES along the same sightline within a third wavelength range provides the possibility for in situ calibration of the charge eXchange recombination spectroscopy signals. In addition, the option is included to use the same instrument for measurements of the fast fluctuations of the beam emission intensity up to 2 MHz, with the aim to study MHD activity.\n\nCharge Exchange Reaction in Dopant-Assisted Atmospheric Pressure Chemical Ionization and Atmospheric Pressure Photoionization.\n\nPubMed\n\nVaikkinen, Anu; Kauppila, Tiina J; Kostiainen, Risto\n\n2016-08-01\n\nThe efficiencies of charge exchange reaction in dopant-assisted atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (DA-APCI) and dopant-assisted atmospheric pressure photoionization (DA-APPI) mass spectrometry (MS) were compared by flow injection analysis. Fourteen individual compounds and a commercial mixture of 16 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons were chosen as model analytes to cover a wide range of polarities, gas-phase ionization energies, and proton affinities. Chlorobenzene was used as the dopant, and methanol/water (80/20) as the solvent. In both techniques, analytes formed the same ions (radical cations, protonated molecules, and/or fragments). However, in DA-APCI, the relative efficiency of charge exchange versus proton transfer was lower than in DA-APPI. This is suggested to be because in DA-APCI both dopant and solvent clusters can be ionized, and the formed reagent ions can react with the analytes via competing charge exchange and proton transfer reactions. In DA-APPI, on the other hand, the main reagents are dopant-derived radical cations, which favor ionization of analytes via charge exchange. The efficiency of charge exchange in both DA-APPI and DA-APCI was shown to depend heavily on the solvent flow rate, with best efficiency seen at lowest flow rates studied (0.05 and 0.1 mL/min). Both DA-APCI and DA-APPI showed the radical cation of chlorobenzene at 0.05-0.1 mL/min flow rate, but at increasing flow rate, the abundance of chlorobenzene M(+.) decreased and reagent ion populations deriving from different gas-phase chemistry were recorded. The formation of these reagent ions explains the decreasing ionization efficiency and the differences in charge exchange between the techniques.

Recently developed optical approaches such as ultrafast demagnetization, spin-transfer and spin-orbit torques open new pathways to manipulate spin through its interaction with photon, orbit, charge or phonon. However, these processes are limited by either the long thermal recovery time or the low-temperature requirement. Here we experimentally demonstrate ultrafast coherent spin precession via optical charge-transfer processes in the exchange-coupled Fe/CoO system at room temperature. The efficiency of spin precession excitation is significantly higher and the recoverymoreÂ Â» time of the exchange-coupling torque is much shorter than for the demagnetization procedure, which is desirable for fast switching. The exchange coupling is a key issue in spin valves and tunnelling junctions, and hence our findings will help promote the development of exchange-coupled device concepts for ultrafast coherent spin manipulation.Â«Â less\n\nUltrafast spin exchange-coupling torque via photo-excited charge-transfer processes\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMa, X.; Fang, F.; Li, Q.; Zhu, J.; Yang, Y.; Wu, Y.

The total exchange-correlation charge, QXC = â«qXC(r)âdr, determines the rate of the asymptotic decay of vXC(r). If QXC â 0, the potential falls off as QXCâr; if QXC = 0, the decay is faster than coulombic. According to this rule, exchange-correlation potentials derived from standard generalized gradient approximations (GGAs) should have QXC = 0, but accurate numerical calculations give QXC â 0. We resolve this paradox by showing that the charge density qXC(r) associated with every GGA consists of two types of contributions: a continuous distribution and point charges arising from the singularities of vXC(r) at each nucleus. Numerical integration of qXC(r) accounts for the continuous charge but misses the point charges. When the point-charge contributions are included, one obtains the correct QXC value. These findings provide an important caveat for attempts to devise asymptotically correct Kohn-Sham potentials by modeling the distribution qXC(r).\n\nImproved edge charge exchange recombination spectroscopy in DIII-D\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nChrystal, C.; Burrell, K.

In this work, a stoichiometric displacement model was used to describe the retention behavior of lysozyme on SP Sepharose FF and a monoclonal antibody on Fractogel SO3 (S) in linear salt and pH gradient elution. The pH dependence of the binding charge B in the linear gradient elution model is introduced using a protein net charge model, while the pH dependence of the equilibrium constant is based on a thermodynamic approach. The model parameter and pH dependences are calculated from linear salt gradient elutions at different pH values as well as from linear pH gradient elutions at different fixed salt concentrations. The application of the model for the well-characterized protein lysozyme resulted in almost identical model parameters based on either linear salt or pH gradient elution data. For the antibody, only the approach based on linear pH gradients is feasible because of the limited pH range useful for salt gradient elution. The application of the model for the separation of an acid variant of the antibody from the major monomeric form is discussed. Â© 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

H.; Stamnes, K.\n\n1992-01-01\n\nWe have studied the escape of neutral helium from the terrestrial atmosphere through exothermic charge exchange reactions between He(+) ions and the major atmospheric constituents N2, O2 and O. Elastic collisions with the neutral background particles were treated quantitatively using a recently developed kinetic theory approach. An interhemispheric plasma transport model was employed to provide a global distribution of He(+) ions as a function of altitude, latitude and local solar time and for different levels of solar ionization. Combining these ion densities with neutral densities from an MSIS model and best estimates for the reaction rate coefficients of the charge exchange reactions, we computed the global distribution of the neutral He escape flux. The escape rates show large diurnal and latitudinal variations, while the global average does not vary by more than a factor of three over a solar cycle. We find that this escape mechanism is potentially important for the overall balance of helium in the Earth's atmosphere. However, more accurate values for the reaction rate coefficients of the charge exchange reactions are required to make a definitive assessment of its importance.\n\nMoving Towards a State of the Art Charge-Exchange Reaction Code\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPoxon-Pearson, Terri; Nunes, Filomena; Potel, Gregory\n\n2017-09-01\n\nCharge-exchange reactions have a wide range of applications, including late stellar evolution, constraining the matrix elements for neutrinoless double Î²-decay, and exploring symmetry energy and other aspects of exotic nuclear matter. Still, much of the reaction theory needed to describe these transitions is underdeveloped and relies on assumptions and simplifications that are often extended outside of their region of validity. In this work, we have begun to move towards a state of the art charge-exchange reaction code. As a first step, we focus on Fermi transitions using a Lane potential in a few body, Distorted Wave Born Approximation (DWBA) framework. We have focused on maintaining a modular structure for the code so we can later incorporate complications such as nonlocality, breakup, and microscopic inputs. Results using this new charge-exchange code will be shown compared to the analysis in for the case of 48Ca(p,n)48Sc.

In this paper the effect of alternative types of ion exchange membrane is studied in biocatalyzed electrolysis cells. Four types of ion exchange membranes are used: (i) a CEM, (ii) an anion exchange membrane (AEM), (iii) a bipolar membrane (BPM), and (iv) a charge mosaic membrane (CMM). With respect to the electrochemical performance of the four biocatalyzed electrolysis configurations, the ion exchange membranes are rated in the order AEM > CEM > CMM > BPM. However, with respect to the transport numbers for protons and/or hydroxyl ions (t(H/OH)) and the ability to prevent pH increase in the cathode chamber, the ion exchange membranes are rated in the order BPM > AEM > CMM > CEM.\n\nAdsorption of phthalic acid and salicylic acid and their effect on exchangeable Al capacity of variable-charge soils.\n\nPubMed\n\nLi, Jiuyu; Xu, Renkou\n\n2007-02-01\n\nLow-molecular-weight (LMW) organic acids may be adsorbed by soils and the adsorption could affect their biodegradation and efficiency in many soil processes. In the present study, the adsorption of phthalic acid and salicylic acid and their effect on the exchangeable Al capacity of variable-charge soils were investigated. The results indicated that phthalic acid and salicylic acid were adsorbed by four variable-charge soils to some extent, oxisols showed a greater adsorption capacity for organic acids than ultisols, and the ability of the four variable-charge soils to adsorb the organic acids at different pH generally followed the order Kunming oxisol > Xuwen oxisol > Jinxian ultisol > Lechang ultisol, which was closely related to their content of free iron oxides and amorphous iron and aluminum oxides. The adsorption of organic acids induced a decrease in the zeta potentials of soils and oxides. Goethite has greater adsorption capacity for organic acid than Xuwen oxisol and the adsorption of organic acids resulted in a bigger decrease in the zeta potential of goethite suspensions. After free iron oxides were removed, less organic acid was adsorbed by Xuwen oxisol and no change was observed in zeta potential for the soil suspension after organic acid was added. The presence of phthalic acid increased the capacity of exchangeable Al and the increment in the four variable-charge soils also followed the order Kunming oxisol > Xuwen oxisol > Lechang ultisol and Jinxian ultisol. The presence of salicylic acid increased the capacity of exchangeable Al in Kunming oxisol, Xuwen oxisol, and Jinxian ultisol, but decreased it in Lechang ultisol due to less adsorption of the acid and formation of soluble Al-salicylate complexes in solution. After free iron oxides were removed, less effect of organic acid on exchangeable Al was observed for Xuwen oxisol, which further confirmed that the iron oxides played a significant role in organic acid adsorption and had a consequent effect\n\nDeuterium charge exchange recombination spectroscopy from the top of the pedestal to the scrape off layer in H-mode plasmas\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHaskey, S.

Typically only the impurity properties are measured and the main-ion properties are either assumed to be the same, or inferred using neoclassical models, which require validation in the steep gradient region. Furthermore, these measured differences have implications for transport model validation, intrinsic rotation studies, pedestal stability, and the boundary conditions for scrape off layer and plasma material interactions studies.Â«Â less\n\nObserved Limits on Charge Exchange Contributions to the Diffuse X-Ray Background\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCrowder, S. G.; Barger, K. A.; Brandl, D. E.; Eckart, M. E.; Galeazzi, M.; Kelley, R. L.; Kilbourne, C. A.; McCammon, D.; Pfendner, C. G.; Porter, F. S.; Rocks, L.; Szymkowiak, A. E.; Teplin, I. M.\n\n2012-10-01\n\nWe present a high-resolution spectrum of the diffuse X-ray background from 0.1 to 1 keV for a ~1 sr region of the sky centered at l = 90Â°, b = +60Â° using a 36 pixel array of microcalorimeters flown on a sounding rocket. With an energy resolution of 11 eV FWHM below 1 keV, the spectrum's observed line ratios help separate charge exchange contributions originating within the heliosphere from thermal emission of hot gas in the interstellar medium. The X-ray sensitivity below 1 keV was reduced by about a factor of four from contamination that occurred early in the flight, limiting the significance of the results. The observed centroid of helium-like O VII is 568+2 - 3 eV at 90% confidence. Since the centroid expected for thermal emission is 568.4 eV and for charge exchange is 564.2 eV, thermal emission appears to dominate for this line complex. The dominance of thermal emission is consistent with much of the high-latitude O VII emission originating in 2-3 Ã 106 K gas in the Galactic halo. On the other hand, the observed ratio of C VI LyÎ³ to LyÎ± is 0.3 Â± 0.2. The expected ratios are 0.04 for thermal emission"
